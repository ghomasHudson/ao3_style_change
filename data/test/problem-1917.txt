Potter laughs at him. “So mysterious,” he says, and Draco scowls. It doesn’t deter him in the slightest. “Come on, give me something?” He presses. At Draco’s continued silence, he prompts. “What about the job. What do you do?”
Potter huffs and drops his arms. “Alright, I know when I’m beat,” he grumbles.
“What?” says Potter blankly. Draco does look up then, and finds Potter staring at him.
The trudge to the shop is long, as it’s all the way at the other end of Knockturn right on the corner of Diagon. Draco spends the whole walk with his head down, hands thankfully tucked in his pockets as the wind is to his back, steeling himself for the upcoming unpleasantry.
Giving up on the mirror, he goes over to his little stove and fiddles with it, trying to coax it to life. It takes a minute but, against all odds, turns on. Draco inwardly cheers. He’s going to be expending energy today, if he’s to go skating, and he hadn’t eaten yesterday. It most certainly won’t do to faint in front of Potter just because his stove won’t cooperate.
It’s with great trepidation that he pauses at the entrance to Diagon. He knows, logically – or illogically, as the case may be – that he won’t be hurt there. That nobody will recognize him if he steps out of Knockturn’s shadow into the bright street of Diagon. It’s one thing to know this, however, and another to believe it, and Draco can’t stop the fear that curls icy fingers up his spine.
He chooses the little round table nearest to the front window and sits, looking out at the twinkling street. Once upon a time, he would have looked down on a place like this. Now, he barely feels that he belongs, with his holey gloves and tattered, baggy clothes. He privately thanks Potter’s apparently overly active sense of remorse that’s led to him being here.
And then add to that that Squibs have a harder time getting well-paying jobs. Even for a position like caretaker, most employers would sooner hire someone able to use magic, since they’d be more efficient. It’s not impossible for a Squib to get a well-paid job, of course, but it’s much harder.
He’s very early – the clock on the wall shows that it’s just barely eight, and they’re not set to meet until two. He has plenty of time to make use of the library, and he’s hoping to move onto more advanced wandless theory.
Potter stares at him. “You never… really?” He says. Draco meets his gaze, baffled.
“Get off you great oaf, you’re heavy,” he complains dramatically, shrugging Potter’s arm off. Potter gasps in mock offence.
Muggle vehicles race along the street, their lights leaving bright streaks when Draco blinks. Bundled up Muggles walk by, mostly alone or in pairs. They usually stay out of the road but deftly avoid the vehicles when they do cross. Many of them have small boxes that emit a small square of light, and they hold these up to their ears or poke at their lower half intently.
“Don’t you dare drop me!” He shrieks, and Potter laughs.
Potter has stopped laughing somewhat abruptly, and Draco opens his eyes to see him picking up his mug and taking a huge gulp. He then immediately flails, sputtering “Hot! Hot!” and dripping hot chocolate from his mouth and probably from his nose also.
He opens his mouth, about to tell her “No, sorry,” but something in her eyes stops him. It’s the desperation that he sees, something he has experienced so often in his own life. How often has he wished somebody would just give him a helping hand? Now it appears that he’s in the position to give the helping hand. He has little, but he has enough to help.
He decides to wash his hair again today – it’s a warmer day, which means less effort to dry it, and he’s not about to waste that. He is quick and efficient in the shower, as usual, and he dresses first before sitting on the bed and holding his hands up to his head. He concentrates, feeling for his magic and pulling it to his will, and he could swear that the charm comes easier to him today as it leaps to his instruction and surrounds his head with warm air.
Belatedly, he realises Potter’s saying something to him. “Sorry?” He asks. His face is going to be permanently red at this point.
Sings the Muggle on the wireless, and it rings in Draco’s chest. He peers up at Potter through his lashes – the other man is humming along, happily stirring his drink with a candy cane and then sticking it into his mouth, and the realization trickles down his spine, slow and warm like treacle, that he’s maybe falling a little bit in love.
His life really has gone to shite, and it’s not as though he doesn’t deserve it but that doesn’t make it any easier to deal with. He thinks about his past self, of that carefree, spoilt child that he’d been, and mourns for him. He wishes he could go back to that time and stay there, suspended in cruel ignorance forever. Some days, he wishes he’d died at the Battle of Hogwarts, gotten caught up in the Fiendfyre after all or perhaps been caught by a stray curse on the battlefield, or sentenced to death by the Ministry. Surely it would be preferable to struggling to eke out the miserable existence he has now.
Draco pulls his head back and closes the door, rolling his eyes. It’s not as if a customer will see him now that the store’s closed, so he doesn’t bother heeding Forsythe’s request. It’s in his best interest to ensure that Forsythe can’t pretend that Draco’s ducked out early.
Ugbert scowls at him. “No hoods in my store,” he snaps, gesturing sharply at a sign beside the counter. Draco grimaces, but tugs off his hood and scowls back at Ugbert.
“Good morning,” Draco returns with a polite smile. He makes a beeline, this time, straight to the back where he’d found the volumes on wandless magic yesterday. He’d just reached the section of the book dedicated to harmonizing energy, magic, and intent, when he’d had to leave yesterday, and he’s eager to return to it.
A shout of “I’ll be right with you!” echoes from the back room, and Draco takes a steadying breath and walks up to the counter. The curtain to the back room is pushed aside and the shop’s proprietor enters. He is a long, spindly man with rich, thick chestnut hair and a well-groomed beard. His dark, sunken eyes dart to meet Draco’s, and a greasy smile crosses his face, revealing several gold teeth.
Disheartened, Draco bundles himself as much as he can in his ragged little blanket and climbs into bed. It doesn’t provide much warmth, and he sits there miserably as the shivers keep coming.
Draco scoffs. “I’m not
Potter laughs. “Sod off, you!” He says. Draco smirks.
Potter rolls his eyes. “Sure,” he says. “We’re not going to the ice anymore. Why not cast a warming charm?”
“Emory Hughes,” Potter repeats, smiling. “I’m Harry Potter.”
“Are you ready to go then?” he asks. Potter leans back on the bench and shakes his head, waving a hand in the general direction of the ice.
“It’s a date,” he says, and Draco’s face burns even further at the wording. He knows that Potter doesn’t mean anything by it, and it’s better that he doesn’t, but his stupid heart is still doing somersaults.
It tugs a bit at Draco’s mood. He hates winter, and he hates Christmas.
He can hear the laughter in Potter’s voice when he replies, “Wouldn’t dream of it.”
He hasn’t been to Diagon in years, nearly a decade by this point. If Knockturn is unkind to him, Diagon is downright bloodthirsty. Draco doesn’t exactly blame them – it’s not as though he hasn’t brought it on with his own actions – but he also feels perfectly justified in avoiding the place.
Unbidden, the memory of his dream from last night comes to him. Anonymity – not to be recognized even by those who look plain upon his face.
Potter is still frowning, but his lips twitch slightly. “Merlin Emory, that’s a bit dramatic,” he says. He waves his wand carelessly. “But don’t worry about it. I’ve been set alight more times than I can count – job hazard, you know? I’m very handy with an extinguishing spell. Go ahead.”
Potter takes his arm as soon as he’s finished putting the book away, half-leading and half-dragging him toward the front of the library. They take a small detour to the section on wizarding law, where Granger is browsing the shelves with single-minded determination, so that Potter can call his goodbyes. He barely waits for her reply before he’s leading Draco away again.
“Alright, something sweet,” he says, his green eyes impossibly soft. Draco has never seen those eyes look at him with anything but hatred, and having it now sends electric sparks through his body. Draco shudders, forcing the thought away.
Potter is not lying. He is, in fact, pants at it. Draco is wobbly when he first steps out onto the ice, his skating skills rusty from disuse, but Potter is almost tragically off-balance. Draco catches his arm to steady him before he falls on his arse, laughing slightly at the way Potter clutches at him. He’s beginning to wonder if Potter has ever been on the ice at all.
He seems almost eager. Draco sighs. He’s cold, and he doesn’t want to argue with Potter. “Very well. I shall accept no complaints if something goes awry,” he says. Potter just nods encouragingly.
He makes his way all the way back to his apartment with his hood still down and the watery winter sunlight lighting his bright hair like a beacon, and nobody says anything to him at all. Once back in his apartment, he draws open the curtain and allows the sun to fall across his bed unimpeded.
Potter frowns. “Can you not cast a warming charm wandlessly though? Surely you didn’t leave your wand behind without being able to do it in this weather.” He asks.
“Don’t worry about it dear,” she replies, patting him on the arm. She totters off, disappearing behind her counter. Draco watches after her, and wonders if she was the same librarian who had worked here when he’d come as a child. He’d never paid attention to those whom he’d considered ‘the help’ back then. Merlin, but he’d been a brat.
Draco throws a crumb of toasted bagel at him. “How dare you,” he sniffs. “I’m a delight, I’ll have you know.”
His fingers loosen their grip on the book, and he allows himself to sink further into the armchair and actually start reading again. It’s interesting stuff, the theory behind wandless magic and the changes that must be adjusted for when not using a conduit. He lips move along silently as he reads a passage about the delicacy of shaping and directing magic by will alone.
“Her,” he says with a confused frown. Potter starts laughing.
Potter beams, bouncing eagerly on the balls of his feet. “No problem,” he says. “Are you going to put it on?”
Draco blinks. A wish made manifest – a child’s tale from his bedtime stories. Merlin, he’s done one good deed and now his subconscious is dragging up a fairy-tale reward for his dreams. He rolls his eyes at himself.
Draco wakes to an absolutely frigid morning and cold sun in his eyes, but for once it doesn’t dampen his mood. He’s positively chipper as he hurries through his morning shower and pulls on his stiff, cold clothes. He manages to get his stove working and, though he’s skipping breakfast today, he boils plain water in lieu of tea. He just barely waits until it’s cool enough before sipping it from a chipped mug, enjoying the warmth it brings.
“You’re not making any sense Potter,” he says.
Draco hums and thinks it over, but something about calling him Harry is too intimate. “Hmm, no, I think I like Potter better,” he decides.
“That’s terribly cold of you!” He says cheerfully. Draco scowls distrustingly, but Potter is just skating along with a smile now. Then, something hits the back of his legs and he falls, yelping. Potter is immediately there to catch him, and he’s got a self-satisfied smirk on. Draco stares at him, wide-eyed, before the familiarity of the earlier feeling hits him.
Potter snorts, but grips Draco’s hand firmly and pulls him to his feet. Draco sleepily admires the ease with which he does so. He pokes at Potter’s bicep and finds it firm with solid muscle. “Bloody Aurors”, he mutters, then grabs his book and wanders off to the shelf to return it. When he returns, Potter’s face is as red as Auror robes, and that’s when Draco realises what he’s done.
Draco stares stubbornly at his book for a moment, then sighs. This, at least, is harmless. “I work in a shop.” He says shortly. “I’m really not very interesting Potter.”
Draco awakes from his strange dream and, with nothing to do on his first day of vacation, secludes himself in his room. But when an accident forces him to go outside, he finds that people are acting strangely toward him.
Potter raises his brows. “I thought it was just an interest?” He challenges.
Draco’s stomach turns restlessly, reminding him of how perpetually hungry he is. He knows that he shouldn’t, but he can’t resist.
The shop that has Granger’s wool turns out to be back on Diagon. It’s one of the new storefronts, a small building called “Walker’s Enchanted Fabrics”. It’s warm and cozy inside, and smells of new fabric in the most delightful way. Draco lets Potter get on with his errand and wanders through the various displays of fabric and wool skeins. He’s drawn to a midnight blue bolt, the fabric shot through with an icy white-blue that twinkles like stars. It’s soft to his touch, like silk, and Draco feels a melancholy ache somewhere in his chest as he runs his hand down it. It’s the type of fabric he would absolutely have coveted once upon a time, the kind that his father would have commissioned the finest of robes from at Draco’s demand.
answers the light. It floats closer. “
When his skin starts to sting from it and shivers wrack his body, Draco gives in and pushes himself to his feet. A glance to the crate at his bedside confirms that he has an extinguisher – a charmed orb designed for Squibs, that puts out fires when broken – so he steadies himself to try again.
“How does 2 o’clock tomorrow sound?” Asks Potter. “I can pick you up?”
He carries the items up to the counter, where a bored-looking teenager grunts “Hi there,” at him. It’s barely anything, but it’s neither aggressive nor flirtatious and Draco craves these small moments of human interaction.
For some reason, Potter goes red. “Something like that,” he replies shiftily, not meeting Draco’s eyes. Draco raises an eyebrow, but Potter doesn’t elaborate further. Instead, he whips out his wand and summons another armchair from somewhere in the library.
“Hi dear,” she says, “just coming by to see if you’d like a cup of tea?”
Potter smirks, unrepentant. “I caught you,” he points out.
“Oh, I don’t know, I could think of a few things.”
Somehow catapulted into motion, he found himself outside on his balcony, his arms stretched out in front of himself shaking them rapidly and letting the cool rain water soothe the ache in his hands. As soon as the rain touched the conch shell it fell to the floor and rolled clattering along the stone until it rested against the banister. Draco was almost too scared to look at his hands, because he feared what he might find. In the end uncertainty became worse than knowing and he turned them upwards into the rain, inspecting them closely.
“You know what he did during the war-“
Silence stretches between them after that. Harry’s eyes are slowly getting used to the darkness in the room and he thinks he has correctly identified one of the shapes as Draco. He’s not sure if he should go over there or leave. Since he still hasn’t anything to show for the weeks without contact since they slept together, he decides to leave. Harry pats his pockets but can’t seem to locate his wand. The Draco shape speaks up again.
am the one who’s being selfish?”
“I’ll pick you up at eight at your place tomorrow night then, if that meets with your approval?” Harry said, neither of them able to entirely tear themselves away.
“Of course, Mr. Potter. Before I reveal the details I’d like you to acknowledge that you owe me a life debt.”
“Four minutes.”
Draco whimpers in distress as Harry’s fingers find the crack of his arse and slowly delve deeper. “Please stop,” he hears himself beg, but Harry only chuckles darkly and continues as if Draco hadn’t spoken. The rider and his winged
The ground seems to be clasping at his feet now, slowing him down as if gravity is constantly increasing. His steps slow down until he cannot move anymore. Draco tries to take a step forward, but while he is able to pick up his feet, if he tries to move into any direction he runs into invisible walls. His heart is racing and he can feel panic rising in his chest.
“You’re welcome.”
“I had run out of options, I even read the books you had read to find out what was going on. So I snuck onto the Manor grounds under my cloak and hid on your balcony.”
“No, it’s alright, you can sleep in the bed with me,” Harry said, desperately hoping Malfoy would say yes.
“How can you not care about this?” Draco said and angrily brushed back the hood of the jumper. “How can this not make a difference to how you feel? I’m a freak and I will always be a freak according to Pansy’s results. How high are the chances that whoever hated me enough to curse me will willingly remove the spell? I’m not like you, Harry. People don’t immediately like me, people hear my last name and they immediately think about how to hit me without it being obvious enough for me to press charges.”
“No, Draco, you keep it. You deserve it.” Harry smiled and then took out his wand and cast a quick stasis charm on it. “So it’ll stay fresh longer.”
The moon lit the road and the surrounding fields and trees, making the ice crystals glow and leaving the impression of walking down a plain of diamonds.
Draco doesn’t have to continue for Harry to understand. While what he wants most is to chase the darkness around Draco away, he knows it’s not as simple as tearing open the curtains and casting a few cleaning charms. Although, coming to think of it, the latter might be a good idea. Draco seems to have anticipated his objections to using the room and calls a house elf in to prepare the room for what they will have to do.
“Of course I am. Who reads an empty journal?”
The mantelpiece was lined with delicate china figurines and maybe to spite the elf, Harry stepped up to them and was just about to pick one up, when the sound of the door opening behind him made him jump. Only the tight reign he had on himself stopped him from babbling out something as embarrassing as “I wasn’t touching anything, I swear.”
He sighed deeply and wearily brushed a strand of hair out of his eyes. He had promised Harry he’d never leave, but after their last fight, he couldn’t bear the sight of their shared belongings and their flat anymore. Draco had been out of sorts all day and having backed himself into a corner, with no way to escape, he’d lashed out. He’d fucked up royally and he knew it, this wasn’t the first time either, although it probably was the last.
“I’ll get you for that Malfoy!”
“I’m not sure it’d be good if he sees me here. And you should probably clean that up before you let him back in here.” Draco said pointing at the come stains on Harry’s chest. Harry grinned and cast a quick cleaning charm and flicked his wand over Draco without him having to ask for it.
He realised he had gone too far, when Draco disentangled himself and got up. Harry was already resigned to his fate and thinking about what excuses he could make to leave and escape this unbearable situation, when Draco climbed into his lap. Draco took Harry’s arms and wrapped them around his own waist while he rested his wrists on Harry’s shoulders, playing with the hair at Harry’s nape.
“You cheeky bugger!” he whispers fondly, before he allows himself to drift off to sleep.
killing me.
“Draco! Dear Merlin, you're awake, you are actually awake!” Draco was crushed into what must have been a mattress by something whoever was doing the crushing apparently considered a hug. Finally letting him go, when he started coughing and choking, but still clutching his hand, whoever was with him, continued.
“Draco, what are you doing here? Are you visiting someone? I haven’t seen you in ages.”
Cursing he brought his hand up to his face trying to determine whether the thorns had actually broken the skin, only to feel warm blood against his fingers. If only he had his wand, he could heal his face and light the way back. He cursed himself this time for not bringing a source of light with him.
Filled with new fervour, Harry gripped his wand and began cleaning the lighthouse. He banished year-old layers of dust, evicted several dozens spiders and one very startled toad from underneath an old sofa. All in all it was a very productive morning. Harry took his break out on the steps, enjoying the few rays of sun that broke through the cloud cover and inhaling the salty wind that tousled his hair. He ate the last of the sandwiches he had left over from the day before. The bread was stale and the cheese a bit chewy, but Harry didn’t mind. He would go into the village later on to buy supplies and treat himself to dinner, he decided.
Harry nodded as if to say it was okay.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Suddenly Draco froze and looked up at him expectantly, he must have made a noise he thought. When Harry didn’t speak, Draco politely inquired how he could be of assistance, stressing Harry’s rank and title.
“Sorry about that,” Percy says, before he taps the parchment with his quill. It folds up into an envelope and zips out of the room through a small slit in the door that Harry hadn’t noticed when he had come in. “Really needed to get that report out to my boss. Oliver and I are going on holiday next week.”
With that she turned and walked out of his life.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
They might as well have been at different ends of the universe for all that stood unspoken between them, constantly moving them further apart.
“Can you call one of your house elves over?” Before he has finished speaking a house elf appears beside them. It seems like the wards weren’t the only things that were changed when it came to Harry.
“I am glad, because this gives us a chance to get to know each other better. And I really want to, get to know you better I mean. Do you want to come and have dinner with us?” Harry asked sounding like he was grasping at straws to come up with a reason to prolong their encounter.
Draco remembered one of those desperate moments the day before.
And then it was finally over. The flames rose high one last time and then all that was left of the diary was a pile of ashes in the fireplace. Draco felt as if a veil had been lifted. Sensation rushed back to him seemingly intensified a thousand-fold. The hard wooden floor beneath him digging into his legs, the smell of wet earth and rain from outside and the warmth of Harry at his back being the most predominant ones.
Harry had a hard time aligning the man in front of him with the boy he had known from school.
“Shhhhhh, must be quiet! Don’t want to wake the house!” Harry said with the kind of stage whisper only completely drunk people considered to be quiet.
That’s when Hermione steps in, touching Parkinson’s arm and assuring her that while Harry might sometimes be slow on the uptake he always means well and that in this case she’ll make sure that whatever he does, nothing gets done that’s not in the best interest of those involved.
“How is she? Is she okay, is the baby okay?”
“Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!” Draco added for good measure, running his hand through his hair in a gesture of exhaustion. “Fucking Harry Potter!”  He went on, seeing how it was all his fault.
Draco pulled out of him slowly almost all the way, before pushing back in, their skin making a slapping sound when Draco was sheathed all the way once more. Draco picked up the pace, if only slightly and Harry met each and every one of his thrusts, still not quite enjoying himself, but not wanting to stop either way.
His mother takes Draco’s hand in hers for a moment and gently strokes it, never meeting his gaze. They all stare into the flames. For just a moment Draco allows himself to believe, to trust that things will be okay. The moment is fleeting and all too soon reality encroaches. He should feel like part of a family, a unity, but all he feels is  a part of a group of three, staring forlornly at a fire, that crackles with the promise of warmth and cheerfulness that will never be theirs again.
He’d gently detached the tiny scroll from the bird’s leg, patting it and digging through his pockets for an owl treat. After the bird had eaten, it gently nipped Draco’s finger and then took off.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
There was the fact that he was currently trapped inside a lift, with none other than one Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World. One very drunk and touchy-feely Harry Potter to be precise. It wasn’t even like Draco minded the touchy-feely part so much, it was quite nice, if he was completely honest, but it still wasn’t right.
Later in his flat Draco contemplated whether he was just being paranoid or whether somebody was actually following him. If so, that somebody obviously had access to polyjuice potion. Considering what had happened to other former Death Eaters, it was very unlikely that the stranger’s intentions were to surprise Draco with flowers and a song.
His dreams over the next few weeks were filled with visions of Voldemort’s reign at the manor, of being cut up by a thoughtlessly cast curse and always Harry’s green eyes, grinning and laughing at him. It was always Harry in his dreams, never Potter. In his dreams, Harry saved him from the fiendfyre again and again, but when they reached the safety of the corridor before the room of lost things, Harry would just push him back into the flames and the last thing he would see before he pushed the door shut trapping him in the room was Harry and his friends and the ginger-haired girl laughing.
If Dudley thinks he behaved like a bully in the park then maybe he really did. But doesn’t Draco deserve it all, the filthy liar and bigoted racist that he is? Doesn’t he deserve anything bad that happened to him? Harry is unable to find an answer. However something like worry remains.
“I was here because I was—…” Harry gasped and pressed his hands to his middle as if he was experiencing severe pain. “She really wasn’t kidding when—” Harry bent double his breathing becoming ragged. Draco watched him cough and dry-retch. Harry’s fingers came away from his lips glistening with something. Was that blood? Draco was too confused and scared to react. Eventually the coughing subsided and Harry, looking white as a sheet, sat up, pulling his knees close.
Draco just looks at him.
He must have fallen asleep there, because that was where his mother had found him, berating him for being so careless and asking what had happened to get him into this state. Draco tried to tell her, he really did, but something stopped him, his mouth offering other explanations whenever he tried to tell the truth.
Draco knows who is waiting for him on the other side of the gates. He knows tonight will be the last night he’ll be here, like he’s been here every night since Draco came back from Hogwarts for the holidays. What he doesn’t know is why the man is here, or what he wants from Draco and that worries him more than he is willing to admit.
“Oops,” Harry exclaimed, sounding less than apologetic. Draco looked over to find out what had happened and saw the sou’wester floating in a nearby puddle. Still playing then.
“What’s going on?” Draco asked, but Pansy had already run from the room. Draco assumed that Pansy was probably worried that Scorpius had accidentally tumbled over some of her work material, but Draco knew better. Scorpius was very meticulous in his work, just like his father. Time passed and was recorded by a huge dark grandfather clock opposite the fire place. After more than five minutes had passed, that probably meant that Pansy was being a bit of a Diva and his son getting yelled at for breaking something expensive that Draco would have to pay for, he wondered how long she was going to be. A quick glance over his shoulder at his own room showed that Loki still had not returned. With nothing better to do, Draco waited, his mood getting darker with every second that ticked by.
Harry craved safety more than anything else and somehow having Malfoy in his home seemed like the best option. Malfoy looked at him enquiringly for a moment before shrugging and climbing into bed beside Harry.
Harry paused at the gate and finally turned to look at his partner.
“Draco? Is that you? What are you doing here?”
The first map he unrolled was also the one that Harry had found himself. Draco lit up when he saw the little notations and the images of the sea creatures just above where Harry now knew the city lay. Draco traced the lines reverently and then looked directly up at Harry.
He helped Harry up and settled him into the armchair by the fire, before turning towards the door.
Harry laughed and pressed Draco against his side, resting his hand on Draco’s neck and playing with the soft hair there.
“What’s that got to do with anything? He’s been living at my place and working with me every day for over nine months. It would be weird if we weren’t on first name terms. Also, all of his stuff is still impounded and locked up, of course he gets to use my dressing gown. It’s not like he can go out and buy a new one himself, is it? Why has this become a problem all of a sudden? You were perfectly aware of the situation when they made me his custodian. Besides, I am not asking you about who you’re on first name terms with either, am I?”
Draco shook his head. He helped Potter to stand up properly, the light above the doors indicated they were about to arrive in the Atrium. They could talk about this later, maybe.
Malfoy pouted. He actually pouted at Harry, looking even more crestfallen than he had in the pub when Ron had tried to call Harry away. He knew he would regret it, but Harry let go of Malfoy’s wrists. Instead he cupped Malfoy’s face, holding him in place and stroking his jaw on both sides with his thumbs.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“Malfoy,” he croaked. “You’re alright?”
“I sent Sophia with a letter, remember? I mean, considering you basically took her hostage I figured you’d at least read the note I sent.”
“I need to check something but I’ll need to use my wand for it.” This new peace between them seems so fragile, Harry thinks it’s best to announce his plans rather than act without explanation. It’s a lesson in self discipline, but he finds he doesn’t mind so much, because he’s doing it for Draco.
“Pervert.” It’s the first time in years that Draco grins at him.
So they meet occasionally, handing over their children to each other and then parting ways. Except for that one day where they all meet in London to go Hogwarts shopping for their children. It’s Dudley’s third time already. They are sitting on one of the lawns after having carefully stepped over the “don’t walk on the grass” sign that now says “please bring your own blankets” and are watching their children wreak havoc. Some of the passersby give them annoyed looks that parents the world over are used to ignoring completely. Children are noisy and sticky and they are supposed to be like that.
“I always got the impression they were the aggressors in this situation. Why else would so many of them have their wands destroyed after the war?”
“Pureblood Wanker!”
Christmas had come and gone and in his case been a solitary affair. His mother wasn’t returning to the Manor. She’d taken a townhouse in a city closer to Azkaban so she could visit Lucius whenever possible and since Draco had refused to leave the Manor, he’d had to spend Christmas Eve alone.
With his luck, his and Malfoy’s children are probably headed for what they call BFF-ship already and just haven’t wanted to tell him yet. To be fair it is safe to say that their friendship will never lead to sleepovers of any kind, a Malfoy will never sleep under his roof again, not after everything.
“I believe you,” he finally said.
Harry whimpered when he heard those words and quickly grabbed his ever present wand. He was shaking as he took Draco’s palm pointed his wand and conjured a small quantity of clear gel.
Draco fell asleep with his eyes still fixed on the shell.
“Not usually, why?” Draco asked, curious where Harry was going with this.
It was nice to have some control at last. Usually it was just Harry taking charge, doing all sorts of things to him. Not that it didn’t have its merits, Draco had had quite a few spectacular orgasms that way, but if the former Gryffindor could be forward, so could he.
That wasn’t the only strange thing. Harry had gone back to the pub several times. He had spoken with several of the patrons, asking about the village and its history and generally just satisfying his growing craving for human contact. When he came back the next time however, the people he had spoken to didn’t seem to remember him or when he asked about an elderly lady he had spoken to, nobody seemed to remember her either.
“No,” he managed to force out and pressed himself firmly back against the stone. It was all he knew, the only thing outside of himself that he was sure was real. He wished he could become one with the stone and hide away.
“Harry, are you ok?”
“I don’t know how much more of this so called fun I can take. We’ve been here for hours.”
Ron gave Malfoy a dirty look and tried to push Harry towards the booth their friends still occupied. The crestfallen look that momentarily clouded Malfoy’s beautiful features – and when they had ceased being pointy and gitty and turned into beautiful was more than Harry knew – made Harry change his mind.
“Thank you.”
Draco didn’t think that he deserved such a kind reaction from someone who had essentially been tortured and locked up in his own basement for months. Luna however didn’t give him a choice.
A comfortable quiet settled over them.
The result of the magical signature trace, when it comes back from the laboratory that Hermione supervises leaves no doubt. The curse that had affected Draco had been cast by none other than Harry’s Head of Department, Susan Bones. When she is arrested she simply states that what she had done was no less than what Draco Malfoy deserved, especially since the Wizengamot had decided not to punish him despite the atrocities that he had committed.
Despite the constant glamour that he wore that ate at his skin and left him in agony for hours afterwards, he felt like an impostor, like everyone was staring at him, like they all knew what he was hiding from them. In the end, Draco was unable to differentiate between dream and reality, withdrawing completely from society. The glamour though stayed on, there were too many reflective surfaces in his home and no escaping what whoever had attacked him had turned him into.
Draco didn’t know how he was going to get out of this; obviously apologising had been a bad move despite it seeming like the right thing to do at the time. Draco wished he could think clearly, but having Potter this close was incredibly distracting If only Potter wasn’t so damn attractive when his every fibre was humming with rage, his treacherous thoughts added. If Potter came any closer, he’d find out just how distracting he was being. Draco had to act and soon.
“I’m quite sure it’s too late for that Harry. Malfoy could probably have heard it in his room if this was Hogwarts and he was down in the dungeon where he belongs!”
“’s alright.” He mumbled. Making an effort to speak more clearly, he added “don’t want him to leave.”
If he remembered correctly, nobody knew who they were or what their goal was. There was always some dark wizard on the rise somewhere. Harry certainly knew that, but Voldemort was dead and gone. He still wasn’t sure whether the reason nobody knew was because they actually didn’t know, or because Luna Lovegood had taken over editing of
Draco felt guilty for not having fun. It was as if something was luring him back home, as if any time spent away from there was wasted and useless. Even though this seemed odd, considering how much Draco had looked forward to spending time with Harry, he couldn’t explain why he so desperately wanted to leave. He should simply be honest with Harry, they were supposed to be friends and you told your friends things like that.
Over the course of that year, Harry had slowly come to terms with his feelings for Draco. He’d spoken to Hermione often, working through his guilt and self-hatred, to become a person worthy of the man he loved.
“Draco?”
It wasn’t until Harry was halfway across the room that the men’s intent sunk in. They had talked about drugging someone, about abducting him and humiliating him. The words “fuck him raw until he bleeds and then make him beg” suddenly appeared in the front of his mind and made him feel sick to his stomach. He had to hold on to the back of someone’s chair and take a couple of deep breaths before he could move on.
“My name is Draco Abraxas Cygnus Malfoy; how do you do? Feel free to call me Draco.”
“Fuck!” Harry shouted and hit his fist on the table so hard it hurt. The pain filled him with grim sense of satisfaction. If only there was another way, if he could somehow convince Malfoy of the need to be careful. Perhaps if Harry spent more time with him…
“Finite incantatem.”
The torsion clock in the corner chimed brightly just after she had left and Draco realised that he was at least half an hour late.
It took him longer than anticipated to find the passage. His mother had berated him in her subtle understated manner for being late for tea earlier and had made him promise to come down for dinner as well to make up for it. He had actually set an alarm to make sure he wasn’t late again.
“Close your eyes.”
Harry had no answer to that. He was surprised when Malfoy took one of his hands and squeezed it reassuringly.
“I—“ Harry swallowed and finally moved away enough to meet Draco’s gaze. “Please don’t be messing with me”
Draco kissed him again Harry clinging to him as if he was afraid Draco would leave once more.
A trembling moan of relief escaped Harry when Draco finally reached his already leaking prick and lapped at it languidly.
“Draco… I…”
“Do you want me to stop?” Draco said, his voice shaky with need.
“Potter, is that…?”
Harry tried to banish those dark thoughts to no avail. He had to come up with a plan.
That’s how it went for the next few months. Draco would work on whatever task Potter decided to give him. He’d never complain, he’d never even speak unless spoken to, and before he knew it, the first quarterly review of his case and conduct had come and gone.
“Please, come in.”
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Pansy inhaled sharply at the sight in front of her. The time it took her to gather her wits and come over, her white coat flapping open, told Draco just how bad it really was. He might be willing to admit that sometimes he tended to exaggerate when it came to his own appearance and some people might call him a drama queen but in this case he felt justified. He could feel her warm, dry hand brush across his exposed scalp.
Draco takes a deep breath and nods.
Holding Draco’s face in his hands, he whispered against his lips.
“Mr. Malfoy, if you would follow me into examination room 6 please.”
As much as Harry wants Luna to be wrong, the fact that no investigation had followed such an obvious attack leaves him very few options. He’s an Auror, he has a responsibility to society to serve and protect. Even to those members of society that have less than a clean slate and might not deserve it. Which is why he begins to look further into attacks against former Death Eaters or because he begins to worry about Albus, against members of Slytherin house. Strangely, he doesn’t find any further reports. When he digs a little deeper, what he finds are reports on accidents, to investigate those further, he will have to requisition data from other branches of government which would mean starting a paper trail.
“How did I get in?”
Harry couldn’t suppress the noise he made at the feeling of Draco nibbling on his earlobe. He was already lost and he didn’t mind one bit.
Quick steps approached his bed and he could feel somebody, presumably Potter, giving his hand a reassuring squeeze.
“I thought I’d lost you,” the voice said, sounding anguished.
“That’s not...”
Harry had jumped up and was now pacing the room in agitation. “I didn’t know what to do after I found out what they had planned for you, alright? I panicked and then when you didn’t remember anything I thought that maybe it was better, that it didn’t matter that I wanted… that I hoped…” Harry wrung his hands and Draco’s resolve melted a little in the face of Harry’s distress.
They forewent desert, which was probably a shame, but Draco didn’t want to prolong the evening unnecessarily. The light mood from earlier had completely dissipated and even when his moans of delight over the perfect Espresso made Harry laugh but still didn’t bring his smile back Draco longed to go home even more.
The heavy book in the centre of the table was a volume on the Malfoy family history, only one of Malfoy blood would be able to open it and find anything other than blank pages. Draco was trying to find out what had happened to Pyxis, but so far had had no luck whatsoever. It was almost as if Pyxis was just a figment of his imagination, as if he had never existed. Draco was beginning to doubt his own sanity. The several dozen letters written by someone called DaVinci addressed to someone called Copernicus didn’t help to clear up the matter in any way.
They sat there quietly for a while neither breaking eye contact. Malfoy’s hands were warm and comfortable where they still held Harry’s palms against his chest. The fabric there was soft across the very solid feel of Malfoy’s pectoral muscles.
Draco turned over, burrowing his head into the soft pillows, but sleep eluded him. It was probably kept away by the ruckus the birds were making outside, he thought grumpily. On any other day, if he had been less tired, he might have enjoyed their song, but today he knew that before his first cup of coffee nothing would delight him. What could those creatures possibly have to chatter away about so loudly anyway? Maybe they wouldn’t be as annoying if he closed the windows.
He tried to reply, but his lips refused to move.
As Harry recounted what had happened the night before, Malfoy grew even paler.
“Protego Maxima, obviously.”
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“No, we used to be what you might call rivals.”
Harry’s limbs felt as if they were made of lead as he reached for Draco and turned him around to face Harry. Draco tried to speak, but Harry wasn’t paying attention anymore. His hands were shaking so badly he tightened his grip on Draco and pulled him as close as he could. Harry pushed his lips against Draco’s pouring all of his desperation and longing into it, hoping despite everything for a response.
They had talked for a short while, but Harry had never managed to apologise. The guilt of waking Draco added to the one of not saving him from getting hurt. When Draco had made it clear that his presence wasn’t wanted, he’d left. Harry hadn’t been able to find rest that night. He had tossed and turned and come up with a plan on how to change things.
He felt Harry taking his hand, squeezing it gently and drawing slow circles on the back of it before crawling into bed beside him, resting his head on the pillow beside Draco’s.
He kept returning to the topic of Draco and of how he felt with Draco around him. Even now those memories were overshadowed by guilt, but when Hermione made him talk more about it and tell her what he felt beside the guilt, the enormity of his feelings overcame him once more. When he told her about the diary he’d been keeping, she asked to see it, but he refused, claiming it to be too personal to share with anyone.
The palms of Harry’s hands felt sweaty where they rested against Malfoy’s hips and how they had ended up there was more than Harry knew. Malfoy leant in closer, nuzzling Harry’s jaw.
Outside in the bright and warmth of a splendid summer’s day, the only thing that reassured him his encounter had been real was the comforting weight of his pocket watch settled in its rightful place in his waistcoat.
Harry unravels the strand all the way up to Draco’s cheek and has to sit on his chest to keep him still. The sickly yellow light floats up and then disperses in a shower of sparks. Both of them are panting from exertion.
The door in front of him opens soundlessly when he pushes his hand against it. It opens into a perfectly circular room. The walls are interspersed with alcoves that look like windows, only instead of glass they are covered in pale pink slates that shine with the bright light that is falling in from the outside. The entire room seems to glow with an inner light and pulses to the beat of a heart that is not Draco’s own.
“Please, just go. Just leave me alone.” Draco said, his voice devoid of emotion.
He didn’t know how long it would be until rescue came or if anyone even knew he was missing. The last thing he remembered was waking up on his sofa with Draco draped across him in the warm afternoon light, talking excitedly about something. The memory was fuzzy and when Harry tried to picture it more clearly, it slowly began to drain away, leaving him with an intense sense of loss. Grief overwhelmed him and he couldn’t hold back the sobs when he realised he was utterly alone.
“Hear what? What is this now, some less than eloquent plan to distract me from the fact that-“
“Harry, if I knew that, I would never have to work again.”
Despite his stomach tying itself in knots over the fact that his Harry was out with Ginevra, he sat down and reached for the pasta. He was starving. The stasis charm fell away when he touched it, releasing the cloud of steam it had contained, in one quickly rising cloud of vapour, looking much like a djinn exiting its bottle.
“Harry?”
“Potter, Harry, would you continue reading to me please?” He said, hoping Harry understood it as the peace offering it was.
Their breath rose into the cold night air in small pale clouds as they walked in silence. It didn’t take them long to reach the outskirts of a picturesque village, smoke rising from almost every chimney, the only life signs for miles around. Due to the lateness of the hour most of the windows were darkened. The kind of silence that magnified all sound, which one could only find on a night as bitterly cold as this one, covered the village like a shroud. How fitting then that they didn’t head for any of the cottages, but the churchyard that was on the other side of it.
Harry was laying in the middle of their bed, covered by a mountain of blankets, his tearstained face barely visible in the light cast by the small porcelain lamp. The man was clutching something to his chest that Draco couldn’t quite make out. As Harry shifted again, Draco could see that he was cradling Draco’s favourite jumper to his chest.
“You promise?” Harry was relieved, a year was plenty of time to make Draco change his mind.
“I don’t know, Draco.” Harry sighed.
“I don’t like it either, I only hope he gets here soon so we can get this over with, I don’t much fancy spending all day showing him the ropes!”
, Draco thought and decided to file this observation for later use.
He could feel Harry begin to tense underneath the hand Draco had draped over his back, holding him in place.
an option to get out of this. You will lift the curse right now.”
“It’s beating in perfect time.” Draco looked down at his fingers on Harry’s exposed neck. “Perfectly in time with my own.”
He carefully lowered himself into the grass beneath the rose bush, settling on his haunches and resting his hands on his knees. He closed his eyes, inhaled deeply and let the glorious scent of the blossoms wash over him.
His hands gripped the edge of the desk tightly enough that his knuckles shone white against the already pale skin of his hands.
This small object represented the solution to everything, a promise of profound peace and eternal calm. It was tempting, more tempting than Draco was willing to admit to himself. To just give in, swallow the contents and it would all be over and done with. The emptiness inside would be gone, become one with the vastness of the universe.
“Several things: One, why am I on the floor at what seems to be your house. Two why am I at your place of residence and Three, where the hell are my clothes.”
In the end it was hunger that drove him downstairs to the kitchen. Night had already fallen outside and the first stars had appeared. No candles were lit in room when he arrived and he carefully crept inside, not knowing what to expect, but anticipating the worst. The last thing he needed to see was evidence of Potter’s newfound interest in his girlfriend, not with the wound still raw.
“I’ll put it on your tab then, Mr. Potter, shall I?” The bartender said, raising an eyebrow at the display in front of him and Harry found himself nodding dumbfounded before he took a sip of his own ridiculously sweet cocktail.
“What do you want to talk about then?” he asked but unable to hold back a bit of a jibe despite his better intentions, he continued. “The fact that this is the worst Christmas in the history of horrible Christmases?”
Draco would never admit that one of the reasons he enjoyed reading
What erupted from Draco’s wand was a stream of rainbow coloured lights – how fitting he thought sarcastically, that ran over their skin, then covered them like a cocoon of shiny lights, before separating from them and covering the floor, walls and ceiling and most importantly the blasted lift doors.
“Oh Lord… Oh Merlin…” Oh God, he was being fucked by a tongue. It was inside him and wriggling, pulling in and out and so slick and
“Still not telling me where we’re going?”
“We’d better get going Harry. I’m sure we’ll be missed otherwise.”
“Ah, so that can’t have been it then. Anyway, he tried to bite me. Look,” Potter said, pulling his collar to the side where a dark red bruise was forming. It seemed like Rafferty hadn’t managed to break the skin. Whatever the hell was going on, Draco was only glad that he didn’t have to deal with a medical emergency as well.
“You got that wrong, we’re not rescheduling, Malfoy. You’re coming with me right now!”
“Ah, Mr. Potter, so glad you could come.”
“What do you want to do today?” Harry asked.
“Wimp!”
fights then. Resigned to his fate he tried to calm her down, knowing full well that it was no use. They assumed their respective roles far too easily these days.
“I will.”
“I said, leave.” Malfoy repeats, but his voice lacks conviction and his hand on Harry’s chest isn’t holding him back so much as just holding him there.
Pansy's POV:
“Now, where do we start?” she asked finally, almost in a whisper. She knew she was being weak. Draco would have done it efficiently but all she could offer was her best effort.
This was awful to write I'm sorry it took so long but it was really a pain. I did not expect it to be so hard to write an abuse scene, it made me feel really disgusting so the editing isn't very good and the writing may not be either. I'm honestly debating cutting it all together but ya know, quantity over quality right?
This one is a bit shorter I know, but I have a good reason for it(well a half decent one at least). Besides, there's no reason to make something longer than it needs to be; as ao3 keeps reminding me, brevity is the soul of wit. No worries though, I'll update again soon
Pansy stopped at the door and looked back at him, she let a wry smile reach him, “for now.”
Simply put, he had 3 clear possibilities:
“Look as soon as you find out, come and find me, I’ll be here if you need someone to talk to. And we can do something to get your mind off it.”
“Yeah not to mention there's no point to sabotaging it because it would probably just make it easier to make stuff up anyway,” Ron added.
Draco felt sick.
Weasel had shown a shocking amount of restraint, letting him finish that sentence. Ron was red in the face and looked ready to murder him.
Draco who had been looking down at his sleeves finally looked up. More than anything he was uncertain. Every time he tried to do something his father would appreciate it backfired and instead Lucius looked at him with disbelief that a Malfoy could be such a disappointment to the family name. He could never make his father happy whether he tried or not. The only hope he had was that occasionally his father had a job for him and so decided to be civil.
Three hours later he looked up from the books and his neck cracked, the library closed in two hours and he was no closer to finding any sort of answer. He looked at the stack of books surrounding him dejectedly, this was near impossible. Everything was wrong, he should be researching for his potions class or for some nefarious scheme, not here. Not here, not now. Memories came, unbidden, to him of his father's face and voice, of the cold ferocity of his voice. Nothing was okay now, how could it be? And like usual he had to fix it on his own, even though he had no idea where to start, even though tears threatened to overflow every other second, even though he couldn’t eat because he was so anxious. He swallowed down his fear and picked back up the book taking care to read every word to block out his own thoughts.
Some of Draco's anxiety was released, so far so good.
Pansy was playing with them, she’d raised her voice just enough so that the pair could hear. Draco quirked his brow and moved back to his original seat so that his back was to granger and Weasley. He knew this game well and was happy to play at it. He just had to wait until the weasel's nasty curiosity brought him over for a listen in to Draco’s “evil plan”. He looked around the room and caught Potter's eyes. He looked confused and suspicious. Draco didn’t justify that with a real emotion he simply quirked his brow at him then turned back to Pansey and the performance knowing full well that now he held each member of the golden trio's attention.
“Me?? I’m the problem? Last time I checked I’m not the one who just shoved my son's soul into the middle of a killing spell! Last time I checked I'm not the one trying to kill someone not part of the war! Last time I checked I DIDN’T ENDANGER MY SONS LIFE FOR A--” a sharp slap interrupted his last sentence knocking him against the brick wall. Malfoy made a strangled noise of anguish. His hearing and vision went hazy. His father's voice continued to follow him through the haze, each sentence punctuated by a slap.

Lucius dismissed this easily. “You have clothes at home and you are carrying all your school stuff. Besides there is no reason to waste time.”
Hermione looked hesitant, “no, not really. But we have to at least consider it.”
Harry sighed, “I would honestly love to have a good answer. It feels like we have all the information but none of the answers. We know he spends every waking second, not in a class, researching. We also know that for whatever reason he’s decided to give up on all of his academics.”
Draco still seemed preoccupied but his response was as courteous as ever. “Here let’s both head in, I'll take you back.” He knew she’d made that jib about the music for his benefit but he was too anxious to focus on something so small and inconsequential in comparison to the inevitable disaster that was to come.
“Who are they?” Draco asked. He wasn’t going to back down on this one, he would know for whom he was dressing, if nothing else.
In the most innocent voice he could muster without completely losing it he said, “My goodness, speak of the devils. We were just saying what a perfect couple you two are. Weasel, I mean, Weasley, in that lovely er,,,antique, and our darling granger in that, hmmm how to describe that ensemble? Gaudy? No. intriguing? Not quite.”
He didn’t insult her by saying thank you. Thank you was just a way to dismiss the significance of her offer. Instead, he simply sighed and placed his head on her shoulder. She placed her hand over his gently.
“I’ll do it,” she said, clenching her hands around her wand. He didn’t thank her, he never did, but she knew he was grateful.
“You,” he rounded on Draco, “YOU! You disgust me. YOU are a useless vile worm not fit to even playact the Malfoy name. How dare you! How dare you openly contradict me?”
“Alright, although I know you’re just trying to shut me up,” Pansy gave him a wry smile. Draco was relieved, she might not be entirely happy with him but he didn’t have to purposefully deceive her or hurt her feelings.
Ron gave voice to Harry’s thoughts, “What do ya mean? The bumpkin obviously ‘as.”
He sighed through his hands which covered his face.
Hermione looked slightly exasperated. For the life of him, Harry didn’t know why though.
They were trying to kill that man. Some man Draco didn't even know. Someone who wasn’t even part of the conflict that he knew of and yet they were using an unforgivable curse on the man. Draco couldn’t seem to catch his breath, his father stared at him coldly for a moment. Draco shook his head a clear ‘no’. Lucius frowned then flicked his wand and suddenly Draco’s magic was being dragged out of him mercilessly. It dragged him back towards the spell. Draco clenched his wand in one hand and the bookshelf behind him in the other hand trying desperately to hang on to this reality and keep his magic from the ritual. Fucking hell, his father was trying to force him into killing a man! His father was forcing his hand into murder of someone he didn’t even know! Draco gritted his teeth and held tight to the present reality. He wasn’t even sure what his plan was, he just knew he wasn’t going to be even partially responsible for this man’s death.
He spent the next couple days trying desperately to dodge detention, get out of having to do magic, keep up his appearance, research, and finish his homework. Things were not going great, and on top of that, the stupid defense against the dark arts teacher thought he couldn’t cast a Patronus because he had made some excuse.
By the end of three days, he had twelve days of detention and no answers. Four of the detentions were given to him by dear Snape. Granted Draco had deserved them, but it was beginning to ruin his reputation as a student. Luckily tomorrow was a Friday so he would get a break from the constant gaze of his teachers. He didn’t know if he could make it another day.
“Look, you have that essay due on Monday? How about we work on that together over the weekend?” Draco didn’t add that he might not be here that long if his father found out about his detention.
Later after the lesson Hermione, Ron, and Harry all sat at a table in the hall eating lunch. Ron was halfway through a sandwich when he started talking.
Draco laid back on his bed and sat considering for a time.
He discreetly moved to her side of the table under the guise of placing his arm around her.
“Why does Malfoy do anything? As far as i can tell he is as likely to be plotting Dumbledore's downfall as his dad is to be a death eater,” Ron shrugged.
“Hermione! I’m quite shocked, I haven’t known you to help us catch Malfoy,” Harry said mockingly.
Pansy sighed, “well let's hope it's the latter then.”
On the bright side, it kept him relatively busy, he tried to stay that way because when he wasn’t thoughts intruded and left him wondering what in the world he was going to do.
Hermione finished hers quickly. He and Ron got within half an inch of the requirement then gave up. Then they sat around on the couch relaxing. The deep red of the couch seemed to flicker in the firelight. The warmth from the fire heated the room and other Gryffindors came and went behind them as they sat in the common area.
Hermione was also fuming but she wasn’t interested in getting in trouble and she guessed that Draco was just playing his own game and she didn’t want to be a part of it. She whispered something in Ron’s ear.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draco nodded mutely, his stomach was still acting strange.
Pansy interrupted his inner snide monologue. “Draco, don’t look now, but I do believe Ms. Beaver's teeth is trying to make an impression on the weasel.”
Hermione shot him a brilliant smile, "Oh we'll see."
It turns out the guests consisted of death eaters. Death eaters Draco had no problems with, in fact some of them were rather kind to him, however these were unusually crass and seemed to jump at anything and everything. They were truly ruffians although Draco guessed they must have something his father wanted or needed. Draco spent most of his time nursing a glass of amber liquid until his father made a cutting remark about slobbish drunks and he set the drink aside. Quite frankly he was miserable, however he hadn’t been yelled at yet so things were going better than they might have. He sat down and watched the party pass only making conversion when necessary.
He took pride in his appearance, whatever else anyone might think about him, his taste was impeccable. The Yule Ball was going splendidly in his opinion. He was wearing a white dress shirt with a white vest over top and some black pants that simultaneously showed nothing and indicated his slender grace. His mom had helped him pick the outfit, and though he generally scorned muggle attire, this particular outfit was inspired by it. He and Pansy had spent the dance quite pleasantly so far. They had danced a couple of times to the classier songs and in between discussed the ins and outs of the social circle their families lived in and which quidditch team was likely to triumph. It was truly an enchanting evening, but best of all dear potter had spent the evening looking positively miserable with Patille desperately trying to get his attention. Potter was too busy watching Cho Chang and Cedric wistfully as they danced. Honestly what an idiot, he probably could have scored anyone but was too focused on his hero complex to actually put his brain to the possible uses of his position. What a waste.
It was like this that Pansy found him about 15 minutes later, he had sent a paper crane to find her. He was just about to give up and walk back to the castle in plain sight when he heard her whisper.
“Yes you do, now be quiet. I will help you after we finish the essays.”
“I only meant I still have to pack,” Draco argued weakly.
“YOU PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND MY CHOICES AS A FATHER??” the side of his head stung, “YOU THINK I DON’T HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE YOU AS I WILL?” Draco tried to protect his head with his hands but didn’t manage it, “YOU ARE A PATHETIC DISGRACE YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THE MALFOY NAME!” it felt like that slap went through his skull “EVEN WHEN YOU WORK AGAINST ME YOU CAN’T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. PATHETIC WASTE OF MY TIME.” His father's voice roared in his ears and with that last sentence instead of a slap he was shoved onto the ground landing hard on his arm which gave a sickening thunk. Draco knew to stay quiet, not to cry out. He cried silently curled on his side cradling his arm with Lucius’ voice echoing in his ears. He heard his father's steps fade away as he left the room. Draco began to cry, his sobs filled up the empty hallways and rooms and yet they still felt empty. Draco felt like he was choking, there was too much pain, his father’s words bounced around his skull and the face of the man he had almost killed, seared into his memory, burned him from the inside out, everything about him felt like an open wound spilling over with tears and the loss of the control he so valued. The loss of the only thing he’d ever had. He couldn’t feel the physical injuries or the tears falling down his face and pooling around him, everything was drowned out by the ache in his chest. Why couldn’t it all just go away. His sobs wracked his body until everything faded to exhaustion.
Screw it. He grabbed his wand and a cloak and left the Slytherin dorms, with his heart racing. He did his best to hide his face, unfortunately, his family's influence did not extend to the dreaded Filch. He walked quickly through the halls keeping his eyes open for any sign of Filch.
“I’m going to what?? Draco, seriously, go to Pomfrey!” Pansy said incredulously as she looked at the swollen arm bruised face and cuts.
Draco looked up and met his father’s gaze with steel, “I will not bring shame to this house, you needn’t worry.” It was strange, he mostly felt scared and his arm was throbbing adding to the ache of his head, but he sounded bitter and defiant.
“Alright all of us that have read the spell will lead and the rest simply cast your magic so that we may shape it. Do all here understand?”
“Hermione, we love you and we know you’re brilliant, now please take pity on those of us with a social life and answer,” Harry said smiling. Lucky for him Hermione seemed more interested in answering the question than in answering the method of his question.
“Malfoy. I was thinking that maybe he was trying--”
“I do not!” Harry protested.
McGonagall looked less than impressed. His grades couldn’t take much of this, or any of this really. He needed to fix this.
The next punch weasel threw he ducked with as much grace as possible given the table but wasn’t paying enough attention to anticipate it when the weasel grabbed Draco's shirt and punched him in the face. Draco's nose started to bleed. His brand new shirt was in those grimy hands. That’s it.
Draco winced hard and gasped. Pansy looked at him worriedly, wondering if he was okay, or at least if he could be. Draco sighed heavily and kept rubbing his arm.
Draco started, “Father…” then he broke off and started laughing which immediately turned into tears again. Pansy, alarmed, awkwardly put her arm around him, wondering what in the world to do.
Hermione dragged Ron off but not before he had muttered, “he always bugs me.” and Draco had responded by thanking harry for preventing the animal cruelty he was about to enact.
Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry guessed she was upset about the name but she only said, “Ron please at least finish eating.”
“Thank you for your time headmaster, we will be off now,” Lucius said curtly.
His father looked around the room then “Begin,” he said quickly, almost rushed but Draco knew that was absurd.
He worked for a couple more hours but by now he had worked through the only books he had. He gave up on the books, he needed a new source of information, perhaps if he had more time he could find a researcher but he didn’t have that kind of time. He was missing something. He ran his hands through his hair and paced around his bed.
“You’re quite right my dear, I was being quite callous, it is the best she could do. Although one wonders why, surely to the weasel is not superior to a beaver, in fact, I think I would be hard-pressed to find a more fitting couple than a stinky weasel and a mudblood beaver,” about halfway through he met potter’s eyes in a lazy challenge and was rewarded with a look of wrath but no action yet.
They walked in silence back to the dorm, they both automatically steered to his bed and sat on it.
His father kept eye contact, "You will not show up to class like this," Draco felt nothing. Of course, because reputation was the important part.
He sat down with less than his usual grace and gave her an eerie smile.
“-sorry,” Draco managed to choke out, he was miserable. She was going to leave now he had to find another plan. Then he felt her sit next to him on the side his arm wasn’t hurt, she wrapped her arm gently around his head and pulled him so he was leaning on her. Draco’s sobs redoubled. He knew he was a snivelly mess.
Draco was back to school the next day. His arm ached a bit and he felt numb, but his main focus was hiding any evidence from anyone that might be looking for it. Last night he’d tried to use his magic but using it had only hurt him. Something must have happened when his father used it. He was worried that if he pushed too hard the magic would come unstuck from him altogether. Draco kept trying to get to the library to find information but every time a teacher would give him a look or one of the Gryffindor crew would be following him a little too closely for comfort, and so he attended all the classes of the day with relative normality. Unfortunately in transfiguration, he had to get himself kicked out in order to avoid using magic but that was easily done. He simply sabotaged the precious Neville’s attempt at a pin by asking him too many questions.
“Sit.” Lucius commanded. Draco sat, trying to figure out why he’d been called home for a dining room talk.
“Hey Draco, I think I’m gonna head back to the dorms. I've had enough sub-par music to last a lifetime,” Pansy said.
Pansy chuckled, “dear me, no need to be unkind, the poor dear obviously did her best.”
He looked around and the fool of a teacher had their back turned facing the snack bar. Looks like it was time for some good old fashioned fisticuffs before the weasel really did attempt to carry through on that threat.
“Hey, ‘mione?” Harry said around his yawn.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ron that’s not confirmed, stick to facts. It’s also entirely possible that Draco had to come home for a family vacation,” she said.
Harry couldn’t imagine the Malfoy family taking any vacation let alone a family one. The thought of them wearing safari shirts and playing in the sand seemed ridiculous, certainly the thought of that family getting tan was. Most likely they sat on the edge of a swamp looking moody and reading ancient human sacrifice tomes.
“Draco?”
One of the days at the library Weasly had grabbed his shoulder and demanded to know what he was up to. Draco had winced and jumped at his touch. He regained his composure quickly (or rather a mask of one, he left to go sit on the bathroom floor shortly after), unfortunately, Hermione had been watching so she had definitely noticed.
He took a look at his schedule. Damn. He was stuck with Transfigurations and Potions that next day, which were rapidly becoming his two worst classes. If he got much more detention his father would have a talk with him. Damn. His heart started racing, he felt suddenly too hot and his collar felt too tight. Why was he so genuinely stupid? Literally, all he had to do was read some stupid books, why was that so fucking hard? His eyes burned with frustration. He threw his things on his bed and went for a walk. He felt unstrung and out of control. Everything was too much. He wished it would all just go away so he could go back to a normal day.
Draco felt his stomach flip but he came to the kitchen door. He found his father standing behind the countertop, and met his cold eyes over his battered arm and spotless kitchen floor. Everything seemed impossibly paradoxical. Surely this wasn't how his father wanted to handle this. They had never been close but this crossed a line. Between using his magic against Draco and hitting him, Lucius had to say something, explain some part that would have a logical root, something to make it even the smallest bit better.
Acting as if he hadn’t timed it so they would overhear, he turned and feigned pleasant surprise at the couple.
Hermione gave them both an incredulous look, “You mean you haven’t noticed?” She raised an eyebrow. Harry rolled his eyes at her superiority complex, though he allowed that it was probably deserved. However, as she had said earlier, lunchtime was running out.
Ginny had left with an early portkey. Harry was still staring at the spot on the floor where she had stood only moments ago. They’d had a fight after she had seen Draco wearing his clothes. He could tell that she was jealous and despite what he’d told her, he had to admit at least to himself that there might be reason for it. They had both agreed on an open relationship during the time she spent at Quidditch camp. Whatever happened in each of their lives while they were separated wouldn’t matter once they were back together again.
They found a small table by the window in a café overlooking the square. Draco had declared that it was his turn to buy Harry a drink. When he came back, balancing a piece of chocolate cake on a platter and two mugs of coffee, it had begun to rain outside. The square suddenly looked dark and dreadful and Draco felt even worse for Harry, who stared somewhat forlornly into his mug.
“I don’t care, I’m calling Master.”
“No, you must leave now.” The house elf agitatedly tried to push Harry back into the flames, completely missing that his cloak and hair almost caught fire.
Potter pressed the handle of his umbrella into Draco’s hand, squeezing it once, the gentle touch lingering slightly longer than would have been normal.
Harry has been at work all day, catching up on the cases he had neglected and writing enough reports to date and file whenever he was ordered to give an account of his activities. After he was done, he’d gone straight back to Draco’s case.
This time it only took a few minutes before Harry drifted off again, encased in a cocoon of warmth and feeling utterly at peace with the world.
Draco looked at him questioningly, as if he wanted to say ‘why did we stop?’, when Harry got up to fetch the maps. Harry smiled and pecked Draco on the lips when the look registered with him. He sat beside Draco, so they were touching from foot to shoulder and began to unroll the first map.
Draco’s hand was holding onto Harry’s neck as his thumb caressed Harry’s cheek. Draco’s fingers skated over Harry’s skin with feathery touches and ended up tangled in Harry’s hair as Draco kissed him passionately. Harry revelled in the feeling of those fingers on his scalp, moaning softly into the kiss, as he gave himself over to Draco’s ministrations completely.
Draco bit down the words that wanted to escape him and would get him, if not hexed, into even more trouble, Azkaban-kind of trouble. He knelt beside the pair of muddy boots he’d been reaching for and vigorously applied the toothbrush. Behind him, Weasley sat on one of the benches that stretched along the middle of the room from one end to another. He could make out the sound of someone approaching the locker room, but didn’t look up from his task when whoever it was turned into the room.
Draco wrapped himself in Harry’s dressing gown, since many of his clothes and possessions were still at Malfoy Manor. He pressed the soft fabric to his face and inhaled the scent clinging to it.
As much as Harry had thought he would enjoy seeing a flustered and distressed Malfoy, he really didn’t. Malfoy seemed almost vulnerable, his arms protectively crossed against his chest and hugging his sides. His eyes were darting around the room as if he expected something horrible to jump out of the shadows any minute. It really wasn’t funny at all.
“Come on then, let’s go now so you can still berate me.”
“Then, do you think… would you prefer to go home?” Harry asked sounding resigned. “You—… I mean, we could do this another time if you prefer.”
It was no secret that Draco was gay – everyone knew, or so he assumed. He’d never even tried to keep it hidden. What would be the point of that really?
“Look Draco, I think I found another one!” Harry shouted from behind an unidentified shrubbery. Mrs. Black it would appear had had quite the extensive rose garden, before she died. Without anyone to care for it, nature had reclaimed the meticulously neat flowerbeds and turned the garden into a jungle.
“I already told you, they are average size! Alright, watch.” It was a command.
“It would appear so.”
Draco’s voice was soft, almost inaudible as he replied.
Draco slowly pulled out, his hands clinging to Harry’s hips hard enough to bruise, before slamming back in, setting a less than gentle pace.
make mistakes, how
“I love you. I’ve tried not to, Merlin knows I’ve tried, but I do, I love you.”
He opened his eyes to a bright and bleary world, blinking rapidly a few times waiting for it to come back into focus.
Ginny had made him take the afternoon off and meet her for coffee in Diagon Alley. They were planning another dinner party to celebrate finally finishing the redecoration of Grimmauld Place and Harry had always got involved before. If he was honest with himself his interest in domestic affairs was already waning, but he would never tell anyone. Life with Ginny had turned out to be much more exciting than he could have hoped for, but just like with so many things, some were more exciting than others.
“Mr Potter, you must leave. Master, Mr Potter won’t leave.” The elf shut its mouth, its eyes growing large in horror, as it realised what it had revealed. “You tricked me! I will go iron my ears immediately, I betrayed Master.”
“Open your eyes! I want you to see what a pretty picture you make, shaking with need, waiting for what I am going to do to you next.” Harry’s low commanding voice let shivers run up and down his spine and unable to disobey, he opened his eyes, taking in his appearance. His hair was a complete mess, his pupils were blown wide with lust and his lips were puffy and wet with their shared saliva. His tongue darted out to taste it once more, causing Harry to moan at the sight.
“This is isn’t a good time. I am having friends over. If there’s nothing else.” He made to close the door but was stopped short by Draco insinuating his foot between door and frame.
Despite their bantering, it’s still awkward for them and they keep their backs turned as they both strip down to their boxers. Draco had let go of his hand when they had entered the room and while his eyebrows are still scrunched, it seems like the pain has returned to a level that Draco is used to coping with.
He was scared. What if the memory itself would overpower him and he would forget everything again. Harry remembered the acute loneliness he had felt, when he had lost his sense of self, the total isolation even now crushing his heart. Draco was the last person he remembered speaking to before the dream had begun. Maybe he knew what had happened and how Harry had come back to Grimmauld Place.
“Granger, would you be so kind as to explain what is going on?”
Harry wonders whether she is implying that Draco is suicidal, or maybe it has something to do with why Harry wasn’t allowed to see whom Luna had spent her day with until he showed up. He grinds his teeth to calm himself as jealousy once again grips him.
“Fuck!” he uttered.
Draco reached for him then. Harry could feel Draco’s hands gently tracing his arms, and chest. They were still lying on their sides, their position slightly awkward but neither seemed willing to move if it involved breaking their kiss.
Draco reached up to the glass above him and managed to clean a small circle of it. Outside, he could see the stars. Night must have fallen while he was unconscious. He had to get back downstairs, his mother would be worried. After one last look at the crates and books, he turned away.
Ignoring what he’d been told, Draco went to his room, took a quick shower, changed into his pyjamas and threw himself onto his bed. He promised himself that he wouldn’t cry. Not over Potter, not over how lonely he was, but before he knew it, he broke the promise he’d just made.
“I see you are still pretending to be a lesbian!” Draco finally said, indicating her dark trouser suit that showcased her beautiful legs to their best advantage.
“The woman who you are seeing behind my back. The woman who is the reason you get home later and later every day. Don’t tell me it’s because you put in extra hours at work, we both know that to be a lie.” Her voice was accusing and her eyes sparkled with rage.
Draco knows that as long as he follows the light and manages to keep up with it, he will be safe. The darkness will be unable to catch up with him. The corridor becomes brighter in front of him and Draco runs after it. A being of pure light must be what is guiding his way and he vows that this time he won’t let himself fall behind.
Draco looks around himself looking for evidence of what happened last night. There is no sign of any disturbance. Where is Harry? The shock of realisation wakes him fully. It has been nothing but a dream. Nothing but one of the innumerable dreams he has had since Harry, no Potter, he reminds himself, has saved him from the Fiendfyre.
“Bullshit!” She interrupts again. “Saying sorry is never complicated, especially if you know you’re wrong. You’re just afraid that he won’t forgive you and frankly I don’t see why he should, after everything. Doesn’t mean you shouldn’t apologise though.”
Draco slung his arm around Harry’s waist to keep him from slipping to the floor.
Trying not show how nervous he was, Draco sped up his steps and hurried home now and again casting furtive glances over his shoulder trying to make out whether the stranger was following.
“Merlin, smooth as a baby’s backside,” she said admiringly.
“What’s so funny
“So you don’t want to marry me?” Harry asked in a small voice.
Draco awoke when a warm body snuggled closer to his. A private smile stole across his features before he turned around in the embrace, facing the man pressed against him. He reached out and gently traced the line of Potter’s jaw, careful not to wake the other man. Potter was going to leave soon enough; it didn’t do to dwell on what would happen next, the present was the only thing that mattered.
“Harry, please! Please don’t do this to me. I can’t be without you, I think of you every day and I miss you so much I hurt.”
“I don’t think we should use magic in here, it doesn’t seem to be safe.” Harry says, worry evident in his voice, eyeing the slowly darkening shadows.
Harry felt like he was drifting up from the bottom of a deep ocean. He was back in his therapist’s office. She sat beside him and smiled, already removing her wand from his temple from where she had woken him.
“All right, all right! You are too curious for your own good!” Draco said teasingly, easily falling back into their regular banter.
In cave about the size of Atrium at the Ministry, all the villagers sat in a circle around a larger raised stone slab. On the ancient altar lay an immobile figure. Wrapped around it was a creature that seemed taken from someone’s nightmare. It had an elongated upward twisting body like a scorpion with eight spidery legs. It also had a birdlike beak and sharp claws and then there was a plethora of tentacles growing from what must be the creature’s chest. They were wrapped around the figure on the stone and it took Draco a moment to realise that figure was Harry.
“Yes, although I am not sure she’ll still think that. If Father dies of apoplexy after seeing the two of us together.”
The part of him that was still trapped in that horrible moment in the shop where Harry had taken Draco’s heart so freely given and crushed it, hadn’t cared. That part would throw itself at Harry’s feet, begging for another chance, begging to be let back into his life.
He got dressed in silence. Harry averted his gaze to give Malfoy a modicum of privacy. He could feel the blush on his skin, when he remembered how much he had already seen of Malfoy the night before. This wasn’t good. Someone cleared their throat in front of Harry and startled him.
Percy makes a note of that. “No children?” he asks.
“Ginny!” Harry’s voice, in stark contrast to hers, was dangerously quiet, almost threatening.
“What? Kneazle got your tongue?” he asked again, looking slightly disappointed. “Was so hoping you’d buy me a drink, the last guy to buy me one was really very very ugly, but what’s a girl to do.”
The room looked like he remembered, only now it was cast with an unearthly eerie glow seeping from one of the boxes stood between the books. The light revealed a storm lantern that Draco had missed the last time he was here and it was but the work of a moment for him to light it. The warm golden shimmer that shone forth immediately helped to make the room less creepy. It now merely looked old; homely, but not like it was full of dark secrets. Draco felt like an archaeologist excavating an important find. As he was soon to find out, he wasn’t wrong about that.
Draco could hear them talking as he approached.
“Actually...”
“I just... maybe you’d feel less vulnerable...”
“Don’t think you are getting out of this that easily!” Draco said his breath hitching as Harry’s hand stroked up and down his arms soothingly. His eyelids fluttered shut as the sensation of Harry’s fingernails raking along his arms overwhelmed him.
“I-, what?” Malfoy looked less scared now and more confused.
He told himself that it didn’t hurt, and for a little while he almost believed it, until he remember the look of disgust on Harry’s face as he wiped his hands. Harry had behaved as if Draco had some highly contagious disease he might catch by touching him. Was Draco so repulsive to him that Harry couldn’t even bear to touch him?
Satisfied with his toast, he raised the phial once more and then downed its entire contents in one smooth gulp.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Draco has come to stop beside a window and while it has been daylight only a moment ago the square beyond is now cast into darkness, lit by dozens of street lanterns, their glow green and cool. Draco can’t make out the people on the square, but he knows they have turned into something horrible, something scary.
Potter sat down beside him then. He reached out and laid a gentle hand on Draco’s shoulder. The man’s intense gaze was focused on him and Draco couldn’t have looked away if he’d tried.
It only took him a few minutes to get back to the observatory, armed with a conjured Muggle torch and his wand. The crack in the wall was still right there. He didn’t know why the Aurors couldn’t see it. Draco shone the torch on the crack, but the light didn’t seem to be able to penetrate the darkness. When he got closer and reached forward to shine the light into the secret room, the hair on the back of his hand slowly stood on end as if he had been exposed to an electrostatic charge.
It takes several hours for Harry to free Draco from the curse and by the end of it they are both exhausted. Harry runs his fingers over every bit of cursed skin and only stops when everything that was cursed has become scar tissue.
Potter was standing in front of Draco’s desk now, obviously expecting an answer. He was bending over it, while supporting his weight on his knuckles, like some ape-man. The comparison made Draco smile.
Harry surrendered himself completely to Draco’s savage thrusts. He was sure he was leaving scratches and bruises all over Draco’s back, but he’d never felt more alive, never this out of control and never so much like his true self. There was no discord in his mind, there was just room for him and Draco in this very moment. This absence of guilt, shame and worry was liberating and with every one of Draco’s thrusts he met, he let himself go a little more, letting the freedom of his position wash over him.
Later after they had found all of Malfoy’s clothes and had shared a phial of hangover potion they sat in Harry’s living room and for the first time that Harry could remember they actually talked. They were trading the occasional barb of course, but it seemed to be in a much kinder spirit, more to amuse and gently mock rather than to insult and upset. Harry found that much to his surprise he was actually enjoying himself.
Harry had revisited his opinion on how badly off he was fairly often, he had kept adding expletives to describes just how much things weren’t going his way but had eventually given up, because just when he thought he was finally getting some results, something else would happen and he would be back at step one. Nothing he came up with seemed to work and to make matters worse, Draco seemed to be pulling away from him.
The slapping sound of footsteps moved further and further away from him. Then suddenly there were hands on him, hands that were gentle and reassuring, still he shrank away.
“Oh really now? I’d always thought it physically impossible for noble and honest Gryffindors to lie. Next you are going to tell me there is no Santa Claus.” Draco replied with mock outrage, his voice sounding breathy, attempting but failing to hold the eager man at bay.
Draco’s left hand joined his right, gently cradling Harry’s face between his palms. He pressed his forehead against Harry’s before he spoke again.
Dawn was already tinting the sky a soft orange by the time they touched down in front of Grimmauld Place. Their faces were red from the wind and their spirits still high with exhilaration. Harry waited till Draco had got off the broom, and then grabbed it with one hand, taking Draco’s in his other and leading him back into the house. After Harry unceremoniously dumped his Firebolt into a corner of the kitchen, Draco let himself be lead into his room.
“I’ll be right there.”
“Draco, I…” Potter began, but Draco wouldn’t have any of it.
“I know you didn’t.”
“That was…”
He was watching the tumult through a dusty shop window. A couple of Aurors were questioning the assembled crowd as to what the ruckus was all about. Everyone seemed to be saying that they had just crowded around to see what all the fuss had been about and behind those people the reporters were scanning the crowd, probably to try and find out where he had disappeared to.
“Fine.”
“It’s going well, thank you. How about you, how is your life as
When Albus arrives he is full of joy and laughter and so is Margy who keeps poking her head into the conversation, talking about how awesome the dungeons and the new underwater windows are and that she can probably see Merpeople from her bed. Harry smiles and cheers them on, while still worried about what is going to happen.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
He had planned for every eventuality and come up with a solution to make Draco take the parcel, or so he’d thought until Pansy Parkinson of all people opened the door.
A small thought rears its head. No, surely not… But the thought is insistent and despite how many things can go wrong with this, he follows its lead. He takes off his soaking wet clothes, until all he is wearing are his pants. He uncovers Potter and strips him of his clothes, before climbing into the bed with him, covering them both up again and wrapping himself around the freezing man.
“The look on your face when you didn’t know what was going on with your glasses was priceless.”
It wasn’t even that his hair had fallen out, it had just gone, which was somehow even more unnerving. If he had at least had to brush it off the floor it might have made more sense. And don’t get him started on Harry’s fondness for teaching Draco to do things “the Muggle way”. Who the fuck even came up with “Muggle Mondays” and used that shit unironically? Harry Potter apparently and for some reason Draco didn’t have the heart to tell him ‘no’. Draco not saying no to the things he hated, like hand-washing dishes, like spending time with Harry’s friends – some of whom still resented him for besmirching their immaculate saviour – and moments like these, when wearing a scratchy, vomit-coloured, hand-knitted hat that smelled funny, were still better than telling Harry “no”.
“Alright, lead the way.”
Draco slowly turned the small phial in his hand, staring at his distorted upside down reflection in the dark glass. He knew his face was drawn, his eyes pools of hollow darkness, his complexion too pale and yet he couldn’t avert his eyes. The image seemed to move, become stranger and more twisted with every turn of the phial. Part of him believed what he saw in the cold glass was the reflection of his soul.
Unexpected rage directed at Ginny surged up inside of him. If she only knew! It wasn’t Draco’s fault, none of it was. It was all Harry’s doing, he was the depraved one, the one that should be punished for his misdeeds. Malfoy was only a victim and deserved to be saved from all this.
Malfoy turned around and looked at him in shock at hearing his first name from Harry.
Despite what he now remembered, he didn’t know what to make of it. He didn’t know whether to be happy at Harry’s declaration of love or sad because he had chosen to remove that very thing from his memory. He was brought out of his reverie when the message still in the bottle slowly slid out of its tight neck and unscrolled itself on the desk in front of him. It was a letter addressed to him by Harry. The parchment felt brittle and strange under his fingers, which was probably due to the insane amount of wards and safeguards charmed to the paper. Draco got the distinct impression that he would be the only one beside Harry to ever be able to read what it said.
The irony of having the very words he’d uttered towards the person that had somehow become the centre of his existence in the last year, addressed to him by the person who was the reason those words had to be uttered in the first place wasn’t lost on Harry.
It wasn’t long before soft breathing was the only sound heard in the room as the first rays of yellow sunlight carefully felt their way around the room, finally coming to rest on two figures half covered by blankets, holding each other in a tender embrace.
It really hurt. He knew he was lucky that he hadn’t cut any tendons, but with his luck recently, he probably had infected himself with some rare disease. He had had enough of research and adventures for one day and viciously kicked against the desk. A sharp pain shot through his foot, causing him to heavily lean onto the desktop trying to keep his balance, while he desperately hoped that he hadn’t just broken his toe.
Harry’s hand had landed on Draco’s while he spoke, they became aware of it at the same time and Harry pulled it away as if he had been burnt.
“Oh please, it’s not like we haven’t known each other for seven years, Malfoy.”
“You’re what Hermione would call a therapist, right?”
“So,” Potter said before strangely enough grabbing Draco’s elbow and turning him back to the sculpture Draco had admired earlier, “what is it about this piece that got your attention?”
“Don’t think I’ll let this go, Malfoy. I’ll find out what you are up to.”
“Exactly!” Draco replied disillusioned enough with his family’s antics to agree, while still pretending to claim the higher ground.
Furious with himself for how shaky his voice sounded Draco replied: “I am sure you’d like that Weasley, but I am really not into that, especially with poverty stricken red-haired wankers like yourself.” He tried to free himself to no avail. “Now let go of my hands!”
“Well, we’d better…” Harry began to say and Draco only nodded, hoping that Harry was implying they go home. Neither of them seemed pleased with it, but they seemed to have run out of words again.
“Nothing, although I’m starting to wonder whether you simply really don’t like me and that’s why you’re trying to get rid of me.”
The weather had been mild and beautiful for days, and Harry would have loved to spend yet another evening at the Burrow with Ginny and his family. If it hadn’t been for the ministry event that evening that’s where he would be right now, sitting on a blanket in the garden, listening to the wind in the fields around them and watching the bats chase insects through the slowly darkening sky. He would caress Ginny’s hair while her head lay in his lap, whispering sweet nothings, while she pointed out their favourite made up constellations.
“What in Merlin’s name is going on here?” Harry asks.
“Ugh, what’s this?” he asked.
“Thank you, Mother. Send my regards to Mrs. Parkinson.”
“I don’t want to be your friend Harry,” Draco heard himself say. At this, Harry tried to get up and leave but Draco would have none of it. Using more force than strictly necessary, he kept Harry pinned to his side. “You didn’t let me finish, now listen! I don’t want to be your friend; I want to be something more. Friendship never really worked for us, did it?”
“Thank you, Potter,” Malfoy replied and for the first time in his life Harry’s name didn’t sound like an insult coming from him. Malfoy was fidgeting, his eyes darting around the room again. When they alighted on his clothes, he got up and set down his cold untouched coffee.
“Do you know what happened during the accident?” His voice catches on the last word and he sounds like an old man. Clearing his throat doesn’t seem to help.
“Merlin, Draco. You’re addictive. Do you know that?”
Harry leant in, to place a soft kiss on Draco’s cheek and then pressed his face into Draco’s cheek. The umbrella’s handle was digging painfully into Draco’s chest, but the gentle touch of Harry’s face against his was far too precious for him to move away. He could feel Harry’s free arm wrap around him, entangling his fingers in the hair at the back of Draco’s head, gently increasing the pressure of his cheek against Draco’s and holding him there. Unbeknownst to Draco his arms had snaked around Harry’s midriff and were crushing the other man and his arm that was still clutching the umbrella to his body.
“Come on now sleepy head, wake up.”
“No, Draco.” She walked up to him and gently rested her hand on his shoulder, she bent down and kissed his cheek, before whispering in his ear. “I’m asking you to listen to what he has to say. Alright?”
Once in his bedroom, Harry helped Malfoy lie down on the bed, took off his shoes and coat and then helped him move upwards until Harry could cover him with the blanket. Malfoy fell asleep mere moments after his head had hit the pillow. Harry sat down on the edge of the bed and allowed himself to look at Malfoy’s sleeping form. His face was relaxed, his mouth slightly open and the creases between his eyebrows that made him look slightly worried had smoothed in sleep. He looked so vulnerable that Harry could feel his heart tighten in his chest. However anyone could have wanted to harm this man how he ever had wanted to now seemed unfathomable to him.
he thought again, barely able to keep from breaking down in front of his oldest friend.
“How did you…?”
“I am afraid that’s quite impossible.”
“But Harry.”
He can hear Draco’s pants and feel his breath graze his cheeks and with every powerful thrust Harry feels more and more alive. He comes with a curse and would have slumped forward but for Draco holding him up. Unlike in the past, Draco’s completely silent as he climaxes. Draco pulls out much too soon, putting an unwelcome distance between them.
“I’m not perfect, okay? You of all people should know, Harry said, his eyes flickering to Draco’s chest. “Merlin, you’re so infuriating sometimes. You drive me crazy, do you know that?”
“See Potter, I know who I am, I know where I came from and I know what I headed toward. Being evil – as ridiculous as it may sound – is easy. You don’t need to question your actions; you don’t need to live up to expectations because people just don’t have any. All they expect from you is to be evil so they have a whipping boy should your side lose. Well, my side lost and all I need to be is a scapegoat.” Draco swallowed audibly but forced himself to continue speaking. “I’ve always known what would happen to me, if we lost and I’ve never thought past that. Either we’d win and my life as I knew it would be over, or we’d lose and I’d get punished for my sins. There’s never been room for anything else.”
Her behaviour towards him had grown increasingly cold over the years and who was he to blame her? She’d said that there was something seriously wrong with him and that they should get therapy to work things out, but he had refused. Not because he thought he didn’t need it, but because deep down he’d known that what had broken between them couldn’t be fixed through talking or anything else.
Draco signed the papers where he was supposed to, nodded when it seemed appropriate and then collected his things when he was told to. It was on the way out that he barely managed to avoid bumping into a small, slender woman that was coming out of a patient’s room, her arms full of cushions, the stack so high that Draco was unable to make out her face.
“Let me rephrase that: Are
Panicking Harry’s mouth spilled forth a jumbled mess of words that somehow revolved around Grimmauld Place and him needing to have a look at the plans. He was so busy berating himself for the bullshit his excited mind had come up with that he didn’t even hear what Draco said in reply. When the man started to walk towards the shelves behind his desk, Harry followed him, like it was the most natural thing in the world.
Draco freed himself from Potter’s grip and turned on him.
“Do I look like I care? You owe me.”
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
He was aware that they were all just highly-strung at the moment and nobody really knew how to deal with their trauma after the war. So instead Draco slowly lowered his arms and began massaging his bruised and chafed wrists, shooting Potter an accusing glare, before remembering the role he was supposed to be playing. He cast his eyes down again and mumbled something.
“You heard me, you umbrella fiend.”
“So you found all that you did with copies of copies?”
“Harry, wait,” Draco called, but it was too late, Harry’s head had already vanished from the fire and he was speaking to empty air. Draco still remembered how curious he had been about the letter, when Sophia had arrived. How could he have forgotten all about it?
Carefully re-attaching the letter to the waiting owls leg, he cast a quick spell that made red letters blossom on the parchment, gave the owl another treat and opened the window to let it be on its way. He watched it disappear into the pale morning sky and wondered how many times he would have to cast that spell, before the sender finally got the message: “delivery declined!”
Outside the only illumination came from a sickly moon that was mostly hidden behind the dense cloud cover. Harry stopped and turned around, a thin sliver of light leading from the tip of his shoes back to the pub. He watched his breath rise up into the air in white puffs as he waited.
Harry’s boots were warm and comfortable, he enjoyed walking along the cliffs, glancing down at the shore below, wondering whether any of the driftwood he could see was from some old ship that hadn’t been able to navigate despite the lighthouse. The sea was rough promising cliffs and other dangers beneath its surface. The view gave him pause and he unfolded the map he had taken with him. The island depicted on the map should have been directly in front of him, he had certainly walked far enough by now. Even if the scale was completely off, which Harry decided it really couldn’t have been, he should have been able to see it. Maybe the island had been worn down by the elements. It must have been made of chalk like the rest of the white cliffs.
“Eye-catching?” Pansy offered innocently with only a hint of mirth on her face. She was brilliantly fun, he would have to congratulate her later.
This chapter is a tad fluffier, and as promised the second chapter in one day!(not super impressive but i take what i can get) Thanks for reading!
He was jarred from his thoughts when he felt pansy place a gentle hand on his shoulder. She looked worried and scared. Draco turned away, he knew he was covered in bruises.
The headmaster opened the door and welcomed Draco, gesturing to one of the chairs. Lucius stood by the window, his hand on the back of the chair in front of him, his face impassive and unreadable. Draco summoned all his resolve and nodded.
Harry responded unusually calmly, “I heard him. Hermione, go enjoy the party with Ron. He won’t bug you anymore.”
Harry thought for a moment.
"You will not speak of this." Lucius's mask of cold emotion had returned replacing his rage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pansy turned to him. “Look if you would prefer to keep it to yourself I understand, but I won’t pretend I’m too stupid to notice when my best friend is too stressed to function and definitely hiding something, you don't pay me enough for that. So what’s up? I’ve never known you to care about what the headmaster says.”
side note: exam week is done! i did it and i got okay grades!
“‘Mione, leave off, I don't have enough time to both eat and talk at different times,” Ron answered.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco had gone back to his room and bandaged his hand. It hurt, but a lot less than the thought of being exposed or thrown out of Hogwarts. He paced up and down his room, then he promptly sat down on his bed and put his head in his hands, blowing out a breath. He was running out of time before once again he had no control. He had to do something, he couldn’t let his father take control and he wouldn’t be thrown out of Hogwarts for this, and yet if he didn’t come up with answers one or the other would happen soon. A pair of feet entered his line of sight and he straightened up immediately.
Ron threw his arm around her, “so what is this brilliant plan, love?”
Draco swallowed and gave a shaky nod. He wiped at his eyes although he hadn’t stopped crying. She handed him the cloak and pretended not to watch him struggle to put it on with one arm.
again, protect mental health etc.
Angst and some plot development lol
I'm trying out this new format? I think it's easier to read than the first couple of chapters.
Harry was confused. They had all seen Draco do both of those things.
“Consider it considered! He’s a git, he’s planning something, done considering,” Ron answered.
Dumbledore continued, “you will of course be expected to keep up with your school work and catch up on the classes you will miss. But other than that I think you’re all set.”
There was a chorus of assent and they all took out their wands. Draco had no clue what was going on but he knew enough to follow suit. It seems he was not among the chosen few who got to be in on the plan. The room was dim and flickering candlelight made everyone's face unreadable. They sat themselves around the symbols, there were four symbols and roughly four people sat around each of them cross legged.
“Hello father,” Draco said tonelessly.
As always i'm open to new ideas, and thank you for reading. The next chapters are better and i'll update more frequently.
“So,” he said around a sandwich, “whatdoya think Malfuck is up to?”
She shook off the hurt face quickly and a sad look replaced it.
“No, not really,” Hermione said.
no trigger warnings, pretty chill
Draco just kept crying harder.
He walked past the door of the kitchen heading for the hall where his shoes were. His father's voice from the kitchen stopped him.
From what Draco could tell the look in his father’s eyes was calculating and dangerous, but. Then the moment was gone, his father nodded curtly and turned back to what he was working on. Draco was obviously not worth intimidating. Draco’s arm was killing him so before he collapsed and killed his last shred of dignity, and passed out in front of his father, he left the doorway and sat down by the front door near his shoes. Then he put on shoes and apparated to just outside the bubble that Hogwarts inhabited.
“Have fun!” Dumbledore's voice made its way down the stairs outside the office. Trust Dumbledore to completely misread and misinterpret every situation. Lucius grimaced and picked up the pace.
She rolled her eyes, “well you’re the one who knows him the best--”
Pansy started softly this time, “What happened? What happened to you Draco?”
“Who?-” Ron asked, looking confused.
Draco sighed with exasperation, he was so out of his depth here. He was either too cold and distant or having a breakdown.
“Draco, I know you can’t tell me everything, or maybe anyone else either,” ah, so it was odd, “but you can only keep this up for so long, so please find someone who can help you with part of it. I will be here, and I will cover up whatever I can for you, and listen to whatever you want to tell me, but I suspect you’re leaving things out.”
Draco blinked, “We’re leaving now?” He had not expected that, maybe in a few hours, maybe some time to pack or gather his wits.
“I'm simply interested to find out what research holds Draco’s attention,” Hermione said. She finished packing up her books.
Draco struggled to sit up still shaking. His arm was swollen and purple, his suit was bloody, and his face felt swollen. His ears were ringing. He felt empty and unusual like he was a crumpled version of himself and he was still getting used to it. But there was nothing in him to support this new shape.
“But surely he comes to visit for family news as well.”
“I had a nightmare.”
Luna’s message is cryptic. She is always cryptic, that’s for sure. But today’s message seems specific in a vague way (how can that be?) Normally it would be something like: your lucky person is the man who wears green, or something similar to that.
“Muggle. It’s what we call people with no magic.”
Potter stands up from the chair. He walks to his coat hanging by the door and puts it on. The sound of the doorbell chiming rings around the office when the auror opens the door.
Draco looks out of the window, frowning. A week. He doesn’t know if he is lucky or unlucky, to have a chance to talk with Potter again after his and his mother’s hearings before the Wizengamot.
“I’m also at the scene,” Blaise interrupts from his bed, “But still, how the fuck did potter do that?” He raises his eyebrows and looks at Draco curiously.
“Having a vacation, Potter?”
he doesn’t notice until the second look. It is the first time he sees this blond, pale, young man laughs so brightly. He doesn’t even register that it is Malfoy. Draco fucking Malfoy. Malfoy looks… happier than before. He seems more potent than before (considering that those last two years Harry saw him the other seemed so pale and thin as if he could drop to the ground at any given moment.) and he looks...more confident than before.
“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks”
“What were we talking about before? Right, work. Case. Potion.” Draco gets gloomy a little when his mind returns to this annoying task (but it actually got less annoying the moment he realised who he gets to work with.)
“Mr. Malfoy! Who said you can leave the bed!” Madame Pomfrey opens the door before he can even put his feet on the ground. She quickly takes long steps to them. Her hands are on her hips, face not pleased. “And you, Mr. Potter, please do something about your hair. Why does it look like that? I know both of you are not in serious condition but stay here for now. Professor McGonagall is coming, so don’t move.” She quickly says what’s in her mind like she doesn’t need to breathe, and it reminds Draco of one of his house elves who worked there before the war…he wonders how she’s doing now.
“Hey! I think I heard something.”
“I’d bite my own tongue before I behave like those old bastards.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Draco smirks, raising one of his eyebrows playfully. Potter blushes a little, but he covers his awkwardness with a cough, then continues to ask with professionalism.
“I’ll text you the restaurant’s name.”
They’re sharing the same dream the next night. Both of them were standing in the Hogwarts hallway, warm orange light flickered around the room. Young Draco was standing in front of him and Potter was there, looking up, eyes showing defiance.
“NO! Cedric!” Draco hears himself screaming painfully. Although this is not his voice but now Draco is beginning to gather whose voice it is, whose body it is that he currently intrudes into.
world.” Draco spits. He stands up, checking his phone.
Meredith and other ghosts perk up. So this is what the demon prince wants. Alright! Tricking and pranking humans is a piece of cake. It’s what they’re good at. If the prince wants them to trick Potter then oh, Satan, they will do their best.
“Doing research on muggle drugs and potion-making. Yes, I was. Did they drink this or inject themselves with it?” Draco opens the bottle and lightly smells the transparent liquid inside. They are not that different from the bottle of pure water.
“Hi! Welcome back to our channel. I’m Harry Potter and today you might notice that my partner looks a bit different than your favourite redhead. Ron has food poisoning.” The bloke with round glasses nods. His messy black hair waves when he does that — Wait. No, no no, that’s not
“Saving my life?” Draco repeats instead and saves the talking back later when he understands what’s happening.
“Listen, I can’t explain it, you’ll have to trust me.”
“Oh.” Potter lets go when he heard that. “My bad. I panicked. Something, no,
Draco smirks. For them it is uncanny and scary, for Draco it is what he’s used to. He feels right at home. For a minute Draco just stands there, taking his time.
“I don’t think we’re sharing the same dream.” Draco tilts his head. “I dream about Cedric.”
When he notices that Draco is staring, he smiles a little and says,
“Why? Was that politician one of the uncorrupt ones in our history!?” The Malfoy bloke gasps, pretending to be shocked.
“No, it is not a joke to me. But what do you want from me? You are saying that magic is real, my estranged family members are trying to kidnap me, and that my mother has lied to me all this time? You want me to believe you, a stranger whom I just know for a mere 20 minutes? Sorry for treating this as a joke or else I would probably have a mental breakdown!”
“Nice office.”
* * *
“What. The. Actual. Fuck.”
“— to be my partner today. Today we’re inside Rosewood house, the infamous townhouse that is believed to be one of the most haunted places in Westminster.”
“Just follow me, Potter, I know the area.” Malfoy clears his throat, taking long steps to the door. “The faster you finish your job, the faster you can bring your ugly mug back to London.”
They still don’t understand what the demon prince is doing but well, it’s not their place to ask, isn’t it?
The world outside the cupboard under the stairs of 4 Privet Drive is a pretty big place. Harry has been living for more than twenty years and sometimes he still wants to bawl his eyes out when he thinks that he finally escaped from that. It was a struggle, with Voldemort and a lot of things happening, but he is free now.
my arse.” Draco quickly looks through the content of the letter then throws the paper to the fire without care. He picks his coffee up and drinks, his mood now soiled. Since the letter was sent to him yesterday (Draco guesses it must be right after him getting out of his office. Robards is sly like that. That prat might have sent it knowing Draco wouldn’t be able to reject it in time.
“A week! That’s seven days.” Pansy grimaces. “Are you sure you’re going to be alright?”
“You don’t look surprised to see me,” Potter says while he lightly puts the teacup on Draco’s desk.
Again, What. The. Fuck.
Then that means ‘one of the officers’ is going to turn up here sooner or later. Draco takes a deep breath, not sure if he can school his expression well when seeing the people from the ministry. Those bastards always sneer at him because of the former Death Eater thing. Of course, Draco sneers back, but it doesn’t mean—
“You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”
“I…I guess I have to be.”
If there were Google for ghosts, they would probably be browsing it so hard right now, checking Wikihow or something. (“
“Well, I mean, last night, you and those death eaters — uh, the nightmare we shared.” Potter scratches his cheek awkwardly. Draco glances at his gloves in Potter’s hands.
And then he continues:
“I don’t know. What’s yours say?”
“When I say jump, you jump, alright?” A stranger says to him with a solemn look. Somehow his ridiculous round frame glasses doesn’t make him look ridiculous at all, which is weird, but maybe because he looks so solemn and the air of the authority around him helps, Draco guesses.
Potter laughs, saying “Luna will absolutely love this place. I also notice a shop selling plants here. I’ll have to tell Neville about it.”
“Yeah, I thought everyone knows that. The Daily Prophet and other editorials always write about my relationships like their lives depend on it. Witches Weekly also does that, putting me in a bachelor list every month or two.”
“Oh, that time.” Draco nods. “You’re unlucky. That was one of the worst ones.” Draco recalls the pain and feelings he felt from last night until now. If those are realistic enough to make him sense this numb feeling, then Potter might feel like dying at the moment. Draco felt like he was going to die when Aunt Bellatrix tortured him in the name of practising love and dark magic.
Imagine the confusion, the doubt, the thoughts that quickly circulate in your mind. Just…imagine it.
“Listen, this is not the time to be joking. What I said about the magic, it’s real.”
“Yeah? Three years in college makes me like this, I guess.”
* * *
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, “Then you came here to work? You’re working? Yeesh, you look like you could use at least ten paid holidays.”
written the letter, and Draco has to look up from the letter to sneer with himself for dramatic purpose.
Draco hopes he will.
If he is not having a mental breakdown over the real-life teleporting, Draco will find Potter pretty rude.
“Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy.” Professor McGonagall opens the door. She slowly walks with a blasé expression which reminds him of a cat. Draco assumes the professor already knows what happened to them. The new Hogwarts Headmistress squints her eyes at them when she arrives at the foot of their beds, judging.
“You know that I can
“It’s not like that. The wizarding world might be in chaos if—”
“You’re living with Longbottom? In Fulham? I thought you live in House Black’s house or with Weasley—”
Draco finds the whole thing lovely.
“I know.” Potter nods tenuously and it reminds Draco of the dream last night. If it were a dream, it would be fine. However, it was a memory, a
He tries to act normal and smile at Pansy when she asks him again whether he’s going to get breakfast at the hall or not. Draco shakes his head, says goodbye to his friends then walks out of his dorm with fatigue. He languidly gets out of the castle, not sure if the numb feeling inside his body is his or Potter’s, but he genuinely wants it to be gone.
. The thing that Potter has to live with for the rest of his life.
There’s a huge gossip going around between the spirits. They said that if a ghost-hunting show starring a human wearing round glasses with messy black hair and a blond demon prince ever visits your haunted place, then go surprise the human as much as you want. You’ll definitely get a reward from Draco Malfoy.
“Hm, I don’t know. I don’t like the terms broken though. It feels like we need fixing. I need no fixing. I’m a Malfoy.” Draco pretends to be fine, even though he knows full well that Potter can feel that it was just an act.
“Like I said, email me or text me.”
“That was six years ago.” Potter interrupts.
Why is he here? Why is he with the human, and Why, Satan, why,
He also stares at the lightning scar that no matter how many times Harry tried to cover it with his fringe, it still shows up and greets the outside world all the time.
“No.” Harry throws himself on the stool next to Malfoy. It is not much better than the plane seat, but he doesn’t notice it since he is busy checking Malfoy out as well. From his blonde hair to his fingertips that are currently tapping his mug lightly.
“If you are not going to sending me back then I’m going back on my own. Good day.”
“Alright. Cheers.”
People are still crapping when Draco throws himself on the ground to the body beside him. That person in Hufflepuff training shirt is lying on the ground, face blank, no sign of life.
“I thought the potion master has to be like—”
“It’s alright. If you want some hipster muggle stuff, you’d like it here. You already have the look for it, I guess.” Draco raises his eyebrow at the auror.
Draco wakes up with a tear-stained face, heart pounding, and drenching in his own sweat.
“Thanks. I didn’t want the old-fashioned potion master vibe, so I tried to match it with the surrounding.” Draco nods towards the scenery outside the window.
. Thank you very much.” Draco sneers. “The only magical thing about me is my hands. I’m good at art and craft, and…”
, he thinks since Malfoy is sitting at the counter seat and he had been giggling with him when Harry entered. Are they, you know, more than friends or something? It’s not like he wants to know or anything but well…
Potter slowly nods before looking around the office, looking for another topic to talk about.
wizard.
“No, he—”
“If you look from outside, this house is not that different from their neighbours but this house, you guys. It has a story. The owner of this house is a popular politician in the seventies. Something weird happened during the time his stay…”
“Come out if you can hear me,” The blond demon grins to the spirits hidden in the dark. They don’t know what to do. Should they go out? If not, would this count as disobeying someone who ranks higher than them? Satan, what is Draco Malfoy thinking? The ghosts panic.
- - -
sign hanging on the door flips itself and now showing
howls for the last time before someone is pulling their body from Cedric’s. Their ears are ringing and cannot hear anything. Everything is blurry from the tears that continue pouring from their eyes.
The American accent that he’s not familiar with throws Harry off for a second or two. It seems like this restaurant’s employee is a good friend of Malfoy.
“Soulbonding Spell?” Pansy asks, getting up from Draco’s bed and leaning on one of the bed pole, her legs stretching to touch Draco’s who sits on the other side of the bed.
If the spirits were not confused and scared of Malfoy out of their damn minds, they would probably lift a corner of their mouth a tad bit because of his exaggerated gesture.
“What world again?”
“Yes, I’m aware, Potter. Since it is on my head and all. Your point?”
“Wait, you’re trying to say my estranged father is in some kind of cult?! And my aunt? What?” Draco throws his hands in the air, sitting beside Potter.
“And you look like you’ve been having a vacation for ten years.” He means Malfoy looks good. Really good. The kind of good that Harry may or may not want to ask him out.
They didn’t shake each other’s hand in that dream. They couldn’t change the past.
“Oh, really? Aren’t you the one who told me to help produce content?” Malfoy complains. He pouts, asking “If you’re that afraid then why do the ghost-hunting show in the first place?”
Harry thinks of Robards’ word… honestly, he doesn’t care about this head auror position. He doesn’t even care about his job. He just doesn’t know what to do with his life and being an auror is the only profession he can think of after doing nothing and trying to gather himself 3 years after the war.
“Congrats on getting to be on the list, Scarhead. Unfortunately, I don’t get to see your mug on the papers since I don’t read wizard papers anymore because they are shit. Well, except the Quibbler. Luna is great at her job.”
“I don’t know. It might be fun, not just pain and sadness.” Potter gets up, dusting off the dirt of his pants before lending his hand to Draco. “Come on Malfoy, I know you don’t want your fancy pants ending up with dirt-stains.”
“Oh, alright.” Malfoy shrugs. “It wasn’t
The blond demon, who is currently a target of the ghosts’ lifeless eyes, turns his face to every direction that he
You think ghosts and spirits are just stories to scare children? Hah! You are wrong. They are real. They are very real, and in fact, they are
.” Potter opens his mouth. He knows which part of his memories about Cedric that was seen. He kept seeing it for many countless nights.
Harry types on his phone and sends it to the group chat that consists of him, Ron, and Hermione. Both texts back as soon as his text was read even though it’s currently midnight in London.
“Woah, calm down. First, I’m a wizard.”
“Let me go. I can’t breathe.” Malfoy lies. He doesn’t really need to breathe but Potter doesn’t know that.
“They drank it. The symptom is a daydreaming-like behaviour, but we also have one frozen wizard who looks like he was cast with the Full Body-Bind Curse. We still have not found a permanent cure for these symptoms.”
Draco made his choice. It’s depended on Potter now whether he will enter Draco’s open door or not.
“One week.”
Draco stops when he sees the lake. He looks around and notices a young man who sits on the ground not far from him. His hair is still dishevelled as much as before (or maybe more dishevelled if that’s possible.) Potter is sitting there, wearing the same hoodies he always wears, his face half-hidden underneath his Gryffindor scarf. Draco walks over there and sits next to him.
He glances around, green eyes looking for the seat that looks the most comfortable. He doesn’t want to sound like a prat, but his arse is absolutely killing him right now. The plane seat was rubbish. Didn’t the auror get any damn budget from the ministry?
That person is Cedric Diggory.
Draco doesn’t know which part that Potter agreed with him. Potter is playing with the hem of his shirt awkwardly and just stands at the door. Draco coughs, waving the auror to his desk.
“Highbury? What the—How? I was just walking to Victoria Station. What’s happening?” Draco moves around to make sure that the GPS is working correctly and that what he sees is true.
“Malfoy! Did you see that flashlight light up!”
Before the door closes, Draco shouts at the top of his lungs, “It’s a date, Potter!”
He thought Potter would have a happy ending after the war. Having a bunch of kids and living in a big house.
Potter splutters, face blushing. However, the auror nods enthusiastically, agreeing. He waves awkwardly like he doesn’t know what to do with his hand then quickly leaves.
As soon as his hand touch the trophy, his body and the other body beside him are sucked into the air. Draco feels nauseous from the abrupt change. This feeling, he’s fairly sure he’s using a portkey, but that is not the only feeling he can perceive; he feels sad, anxious, panic, and pain…
“Let’s just… Don’t let go of my hand, alright? 1 2 3—” The stranger suddenly grabs his hand. Draco’s confused at the sudden coldness touching his hand, but before he can do anything, they both disappear in thin air.
Draco doesn’t like Potter’s attitude, and he decides he has enough.
“Do you want my resume? No, no magic or whatever. My mother brought me up
“And you fell for that? Potter, you’re naïve.” He shakes his head, then calling out to them again, “C’mon you guys. We don’t have all day. Show yourself.”
Draco nods to himself. He frees his hand and grabs his phone from his pants pocket, opening Google Maps.
is lovely. He’s more interesting than Draco first thought. He first entered this entertainment company as a joke between him and other demons but the more he spends time with these humans, the more he wants to stay.
His words don't sound menacing compared to 11-year-old Malfoy’s words when they were at Hogwarts.
In fact, Draco is probably having a mental breakdown right now. It’s a bit upsetting for someone his age to lose temper over stranger’s words like this, but Potter’s been rude for a while now.
Harry thinks that maybe he can’t remember Harry as well when Harry walks through the door or maybe he just doesn’t notice, but after Harry is in the middle of the restaurant and gets closer without realising, Malfoy turns his head and looks at Harry.
The ghosts frown. They don’t understand why the demon prince likes to get involved with this coward human. He even purposefully pulled pranks on the other bloke. Well, he did trick him. Is this a new way to torture human?
“R-Ron…he said it would be interesting.”
“And I’m a graphic designer. Nice to meet you.” Draco sneers. He sarcastically shakes the hand that still holds his own hand. He raises his eyebrow challenging Potter, who doesn’t appreciate his humour and acts offended.
“Old friend, huh, Draco?” A voice breaks out from behind the counter. The owner of the voice is a bloke with shiny long brown hair. He looks like he’s the same age as both of them. The bloke is putting one hand on his hip. The blue apron moves lightly from his movement. He just smiles toothily at both of them, especially at Draco. “Introduce me to him.”
“I know you didn’t ask for this but please bear with it for a week.” Potter sighs. His hand is reaching for the jar and the glass next to the bedside table between their beds before pouring the water into his glass. He drinks the water like he’s going to die of dehydration. Draco licks his dry lips slowly.
“FUCK. NO. Shit!” Potter curses loudly. He jumps from the invisible touch and slides himself to Draco, two arms clutching Malfoy firmly. Malfoy looks down at the arms clinging to his neck and chest. The owner of said arms is spewing nonsense at the moment.
He put his keys in his the other side of his pants’ pocket. The sound of the keys jingling echoes through the hallway. He looked up to nod at one of his old neighbour who is also going out of their resident. Draco smiles back when the other sends a smile his way like he always does.
Draco opens his eyes in the dark. He doesn’t know where he is. He blinks his grey eyes slowly to adjust his sight. He shifts his gaze to look at his feet…he’s currently running right now, panting. But this is not him. Although he can feel the cold air, the pressure rising up from his chest that makes it hard to breathe but this. Is. Not. Him.
However, he thinks it might be better to stop tonight or Potter might faint. He doesn’t want to carry him back to their car. Using a demon’s power is a no go since Draco doesn’t want the cameraman to faint too.
“Is there anybody at the ministry—”
“Yes.”
“Uh, I, just, I’m not used to you using muggle stuff.” Potter coughs, blushing. “You even used emoji.” Potter nods towards Draco’s fingers, and with a small voice, he adds, “Is that an eggplant emoji? You used eggplant emoji? To that muggle?”
“I’m Harry. Harry Potter.”
“No, my mother doesn’t talk about that. She raised me on her own. Why are you speaking like we are in Game of Thrones? Are we in some kind of Game of Thrones drama?”
And Draco takes it.
The source of Draco’s unhappiness turns his head to him, scratching his head awkwardly, which makes his messy hair get messier. Draco sends a cold glare to the other who is lying on the bed next to his.
He unlocks the door when he reaches his office the muggle way, opening it and waves his hand, sending his scarf flying to the coat rack next to the door. The
“You had my nightmare — my past? Which one? I had a lot of death eaters nightmares that I lost count.” Draco jokes but both he and Potter know it wasn’t a lie.
Meredith Cole, one of the ghosts in the Rosewood house, considers for a minute before slowly creeping closer to their ‘guests’. She nods to Malfoy who treats her as if she’s an air (which she is. If you think about it, Meredith is just a soul in the air, no actual body and all that) and then she slowly holds her ice-cold invisible hand close to Potter’s nape and abruptly touches it.
“I dreamt of Bellatrix. When she…tortured you.”
“We don’t have much time. They might be planning something big…” He looks around, worried. Draco blinks. Is he accidentally getting himself into a prank vlog? This is the only likely explanation. He looks around for the camera, but the only thing he sees is the bloke in front of him looking down at his wristwatch with impatient.
“And I am not even a part of it! How can I trust you? This is not a young adult story where the protagonist believes in the stranger’s words and follow them around anywhere. I am not even a protagonist! I’m just a mere 24-year-old graphic designer who’s trying to survive in this shitty world. Your
“We found this in the belongings of a squib in a muggle part of London. We have to work together with the muggle police. They think it was some kind of drug, but we also think it also has some kind of magic properties.” He puts the tiny bottle on Draco’s desk.
However, there is no object that he’s scared to see. No ring. No wedding ring.
“No! Help! They’re ghosts here! I know it!”
“Merlin’s sake, Potter. That was a text from months ago.” Draco rolls his eyes.
“Cauldron blew up? Are you sure this is not Finnigan’s doing?” Pansy tilts her head.
instead. He turns on the light and the wireless before throwing his body on his chair. The smell of hot coffee and the gently sound of muggle’s music makes him feel lively for a second but then his mood shifts when Draco notices a letter on his desk, his brows furrowed at the pretentious, ugly wax seal and the department behind the symbol of the seal.
Seattle is...bigger than he thought. Harry used to secretly read about it on Uncle Vernon’s thrown-away newspaper, or sometimes listened to what the tv said when Aunt Petunia wasn’t noticing that he was ‘slacking off.’
Draco thought he became immune to surprising shits now that he’s getting older, but it seems like he still reacts the same way when it is concerning Potter. He raises one of his eyebrows, slowly taking a peek at Potter’s left hand—the part where he tries so hard not to stare since Potter has stepped inside.
The spirits inside the house stand tall. If they have chests to puff out, they totally would. They are so honoured to be part of this (in)famous Rosewood House. The house is just a 4-floored townhouse, not so big, but not small either. It used to be luxurious, designed with grand furniture and adorned with fancy pictures and prints. Now they are all covered in dust. Nobody lives here anymore…well,
“If you are Draco Malfoy, the only son of Narcissa Malfoy, then you need to listen to me.”
“You already introduced yourself to me back there. I don’t want to know your name, I want to know where the hell we are and how did you even do that? What trick are you using? What channel are you from? Are you one of those dimwit influencers that always doing prank videos just to feel something—”
Potter begins to answer but Draco holds his hand out, saying “You don’t need to answer. I know you are freezing to death. Here.” Draco takes off his gloves and hands them to Potter. He pushed his hands inside his warm coat instead.
“Show yourself, ghosts. Trick me. Tickle me with your itsy-bitsy ghost hands.” Malfoy moves his body and turns to look at the camera, smirking.
“Nice to reacquaint, Potter.” Draco looks directly into the green eyes. The ones that he’s never thought he would be able to have a chance to stare at again. “Put your jacket on the rack and come sit here.” He points to the chair at the other side of his desk before getting up and brewing tea for his old rival.
“I do, and yes, it was quite interesting.”
Who said ghosts aren’t real?
“What?”
The first time he sees
But it’s not like that. Potter’s eyes look sad. They seem like he saw something, even after the war. Something is hidden behind his green’s eyes that Draco doesn’t know what it is.
When the video is posted, almost every comment begs Draco to come back as a co-host because of his nonchalant comments and the chemistry between him and Potter is ‘to die for.’
“I can’t. Malfoy. Take me out of here.”
Potter shrugs. He looks down at his wristwatch again and asks, “Are you done? I am busy trying to save your life here.”
Draco stops in his track. He looks up at Potter. His mother changed her last name to Black long ago, so not many people call her Narcissa Malfoy anymore.
“And what face do you want to see? I’ve lived around muggles for seven years, Potter. I guess I am great at feigning nonchalant to surprising shits now.” Draco thinks of all the weird muggle stuff he has encountered over the years.
“How is it here? I want to come here a few times but haven’t had a chance.”
“Pan, if you continue, I’d kick you out of my bed.” Draco flushes. Blaise laughs lightly so Draco turns his head to the other boy’s direction and sends him a cold glare as well.
“Do we have to experience this for six more days? Me dreaming of your past?”
“How would your good mates act if they know we’re here, licking each other’s wounds.” Draco quirks an eyebrow.
“Broken?”
Draco Malfoy smirks. He stands up and looks at the back of the auror who’s vanishing in thin air a second later.
Meredith and her ghost friends jump happily. She’s starting to get tired of the Rosewood House and she wants to literally move on, going to the after-death or maybe reborn or something.
“No…” Draco answers slowly, processing his thought.
Comparing to the first time he received a letter from Hogwarts, this is like a 180 change. It is a letter from Gawain bloody Robards.
Draco orders a hot latte and a plain bagel. He smiles to the barista with a familiar face. Draco sees this bloke a lot when he becomes this shop’s regular (His first time here was a bit embarrassing because he cannot pronounce
“Good job.” Draco claps. “As a reward, I’ll send message to the reapers and you guys can go to the Great Beyond later if you like.”
“I am well-acquainted with a muggle who’s in law enforcement. I could find some more details without unnecessary paperwork. Oh, but if you have any important details like the locations, other noticeable symptoms, forward it to me directly via email.” Draco grabs his phone and sends a text to said muggle before he forgets. He doesn’t want to contact this bloke without unnecessary because no matter how useful it is, this muggle is quite clingy, but he also wants to get rid of Potter as soon as possible.
If you cannot imagine it, that’s fine. Just ask Draco Malfoy, he would be able to describe those feelings for you: surprised, nervous, confused… and many more.
“I think the current you is quite nice. I, er, I mean, I prefer you than those wizards and witches.”
“So you’re single right now?”
. What a dumb word.) The barista smiles flirtatiously, but Draco pretends like he doesn’t see it. He takes an effort to make small talk and puts the tips in a jar then goes out with his drinks and heavenly-smelled bagel in hands.
. That’s not the figure in the room that makes the ghosts scared. The one they’re so afraid of is there. That Harry Potter bloke is standing next to
Well, to be honest, if it were Finnigan he wouldn’t be this surprised, but this is Potter, Harry Potter, the boy who fucking lived we were talking about. He was the one who could get rid of the Dark Lord and ended the war for merlin's sake. Draco always thought Potter was brighter than this but nope, things have gone wrong because Potter is an absolute wanker. (But what to expect from the bloke who keeps using expelliarmus as if he only knows one spell.)
“Malfoy, you’re wearing a beanie.” Potter blurts out with wide eyes. Draco raises his eyebrows, touching his beanie consciously then he looks at himself from head to toe: Graphic shirt with top buttons undone, muggle jeans and Doc Marten boots. Pansy called it ‘A typical, Hipster Muggle Look.’
Potter stammers and Draco tries not to overthink what the other said.
Of course, it’s Harry Potter. Why not?
touched my neck earlier.”
“‘It’s your choice to close or open the door.’ is what I got.”
“It was probably just your imagination,” Malfoy says before slowly turning himself to Meredith and discreetly gives her a thumb up. “Good job.” He whispers.
Now it’s time for Harry to raise his eyebrows. He tries to think of what to say because that statement alone has opened up many questions that he wants to ask Malfoy, but he settles with, “You’re studying in Muggle’s university?”
“Do I need to include emoji in my message?” Potter grins jokingly.
Everything in front of him turns so bright that he has to close his eyes. Draco hears the
“Cedric!”
Draco nods, opening his top drawer and grabs the notepad. He jots down something quickly as if he’s afraid of forgetting it.
However, the next morning, Harry holds out his hand at the same spot in their dream.
While he’s beginning to panic, his arm reaches to touch some kind of trophy. His other arm is holding someone’s frigid body. He can feel everything, but he cannot control anything, not even his body.
“That soulbonding spell can tell you that much?”
“Here,” Potter hands him a glass of water that he used earlier. He pours more water into the cup. Draco presses his lips together saying, “Do you really think I would drink from the same glass with you, Potter?”
He hums to himself while walking down the street. Maybe today is a great day to order coffee from the shop across the street. He deserves it. He has time to indulge himself in muggles’ fancy drinks (and he will!).
“Right. I may need more pieces of evidence for the case, and if I find something new—”
“Good. Because I hate having to getting in touch with the wizardry world.” Draco smiles darkly.
are living here but it would consider the wrong choice of word to describe them in the same sentence with ‘living’, isn’t it?
And Harry follows.
“Potter was brewing a potion next to me in Potion class but then that git’s cauldron suddenly blew up. I waved my wand the same time as him and then…I passed out.” Draco stretches his legs on Pansy’s lap. She pinches his ankle playfully.
Why? Because Draco Malfoy is experiencing these feelings right now, shit tons of these confusing thoughts per seconds entering his head, he would say.
Draco turns his face to the dark, smirking. He grins at the other ghosts who’s waiting to see what the demon who ranks higher than them would say.
A group of ghosts, spirits, souls without bodies (or whatever you want to call them, they are not picky with labels.) is staring from the dark. Their invisible eyes are glancing from the dark corners in the house. Their gazes are full of fear, looking at the figure in the middle of the room.
“If you want,” Draco answers with a challenging smile. Potter’s dark skin flushed a little. He opens his mouth as if he’s going to say something, but then he closes it again.
- - -
Harry decides to push the door of the first restaurant he sees on the street opened. It’s just 4 in the afternoon, but he’s starving. Muggle plane food was horrible.
“We can do it over lunch. So I can introduce you to the street here. I’m sure you’ll like Dalston.”
“I can come here for that.” Potter interrupts.
“Welcome—” Draco says to his potential customer but his voice cracks at the end. His gazes fixed on the person who just enters who looks as surprised as Draco (or maybe more).
He doesn’t look at what they say after that. Harry just wants to at least send a text to tell someone that he has successfully brought his exhausted 21-year-old ass from London to Seattle (and Ron and Hermione are the only one who cares enough about Harry’s well-being). The young auror puts his phone back in his coat pocket and sighs, stepping on a sidewalk sluggishly.
He tries to channel the old Draco Malfoy from his school years, chin up and all, “Actually I thought the ministry wouldn’t really want to ask me,” He twists his lips, directing a cocky smile at Potter, “But I guess they have no choice. I am an exceptional potion master, and they can’t get rid of my pretty face even if they want to.”
“I know, right?” Draco smiles. “To be honest, that explosion was impressive. If it weren’t me being the arse of the joke I would totally laugh.”
3 years after the war makes Harry tougher, more solemn, but at the same times, it’s also draining him little by little. He looks much older than he should be. And now he’s so self-conscious about how he looks in Malfoy’s eyes that he feels his cheeks flush.
“Fantastic. I’ve never refused when it comes to food.” Potter grins. “That settles it then. See you in three days. Cheers.”
“Good.” Potter nods. “Good.”
“Do we get the same text? How many people does she send it to? Is it randomised or something?”
“I heard from a source that Narcissa doesn’t tell you anything about magic and let you live in the muggle world—”
Seven years since the war and this is what this blunt prat decided to say to his old classmate? Draco decides to also look at Potter thoroughly. Potter is not the only one who has eyes. He looks at The Gryffindor’s dirty boots, his old jeans that have more tears than to be a fashion statement, his dark blue t-shirt and a dark jacket in his hands… The outfit screams Potter the War Hero that he’s seen before on papers (except his body that well… fitter, more muscle on his body than when he was a gangly kid — but this is not what he should scrutinise at the moment, isn’t it?)
“Not really,” Draco stretches then adds, “I don’t really understand but McGonagall said that because of the potion, my magic, and Potter’s magic is binding together simultaneously and turns it into Soulbonding spell. We can’t read each other’s mind, but I can detect his feelings and feel a tad bit of his magic in my body—”
And how did he even know Draco’s name…
“Those were old texts.” Draco doesn’t know why he needs to quickly explain that to Potter (Lie. He actually knows why.) He puts down his phone and continues, “I might be able to find a cure. Maybe in two or three days. Do you want me sending the report or just—”
“Shit! Something is grabbing my wrist.”
“Malfoy! Don’t do that! What if they can hear you!?”
“It seems like some chemical that the muggle seems to know of a lot. I heard you—"
“And…?”
“Like what? Snape? Slughorn? Potter, need I remind you that this is 2019? Do you think that a potion master has to wear a robe, putting a cauldron in the centre of their workplace and still use owls to contact each other? Please, only people at the ministry do that. Tell them to email me next time.”
“Not cold, Potter?”
Draco laughs. “You’re nothing but broken, Potter. You’re a bloody war hero.”
“Alright, alright. But how long is the effect of this spell? Please don’t say forever.”
weird then.”
“You stingy.” The employee complains before saying, “I finally get it though. You do have a type. No wonder…” He smiles knowingly at Malfoy.
“True.” Potter smiles lightly, “Do you subscribe to her daily prediction? I got an interesting text today.”
sound, and then he feels the change from the surrounding even with closed eyelids, so he opens his eyes again, and there’s no crowd lining up for the bus, no stairs to the Tube. In fact, there’s no bus stop at all.
“It says ‘don’t hesitate to go through the door.’ I don’t know what that means.”
“Malfoy, you git. Don’t. You know I am afraid of them!”
A sound of someone opening the door interrupts his thoughts. Draco lowers the volume of the music then looks at the visitor.
“Do you know anything about House Malfoy or House Black?”
So Draco Malfoy, the graphic designer, takes a bus to work, and he leaves dumbfounded Harry Potter, the wizard, alone.
* * *
“Potter.” Draco sighs. “If you think you can use this power to—”
Apart from that messy dark hair, Draco notices Potter still has awkward habits he did in Hogwarts, like the way he walks, or the expression he made when he’s embarrassed.
“Being you is not easy, I guess,” Potter says.
“You prat, that something was my leg and you kicked my shin.” He retorts and kicks Potter’s ankle. “Walk carefully. It’s quite dark here.”
“Brilliant. See you.”
“Potter.”
“Malfoy, is this a joke to you? I am trying here.” Potter sighs. He rubs his hand on his forehead. “Can you be serious for at least 5 minutes.” Potter rolls his eyes.
“Malfoy, I’ve known you for many years? I don’t need that spell to know this kind of thing.”
If Luna said, he’s going to have a reunion today then so be it. Let’s hope it is not someone who wants to kill him. The weather is too good for a sparring today.
Draco Malfoy put his phone back in his pocket and locks his flat’s door before checking the time on his mobile phone. The young wizard smiles to himself. He has more spare time before work than usual.
“But the ministry recommended you. I thought it would be an old bloke wearing a robe, acting like a ministry agent or something.” Potter explains, “Your manner is still kinda the same, though.”
“Well, if it’s not urgent then you can tell me when you come to get a better cure for the victims in three days.”
“What about our contents?” Draco tilts his head, feigning ignorance.
Luna’s message rings in his head. He stares openly at the figure standing at his door.
They made it into the abandoned bathrooms in the castle without too much attention although someone had recognized her, another black mark on her reputation. She almost laughed but then Draco hissed beside her. He was sitting near the sink and taking off his robe.
“I was thinking that maybe he meant to sabotage that divination test we have later this week, ya know the one with the star interpretations? But he wouldn’t need his father to do that with him”
“Hey Draco,” Pansy said.
*does peace sign and vanishes in a puff of smoke*
Draco got his chance to explore the library at the end of the day. At the library, he began to look for books having to do with inhibited magic and the bond between a wizard and their magic. It was honestly rough going, every time he thought he found something it turned out it was about repairing a wand or restoring trust between the wand and a wizard. He sighed and sat down with a stack of books at one of the farthest tables from people. He knew he was in for a long afternoon.
Harry stretched his arms above his head, yawning. They were almost done with their essays and Ron was running to grab snacks.
Harry got comfy in his chair and faced hermione. “To be honest i have no idea-”
“Oh and I suppose you think I owe you an explanation?” Draco said. Hating himself as the hopeful look faded from her face to be replaced by hurt. He watched her closely.
I'll add another chapter today as well to make up for being late and uploading a chapter i might delete.
Lucius made a toast to something which Draco just missed then asked the party to join him in a side room. This piqued Draco’s interest, generally guests were not welcomed into the secret side rooms. His father lit some candles and closed the curtain so that the lights were dim, then he and some of the others began chalking out power symbols. His father gave instructions while remaining aloof.
Harry nodded, “exactly, so i think my only half decent idea left is that he’s trying to get Dumbledore fired.”
“Right gents, time to get to class but we should talk later, I was considering possible ways to discover what Draco is researching,” Hermione said.
Hermione frowned, “well as much as i would hate that, which does make it seem likely, what does the observatory have to do with that? Or for that matter why bring Draco home for two days? And why would any of this make Draco nervous?”
Lucius didn’t bother to reply; he simply nodded then turned back to Dumbledore who had begun to speak.
Draco laughed through his sobs.
Okay, a list, who could he trust not to report back to anyone? Pansy, Blaise, his mother, and Snape. A rather short list, and, in all honesty, most on it were immediately disqualified. Pansy and Blaise wouldn’t know what to do. His mother would involve going home and that was right out unless he wanted a mental breakdown. Then there was Snape, he was unpredictable, true he was close to Draco’s family but he kept his council to himself. Snape was also a teacher and therefore likely to go Dumbledore, which also didn’t quite fit Snape had always been loyal to the old ways, yet he seemed separate and distinct. Draco had spent quite a bit of time with his godfather as a child and he had always been half friendly with him. Draco sighed. Well, what did he have to lose anyway?
He twisted so that his back was against the weasel then before either had a chance to think he drove his elbow hard into Weasley's stomach. With a gasp, he let go of Draco’s shirt. Draco, still angry, wanted to scare Ron a bit so he turned and looked ready to punch him again. Then an arm snaked around his waist and dragged him out of range.
“Huh, i knew something was up, do you have any idea what?” she asked.
“Malfoy? seriously?” Ron asked again.
Draco sighed with relief.
Draco bristled but left and headed to his room to pick an outfit and take a shower.
Harry shoved Draco in the direction of Pansy. Harry’s eyes were stormy, he looked furious and it was hardly contained, but instead of an insult Harry just said, “Dumbledore wants to see you tomorrow after class.”
“We are having guests come over for dinner, they will want to meet you, be ready in an hour.” He still hadn’t looked up from the newspaper.
“Were you even paying attention? That time we had the surprise dementor practice and Draco said he didn’t particularly feel like joining and, although he richly deserved it, Lupin did not give him detention.” Hermione looked down at her timepiece.
“Guys, stop it,” said harry. Looks like wonder-boy had made his debut. Draco could feel the dreadful ruffle on Potter’s shirt against his back. Draco struggled a bit in his grip but couldn’t get free.
Sorry, I haven't updated in ages, commitment is hard. But I promise I will keep updating even if it takes forever! (lol, so good at this!)
3- he would go see snape and snape would help. He didn’t seem to have a risk free option.
“Your father is going to take you back home for a couple days starting today to have some family time,” Dumbledore said, meeting Draco’s eyes tersely.
“Did it work?” Draco asked as she left the room. He could have kicked himself, why try to upset her.
“Harry as much as I hate to agree with the half-eaten sandwich,” Hermione started. Ron flicked the back of Hermione’s head, Hermione continued, “I would really love it if you would hurry it up a bit, we don't have a lot of time.”
Draco wasn’t sure what purpose a lie would serve or even if a lie would work so he told the truth:
Lucius led Draco to a point just outside of the border of Hogwarts then apparated without looking to make sure Draco would follow. Draco took a deep breath, and stealing himself for whatever was waiting, he apparated into the entrance hall. Then he walked to the dining room. His father was reading a newspaper, the picture of uninterested calm. It was as though he had been there all morning. When Draco walked in Lucius didn’t react. Draco waited, standing by the table.
Feel free to leave comments and I'm open to ideas
“Harry, did you even hear what he said??! He said--”  Ron was practically blustering.
“I’m not sure,” he said it carefully as though embarrassed, “my father must be coming to Hogwarts otherwise there is no reason for the headmaster to speak with me.” he took a deep breath here as if stealing himself, “and if he is coming he only has 2 possible reasons. The first is that I have in some grave way dishonored the family and he has come to encourage me to better myself,” the ‘encourage’ felt bitter in his mouth, “ the second is that he has a task or a job.”
A few hours later Draco had a headache from reading, he was exasperated and growing increasingly apprehensive about tomorrow. At least a few hours ago there had been some chance he could find the answers but now he debated what he could do, he had very few options, Pansy wouldn’t know what to do and he didn’t want to scare her, and the library, though lovely, seemed to be useless in regards to this question. There were a couple of other laughable options but nothing concrete, no one he wanted to tell everything to.
Harry glanced over at Malfoy and found himself marveling at the speed with which he wrote. Still, this effort was becoming rare, the past four classes he’d been acting out. This puzzled Harry, yeah sure the guy was a prick but now he was doing something he never did before; jeopardizing his grade simply to piss people off. Harry shook his head and tried to go back to whatever the teacher was saying.
Draco froze the only time Dumbledore wanted to see him was when his father did. He tried to throw on a nonchalant uninterested air of importance. Lucky for Draco his poor attempt at concealment was unnecessary, Potter was too preoccupied to notice his expression. Pansy, however, wasn’t. She frowned but didn’t say anything and Draco was too anxious to notice her looking at him.
“Yes Ron, do keep up, and let Harry finish his sentence,” Hermione said.
They walked quickly down the large airy hallways, they headed for the front entrance in silence. They turned a corner and there was Potter. He stared openly and looked so interested it irked Draco, why couldn’t the prat mind his own business? He threw him a sneer and potter’s expression quickly changed to anger and suspicion. Better, much better. When they passed Draco’s expression returned to being studiously blank. It was tiring holding a lie on your face.
Lucius turned his cold focus on Draco. Draco felt his mistake immediately.
Draco felt like his feet were made of lead as he walked towards Dumbledore's office. Maybe his father was just here to inquire about Potter or perhaps complain about the quiz he had gotten a 4/6 on last week. This was ridiculous. He shook himself and, back straight, knocked on dumbledore’s door.
