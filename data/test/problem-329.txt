Draco shook his head in amazement, “Really something, those muggles. Like,” He nodded at the television and took another bite of pasta. “I can’t believe that’s a thing, and I just. Had no idea. It’s.
Harry had never heard Theodore say it so plainly.
“I’m not!” said Harry. “I’m not used to people calling me really handsome or commenting so favourably on the beard.”
“It’s all right, darling.”
He lived in muggle London in a four room flat that Ginny had politely called ‘surprisingly spacious.’ But it was enough to suit Harry’s needs. After the end of the war, Kreacher had gone first to Hogwarts, then on to a free elf group in France, so there wasn’t anyone to live in the house with Harry after Ginny moved out and Ron and Hermione got married and started their family.
“If you imply that I’m romantic again,” said Draco, pinking in the cheeks and looking delighted. “I shall turn you into a racoon.”
“I know.” Harry felt his own eyes start to tingle, “And I suppose I acted just how you were afraid I would.”
“I didn’t grab you! I-”
“Good?” Harry whispered when he found his voice.
Harry set the mugs down on the table, “I’m sorry about that. Milk and sugar?”
“All right, my little prodigy,” Harry said, stifling a laugh. “We’ll be late for Draco, come on now.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “I didn’t say it was my best thing; I said it was on offer. It’s Monday afternoon tea with me and my godson, not a five course meal at the Ritz.”
“I would never,” Harry promised.
Harry laughed, “That wouldn’t make them taste better.”
Hermione ignored him, “If he weren’t yknow. Malfoy. I’d say you’d like him, Harry.”
“Mmm,” Draco nodded, mouthing at Harry’s chest, and Harry could feel the vibrations of his answer.
Harry was feeling a little overwhelmed under the onslaught of questions, “He doesn’t transform yet, so this all feels a bit premature.”
“We’ve just had a bit of a fright. There was a boggart in Theodore’s cupboard, and I thought it’d be best if we didn’t sleep at Grimmauld Place tonight. I don’t suppose you could spare a couple of beds?”
He’d had a cup of tea in the kitchen out of his Chudley Cannons mug and a slice of toast and a soft boiled egg. He’d dressed in his baggy Harpies jumper that he’d nicked from Ginny when they were engaged and his old Quidditch leggings from his Seeker days at Hogwarts. They were worn almost through at the knees, and he liked to fiddle with the barest patch when he was stuck on a difficult sentence. He’d carried a cup of coffee into the library and locked the door behind him, then switched on his wireless loud enough to hear but too quiet to make out any lyrics. Then he sat down at his desk to read through the last page or two of his manuscript aloud. So far so good.
“Of course,” said Harry promptly. He looked about them, then pulled Draco into the narrow alley between the theatre and the building next to it, hugged Draco to him again and Disapparated.
“The curse is like a trap,” Draco said. “Cursed objects aren’t discharging significant amounts of magic at all times, only when they’re tripped. And even so, it takes a very powerful wizard to cast a lasting curse on an object. It’s even harder to cast a lasting curse on a person.”
Harry grinned, “Maybe I take after him.”
Draco had apparently been working himself up to something and cut across him without seeming to realise it, “Harry Potter. Would you like to have dinner with me? Tomorrow night?”
“Well there wouldn’t be. This was my godfather’s room, and he was-”
Theodore pushed up his glasses, “Thank you. Erm. I think I want to go and sit with my friends again, okay?”
“What were you trying to tell us?” Dudley asked after a moment of quiet.
“Because you put your pride aside and asked him to!” Ginny insisted. “And don’t discount what you’ve done yourself, Harry!”
“Planned a nicer date for when you were free and brought my best mate here to laugh at me for getting in my own way.”
Draco shrugged, “You’ve been in love before, haven’t you? You were engaged to Weasley.”
“Thanks for a lovely evening.”
“Sorry!” said Theo, tossing his book bag aside. He looked up at Malfoy, “Hello.”
“It’s after midnight,” Harry whispered. “I want to go to bed. Do you remember where your room is?”
“Ah.”
Hermione gave Ron a try-and-be-more-sensitive look, “Ronald.”
Harry found the nightshirt and handed it to Draco politely instead of tossing it. Draco had finished his pain potion and was looking much less drawn. He went back to the Strengthening Solution, and he was petting Shadowfax as if she really were as important a part of the proceedings as she appeared to think.
Draco sighed.
He read to Draco for a long time, til his voice was hoarse and he had to conjure a glass of water to refresh himself. When he checked his watch, he found to his surprise that it was midnight. Draco had fallen asleep across his lap, warm and heavy. Harry would even have read on, but his eyes were going gritty with tiredness, so he patted Draco’s shoulder to wake him.
“Right, sorry.”
“Thanks,” said Harry. “I think I’ll do that.”
“Glad to hear you’re getting on with the next book,” Hagrid said eagerly. “I about tore through the last one. Never thought I would have enjoyed that sort o’ thing. Made up stories and all. But you’ve got a knack, Harry. You’ve got a knack for anything you try, really.”
“What happened to your arm?” Harry reached out to grab hold of Malfoy’s arm for a proper look at it, then checked himself. The Mark had faded into shadowy obscurity like an old bruise, but stretched over it, warping and distorting it, was an unmistakable pink and pitted bite scar.
Harry tried to moderate his smile, “That something being me?”
“Yes, she seems to think of me as a sort of gigantic little brother. It’s very annoying,” Draco belied his words by kissing his cat on the top of the head. “She’s terribly pushy and bossy and insists on sitting on me.”
The server scribbled on his pad, “Absolutely. I’ll be right out with those drinks for you.” And he turned and went back into the water, a seal again.
Harry shook his head, “No one’s been in this room in years. I’ve been keeping it locked.”
Draco was pulling on his gloves, “I think I’d like you to take me home, if you don’t mind.”
“Theodore, listen to me,” Harry said seriously, leaning toward his godson at the table and taking hold of his shoulder. “Starting when I was a very little bit older than you are, the grownups around me let me get into a load of dangerous situations and let me think that it was all an adventure and that it was my responsibility to sort it out, because they wouldn’t or they couldn’t or they didn’t understand.
“Kal says hi,” Theo announced promptly, before he’d even greeted Draco on his own behalf. Harry felt a little twinge for Kal at the blank look on Draco’s face.
Harry laughed, “Well yeah, I’d read your book. What did you think of mine?”
He crossed the room to Harry in one joyful bound, and Harry had the chance to appreciate just how very big Draco was in that form as two huge and heavy wolf paws landed on his shoulders, and Draco nuzzled wetly against his cheek, into his ear and down his neck.
“My pleasure,” said Draco. And he looked like he meant it.
“Well yes, hasn’t it always been Theodore?” Andromeda Vanished her handkerchief and Conjured a new one.
Harry raised an eyebrow, “Oh yeah?”
The Glade
Harry turned to move in the direction Draco indicated, “So what happened to the big family home out in the country?”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “I suppose you think saving my life gives you the right to eavesdrop on my Healer appointments.”
“Er a bit. He was my godfather--your cousin, I suppose--my godfather’s younger brother, Regulus. He was a Death Eater, but he was a saboteur. Stole things from Voldemort and hid them in order to bollocks up his plans. I thought it was only one thing, actually. A locket. But it must have been more than one if there’re still Dark objects here, since I saw the locket destroyed years ago. It was seriously cursed, though, like you say. Tried to kill me.”
“Feel this,” Draco held out the Dark Detector.
“Well, what are the options?” Harry asked. “Who’ve you liked best so far?”
Harry opened his mouth, but Draco answered again, “I do know Harry. We were in the same year at Hogwarts, but Harry is one of the people I was not very nice to.”
Harry resisted the urge to remark aloud that Theodore was an old soul. It was the sort of grownup rubbish he’d started to find irritating around that age, “I think Granny would be sorry to hear you say that, Theodore. It’s all right for you to decide about your own name, even if it would make Granny a bit unhappy for a little while.”
“Don’t hold me to that! Once was enough!”
“I do not look like that.”
Theodore seemed unable to answer.
“Hmm,” said Theo, too well mannered to disagree with a compliment openly. “So how did you go from that to wanting to be a cursebreaker and get rid of monsters?”
“I can’t believe you only just booked a table yesterday, and they had something available.”
Theodore found them again, “Can I have more than one?”
“Right you are, send him through.”
“Better?” Harry asked about four minutes later, when Draco had disappeared his bacon and eggs and was now focused on his tea but at a more reasonable rate.
Draco sat up again and tapped his chin, pretended to consider, “So you feel adequately seduced?”
“Of course. I should give him his hot chocolate while it’s still warm,” Draco announced, rising to fit the action to the words.
Draco only bumped against Harry’s legs again and ambled sleepily toward his room, Shadowfax at his heels.
“He’s a great kid, you know. Theo is.”
“I didn’t like. I didn’t feel emasculated or anything stupid like that. I wasn’t upset because Luna’s a woman. I just.” He sighed and dropped his voice, “At the time, I thought we were like. Perfect. And the idea that we weren’t and that you could just walk away made me feel like. I didn’t know anything about anything. I was. Scared.”
“Don’t cheek me when I’m having a breakdown at the breakfast table, Theodore John Lupin.”
“But I mean apart from not being a lycanthrope, I don’t know anything about writing a play! It’s not like writing a novel.”
“It’s up to you,” Draco told him. “Take your time. It’s a very serious commitment.”
“Of course it’s okay.”
“No! We can handle it. I’m coming in.”
“Exactly! Now, would you like to do the honours?”
Draco drew in a deep breath through his nose, “I see.”
Theodore frowned, “I know.”
“He goes by Theodore now,” said Harry automatically.
“Oh.”
“So you wouldn’t say you’ve sort of fictionalised any part of your experience and ascribed it to Belle Brewer (the lead character of Potter’s novels)?”
“I should go and practise piano,” Theo said suddenly. He got up from his chair, “See you later, Draco.”
Draco tossed his hair, still blushing furiously, “Very fucking big of you. I suppose I’d just have to piss in your garden. If we’ve really got to make a plan in advance. I’ll make sure to go before I transform. If that puts your mind at ease!”
“All right, then. Is there anything you need before we go home?”
“So this means. You’ll be doing the whole decontamination and the removals yourself? You’re coming back?”
“Yes, first time,” Draco said.
Harry held his breath.
“But why should they ask for notes from you? They’ve got their own dads.”
There seemed to be some sort of communication between Malfoy and the Dark Detector, though Harry could not understand its mechanism. It apparently guided him about the room randomly, and he paused to pass it over various spots or objects without obvious reason. He spent quite a long time lingering at an old tapestry on the wall that showed a fat yellow moon hanging over a hillside with a stream running past it.
“Well, you’ve already made well over the fundraising goal for the YLHC in advance ticket sales, so by that metric it’s a smashing success. And it’s a brilliant play,” Draco said firmly. “They’re going to love it. It’s going to be an absolute sensation. And we’ll be on either side of you the entire time. Moral support.”
Harry reckoned Theodore was likely right about that, “I’ll help you tell her if you like.”
When he Hovered a plate of sandwiches and a jug of pumpkin juice into the sitting room a quarter of an hour later, he found Theodore sitting on the floor, his stocking feet folded under him, while he sorted through the collapsed pile of tapes.
” the voice screamed. “
Draco smiled, “Thank you. I’m trying to be nice now. Helping people with their monsters and curses is part of that, actually, so I’m very pleased that you’re pleased.”
“Hm, let’s see. Exploding Snap is right out, ha. Our options are a bit limited as there’re only two of us. And you’re a wolf,” he added as an afterthought. “Or at least you look like one.”
Harry laughed, and he knew it a was a little too loudly. Then he stood up, “I think we’ve only got the library left now.”
“Exposed,” Harry finished. “Me too. Have your friends been erm. Teasing you about fancying me?”
“That’s right,” Theo said, a little nervously. “I need a wand.”
“An impulse,” Harry repeated thoughtfully. “What’s he like now?”
“Draco?” asked Harry, surprised.
“Oh, is this about that werewolf thing?” Ron interjected, leaning toward them, away from a half-serious argument with Hermione about kneazles.
Draco fanned himself only slightly sardonically, “Be still my heart.”
Theo frowned thoughtfully, “You look really familiar. Are you a friend of Harry’s?”
Draco kissed his chest, “I’d never feed you to a raccoon.”
“Great. Erm, Theo are you all right? Do you need a hug?”
“Wow!” Harry paused, trying unsuccessfully to picture Luna giving a lecture, “That’s amazing.”
“Well,” continued Theodore. “Now we’re all here, and we’re going to be together all the time. Well together during the summer hols and at Christmas. Unless I go to Victoire’s I mean. Or stay at the Burrow to spend time with Granny. Shouldn’t our house have a name? We can’t keep calling it Grimmauld Place. That sounds dreadful. We should give it a name. A nice name. So that people hear it and know we’re happy here.”
Harry raised his eyebrows, but he unpinned the rosette on his own chest and pointed his wand at it, “Geminio.” He handed Draco the second rosette and watched Draco pocket the green and silver one. “Any special reason?”
“I think Theo wants to meet you,” Harry confessed as he poured a cup. “Milk and sugar?”
“I must be much gentler when I bring it up in future. But you really must-”
Harry came in. “Good morning,” he whispered. “Do you need anything?”
“I haven’t asked you for anything,” Harry pointed out.
“Christ no! I hope not! Obviously I want people to think about my work when they read it, but I’m not trying to supply anyone with pre-formed opinions.The stories I feel most impelled to tell aren’t an autobiographical account of my personal perspective. And if they were, I suspect they’d be quite soggy and not half so much fun. In writing at least. I hope people are having fun when they read my stuff. That was actually a major part of why I wanted to write fiction, so that people would have a bit of fun with it.”
“Yes, I know.”
“Is it also a kind of food? Like a doughnut? Don’t just laugh! Tell meee!” Draco wobbled Harry’s arm, jostling a good bit of pasta onto the duvet.
“I might ask Draco,” Theo suggested. “I suppose he could tell me all about curses and monsters and things.”
“Tactless,” supplied Ron, nodding. “I’ll swear Hermione to secrecy.”
“No, nothing. Just the picture and the wall.”
Draco found another ghoul posing as a hideous figurine in a little used corridor, stoppered up a puffskein hole under Harry’s bed with a sort of foam that hardened almost at once and blended into the paneling on the wall, removed a brace of dessicated doxies and a doxie egg sac from the little cabinet above the stove, and warded a set of silver candelabras with minor curses on them.
“I mean I think he wants to get to know you. He recognised you.”
“It’s all right,” Draco said lightly. “Onward and upward.”
“Look Potter, I didn’t mean to put you on the spot earlier. As I say, it’s your book. I’m not trying to write it for you.”
“One of the essential components of accomplishing anything specific,” remarked Draco, still whispering. “Is knowing what sort of tools to use.” Draco dug in his bag and pulled out something that Harry thought at first was a biro, til Draco took off the cap, and it turned out to be a knife with a short, very sharp blade. Of the sort one uses in model making or cutting stencils into cardboard.
“You feel it?” Malfoy asked after a moment.
Draco did look rather ashamed at that, “I swear I’m usually extremely good at my job.”
Harry drew a deep breath, “Yeah ready.” He shut his eyes, then opened them again and looked right into Malfoy’s pupils. He thought of Theodore. Of seeing him for the first time in the photo Remus had shown him of a tiny baby with turquoise hair. He thought of Theo zooming around the room on the toy broomstick Harry had given him for his third birthday. He thought of Theodore sitting on the floor picking out tapes, and he thought of Theo fending off a boggart attack.
“No offense,” said Theodore. “But that sounds a bit childish.”
Harry laughed heartily, “I’ll bring you one some time. Do you know hmm. Do you know what an astronaut is?”
“Thank you,” said Theodore again. And he began to make up his list.
Harry walked forward to meet him, “Ron! I forgot you’d be here.”
“I’ve never really been wooed like this before. It’s so sweet of you. Happy when I’m happy and all.”
“Oh dear,” Draco murmured when Theodore had disappeared. “I think that may have been a bit much.”
“So do I,” said Draco. “Good choice.”
“Right, but she doesn’t really have any leads apart from the sound of the person’s voice.”
All along the walls, the other portraits began to scream as well. The noise was unimaginable. Even despite his hands clamped to his ears, Harry’s head was ringing.
Harry cordially invited Malfoy to have a cup of coffee with him--Harry’s third of the morning--before attending to his duties, and Malfoy cordially accepted the invitation. Harry couldn’t decide if he thought Malfoy looked more different than he had when they were at school or more the same. He was dressed in the dark blue robes of his cursebreaker's uniform, and he’d put his hair into a neat plait, then wound it into a small knot at the base of his neck. It was rather fussy, but it suited him. He looked handsome and considered.
Malfoy smiled, and Harry spared a moment to wonder how it seemed like a new expression every time.
Harry gestured to Draco’s bag, “Did you find anything?”
“And besides there were ghouls and doxies and things,” Harry added.
Malfoy lifted an eyebrow, “I never saw your inquiry letter. Our custom is to assess the client’s needs in person, so it wasn’t considered necessary.” He hesitated a moment, as if wondering what he could get away with, “Of course I did recognise the address as one of the homes formerly belonging to my family, but so many of those old family homes have been sold or seized and repurposed since the war. I see a lot of once familiar houses changed over into flats or shops or village schools.” He smiled another smile that Harry had never seen before, “I was gratified to find my youngest cousin living here. I’m glad that the last Black family home should go to the last of the Blacks.”
Harry couldn’t imagine why Malfoy backing down should make him feel so increasingly guilty, “You’re not going to get in trouble with your boss, are you?”
Harry was having lots of fun with Draco, who seemed keen on introducing Harry to new things. Magical cuisine Harry had never tasted. Magical places Harry had never visited. Silly things like quiz night at the Leaky Cauldron and mooncalf dances at the Magical Creatures Reserve in Ireland.
Harry raised his eyebrows as he pulled the door shut behind him, “You walked? I thought you lived in a big family home out in the country.” He waved his wand to lock the door and raise the protective wards. “Although I suppose I remember you saying something about Hawthorn Court, now I think of it.”
“Okay!” He glanced at Harry again. “I’ll just put my bag away.”
“Hufflepuffs,” Hagrid said with a wink. “They’ll be easiest on a new teacher.”
“Well, that’s not really fair to Ginny, though,” Harry said gently. “I don’t mean to keep rehashing this. I know it feels like. This big. Thing. This wall between us, and I just don’t want it to be that way anymore, so I just. I want you to know I’m sorry. That isn’t what I want at all. I want us to be mates again.”
“Right! It’s a prophylactic measure so that if I transform, I’ll be safe. I haven’t yet, but I might do soon. It’s really nasty,” Theodore added with a note of glee. “Wolfsbane. Tastes like. Like bogies! But I’m getting good at taking it. You just have to drink it down quick so it doesn’t go cold. Harry gives me ice cream after. I probably won’t get ice cream when I take it at Hogwarts, but Harry says Madam Pomfrey always has chocolate. Technically it’s for dementor attacks, but I expect she’d give me a little after I take my wolfsbane since it’s still sort of for medicinal purposes? I wouldn’t need the chocolate if I wasn’t a werewolf, right?”
“Wow,” Draco drew a long breath and clutched his left forearm with his right hand.
Draco turned that over in silent consideration long enough to make Harry feel quite antsy. “I think I do know what you mean,” he said slowly. “I don’t know if I believe in a do-over exactly. But. I do agree that. Well. I think that I’ve known for a very long time that you have to be willing to change to stay alive. And it’s good to have something to. Change toward.”
“What?	!” Harry blurted out.
Theodore shook his head, “No, I’m not sure.”
When Theo was out of the room, Harry turned to Malfoy, “What are you doing here?”
“It’s settled then,” Theodore said, proudly, circling THE GLADE where it was written on the kitchen wall. And so it was settled.
“She reckons I might. Erm.”
Harry had worked diligently with the school and with Theodore himself to come up with a transformation plan and they’d been over it together at least half a dozen times, so the answer came almost automatically, “You’ll have your wolfsbane potion every night the week of the full moon and spend the night of the full moon in the hospital wing until moonrise. Once it’s clear you’re not going to transform, you can go back to your common room or what have you. If you do transform, you can stay in the hospital wing until morning or signal to Madam Pomfrey and she’ll send for Hagrid to escort you onto the grounds for some fresh air.
The silence that followed was rather awkward. Harry did have something in particular on his mind, but he wasn’t sure how to bring the conversation around to the topic, as he’d made it clear in the past that it was a point he’d rather avoid. He decided that the only thing for it was blurting.
“Why can’t I stay for the cursebreaking?” Theo asked while he waited for his Portkey and picked at the remains of his breakfast. His hair was in dark curls that morning, quite like Harry’s. It made Harry feel both rather flattered and a sense of foreboding, considering that Theodore was saying exactly what Harry would have said at his age.
“Oh d’y’reckon?” Harry snapped. “He’s never even said the word werewolf to me, and you barely know him and come in and avalanche all that over him! Of course it was a bit much!”
When they arrived at the restaurant, Draco murmured to the hostess that he’d booked a table for two under Malfoy.
After slightly too much lunch, they moved on to Sirius’s room. Harry was rather dreading it, and Draco must have sensed his nerves, because he seemed a little tense as well. But Harry unsealed and unlocked the room, and they stepped in. After a minute, Draco’s shoulders lowered and he smiled as he paced about with his Dark Detector held out in front of him.
“His rights for werewolves group actually has a whole platform about youth outreach. A lot of the new werewolves are really young because of.” Hermione screwed up her face as if it stung to say his name aloud, “Greyback. Attacking them in the war,” She shuddered and Ron rubbed her arm. “According to Malfoy, it’s uphill sledding, though. Because of him, ironically. Greyback. People think werewolves only want to be around kids to bite them.”
Harry groaned, “Oh don’t say that. I’ve been dreading the idea.”
Molly got up to come and stand before the fire, smiling but with a worried tightness about her eyes, “Oh no trouble at all. What’s the matter?”
Harry did not laugh, but it wasn’t because it didn’t occur to him, “What would you have done if I’d been busy?”
“You’re amazingly loving, Harry,” Luna said matter of factly. “But you’re afraid of not being in charge of it. You can’t be in charge of it every time, though. You’re not a gardener with a watering can. You’re a flower, too. Just like the rest of us.”
Theodore was loitering over a bite or two of pie crust when they came down to the kitchen, but after a gentle prompt from Harry, went off to practise piano with a good enough will. Harry put the kettle on, and Malfoy accepted a scone after being asked twice.
“No,” said Harry. “I don’t get out much. I expect they do seafood?”
Harry spared a moment to marvel over the paradox that was Luna’s grasp of subtext, “Is it that obvious? Or have you been talking about me?”
“Oh, that’s an easy one. One of my dear friends takes Witch Weekly, and she’d never forgive me if I turned it down. I know what you’re thinking,”
“I’ve not been apprised of the normal options for this situation; we must have gone to different finishing schools. And I wasn’t trying to ambush you. Who grabbed who?”
Once the film started up again, Draco was rapt. He watched in hypnotised amazement, stealing occasional looks at Harry, as if for confirmation that he was really seeing what he thought he was seeing. He laughed and gasped and snorted and jumped in all the right places. It was most satisfying. Besides, in the first tense moment, he grabbed hold of Harry and tugged him closer, then spent the rest of the film tucked against Harry’s side and clutching his pyjamas at various intervals. Harry very much enjoyed that.
“Ah, well that’s the first clue! A picture hung in the ordinary way will have some sort of fixture. Screws or nails or even Spell-o-Tape in a pinch. Now watch this carefully.” Draco pushed his free hand into the gap between the edge of the frame and the wall, “See the way my finger blurs just the tiniest bit? That’s the spell, and that clinches it. Definitely a Permanent Sticking Charm. Now that we’ve discovered we can’t get the frame off the wall whatever we do, how do you suggest we get rid of the portrait?”
“Malfoy Manor,” said Draco. “My ancestors were gifted with creativity.”
Dudley was appalled, “That’s awful!”
“I wasn’t ‘set off’! I was a normal amount of suspicious, and I was right!”
Draco smiled, “It’s all right, Potter. Queer as a week of Sundays, Theodore. Yes, I’m gay.”
But it was no good. Draco’s great, beautiful, backlit head came nosing into the wardrobe, parting the robes to zero in on Harry and darted a warm lick on Harry’s cheek.
Theo cut the picture away from the frame, slowly and carefully, Mrs Black raving behind the Silencing Charm all the while.
“Oh lighten up,” said Ginny. She got up from her chair, “I’m going to go play quidditch with the kids. Come along, Luna?”
Draco huffed, “Why are you laughing?”
“It’s so odd to me that in wizarding culture, we sort of give up creativity and imagination as we leave childhood. It’s tragic. I’ve been wondering and trying to work out what about magic precludes us from writing novels and plays and making art that isn’t a portrait of some inventor or politician, and I’ve just absolutely no idea. You know I don’t even know any wizards who play a musical instrument? My godson wanted to learn to play the piano, and his tutor is a muggle. Do you know any wizards who play the piano?”
” Vernon shouted, never mind the fact that he was angry about Hedwig being loud at night. Harry knew better than to talk back, especially as Vernon raised his free hand and landed a harsh slap to the side of his face. Harry’s cheek stung but he clenched his jaw to keep from making a single sound, still forced to make eye contact with Vernon. Vernon landed another strong blow to the side of Harry’s face, making his vision blur slightly. Vernon jerkily released Harry’s chin, before shoving him back hard enough to slam his head against the wall, resulting in a rather dull thud. Harry closed his eyes instinctively.
Flashback change
That was the day that Harry Potter’s body had been defiled by his own relative.
“Well… IkindofhadtotaketheDarkMarkthispastsummereventhoughIdidn’twantto.” Draco blurted in a rush, his words jumbled together.
Draco was soaked through all of his clothing now, and he was extremely cold, but he ignored his discomfort in favour of seeing Harry, his Harry, or at least, see where he laid.
In the bathroom, Harry inspected his injuries from Vernon. They were healing somewhat decently, the bruises fading from the bright purple to a nasty yellow-green. However, the parts of his back that had been dug into with a belt buckle weren’t faring so well. A few of them looked infected, and all of them were puffy and red. He finally let out the breath he had been holding, momentarily releasing the tension in his body. Quidditch had been fun and freeing, but all of his muscles had been already aching and that certainly hadn’t helped them any. He tugged on his clean trousers and was just about to finish pulling his clean shirt over the last bruise when Ginny barged into the bathroom. He flinched, and quickly crossed his arms over himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Call me Draco. We’re friends now, correct?” Draco paused, and Harry nodded. “So, call me Draco.”
“Just tell me what’s going on!” He grinned.
“But it’s true! You are a Parselmouth! You did nearly get sorted into Slytherin! You can try to lie, but you can’t fool me! I know exactly what you’re playing at!” Ron shot back, his face flushing a beet red.
Draco hugged the gravestone, knowing that was as close to hugging Harry as he’d get.
A now nine-year-old Harry stood in the kitchen, scrubbing plates with scalding hot water. He was stood on his tiptoes to reach the sink, the years of malnourishment had stunted his growth, leaving him at the proper height and weight for a seven-year-old. The house was quiet, Petunia had taken Dudley out for a special mother-son bonding time, leaving Harry home alone with Vernon. Vernon walked into the kitchen and came over to Harry. Harry squeaked as he was yanked away from the dishes and dragged upstairs to Vernon and Petunia’s room. Vernon began touching Harry, and Harry could do nothing out of fear of being beaten. Harry had no idea what was going on. Vernon touched him for hours, in places that Harry had barely even thought about before. Vernon then forced Harry to repeat the actions on him, Vernon clearly enjoying this.
“I’m afraid that I don’t know. The plans given were very top secret, although everyone was informed that Nott had a plan to carry out.” Draco tugged at his sleeve nervously. There was a pause.
[ Word Count Total: 5,232 ]
No one truly knew Draco was hurting this badly. Pansy and Blaise had their suspicions, but they never pressed him for information.
“I’ve been here since I brought you here. As for Pomfrey telling me anything, well…” Draco paused, “She did tell me some things.”
“You clearly have never heard of a thing called bisexuality, but I’m not dating Ginny. She broke up with me at the end of the last school year.” Harry shrugged, he was actually quite pleased to not be dating Ginny. He hadn’t really been attracted to her and had only dated her because he was afraid of what Ron would do if he had ‘broken Ginny’s heart’ by rejecting her.
“If you insist, Harry. Let me help you with your things,” Arthur replied calmly, taking Harry’s trunk from him. Harry bent and grabbed his backpack and Hedwig from where he had placed them by the door. Arthur turned and walked towards his car, Harry following closely. The door could be heard slamming behind them, but Harry didn’t have it in him to care. Arthur’s car was an older Ford, similar to the Anglia. It was slightly more battered than the Anglia had been in its better days. Arthur opened the door to the backseat and slid Harry’s trunk onto the seat. Harry set Hedwig gently on the seat next to his trunk and placed his bag on the floor, before making his way over to the passenger seat. Arthur hopped into the driver’s seat and started the car. After Harry got settled in and they were a bit down the road, Arthur decided to break the silence.
Shopping was the ultimate bore, in Harry’s opinion. After trying on his fifth set of colourful robes as per the insistence of Madam Malkin, he finally snapped and practically begged her to just sell him some plain, black robes. He had barely outgrown his old robes, but they had become so gross from sitting uncleaned in his trunk all summer that he knew he needed some new ones. He sheepishly paid for the robes he had insisted upon, already feeling guilty for getting frustrated with the shop owner. Getting his school books had been boring too, he just stuck to list, a little disappointed that his O.W.L. scores meant that he couldn’t take Potions. Even though Snape had been awful to him for the past five years, he still wished he could take the class. He made only a few more stops before feeling as though he had done enough shopping. Despite having enough money to purchase a good portion of Diagon Alley if he wanted to, his instincts were more inclined to saving money and only buying the essentials.
The day of classes flew by despite the insults hurled at him, by members of all the houses. Harry didn’t care, he was used to having horrible names spewed at him. Ron tried several times to hex Harry, or punch him, but every time he tried, a teacher or a Prefect would show up, and Ron would chicken out of doing anything. Both lunch and dinner had been awkward, Harry had to sit at the end of the table with the first years to avoid anyone who might try to ruin his meal. Harry could have sworn that Seamus was glancing at him, although Harry shrugged it off. Seamus probably would insult him like the majority of Gryffindors.
“Do you know of the plans?” Harry asked. He knew it was best to keep his cool in a situation like this, but he was itching to get up and go warn everyone, not that many would believe him. Draco shook his head.
“Alright, Harry.” Draco replied, and the conversation lapsed into silence. After a bit, Harry spoke up.
The two reached the room and Harry immediately flung himself onto the nearest couch. “Y’know… I hate to ask you now, but what did Weasel do to you?” Draco asked, sitting down on the armchair next to the couch. A look of something similar to despair crossed over Harry’s face and his eyes seemed to be almost glazed over. Harry opened his mouth, seeming like he was going to answer Draco’s question, only to pour out a flood of self-hatred.
Anyways, now that I'm done oversharing, I appreciate you all so much! I'd be nowhere without readers and even if I don't reply to comments, I read them all and take them all into account! If you have any ideas about where you think my story should go, feel free to tell me! No guarantees, but I love seeing new theories and ideas.
Draco didn’t want to do anything; from getting out of bed to caring for his plants to taking care of himself to visiting his friends. All he wanted was one more conversation with Harry, one last kiss, anything to give him any closure for this.
But when will it pass?
The door swung open and Harry swallowed, his entire body tense as he tried to hide his fear. Vernon stood in the doorway, his face purple with rage. Harry huddled in the corner of the mattress, making himself as small as possible. Vernon stomped over and jerked Harry’s head up by his chin, forcing Harry to look at his face.
“Why are you sitting here? Don’t you want to sit with your housemates?” Harry asked, the usual venom gone from his voice. He was rather confused as to why Draco was standing in his compartment, not insulting him.
Well, I guess I should tell you all everything that's new and life-y! I'll just make a list since a lot can happen in a year (whoops, I'll try not to go so long without updating :') )
“I’m bored of Blaise and Pansy, and Crabbe and Goyle are pretty much rocks so there’s no point in sitting with them.” Draco replied, pausing briefly before adding, “I swear to Merlin, Potter, if you don’t move this bird cage so I can sit down…” He trailed off, jabbing his wand at Harry for emphasis.
Draco had checked everywhere in the school, save for outside, since something in him told him that Harry was still in the castle. The only place left to check was the Gryffindor Tower, although Draco thought it unlikely Harry would go there; why would he go back to the place where he had been tormented, and would be tormented? As he got closer, he could hear a scream being cut off, and the sound of something smacking the floor. He quickened his pace and what he saw caused him to temporarily freeze. Harry was in a full body bind, his eyes darting around as he looked for someone to help him, while Ron repeatedly kicked and punched him. Harry’s glasses had been knocked off when he had been shoved down and they laid near his head, a crack along the left lens. Draco mentally slapped himself and snapped out of his frozen state, stepping closer. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing, Weasel?” Draco’s voice was cold, and he did his best to avoid screaming at Ron, aware that Harry wouldn’t appreciate loud noise. Ron’s head snapped up and he glared at Draco.
“I like girls. And guys, I guess, but I think I like a girl right now.” Ginny blurted, the tips of her ears tinging pink.
“Mr. Weasley will be here soon, I need to get my trunk out from the cupboard.”
Chapter Two
The article went on to provide theories for how Harry was linked to the Dark Side, all of which made Harry increasingly angry. “You seriously believe this, Ron? It’s written by Skeeter! You know how that woman is!” Harry shouted, unable to contain his anger and hurt.
“You sure? That sounded like an unpleasant fall.” Draco replied, moving closer to Harry.
“H-how bad is he?” Draco stumbled over his words. Pomfrey cleared her throat as if clearing all emotion out of her voice.
“Oh Merlin, Draco, you should see your face right now! I was joking!” Harry laughed so hard he fell off the couch, parchment and quills scattering around him. Draco joined him in laughter and went over to help him up. The two gathered up Harry’s work and stacked it on the coffee table, before settling back onto the couch, still laughing together. They got to know each other even more, and it was obvious that Harry was very comfortable around Draco now. He leaned against Draco on the couch as they chatted, and when they finally went to the Great Hall for meals, they sat together at the Slytherin table, ignoring the looks from the Gryffindor table. After their meal, they returned to their room and kept talking and laughing until late into the night, when they finally decided to get some rest, so they’d be prepared for the day of classes they both had in the next day.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s what I thought.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest.
“Will our stuff already be in our new room?” Draco asked, getting up out of the bed. He was dressed in a set of the infirmary’s pajamas, having been given some by Pomfrey when she found he was staying overnight.
“I saw you as you went to the tower. You were holding some parchment, so I thought you were meeting with a girl or something and I wanted to see who it was, so I followed you. I hid until you needed help. I couldn’t just let you die.” Draco stated, his voice void of emotion ‘You saved him because you like him!’ A voice in the back of Draco’s head taunted. Harry seemed to be mulling over Draco’s words.
While it was true that Draco was deep in his grief, he could still find small, happy memories of him and Harry deep in his mind. His favourite memory was of the day he had given Harry a promise ring. He had planned a meal at Harry’s favourite restaurant then they had gone flying in the woods behind the nearby park. Draco had released a snitch and made sure that Harry caught it, and when it did, it opened to reveal two golden rings, which had a knot decorating them where a gem usually was. Harry had turned to look at Draco quizzically, as if he didn’t believe this was real. “I know you’re not ready for marriage or engagement yet, but I wanted to show you that I’m serious about being with you forever. Those are promise rings, I had them specially made.” Draco explained, pulling one of the rings out and slipping it onto Harry’s finger. Harry did the same to Draco, his eyes shining with happy tears. They stretched over their brooms to embrace, as the sun slowly sunk below the horizon.
“You can call me Molly. I’ll be in the kitchen if you need anything.” She replied, walking back to the stove and continually stirring something that smelled delicious. Harry made his way upstairs, soon reaching the top floor, Ron’s room. He knocked quietly and upon hearing a faint “Come in!”, he pushed the door open and entered. Ron was seated on his bed, flipping through a Quidditch magazine. Harry set his stuff on the empty bed across from Ron’s before going over to Ron. Ron didn’t acknowledge him, so Harry cleared his throat. “Ron, mate, how have you been? I haven’t heard much from you.” Harry said timidly, knowing how easily Ron could blow up.
Chapter Six
“Like?”
“Meet you outside in fifteen minutes?” Ginny asked, already getting up from the table and heading to the stairs.
“Oh. Well, that’s cool. Did you think I wasn’t gonna accept you?” Harry tilted his head to the side curiously.
P.S. And to Dumbledore, the Dursleys, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and the rest of the people who believe rubbish about me, I leave a big Fuck you.
Ships:
“Oh? And what were you doing then, if it wasn’t cuddling?”
Draco quickened his pace as he felt his sobs rising in his throat, threatening to choke him.
“We haven’t heard much from you this summer, how have you been?” Arthur asked, glancing over at Harry before moving his eyes back to the road.
Draco never said goodbye to Harry. He thought he never would. That would make it so much more real.
“You are to go clean the upstairs bathrooms. Once you finish, begin cooking dinner. I expect a lovely meal.” Vernon said, his voice deadly calm, sending a chill down Harry’s spine. Harry nodded and went to the closet and dug out all the cleaning supplies, mentally grumbling. There were three bathrooms upstairs, a tiny, cramped one in the hall for Harry to use, one in Dudley’s room just for him, and one in Petunia and Vernon’s room just for them. The master bathroom had both a jacuzzi bath and a shower, increasing the amount of work it took to clean. He lugged all the supplies up to the bathrooms and set to work, beginning in the master bathroom. He then cleaned Dudley’s bathroom, and finally, his own. He didn’t mind cleaning his own bathroom, it gave him a chance to make sure all his things he had stored in there remained hidden. At around 4:30 pm, Harry had finished his bathroom cleaning chore, so he made his way downstairs with the supplies. He tucked them away in the closet and washed his hands, beginning to prepare dinner. Vernon was thankfully asleep on the couch, a relief to Harry. Petunia was off at her computer, gossiping with her friends. Dudley would be spending the night with his gang, so Harry was pretty much alone again, with the cold feeling looming over him. He brushed it aside and started chopping vegetables for dinner. The house was silent except for chopping noises and the occasional snore from Vernon. Harry cooked quickly, knowing if dinner was still being prepared after 6:00, Vernon would throw a fit. He shuddered at the thought, quickening his pace. He finished right at six, placing the meal on the table. He had prepared a meal of beef stew, and the smell was wonderful. He had set the table beautifully, even adding some flowers in the centre for decoration. He did not set a place for himself, as always, since he was not welcome at the table. He went out to the main hall and called to both Vernon and Petunia. “Dinner is ready!” He called, careful to not be too loud, his voice hoarse. Petunia rose from her computer and gently woke Vernon. She nodded silently in Harry’s direction, allowing him a chance to escape up to his room before Vernon was awake. She and Harry had come to a sort of silent agreement; Harry would remain obedient and not challenge Vernon and Petunia would do her best to protect him from Vernon’s wrath when she could. Harry scurried off to his room, hungry but grateful to have avoided becoming a punching bag, at least for now. He could hear the clink of silverware against dishes and soon he fell asleep, the cold feeling creeping back to him like moth to a flame.
“What is the problem, Mr. Malfoy?” Pomfrey asked, concern edging into her voice.
Harry would never forget that day, even if he couldn’t remember what had been broken to trigger the attack.
“I think I like-” She started but was cut off by a shout from the house.
“Because… Wait, how accepting are you of, you know?” She made an incomprehensible motion with her hands.
“Not so fast, traitor, you aren’t welcome in the dorms anymore.” Ron pointed to a trunk and owl cage which had been placed by the entrance to the common room. Harry didn’t know how he hadn’t noticed it before. Harry looked around desperately for anyone to help him. The only people in the common room were Hermione, Neville, and Ginny. Hermione and Ginny were whispering to each other, and Neville seemed to be absorbed in caring for his plant. Neville glanced at Harry and gave him an apologetic look, and Harry understood that he couldn’t help him, unless he wanted to be kicked out of the dorms too. Harry took a deep breath. “Fine. But don’t come crying to me when you need money for things.” Harry snatched his trunk and his owl cage, Hedwig thankfully unscathed inside, before exiting the common room. Ron could be heard screaming insults at him as he walked away, and Harry shook slightly, memories of the Dursley’s flooding back to him. He had no where to go, so he made his way up to the Room of Requirement. He couldn’t tell a teacher, since they’d just go and tell Dumbledore, and he’d create an even bigger mess. It wasn’t like Dumbledore would be any help, even if he did know. Harry had tried to tell Dumbledore about what happened at the Dursley’s when he was eleven, and Dumbledore had just brushed it off as Harry had been misbehaving and needed to be punished.
“Sorry, sorry! I need to brush my hair and I forgot my hairbrush in here.” She grabbed the red brush off of the counter.
“Whatever, come on, I’ll race you to the top of that tree!” She pointed to the tallest tree in their yard before hopping on her broom and zooming up in the sky. Harry was quick to follow, the two were side by side, until Harry pulled ahead right at the top of the tree. The two spent hours zipping around, chasing the Snitch, and talking. As lunchtime approached, the heat became uncomfortable even while flying around, so they settled onto the soft grass in the shade under the tree. Harry laid back on the grass and stared up through the tree limbs and leaves, only bits of the blue sky poking through. “Hey, Harry, can I ask you for advice?” Ginny spoke up suddenly, laying back next to him.
“Go on, go freshen up. You two were outside for hours.” Molly ushered them to the stairs when they paused at the table. Ginny disappeared into her room, and Harry ducked into the twins’ room to grab some clean-ish clothes from his bag.
A small Harry, who looked to be around six years old, was cowering in the corner of a rather smelly cupboard. Outside of the cupboard, a large man began unlocking the many locks that decorated the outside of the cupboard. Vernon threw the door open and grabbed Harry by his left leg, flinging him out of the cupboard and against the wall behind him. Harry crumpled to the floor, whimpering. “Boy! What did I say about not breaking things?!” Vernon shouted, towering over Harry, his belt clutched in one hand.
“It was take the Dark Mark, or watch my parents be tortured and killed. I did what I had to do.” Draco said thickly, his voice clouded with emotion.
So, those are the ships I will be featuring! Now to get into the chapter! Mentions of abuse and CSA in this chapter as well, although non-graphic. There are some potentially triggering terms used to proceed with caution. There is a lot of dialogue in this chapter and we finally see some friendly Harry and Draco! I meant to mention this earlier, but this fic is very non-book compliant, so Draco’s father doesn’t get sent to prison for reasons that will be revealed in the chapter. I realized that I set this in 6th year so it would be hard to have lots of Drarry if Draco had to perform orders for Voldemort.
“Yeah, don’t pay him any mind, he’s been in a right snit all summer.” George added, opening the door to the twins’ room and going to flop on his bed. Harry and Fred followed, Fred digging out a beanbag chair for Harry from inside the rather cramped closet.
“You said you didn’t want to take it, right? So, why did you have to?” Harry asked, inching closer to Draco. Harry knew nothing on how to comfort someone, but it was clear that Draco needed some comforting.
“We thought we heard…” George began.
“Angelina’s going to take care of the shop, so don’t even say a peep about it!” George quickly piped up, noticing the quizzical expression on Harry’s face.
The two boys retrieved their items from the doorway and went into their bedrooms and unpacked. Draco took far longer than Harry to unpack, and by the time he was done organizing all of his clothing by colour and material, Harry was already halfway through his missed work. Harry’s work had been brought by McGonagall while he was in the infirmary, he had just paid no mind to it, since he was busy hanging out with Draco. Harry heard the door to Draco’s room open and he turned from his seat on the couch to look at Draco. Draco had changed into muggle clothing; a grey sweater with black trousers and plain black socks. Harry had also changed and was now wearing some of Dudley’s hand-me-downs; a huge beige sweater, slightly torn, huge trousers and mis-matched socks. Draco blinked at him, taking in the odd ensemble. “What?” Harry asked, blinking back at him.
The month following, Draco had sat out in the rain all day, and by the time he finally went inside, his entire body was numb, and his lips were blue from cold. He had only come inside because Pansy had come over to check on him and found him near passing out on his balcony.
“So, we found another person, should he agree to this. Since he is already aware of what happened last night, he seemed like a good option.” Pomfrey’s eyes flicked over to Draco, who was listening intently to the conversation. Harry caught the implications of her words and his eyes widened.
“So, I’m dating someone, you know?” She started.
“I’m guessing the Wizarding World is more accepting than the muggle world?” Harry asked.
“Yes, Harry dear?” She responded, the firm tone dropping from her voice.
“You had to what?!” Harry
“Would you rather me be naked?” Harry replied with sass. Draco’s face flushed bright red.
Pansy had pushed Draco into going to therapy to help him move on, but Draco refused to open up to the therapist at all. He didn’t want to move on. He didn’t want to forget Harry.
Harry had walked to the castle alone, the last carriage had been full of his former friends, none of which seemed to be willing to let him join them. Ron had scowled menacingly at him, Hermione had simply turned away from him, Ginny rolled her eyes and gave him a look which seemed to say, ‘piss off’, Neville had given Harry a look of pity, and Luna hadn’t noticed that Harry was there, she was too busy educating Ginny on wrackspurts. Harry arrived at dinner late, the sorting had already been completed and Dumbledore had given his usual start of the year speech. He took one look at the packed Gryffindor table, noting that there was nowhere to sit unless he wanted to sit with first years, before turning on his heel and going to the kitchens for food. He wasn’t particularly hungry, but after eating well at the Weasley’s for the past week, he knew he’d get ill if he went without a meal.
“You can call me Arthur, Harry. As for Ron not writing, I hadn’t known. You should ask him about it once we get to the Burrow.” Arthur said kindly, before lapsing back into silence, although this time there was no awkwardness in the air. Soon they arrived at the Burrow, and Harry gathered his luggage, dragging it in as Arthur held the door open for him. Before he could even pause to adjust to his surroundings, he was swept up into a tight hug from Molly Weasley. She released him after a moment and looked him up and down, as if she could sense his injuries. “It’s good to see you, Harry dear. Let’s go get you settled in. We’ve put an extra bed in Ron’s room for you.” She said, smiling gently at him.
The rain was now picking up, but Draco just kept walking, not even caring as his hair became frizzy and damp.
“She told me about your condition and her speculations as to why you were in that condition.”
“It’s obvious what I was doing, don’t play stupid. I know you’ll have told half the school by the time I unfortunately wake up tomorrow, thanks to you not minding your own business.” Harry stated bitterly. His words were slurred, probably from blood loss, maybe from the shock of Draco bloody Malfoy saving him from death.
“No need to thank me for doing the right thing.” Draco gave Harry a small smile, which Harry briefly returned.
Arthur Weasley stood outside Number Four, Privet Drive, dressed in what could only be described as a sad attempt at muggle fashion. He wore a plaid button up that appeared to be a size too large, and striped pants, which were a dreadful faded maroon. He smiled cheerfully at the Dursleys, and then at Harry as he peeked his head out from behind Petunia.
Harry was restless the next day, and it showed. He was nervous around Malfoy, yet for some reason he couldn't stop sneaking glances at him.
Harry looked at him with narrowed eyes. His phone was the same model as Teddy’s, wasn’t it? He stumbled when a harried mother scolding her son bumped into him. “Is anyone bullying you for your phone?” he asked carefully.
Draco had spent the past week coming to terms with his hasty decision to return to Hogwarts. He had initially been contented with the idea of independent studies for his NEWTs, comfortable in the prospect of withdrawing from the public eye for a while longer. However, the opportunity to properly redeem himself had been too good to pass up.
"How about you? Are you going to visit Narcissa in Bordeaux? Will you be spending Christmas with your mother?"
“This used to be a glassware shop,” Harry said as he pointed to a shop at the front of Diagon Alley.
"Truth or dare?"
Potter moved his feet impatiently, only pausing when Draco looked up. "Is this what Slytherins do in their common room?" He asked, gesturing at his book and Draco's letter.
"No, I've tried. I also thought that she would be the most likely to spill, but she didn't. I have no idea what's wrong with him." He nodded in agreement at nothing in particular for image's sake.
His body had also betrayed him, bursting into shivers whenever Harry touched him. It was as if he could never escape his past, the
"Stop moping right now," he jabbed his elbow into Harry's ribs, "you look like it’s your seventy second time having difficulty conceiving. It's unattractive."
Draco spelled himself clean as he popped off the half hard cock with a wet kiss. He smirked at the languorous smile on Harry's face.
He scrambled to hand Malfoy the shredded shrivelfig when he received a glare.
"Erm, did you–" Harry said as he walked down the corridor with Ron, "–you know, about Malfoy?"
"I'm hoping to get into the Healer programme," Draco said hesitantly. "If they'll have me, that is," he added hastily. "I would understand if people didn’t want to be treated by a former Death Eater."
"Erm, no. It's fine," Finch-Fletchley said, sounding strangely strangled. "—don't eat sweets," he said faintly as he dabbed at his temples. Draco shrugged before pulling the plate back to himself. More for himself then!
Draco gave him a pointed look of 'I told you so' as he returned to his report. He
It is with great apologies that your duties have reached you so late. You should have come to your inheritance upon your age of maturity, but we didn’t think that the past one and a half years was a good time for you.
Draco tried to peer under the table despite the tight squeeze. "Don't play footsie then! Have some bit of decency, Merlin."
"But you weren't."
"Can I help you?" He asked suddenly, taking pleasure in watching the Gryffindors jump in fright. He waited patiently as the girls communicated with each other in a series of frowns and pointed looks.
"No, you're not. There were never any rules."
Teddy hummed before pushing the plate on the counter towards them. "Cookies?" He looked at them guilelessly.
"That's a lot of cookies on your face," Draco laughed as he picked the boy up.
"Oh. Harry loves you so much too," he said as he crawled over and wrapped them both in his muscly arms.
"Oh come off it, Potter," Malfoy rolled his eyes as he started to walk away. "Not to ruin your fun, but you should probably spend your energy worrying about yourself. Granger has Weasley and vice versa, but you'll only have sick fucks stuffed with stories of your heroic acts, or nutters like Lockhart trying to be in your Potter halo."
"So it's settled?" she asked, peering at the corridor behind them.
"I had to sneak letters to Hermione to get that for you because you were always around! You were trying to catch me getting things for you, weren't you?" Harry accused when he finally made the connection. He clenched his fists when Draco only bit his lips guiltily. He was vibrating out of his skin in anger, and his palms were hurting from the sharp press of his nails.
Harry cursed when the Portkey threw him onto his bad leg. Startling when he bumped into a sunflower, Harry felt his shoulders loosen as he took in his surroundings. The bed and breakfast in the distance was exactly as advertised, a quaint and homely property with a large veranda that had called out to him from Hermione’s brochure.
"Oh, darling. It's okay," Narcissa set her cup down immediately when she noticed the conflicted expression on Harry's face. She rounded the table to pull him close. "Oh, it's okay, sweetheart.
! You can't have your chest, and your-" he gestured with obvious agitation, "your arms and
"Not when it's up against Pansy," Ron said as he leaned backwards, effectively pushing Draco closer to Harry in the cramped seat. "But at least it's a nice worry to have. Better than your gift exchange problem if you asked me."
Catching Pansy's eye, he decided to take a gamble. "I'm going back first," he announced to the tables. "It's been a long day," he explained, nodding at Hermione when she stopped nuzzling Weasley, who was apparently an affectionate drunk.
"Hermione!"
Draco was taken aback by the revelation, but looking back at the reading materials Potter favoured and stories about redoing the Grimmauld Place house during summer break, Draco couldn't help but wonder why it hadn't been obvious to him before. "Maybe you could set up something with Greg," Draco suggested. "You could do the renovations, and he could do the custom furniture. And you could rope Blaise in for the schmoozing and design."
"Ronald!" She slammed her quill down to glare sharply at her boyfriend. Harry groaned at the wordless conversation they were having
He hitched his bag higher as he made to leave.
"No, I'll still prefer spaghetti. Cookies are a snack, not dinner."
"Pans, we can talk this through," Ron said when Pansy looked at him, his shoulders loosening as a friendly smile spread across Pansy's lips.
Pansy was leaning over Hermione while Hermione's neck craned back to look at her. Draco was confused by the sight before him—Hermione had set her quill aside in favor of the interaction, and she didn’t seem put out on having her concentration broken, or affected by Pansy's smirk.
"So it's going to be just us this Christmas," Draco mentioned as he applied his anti-ageing cream on the corner of his eyes. They had just returned from a dinner party at Theo's when the realisation had hit.
"How did you manage to get a table? Even Pansy hasn't been able to visit."
Sitting through the Headmistress' reminder of the upcoming reveals for the gift exchange, Harry found himself worrying about Malfoy's response to the discovery that Harry was his gift partner. They had gotten closer after the incident with Walters, but what if Malfoy got mad about how Harry had watched him open all of his presents? It was undeniably creepy, but Ron had been right to say that Harry had always been uncomfortably obsessed about Malfoy. There really was no way to deny anything. He pressed the back of his palms hands to his eyes as he groaned to himself.
Anyway, those events are a logistical nightmare and they're probably desperate to have you, thus the early invitations. You don't have to go for everything, you can send them a nominal amount or donate something for auction if they're fundraisers. But some are not too bad, especially when the food and drinks are good. Always bring a friend who can pull you away from sticky situations.
"Shut up," Harry said as he placed the apple beside Malfoy, heady with his success in manipulating Malfoy. He had already used Malfoy's friends to establish scheduled relations; and there would only be improvements in store.
Harry stared at her in confusion as he processed the timeline. He burst into laughter, “a splash of milk and none if he's stressed?"
My lesson plans are almost finalised! I was worried that my upper years counterpart would be hard to work with, but Heather is fantastic. She favours practical lessons too, so the students wouldn't be too unsettled when they progress to the upper years. And I am liking the job more already, but I'm still sad that I missed teaching Teddy by just a year. I'm more beat up about it than he is. IT IS MISERABLE. I could have embarrassed him so much. UGH.
"What are you on," Malfoy complained as he pushed Harry away from the doorway, quickly masking his pleasant surprise as he hung up his cloak.
"Take it back!" Draco insisted, half his mind already elsewhere at the feeling of Harry's muscles under his hand.
"How else can I get you to be with me? You're the contracts person. I'm the feelings person. It stopped being about the contract for me months ago."
"No, you can't. Look, Hermione, Pansy didn't mean to come between you and Ron, and she regrets her behaviour. And you," he looked at Ron accusingly, "you shouldn't even have made out with her in the first place. I apologize on Pansy's behalf, and if you'll excuse me," he said curtly, quickly pulling Pansy away from the scene.
Draco blinked at the argument that had seemingly sprung out of nowhere. Personally, he had always aspired to be like Michael de Montaigne – a pureblood philosopher similarly famous in the Muggle world – who had retreated from public life and produced his lifework,
Looking at it for their fashion requires more thinking. You would wonder, could I pull it off, would it complement my body shape? Do I already have similar pieces? How should I incorporate it into my wardrobe? Whereas looking at the models comprises of looking at their hair, their brows, their shoulders, their chest, their waist, and their fingers. A lot of flipping through until you see another model that you like. And you, Potter, you do that. You flip and flip and flip and flip and flip, then you stop and stare for ages. Then you sigh, before you flip and flip and flip and flip then you stare again." He looked at Potter pointedly. "
Looking back at this ridiculous date years after, Draco would only remember the shape of Finch-Fletchley's skull, Potter's unbelievable sexiness, and the crème brûlée. It was just as well that he could only remember the good parts.
"He's gay, Potter," Parkinson announced from across the room.
Draco smiled at his companion, an unexpected warmth spreading from his heart. He tucked his fringe behind his ear with a faux air of casualness. "Of course we are. I possess the maturity to befriend my childhood nemesis."
After the war, Harry had reconciled with his feelings towards Snape. The revelations from Snape's memories had shaken him, and after discussions with Hermione and Ron, they had agreed that while Snape had been a hero who had tried to protect them in the long run, he had often times been flawed, vengeful and cruel.
"Draco, you can't give

, of course. Shrewdness without any of the inculcated underhanded means. You've come a long way, child. Now, let an old hat think."
Harry had worn out his friends' empathy half a month into the eighth year of school, and it was bad enough that Hermione and Ron would exchange

It was dark by the time they pulled up at Hogsmeade station, and Draco was disoriented from the nap that had crept up on him. Fumbling with his tie as he alighted the train, Draco trailed closely after Blaise with his head down.
"It's not that easy!" he snapped, his eyes warm from frustration.
“Seven days, Mr. Malfoy,” the Healer greeted. “Been a while, but your body is recovering well,” he said as he reviewed the results from his tests.
It was close to ten when they returned to castle, heading for the Hufflepuff common room. Draco ached all over from a brutal set of five Seeker games with Harry. The sky had gone dark by the end of the fourth set, but in trademark stubbornness, they had decided to continue with their last match to determine their respective superiority.
Malfoy blinked slowly at him, his lips slightly parted in obvious shock. “
"I would like to reiterate that Hogwarts has no tolerance for bullying. Please do not hesitate to inform any prefects, teachers or myself should you require any support, or have information of any happenings. The bullies will be dealt with accordingly." The Headmistress said sternly as her gaze swept across the Hall.
"What do you mean by new enemies?" Draco faked offence in an attempt to distract Harry. "I don't make enemies when I work."
Will need to tell Worry to not make me tea during breakfast. Too much tea makes me jittery.
"Motivated by spite and jealousy," Harry commented as he nuzzled against Draco's neck. Draco tensed when Harry suddenly paused. "They've sent you letters, haven't they? Don't read any of those rubbish. Those people are bloody mental." Harry turned him around to look straight at him. "If they do anything funny, forward it to the Aurors. I had a letter from Magical Menagerie that tried to bite my face off. It didn't have a magical trace, but I'll be watching them closely. Don't get yourself injured, okay?"
Malfoy's head shot up sharply. All private conversations ceased, the room falling silent as Malfoy narrowed his eyes at the bottle pointing at him, then his friend. "Truth," he said after a prolonged staring match. Everyone leaned in in anticipation.
Draco frowned as he flipped the page. Based on the catalysing factor of the Lady's Mantle, the book was supporting the fact that his latest potion should have worked.
Pansy continued without any concern, "You know, with Pepper being gone and all."
wanked under the same roof as your mother?" Harry asked with an eye roll.
"Wait, Malfoy," he called out as he tossed his tie onto his bed. He rattled off the series of spells Hermione had taught him to determine the safety of posts from strangers.
"Get a contract done up in the meantime, wouldn't you?" Blaise laughed derisively.
He fished for the note, his heart bursting in gratitude at the message.
He shot up quickly to the sight of more of his classmates on the floor. It was clear that Pansy had succeeded in her goal to eviscerate everyone.
Teddy twisted his left foot back and forth as he looked at the floor. "The cookies were calling me," he said quietly. "I don't want pasketti today."
"Can you imagine them working together for Potions?" Weasley asked as Potter pulled a face.
Thunderous had chronicled his romps in a dragon sanctuary, and as if it wasn't bad enough that Potter was consuming pure fiction masked in a veneer of professional experience (just slightly better than the hogwash Lockhart peddled in Second Year), Potter had opened the book to approximately the 23rd chapter of the book (Draco had absolutely
The seat beside Harry James Potter is empty. His finger continues to trace the diameter of the bottle mouth.
"Maybe murderous teachers is the common factor. It'll be a lot easier to pull off," Harry said, crumpling the note in his fist before he lobbed it vehemently at Malfoy. He smirked when it thwacked against Malfoy's fat head.
"It's a lot smaller than I expected,"  Harry said as he looked at the shop across the road.
"Test me? What do you mean?" Harry's brows creased as he stared at Draco. As he ran through Draco's comments from the past few days, he finally understood.
"Yeah, I name dropped to get a reservation."

"Miss Jones again?" Draco asked when Harry sighed morosely. He leaned against the couch as he peered at him in amusement.
This parallel universe was growing steadily more bizarre and he had no idea at which point it had spun out of control.
Harry checked the parchment paper edged with spilled ink. "Nope, it doesn't," he replied, pleased by the simplicity of his gift. It didn't indicate too much thought, and he quite liked Chocolate Frogs. It was a really good haul, in his opinion.
Draco hummed noncommittally. It wasn't a bad idea, per se; he had always found Hogwarts' education to be a bit lacking—he paused when he realised that he was thinking about his imaginary children with Harry. He flinched as he pulled his hand away.
"Cool!" Teddy breathed in awe as he reached to run his finger across what Draco knew to be a pink and ghastly scar. Draco had managed to isolate the plant's toxin and develop an antidote from the sample provided, and his feverishly gibbering patient had fully recovered after half a week of recuperation. The scar however, would take weeks to look better. Draco sighed, looking up at the startled laughter from his patient.
Oh, he had really done it now—he had proved to Draco that his work would come first even though he had tried so hard to be on his best behaviour. Harry pressed a hand to his temple in frustration. Pulling off his robe, he headed up the stairs to see Draco. Even though he had no excuses, there was no point in delaying the inevitable.
"Well, Potter. I'll do the planning, and you can do the portkey application because my mother gets dizzy taking Muggle trains." He grinned when Potter's face crumpled. "Come on, Potter. You can use your saviour of the wizarding world status. They'll fall over themselves to process your application."
Harry shook his hair out immediately, slightly embarrassed at having it pointed out so politely by Malfoy. It had been almost
"It's Potter, Finnigan. Potter's moral compass would put us all to shame." Parkinson piped up from her perch on the armrest beside Malfoy.
“The paper chronicling your stupidity." Harry said curtly as he sat up straighter. "I told you to send them cease and desist letters, and forward the nasty ones to the Aurors, didn’t I? But instead, what did you do?” Harry grabbed the newspaper that zoomed into the room, and hit him in one swift move.
think about constructing one on your own," she said sternly when she noticed Harry inspecting the metal badge of Hogwart's crest in awe.
Potter shook his head before looking at his book once more. "I'm thinking of going into magical home refurbishment," he said, his entire body language defensive as he rubbed his finger against the corner of the book. "I don't want to continue chasing bad guys, and I've found that I quite enjoy Charms."
Nonetheless, it was undeniable that Malfoy had been absolute rubbish at being a Death Eater. Despite Lucius' expectations, his villainous skills had never developed beyond insults, pranks, telltales and physical attacks. Likewise, Neville had told him that Malfoy had run interference by sending students to detention with Filch and playing up the humiliation of the tasks to satisfy the Carrows.
"Shut up! Shut up! This is going no where! I hereby ban all discussions about the discovery of Malfoy's sexuality and taunts about repressed emotions! Harry will figure things out when he figure things out! Pinkies
"Please hydrate before turning in!" Hermione called out as the crowd began to disperse.
Draco worried at his lips, removing his hands as he tucked them under his chin as if making himself smaller. “I don’t think that it’s a good idea. We wouldn’t want to ruin anyone’s day. Andromeda–” he said haltingly as if searching for the right words, “my mother didn’t end things well.”
"Wear this." Harry pressed himself flush against Draco as he reached for a cream-coloured jumper.
"To Draco," the tables returned as they clinked their drinks heartily. Sitting down after reaching across the table to meet Neville's steady glass, Draco kicked Blaise's foot sharply.
Swallowing the warm come in his mouth, Draco continued his ministrations, speeding up his own hand on his lap. He was so close. The sight of Harry keening underneath him finally pushed Draco over the edge, his mouth going slack as he moaned against Harry's cock.
The degree of Hermione's Hufflepuff-ness scared him sometimes. Draco froze when he suddenly remembered that he too was in Hufflepuff. Embracing emotions and labelling everything was incredibly exhausting.
"Malfoy, Draco!" The hall fell deathly silent, and Draco felt close to tears as he walked towards the stool. His heart was wild in his throat, his face too hot, and his stomach upset. Professor Vector dropped the hat onto his head.
"I've told you that it's fine! I'm happy to even be able to spend time with you, erm, to see Paris!"
"Are you feeling better?" He asked, biting his lip when Pansy's knee jerked. It was impossible to take back his question though, and it hung heavily between them. Harry tried to convey the sincerity he felt on his face.
Draco froze at his perceptiveness. "What do you mean?"
- - - - -
"I work in Magical Law Enforcement. Contracts are effective. I quite like it, actually," she said with a shrug.
"Fuck off, Malfoy," Harry slapped his uniform onto his bed.
"I'll write tonight if I have the time to. Tell Pansy whatever," Draco said with a wry smile as he flicked a privacy spell in the couple's direction before heading for the train. Nobody else needed to watch Pansy and Blaise rutting against each other like dogs in heat.
“It’s not so bad, huh,” Harry greeted when Draco finally returned to the seat beside him. The other Slytherins had dispersed, and Pansy was seated between Susan Bones and Lisa Turpin, their heads bent together in gossip.

"That won't stop me. I am the best at Documentation, Forms, and Filing." Harry thumbed his nose proudly. "So, do we agree on the terms of the bet?"
"She's soo sexy," Brocklehurst slurred as she wedged herself clumsily beside Padma, "and smart." Padma pressed her face into Brocklehurst's neck in embarrassment when Seamus led a rowdy toast to them.
"Is it fixed?" Draco asked anxiously as he tried to see the back of his head in the mirror.
"Thought your housekeeping spells would have improved."
"You quit the Aurors?" Draco repeated disbelievingly.
Potter raised an unimpressed brow. "Honestly, being Finch-Fletchley wouldn't be so bad would it? He's got things going for him, with or without sweets. It'd be quite nice, I think."
The ill-timing of Pansy's remark with Potter's presence was not lost on Draco. He pulled his friend forward towards the train, only for her to hold her ground.
conversation wasn't painful, and interests converged. Most importantly, he would have been adequately affected if the Dark Lord had suddenly resurrected and AK-ed them. The revelation had left Draco sleepless, having grown up with all the people he
wanted to make sure that you liked your gifts, and then I didn’t know how to stop afterwards.” He looked at Draco nervously as he tried to gauge his reaction, despairing when he caught nothing on Draco’s stiff face.
"I wouldn't put it past you," Harry huffed. "You'd do anything to make sure that I don't win."
It was unfortunate that between his work and the general anxiety of an imminent humiliation by Potter, he had not come up with the terribly obvious solution on his own. He could have otherwise skipped the messy conversation where Pansy had insisted that he had
Harry laughed when he received a kick to his ankle–he couldn't help but wonder if this was what being free felt like–the infinite possibilities before him, only worrying about when he would next see his significant other, and the impulse to fuck all of his responsibilities and do whatever his brain demanded.
Harry laid the back of his hand on his forehead. He really needed to figure this out even at the expense of his life.
"Library," Ron immediately looked away when he met Harry's eyes.
Draco was disappointed by the lack of sympathy he received. Blaise had advised him to apologise, if not to maintain the advantageous connection he had with Harry Potter.
friend says things like these. And you wonder why Andromeda never brought us together." He rolled his eyes again for punctuation. "She fears that she would have two children on her hands if we met."
Draco couldn’t bring himself to say that the day could never come. It was hard for society to embrace him, and he was—despite his desire to atone for his mistakes by constructively contributing to society as a Healer, or an Auror—most likely to become Lord of the Manor like his father, grandfather, and great grandfather had been.
Settling in with Blaise, Pansy, and Greg, they talked about the real world with Longbottom and Abbott. It was fascinating, but Draco was more focused on watching Ginny arguing with Harry.
"You better continue with that. Leave the less important things to me," Draco said quickly as he burrowed his legs deeper with a smirk. He tore the envelope open.
Harry scribbled down his reproach before tossing it at Ron surreptitiously. Ron really shouldn't typecast Malfoy simply because of his poncey hair and dress sense when Harry also had the similar
Draco bit his bottom lip as he observed Potter's easy confidence as he engaged the other man. Potter was really incredibly sexy, he thought idly to himself as he watched Potter's capable hands stack the menus. Draco imagined them tracing his body.
- Watch public information campaigns
"If I what," Harry pressed.
Draco checked the mail and sorted them accordingly. Half of the scathing letters went to his bedside table for light reading, while the rest remained on his desk. Then there were the booby traps for careful unwrapping and intellectual stimulation. He marvelled at the remaining three letters that were supposedly polite.
- Bill - George
Harry blinked, unable to deny the request, much less when Draco looked so pathetic. He settled down in the cramped bed, biting his lip when Draco pulled him closer. His body was responding in excitement to the proximity, but it was such an inappropriate moment.
"Are you okay?" Malfoy bumped against him lightly as they walked out of the Great Hall.
"You're going to shower without opening it?" Harry asked in disbelief. "I can't believe it! Malfoy, this is serious! I
"They're your friends, too," Harry said, staring intently at his drink as he trailed his finger around its rim.
6. Eager when you approach them
"Indeed," Malfoy agreed evenly. "I guess that pastel
Harry smacked himself in the forehead, wincing when it connected more soundly than he had intended. He hadn't even informed Draco that he wouldn't be able to make it.
"Yeah, I will be. It'll be a quiet evening. Before the Dark Lord's return, my family would throw a lavish Christmas party every year." He shrugged to himself as Potter started to list against him on the sofa.
Catching Harry's eyes, he directed his friend a look of concern, frowning when the other looked away quickly.
"Anyway, shouldn't the both of you be on first names already?" Hermione asked when the laughter subsided.
with the Marauders.
"You're terribly easy to please," Malfoy commented as he summoned his clothes for his shower.
He reached for Draco’s hand, only to stop himself. He was frightened about how Draco might react.
Harry huffed as everyone laughed at his expense. He pulled his hand out of Malfoy's to have a proper go at sulking.
Ron stared at him in disbelief. “Bloody hell,” he complained as he searched his robes, unshrinking the present as he pulled out. He handed it over to Harry perfunctorily, “how did you even know?”
Potter looked back and forth between him and the cufflinks. "Thanks," he said quietly, his eyes heavy with sincerity as he closed the box carefully. "I'm glad that you trust me with your secret, and that we're speaking again.” He combed a nervous finger through the side of his hair, stopping when he reached the base of his bun. “I've really missed you these few weeks, you know? I've gone round the bend. I actually missed your snotty comments." He laughed when Draco smiled shamelessly.
“I’ll buy you lunch if you do as well, or better than Hermione in NEWTs,” Harry said suddenly without opening his eyes.
to be a reality, surely that was too much? But the arrows were humming against his skin, eager to please, desperate to be used.
After they had visited the Arc de Triomphe (Draco had managed to wrestle Potter into submission to take the underpass instead of dashing across the road), Potter had mentioned that it had been his first time being successful at sightseeing. Draco had learnt that Potter had an abysmal sense of direction and would always get lost whenever he ventured out alone. Taking pity, Draco had shared that he would be looking to purchase some toys for Teddy. Would he like to join? Perhaps they could grab dinner and visit the Eiffel Tower afterwards?
Draco had begun exploring Muggle religions to ensure that he could provide the emotional support the patients' parents might need. It was an interesting branch of knowledge to him. He now understood why some of the Muggleborns his year had called out to God in exclamation.
It was a goal much too lofty in Draco's opinion. Firstly, it was simply impossible to remember seven other people's resolutions, and secondly, they would all be too polite to point out each others’ failures. Lastly, her boyfriend hadn't even thought about the entire activity, which in his opinion,
"It’d be crazy," Potter shook his head as he placed his wand between the pages. "We would be working together and–" he shuddered.
"Well, maybe Andie told you," Potter retorted, shortness evident in the stubborn set of his jaw even as the tension in his shoulders loosened.
"Doesn't St Mungo's have a common intake for all of their trainee healers?" Girl Weasley interrupted. "Julie Whithall was talking about it," she explained when everyone looked at her in surprise.
"That's not true," Harry said hotly, unthinkingly clenching his fists in frustration. "You deserve more than that! You'll be able to find someone who would love you!"
"You better take emotional responsibility for Harry's misery! He's talking about how maybe you guys weren't even friends, and that he shouldn't be clinging on to something that wasn't even there! I swear to Salazar that I will quarter you if you don't do something!" Weasley bit out, his eyes wild with fury. Draco tried desperately to not flinch at the F word, but failed miserably as usual.
"Fine," Draco finally relented after staring at him for a bit longer. "I've gotten a few books for Mother from the next shop."
," Draco yelled, at the same time as time as Hermione said, "
Draco hummed in agreement. "I heard about the game yesterday."
"Truth or dare, Potter?" Parkinson asked with a smirk.
"You could make him run errands for you," Ron said.
Ron shrugged when he looked at him questioningly, “I only get sane letters, nothing of the proposals or underwear sort. I guess that I have Hermione, you know. They know better than to trifle with her. And I’m an Auror.”
"Admiration letters, love potions, wedding proposals and the like. Mine sort of stopped when Hannah and I got together," Nevile shrugged.
my Achilles heel.”
! He was so preoccupied with his thoughts that he had unknowingly walked off the stage with the Hat on until it had chuckled on him.
"Are you coming?" He asked Harry pointedly when he had flung the door open.
Likewise, Hermione did not hold back - "Harry's not wrong, you know? You don't even tell me things, and we're supposed to be friends," Hermione gave Draco a pointed look when he shifted uncomfortably at the F word.
"Might be a Harry Potter thing," he said wryly.
Draco shook himself off as he tore the present open clumsily. He blinked at the note in surprise. "Harry, look! Let's go ice-skating!" He ran over to jostle him when he failed to get the attention that he desired.
"Merlin's tits, Potter. Where is your sensibility? Many rights do not make a wrong right, Potter!" Draco said, his company falling silent as they tried to comprehend the statement.
Malfoy gaped at Ron. "Oh, honestly!" He scoffed as he threw Harry's hand out of his with an eye roll. "It's not that bad. Your gifts were probably overly thoughtful. They'll love you even more or something," he said as he wedged himself unceremoniously between Harry and Ron on the loveseat.
"Of course," she replied evenly as Harry surveyed the surroundings once more with a renewed perspective.
Harry puffed his cheeks as he weighed his options. He worried about his coordination if he had to get up, but then again, it would probably worsen throughout the night. However, he
I know that you wouldn't write to me so quickly if you didn't have the time, but I worry that I am taking too much of your time. How's your research coming along?
As usual, I enjoyed our Wednesday dinner. Shall we have Indian food next week for a change?
Malfoy's brows creased in consideration. "Yeah, that's pretty awful. I hope that they're not too big a fan of Harry Potter," he pat Harry's shoulder comfortingly. Harry's stomach only sank further. The problem was that his giftee–Malfoy himself–wasn't too big a fan of Harry Potter in the first place.
However, the realisation of his lack of qualifications for the application had left Draco in a bout of depression. He was not a team player, empathetic, particularly reliable, exceptionally compassionate, nor excellent in customer service. And to top everything off, he was at a complete lack of credible references to substantiate his character even if he chose to make up an entirely fictitious personality of himself. His godfather had been murdered by a megalomaniac, and he had orchestrated an infiltration of his school.
"Yeah, your swotty '
on display!"
Lifting the filter, Draco poured the water into the teacups. His mind cleared as he lost himself to the ritual.
"No, honestly! I mean, you were such a cunt previously." He jogged to catch up with Malfoy. "
"Oh, it's midnight," Narcissa said suddenly when the music of the movie swelled. He made a curious sound as he tore his eyes away to look at the clock.
"You can't keep skipping lunch all the time," Harry complained. "Malfoy," he called out, kicking the other's leg under the table when Malfoy didn't look up. "Malfoy, it's lunch," he repeated, laughing when a stinging hex bounced off his Protego.
"Bollocks.
Judging by Potter's casual confidence as he skimmed the menu, it was evident how much Potter had changed from his school days. The past Potter would not have been comfortable releasing a sexy calendar that solely relied on his popularity for sales, nor would he have been at ease in a fairly upscale restaurant, much less a foreign one. And Draco was certain that he wouldn't have gamely spent time shopping to get a new blazer just for dinner.
"That's cheating. You're supposed to make alliterations with the noun," Malfoy complained after rolling and then swallowing his whiskey.
"Yep," Harry agreed with a wide smile as he tossed two Frogs onto Malfoy's bed, before levitating the rest to his schoolbag. He would give some out tomorrow and open the rest with Ron. Ron had been missing an Elphias Doge card for the longest time.
Malfoy groaned sharply when he noticed Harry's distraction. "Get yourself together, Potter. We'll chat again during dinner."
Harry smoothed his thumb against the back of Draco's hand as he looked at Draco fondly, quietly excited for the times to come. Setting aside the soiled handkerchief from Draco, he paused at the hand on his arm.
"Thank you, Parkinson," Hermione said coolly as she gestured at everyone to take a seat. She placed the bottle in the middle of the circle. "No forfeits, no bullying, no mentions about the war, and please be reasonable in your truth or dares. Most importantly, everything said or done here stays here. Neville, Lisa and I will be the judge of whether the questions are reasonable. Parkinson will start, since she gets things done."
"Why did you do that!" he complained, swiping at his cheek and howling when the red of Pansy's lipstick showed on his grey glove.
Draco's blood rushed south at the sight. It was an image worthy of the charity calendar in his cupboard, and the past six months' images flashed through his mind, mixing with the unintentional seductiveness of an amused Potter. Fuck, he shot up quickly, ramming against Potter's arm that had strangely reached over him. Draco fell backwards on his head.
Harry Potter
Draco was cheerily signing out a patient when he suddenly heard a stream of childish laughter and the chant of his name at the top volume. "Please fill this out, Mr Dearborn. I will be back with you shortly," he said curtly before dashing off.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut, wishing that Potter would stop emphasising the number of extras. He had initially ignored the quantifiers, only to understand that he had misjudged Hermione's marketing gimmicks when he received the calendar. Taking six owls to deliver due to the anti-tamper spells, it was close to two metres wide and more than three metres tall. Draco had been giddy when he laid eyes on the special cover of his edition.
Parkinson rolled her eyes as she blew at her fingernails. "What did your Father say the last time he saw you?"
"I do love you more than the calendar-you in my head," he said seriously, hoping that Harry would understand what he meant. "You're more than the boy from school and the Quidditch player on the wireless," he continued, honesty falling from his lips without forethought. He was first in love with insufferable Gryffindor that would right everything, the godfather that played blocks with Teddy through his "Smash Teddy" phase, the seeker that flew with a crazed, single minded purpose, and the man that oozed careless sex appeal in front of the camera, but he was now in love with the Harry Potter that couldn't wake up in the mornings and wore clothes to bed because he was worried about sagging balls.
Harry read the note lazily. Draco and him had gone for a walk on the grounds in a fit of insanity a few days ago, and he had noticed that the Great Lake had frozen over. It had been ages since he had last skated, and he still had fond memories of the break they had between Quirrell and Snape's antics. Hoping that Draco would be able to have fun with his friends, he had asked Hermione for the spell she had previously used for their shoes.
Person does not recognise Harry Potter!!!!!!
Harry had been so willing to accommodate Draco that he hadn't questioned it. But alas, he hadn't budged on Draco’s single request.
They were both interrupted by a clap on Harry’s shoulder. Harry swivelled around sharply, taken aback by the sight of Goyle in a dusty, frilly, pink apron, a streak of white powder on his face. Goyle was smiling widely at him.
"You must have been a very good boy this year, Blaise," Malfoy said quietly to his friend as he looked at the glazed expression on Seamus' face. Malfoy raised a brow in question when Harry continued to stare at him instead of reaching for the hat.
Draco wet his lips as he subtly looked around their table, hoping that nobody else was paying attention to the trainwreck that was happening. He made a face when he caught a piteous look from a dark haired girl. Nonetheless, Draco had really brought it upon himself, as usual.
P.P.S. I really like the name of the B&B. It's genius.
Conjuring cushions for his back, Draco floated his book and pulled out the flask of tea that Worry had prepared for him. Removing his shoes, he sighed contentedly as he folded his legs. Tracing his last position on the page of text, the cabin door suddenly opened and he bolted upright, wand at the ready.
"Are you up for classes today?" He asked.
Parkinson stood up with a loud sigh. "Bloody fucks!" She yelled as she wrenched the both of them apart forcefully.
"Second present?" Harry repeated in confusion, looking up from his shoes. Harry had gathered all of his willpower to sit through Potions with Malfoy, and now that it was over, he was back to obsessing about Malfoy's familial obligations post-war.

going to find your exchange partner?” Draco asked pointedly as he raised his brows.
"That's PEE! You're piss, Malfoy," Harry stumbled as he doubled over, laughing.

Except he didn't even know why he wanted to see Potter so badly. Sure, Potter was fun, but so was Pansy, if you could take the acerbic humor. Sure, Potter was sexy, but so was Blaise, especially when he dialled his charm up to eleven. Maybe it was the effortlessness of Potter? The careless intensity of the man was pretty nice. Or maybe because Potter was a mix of both his best friends. Thinking about it always left Draco incredibly confused, which contributed to his avoidance of the matter entirely.
Thank you.
"There's nothing noble about supporting a competitor. They also copied the neon line remember?" Ginny said hotly.
undermined her credibility.

"Four, of course," Malfoy replied distractedly as he began to scribble away on his organiser.
Draco tried to look as understanding as possible. "Alright, I'll let you both go just this once, okay? If I catch any of you harassing Potter again, I will be deducting house points. Potter has expressly stated his desire to live a normal student life, and the both of you would do well to respect him."
Potter blinked at him in shock. "I just realised it yesterday," he said slowly, looking at Draco in complete disbelief.
Draco stared at him incredulously, lips twitching from the force of controlling his laughter. He compensated by making a show of focusing on his mille crêpe.
in fact." He teased, bringing up the nonsensical portmanteau coined by The Prophet that had unfortunately stuck. What would happen to the fans of Potter's athletic career if he left the Arrows? Honestly.
1. Pretend to not notice, do not treat them differently from other students unless it gets too bad. How bad is too bad? Ask Draco!!!
"Bloody Pansy," he groaned as he stared at the ceiling.
"That's an unfortunate stereotype," Draco tutted. If only Hermione had been around to lecture Potter, Draco thought idly as he picked his quill up, remembering what he had wanted to write. "Perhaps you could ask Weasley, the real Slytherin among all of us." Honestly, had Blaise not finally gotten together with Pansy, he would have been fucking him instead of writing letters to Pansy. In fact, Draco’s celibacy was hardly by choice, was it? Terry Boot had also settled down with that dull as a flobberworm Lisa Turpin, which was such a shame in his opinion. Turpin wasn't even smart enough to be a Ravenclaw to begin with, and how could one be contented with missionary sex after a foray into BDSM?
“Do you prefer French cuisine?” Harry mused, his voice airy as if his mind was already somewhere else.
"That's complete rubbish! It's okay. It's okay to feel lost and defeated sometimes. Life isn't that easy, you know?"
"What does that mean!" Harry sputtered as he rushed to follow Draco. "I'm not the one who likes cookies, Draco!"
“Of course.”
Harry pulled Malfoy out of the way of a particularly vicious looking purple jinx, expelling the student's wand before immobilising her. The scuffle was over as quickly as it started.
Harry nodded as he looked at Draco’s legs intently. “I’ve torn my Achilles tendon four times—the left one,” he clarified. He wondered about the coincidences that they had yet to uncover.
In a fit of insanity comparable to the Headmistress', Draco sent an apologetic look to Blaise before thumping his bag down beside Potter with a wide smile for Professor Slughorn. "Elixir to induce euphoria today, sir? One of Potter's best, isn't it?"
Casting a discreet Tempus when he noticed some of the crowds dispersing, Draco sighed when he saw that it was a little after ten. "I think that we've just missed the ten o'clock light show," he mumbled to himself in disappointment, yelping when he received a sharp jab to his side.
"To Harry's hot and hearty beverage," he clinked their glasses together.
"Anyway, I think that your gifter is brilliant. Can you tell me whenever you receive more gifts? I'd like to see them too," Harry asked as he pulled his spectacles off carelessly before setting it aside.
"Oh, it's the Golden Trio," Blaise remarked idly when the crowd parted to let the war heroes past.
Pushing the door to his own bedroom open, Harry felt his heart twinge at the sight of Draco asleep on his bed. Draco was still in one of the blazers that he favoured, his bare feet hanging off the end of the mattress. It was obvious that he had fallen asleep reading, the front of his reading glasses pressing uncomfortably against his nose as he snored lightly, his hand curled loosely on a French book.
"I wanted to give you a surprise. This is my third gift for you," he smiled widely at Draco, his heart full from making his lover so happy.
He cast a quick Tempus, groaning at the time.
? I think it's
"Where's Gandie?" He asked lightly as he bounced his cousin on his hip, using the portmanteau favoured by his cousin for Grandmother Andromeda. Two weeks ago, Andromeda had mentioned about Teddy's upcoming annual appointment to check for potential symptoms of lycanthropy.
“Karma really does go round, doesn’t it?” Harry joked, flailing when Draco pinched his nose roughly.
“How about yourself, Ron? Are
"My pranks aren't as straightforward as this," Draco complained. "This is an insult of the highest order."
"My name?"
“You do. I bet that the pot costs a few galleons,” Malfoy insisted as he cleared his work away.
Don't be an arse. Would chicken tikka masala be good? If yes, you can bring the plain yogurt and boneless chicken thighs. I have all the spices in the kitchen.
"Yeah, dealing with both Teddy and you at the same time would be awful." Potter nodded grimly as he reached for the basket of bread between them.
"—to get a broom for Teddy." Draco blinked as he caught only the end of Potter's speech. He scowled at the man.
"Erm, I'll get whatever you're having," Potter blurted.
"You forgot my pyjamas," he pointed out quietly, still embarrassed at being so easily read.
Potter pouted at the sarcasm. He didn’t know that the statement wasn't too far from the truth. "Are you going for dinner?" He suddenly asked as they crawled towards their common room.
"You'll have to make it up to me then," Draco said, smiling sweetly as he threaded his fingers between Harry's.
"Cute enough to help me dry my hair forever?"
Harry laughed as he slung his pyjamas over shoulder, heart skipping when Malfoy smiled at him.
"Lunch?" He asked with an eye roll.
Malfoy suddenly broke out into a grin. "It's complete rubbish," he said, finishing his whiskey at a single go.
Draco returned the other's smile shakily, still tender from the expectation of being rejected by Potter again. Fuck Potter and his own fanboy desperation. Overcome with a sudden bout of exhaustion, Draco experienced an overwhelming desire to retreat under his covers. The day had gone on for too long.
"Giving it a miss," Draco replied, already excited to read about the outcomes of Muggles conducting barbaric experiments on smaller animals in the name of research.
Malfoy scoffed. "I'm sorry, but this requires too much cunning or information about–oh.
doing it."
"But–" he whispered in reply as he held onto her arm tightly.
Harry cleaned his teeth when he was done. "Teeth," he instructed as he rested his hand on Malfoy's arm.
"I'm sorry. I'm an arse. The biggest arse ever," Draco said quietly while Harry tried to count his breaths so that he would not lose his temper and throttle Draco.
"Pansy used to be attracted to Hermione," Malfoy pulled him down to whisper messily into his ear as Pansy bowed to her appreciative audience.
"A good name?" Neville asked in concern.
"Of course. We'll review the contract tomorrow?"
What a juvenile mistake, Draco thought as he sunk back into his bed, exhausted from how high maintenance Gryffindor
He had then let slip during dinner with the Slytherins that Malfoy had received the ugliest jumper he had ever seen, and everything had fallen into place afterwards. With an ugly sweater in compliance with the dress code, Draco no longer had any reason to skip the Eighth Year's Mid-week Party. Organised by the Gryffindors, it was the first party of the year, and almost all of the returning eighth years had turned up.
"Draco volunteers to go next," Harry piped up cheerily when Draco returned his jab.
"Erm," Harry began guiltily. He had subscribed to the medical research journal that Malfoy often published his papers in since Hermione had mentioned it in passing years ago, and he would always skim the content page of the quarterly publication before tossing it out when it didn't have anything from Malfoy. He had the exact journals that Narcissa had on her shelves, and would often travel with one of the four copies as a sleeping aid. "Maybe?" He said sheepishly.
"Erm, what do you want to talk about?" Potter asked as he shifted in his seat.
"Can I?" Potter whispered, soft as a sigh, breath brushing Draco's upper lip as his thumb smoothed over Draco's cheekbones. Draco felt his limbs go slack as a noise of consent escaped from his throat. Potter leaned in carefully, their mouths pressing against each other's lightly. Draco let out a soft moan when Potter's tongue brushed against his lips. Draco pushed his fingers across Potter's jaw and into the man's hair as he parted his lips. The kiss was slow, unhurried, yet passionate.
Harry nodded vigorously as he looked down the Gryffindor table in warning. Ron had shared that the Headmistress was still investigating the case to gather more information. Walters had been suspended, while the other students had been put on probation for the time being. The prefect also had her badge stripped.
to finish it as soon as possible before the entire Auror department crumbled to dust.
The arduous owl deliveries had been replaced by a glossy, carved wooden box to hold messages, and his mentors had whittled down to one. The exchange with his fifth cousin once removed had given him more information to understand the existence of gods, and an avenue for questions regarding their inheritance.
"We'll be sitting with the Slytherins tomorrow." Hermione decided.
"If you're talking about me, please be reminded that
Draco looked at Harry in shock and disbelief, taken aback by Harry's accuracy—the letters would now come whenever he was photographed in Wizarding public, and four times a week of hate messages was getting too much for him. He quickly schooled his features to one of skepticism. "What trouble can I get into?"
since the war began, and fuelled by the Muggle concept of parallel universes, he had traced out crucial points where the trajectories of his present and parallel selves had split – his sorting had been one of them.
1. Staying back to ask questions that can be easily found in textbooks
2. Purchasing Hogwarts related merchandise

"Thanks for sending us off," Draco said to Greg just as Blaise's hand snuck up Pansy hemline. "Do well, and if you require any research, I'll still be available, okay?" Draco's voice was thick with emotion, and the unsaid words hung between them. He had never cared much for Greg nor Vincent previously, but Greg's selfless loyalty even after Draco had lost his status post-war had brought them closer. He would miss his friend very much. He made to leave before reaching for a hug that was tightly returned.
"Shut up."
"Thank you Draco." Hermione beamed as he suppressed the urge to groan. Hermione had written to all of them on the last day of the year, urging them to make a list of New Year's resolutions that followed the SMART guidelines, being – specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time bound. Requesting that they share during the train ride back to Hogwarts, Hermione had reminded all of their friends to help each other achieve their resolutions.
Thank you for planning so much! And the accommodation of my preference for Muggle styles.
. Harry pressed his face into his hands so that he would not burst into tears of frustration.
At least Potter's lack of subtlety was heartwarmingly familiar. Draco raised an eyebrow in challenge.
Harry leaned in to press a quick kiss on the underside of Draco’s jaw before returning to his plate with a pleased smile.
"No, I'm not. There's no dress code for staff. I've read the handbook thrice." And so he had—in between the sleepless nights, more awake than excited, he had reviewed his lesson plans and read everything relevant to calm his nerves. He had also learnt finally that
"Converting to the nudist lifestyle?"
"What's that?" Harry asked as he got up from his bed. "Is your hair even long enough?" He pretended to ask, as if he hadn't noticed Malfoy constantly pushing his hair back the past few weeks. It was currently slightly past his shoulders.
She fell silent and they continued walking. "Enough about them. What about you? I saw how Potter was practically fawning over you just now. Do you have anything that you would like to share?"
"Sexual proclivities?" Harry repeated in confusion. He was simply too smashed to spend time figuring out Malfoy's poncey vocabulary.
Harry was massaging Draco's feet when the letter arrived. The month-long period of the courtship had passed, but Harry had yet to give his third present, and Draco had made no mentions of it. Their arrangement had continued without any discussion, and the opportunity to watch Draco while being aware of the truth had made him realise how unfit he was to don the Auror robes.
Draco was still reeling when they walked into Luna.
"It's alright. You're a curse breaker now, aren't you?" She asked as she gestured for him to follow her. "Perhaps you could work on improving it during your spare time? Draco tried his best but I'm sure that it's not quite up to your standard."
“Huh,” Draco mumbled as he inspected the vials that before him.
Harry looked at Malfoy uneasily, distinctly wrong-footed. Was he supposed to laugh?  Did they make jokes about their younger selves? Where had Malfoy disappeared to all these years? Why did he have to visit Greg?

"Pansy, I would wish that you had more faith that I did not do anything bad."
Draco shrugged. In the immediate aftermath of the war, when the magical community had shunned them for the parts they had played, the Slytherins had closed ranks in both support and commiseration. His family's trials had just ended and they had gathered in Blaise's house, worrying about their gloomy prospects when Pansy had gotten frustrated by their pessimism, enquiring if her friends were going to be like the rest of the school in questioning her judgement. All of them had frozen up then, but eventually they had learnt to take their past follies in stride. Had all of them not grown up to become better people? Were they not capable of seeing the wrongs in their past decisions? Then why should they be taken hostage by the erumpent in the room?
The deep resignation on Harry's face dissolved momentarily when he looked up to wave the gratitude away. Countless of interdepartmental memos and updates had come in overnight, and he was busy reading them.
"Malfoy doesn't like apples like this," he mumbled, pushing the fruit away as he watched both his friends exchange unwarranted, significant glances again.
He frowned at his tart in disappointment when he realised that he had finished half without properly tasting.
Harry nodded, startling when Draco blinked and then started to cry.
"Pansy said—er-" Draco attempted unsuccessfully, having lost his entire train of thought, flushing harder when Harry started to smooth his thumb across the back of his hand.
He continued petting Draco as his sobs slowly subsided into sniffles. “Do you want to lie down?” Harry asked quietly as he pulled back. His heart ached at the miserable sight before him–Draco’s eyes were bloodshot, his face blotchy and mottled, his nose a dull red.
Harry shrugged as he shifted in his seat. "She's in Indonesia looking for creatures."
, you could feed me."
Draco’s stomach clenched at the power in his hands. If the war had taught him anything, it was that as the line of Malfoys before him, he could not be trusted with power. His greed was too much. His hands were shaking as he swept the arrows into the bag, pausing when he noticed its stiffness.
Harry's brows creased at the suggestion.
Reaching into the drawer quickly to grab one of the gifted bottles, he lobbed it at Malfoy's head, scowling when Malfoy snatched it out of the air without looking up.
"I could beg," Harry said as he pulled his dark green sweatshirt off, making an annoyed noise when his shirt refused to stay down. "What," he asked when he noticed Malfoy staring. He rearranged his crooked spectacles.
"Could you get it for me?" Harry asked Draco as he worked on his calves.
"Like you and the spiteful letters. That's a whole new crazy."
"Alright, see you tonight. Neville can hardly fly, much less play Beater and fly at the same time. Don't miss me too much when you win," he joked as he brushed past his friend, heading for the common room's poorly designed exit.
“What newspaper?” Draco asked when they were finally alone.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at him. He cast a suspicious look at Harry's mop of hair before transfiguring the gift wrapper to a mirror. "It's not too bad," he said in surprise, pouting when he noticed the loose strand of hair.
” he read aloud as he peered at Harry over the paper.
"Oh, the laundromat—makes me grateful to have magic. People are so chatty in there for some reason," he shuddered as he quickened his pace.
"What are you guys doing here," Harry asked as Ron complained, "

"Yeah, erm, I was worrying about having the whole Harry Potter is your gifter conversation," he said, knowing better than to lie. He had embraced the fact that he was
A blush crept across Draco's cheeks as he picked at his plate. “I’ll try my best to fit you into my social calendar.”
"Not when Malfoy's the one giving us a white Christmas!" Terry Boot said while the other eight years started to pick sides.
"Harry James Potter, do you permit the proprietor to disclose details of your stay at the property to Draco Lucius Malfoy?" Draco said gravely.
Missing you always!
The boy's lips curved into a smirk. "That's great, Finnegan. I've always wanted to have a threesome with Gryffindors," he winked lasciviously as he nodded at Dean. "I'll unwrap you gently," he said as he mimed peeling something.
"Do you have nothing to say to your trustworthy, intelligent and occasionally spiteful Potioneer?"
"Expecting to come all over your coat more often?" Draco asked as he banished his soiled pants to the hamper.
, the most powerful burn salve on the market and had made strides in the field of nerve regeneration and trauma management potions. As usual, even his concoctions at discovery stages were incredibly effective—Harry held no bitterness at the knowledge. After a particularly bad explosion during one of his earlier missions, he would have been left for dead had it not been for
It did not escape Draco that the Chosen One had forgotten about the streak of ingenuity he had previously with regards to the mint leaf. As expected, beyond the fluke in sixth year, Potter was but a below average Potions student.
"No," Harry blurted as with a sharp shake of his head. "No, I'm fine," he repeated, looking strangely frightened as Draco frowned at him in scrutiny.
"Thanks," Harry tore the wrapper off hurriedly when it was clear. Honestly, couldn't he had gotten a more enthusiastic gift partner like himself? It would be nice to get gifts more often.
"Yes?" Draco asked impatiently, suddenly relishing in punishing Potter when he had been so desperate for his company the entire day. "I thought that you had finally deigned to talk to me?"
"The Triwizard competition?" Potter asked.
"What?" Harry said hotly. "Malfoy doesn't!"
Harry nodded and tried his best to look as earnest as possible. He wondered if he could schedule a chat with Malfoy beforehand just to satisfy his curiosity.
The conversation had dissolved to smaller ones again when Harry elbowed him in the rib. "What did Pansy do?"
"Then what will Harry and I eat for dinner?"
Ron shook his head as he moved on to the log cakes. “Maybe you should ask your boyfriend.”
"Why didn't you wait up?"
Draco pulled back to slap his significant other on the chest. "It's for charity," he repeated. "Also, everyone was getting one. As a Malfoy, I needed to outdo everyone," he said haughtily, bursting into laughter with his lover.
"Are you meeting Parkinson today?" Potter asked suddenly as they descended the flight of stairs.
Draco set his dessert down with a noisy sigh and an exaggerated eye roll. "It
Harry felt his heart ache from the sheer fondness he was experiencing. He squeezed Draco's hand tightly for want of an outlet to convey his emotions.
. You've been doing this since forever," he said. "
"There's dough here, too." Draco pointed to the corner of Teddy's mouth, laughing when the boy's hand immediately flew to his face to remove the evidence. "It's still there."
Draco was in good spirits. He had just sent out the results of the final session of Documentation, Forms, and Filing, and Harry had scored full marks on the final paper–ten marks higher than the second highest scorer. Curiosity had been Harry's greatest motivator—he had sat right in front of the class, listened raptly, memorised the meagre class notes, and set up his own
“Well, Harry’s an Auror, too,” Draco said hotly.
Harry snapped out of his fixation at the lovebites on Draco's neck. He quickly ran after Draco. Instead of obsessing over what had happened between the endless shots, he needed something to do.
?" He accused suddenly as he jabbed his long, pointy finger against Harry's shoulder.
As Hermione relaxed before pondering about his question, Draco wondered if he was supposed to triplicate his letters in future. He would send one to Pansy, one to Hermione, and the last to Potter, who was always so strangely obsessed with him.
Hermione pinked at her boyfriend's confidence in her. "I don't think so though," she replied, looking skittishly at Draco from the corner of her eye.
"Thanks."
"I've been dabbling a little. It's been a while since I've had so much time on hand, you know?" She looked at Draco who smiled at her encouragingly. She had mentioned picking up baking materials in her letters, but he hadn't been aware that there was an
“Second, third, fourth, and fifth years move along!" She continued with a lantern in hand. The confusion was palpable as an unusually large crowd gathered around Hagrid, who was speaking cheerfully to a bunch of sixth years.
Harry offered a nod when Malfoy seemed expectant. He didn't want to start blabbering about his bad decisions to another Malfoy. "Erm, I'm worried that I won't like the job."
"Harry Potter!" He announced as he pounced on Harry, "I'm your Secret Santa, Harry! Harry I love you!" He made noisy kissing noises over a squirming Harry, while the Hufflepuff girls looked on with poorly concealed jealousy.
"Are you okay?" Harry asked quietly as the started to walk. After Malfoy's comment about his 'cronies' during their first class as Potions partners, Harry had been reminded about his map, and had taken to virtually stalk Malfoy again. Within a few days, he had noticed Walters and his rotation of buddies surrounding Malfoy and he had finally figured out the reason for Malfoy's previous limps. The knowledge that his schoolmates were bullying Malfoy set him on edge. It was the exact bigotry that had perpetuated the war.
Draco looked up in confusion as Weasley elbowed Potter, who had been reading about weed removal in magical gardens and houses.
“Maybe you shouldn’t pair with Hermione for projects. It’d be easier to see who’s smarter if your results weren’t tied to one another’s.”
"Mate, here," Ron said as he set an apple before Harry forcefully. "Give this to Malfoy later during Transfiguration."
"Erm, I need to wee," Harry burst out as he hopped off his stool and rushed off.
–he had been so frightened that he would scare Draco away then, but they were so much closer now. In fact, he was instead worried that he would be lost without Draco over the holidays. As much as he loved Hermione and Ron, he did not look forward to being left out as they spent time being affectionate during the festive season.
Draco nodded as silence returned between them.
"Well it's definitely not those for sure, but I mean—" Potter looked straight at Draco. "Finch-Fletchley managed to get a proper date with you, which definitely counts as something in my book."
"Alright," he said while Scourgifying his legs just in case. Because of his injury, he had been confined in the house, but despite being in close quarters for more than a week, their relationship had managed to flourish. Harry would spend his time reading the novels she had, try his best to paint landscapes with her in the vast fields, and trade stories about their lives over tea. If he disregarded the ache in his leg and the deep sorrow he nursed over his persistent singlehood, he otherwise felt like a child, and it was an unfamiliar but welcome experience. It was novel to have an adult figure so focused on his well being. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were always distracted by their chores, children, and hobbies, while Dumbledore saw him more as a means to an end, more preoccupied with obfuscation than to care for him. Remus was too haunted by his losses and his furry little problem to think about him. For Harry, Narcissa was the Sirius that he could have had. Ravaged by Azkaban, his godfather would often lose himself within his mind, but he had tried to make Harry happy, in as much that he could. Nowadays, Harry fell asleep jealous of Malfoy's luck.
"I'm just saying," Pansy shrugged, "that you should let yourself feel for once, and stop doing this whole
They had been assigned atmospheric spells for Charms, and Draco was pleased that it had turned out to be significantly less boring than he had expected. Perhaps they could rennact to their duel in class next week? It would surely bag them a score higher than Ron and Hermione’s cooking spells.
Your favourite fashion correspondent was doing a bit of shopping at Oxford Street when she spotted our favourite Auror, 23, having breakfast with the Wizarding World's most infamous blond.
"Oh!" Harry exclaimed when he saw his second gift on Malfoy's bed.
“Please what?” Harry asked as he shoved his hand in his briefs. He pushed it under Draco’s balls roughly as he whispered a lubrication charm.
“Gonna find your exchange partner?” Ron asked when he received a bag of sweets from Hannah.
“Almost like it’s
“Harry was just telling me how busy he was after lazing about in Mungos for so long. You would never cheat on Serendipity, right?” Malfoy asked him.
"Of course I'm not mad. How could I be when you're so sweet?"
"Well, you can borrow it," Harry folded the magazine as he passed it to Malfoy. He busied himself with the packaging to not embarrass Malfoy. "Merlin's tits," he breathed when he read the slip of paper in the packaging, "it's an annual subscription to
"Draco Lucius Malfoy," she enunciated carefully while he quickly scrambled to comply.
"Of course I didn't," he said. "I didn't! I was very well behaved!" He insisted when Draco looked at him skeptically. "Can we talk about something sexier? Or whatever you do in that shop? I can't bear this sort of talk when we're going to part so soon," he begged.
"Thanks." Harry gave him a small smile. "Gotta go—" he leaned in with an outstretched hand before suddenly pulling away with an awkward smile— "bye. Drink your tea." He pointed at the cup in reminder.
"Bye," he waved at Malfoy before hightailing out of the infirmary.
"I almost died, if it wasn't for your cousin," the patient said as he pushed his sleeve up to show Teddy the scar for which he had stubbornly declined dittany.
"I'll go. I'm interested," Potter interrupted. "I'm really interested. And happy to be invited. I've never been to a magical zoo before." He raised his brows at Draco with a playful smile. "We might have to work around our schedules though, but wow!"
Draco glanced quickly at Harry, careful to not rest his eyes too long on any part of him. Even though Harry's crown was bumpy and his hair was slightly frizzy, his hair was shiny, wavy, and healthy. Draco focused on the tip of Harry's ear instead before meeting Harry's eyes for a beat. "It's Potter-esque," he said before being distracted by the new note that flew into Harry's cubicle.
