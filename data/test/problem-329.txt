He practically keened at the double meaning. “Yes,” whispered Draco, forgetting about what was left of his now-shattered Malfoy mask. At the moment, all he could do was think of just bolting out of the door and burying his face in his pillow to try and ignore the humiliation coursing through his body.
“You've probably thought about it in the morning,” Potter mused, "and who might've possibly shagged you, of all people," and this time, he leaned in to burrow his nose in Draco’s neck, one finger holding down the turtleneck in place. He expected him to move—what Draco didn’t expect was Potter to breathe him in, deeply, then—
the hardness that waited for him there—and this time, Draco was powerless to stop the long, pathetic whine that slipped out of him.
The door swung open, slowly, letting out a long creak. He caught a glimpse of shimmering silk, then a tangled mess of black hair beneath, and—
said Draco desperately as a sob wracked out of his frame, hiccupping into the other’s neck as more tears fell from his blurred eyes. Potter only continued to stroke him with his cum-splattered hand and into his slick cock, groaning softly as the last few thrusts rocked into him.
Potter raised an eyebrow at him, but it wasn’t in the mocking type of way that usually made Draco's irritation flare up. If anything, it looked more . . . teasing. Amused, to put it in better words.
“Here’s Penguin, your highness.” Harry had to physically bite down on a laugh at the mortified look on his boyfriend’s face as grey eyes threw him a sleepy glare—and the way how it melted almost immediately when the blanket was put over him, letting a cool warmth swaddle the shivering blond.
Draco groaned loudly again, vaguely wondering if he'd be excused from the test if he jumped out a window and got out the next day with a twisted leg and a mild concussion.
Those lucky moments didn’t come too often, but the letters that the other always left him with poorly-drawn smiley faces told Draco that Harry
Draco couldn’t speak, even if he tried to. He couldn’t hear any of the dirty nothings Potter was whispering in his ear filthily—he couldn’t even hear himself moan like some whore in a club. All he could focus on was that velvet-wrapped steel pounding into him, hitting his sweet spot every single time, eliciting a moan along with whispered pleas to echo from his throat.
Draco was so close, so fucking close—and it didn’t help that Potter looked as if he were too, seeing as there were short, huffed groans that rumbled from his chest as his clouded eyes went half-lidded slightly, low and fluttering and
snarled Draco, and for once, his voice has never been more steady. His own hand clung to Harry’s in an iron-grip, and all that was in his mind was to never let go. “The emergency team’s going to come soon. Just—just hold on. Please.”
“That’s what you’re worried about?” If Potter didn’t look so incredulous, then Draco might’ve taken him more seriously. “Merlin,
“Oh, come on now, Potter—who else would it be?” Draco scowled, flicking his narrowed eyes to the other man before shaking his head glumly. “Should’ve known. It doesn’t matter, anyway.”
And there was something, something unexplainable that made his head spin. “Y—yes,” he stuttered out, and he swore he saw Potter smile right before thrusting in with no such finesse.
He groaned, his head dropping to the edge of the table with a dull thud. Draco heard parchment and glass inkwells clink and shuffle briefly around him, but he was too enamored about thinking of his damned grades to give a flying fuck.
“Just—” he let out a wild sound when Harry dug his knee deeper, making his cock twitch in desperation. “Just fuck me,
Harry saw where he was looking. His mouth pulled into a tight smile. “I broke up with Ginny, took all my vows back, just right after you left.”
Potter began snapping his hips forward again and soon, white noise and static filled his ears, his mind blank and hazy. Draco couldn’t focus on anything but the hands touching him, the bundle of nerves abused inside him, the way his eyes rolled back as incoherent words tumbled out of his mouth…
As calloused fingers found their way into Draco’s locks once more, Potter’s mouth hovered over his collarbone before sucking, causing the blond to release another high, desperate whine.
“What?” Potter questioned, his eyes sparkling innocently as he rolled down his collar, showing off his… his… fuck, there were
and I couldn’t stop it.” Draco was trembling, his hands fisting the blankets drenched in his own sweat. He felt a tight knot form in his throat, and so suddenly, it was hard to speak. “I couldn’t—I couldn’t pull you up, and you—you just
It was as if time itself has slowed, and Draco was staring helplessly at the only thing left of his splintered world.
Draco had always said his name fondly in a tone of endearment, or whenever he’d come across his lover doing something rather stupid and dunce-like. But now, the name flowed from his mouth like a curse, like it brought a painful ache to the chest every time he said it. “Don’t you dare call me
Potter hummed pleasantly, raising a hand to the collar of his turtleneck and inching a finger in. Draco stared, hazily entranced at the slow reveal of bare skin, until a tiny yelp of surprise escaped him when he finally realised what Potter was doing.
“What?” he asked, subtly casting a wordless Cooling charm that sent a pleasant cold to dance on their skins.
Hermione gasped out a pained curse, her eyes shut tight as she hissed under her breath. Harry instantly rushed over as his eyes widened, quickly throwing a glance to see what she tripped over—a thin thread of magic, lined up on the stone floor with a flutter of dark purple.
“What?” Potter laughed, that sly grin on his face growing wider at the other’s flustered look. “You’re dressed for the occasion, anyway, with that little outfit of yours.”
She only smiled at Harry—he couldn’t tell if it was real or not. “Others would say that he was trying to escape,” she told him simply, turning away. “But I think the prison has finally broken him.”
“Yeah, well—” Harry drew in a shuddering breath, emerald eyes flitting open just slightly as the hands on the blond’s back tensed, his voice laced with a hint of bitterness that made the other wince. “You’d be too if you were an Auror and you got a whole tower of damn
“Draco,” he scolded softly, not hesitating to tap lightly at the shivering skin before he pulled them back apart with one hand. “Keep them open or I’m stopping.”
Harry’s jaw clenched, his intense dislike for the woman growing stronger and stronger by the minute. Little prisoner, as if she were talking about a caged animal—
Harry realised she was analysing—thinking of the steel-faced guards that were silent as they walked, the soft wails of anguish that sounded way too human-like, the heavy spells that wrapped around the prison like a blanket.
Draco groaned in frustration, trying to swat her out of his sight. “Out, out, out!” he hissed, muttering a curse when his elbow hit one of the intricate glass vases on the counter.
The table let out a dangerous creak forwards, digging into Draco’s skin harshly as Harry gave him one last, powerful thrust with a groan of his own. Draco cried out, his back sweltering and hitting Harry’s as they came, rough and brimming with a thrill that made another sob rip out from his throat.
The cold warmth of holding a bottle of firewhiskey in his weak grasp, the laugh that had bubbled in his throat when he laid eyes upon a familiar green-eyed man, the frantic, passionate kiss they shared as whispers of ‘I’ve been waiting, waiting so long for this,’ was painted on his skin, and—
Draco threw his head back at once, panting and gasping for breath, his chest rising and falling in uneven patterns. He took one glance at Harry, who looked more disheveled than he was, his eyes filled with a dangerous, green flame. “Fuck.”
Draco came with a lewd cry, which turned into a pathetic sob as he felt himself being slowly filled up. Heavy exhaustion hit him to the head, and even as Potter pulled out and spun him around, he felt too lightheaded to notice.
“Malfoy?” The black-haired boy turned around so sharply that he knocked a lavender-scented soap down onto the tiled floor with a wet thud.
Draco glanced to a tall mirror once more, taking in the lavish green that adorned his lithe body, the dark velvet that swaddled his hips, the silken gloves that veiled his trembling hands, and the tight knee-high boots that perfectly fit in with the rest of his bold attire.
There was a quiet laugh that rumbled from the raven, different from the mean demeanor that he wore before. “Of course,” he said, still fumbling with the thin straps of ribbon that circled around the blond’s waist, struggling as his hands pulled at the fabric. “How the hell did you even manage to pull this off?”
After a moment of serene quiet, with Draco’s eyes almost fluttering shut, he managed a low murmur. “Why’d you come home so early?”
He found himself screaming, shouting curses and half-croaked cries, but all of it happened too quickly. The hand he’s once held slipped, and Draco hated it. He hated how the bastard smiled weakly, how he glanced at him one last time, leaving lingering touches on his skin that felt like a sparking wildfire.
Potter didn’t even react, pulling away from him easily with a shrug. “As you wish.” Before Draco could even snap back a snarky retort, the Gryffindor grabbed a thick maroon towel, throwing it to him knowing that the other could catch it.
Another heartbeat passed as Draco felt his strained throat choke on a knot, only for a moment to tick by before a barely-hidden sob escaped him. Everything else blurred as his hands scrambled desperately to grasp at the leather couch, nails buried into black velvet. He could hardly feel any pauses in the brutal pace of Potter’s thrust anymore as his eyes stung, his breath running short, his hiccupped moans only getting louder and louder.
“I’m not mad at you,” the raven hurriedly put in, his head perking up from the pillows almost in an instant, eyebrows knitted together in evident worry.
He shut out the warden’s yells, the panicked mutters of guards that tried to cast spell after spell at the door, and the hurried screech of metal in their ears. Harry didn’t waste time to help the blond to his feet, even as he was trembling just slightly.
Draco felt out of breath, every shuddering exhale coming out harshly through parted lips as half-lidded eyes went slightly unfocused. Potter let his hand slip down and under the blond’s silken skirt, trailing over netted thighs as his fingers left shameless trails of saliva at its wake.
Unmistakable horror crossed Harry’s face. Then; a nervous laugh. “You want me to walk in there and say, ‘Hey, I fucked you last night during the party—oh, and don’t forget, we did it on your bed afterwards, too?’”
Maybe if Draco wasn’t so intent on ranting his messy, scribbled thoughts out, he would’ve noticed his Auror partner cautiously get up from his desk and make his reckless move towards him.
Potter’s eyes rose to his, and at the time, Draco thought he looked rather cocky and arrogant despite his uneasy voice—his legs were crossed, one shoe-clad foot touching Draco’s ankle slightly, and as if the world wanted to mock him, his shirt sleeves were rolled up all the way to his elbows, exposing that lovely dark skin.
groaned Harry, walking over to the Slytherin's study table before pointing to it offensively, as if it had just told him a rather horrid insult. "Looks to me like you've already gone through every book in the library just to pass these stupid NEWTs."
Draco’s toes curled nervously, breathing harsh as the two fingers pulled out. When the hand on his cock was no longer there, he frowned, ignoring the bloom of disappointment aching in his chest. “Potter, what are you—”
His mouth was soft and warm, even as he drove his calloused fingers through ivory-soiled hair and felt crumbs of dirt scrape his skin. His entire world tilted, and nothing else could’ve mattered then because he missed this—his body
His nostrils flared as the warden fixed a challenging look on him. Hermione’s hold on his arm was firm, and when her nails dug sharply enough to hurt, he backed down. He muttered out a quiet apology that laid sour on his tongue.
It stayed like that for a few seconds. Their breaths were rhythmic; Draco was breathing through his nose harshly, his chest falling up and down at a pace as he tried to get rid of the inevitable ringing in his head. The hands on his hips have slid up, clinging to his upper body in an almost protective-like way that made his heart twinge.
Harry hummed quietly, a melancholy tune on his tongue as he took the other’s hands in his—he always found them pretty. Even as cuts littered the blond’s ashen skin, and dried gashes tore his palms.
Draco took all of Potter in, right before staring back into that expectant gaze and approaching with a light simper. He had danced with other men before, and always knew what to do to rile them up—he always made sure to never break eye-contact, to tilt his head at a perfect angle so that the light would make his eyes shimmer like melted steel, and to lick his glossed lips with an innocent smile as he swayed over.
He couldn’t bring himself to look at him—to look at the man he once loved, his emerald eyes, knowing he didn’t feel the same affection for him anymore. Draco could only wonder if Potter had Weaslette’s perfumed scent on him, as they’re talking, or if he’d already bought a suit and tie for his big day.
“You are a hazard to society, Potter.” His voice was muffled underneath the blanket as only half of his face could be seen, earning a light chuckle from the other.
He always hated random tapping or twitching knees—the sound always made Draco’s nostrils flare in annoyance because it distracted him from his work. But with Potter doing it, the noise sounded like it was amplified by a
Draco threw him a bored look, crossing his arms. "Yes, these ‘stupid NEWTs’—as in, the exam that would either land you in a high-class AOE occupation in the future, or some pitiful job in the streets. Totally unimportant."
“Close your eyes, love,” he murmured softly, right before rolling down his sleeve and pulling out a wand that fit perfectly in his hold—the Elder Wand. It had been worth it.
"Bloody NEWTs," he muttered, hiding his face in his hands before peeking at his notes. Draco's handwriting has always been known to be elegant and neat, but as time slowly ticked by, it was almost ridiculous to think that he was the one who had actually written it. His letters had become messier, and the words began getting harder and harder to read. Ridiculous.
As if the gods didn't want to embarrass him enough, Draco jolted in his chair, right before his eyes narrowed skeptically. "Who's there?"
Dinners no longer existed, as far as the blond could recall—they used to order cheap food from Muggle inns that usually went with priceless, red wine, and then they would swap a tirade of ridiculous stories of how both their days went.
Harry walked over to the doorway, bringing up one hand to the wall for support as he hastily kicked off his steel-toed shoes (those were
Draco gasped loudly, and nothing could have prepared him to what Potter did next. The raven pressed his nose to the side of Draco’s face and shoved his tongue inside, mercilessly tongue-fucking his ear.
“God,” he rasped, his throat raspy from all the harsh cries that had escaped him just before another thrust nailed into his prostate and a thumb ran over his leaking tip, making the blond whine with another small hiccup.
Draco’s mind took a few seconds to process what he’s heard, and when he did get there, he only managed to throw a wandless jinx at the laughing redhead as the door slammed shut.
Draco was careful with how he moved, and he was very aware of how vulnerable he must look at that moment. His shirt happened to be long enough to brush against his thighs, covering at least half of what he hoped was not hard from just the sight of the black-haired boy. Draco cursed for not having his wand with him; if only he’d known he would have company in the showers, then he would’ve brought the one thing he could use to defend himself.
Potter made a sound, a noise that was low in his chest—and when Draco glanced to him in faint concern, he felt as if all the confidence that had been in him earlier wavered into nothing. In the raven’s eyes, the mirth that had once been there vanished, washed over instead with a blown, lust-ridden look that made him halt.
Draco frantically looked away, trying to think of disturbing images in his head to get rid of the rapid bloom on his face, but it was too late—Pansy had already seen it, her lips pulling into a derisive simper. “You sure are one kinky man, Draco Malfoy. Do you want me to help you find the guy who gave those to you, too?”
“I definitely remember now,” his voice cracked as he spoke, breaking the soothing silence that hung in the air.
“Good boy,” Potter praised softly, making the blond keen as a drawn-out whine was torn from his throat.
“And this is why I can’t leave you alone for another minute,” Harry mused half-heartedly, though the anxiety in his tone was not pushed aside. “I’ll go get a warm blanket for you real quick, okay? The bed’s too far away, so you could just rest here.”
Draco gasped against the knee that had managed to bury itself between his legs, rubbing against the warm fabric of his trousers tauntingly. Harry chuckled, using that as an advantage to lean forwards, slipping in his tongue inside the sweet cavern of his mouth.
Harry tried to ignore the knife-like pain that carved at his chest. “I know it is, but…one more time? For me?“ he glanced down to the silver ring, and without a second thought, slipped it on the blond’s finger—just right beside the wood-splintered one. It hurt to look at it. “For us?”
“Fuck—fuck you,” Draco groaned, his head thumping back against the wall as Potter kissed him again, the same time as a hand found its way to his red, aching cock. But the Auror didn’t move—not in the way that the blond desperately wanted. He only fondled Draco’s erection, delicately watching as a bead of pearl-white precum appeared on top.
“Yeah, well,” Weasley sniggered, shaking his head at himself as he rubbed his ankle, “you don’t need to pretend around me, Malfoy, honestly—I always knew that Harry liked y—”
“I’m sorry,” Harry murmured again, gently taking the hand that rested on his hair as he held it for his own. The wrist was lithe, whilst the knuckles were tainted with a flushed red—he wondered if it was because Draco had tried to claw his way out before, refusing to take one blink of sleep until exhaustion crept up on him.
Draco’s cheeks held a pink tint to it, but he ignored it as he cuddled closer, hiding his flushed face from sight as best as he could. “You’re an awful sap.”
Potter cut him off again after another shallow thrust, the slap of skin lewd in their ears as dark eyes looked over to the other, one eyebrow raised in interest at the blond’s defiance that refused to waver.
“Use your words,” Potter told him softly, a small smirk tugging at the corner of his lips as a faint noise broke from the other’s throat. Draco hopelessly tried to shift his hips so that the raven’s finger would curl up just right where he wanted it, but Potter kept pulling back with a sinister chuckle.
And before he knew it, he was already speaking in pathetic little stutters, his voice strained as he did so.
“Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Potter, but I’m afraid your time is over,” the warden drawled outside the cell.
And yet, he ignored it, forcing his own body to relax and melt to the soundless rhythm as he slowly inhaled. The Common Sense in his head was screaming, but he shoved that away too.
Draco’s eyes widened considerably when he realised who he was, and parted his lips slightly to utter out a word—but almost instantly, his paused mid-way, harshly breathing through his nose as he hung his head low.
Draco assumed someone had dropped him off at his apartment, but even the thought itself was almost impossible to consider—none of his friends had enough free time to accompany him to the party with Potter, thus excluding them out of his choices and leaving out all the do-good Gryffindors.
“You’re so close, aren’t you?” Potter whispered in a mocking tone, a cruel smirk on his face before snickering at the pathetic look that Draco wore. He pulled out slowly, lifting the blond’s shaking thighs as to guide him, giving the other enough time to let out a stuttering breath before slamming back in.
A stupid face that he didn’t know was smiling gently, a small huff escaping his chapped lips. “You think it was Ginny?”
He could already imagine the bastard’s head perking up like a deer with his lips pulled into a wide grin. Draco didn’t know why, but he knew Potter at least delighted in the sweet satisfaction that came with all the humiliation.
The blond glanced up, as if he hadn’t just been looking at all, his voice losing the threat that it held earlier. “Well, what?”
“Wait—” he gasped when Potter’s hand slithered down and unto the hard bulge in his pants, caressing and palming and
Draco’s eyes slipped shut as he felt the hard length push in, his thighs shaking. “Fuck,” he whispered, “fuck, Potter,
said Potter in disbelief, only urging on to make the other’s grin twist into a choked laugh, their throats too raspy and used to do anything else. “I hardly think a
Apparently, Draco must have let out an undignified sound because Potter suddenly stopped his bathing ministrations, horror dawning in his face.
The blond had to restrain himself from wiping the smirk off Harry's face. "Turns out my tongue's useful for other things," he clarified, noticeably checking Draco out from head to toe, "other than doing you, of course."
“I’m here,” he whispered out, ignoring the hurt that ached in his chest. “You can look at me now, Draco. It’s just us.”
that clouded his head. He whimpered at the teeth grazing the precious strip of skin behind his earlobe, jerked his hips back with a whine at the velvet-wrapped steel that slowly pushed inside him, trembled at the hand that wrapped around his slick cock—
—a slow ache that began stirring from below, twitching against the fabric of his pants. Draco knew his resolve was breaking, little by little, and so did Potter when he took his time rolling down the blond’s turtleneck, revealing…
Potter felt the salty tears come before he did. Draco buried his face in the crook of his neck, letting his shields fall down once more; a mistake he swore to never do again, yet …
Potter let out a low chuckle that sent chills underneath his skin, an abrupt blush warming over the Draco’s cheeks, embarrassed at the utterly
Draco’s skin felt like there was fire licking at him in slow, torturous taunts, thrumming in his veins with the power to tear him apart as each small touch made his body tremble in sensitivity. Wet lashes blinked as another soft, strangled moan fell from his lips, voice raspy and shattered when Potter slammed in one more time, his eyes rolling back with a cry.
The man in front of him resembled nothing like the Malfoy he once knew—his pristine hair had gone limp, strewn all over soiled skin that was littered over with scars. An iron collar choked him, and cuffs on his wrists held him up—chained to the wall like an… like he was a—
He remembered every single moment—how Weaslette’s face lit up into a tearful smile, how they shared a tender kiss on the lips, and how Draco tried to down potion after potion of Dreamless Sleep the next day in hopes of thinking it was all just some delusional nightmare his mind had conjured.
“Let me go, Potter!” he demanded, wishing the other didn’t hear the slight waver in his voice. Draco tried yanking his arm out of Potter’s grip, knowing it was already a lost cause when he was shoved roughly against the bathroom wall.
Potter’s lips curled into a cruel grin as he forcibly held the blond down by the hips, firmly rubbing at the sensitive little nub that was buried inside of him whilst Draco held back a choked, desperate whine.
They both slept well that night, arms tangled and legs interlocked. It was everything they could’ve asked for.
“Hm.” Potter smiled kindly at him, humming low in his throat as he trailed a rough-padded finger over each of Draco’s marks. He did it carefully, touching every single one with a gentle thumb, knowing which ones to press harder on to make the blond’s breath hitch.
Apparently, that was enough for Harry to freeze and think of his options wisely (which he didn’t, but it wasn’t like he cared) before he took off his Auror coat, threw it over a chair, and decided that he will be—in fact—
The blond glanced to him, letting his tired body decide for him as he huddled closer, making a satisfied noise in the back of his throat as strong arms immediately curled around his lithe frame. He laid his head on one, with a hand from behind gently playing with tufts of platinum hair, whilst the other settled on the small curve of his back.
“You know, that actually reminds me—” Potter glanced to him, eyes practically gleaming— “I probably should send her a thank-you gift later. It was her idea to make you lose that bet on purpose last night.”
Potter only hummed back to him as a reply, which only served to make the situation much worse with all the slightly open-mouthed gapes and quiet whistles as he took in as much as he could of the blond. A crooked little smile was plastered on his face, green eyes finally rising to meet the other’s glower.
His depraved thoughts of careful planning only halted to a stop when he heard the sound of his doorknob clicking slightly.
The blond only nodded, blinking wearily as he forced his lidded eyes open, letting out a short yawn before he mumbled under his breath, too near-silent, as if he wished that Harry couldn’t hear him. “You’re disappointed.”
A hand wrapped around his cock, fisting the red tip while the thumb teased his slit. Draco’s breath shook, unshed tears prickling at the corners of his eyes at the denial to come. He found himself begging, pleading in weak whispers, because he needed it so bad, he felt like he was going to die if he didn’t—
“Oh? What are you, his support system?” the warden finished her Scanning spell, leaving tingles to dance on his skin. She let out a short laugh at her own words, but Hermione didn’t look amused in the slightest. “Here, Mr. Potter—hand over your wand.”
A hand patiently tugged at Draco’s arm, but he didn’t move a single muscle. “Tired,” the blond murmured quietly, finding way too much comfort for his own liking in the crook of Potter’s neck. “Wanna stay with you.”
He might’ve passed out for a few seconds—Draco wasn’t so sure. It could’ve been minutes or hours or days; just then, all that he could think about was the endless pounding in his head that suddenly felt so light, the magic-bound tie around his wrists that gently unraveled itself, and the hands that lifted him off the table, caressing his skin soothingly.
Draco slowly exhaled. Blinked his eyes open. Settled his shoulders back. Lifted his chin. Threw a little, confident smirk his way.
“I could tie you to your bed for one week straight and you’d still get perfect marks in every subject,” countered Harry smoothly, towering over his desk in nonchalance, as if he hadn’t just directly glanced at Draco to see him flush pink.
The blond wanted to curse from the euphoric pain that throbbed between his legs, begging for release, but all that escaped him was a high, desperate whine.
Draco inhaled sharply, almost forgetting the other boy was still there. “Can’t I have a little privacy?”
Harry could’ve smiled from the relief that washed over him, or maybe even chuckled lightly—but not with the forlorn look on Draco’s face. Not with the forced smile that graced his split lips. Not when he looked like he’s—like he’s—
“Please.” Draco swallowed, his eyes falling shut as he attempted once more to push his arse down on the Potter’s finger. When the other refused, he felt a sob wrack his body. “P—please, Potter, I’d do anything, please, please—”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat, eyes going wide at the abrupt memory that invaded his mind. He unconsciously raised a hand to his neck, feeling the light powder of makeup shift under his turtleneck as he forced himself to walk faster through the aimless halls of the Ministry.
“Draco?” Harry tried to say, wincing when it came out as a frail whisper instead. Maybe it was the desperation in his voice, the pleading look in his eyes, or the way his hands trembled—he didn’t know what he had done, but it was enough to have tired eyes blinking back up at him.
“Draco,” Harry rasped, his voice barely a whisper. His face was so bloodied, adding to the dirt and soot that had smudged his skin—and yet, Draco thinks he’s never looked more handsome.
“Oh?” Pansy raised an eyebrow at him, right after sighing disappointedly with the back of her hand resting on her forehead. “How tragic. My childhood best friend remains a virgin, after all these years of fine men running after him.”
Draco curled closer, each breath seeming to slow. He didn’t want to move; this was what he wanted. In his lover’s arms, listening to each beat of his heart, making it so that it matched his own.
Draco turned a murderous shade of red, and even more so when he let his own words sink in. He could’ve laughed at himself at how unnaturally wrong he sounded, at how he felt a bitter taste on the back of his throat, and the way his mind clung to one desperate hope to do
He stopped breathing entirely. Draco had known Potter was there all along, waiting in the dark—watching him from afar. He only didn’t have the heart to make the stubborn Gryffindor go away, not when some part of him still ached for the git.
also, someone wants me to post the outline i write for my fics 'cos they wanna study my writing style. before i post it, i want some opinions, so—thoughts? also, thank you for reading this!!
he looked as well—with curled strands of black hair sprawled all over his forehead, just above darkened eyes that misted over his body with a sparkling hunger. “Three if you wanna continue.”
Draco managed a weak snort, dipping his quill in an inkwell as his other hand sorted stacked papers on the left. “Unlike you, Potter, I actually want to keep my job instead of looking for someone who, pray tell, I don’t even remember the face of.”
“I’m afraid I have no clue of what you’re talking about,” said Draco, his voice cracking when he attempted to try and sound nonchalant. He turned away, sniffling. “Now, if you excuse me, I have paperwork to finish.”
“Too much, Harry—too much,” Draco tried to whisper, eyes slipping shut before Potter thrusted in one more time, nails digging harshly into hips as he jerked against the hot warmth that filled him, openly crying out as Potter slammed into his prostate. “Fuck—oh,
Draco looked hesitant as his gaze flickered to his bloodied hands, to the cell that he ruined, then to Harry’s pleading stare. He let out a shaky breath, taking one glimpse of the collar that had once been on him. On his neck.
Draco knew it wouldn’t do him good to throw out an offhanded comment, so he willfully spun around, a steady flush creeping up his neck.
But what made his eyes widen the tiniest bit was when a soft groan came from the other. Was Potter uncomfortable? Should he stop?
His lips stretched around the calloused skin of Potter’s fingers as he fucked his mouth, unforgiving and brutal and
Draco tried again for another roll as he lowered his hips further, his lips parting slightly to release a small, breathy moan—one that made him flush instantly in embarrassment as he exhaled shakily through his nose.
He swung the door open without knocking, striding as quick as he could to his own empty desk on the right side of the room, all the while keeping his head down and avoiding eye-contact with
Draco bit his bottom lip harshly, trying to restrain the embarrassing sounds he was making, but it only served as a challenge for Harry—his dark eyes gleaming, he slammed in one last time with a low groan of his own, more savage and ruthless than the last, earning a high-pitched moan from the blond.
He was too out of it to see the warden raise her wand, tiny-lit sparks tapping on metal three times. His thoughts were too drowned out to hear the ear-splitting creak that rumbled beneath his feet, followed by a hissed curse beside him.
He secretly felt blessed that there were no important Auror cases to be dealt at the moment, because if it were otherwise, then Draco was more than certain that a bit of sweat was all it took to reveal what really was beneath Pansy’s lavish concealer.
Draco stared at him, slowly inhaling through his nose and counting one to five. “If you know the guy, at least tell me that he’s decent-looking.”
“A lesson,” said Harry faintly, his blood turning cold. He wasn’t entirely sure if it were because of the delighted thrill at the way she spoke, or the dark-hooded blurs that they slowly neared closer to. He recognised the void-like faces, the spindly fingers that he could’ve sworn he felt on his skin, and the past encounters that flashed before his eyes.
He might’ve enjoyed it—loved it, even—if it weren’t for the dark thoughts that circled his head. Draco knew it, but he was trying; he tried to slip in his tongue, savour the tingles that danced on his skin, moan softly and buck against the gentle hand resting on his waist, but all that came out was a strangled sob.
“Why?” he asked one more time, maybe because some silly part of him hoped that the boy behind those doors was still human.
Draco’s eyes fluttered shut, savouring the pain Harry left with his teeth—then the pleasure from the warm tongue that soothed it. “Harry . . .”
“Really funny,” Potter snorted, shifting uneasily on his feet. It was in no way subtle, and they both knew that, but he covered it up quickly with a smug smirk. “What’s even funnier is that I can still recall you being the first one to pass out during the party, Ron.” He paused, pretending to think. “I think ‘Mione had to drag you home herself.”
Even for someone like Potter, the outrageous hero of the Wizarding world and his upmost rival to almost everything, Draco had to ashamedly admit that the Gryffindor was . . . well, hung. Annoyingly, perversely, and exasperatingly hung. He could almost imagine and feel that hard length caress his soft skin between his things, sliding along the crack of his—the crack of his—
“Stop talking,” mumbled Draco, and just about when he felt like the soothing darkness of sleep was about to claim him, he heard Potter speak softly once more.
“Don’t,” Harry warned him, trailing his saliva-coated fingertips over his furled hole. Without warning, Draco cried out as his hands were suddenly pulled above his head, bound together with a Slytherin tie knotted around both his delicate wrists.
at Potter, who was comfortably sat with his elbows propped up on the couch, as well as calloused hands that were raised to rest on the back of his head.
Harry fought the urge to grimace as they strolled down the poorly-lit hallway, each room having its own flat metal door with a serial number carved on it. He bit his bottom lip harshly when he saw a messy splatter of blood on one, dark enough to have been mistaken as pure black.
Potter threw him a dark smile; a sealed promise. He lunged forwards, making a move for Draco as one bristle arm pinned him to the shower wall by the throat. The Slytherin gasped, moist air hitting his skin as he felt cold water run down his back. Draco growled as Potter trapped his pale wrists to the wall at either side of his head, but it soon turned into a breathless whimper when a wave of pleasure shot up his spine.
“Don’t—” Draco tried to close his legs, but all he could focus on was how the other was thumbing at his slit, and how he leaned in to pull the desirous Slytherin into a kiss.
He couldn’t stop the smile that graced his own lips later when he told Harry about it—when he told Harry he finally had a family that wanted to welcome him with open arms.
“Theories?” Hermione didn’t turn, swallowing down the knot that stuck in her throat as she set down her cup. “What theories?”
Draco couldn’t help but jerk his hips against the ticklish feeling, eliciting a soft groan from Potter, only serving to make the blond tremble as his cock twitched against the tight fabric of his knickers. The smooth silk of his skirt wasn’t any help either, as every time it teasingly brushed over the inside of his thighs, a muffled moan would escape him.
The warden arched an eyebrow at him, and for a moment, he could’ve sworn that her eyes narrowed just slightly as she huffed. “Never eats his meals, never talks, then makes a mess of everything else in his cell. We even found out that he would shatter his clock on purpose to see a guard, but eventually, he stopped.”
Potter cast him a smirk, the two fingers knuckle-deep in his arse pulling out to rub at the blond’s sensitive, flushed skin. He slid his tongue past Draco’s glossed lips, tasting something rather sweet as the tip pressed against the roof of his mouth, swallowing every soft and lewd moan that escaped the other.
Under normal circumstances, Draco would have put his Malfoy mask back on and sneered at Potter for being so inadeptly mindless, but at the moment all he could do was stare at that flushed, red-tipped—
Eventually, it worked, because Draco finally melted into the warm touch, letting himself be cradled as he raised his own arms so they pressed against his chest—making it so that he could lift a palm to the other’s heart, and feel the steady, anchored beat that thrummed under his fingertips.
The blond let out a small huff of approval, licking his lips as he hummed and tasted the sweet lip gloss that had been carefully applied there. It wasn’t often he cared so much about the way he looked—on usual days, he always trusted his cunning sense of fashion—but this was a different case. A different matter.
Hermione only hummed in disapproval. He thought she looked rather composed, despite waiting on the doors of hell to welcome them in—her mouth was drawn to a thin line, and her eyes were narrowed as they darted from place to place.
There it was again. The way his voice fell a little too flat, the sudden tightness that clawed in his throat, seemingly making it harder to utter out a word.
Potter’s chest rumbled with laughter. “I shouldn’t even be surprised. Are you still on with that shower or not?”
to you? This is a waste of my time, I’m better off doing something else—hell, I don’t even know how I can still
“Fuck you,” breathed Draco as Potter quietly chuckled at him, right before throwing his head back with a stifled moan when a wet tongue lapped at his throat, its pace brutal as bruises bloomed under harsh teeth. The nails that locked unto his hips only went deeper, not enough to actually hurt the blond, but painful enough to warn him.
Draco fought the urge to lift his hand up to his throat and soothingly rub the ache that bloomed on his skin. “Yes,” he said tightly. “What do you want?”
He felt Potter’s hands sneak into the smooth curve of his waist, cutting him off as they slid further down with intent that didn’t feel so innocent. Nothing—
“Well…” Draco let out a small sigh, his blood-spattered hands rising up to his face as he clawed at his hair frustratedly. “What do you want me to do, Harry?”
“You don’t wanna look at me?” Potter smiled coyly, aware of how Draco’s hands suddenly twitched and became restless against the couch. He could most likely see the way how the blond’s own cock twitched underneath his silken skirt, pulling away from his body, dripping and flushed to the tip from being unnoticed for so long.
Draco slowly breathed in once more, rolling his shoulders back. He took his time to saunter over with a daring smile, one that Potter didn’t hesitate to effortlessly return. Swallowing the knot that stuck in his throat, he allowed his hips to lower slightly when he reached the couch, feeling a particular part of his body
There wasn’t much time to linger on it as the calloused hand on his hard, dripping cock started to stroke him at a hurried pace, with no finesse or teasing at all as the look on Potter’s face grew softer, enough to make Draco roll his head back with a broken moan.
Draco didn’t hesitate to lift his hips immediately, and along with it, his knees—this whole dare was ridiculous, anyway, he’ll murder Pansy for it later—as he made a move to hurriedly get up from Potter’s lap. He heard himself mumble something, a quick ‘sorry’ maybe, but it was too late for him to process anything else as Potter growled and yanked him back in.
Ron gaped at him, his eyes wide as his ill-addled brain struggled to string one line of words together. “But you—I was—oh, that is
scratches. Why were there— “I’m sure you have worse,” he added, smirking when the blond couldn’t find it in himself to speak.
Potter hissed something in Weasley’s ear, something that quiet enough so Draco couldn’t hear. Draco watched in slight satisfaction as the redhead’s expressions morphed into irritation, disbelief, pure
His back arched off the wall, coming on the patterned walls with a sharp cry as he bucked his hips. Shiny white globs of his come stained the walls, his breath ragged as he tried to clear the pounding in his head. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut, muscled arms holding him up by the sides and pressing him against the wall.
“Could care less about that,” said Weasley flippantly, waving him off with a light shake of his hand. “But seriously—is it Matching Couples Day or something, or did you two both wear matching turtlenecks on purpose?”
A voice inside his head was screaming that he should just back out, that maybe there was still a chance to never go through this ridiculous dare from the bet he lost at all—but Draco knew his pride would forever be tarnished if he did so.
Potter stopped abruptly, his hand on the Slytherin’s stomach reaching up to caress him gently. Softly. Almost like he actually cared. “Too rough?”
Draco felt hot warmth embrace his body, and he can’t help but bury his face in it as a body held him back with a lover’s gentleness.
So, when knocks rapped against their door, Hermione forced herself to be still while cold-faced aurors marched in with no mind. Their wands were tucked away, but she knew too well that they were armed to the teeth. Their stances might’ve been up and proper, but she could still note how their narrowed eyes assessed her home.
But all the blond did was stare back just as defiantly, even as he was trying to fight the heavy lull of sleep that hovered over his eyelids.
“Go ahead, kitten,” crooned Potter softly, dropping a gentle hand from the blond’s tangled hair and to his nape, then to his warm cheeks with a slight glide that felt—felt
But most of the spare minutes that they’d have with each other now were almost an endless repeat—one that’s been going on for
The kiss was nothing innocent of the sort. It was wet and sloppy, and their hands were fumbling over one another, desperate to touch smooth bare skin; golden-tanned and powerfully built against his pale and delicate ones. Draco couldn’t breathe, not when he felt lost with arousal everywhere—tongue battling against tongue, a hand lifting his shirt and teasing a pink nipple, the hand stroking his cock and coming back up to play with the throbbing tip—
The raven intwined their fingers and carefully lifted Draco’s hands with his, taking his time to place one feather-light kiss on each knuckle. “You are letting out an adorable air of insecurity right now.”
Something prickled at the corner of his eyes. His shoulders shook, his throat closed up, because they both knew that they were mere seconds away from falling to their deaths. Moments ago, Draco could hear aurors bustling about from faraway, shouting orders for help—but now, all he could hear were his own near-silent whimpers and the scrape of rock his elbows kept hitting.
“Don’t bite your lips,” Harry informed him quietly, his voice filled with a wicked sort of danger that made Draco whine. “I want to hear you.”
Hell, even the bastard’s legs were parted slightly as if to mock him, partnered with a smug smirk on his face that made Draco’s jaw drop.
The feather of his quill brushed against his cheek as he began scribbling down on one of the documents. The blond heard a muffled choke beside him—which sounded rather vile, actually—then the splatter of warm tea that soiled the marble floors. He didn’t bother looking up, dipping his quill with ink again.
“the guards here tend to be quite intimidating, I must admit. To whom did you request a visit with, Mr. Potter?”
“I’m not,” Harry tried to say as slowly as he could, his patience running thin. “He doesn’t have a clue about anything that happened last night, like I just said.”
Draco froze, and it seemed that with it, his train of thought too. His mind went blank, and his lips fell wordless. Potter knew, then. He knew who shagged the hell out of him at the party, Potter knew what he was hiding beneath the ever-so-thin cloth that sinfully clung to his throat—
“You taste like cherries,” Potter whispered lowly, voice thick as his words elicited another whimper from Draco, whose pale skin was utterly sheen with sweat and the thinnest threads of saliva here and there.
From the other room, he heard a doorknob click open, a black figure dashing about and swinging the door close. Draco shut his eyes, pinching his nose, waiting for the strides of expensive, high heels to come closer, and closer, then—
He couldn’t help but let out a tired sigh, his eyes blinking faintly as the room twirled on its own. He dreaded every minute that ticked by, the dust-ridden lamps that the guards always seemed to carry, the eerie silence that pounded in his ears too loudly—
The pace was fast and ruthless and beast-like. Draco wanted to thrash and whimper from the ever-growing bliss that clouded his senses, but with the carefully placed hands on his waist, and the magic that emboldened the tie around his wrists, all that was left was the intense sensation of it all. The thrusts were almost impossible to bear, but it was also . . .
“So fucking perfect,” growled Potter, using one hand to keep the Slytherin’s head against the wall whilst the other gripped his hips. Draco tried to keep quiet by biting his lips roughly, but Potter’s perfectly aimed thrusts hitting the little nub inside him was enough to make his dignity shatter.
Potter could only throw him an apologetic look as the door slammed shut, and along with it the two Gryffindors.
Potter ran his misty gaze over his body once more, causing the Slytherin to instinctively yelp and cover himself up. “Potter!”
It was only then did Draco realise with a small tremble that the wet trails on his flushed cheeks were
Draco was helpless to stop the little, wrecked mewl that left him, only serving to satisfy the other’s hunger for more.
“N—no,” gasped Draco as one strong hand came to rest on his stomach, pushing him downwards on Potter’s cock. Fuck, it was too much, he couldn’t take it any longer, he felt like he was going to be torn apart even if it felt so fucking good— “W—wait!”
But when shifting his body even for just a quick moment felt like a dagger violently piercing through his head, Draco would much rather drown in his sea of blankets for one week straight.
Glassy, grey eyes held back tears that threatened to fall, a small whimper of a curse slipping from Draco’s lips. “Potter, I ca—“ he was interrupted as Potter delivered a savage bite of his teeth to his neck where a bruised hickey already lay, making the blond arch to the fiery touch as he instinctively jerked. “Wait,
Draco shakily exhaled, his shoulders trembling a bit against his thin frame. A pained cough spilled out of him, and soon with it, came a raspy whisper.
“Fuck,” Draco whispered, trying to tug at the bonds helplessly, shutting his eyes close at the fingers that pushed against his hole. He let out a stifled moan when they went past his rim, slipping and wriggling its way in. Satisfaction from the soft sounds he was getting from the blond, Harry inched his fingers further into the hot, tight warmth, curling upwards just right, then— “Oh,
“Po—Potter!” Draco tried to break his wrists free, but Potter had an ironclad grip on him. Little sparks of pleasure arose and went straight to his erection as Potter continued his ministrations, swirling the soft skin of his earlobe before roughly diving back in repeatedly.
“Fuck,” he mumbled, hating how he instinctively bared his neck for him, to show Potter, because he wanted
in interest as the cushion dug into his knees, but he ignored it as two of his silken-gloved arms settled heatedly beside the other’s face.
It was the soft, lilting way she spoke that made him stand up straighter—and the dangerous edge to her stare that was shielded behind a fake smile. He knew her type—Harry’s met people like her before. People who everyone steered clear of. People who no one dared to mess with.
Draco’s eyes finally flickered open, blinking up at Harry, shivering at the warmth that tingled on his skin, the towel now grazing his collarbones. He knew Harry could have easily cast a wandless Cleaning Charm, but he didn’t mind doing it the other way either. “I highly doubt you even know what ‘debauched’ means, Potter.”
Draco blushed, not because of how Potter’s hand was wandering through the most vulnerable parts of his body, but because how he submitted so easily to the command. A knot formed in his throat as one of Potter’s hands dropped to his arse, spreading his legs so he could see the little flushed hole beneath.
Ron had caved in almost instantly. His trembling body went still for a moment before melting in the warmth that welcomed him, burying his face in her neck. Hermione didn’t hesitate to lift a hand to his ruffled hair, rubbing tiny circles on his back as a way to soothe him.
The only clues of who might’ve been daring enough to bring him home was that they must’ve really known Draco rather well; it wasn’t often that people knew where he lived, aside from the Manor. But there was also something else, something that veiled a significant memory, somewhere in the back of his mind…
Draco stilled, staring at him, and it took Harry a while to realise that he was trying to figure out what to say next. He remembered loving the blond for it—always having some snarky response in check, or a flippant joke to slice through thick silence. But this…
Seemingly satisfied with his work, he thrusted in again, crooking his fingers into the tight heat, just before throwing a warning look at the other when the blond let out a choked noise and tried to pull his thighs close.
“Okay, okay, fine! Even if you kick me out, you’re still my best friend, and what am I if not a good saint to help you heal your…” she paused, a hint of a smirk on her lips. “…bruises?”
He heard a gentle sip of tea, then the clink of a mug dropping to a table. “Well, considering what happened last night, I would’ve at least thought it merited a ‘good job, well done’ from the almighty Draco Malfoy.”
“That’s—“ Rolls of pain and clouded desperation assaulted him as Draco worried his teeth over his bottom lip to try and hide any more noises that escaped, but Potter’s scoff told him all he needed to know as his eyes rolled back again. “Ngh,
Potter’s words were like a melted honey to his ears, sweet and tempting, and Draco was slowly drowning in them—he could only cry out again at another well-placed thrust, shaking as that one came earlier than the last, realising that Potter was almost close as a hot breath puffed on his fair skin.
Laurent offered him a small nod back, his eyes darting to the blond’s clothes curiously. “I believe you mistook this month for winter, Mr. Malfoy,” he said curtly, a heavy accent dripping off his voice.
Draco had to grip on to the last of his dignity to try and not look down. “I—um, yeah. Okay. But, um—I can’t use—this one’s only—”
Unthinkingly, he started fiddling with the buttons of his shirt whilst kicking his dragonhide boots out of his feet rather ungracefully at the same time. Draco knew that if he ever saw someone treat such precious items like this in the future, he’d internally cringe and wonder what type of people taught them to be so crude.
Draco caught it with one hand, unblinking. He neatly folded it to one side, cursing Potter quietly for ruining the organised pleats. He hastily let his Slytherin green cloak slip from his shoulders, revealing a silver shirt of silk and black trousers beneath.
Draco let out a half-hearted scoff, shifting lower so he could nestle in the other’s chest as he hid under the blankets. “You find my insecurity adorable? You sadist.”
Potter glanced at him thoughtfully. “Ah.” And the bastard, the utterly imbecilic bastard, ran his gaze down the Slytherin’s Quidditch-clad body noticeably. “Practicing laps?”
Draco’s breath hitched, his body going stiff. “This? What, you’ve wanted sex for a long time now or something?”
So, Draco lifted his chin. Looked into those eyes, that rough jawline, and let his gaze slip downwards. “Make me.”
“Actually, thank you for reminding me—“ the redhead propped himself on his elbows, leaning forward on his desk— “‘Mione told me she actually
The blond went crimson, knowing that out of context, their conversation was not one for the innocent. “What does it matter to you?” he muttered under his breath, ignoring the faint ringing in his ears.
“You—” Potter seemed to straighten now, awkwardly hiding the spill on the ground beneath his shoe. “You’re kidding with me, right?”
Now, Harry comes home so late that the other didn’t have any choice but to give in to the sweet lulls of sleep that pulled him in. Sometimes, Draco wouldn’t see him for days, and their house would look untouched as if no one’s ever step foot in it—the only proof that Harry has been there would be the scattered sticky-notes on the walls, but even then…
“You’re so much better when you keep that little mouth of yours shut,” breathed Potter, his voice nothing unlike the gentle caresses of his thumb across the other’s cheek. Draco’s mind must’ve gone blank, then, because didn’t find himself pushing or fighting back against the lips that captured his own.
That was until his knees gave out entirely, too weak to hold him up, making Draco let out a shattered cry that was torn from his strained throat as he bottomed out completely. He could’ve sworn that he whited out for a moment, eyes rolling to the back of his head as another moan spilled out of him, but all he heard was a leering laugh.
“I bet you can’t even make me cry if you tried,” said Draco, a little breathlessly as he attempted to collect some semblance of the control that he had before. He felt proud that he had managed to say all that without a stutter, nor a voice crack, but the flame of confidence that burned inside him flickered out just as quickly when he caught the amused look in Potter’s eyes.
“Oh,” Draco breathed out, a little of his old flame bursting to life as the Auror unclasped his belt buckle, tossing it to the floor. “Taking what’s yours since what, last night?”
and composed that the blond had to restrain himself from strangling something. He heard a few sloshes of tea, the incessant shuffling of paper, then— “How are you?”
Draco could’ve sobbed by then, an all-too familiar heat beginning to bloom in the depths of his stomach, rushing to his cock, hard and flushed ruby. Shuddering moans slipped past his glistening lips, sheen from the saliva dribbling on his chin, the lewd sounds of barely restrained slaps of skin filling his ears.
Draco huffed, giving in as he shifted on the couch and mumbled a curse. Harry offered him a triumphant smile, one that got him flipped off as he helped the blond get comfortable. After a few moments of shuffling along with the effort of finding his boyfriend’s favourite blanket (Harry calls it ‘Penguin’ because… well, there’s penguins on it), he finally stalked back to the living room—where the other was curled up against himself, visibly distressed.
you leave the bar with a particular someone last night! I mean, it’s obvious enough who it is, but the least you two could do was wear different
he swore at himself, knowing just what he had done when Potter started laughing—a mocking, low sound that arose from his chest.
“Weasley,” said Draco tightly, wincing a little. Using every tactic and maneuver his father had taught him about proper pureblood manners, he offered the redhead a pained smile. “Your tie’s wrinkled.”
But he also wanted to play a little game first, because who was he, if not a Slytherin to the very core?
“Don’t ever do that again.” His voice was muffled by the sound of his quiet sniffles and the shift of velvet blankets. “Please.”
Potter’s breath hitched, his eyes glistening. “I didn’t know you were going to be there, love, I just—”
“Open your eyes and look at me, love,” that same voice implored, and Draco did. His eyes fluttered open, shaken and petrified.
"There you go," Harry cooed, tucking a pale strand of golden hair away from his pink-dusted cheek. "You can't just get enough of this, can you?"
He gasped, suddenly struggling for air as he found himself shoved back and twisted, ashamedly bent over his study table, exposed and breathless. “Po—
And the warden must’ve known it too from the look on his face, because Harry was greeted with a roll of her eyes. “If you can’t make it through the appetizer, Mr. Potter, then you’ll never survive the main course.”
Draco nodded quickly, deciding to raise his arms to his mouth to try and quiet the embarrassing noises he was making. From the corner of his eye, he saw Potter drop down to his knees behind him, right before his hand sneaked inside Draco’s shirt and stroked his cock. “What—” he swallowed quickly, “what are you—oh, fuck!”
Without noticing, Harry sneaked his hand down to his waist, stroking the pale flushed skin that went taut there ever-so-slightly. “What do you think, love?”
His mouth parted in a near-silent gasp when he felt Harry’s thumbs pry his aching hole open, and with no such finesse, shove his tongue in as far as he could past the rim, his nose digging into the ridge between his cheeks. Draco cried out, spluttering, unconsciously jerking back as a wave of pleasure swelled straight to his cock.
Draco let out a little breathy laugh, a glassy sheen to his eyes. “And what about you? What about the great Harry Potter? Hero of the Wizarding World?”
Maybe if Draco had been paying the smallest bits of attention to what’s happening around him rather than burning a hole through his papers with a fierce glare, he would’ve had the time to process the way a hand snuck its way to his forearm, and another spinning his chair to firmly hold him in place.
“Potter,” he breathed, mind clouded with an unquenchable thirst, because he needed to get out of these clothes, it was too hot, he could feel sweat trickle down his spine and unto the cleft of his—oh, it was right there, dripping over and bypassing the little rosy pucker—
Draco collapsed, his breath puffing out over his cheek, his eyes near fluttering shut. He moaned softly when he felt the inching thickness inside of him pull out, slowly, only realising what the slick, wet substance that slavered out of his throbbing hole was. Harry had come inside of him.
Harry smirked pleasantly against his cheek, right before his tongue went on with a savage, hungry rhythm, his hands holding an iron-grip on Draco’s shaking thighs to keep him from squirming as he let out another muffled moan.
Draco looked at him again, fire gleaming in his eyes. “No.” He already knew what Harry wanted to ask of him, but not for one second will he ever do it.
Potter threw him a triumphant grin, but Draco refused to react this time—he simply clicked his mouth shut, clearly not willing to satisfy the other’s sinful urges anymore. He shifted on the raven’s lap, shivering when a hand from his hips lowered further and below his skirt, leaving trails of feathery touches that made his breath hitch.
Draco cracked a half-hearted smile. “It’s supposed to be a matching ring.” He slipped it on his finger, admiring his work fondly before catching the other’s bemused look. “Stop grinning, Potter, or I’ll shove this thing down your throat.”
“Yeah?” Draco felt his gaze drop to Potter’s forearms, swallowing at the lean stretch of muscle that braced against one another. “Try me.”
Harry pulled him in for another brutal kiss, the force hard enough that Draco stumbled forwards, shamelessly rutting his own clothed bulge against his. A soft whine slipped from his throat once he felt a hand wantonly travel down the small of his back, then to the hem of his trousers teasingly.
Draco sucked in a breath, his lips curling to argue, but he knew better this time and shoved his pride
The Slytherin fought the urge to shake his head at him, his hips shifting under his intense, emerald gaze. “Potter, you and I both know that I still have more books to go through. I haven’t even finished my summary yet about the Elfric Uprising during 1647—”
A high-pitched moan fluttered from his throat, and Draco swore loudly a moment later. Potter only laughed—fucking
Harry slammed inside him with no warning, eliciting a scream from the blond. Draco broke off with a cry, arching his back helplessly as veiled tears stung in the corner of his eyes. He tugged at his bound, aching arms, only to have Harry hold him firmer in place—all Draco could do was whimper and moan when a rough, brutal pace started tearing him apart.
“Hurts still,” Draco admitted, sniffling again as he burrowed his face in his pillow. “Where’s my blanket?”
Draco grimaced, his shoulders going taut as he sauntered through the quiet halls, too distracted by his own thoughts to bid the guard farewell. Partner. Potter. Of course. He scrunched up his nose in disdain, unconsciously preparing himself as he reached his office. Potter’s office. Their office.
The question was cold and unwavering, meant to make her spill the truth. The truth that she had assisted Harry in his planned escape for months, the truth that she had slipped the Elder Wand to him when she tripped, the truth that she was the only one who knew of what him and Draco really felt for one another.
The look on Potter’s face practically turned feral. “What, you’re gonna tell me that they were wrong?”
Harry abruptly withdrew his fingers, wet and gleaming from saliva under the faint lamplights. Draco groaned, burying his face further into ink-splattered parchment, his cheeks hot. He dropped his right hand to the edge of the table, reaching down to fondle his throbbing cock, slick with the tiny pearl of pre-cum that leaked out.
hissed Draco, hating how his voice stumbled a bit as his face glowed a warm, embarrassed red. “You’re fucked in the head, Potter.”
Potter choked in protest, kicking Weasley—who, in return, cursed aloud. Draco only arched an elegant eyebrow, pursing his lips. “Potter shagged someone too, then?”
“I—” he swallowed, trying to focus on the emerald eyes that peered down at him as his mind screamed for
When padded fingertips reached the far end of Draco’s mouth, hitting the back of his throat, tears had welled at the corners of his eyes, threatening to fall—and Potter must’ve seen it too, because the harsh grip on his hair slowly paused and let go for a bit, and the nails that dug into his skin pulled back.
That seemed to be the wrong thing to say, considering the fact that he spoke too soon before his brain could catch on. Pansy slowly turned her head to him, putting the crystal bottle back on the counter with a light clink.
The warden let out an incredulous scoff, shaking her head. She didn’t talk until they reached another set of stairs at the end of the hall, and Harry could only brace himself as another wave of spells hit him—
Draco wanted to say that he wasn’t in his right state of mind, that this was him and no other, but the way that Potter looked at him like that told him that he knew; knew that this was all achingly
He quickly shook his head, glossy eyes meeting his. “No,” Draco whispered. “Don’t—don’t stop. Please.”
“Who shagged me?” Draco studied Potter carefully, taking note of tense posture and labored breathing. Then, he shrugged. “If I had taken a clear look at him, then I might’ve remembered.”
“Potter,” he breathed, realising just now that Potter’s tongue was no longer fucking him—instead, it was his hard cock, slowly filling his hole up. Draco whimpered as the raven began noisily sucking at his neck with open-mouthed kisses at the same time, teasingly reaching up and licking his earlobe. He felt his wilted cock harden again, making him moan in protest. “Potter, I—”
“Do you really think I don’t know that you love this?” Potter inched two fingers on the blond’s bottom lip, urging his pretty mouth open. “Come on, Draco, you never liked being vanilla—you just always loved the fucking pain with the pleasure, hm?” the blond gagged a little, drool spilling past his lips when Potter took on a steady pace to fuck his mouth.
The fact that he was at Potter’s mercy—and it seemed that the raven knew that too, just from the look of arrogance that he wore and held over the blond’s head—and that he would do anything that the other asked of him, whatever it may be, made his a pit in his stomach burn hot as his body arched.
“Yeah?” mused Draco, a platinum strand of hair falling on his eyes before he quickly brushed it away from sweaty skin. “Tell that to Pansy.”
Usually, Draco wasn’t one to catch the flu, nor have the serious case of an upset stomach. Everyone knew that out of all people, the blond would be the last one to
The blond’s body instantly jolted, a hitched moan leaving him as he thrusted back into the flushed cock that stay inside him.
“Can you speak now?” Harry asked softly, making sure to keep his hands away, no matter how much he wanted to touch him. Hold him. Wrap him with warmth.
Draco tried to lead the wet, sloppy kiss, taking advantage of his higher position as he tilted his head down until their noses were painfully pressed against one another. Potter only chuckled in his mouth, the sound low and muffled just before the grip on the blond’s hair finally tightened and
The warden looked at him. “These people we deal with are not meant to be treated like real human beings, Potter—” there it was; the malice
“You fucking—” he was almost certain his tears had already fallen, slipping down his face and running with the sweat that swathed his skin. “—you
The kiss was nothing sort of the innocent—it was messier than those they’d normally share, but Draco loved it. He loved the brutal tongue that fought against his, loved the teeth clashing together, loved the thread of saliva linking their lips after they pulled apart.
Potter hesitated for a second, glancing around the room, as if he were anticipating for a person to pop out all of a sudden behind the couch. “I wanted to …” he looked feebly guilty. “… talk.”
Potter leaned in, burying his nose between Draco’s arse as his tongue ravaged his rim roughly. He licked, sucked, thrusted inside the Slytherin with his tongue like a starving wolf, feeding off of the slick that secreted from his tight hole. Draco whimpered pathetically, trying to push back, but Potter was gripping his wet thighs so brutally he was sure he’d get bruises by the end of it.
The raven snickered at him, plopping a hand on a pillow that sat on the side. “Lay your head down here.”
Draco felt a rising heat of desire as he blushed a furious red, realising with a mount of shame that he was so close to his orgasm without even being touched—
That was all the other Auror needed as he thrusted in roughly, eliciting a shuddering cry from the blond. Potter set on a brutal pace, growling as Draco clenched around him, not caring any longer that the bounds of his restraints snapped. He didn’t seem to slow at all, even as Draco’s mumbles of ‘please,’ ‘slower,’ and ‘Harry,’ echoed in his ears.
Draco blushed a pretty pink at the perverted thought. “Fuck off.” Making his final decision, he kept his shirt on whilst he slowly worked on pulling off his trousers. His golden-lacquered belt clunked to the floor along with a heavy thunk, letting the cold air hug his fair skin warmly.
He knew going to the club with Potter was a terrible idea—it was the git’s fault that Draco woke up passed out on the floor of his home, with absolutely no recollection of what had happened last night.
Draco tried to shove the black-haired boy away, but it only made his lithe body press deeper into his muscled ones. A hitched groan of irritation echoed from his throat; his eyes fluttering shut.
This time, the challenge in Potter’s stormy eyes were boldly returned, along with a confident smirk that made the other hum pleasantly. Waiting. Even Common Sense grew silent.
He heard Harry chuckle in bemusement behind him; then, without giving him another second to breathe, he thrusted in again with no such intention of being gentle, gripping Draco’s hips roughly to the point where he knew there’d be angry red marks etched on his skin in the morning.
Potter murmured, “always so pretty,” with a small smile as he kept on with the unforgiving pace with his fingers. Draco choked, eyes fluttered shut, realising with mounting horror that if he were pushed any further, tears would fall down his cheeks.
Draco couldn’t help but chuckle at Weasley’s slowly reddening face, but just like Potter, the Gryffindor gathered his wits just as quickly.
I thought visiting my favourite Slytherin was what I deserved after enduring a whole twenty-minute lecture from Hermione about how studying was important.”
It were times like this that drove Draco to the edge, helplessly aching for nothing but more, more and
“Potter,” he tried, his voice no more but a broken rasp to his ears as Potter hummed back, blatantly ignoring him as his hand went further and further, to the small of his back then to the clothed cleft of his arse. Draco let out a soft whine and bucked his hips up, clearly irritated as Potter took his careful time to pull at the fabric of his knickers.
Potter smiled at him sweetly. “You’re coming on nothing but my cock, Malfoy, so why don’t you turn around for me like a good boy?”
Mornings were not spent waking up in each other’s arms anymore, with his back to Harry’s chest that rose and fell slowly with each snore, and arms wrapped around him in a gentle, protective embrace.
Harry threw Draco one last grin, and the blond returned it, just as confidently. It reminded him so much of the young, stubborn rivals they used to be—driven by a wild, raging fire that burned, burned and
Draco tried to stay still as the guard swiftly pulled out his wand, casting a quick Scanning Spell over him. “I don’t always wear a tight button-up suit, if you must know,” he stated coolly, ignoring the same disgruntled looks he received from his other coworkers that passed by.
Harry stared at him, freezing entirely in place, eyes wide as he searched the blond’s face all over. Draco shied away, thinking that maybe he should roll over so he didn’t have to deal with the embarrassment of it all—yet before he could even consider the thought, a hand snuck its way into his, flipping it over so that his palm was lightly stroked by a gentle thumb.
He heard Potter lean in, whispering a praise in his ear that had Draco moaning softly. He only realised his legs were shaking when he felt his trousers fall to his knees, with something hard pressing in on his rim.
he adored the other’s dedication to his work, and he always relished in every moment that he got to spend with him. He knew how much Harry loved being in on the action, even if that meant coming home with a bruise or two.
“What makes you think I would?” Potter countered smoothly, sitting on the leather couch behind him in a too-composed way that made Draco stare. He looked to him, the flicker in his eyes light and delicate. “It could be our little secret—I won’t tell anyone.”
He didn’t hesitate to kick the collar away a moment later, his eyes focusing on Draco’s neck—there was a pale strip of white there, stark against the rest of his skin that was marked with bruises. Bruises that had been thrown out there with no mercy, bruises that had never been able to heal properly, bruises that looked like they were
bad,” Harry’s voice was muffled, his breaths hot as they ghosted over a pale, flushed cheek. It left tingles to dance on his skin, and Draco could’ve sworn that the noise that escaped him was a satisfied purr. “I didn’t get injured or anythin’ like that.”
“Well, since the first month I was thrown in here, I’ve been working on a little something too,” said Draco rather pleasantly, but before he could do anything else, a painful cough wracked out of him—enough to have his weak frame trembling once more.
Draco abruptly broke off, lips gleaming as his voice came out as a growl. “If you’re not gonna fuck me properly, Potter, I’ll—”
Ron’s face turned a pale shade of green. “You did it on his—” he coughed, rubbing small circles on his temples. “I don’t even want to know. Just—just tell Malfoy, but do it gently."
Draco halted, too shocked to stop the sudden choke that spilled out of him, his cheeks turning a darker shade of red as he fumbled over his own loss of words. “What—what the
was what Potter meant. The day he left the blond lost and confused, the day he offered to take another woman’s hand with a beautiful, jeweled ring.
Draco found himself spluttering, the deceitful thing between his thighs twitching against the silk. “It is not—we’re completely—oh, shut it,” he scowled when Potter’s grin became wider, teeth flashing.
Draco nodded quickly, his skin flushing crimson as he shivered. Potter might’ve cast him a reassuring smile, he wasn’t sure, but he didn’t have much time to linger on it as the raven dove in once more with a lust-driven thirst. And here Draco was, straddling him like the cheapest of whores, eyes half-lidded as he writhed.
The woman’s eyes twinkled. “Now, I’m a very busy warden, so are we going to visit Mr. Malfoy or not?”
seriously,” said Draco slowly, rubbing at his eyes with his bone-white knuckles in blatant frustration as his words came out drowsy and mumbled. “You don’t need to—” he paused for a second, wincing at his scratchy throat— “stay home for me.”
He wasn’t facing him right now, but he was almost absolutely certain that Potter grinned. “Either way, I’m gonna see you naked somehow, Malfoy.”
Draco’s jaw dropped, speechless. Sure, he and Potter had grown rather close over the past few years, working together as Aurors, putting their famed rivalry behind them—but not once have they ever gathered enough courage to let things get
Potter tilted his head at him, and Draco suddenly realised that he was waiting for an answer as he quickly rushed for one, stumbling at his own words. “I—I do,
Draco, having already sat on his chair, stiffly crossed his leg over the other. He didn’t answer him for the first few moments as he wandlessly shut the door close, knowing there was a pair of bright green eyes staring at him intently.
Potter,” he said, rolling his eyes as he neatly placed his quill beside his papers, just before turning his whole frame towards the other Auror. “Why? Do you happen to know something that I don’t?”
Then he felt Potter roam his body once more; his chest, his nipples, then his neck. Draco’s cheeks heated, knowing all too well that his neck was abused by one too many love bites. There was a pool of pleasure that swirled in his stomach at the thought of keeping the hickeys instead of spelling them away as Draco would have done with other sexual encounters—but the thought itself of driving the Gryffindor mad by flaunting them around was enough motivation for him to do so.
“Shove off,” muttered Draco irritably, earning a laugh from the other as he finally collected enough courage to throw Potter a glance.
said Draco softly, curling in on himself as he glanced away—almost ashamed of the words that stumbled out of his mouth next. “I was just thinking that you… well,
He made a small noise at the back of his throat as Potter kissed him, and as intimate as it was, neither cared at all as teeth nipped teasingly at plump lips, a whine falling from the blond at the slight sting. Potter let out a throaty groan in Draco’s mouth when the blond shifted lower, inching his other hand to the raven’s thigh and burying his nails as harshly as he could—just for the bitter-sweet ache of revenge.
Potter raised an eyebrow at him, still not averting his gaze. “Paperwork? You’d rather do that than the guy who you literally did it with last night?”
Draco burrowed himself deeper into the pleasant warmth of his soft blankets, letting out a breathy sigh through his nose. He attempted to roll over, tired eyes blinking to a silver clock that stared back at him, only to realise that it was still five in the afternoon—it wasn’t until midnight did Harry come home from work.
“Oh, you have all the symptoms, darling,” clarified Pansy, crooning at him as she brought a hand to his chin, tilting his head up in bemusement. “Neck marked with rosy bruises, red swollen lips, and I think I see a dent of teeth over there; bit of a masochist, was he?”
Potter made a raspy noise that sounded close to a growl as his fingers worked its way to his waist again, finding crinkles in the fabric from how deep he had pressed in earlier on Draco’s delicate skin, but he didn’t mind it at all as he pushed the blond
a sob broke out from Draco, his thighs shaking from the merciless force pounding inside him—it was too much, he needed to come, he felt like he was going to
thing to ever happen to me,” murmured Harry, hoping that the other knew he truly meant it, his voice soft and soothing. “I will never get bored of you—
“There it is,” said Harry softly, silently reveling in how his boyfriend tried to close his legs, as if it would do anything to stop him from rubbing the little, warm nub buried inside. He groaned, twisting his fingers around the tight ring of muscle, making Draco whimper.
Draco started stuttering furiously as a smirk danced on the raven’s lips, only taking a quick second to swiftly gather what was left of his ruined dignity as he narrowed his grey eyes at the other.
“Eyes up here,” snapped Potter, pulling the distracted Slytherin out of his thoughts. Draco was slightly mortified to find his cheeks heating as the raven softened his tone. “Would you mind leaving me alone now?”
“Goddamn,” Draco whispered out, his nose scrunching up as he sniffled. Harry had to hold back a grin, one that got him a harmless jab to the side as he tried to help his dazed boyfriend down on the couch. “I will
He could’ve sworn that he saw the warden’s nose scrunch up a bit, and even if he tried, he wouldn’t have been able to keep in the flame of annoyance that flickered inside him. She took him in for a quick once-over before casting a wordless spell.
All of it made an unpleasant feeling settle in the pit of his stomach, but what made Draco falter was the familiar burn in his eyes—and the sudden blur of the room.
It came out harsher than he’d intended, and it wasn’t really the tone he was going for—if anything, Draco meant to sound like someone who was grateful for even having civil company in the first place.
Draco couldn’t focus on the kiss. He was thrusting up into Potter’s calloused hand, only to have his nipple be tweaked harshly. Draco gasped, and Potter drew back—and though their lips were no longer ravaging one another, that didn’t mean the raven stopped teasing other sensitive parts of his body.
Draco didn’t have to open his eyes to know that Potter was smirking at him. He snuggled closer. “Wandless magic. Show-off.”
Potter seemed to be surprised at the sudden change of mood, letting out a laugh as he placed a light kiss on Draco’s forehead. “Let’s get out of here, yeah?” he murmured.
“Two weeks ago, I found out that the wards here are powerful enough to withhold any prisoner—” he leaned in, rubbing soft circles in Draco’s wrists soothingly— “but not one with the Elder Wand.”
Draco shut his eyes tight, his whisper quiet as he listened to Harry’s soft heartbeat. “I thought you didn’t want me.”
“I advise you to stay still,” she told him decisively, arching an eyebrow before peering down on Hermione. “I’m afraid to disappoint you, Mrs. Weasley, but our little prisoner here is only allowed one visitor a month.”
A scarlet blush crept up on his face as he forced his gaze to wander elsewhere, refusing to look down as his mouth went dry.
Draco’s hole fluttered around Potter, making the other groan, the sound deep in the back of his throat. He couldn’t stop the tremble that left him as he attempted to rise, letting out a soft noise of pleasure when he felt the raven’s cock stretch him out so
A sound—most likely a faint yelp—echoed from his throat. “What?” Draco croaked, now clutching at the hem of his silken shirt like it was his only lifeline.
Draco tried to come up with a response, maybe a witty comeback as he always did in their worthless banter, but nothing left his lips as they parted to speak. It wasn’t often that he was left speechless, but with Potter watching him and his every move like that, the emerald greens in his eyes long gone—he can’t help but feel pinned
Potter seemed surprised for no more than a second before a laugh bellowed from his throat, filled with a wicked delight. “Gods,” he choked on himself, grinning at him. “I never knew I’d
“The Aurors said that they—” the redhead’s muffled voice wavered for a bit, but he only continued further with a small choke— “they didn’t find any bodies.”
“Yeah, well, this wouldn’t have happened if you didn’t flaunt your little one-night stand with Weaslette in front of me!”
Another gasp left him as crimson pain trailed under the other’s fingertips, and Potter took his chance to slip in two fingers inside the warm heat of his mouth. Draco struggled, choking for breath, but a sudden hand that snuck from behind and pulled a fistful of his golden strands made his back arch, a sweet moan falling from his lips as his body couldn’t do anything but melt in the iron-like hold.
Potter thrusted into him, more viciously than the last, needling out a scream from the Slytherin that bounced off the walls. Before Draco even knew it, tears were already running down his face from the blissful pain washing over him. “Fuck—oh fuck—please let me come, please—”
Potter barked out a short laugh, to which the other replied with a fierce glare that practically spoke fire. He ignored the scowling blond as his hand calmly reached for a glass on the counter, swirling with a golden honey that sparkled. “And you’re the one calling me a deviant, Malfoy,” he mused, lifting the drink to his lips.
His shoulders trembled against his small frame as the three fingers pressed in once more, another moan spilling out of him. Potter helped himself to a wry grin at the soft, lewd noises as the blond breathed out shakily, eyes falling shut as he mumbled a near-silent plead.
“You want to marry me?” Draco whispered, his eyes fixed on the silver ring that stood out in the dark—it was studded with a fair emerald that twinkled back at him, curved with tiny snakes that bore the whitest scales. It was—it was
Draco nodded, or so what he hoped was a nod as he let out a shaky exhale, too hazy in the mind and focused on the crisp scent from the other to notice the hands curling from behind him, carefully unravelling out folds and folds of dark velvet that his pale skin, which trickled from all the over-heated sweat.
“Propose to her,” Draco finished, his gaze travelling down. He should be pushing this man away from him, as far as possible; he should be fighting and kicking, but none of that urged him to move—not even the bittersweet ache in his heart.
“We’re—we’re at work,” he whispered again, but couldn’t stop himself from parting his mouth in a breathless groan as teeth grazed the sensitive spot under his ear.
i'm leaving the rest to your imagination <3 can this be a considered a happy ending? i don't know, you tell me-
It went like that for a while—with the raven slipping out of his uniform attire, and Draco sitting there in a warm heap of blankets as he beheld the other with a wide-eyed gaze. It wasn’t until did Harry come over, plopping on their bed and lightly nudging for the blond to move so he could get in as well, did Draco turn a lovely shade of pink as he shifted a bit to offer some space.
“It was a mistake,” whispered Harry, nuzzling his nose in his crown of blond locks. “I realised I was missing on the best thing that ever happened to me.”
Potter raised his hands to his head. “All right, all right, I’m kidding! See, no wands here.” He showed his palms outwardly to Draco, showing that he was indeed unarmed. “Forgive a guy for celebrating over the fact that his dick is bigger than his rival’s.”
Draco watched, slightly uneasy as Potter tilted the glass up, his dark-skinned throat tensing up while his Adam’s apple bobbed. He turned his head to look away, mortified at what he had just been staring at as the empty chalice was placed back on the counter. Had Potter just downed all that in one swallow?
Potter’s mouth went dry. “We … we never really talked, or—or discussed things, you know? I wanted to check on you, see how you’re doing, especially after the …”
Draco kept his eyes shut, only realising that his back had arched off the wall and was pressing unto Potter’s powerful body. “Potter,” he whined, not quite sure what he was asking for. “Potter, come on, I—”
Draco let out strings of moans, knowing he was flushing red, and even more so when he felt a hand steadily tug down his pants, revealing a swelling cock that pressed against his stomach.
“Well, er,” Ron splayed his hands out helplessly, “I’m not ‘Mione, but you should probably tell him.”
Harry flashed him a wiry smile. His hand traveled up Draco’s back, making him tremble slightly as it trailed over his shoulder blades, then up his bruised neck. “Well, from what I know . . .” Draco’s lips parted, letting out a near-quiet, breathless sound as Harry ruffled his hair, tucking golden strands away. “That’s when there’s tears and sweat sticking to your face, right after I fuck you just about anywhere, hard and rough, to see you moaning and whimpering so desperately . . .” He went scarlet under Harry’s intense gaze. “Just for me.”
another sneeze came out of Draco, and he stuck his bottom lip out in irritation; if anything, it made him look almost child-like. “I am not some
“Be patient,” Potter chided at him, clicking his tongue as the fist on platinum hair pulled just slightly—a warning. One that had Draco’s cheeks turning a pale crimson as he made a pathetic attempt to nod. That was when a hand snuck below his own fingertips, the grip on his hair slowly becoming loose, only for the blond to hurriedly tap three times into the other’s calloused palm because hell, all the wanted then was more, more, and
Harry looked at him, huffing for air as well. He stared at Draco, a hint of a satisfied smirk on his lips at how unkempt he’d easily made the Slytherin. “Either I fuck you in a nice, comfy bed like a proper gentleman—” Draco trembled, unconsciously closing his legs, only for Harry’s knee to knead deeper into his bulge, making him whimper. “—or I do it here, on your desk, naked and bent over for me.”
Hermione let him go. Harry swallowed the knot that stuck in his throat, letting his head drop down as he managed a small nod. The near-quiet clicks of boots on the stone-cold floor rung in his ears, beckoning him in—all the way to the stairwell in the far end, where he knew the most criminal of them were kept away.
interested to me,” Potter pointed out, cocking his head at him with a wild glint in his eyes. The smirk on his face was almost cat-like—promising, even. “Your Slytherin friends told me that you were quite good at it, too.”
“What’s it gonna be, Malfoy?” Potter asked, voice low, as if he couldn’t see the tears that Draco were desperately fighting to keep from slipping down his rosy, flushed cheeks. “You’re gonna let me cum then leave you here, all alone, until someone finds you like this?” he chuckled as he brushed against the blond’s abused prostate once more, watching as the maid-clad other was helpless to stop the sob that fell from his lips.
the raven’s head perked up slightly, a wildfire of dark green burning in his eyes as the blond cried out, his near-wet lashes fluttering close tightly. “Please, it’s too much, I can’t take it, I—“
“I’m the warden,” a woman said with a taut smile, offering out a hand. She chuckled to herself when Harry didn’t take it, his face blank as she clicked her tongue at him. “Never expected a female to take on a job like this, huh?”
“I’d like to inform you that my partner had been kind enough to—to leave only a few marks,” Draco snapped, hating how he stuttered at the last part as a flustered heat brought a flame to his cheeks.
Draco didn’t look up as Weasley entered his office, adorning a smile that was way too bright for his own good. Rubbing the bridge of his nose, he sighed as he put down his papers with a wince. “What could you possibly want this late in the afternoon, Weasley?”
He felt Potter lick his earlobe slowly, tantalizingly. Draco’s head thumped against the wall as he let his eyes close, the tiny whine that left his lips hanging in the air.
“—can you believe it, ‘Mione? They’re making up these stupid theories now about how Harry broke that
A stuttered sound of surprise left Draco as Potter shoved three fingers at once into him, pressing into the small, warm nub that was buried deep within, making his body thrash before a high-pitched whine left him once more. Potter finally backed away from the kiss, breathless as so was the shaking blond, just before him an entirely wolfish look.
Harry’s breath stuck in his throat as a horrible white noise filled his ears. He didn’t know when he stopped walking, but he did.
But a voice in his head told him that it wasn’t, that the wounded man bathed on his own blood was entirely and achingly real, that that must’ve been where the strong coppery stench had come from, because it was slowly reaching him and cradling his face and—and he—
Draco’s mind tried to hurry for an answer, or maybe even a small remark of defiance from him, but just the thought of Potter leering up at him with his lips twisted into a mean grin was enough for a quiet, desperate noise to escape him while a finger slowly circled his puckered hole.
Potter pulled away, rising slightly, but nonetheless towering over the blond’s trembling form as he innocently tilted his head at him. Draco had always felt pride in being taller than him, knowingly smirking whenever Potter couldn’t reach something, but at the moment, he’s never felt smaller under his dark sultry gaze.
That was until Potter unexpectedly nudged his thigh between the blond’s trembling legs, hoisting it upwards so that the other could
Draco tried to jerk his wrists away from Potter’s stern hands, but the other was having none of it. The blond let a soft moan fall from his lips because gods, he was so close, just a little more—
Potter hummed, a promising glint in his eye as he pulled the blond to his feet, making him stumble. Before Draco could complain any further, he found himself roughly shoved against a wall, his trousers loose and low past his hips.
he blurted out, expecting an answer that somewhat ranged from ‘no’ to a down-right witty remark (you can’t blame him, Draco could be… surprising, sometimes)—but instead, all he received was a faint nod.
“Shit,” Draco whispered, feeling the familiar rush of hotness rise in his cock. He shut his eyes tightly. “I need to—” another sob escaped his body, making him tremble. “Potter—”
It wasn’t often that he became self-conscious, especially about his type of fashion—it was just that it wasn’t really popularly known that he, Draco Malfoy, rumored Death-Eater heir, expert Auror and Potioneer in the Ministry, wore soft
“Ah,” said Draco softly, pulling back a smile as he let the other bury his nose in a ruffled mess of blond hair, inhaling slowly. Taking
Potter slammed home as Draco cried out, releasing his come unto the white-splattered walls as he felt something as equally as dirty and wet fill his insides. “F—fuck.” Potter came inside him. Potter came inside him.
Even as his boyfriend’s face was buried in his hands, hidden from sight, he could see that the blond’s face was ghostly pale—lacking the pink, healthy flush that would typically sit atop his nose and cheeks. Harry’s worry only increased a ten-fold when he caught the dark circles underneath half-lidded eyes, and the evident
This time, Harry didn’t hesitate to practically stop whatever he was holding to walk over to the blond hurriedly. He ignored Draco’s complaints and weak attempts to swat him away as a hand was lifted to a milk-white neck, one that
Before Harry could ask what he was up to, Draco pulled out a delicate circlet of wood that was dappled with tiny bits of blood—and atop it, was a dainty, speckled leaf. It looked tiny and fragile, as if it could easily break at any moment with just one touch.
He knew that the moment he heard the soft wails that echoed around each breath they took, felt the abrupt warmth that the darkness embraced him with, shivered against the heavy magic that were hauled on his shoulders—
“You don’t leave in the middle of a lap-dance, Malfoy,” Potter mused slyly, helping himself to a wicked grin when Draco couldn’t answer right away, his mind too hazy and distracted in the growing
“It’s for safety measures,” she informed him, turning on her heel. “As long as you follow my lead, then I’m sure we’ll—”
his words were hoarse, and every staggering breath felt like a stab to his heart. Draco found himself standing up abruptly, making his head spin with a sinful rage. “I would have understood, instead you made me watch you propose to her like an idiot, you—” a sob clawed at his throat. “—you fucking
“You’d think that the Deputy Head of the Ministry would know about the safety spells in Azkaban,” the warden said with a tiny, tight-lipped smile as she threw an innocent look back at them. “Turns out I was wrong.”
Until Potter slowed, nonchalantly pulling out as he inspected his fingers, coated and gleaming with thick saliva. Draco whimpered softly, knowing what mess he must’ve looked at the moment—hair tangled, his face streaked with messy tears that fell to his chin, lips plump and swollen…
He held in a breath as they descended further into another deeper part of Azkaban—and what made his stomach churn and his head dizzy was the awful, sickly smell that filled his nose and the lifeless shadows that trailed after him.
He could tell that the blond was ready to shake his head, most likely to argue back with him and refuse—but just then, Draco let out a tiny, kitten sneeze that left him shaking in the other’s arms.
But Potter didn’t reply, only rolling his head back slightly as his nape hit the couch, just before emerald eyes peered back up with a twisted laugh. “And what, exactly, makes you think I’m letting you come at all?”
“You’re flushed and sweating,” said Potter softly, one hand curling to the side of Draco’s face. He couldn’t read what was in those vivid eyes of emerald. “You need a shower. You don’t want to go to bed all sticky and wet, do you?”
He grimaced at the flame that glinted in Potter’s eyes, not realising his shoulders were tense as it died down to nothing but empty abyss.
Draco groaned, crossing his arms. “Fine. Go ahead, you brute.” He watched Pansy shoot him a grin, her manicured hands carefully plucking out a bottle of thick, pale cream from the counter.
Hot, untamed magic thrummed in his veins as it tore through him, dancing on his fingertips with merciless rage. Harry only stilled as the echo of shattered iron and snapped chains clashed to the floor.
“You don’t think?” Harry groaned, letting his face fall into his hands. “What the hell am I supposed to do now?”
“Knew you were aroused by this.” Potter went after his throat again, his sinful tongue licking and sucking on the pink marks that were lovely against the pale skin. Draco couldn’t help but to harshly bite on his bottom lip, trying not to let more embarrassing sounds from escaping.
When thick silence answered her back, she finally dared to throw a glance at Ron. Heavy splotches of red were painted over his freckled cheeks, an evident tell-tale that told her about how upset he had been earlier—and with it, tired eyes that blinked back furiously, mouth wobbling as half-coherent words tumbled out.
When Draco’s breath had evened out just slightly, his heart thumping in his ears, he blinked his wet lashes open to find Potter smiling at him in triumphant victory, one hand wrapping around the blond’s cock and making him writhe as he whimpered.
“You’re beautiful like this.” Draco mewled in the boy’s arms, the two long digits pumping inside him in a torturous pace while a hand fondled his balls. “I want to do so many things to you, you know? I bet you like it hard and rough, me tying you up and fucking you ‘till you can’t see straight. Would you like that, kitten?”
A rush of fear and lust clutched at him, because Potter was right there, inches away from his face, perfectly naked that Draco swore he could feel a steel-hard erection brushing lightly against his thigh—
But when Draco swiftly swiveled around to walk out the shower stalls entirely, a calloused hand tugged him back with defiance.
“I told you—the prisoners needed to be taught a lesson,” the warden answered airily, as if they were no more but two friends talking about the weather. “There are some that we personally keep in their cells from time to time so they could learn how to behave.”
Draco couldn’t help a confused glance at Potter when his fingers pulled out, his hips shifting below him for a bit, only to realise what he was doing when black-leathered trousers were taken off at the thighs down at a particular point, perfectly lowered to reveal a—
Something like a wild, fierce anger roared in his head, yelling at him, brewing a storm that raged in its wake—and even if Harry had the chance to force it down, he wouldn’t have taken it.
Harry held out a panicked hand almost instantly as he nearly dropped the velvet box—but the blond just shook his head with a wince, waving him off. Draco twisted slightly to his left as his other hand fumbled around from behind, tapping a few times on the stained floor.
Draco’s throat closed up, his grey eyes wide as he slowly realised that both their uniforms were half-way unbuttoned, with loose buttons and strings dangling about. His head was much too clouded with blank lust to be focused on anything else; not when he could see the golden, tan skin that hid under all the pleats of his shirt.
“To hell with that,” interrupted Harry, his voice thick and low. When Draco’s eyes rose to meet his, his breath caught in his throat at the serious, shadowed stare that peered back. “I haven’t had you for two weeks because of this upcoming test, and I’m currently in the mood to fuck my boyfriend senseless tonight.”
Harry seemed surprised for a split second, but it was soon replaced with a half-hearted smile. He laid the towel to the side, caressing Draco’s face delicately as he planted a light kiss on his crown of blond hair. “As long as you want me to, love.”
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe the fact that we—that we—” Potter let out a string of curses, “—that you’re my Auror partner!”
Draco let out a breath he hadn't realised he was holding, his lips pulling into a tired smile. "Gods, Harry, I thought you were . . ." he trailed off, staring at his boyfriend, who was diligently taking off his invisibility cloak. "Wait—you're
Draco knew all chances of stopping has disappeared now. He weakly angled his head up, letting Harry’s hands fumble around his school robes desperately as heat and white-hot arousal torched his skin.
Laurent finished the scan, throwing him a bemused sort of smile. “Well, it fits you. I’ll be looking forward for your partner’s reaction, Mr. Malfoy.” He gestured to the office door embedded on the far hallway. “Have a good day.”
He felt like he was suffocating, his breath puffing in the smoke-white air that made his skin tingle. His eyes fluttered shut, and he could’ve sworn he passed out for a few moments then. He couldn’t hear anything, not when high-pitched screams and cries for help echoed above.
Trembling, Harry reached out to cradle his face in his hands, a face that now felt strange an unfamiliar to him—only for the other to flinch, as if he were waiting for him to strike.
Draco’s chest rose and fell in an uneven pattern, his breathing hard as he glanced at the other man with a confused look.
The stern hold that he had on Draco’s silken hips became dangerously still, and the rest of the blond’s remarks instantly died on his tongue. He had wanted to see just how far Potter could be pushed over the edge—just how much it took to make Potter
Harry raised both eyebrows at him until they practically reached his hairline, a broad look that said,
and with it, a shallow thrust that elicited a cry from the other, one that dangerously neared a sob.
“Gods,” Potter groaned, using one hand to press the blond’s head deeper into the wall as a hand snuck its way to the crying blond’s hips. “Just like last night.
“You’re gonna be late,” Draco pointed out, making the mistake of standing up too quickly as his knees gave out underneath him—Harry only had one moment to react before reaching out straight away to steady the trembling blond as a pained groan fluttered between them.
“You have got to be kidding me,” said Draco flatly, glancing to the side as his hands twitched and fiddled with the fabric of his dress. He furiously kept his gaze down on himself, trying to fight the intrusive scenarios in his head that seemingly appeared out of nowhere, ones that made his hands curl in on themselves anxiously.
“Look at you. So perfect for me.” Draco’s mouth parted slightly, reaching a hand to provide the attention his dripping cock needed. Potter noticed it right away, gripping the blond’s delicate wrist in warning. “Don’t touch yourself unless I say so.”
Potter’s thumb nudged at the blond’s bottom lip, just as the raven stared up at him with a bold, impatient look. When Draco refused to part his lips with a cocked eyebrow, the boldness not fitting in with the rest of his flushed state, Potter rolled his eyes at him before digging his fingers sharply against the blond’s thigh.
The aurors had barely spared a moment to throw her a doubtful look before nodding curtly, their steps soon fading away into nothing but harsh, ringing silence.
“Hey,” his boyfriend said, slightly breathless as he strolled into their bedroom without a mind. His hair was a tousled mess,
Draco faked a polite smile as he went past one of the security guards up front the main entrance. “Laurent.”
“For your information, these are bruises,” he told her flatly, ignoring the faint ringing in his ears when short, broken pieces of the drunken party flashed before his eyes. “I got into a dirty fight with a wasted sod last night, and at the time, the odds were certainly not in my favour.”
Weasley’s grin turned entirely feral. “I thought you of all people would know, Malfoy, that it’s disrespectful to refuse dinner with your boyfriend’s family.”
This time, Potter didn’t hesitate to pull on Draco’s hair tighter, eliciting a hitched moan that fluttered from the other’s bruised throat as he drew out two fingers that were slicked with sheen, wet saliva.
Draco shivered, writhing on the cock that twitched in him as he breathed out a moan. He wondered what he must’ve looked to the other at the moment—with silver, tangled hair that was firmly tugged at by a harsh hand; with flushed cheeks that were coloured pink, all the way to the tips of his ears; with a mouth that parted slightly as the bottom lip redder than the rest; and to finish all that, a maid outfit that no longer was as pretty as it had been, with silken lace sprawled messily over his lap, wrinkled and soiled with thin trails of saliva.
“It is,” Harry whispered back with a grin, and he could’ve sworn that there was a bit of pride there, with the way he spoke of it. “I’ve never felt that with somebody else before, Draco—it’s always been
“But you—” the blond’s mouth dropped, even as he gestured helplessly to the folders and assorted papers on the floor. “I hate to be so blunt, but you
“Still bad?” Harry asked softly, not hesitating to run a hand through the blond’s tousled hair as Draco let out a pleased sigh, his eyes slipping shut at the gentle touch.
Harry didn’t know when he shut his eyes, but he did—and he had only realised when he felt delicate fingertips brush over his cheek, whilst a scarred palm rose up to his dark, unkempt hair. He let the blond play with it, his grey eyes sparkling with amusement as the strands broke apart.
The woman only shrugged, turning away as Harry clutched unto Hermione’s forearms and helped her up. He felt something brush against his wrist and under his sleeve, but he paid it no mind.
“You’re right,” said Potter quietly, every word right and measured, “I just meant that I’m here, you know? As a…as a friend. You can tell me anything or nothing at all—I don’t care.”
Potter let out a raspy groan as the blond came all over his hand, a splatter of thick white into his palm as his hold on his waist slackened for a short moment. Draco’s shaking body went pliant as the hand curled around him again just as quickly, pulling him closer into each heavy thrust as the raven no longer bothered to be graceful with every little graze over the warm nub inside the breathless blond.
“That,” the blond said irritably, flicking his wrist in Potter’s direction. The other man murmured a faint ‘oh’ as the sound of fingers drumming against wood finally ceased, leaving the air still and empty.
Draco didn’t spare a glance at him. “No, frankly, it doesn’t.” When dry silence answered him back, almost as if the gods wanted to mock him, the blond frustratedly let out a growl that had his quill startle and roll to the floor. “Why am I even
beneath him, the fingers that worked around his waist and tugged at the black silk, the hot breath that warmed over the sensitive skin just under his ear, and—
Another flush furiously took over Draco’s face, and he didn’t hesitate to take his hand off his mouth as he parted his lips slightly to throw an off-handed remark—this was when he caught the glint of challenge in Potter’s eyes, just as the hands on his velvet waist pushed him
When the door swung open with a near-silent creak, the raven’s eyebrows shot up, evidently impressed as his gaze travelled up and down. Draco didn’t hesitate to glare at him through narrowed eyes, as if to threaten him if he dared do anything.
they’d take this little game of theirs—Draco tentatively rolled his hips, slow and tantalising. And even though the satin ruffles of his skirt prevented him to see anything else from underneath, he could’ve sworn that he felt something clothed and hard stir against his skin.
Draco yelped in surprise, jolting as cold gusts of wind hit his bare skin like ice. He scrambled to set himself upright, out of breath, taking a few moments to realise that Harry had single-handedly got him out of his clothes with no more than a small wave of his wrist.
“Look, I … I realised it was a mistake,” said Potter quietly, his words no more than a void to Draco’s ears. Empty. Hollow. “I just felt like there were—there were so many things, going on at once, and I didn’t know what to do.”
“So responsive,” said Harry fondly, licking a broad stripe on the crease of his arse, making Draco shudder. It was so perversely delightful, so unbefitting for a prim and proper Malfoy like him, but just then, he didn’t care. “Don’t clench, love.”
Harry threw her one last look, taking in her face before he smiled—there was an etch of sadness there, he knew. “Bye, Hermione.”
Hermione’s breath stumbled, her heart thumping too loudly for her own ears. She decide to stay silent, holding Ron there in her arms, whispering comfort to not only calm him—but herself. They both needed it.
Potter didn’t even blink. “Take the shirt off, Malfoy.” He cocked his head at him, his darkening eyes glinting and feral. Hungry. Starving. An invitation that could possibly turn things around for the both of them.
When Draco made a soft sound of protest, red tinting his flushed cheeks as the ache in his trousers grew painful to bear, Potter only responded by tsking at him and clutching a fistful of his pretty, pristine locks. Draco gasped, mouth parted to hiss out a likely insult, but it wasn’t until the other man sharply pulled his head back when he let out a sweet moan.
“You’ll what?” murmured Harry, thumbing the blond’s bottom lip open with two fingers. Draco trembled, letting his mouth part, his pink tongue swirling around the digits that shamelessly explored him. “Funny, ‘cause I remember someone telling me that I wasn’t fucking you properly.”
Draco fiddled with his quill for what seemed to be the umpteenth time. After hours of frustrated muttering and resorting of folders that Weasley had ever-so-ruined, he became restless. Even as Potter came back with a nervous smile, neither of them exchanged a word with the other.
A blank, white noise filled his ears, and it was all that Draco could hear as his tired body went slack as he felt a calloused hand on his cock pull away, along with two arms that lifted his hips just slightly for Potter to pull out. A quiet whimper left the blond from over-sensitivity, his thighs shaking in discomfort as he heard the whisper of a cooling charm, then the feel of a cold wind that tickled at his skin.
“Ah,” she hummed, noticing that his attention went elsewhere—to the two aurors that stood by her side. “Boys, why don’t you take a short break for now? I’ll handle it from here.”
“Draco!” Pansy’s head slipped inside the bathroom, her eyes going slightly wide as she took in Draco’s half-naked body, still sheen with trickling water running down his backside. “Looks like someone had a fun night.”
Instead, Draco let his competitive flare arise inside of him, knowing that amongst all other traits, this was one that Potter knew too well—he never backed down. So, with hands that refused to tremble, he rolled his head back slightly as his eyes slipped shut, blinking them open a mere second later with a gleam of the very same, cunning Slytherin he used to be.
Draco watched, frozen and shaking as Harry fell into the forest of flames, engulfed by the rolls of white-hot embers and scarlet that buried his body beneath. No, no
Draco didn’t utter a word. He only nestled his face in the crook of Harry’s neck, shivering as he breathed in his crisp, earthen scent. He melted in the warm embrace, letting himself get lost for a moment.
“You want that, Malfoy?” Potter murmured, and he could’ve sworn there was a fondness in his voice as his breath caressed the blond’s cheek—to which Draco only glanced away from, turning an exquisite shade of red.
Potter threw him a look, one that no longer had the arrogant smirk that it had earlier—instead, it was replaced with a dark, riled stare that buried beneath the blond’s skin, noticing the way he swallowed in the timid tension.
his nails digging roughly into silken hips. He knees felt weak as they gave in, a quiet whine spilling from his lips as he couldn’t help a jerk of his hips against the touch. A furious heat rose in his cheeks from the lewd sound that just escaped him, and Potter must’ve heard it too, because he had thrown the blond a smug little look before leaning over to his flushed cheek.
Draco gasped out, and everything tilted. The scorching fire that burned his skin was gone, melting into darkness. All white noise blanked out of his head, and all he could feel were steady arms holding him with a familiar sort of gentleness. No one ever did that to him. No one other than …
“Hey, hey,” the voice whispered gently, “you saved me, remember?” hands cupped Draco’s face, careful and delicate. Harry. That was Harry holding him, murmuring comfort in his ears, letting him crumble in his arms. “You saved us and got us out of that pit.”
“I have my ways,” Draco whispered back, his words a tiny bit drowsy as a small smile broke from his lips, even if they ached as he did so. “Unlike you, I suppose, especially when it comes to the topic of fashion.”
Draco shut his eyes again, letting out a broken sob that he hadn’t realised he was holding for so long. The pain was agonizing, making him feel like it was Sectumsempra all over again, yet this time …
Potter’s smirk grew, his eyes twinkling as a chuckle echoed in his ears. “That’s all you have to say?"
Draco’s mouth parted in disbelief as Harry kicked his shoes off, his jacket falling from his shoulders as he let out a loud, contented sigh. A question sat on the tip of the blond’s tongue, but he couldn’t find it in himself to speak with his sleep-addled mind as he simply watched, utterly
Draco smiled to himself; perfect quiet. He neatly placed his quill on the side, savouring every second of silence that ticked by, then—
Draco slipped a pearl-trimmed comb through his blond locks, staring at his own reflection through the mirror with a disdainful sniff. A thick blanket wrapped around his waist, one side dangerously dipping down to his hips. He’d always fancied hot, warm baths—it was something he looked forward to after going through hours and hours of tiring paperwork.
“Not yet, kitten,” growled Potter, pulling away and looking astounded at what he’s done to the Malfoy heir. Draco found himself panting, scrambling to grasp Potter’s hand away from his leaking cock.
“What do you want me to do?” he finally sneered, crossing his arms over his chest. “Pour tea for you, sit here and look pretty, or maybe even offer a little lap dance for you and your sadistic urges?”
Potter smiled at him, running a hand through Draco’s hair. “Same.” The Slytherin heard him whisper a soft Scourgify, letting the earnest sweat and water on their body vanish into thin air like a cool breeze. Draco muttered something incoherent.
Draco gawked after them, right before deciding to close his mouth and curse Weasley to the darkest depths of hell.
A throaty moan echoed in the cramped shower stall they were in as Draco pushed back at Potter, making the both of them groan.
“Look at you, all debauched,” he heard a voice murmur, almost fondly. Draco went crimson, nestling closer with a delicate pink flush on his face once more. A hand tilted his head up slightly, carefully dabbing the hot cloth at the drool of saliva that dribbled down his chin.
