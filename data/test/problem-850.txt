Harry walked to Guild Street early the next morning. Just as Fish had said, there was a skinny gap in between a derelict greengrocer and a greasy spoon, barely wide enough for a person. Harry pulled his hood up over his head, trying not to be too obvious in his approach, just in case Malfoy saw and decided to run.
it. He couldn't wait to tell Adhikari.
Harry realised his mouth was open, and shut it with a click. Malfoy looked away sharply.
"Potter," said Malfoy in his ear at one point, as they stared at an array of weirdly shaped sunglasses. "This isn't normal for Muggles, is it?"
Harry grinned at Malfoy over his shoulder.
Neville, to Harry's surprise, settled down at the table and frowned into his mug.
Ron straightened up, eyes wide and rather red from laughing.
. So I grabbed what little I owned and went back to Jen's pub. They told me he was a nasty piece of work and a prick and Fish even offered to smash his head in, and for a moment they made me feel like I was maybe not entirely deserving of what I'd got. But then he turned up with flowers again, and he promised that he'd book himself into anger management, and that he'd never felt this way about anyone or anything, all the things he started out saying… and I was too exhausted to say no. I didn't
"I do," said Harry, tucking his hands into his pockets. "Special occasion."
"Funny how things work out," said Harry, staring at the lines of Draco's profile, gilded by the streetlights, aristocratic features no less perfect for the bobble hat.
Christmas was a wild blur of Weasley hugs, eggnog, and being repeatedly told that he
"In the dark?"
"Okay," Harry said. "You remember the door spell?"
Malfoy, who was still staring at Harry, looked at Seamus a little blankly before answering.
"Personality, not gender," he said off-handedly. "Does that mean that spray stuff actually works?"
Harry was furious with himself for his fixation, and every time Malfoy left the house that furiousness knotted itself into a tight ball of shame, because it felt like Malfoy was going somewhere he couldn't follow.
Harry wasn't sure whether it was the weirdness on confident show, the wide-eyed tourists being gently buffeted around, or the way that occasionally someone covered in safety pins would wink at him, but there was something different about walking into this crowd. Usually, he'd be panicky by now, limbs twitching and head down, but he vanished into absolute mediocrity compared to the spandex-trousered man in a giant furry hat, or the giggling barely clad girls enjoying a morning dance in the middle of a shop.
"Turns out he's
"It's very difficult to properly feel sorry for oneself when one's nemesis is also there sulking in the corner," he said. "I'm about as capable of enjoying Quidditch today as I am capable of enjoying forks to the eyes, but if we do something else, will you let me enjoy my misery in peace?"
Malfoy went silent at the next song, though, staring at the wall intently as he listened, and Harry tuned in to the lyrics. Be a good boy, try a little harder, you've got to measure up, make me prouder.
"All this because you can't cope with hating someone and fancying them at the same time?"
Malfoy gave him a funny look.
"Oh my God," said Ginny.
"Yes please," agreed Harry. Seamus grinned and pulled his head back into the corridor. "And bring the biscuits!"
Harry could feel the pulse of his heartbeat in his ears as he slipped downstairs to the front door. He took a deep breath, resisted the urge to check himself in the mirror, and swung the door wide.
"Oh," she said, "Of course. That'll be nice."
Malfoy must have seen his distaste, and misread it, because he flushed and pulled himself tighter into his sleeping bag.
He kept his eye on Malfoy as he ate. He had no idea what he was going to do, but then plans were not really in his nature. The first thing to do seemed to be to ascertain what Pansy's role was in all of this.
Malfoy snorted.
meant.
"Hope not," said Harry, smirking.
Harry didn't think Ginny could get any more red than she already was, but she did.
"Not yet, Harry, but I'm working on it," said Ron, giving him a wink. "Best pass training first, before I take over the whole department. Anyway, better dash."
. Spider was annoyed at me for it, for the state of the flat and how little effort I was putting in. One day, when he was particularly annoyed with me, I asked him for a paracetamol and he told me we'd run out. I didn't really think we had, part of me knew he said it just to mess with me, so I toughed it out for a few days, but I started feeling shivery, like I had the flu, and then when I told him about it Spider was all nice as pie again, sitting me down on the sofa and saying he was sorry, that of
"Yes, I know. And I also know that one can't cast aspersions on The Statute of Wizarding Secrecy without people wondering if you're the next Grindelwald. But honestly, Granger. You have Muggle parents. There's no way you haven't asked yourself why they have to have harder lives to preserve our secret? Do we
Pansy blinked. To Harry's alarm, it looked as though she were on the verge of tears.
Draco pushed himself away, teeth biting Harry's lower lip as he went, and Harry looked at him blankly, confused and disappointed.
, it was shock, not pleasure, not power, not desire – except Harry could suddenly see the appeal of wrapping a hand around Malfoy and pumping until Malfoy lost control.
"Lovely soup, Harry, is it Kreacher's recipe?" said Luna, and Draco actually started beside her.
Harry burned at the injustice of that, but he knew he had only himself to blame. It wasn't as though he'd stopped to eavesdrop in the hope two Slytherin buddies would say nice things about him, after all.
don't."
"Are you, though?" said Harry mildly, looking him in the eye. Malfoy's expression dropped.
"Ah, shit, what's my line," he said. "'Harry Potter, you better unhand my missus'?"
"And of course," said Draco, looking very strange, "At some point, if you really want to turn this into a hostel… you may find yourself homeless."
"Very good, thank you for asking," she said, equally polite. "I've been writing a paper on mind potions which you might find quite interesting. You were rather good in school."
"Well, I
"Oh, and Miss Granger?"
And there was Malfoy, of course.
"Harry," he said slowly. "Are
"If I can manage it," he said. Harry stared at him; Ron had always craved recognition, but this was something different. It was as though he'd finally realised that he didn't have to covet it — he could just have it, if he worked for it enough.
A moment of silence.
"I live at Number 12, Grimmauld Place," he said, defeated. "Please, come in."

" he muttered, wandless, giving the alley a shifty once-over for onlookers. "Malfoy, what the fuck?"
Malfoy looked furious and embarrassed.
Harry woke again around half-past seven, a beam of dawn light piercing through the curtains, falling into his eyes. He sat up, torn between the twin urges of thirst and the need to urinate. He slipped his arm out under Draco, careful and slow.
"'Mione. For the love of God don't encourage him in that direction. He'd bring

Kreacher scowled even deeper.

"I do… appreciate it," said Malfoy, through gritted teeth. "The… taking an interest you're doing. I don't

bit into men... I mean, what do you think, Harry?"
Harry slept fitfully that night, strange dreams of running and spiders and Malfoy screaming his name, pale and pinched, blood pouring from his chest. He woke with a start at the sound of the upper staircase creaking.
Harry blinked at her. Mornings were not his strong point; Ginny, however, had been training for two hours already.
"Tell me something new," said Ron, who was trying to pull on his training uniform without stopping his breakfast. Hermione brushed crumbs off his robes with an exasperated smile.
"So it
"Oh God," said Hermione. "I'd forgotten about that."
"No," said Ginny, "The other one with a siren in it."
"If it's gonna turn into anyone's weird sex cult, it'd be Luna's," offered Seamus, a grin in his voice.
here. I could have gone, you know."
Malfoy took a deep breath, but he still looked grey. Harry considered him, wondering what it was that was bothering him, specifically. He'd said it was different from his experience with the Dark Mark, he'd encouraged Harry to say yes, so it couldn't be the principle of the thing. Wet, black ink was oozing from his freshly drawn lines, but it was hardly gory — he couldn't even see the needles. He wondered if it were about the pain. God knows they'd all seen too much torture.

Seamus scoffed.
Harry wondered if he should announce his presence, but he couldn't think of anything meaningful to say. He felt, abruptly, exhausted.
"Because of the aforementioned

"Then one night we were drinking," he said, in such a tone that Harry's stomach dropped even further. "It started out so well, he was on fine form, doing stupid shit and making jokes about the telly, but at some point it went sour and we started fighting, and he hit me."
He looked up again, to check if Dean now hated him; Dean's frown faded into a surprised sort of understanding.
"You mean he kissed you? Without being able to smell you? Oh my god... are you really upset?"
"Oh, you

Blaise, at least, looked similarly uneasy, bordering on alarmed.
and come down in those accursed velvet trousers and a shirt, usually not done up, and sometimes he wore a studded bracelet, obviously from Camden, that made Harry's mouth go dry and his thoughts blur into nothing.
They walked down a side road and emerged onto another street. It was immediately clear they were in the right place. The way to Camden Lock was obvious on their right, painted on a large bridge above the road, and on their left stretched a street that was almost stranger than Diagon Alley. The shop fronts were painted bold, bright colours, huge figures fixed high on the walls. Harry could see giant logos, figures of women, plaster elephants, giant shoes. The people weaving through the streets and shops were eclectic too, every kind of Muggle dress represented from the conservative to the downright bizarre. Harry and Malfoy stood there for a moment, staring, and Harry's skin tingled with a rush that felt familiar. It was like his first day on Diagon Alley, discovering a new world in the midst of dreary normality.
to be a little harsher — but it was curious that Neville was the last hold-out. Since the apologies, everyone else seemed to be embracing the fact that it was, at the very least, quite fun to tease Malfoy.
"Goodnight," said Harry, voice low.
it's bloody Potter," muttered Malfoy, looking back to his book. "It's always bloody Potter.
"Luna! Of course I didn't forget! I mean, I didn't need to remember, he did it, he'd had more practice than me —"
Harry stared at the lips that formed such beautiful impossibilities. It didn't seem real, skirted far too close to the hero-worship he despised.
Harry rolled his eyes at this, but Fish didn't seem to be offended.
, he'd said. Harry wondered whether he meant it — when things had changed.
"I've changed my mind," said Harry, sitting up and catching Malfoy's wrist. Malfoy looked alarmed. There were scarlet patches on his pale cheekbones, and his lips were damp from kissing.
The Dursleys would have
"Potter, after what's happened here tonight, if you take more than three seconds to come inside me I will take it as a personal failing, so you needn't worry about that at least."
lot to
Malfoy stared openly at each colourful shop and eccentric stranger, his eye caught by something ridiculous at every street stall. Harry followed him into the throng, adrenaline humming, giddy with the feeling of exploration — not just of Camden, but of the sight of Draco Malfoy himself, hair falling about his slim shoulders as he ran from curio to curio with all the glittering enthusiasm of Arthur Weasley in a toaster shop.
"Bold of you to assume he doesn't already like to hurt me," said Harry, because he was a bit giddy and because it was supposed to be a dark sort of in-joke, but Malfoy just gaped at him.
"Urgh, Pansy, what are you thinking?" said Malfoy loudly. "Still, better than Potty, I suppose."
Malfoy's hand caught his elbow as he helped Harry up, and he didn't let go until the steps of Grimmauld Place, both of them silently pretending they hadn't noticed.
"Oh?" she said. "So you're no longer planning to join your mother? I visited her at the

the houses," said Hermione primly. Harry, too shocked and alarmed at that last part of the exchange, was still standing dumbly by the door when he realised Hermione was about to open it; he took a sharp step back, out of viewing range of Malfoy but completely obvious to Hermione, should she look right instead of down the stairs. Hermione emerged, shut Malfoy's door, glanced in his direction and then jumped; Harry winced, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
He finished his pint, and Harry watched him gesture for another with dawning horror.
The sun was bright today, the sky a perfect blue, the air pleasantly cool around them. Ginny threw his broom at him, took to the air, and proceeded to thoroughly and brutally prove to him that he would never have made it as a Keeper. After an hour, they swapped roles, which was a little better for Harry, and then she challenged him to upside-down sit ups hanging off their brooms, like Wood had used to make him do. She won, and Harry watched her carry on well past victory, scarlet and sweaty and messy.
"Yeah," said Harry. "I don't know about dad
"That would be lovely," said Malfoy, all manners again, and Luna smiled her wide-eyed smile at him.
"Yeah," he said. "You can tell?"
"Most Muggles have absolutely no idea how a CD player works, let alone wizards," said Dean. "But good luck to you."
"Er," he said. "You. I can't."
"My pleasure," she said, grinning. "Now, I'm going to wrap it in film. You can take it off after a few hours. It's going to be pretty weepy for a bit, and then it might get a bit crusty and itchy, then the top layer of skin will start to flake off and reveal your healed tattoo." Harry glanced at Malfoy, whose slim nose was wrinkling. "It's very important that you don't itch it, that you keep it clean with water and gentle soap, and that you don't pick any flaking bits. If you're worried about it at any point, give the shop a call. Here's a printout of the care instructions because I can tell you're not going to remember all that. Okay?"
Harry would not have turned anyone away, but he was secretly relieved that it was Luna asking. Her presence in the house was quiet, and she took an interest in the drawing room, which despite being one of the more functional and well-lit rooms in the house, still made Harry uneasy. Harry kept largely to fixing the kitchen and bathrooms, the bits he needed.
"Yeah, I dunno, Hermione isn't one to talk about it," he said. "She acts like it isn't a thing, gets obsessed with all the magical injustice instead. I suppose I get it, it's easier to believe it when you're told it's not a thing. Otherwise, as a Muggle-born, it's all — Congratulations, welcome to magical wonderland! Maybe in this society you'll be judged solely by the content of your character? Oh, nope, still an issue, and by the way you now have to deal with the fact that because your parents don't have magic, a group of scary fuckers want to wipe you out of existence. Only I didn't get to feel like I was super special and saving the world when I was running for
"Trust me, that's no good thing," said Draco darkly. "Have the council still not found you a place?"
crackled to life.
It took Harry a few weeks to realise that Hermione was not being entirely honest about her intentions. She might have been trying to find herself, but the place she was looking was inside her parents' heads.
"One word for it," agreed Malfoy flatly, not removing his hand from over his face.
"Dean's a bit late," said Seamus. "Wonder what's keeping him?"
"I'm not an addict," said Malfoy sharply, tugging his arm out of Harry's grip.
The dormitory door opened, and Hermione fired a nose-blocking hex without checking to see who it was.
"I don't think we should try to pick up where we left off," she said, voice clear, and firm, and a little too fast. Harry, much to his surprise, felt his body flood with relief.
address, of course. And then I sat in the park and looked sad at people until enough of them gave me money to buy a packet of cigarettes, but I haven't had one in more than a week so I nearly coughed my guts up and it made me feel somewhat like I was about to die. So I gave them to some homeless — some
"Seems kind of appropriate," said Harry, voice dark. "Judging by the sound of him."
Then Draco snapped back to himself, back to that expression of contempt.
"Go on then, pick a non-House partner! Or I'll start picking myself!"
"It's fine," said Dean, "I can draw and listen."
"Right," he said. "I guess that's pretty much what happened." "In terms of being able to talk about it — yeah, it's close enough."

"Well he said you were living with a dodgy bloke who dealt drugs, but I don't think he knows you were
"Great, see you there," said Seamus, although Malfoy's answer had not strictly been a yes. "Anyway, I can see you're busy, so I'll just — "
"Well, I suppose we will have to have a whole school announcement," she said. "Tell everyone of your predicament, get them to block up their noses."
"Tea," finished Neville eventually, looking between Malfoy and the only available seat at the end of the table with distaste.
Harry threw a look back over his shoulder, amused.
"Is it helping?"
"But is it something
"I wouldn't want to be impolite," said Malfoy, staring determinedly at his bowl.
much."
Harry looked at the floor.
He wished there was some way he could ask for a Pamphlet.
"You're not really hiding anything either," he growled, and pushed the sneer off Draco's lips with lips and tongue and teeth.
"So, what brings you through my Floo?" he said, resting against the kitchen table, unable to believe the ease with which he referred to Grimmauld as
dancing, but it was close enough that Harry could only stare. Malfoy looked happy. And Harry
Dean raised his eyebrows.
"I — I guess I'm really thinking of Max from the Quidditch club here," said Ginny. "He asked me if we could be exclusive. I said I wasn't really looking for anything serious and he kind of… he took it badly. Called me a stupid slut, actually."
"A jolly old time, I'm sure," he said, and Hermione gave him a smile back that was definitely forced.
"I'd love to," said Harry, and Andromeda smiled.
Harry thought about what his younger self would say, at the thought of the way Harry felt about Malfoy now. His stomach burned with mixed embarrassment and longing.
In the new year, Harry used his book on House Magic to put his energy into Grimmauld, although he was running out of things to do, save for exploring the attic, which so far Harry had used only to hide old clutter he didn't have the heart to banish. And, of course, there was clearing Sirius's old room. He hadn't been able to face it yet. Regulus's room had been bad enough, a story of a childhood told in dried up quills, long-perished sweets, letters, notes from classmates and disturbing newspaper cuttings. He'd cleared away the papers and rubbish, put the letters and keepsakes aside, stripped the beds of their Slytherin green and spent an afternoon digging into the room's secrets, all the mundane little objects they'd been too busy to care about when they'd last searched the place.
"Do you think so?" Harry cringed at the tone of his voice.
"B is C flat," said Draco.
"Come on," growled Draco, voice rough, and curled a finger tight in the fabric of his robe. "I'm not afraid. How about you?"
"Absolutely not," insisted Draco, but he tensed against the threat of Harry coming to test that assertion.
Malfoy huffed.
Harry took another deep breath and repressed his inner Molly Weasley. He knew perfectly well how ineffective the clucking and fretting was at making Molly happy or her children compliant; it tended to make at least a few of her children do the
Draco's hands fisted in Harry's robe, and he slammed Harry hard into the wall again. Harry saw stars as his head connected with the stone.
Harry woke up the next morning, emerging from nightmares he couldn't remember. A bleakness fell over him, the kind that usually meant a day in bed without the energy or desire to do anything at all but stare and doze. They happened sometimes, but less than they used to. Harry had become accustomed to it, knew what to do when it happened — he'd accept Kreacher's haphazard but determined care, do what he was told, and wait it out.
Harry's body was hot all over from the barrage of compliments, and it was taking all the energy he had not to crush his lips to Draco's. Draco's eyes were sliding away again, the pale skin of his cheeks flushing. Harry was close enough to see the capillaries blooming across his ice-white skin.
Dean? Would he want to kiss him? It was a weird thought, not
"Are you sure drinking is a good idea?"
"Or if you
?" said Ginny.
"Weird dreams about Doris in ward ten chasing me around the hospital for a kiss," he said. "Dean home yet?"
"Should be close," said Malfoy. "Says Camden Lock is through there."
"Ah, how silly of me, I forgot you were a posh git. See, some of us like to take on small manual tasks. Keeps us down to earth."
His first observation was that it looked suspiciously like the beanbags were breeding, looking bigger, more numerous, and more decorated with blankets and scatter cushions. The sofas, too, were longer and plumper, yet somehow still absolutely the same, recognisable from the embroidery bees still buzzing over the arms. The polished wood floors gleamed, the old rug looked new again and twice the size, and the piano was on its own little dias, elevated. Plants Harry recognised from the garden were here now, Neville's scattered pots multiplying into great bouquets of foliage. Harry hadn't noticed before, but he realised now that Grimmauld had never been using Wizard Space, not in the whole time he'd known it, cramming itself down into the size of what was still an admittedly very spacious terrace. Now, it seemed quite happy to stretch out, settling comfortably into physical impossibility.
"Would you like to join us in the dining room?" said Harry, as though he hadn't heard anything. "There are drinks."
"What about my hair?" said Draco, awkwardly touching his long, soft locks.
"I don't know if I've changed. I walk the line every day between the voice in my head that says that I'm a Malfoy and I am owed the world, and the voice in my head that hates every inch of me. It feels like whatever I do to defeat one lets the other run rampant."
Harry saw guilt and self-loathing etched into Malfoy's frame, shoulders hunched and spiky, face screwed up. It was interesting to see it on him, someone Harry associated with entitlement and petty cruelty; it reminded him of sixth year, of crying in a bathroom.
. Would be, if wizards was more serious about it. Wizards seem to be forgetting the old ways."

"That you're gay?" said Harry.
"Happy New Year," he said, and Draco closed the gap between their mouths again.

"Not at all," Malfoy interrupted, stiff now. "I was just leaving. Please excuse me."
Seamus snorted.
it read.
"Mad," he said. "And disturbing. At least it's nothing you haven't seen, eh?"
Draco blinked, as though he couldn't understand why Harry might feel like that. Then he followed Harry up the steps.
"Right," said Harry, swallowing. "So do you think I should…"
Winter broke at the start of March, and with it some of Harry's low mood. He celebrated the bright, clear days of spring by learning how to repoint, render and paint the front of the house. It looked utterly different by May, clean and bright, the windows washed and glossed. Ginny and Luna helped him decorate, their handiwork evident in the rainbow-painted window-boxes bursting with spring shoots.
Draco," said Pansy, expression softening as she looked back to him. "Write to me, won't you, when you know the result of the hearing?"
"Hand it over, let me have a look," said Dean, stretching out one long arm.
"How do you think?" said Malfoy, smirk wicked. Harry stared.

the fountain.
"I've been thinking about turning Grimmauld into some sort of home," he said. "For war orphans, maybe, or just wizarding kids in trouble. Somewhere they can be safe, and loved. I just… don't really know what I'm doing. I'm not qualified."
As well as the obvious candidates of Harry's current household, they invited George, Dean, Seamus and Hannah Abbot. Ginny, to his surprise, asked to invite Cho Chang.
She stared at the bowl blankly for a second.
Harry felt a vice clamping in his chest. Hermione was right, they weren't in balance, Draco was
Harry threw an arm over him instead, and let his exhausted body pull him into a doze.
"You're kind of the opposite, Malfoy," said Harry. "You've been through all kinds of hell and you're still here."
"Want to apologise for breathing next?" said Dean, voice amused. "It's fine, Malfoy, it's a shared space. Did you want something?"
disgusting."
Another moment of silence.
"And what a pleasure it is to be here," said Harry, equally dry. He crossed his legs and sank down on the cold tiles.
Hermione had also decided not to return, but that was largely because she'd already arranged to take her NEWTs at the Ministry at the end of the month. More surprising was her plan to take a gap year before making any further decisions.

"Or you could show everyone that Gryffindor and Slytherin used to be
He leant forward out of proximity of Malfoy, brushing the soot off her shoulder. She blinked at his hand as it approached.
Harry nodded, miserable.
"Seems you have it pretty sorted already. House, friends, money, freedom, an extremely attractive man in your bed…"
around forever."
Harry didn't know if hope was worse.
"I feel it," he said, and his voice was dry but Draco's mouth snapped shut, eyes a little wide.
"What godforsaken nightmare is an NA meeting?" said Malfoy.
They entered the room. Almost every female head – and a fair few male ones, too – turned his way. The nearest girl's nose twitched –
He just wanted to be free. Whatever that meant.
At Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, George hugged him for a long time, and then dragged him all over the shop to show him every product. A collection of children gathered around them, pointing and making unsubtle conversation about who he was. He didn't mind, not when it was children.
"BOYS!" said Slughorn. "Really, this is not the playground! If you carry on like that I'll be forced to send you out of the classroom!"
Harry took a step towards the back wall, eyes still on Malfoy.
It fell for declining, and so Harry did, with a hastily scrawled note that would have embarrassed Hermione. But the second Luna's owl departed with his refusal, so did another little sliver of the weight on his chest. It was the kind of weight he only noticed when it left. Was that normal?
Underneath, in neat calligraphy, was the word
"Yeah," said Ron, not able to keep the grimace out of his tone. "Although, I had a
"Zabini," said Harry, managing to make it sound normal and not grumpy. "It was nice to see you. Er, feel free to visit again."
"Unlike you, Mr Sexually-Oblivious-Until-He-Gets-A-Tongue-Down-His-Throat, I'm slightly more aware of who I actually fancy," snapped Malfoy. "Don't read too much into it."
Malfoy's hand felt unnaturally cool. Harry started at the point of contact, trying to remember if they'd ever touched before, outside of throwing a punch. It came to him in a rush — Fiendfyre, Draco clinging to him, heat and noise and desperate panic —
Behind him, Ginny's laugh rang bright.
"Well if he
Christmas seemed to arrive with no prior warning. One minute, Harry was trudging to Adhikari's office in the cold November rain, and the next he was dodging men in Santa hats passing out leaflets for Christmas musicals.
"I'll do it," said Harry. "I'm taking a bowl up for Malfoy anyway."
Harry curled a leg over Draco as well. Draco's other hand came up to stroke his thigh.
"That a leaflet about sexual health and a post-it note with a list of Silencing Charms appeared on the coffee table this morning?" said Luna quietly, and Harry paused with his hand on the door handle, grinning. "I suppose it could be, but I think it seems a little unlikely."
"I…" he said. "Yeah, maybe."
Harry's whole body zinged with adrenaline, Draco's hands tangled in his hair, Draco's chest against his. Harry's mind went blissfully blank, thoughts utterly stolen by the euphoria of having Draco finally against him.
"Night, Potter," murmured Malfoy, and Harry slipped into his bedroom and shut the door before any more mad thoughts threatened to escape.
"Harry's got stuff that makes anyone of the right sexual preference jump him," explained Ron. "Dean, I thought you liked girls!"
He lowered his mouth, and Harry had to close his eyes against the vision of Draco Malfoy, all bedroom eyes and sharp cheekbones, closing his lips around Harry's cock.
It was with that thought in his mind that
Seamus and Dean
Harry looked back to the catalogue. He supposed that was something to go on — would Sirius approve? Harry could almost hear him mocking the argyle cardigans, admiring the v-neck shirts, complaining about how few motorbikes were in any of the pictures.
The central staircase, always a focal point of the house, was now even wider and more grand, light streaming all the way down from the roof to the foyer. The handrails, once uncomfortably low and wobbly, now slipped firmly through his hands as he ran down the stairs, keen to see the drawing room.
"I'm going to see if Hermione's up. Meet you in the common room?"
Harry had no love for the Malfoy name, but he still felt the sting of that. It wasn't fair.
"Not at the moment," agreed Seamus, "She's gone out to meet Ron in Diagon."
But then when Harry sighed and walked upstairs, Malfoy followed him into the drawing room as though he had every intention of resuming their musical journey, and Harry felt a flare of something he didn't want to name. Malfoy only froze a little at the sight of Seamus, who'd snuck up behind them to put on Alanis Morissette.
she worries about us?"
Malfoy let out a slightly hysterical laugh.
"Stay," agreed Luna.
Harry laughed. It was busy, and there was at least one absolute stranger behind him, and everything was very loud, but this might actually be, a little bit,
"I wish I hadn't told you," murmured Malfoy, grimacing at the toilet.
Harry shifted to see what he was doing, and almost regretted it at the obscene sight of it, one dripping finger sliding into him. Draco gave him a smirk.
. Feels like I can't win at the moment."
"I told him I will never accept his apology." He grinned. "And that I only let him into the house so I could try my new Auror skills on him."
Fish's grin was hopeful. Harry squirmed, knowing with absolute certainty that he did
And so they slipped back into the warmth of Grimmauld Place, closing the door behind them.
"Oh, hush, Mr
"How do you know about that?" said Harry. Ginny gave him an arch look.
"I'll explain first. It'll be fine. Spells at the ready, yes? Come on."
"Potter," he said. "Are you
"That means you don't know why," muttered Harry, and Draco glared, which was not a denial.
"It helped," said Hermione. "It helped a lot. They remembered me almost all the way through dinner. I think it's sticking, too."
"I thought we were going to wait!" protested Harry.
"I'd like to see it," said Harry, and Draco's smile slipped, a flush crawling up his cheeks.
"What?"
"I have nothing but sisterly feelings towards you, Harry, but I can appreciate that you are a very handsome man with many loveable features." She patted him on the arm again. "Malfoy would be mad not to fall head over heels in love with you."
smile and expecting to see John's wife, or Emily perhaps —
Janine, laughing incongruously all through, told a story about being approached by a stranger for directions, nearly punching him in the face and then spending the rest of the day dissociated until her girlfriend found her on the couch, staring into space and surrounded by empty crisp packets. Harry wanted to tell her about the time he'd had an intrusive memory and spaced out mid-spell, turning a harmless
Then Malfoy dumped a handful of change onto the table, and Harry almost jumped.
"It looks good on you." Malfoy set his arm back down on the table. "A lot of the guys at work have tattoos. One of them said the Mark was
until the Pamphlet."
"It's okay, Hermione, you saved me from a world of embarrassment," he said. "Were they awful?"
"Right, hands over the keyboard. I said don't
"Twenty four hours," said Hermione. "Well, at least we know it wears off. When did you put it on?"
Then Malfoy covered Harry's mouth with his, and Malfoy was definitely affected, and Harry was a bit too shocked to fight back. And Malfoy's tongue was tracing the inside of his mouth and his hips pinned Harry's to the wall and really this was... horrible, but he couldn't get to his wand and it was difficult to think with Malfoy moaning faintly into his mouth and he didn't know how to make it stop...
"You could have at least tried, Hermione, you're a very clever person —"
"Not like it can get much worse," said Malfoy. "Nobody believes that I thought the Dark Lord was a sadistic nutter who never should have been born, they all think I'm mourning and plotting resurrection. But don't change the subject – you had a bit of
"Donaghan Tremlett, on the bass," said Harry, setting down his wrench.
"Well, since I'm your boyfriend now," he said, and Harry's stomach did a flip.
"Harry!"
"I think I like it better this way," he said, and kissed him again.
"No," said Harry, exasperated, "I just like it that way sometimes. God, Malfoy, you are so annoying."
"Is it?" said Dean, tilting his head to look at her curiously.
Harry's first impression was
"What is the counterspell to this nose-blocking charm?"
"Maybe I will," said Malfoy, perching on the edge of the coffee table and sipping his pineapple juice. "I've been wondering if there would be room in the dining room. I could start a mail order service, perhaps."
Harry watched the curve of that smirk and bitterly wished that he could put his mouth over it. He set down his piña colada without tasting it, and slunk off to bed.
"I'll kiss it better," he added, low, and Draco's eyelids dropped. True to his word, Harry kissed a long trail up Draco's forearm, lingering over the skittering pulse at his wrist.
"Whatever," sneered Malfoy, turning his back to light a fire under their cauldron. "You're pathetic, Potter, drooling all over me like a puppy just 'cause I'm the first guy you snogged."
"I… that was
"He was in my year at school," said Harry.
Draco moaned, and bit, and together they writhed in angry, vicious abandon - then Draco was rolling on top again, and Harry was tearing at clothing, and with closed eyes and jerking hips, both of them pushed themselves over the edge. Draco came against him with a cry, and in heated shame Harry followed.
A smile crept over Harry's face despite himself. Draco was too smart, it was obnoxious really, and it shouldn't make him want to kiss Draco's smirking mouth.
Ron raised his eyebrows. There was colour rising on his cheeks, a sign of approaching anger.
"Badly dressed scarhead," said Malfoy, throwing one arm over his eyes.
that help — professional or any other kind — was not a bad thing. That even if he felt completely fine, it wouldn't hurt to ask for it. But some part of him slipped away at the thought, left a void in his chest at the horror of ever seeking help, ever being a burden.
"I didn't know you didn't know yours," said Dean. "Must be weird."
Downstairs, the coat rack had expanded to fit each person's coats. Walburga's portrait was gone, swallowed back into the wall, as though it were never there. The space wasn't obviously bigger, but it
"Yeah, you're right," he said. "But! We can totally use it on Malfoy. He won't be able to move for droves of girls. It'll drive him insane! What's so funny, Dean?"
"Perhaps she shouldn't," said Draco, scowling at a forkful of pastry. Pansy looked startled.
it exactly?"
He remembered the necklace, and touched it gently, breathing deeply as a cool calm washed over him.
But with the weather outside wet and hostile, the quiet days slipped into louder nights. With the fire lit and his closest friends good-naturedly bickering on their beanbags, the drawing room began to feel like a smaller, fancier version of the Gryffindor common room. They listened to the radio, and learned to drink wine mostly because it felt like a shame not to use the drawing room's antique glassware. Some nights they played board games, although Monopoly posed such a threat to house harmony that when Harry spotted Ron putting it in the bin one morning, he kept a careful silence.
"I — I'm going to talk to Ron and Hermione," he said. "Someone needs to go upstairs and make sure Malfoy doesn't dash out into the night with nowhere to go."
Harry found himself thinking about four-poster beds that night, trying to imagine whether tying people up to one would appeal to him. With Ginny — god, no, she'd hate to play the damsel, especially with Harry, and the whole thing felt wrong — would
"Hey, it's me old boarding school chum!" he said, in his terrible rendition of an upper class accent. He slapped Harry rather hard on the back. "You find Dray in the end?"
"Nah. It's only just gone five."
But Harry knew he couldn't say a word, because if Draco thought he was just another Spider… he had to prove he wasn't. He had to be better than that.
"Of course," said Hermione, looking madly curious. "Um, how about now? I left your homework downstairs. If we make a break for it we can probably find an empty classroom."
close ties to Death Eaters?" said Ron, scandalised.

"Snape
"Diagrams don't – I've had a busy childhood – of course I already know most of it –"
He drifted off to the sound of six boys laughing raucously about sex.
Malfoy just stared, lingering in the doorway. Harry laid out a place at the table and gestured pointedly.
"Hermione's
There was a sound a little like the hum of a broken fluorescent bulb as Hermione cast the testing spell.
know about this. Not because he'd disapprove or anything, but because if he ever gets embroiled in an Auror internal investigation — even as a witness — he could be given Veritaserum and spill all sorts of secrets. The interrogator only has to word a question badly and that's it, every illegal thing he's ever witnessed might come out of his mouth. It could ruin his career. There's already a lot of things he's had to disclose to even be considered for the role, I don't think they'll take it lightly if anything else comes out."
"Certainly not me," said Harry, grinning.
Harry quickly looked up at Malfoy. It had suddenly got difficult to breathe.
"I get that," he said. "And you really need to tell her that yourself."
"That I deserve to suffer for it, for the rest of my life," whispered Malfoy eventually. Neville's arm, still preventing Malfoy's escape, slowly dropped.
Hermione raised her eyebrows.
Harry slumped into the sofa opposite her. They stared at each other for a long moment, not quite glaring, but not friendly either. Draco was momentarily oblivious, as he tipped his head back and continued to inform Ginny she was profoundly incorrect about her predictions for the next Tutshill Tornados friendly.
"Half an hour?" said Malfoy faintly. Harry tried to ignore it.
"Granger, I appreciate that given some of the context nobody is going to believe me on this, but I'm not
but the running commentary is always there, ready to fall out of my mouth. Spider used to think it was funny, but it's not. I know now that what I think is just so, so wrong, and I try to think and speak differently, but I keep doing it, I'm doing it now, telling you every stupid thought that runs through my head like an
Suitably distracted, Neville looked at her a little blankly and sat down. Harry levitated a bowl in his direction, and Ron gave the casserole dish a shove.
"You look like you could do with breakfast," said Harry.
Dean snorted.
. You don't fight anymore. You talk like you're some kind of mess, but you don't look like someone fucked up and broken, you look like someone who always knows exactly what to do. You always have, and it's so infuriating it makes me want to punch your stupid face."
"I don't believe you," Harry explained. At least, he was
"It may not surprise you, given how well the job at Blackwoods went, but I've given up on gainful employment in the wizarding world and have been attempting to acquire a Muggle job," confessed Draco, sounding painfully polite.
"Don't touch me, Potter," he snapped, yanking his hand away and then shoving him backwards. Harry shoved back on pure instinct, and Draco snarled and threw himself at Harry. They went clattering to the floor again and Harry's glasses flew, and this time Draco was out to
article about his abused childhood gave Harry a panic attack that shook the books off all the bookshelves. They'd used it once more when Seamus rather enthusiastically described a part of his horror novel where the ghost possessed the girl and forced her to murder her brother, which sent Ginny off to the bathroom to be unexpectedly sick.
"It just sort of happened, you know?" Neville continued. "I'd never want to make anything awkward, I don't think it's on to just kiss people's ex-girlfriends in front of them like that, but I didn't think right away and it sort of seemed rude to, I dunno, push her off…"
" hissed Harry. "I'm just trying to be
"Shit," said Harry, "Are you the grown up one now?"
Ron grimaced.
to Harry. He mentally shelved that for later exploration, when his blood wasn't roaring in his ears, and clumsily obeyed the command, unhappy that it meant standing up away from Draco.
Harry stroked Sirius's signature; to his surprise, it vanished in a flare of sparks. He dropped the paper in surprise.
"Harry! You scared me —"
Harry looked at her again, scouring her face for an idea of her opinion, but she simply looked serious.
Maybe just the one Malfoy...
When they finally pulled away, both their lips were bruised and bloody.
with him," said Seamus. "Bit of an innocent, our Harry."
"I called in some favours," said Fish, "And I got my mate to let us kip on his floor. I had nothing better to do than sit with him while he gets himself together. But my mate's in sheltered housing and he can't get caught with guests, and in any case he's right pissed off with both of us after a few days, so he kicks us out. So I point Dray in the direction of the soup run and a couple of charities what aren't too much trouble, and I was gonna hang out and look after him a bit longer but he got a bee in his bonnet about me drinking too much, we got into a barney, and I haven't seen him since."
Harry stared, blank with shock.
Harry wondered why Malfoy was here with them — whether he'd decided there was something in what Blaise had said, about making friends with them for the social clout. Still, they were playing now, and Malfoy didn't appear to cheat, and slowly their renditions of Go Fish became more smug or spiteful, and it was almost fun by the time Seamus's victory dance was interrupted by the sound of the others downstairs.
"Fuck, that would be… good," he said, nails digging into Harry's buttocks. "But I think it should be me, this time."
"Potter," said Malfoy, after he'd finished the pancakes and started on a fresh, hot coffee. Harry sipped his own from his perch by the sink, looking at Malfoy over the rim of his mug. "I hope you're not expecting me to turn into one of your fawning sycophants just because you're feeding me breakfast and letting me sleep here. I accepted this offer because it's marginally better than sleeping on the streets but I'm not here to stroke your ego like some sort of — feelings prostitute."
"It's fine," said Dean, amused.
As was Harry's inability to stop thinking about it.
"I felt like shit after the beating he gave me," Malfoy continued. "But Spider settled me down on the sofa and gave me some tea and paracetamol and for a few days I just lay there, feeling kind of sick and kind of spaced out, but okay. Nothing was really
"On an unrelated subject, do you think we could talk somewhere later?" whispered Harry, pulling her closer.
"Don't, Potter, I can't bear the pity.” Malfoy pulled himself up straighter, voice turning clipped. "Afterwards, when he finally seemed to realise what he was doing and stopped, I knew that I had to leave. I may have hated myself, but I didn't want to
Harry sighed, setting down his dishcloth, which Kreacher immediately snatched away.
"Right," said Harry, before she could start. "I'll just… go shower and get dressed then."
Harry trained a suspicious gaze on her face, but Ginny merely smiled, twirled, and followed Luna into the floo.
Then the Floo spat flames into the room, lighting Draco's eyes as bright as Harry's for a moment.
Harry paused, his coffee halfway to his mouth, looking at Neville with his head tilted inquiringly.
keep making him lose it.
Harry considered. Then he looked up at Malfoy with a slow grin.
Harry growled and pushed Draco back against the opposite wall. Draco grabbed fistfuls of Harry's robe again, trying to force him away, but Harry resisted, pinning Draco down.
"It was good," he said, voice casual. "But I think I'm better off one-on-one."
"You do look a bit off," said Hermione. "Are you sure?"
"Well," said Harry. "Technically, but I want you to feel like you're at home. And this isn't, um, an ordinary circumstance. Or, well… it's not an ordinary person."
"And that's my cue," he said. "See you later, try not to have too much fun without me."
things, Hermione."
"Queen Elizabeth the Second," deadpanned Ron.
Then he was pressing in,
"Ah," he said. "Not here out of the goodness of your heart, I see."
"I think," said Harry, smiling faintly at Ginny's wave, "I need to sleep on it."
"What about choosing happiness?" said Seamus. Harry made a rude gesture at him.
"Wouldn't be the first offer of a
"Maybe not then," said Harry, smiling again, and Neville's returning smile was warm and genuine for a moment until whatever it was that was making him awkward resurfaced.
Draco rolled his eyes.
"Oh," said Luna, "I thought it was going to be much more serious. You've never asked before."
"Nothing that happened to you was your
"I think I'm done," said Harry, a long moment later, looking at his neat list of items and catalogue numbers.
"Why the hell did it take him so long, then?" said Ron.
"Come to apologise for being a terrible boyfriend? You might just be too late."
"I know you've probably never treated my sister with anything but the utmost honour," he said. "We've got potions first, by the way. Looking forward to Slughorn finding out you're
"Come on," said Harry, reaching forward and pulling him by the arm, hoping action would smooth over what words could not. "I want to see what's in the next shop."
Neville, Ginny, and Hermione worked on the decorations in the drawing room, and Dean, Seamus and Luna tackled the dining room. Each of them popped down to the kitchen every now and then to steal a sandwich or a cup of tea. Each of them was suspiciously covered in glitter.
Adhikari took the role very seriously, that much was evident. Something loosened in Harry's chest.
"And I don't feel attraction to people unless I already love them. A bit."
"Anyway. Malfoy said he'd speak to the rest of you tomorrow and then fled, so that's enough of that. Pizza?"
"Yep," said Harry. "I don't think he's keen to outstay his welcome."
Harry wasn't even sure what he believed now. What he'd seen at the Other King's Cross, with Dumbledore, when he died — was it even real? Were the people he'd seen in the Stone even real?
They were very early, which meant that they got good seats, but Slughorn ruined that with the first words out of his mouth as he entered.
"Everyone misses you," said Harry.
"Honestly," Draco enthused, wide awake now. "I'm on good terms with the chair of trustees for the War Orphans' Fund, I could introduce you, she'd know exactly what we need the most. And of course you have John to consult, did you know he's on the board of half the homeless charities in the area, not just the soup run? Maybe even your Mind Healer will know people, isn't she a trauma specialist?"
"Nah. Apart from Dean," said Ron.
Harry tried not to let his returning grin slip. He
Harry withdrew them, wiping his face with his other hand. Draco looked up at him, dazed.
"Feel like shit?" he asked Malfoy.
Blaise snorted.
He drew back, sneering, and swept past their audience with his mother close behind. The Aurors did not stop him - one of them laid a hand on Harry's shoulder. Harry shrugged it off, pushing through the crowds, and buried he memory of that hot, tense flare under the crushing weight of his fury.
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
"Yes," said Neville, giving him a strange look. "Well, no, actually, it feels like I've taken a Whomping Willow to the head and apparently none of you hardened drinkers know what a hangover potion looks like. But other than that."
Draco's smile had a flash of bared teeth.
Dean chuckled, then Seamus; the tension around the table broke.
"First time?" said Janine, grabbing another brownie and giving him a long look. "Don't mind Elsie, she's just shy. We don't bite, unless you ask nicely, eh Amit?"
"It is sarcasm, Potter, because
"Quick thinking," said Harry, impressed.
"You scare me a bit," he said eventually, and he wasn't joking, but he cuddled closer to her anyway, resting his head on her shoulder. "Did it work?"
"No. We were more enemies, actually. Not now though. He did me a favour, kind of saved my life a few years ago, and I want to repay him."
"Wizards take Muggle drugs sometimes," said Ron. "Maybe he's an addict now."
"Hermione's getting less subtle," said Harry dryly. Ron followed Harry's eyeline to the coffee table and winced.
Harry wanted to laugh. Watching Hermione, he had the pleasure of witnessing her silent hostility collapse into confusion as she watched this exchange. Apparently, it hadn't occurred to her that Pansy might be funny, let alone flirtatious. Certainly not flirtatious with
is why I was
Andromeda set the toy broomstick box down beside her chair. "Thank you, Harry," she said, looking at him sincerely. "I know it will bring him joy."
They made it through The Wall, and then Harry put on the well-worn single of Paint it Black, which Malfoy insisted he play three times. And then because Harry was running out of sad music, he put on The Kinks, mostly to see Malfoy's eyebrows raise at the lyrics to Lola. He could tell Malfoy was getting bored halfway through the album, however, and was flicking through the collection trying to decide if it were worth putting on more singles and having to get up every three songs, to play one of the albums he usually saved for happier company, or to risk breaking the fragile mood by suggesting they do something else.
"Um," said Harry, "Sorry, I don't know."
He couldn't speak for a moment. He just followed.
Harry was silent, staring up at the heavy clouds.
They walked in brisk silence to the nearest classroom, which was dusty and a little chilly due to a broken window pane. Harry wondered when it had last been used to teach.
"This time," muttered Ron. Harry pretended not to hear.
, but great. You know you could always apply next year?"
"So what are the black ones?" said Harry, making the mistake of looking at Draco. His face was very close.
"Potter, how dreadful to see you," she greeted, waving a manicured hand and then, to his surprise, leaning in to air-kiss a spot near his left cheek. "I see you've become even more ruggedly attractive, how terribly annoying. You'll excuse the
"There are many ways to care for a master," said Kreacher huffily, and Harry looked down at him, touched. "I is not thinking
"That's funny," said Seamus with an air of casual mischief, "I'm pretty sure the Ballycastle Bats beat Worsley a few times."
Harry came down on Saturday to find Hermione and Malfoy huddled in one corner of the drawing room, talking low and fast. The floor around them was scattered with papers and books; Harry had to duck as Hermione Summoned another from her room without looking.
He lifted up his right arm.
homeless chap, and then traipsed about Regent's Park in a sulk until I couldn't put off coming back here any longer."
Potter's weird sex cult?" asked Malfoy. "I must say I wondered."
"Why Go Fish?" said Harry, grinning. Seamus shrugged.
Harry realised abruptly why Draco seemed so good at facing all the things that terrified Harry, why he could sleep on the streets, move in with strangers. Harry might have a fear of leaving home — of the darkness beyond his front door — but it seemed as though Draco could tolerate being anywhere
Harry curled under the covers and tried to let his tiredness take him away, to let the reassuring presence of Ron and Hermione make him feel safe again. He dozed a little, waking from nightmares of Draco running away from him, the lick of Fiendfyre at his back. Ron or Hermione would pat him in their sleep, and his eyes would close again, only for the nightmare to begin anew.
"Er, yeah," said Harry, "Sorry, I probably should have —"
"Fuck," he said, pulling back to look at it. It was long and terrifying, faint now but still visible, a very visual reminder of how much they hated one another.
"We will, Professor."
"Cool," she said. "We don't take walk-ins. Would you like to book?"
"If you like that one," said Seamus, doing a little arm-roll as he dance-walked to the sofa, "You're gonna love the next track."
"What happened next?" he asked, swallowing his discomfort.
Sharing in the communal hangover in the drawing room the next morning, Harry had pretty much forgotten about shopping for new clothes until Dean returned from his mission to buy milk.
"You're a prat, Harry Potter," said Ginny eventually, and the insult felt inexplicably grounding, inexplicably normal.
he?" said Ron. "He goes all weird when it comes to Malfoy. Remember how many times we caught him staring at the map? I mean, half the time Malfoy was just pacing his common room. What was he looking for? Waiting for Malfoy to write 'I'm a Death Eater' in tiny footprints?"
He could

bed! Landlord said if I wasn't happy he would just rent it out to a goblin!"
"Yeah," he said, sitting down. "Yeah, sorry. We're not a hostel. It was a stupid idea."
"You made it, Harry, help yourself." John gave him a paternal smile, gesturing with the plastic cup in his own hand. Harry looked around to the man in the van, smiling what he hoped was his most charming
"Honestly, Draco," said Pansy, voice cutting through his guilty thoughts like a dagger. "Can we talk about something
Serving at the soup run was another whirlwind adventure in talking to people, his throat scratchy by the end of an hour. He stood beside Hermione this time, at the side of the van, passing out bread rolls and trying to look friendly and approachable.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, rather over-dramatically in Harry's opinion.
Seamus, groaning, got up from the table, kissing Dean on the side of the forehead as he did so.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. He thought he should probably be more upset, but it scored well below 'attempted love potion' and even below 'Rita Skeeter smear campaign' in the list of horrific personal violations his fame had brought him.
When they got to the coat-hooks, Harry pulled Sirius's leather jacket out from under his dirty parka. He shrugged it on, and Malfoy's eyes went wide again, but Harry was too anxious to think about what it meant. He looked at the front door, took a deep breath, and let adrenaline push him out into the street.
"Missed you too," he said, roughly. Then they both glanced at Ron, in unison; he was smiling, a gentle, sad smile that turned wry when he caught them looking.
"So we're actually going to do it?" said Ginny. "Operation save the little ferret from himself?"
and here there was a large gap, with a hasty scrawl in the centre. It said

"Nope," said Malfoy. "Very sure. Give it here. Hermione Granger never fucks up, even I know this. Besides, what have I got to lose?"
could," said Seamus, grinning at Harry.
— he knew, at least, that he wasn't white, even though he wasn't quite sure what else that made him. People had asked him where he was from and didn't believe him when he said Surrey. People looked curiously at him when he was out with the Dursleys. And there were memories of primary school insults, with definitions that hadn't made any sense to him, because he wasn't from Pakistan and he wasn't entirely sure why it would be bad if he was. He hadn't really known how he should feel about the words as a child, but he knew they were
Seamus snorted.
with them until they didn't know which way was up, and when it looked like they might leave he
The conversation broke as the wine was poured. Harry took his glass gratefully, pulling himself up from his position curled on the sofa.
"I know Blaise Zabini can't have anything to do with him any more," said Hermione. Harry and Ron both raised their eyebrows at her.
"What?" said Hermione. "You're not actually worried about him bringing people home? There are rules at the soup run, and supervision, he won't be allowed to get over-involved. I think it would suit him."
Harry made a face of disgust.
"From the flash or custom? Whereabouts? How big?" said the girl, looking impatient but amused.
any more. So leave me the fuck alone."
"You can't let Malfoy back in the school, Headmistress!"
"Voldemort's my arch enemy," Harry corrected, amused. To Harry's surprise, Malfoy didn't flinch, although he wasn't sure that was actually a good thing.
