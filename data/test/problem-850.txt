Harry slid his hands around Draco's waist, pulling him close into his body and caressing him tenderly. Sucking and biting his lower lip, heads tilting side to side as Draco ran one hand up the side of Harry's cheek and held him close, both of them moaning softly and aching for one another
Harry kissed his neck gently and caressed his body with both hands. He wanted to give Draco a moment of gentle touch before he slammed into him. He positioned himself behind Draco, lining his cock up against his arse that was slick with lube
Everyone looked up to them as they effortlessly oozed style and sass. The girls and guys crushed on all of them, Pansy noticed a group of Ravenclaw girls ogling at her in admiration while the boys did their usual wolf-whistling and winks, though she kept her gaze forward, totally unbothered
Draco scrambled from his position and stood from the bed gradually laying down across Harry's thighs who was already sitting on the edge. He felt awkward laying across him at first, his long legs hanging beside him
"Oh what's wrong slut?" Harry teased, he licked his finger then circled it around Draco's hole "You don't like being spanked?"
"Of course. And this time we'll take it nice and slow and afterwards I'll give you whatever you need. It's important to me to make you feel comfortable"
"Good" Harry spat, tugging again on his leash jerking Draco's eyes away from the floor "Maybe I'll cum on the floor and make you lick it up"
They reached the changing rooms just as the other boys were leaving with their kit bags slung over their shoulders and hair still damp
"And I know you're struggling to adjust to the fact that this is happening, believe me, I still have to pinch myself when I remember it's you too" Harry joked, trying to crack a smile out of Draco, who's eyes were still at his feet "We're both new to this, and pushing new boundaries and learning.. trusting one another.. and you're doing amazing"
"I just want to stay here for a while" Draco whispered, barely audible. He felt so small. So worthless
"Impressive" Harry smiled as he looked down at Draco's throbbing cock. He turned back around and swiped the towel from beside him, walking off casually into the changing rooms, pleased with himself
Pansy was in total shock, her jaw dropped to the floor and hands on her cheeks watching Harry and Draco suddenly making out in front of, well, everyone. Ron was also staring in awe at both of them feeling half responsible for getting Harry to actually do something. Hermione clasped her hand across her mouth while Blaise was grinning ear to ear, stilling dancing to the music and secretly thrilled that Draco was with Harry and no one else. He'd been rooting for them both since the day he found out.
Draco couldn't navigate how he was feeling. Years of loathing toward the Gryffindor made him want to punch him, yet he felt comforted by him too. He hated how shy he'd become now even though he wanted to kiss and touch and taste him.
Draco nodded against Harry's head then pulled back breathlessly "As long as we keep this just between the two of us?"
"Was that you getting rude again, Slut?" Harry mocked, poking his tongue out revelling in the joy of teasing Draco. Draco dragged his finger through the cream on his cheek and sucked it off seductively
"I'm not using you-look, if you want to leave, Malfoy then leave. I'm not going to force you into anything... unless you want me to" Harry said plainly
Maybe he could make Draco jealous? But no, he didn't want that. He never wanted to hurt him. After everything they had done together; sharing their deepest desires, trusting one another completely, longing to make each other feel passion like never before, he couldn't see himself with anybody other than Draco Malfoy.
Draco moaned through his nose, feeling Harry totally fill him. It was a lot to take, he was rather gifted and Draco felt himself overcome with heat as Harry slammed continuously into the back of his throat
"My mistake" Draco hissed, shoving his glass back down onto the table ready to walk away but Harry's frustration bit back as he grabbed Draco's wrist and pulled him close
Harry stroked his cock harder, pumping fiercely watching Draco moan underneath him. He looked fucking gorgeous. He was dirty and degraded and Harry was enjoying every sweet moment of his humiliation, having the superior Slytherin on his knees for him, drenched in his own cum
Draco moaned out loud, dropping his head back in pleasure as Harry pressed his body against his. Harry's hot, wet tongue was licking down his jawline until their lips met. He pressed into the kiss, moaning through each breath. Harry brought his hands up to Draco's face an held him there as their tongues danced in a perfect rhythm
"What the bloody hell are you two doing here?!" Ron erupted, pointing across at Fred and George who emerged from the crowded floor, bouncing with excitement and high-fiving fellow students
Harry's mind was a complete mess. Every emotion drowning him, as though he couldn't breath. He watched as Draco disappeared out of sight and exhaled, a long ragged breath that he'd been holding everything together with. He had gone. He had walked away and the pain that consumed Harry in that moment was not that it was over, but how easily he could've held on
Harry tried his best to mellow into the atmosphere but was still feeling apprehensive. He didn't want an ugly confrontation or any further heartache, especially around so many people. He took a further sip from the glass and bared his teeth at the bitterness that came. How did people enjoy drinking this?
Draco pulled his wand from his back pocket and sharply pressed it into Harry's neck. Harry flinched and held his breath seeing Draco's darkness emerging
Harry's focus flew back to Hermione, who was sat opposite him on the couch of the Gryffindor common room. Harry was below sitting with his legs kicked out on the floor, his back against the fire place feeling the warmth spread over his body
Harry positioned himself over Draco's hole, one arm pushing Draco's thigh against his chest, keeping him balanced. He lubricated his cock and stroked himself before aiming for his hole and pushing against the entrance
Their tongues met instantly, sucking and biting and lost in one another. Their bodies pressed together as though they were melting into one, arms wrapped around one another in a gorgeous embrace. Harry could feel the heat radiating from Draco's skin as he held him close and the instant hardness that had grown in his trousers too. He slid his hand along the back of Draco's neck and pulled him even tighter while their lips remained locked together
"Oh oh right, yeah the match..." Harry stuttered, his eyes flicking occasionally across to the blonde
The music thrummed straight through his body feeling his bones vibrating but all he could focus on was Draco in front of him, everything else became invisible
"Not to brag or anything.. but we looking fucking hot" Pansy said, examining herself and the boys through the full length mirror in her bedroom. She readjusted the thin strap on her lace mini dress that she'd paired with knee high black combat boots. The music from the other side of the door was thumping through the walls as the party was already in full swing and as per usual, they were fashionably late.
Harry stuttered, unsure on what to say next. Their eyes were locked together in the icy silence "I just meant.. it was good.."
"You fucker!!" Harry yelled across the courtyard as Malfoy appeared around the walkway with his friends an hour later.
"You're my gorgeous slut, aren't you" Harry spoke softly, sliding the leather around Draco's neck and fastening it just tight enough. Draco stifled his moans as he felt pleasure pulsating to his cock, he adored being helplessly degraded, and at the hands of someone like Harry made it even dirtier
He dreamt about the way Harry touched him so tenderly despite dominating him with pure filth. The way he held him close after degrading him to nothing. The way he looked so deeply into his eyes after every forceful kiss
Harry lay in the sand for several moments before rolling onto his back, looking up at the chasers flying way above him. His vision was a little foggy, but coming back into focus. He sat himself up on his elbows, his face red, boiling with anger
"Yes, Master" Draco swallowed his humiliation at being dominated by him, Harry was gracing his hands over his thighs with a wicked smile
Draco stood by the door timidly, holding onto the strap of his school bag. He was unsure where to begin
They were twisting and turning and throwing their arms around, not a care in the world for how they looked, it was so dark now they could barely been seen anyway. Draco took Pansy's hand and spun her around with excitement, smiling from ear to ear between shouting the song lyrics terribly before turning to the blonde Hufflepuff boy and doing the same. Everyone was feeling so alive and buzzing with the energy of finally taking a break from school, elated by the freedom.
Draco froze dropping his mouth open in surprise feeling the cold cream touch his skin. He glared at Harry who was grinning to himself, holding back laughter "You little bitch"
"You've been so bad!" Harry growled, thrusting his cock against the back of Draco's thighs, one hand grabbing Draco's hip anchoring him, the other doing the spanking
Harry stopped touching himself and grabbed his wand, casting a spell in front of Draco where his hands became locked in a spread-bar that sat behind his head. Draco's arms we're forced up and there was nothing he could do. His cock stiffened at being rendered helpless and a desperate moan escaped him as he looked up at Harry
Draco swallowed, his heart sinking in his chest. He'd never felt so vulnerable in his life, putting himself out there so freely in front of the one person he never wanted to show weakness in front of. The mask of pain was naturally replaced by his usual bitterness "This just feels too complicated right now... I thought you actually cared"
They headed down the corridor where Harry found an empty classroom, they entered, closing the door behind them where Harry pushed himself up on the desk, swinging his feet below and  looking across to Draco as he waited for him to speak
A smugness fell over Harry's face, as he pulled back meeting Draco's eyes "That's what I thought". Harry stepped away and spoke out loud for the rest of the group to hear him "I think someone needs to teach you how to show some respect, Malfoy" he smirked
Draco watched in total pleasure seeing Harry's orgasm come crashing over him. His back striped in cum as he hung his head between his arms.
Harry moved further into the bed and rested his back against the headboard, his legs kicked out in front of him while Draco laid at his side curled up facing the other way. He stroked his fingers through Draco's hair, caressing him sweetly
Draco parted from Blaise, climbing onto the bed resting his back against the headboard. Blaise joined him, sitting down on the sheets with his legs kicked out to one side, resting on his palms. He pulled out a bag of chocolate mints from his bag below him on the floor and offered one to Draco who declined. It was merely seconds later when Pansy knocked and entered, stepping into the room with her usual air of confidence
Draco nodded against the wall, his mind racing knowing he'd never done this properly before. It was new and exhilarating and terrifying but he craved every part of it. He needed to please his Master, it was his job.
Hermione yanked Harry by his arm over to the drinks table and they huddled together tight enough to keep their conversation private, even though the loud music did that for them anyway
"Open your mouth, Slut. Your holes might have some use to me" Harry ordered, his tone remained cold. He unbuttoned his trousers and slid them down, placing one hand under the waistband of his underwear and pulling out his already throbbing erection
"Oops did I make you hard?" Harry teased, looking down at Draco's throbbing cock "Looks like you're the weak one here, Malfoy"
"Pans!" Blaise called, knocking on her bedroom door as they passed it, they didn't need to wait, they knew she would come to find them. They walked into Blaise's room, a simple space which consisted of a large neatly made bed, a black dresser, a desk piled with textbooks, a freestanding silver mirror and long velvet blue curtains that clung to the misted glass windows.
Their eyes locked together, his throat tightened, butterflies in his stomach, his heart beating rapidly.
Draco looked up at him with an expression of pure hopelessness. Harry could do whatever he wanted to him, and he loved it. His eyes were wide and dilated with lust, his lips parting desperate to touch Harry "Please-"
"Here" Ron handed him a glass filled with the mysterious glimmering liquid. Harry didn't even question it before he snatched it from Ron's grasp and necked the entire thing, gasping and wiping his mouth on his wrist "Bloody hell! Feeling better?"
What surprised Draco the most was how his chest fluttered at the closeness, and suddenly his cock was twitching, he felt weak and vulnerable as Harry's face graced his cheek. His body was almost touching Draco's, Harry's cock so close to his own aching erection
Harry, Ron, Dean and Seamus were lost in the crowds, dancing poorly to the music that was thumping through the air, singing so loud they could barely hear themselves, continuously bumping into others in the darkness and spilling their drinks with little care whatsoever
Seamus and Dean were necking shots and climbing the furniture, Fred and George were engaging in some suspicious transactions in the corner with a handful of innocent sixth year students. Luna was freely wandering through the party offering tonic for people's drink while Neville followed close behind nervously trying to discourage people from actually taking it
"Oohh!! And Potter's lost control of his broom! Crashing down into the sand below! Looks like Gryffindor are going to be out of the points in this game after all! What a loss!" Lee Jordan's excited voice bellowed across the quidditch pitch amongst the cheers and boos of spectating students
"Ohh look at you" Harry stroked the hair out of Draco's eyes as the blonde squirmed beneath him "so pretty when you're begging"
Harry slid his fingers slowly away from Draco's mouth. Draco groaned feeling his saliva drip down his own chin while Harry continued to stroke his penis from behind. Harry brought his other hand back, still wet from Draco's tongue and groped his arse hard, smacking him over and over again
"What about... that guy?" Pansy discreetly pointed to a Ravenclaw boy sitting on the bench opposite them in the great hall
"Wha- you mean... Lily Carlson? That girl?" Draco panicked slightly, despite knowing he was totally innocent
Harry pulled Draco in closer, the two of them were holding each other, Draco's head resting on Harry's chest with his arm hugging him close, his mind filled with a million more questions that ate away at him. Harry could feel the soft breaths on his skin while Draco felt Harry's heart beating softly in his ear. Harry pulled the covers over them as they snuggled together under the warmth, he kissed Draco on the head gently and closed his eyes
"Are you climaxing without my permission, Slut?" Harry asked, but Draco was already gone, lost in the intense pleasure
Harry grabbed Draco's knees and brought them up to his chest, his arse was totally exposed for Harry as he lay on his back, trembling with arousal
Draco did as he was told, he began unbuttoning his shirt, exposing his milky white chest and the muscles that flexed underneath as he moved. He tossed it aside and stepped out of his trousers, lowering himself slowly to the floor and looking up at Harry feeling his cock twitching tight in his underwear. He got to his knees, thankful to be resting on the woollen rug to soften the ground.
"You might want to watch your tone with me, Draco. You know I hold all the power here" Harry climbed onto the bed next to him
He turned to see Draco standing there. It didn't help that the warmth of the sunset from across the grounds was reflecting off his soft features in a way that made him almost glow
"But that would be far too easy, wouldn't it?" Harry cocked his eyebrow, revelling in Draco's desperation
He felt Harrys arms slide around him, caressing his chest and slowly moving down his abdomen, teasing him. Draco was hot with anticipation and feeling Harry so close behind him was driving him wild. He dropped his head back where his neck met Harry's lips, being kissed and sucked gently. He raised one hand and slid his fingers through Harry's hair behind him, holding him close
"Because it would never work" Harry objected. His heart was ripping seeing Draco's hopes falling apart in front of his very eyes "We're just not meant to be... I don't want a commitment... I just wanted... sex"
"No touching" Harry snapped as Draco reached underneath himself. He groaned in frustration, his cock was throbbing and leaking onto the floor below
"I get it" Blaise empathised "You're Draco Malfoy. You're confident, charismatic, stylish... everyone knows your reputation. And it's fine if you want to show that side of you to the world but we're your best friends Draco... and we know you're only human"
"Look..." Harry stuttered "I know I'm probably.. well definitely, the last person you want to speak to right now but honestly... I miss you"
Draco squeezed her hand a little tighter "so you guys aren't freaked out by the fact that I'm falling for.. Potter? Like the actual Harry Potter?"
"Draco.." Pansy shuffled forward, stroking her hand across his arm as a way to comfort him, she hated seeing him so miserable "What did he do?"
Draco shook his head. Pansy joined Draco in staring at his occupied fingers while Blaise spoke on behalf of both of them, asking the questions she had too
"Draco-" Harry grabbed his wrist again. Draco bit his tongue to stop from snapping "I won't do this with you if you're going to shut me out" Harry was serious. He looked almost sad. Draco took a moment to consider and shrugged him off, making his way back across to the bed
"Was that a noise, Slut?" Harry spanked his arse hard. He was positioned behind him, pressing his own throbbing cock against Draco's backside. He reached around and slid two fingers sideways across Draco's mouth, gagging him. Draco bit down onto Harry's fingers desperate to suppress the moans escaping him but was falling apart beneath him.
"I'm kidding!" Harry broke into a grin. He pushed himself off the wall and walked over to Draco, who had furrowed his brow in annoyance "Well, actually I do still want that as well but really I wanted to make sure you we're doing okay"
He finally relaxed into the sheets, dropping his legs back down, breathless and filled with ecstasy. He closed his eyes for a moment to gather himself, then reopened them with a smile, he looked almost drunk with happiness. Harry began grinning back, admiring the sparkle in Draco's silver eyes that were so filled with lust
He admired how grand it felt to be standing in the space that Draco had spent his youth growing up in. He could understand now why he took so much pride in his house and what it stood for, everything around him screamed 'Draco'. The room was stylish and extravagant, flaunting expensive treasures and oozing charm and he imagined this is what the inside of Draco's mind looked like. As well as daddy issues and handcuffs.
Pansy stifled a laugh and began to recite previous statements spoken by the blonde "Potter is so smug when he's playing quidditch" "Potter is so annoying always getting the answers right in class" "Potter looks so stupid when he's studying" "Potter this, Potter that... Draco... who are you kidding?"
Harry pushed his groin harder between Draco's legs, he stroked his stinging arse cheek once more and slid his fingers down between his legs, teasing his balls and touching his cock
His heart was so full feeling Harry loving his body once more. He'd lost all sense of being, knowing only pure pleasure and bliss
Draco dropped his head back, closing his eyes and biting down on his lower lip filled with uncontrollable arousal "I belong with you"
Harry closed his eyes and tried to distract himself but Malfoy's words were ringing in his ears. He wasn't weak, not in the slightest. Maybe he wasn't as bold and brazen as him but he certainly wasn't weak. He felt himself growing more irritated as the thoughts ran through his mind
Harry felt a wave of sickening jealousy and took another swig from the glass, by now he was eight drinks in and feeling it, a terrible mixture of tipsy, horny and emotional. His confidence had grown but the sense of logical thinking had vanished and after everything that had happened he was more desperate for Draco now than ever
"Absolutely not. Whatever is said and done during our sessions is between us, and doesn't reflect who you are on the outside. I know that" Harry reassured
Harry kissed him hard on the lips, and Draco to his own surprise, melted into it. Harry moaned  and released the grip on Draco's wrists, bringing his hand to his neck and holding him there
Pansy brushed her black hair behind her ears and smirked "So that's where you've been disappearing to during the nights"
"You act so high and mighty thinking you're the Chosen One, it's pathetic! You want everyone down on their knees worshiping you-"
"Incarcerous" Harry whispered, sending black rope around Draco's wrists. Draco bit his lip in pleasure and moaned out loud, unable to stifle the arousal at being helpless.
"It's looking good! There's a few more things to iron out but looks like we may partner up with Zonko's Joke Shop. Freddie and I have been inventing a tonne of new products all year and we have so many ideas still!" George explained
Draco finally collapsed onto the bed, his heart felt as though it would rip through his chest it was beating so hard. A blanket of satisfaction drifted over his entire body, leaving him moaning softly into the sheets
Ron laughed at that scenario in his head "Or... he'll get drunk and remember his true feelings and stumble over to you from across the room, declare his love for you again and snog your face off"
Thank you everyone who sticks around for this story and leaves lovely comments - you guys are the best x
"You're just a fuck toy for me" Harry whispered, letting his cock slide between Draco's legs, touching his arse and balls "A filthy little cum-rag to toss aside when I'm done with you"
The shower rooms were often packed after a match, with the houses sticking together in their teams. Until now, he'd never been alone with anyone before, let alone Malfoy, and he couldn't take his eyes off him
He vanished the cuffs from Draco's wrists and helped him crawl back up. Both of them slowly got back into their clothes as the heat began dying down and the cooler night air nipped at their skin. Harry rested back against the headboard, running his hand through his hair while Draco sat casually in front of him, undoing the tie from around his neck and running the soft material through his fingers
The memories with Harry we're the happiest he'd ever felt. He couldn't bring himself to let them go, despite feeling overwhelmed with hurt. He pressed his lips together, stifling any words that were coming, resigning himself to the fact that nothing could be said now to fix this. Instead, he exhaled slowly and kept himself together, looking painfully into Harry's desperate eyes one last time before walking away in to the crowd.
"Barely" Malfoy laughed "You don't have that fight in you anymore and its pathetic. Face it, Potter. You're weak, you have no backbone"
Harry held the belt in his hands after sliding it from Draco's trousers "Mm... I might use this on you later" he smirked, looking up at Draco with a wicked smile. Draco moaned harder and dropped his head against the wall in arousal. He'd always dreamt of being whipped with a belt
They didn't care. They were totally lost in one another, melting together like two halves of the same person. Harry could tell from the way Draco kissed him back that he'd been deprived of Harry's intimacy. He could feel the hurt Draco had been carrying with him through the way his kiss was so tender but so hungry. Draco was holding onto him with no intention of letting go
Harry had barely let the words slip his mouth before Draco began climaxing hard, hot cum shooting across his stomach and chest as Harry pumped his cock fiercely. Harry caught his lips once more and held Draco there in a heated kiss, as Draco moaned beneath it, jerking and pulsating, kissing through his orgasm
Harry began sliding his grip up and down Draco's cock, causing the blonde to muffle cries through the fingers still gagging him. His own erection was pressing hard between Draco's thighs as he thrusted from behind
"Because we would never work as a couple!" Harry sighed, pinching his brow feeling confused by the sudden intrusion of questions
He jerked against Harry's body while his cock twitched in his trousers, climaxing hard "Fuck Harry! Mmmmph!" he cried, his orgasm crashing down on him. Harry watched in delight as Draco trembled against him, moaning his name into his neck and panting heavily.
Harry lowered himself enough to kiss Draco hard on the lips and suddenly it was hungry, desperate kissing. Wet and sloppy with no rhythm whatsoever. Kissing, sucking, biting one another, Harry's hands caressing Draco's cheeks, sliding from his neck up to his hair where he tugged him back and exposed his neck, biting down further
Draco snaked through the crowds on his way to find another drink, anything at this point would suit him fine. The darkness made it almost impossible to see what was even on offer, all the punch bowls looked the exact same and the table was littered with spilt glasses and puddles of drink. He began ladling more punch into his glass when a familiar voice appeared beside him
"So basically we have the ability to use each others secrets against one another" Draco said plainly
"So how did it go? With the shop in Hogsmede?" Harry asked them, taking a sip of his drink that he held close to his chest
He stroked one hand across Draco's cheek gently and pulled out of him, still panting softly, his skin was hot and clammy, cheeks flushed and messy hair thrown back. He cast a cleaning spell on his cock and admired the look of shame that covered Draco's face
"I don't care. You belong to me? Understand?" Harry pushed into him, gripping the back of his neck and Draco's chest tightened "Get on your knees" he ordered, standing back from Draco to watch over him. His face snarled as though the sight of Draco disgusted him
Harry tugged on Draco's underwear, exposing his cock which was leaking with pre-cum and twitching. He bent down to lick the head but stopped just before causing Draco to gasp in desperation. Draco dropped his head back into the sheets and struggled against his wrist ties
Draco looked back over his shoulder, biting his lip in anticipation. His cock was already stiff just being on all fours for his master. He nodded and turned back to facing the headboard. He could hear Harry kicking off his shoes and tossing his clothes on the floor behind him
Draco looked at them both, his eyes darting between them as they spoke in turn. His stomach felt sick with embarrassment knowing his friends already had some idea. How long had they known? Had he really become that weak? Draco Malfoy wasn't sensitive, or sweet, absolutely not
Harry sucked on his neck hard leaving a mark and causing Draco to whimper softly. He dragged his tongue down his jawline slowly before planting kisses across his shoulders and collarbone. Draco smiled feeling the tickle of Harry's hair brushing across his neck and chin. Harry finally stopped and returned to his position behind the blonde, whispering gently in his ear
Harry slowly pulled out and stroked his hands across Draco's back, caressing him softly while the Slytherin lay beneath him, recovering. He laid down on his side and Draco crooked his head up to meet him, his silver eyes filled with vulnerability. Harry caressed his cheek, then slowly stroked the strands of hair from his eyes as Draco looked up at him tenderly.
Draco whimpered silently, he felt his chest tighten and flushed with embarrassment at being confronted so personally. At first he thought Harry was going to hit him and braced for the impact but nothing came. Instead, he had a hunger in his eyes, his smirk almost arousing.
"It's just a little pink powder, you know.. to spice things up a bit" she smirked, looking over her shoulder, keeping an eye out for anyone watching
Draco was writhing in pure ecstasy. Every touch electrified him, he had lost his sense of being as Harry penetrated him hard and kissed him desperately
Draco stopped fiddling with the loose thread and closed his eyes, biting back the pain as fresh tears welled in his eyes. Pansy saw this and took his hand, stroking her thumb over his "I think so"
"I need a drink" Draco added, heading over to the table filled with an array of colourful punch bowls and nibbles
Hermione was lost amongst the sea of students, dancing and singing graciously with Ginny, Katie, Romilda and other girls from various houses she'd only met in the last hour or so but regardless, they were all friends now and loving every moment
"Yes you are" Harry pumped Draco's cock faster as he reached around him while simultaneously continuing to spank his beautiful arse
"You're eager" Harry called out as he turned the corner of the castle to see Draco standing nervously outside the room of requirement
Ginny Weasley made him blush awkwardly, Cho Chang gave him butterflies but Draco... Draco Malfoy made him weak. Made him desperate. Made him whole.
"Spread your legs for me" Harry whispered and Draco complied. He was bent over facing the wall as Harry grabbed his hard cock and pressed against Draco's hole. Draco winced at his touch while Harry held him close with the other hand on Draco's hip
"Avoiding you? I spent half the night on my knees for you. Ill see you later" Draco turned back to the door but Harry leapt off the bed. He caught Draco's wrist pulling him backward and Draco yanked his arm away, frustrated "Look, I know we enjoy doing what we do but I would also appreciate some alone time as well, thanks"
His mind drifted back to the memories of Draco from across the years, desperate to convince himself that any form of closeness with him would be a mistake; The name calling, the blood status discrimination, the spoilt child that was desperate to please his father
"Enough! I don't want to hear it. I will be keeping a close eye on both of you and if i see even a hint of foul play I will not hesitate to ban you. Now, shower, get dressed and I expect to see you both back in the Great Hall in time for dinner, no exceptions"
"Incarcerous" Harry whispered, leaning closer to Draco's ear causing black rope to bind its way around Draco's wrists. The ties wound tightly around his flesh and trailed up the sheets to the headboard, restraining him to the bed "You're mine"
"Good boy" Harry smiled wickedly, biting down as his hand connected with Draco's arse over and over, the sound echoing off the walls "You're only here to be used"
"Pretty much" Draco rubbed his eyes to rid the final tears, still sniffing occasionally but his breathing had calmed now he was surrounded by his friends. "I never even considered being with men before but now..."
Harry lips curled to a subtle smile as he checked over his shoulder one last time and gestured toward the wall
"We've noticed the way you've been looking at him during classes, it's... different" Blaise admitted
"Just admit it, Potter. You're not that great anymore. You don't have the drive, or the courage. You're getting soft"
"Alright, we're sorry but you're miserable darling, we want to find someone for you" Pansy took a sip of her tea
Going from the cold damp dungeon hallway through to the common room was a shock to the senses. The sound of the music blasting from the speakers, vibrating off the walls, the smell of sweet liquor and cheap perfume, the light so dim it took a moment for Harry's eyes to come back into focus and the adjust to the sudden heat of fifty bodies crammed together
"Ugh will you just shut up for once in your life?" Harry moaned, feeling a heat growing through him, shame at being caught looking but also arousal at what he saw. Frustration was rising in him, mixed with their recent quarrel and Malfoy pushing his limits, he had had enough, he stepped away from the shower and turned back to him
"Ah! Good thing we're in the room of requirement then" Harry smiled, waving his wand where a tray filled with food appeared on the bed behind them. It was piled high with fruit and pastries, meats, cheeses and glasses of juice
Holding back the tears was almost impossible. All the way through the castle to the depths of the Slytherin common room, Draco held himself together, keeping his head low and a fake smile plastered on as he passed the last of the trailing students that night
Harry bent down coming close to Draco's face, gracing his cheek with his fingers and Draco shivered at his touch. Harry flicked his wand producing the same leather collar he'd used on Draco before, and saw as his eyes lit up
"What?! Absolutely not!" Draco lied "Why would I have feelings for bloody Potter? That annoying little twerp wishes he could get someone as good as me" he rolled his eyes looking annoyed but was masking the panic of them pin-pointing Draco's crush so easily
Harry jumped down from the desk and stood in front of Draco, moving in closer to him causing Draco to step backward until he hit the door. Trapped again.
"I know! I know" Harry rubbed his eyes and sighed "I know you've changed, Draco, I can see it, I've noticed how different you are now since we became... since we started... this"
"You keep saying.. that I 'belong to you' but.. when I ask you where we're really going... you change the subject"
Pansy laughed and shook her head "Of course not, you idiot! I mean, who wouldn't?" Draco and Blaise both shot up sharing confused glances at that remark "What?" she held her other hand up defensively "Alright so he's not my favourite person in the world but he's still a hottie"
Their eyes locked together and for a moment they couldn't break apart. Harry noticed how sad Draco looked, instantly feeling a yearning in his stomach to comfort him, to hold him and kiss him. Every feeling from before resurfaced upon seeing the beautiful blonde
"Maybe you could tell him how you really feel, now that you've actually had time to process everything. You could tell him that you're having second thoughts..." she suggested
"Gorgeous Slut" Harry smirked, sitting down on the bed he opened a book and flicked the pages open "You stay there until I tell you to move" he spoke, eyeing Draco from across the room. He adored seeing Draco so submissive, he knew he could ride out the punishment just a little longer
"Fuck yes... oh Draco... fuck!" Harry panted and Draco sped up, still locking eyes and moaning while Harry lost himself in the heat. Draco sucked and licked desperately despite the restriction of having his hands bound behind him
"It's so hard" Draco smiled "The willpower it takes not to smack your stupid head sometimes Is unbelievable"
Harry lifted Draco's head with his fingers and traced one across his parted, drooling lips "I'll definitely have to gag you, you're such a moaner"
Malfoy began lathering up soap between his hands as he carried on talking, still facing the shower wall "I get it, you're a sore loser, it's fine-"
"Are you getting rude with me again? I might not be so kind to you next time" Harry teased and Draco rolled his eyes. "Exactly, Slut. Be nice to your Master" Harry added, playfully scooping a blob of whipped cream off the plate with his finger and smearing it across Draco's cheek
"Fuckkk" he moaned, clasping his eyes shut, arching back into the mattress. Harry smiled to himself watching Draco thrust and beg beneath him. He placed his knee between Draco's thighs and spread his legs open wider
"I love what we've got going here" he said plainly "Don't get me wrong, It's different, and totally bonkers, but its cool too"
"Ugh, what a snooze-fest" Harry chuckled. He waved his wand and the room provided as usual. A large jug of black coffee appeared on a new silver tray on the bedside table, along with two mugs and a small pot of milk. Harry poured a mug for Draco and passed it over, then made a cup for himself, sinking back into the cushions, hugging it to his chest
"How did this even happen?" Blaise asked, plucking another chocolate mint from the bag and slipping it into his mouth
"Oh aren't you just gorgeous" Harry smiled wickedly. He pushed the tip of his cock against Draco's lips, smearing pre-cum over his face "Now you can touch me"
Pansy noticed this exchange and looked between them both, her eyes darting from Harry with a look of distrust, then back to Draco, but she said nothing. Hermione and Ron also noticed Harry's change in expression and shared glances, surprised to see he was looking at Malfoy
"Do you think.. what we're doing here.. do you think it'll come to and end at some point?" Draco asked timidly. His chest dropped with anxiety, realising he wasn't ready to let go
His cock pulsated as hot cum shot out the tip, covering Draco's face. Draco clenched his eyes shut and moaned as Harry's cum splattered across his chin, cheeks and nose, even some in his hair.
Finally, he took Harry's hand by smoothly linking their fingers together and turned, slowly guiding him from the floor, weaving in and out of the shocked students who were staring at both of them in total disbelief
Draco nodded but showed no sign of eagerness so Harry cupped his chin and pulled him close, kissing him softly onto the lips. Draco's stomach was twisting with a mixture of nerves, confusion and arousal. He wanted this so badly but couldn't shake the feeling of being vulnerable at the hands of Harry Potter, of all people.
"Mmm you like that, slut?" Harry moaned in his ear, Draco nodded desperately with wide eyes, his cock twitching below
Draco smiled to himself. He was filled with happiness, enjoying a private breakfast with someone he never dreamed he would want to be with. He was content, and realised he loved spending time with Harry. He was kind, and gentle, someone Draco needed in his life
"Of course" Harry smiled, taking a moment to brush the dishevelled hair out of Draco's eyes. For the first time he was looking at Draco in a different light. His features were softer when he wasn't sneering or spitting hate. His eyes filled with desire and a longing to be touched. Harry then ran his fingers through Draco's hair and gripped it hard, tugging him up so his ear met Harry's lips where Harry whispered softly
Harry pulled back and looked at Draco dead in the eye, wearing a devilish smirk "If I was weak, Draco... would I kiss you like this?"
"Fuck!" Harry cried out, banging his fist against the wall in frustration. He didn't want to feel this. He didn't sign up for it. "I don't have feelings for Malfoy!"
He watched as the boy moved closer to him so effortlessly, his dark eyes fixed on him as though they were seeing into his soul
Draco smiled, feeling genuinely happy to open up to Harry. He had always masked it before with thoughts of sex and kink but for the first time he was ready to let Harry look after him. It was strange, but he wanted it
She marched off back to the castle along with the final stragglers of students. Harry headed back to the shower rooms with Draco close behind him. He was furious and didn't want to spend another second in his company.
Pansy shot a glance at Blaise and cocked her brow "Draco.. you can be honest with us, we won't judge you"
For those of you, like myself, that are immersive readers (you like to set the mood with sounds/lighting/smells etc) I've decided to try something. If you want to get into the 'party' feel whilst reading this chapter I have included names of song titles that are playing throughout the scenes (just suggestions, by all means put on your own Slytherin playlist). This helps me get a stronger feel for what's happening in the chapter, so If you're into that then plug your music in, set your green LED lights and enjoy lmao
Harry was kneeling beside Draco at his hip, he ran his hand across him gently, stroking from his arm down his body before smacking him hard on the arse
He knew his friends we're just trying to encourage him to move on but he knew deep down that no one else could make him feel true happiness and acceptance like Harry could. He yearned to feel vulnerable again, submit to Harry's every command, to feel so dirty and ashamed and love every moment of the filthy, filthy pleasure.
Draco didn't know why he would find himself staring at the boy who rejected him. But he did. And he didn't mind the view.
"To answer your question, yes it does. But what hurts the most is-" I said after long minutes but she finished for me. "He can't be with you". Harry nodded and looked away.
Theos body disappeared I'm the fire along with Goyal. Blaise balling his eyes out couldn't hand on the ledge any longer. Draco grabbed him and threw him in the back of Ron's broom. Blaise held on so tightly to Ron not conscious of how hard he was actually holding him.
"Well, I wasn't expecting to have to go find another god damn thing that's lost. You would think Dumbledore left you a how you save the world parchment" He snapped harshly. His words hitting Harry like a sharp knife.
"Don't worry you won't be laughing when you have my breakfast tomorrow" Harry mumbled. Draco looked at Harry again with a wide smile. "You're staying the night?"
Harry turns when he hears a noise from behind him. He looks around and sees no one so he continued to get the food. "Ahh Potter, I would have thought we would be catching Weasley in the kitchens" Draco spat from behind him. Harry sighed and turned around to see Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle.
The return to school was nothing special. Everyone jumped back into their school work and the gossip.
He spent Christmas by himself. Locked away. Away from the world. His parents. Draco felt trapped around anyone but himself.
"What about having kids?" Harry asked after moments of silence. Draco sighed and looked over at him. "Never really thought about it, I mean I have always had to provide an heir but, being a parent never really went through my mind" He explained.
A faint knock was heard on Draco's door. "Draco, are you ready?" Tonks asked. Draco sighed and opened the door. "You know Harry didn't want me to go?"
Harry and Draco grabbed him warning him if he were to storm up there he would get hurt or get Hermione hurt more.
He saw her say at the bottom of the stairs sniffing her tears away. Small yellow birds flew around her and made the faintest little sounds.
"He looks almost Ill" Hermione muttered as Draco came into the great hall and sat at the Slytherin table. Ron turned around and joined in on staring at Malfoy. Draco looked up at the trio with furrowed brows. They all turned away.
"Yea anything Mione" he whispered. "I don't want to make you sad, I'm just curious-" Harry cut her off. "You can ask me anything Mione. I won't be sad," he reassured.
All their eyes went wide. A deep scream was heard through the entire room. A scream of pain, the worse taping in the world. No one knew who screamed until they saw who Goyal took down with him.
Meanwhile, Harry sat outside the Weasley burrow the family as it burned. Burned because of Draco's aunt and the rest of the skin Deatheaters.
Ron took in every moment of glory with pride. Everyone was chanting his name and all his dreams were coming true.
He knew what his choices would come down to, he wished that he had more time with him. With his love.
He couldn't take this anymore. He wanted to make himself feel better. But he didn't know how, he wishes he could forget everything that's happened and just be with him. Lay with him. Kiss him one last time. One last I love you.
"You're just like him" he mumbled. Harry slowly stood and put his hands in his pockets. "Like who, Ron? Please share with the tent"
The four of them ran through the ministry trying to run from the guards. Draco through a spell behind them to give them more time to run away.
Ron and Hermione had each other but he, he would be alone forever. Or have to settle for something he didn't want.
"Please don't leave mommy. I need you. I need my baby boy. I'm so sorry for all of this. Draco please stay. Stay with me." She begged.
Ron and Hermione rushed for some food, both starving they pushed down the weirdly tasting bread with their drinks...which wasn't good either.
He looked next to his mother and father and saw Astoria slowly nodded her head. It was time he thought. All his plans coming to an end.
He handed Harry a silver ring that had a green gem on it with gold chips in the green. It had been a ring Harry always saw him wear. Along with his family ring and Slytherin one.
"Do we still think Malfoy's up to something, for the dark lord?" Ron asked. "I think so, but should I confront him about it?" Harry questioned. Hermione rolled her eyes "you still think his a-" she stopped and got closer to the boys. "Death eater?"
She smiled and made her way towards him. "Help me with the zip please?" She asked and turned around. He nodded and moved her hair out of the way.
His mother rolled her eyes and placed them back on her book. She hadn't read the papers in a few years ever since Voldemort's return. She hated hearing terrible news and that's all they wrote about.
Love isn't simple but it isn't hard to understand. I knew I was in love the moment I met you, even though back then we couldn't call it love, but I knew without a doubt.
"It was a drunken night, this was before we had kissed or even told each other of our affection. We both were feeling terrible about the world around us. We had run into each other on the astronomy tower and spent the entire night together" He explained.
"We need your help sir" Hermione spoke. He turned to her and raised his brows. "We need to get in the castle. We think there's something in there that could help us defeat Voldemort."
"Come here Draco, it's ok" Tonks whispered. Draco looked up at Harry then at the women. He slowly moved closer to her and the baby. He hated children, but when he looked in his eyes...something came over him. His dark green eyes and the little blue hair he had on his head made Draco's insides cry out of cuteness.
,,Right, I forgot. Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived's got all the positive traits!" Draco said sharply, sitting up.
,,I knew how a usual visit during the day with your pals would go! 'Came to see the one you've injured, Potter? We crashed in the forest and he wanted to leaveme to die! I couldn't move! I had to crawl and I had to leave my broom there'!" Harry mocks.
seem to be doing all the work," Draco said and they stopped in their tracks in shock. ,,Potter, I mean Potter-" he huffed out quickly.
,,I am not going to respond to that," Draco stiffens the corners of his mouth but it doesn't look like a smile. It was back to his usual ironic smirk. And maybe Harry liked that better.
And Draco sure did have the right to be scared. As soon as he saw him, Professor Lockhart tried to un-break his leg with probably not very tested spell and that caused Draco's leg to lose its bones completely. Still, he didn't have to make so much drama out of it. He was coping fine until the crowd surrounded them. His complaints were exaggerated and he basically threw on his usual Princess Malfoy facade. So, much to everyone's worry, he was transferred into the hospital wing immediately to get professional help from Madam Pomfrey.
,,Potter!" Draco now outright screams so that he would stop yelling at him and just listen. And that seems to do the job and Harry shuts up and turns around to face the blond, expectant of what he's planning to say, with his lips narrowed into a thin line.
Draco screamed three octaves higher and saw Harry smirking down at him, trying really hard not to laugh. ,,Potter! You scared the hell out of me!" he rits through his teeth and his voice quiets not to wake up the other students.
,,Never say that again," Draco lifts his eyes to him and Harry raises his hands into a defending gesture. ,,And I really don't know what you're talking about."
,,I didn't know those were your tracks," he points at the ground to specify, Harry's eyes following. He doesn't reply though and Draco has no bloody idea of what to say or do next. So they stand in silence for a solid minute, until Draco thinks it's the appropriate (as in less inappropriate) time to grow a pair and finally ask:
But suddenly, there seemed to be far more trees than one would expect to see in a school area and Harry snapped out of his daze. The Golden Snitch was still flickering in front of him and once he focused his ears, he could hear Malfoy shouting something from behind him but he couldn't make up what it was. The wind thudded too loud in his ears. He figured it was probably just another insult and kept going. He was sure the Snitch would turn and fly back any moment now, it wouldn't just lead them into nothing. So, he followed it. And so did Malfoy.
He snapped his head to the side when he heard the door creak but he didn't see anyone so he carried on with the book. Couple of seconds passed before the intruder revealed themselves.
,,I really don't know where you fit all that snark," Harry shook his head but reached out a hand to the blond who hesitantly took it and gave Harry not more than a single glare. He pulled him up but as he did, Draco's weight shifted and as he didn't have another leg to stand on, he started falling forward, right into Harry's arms.
He grabs Harry's hands by the wrists and gently pulls them away from his head, placing them onto his lap. His hands are freezing cold and he can see how pink they are. He assumes Harry didn't have gloves. Plus... now that he thinks about it, he doesn't remember seeing Potter go to Hogsmeade with them. It doesn't even make sense that he's here.
Draco hissed when his leg met the ground and they both knew he needed help as soon as possible. It's only just a little further.
And Harry wanted to see how the poor boy was doing. He knew how a normal visit would probably go though, with Malfoy flipping him off or something and his friends laughing at him. So he decided to wait.
,,Shh! Merlin, tone it down!" Draco whisper-shouts. Harry encourages him with a head nod. ,,Fine. I'm an attention seeker," he sighs playfully and drops his shoulders, pretending. Harry frowns, amused.
,,No, you say that proudly!" Harry continues teasing him with a dramatic expression and gets a pillow thrown at him.
,,Why'd you start being such a loudmouth when we got back. You certainly didn't seem so overwhelmed when you were in my arms," Harry purposely changes the tone and laughs when Draco turns red.
at his hair from how frustrated he was. ,,You know what? Fine! If you're so determined to walk all the way there with a broken leg, be my guest. I am sure this," he lifts his broomstick, ,,will be able to hold me up for some time and then I'm going to enjoy dinner with my friends while you won't even be past half of your journey, alone, in a dark forest, with a possibility that something will murder you. See you then, Malfoy."
He realizes Draco's fingers are tracing patterns on his back as he quietly sobs into his sweater, and he's amazed at how good Draco actually is at this. He would have never thought that he'd quite literally be crying on Draco Malfoy's shoulder.
Neither of them talks and it's quiet. And Harry thinks he might fall asleep listening to Draco's heartbeat. He doesn't think too much of it as a pleasant smile spreads on his lips.
,,Really, do I?" Draco's voice was purposely higher, as if to add the sarcastic comment a higher effect. Harry rolled his eyes, clearly forgetting that Malfoy's sarcasm was about on the same level as his own.
,,That's it, we're switching positions," Harry couldn't hold in anymore and Draco gave him a bewildered look. Harry only raised his eyebrows, hinting, and it took Draco a second before he scrunched up his nose in something only vaguely close to disgust.
They both groaned in pain and it took them a minute before they fully came to their senses. And once they did, they looked at each other with a disgusted look, and said at the same time:
That evening would have been decent if Harry hadn't looked back at it the next morning. He hated himself for acting so playfully with the blond.
The blonde boy finally stood up and Harry walked right past him, getting on his broom and lifting his feet off the ground. ,,By the way, your 'chosen one' insults are getting really boring," he said without turning at him, before beginning to fly off.
Sure, he was still very well aware of them, one doesn't just forget about being the target of a murderer, but they seemed to be weighing him down a little less all of a sudden.
,,Didn't ask you to," Harry does smile though and he picks up his invisibility cloak. Draco doesn't say anything so he steps out the line of beds. ,,Well, see you then," he turns around.
,,For mudbloods maybe," Draco says and it sounds like a joke but if he was being honest, he didn't even think it was funny. He realized how ridiculous his insults at muggle-borns were after the incident with Granger on the field. Harry didn't look amused either.
,,I wasn't going to laugh," Draco speaks sincerely, not a hint of mock in his voice. Harry glares at him in suspicioun and unsure, and Draco would be lying if he said it didn't sting a little. But then again, he can't really blame him. It's not like Draco has ever given him a reason to trust him. Yeah, he really wasn't taking Harry's rejection of his friendship request well.
in front of him, supporting himself with the trees and with what was left of his broomstick. ,,You obviously can't walk and we're probably more than a mile from the Quidditch Pitch. There is no possible way you're gonna finish that distance all on your own!"
,,Yeah, no shite. Why didn't you stop? I was shouting at you that we were getting too far from the Pitch," Malfoy replied and his voice almost didn't sound mocking.
,,Are you okay? Where have you been? We've lost you when in the shack. What did the minister say?" Hermione showers him with questions as soon as he returns, having parted ways with Draco as soon as they possibly could, the blinded awkwardness of the situation finally weighing down on them.
,,You look like you're in a lot of pain," he decided not to address it directly because he didn't need unnecessary banter with the other boy.
,,What's wrong?" he repeats. ,,What's wrong?!" his voice grows louder and his eyebrows drop into an angry frown. ,,Hm, let's see, the dementors have a bigger effect on me than on anyone else," he lifts his hand and starts counting on his fingers. ,,There's a serial killer running around, whose priority and goal,
,,Put your arms around my neck, please," Harry gritted through his teeth and when Draco didn't cooperate, he continued. ,,Look, this isn't any more enjoyable for me than it is for you-"
,,What do you want, Malfoy?" the other boy spits at the confused boy with look colder than the landscape around them. He doesn't look very fond of seeing the blond.
,,No- Potter-! Where are you going?! Wait!" Draco yelled out but tripped again and planted another face in the ground. ,,Potter," he gritted through his teeth but it's muffled.
,,Okay, Draco," he looks up at him and his corners curve into a sad smile, ,,but he's still my godfather. And it doesn't change the fact that he betrayed them. He was probably there when I was born, he probably held me in his arms, he probably babysat me when my parents took a day for themselves. He was their best friend and he betrayed them. My only family is dead because of him."
“Professor, we could ask Sir Cadogan if he let anyone in? That’s the only way anyone could get in,” Hermione said.
They stayed until he was marginally better, and left knowing they shouldered the weight of Buckbeak’s life. “Just tell your boyfriend to make his dad lay off,” Ron grunted.
Potter noticed him before he reached the Gryffindor table and frowned. He nudged Weasley and Granger, directing their attention to him. “What do you want?” He asked.
“Better,” Ron replied, but he looked worried. “She’s more shy than I’ve ever seen. I think everyone’s a bit scared of her still. She’s got a friend in Ravenclaw though, so that’s something.”
Pansy rolled her eyes and Blaise grinned. “We’ll be in the common room,” Blaise replied, and they walked back towards Hogwarts.
Draco nodded, although he only succeeded in mussing up the back of his hair on Pansy’s skirt. “I agree, Pans. But Potter can’t even do that. He’s an imbecile!” Pansy hummed in agreement. “And he has a dumb face, with his dumb scar. Who would think a scar is cool? You could get a scar from falling down stairs or some other stupid reason. What if his hot scar is from stairs, huh? What then, Potter?”
Draco slipped his hands under Harry’s shirt and Harry yelped and fell back. “Your hands are freezing, you prat!”
Lifting his head up, he pressed his wand against his ripped essay, said, “Reparo,” and continued writing. He would just see if the House Elves would bring him food back in the common room after his detention.
“It’s fine. I guess I don’t feel that way towards her, either. I have feelings for someone else, I think.”
They threw the rest of the meat onto the field, and Hagrid continued to walk around to the bits of floating meat, occasionally reaching out to pet the invisible creatures. It was the quickest detention they had so far, but also the most disgusting. Potter told Hagrid they had used all of the meat, and he dismissed them.
“Might wanna ask the idiots next to you about literacy,” Weasley quipped. Flanked by Crabbe and Goyle, Draco felt both of them tense up, and he felt mildly impressed that they knew what literacy meant.
Draco took a moment, and Harry could see the gears turning in his head. “I could always stay here. I don’t think most of our year will want to be inside. It’s Christmas.”
The note from McGonagall requested him at her office at eight again. He said goodbye to Pansy, grinned when he saw how relieved Blaise felt, and left for the classroom. Potter was waiting at a desk, two boxes in front of him.
His stomach growled, and he groaned and put his head into his arms. He had plenty of time to get dinner before his detention, but that would mean running into Pansy, and though he had said he would try talking to her he was far from ready for it.
Draco looked at Potter, who was staring back at him. Conflict brought people together. In some situations, they could unite against the common enemy, the enemy being school authority, and forge an odd bond. But Draco hated Potter for his words and the pain in his chest, so he glared at him, feeling a little less smitten by his eyes.
With his thumb repaired, Draco sat in Defense Against the Dark Arts. “Good morning everyone,” Professor Lupin said. Draco could not believe this man got hired to teach. His robes looked older than any Hogwarts student. His hair was graying and long in a messy way, and scars criss crossed his face. He didn’t look rugged, nor did he look scary. He just looked rumpled. Rumpled and sad.
He didn’t dwell on it for long, though. He hadn’t eaten yet, and he should grab a meal before Herbology.
Professor Lupin jumped in front of him, and Pansy and Blaise were at his side. Draco put his head in his arms and curled up as low as he could, more from shame than anything else. He heard Lupin dismiss the class and heard Pansy reassure him that Draco was fine, that they were going to keep an eye on him, that they should really get going now.
They both looked around. They were still alone, and they were whisper-yelling at each other so as to avoid detection. “You don’t have to lie to me, but don’t you dare lie to yourself. If we can’t rely on each other, then who the else can we rely on?”
“Crabbe and Goyle are my friends,” Draco huffed, but Blaise didn’t buy it. “Look, I’ll talk to her, okay? But everyone else chose to ignore me just because of my father. Everyone fears the Malfoy name.”
“-and Pansy and Blaise in the Slytherin common room.” Draco took a few steps around, letting go of the map but still looking. “Amazing! It really shows everything!”
Draco grabbed one end of it to get a better look, and Harry surprised himself when he didn’t immediately take it away. “This is insanely complex stuff. Look, there’s us. Your two friends in the tower-”
“Be a bit weird for you to have a drink with yourself, wouldn’t it?” Secretly, Harry appreciated how absurd Draco looked seemingly talking to himself.
“Works with me,” Draco replied. He took off his robes and rolled up his shirt sleeves. Scowling, he picked up a sponge and a bucket. With a grimace on his face, he started scrubbing at the grime that had accumulated on the sides of the tank.
Now Weasley jumped up, and another tall redhead made an appearance. “What’s going on?” The Head Boy grabbed his brother and pulled him back down. “You three, go back to the Slytherin table.”
The situation was not helped when Hagrid told them that Buckbeak had a second trial, but it didn’t look good. “They didn’ even listen to me,” he said, his eyes watery. He, Ron, and Hermione were all in his hut, expertly avoiding the snacks he had offered.
“You’re nearly there, Harry,” Lupin would say honestly. That was the worst part. He meant it sincerely. He had improved. Every time a blue wisp would work it’s way out of his wand, and sometimes it would shape itself into something. Not a defined shape so much as the promise it could soon be one. But he would still leave wrapped in his mother’s voice, questioning if it was worth it.
“I got a letter from my parents.” She handed Draco a sheet of paper, and Draco squinted at it before grabbing his wand and saying Lumos. “I was pissed at you. You just got bounced down a few pegs, though.”
He heard voices inside of Lupin’s classroom. Draco stopped and looked around the hallway. There was no sign of Potter, despite their detention starting now. Cautiously, Draco pressed his ear against the door. He could hear Lupin talking.
“I tried everything I could, but I can’t ask father,” Draco said in hushed tones. Ron scowled and Hermione herself didn’t look to kind, either, but Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and ignored them, encouraging him to keep talking. “I talked to Pansy and Blaise about it-”
They finished and went by the lake, enjoying the sun as Hermione reviewed her notes. “Next Hogsmeade trip is coming up soon,” Ron said.
“Got it. Thanks.” Frowning, Draco returned to his own room, where he was alone. And so it appeared he was back to only Crabbe and Goyle.
When McGonagall returned his broom, he nearly cried. Dear Merlin, they had a chance. No, much better than a chance, they would win.
“Raw meat!” Draco let out a soft laugh and put his head in his hands. “They’re invisible, so just toss the food onto the ground a bit away from each other. They shouldn’t fight anyway, but I wouldn’t want either of you to get in the middle of one.” Hagrid picked up a bucket full of raw meat and set it down in front of him and Potter. Then he turned and whistled.
“Yeah.” Draco had almost forgotten about that. Defense Against the Dark Arts had been unusually eventful. “Joint detention or something; we have to serve it together and get along or else we’ll keep getting more.”
“I don’t like it,” Harry said. “I should’ve been punished, but you weren’t there. You would’ve done the same thing.” He stared down Blaise, and something flickered in his eyes. It was something that, if Harry couldn’t outright recognize it, at least sympathize.
Hermione looked torn between guilt and suspicion. Ron was too busy staring across at the Slytherin table. Draco was staring at them (it was easier to lump them together than admit he was looking only at Harry). “Honestly, the nerve of him. He got you into detention for a week and still wants to sit over there all smug.”
“Put them back in the box before you transfigure them so they don’t escape,” Draco mimicked as childishly as he possibly could. “Some of us aren’t idiots, Potter.”
“Don’t kill my boyfriend, please.” Ron gave a small laugh, and Harry grinned. Hermione looked between them and smiled.
“They won’t tell anyone,” Harry reassured. Guilt gnawed at his stomach, and he said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t think you’d care.”
Harry looked between them, his first and best friends, and felt everything surge within him all at once.
“I’m going to turn in early.” They did nothing to mask their concern, but Ron didn’t follow and the bedroom was empty. He didn’t get changed and instead fell into bed. There was too much to unpack. It was easier to just ignore for the time being.
Draco was almost certain he dissociated and missed the next ten minutes as Harry helped him clean the tank. Before he realized it, they had put away the sponges, vanished the water in the buckets, and dried the tanks.
Draco did, not so much from the whispered words, but from the fact that he was being shaken by the shoulders. He opened his eyes, sore from how early it was, to see Pansy. “How’d you get in here?” The Slytherin common room was in the dungeons with windows that showed the lake, so they didn’t get much natural light. However, it was pitch black in the water. “What time is it?”
They brought the boxes back to McGonagall and she dismissed them, pleased that they had not tried to kill each other for the third time.
Draco glowered at him. In two hours, he would find himself with Potter in Lupin’s room, where they would be helping him clean out tanks and whatnot. Draco was incredibly tired. It had only been one day, but being alone with Potter was a painful experience. He was annoying and handsome and too much to bear. And seeing Lupin again might open up questions about his boggart.
“Maybe golden boy could talk the Minister out of it. Right? Because you didn’t get in trouble for underage magic,” Blaise said, a bit clipped in tone.
“Same way he got out,” Pansy replied. She got up and nudged Draco, not unkindly. “I’m going to find Daphne. I don’t need my quota for stupidity being filled so early in the day.”
“I’m going to have some fun.” He straightened his robes and ran a hand through his hair, making sure it was neat, as Crabbe and Goyle stood up.
“He could try,” Harry conceded. Anything was worth a shot. The only one that had any actual time was Ron.
“What, you’d want to be seen with me in the Great Hall?” Harry asked. He certainly didn’t want anyone to think he was suddenly friendly with Draco. And Draco probably felt the same.
“Riddikulus!” Lupin yelled, and the dementor fled back to the dresser in the shape of a deflating balloon. He knelt next to Harry and put a hand on his shoulder. “Eat this. Until you feel better,” he said, pushing a chocolate bar into Harry’s hand.
Draco smiled, but it was a small one. “What else. Because I think you’re handsome. Too handsome for your own good, and you’re so dumb! But so clever, and the combination makes me mad and I just want to snog you. I hate it! I thought you were just eye candy but I enjoy that we’ve just been talking more. I want to talk with you more. Maybe just hang out like this more often.”
Second: This will most certainly be finished with a part 2. I do not know when that will be posted, but it will be sooner than the month long hiatus I put y'all through (I'm so sorry college and work and life, you know?)
“‘Mione, we’ve been over this, it’s fine if he wants to be with a guy. We just want it to be a better guy,” Ron said, surprisingly gentle.
Then they were all forcibly pulled apart. From where he was strewn on the floor, Draco could see McGonagall, though he would’ve known it was her when she said, in a booming voice, “What are you doing?”
Draco sneered, and Harry grinned. They were inches apart, and Draco had moved himself, quite willingly, so his back was to a broad piece of wood. Dust floated around them, and some had made a light coating on his hair. It would soon be gone once they were in the air, so Harry took the moment to appreciate his imperfection. “Don’t fall of your broom this time?” Draco said.
“Right. Sorry.” He paled, an impressive feat for how white his skin already was, though his ears were slightly pink.
“Of course it doesn’t matter,” Draco said, and Pansy sat down. “I don’t think of you any differently. Besides, you could do a lot worse than Daphne.” He gave her a reassuring smile, and he could see her tension melt away, if only a bit.
“Obviously!” He grabbed Harry’s wrist and dragged him to the witch statue, leaving Harry lost in a daze of physical contact. He opened the passage and went in first, Draco close behind him, his breath on Harry’s neck. He felt like he was going insane.
Hagrid’s eyes narrowed, but he didn’t mention it further. “You lot shouldn’t be here. Kids shouldn’t watch what’s.... Well.” He trailed off, and his eyes became misty.
“Right.” Draco sat on the windowsill next to Harry. They weren’t touching, but he was uncomfortably aware that they could be. They he could reach his hand over and take Draco’s, to rest his head on his shoulder and wrap an arm across his back until they were holding each other. He looked warm, more so in the drafty castle.
And that was low enough for a few things to happen. The Head Weasel hissed Harry’s name. Crabbe and Goyle took a moment to comprehend was Potter had just said. And Draco lunged at Potter and punched him in the face.
“Hey, um. Sorry.” Draco looked up to make sure Potter had indeed said something, and he was lounging back in one of the seats, looking away from Draco.
“Honestly, he’s being overdramatic,” George said after one practice, leaning on his broom. Harry nodded, though neither of them meant it. They were all just as hungry to win the cup, especially after the luck they had the past two years.
Draco almost said something snappy and witty in response, but McGonagall coughed and gave them both a very pointed look. “Just… Take care of the needles.”
Gryffindor tower partied well into the night until Percy told everyone he had NEWTS to study for. Sent back to their rooms, Ron found some blood and rat hair on his bed, Scabbers nowhere to be found.
Draco and Ron were betting through Harry, which was for the best and also likely the closest they could get to actual communication. Harry kept Draco’s snide remarks about Ron’s poverty to himself, Harry kept Ron’s snide remarks about Draco’s family to himself, and he was currently holding the pot of 3 galleons under his bed. Winner take all. Both were also requesting Harry assure their separate victory.
“Does it matter if I kissed Daphne? And don’t say ‘of course’ because you think it was a one-time thing. What if I only ever kissed girls? What if I only wanted to kiss girls and the thought of being with a boy disgusts me? What if my parents wanting me to settle down with a man repulses me and makes me want to run away? What if that was the case? Would it matter?”
“Here,” Harry breathed, and Draco opened the door completely to allow them entry. The common room wasn’t open, but nobody was paying enough attention to notice Draco. They followed as elegantly as they could behind him, all the way down a hallway with one wall of windows to show the depths of the lake. Hermione gasped as a mermaid came down and tapped on the glass with a toothy grin.
“Boys,” Lupin interjected in a warning tone. “It might help to talk instead of trying to insult each other.” Then he gave Potter a pointed look that was probably supposed to be discreet.
“I'll be right back,” he said, fully aware that he was about to do something very stupid. He walked to some of the trees, a more secluded area, and sure enough he heard Draco make his way through the leaves and scattered twigs.
“Get over yourself,” Draco replied, moving to sprawl on top of Harry. Calmer now, Draco pressed light kisses to Harry’s face, moving down to his neck. Harry slipped his hand up the back of Draco’s shirt, and he shrieked. “You’re freezing!”
Seeing amusement in their eyes, Lupin said, “Exactly. Another thing that’s important to note; the boggart can only take one form at a time. Sheer numbers can confuse the boggart, as it will attempt to take multiple shapes at once. That’s how we’ll finish it off. To start us off, everyone line up.”
They found themselves crashing into each other when the other one got too close, although Harry would rather have a fair game without any chance he might fall off and break his spine, but Malfoy doesn't understand the meaning of 'fair', apparently. And Harry isn't going to stand - fly - by and let himself be pushed over like that. They flew in and out, below and above, and through the Quidditch pitch, the cheers of their fellow schoolmates muffled by the sharp wind.
Harry can hear the other boy start muttering comforting words (to an extent a Malfoy is capable of) in his ear but he can't bring himself to listen to any of it. But one word does catch his attention.
"Fuck!! Fuck! Oh fuck, Harry! Yes! Fuck me!" Draco gasped, arching his back against Harry, feeling himself stretch. It was hot and it stung so badly and he craved it
"Like you don't have anything naughty hidden in your room?" Pansy disputed raising her brow with an all knowing expression. Draco thought about the little box of sex toys he had concealed under his bed and immediately stopped talking. She smirked at him and continued opening the bottle
Draco swallowed "It's not your fault... I just... I don't know how much longer I can keep pretending that I don't feel things for you"
"I'm done with you" he hissed, close enough to Harry's ear for him to feel the breath from his words on his neck "Tell anyone about what we did... and I'll never forgive you"
Draco sighed in resignation, feeling a wave of embarrassment hit him in the chest. He could feel his cheeks flushing to match his already reddened eyes. "About three months" Draco whispered, sniffing back another tear
Draco grabbed Harry's hair, deepening the passionate kiss and backing up towards his bedroom door where he kicked it open and pushed Harry through. They stumbled through the threshold of Draco's room, both still wrapped together in a heated embrace as Draco cast a locking charm and they finally found themselves alone once more, nothing else in the world mattered besides each other
Draco hesitated. His first instinct was to respond with "Yes, Master", but he remained silent, blushing red and feeling hot with irritation and arousal. He sneered as usual and pushed past Harry, walking back to the castle with his head down, his friends following close behind
One girl's jaw dropped open as Draco walked past making eye contact with her and wearing a seductive smile, his gorgeous torso visible through the openness of his shirt and the dark eyes drove everyone wild
"I'm so angry... for letting myself be vulnerable around him.. opening up for nothing" Draco cried softly, Blaise wiped the tear rolling down his cheek "He's probably laughing at me right now. Telling all his friends about what we did" the thought made him sick with shame and regret, humiliated at sharing his darkest desires to someone he once hated
Hermione broke away from the group and wandered back to Harry and Ron, slinging an arm around either of their shoulders and slumping "Come with me to get more punch?" she smiled drunkenly
But the shame, the shame was stronger than anything. Feeling a sick guilt in his stomach at exposing his darkest desires, even a hint of regret stung him as he sat there afterwards. Harry Potter had done this to him and that was it. There was no changing it. He could no longer play the tough guy, the bully, not when Harry had seen him like this. But he knew deep down he would always come back for more.
"If I was weak would I be touching you like this?" Harry asked, gripping Draco's wrists in one hand above his head while his other hand stroked up the side of his chest. Draco shuddered at the sensation
"It's what I like most about you" Harry spoke "You're not sexy when you're spitting hate or being an arse to me and my friends. But in here.. when you open up.. and put your trust in me... and show me your softer side... it's beautiful, Draco. You're beautiful"
Draco closed his eyes again and dropped his head back against the door as Harry closed in on him once more. Harry's hands slipped around his waist, up his shirt and he dug his nails into Draco's back causing him to cry out and bite down onto Harry's shoulder
"Malfoy" He yelled as Draco ran down a flight of stairs. He turned his head towards Harry and he saw a little smirk creep on Dracos lips. "Potter"
Harry has been gone for more than an hour the closer the night came the more Draco worried. Their arguments have never lasted this long. Harry refused to speak with Draco, look at him. Maybe even forget he was there.
After a few moments, he faintly saw their figures leave the room and Harry laid there, staring at the place Draco once stood.
Harry secretly followed Snape and Draco in the corridor. Draco claimed to have 'crashed' the party but Harry knew something else was going on.
"Anything by Radko, his witch and wolf series was good," Draco answered. Harry laughed. "I knew you were a romance buff"  Draco laughed and playfully hit Harry's arm.
Harry had missed whatever Bellatrix was saying but when his attention was fixed back on her, Ron and him were being taken away and Hermione was thrown into the arms of the women before them. With the dark eyes and a sinister plan.
Harry's limp body was being held by Hagrid. Draco hadn't moved a muscle since he laid eyes on Harry. He didn't cry, didn't run towards him. He just stood there.
He looked down at his hand and saw himself looking down through it. He looked back and forth through both mirrors and huffed. "Who gave you this mirror?" Harry spat.
"I've missed you" Harry whispered. Draco nodded and kissed the top of his head. Harry slowly pulled away and kissed Draco. Draco deepens their kiss. He held onto it desperately as if he wouldn't ever be able to kiss him again. Like his lips, were saying goodbye without saying a word.
"Malfoy?" Harry whispered. Draco looked up from the sink and stared at Harry through the mirror. "what do you want? Just leave me be potter" Draco spat and looked back down. "Are- are you alright... is there someone I ca-" Draco cut off harry. "I said to leave" He yelled quite loudly causing Harry to jump a little. "I'm just trying to help if someone offer-" Harry was cut off once again. Draco ran over to Harry and pinned him against the wall while keeping his wand at Harry's neck.
Harry took a seat next to her on the atom steps and looked over to her. He whipped a tear off her cheek and she smiled at him.
"Well that's your name, isn't it? Or is it Derecho, or maybe..." Harry placed his finger on his chin like he was thinking. "Drinco" He laughed.
Harry fake laughed. "Oh Ahah- so funny Harriet is my show name of course. Harry is just a facade" He smirked.
Draco woke abruptly from his sleep, a pad of sweat on his forehead and chest. His chest heaved up and down as he looked around. His heart ached and his head hurt.
Harry walked up to him and placed his hand on Draco's back. Draco flinched and slowly turned his head towards the raven-haired boy was confused by his anger that could be felt from all angles of the room.
He pointed the wand at the door and yelled the mending spell. He held on for longer this time. He thought of the strong feelings he had. Towards this whole thing, his family, Harry Potter.
Harry nodded and zipped her dress up. She slowly turned around and Ginny stared into his eyes. Both of their breaths started to slow down. Ginny moved closer and Harry fought the urge to pull away.
Hermione tried to fight their hold on her but they fought back harder. "Be careful with her" Ron yelled. The men laughed and held her tighter.
He hadn't formed proper words in days. "I feel like I've lost a part of my soul mother. I've lost my other half. And it hurts like hell" He explained. His other sighed and nodded. "You love him very much Draco, it will hurt for some time. I'm sure of it, but it will get better I roomie."
"SNAPE" Harry yelled. The professor turned around and stood still for a moment. "What have you done, you coward" he yelled again.
Draco took a sharp turn down the next hallway and disappeared. Harry walked so fast it was almost a sprint. As he turned Draco grabbed him by the arms and threw him against the wall.
Harry nodded and got up. "Where are you going, mate?" Ron asked. "To confront him" Harry storm after the boy who was already leaving the great hall.
Theo spotted Blaise and climbed after him, afraid of losing his lover. While he climbed Ron, Hermione and Harry looked for a way out. They spotted three brooms and got on them.
"Where is Harry?" McGonagall asked Draco. "He went up to see Snape's memories." She nodded and walked closer to the boy. She lifted up a washrag and cleaned off a bloody cut he had gotten when some of the roof fell onto him.
Draco felt so guilty that his blood could hurt Harry like this. He partially blamed himself, but then he remembered he would give up anyone's life for Harry. Even though Harry would probably protest against it.
They hid under some closed off tables. As two men were closing in on them someone grabbed them from behind and threw them into a room. They looked up and saw a man the resembled their late professor Dumbledore.
Everyone nodded and got up from their seats. Draco sat there and cursed at himself. He felt hands on his shoulders and he looked up into the eyes of Pansy.
"Look," Harry said and gave them the paper. Hermione shook her head. "Harry, this is probably a trap"
"I didn't suggest running. I suggested saving yourself. Saving us. Let everyone else fight, or they can run too. Run and- yes run and hide. It may not be noble but at least they'll be alive. What about teddy? Want him to grow up without a mom...or a dad?" Draco explained.
"Well... take him away," Pansy said and pointed towards Harry. Other students said 'yea' in agreement.
The men took the trio through the gates and down a long walkway with tall edges towering above them.
Goyal laughed. "And you weren't in Potters? Always second. I'm surprised he didn't even get the girl"
Goyal quickly threw a fire spell at them which caused something to burn next to him. The fire spread fast.
Harry hadn't said a word to anyone, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, even after the hug she gave him. He had nothing to say. He told McGonagall who it was and that's it. All that needed to be said.
Voldemort gave his great speech and scared everyone to their core. Everyone except Draco. Draco wasn't scared. He was disgusted.
Harry sighed and slouched down. He turned to Draco one last time before turning and shutting his eyes.
"Yes, master Malfoy?" The sleepy elf stirred. "I-I need you to get this letter to someone." He whispered.
He let them do it, but Harry didn't stop them. What else would Draco do so people didn't suspect his feelings for the chosen one? What lengths would he reach to?
The man sat down and sighed. "It was a gift from that Malfoy boy, I was doing some work for his father, he treated me poorly and as I left the boy handed it to me, he said I know it's broken but it keeps you safe" The man explained.
Hermione nodded and continued to flip through her books. She had tried coming up with a few ideas ok how to get the sword, every time getting a little more difficult.
"Well it's only-" Harry cut him off and say up. "Ok, what?" He whispered a little too harshly. "Sorry"
Draco smiled and tried to walk over to Harry they were all stopped by something...they couldn't move. No one could move. They had been drowned with darkness and pain. It felt as though the entire world went dark and everything and everyone was dead.
Draco shook his head and turned away. He stopped laughing after a few seconds and sighed. "Do you have to fight this Harry, we could just-" he paused.
"He ready Draco, prepare your self for the worst." Draco nodded and took out his wand. He closed the door to the cabinet and locked it. He was about to mutter the words until Snape stood in front of him.
Harry started to walk away but Draco grabbed his arm. He pulled him in for an embrace. Their hug lasted a while, Draco he'd Harry so tightly Harry feared for oxygen loss.
Draco hurried to fix the cabinet. The more and more he tried the more frustrating it got. Snape had to step in and help him. Even though he hated his presence.
Ron didn't say anything so Harry shoved him. Ron stood back up and an expression of sorrow washed over him. His time wearing this Horcrux needed to be over. He had almost said the most hurtful thing to his best friend.
Draco smashed their lips together. Harry placed his hand on the back of Draco's neck, and Draco placed his on Harrys lower back. After a few moments of their lips being locked Draco shoved harry backwards against the wall again. Harry stood there with furrowed brows and swollen red lips.
He jumped back down and grabbed another drink. He laughed as he saw Harry's confused face, the liquid went over his whole face.
As they were about the apparate out of the manor Harry held out his hand for Draco. Draco looked back and forth from him and his family.
Harry stands up and pushes Draco onto the ground. Draco jumps back up and punches Harrys jaw. Which then leads to Harry punching Draco's nose. That's honestly revenge for what Draco did on the train. "You piece of Gryffindor shit" Draco bellows and runs down the hall.
As he ran down the steps he ran right into Draco's chest. Harry looked at him and he was relieved to see him. Draco grabbed him and pulled him in for an embrace. As they did they got a couple of weird looks but no one was really paying attention.
Draco's mind wouldn't end with the thought of Harry. He couldn't focus on his task, on his schoolwork, even on himself. He's not been able to focus on himself.
Draco stopped laughing and kept his eyes on Harry. He smirked again and shook his head. "You called me Draco"
"Harry?" A faint voice was heard from behind them. They turned and saw Luna Lovegood, Olivander and Griphook.
Harry stopped when he saw Draco enter the restroom. Harry slowly made his way into the room and looked around for his lover.
"Why can't you just walk away from this. Join us, we'll help you" Harry insisted. Draco started to lightly laugh.
Harry walked down the steps with the rest of the Gryffindors. He was standing next to Ginny and holding her hand. She grabbed it knowing Harry's feelings towards Draco. She still stood next to him to protect him, as a friend, as someone's who has been in love for the past five years and as someone brave enough to protect another with their entire life.
He had quickly forgotten about his feelings and pushed Harry right back. As they shoved each tiver Hermione yelled for them to stop. She got in between them and slapped Ron across the face. "Leave. Go. Get out, if you're going to act this way get the hell out" she snapped. Ron looked done at her with anger, he took the necklace off, threw it and left the tent.
"Give me Harry Potter and all women, man and child will stay alive" he finished with a dark cackle. His words struck them like knives.
They all went to sleep in a lounge room with two couches and a piano. Harry and Hermione are on each couch and Ron on the floor between them.
"Did you do it?" She whispered. He sighed and nodded. "I gave him the ring and said the goodbyes I needed to."
Harry sits back in his desk chair. He lightly smiled and nodded. "A line time ago I did. They both moved on with their lives. I'm sure they are living their own dreams now."
Loving someone frees you from any chains of pain; you feel a greater sense of freedom when committed to that one person. Because you're not concentrating on finding the one! because you've already found them.
Harry searched for the crown under all the rummage. He heard faint voices coming from the entrance and he drew his wand. He sighed in relief when he saw Ron and Hermione.
"Silly Tim for a wedding don't you think? Or maybe the perfect time. To get everyone's mind off of t- you know" she said.
Aberforth shrugged. "Not sure then, I just remember the man looking fairly similar to Sirius. Maybe I was wrong" The man stood up and started to walk out of the room.
At a time like this everyone finding comfort in anything. Even though wars purpose is the separation of two nations, two groups, two people. It can still bring people together to share their pain and love with each other.
Draco stood tall and moved closer to Ron. "And who just saved your ass Weasel" Draco snapped. Harry huffed and slapped their chests. "Would you both shut the fuck up and move"
Hermione put her hand on his. "It will be ok Harry, I'm sure Dumbledore will figure something out. Good always wins" she said in a reassuring tone. Harry tried to give a light smile.
"Someone take the Pansy and the rest of Slytherin house down to the dungeons," McGonagall said allowed.

He looked down at his own hand and pulled off one of his rings. "You said we could get married. Take this, my mother gave it to me, it's yours now" Draco insisted.
"Anything good in there?" Hermione asked. Harry sighed and shook his head. "Death....a lot of death" He whispered.
"I've always wanted kids. I wanted to give them the perfect life, give them an extended amount of love. Make my parents proud of the father I could become, but I guess the future can only tell us what will happen" Harry answered.
Draco sat under the blanket and watched Harry closely. They hadn't really had any moments like this before. Just them...living as if they did it together. A normal day to day routine.
Draco smirked once again and turned to look at the sky. They were happy in those moments, unaware of what the future would hold for either of them.
"Oh and I'm keeping this Slytherin sweater by the way" Harry muttered. Draco laughed. "And what made you think I'm going to let you keep it"
Draco left with his family whole no one else paid attention. His parents aparated home while Draco and Astoria aparated on top of a hill overlooking Hogwarts.
He broke away and sighed. Snape shook his head. Draco turned to him angrily. "What? Would you like to try" Snape put his hands together and motivated him to try again.
He sighed and looked around him. He grabbed a green apple from his bag and placed it in. He closed it and waited a moment.
"He looks almost Ill" Hermione muttered as Draco came into the great hall and sat at the Slytherin table. Ron turned around and joined in on staring at Malfoy. Draco looked up at the trio with furrowed brows. They all turned away.
Harry and Dumbledore landed back in the astronomy tower. Harry smiled up at Dumbledore. Harry praised the old man. For anything.
"Let's get some rest guys, it's been a long damn day and I'm tired," Ron said as they sat in the black family dining room.
Draco ran into a corridor that Harry knew to be the Slytherin common room entryway. "Potter" Draco whispered and the door closed behind him.
"Harry" Hermione yelled and threw him the basilisk fang. Harry grabbed it mid-air and smashed it against the crown. The crown brown and its darkness went right into Harry's face.
"I'll run down to the kitchens for the food" Harry whispered to Ron, Seamus, and the other boys in the dorm. "Take your cloak" Ron mutters. Harry nodded and grabbed the cloak of invisibility from his trunk.
Harry cupped Draco's face with his palms. "I know, we both know what we've signed up for. We are both prepared now. We know the cost"
He looked down at the boy and slowly shook his head. Snape whispered the words and the door started to open.
Harry stopped talking to him. Stopped looking at him. Stopped thinking about him. The only thing on his mind was defeating Voldemort and his lessons with Dumbledore.
Thank you so much for reading my story!!! Story dedication is on Wattpad for those who would like to see it!! Hope you enjoyed!
Harry's hand grabbed the nape of Draco's neck and tugged on the small hairs that lay there. Draco placed his hands on Harry's back and pulled him so close like he wanted to be glued to Harry. Like a parasite, the only parasite he wouldn't ever get rid of.
Draco ran into a corridor that Harry knew to be the Slytherin common room entryway. "Potter" Draco whispered and the door closed behind him.
Draco smiled and nodded. "Well...without being too gross and Lovey, I think you would make a-a great father" He mumbled. Harry smiled and kissed Draco's cheek.
Tears started to sting her eyes. "Draco my boy" she whispered. She fell to her knees and brought him to her chest. He balled his eyes out into her chest. He clutched onto her night robes tightly, As if she would slip away at any sign of weakness.
"How am I supposed to go in there?" Draco asked as he started to have a panic attack. "Hey- Hey breathe," Harry said and placed his hands on the sides of Draco's face.
"Is that how it works?" Harry yelled and shoved Draco backwards. "You kiss me, then act like nothing happened" he shoved him again. "How. Dare. You. You really are the stuck up piece of shit we always thought you were" Harry started to walk away but Draco grabbed his arm.
Harry stood in front of the three and nodded his head. Hermione started to tear up and held him in an embrace. "I know Harry. I know" she whispered.
Hermione scoffed and hit his chest. "Was not" Ron looked at her knowingly and she blushed. Harry laughed and gave her a light tap on the back.
He walked into the study and quickly grabbed a piece of paper and quail. He wrote down a long paragraph, folded the paper, placed it in his pocket and left the room.
His mother entered the room and gave him a light smile. The boys walked into the room and stood beside Draco.
Harry walked over to her and held her in an embrace. "Is my father alright?" She whispered. Harry nodded and she sighed in relief.
Draco slowly opened his eyes and had a wide grin on his face. Harry smiled and kissed Dracos forehead. "Hey Love, sleep well?" He asked. Draco nodded and stretched.
Harry undressed and put some soft pants on. He left his shirt off, climbed into bed and turned off his light.
After several minutes of cooing the baby and congratulating Tonks. Lupin finally spoke up. "We've decided-" he gulped. "We've decided to make Harry The Godfather" he finished proudly.
"I-I'm sorry baby, I can't. Y-your father- he won't let me. He knows about you and the Potter boy. He's angry" She wept.
Draco turned to him with a smirk and laughed. Harry turned his head to him and furrowed his brows. "What's so funny?" Harry laughed.
All sounds around Harry were now silent. He felt Voldemort's pain and to Harry, it felt like a small victory.
"I- I told you, Harry, if I wanted to walk away I would, but I can't" He explained. Harry shook his head. "No, enough bullshit. Everyone had a choice. This isn't right. You have a damn choice! So make one" Harry spat.
As he said só the doors of the great hall opened and what was left of the order of the Phoenix came walking in. When Harry turned to them his eyes went straight to the blonde boys.
She kissed his lips and he let her. Let all the pain of Draco Malfoy fly past him. She moved her hands to his cheeks and he pulled her closer to him. Trying to act as if he was madly in love with her since they were children, since the moment he saw hi- her.
Draco tried to stay calm. "Don't worry, you'll bring him to the dark lord to die as he rightfully should, and we can live happily ever after" She mumbled.
"Mother" Draco whispered. "Hmm," she said and looked up from her book. "I can't do this anymore" he mumbles, His voice very low.
"Ok, favourite book?" Harry asked as he played with Dracos fingers. Draco laid his head on Harry's stomach and looked up and the ceiling while trying to think of an answer.
"Why are you here again, I've got this" Draco spat and held out his wand. He muttered the mending spell and tried to hold the spell for as long as he physically could.
He sighed in relief to know he was still ok and went against his wishes to come here. He wanted him safe but he wanted to say goodbye to him, even though Harry still had hoped they would win and everyone would get their happy ending!
"Stop doing whatever you're doing with my sister, I know she likes you, but you and me both know who you really have feelings for" he spat. Harry furrowed his brows.
How dare he Harry thought. They were supposed to be in this together. Harry's face scrunched up in anger. He slowly walked over to Ron, his anger only rising. "Well Ron, if you don't like it then leave. No one is stopping you."
Draco saddled Harry's lap and their kiss deepened. "I love you so much Potter" He whispered to him. Harry smiled and kissed him again.
"Lupin specifically said no return letters. For your safety Harry. Our safety" she explained. Harry nodded and looked in the opposite direction trying to make eye contact with her and Ron.
A single tear rolled down his face as Goyle kicked his stomach repeatedly, Crabbe punched his face. Draco had said something to the guys and they stopped. Harry couldn't see their faces and could barely hear them.
"T-thank you sir" Hermione stuttered. The man nodded and ushered them further into the house. Ron couldn't help but stare. The man nodded and introduced himself. "I'm Aberforth"
His heart filled with joy, maybe knowing she was in love with someone helped him heal his heart. Helped him settle with the fact he will be marrying this girl who felt the same way he did.
"Even if our side doesn't win, our parents will still control us. They always will and always have" Her words hit his head. They formed unwanted anger.
Oh but I have, I have Harry. Love isn't something made up, or a fairytale you hear before your sleep. It's real and it feels amazing.
He dreamt of him in a dark place he could escape or be rescued from. Harry had never had a bond like this one. Neither of them had.
Draco sighed and turned on his side. "Fine, but I won't be there to watch you die. I won't watch as the man I love with my entire heart gives his life for everyone else"
Draco relaxed a little and felt a warmth in his chest knowing Harry actually cared about more than just sex. He realised he missed him
"Quiet slut!" Harry cracked the belt down on the floor beside Draco, with a sudden smack that made him jump "I'll won't hesitate to use this across your perfect little arse"
"Right.." Draco muttered, his heart sank as he realised he still hadn't received a proper answer. His yearning for Harry getting stronger
"I know" Harry smirked with a dashing grin, he blew a kiss at him mockingly to receive as smack on the arm "Ow!"
Harry shrugged focusing on his coffee "Who knows? I mean.. I imagine we'd be at each other throats if we were together too long"
Draco rolled his eyes upwards mouthing a 'wow' as a grin appeared on his face. She squealed with excitement "Best I've ever felt... in my entire life"
"You look better" Pansy encouraged, watching as Draco pined over him, she brushed a speck of hair from his eyes and smiled "You're an absolute ten out of ten, darling! You could have any boy in this room if you wanted"
"As you wish" and with that another fast smack came down on Draco's arse, causing a muffled cry as he bit down onto his arm. Harry traced the end of the crop along his skin, teasing him with it before bringing it down across his pale flesh in quick succession.
Draco nodded, taking a slow inhale and looking down at his feet again. His chest tightened as he felt Harry looking into him "Do you really mean it... when you say.. 'you belong to me'?"
Draco sighed. Resigning himself to Harry's probing "I feel ashamed, and before you tell me I shouldn't... I know, alright? But I can't exactly just shut that feeling off. I feel... regret"
He slid quietly though the common room door, hopeful that most of the students would have gone to their dormitories by now, and he was pleased upon entering to see he was right. The room was large with tall ceilings, dimly lit with only the faintest teal glow coming from the lake on the other side of the towering iron-rimmed windows. The fireplace was glowing lazily, a handful of students dotted across the room, some engrossed in books or studies, others too interested in their conversations to even notice when Draco entered.
Malfoy was growing irritated with Harry's smug attitude, snapping back "Look, I don't exactly know what I felt yesterday, alright?" he crossed his arms in frustration "but... I liked it. I...I sort of, maybe... want to feel it again"
Harry stepped closer until him and Draco were face to face, Draco could feel the heat radiating off his body. Harry leant in, whispering to his ear "I'll tell everyone what I did to you last week..."
Harry cocked his eyebrow in surprise and chuckled to himself "I don't think that's the best idea, Malfoy"
Draco woke the following morning in a tired haze. He was still wrapped up with the gorgeous brunette beside him, only a little more ragged after eight hours of sleep. One arm was above his head bent under the pillow, the other splayed across Harry's chest. Their legs wrapped together, skin hot and sticky under the heavy duvet.
"You... m-master" Draco voice wavering slightly, desperate moans escaped his lips, his cock was aching to be touched and every strike of Harry's hand electrified him with shame and humiliation and pleasure
Harry dropped his head back in pleasure as Draco ripped his shirt from his chest and began dragging his tongue across his collarbone
"Fine, I admit at the start I just wanted to get back at you... I enjoyed putting you in your place and taking it out on your through the sex. I never had any intention of getting close to you personally and I'm so sorry that I was so ignorant before. I should've considered your feelings. I should have made an effort to see that you have changed but I chose to ignore it. I'm really am sorry Draco" Harry admitted, feeling disgusting as he spoke
Draco nodded and did exactly as he was told. He placed his hands against the wall and stepped back, exposing his arse for Harry who was eyeing him up like a feast.
Blaise chuckled "Honestly mate... we never really cared for him much. We were just pretending we didn't like him because we thought you hated him. Sure, he's a little annoying at times but if he makes you happy then you don't need to convince us"
Draco moaned again, since he was unable to respond due to, well, his mouth being a little preoccupied
Draco sighed "I hate being weak, but I love it too, in the bedroom... I can't seem to separate the two. I just know deep down you're judging me and laughing at me for the stupid sexual fantasies that I have"
"Good boy" Harry groaned. Their bodies were hot and sweaty and Harry's legs were growing weaker "You're so gorgeous right now, Draco. I'm gonna cum again"
Draco faltered, he was unsure "Well... I never really gave it much thought but then yesterday, when you...well... I didn't exactly dislike it either..."
Harry stroked Draco's cock harder "Look at you... squirming beneath me, totally helpless... I love seeing you tied up and begging for me"
"So... yesterday..." Draco began. Harry was looking smug. "I... I didn't realise you were into... that"
Harry pounced onto him pushing Draco down onto his back, their lips came crashing together, wet and hungry. Harry ran his hands over Draco's arms and settled on his neck, holding him close as he nipped and sucked his lower lip. After several moments he pulled away, both of them breathless "Like that"
Harry went back to sitting and Draco sat up on his elbows, looking up at Harry "You would kiss me in front of all those people?"
"How else am I suppose to praise you? When you accept your punishments so well?" he smirked and Draco felt the heat shoot to his cock. Dominant Harry made him weak
Draco was ready to argue back but closed his mouth at Harry's orders. He pushed off the bed and pulled his jumper off. Harry kept eye contact the entire time, wearing a mischievous smile as he watched Draco strip down to his underwear. Draco stopped, hesitant at exposing himself so plainly
Harry slid his hands down the side of Draco's body until he reached his arse, he squeezed the skin hard between his fingers and simultaneously bit down onto his neck. Harry could feel Draco's throbbing cock aching against his own groin
Draco nodded, finally making eye contact "I can't believe I'm actually saying this but... I really do"
Harry's heart was hammering in his chest at being so impulsive, knowing that any moment now Draco might scream and punch him but it was worth it, worth it just to see the reaction on his face, to watch him squirm beneath him for once
Draco closed his eyes and lulled his head back into the pillows, biting his lip to stifle the moans of Harry's touch.
"Ohhh fuck!" Draco moaned biting down on Harry's shoulder to stifle his cries of pleasure. Harry pushed forward, pressing his own aching cock against the hardness in Draco's trousers. He brought his hand down, groping him through the material causing Draco to gasp at his touch
"You're going to watch yourself get fucked" Harry whispered and Draco stifled another moan. He couldn't move his head as Harry held him up. He slammed back into him harder "Look at you, Slut. Getting fucked by the famous Harry Potter. How degrading for you" Harry smirked as he forced his cock further into Draco's tight little arse
"Well I've been with people, obviously... just... the kink stuff... being dominated" he blushed saying the words out loud "I know I want it... so badly"
Harry let a satisfied smile melt onto his face, he wiped the cum from Draco's back with his finger and held it in front of Draco's mouth "Suck it"
Harry kissed him again urgently and Draco moaned into his lips, sliding his fingers through Harry's hair and grabbing tight
Draco nodded softly, still sniffing back tears. He allowed Harry to rub the cool liquid onto his skin, relaxing as it calmed the stinging sensation.
"And you're fucking hot as well" Harry added, looking serious but melting into a smile "I very much liked what I saw, I always have..."
Draco licked heavily up the shaft and felt Harry arching his back, climaxing fiercely and shooting his load deep into Draco's mouth. He slid his fingers through Draco's hair and gripped down hard, thrusting and jerking through his orgasm "Fuckkk yes... suck my cock you little slut" Harry gasped and cursed, feeling every nerve radiate with pleasure before breaking into a smile feeling the sensation wash over him
Pansy beamed with happiness, squeezing his hand and Draco laughed along with Blaise "honestly the sex is just... mind-blowing"
"I said, suck it" Harry demanded, sliding his cum covered finger into Draco's mouth. His tongue was warm as it swirled around, tasting Harry between his lips.
"No, I'm talking about earlier today, when you we're antagonising me in the corridor, and again yesterday calling me and my friends names in charms class-"
"Yeah, and thoughts of his- ow!" Ron got suddenly caught off by Hermione elbowing him in the ribs to avoid hearing what she knew Ron was about to say. Harry shared a second-long glance with him indicating he had pinned exactly what was going through Harry's head, and Ron smiled back silently
Pansy stroked the hair from his forehead gently "Darling, you need to have a proper talk with him, and get yourself a definite answer"
"Sluts like you don't get pleasure that easily" Harry teased and got back to his feet as Draco whimpered against the wall. He was facing him now "I was far too generous before, letting you cum so quickly" he traced a finger over Draco's parted lips "Allowing you to feel such pleasure when you haven't even earned it"
Harry thrusted harder and more desperately than before, he dropped his head back feeling waves of pleasure approaching as his orgasm teetered on the edge. He suddenly pulled out and climaxed hard, shooting hot cum across Draco's arse and back
Harry's eyes dilated with pure lust as he locked onto Draco's and lowered his lips over the tip of his cock. Draco was teetering on the edge of orgasm already, the teasing alone driving him wild as the sensation of Harry's tongue enveloped his entire existence
"Potter... Potter!" Draco called under his breath, trying to get the attention of the Gryffindor leaving the Potions classroom the following day
He stroked it slowly, peering down towards Draco at his feet, totally naked aside from the collar and cuffs. He tugged his cock harder and positioned it in front of Draco's reddened lips, which was already dripping with salvia from their heated kiss
The entrance to the room was compact and crowded until suddenly the ceilings shot up and the room became ten times bigger. The dark stone walls expanded at the sides, where towering glass windows stood from floor to ceiling, under the depths of the lake which filled the room with an ominous teal glow which shimmered and reflected off every surface.
Draco just nodded again, with a half smile. He laid back down on the bed, resting himself of the mound of pillows behind them and turning his back slightly away from Harry, who joined him
He felt waves of pleasure rising inside him, his cock gripped tight by Draco's tight hole as he fucked him deeper and deeper. Just the sound of Draco moaning beneath him was driving him crazy, he loved hearing the cries of pleasure slipping the blondes lips
Harry continued spanking his arse, the hard leather connecting with his backside in a series of cracks that echoed around the room. Draco's cries grew louder and louder, whimpering softly against his arms as Harry beat him from behind
Harry smacked him again and watched as Draco jerked beneath him, his head buried muffling the cries, his upper back was trembling. Harry brought the paddle down again.
Harry knew he had to tread carefully. Pissed off Malfoy was impossible to talk to and he cringed at how awkward he felt. Why was he suddenly so shy when he'd spent weeks dominating him to pure filth with ease?
"'M s-so c-close, please M-master, fuck me... harder" he moaned out barely able to string his words together
Harry slid his hands from Draco's hips to his back, leaving scratch marks across his pale flesh causing Draco to cry out softly. He moved his fingers around to his chest, caressing his torso, his nipples, sliding his hands up the back of his neck and into his hair, tugging him forcefully up to leave kisses all over his skin
Draco felt as though he'd forgotten how to breathe. One moment he was alone, the next Harry was approaching him, looking at Draco like he was stalking prey, ready to pounce and claim him. He was getting closer every second, pushing through the people around them and Draco realised Harry had no intention of stopping
"Harry, just leave it.." Hermione cut in, reaching for Harry's arm but he shook her off, still closing in on Draco who was now backing away from him
Draco sniffed the tears away, still unable to break eye contact with the floor. He hated being weak in front of people and to him crying in public was mortifying, but it was Blaise, his best friend, who had always stuck by him through every smile and every upset.
"Absolutely" Harry chuckled but his smile dropped seeing that Draco wasn't reciprocating, worried that the uncertainty was filling his mind again "Draco.. what's wrong? you're safe here, remember? You did so well" he held out his hand and felt Draco take it, linking his fingers and squeezing tight
"What are you gonna do, Potter?" Malfoy bit. He was trying to uphold his usual bitterness in front of his friends but his words were shaky, his confidence faltering. He felt transparent, as though everyone around him knew what he really did with Harry
Draco gathered himself, regaining normal breaths and wiping stray tears with the back of his palm. He felt the heaviness of shame and embarrassment knowing he was crying over Harry. He dreaded their reaction
He hated this feeling. He was so used to being in control, being the one to make the demands and dominate, all of a sudden Draco seemed to have the upper hand. The boy who crawled on his knees and begged Harry for more was now calling the shots and he hated it. He was right before, Draco belonged to him and no one else, and this time he really meant it
Hermione pushed herself from the sofa and took a seat beside him on the floor "Unfortunately Harry you'll just have to get used to him being around, I'm sure in time it'll all blow over between you two"
"I've spent my whole life being told I'm above everyone else, that I'm better than others in so many ways.. in here.. I finally get to be vulnerable"
"Hm?" Harry pulled his attention back to him, fearing that his pining for the Slytherin was becoming obvious. How the hell did Neville know?
Blaise thought for a moment then sprung into life "That sixth year Slytherin girl is attractive, you know the one with the black curls..."
"I said.. strip." Harry ordered, and Draco obeyed. Sliding a hand under the waistband of boxers and peeling them off, stepping out and tossing them aside. He stood awkwardly in front of Harry, totally naked, still not used to the sensation of exposure in front of his so-called 'enemy'
"You crashed into the end of my broomstick! You made me fall!" Harry cried. He stormed up to Draco in a rage, Hermione and Ron behind him looking fretful
Draco huffed a laugh and buried himself in his drink trying to stifle the uncertainty ripping through his chest. He felt out of place, as though he was suppose to be having the best time and yet he felt more lonely than ever
"Well, not exactly super chummy but I can't keep navigating between pretending I hate you outside of here and then dropping to my knees whenever you enter the room. It'll be easier if we're just civil all around"
Your lovely comments helped me find the inspiration to keep writing this, even when I feel a little lost or doubtful. I promise this story is going somewhere! Hold out for the next few chapters!
They broke into laughter that lasted several minutes "I take it back, you haven't changed a bit" Harry smirked
Draco's eyes scanned the floor but he couldn't bring them up to the mirror. He felt more cum drip off his chin
Draco looked down, seeing the glimmer of scarlet red and gold appear before his eyes. The tie was pulled tight between Harry's fists.
Harry smiled in awe of him and took the other plate, waving his wand beside him where a pot of coffee appeared too
Harry continued spanking him with the palm of his hand, the sound echoing through the room along with soft cries from Draco. His backside was red and hot and Harry could feel Draco's cock twitching against his thighs
"Oh! Shit! Um.. my bad... still half asleep" Harry uttered, scrambling up the runaway cereal. Ron chuckled as he tucked into his toast
The thought of touching someone else made him cringe, even worse his chest filled with dread at the idea of telling someone else about his submission kink. How he had managed to spill his darkest desires to Potter he had no idea but it had all worked out so naturally, so gorgeously
Harry tried to swallow the tightness in his throat. "Well.. I don't know about you but I think someone spiked the punch" he laughed nervously "Everyone's feeling a little wavy"
The words were stabbing Harry like knives but what hurt him more was he couldn't even deny it. He felt so guilty for starting this
Hermione frowned, turning back to her morning paper, Harry looked awkwardly at Ron who simply shrugged in return. He looked back across the the Slytherin table where Draco met his eyes. He needed to get him alone again.
"You look fucking gorgeous right now, slut" Harry praised, biting his lip as Draco was bound and desperate at his mercy. His own cock was rock hard and he pulled it out of his boxers, stroking the shaft up and down and sliding his thumb over the wet tip
"Brilliant.." he moaned, eyeing himself up with uncertainty for a moment before sliding his hand around his cock and losing himself in thoughts of the Gryffindor once more
"Sure!" Neville turned back to tag along with Seamus and Katie Bell while Harry headed toward the door, noticing that the Slytherins had already left the classroom
He made his way across to the shower block in his towel and threw it over the hook on the wall, turning the water on. As he waited for it to heat up, he heard footsteps from the corner of the quiet room, where he turned his head slightly to see Malfoy striding in, a towel around his waist and nothing more
"Then say no more!" Ron nodded with a grin. He took Hermione's hand and headed through the crowds, pushing past and squeezing through until they reached the top steps that looked down onto the centre of the common room. Ron was still dancing as he walked, and Harry followed behind him, apologising awkwardly to the people that were being hit by his flailing arms.
Harry nodded "I give you full permission to tell everyone my naughty little fetish if I expose yours. But that's not going to happen because you can trust me. I don't think you're weak, Draco. The courage it takes to let yourself be vulnerable, to put your trust in someone, that's not weak at all, that's brave"
Draco pressed his tongue to his teeth to supress the urge to snap, slowly turning his head to meet Harry with the foulest glare. Harry's smile dropped as he saw the bitterness seeping from him
Harry climbed into the bed behind him, placing one hand on Draco's shoulder and gestured him up into a kneeling position. Draco sat back, feeling Harry's torso press against his back, their thighs touching, Harrys erection pressing into the top of Draco's arse
"Would you like me to restrain you tonight, Draco?" Harry asked, stroking up his thigh and along his back as he too positioned himself behind him
Harry stroked his erection fiercely, biting down on his lip. His cock was inches from Draco's mouth and Draco's eyes were fixated on him
Draco faltered, not entirely sure what to say to that compliment. He thought Harry was attractive too, he'd never thought about it before, but recent circumstances had made Draco see Harry in a totally new light
"I wasn't crying" he lied "It was just hurting ok?" Draco snapped, pulling his hand away from Harry's
He could feel his cock throbbing already, and Harry had barely even started yet. Their arms were around one another locked together, Harry pushing his cock against Draco's groin still in his boxers. Draco slid his hands down Harry's back and slipped them under the waistband of his underwear, stroking and groping his pert arse
There was a long silence while Draco considered all of their points. His gaze did always drift to Potter during classes, his daydreams filled with thoughts of the gorgeous brunette. The subtle glances across at him in the great hall, the distractions he unknowingly caused during quidditch games, the way even during their petty arguments among friends Draco never really seemed  angry at him, it was difficult to look that way considering he really just wanted to kiss him hard on the lips instead
"Really boring this year" Ron added in the most sarcastic tone "Nothing interesting happening at all...."
"Have you earned that pleasure?" Harry asked, still thrusting inside him, but a little slower now, growing tired
"I don't think this is a mistake, Draco" Harry spoke "And if you feel it is then Ill be very sad to see you leave" Harry pursed his lips, distracting himself with his food. He was beginning to feel more emotions than he intended
It was a struggle, but Draco met his eyes as Harry stood over him, filled with hot shame and arousal
"Since when do you go to the library??" Ron asked suddenly confused. Harry rarely stepped foot in that place, often coming up with excuses to practice quidditch or meet friends when he should have been studying
Harry was on the brink of climaxing again, the sight of Draco Malfoy, bent over naked and exposed with a spanked arse, taking Harry's throbbing cock while gagged and bound, drove him totally wild to the edge of orgasm
He slowly folded up his parchment, tucking it into his book and placing his work into his bag, Neville was beside him doing the same
"No Hufflepuff slander here, please Draco!" Blaise chimed in, lost in the music and already half tipsy "I won't tolerate Puffle hate" he laughed and Draco shook his head with a grin, downing the rest of his spiked punch to mask the growing ache in his chest
Harry admired that. He stroked his hand across Draco's back and caressed his lower half softly. He then waved his wand and watched as the implements appeared beside him; a crop, a leather paddle and a small flogger
"I know" Harry rested his forehead against Draco's temple, his arm around his back holding him tight "I'm sorry, I thought you wanted this"
"Why is always you that has the forbidden stash hidden in your room? I swear Snape will search this place one day and you'll be expelled immediately" Draco pointed out, looking half concerned for Pansy's frequent smuggling of illicit items, and half intrigued by the mysterious concoction
The boy leant in and whispered something in Draco's ear, causing Draco to smile back enticingly. Harry felt himself seethe with jealousy, he could barely peel his eyes away
Harry closed his book slowly and placed it to once side, he climbed off the bed and made his way across to Draco who was following his every move. He knelt down and met his eyes with a smile, before casting a cleaning spell for him. Draco shivered at the sensation but relaxed into it.
Harry continued striking for over twenty minutes before trailing the end of the crop up Draco's back and placing it down beside him. He leant in close behind, and Draco could feel the hot breath in his ear
Draco gasped and tugged against Harry's strong grip but with little success, he was held in place sending waves of pleasure straight to his already throbbing erection
Within seconds Draco had exploded. His cries and moans of pleasure filled the room and Harry watched as he climaxed hard, shooting cum all over his stomach and thighs. It dripped off of him slowly as he regained himself, reality of his state sinking in
"Or... we could stay under the covers all day?" Harry added, a look of mischief glazing his face. He nuzzled into Draco's neck and planted more kisses
You know when you have some serious doubts about your writing and the self confidence totally drops? - yeah that's how I've been feeling all week. But alas! I'm still here for the few of you do read and leave me lovely comments x
How could he admit that he was falling for Draco Malfoy. Too tainted by the past to realise that he was a different person now. The boy standing before him was not the one who had hurt him in the past
"You did so well, Draco" Harry whispered, stroking a finger along his cheek  "You don't need to feel ashamed"
Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair, gripping it and yanking his head up to face him, Draco gasped at the sudden movement but Harry caught him off guard with a forceful kiss on the lips, biting, sucking and moaning into him as he tugged on his hair tightly. Harry sucked his lower lip, then dragged his tongue across Draco's cheek and up to his earlobe, nuzzling into his neck
