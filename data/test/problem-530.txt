“And in a wizarding lifetime that can be 150-200, 18 years isn’t as it is with Muggles,” Severus noted. “Would you rather not know? Because Ed knew this was going to happen and kept it a secret for 10 years.”
“And what is this?” first, his sleepy mind panicked, thinking they were found again, but they both were suspiciously smiling. “What are you two up to?”
For this, Ron, who was up to hold Harry back just got into a fighting position too. Hermione and Fayre’s eyes met, both worried.
He cared about Severus too much to pursue a relationship with Potter, yet when Harry was hurting, it was also just as upsetting to him as if Severus was.
Rimming Harry next was what Draco never truly enjoyed doing with anybody else, but only hearing the incoherent noises Harry made it worth it.
Harry thought how 10-12 hours of research every day didn’t work, sometimes even getting help from Hermione or Narcissa too, then what will, but kept that to himself.
“Then we’ll wait a couple of days. I’m not risking facing Tobias and her with you hurt,” Harry kissed Draco, but only softly, as if a simple kiss could also break him until full recovery.
Severus would survive the trip, taken out of his own time. And who would care for him, you and the youngest Weasley? Because I would be in jail as a former servant of the Dark Lord, in case you’ve forgotten.”
“As long as you know it’s only for precaution,” Draco said, giving Harry a warning look. “Not meaning that we would—“
“Let me guess. A hot gay wizard who isn’t afraid to speak his mind,” Draco could only imagine a pure Gryffindor character affecting Potter like this, and the expression on Harry’s face told him he was right. “With a great arse, also?”
Anger like provoking a fight Harry had no chance to win was a distraction. A way to convince himself he didn’t feel anything else. No grief, no doubt, no panic.
“Harry,” Matt’s voice stopped him before he could run away. “Have you tried the freshly baked bread today? Clara and I just got some.”
But little Snape was sitting on an elegant chair that was too big for him and seemed just as troubled as in his memories when James Potter was taunting him in front of everyone.
Potter first froze, then he stumbled from Lucius, and with a deranged look and complete disorder of words he started for the door.
But that was when the troubles also started. Severus barely ate, and almost threw a tantrum when Draco tried to tell him to at least finish the tiny amount he already had on his plate. Severus, who was otherwise reserved, quiet and never disobeyed anything Draco said before.
Before, even if he didn’t know he’d succeed, always had clear objectives. Responsibilities too important to ignore. Expectations, people’s eyes following him.
He could go from flirting to a grieving father in a blink so well, Harry had his suspicions he was completely honest.
Not that it helped when Ginny decided to break up with him. All the country knew the next day, courtesy of some magical wiretapping device, much to both his and Ginny’s shame.
Fair to say, he wasn’t looking for any connection, but it also has been more than 4 years now that he barely interacted with anybody else but Draco, so.
First, he could establish that they had 3 regular meals every day, even Potter joining them, so Severus finally didn’t have any skipped meals anymore.
Fayre did wake up after a while and Hermione and Harry let her go, trying to talk to her, but she wouldn’t listen and kept asking when she can go. So they let her, and after Harry made sure both Hermione and Ron was going to be alright, he followed her.
“Fayre, I apologize. I messed up. I should have never told Harry your secret and should have trusted you more. We are friends—”
“I’m not saying they are bad, hell, I’m almost one of them. But I’d prefer it if she met some other magicals before going to school. With Muggles, I constantly have to remind her to keep her magic hidden. Merlin sees my soul, I can’t even Obliviate a group of children if she loses control.”
Unfortunately, as amateurish as Potter was with the appropriate charms, he more than made up for it with his enthusiasm, and if anything, it was the best sex Draco had in his entire life.
“But maybe I could come and visit you in Hogwarts, I think I’d feel much better there,” Lucas went on.
“Carlos apologizes, and wants you to continue your dinner, on his tab, of course,” the wizard said, pulling out a calendar. “And if possible, reschedule another occasion he won’t be disturbed like this.”
“Yes, we just came here from his place,” Weasley uncharacteristically didn’t sneer when he talked to Fayre, which was genuinely surprising. “This madman was also the one to try to kill me, for he was trying to anger Harry so much that he’d go after him upset, an easy target.”
Hermione tried to get their wands back but Fayre didn’t let her. Harry tried to nonverbally knock Fayre unconscious, and later some heavier dark spells, but Fayre had a strong magical shield pulled up, and nothing was working.
Lucius bit his lip thinking. He had to be careful. Potter was the only connection to Draco he now possessed. He wouldn’t want to go too far with this, no matter how pleasantly amusing it proved to be. Also, he was right, it was something personal…
shows up telling me he would offer me and Severus sanctuary from my own husband, and the next morning my son disappears when I refuse?”
“Fayre, don’t go—” he tried, but she just snorted without a response, and that made him even feel worse.
“Think about what you’re doing, young Prince,” Draco told Severus later when he was still looking back and forth from the exuberant decorations and Draco’s dress. “You’re asking a humble servant to join our table.”
“I’m doing it,” Harry didn’t understand what the women were talking about, but the time was running out. “I’m treating him for Pvendriache.”
Harry frowned. Maybe he should move if the situation made him this awkward, but he really considered that place his home, the one he got from Sirius. Plus, with his research for Draco, where would he find the time to move?
Their plan was risky at best, Harry didn’t agree with it at all, but Draco insisted they have to earn Eileen’s trust, and the only way to do that is to show some vulnerability.
“When you took Severus, I promised Tobias never to do magic again, and we decided to live completely as Muggles,” Eileen explained. “But then, I got pregnant, and everything has changed. In ancient China, they sometimes bound important heirs to dragons for longer life, and in Japan, sometimes they sealed away powers of a magical creature they deemed too dangerous into something or somebody else. So I assumed that if someone had a great magical resistance, they can take on magic, even if they weren’t magical before. I wasn’t sure it would work, but as you’ve seen…”
Yet, for some of the new scenes, he barely could stand, which meant that his magical core was depleting faster than Fayre’s for he had to maintain magic to stay while Fayre’s magic who was just purely trapped.
Harry didn’t answer but seemed intent on not starting a wand fight in the middle of Mungo, which meant as long as the criminal was talking, he didn’t choose to make the first curse.
“It’s a tree, silly!” it was Edwin, who to everyone's surprise, told Draco, not even requiring Severus to translate.
Draco only dropped his guard for a second hearing that and understanding what it meant, but it was enough for two nasty curses to hit him on the back as well, and by then Eileen was dead in his arms.
Edwin was an important person. He didn’t have time for all these dates, and if it would have been his Dads or brother setting him up, he would have sent them to hell a long time ago.
Potter had emerged from sleep even more steamy then usual, with his baggy clothes big enough around him to show some skin, his hair naturally unruly, and still sleepy-eyed but looking years younger without his glasses.
rather than wondering about yet another behavior Potter displayed Draco could never comprehend, Draco decided he should really use the tub in their room.
And as for things finally looking up: working on the question for months back in England, and spending more than half a year on it here as well, Harry couldn’t figure how the crystal exactly was crafted, but read enough to attempt Time-travel another way.
She was more beautiful than her. Potter would never choose the ex-Draco-Malfoy over a beauty, even if she was a muggle. Potter wasn’t like Lucius where blood mattered that much.
I hereby officially swear it is going to be a happy ending, and I'll make everything alright, I just have to have the darkest moment before the dawn if you will.
At least Severus wasn’t shy anymore, and curiously, all the Muggle/seemingly pointless activities he had with Harry just helped him learn magic faster.
However, little did he know that surviving the war was not the end of his torture. He was still the boy who lived, and now he lived twice.
Their room shared a door a single room which Severus happily took, leaving Draco and Harry with one bed once again.
“You know what I mean. The only reason I haven’t interfered picking out your clothes over the years because I’m trying to be less controlling and I don’t want Matt to lust after you even more. Or anyone in MACUSA.”
“I have lived in a cupboard for ten years, I think it should be perfectly fine,” Harry said, making Draco stare, so he quickly added. “But I don’t know what could I do.”
“You should do… what?!” Hermione asked her eyes as big as plates. “Why on Hogwart’s Owlery would you—”
Finally, the hidden compartment they were looking for was still there, and Eileen was just about to start the spell when they got ambushed.
“I need the library of this one,” the woman made a face. “Plus this one has been always my favorite.”
Thank you all for reading, hopefully after this chapter, we'll rescue young Severus pretty soon. XOXO
Draco Malfoy was pardoned somehow - mainly Hermione’s work behind the scenes, Harry thought - and wasn’t put in jail but then he visited Lucius in prison and told his father that he was gay.
And, plastered him to the closest wall, and kissed Draco with such an overwhelming force that for a second the blond even forgot who they were and what they were doing.
“Well, there you go, it’s normal to have witches throw themselves at the great Harry Potter, even at this time, on another continent, it seems.”
He originally planned to set up a Potions laboratory letting Severus choose a Cauldron and simple ingredients for himself, but until Draco hadn’t gained his trust a little bit better so that he could support Severus to ease into the crowded, noisy street of Diagon Alley, Draco decided to wait.
“Legilimency. They have a link. Mostly by Severus’ effort, but I also think Edwin needs to let himself be read, and it happens when he talks, even if it’s not any spoken language we’d understand.”
He didn’t plan to have high expenses, and he also had some money in his pocket that could cover a few weeks of rent. And if he worked, at least he’d get his mind off of memories, keeping busy.
True, since they officially adopted Severus, rescued Edwin, and Eileen also got a job from Jack, their life had become a bit more chaotic.
“An established wizarding family before their last member married your great-grandfather. We could re-establish it as a dynasty, claiming you were a distant and lost relative of Fleamont Potter, because even if they tested his magic - as the only living descendant - they’d find you two are truly related,” Draco finished his thought, surprising Harry. “Seriously, Potter, you imagine Purebloods care about the family name so much, but we don’t learn their histories? I could even name all the great-grandparents of the Weasleys, I just rather not.”
“I do, and I’m telling you—!” Harry felt so frustrated because they were wasting time, and all he could think of was losing his best friend because of Fayre.
“Such a nag,” Harry muttered, but it sounded more endearing than insulting and he picked Draco up only to drop him on his own sheets, clearly able to follow commands if he wanted to.
Malfoy wasn't listening, just started an incantation in a language Harry had never heard, holding up a large crystal that was charcoal black in one minute, then started to glow red.
"It's not like I would turn you down if you'd be really offering. I like to surround myself with simple people, take Crabbe and Goyle for instance."
Based on the descriptions, he expected hell and torture to be going on in Fayre’s mind, on a loop, one scenario worse than the other.
“I’m… Harry,” Harry deliberately omitted his last name, trying not to stare at the witch. Now that she said who she was, he could see some likeness to a certain Professor.
Only, he couldn’t stand to see Severus get hurt, even if it put them all in jeopardy now. Maybe Lucius was right all along, calling Draco too soft to be a proper wizard. And maybe the future was immutable, after all.
“And I could treat you like shit, because it annoys me how perfect you are,” Draco laughed. Ironically, hearing how Potter felt about all this was making him impossibly protective. Which meant they couldn’t do it, after all.
“A manticore? Are you fucking kidding me?” Fayre swore, which only made Harry laugh, although he didn’t feel quite right for laughing. “I’d rather be dead then let the world know I have a Patronus that’s third part lion.”
“Obviously! Oh my God, Ron, sometimes I wonder if you’re this oblivious for real!” Hermione hit him, not even gently.
Wizarding media was all over him. Hermione working at the ministry made him appear on all sorts of functions he didn’t want to go.
That was an answer Harry didn’t fully count on and kinda got shocked from imagining Draco with older men. Fayre did see the pity or shock in Harry’s eyes, so she just told him.
“As much as I loved being locked up here with you, maybe we could ask the elves to move your things to my bedroom? I have a bigger bed that could be more comfortable for both of us. Also a nicer tub.”
“No, we weren’t.” Hermione might have been cold being Ginny’s close friend, but Fayre didn’t seem to mind.
“I have met someone,” he finally decided to talk with Draco. If he was going to do this, he wanted to do it right, as honest as Matt could be.
In the morning, he only intended to kiss Draco as a way to say hello, but one thing led to another, and they barely made it to breakfast in time.
“I would love to see him try. And get locked up by the Muggles for lunacy,” Harry told her. “Or having all three of us and the elves fight him. He might be immune to magic, but I’m thinking he’d still feel it if I levitate a house over his head, and drop it on him.”
attracted to me?” Draco blinked, because it could have been a confession, had it not come from Potter, and with such an angry tone.
“I hate you,” was all that Fayre said, yet she closed her eyes, concentrating. She didn’t have a wand here, so she had to use wandless magic, which should have made the encantation harder.
“And miss this?” Draco gestured at Edwin collecting some fallen leaves to add to the cauldron. “But you could bring us a blanket, and tell me about your day while I lay down a bit.”
“If you go on and kiss random Malfoys, the next one better be me, Potter.” Damn, that sounded territorial. Kinda hot.
Given that it was dangerous transforming any human body parts, and strictly forbidden because it could easily go wrong, he seemed almost too relaxed about it.
“I think it’s your success,” it was true. Draco spent so much time with Edwin, and Edwin also was the calmest when Draco took care of him.
Although, if sharing was a weakness, Potter just became a target himself. Maybe Draco could use it to his advantage, but how?
Only, the kid didn’t seem to ask questions about magic, and magical customs, but sometimes questions that Draco didn’t find so easy to answer.
Harry knew that he couldn’t possibly tell the difference between the two, and if he chose one, at least Ron would have 50% chance, but only if he acted fast. So he raised his wand and was about to begin an incantation when to his surprise, Fayre did the exact same.
“Aye aye Captain, have mercy on us, and let us dock this ship!” Harry tried to ask Edwin, but only got the Captain’s knee in his ribs as the kid wiggled around. “We’ve been valiantly sailing for so long now, and I also cannot breathe!”
“Ah, so you’re with him this time, why am I not surprised?” she asked without even saying hello. “Well then, it only means you also have to go.”
She seemed almost ready to curse Harry out of the house, but then she dove into his mind again, with a speed that left Harry wincing.
Yes, she did have a huge crush on Potter probably ever since she didn’t even know what that meant, only felt it. And Potter cursing her, almost taking her life, then Potter saving her life (just to surprise her more because of the Sectumsempra first) didn’t help her head forget that either.
She deduced this because Potter used SleekEasy on his hair which he never did, and she was around researching how to separate them in the mornings, so she was around.
It made Harry spend more time with Edwin as well to help, just as Eileen played with Edwin when she was home (giving Draco a bit of rest), but they hadn’t considered how Severus must have felt about it.
“What the hell did you do?!” Malfoy yelled when Harry opened his eyes, and they were definitely not in the Shrieking Shack anymore, and Harry’s locator spells somehow didn’t work, when he wanted to check where they moved.
“Severus, it’s good to see you.” They both were alive still, and seemingly well, so it was a future that was already better.
Promise me you'll read both together, the second is cuter? XD Anyway, hope you guys will like it! XOXO
I felt like helping Draco out a little in their relationship, and what better way to do it in this fic than across time?
“Merlin, not everything’s about you!” Fayre however said. “I changed my form because I have to go to work and the Mungo would never employ a former Death Eather on their premises.”
“That sounds oddly specific,” Potter said, but he with a teasing smile. “And I could always reappear to be your 36-year-younger husband in the future once again so they’d just have shut up.”
Then, Fayre was finished with the spell, which took so much effort on her side that she collapsed, leaving Harry and Hermione to get back their wands, and also get Fayre’s, but for Ron, it could have been already too late.
“Shut up, would you?” Ed gave Severus a warning look. “My life is quite perfect as it is, thank you very much!”
There it was, a fully formed Patronus right before their eyes. It was a magical creature alright, which meant Harry was right. It might be why Draco Malfoy was incapable of producing it before.
“I know, you care for him just as much as I do. Don’t worry about him for now though, just do what you need to do.”
realize I want to do nothing with your father, don’t you?” Harry asked, for all he did receive was a look from Fayre. “And I can’t take you from here.”
“Aurors?” Draco grabbed his wand. He didn’t think the Ministry had a way of telling whether they Time-travelled with the artifact or not, but it was possible that some Unspeakables maybe could.
Took them both half a minute to calm down while Malfoy did charm some clothes on himself, and Harry looked the other way, dead motionless in the bed still.
“Now, now, should I leave you alone with your fantasies?” Fayre said, and Harry smiled, but admitted.
The little girl looked at him and laughed. He had to wait for her to finish with the unevenly breathed laughs and that was when she told him.
“See, that’s the reaction I wanted to avoid,” Edwin told him, and then they were too busy dealing with politics, so Severus had a little time to calm.
Therefore, I tried to write-write this with the tricks of a writer(?) not as a fan, but I dunno whether it worked out for the better or worse TBH... Still, it was a great challenge for me, I feel like I learned a lot from it! ^^
“Even if I have my way with you every night that you can’t even stand the next day, not promising anything just that I’d use you?” he leaned a bit closer, a bit even surprised by himself.
“No, it’s not!” Severus insisted. “Draco is always with Edwin, saying I can read on my own, but Edwin can’t, and you’re so busy, and mom is always at work, and when not, she invites stupid Clara over…”
“No,” Ed admitted. Even if they were overheard, that in itself wasn’t a big deal, not until he was pushed for details of his past and (non-existent) present dates.
“And if I order you to answer me for real?” the blond asked, and when Potter didn’t answer, figured he’d pushed it too far. He was about to get off from Harry when the other wizard grabbed him.
“He still had to grow up way too early, fearing how his parents’ relationship went because if it went poorly, he’d be punished. And although he’s doing well academically, he doesn’t have a single friend, even if it’s because of the constant moving around. And he was killed… way too early considering how wizarding lifetimes tend to be much longer. And the Goblins might have weakened Voldemort, but finally, we created another Dark Lord who was even more powerful.”
“We shouldn’t ruin years of self-restraint,” he told Draco, but his pupils were blown, and he conveniently forgot to mention they’d have to do something big to get out.
“What made you an expert?” Harry asked and Fayre was just about to step up to Ron, ignoring Harry, and probably performing an anti-Curse without even debating it longer, but Hermione stepped between her and Ron’s body.
However, Draco and Severus should discuss that with each other. Just as Harry would then later also talk with Malfoy, advising him to take some breaks with Severus, but not with the kid present.
Harry didn’t want Draco to see if by any chance Ed still was evil in the future, so rather he decided to go and see and apologize only later.
He just gave himself a minute to adjust - for he never did actually Apparate from a laying down position, it was sort of weird - when unfortunately the certain blond woke up, and the first thing he did was noticing Harry and being vocal about it.
Harry, who feared flying curses and yelling coming in to talk with Malfoy thought he should accept his luck and quickly leave, before Draco’s understanding turns.
“No, no, my treat. I would like Harry to consider the job I just offered him, so maybe you could send him in tomorrow morning for an interview?” he patted Draco’s back, and even winked at Severus, turning to leave.
It took him 15 attempts and a lot of blood-loss, combining 4 spells (out of which 2 were written in a language that weren’t even spoken anymore) until he got a definite result.
“Oh, you forget,” Harry told Hermione. “I still have a charming date with Lucius Malfoy in the Azkaban telling him that his son now a woman. Looking
“Draco Malfoy is everywhere around here! Can’t go two steps without meeting another one! But as for Fayre… that’s my name, it’s real pretty, that’s why I chose it for myself!”
“Careful, he might hear you saying that,” Harry warned Fayre. “I think despite him being in jail he still knows what people say about his hair behind his back.”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy,” Eileen said, truly standing there with her husband, looking almost cheerful which was unlike her. “This is my husband, Tobias Snape.”
Harry was better directing Mindy what to cook for Severus, while Draco always took better care of telling Mindy what to have for dessert.
Still, it was rather something he wouldn’t to completely alone, telling nobody where he went, so he recruited Eileen to help, who didn’t seem happy about it.
A deeply buried Malfoy part of Draco wanted to own Harry in every way he could before he’d given up on him, just because they couldn’t.
Only to almost curse a stranger in the kitchen to pieces until he registered that the stranger wasn’t dressed, and most probably Ed’s wards let him though because they had spent a night together.
“No. But we walked into this trap willingly, so at least you should see the reason in Draco’s head for yourself,” Harry carefully tried. If only Draco was aware of what was happening, he was a much better negotiator than Harry, but until Eileen released him, Harry didn’t want to risk hurting Draco by tearing him away from her by force.
“Actually, Draco is now a Black from Narcissa’s side,” Hermione eyed the body of the witch on the floor wearily. “I wasn’t going to tell you, but—”
Even Draco had a couple of interesting discussions regarding magic, an unexpected plus because he didn’t think he’d find such a highly educated group of wizards and witches in the past.
“Yet you’re the one who would treat him fairly. I can sense these things. Your partner might mean well and care for Severus deeply, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't pamper my son or could keep his cool if Severus was in danger, like he couldn't when I first met him. So I want to know how involved you two are, and please don’t insult me by lying.”
“It’s been merely a misunderstanding,” a thug seemingly told Draco, while he was clearly provoking Potter for a fistfight, if not a duel.
In exchange to get out before Eileen could show up again, they needed to do this. And they both knew it.
“I have memories that were given to me by your son in the future,” Harry looked directly in her eyes and hoping she can read it without little Severus hearing.
Harry didn’t care. He knew the risks coming in. Plus, if he shouldn’t be here, maybe there is something he can change and save Fayre’s life, right? Him being unexcepted here was a good sign, or so he wanted to tell himself.
“Of course,” Harry said, but by the time he could have kissed Draco, the blond got up to change his clothes.
They didn’t even notice how the locked door stayed closed, but the spells keeping it locked gave out once they were finished.
So he walked up to her without mental shields, hoping if she started looking into his head, she’ll see the grim future, and her future self, and maybe will let them talk.
“Since you shouldn’t be here, I figured I should take you to one where there is a version of you as well,” the girl told him, examining the scene. “There are more where you are, so we can visit all of them.”
“What the Chamber of the Secrets actually are you doing?” Fayre asked, and Harry wondered if she knew that the chamber actually existed. She was from France, after all, she might not have heard yet.
“The spell didn’t work for me, I’m not sure why,” he told the blond, who couldn’t help but hug Potter tightly, just to sense he was warm, alive, and well.
“Dressing well is not a crime, even if the others around you think so. But maybe I shouldn’t let you, both wizards and witches would just throw themselves at you, only by seeing your appearance.”
During the next day, Eileen would appear in the MACUSA building with Aurors, telling officials her son was abducted. Claiming she knew he was taken to the US. Demanding papers for the English Aurors with her to investigate the case.
“Potter, seriously, I like being with men, you don’t have to pity me so much,” the girl sitting next to him, however, realized where his thoughts were going.
What if their domestic troubles had only started later, as Tobias has lost his job and his drinking got worse? But that theory was soon overturned.
Only, about half-way to their “date”, he had received an urgent Patronus, and his secretary sat down across the table to Ed.
Of course, it would be Fayre! He instinctively had to know. She was never forward with her feelings or in situations where she could be hurt.
“I wasn’t just attempting it, Potter, you idiot, I was almost done with the ritual, but you couldn’t help yourself, and now we’re--“
“Dad is well, and you’re still together, but he said he didn’t want you to see this old version of him just yet,” Severus supplied. “I… I am also married, so you have 3 grandkids, and Ed has more of an academic career.”
Maybe because if Potter gave his life to get Draco out, he didn’t want to get caught by the people hunting him, honoring his sacrifice too much?
“Where am I?” he asked, though he remembered, quite clearly where he intended to go, and knowing where he was but it could not have been the real garden of the Manor, could it?
Harry performed a binding spell on the unconscious Fayre so that she won’t be able to move without him letting her, and turned to Hermione, who has been checking on Ron.
And lastly, he could help and meet other magicals, which was great fun - although, there was a witch who was
But also notice, how he's become more honest with Harry? So even if I helped him, he also helps himself in a sense. (Just to have some character-development for you guys XD)
“Oh, look at who is mentioning hygiene,” Potter just spat back without thinking. “Do they let you shower in this place at all?”
“Generally I'm okay dealing with whatever shit life has thrown me into,” he told Draco, now not even Occluding the slightest, so he was an open book to read, and Draco could read that he wasn’t lying. “But sometimes it would be just so helpful to surrender and not think, not… decide about anything, just… letting go of being Harry Potter, who is supposed to lead the magical society to victory and not be treated as someone special.”
“All these memories, Fayre. You worth more than these, why don’t you realize? Getting through them is not making them right in your mind but moving forward.”
Since the war ended, however, things have changed. Draco was right about that. Purely Slytherin and pureblood ways were frowned upon since so many of them belonged to Voldemort’s side.
“I thought you weren’t a Malfoy anymore,” Harry muttered, but his attention was back to Draco and how attractive he was, even as a male. Had Harry been a girl, he would have been over Draco for sure.
“Don’t worry, Harry,” she told him. “I’m sure he’s just hiding. Assholes tend to be Merlinly lucky, after all.”
“I just wish he would be a couple of years older already, I’m too old for this,” Draco muttered into his pillow and was asleep even before Harry could laugh at the “old” part.
“I’m not,” Harry immediately said, although, he couldn’t let Severus put them in the same danger again. “I trust you. But you should also trust us with the matters that only concern us.”
“And do what exactly, Granger?” Fayre laughed, but somehow they all felt it wasn’t connected to any real positive emotion. “Get up every morning in Potter’s bed knowing that he knows—”
There. He just said it, and the world didn’t crash and burn into pieces like a Phoenix, despite how he felt saying it. And if anything, Potter seemed to stare back quietly at him, definitely not yelling now.
& I wrote "Harry" only in a couple of places, but that was intentional. Malfoy sometimes does drop his act and thinks about Harry just as "Harry", but not often (just yet).
And very soon, it was possibly Edwin who thought it would be fun to levitate the blanket under them, so Harry just found himself in the middle of the blanket with everyone on the top of him, since their combined weight wasn’t evenly distributed for the flight.
“Break my rules, and as a punishment, I’d hex you,” if Harry wanted to surrender control completely, Draco had to make sure he
Severus looked at his mother for permission, but his stomach gave a large growl. And not even Malfoy could insist to take Severus out somewhere nice, Harry just knew it.
“Then can I ask you to do it for me?” Harry wondered. “And I’m sure Draco would be very proud of you also if you spent a little time with Edwin as well.”
Draco had to scold his features not to show how glad he was to hear that. Maybe Potter was right, and Eileen would trust him with Severus after all, if it was a gradual process, and he just had to be patient.
“What?! You are to obey us first, not a seven-year-old child!” Malfoy yelled at the elf, trying to get him with magic, but was unsuccessful. “I should have got rid of you when we first moved to a Muggle area!”
“Admit it. You miss them dearly already, and it’s too quiet, and you don’t have Ed now to teach, so you don’t even have the motivation to get breakfast,” Harry sat down, making the blond wizard only nod.
It was her old wand, eventually making it the Elder Wand Harry was holding. The Trio must have gone to Dumbledore’s grave first to get it before they came here.
“Yes, but we can’t,” Draco stopped him. “Even if we succeeded, we would risk Severus being taken from us in the meanwhile. Possibly for years! If at least the kid was born, we might be able to arrange it more quickly, but at this moment there is nothing we can do. And Eileen knows we're Time-travellers and won't hesitate to use it against us either.”
The right colors accenting each other and his eyes every move they made, and his messier hair went good with the more pedant style of clothes no question.
“If I find a snail on me next, I’m not going to be happy,” Draco said, making Harry traitorously laugh, while Severus told them.
“Actually, I was thinking more like if Lucas proves to be not as good for Ed as you and Severus would like to think he is, in the next 20 years, you’d owe me something big.”
“Drop your shields, and let me have your wand,” Eileen warned Harry. “Or do you want me to hurt him? I’m in his mind deep enough to do anything.”
He wasn't expecting a reply, but Draco must have been high on some regeneration potion ingredient because Harry heard him say.
“So, you just only had sex? Well, I must congratulate you, although, judging by your reaction, she wasn’t that pretty the next morning as she seemed befor—”
“What are they doing?” Harry stepped out into their garden one evening, with Draco sitting on the terrace, sipping a cup of tea, watching the kids.
“I was cold, and it’s not like I have any illusions how deep our animosity goes, so I decided to sleep here,” Harry gave him a look, and Draco couldn’t help but let him stay.
“Noone should wear the clothes you do! It’s not fashionable in Europe, nor America. Not even in the midst of Muggles.”
Maybe not everything they said was up-to-date for Draco, but their curious mindset and willingness to study magic made them a pleasant company.
“Well, try harder! He couldn’t just disappear! It’s been two months! I’m starting to think you’re just incapable—”
And he wasn’t attempting to travel forward for now, but back at first, experimenting only with 24 hours difference.
It got especially scary for a minute when Harry also got a haircut - it was a tad bit harder for Draco to convince him about a new style given Harry’s experiences with Aunt Petunia and the nightmare when she was paired with scissors.
Especially when rather than staying up late in the Library, he was reading the books in bed, and from time to time, Draco joined him, giving him ideas by discussing the details with him, challenging him to think differently.
“When did being rivals with anyone stopped me from sleeping with them?” Draco shrugged, carrying on with the joke.
“Just so you know, multiple people told me that! Usually older wizards because they were the ones who saw me naked, not my father!”
Draco would have told her he wasn’t about to, not without her and Severus, when Tobias took another step and grabbed him by the throat, raising him off the ground.
Trying to shake these thoughts, he finished the bath quickly and waited, but Potter hadn’t returned. By the time Draco went downstairs, looking for him, to his surprise, Potter was making a scene.
Even though it was tempting because so many of you read it (which made me really happy!!!), so I'm extremely grateful for all of you. I appreciate all of the many-many positive kudos and comments as well, you guys are so supportive! <3
Indeed, along the years, there were plenty of times when their opinions not only weren’t the same, but the exact opposite, and it wasn’t always easy navigating those waters.
“Maybe,” Harry considered, but only if Draco did the same. “But regarding my attire to match my new title?”
It was disgusting to kiss someone like Potter, but Merlin if it wasn’t worth it. This was what it meant to be a Malfoy and do
“Eileen with her husband, hand in hand,” Harry announced. “Since you gave her permission for the wards, she could just walk in with him. It’s only lucky for us Tobias probably can’t be Side-Alonged, so I saw them from a distance before Severus would notice.”
“I would say I’d come with you, but I have no desire to see any of the future,” she said. “Maybe you could ask Matt…”
“You thought you could change the past, but you only replaced some players, the overall history stayed the same. My second son’s name is Edwin.”
“So, I hope you can muster up a breakfast as an apology before I need to leave for work,” Harry didn’t pay attention for only a bit, and now Fayre was standing in front of him.
I did give Fayre/Draco a Patronus despite what Rowling stated that he can never have one. I mean I just don't care, and the poor thing deserves it - that's my opinion.
“You know what, I do. I admire him for being blond, an asshole and filthy rich,” he said, making Fayre laugh.
Harry wanted to tell Malfoy he won’t take any money from him if he didn’t work for it at least, but Severus got so excited hearing they’d spend some time together he didn’t want to revert to their usual banter in front of the child.
That’s why she wouldn’t be missing from our past, but if you send her here, we could keep an eye on her, and she could maybe start a new life. See her grandkids, and how well I’m doing…”
Which was when Draco decided to join in, trying to curse the hell out of the malicious meathead attacking Harry, until the owner of the inn didn’t appear to break up the fight. But luckily not before Draco himself hit the goon with a nasty hex as some payback at least.
“WAIT, you CAN’T!” Malfoy even stopped cursing him at that second, putting his wand to its holster, holding his empty hands up. “I’ll tell you everything you want to know, and you can verify if I’m telling the truth, but we’ll need the contents of that bag badly.”
“I still want you to see a couple of others, so you should. Or, I can always take care of stripping you,” Draco suggested, kissing into Harry’s neck.
Although, the next morning at breakfast, their conversation was the most amiable they have ever had, and Potter seemed keen on keeping the promise of not bringing up their activities of the previous night in any way.
“Why not prove Lucius and every asshole out there wrong who said you’d never amount to anything and come back to life and be so happy they cry themselves to sleep every night?” Harry tried.
He was researching searching-spells, performing them all in look for Draco. He was also researching Grimmauld Place’s old magic, trying to have Fayre in the house, but not in his bed every morning.
“See, that’s the problem with Griffindors. Slytherins hate your ass and everybody is out there for themselves, but at least they have the decency not to lie about that,” he told Harry. “You and Granger deserve each other and Weasley really, Potter. You’re all the same!”
And he was right, Eileen might have calmed down, but just a couple of minutes ago she emphasized how much she loved Tobias, and Harry was rambling on about viciously hurting him.
“If it’s once a month, yes,” Draco told him with a fake-serious face, but then he chuckled. “Do you even think for one minute I’d be offering to sleep with you and still expecting that we wouldn’t do anything?”
“If you’re in his mind, search for why we’re here, and you’ll see,” the Wizard-Who-Lived-Twice tried. It didn’t matter that they carefully came to her when Tobias wasn’t around if she on her own could fry Draco’s mind.
Even then, Draco’s mind was anywhere but on his hard-won privacy. It was so unlike Potter to agree with him on anything before, and just leave.
Then, a memory came where he was, and he didn’t remember Fayre being there… then realized the cute girl from the muggle club was her, disguised.
“Oh, I’m sure he trades all his jail food for hair products at jail too,” Fayre, however, countered him without losing a beat. “He is Lucius Malfoy after all. Having better hair than his wife at all times.”
But also feared it, because if it turned serious, what was the guarantee that Potter didn’t want to live with his new partner? And if it was a witch, maybe they’d have kids, making Severus dispensable in his eyes?
good in anything when Draco draped him in new clothing (which he already saw a peek of when trying it out first, even if it wasn't the finished clothing, mostly just materials), and turned him to their mirror.
Draco, who didn’t have to think about the last one ever for himself, always just repeating Lucius’ ideas whenever he was talking, especially felt the pressure on how important it was what he will tell Severus about it.
“I’d rather have Harry treat him, no matter what,” the bushy-haired witch told the other one in no uncertain terms.
“I mean she isn’t a one night stand. Nor my date,” Harry summed up, but that didn’t make Hermione happier.
“Well then, I guess I’ll just have to wash while you’re creepily watching me getting naked,” Draco huffed, as he’d ever do such thing, but it was important he was believed, so he even pulled off his shirt. It’s not like Potter was into wizards anyway.
“We can dress you up nicely as a test once, and then forget about it,” Draco shrugged. “I wouldn’t mind…”
One minute he was sitting at his desk in the morning, the next, he got a splitting headache, and memories that weren’t his own - yet.
Sometimes I don't know how did I end up writing the things I did. This chapter seems to be one of those times, I'm sorry...
They lived in a hidden village Jack recommended to them, outside the city and in a sensibly peaceful environment, having an only magical population, not counting the huge number of cats.
“We’re leaving, as soon as the elves had packed everything essential,” Draco decided. “So if you have anyone you need to say goodbye to, do it quickly, I’ll wake Severus. That is if you want to leave with us.”
“Drink tea on the terrace, take walks, visit the kids and the grandkids, or take care of business,” Harry listed. “We sometimes even go to Muggle cinema, you seem to like films which are so classy that they need subtitles.”
Harry figured how the cool Fayre kept when Harry bought another woman to his bed, must have been just a brave face Fayre put on.
Eileen worded it differently, saying that if they kept fighting, Severus would think they’d get rid of him, but what Harry asked was also true.
It felt like everything he wanted to achieve was crumbled because he only arrived in 1964, not 1960.
“Maybe me disowning him from the Malfoy name doesn’t help you either, because now it’s no longer his identity. It was a rush to disown my only heir, but I was overly upset when he told me. I want to get him back, but for that, you need to find him.”
Which made him wonder if he would be a horrible person if he seduced Harry just to make him want to stay.
Then, when she was asking him some basic scanning questions, trying to decide which Healer to call, he got her wand and turned her
“Young Master Severus said Master Draco and Master Harry should stay, not destroying room. Pinky will bring food, and release Masters once they are happily married again.”
” Harry agreed because he definitely didn’t propose to Malfoy so lamely just now. If it was about romance, he’d go overboard, not resting until Draco was both totally embarrassed but also enchanted by the idea of marrying him. “I also have thought about a name. Fleamont was a—“
“I can’t let you,” Malfoy pointed it at him with such a tone that Harry thought it was better to not risk any sudden movements. “Don’t move!”
“I do eat human food most of the time. I just can do without it longer. But you’re right, I would be happy to join you,” he sat, and even put away all the paperwork he carried.
I planned on Severus doing something with accidental magic in the end, but in the comments, I also got the suggestion to use their elves to help Drarry, so I did (=> which also shows how grateful I am for every comment, and you guys even trying to help me out with ideas, so thank you all!) <3
“For the record, I’d only tried to Obliviate you, so you don’t mess up my plans further,” Draco said. “But give me the bag, and I’ll tell you everything.”
Then, to Draco's shock, Tobias gestured at the curtains and they moved as if the wind was moving them, except they were indoors, without any windows open.
Draco couldn’t say he loved the 60s New York, with all it’s big-city glory even,  but they only planned to stop there until they got the legal magical permits they needed.
“What in the name of Godric has happened to you?” Potter in the Drawing Room jumped to his feet when he saw Draco, who was glad he could even Apparate home in the state he was in before he collapsed again.
“You could have killed him! What were you thinking? Banishing a wizard when it’s not even allowed on small creatures?” Harry asked her, upset.
There were so many questions about these simple facts now in Harry’s head he didn’t know which one to ask first. And, that’s when Ed also arrived through the Floo - at least he looked so much like his brother Harry didn’t have any doubts it could only have been him.
However when they brought him Lucius Malfoy, who wanted to see him, the blond wizard did look as terrible as one would look surrounded by those creatures around.
Draco knew the feeling: they only rented now, and most of the time he didn’t even bother the elves to unpack the heavy furniture they owned since it would just get left behind.
He didn’t know there would be snow in the mountains but saw his chance. Recruiting Severus to the cause, they ambushed Harry with a spectacular snowball attack: Draco preparing the ammunition, and Severus throwing them.
But every time they resolved an issue, Harry could trust the next time they can do the same as well. And since they both had Slytherin traits, the negotiations didn’t always go as straightforward as one could expect.
It was getting so out of hand Harry couldn’t believe it wasn’t obvious to Malfoy himself why Harry was doing it, but so far he didn’t demand Harry to stop, so he didn’t.
“Don’t ever call me that!” she snapped, letting go of her packing facade. “You have no right to call me by my first name as if I was your buddy!”
He didn’t count on how Potter was a Gryffindor, closing the distance between them next, kissing him. Making Draco fight for the dominance of the kiss, then almost have him on the dining table in return.
Not to mention, Draco had seen where theories of Pureblood Supremacy had led magicals and not only didn’t want any part of that, the idea that Severus would get into it once again scared him even more.
Potter will be the perfect match for Draco as a girl. If it did work out, well. Potter’s fame was definitely compensation for him being a fool.
Harry decided to change his looks to match Narcissa (and the Blacks) more - because it was already in Draco’s magic so it wasn’t such a big change as if Harry invented a look for him. The only thing he couldn’t bring himself to change was Draco’s eyes.
Having spent months if not years in the blond’s head, seeing all the memories, he knew it wasn’t true.
“Jeez, Malfoy, you’re flashing!” Harry scrambled the other way, shielding his eyes but it was too late. “And this is my room!”
Maybe it was because Harry tried to avoid the kid most of the time, and generated only more curiosity compared to Draco, who was always with Severus.
“I apologize, I didn’t mean to say that,” for Harry’s big surprise, Fayre even sat down next to him on the bed. “Losing your virginity at 12 to a stranger in a way you didn’t even enjoy it is not good either. Only, when I feel insulted I automatically insult back.”
“It would be a different future now that our presence here changed everything. And even if it isn’t, we’d have Severus,” Harry insisted.
That made Fayre smile. He was on a good track. He just had to keep the wheel in this direction and go on.
“I’ll help you, but only because you’re worried about your kid, otherwise I don’t respond well to threats,” Harry warned her. “I need to know what happened.”
“Well, you’re now only a Malfoy if you ask me to call you that, in certain… situations,” Harry told him smiling. “And you must have good taste because you chose me.”
“I didn’t know what Sectumsempra did, for the record,” Harry explained. “And although I’m not gay, I don’t mind if you’re occasionally Draco Malfoy if that’s what you want. Plus, I much rather kiss you in this form, than Lucius...”
“I trust Harry more,” Hermione corrected, but to that Fayre only made a face. “I trust him more than with my life, for Ron means more to me than my own life. And if I’m wrong I’m prepared to live with the consequences. But Harry has good instincts.”
“It’s not about that,” Edwin sighed. “He was an intern when I got to know him, and conveniently forgot to mention his age, looking always older, and by the time I figured out, it was too late.”
“That I’m not straight either, but I thought you were?” Draco hesitantly said. Just to feel his whole face heat up when Potter's eyes stared at him in disbelief. “Yet you made me sleep in the same bed, almost shower with you watching—“
“Maybe you could take Severus out to eat something,” Harry had to navigate a relatively thin line between Eileen and Draco. “But only if he didn’t have a big breakfast yet.”
“You’re such a hero you’d die for anyone. And now you just want me because you know how I feel,” suddenly, the small girl morphed into the grown-up Fayre, seemingly upset.
Still, he might have almost jumped when he opened his eyes in the future, and Severus - a grown-up version - was standing beside his bed.
It all went wrong when she - as a good little Malfoy which she wasn’t even anymore - noticed that Potter was getting ready for a date.
Hell, even the material felt more comfortable, aside from his new image. And maybe he also got why the Malfoys always seem to move around with such graceful movements. You'd be a traitor to your fine garments if you'd run like a kid in them, for instance.
“Don’t go then,” he tried, but for that, Fayre seemed so upset that she even stopped with the frantic packing.
Chasing cats, playing Muggle kid’s games, inviting others for tea-parties, which always made Draco smile, whenever he saw it.
Now that it has been laid out before him, Harry tried to grasp the meaning. Could this really be the case?
“Mrs. Snape, my name is Draco and I’m from a Pureblood family related to the Malfoys,” he quickly said, pointing his wand at Tobias, who was assessing him now. “I know about your current living conditions, and I want you to take Severus and Apparate to this address now. I’ll help you, but—“
And Harry must have enjoyed it too because he not only matched Draco’s speed moving his hips but also looked at him almost teasingly as if to say this wasn’t enough.
“So how is it really going, Potter?” the scum used a fake velvety voice. “You have this threesome, but that’s not exotic enough for you, so you choose to shag a Malfoy as well? Are gay blowjobs the price to get you out of prison, even though you were a known Death Eater?”
“I’ll try to keep it in mind,” maybe it wasn’t such a good idea at all, Draco was sure he’ll get bored to death.
One day he even bought a cello for Severus, never asking Draco for his permission or money, claiming Severus said he wanted to learn how to play some music ever since they danced together.
“I think we can make it work for a night,” Draco said because he was too tired to care, already missing the familiarity of their home.
“Well, I’m sorry I wanted him to get some fresh air when you keep him glued to books the whole day!” the sentence was out on Harry’s mouth before he could rethink it.
“To resolve a conflict. Sirius nominated you as the Black heir, you got everything after his death, already. So that cannot be changed. And Draco was the Malfoy heir so he didn’t need any shares from the Black’s side, so it was okay. However, when Lucius disowned him, he inherited everything that’s the Black’s property, for he was an heir of the Black-line again, and he was older than you, outranking you, and therefore confusing Grimmauld Place.”
“It’s only for a short time until I can get used to this era and find something better,” Harry tried to be optimistic. At least he would get payed for the tasks the Dursleys always demanded from him for free, that’s surely an advantage, right?
He underestimated Malfoy, for he was seemingly fine without money as well, if it meant he could be himself - gay. That was a quality Harry didn’t see in him before.
“For the last time, you are not allowed!” Malfoy might have been angry, or embarrassed or both for his light complexion didn’t hide the blush that was creeping into his cheeks. “I’m the only Malfoy you’re allowed to
He was so drunk he took the woman to his place instead of hers! Shit, what the hell will his date think? What will Fayre think? For the Dragon’s-Dang-Sake, this was not supposed to happen!
“There is also one more thing. Every time Severus alerted her of our location, apparently it was because of me,” he confessed, almost waiting for Harry to suddenly jerk away from him.
So he went excruciatingly slow next, but with quite forceful and deep trusts, denying what Harry so desperately wanted to reach, and only picking up some speed once again when he felt like he wouldn’t last otherwise anymore.
Harry considered how he didn’t even say goodbye to the redhead. He was terrified to lose Ron in the war, but when he didn’t, he automatically thought Ron would live into an old age like Arthur was getting into, with kids and Hermione, and now this…
“I thought when you said you’re going to have a day off, it included me, yet you’re hiding away with a book you’ve already read?”
“Is it?” Draco smiled. Severus giving Harry commands who - probably for the first time ever - had to comply with the reading Severus had assigned to him was funny on its own.
Harry kept telling everyone stupid stories about how they were a perfect couple, almost daring anyone to question it.
“You want to send your consciousness forward, to look around,” Draco realized just by the smile Harry had on. “But how do you bring it back?”
Draco always used a Doubling Charm on the books they read, so Severus could follow for himself the text as Draco was reading, but Severus stopped turning the pages, and didn't seem keen to continue either.
Then he returned to Eileen, ready to help her but also tempted to not help her at all, when he’d noticed she had a strong Disillusionment charm on. And under it, she was so badly beaten, she could barely stand. She looked worse than Draco.
“If you no longer want me, even just because we have no choice then—“ Draco frowned, but the next second Potter was on him with a kiss, radiating heat and want even from his magic.
It put things into perspective seeing all those terrible fates that could have befallen on them but didn’t.
“Those creatures, I’m afraid, belong only to fairy tales, not to the royal court,” Draco took a sip from his cup, and Harry was both irritated and amused by it.
“You can’t mean that! I thought you wanted to rescue Severus because you knew what it was like to have parents
However, Lucius didn’t want a reformed son either, who completely differs from the old ways. He could deal with Draco marrying a half-blood, just to show they weren’t picky about the topic, but within reason.
He did sense he just only insulted her without even wanting to do that, but he didn’t care. Ron started working as an Auror only recently, and if Hermione couldn’t help him, nor the Nurses at the Ministry, that was bad. No matter how much he liked Fayre, if Ron's life was in danger, he couldn't think about anything else.
“The start of the game!” the girl said, still giving him a nasty look. “Where all the others come fall back if they can’t complete the task they were given.
“I’m Severus,” he put his wand away, and proceeded to the introduction, trying to guess if his brother’s houseguest was a one-night stand or something more Ed completely forgot to mention to him.
Draco could have used a cold shower, because he definitely couldn’t find Potter so sexy this way, and stay in character to last long.
According to Draco, there were clothes and “rags there weren’t worth mentioning”, although, he seemed to mention them quite a lot.
“Just so you know, you… old rake, it is your goddamn naked son in woman’s skin I wake up next to every morning!” he told the blond wizard who was almost sure he didn’t hear that right.
There was an awkward pause until Lucius didn’t get up from his seat, ready to be escorted back to his cell, keeping his cold blue eyes on Harry.
Draco, who was already jealous once, when Harry’s heartbeat wasn’t beating as loudly as it was now. Not to mention, if Harry managed and declined any advances from their new friend, he didn't want Matt to start flirting with Draco either.
“But enough of this friendly chit-chat,” the Death Eater remarked with a real frightening smile. “I know how Draco Malfoy shares your bed every morning, and how, in a woman’s form, he’s pure precious to you, Harry Potter, and I have your girlfriend now. What are you willing to trade for her? Your life? Your friends’ life? Both, if you’re stupid enough?”
Well, the “interview” was interesting, given that the owner of the store wasn’t impressed by Harry in Muggle attire, so Harry decided to visit Madame Malkin’s right after. He needed a couple of items of clothing anyway.
Many times in the past Draco had wondered if Potter styled his hair to a mess on purpose to look more rebellious, but he didn’t have to guess anymore.
However, whatever Draco expected to accomplish by tossing his shirt to the floor it wasn’t Potter coming closer, running his fingers along the scars Draco only had because of him.
Truth is, he kept kissing Potter and went slow in the beginning, and Harry picked up on that as well.
Harry hesitated. After his shopping spree, Harry could use the free accommodation, but since when was Draco doing him any favors?
“Yeah, Potter, me being gay meant I did sleep with wizards before. Not everyone can be a virgin at twenty!”
“You’re killing him because you always hated him! You might think you’re actually helping, but deep down you wanna punish him for all the things you didn’t have and he did!”
Draco also wanted to buy better clothes for Severus. Eileen was working now, and they could just as well tell Tobias it was from her paycheck as long it wasn’t a fancy garment and it could pass as a Muggle style, but that didn’t go as he planned.
“He’s immune to magic,” Draco heard in his head, Eileen probably being just as much of a talented Legilimens as Severus would be later, planting the idea in his head without alerting her husband to their conversation. “When he let’s go, you should run for the door and save yourself. I’ll distract him. He won’t hurt me as badly, he loves me.”
“Send a Patronus,” Draco nodded. He hated how his was a ferret, but that was overruled by the necessity that it was still the easiest way to communicate. “And if anything seems fishy, go to the newspaper we’ve hidden in the Ministry, and return to the past without a second thought.”
So then Lucius could swoop in afterward, and find Draco a proper Slytherin mate for life and once again, restore the family name.
But Severus was a half-blood, Potter as well, and Draco didn’t feel as if he was better than Granger for instance. If anything, the witch was smarter and more capable, although Draco would never admit to that with Potter present.
He was teaching Severus about a number of materials that could be used as cauldrons and the young wizard kept asking question after question, deeply immersed in the topic for about half an hour.
“How do you know it was me?” However, if they were to yell at each other, Harry stood his ground just as well as Draco. “It could have been you, I certainly didn’t notice him in my head, so there’s no way to know if he also can hide his magic! If it wasn’t your stiffness and overly polite behavior that gave us away…”
And even if it was a very Muggle activity to learn, which Draco didn’t think much about, Severus seemed like he might jump out of his skin seeing it, so Draco just thanked Harry, and then later even volunteered to take Sev to a Muggle tutor for some lessons.
“I was here,” little Severus took a step further. “A wizard with flashy hair and magic came, and I was so happy because I only ever get to see Mum and Muggles, but he made everything go real bad… But I’m hungry and…”
I just hope it's not too confusing? Also, the way Harry "travels" is different from the crystal (Warehouse 13 style, I think they had something like this? Anyway.)
“Maybe you should tell me what this fantasy entails,” he told Potter, whose eyes grew wide, just by hearing how Draco’s voice dropped, only by thinking about the possibilities.
“We can always fake-marry, adopt Severus legally, and socialize with wizarding communities outside Britain, so we would avoid the risk of running into your grandfather, or Tom,” Harry shrugged, making Draco stare.
“Well, he’s not dead yet, but not better either,” she answered, and then they both fell into silence. Maybe Fayre performed the wrong spell, and the non-worsening phase will wear off. Maybe she did perform the right spell but was too late.
Thank you everyone for reading! I didn't expect it would take me more than 10 chapters to write this story frankly.
By the time Harry and Draco got home, the blond seemed to calm down somewhat, so Harry didn’t have to start so carefully around the topic.
She did manage to otherwise look unshaken, but when they were no longer in front of Fayre, Hermione did hit Harry on the shoulders, quite hard too.
“Yes, that's what I thought until I saw this,” Potter just tossed a Prophet at Draco, but while he was distracted, the thug in the background cornered him, and even before Draco could warn Potter about it, hit the Saviour of the Wizarding World so hard that Potter fell to the floor.
“Mom? Should they be here?” the conversation naturally halted when Severus appeared, timidly asking.
Lucius could get out of prison in time for the grandchildren they were having to raise at least one right, instead of Draco, making sure the Malfoy line was resurrected at once.
Then the Trio would have time to overpower him without anyone getting hurt, or even worse, Potter cursing the madman’s head off, but eventually destroying his spotless reputation as he had as the Saviour in the wizarding world.
“Oh, yes, definitely,” the blond smiled at him, but then cruelly pulled away, and turned to the next box which contained a carefully arranged piece of clothing. “This one next.”
However, the blond wizard tried to encourage Severus to freely ask him about anything, and once Severus knew it was safe to, he bombarded Draco with questions about everything.
Fooling around in the kitchen with what Potter called cooking made him ask Draco to let him brew potions.
She pushed her memories into Harry’s mind of last night, but all at once, which indeed make Harry nauseous. Not to mention, more concerned for Malfoy.
Severus just bought back the Tales of Beedle the Bard for him to read with a very serious expression, so Draco didn't push brewing.
“WAIT! I’m here to help, just hear me out! We’re on the same side here! You know time-travel, and I know from your husband’s mind that your Dark Lord was evil, but nothing like this. And we’re both hunted, and want to undo this, I suggest at least a talk!”
“I’m not sleeping with you, even if we never get out of here again,” Draco snarled, jumping to his feet.
Having probably the best sleep since the war was over, waking up to how Draco turned in his sleep and was now facing him, looking younger without a scowl on, sleeping peacefully.
When he finally got back to Malfoy, and the blond was awake, he knew he needed to have a long and taxing talk with him, but wasn’t sure if the blond was up for it yet. Maybe Harry wasn’t either.
“You know, most of the jobs like that are house-elf work for those who can’t even afford to pay for an actual house-elf,” Draco said as if now that he got rid of Harry, he was too shocked to just accept it.
And third, he knew about the Horcruxes and was willing to learn anything, because it was an interesting topic, not to mention, he also was hoping it would help him research the artifact that had brought them to this time.
Harry let Draco educate Severus in the morning, while Draco trusted Harry would make sure Severus had plenty of exercise in the garden in the afternoon.
But he also realized something when he let his anger go. His almost panic-like fear of making a decision that could ruin his future came from the fact that - uncharacteristically - he had a
There was a price to pay for it, however. He constantly had a headache and was confused about the small details of their lives, whether it happened, or it happened on a day they changed.
“Yet, the only memories that might stand a chance to convince Eileen are in my head,” Draco wasn’t going to let the upset Harry find Eileen and Tobias alone.
“You wouldn’t even guess, who are you shagging in this future,” Harry told Draco after he already told most of the important things they needed to discuss first.
“She was in your bed, next to you, for Griffindor’s sake!” Hermione managed to say just when Fayre herself decided to get up and met their stares at the top of the stairs.
Even when they both went and took Severus to Diagon Alley again - Draco hoped if they were both there the young wizard would tolerate the crowd better and it worked - they seamlessly ended up following this pattern.
“WHAT?!” for a second Potter’s reaction was so intense before he handled himself that Lucius knew he hit a nerve, he’d just have to figure out what way he should twist this to figure out really what happened. “No, I didn’t!”
They barely scored points in the end, and Harry saw Malfoy holding back, but Severus, who barely said a word in his presence so far was so immersed in the simple Keeper’s Game that he didn’t even notice, and kept telling Harry to go faster, to turn better, to not hold back. Catching the ball Malfoy had transformed from a rock himself, even throwing it to quite a distance, considering.
“Then it doesn’t have to be permanent. Let Draco take Severus only for smaller periods of time first. You could even tell your husband Severus is with an old neighbor lady who volunteered to watch him and see how they get along.“
. Being Sev’s sibling meant Ed rarely had to talk to anyone without his brother’s present, and when he did - like with McGonagall - it was mostly about work.
“I assume you must have learned modern warding charms on the run. This building has a security system that’s at least 50 years old and could kill anyone nastily for a wrong move, but let intruders just walk in easily if they approached the house a Muggle way, as far as I can tell. You could fix that, as a start,” Malfoy announced.
But I also envisioned Harry renting a room in the Leaky Cauldron, and since it's not a Muggle establishment, I hope if their room had a bathtub, you guys can believe they could conjure enough water into it anyway with some Augamenti (Maxima) if nothing else.
“And second, Severus must have heard when you told me about your new boyfriend, to lock us up like this.”
“I need the library too, for finding Malfoy,” Harry explained. “And the Weasley’s might not want me since Ginny and I are just over.”
“I can’t. My husband was the only one who ever noticed me and stood by me even when my own family cursed me out. Everything we own, he worked for it, and I just…”
“Did you know?” only Potter could look so utterly defeated, but at the same time fired up by complete fury towards Draco. For reasons unknown to the blond.
Draco had only slept that night because he was suffering from sleep-deprivation long before the Battle of Hogwarts, but waking up in the same bed as the Wizard-Who-Lived-Again was messing with his head.
So now his own cellmates treated him as a traitor and tortured him, and Harry felt responsible for that, giving the testimony that put Lucius to prison.
If Harry thought talking with Malfoy after what happened between them made him truly uncomfortable, he was wrong.
One day, Tobias came home early and caught Eileen telling Severus Potions was a class in Hogwarts, showing her son a textbook. Tobias in a rage not only burned the book but was about to hurt their son as well, while Eileen pleaded for him to punish her instead.
“It was bound to happen. I’m already surprised it didn’t happen before, to be honest, but that’s maybe because of our lifestyle, so you should give this wizard a chance if he managed to get through to you nonetheless,” the blond seemed to be so adult about it Harry almost wasn’t sure he should believe it or not. “Was there anything else?”
Now, instead, his family’s whole reputation and fate were laid in the hands of Potter. Not a result or even sighting of his son, and even Narcissa’s helping the Chosen One - or, as Lucius liked to call Harry in himself, the BGI, standing for Biggest Griffindor Idiot, - yielded any results. Unacceptable.
For now, he got a starters kit of Potions in one room, asking Severus if he wanted to try anything that was in the Potions books they read.
It felt so natural, trusting Potter. They didn’t even have to discuss their routines as if it was evident, and they could just read each other’s mind. Draco could get used to it so easily, so sometimes he had to remind himself to snap out of it.
Harry had never seen Draco still not dressed by seven, but when both Severus and Ed left to school, he found the blond arranging the documents he needed to owl from their bed, although it was almost noon.
Now, waking up in the morning, and seeing the raven-haired wizard with yet another woman almost broke her heart, like she was sentimental, which as a Slytherin would never be…
He was just a coward, not even daring to tell Potter how much discontent he felt about the thought that Harry was trying to preserve that future so much.
joy,” Malfoy then spoke up in such a sarcastic voice that it could have easily beaten Snape’s usual monologues had the potion master been there. “No matter that I’m no longer a girl and don’t live in this house, we still see each other every morning.”
Severus was ecstatic when the elves prepared a cake for dessert once, declaring it was his favorite food “ever”. Since then, Draco ordered Mindy to have a different cake prepared for every week.
Draco heard Harry’s sharp intake of breath when he started kissing down on his tight, then giving him a blowjob that already made Potter break the rules, coming hot into Draco’s mouth, but it was only the beginning.
“And I made sure he wouldn't burn down the kitchen,” Harry added, while Mindy bought in a tray with a plate that was covered.
In a blink, Harry felt an intrusion to his mind, but she never actually spoke a spell, and she was gone as soon as Harry noticed her poking around in his head.
“As if I could, without inadvertently hurting Severus as well,” she laughed, but her laugh didn’t carry any joy.
He wasn’t going to decide how to face Eileen on his own. Even if it was just a technicality, they were married now, so he needed to update Malfoy quickly about the details.
So it was strictly forbidden to use it as human transportation, and as Draco had found himself on the Muggle pavement grunting in pain, unable to move, but also extremely lucky to be even still alive, he first considered how it was a terrible mistake to interfere.
Fayre wondered - for she didn’t really have anything else to do - what he needed a hostage for, and asked, but he didn’t tell.
Draco being homeless, nameless and penniless just didn’t fit his profile. Harry couldn’t begin to phantom where he could have disappeared like this.
He even fake bowed with a funny gesture, making Severus straighten his back as if he was indeed noble, which made him smile.
“I’m willing to go with you. You can still attack us both the same after,” Harry wouldn’t forfeit his wand, but at least could make her see reason.
“Sorry Harry, I guess I shouldn’t talk about you at the Ministry,” now Ron apologized with a small smile. “Apparently, even the walls have ears.”
It was like they were back to the day they arrived, and Potter wanted to return desperately to his friends. Only one thing changed: now he wanted to take Draco and Severus back as well.
Edwin couldn’t help but chuckle on that comment. How was it possible, that after all, he might just have a good night?
Harry heard what Hermione said about the curse, yet he stopped listening somewhere after the first “there is nothing to do”.
“It doesn’t matter now, save your strength.” If they could run away again, they already collected everything they needed for her to perform the spelled.
So he kept his shields up, and in the meanwhile, he tried and failed to come up with a plan. However, his dumb-Potter-luck didn’t seem to completely run out, at least not yet, because as he was trying to put some distance between him and Malfoy, he palmed something soft and sturdy on the ground.
“Not everything was the same,” he then told the blond. “You said Edwin defeated me, so the Dark side won. That’s proof.”
There really was no indication that it can be broken whatsoever. He had no choice, however. He had to save Fayre.
“I did. It’s… It’s Draco, Harry. Wizards, when gay, needed a spell to have kids since 1468. After all, the pureblood bloodline had to survive, so there is a spell that can turn a gay wizard - if he is the heir of the bloodline - to a woman. Draco used this--”
Since he had his doubts about how Malfoy would take a compliment coming from him (probably thinking Harry was insulting him sarcastically), he only held out his hand.
Soon, it wasn’t only Draco listening to Harry talking, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder while watching the kids, but Severus and Edwin joining them with the cauldron.
Hermione did shake her hand and muttered something in French, to which Fayre replied with a big smile. That made Hermione smile too, which a little bit irritated Harry for he didn’t even understand a word.
Severus never saw Ed blush, but now even his ears went slightly pink, and he avoided eye-contact as if his life depended on it.
If the Green-Eyed-Teen-Dream married a Muggle girl and their kids would have turned out to be Squibs, he would have still loved them with all his heart, Fayre was sure of that.
“Not really?” Draco told him but then admitted. “Maybe just as much as I have to, to make it happen.”
“Well, you weren’t wrong, I am proud. Of both of them,” Draco finally announced, when Harry thought for sure he’s going to curse him. “I’m only disappointed I didn’t think about it sooner. Edwin is doing much better since, and Severus can learn a bit of responsibility, and I could even read a book now, and they’d both most likely survive the night still…”
“Time for you to finish your plate, young man,” Draco announced before Harry could consider - again - how much truth he should let a 4-year-old know.
He kinda wanted Malfoy next to him every morning. Not because of the naked thing, Merlin’s underpants no, but because he kinda wanted to have back the friend he had as Fayre.
The last memory Draco remembered before waking up was Harry kissing him before the spell, then waking up in an older body, alone, famished, cold, and in a dark… cave?
“Obviously,” Harry muttered and decided not to let Malfoy’s comment or the ruckus of the last five minutes get to him.
“I also told Matt off from you while I was there, on no uncertain terms, so if you’re still considering anything with him, you might have to apologize first,” Draco shrugged, with an almost cruel expression.
“You were dead, and so was Severus,” finally, when Draco regained his strength and ate something for breakfast Harry insisted on, he could say.
Headmaster Severus Snape would have despised Harry even more if he knew Harry went back to his past and how the kid Severus wanted to spend time with Harry for some reason, giving him a hopeful look.
“Since we’re stuck here, it’s inevitable that we’ll change the future. So we could work together to make sure we’ll only change things for the better, right?”
And Draco knew he could never forgive himself if he was rougher with Harry for his first time, but also wasn’t going to pass on a challenge.
Sorry for a little bit more world-building in this chapter! I have tried to make do without it - that's also why I couldn't post the new chapter earlier.
“Stay,” Severus brought Draco back from his wandering thoughts when he was ready to take care of some documents the Goblins owled him in the morning. “Maybe we could all learn Time-magic? It’s Harry’s turn to read now.”
He was shockingly forthcoming, yet still soft with the kid, and also a magical. And there was an instant connection between them that was hard to deny. But not impossible.
Ed, for the life of him, couldn’t help but wonder why would he decide to stay, just when before he wasn’t.
So Lucius just grabbed the back of Potter’s head and - if it was the most natural thing in the world  - kissed the Saviour-Of-The-Wizarding-Community good. With tongue, and he also grabbed Potter’s buttocks with his other hand to pull the boy closer, just for good measure.
“Among other things,” Draco almost toppled over, when Harry caught him, and had to made sure he was okay, but the blond just shook his head that it was alright. “But if you saw the future you, you should know you can do it.”
He wasn’t surprised that when he got home, Fayre was packing. Harry realized how he’d never even been in the room, which was Fayre’s, and how she didn’t have many belongings.
Also, he wanted to have a chance to correct the wrongs he and Hermione said to Fayre when she was saving Ron’s life.
And Eileen did entrust the kid originally to Harry, even if she must have later realized it was Draco who took care of him.
Harry tried not to think he was sold to the idea because he found a Draco Malfoy who would share meals with him voluntarily a curious thing, but failed.
This only went on when they fell asleep next to each other, waking up to Pinky who bought breakfast, but also at least a week worth of newspapers, which comforted Harry.
“I— I’m the other Draco, so technically, I haven’t read this book yet,” there was no way he could keep up the facade in front of Harry, and Draco didn’t feel like spying on their future would accomplish anything.
Ginny should be able to date anyone without anyone making a fuss about it, sending curses to her. Why couldn’t she? Because she was connected to Harry, and people were terrible beings, enjoying the drama.
Last but not least, he was also helping Fayre with Potions, a topic he never thought he would excel at.
“We can’t hand over Severus-“ Draco started as soon as the elves reported that the Snapes indeed left the property. He wasn’t taking any chances and Harry couldn't help but agree.
of a family who abandoned her?” Tobias took a step toward Draco now. “Do you want a message to take back to them? Tell them she’s dead. She doesn’t need them or magic anymore. And you… you’re so weak! It was stupid of you to come here.”
Maybe Draco Malfoy openly apologizing for something made Harry’s head go wrong or something for he told the blond.
“But if we do that, we will get on the radar of Voldemort even if it’s just because he would want to recruit us. And good luck explaining all the Purebloods in this era who we are.”
Maybe if Harry didn’t end up in the past because of Malfoy, he would have tried something even more stupid.
“I’m only asking because if you aren’t a package deal, who would take care of my son together, then I'll only allow you to take him.”
Harry knew Draco was teaching Severus about a lot of things, but he guessed they also had some breaks. He couldn’t help but throw a glance at Malfoy, who just defiantly stared back as if he wanted to curse Harry to pieces, but so far didn’t interfere.
“If it was me, I’d divide a piece of a larger piece for maximizing profit, and one that already traveled quite much in time and space, and has existed for some time now as we know it.”
Draco wanted to hurt Tobias badly if he couldn't Eileen, not with her condition. If Tobias was still immune to curses, and Eileen would hurt or kill Draco in return, at least he wouldn’t have to witness Severus being taken away from them.
He was free of the burden the Dursleys, the Weasleys, the Marauders, Dumbledore, and Voldemort, if not the whole magical society has placed on him. Not even McGonagall, Mrs. Weasley or Hermione were there with him to point out what needed to be done next.
“And if we did?” Harry waited for this objection clearly, because he already knew what he was going to say.
“Potter… His name is Harry James Potter!” Malfoy’s expression darkened. “And I want to participate in the discussion as well.”
“Because what would I do then, when you returned to the future? Everyone would think it’s strange that you just suddenly disappeared, maybe thinking I killed you and ordered the elves to bury you in the back garden just next to the shed under some rose bushes or something.”
And Harry did see a huge gap of difference, to his surprise. Not only were the garments his size, but also the cut of them were made especially for his body type. It was unbelievable.
Potter went so red it was just pure exquisite entertainment. He also did shout at Lucius and that told him he was going somewhere with the guessing.
“Wow, didn’t know you had a man-crush on Draco Malfoy of all people,” Fayre, however, teased him for it, with a huge grin.
“You went to the market and used Muggle money which you claimed you couldn’t use properly, just so that I wouldn’t. And now you moved me to your bed to notice if I was gone for the night.”
“I won’t tell Harry anything today, and I’ve always known you had some issues trusting him. And that you were kind of an idiot if you ask me.”
They even had a very polite and uneventful dinner next, until it was Severus who refused to go to bed without a bedtime story all three of them acted out, demanding to go to Harry's room, yet left them to take a bath first.
Which would have been flattering, and Harry would have walked away, probably going to another market from that day on to avoid complications.
Since then, Hermione and Fayre were best friends, researching magic together, and having conversations Harry didn’t understand the half of. However, he learned a lot in the past - almost - two months.
“If I drop my defenses, you’ll only do the same to me. You probably can hurt Draco badly, and I understand how losing Severus would make you want to do it even,” if Harry had Severus taken away from him, he’d be devastated to say at least and murderous. “But you must know we’re having this standoff because—“
Finally, Severus had some company of other young witches and wizards, awfully shy at first, but then in a couple of weeks acting like all the others.
“I reported to the Ministry what Eileen and Tobias did to Edwin anonymously, so if anybody, I’m at the fault,” Harry said.
Eileen didn’t ask how, rather, she already started, and saw memories of Occlumency lessons Harry had with Snape.
Tobias also often frequented the pub, drinking the last of the family’s money away, and Eileen would give it to him.
“Meaning whatever you give Tobias - your love, your support, your obedience, your health, even magic... it can't help him, not unless he wants to change. And the fact that you kept shrinking yourself just the please him didn't - can't - make you any less.”
“I’ve noticed,” Harry said, but his thoughts were elsewhere. At twelve? That was the year of the Chamber of the Secrets. Draco couldn’t even leave the school for that year, for it was their third year they were officially let to Hogsmeade regularly. How did Draco sneak out to have sex with a stranger in their second year? And whom was it that—
“You know perfectly well!” Hermione burst out into tears, probably feeling as powerless in the situation as Harry did, if not more.”Ron had a loving family, true friends, honest relationships. All the things you probably never had! He even had Harry’s friendship, for Merlin’s sake, when you couldn’t even get a handshake, Malfoy!”
However, at this distance, how could he convince his son of anything? Potter probably wouldn’t tell Draco anything he says. However, if he did more than just talking…
Draco cringed when Eileen was punished for the lack of her cooking skills when as a Pureblood, she wasn’t expected to cook anything herself before her marriage. And certainly not without money to buy the ingredients she needed, or without magic, which Tobias didn’t at all tolerate.
I got so hyped not having to work for these 3 consecutive days (long weekend, finally!), that I have already written a double chapter update today.
“We could go on a date. I’d show you our favorite restaurant, and try to keep you from learning anything you aren’t supposed to.”
Draco certainly couldn’t teach Severus simultaneously while taking care of Edwin, who couldn’t speak yet, no matter how he was 4 and had to be watched constantly because his newly returned magic sometimes produced quite dangerous situations.
“I knew they would have to put him up for adoption after that, but I thought the further away a kid is from them, the better. So if anyone is fixing this, it should be me, and you should rest, you can’t even stand,” Harry said.
They spent days preparing for worst-case scenarios, and Draco and Severus had made several blood-replenishment potions so Harry and Draco could take the blood-loss that was a side-effect of the spell.
“Look, I know we’ve been fighting each other, but we’ve both lost. I regret everything, and I have no doubt you would love to have your husband back, as well as Severus.”
After dinner, Potter seemed to handle their talk about "what did go wrong?" as an adult, not yelling and even listening to what Draco had to say. Until he didn’t, and Draco was forced to recap.
“Youngest to have the title in some time,” Severus proudly added. “But if you and Dad would like to change anything, Father, Ed will be quite smart, but you could also make him more social? He spends most of his time with McGonagall, and while she is a great Deputy, I doubt the age-gap between them is appropriate—“
He was methodically angering all the three, Fayre knew, and unfortunately, it worked. Even Hermione’s hand went more gripping her wand as before.
As if they had an unspoken agreement with Draco over the last few weeks, every task between them was divided.
Taking such care to label everything with the funnily-shaped letters children first write with that he didn’t even notice Harry and Draco watching him fondly.
“I did, but it’s not like reading a couple of financial reports would wear me out,” Draco announced. “Which I would like to do if you don’t mind…”
“You must be Draco Fleamont, my name is Jack Moss, and I told your husband I could help,” the wizard smiled and led them to a hotel, where there was a complete floor Muggles couldn’t see, rented a room for them, and didn’t let Draco pay.
Draco should protect Potter just as much Potter has protected him in the past, even if it was from himself.
“I can’t believe you fail to see the consequences of your actions, Malfoy,” Potter’s voice was resigned. “Even if I wasn’t worried, which I was, what did you expect to accomplish? You break into their family home in the middle of the night, threaten her husband, and tell Eileen to pack her things and her son because she’s coming with you, an 18-year-old stranger?”
“As long as you know I’m going to charm your appearance next, I trust you can figure it out,” Malfoy just motioned for him to do it.
“Risk it?” Draco asked. “Remember when I told you the same thing when you wanted to adopt Edwin as well, and I said we couldn’t? And how well that turned out!”
Given that she saw how to use the newspaper to send her consciousness back, and how she knew it was the tactic Harry used to elude her for years, Draco couldn’t let her out of his sight.
They had spent days arguing after that, getting nowhere. Alternating between almost cursing each other to pieces and finding a common understanding why it would never work between them.
“My life may be humble now, ma'am, but when I was younger, I had quite many adventures,” Harry decided he won’t be underestimated either.
Harry tried to make his mind skip these dark thoughts and turned to go to the place where from he could Apparate home.
“Or, our meddling causes ripples not only forward but backward in time as well. The mere presence of the spectator watching the experiment influencing the results.”
Potter just gave him an annoyed look, but his next spell was to make the unforgiving floor invisibly cushioned.
If the memories were failures and Fayre was trying to solve them, he’ll help her one by one, and eventually, they can be back in reality once again…
“We are married, and you must still need some rest,” Harry just rearranged the covers around Draco. “You’re so lightheaded, you don’t even know what you’re saying. I’ll bring you something to read until you’re feeling better.”
Or, when he was chewing peacefully on a toy one second, and he enlarged it to the size of the room the next, and Harry and Draco couldn’t find him in all that plastic that filled the space (although lucky Edwin was safe under a table, and not plastered to the toy, Harry was worried sick, just as Draco).
“Forget it,” Fayre grimaced, and maybe turned to leave, maybe just to grab food, but Harry couldn’t risk it.
“They are dead. Severus was killed slowly and painfully by the new Dark Lord, just as my husband. And Harry was lured there by Severus’ capture so Edwin could defeat him for the title of the Elder Wand, the only item he needed for his collection.”
I tried to write this chapter from Eileen's POV, but then I couldn't keep a certain distance I usually like to keep, and after many rewrites, Harry got this part.
Warning: this chapter displays Eileen and Tobias as horrible parents, so if you think that could be triggering for you, please don't read.
Little did she know that Harry Potter got to her first, catching her (while Weasley got the criminal in the background with a spell), making a very good-looking headline in the papers, but not really helping her. She was already in deep, magical coma by then.
He all but forgot about their conversation, when Severus and Potter appeared in his room early in the morning a couple of days later, even before Draco could get up.
“You still think he has behavior problems?” Harry quietly asked, then without waiting for an answer helped Severus out by putting a preservation charm on the jars Severus already filled.
For a moment, Harry almost thought Snape would reduct House Points soon, or start yelling at him for something he had done, but when Severus caught his line of line easily and just smiled at him.
Except, he wanted to meet the charming wizard again. He didn’t feel any attraction to most of the wizards he knew in his life, and the only one he felt a spark with was completely untouchable, given their cohabitation, and Malfoy’s rules.
“Excuse me, but he’s your son! Maybe you shouldn’t have drawn him away when he confessed to you that he was gay!”
“Well, not the exact time-travel we were looking for, but—” Draco gave him such a sharp look Harry found it was wiser if he just shut up soon. “Yes.”
“Let me see,” Harry also tried a couple of spells, and it wouldn’t give. And the magic was familiar. “House-elf magic.”
“Oh-oh, already sucking up to me, Potter?” the criminal laughed. “And here I thought it was just our first real date.”
Harry never was good with his anger management, was he. Lucius calling him an imbecile like Vernon or Snape would in the old days didn’t help either.
“And I could say I also want to work to make some money,” Eileen said. “Not because it would make such a difference, but it would give me a good enough reason when I tell Tobias.”
And then… nothing. The door still didn’t give, the room was still magically closed off, and the elves didn’t appear happily congratulating them on sorting their differences out so quickly.
When he first disappeared, Harry thought Draco would resurface after two days: as soon as his pocket money ran out he’d be back begging Lucius to take him back, no matter what. Maybe Lucius thought this too.
“It’s not where, but when. We’re supposed to be in the year Severus was born, which would be 1960, but thanks to you, the magic didn’t take us entirely back, so I have no way of knowing…”
So, is it how you guys thought it will be? How will Draco react to the humiliation and Harry knowing? Will he just disappear again as he did after the scene with Lucius?
So he decided to do something he wouldn’t usually do. Even with the cleaning spells, the thought of it didn’t attract Draco at all: a good enough distraction that might just keep him from getting too hard too fast.
And anger was a choice. Harry never before calmed down so fast when Draco appeared breaking up the fight, reminding Harry why he couldn’t just use anger as a tool to lie to himself anymore.
“But that didn’t work because you saved Ron’s life,” Hermione added still with much gratefulness in her voice, yet still as if she felt bad for that scene she made that day. “So he had to get creative and here we are.”
“That’s because you’d need my help. We need to work together, not fight each other. I think we can both send our memories back to 1967, but I need you to trust me.”
“But also: no books, no owls, no investment newspapers for you on this trip,” Harry counted on his fingers. “Meditation, walking, spending time with Severus without trying to parent him is allowed.”
“You can leave him with me, I’m sure you could use a break,” he told Draco, while Severus was already taking the neat pile of books apart next to him.
“I already postponed it one day, can’t do this forever,” Harry said, still wishing he could when he saw Lucius’ form being led to him.
“I may or may not have bought a magical tent and recruited the elves to set it up already, and told Severus we’ll take a vacation,” Harry grinned. "It's in a high altitude forest where rumor says that you can harvest plenty of ingredients for potions.
“I must admit, I don’t know much about the second one,” Ed concentrated on the detail so badly because he didn’t seem to be wrong, and Lucas seemed to be flirting. But why?
By the hundredth memory, Harry felt his magic getting weaker. He had to figure something, and do it fast.
Pictures of a worn out and tired Harry coming home from work who would be too tired to even talk with Severus flashed before Draco’s eyes.
It seemed Draco making an adult choice yesterday already negatively affected Severus. Why else would Potter so desperately trying to separate himself from them?
“Wait, what will you do without a place to go—” Harry was still more concerned than he thought he’ll ever be for a Malfoy.
And, where Draco was closed off and cold, and sometimes even refusing, Matt was open, warm, and straight on commenting how he thought Harry was hot. A little bit less since Harry told him he was married, and only agreed to spend time as friends, but still not shy to express it.
“If we do this,” he had to stop the Boy-Who-Lived before he himself won’t be able to stop either. “I demand we don't do it on a fucking table, and it can only be a one-time thing. We get it out of our system, and we’re done.”
Only, both brooms were full-size and battered as they were, they still flew quite fast for a complete beginner, and Harry didn’t think about that. He only saw a broom at age 11, and being a natural, never had any concerns...
Hermione told him it was impossible to save Fayre now - she knew about the curse she was hit with because of her work and no one ever got up after being hit with a curse like this.
If Harry went about the issue as a Gryffindor and told Draco he wanted his husband to have some fun with shopping for him now that the kids were too old for it, it would have never worked.
“I’ll tell Mindy we would like to have an early lunch here instead of downstairs,” he decided, but that only made Draco frown.
“I will not push you. But I think at least you should be aware of what your choices really mean if you’re going to make them.”
But it made Draco react before he could stop himself, enveloping Harry to an all-too sentimental hug, that wasn’t even heated.
“Is it scary to know? That I would even die for you, anytime?” Harry teased, and hell, if his partner wasn’t underage, he’d even kiss Fayre. He figured it out. She loved him back, it wasn’t just him; all along.
“They are cute,” Severus noted, along with Harry who just muttered something along the lines “I like the kid”.
“If Purebloods learn everything from a tutor and stay at home until the age of 11, how do they socialize?” Harry asked because he wanted Draco to consider letting Severus attend some Muggle pre-school from September.
Just as he took a look at it, and Malfoy’s eyes followed Harry’s, Malfoy visibly flinched. So Harry got the sense that the small bag was Malfoy’s and somehow extremely important, yet he must have lost it when the crystal blew them apart.
When they got to Diagon Alley, however, Severus grabbed Draco’s hand much stronger and hid behind him any time another magical just passed them on the street, looking terrified and almost crying, so Draco quickly took him home.
But then when Harry got to the Library, Severus was reading by himself, and Mindy was watching over him.
“I left Severus in the other wing when we talked, with the said elves,” Harry sighed. “And spelled the room so we wouldn’t be overheard.”
“We have checked everything for tracing charms, keep changing our appearances, even our habits,” Harry misunderstood, thinking the other wizard couldn’t sleep because of Eileen hunting them. “We have all sorts of shields on Severus, so even if she tried a summoning spell or anything similar, she’d get nothing. But-“
“Why don’t we rather mention that if we don’t want Ed to be fired we can’t let this happen?” Draco stopped her. “He’s a Headmaster dealing with young witches and wizards every day. If it comes out that he’s
“And so, next thing I know, he used Muggle ways and all his money to find us, and one day when I returned home, I have found him over the dead body of Tobias,” she blinked back tears. “By the time I got back, he had his powers back and was waiting to kill me too. I barely escaped and faked my death, but it was too late. Edwin only wanted to punish his parents first, but once he got the taste of magical power, he would have done anything to find more. And he saw Severus in my mind, just as you and your husband. So he killed Voldemort and took over his army and titles. As far as I know, Harry sacrificed himself to get you out when you couldn’t save Severus from him before he dueled my son and lost.”
Draco knew more about the materials and the additional spells they bought for Severus’ clothing, while Harry seemed happy to explain anything about Quidditch when they bought also a kid broom and helped Severus to be less nervous when they got him a toy wand.
Lucius wanted to make him take back “the nonsense” of being gay, and at the heat of the moment, magically disowned him, which meant Malfoy couldn’t longer return to the Manor, lost all assets of money from the Malfoys, and couldn’t even be called a Malfoy anymore, not having a surname any longer.
Eileen was ready to shut the door right on Draco’s face no matter how Tobias wasn’t around when Harry stopped her.
telling me to do,” Harry said, and then when he realized how it sounded, he was afraid for the repercussion or some degrading comment, but Draco only gave him a tired chuckle.
“Which spell can be only undone by Tobias’ death, or the caster of the spell. If we speak with Eileen anyway, we should do it when Tobias is not there, and also rescue her. We have her memories now, of a life she said she wouldn’t repeat, maybe she could be finally convinced.”
“It’s not about who is right but about whose suggestion it is, isn't it?” Fayre grimaced. “You won’t hear me out because of the past! Even if it means you’re killing your own husband!”
“Wait, Dra-wait,” Harry tried to keep up with Draco, who was now fumingly running away under the pretense of looking for the elves. “I wasn’t-I’m not dating anyone. You should know this as well, when would I have the time? I have been constantly working or spending time with you and Severus.”
“Funnily, my father probably would have made me marry her. Severus was the only one who knew and accepted me,” Draco had to bite his cheek from carrying on with that thought.
“This is my daughter, Clara. My partner, Noel, took it on himself to use a highly risky spell to carry her and didn’t survive her birth. I would have done it myself, except I’m almost a Squib, only feeling other’s magic,” he told the little girl to go and buy some sweets, only then adding. “And you have such a magnificent power Harry, it’s makes me wonder what other talents of yours could I see if I could get to know you a little better.”
Luckily, Harry had no reason to think Draco would be hit on by anyone else. He barely left the secluded wizarding area where everyone was either married or less than 12 years old.
Her captor had a lot of information about Potter and tried to get to him by his friends, but they were invincible enough not to be a problem, so he sought out Fayre because she was the weak link in Harry’s life, one which Harry himself didn’t even choose to be with, was only forced to.
“I just bought it. Galleons worth a little bit more in the past, can you imagine?” the blond motioned around at the space. “You can have any room in the left-wing, I have already chosen one in the right, where Pinky had also helped me set the Library up which you can use as well, by the way. I’ll have meals at 7, 12, and 6 o’clock if you want to join, or ask Mindy to serve your meals whenever you prefer.”
But if he had to choose, wouldn’t it be better to get out of there quickly, before Draco told Potter something he’d regret? And how would he be able to be happy with Harry, knowing it was him who kept Harry away from someone else, who might have fit Potter better?
“He was tracking a bunch of Death Eaters,” Hermione explained to Harry. “I think… I don’t even know…”
He barely caught sight of a torn “Undesirable Number One” poster and went to find Harry on it - only looking decades older - when he was attacked.
“And you had everything I didn’t have,” Harry shrugged. “The only common thing we probably have is suffering. We both have seen some shit, but always got over it.”
“I never killed anyone, but for you, I think I’ll don’t have the problem mastering up a killing curse, you bastard,” Harry said, making Hermione nervous.
“We sleep, and never talk about this ever again. I don’t want to hear about your fabulous boyfriends, and you have no reason to tell me anyway,” Draco raised his hand and saw the hurt in Harry’s eyes when he told him the second part, but it was only fair. If Potter hurt him badly, at least he should also know how that feels. “Tomorrow, we figure out how to get out of here, and you move out.”
“Malfoys. Good taste and always eager to make more money,” Draco muttered because it wasn’t a bad idea, but from the description only, Harry could have worked with any number of his ancestors.
He let his anger get a better of him once, and he almost killed the blond. Harry had just seen the scars for Merlin’s sake.
“5 minutes, but only because I owe you for helping me,” she sighed as if giving up. “And if for any reason my husband would show up, you both need to Apparate out without him even seeing you were here.”
Hi!! TBH I find it extremely difficult to write kid characters (dealing with tiny humans are further from my expertise than the Moon to Earth), but I hope both Sev and Ed (just as Drarry!) are cute enough together so you guys will like this chapter anyway.
Then again, Fayre too went ahead and called Harry a virgin as if he was laughable. (Which he was, Lucius did laugh at him a lot when he ran for his life after
Harry got up first. To say that he was surprised was an understatement when he woke up with the very naked Draco Malfoy snuggled close to Harry, his expression completely different from the Draco Malfoy he was when awake.
“Any relationship between us,” Draco wasn’t used to conversation direct as this and felt quite silly talking about it. “Because after anything remotely serious, we’d be back at each other’s throats again, with Severus caught in the middle.”
“I have a counter-offer,” Harry kissed the blond. “If you don’t interfere at all for the let’s say… next two years, I will owe you a reward.”
“Even if that’s the case, we’d travel blind. We changed things, so we have no way of knowing what would we find,” Draco wasn’t entertained.
And he tried to keep Draco happy while trying to not hit on the blond. But how were they supposed to live their whole lives only having each other as constant, yet acting as if they were divorcees, only tolerating each other for the sake of the kid?
“Well then, I’m sorry to have scared you,” Draco said, maybe even grinning to hide his irritation as only a Slytherin would. “But Tobias was trying to hurt his son and I will not stand for that. No matter what you say, or how your new-found concern for me goes, I will do—“
“I have magic and you don’t. So I could say you’re the unwise one, provoking me in when I could just teach you a lesson,” Draco said.
“We are only traveling through, and will be gone by tomorrow,” he lied, keeping a potential friend from Severus away, yet knowing full-well he wouldn't want this other wizard meet Draco.
It wasn’t like Harry was expecting miracles, but he wanted Severus to accept Edwin at least at that moment, and quite forgot about their conversation later, but Severus didn’t.
So he pulled out a chair next to the Library table, sitting down a few chairs up from the kid. So much for a bit quiet reading, after he had spent two hours in the attic, cleaning up centuries-old dust and curses (not to mention Pixie "dust"), it seemed.
“No, seriously, it sounds like something only Lucious would say,” Harry knew how only provoking a Malfoy would work to get any reaction back given that Fayre was still probably deeply hurt by not Harry nor Hermione trusting her, so he chose to use that.
Not that anything happened, and even if something would have, Draco was no longer a clueless teenager he once was when he dated a Drumstang student in his fourth year, not to mention his
Also, though Hermione did manage to find the wiretapping device that was sent magically to Harry’s place through complex magic and assured him that it won’t ever happen again, and he’s safe, he never again felt like he was.
Even if there were decades between this time and Draco’s, nothing seemed to change in their dynamics. And that was the best. Nothing else could have put Draco’s worries to rest any better.
“You don’t need different glasses for reading?” Severus asked Harry, while he took away Harry’s book to read the title. “Why are you reading about Time magic? Can I also study it with you?”
There seemed to be no escaping fate, and Draco had pulled Harry into this futile fight for nothing, but Potter just held him.
“When I had him, he was put up for adoption, and I only kept watch on him from afar because I thought your husband would want to rescue him.”
“We transfigure our looks, and legally marry before we go,” Harry quickly said. He already joked with this once, but now it wasn’t a choice. Before Draco could object, he quickly explained. “We’d pull attention if we went as 3 strangers traveling together. However, if married, and would buy or rent any property together, having the magical documents about it…”
Harry didn’t have to look into the mirror to know he aged, as well as Severus, so he didn’t have to struggle to come up with the first one.
“I don’t see how that’s a good idea,” it was Potter who could stay calm enough to say. Draco was already so furious it was better if he didn’t ruin anything quickly by speaking his mind.
Only, one day he woke up throwing up, and with memories that certainly hadn’t happened yet, but were terrifying.
“What’s wrong?” little Severus stood in the door, making them both fall silent quickly. “What’s happening?”
With a change of heart, she felt like she should convince him not to give up, so she kinda went to his table with a drink, originally planning to leave any second she felt like she accomplished that.
Only, he didn’t crave any contact from people he didn’t know, right? He sighed again, trying to keep his mind focused.
“I believe in you,” Harry said. “Plus, your Patronus might just be a magical creature. They are harder to master and might just take longer to get right. That doesn’t mean you don’t have one.”
But his presence also distracted Draco slightly, not to mention Severus, who stopped paying any attention to his lesson the minute his favorite diversion appeared.
Harry would be lying if he couldn’t see a connection between these new sleeping arrangements, and how well he was doing with his research.
“I just wanted to thank you. Severus had been missing Eileen, but he had so much fun just now,” he told Harry as if this was any explanation for the kiss. “I want you to spend time with him as well.”
But the more they traveled, the less interested he seemed to have any friends whom he'd only know for a couple of months.
Harry often just picked up the most practical clothes, and let Draco choose for Sev and Ed, but as the kids grew, they needed less and less consultation about fashion from their Dad.
“Just this once. Sit down and tell us about your humble life, Mr. Potter,” Draco gestured to a chair next to him, and Harry almost felt like he wasn’t even fully acting.
Harry and the rest of the survivors were collecting the dead after the battle. He was still hurt as well, but there was a body he couldn’t let anybody else bring back to the castle.
Who, to his credit, even tried to invite Eileen, but when she didn’t respond, decided to spend all morning with the preparations. He transformed the dining room chairs, decorations, and even the wallpaper to appear more luxurious.
Kind of smart, probably Granger ordered him to do so, but the Death Eater himself noticed this too, if Fayre did, and as long as he spoke, he had control over Harry’s temper.
“No. It’s… I would like to continue studying with Draco, if I could,” Severus stated clearly and politely. “And my mom is okay but… She’s sent me away.”
He couldn’t help but think how some of his Muggle Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin tees, for instance, wouldn’t look half-bad on the blond either.
They ate in complete silence, and it took hours for Harry to speak up, even if there was nothing better they could do, locked in.
However, how should he just sleep with Harry again, if it was only to get them out and send Potter straight to the arms of this other wizard Draco didn’t even know, yet he already made such an impression on Harry?
Hi guys. Tried to skip 6 years in the story, but it didn't work - surprisingly... XD So this is a different approach.
“Are you alright?” still, other Harry had found him. Fate was cruel because he didn’t even age badly…
“Well then, Harry Malfoy, tell your partner that I know he stole my child, so he should come out and talk to me before I go in and burn his house down if necessary to find my son.”
Although, trying to fight off the Death Eaters and healing Eileen at the same time was already an impossible task.
Draco wanted to yell at him for some reason again, but he was also terrified, and Harry spoke the truth.
“Severus, I know you love your mom,” Harry hunkered down to face the child from his height. “But do you think if she came to take you back you’d want to go with her?”
Harry was always home after work, often entertaining Mindy, Pinky, and Severus by cooking something without magic for dinner.
And she did, she even saved Ron even though Harry and Hermione tried to stop her from doing that, and Malfoy never especially liked Ron, did he?
“I know,” Potter said, surprisingly, when Draco expected a lecture if not some resistance, given that they weren’t Severus’ parents.
That made her think of the scenario as a free pass at sleeping with Potter because if she was careful, he’d never figure out. Suddenly, she felt curious.
“I know,” Draco sighed. “And I also don’t have any legal claim on Severus as my son, so I can’t even open an account in Gringotts for him, and they’d figure that soon as well. But it means I also cannot send him to a Muggle pre-school either because we don’t have any of the paperwork they’d need for registration. Even if I thought the Muggle rubbish they teach there was worth it.”
As we're almost done, I do hope everyone reading enjoyed it nevertheless, and that I could do justice to the prompt still. Love you guys! XOXO
“And what are you trying to accomplish, offering them up to me now?” Eileen replied by using Legilimency as well. “If I’m right and you—“
“They have to hunt down magicals to work for them, so when he overheard I was a capable wizard who just arrived, he had at least 3 jobs in mind I could do,” Harry explained. “He might want me to do all three, come to think of it.”
Harry had seen so many futures. Now every time he was dreaming, futures that never came true flashed in front of his eyes.
Except almost getting hurt when a spell bounced back, as if all the room was sealed off, so Harry had to throw up a shield, keeping them both safe.
He usually couldn't be bothered how no one asked his opinion and would give you it anyway loud and clear. Just as he had an annoying habit of meddling into other people's personal business as if it concerned him, that's how he got to this time in the first place.
“Admittedly you only started meddling with time because you knew I couldn’t let you go into the past alone. So even if it would seem like I made the first move, you only performed the spell when I got there because you wanted me to interfere,” Harry, however, stood his ground as well in the teasing.
But Severus being 4 meant he already knew his parents, even if Draco was quite convinced in Tobias’ case it wasn’t a good thing, Severus had never mentioned his mother. What if she really cared for him?
It described how the crystal mysteriously disappeared from the Malfoy Vault the day Harry and Draco had arrived here, "as if it dispersed into thin air", triggering a magical alarm, yet the Aurors finding the wards of the Vault completely intact.
“It’s not you and Dad’s ‘fault’,” Edwin answered the questions even if Harry didn’t technically ask them. “And I have told Severus this as well, but he thinks I'm only lying to make him feel better, so after a while, I figured I stop insisting on it. It doesn't make any difference since I'll never have the time for a serious relationship anyway.”
“I need to take him to the others,” was all Harry has managed to say then, making Draco jump, and grab a wand that wasn’t even his.
They also talked a lot about their partners, and even if Harry had a real relationship with someone else, he always told the group incredible stories of how they first met with Draco and he fell in love at first sight, how he proposed, and generally how in love they were.
“No, I’ll only change his hair color to match mine, it should add to our cover,” Draco said. “But you know this all still might not be enough? They could use several rituals to find someone who is related by blood to them. Even if some take a lot of time to prepare, and some key ingredients cost a lot of money.”
Only, Draco couldn’t help but notice Saint Potter was also ready to jump the other man who was almost as big as the gamekeeper in Hogwarts, completely ignoring Draco who tried to stop him.
“Tobias might have meant the world to me once, but I had to lose him to get some perspective. All along I thought if I just loved him well enough I could change him,  and we could be happy together, blaming myself. I forgot how strong I was before I met him, but once I had no other choice, I realized I could face everything alone just as fine, if not better.”
They ended up on the floor, and with Malfoy under him, struggling. Every time Harry had daydreamed about this happening, he never imagined this, but even before he could finish that line of thought, the crystal in Malfoy’s hands suddenly emitted a blinding light and a deafening noise, pushing them both back into the air.
“Hi cutie, what’s up? You look sad. Can I cheer you up? I’ll buy you another,” a random girl offered, and she looked nice. Harry thought how he could use the distraction from the Malfoys altogether, so he just nodded, and the girl just looked even better when she smiled at him in return.
Harry tried not to stare, really. Malfoy almost could pass for a beautiful witch now, but Harry knew full-well he wasn’t one, and that even made Harry find him more attractive.
“Alright, so you figured it out,” Potter huffed, suddenly pulling Draco close by the edge of his sweater with a look in his eyes that didn't promise anything good. “I am attracted to you Malfoy, and I care about you just enough that I don’t want to see you die a horrible death. Could you stop constantly teasing me about it and make me understand—“
It was a challenge but Lucius, as any pureblood would, had to ensure his bloodline continued and was not mixed with anything like the Weasleys or the Granger girl.
, Harry,” Malfoy never really called him by his first name without Severus being present, and Harry knew it was to make him accept something he wasn’t willing to accept. “And I would rescue this other child as well, but not if we put Severus in danger in return.”
“Because I couldn’t find you earlier. Up until the moment your magical signature just resurfaced, which no doubt drew the Death Eaters to you as well. What were you thinking, going to a public place just like that, anyway?”
I am planning on writing some M/M pairing (slash, yaoi, you know, the good stuff) fics which I prefer(this fic was quite vanilla let's admit it), but every once in ten years, it's funny to have a heroine (sorta) to work with.
“These are all moments where Draco Malfoy should have accomplished something to get the next stage of their lives, yet failed to do so. The person you are looking for is dispersed into all these memories, trying to get it right just once, so that they can step into the next step of personal development.”
“We were. Or at least I was delusional enough to believe we were. But I’m glad it turned out we aren’t” Fayre told Hermione with an emotionless mask Harry has so many times saw on Malfoy, but never on Fayre. It hurt him that they have come to this. “Better sooner than later, right?”
“You wove together some ancient Asian spells, and you sealed the power of your unborn child into your husband,” Draco looked at her. He could scream, hearing a magical was punished to be a Squib even before they were born, just to give Tobias magic of all people, but he couldn’t.
Draco couldn’t believe Harry was talking about them as a couple still, not after what he just told the other wizard.
“I’m special,” the girl said, as if proud. “I live near the start because I never really existed. I only wanted to exist. So no real challenges for me that I could solve.”
Then, Potter had come to him, and had to explain Draco was a girl and working at the Mungo as a nurse - so basically a house-elf in Lucius’ mind - and the pureblood wizard was truly concerned.
Yes. Draco refusing to see him made interfering impossible. Draco knew this, and that’s why he stayed away, Lucius was sure of it. His son was not
“You also said you’d sleep with me,” however, Potter had to drop a bomb, just when Draco thought they were finished for that day. “How much of that was a joke?”
He couldn’t concentrate on the matter at hand though fully. His mind was still at the previous issue, Potter’s “personal” issue.
“Potter, it’s gonna be okay, just don’t let him get to you, will ya?” Fayre warned the Griffindork for what he surprisingly reacted well.
People in this era didn’t look for his faults, direction or reactions. Of course, this also had a price: Harry had also left all his friends behind who survived. That’s why he wanted to return so badly.
"We go to the Malfoy Manor, steal the crystal from your ancestors that still must exist here, and I take you back to the future with it. Easy," Harry said, but the look on Malfoy's face promised something else altogether.
So, Eileen outdid herself, inviting the Brazilian Minister of Magic, who wanted to forge a political alliance more than even have a polite conversation, so Edwin decided to drink quite much just to tolerate him.
Researching dark curses together to produce healing potions for the injured in the war was nice. Since Harry needed to learn something but couldn’t go to school, this quickly became his field of education.
“Oh, I’m sorry!” the criminal laughed, barely starting. “Didn’t realize you still shag Granger, since she got where she is in the Ministry by being a slut, surely, being just a filthy Mudblood.”
And with that, Draco was dressing already, probably to breathe fire on the poor elves, and maybe even tell Severus not to repeat the last week, leaving Harry alone with the plates and papers.
“Remember when you bought a Muggle or Wizarding house cheap, I fixed it up with both magic and Muggle ways, you redecorated it and Eileen had found us so we had to sell it quickly to move somewhere else?”
For some reason even unknown to her, she followed him to a Muggle club, disguising her with a Polyjuice potion she coincidentally always carried around for emergencies  - not that this was one.
So, since all the books told how the curse locks people in their heads and never lets them go, playing cruel tricks on them - Harry decided to use the Elder Wands’ power to enter Fayre’s mind.
But maybe thinking that if nothing terrible happened in the last three months, it’s not a sign of how something even worse was in a making, and he really should believe it, he thought.
“I don’t think I have the power to muster up a Patronus. I can barely stand, Fayre,” he told the blond. He was still dying, even though he wanted to live more than ever. “You could do it, though.”
Draco tried to answer, to tell Harry everything, but he was so drained magically, every time he regained consciousness, he couldn’t keep his eyes open enough to even start.
“This is your fault, so don’t you tell me to calm down!” Draco turned on his heels. “First, it was your brilliant idea to free the wretched elves…”
Harry was hurt by multiple nasty battle-spells just hours before (not to mention he kinda died before that), and he was pretty sure his ankle broke the minute he landed wrong arriving here - wherever they were now.
“Oh, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to... I mean I just thought you must be hungry… which you can be, but I just assumed - for solid food, you know…”
“Wait, we need to buy newspapers every day for—“ Harry tried, but was cut short when the elf Apparated away.
you know,” Severus told him. “But she kept talking to Clara and braided her hair, so I wanted to be next.”
“What’s going on, Malfoy?” he asked, his stare bearing holes into Draco as if Draco had done something wrong. And maybe he did, but he didn't appreciate Potter pointing it out.
“Hey, we won’t let them do anything,” Harry noticed where Draco’s thoughts were going probably only by his frown.
“Stay out of this, Potter,” Malfoy only said, giving him an irritated stare, while Harry considered doing just that.
"We should also teach Harry," Severus then pulled Draco in front of Harry, who was sitting at the table still. "You did say, ma'am, that only today he can join us."
Harry only could blame himself when he fell off the blanket because he was laughing too hard. Then, he had to pretend to die on the grass, which was - of course - dangerous, molten lava, and got a sequel part as a Sea Monster next.
Harry never admitted it, but some mornings Fayre being so close to him, he considered dating her for real.
Maybe he told himself he didn’t care about his looks because at one time he couldn’t afford to. And he never knew he could look better than decent.
“I didn’t count on you having the wand, Potter, I must admit,” he then said. “You either have more balls than I thought or just real stupid and love with this traitor more than I even estimated!”
With the spell he wrote himself, he achieved the same kind of magic a Pensieve would have, only backward, transporting him to Fayre’s mind instead of the memories.
“And it’s not only that, Severus can understand it,” Draco smiled when Harry sat down as quietly as he could, not to disturb this moment.
“Fine, but if anyone touches you, I’ll make sure they’ll lose an arm,” Draco shrugged, and when Harry gave him a look, he went back on that. “Okay, I won’t curse you with that particular charm, but only because I trust you.”
“I wasn’t talking about your boss, Potter. I was talking about the wizard or witch you’ve been seeing for months.”
“Where to exactly?” Harry reached for Draco’s extended right asking, only to find himself in front of a house that almost looked like a simple Muggle house from the outside.
As Fayre, Harry didn’t know how she was slimmer than her usual self because when he got to know her, she was already this slim. As Draco, however, Harry could compare to memory, and the difference was shocking.
But that could also go wrong very fast, and Severus deserved better than another fallout. Even now, the small child was underweight, way too quiet for his age, and had nightmares every day.
“I’m more concerned about his son. I mean Draco is a pampered being, it’s just… not healthy for him to stay hidden for so long, without even financial aid from his mother. Narcissa is as worried about him as me,” Harry admitted the whole truth, something he didn’t even tell Hermione because he was concerned she would find him strange for worrying over their arch enemy, but he did worry.
I'd also like to thank Trickster for the prompt once again, she is creative, isn't she, with so many ideas that she can't even execute them all, so she gave me one... <3
“I am from the future, and I owe your son even more than a life-debt. He’s my only family. If you can read my mind you’ll know I’m not lying,” Draco in the meanwhile tried to convince Eileen no matter what it took. “And he’ll be unhappy here, Eileen, just as you already are now, hurting. Please, let me just help you both.”
Harry only noticed he had found the Muggle park from Snape’s memories once he was already walking on the grass. And soon he caught a glimpse of Severus hiding behind a tree, seemingly unharmed. So he could send a Patronus to Eileen telling her where he was.
Back in this time, all this didn’t happen yet, but if Eileen knew somehow they were in the US for sure, then they couldn't just stay.
“I thought you said he wasn’t your partner! And I spelled him out of the house to save him, so there is no need to thank me!” she yelled back, and Harry could see the Snape family resemblance much more clearly than before.
“Oh, you poor dragon-egg-shell, you must be shocked to lay eyes on a Malfoy with their full grace!” Fayre told him, and Harry couldn’t hold back a laugh.
“We only stay a couple of hours at most, I have modified the spell that it would expire,” Harry said, proud.
Harry was out front, trying to fix the wards, contemplating calling a Healer to see Draco if his condition wouldn't improve soon when a woman appeared.
“This means you haven’t even tried it?” Draco bit into one, which was... surprisingly good. He could get used to breakfast in bed, even if it wasn’t an especially healthy one.
“You can’t change the past. Whatever happens, already happened, so what’s the point?” Harry couldn’t believe it. But he knew Malfoy too well. He wasn’t lying, and the irritated look on his face told Harry that the Malfoys could
“Do you think it’s Eileen? She somehow brainwashed our elves and she could be here any second?” Malfoy paled, now trying any way out of the room, trying to open the windows, trying to blow up the walls, just as Harry did, accomplishing nothing.
“I might not be Saint Potter, but if you ride with Severus, your balance will be off, and you’ll be much slower,” Malfoy now smiled an evil smile, which Harry didn’t know he could miss.
Truth was, he missed the grim future less and less, and he didn’t want to just leave, so he was just contempt not using what he discovered for now.
He might have been just smiling politely at a handsome stranger on the market - they couldn’t send the elves because it was a Muggle one, and they didn’t want their Disillusionment Charms somehow alert Eileen outside of their heavily warded house - who then smiled back.
“Don’t get me wrong, it’s nice to be on the same page with you just this once, but-“ Draco was trying to explain how nice it was that he didn’t have to fight Potter with his restlessness this time, but that was when the Boy-Who-Lived stopped him.
Draco only later guessed at how the other wizard started seeing somebody soon after starting his new job when he once saw a hickey on Harry’s neck, but he couldn’t even ask.
“Because you’re strong - enough to face two accomplished wizards on your own. Just as both of your sons are. So would you let both of them suffer, just because you didn’t even hear us out? I don’t think so.”
“Is there anything else you’d like to do?” Harry had no idea what someone like Severus Snape wanted to do with his free time when he was just 4, but maybe the kid had some ideas, and Harry could just leave them with Draco to it.
Knowing this, he’d have to play Dragon, and make him think he didn’t want Draco to date Potter, and that would for certain ensure Draco in fact,
Even if it meant he had to team up with someone who just as much caused this grim future as himself.
But hopefully you guys will see why I decided to detail a bit how the Drarry dynamics shifted even before Severus could be brought in. XOXO
Draco couldn’t help but feel betrayed, and as if it was a direct result of their not even argument-argument yesterday.
Harry was too curious, but then almost left the market, thinking it was stupid to appear 3 weeks later when Eileen could find them any time now, already spending too much time in one place.
Harry thought Draco had magical activities covered with Severus, so he tried to think what Muggles would do with their kids.
“Oh, I had many interesting fights, young Prince. I rode a dragon, fought a Troll, and faced the fury of a Transfiguration teacher who had found me outside my house quarters in the middle of the night,” Harry even changed his voice, only noticing later how much he sounded like Dumbledore when he was talking to young Harry. Keeping things from him, thinking Harry was too young to know. So he quickly stopped, trying to channel Remus a bit instead. “But the scariest of it all was a creature called the Boggart. I had met one living in a cupboard, and it shows everyone their greatest fear.”
Here is what you need to know to read on: They somehow manage to get out of the room, let's just say.
Sometimes, though, it wasn’t easy. Like when he finally got home from Lucius, and Fayre just sensed his bad mood and bought him a Butterbeer without a word, one in front of Harry, on in front of her.
“Shut up,” Draco, however, changed to Fayre within a blink of an eye. “Shut up and take us out of here so I can kiss you for real, making you realize you’d never want that damned Veela even if he’s blonder and taller than me—”
Harry realized she was right, in the sense that comforting Hermione could come after they had managed to save Ron’s life. Fayre was so rude about it though!
“But the thing is, Harry… I can’t help!” and she truly looked like she was sharing Ron’s curse she looked so miserable.
“But we wouldn’t be able to collect said ingredients just a trek away, and meet the donkey my Muggle guide introduced me to when I first went.”
Memories flashed before Harry’s eyes of the dead, and the excruciating grief he felt, and the knowledge that as Master of Death, even if he bought back the people they have lost, like Lupin and Tonks and Fred, they’d be never the same as before.
“So, we won’t keep you for long,” Eileen announced. “We’re extremely grateful that you helped us looking after Severus, but we’re here to get him back.”
“You know what, why don’t you stay, and finish dinner with me? I’m quite sure Carlos wouldn’t mind if he knew I asked you to keep me company,” suddenly, Ed just asked the secretary, who was…
“Why don’t you ask me directly someday and see?” Draco laughed. Salazar, maybe if Potter was abysmal in bed, he could be finally over this stupid crush once and for all. “But only if you truly want to hear the answer.”
The more he thought about it, the more he couldn’t believe it. He was so deep in his thoughts, he almost jumped when Ron spoke up.
“Or…maybe your clothing is not the usual way?” but as he looked at Potter it was still way below the price-range Potter could
“I thought you said this time had to be saved so we have to be extremely careful, and now you’re picking a fight?” he tried to pull Potter away, lowering his voice so others couldn’t hear.
Meanwhile, Fayre had time to check what wand they were talking about. She only had to glance at the thing and realized what was going on.
I apologize for Lucius being racist, rude or/and just too much if he is in this chapter. He's great to write with but even I didn't see all of this coming and I have the whole fic planned out.
“You don’t think there is more to you than your good looks and Quidditch moves?” Draco suddenly was leaning quite close again, keeping eye contact, but then turning away. “Anyway, it wasn’t a request. Eileen herself said you’ll have to be involved, and you promised. Plus, I still employ you. So if I tell you to be a babysitter for a couple of hours every day, you’ll do it without as much of as a single complaint.”
“Give us at least a day to say goodbye to Severus, you owe us that much,” Potter grabbed Draco’s hand as if he sensed what Draco was thinking again, stopping him. “And in the meanwhile, consult the Goblins in Gringotts to draw up the adoption form for your second child, because we’re going to take him in. We’ll negotiate the price you had in mind later.”
“He can sense strong emotions even if just accidentally, and thought I’d only keep him as long as I am happy,” Draco pushed the topic further, forcing himself to say.
“I guess… losing someone you care about can be extremely scary, Severus,” Harry decided he won’t be like Dumbledore, after all. He may not go into the details of war, but he won’t lie either.
“Believe it or not, I had time to rethink my decisions, and I much rather would give up both my boys willingly if I knew they would be cared for than have this future,” she said.
Draco appeared after 20 minutes, saying he had some urgent business to take care of, and took over Severus’ lessons while Harry went to the kitchen to talk with Mindy and Pinky.
“He’s still missing,” Hermione lied so easily, that Harry began to think if she was so used to lying, it must be true. Fayre was Malfoy. And she also just saved Ron’s life while Harry and Hermione did everything to stop her, insulting her.
“I do have a couple of ideas,” Harry agreed after his first shock. Some ideas that he had to Occlude pretty hard away to the back of his mind when the kids were back for summer.
Ed just drowned some more wine thinking he’d have to do this twice now, but he also needed to talk about reestablishing certain exchange student programs with Carlos.
All in all, Harry was busy and didn’t have the time to be depressed about being even more famous, and at Grimmauld Place, he was unreachable to the media, at least. Also, he figured that if he didn’t think about the mornings, he liked Fayre.
He also had access to restricted books and spent every afternoon with reading and Severus, joined by Draco for dinners or when they were socializing.
“So I’m what? A method to keep you happy?” Harry’s question wasn’t dismissing. Rather, it sounded hopeful, so Draco’s lowered gaze darted back at him.
Draco didn’t escape from that time just to go back there again, but it was useless arguing about it now when Potter was yet to obtain the crystal he needed for a way back.
They didn’t last more than 3 rounds of clothing before even Draco couldn’t care about the clothes anymore, and they ended up in bed, Draco delivering on his promise in a magnificent way.
Harry tried to speak to both the first year himself and Draco, hell, even Ron, but he was completely ignored.
Severus used a charm to balance out a blanket quite elegantly, and once Draco made sure they couldn't be levitated too high, the game had only started.
“I’d like to think, but then explain why someone gave Severus the impression I’d be proud of him if only he could care about his brother a little more.”
“He can’t even be Obliviated,” she then wiped her eyes and looked at Harry with a new determination. “If I leave him, he might tell others, or try to hunt us all down.”
“Just be ready because when we find him, you owe him a hell of an apology,” he warned Lucius to seemingly get the last word.
“I’m not… we’re not partners,” Harry prayed he didn’t blush while saying that, but also, he was trying to understand what had Draco gotten himself into. “And apart from myself, 2 elves and Draco, I can assure you there is no one else on this property.”
So what you guys think so far? Where is Malfoy? What happened to Ron? I admit, I chose Fayre's name carefully, do you guys know why?
“He isn’t that person yet, and I’d fight for him not to ever be. Just as Severus would, and you know that.”
He couldn’t remember ever playing games as a child, so he didn’t have many ideas, but Severus missed his mother, if not his father as well (which was not a happy thought for Draco, but it could happen).
He almost got a heart attack when Severus tripped over his clothes once falling on the ball, but when he ran to the kid expecting crying, Severus threw the transfigured ball at him with a small evil smile, soccer completely forgotten, playing dodgeball instead.
He tried all forms of communication. Asked the little kid to help him, but nothing really happened. Then Harry tried to intervene.
“You really should ask Draco about anything you want to do, I’m quite busy with things that would only bore you, and he’s the one taking care of you,” Harry knew Draco wanted what was best for Severus, even if his schedule was probably taxing for a child.
Salazar, Draco’s only luck was that he froze on the spot the minute Potter touched him, so at least he was too shocked to show any reaction he might have otherwise had.
Only, then Potter appeared as well, sitting to the other end of the long library table. He researched Time-magic sometimes and even studied some seventh-year materials, so Draco assumed that’s what he was doing.
The hatemail Ginny got was, however, totally unacceptable. Harry felt responsible for her, and it hurt him more than his own shame ever could.
“I can’t just go back as if nothing happened,” he took the other side of the tub, still quite short for the both of them, but at least he could see Draco’s expression.
The realization hit Draco after he’d already moved to kiss Harry, initiating the contact, comforting him, until the Wizard-Who-Lived calmed down.
Draco paid the Goblins a good amount of money to get rid of the Horcruxes once he got to know what they were from Potter, and the Goblins agreed, eager to keep the magical objects Voldemort used to make them - but if Voldemort shouldn’t be still around, why was Harry on the posters?
It was one of those times. When Draco regretted not dating Harry. It would have been so easy to imagine it would be perfect when Harry was doing so great with Severus like this.
Hermione kinda forbid him to do so, because if he was unsuccessful saving Fayre he’d end up in the same coma too, plus Hermione didn’t advise Harry to use the wand any longer, and most of the cases Harry would agree, but this case was special.
Fayre even knew about the Longbottoms and had this big project of helping people with illnesses relating to the Crucio, and although she didn’t get far yet, Harry admired her for trying.
Someone wasn’t satisfied when Harry won the war. One person on the side of the “Light” wanted to further punish someone “Dark”, yelling it was to revenge a life of a dear relative who was already dead. However, that one curse reignited the battle which turned into bloodshed.
“This is my home, in case you are wondering,” Severus gestured around. “Ed will also come, he’s just probably got held up. So, what do you want to know?”
Lucius was in a bit of a pickle. He liked Draco so much as a child he didn’t raise him right. The boy ended up being faint-hearted for a Malfoy and didn’t respect his father at all. Meanwhile, he was so amazingly stupid which both entertained and annoyed his father a great deal.
“Which one is it going to be?” Harry asked, since the Death Eater only looked from them to another, still holding a wand at Fayre’s throat, trying to figure out something.
“I would like to adopt you officially one day if I could, Severus,” Draco also joined them squatting down, talking to Severus quite frankly. “Only, then we have to leave. Would you like to come with me and Harry, until we can figure it out?”
It was only so far shields and clever Disillusions got them, it seemed, and she has been hit with something that resembled Sectumsepra much, but couldn’t have been the same, because Draco couldn’t heal her.
However, searching-spells put aside, Harry wasn’t sure he was on the right track at all. One thing didn’t let his mind rest.
The Ministry wanted to limit Potion researches because they were dangerous, but also then how should discoveries be made?
Harry could have yelled at the blond then, but only because it didn't sit well with him how Draco put himself in grave danger only to then pretend as if nothing happened, taking it too lightly.
Not only he invited the young man inappropriately to dine with him but forced him to confess something personal.
“Mr. Potter, thank you. I honestly don’t want to inconvenience you any further. I accept my son cannot think to come to me now, I’ll be patient about that. One last thing, though,” he said, and motioned Harry closer.
Dear Merlin, Ed could tell the kid was quite smart, just by how he took care of everything from Carlos’s shadow, but it’s not like Ed knew his name even.
“Well then, where is my child?!” she demanded. “Where else could he have taken him? Or do you think it’s a coincidence your
That was a low blow. Lucius wasn’t as perfect-looking as he used to be, but he did have showers every day and was perfectly clean, if not coated in silk, this was the least. He decided to ignore the boy’s rudeness and guess again.
“Forget I said that,” Harry sighed, noticing how Hermione's expression was obviously worried so he better shut the whole thing down. “I should probably get going anyway.”
“If Draco is no longer the heir of the Malfoy line, how could he have used this? Also, Lucius never mentioned—”
But, as the day progressed, he wanted to spend time with the older Harry but also wasn’t sure he should, so ended up in their Library, hiding.
“Whatever they want, we can’t let them take him back,” Draco’s stomach was in a knot. If Eileen was willing to compromise the only safe place for her son, something was up. And Draco had a gut feeling he won’t like it. “Even if there is a dispute, Severus stays until we can settle it.”
If having someone in a different city, during the day, made Harry this confident, relaxed and joyful, which resulted in him being so patient and great with Severus after work-hours, Draco half-wished Harry would never break up with this other person.
So this was all, I guess? I might add a bonus chapter at some point, a sort of happy ever after thing, but otherwise, this fic is done.
So it was a kind of a trap with memories, Harry noted. Maybe if he could destroy them or something, would it free Fayre in the real world?
“I know, but Harry is a good servant,” Severus defended Harry, and then added. “You should just get to know him a little better to see.”
As he calculated, Malfoy - now Fayre, but still pretty light-skinned - got so mad that her face went red and almost shouted the bejesus out of Harry.
But, with Malfoy being busy parenting, and Harry and him trying to act mature around one another, they didn’t have a chance to act as once they did in the last couple of months.
“You have ugly clothes too,” he pointed at Harry, but all that was forgotten, when Eileen Apparated right next to them. First, she checked if Severus wasn’t hurt in any way, then hugged him close, with tears in her eyes, telling him he should never do something like this again.
“There are a lot of things that could be scary, Severus. So why don’t we just ask the elves for some music, I’m sure your royal cousin and you can show me some dances of the court.”
He thought so too, that Fayre was trying to correct the mistakes Draco has made, conveniently having a spell to change himself into a new person.
+ Sorry for the missed update last week, I had to rewrite this whole chapter 'cause - even though I have the whole plot already - the wording somehow wasn't right. Hoping it's somewhat better now.
“Admittedly, I did hate him. Just as he hated me,” Harry quickly explained, terrified she won’t hear him out. “But all that has changed, you can check. I wouldn’t be here otherwise. Please don’t throw me out before you know the whole story.”
Now, old currency was pureblood-ness. The elite was who held the title. It was still important because it was a tool to see what kind of family the other party comes from since the families all heard about the others.
“I’m here to save you. And your son. To give you a home you both deserve,” the blond wizard found himself arguing while he also used a spell to magic some purchase under his feet, using it as leverage when he next pushed Tobias away.
It was just too much. He wanted this limelight to finally end. So he caved himself up in Grimmauld place where only Hermione and the Weasleys could meet him face to face and tried not to leave unless it was absolutely necessary.
“That’s all very nice and good, but a child needs consistency. We can’t just take in Severus for months at a time, until you figure things out again, just to have you take him back and—“ Draco started, but Eileen just let go of Tobias’ hand.
Investments helped Draco relax, they weren’t making trouble. Nor was schooling Severus, and Draco’s hobby was reading, and books they had plenty.
“What do you want in exchange?” he asked. Malfoy clearly didn’t expect any objections from his side, but Harry was confused.
Draco wouldn’t meet him neither listen to him. In fact, he’d do anything just to oppose his wise, noble father.
He felt like he was cheating, but he wasn’t. He couldn’t have been, given that Malfoy and he weren’t a real couple.
Potter was lying because the truth was so bad he couldn’t even tell a convict. Now-now, who would have thought a person could enjoy a sweet torturing People’s-Favourite-Hero even from prison! Lucius could hardly hold back a content smile. He was enjoying this.
I hope you could forgive me if Severus is a relatively clever 4-year-old, who can at least express himself in complete sentences, and you know, generally more grown-up as we'll see in the upcoming chapters as well?
Then, her mind kindly reminded her that Harry had never even seen her apartment, so she could just take him home, and he wouldn’t even realize who she was.
“Mrs. Snape, I don’t know what happened to your son, but if it was this morning, it couldn’t have been Malfoy,” he admitted. “He came home badly hurt yesterday, and hasn’t been up since.”
“That’s what I thought, but as you so kindly put it, I only replaced Voldemort with your son, and nothing changed in the grand scheme of things,” Draco told her. He was shaking, and he wasn’t sure why he was still alive if everything was taken away from him this way.
“Have you met me, Potter?” Fayre laughed, but totally not in a happy way. “Death Eaters don’t have pleasant memories! They can’t produce a Patronus. We’re both dead at this point!”
Harry was so drawn to research, with this new lead, he only took a break to bake a cake with Severus in the afternoon (Severus’ choice).
Maybe he was just terrified and as exhausted as Draco was, and his control slipped only for a second because the next minute he was Occluding and his vulnerability was gone.
“More like… with possibly a great cock,” Harry went so red it was almost funny seeing it, mumbling something if they were to have sex, how it would be the other way around then Draco initially imagined.
“It isn’t a false memory, although it’s something that won’t be easy for you to see,” Harry warned her.
“No more children, no matter their future or their connection to us, or I’ll go crazy, you hear?” Draco one night declared when he finally got to bed, kissing Harry only briefly, from which Harry could guess he was too tired for anything other than sleeping. “We wanted this, but at age four, Severus could talk and almost read, and Edwin-“
And these questions were also a clue where Severus’ mind was wondering, which was a help, and Draco estimated Severus learned this way more than if they had hired him a tutor.
It was the first Harry figured the books’ theory was dead wrong about what actually was happening in Fayre’s mind, but for sure it was more complicated he’d ever expected to be. He just wished his guide would be a bit more mature.
“You’re sending mixed signals, you know. And it wouldn’t be a problem if we didn't share a bed, and I wouldn’t want more than just a hug next,” Harry quite Gryffindorly stated.
“I need you to take him for a couple of weeks, even for the nights. I trust it’s no trouble for you.”
“It would be just for your money of course,” Harry winked at him, which promised something entirely different, making Draco blush.
He went to the war expecting to survive because he always did. He went to Voldemort because at that point he felt like he had no other choice. When it came to the end of the war, he was relieved.
“You think I wouldn’t accept you with a wizard? After all, our Dads-“ Severus questioned Ed while they were swiftly advancing in the Ministry’s building.
“Do you want me in your bed every morning now, Potter?” he asked in a sarcastic voice, not really waiting for an answer. He charmed his only suitcase for going and was about to leave right there.
Whatever this conversation would bring, he would deserve it, if not worse for hurting Severus the way he did, even if he didn’t realize it at the time.
Ed didn’t want to imagine, because he could, and somehow, he almost wanted to try there and then, and he wasn’t sober enough to not trust himself it wasn’t stupid.
“Wait a minute, you’re saying your artifact wasn’t only a meteorite by origin but must have been part of a bigger rock, which means there must be other pieces.”
“Yes, so now you see, we can all live as magicals together. We will take Severus back, and I can teach both Tobias and Severus how to use magic, together. We won’t have any fights about it any longer, it's perfect,” Eileen smiled.
“We need to talk,” Harry knocked on Draco’s door, ignoring it was barely 5 in the morning when the sleepy-looking other wizard appeared on the other side.
Draco got hurt fighting the Aurors and her, Harry barely escaped to send the memory back in time for himself, haunted by the memory of Severus kicking and screaming when his mother Apparated away with him.
and assumed Harry was not only straight but into her as well before Harry could escape her (Jack laughing in the background).
“I still don’t get it,” Harry just shook his head. But on some level, he must have realized because his expression wasn't pleasant.
And what do you expect Tobias will do now if he gets drunk? He’s even more dangerous now if anything.”
Nothing happened between them, but Harry began to look forward to going shopping in the morning, every day just stealing a little bit of time out of the house and with Matt and sometimes Clara.
It also took Draco weeks to convince Severus he could speak up whenever he wanted, and that he was allowed to take any book from the Library without asking first, but soon Severus was reading the book titles himself, and often brought heavy tomes to Draco to read them for him.
Just thinking back, made Harry’s blood boil and feel like he could curse something or someone hard. Of course, there was no way he’d ever visit the elder Malfoy ever again, but the damage was already done.
“I ask you to leave then,” Severus just stood from the table, since it was his home, and he couldn’t just walk out. “I don’t want to be any part of this. And if anything, you’ll force Ed more into Lucas’s arm if you meddle.”
He wanted it so much a simple Malfoy-like sentence like that already rattled him. Draco almost wanted to see how much more undone Harry could become if he were to push him, but he couldn’t.
“You should ask them out,” Draco now leveled his cold gaze at Harry. “Before we have to leave. So you can see where it goes.”
“If you do that, I would like to be the one to check on the future now, if that’s alright with you.”
“We might just die if you don’t use it to rescue us,” Harry noted. He felt his eyelids getting heavier as he talked. Soon he’d run out of energy for sure… His luck might not last through this one, after all.
“Draco has already told me. I’m not allowed to interfere in adult business I do not fully understand,” the kid recited. “Please don’t be mad.”
So right, after that, she was just pure tempted to have sex with Harry and she ended up doing it for real. All because she wanted to spy on him a little. How did she end up like this?
That’s when the girl took his hand and Apparated with him. Harry almost stumbled by the surprise, but the scene they got into was keeping him on his feet. It was when Draco offered his handshake to Harry, but he didn’t take it.
“I think he Apparated here straight. I think he wasn’t even examined at the Mungo, or elsewhere, he just barely could muster the strength to come home,” Hermione explained quickly. “Because otherwise they probably would have kept him.”
“If anything happens to me, you tell Draco it was my Potterish idea, and you must help him with the kids. But I will be only gone just half an hour, and try to not be executed in that time-frame, no matter what.”
They even tried ambush Mindy and Pinky when they delivered the food, but that only resulted in the elves now spelling them asleep when they came in.
Warning, some fluff ahead! XD I guess I wanted to show how Drarry's relationship evolved in an unconventional(?) way, but not even I could see this coming until the first draft.
And Merlin, it almost sounded as if Draco was jealous for a second, which he couldn’t have been, because A) Harry didn’t have anyone and B) he was Draco Malfoy, ice king of Slytherin, surely better than petty jealousy.
“I don’t know what to say,” Harry watched as a stranger mouthed the same thing he said in the mirror. “Except maybe that I feel like I shouldn’t be just Department Deputy in these clothes, but at least someone… rich and famous. And I don’t want to take these off. Ever.”
He must have been drunk. He’d never hit on such a young wizard otherwise, especially since Ed didn’t have a habit of hitting on someone who didn’t have a chance but to say yes.
“Malfoys are marbles of beauties, or so I’ve been told,” said the blond, for what Harry only just burst out laughing.
“It’s great, you should make more than six next time,” Draco didn’t even have to lie about it as a parent would to a kid sometimes.
Should they run? Should Harry relive this day again, spying on Eileen when she would show up, trying to figure
There was no way of convincing Eileen, just as there was no way of stopping Tobias, while Severus only sat in a corner, probably terrified. This scene was the last thing Draco intended for him to witness.
Harry was worn out, thinking that in the end, it was still a waste because he could look better, but not especially
Then went back to the Library half listening to what Severus was studying with Draco, half revising his research on Time magic.
Draco’s mind was flooded by many things they could do, but if they were going to do this, he needed to take care of Potter, which meant he’d have to take control of Harry, but not hurt him physically, so most of the things for the first time was out.
“If you had only listened, when I told you to rent not one but two rooms for us, believe me, I would have taken a bath already. I have more than enough money for it in the bag you oh-so-kindly stole,” complaining about the less than ideal accommodation and acting like a prat came so naturally to Draco he didn’t even have to fake it to change the topic, which he was secretly aiming for.
“You could. But she was his only friend when he needed someone,” Harry said. “And you’ve also seen some of my childhood. Shielding Severus from Lily won’t protect him from Tobias. Nor would it protect you.”
“See? Afraid I’m going to curse you at every minute! You are both so pathetic, fighting against Death Eaters and prejudice against Muggle-borns when in fact you have the same prejudice for the other side!” and all she did with her wand is to turn herself back to Draco Malfoy. Harry could still hardly believe it was true, but Draco was standing right in front of them.
Draco as a Pureblood had one ever since he could walk, right until he went to Hogwarts, and then kept shadowing Lucius for the summers, learning from him.
“I’m not his relative, no. But he’s… “ Harry almost admitted Malfoy was sick when as far as he knew, this woman could have been the one who attacked him. “Unavailable at the moment, you should come back later.”
However, as a Malfoy, he just viciously smirked and walked with his back straightened. Not coincidentally, it was a look that fit him the best.
Banishing spells were relatively easy, but if you didn’t want those spells to just empty the sent content into a void, never to be seen again, they could be extremely difficult. Even biding together the particles of a mass you banished, keeping them intact could be an effort.
“I’ll take you shopping from now on, you seem to badly need it,” Draco announced. “And maybe sometimes you can also direct me on what to wear. Not so much as the style, but maybe the type of clothing you’d prefer?”
However, Fayre doing charity work basically unpaid meant that she wasn’t moving out soon, and ‘till then, they had some really awkward mornings.
This is chapter 1 of 3 I'm going to post today, so if you guys would like to read it all together, wait until I finished proofreading and uploading them all ;)
He could go back to any date, they haven’t missed an issue… Although, given what happened with him and Draco, he certainly didn’t want their last night to disappear.
So, I decided to finish this fic here. Everything is well and good with all of the characters (or at least hinted that it is heading towards that way), and I didn't want to make it any longer.
“I’m only kidding, I don’t have any time for anything but my job at the Ministry, and I don’t need blood sometimes for months or even years,” Lucas said, laughing at Ed cheerfully again. “If it’s not coming from the rat-colony I keep at my basement.”
“I have found two working brooms in the shed,” he mentally sighed, turning to Severus. “Maybe Draco could teach you how to fly, and I can watch you play.”
Then, when they sent Severus to clean up before dinner, Malfoy had grabbed Harry by the hand and pulled him to the closest room, kissing him. What happened with the “one time only, Potter” thing?
“So you are saying that Fayre is Draco Malfoy,” Harry tried to wrap his head around the foreign concept of the possibility, but just couldn’t see it.
“Fred, are you sure? I always thought George was more entertaining,” Draco only said, and for just a minute Harry felt a pang of jealousy when the blond cruelly laughed at him. “Gods, you should have seen your face, Harry. That kid is obviously nothing like me. Maybe the only thing common is that we both seem to like Gryffindors.”
If he wasn’t in prison, he’d find his son even in the end of the world and make Draco see how being gay was nonsense, even if he had to torture it to those thick scull his son had. He’d handle it, and Draco would marry Parkinson within a year.
“Green would look much better on you than the red,” Draco kissed him.   “Maybe even blue, although I’m personally not a fan of bright yellow
When Draco turned to go, Harry was sure of two things. One: he could finally tell the Malfoys their son wasn’t that missing, and two: he’ll probably never see Draco again. He was wrong.
He swore he won’t surrender those memories to anyone, as surely Snape wouldn’t want anyone to see, but in this case, Harry was technically trying to save small Severus from his own future, so he broke the only rule.
“Ambitious,” Harry couldn’t help but laugh. Some things might have changed, but Severus was still a Slytherin, it seemed. Why else would he pick the son of probably the most important person he knew?
Lucius was really worried for a while. His son has disappeared and he wasn’t free to pursue him, to hunt him down, not sparing the money if he had to.
“I was hoping you two could adopt him,” Eileen announced. “You want a family, and you could teach him enough magic, unlike a Muggle adoption center, so when Tobias dies they’d know what to do. We could envoke the Pureblood adoption laws.”
“You are killing yourself. All the other stuff -I dunno what you’re talking about,” she managed to say, after a small pause.
“I don’t mind, but I don’t like it if you insult my intelligence by lying about it. I’d rather if you told me and I knew what to expect, given that Severus now depends on you just as much as on me.”
Draco would be offended just by the suggestion alone that he cared for displaying his fashion sense so much, and he’d refuse to take Harry.
times before,” Ed held up his hand. “But we have more important things to discuss. Voldemort as you think about him is gone, just as the Horcruxes, and we didn’t have anyone trying to claim power in the last couple of decades, only some troubles with the Muggles.”
“How about the day after tomorrow then? I have an international Apparation Licence and a day off. And you could invite me for solid food, or not solid food either.”
“This is going to hurt,” he warned, when Harry was already dripping on the front, as well as somewhat prepared on the back, lubricated with all the charms Draco used after making Harry come a second time. “But it’s not like I care, so you should brace yourself.”
It was such a perfect plan Lucius couldn’t help but love himself more than the adoration he already did carry for himself. Well, Narcissa had no taste in men that she didn’t value him nearly enough.
“You should send someone into the future in your stead,” Severus returned, sitting down. “Ed and I have discussed this to a great length, and think it’s the best course of action since we can take care of this person better in this time.”
“Are you seriously picking a fight, Potter?” he questioned because part of him couldn't believe the idiot.
Later, of course, Narcissa almost bit Lucius’ head off for this action, so Lucius went to the last person he wanted to go for help: Harry. He may have known Harry felt guilty for putting him in jail and entrusted him with finding Draco, or he might not had any other chance.
“Oh, so it’s ‘us’ now? One second ago, you were just about to kill me,” Harry still kept his wand trained at Malfoy, but couldn’t help to feel relief. A couple of minutes more of that attack, and he might have been a goner.
He had read in a random magical theory book he'd need an object that was originally from the time he wanted to travel.
“I take at least two potions every day,” Lucas told him. “For the heat. I can deal with the sun, but I get weaker because of the scorching weather.”
“Right,” it seemed Harry was out of the conversation, turning away from Draco, and if had any thoughts at all regarding the topic, he kept it all to himself.
“Look, little girl, my name is Harry Potter. I’m here to save my friend, Draco Malfoy, or Fayre Black, or Fayre Smith, and it’s really important that I find them. Do you know where they are?”
Fair to say, they completely forgot what they were talking about in just mere minutes, enjoying the “negotiations” more than whatever outcome they would settle on later.
Even playing the cello which required rhythm and coordination paid off when Severus performed a perfect Wingardium Leviosa - claiming it was similar holding a bow and a wand, while also timing the spell and the music right.
“Like what you see, Malfoy?” Potter asked, and Draco found himself already blushing before he could quickly deny everything without a second thought.
“Not to be rude, but shouldn’t you to get going? I thought you said fifteen minutes,” Fayre said, and Hermione almost dragged Harry to the meeting, but not without sending a thankful look towards Fayre first.
“And what about your second child?” Harry sneered. “The one who won’t have magic at all until Tobias is dead, and then probably would die not knowing how to control any of their own power?”
“Don’t ask me. They either are preparing lunch for some animal that eats grass and live snails, or they are pretending to brew a potion, but the snails keep escaping,” he gestured at Severus, who in the big “cooking/brewing” got some grass on his clothes as well, not only in the cauldron. “But listen carefully.”
