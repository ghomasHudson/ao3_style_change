Draco reached over with an open palm and softly pat Harry's hand.
Class ended pretty quickly, ad Draco rose to meet Octavia in the entrance hall. He took the Daily Prophet out from his satchel and flipped through it as he walked. It was then that he saw it. The Weasleys. An embarrassing situation highlighted on the front page. It included a mislabelling of Arthur Weasley, as well as a picture of the Weasleys in front of their sad little house. Immediately, a million different insults and taunts to throw at Weasley flew through his mind, but he shoved them all down.
“Deal?’
“What happened?” Pansy asked, laying a hand on his shoulder. Octavia piled her plate with food.
Showing off seemed to be a good way to fit in amongst her peers. Many of them came from pureblood families, so expressing relations and advanced spellwork was key. Family assets especially, deciphering who owned the biggest mansions or the coolest boats or abandoned properties. It was quite a bit of fun, and her being a Malfoy put her high on the social ladder.
"Yeah, ain't any reason to keep before-war schoolboy grudges, is there? As long as you've stopped being such a ferret, you're okay in my books." Seamus smiled at Malfoy.
“Great, now you”re vibe checking Greg and Vince? Is your gaydar broken?”
Jesus Christ this was a messy situation. He goes to Grimmauld, expecting a perfect place for his Godson to plan to take down the last of the Death Eaters with his friends, and finds his psychotic little shit-head of a second cousin by the name of Draco Malfoy. Not only that, but the same Draco Malfoy who was apparently kidnapped fucking forever ago by his other psychotic cousin Trixie.
He jumped into actions and shoved his lift down his shirt, pulled out his wand, and put his body in a ready duelling stance.
Okay, this was it. His first bit of public magic. It was an easy spell, one he'd perfected long ago. It was simple too, he could practically do it wordlessly. But now wasn't the time to be showy, it was time to be good at something. He was a Malfoy. He was perfect.
“Oh my god just shut up.”
“It’s fantastic.”
"How bad is it?"
After class, him and the other Slytherins walked upside towards the hut at the edge of the forbidden forest, where Care of Magical Creatures would be held. As they got closer, he noticed that the Gryfindors were already there, surrounding ‘Professor’ Hagrid.
They made it to the open kitchen. It was the newest room in the mansion, per Narcissa's. She wanted somewhere to make cakes and teas for her tea parties. She insisted on doing it herself, but to Draco's memory, he recalled many times when she'd forget to bake the cake, or would just serve hot water with no tea. She would try. Every Sunday Draco had tea with his mother. It was the one time he could talk to her freely without his father trying to shoo her back to bed in one of her rooms. Draco knew it was bad, but he preferred his mother to his father. She was kinder to him. She didn't know what an awful son he was.
"Don't even joke potter, you'd look like a pumpkin in that. Or since you're so spindly, maybe an old butternut squash. If you want a long sleeve shirt then at least don't act colour-blind." I shoved it back on the racks before he could get another comment in. I looked through them again and came across a dark green shirt, the exact same as the other previous shirt apart from the colouring. I held it up for Malfoy.
"Wasn't last week's edition great?" Michael asked, smiling.
He just felt alone.
"We'll watch one soon, I promise," she turned to me with a grin. "There were a lot of staff dressed up costumes, to play the characters, and whenever any of the staff who weren't dressed as Princesses came up to us, Draco would shriek loudly and back away." Me and Luna started giggling as Malfoy scowled.
Viktor flushed slightly, an interesting thing to witness.
Not only were there muggle Halloween decorations scattered everywhere, but there were also many coloured lights above them, small candles in lamps that changed from one colour to the next, orange, purple, green! On one side of the common room many furniture pieces had been either moved away o shoved together to create a sort of stage, where many lamps shone. Above the stage there was a large unknown light source shining onto the brick wall behind it. In front of it there was...the little black box? The ‘telly’ as Pansy called it? It was connected to another strange white box which a couple of grumpy sixth years were fiddling with. Octavia wondered how that would play out. In another area close to the stage there was another strange muggle contraption the older years were trying to get working. She thought it was using ‘el-ek-tree-city’ so the students were trying to find a magical supplement.
"Don't worry about him , he's just a big joke." Anthony answered for him, leading Terry to the bench above where Hermione sat by his held hand.
She wasn’t very sporty, so she never played. That got rid of those losses. She didn’t play many games either. She was careful not to commit too much to her school work, and seeing Dumbledore’s favouritism from day one, she prepared herself for the inevitable House cup loss.
Woah I am so sorry I honestly thought this would be out sooner. I started writing the chapter but it came out way longer than intended (because at first this chapter was supposed to include the Halloween party) so instead I’ll post that next week as a gift.
Sirius opened the (fixed?) door and walked over to his bike. He dropped an unconscious Draco Malfoy awkwardly into the sidecar and cast a protection charm over the sack. The ugly pink cat hopped into the sidecar and snuggled into the kid’s limp arms for security. Sirius covered it with the spare helmet.
“Yeah, that.”
Hermione and Draco continued there discussion from the train, onto the boats, and all the way up the stairs. Neville mostly stayed out of it, only offering the odd opinion and acting as the mediator to stop anything from escalating between the two philomaths.
This one moment where Potter is ever so carefully holding Draco’s face in his hands to try and get his glasses back, and his thumb has gently (and probably accidentally) caressed Draco’s cheek and his pine eyes are squinting and Draco is blushing while wearing those stupid specs, feeling embarrassed but also never more cared for and loved and cherished them if he can have that one stupid little moment then Draco will be happy.
“Weird about what?” Octavia continued to prod him.
Sirius went behind Draco to unbind his ropes but found he didn’t need to. They’d been burnt through. With the kid’s hands.
“No we can’t! And what’s karaoke!?” He asks when she removes her hand from his mouth.
At one point the character called Velma lost their glasses and cried “Jinkies! My glasses! I can’t see anything without my glasses!” While feeling around for them blindly on the floor. Draco snorted and elbowed Potter.
"I hope one involves dragons. I love dragons."
"Nope!" She popped the 'p'. "This tall man paid for it!" She gestured to Hagrid, spilling ice cream on her dress by accident.
"Weasleys." He replied indifferently. The Minister greeted them all and Lucius introduced them all.
“I used to love celebrating Samhain, with all our beautiful rituals, but Hogwarts is definitely more...muggle in it’s celebrations. It isn’t bad, it’s just a bit-“
"Ah, as nice as it is to see some ambitious students in my classroom, I'm afraid we're only learning about Charms today." Professor Flitwick told them kindly while stacking a pile of books to stand at his podium. Once he'd done so, he stood at the front of class. "Everyone, please take your seats," He told the last of the Gryffindors as they filed into the classroom. He took the register and then gave an introduction before setting them their first task, the levitation spell. He gave them the movement and the phrase and set them off practicing, getting down from his pile of books to go round the classroom and guide students.
"Mother?"
No. He refused to believe it. There was no way. NO WAY he had a crush on POTTER of all people. It’s ridiculous. It’s comical. It’s a bad joke told in a monotone, only electing a chuckle out of one person.
"Unlucky you."
"You and Draco, huh. I suppose it makes sense that he'd know about shopping and fashion. He's always been rather pretty, and so well dressed." At that point, Malfoy had returned from the  kitchen with two mugs in hand. He had a bemused expression on his face, and it was then that I noticed he'd taken the glamour off. His hair was still dyed black though, starky contrasting his now paper white skin.
“Just thought that you should know.”
"It's a muggle thing. Kind of like when you say 'Merlin'."
Blaise came up behind them and swiped his Daily Prophet.
Unfortunately since his brain was having such a bad time grasping at the concept, the only thing he could focus on was the fact that it was kind of weird how his head didn’t hurt if he was really knocked unconscious. It usually left a bit of head trauma at least.
I hope you enjoyed this! I am kind of obsessed with writing for Pansy and about Pansy (it’s because I’m in love) so this is that.
“Oh shut it.” Draco jokingly punches Potter in the shoulder. It’s then that it hits him.
"Oh I sure hope that you are, you incompetent brat. Now, I believe it's about time you paid for your insolence!" At that moment the door opened. Narcissa was in the doorway, looking on at the scene in front of her. Lucius hastily lowered his cane and smiled fakely at her.
“No!” And with a snap, Draco felt himself grow back to normal. At least, he hoped it was normal. He tried to right himself but his leg felt like it was sprained. Octavia helped him up and he go to his feet with a wince. He felt like every square inch of him was bruised and he hissed through his teeth. His hair was all over the place and it was then that he realised how many people were around, staring at him. A lot of them grinning. He felt his face grow hot and kept his gaze on the ground, Octavia’s arm awkwardly stretching round his shoulder to keep him upright. He didn't dare look at Potter. He quickly wiped at some stray tears and tried to walk away, but his bad leg gave out on him.
So he would read.
At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers all sat. Professor McGonagall led the first-years up here so that came to a halt in a straight line, facing the other students. All faces were looking at them, the attention clearly making some of the children a bit uncomfortable. The ghosts wandered the tables in a pale silver light, paying less attention than the students, simply being there for the effect. Draco looked up at the ceiling, a starry night staring back at him, showing constellations so clearly it was as if the ceiling had opened up to the heavens. He could here Hermione whisper "Even better than the pictures," as she too looked up at the sky.
“-and I’m always in the dark!” Pansy finishes.
what on earth is in your closet Potter?
After a couple of tense moments, Moody entered the room. Draco froze. The robotic eye was focused solely on him. He told them to put their books away, and the Slytherins did so with great reluctance, while a couple of the Gryffindors began to look excited.
"Blimey! Going to Hogwarts with the boy who defeated You-Know-Who. Wait...does he...do you have the - the you know..." His voice quietened down to a whisper as he pointed to his forehead. Harry nodded and lifted his fringe, revealing the bolts of lightening that streaked about it, ending behind both of his ears. "Bloody Hell! That's the real deal, that is. That's incredible! And you really got that from battling You-Know-Who?"
“We would.” He fiddles with his sleeve. “I’m sorry.”
“I am a real grown up!” Pansy whined. “I just said that I am becoming a young lady! I am a lovely young lady right now!” She stomped her foot. “Don’t you want to be grown up?”
“Kind of.” She nodded. He grimaced.
And the third sign was that he was pretty sure he wasn’t in his pyjamas, and he always slept in his pyjamas.
"Herbology."
“Easy for you to say. You’ll look great in your dress. I just have plain green dress robes and they look terrible on me.” Greg told her sadly.
“Oh! The Hallows Eve! In Bulgaria, ve have our own traditions to scare away the evil spirits! It is a very fun day at Durmstrang!” Viktor gushed. Draco smiled.
He twisted his hands round in the other's grip and entertwined their fingers. The other person squeezed his hands.
“I guess they’re okay?”
“And there’s even a picture. Your mum and dad outside your house- if you could call it that! Your house is rather small...so your mum’s a bit of a contrast isn’t she?” It took Weasley a second longer to know what he should be angry about.
“What comes from a place of love?” Pansy asked from the armchair as they entered the common room.
He wiped the blood away with a stray tissue he found on a desk and tossed it onto the bed with spite. He better not have knocked his perfect nose out of place. It was his best feature.
I grimaced.
“I will call you Cushion. Because you’re very soft. And because in 5 minutes, that’s what you’ll turn into again.” He lay the cat on his lap and played with its pretty little paws. “I wish you could stick around for longer. I’ll try another time. I’m so close.” He bit his lip. “I’ll do it when I’m free. I promise.” He kissed Cushion’s head and continued to pet it until it transformed back.
A near perfect mimic to mine came from the pile of bags taken human form in front of me. I nodded dumbly again in agreement, although he probably couldn't see me. Without further ado, a leg shot out of the pile and kicked the door open, and immediately all of the bags were tossed towards one of beds, which he then promptly sat on, looked at me through the doorway, and sighed.
“Vhat about Harry Potter? You and your Slytherins walked into the hall with him. He even sat down with you.”
“Was the punch also spiked?”
"Hi." Draco nodded to him formerly. "So I heard you wanted to work on Wingardium Leviosa?"
“That’s why we work as good friends I suppose.” Greg shrugs with a smile before continuing to slug through his book. Vince looks like he’s dying and for once Octavia has no idea what’s going on. She doesn’t ask.
And nobody would believe it wasn’t his doing.
"You are excused to study your new books. I have shown you mercy this time, the least you could do it gather any intelligence or common sense."
Today was the most normal day I'd had. I didn't have to deal with Aunt Petunia, or Vernon and Dudley. And I didn't have to focus on practising my magic for some sort of competition or villain. I went shopping for clothes, and came back and spent time with my friends, then fell asleep on the sofa. Tomorrow classes were going to start.
“Well yes but unfortunately it is a Slytherin only event...sorry.” Draco grinned awkwardly, feeling slight guilt as Borislav’s face fell.
"Don't remind me of that Potter, please don't remind me of my unwavering adoration for Lucius."
He then shook Blaise slightly to wake him up. “C’mon Michael Jackson, time to get up.” Blaise groaned loudly.
"Wait, Malfoy." He turned back to me questioningly. I looked down nervously as the duvet. "Could you uh, well um do you...happen to uh, it's fine if you don't but um," I took a breath to stop rambling. "Do you have any more of those glow in the dark stars?" I asked quietly. His eyes widened in realization, and he grabbed his wand and muttered "Stellae lignum."
“AND IF YOU ONLY HOLD ME TIGHT!”
With his wand gripped tightly in his hand he began walking. He quickly whispered a muffling charm on his shoes so he could be quieter, but kept his guard up. He walked past some classrooms, but stayed glued to the corners, blending in with the darkness.
...say that again." Ever." Potter laughed at him. "But you still did me a favour by sticking up for me and distracting Crouch, so I need to pay you back. What do you want?" Potter looked confused.
"I rather like the sound of Hufflepuff house. They sound like they have great traits!" Draco knew his father would kill him if he were to ever go into Hufflepuff. He didn't hate them as much as Gryffindors, but he viewed them like house elves, useful for labor and little else. Draco didn't think that was fair, but kept quiet on the matter.
“You expect me to just let you hit it. But will you still respect me if you get it?” Pansy leaned towards him with lidded eyes.
"So, they compliment each other while still being able to foil each other?" He queried. I thought about it for another second.
so I’m sorry for no wanting to leave him where he could be
?!” Blaise spat, more amused.
It was all very dramatic. She just wanted to go to the dormitories already.
“That was a good first kiss.”
?!” Pansy spat incredulously.
“Beverages?”
“Because you’re on our side now.” Sirius told him and Draco scoffed loudly. “And you may be stupidly stubborn, but guess what? So am I. You’re not returning to Trixie anytime soon.” Draco’s magic flared slightly in anger.
She groaned. “Ugh, what now Drake?”
Near the end of the week, the Malfoy children begged their mother on their hands and knees to be able to go to Diagon Alley to get Octavia her wand in person, as well as the dress robes Draco needed for this year, With great reluctance, she allowed them, giving them a time limit of two hours.
"Mr Crouch! That is a child!" Mr Weasley tried to intervene.
I angled my head round, eyes fixed on my reflection. This is so strange. It looks like I'm wearing a wig. Or I'm no longer wearing a wig. My hair doesn't look like it belongs to me. When it looked like a bird's nest, at least it was lively! Now it's bland.
Moody when Blaise starts dancing seductively 👁👄👁
"Please don't." Octavia laughed at the interaction.
So as for Draco having a crush on Potter?
“You could wear a wig, and that’s about how much I care. I am done with transfiguring your costume.”
A loud shriek of laughter from outside the bathroom interrupted my musings.
“Are you talking about the Backstreet Boys?” Potter asked and Draco snapped his fingers.
"I love Herbology! As I said before, I'm a bit of an expert." Michael popped an imaginary collar. "I know my stuff."
He repeated this process of cleaning up and charming the rubbish bags away for a little bit, thinking distinctively that this was house elf work, but not wanting them to become involved, as they would most certainly snitch about any prohibited paraphernalia they would find, and it wasn’t worth the risk.
Then the voice returned.
“Ummmm I don’t think I’m the best person to answer that-“ his awkward answer was interrupted by another loud sob coming from Blaise. “Okay okay stop! I guess...you are objectively attractive? Hmm?” Potter offered pathetically.
"What can Dobby do for you Master Draco?" The house elf asked.
“Ah, but I am old-er. Older than you lot. Now go away, there’s no way I’m letting my little sister get drunk.” He ruffled her hair and her scowl deepened.
I saw him posed over a shelf of what looked like self care and cosmetic bottles and tools, a resigned yet analytical expression taking over his fake features. He began picking some items out, some which I recognised like a hairbrush and comb set, Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, a nail file, and a small bottle of Ursula's Facial Care. These were followed by more bottles which had weird and name based brands, such as April and May's Caring Conditioner; made for ragged locks and split ends! Cheryl Sheelar's Sherbert Scented Shampoo, Basil's Basic Bodywash and three different moisturizers, in the colours red yellow and blue. He tossed me some make up brushes and a couple of sets of eyeshadow thingymajigs and whatnot. I honestly never have a clue when it comes to anything at all makeup based.  He also picked out a curling iron and a bottle of expensive perfume.
"Oh Harry, we've been looking for you! I told you that you should invest in a phone you know. It would be so much easier and less flashy than sending around Patronuses, and would take less power. They can be used in the muggle world inconspicuously, and would integrate more advanced technology into Wizard society. I mean, I love the Wizarding World, but it does lay the aesthetic on a bit thick, don't you think? Practicality is key for moving forward, so no wonder Wizarding Britain lacks so much of it..." She carried on discussing with me about integrating technology and blah blah blah. I say discuss, but it was a sure fire one sided Hermione information blather if I'd ever heard one. And I had. Multiple times. At this point my brain had switched off quite a bit so I couldn't find it in me to tune in a whole lot.
"Wakey wakey!" Michael's face popped out from the side of the bunkbed.
“Hello gorgeous and handsome, how are you tonight?” Pansy came over to them dressed in a black mini skirt, a low cut black top, fishnet tights, black heels and a pair of black cat ears.
"Boys! Don't you have to go to Potions! Apparently it's in the dungeons." Hermione rounded their collective shenanigans up and set them back on track. As they left the library, she and Neville took a different turn. "We've got to get to Herbology. I'll see you in lunch!" The group of Ravenclaw boys waved to the Gryffindors until they turned round a corner.
He was even considering knocking the kid unconscious with a bat instead of a charm. He sighed again.
"Since a long time ago, now shouldn't we be going?" He rushed them, walking back along the path.
“Well yeah, that’s the point.” He pointed at Potter threateningly. “You better not tell anybody about this.”
“I also have a couple of ideas for a Halloween party. One very important one being alcohol.” Blaise bounced his eyebrows and Draco bopped him on the head.
"Uh, Malfoy, do you mind letting g-" He yanked back his hand before I had the chance to finish my sentence and turned around to grab his own bag.
He looked tired though. Whatever wandless magic he must have done would have drained him. Sirius didn’t really see the point in transfiguring the pillow into a cat, it would turn back soon enough, but he shrugged it off.
"On the campsite... some people have got hold of a family of muggles..." Potter added.
“Why would you? It’s romance! And! And, and, and I saw Greg helping Vince with his tie the other day!”
Martha’s smile faltered a bit.
Octavia hides back behind the corner and coughs loudly. She makes sure her footsteps echo slightly on the dungeon floor. She hears a swearword and rustling.
"What on Earth are you doing boy?" Snape went to the front of their table to ask Terry. Terry clenched his hands and put them behind his back.
He might find Potter’s insults to be as witty and clever as Draco’s.
Which brung him to his next task, hangover potions. He wouldn’t have enough for everyone who was drinking last night, so the rest would have to make do with headache charms and sunglasses.
Draco tucked him injured hand away and tried to keep head to head with Potter, compressing himself onto his broom to become more aerodynamic.
Those who were taught by Draco in either breaks had significantly more progress than the others, having a clearer mental state and motivation. Most of the group had managed to make a change in their matchstick, from turning it silver, to completing the transition. Terry's had turned silver and smooth, one of the best in the class, beaten only by Hermione, who's matchstick had turned silver and pointy, and Draco, who had only bested Hermione by giving his needle an eye. They were all treated to the rare smile from McGonagall. Which was ruined by Seamus Finnigan, who's matchstick had caught alight and was spreading to the wooden desks.
"Look, uh, Finnegan and um, Thomas, I'd uh, like to apologise for my stupid behaviour in the past and if I ever, uh, targeted you specifically to bully or force my st-stupid prejudices onto," Malfoy forces out, locking his gaze onto the floor.
“Well I can certainty see why we’re trying to keep them alive. Who wouldn’t want a pet that can burn, bite and sting all at once?” He mentioned aloud, mostly to himself.
"Well that's good then. So...he can join the group?" She asked.
Narcissa nodded, delighted, and ran to the ice cream shop, nearly knocking someone over in her rushed. Draco sucked in his teeth.
Back to her people watching, she noticed a slight kerfuffle happening at the Gryffindor table, as Potter made a bit of a scene before storming off.
But as long as he can live in this moment.
“You want me to get you a drink?” Vince offered. Draco shook his head.
He groggily opened one eye and made immediate eye contact with Octavia. He sighed and opened his other eye. And then he saw it. The thing he leaning on.
“It’s called a telly.”
"A favour huh?" Blaise bounced his eyebrows and Draco scowled.
But this was his moment.
"Well now, it's been a while since I've had a Malfoy...especially one as strange as you..." A croaky old voice whispered in his ear. He shivered. It was awfully strange. "Now where to put you..." Draco hesitated.
“So...anyway, we’d better practice! The students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are coming next week! We’d better look pretty for all the handsome  French Beauxbatons boys!” They both giggled.
As they sung their ‘promiscuous’s they tried to shimmy over each other, Draco backing up and Pansy taking the lead, and vice versa again. It was like a really weird seesaw.
"We've got to go." He picked up Octavia in his arms and began running. He was immediately stopped by a loud pop and the arrival of twenty armed wizards.
“The joke about being a slag isn’t very funny anymore.” Blaise said quietly. He stared at Pansy with sad eyes. “Thanks Pans.” He didn’t mean it. He left the room with a lack of any dramatic. He just quietly walked away.
“Can we not speak of gay?”
“Zey are ridiculous, are zey not? From one boy to zee ozer!” She rolled her eyes. Draco side eyed her.
“Why do I have such a killer headache?” Potter muttered, probably to himself.
At least Viktor wasn’t with her.
“It’s really fine, I don’t know what I was thinking-“
Draco didn't care about his bleeding arms. He could not let another book fall. He had just barely managed to steady himself and the books and held on to them with a sigh of relief. Until Lucius stepped in.
"I'm sorry." Harry interrupted him. "I'm sorry I didn't stick up for you. I do know how hard it is when someone calls your parents terrible, or drunks. It just," he sighed, "Ron was so nice to me. And he talked to me for ages about who I was, and just wanted to be my friend, and when he insulted your parents, I didn't want to be on the other side of that again. And he seemed so nice, it came out of nowhere, and I didn't know how to react. And that stuff about supporting Voldemort got to my head and- I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not standing up for you sooner." He apologised to the surprised blonde.
“He doesn’t have one yet?” Octvia asked, appalled. That brother of hers! Such a freaking nerd!
“But now I’m only falling apart...” They join in unison again. “There’s nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart!” They finish the first chorus holding their own heart dramatically, with one arm over their eyes in fake cry pose. The song continues but Pansy and Draco laugh with each other. Blaise slow claps.
Luna had been knitting this whole time, but when Malfoy stopped yelling she grabbed his arm and gently coaxed him back onto the sofa. When he sat down she rubbed his arm comfortingly. For the first time since lunch, I saw Virgo again, slithering out of the wand holster to wind round Malfoy's arm, in a similar gesture to Luna.
"GRYFFINDOR!"
He exited the bathroom while feeling like a right dolt. “Ta-da!” He outstretched his arms and smiled fakely.
"Keep dreaming, girly, mine was practically 2 meters above the ground!"
"Put down the girl!" One of them yelled at him. He obeyed hesitantly, but as soon as he did he was Stupefied and hit the ground.
“Um, congrats on Octavia being in Slytherin with you?” Potter said awkwardly.
It was probably just the Dark Lord being incompetent again. He gets defeated by a baby and people are still afraid to say his name! Why is everyone acting like such quivering bollocks?
“Draco? That lost Malfoy kid?”
"- And as it turns out, they haven't even recorded all of the possible secret rooms and passageways in the castle, and that new ones are discovered and kept secret as each school year goes by, so there's a good chance that we could find one. Of course, I won't have the time, as I'll be learning as much as I can about the wizarding world. I need to know the laws, it's full school curriculum, how it transfers to the huma- I mean the 'muggle' world. I want to know the origins of wizardry, and how you've managed to keep it so secret. I'm guessing there's a memory spell, because you can't keep an entire world a secret without making some slip ups, right?"
"That's a shame. I used to have a lovely History of Magic tutor, Miss Gown. She focused on all the interesting bits, even a bit of muggle history! I'm sorry Hermione, but muggles are so strange. You judge people on the colour of your skin! Why would you do that? We're all the same underneath." Draco said.
“Grown up stuff is weird.” He said through giggles. Pansy pouted.
“What’s ‘Billy Jean’?” He asked the idiot. Blaise grinned.
"Perfect, I'll get my things." Draco turned to the bushy haired girl. "It was nice to meet you miss..."
The shirt being judged happened to be one of my oldest Dudley owned T-shirts, and after years of use was now faded, stained, full of holes and horrendously wrinkled. It might have even been the shirt I wore to defeat Voldemort.
"I think you're a bit overenthusiastic for school." Anthony said.
Blaise Zabini is an asshole but he’s also a massive problem. He is also the holy shipper and causes commotion exclusively. The casual flirty tone with all of his interactions is inspired by real life shit heads that go to my school and mess with everyone.
Little to their knowledge, Bellatrix had taken the Malfoy child to the hidden and ward protected Grimmauld Place, a home of the Blacks. No one else could enter, and no one could exit. Impenetrable. Protected.
“Oh no! I refuse to let you use amateur magic on your eyes! Go and ask your brother or something!” Octavia was hesitant.
“Stuff.” Blaise smirked darkly. Draco shoved his stupid face away.
Through her maddened giggles, she just pointed at the sofa. “My stupid brother’s canoodling with Harry Potter!” She exclaimed, maybe sounding a little bit like a loon, but Martha started giggling with her. Even Danny joined in when he saw, but he seemed to find anything affectionate hilariously disgusting.
“You’ll wear you quidditch shorts, unless you’d prefer a skirt...”
They broke the kiss and Blaise looked at Draco with large and glazed over pupils and Draco giggled even harder.
“Until dinner, beau-tee-ful.”
“Only all the time. She’s obsessed with studying,” he snorted, “I’d believe that the books were her only friends if it wasn’t for Weasley and Potter.”
"Yeah I guess...
“I was fetching beverages from the kitchens. For the party.”
"I don't actually know who you are? Malfoy, I didn't know you had a little sister?" Granger asked confusedly.
The put their feathers away and walked over to the Transfiguration classroom as a group.
Potter shifted slightly. “The party in Gryffindor was overwhelming. No one believed I hadn’t put my name in, not even Ron.” He shrugged sadly. Draco raised an eyebrow.
He can’t risk it.
“And mine too if it isn’t too much trouble.” As Draco handed Potter his cup he whispered for him to water down Blaise’s drink. Potter nodded understandingly and left with a joking salute.
No one understood her like Draco. She could tell him everything, and he would never write is off as girl troubles or an overreaction like her older sister or Blaise did. He always took her seriously and offered support.
"Then don't call me that in public!" She whisper-shrieked as Draco snickered.
"What was your last lesson?" Hermione asked Draco.
The Killing Curse.
“Oh. Thanks.” She twiddled her thumbs.
“That would be okay if I trusted you, but due to you doing nothing that would ever make me believe that you wouldn’t go off tattling to your kidnapper-“
“You’re a better person than me.”
His hands were outstretched in a star shape, fingertips reaching for anything but only gripping snow. He wasn’t wearing any gloves. His hands were cold.
Then the door came crashing through the frame.
“Of course I’m not going to tell anyone.” Pansy huffed. “I love you too much you idiot. I just think it’s a shame.” She sighed against him and wiped away a remaining tear. “We would make so much sense.”
As they rose from the bench, Viktor leaned over to ask Draco a question. “Vill you be entering the tournament, Drako?”
"Yeah, sure, whatever. Gladrags Wizardwear, let's go." I tugged on his arm again and started walking ahead.
"Have a good night!"
All my readers mean the world to me and any comments or support just makes my day and lifts my spirits to heaven! Thank you all!
Draco goes shopping in Diagon Alley for school supplies. 3rd July 1991.
“Just chatting about Potions homework.” Theo interrupts with a smile. “Thanks for the help mate.” He slaps Blaise on the back and passes Octavia in a slight hurry. Octavia smiles back with nothing behind the eyes.
"What the fuck?!"
"I wouldn't even need to ask Blaise, I can just ask any Slytherin boy and they'll know."
He did feel a bit of pity. To see the way your parents died performed on a spider right in front of you.
"It's a stim." Terry began. "It's a thing I do that helps me centered. It makes me feel happier when I hear, touch, smell or feel something that overwhelms me a bit. Or I have a sensory overload. I really like, um, bird noises and woolly jumpers. They make me feel safe." He explained promptly while fiddling with his cloak buttons.
"Uh, I learnt I was magic today, so I haven't had that much time to adjust. Um...I guess some accidental magic happened, but I didn't know it was accidental magic. I just thought it was because natural disasters or birth defects. Hagrid, the Hogwarts games keeper, told me I was magic. He's with me now. They, um, sent me a letter saying I'd been accepted into Hogwarts? So I really want to go. I don't know about the next question because I don't know about international anything? I didn't need to convert muggle money into galleons because my parents left me some magic money to use. Hagrid was actually the first wizard I met, but you're the first wizard around my age who I've met. At least, I think you're around my age...you're not an elf or something, are you? And definitely 10 out of 10! The magical world is so interesting! And I've only seen Digon Alley!" He finished in quick procession. Impressive.
“Too much.”
“Of course. Still, was of respectable breeding, very pure, very good.” Kreacher wiped the table. The house elf then looked up at the house. “I sense the wards. They are weakening. Mistress Lestrange must not be caring as much.”
He got out of the way for the other boys to come through and looked around the bustling Platform. The train was a scarlet steam engine, with a sign above it labeling it the 'Hogwarts Express'. He looked over to the ticket booth for tickets and only then did it hit him. He was going to Hogwarts! He grinned widely and when no one was looking, did a little fist pump in excitement. Finally!
"I think you just...slap it?"
“Why?” He asked in exasperation, not even sure he even wanted to know now.
Draco nodded and Potter sighed in relief. “Plants that heighten love. Herbs for love potions, Herbology hints on romantic spells,
but yes im getting back on track, and I'm sorry for ghosting ya'll for over two months, that was a total dick move and i love all my followers, supporters, kudo-ers and commenters. you are the backbone of ao3 and even though youre drarry shippers and probably fruity  :/// i am too >:) so we're in this together.
Soon Dumbledore bid them all to bed.
"Oh yeah, it went fine. But I hope you know that by being Seamus' friend you're going to get a load of flirting sent your way."
He opened the bathroom cabinet, then opened the door behind the shampoos to reveal his potion stash. He’d brewed over ten of them a week ago in preparation. He only hoped Snape didn’t mind some ingredients going missing.
“S-P-E-W. Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare. I’m secretary apparently.” He looked bemused by this.
“Um, maybe another time. I need to go sort something, I’ll see you in a bit.” She waved Martha away, and felt a slight guilt as Martha’s smile dropped.
“Seriously Malfoy?”
He ran through the halls, racing in and out of students, trying to find a deserted area. He made it into a deserted and dusty Defence classroom and shut the door. He shakily rose his wand and set a weak silencing charm around the room, blocking any sound from making it out.
After The Nightmare Before Christmas they didn’t watch anymore films, because apparently they had to save the best for the later. By this point, t was nearly dinner, so Octavia took out her fangs , wiped off her makeup, and went out to sit in the great hall.
"Hagrid got her for me. For my birthday. He shouldn't have really, I didn't need a gift..."
“Okay, so there was this one time when Draco was eight and I was five-“
“It’s probably Piggy Pansy Parkinson.” She began to cry. Draco held her hands and squeezed.
"Hey, hey Draco, it's okay, you're okay, everything's fine." Someone's voice told him. He felt ill. There were too many people. He couldn't breath.
When Dumbledore discussed that by the next night people had to have put their names in the goblet, whispers rose from around the hall, many turning to the peers who had been theorised to enter, primarily Viktor. But their had been different whispers rushing up at the mention of an age line. Many angered whispers and conspiratorial whispers from the Slytherins. That age line would soon be obsolete.
“Oh, sorry...you want me to react again?” He asked concernedly. She grinned comfortingly.
"What do you think of this one?" I asked him, holding a plain and stretchy long sleeve orange shirt to my torso. He gagged in response.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I promise I’ll stop. Over protective big brother me isn’t really a good look, s it?”
“Malfoy,” Moody spat, “you’re up next.” Before Draco could get up to go towards the middle of the room, where the allocated desk was sat, Moody casted an Imperio.
his morning for composure.
"And you could have blamed me easily. So...thanks for not doing it. But I have a question: why didn't you?" Draco asked him, copying Potter's crossed arms.
Midnight gang midnight gang but I’m British innit. Hope you enjoyed, and y’all better give me some prompts. I am open to a bunch of them because this is what I do to get creative. I’m working on the next chapter of double trouble, it should be out soon.
Draco could only stare at the table, blocking everything out. He felt like he'd been left out in the rain overnight, and couldn't muster a grin. He felt empty other than a seeping dread that overcame him. His father would find out and he would get in trouble. He didn't enjoy the feast and ignored any questions or jabs the other Ravenclaws made. Despite being empty, he wasn't hungry, not even for his favourite, chocolate pudding.
The last wand she was presented was a nine inch Hawthorn and Dragon Heartstring wand. She gave it a wand, and...she felt like it spoke to her. Like it understood her magic and wanted to help. It felt like an extension of herself.
"Oh I am, the decorations are just so bright. Too garish."
blonde, but it was cut short. Rather fashionably if you asked him.
“Well, since you’ve been unco-operative, I suppose I’ll have to take you with me.” Draco’s eyes widened. Finally a reaction!
“Ha ha ha.” Draco laughed sarcastically. “Stop stealing my girlfriend, Zabini.” He tugged her away. Blaise stuck his tongue out.
"I've got to run, Via, I'll see you at lunch." He ruffled her hair as he stood up. She nodded distractedly as she dived head first into her supply of sweets. "And don't eat all of the sweets! She only sends a package once every two weeks!"
Half the room groaned and complained loudly, but were eventually carted away by the older years. He felt a tug at his arm. “So what are we going to be drinking?” Asked a smug Octavia. He levelled his gaze threateningly.
“Blaise! Put me down! This isn’t necessary!” He batted Blaise’s torso and struggled. Blaise just gripped harder. Draco could feel his face growing even hotter than before as some random student “ooo”ed at them.
Potter took his hand off Draco’s arm. “I, uh, thought we could race. Or something.”
“Potter? But Draco hates Potter.” Greg said confusedly.
"Come on Tom, you now have your chance to fashion me up. Make me look...Fabulous." I jokingly posed which made him snort and roll his eyes.
He got out his wand and turned to Octavia with a smile.
This time the shrieks were paired with cries, as many of the Beauxbaton’s party had begun to cry lightly, though some were sobbing. Octavia caught Draco’s gaze again, as it was directed to a girl on the Ravenclaw table comforting one of these criers. They raised eyebrows at each other in understanding way, one of old friends.
Draco seemed ever so happy that she was there with him, though. If it was only to have a shoulder to poke, and show off his quidditch knowledge. He was happier than she'd seen in a long time. And that made her happy.
“Drakeyyyyyyy.” A groan came from the sofa, where Pansy had sprawled in an even worse position. “My head hurrrttss.” She whined softly.
“Sirius, can you tell me who they are now?” The boy asks, giving Draco a wide berth warily. Smart.
"Father was angry. I'm lucky I don't have a sibling or another heir, or I'd be on the street. They would have another heir but Mother is- she's...she's not well." He cut himself off. Harry scooched next to him.
“Yes it is Via, same thing happened last month!” He continued to stop her by crushing her.
Ron was looking at Hermione with a bit of lovesick amusement, but kept on glancing to where me and Malfoy were sat. Malfoy had sat up a bit stiffer against the sofa and had tuned in slightly to Hermione's rant. I could practically see the cogs turning in his head, absorbing the knowledge as if studying for a test.
“I would start talking Draco.”
“Yep, poor Draco here got turned into a ferret by Professor Moody.” Blaise told her through a mouth full of food. Pansy cringed a bit in disgust and turned back to Draco.
In the end when I looked at the pile of clothing I'd collected, and then at my wallet, I came to a stark realisation.
“Yep.” Potter nodded, obviously pretending to read the book.
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
Unfortunately this loud exclamation also woke up Seamus.
“Well you can hardly blame yourself, being entered into a death tournament is probably higher on your list of worries than dressing up.” Draco told him. “And you still haven’t answered why you’re here.”
“Thanks. I stole it.” He clipped. Blaise guffawed.
“But you didn’t see the intimacy of it!” Blaise holds Draco by the shoulders. “The INTIMACY.” He shakes him. Draco keeps a neutral face.
If you don't know about my other fanfic, It's Easier Than Hating, then please check that out, it's an Eighth year fic, and if you do know I apologise if chapter updates are a little slower because of me working on this. Your support means the world to me so I hope you have a great day and a great life! Catch you later, BisexualGurrl! xoxo
.” He raised his voice at the last part and a couple of Slytherins turned away.
I quirked an eyebrow in confusion. "What do you mean, the wrong shade of green?"
(See the end of the chapter for
He was interrupted from his musings by a loud and pained groan coming from the bed next to him.
They were currently showing off things that looked like books, but had no pages. All plastic. They had weird covers on them that the fourth year, Abi, was explaining. They were apparently ‘Videos’ and scary ‘movies’. Whatever they were, they drew in quite a crowd, and any muggleborns who knew about them were clamouring to decide which one they would put in the ‘DVD Player’. It was all very confusing to the many purebloods who watched the scene with poorly hidden distaste and curiosity.
"Now you're taking the mickey! Orange? Really?"
After a couple of hours Draco had written up a large list of similarities between the first tasks of the tournaments. It all seemed quite random at first, but when you narrowed it down through school, facilities, and themes, it became pretty clear.
“Is Kreacher not enough?” Aunt Bella shrieked. “Is he not enough of a filthy animal to be around that you want to fill our home with another?” Draco continued to shake his head.
He shakes it.
"Hey! My M-Mother gave me my name and it's the constellation o-of a dragon, Draconis! She l-likes the name a-and so do I." He replied, his face flushing.
When they made it to the other side he dropped his bag dull of supplies by the fireplace. He then walked Narcissa up to her room, taking the dripping ice cream away from her before sat down on the bed. He threw it into the bin, along with his own, before washing his hands in her en suite. After washing the ice cream from them he sat behind his mother on the bed and began to plait her hair.
The kid was holding onto the pillow tightly, and Sirius saw it gently begin to transfigure into...a cat? Draco smiled at it and stroked it’s head the best he could with his awkward arms. He picked up the ugly pink cat and stood back up, staring Sirius down.
“Sounds awesome. The only help I really need is on the fang bite on my neck and giving my face a dead look.” Octavia explained. Martha smirked.
“What?” He spluttered. “Martha’s doing it!” Octavia turned around and sure enough, Martha was already drooling over the students.
Around them thousands of candles bobbed up and down across the hall, giving both a soft and harsh glow at the same time. There were four long tables stretching out, representing each house. Said tables were laid with golden plates and goblets, the candlelight bouncing off of them, causing them all to shimmer.
Potter sat down opposite him, leaning against mother shelf. “Needed a break from the stares. And glares. And Ron’s pissy mood.” He snorted. “Surprisingly you’re one of the only people not giving me trouble.”
“We’re not.” Pansy said. “Just because they make nice things like music and microphones doesn’t mean we’re going to fight for them or suck them off anytime soon,” Draco scrunched his nose, “it just means that their none magical struggle can benefit us.” She said primly. Potter raised an eyebrow.
"Uh, yeah...hehe."
“No it isn’t!”
“What kind of questions? Better not be about his death, you should know by now to stay out of all that.” Some of them shrivelled away.
“I’ve still got to pay Granger back for the badge templates.” He pressed the badge.
“Draco?” He faintly heard Pansy ask, in the background of his internal conflict. “Professor, he’s going to cry.”
“Blaise, how are you already drunk?” He asked his inebriated friend.
He still wished that he could have a pet, but he’d make do with paying more attention to Booky the owl.
Draco hated to admit it, but he thinks he’s absolutely plastered.
"MORSMORDRE!"
"I feel like she'd already suffered enough, why add on Professor Snape and her classmate's wrath for losing housepoints? Besides, it's only 10 points from Ravenclaw, we can make those numbers back up." Said Michael.
"Yeah, I'll see you then." Draco confirms politely. It's an olive branch. It's a withered one but one just the same. Potter seems eager to take it.
"Never...
“I wasn’t kidnapped!” Sirius used to be sure it was his cousin Trixie, that’s what all the rumours say. But this bloody kid was making him question the oldest stories.
“How about this, you’ll owe me a favour?” Potter offers. Draco squints.
Or perhaps in Slytherin
But in that single second where Potter’s calloused thumb gently, oh-so-gently, and tenderly and caring and *lovingly* caressed Draco’s cheek, the only thing Draco could ever focus on was the green shade of Potter’s eyes and how much Draco wanted to kiss him.
That you for reading and please leave a judo and a comment! I love feedback and constructive criticisms or just notes and your opinion. They motivate me to keep writing. I’m also working on some shitty art of the characters so you can stay hooked for that! Stay safe and I love you all! ❤️❤️❤️
“A normal child?” Aunt Bella stopped. “A normal child!” She yelled. “Is there no end to your disrespect and privilege, after I tried so hard to train the Malfoy out of you, and you’re still like your disgusting mother! Poor little Cissy didn’t have everything, so she goes begging for more!” She roared her sister’s name and Draco flinched. “You’ve been getting those ideas again. From those fictional books in the library. You want to be a normal child,” she scoffed, “when you are scarcely a child. You will be a man soon, a brilliant one, all thanks to me.” She neared him. “I have given you everything, done everything right, and still you yearn for more? Ambition will do you nothing when you are serving under the Dark Lord, Draco.”
Draco pursed his lips. “I wasn’t really struggling with a spell per say, I was um, attempting to create a spell?” He tested the waters. Aunt Bella grinned wide so he elaborated. “I was testing how I could discover a more permanent version on Conversus Animalis.” Aunt Bella clapped her hands.
"Um, well, the thing is - the thing is I don't know how to -" Harry began.
(See the end of the chapter for
They carried on until they got to Hogwarts.
“You mean sexy games.”
Theo grinned. It looked dangerous. “Right, but that’s the thing. You always seem to advertise...” his hand traced Blaise’s leg, “...the things the great Blaise Zabini can do, but then I don’t get any of it? Isn’t really fair, is it?” He pouts.
“It was okay. We should plan one with the Durmstrangs soon. I’m sure even the teachers wouldn’t mind then, all about school unity.” Draco suggested, appeasing those who weren’t invited.
“I don’t see how that’s any of your business-“
"Let's check them out!"
He continued to stealthily walk through the hallways, his eyes sharp and alert. He was a bit slow, but better safe than sorry. He passed the entrance to the Gryffindor common room when he knew he was nearly at the entrance hall, where he could get to the portrait.
I swung my satchel around my shoulders and headed out, locking the door behind me.
"And don't you worry, I'll be the most ideal boyfriend for you!" He cleared his throat, and then said in a comically deeper voice, "stay away from my girlfriend! She's mine! Hiyah! Hah!" He did a couple of joking 'karate' moves.
She fell straight asleep.
Octavia zoned out of Dumbledore's explanation of the Triwizard tournament, instead buzzing with excitement with her brother.
“Okay then, you should go to sleep.” Draco hiccuped. “You’re probably tired.”
“So get on your knees then.” Theo coaxes, before shoving Blaise a bit harshly nearer the ground by his head. His finger’s curl around Blaise’s hair. “You really ought to cut these things, what are they called?”
The good voice in his head tried to persist, but the curse continued.
“You’ve got to teach me that.”
They made it to the classroom just as Snape got out the register. He eyed them with annoyance, his pitch black eyes going over each of them. Draco saw those dark eyes widen slightly as the sight of himself and wanted to hide.
Draco and Octavia locked eyes and exchanged worried looks before hugging their mother. Draco held Octavia's hand and dragged her towards the wood, keeping his gaze up and away from the burning tents and crying children.
“I have just put my name in the goblet. Ready to be picked for tournament!” He said proudly, thumping his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You named them?”
"A muggleborn. It means someone who was born in the muggle world but they have magical abilities."
“Pfft, okay. Deal.” Potter nodded.
"Sorry just thought of something funny." They nod in understanding and Hermione smiles awkwardly at me. Since my blowing up at the Burrow they've been stepping on eggshells around me, treating me like a precious ornament they're afraid might shatter at any moment. I can understand the weariness but it doesn't mean I have to like it.
"Whatever you say Mother." He replied, hoping she'd change her mind. At that moment the oven timer pinged, so he put the oven gloves back on and took the tray out. They were baked to perfection, so he set them on a rack to cool.
"Like sugar quills you will!" The cart laughed, encouraging Draco to continue. "I'm serious! There's no chocolate frogging way you'll be using blood lollipop damned swear words in that mother-fudgeing school! You hear me?" Octavia couldn't stop giggling, making Draco smile. Draco put his head back on Pansy's lap.
. He was lifted what felt like miles in the air before being dropped on the floor with a thud.
“Okay, I’m going to entertain your crazy ideas for a moment so that I can debunk you. Where is your proof?”
"Are you sure? I don't want to hurt him..."
“Blaise!”
He crossed his arms over his chest and looked down boredly. He missed Samhain. Celebrating the dead. Creating the veil between the dead and alive, and saying hello to those he’d only ever seen in portraits. Surrounding a large bonfire in the manor grounds and letting the sky light up. Spending time with Via.
Some ghost came through from behind them, but Octavia wasn't that shocked. Draco had mentioned them occasionally, and there were a couple of ghosts who roamed around the manor sometimes as well. A lot of children shrieked and screamed.
"Don't waste your time on him, he definitely isn't worth it." He told her. She crossed her arms and pouted. Weasley looked very damn close to laughing now.
"Not too bad I suppose...you still look far too tall, but at least you don't look wiry...your head is too big for your body, but with that tie it looks less comical...yes I think this is the best we're going to get from you."
[][][][][] [][][][][] [][][][][]
“Octavia.” He finished for her. She was surprised for a moment before covering it up.
“SPEAKING OF GAY...Greg and Vince. I’ve been getting some weird vibes.”
TW: contains slight homophobic slurs but not in the tone of hatred. Just of the era I suppose.
“Why do you think he doesn’t find you sexy?”
Pansy pat him on the head condescendingly.
"Now, I want you to recite the Pureblood laws again, but backwards."
"But he is!"
For that single second Draco’s mind went to very stupid places, very concerning places, that he either had to repress or squash down inside of him to rot away. He was good at squashing down emotions and feelings, he’d been doing it all his life.
The lesson focused on the the Imperius curse. Moody, in all his intelligence and brilliance, decided the best course of action would be to cast it on each student.
Pansy turns to Octavia with a heartbroken look, and somehow manages to let a single tear roll down her cheek. “You have hurt me, Octi. You’ve hurt me.” She whispered the last line. Octavia rolled her eyes into the back of her head.
"All my family was in Slytherin, so I have to continue the tradition. Many people mistake Slytherin for being the 'evil' house, because You-Know-Who was in it, but I don't think that's fair. It's not Slytherin's fault he decided to become a crazy psychopathic murderer. His ambition just happened to revolve around taking over the world."
Definitely share this with anyone you think would enjoy it so I can bask in that sweet sweet attention. I didn’t write way too many words for nothing!
Quite a short boy with shoulder length brown hair hesitantly walked to the stool. Draco could see the boy flapping the hands that were by his side. McGonagall noticed too, but simply handed the boy the hat with a small smile, a comforting gesture that looked odd on the woman's stern facial features. The boy grabbed the hat and sat on the stool. This time it took the longest. He saw the hat crunch up on itself as if in a thinking expression before it yelled out loudly:
Sirius clutched his face. “That’s the third time the kid’s hit me in the nose. If it didn’t break the first few times, its definitely broken now.” He hissed in pain and Draco grinned. Sirius deserved it. That’s what kidnappers got. “Could you, Harry?”
"Please shut up."
Light was going through the sack so he could determine that it was at least daytime. He had to plan to get out of there.
"Well then, off to bed with you!" Lucius told them. All three stared at him.
“I was pretty surprised my brother ended up in Ravenclaw, considering he never acts smart in any way. He isn’t even that big a fan of books.”
"Ugh! Snape is such a jerk!" Anthony yelled out, slamming his hands on the table. The usually calm and sensible boy was looking as angry as he did during his fight with Hermione. "He's over dramatic, grumpy, leans over your shoulder when you try to focus, takes points off injured students, and yells at students for handflapping of all things! You should allowed to be yourself Terry!" He told the smaller boy, whose face lit up even more at Anthony's pronouncement.
“Hey...” he looked surprised.
"It's better than having a name to do with dragons. At least I wasn't obsessed with octopi like you were with dragons!"
She made Draco do a little test to see how well he could make things out, and gave him a Draught of Peace just in case. He took it happily. She cast a Brackium Emendo on his leg and recommended a lack of strenuous physical activity for a couple of days. Octavia watched Madame Pomfrey with wide eyes, practically taking notes.
“Okay then, we’re on good terms! It’s a truce!” He mock surrendered.
He eventually made it to the entrance hall and went through a door that led down a staircase. He made it to the basement and walked around the room briefly, trying to find the portrait with a pear in it.
“So you’ll do it?”
Draco nods for the other boy to continue.
That was fine.
Classic Icarus situations, flying too close to the sun. Their wings all burnt up.
Soon enough, a large pirate ship bobbed up from the depths, looking to be right out of a storybook. It’s intricate detailing and craftsmanship all pointed to Durmstrang. This suspicion was aided as the ship let the plank lower onto the bank, and many Durmstrang looking students began to disembark.
"Whatever, sorry, can you explain what we're going to get when we actually get there?" I asked him, wanting to get out of here. He flicked a loose lock of hair behind his ear.
“I beg your pardon?”
“Yes, my lovely Pans Park?”
The whole thing looked pretty funny, as Draco looked as if he was intimidated by Pansy, a skinny little 5’2 girl who wore a tad too much makeup. He still glanced away from her death gaze anxiously.
"Did I stutter Draco?" Lucius asked condescedingly. The boy shook his head.
“Hey little Octi! Looking spooky!” Greg came over to her dressed in a fake Ballycastle Bats quidditch team uniform. She rolled her eyes.
“I’m keeping on top of Greg, Vince and Pansy’s workloads, plus my own with all the subjects I’m taking. I’m also tutoring Octi to the best of her ability, planning quidditch strategies for next year, organising a Halloween party just for us Slytherins, and I’m pretending to date Pansy! I’m tired Blaise, like all the time. I guess I just figured I don’t have the time to piss of Potter.”
As it landed, a boy in pale blue robes and a little blue hat jumped down from the carriage to unhook the steps with mountains of pristine and preppy energy.
“Great, now I’ll leave a a glass of water by your bedsi-“ Draco wrapped his arms round Blaise’s torso and collapsed onto the bed, his small amount of weight tugging them both down.
“That was before I knew you were going to stop kissing me!” Blaise nearly turned pink then. Draco could tell. Serves him right. Him and all his not-kissing-Draco-because-he-could-be-drunk chivalry. Chivalry was for Gryffindors. Blaise should kiss him like a Slytherin.
“Well I’m not the one who sang karaoke with Blaise.” Draco threw back smugly. If you squinted you could probably see a dust of red on Potter’s dark skin.
"Hey, uh, I'm Michael, and this is Anthony," a tall boy gestured behind him to where another boy stood. "These three are having a bit of a tiff over dorms so can we share with you guys?" He asked Draco and Terry. Draco peaked behind the other boy to the argument going on. Looked really annoying to get in the middle of. He gave a questioning glance to Terry and watched as he gave a thumbs up in response.
“I’m pretty sure I’ve heard him comment about the ‘objective attractiveness’ of Cedric Diggory once or twice so that is a viable theory.” She says. “Do you think he knows?”
“Yes, that’s quite evident.” Draco told him before pausing.
Draco lurched, his right hand beginning to move and follow the voice’s orders. Roll up your left sleeve...
“Hmm. Funny.” She pointed at him. “I like you. You’re fun.” She jumped over the banister, past the gaggle of gingers, onto the floor and walked towards him. “What’s your name?”
“I don’t agree with your use of swear words, but I do agree with your assessment of Blaise.” Draco noted grumpily, writing another rapid fire sentence on his parchment.
“How does my hair look?”
Draco then cast a shield around himself, and using the blood from Sirius’ punch, he casts a quick dark blood spell to enforce the shield. He spits more blood on the floor and swipes it in a circle around him, creating a powerful bubble shield, and trapped Cushion in there with him too.
“Hey! What did I do?”
“Mm?”
“So...can we use your button presser ‘Mione?” Potter asked the young witch nervously. She folded her book and put it aside.
He sighed and decided to try his set of questions one last time.
"Oh lighten up, that's the best part of the plan. We don't get caught."
"Aww, Draco, how does it feel to finally see your crush on something other than a chocolate frog? Now you can see him in poster form!" Octavia teased him.
A boy had walked down the stairs. He looked about Draco’s age, and was wearing very baggy and ugly clothing, and donned a pair of unfashionable circular glasses on his face. He was looking at Draco with a lot of surprise and Draco scowled at him.
The spectators all began screaming and clapping, thousands and thousands of them. Octavia was beginning to feel left out, so she joined in with the cheer.
“Drako! I thought I ‘ad missed you!” Dobromir yelled out and put an arm around Draco which Draco immediately tried to pry off of him.
“What do romantic people do? Is it like mum and dad?” He asked.
--------------------------------------------
“Once upon a time I was falling in love...”
"Cool. Let's find a free compartment."
In the end, Krum ended up catching the snitch. But turns out Ireland was so far ahead that it didn't matter anyway. Ireland had won.
"A Yin and Yang. It's Chinese mythology, about opposites needing each other. Like the light and dark. Good and Evil. Hot and cold, yes and no, in and out, up and down. Yin and Yang. They are all opposites but need the other one to exist." Malfoy nodded at my brief description that I'm sure I fucked at least a little bit. I'd only learned about it for a lesson in primary school for Religious Studies and I couldn't recall a whole lot. He still looked like he managed to get the gist of it.
"Try and stretch out the 'gar" a bit longer. Now use your wand while you do it. Levitate the feather."
"We weren't even arguing..."
“Well I guess Vince needs my help, so I’d love to stick around but...” Draco struggled to be released by Blaise and Pansy. They snickered and he batted at both of them before he was released so suddenly he landed in a pile on the carpet. “Ha ha ha. Very funny.” He smoothed his uniform down. “And I wouldn’t get too comfortable. After I help Vince with his late homework we’d best get class.”
"You're Harry Potter! Holy Hell, I have so many questions! The explanation about how you defeated You-Know-Who has always been vague, especially since you were a baby...you wouldn't happen to remember how you did it, would you? My gosh, how advanced is your magic? How deadly were your accidental magic spurts? How did you only find out today? You survived the killing curse when you were scarcely an infant, how was that possible? Could it be due to some birth abnormality, or maybe a peak in your magic from a younger age? I have so many theories! You're the boy who lived and you were raised by muggles, you're like an infinite fountain of knowledge!" He rapid fired with an excitement he hadn't felt in a long time. The other boy was beginning to cave in on himself a bit, awkwardly trying to shuffle away from the blonde's advances.
“What, the one you have when you wake up?”
“Why Draco I never took you for the one to sneak around with boys...”
“I mean, it’s fine I guess. They’re just friends, and we’re just friends so it’s all...cool.” He says awkwardly. Draco sighed.
“Come on Drako! Can’t you make an exception for us?” Dobromir asked him far too loudly.
Blaise guffawed at the question and was spurred into a round of maniacal sounding giggles, the sound waking up the rest of the dorm.
He got a rare hug from Lucius before they went to the Hogwarts Express. It felt...off. One look at Octavia's face and he knew she shared similar sentiments. But he kept his cool and agreed with all the usual things, to be a great representative of Slytherin and the Malfoy name, to keep out of trouble, to stay safe...yada yada yada. After Octavia got the same talk they went through the floo with Narcissa onto the platform. They both hugged and kissed her goodbye. Draco tried not to feel embarrassed by how much she was crying to the both of them. After fighting his way out of her bear hug, he put his and Octavia's heavy things away before entering the train, giving one last wave and a promise to write regularly.
“Yes, but Blaise-“
“Over me already?” He teased.
“Yes, right, fixing. And don’t call me Drakey.” He took Pansy’s forearm as she guided him slightly towards the Slytherin dorms.
“You’re welcome!” Draco called after him grumpily. He then turned to the two girls. “You really don’t have to get me a costume.”
“Well of course you feel uncomfortable, the house is probably trying to reject you. I don’t expect it enjoys harbouring blood traitors anymore than I do.”
I started snickering, and then I started laughing as he pushed the glasses further up his pointy nose. He looked so fucking ridiculous, and the skit was just so salty and Malfoy that I found myself wheezing for breath.
“What? You said he was on our side now!”
Blaise Zabini followed close behind, only coping because he’d handled his alcohol far better than Draco did, and wanted to stay sober enough to hear all the embarrassing things Draco blabbered about when drunk.
“What was that?”
“I know what STDs are Draco, you’re not teaching me anything.” Draco flushed and looked away.
“We’re living in a powder keg and-“
Which we should be doing as well boys, you're going to miss the train!" He turned around to see a group of redheads coming over to the Platform. There were four boys, all with trolleys, a little girl, and a plump and bright woman, who he assumed was the mother. The oldest boy looked confident, while the one closest to Draco's age looked a bit nervous. The middle children looked to be identical twins, and both wore unnervingly similar mischievous expressions.
The cat jumped down onto the floor and padded towards Draco, leaping onto the kid’s lap and laying to rest. Sirius massaged his brow painfully.

Have a happy new year and I hope you had some happy holidays!!!
“It’s a way of singing where the words are in front of you. It’s muggle.” She explains.
"Could you Apparate me there please Dim?" He asked her, not wanting to walk all the way to the other side of the mansion. The house elf looked surprised, but nodded and grabbed onto Draco's trouser leg. She then clicked her fingers and Draco felt a great lurch in his stomach as they Apparated. Once he was there, he nodded a thanks before she scurried off.
"Well, maybe you're not strong!"
“Oh...did you not know?” Blaise questioned
Draco flushed at the sudden attention and fumbled over something to say. He had to settle for a quick "Hullo," before  fiddling with his hands.
“Wait...are we allowed in the boys’ dorm?” Pansy shrugged in response. The continued walking down the steps.
As Terry spoke, the boys all got changed into their pajamas and took turns brushing their teeth.
“Does anyone remember anything that happened last night? I blacked out after our card games.” Draco asked.
“I wouldn’t mind it as long as he left. He is annoying.”
“I know.”
“Well I for one think it’s a great nickname.” Potter butted in and Draco’s eye twitched.
“I really do.” Draco agreed.
“Yeah. It wasn’t.” She breathed in deeply. “I want you to be weary around Moody. I don’t trust him, and I don’t think you should either. I also want you to watch for Draco. You’re a ‘hero’, right? Save him from Moody and his own dumbassery. Please.”
“She is very...dedicated to her studies, as you put it. She’s the top of our class. Right in front of me unfortunately. She good could probably help a great deal with our studying.” Viktor looked at him with apprehension, his large eyebrows furrowing.
“...what?” They all giggled again.
“Don’t get your knickers in such a twist, it’s just a word.” He shrugged it off. “And you don’t get to tell me off for swearing.” He told her pointedly.
Draco gets a Howler from Lucius. 3rd September 1991.
“You tell me your name, and I tell you mine.” The intruder said.
fault what happened to Longbottom’s parents. Just his...Aunt Bella’s...
"Oh yeah, your mum. Didn't she go loony a couple of years back? No one sees her outside of your big old mansion for months at a time. I've heard she turned to booze and is stuck drinking her cares away in that giant house of yours." Draco saw red.
“Cool cool cool, thats cool.” He smiled at the lake. “That’s cool.”
"Right you are about that. That'll be seven Galleons." Draco handed him the money.
She enjoyed writing the essays and putting her own spin on each topic. The real interesting parts were in the footnotes, such as the Goblin king Lalsthuber III’s real reason for claiming war on the elves was one of his twenty wives being contaminated with their woodland magic, and that all the juicy parts were lost in translation.
It was all very poetic and wonderful.
"Wow..." Ron trailed off. "So, were you really raised by muggles? What are they like?"
“Why would you need a pet? Is Auntie not enough for you? Are you wanting to be spoilt? If you wanted to be selfish and have everything then I would have left you to be mistreated by your traitor parents.” She continued to spit the word. Draco shook his head rapidly and he gripped his wand tighter.
“Stop it I’m going to fall off!” Draco yelled at him as Pansy gripped him tighter.
Once they got there, Madame Pomfrey diagnosed him with a broken leg and a possible concussion, all while cursing about
He reached out to the red envelope and opened the Malfoy seal.
“We got these half blood siblings get the ‘tely-vision’ and ‘DVDs’, and a couple of older students who are taking muggle studies took care of allowing ‘elek-tree-city’ in Hogwarts. It took a lot of fiddling with the charms and mechanics, parts which I don’t really understand. It’s all very
"That dickie bow makes you look eleven."
Blaise huffed. “He’s an incredible muggle singer by the name of Michael Jackson. He’s super popular and super cool. I’ve been researching him all month! He’s such a thrill!” Then he snorted. “-er.”
"Honestly Ronald, you don't just start going through people's things, you have to ask first! Otherwise it's very rude!" He ignored her in favour of carrying on nosing through my stuff. I guess when you have a lot of siblings, privacy isn't really a thing.
“Via! We never got to practice magic together!” He fretted and bit his lip.
Some people would consider them emerald green, but to Draco they reminded him of the pine forest outside of the manor. He would always get lost in them. In the forest, he means, and potter’s eyes match them exactly.
By instead miming it to each other.
“Yes!” She huffed. “I want you to be my boyfriend.”
After messing with some of the other passed out people, they finally went to breakfast together.
For Neville it took a while longer. A whole minute with the hat on his head he sat on that wooden stool. Draco could admit to feeling a bit worried, as this was the longest the hat had gone before making a decision this sorting. Finally the hat grumbled out:
At the group's questioning look, he explained. "My siblings and cousins prefer to write a letter each." Terry looked into the sack. Oh sweet! Sugar Quills, my favourite!" In that bag alone, Terry probably had double the amount of letters Draco would get from his father in his lifetime. At the thought of his father and letters, Draco quickly checked the air for any owls that looked like Pluto.
"I hate owing people for extended periods of time but...fine. Fine. Whatever. I'll see around, Potter." He turned around to go back into his cart.
"Sh-she was with me." He stuttered. Damn it, no stuttering!
“What if I told Father? About your little costume?” He rebutted.
“...a Veela cheerleader for the national Bulgarian quidditch team...” he muttered lowly.
“You what? Why did you do that?”
"This one! This one's the wand for me!" She exclaimed. Ollivander gave a weak chuckle.
Everyone in the cart turned to him, some with surprise and some with annoyance or anger.
He broke into the broom cupboard and grabbed a basic Nimbus 1000.
“Draco walked out of Defence in the middle of class.” Vince interrupted Draco’s protests.
“Fine. Fine fine fine fine. FINE.” He muttered grumpily. “I wanted to go for a fly on the pitch to clear my head. Then Potter randomly showed up. Apparently he had the same idea. Before I could my broom away to leave him there, he wanted to cash in his favour-DAMMIT BLAISE NOT LIKE THAT! He just wanted to race me round the pitch. Weird loner. And then before I left, he, uh, asked for a truce.” Everyone’s eyes were as wide as saucers.
"C'mon Ma-Tom! You made me come all the way here out of your own snootiness, please tell me it wasn't all for nothing." He rolled his eyes at me and straightened his neck again.
“Sure.” Draco agreed readily, leading Blaise over to a less crowded wall.
“But my love!” Draco cries, giving in to his inner thespian. “After all we’ve been through, after I gave you my being, you intend to elope with some
“Language!” Draco scolded her, with a hint of wry amusement.
Ludo whipped out his wand and cast a "Sonorus!" and then began the announcements that could reach everyone in the pitch. "Ladies and gentlemen...welcome! Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!"
“Never.”
"Now I'd hate to have to fix such a lousy garment for you Potter, but I honestly doubt you have anything better." He said as he started swishing his wand at me in rapid succession. As he did so, the hole began fixing itself, and the shirt began to tailor itself to fit me more accurately while the frayed hem corrected itself. While I was looking down at what was happening, Malfoy had walked over my closet to check out my large plethora of gorgeous clothing, and was now addressing his comically disgusted expression to the shirt that he was holding up.
"Shut up! He's not my crush! I just think he's a really good seeker!"
"I guess I have more self control than those nitwits. And they're not that pretty." He shrugged, and Octavia agreed.
“Fine then. I’m Ginny Weasley.” She told him, ignoring cries from Sirius to be careful telling Draco anything. “Now it’s your turn.”
The week was also passed strangely because Octavia and Draco still hadn’t exchanged a word. Both were too stubborn to talk to or even apologise to one another.
"I know...just let me be a good big brother and protect you from using swears yet."
After I put it on, I threw open the curtain to pose to my bored audience. As soon as he saw me awaiting comments, he started snickering.
"Nothing darling, you can go back to bed." Lucius tried ordering her with a tensely gentle voice. Narcissa's eyes drifted over to Draco, from his frazzled hair to his bloody arms. She cocked her head at the blood on the carpet.
A couple hours later he had ended up the staircase that stared at the door. It was locked, but only from the inside. He could get outside so easily.
“Thanks, thats bloody brilliant.” He handed the bottle back. Draco tossed it into a rubbish bag.
“And why would we want to raise them?” He asked indifferently. The Gryffindors turned around in surprise, as if they’d only just noticed the Slytherins had arrived.
What?
For a week Octavia’s life almost became normal. Draco was off doing something odd and secret that didn’t include her for once. She could almost see what Hogwarts life was like before she came along.
They were discussing the new disgusting creature they’d be caring for this year. This one seemed more disgusting than the rest however, being called a ‘Blast-Ended Skrewt’.
"Mum!" He yells out for her, not caring for formalities.
"I don't even want to know. Keep it a surprise. The one thing I do know is that it will have something to do with Potter. We're running three out of three! He kills a teacher in first year and gets a reward, meanwhile I..."
"Hey boys, Herbology is in five minutes, we should probably run!" Michael called out to them, his hair mussed, schedule already looking destroyed, and robe tucked in ways robes should not be able to. His messed up hair kind of reminded Draco of Harry, and the ridiculous black bird's nest he carried around. Ridding thoughts of Harry, no...Potter, from his mind, he chased after the other three boys in a rush to make it to Herbology.
Pansy sometimes wished he wasn’t the way he was.
==============
"We get rid of them!" The largest slam of them all, the book shaking the table itself.
His hands weren’t especially close to the ropes, so he’d have to use something that could get rid of them from a slight distance.
“Oh, well well well then-“
"Thanks!" Harry hugged him. Draco was thrown off. He was hugged before, sure, by Hermione as well, but Harry's hug was the hug of someone who didn't really know how. As if he'd watched people hug and tried copying it for the first time. It was quite awkward, but only lasted 7 seconds before Draco was released from the other boy's grip.
I hope you enjoyed reading this! Comment if you have any ideas or mini headcanons or meme conversations you'd like me to add as this is pretty chill fic with an open plot to those.
“Why am I the one being hurt in both scenarios?” Potter snickered.
Pansy beamed. “See Octavia, this is the reaction I expect! A polite one from a true gentlemen.” She squeezed Greg’s bicep. Octavia rolled her eyes.
Once he'd finished his pastry, he shot right up to where Professor Flitwick was standing with the students schedules in front of the Ravenclaw table.
“Hey! Hey Draco!” He realised that he had been lost in thought in the middle of the hallway and woke himself up.  He turned to where Octavia was tucked into the side of the wall.
The Malfoy Family, one of the most prestigious, wealthiest, pureblood (and evil) families in all of wizarding Britain had made a very important decision upon the announcement. The heads of the house, Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, decided they would renounce any affiliation with Voldemort, ‘The Dark Lord’, Death Eaters, and all dark magic for good. They had a newborn son to think about after all.
He took off his robes and tucked them into his satchel. He lay that beside the broom cupboard.
The intense girlish attention made him feel...uncomfortable?
“No swearing.” He mentions. “And...I get it. I was being pretty nosy. I’m just concerned.” He explained. She bundled him to the side and sat next to him on the chair.
“Hey! I said a friend, not multiple. Pick one.”
He first poked Theo harshly in the forehead, who immediately fell off Blaise’s lap. This didn’t wake Blaise however, who simply muttered in his sleep and curled up. Theo looked up at Draco in horror, and turned with Blaise with even more fear somehow.
He cast Episkey on his split lip and Reparifors on his left leg. Both seemed to heal quite nicely, but that left the bruise. It wasn’t often she left bruises, it was usually simple cuts. She didn’t often slap him either, so it must have been a particularly awful thing he’d said.
Draco focused on the Harry closely, as his hair was swept to the side by his arm.
They announced the Irish players, and while Draco cheered with everyone else, his Omnioculars were still firmly stuck on the form of Viktor Krum.
“But you know what else Potter gets?” Blaise unceremoniously interrupted the three, looping Potter’s other arm with his, causing a four person chain. “Karaoke. You were brilliant at Backstreet Boys songs, we’ve got to do that again sometime! I’m thinking Christmas.” Potter smiled awkwardly.
Her plans had hit a slight issue when Friday evening came and they were ushered out of their last lesson to line up in their year groups in front of the school to greet the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. She was lined up next to Martha and Danny Keett, all shivering in their cloaks.
"The man in the costume was trying to flirt with Draco and he was being oblivious." At this Malfoy started spluttering.
Blaise had helped him eat something occasionally, he even drank some water, which was massive progress. He wouldn’t do much else thought. His entire body felt numb.
“Nah, it’s okay. My costume isn’t even done yet. Speaking of, where’s Draco? I need him to help.”
"That's it! Hey Potter, From Second year to Fifth year, Draco had a crush o-" Her weasling was interrupted by a flying blonde tackling her to the floor. She was pushed down with a loud shriek, her arms desperately trying to get her attacker off of her. It was then that I could finally see Malfoy's new hair.
Vince lead him to an empty corner of the room, away from any people. Draco felt his lungs ease.
“I am aware.”
"Oh yeah, you're that Pureblood kid who was meant to be in Slytherin. My dad says that every single Malfoy has been a Slytherin since the beginning. He also said that they've all been ponces. That's pretty rough buddy." Michael didn't seem to be saying any of this with malice, just a bit of pity.
"It was cool of you to apologise."
“-and it was the probably the fattest squirrel either of us had ever seen, it was so crazy! But that didn’t stop Felix, he was on a mission! So he reached-“
Blaise glanced down at her. “Wouldn’t it.”
Draco turned around to see what he was looking at and came to face hundreds of posters plastered up on Bulgarian tents. The same surly face with heavy black eyebrows. Viktor Krum.
Draco woke up with drool on his face, a large book under his stomach, and his school robes covered in library dust.
He looked to the gold encrusted grandfather clock in the hallway. It was 5 past 5. It wasn't the weekend so he didn't have to have dinner with his father, and homeschool wasn't on in the summer. He was free to do whatever he liked in his room.
So that was how I spent my evening. Modelling my many items and clothing pieces for Luna and Hermione. Well, when the other option was getting in between Malfoy and Ron's stubbornness and bringing up our various issues, I was more than happy to go with the safer and less emotionally draining option.
"Lil' Octi!"
He looked around the room for his wand, and saw it poking out of Sirius’ pocket. He thought for a moment.
“I’ve had a shit day.” Draco began to walk back towards the broom shed.
“I’m not lying. I just went for a walk outside. Had to collect my thoughts.” Pansy pouted at him.
“You believe me?”
. Then he looked at Viktor, really looked at the way the other boy gazed a Granger. And it all clicked into place.
Molly was still torn up about Fred's death, as were most of the Weasley's but she was taking it the worst next to George. She was angry at Ron for leaving the family to go back to school, in a great show of non-Molly-ness, and almost demanded that he be there for everyone in the trying time to follow. I supported Ron in his decision, as I could hardly take the suffocating sadness in the slowly-being-rebuilt-Burrow. That's mostly what lead to me and Ginny's grand argument.
"That's awful."
"Well if isn't Pansy, Draco and lil' Octi." He ruffled her hair. She scowled up at him and smoothed down her hair. Draco heard her mutter 'I'm not lil' and muffled a laugh.
"Can you both please stop? Who cares who lifted their chair higher? The height of the lift isn't really a good judge for magical capabilities." Draco stepped in between the two. Hermione was the first to rise off the floor, and brushed herself down.
The table on the right cheered and clapped for her with an enthusiasm Draco new would calm down as the sorting went on.
“...what?” She asked after a moment of shock.
“What a move. The Malfoy Fall. As dramatic and superlative as the man himself.”
“Hello nerd.” She returns, sitting on a sofa next to Vince.
His question was answered as Blaise scooped an arm under his legs and back and picked him up bridal style.
