Pleased by the renewed silence, Draco gave a content little sound and hooked his leg around Harry’s under the covers. It appeared to be a signal to go back to sleep but it had a different effect on Harry.
,” he pressed once more.
“You’re no fun,” Draco whined to Heather, who just continued to giggle.
Malfoy pretended to contemplate this request. “Well, if you insist. I don’t see how this will help you, though.”
“Right, well, er…” Hermione took a cautious step into the flat, looking around.
"Mother!"
Draco shook his head gravely.
Harry was already biting back a smile and his slight nod of agreement was entirely involuntary.
Harry’s face fell. “It’s not time yet, right?” Harry urged, glancing at Sow.
“I spoke to
Now knowing that Hermione and Ron were watching him―and apparently moderately concerned―Harry tried to put Malfoy out of his mind. It worked for the most part. Except for when the day look particularly nice and he had to resist the urge to ask for another game, or when he saw Malfoy being knocked around by students. The latter was more common and it was infuriating. People believed in Harry’s good nature enough to typically restrain in his presence, trying to be good for his sake. However, the amount of times Malfoy walked into the common room with blood on his lip or was late to class with disheveled clothes and a poor excuse told him that people were not as mild when he wasn’t around.
Ron started towards the door, but Hermione was right on his heels. “Didn’t you say Harry was trying to help Malfoy with some case? Why would he attack Harry if he was helping him?”
“It can’t be true.”
“You arse,” Malfoy finally managed out.
"I don't remember house arrest being a part of your verdict."
"I panicked, okay? You can pick out your own name later."
Experience told Harry it was Malfoy who had done the damage. And yet, every time he looked at the blonde, all he could feel was sympathy.
Draco rolled his eyes. "You're crazy though, we’ve established this." Harry made a face that Draco mostly ignored, with the exception of the twist in the corner of his mouth. "No one else would want an ex-Death Eater anywhere near them."
Still trying to register what was going on, Harry silently blinked at the well-lit living room. He was at Malfoy's, he could figure that out, but it took a little longer for him to remember that they'd been watching a movie. He must have fallen asleep. He started to get up and, as he did, noticed the blanket that was usually on the back of the couch was wrapped around him though he never remembered pulling it down. He tore it off, messily throwing it back into place before getting to his feet and stretching to his full height with a yawn.
It was only when Kreacher interrupted asking if they were having dinner at Grimmauld that they broke apart ― though only to arm’s length.
Harry’s heart was pounding out of his chest. His mounting anger subsided as he listened to his friend, finally hearing the words he’d been feeling for so long.
Draco shifted, a shy smile playing on his own lips. Harry grinned at his friends. They really were the absolute best.
Harry kept searching for an opportunity to bring up what Ron had told him but nothing seemed right. He knew he had to say something though. The longer he waited, the more likely he would be to not say anything at all.
Draco was the poster child for blood-purity stigma, if his theory about them was correct then it shouldn’t be surprising that they were so alarmed. It wasn’t incredibly accusatory though. It was more like they were simply curious.
The moment the door had clicked shut, a thick silence filled the room. Harry looked at Ron through the dim blue light. “Er– He’s been–”
Harry wondered if Malfoy simply didn’t know what kindness was, or maybe he believed they were all too drunk to be serious, so he decided to show some kindness during the day as well. He started small, offering his spare ink well when he noticed Malfoy’s had run dry during Transfiguration, or asking if he wanted anything from the kitchen before he and Ron snuck down after hours, or inviting him to play exploding snap with him, Seamus, Dean, and Ron.
Zabini’s eyes softened once again. He tilted his head, not at all phased by their new proximity. “So you’ve even fallen to harming others for his sake? Do you mean to protect his honor? Sorry to break this to you, but he doesn’t have any.”
Harry had been so dumbfounded by how malnourished and disheveled Malfoy had been, he had completely forgotten about doing the standard procedures involved with a case like this. If he admitted the truth, not only would he be severely reprimanded – possibly fired if Robards heard about this ― but the whole case could be thrown out. "Yeah, of course. I'm not an idiot."
It all kept repeating in his head.
The shock of what had just happened finally began to spread off of him. Ron’s words—and Hermione’s before—finally hitting home. He pinched his eyes shut, rubbing the bridge of his nose beneath his glasses. “I know. I know. That’s why I didn’t mean to–“He stopped. His eyes opened.
“Ready?” Draco asked after they pulled away.
This would certainly be hard work. While Draco knew there was no chance of he and Longbottom ever becoming friends, there were some things he could do to make a small change in the right direction.
He lowered his wand, then traded it for his head in both hands. “I’m sorry,” Harry whimpered. “I just wasn’t expecting– I forgot–“ He shoved a sigh through his clenched teeth and unfolded himself, moving off the bed. He grabbed his glasses as he stood. “I’m sorry for disturbing you. Go back to sleep. I’ll go down to the common room to calm down.”
Harry kept trying to pull him forward, not understanding what was happening yet. It wasn't until he felt the low throb in his stomach, followed nearly instantly by a sharp pain across his head and back, that he realized he was making a mistake. Harry tumbled to the ground.
Ron replied, but Harry didn't listen. He rushed down to the Floos and back home. Kreacher didn't even bother greeting him anymore. Harry went up to his room too quickly and then right back out the door.
Malfoy wrinkled his nose as if he had just smelt something terrible. “Words like that are just uncalled for, Potter. If this was a real game, Hooch would be flagging you for unsportsmanlike behavior.”
Harry didn’t have to be told twice. He tossed the powder into the dying embers of the fireplace and might green flames burst forth. He leapt into them into them without hesitation. “The Ministry of Magic!”
“I mean, Robards knew before I did!” Ron exclaimed, gesturing down the street like their boss was standing there. “I’m your best friend. We went through a war together. I thought after all this time you would have finally stopped feeling like you have to hide stuff from us.” Harry’s arms slowly fell back to his sides. “We’re your friends. Let us help you. I mean, you literally died for us. And you can’t even trust that we’ll be okay with who you choose to sleep with?”
Harry pursed his lips. He was half tempted to be stubborn, but the look in Malfoy’s eyes finally pushed him out of the chair. Perhaps it was a bit childish to ruffle his hair as he stood, but it was almost involuntary when he saw Zabini’s stare from across the room.
Draco jumped to his feet. "I have to use the bathroom."
Harry clenched his jaw. Something in her stern gaze caused cold guilt to scratch down his back. It was as if she was guilting him for not having been around the years before, and he partly was.
Harry rolled his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest. "Please, Malfoy, it's you."
His feet suddenly stopped before his mind could process why. He stared at the open sign of the Chinese restaurant he'd been looking for. It was just around the corner from Malfoy. Harry could have walked past Malfoy's apartment a dozen times and never realized it ― never knew his childhood nemesis was starving himself just a few meters away.
“Lorena!” both men exclaimed after her. Draco sounded scandalized. Harry was purely amused.
Harry decided to put Teddy down before he nearly dropped him again. “Yeah, yeah, we know,” he assured as rubbed the back of his neck.
He invited Draco to drink with him the first night. Draco agreed, but it was cheap liquor and gave him a headache, so he didn’t drink much. The second night he declined, but Harry drank without him. As well as the third. And the fourth.
Harry’s attention got caught on the door. He didn’t notice Goyle’s hand slip into his pocket. Harry moved to uncharm the door just as Goyle pulled out his wand. A combination of Seeker reflexes and Auror training saved Harry. He managed to change the intent of his spell at the last second. A shield charm fell in front of him just before the red light could reach him.
“Slow?” Harry repeated as if testing out the feeling of the word in his mouth. “I don’t think so.”
She sat across from them at the table in the Common Room, where they’d all been working on homework. She had just overheard Harry once again admiring Malfoy’s hair.
“All you’ve ever done is cause us trouble. You aren’t worth saving. You never have been. What you used to call Hermione, what you would say about my family.” Ron’s fists tightened. “You let the Death Eaters into the castle. You housed Voldemort. You might have gotten sympathy from Harry, but you aren’t getting it from me.
Harry swallowed. “Everyone knows that there’s more than just friendship between us.”
Malfoy sighed. "Just be more careful next time, okay?"
“Not quite,” said the woman, her voice only a fraction smoother than Bellatrix’s. “I think you’re referring to my sister.” Draco stumbled as if this information had smacked him across the face. He glanced back at Teddy and the pieces began to fall into place. This was in fact his aunt but not the one he knew. He let Harry guide his arm to his side.
“What was that?” Malfoy demanded, his fierce tone just enough to keep Harry’s hands to himself. “This nice guy routine is one thing, but I never asked for you to save me. I’m not some damsel.”
A frown pulled on Malfoy’s face. “The more you speak about this cousin of yours, the less I believe that you ever cared about what I said. He seems far worse.”
“What if he doesn’t wake up?” Hermione mumbled, her eyes still lingering where Robbards had just turned a corner.
know. I’m still an idiot.” Malfoy turned on his heel and started back towards the castle.
“I’m going to make your hair look like a proper bird’s nest now, dirt and all!”
There was a shifting sound. Harry thought he saw the handle of the door giggle, but it never opened.
"Mostly?" Harry asked, already standing up to secure his wand in its holster.
“No, not about his injury. He was worried about his drinking.” Ron’s face fell. “He said something about Harry being an Auror that I can’t get out of my head. He said that Harry was more addicted to the danger of the job than he is to drinking.”
"Oh! What was that?" Malfoy urged, pointing at the television. "Can you go back?"
Harry chewed on his bottom lip in an attempt to keep from grinning to broadly. “That was sort of the idea.”
Draco stared at their hands. Harry stared at Draco.
She patted the hand he placed on her shoulder, a smile on her lips. “I’m just fine. Go on, I think your boyfriend is about to jump out of his skin.” She and Molly laughed as Harry turned a light color of pink.
Harry’s eyes moved to Pansy somewhere behind Draco. “Take care of him.” That’s right, he wasn’t alone. What he couldn’t bear was to be without Harry that day.
Upon Malfoy’s request, Harry spent the next night at his flat as well. By the third night, he attempted to go back to Grimmauld but ended up at Malfoy’s door in the middle of the night after a particularly nasty nightmare. However, by the fourth night, he was beginning to feel like he was taking up more than a little bit of space.
“Talking to Moaning Myrtle.”
Malfoy shrugged. "A little bit. I think I've read every book I own twice and the morning shows aren't as good as the ones in the evening. It's mostly just muggle news."
For the next week, it was Draco’s turn to drive Harry absolutely insane. It became a game of aggressive flirting. Harry would press Draco into the counter as he reached over the man to pull something out of a cupboard. In return, Draco would forget all sense of personal space on the sofa, resting his legs in Harry’s lap. It only escalated from then on. Every action led to flustered glares and smug smirks. It felt oddly like they were young again, trying to outdo one another, only now Harry didn’t even consider of complaining to his friends; he was left to suffer in silence.
It was a logical point and yet Harry was still left feeling confused. “If you believe that, then why did you agree to go with me?”
He remained in the library for the rest of the afternoon, as usual, however, he didn’t get a single piece of homework done. His mind was in Wonderland, but not in the same way it used to be. He didn’t find himself in the garden Alice so desperately wanted to get to, but in the handwritten notes that were traded between its pages.
Harry was ready to retaliate the instant the light faded. Goyle dove behind the cart. Harry jumped away from another shot. He grabbed Lenny and pushed him behind his desk, crouching down beside him. Harry and Goyle exchanged several shots before Lenny began to shout, “Careful! Careful!”  As he said this, one of Goyle’s curses hit a shelf of solvents, spilling them all over the place. “If some of those mix, we’ll all be dead.”
She sent him a scathing look. “You know full well we have a prefect meeting today.”
Kreacher shook his head, his ears flopping around. “Master has always had them. Usually tells Kreacher off or has Kreacher bring him whiskey to calm it. Lately, though, Mr. Malfoy has been helping him. Mr. Malfoy knows how to talk him through it. Has experience of his own, Kreacher thinks.”
Draco had been quiet for the rest of the evening. Harry wasn’t sure what to do or say. He considered the conversation between Draco and Andromeda and had a feeling Draco was doing the same.
“Yeah, Malfoy, come here,” Hannah called. “There’s plenty of room.”
Harry's guilt slapped him the second the words had come out. "No, no. It's okay. We'll come down and get it. I'm sorry."
“So you’ll be there?”
He couldn’t remember the last time someone didn’t sneer at him after he told them he was a Slytherin. His father always told him to be proud of it. They were all jealous. Other people’s objections simply gave them strength. And while he had armed himself in house pride, he never really stopped to wonder why they all hated them.
“No!”
“This one was taken in front of Draco’s apartment building,” Harry pointed at the picture on the front page. He flipped it and pointed at the one of them holding hands. “And this one was just around the corner.”
Harry walked around the counter towards the living room and knelt down beside the entertainment center. As he expected, everything had been pulled from the wall, including the power strip, which connected the VSR player and radio system. After plugging it all back in, he pressed the 'ON' button on the TV. It crackled to life.
He tossed his clothes on top of the vanity before beginning to strip off. He was only down to his pants when he caught his reflection in the large mirror and paused.
“You know about it?” Draco asked.
"I didn't do anything," Malfoy said in a low snarl, each word spat out like its own sentence. Harry didn't budge, only adding a raised brow to his impassive look. "Can you at least untie me so we can have a civilized conversation?"
“Harry James Potter!” Harry was satisfied by the second layer of redness which spread across Draco’s face. Making Draco flustered never got old.
“Oh come now,” said Malfoy, sitting back again. “It’s his only chance of winning, and you know it.”
Harry looked down at their hands. He really didn’t feel like letting go yet, but he was feeling better now. “Yeah.” He released, stuffing his tingling hand into his pocket.
It was so much easier to come straight over and change at Malfoy's instead of stopping at home first. He grabbed a set of clothes and went to the en suite to shower.
Zabini stepped out the door, and Harry’s weight seemed to pull with him, his tight fist begging to get closer to that smug face. This time, Malfoy ignored Hermione’s barricade and stepped around her to grab Harry’s shoulder. “Leave it.”
With a final squeeze, Harry let Draco go to join the small parade out of the room. However, the ex-Death Eater’s absence didn’t expel the tension in the room. Hermione had been looking at Harry oddly ever since he woke up, and she told him where Ron had gone, forcing him to admit to the truth. Ron was also looking at him, but it wasn’t the bewildered concern of Hermione’s gaze; he was just angry.
Robards let out a breathy laugh. He looked back down at the paper. “I can’t say I’m not disappointed. I was sort of hoping you’d be able to take over for me when I finally got tired of this gig. The only thing that made me hesitate was your temper.” He flicked the paper away. “And now that you’re getting it under control, you’re leaving. That’s just rich.”
“Tell me about it,” muttered the healer. “Speaking of, you’re due for another checkup.” Draco instantly moved out of her way to allow her access to her patient, but she hesitated upon nearing, an assessing gaze running over Draco. “Do you know the examination spell?”
A spark of relief appeared in Ron’s eyes. “That you’re dating?”
“Changing,” Harry said innocently. “I’m not wearing jeans to bed.”
“But you could use it,” Harry urged, not dialing back now.
Harry scoffed and reached up to ruffle Draco’s hair. “Attention whore,” he grumbled though, admittedly, a little more affectionately than he might have usually done.
Draco overlapped his hands with his own. The tears sprung from his eyes more freely than he meant for them. He was too embarrassed to meet Harry’s gaze again. “Please,” he whimpered, “stop being an idiot. Don’t just decide what’s best for everyone else on your own.”
They had just finished a case, after all. The next day would just be filling out the paperwork for it. He could do that under the influence of whatever headache relief potion he decided to take in the morning.
“Er, hey…” He instinctively glanced back at the Floo. Draco would be coming through any minute. He didn’t know why the idea of Ginny and Draco in the same room sent such a cold chill down his spine. “I didn’t think you were coming.”
Malfoy swallowed hard. His eyes fell to the ground, his face somehow looking even more sunken in. "He said it was for his brother. I guess some of the younger students snuck back to join the fight at the Battle of Hogwarts." Harry had to re-grip his wand. The picture of Colin Creevey's small body lying in the rubble of the school still haunted his dreams some nights. "I don't even remember him."
It was a clear thing to note that Potter had said “you’re” instead of “it” as he should have if they were still talking about his hair. Potter was not meeting his startled eyes, still watching the slow movement of his hand. He had to have misspoken.
“Do you think it will?”
Ron sighed. “Well, tell him that we don’t care. Mum’s even invited him to Christmas.”
“No, cockroaches like you are the ones with no honor,” Harry snarled. “All you care about is clinging onto whatever little power you have and throwing away people the moment they are no longer useful to you. You don’t care what it takes. Even if you have to bend over. As long as you get to the top, right?”
“And what’s the point of telling me that?” Harry interrupted. “You think that’s going to scare me off? Sorry, unlike someone else I know, my friend being gay doesn’t scare me.”
Harry huffed and sat back. “Yes, I remember that, very clearly,” he added with a light glare at Ron. “I’m just tired of being angry at people, okay? I sort of made up with my cousin. My aunt and uncle only ignore me, which is a significant step up from hating me like before. I only wanted to be friendly towards Malfoy, but it sort of got out of hand, and I honestly don’t mind it. He’s not half bad.”
Harry opened his mouth to comment but she went on. “Besides, I have a feeling not that many people know about that there.” She gestured at the men’s intertwined fingers. “Apparently I’m not the only one not keeping everyone up to date on their relationship?” She narrowed her eyes accusingly at Draco.
“Harry,” Draco spoke warily, shaking his head slowly. “Don’t…”
“What?” Harry stood up as well, almost on the verge of throwing himself across the table to stop her. “No! Why would you do that?”
Harry leaned forward, and for a moment, Draco thought he was going to kiss him. He didn’t lift his head, though. Instead, he tucked his face into the crook of Draco’s neck. It was an oddly familiar sensation. It reminded Draco of that day once again, when they embraced in the corridor upstairs, the first time Harry ever let someone comfort him.
Harry wanted to kiss her and scream at her simultaneously as he watched Hermione stomp out of the hall. His body gradually lowered back into his seat before his eyes found Ron again. Perhaps he was right. Perhaps Harry was entirely oblivious.
bad?” Hermione echoed a layer of horror in her voice. She twisted around. “Malfoy is alive right?”
“It doesn’t matter. Get out, Malfoy. McGonagall’s doing a bed check.”
Ron’s face twisted up like he had caught a whiff of something that smelt bad. “Please don’t tell me we have to start inviting her to holidays, too? Mum would have a heart attack.”
He wasn’t buying that this was the whole story. That may be an awkward encounter, but it shouldn’t equate to this much fidgeting. Malfoy knew better than to try to end it there and eventually went on. “Well, he’s under this impression about us, that we’re…more…than friends.”
Harry was smirking as if Malfoy had played right into his trap, and yet Malfoy still went on. “I actually have two. One from the 1994 Quidditch World Cup and one for Puddlemere United.”
“Always.”
Deciding that Malfoy didn't appear distressed, Harry settled to wait downstairs instead of camping out in his hall. He hoped it would mean he'd get fewer dirty looks from Malfoy's neighbors. He grabbed a muggle newspaper from a dispenser nearby and took a seat at a bench in an attempt to blend in.
It wasn’t as fluid as Harry’s efforts, but the Aurors often had to apparate all over Britain ― it was the one thing he had a real reason to better at than Draco. Despite such little use, they stumbled into the kitchen of the flat and found neither of their persons splinched. All in all, he did well, and Harry told him as much.
Eventually, just the idea of leaving his safe, muggle hideout to go to the shop sent him spiraling into a panic. No one would expect to find Draco Malfoy there. Or at least, they didn't before. Four months, that was all the peace he could have, and they were back. They might as well just have put him in Azkaban. At least then, he didn't feel pathetic when he couldn't bring himself to break past the threshold.
However, when he rounded the railing and started down the stairs, he found one of the last people he was expecting settled in front of the fireplace. Harry’s steps slowed. He momentarily considered turning around but his feet continued to carry him down.
“Fun?” Malfoy scoffed.
“I will,” Harry assured. “Thank you.” And Harry meant it. He saw no reason to hold a grudge. After everything he’d been through he knew that mistakes didn’t make a person, it’s how they fixed them that did.
The way Draco blushed and refused to meet Harry’s eye did something heinous to Harry’s heart. He couldn’t believe Draco had liked him for that long. Then again, Harry didn’t think he could pinpoint the exact moment he realized he liked Malfoy either. Maybe it was during one of the Saturday they spent at the café. Maybe it happened while they were curled on the couch watching Will & Grace. Or maybe it started as early as watching Draco force himself how to use chopsticks, with that determined little crease between his eyebrows.
Hermione hummed thoughtfully. “I suppose, when it comes right down to it, it always has been the four of us in one way or another.” She gave Draco a feathery smile. “No one should be all that surprise that it ended the same way.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Is that what this is about? Draco?” There were a few staggering glances at the sound of the Slytherin’s given name coming from Harry, but no one commented.
Long break equals long chapter. Hope you enjoy!
The moment it looked like Ron wouldn’t turn back, Harry started towards the usually forgotten office. It was late. There was little in way of a crowd. Still, Harry being being who he was earned earned several perturbed looks. He didn’t mind them. His focus was on the place on the office door which read CARETAKERS.
Harry grabbed his wrist and gave it a weak squeeze. “It’s okay, you didn’t know. We didn’t even know we were looking for two people. They’re both in custody now. That’s what matters, right?”
One last shaky breath fell from Harry’s lips, and he wrapped his arms securely around Malfoy’s waist, burying his damp face into the crook of Malfoy’s neck.
“Draco,” Harry cooed.
“Access? Sure but I’d never look at them,” he added staunchly. “They let us into a whole heap of places others aren’t allowed. I don’t need to go snooping in files to know things.”
Harry grabbed one of the cushions behind him to throw at the other man. "What is that supposed to mean?"
Harry tilted his head, looking at the other man oddly. "Why wouldn't I?" Harry began to think back to their past conversations, trying to find when he'd ever said he wouldn't be coming by. He came up blank. "And why did you have the door locked?"
Harry's brows raised into his fringe. "Are you going to take pictures of me in the bath?"
"Good afternoon," greeted a tired-looking girl in an apron. Harry pulled Malfoy, who was too busy staring at the muttering uni students, up to the counter. "What can I get for you?"
Draco read the note several times before giving an uncharacteristic snort. How could one confuse moonseed and moonstone?
Despite his current inquiries, learning origami was not the reason Draco had returned to Hogwarts. He had meant to come back to finish his N.E.W.T.s since there had been a notable disturbance in the tests the year before. The defeat of the Dark Lord was not easily ignored.
It had apparently been a much anticipated announcement though Harry had been somewhat out of the loop during his travels. It was so anticipated, in fact, that Molly had invited even more people than usual although that was somewhat of a gradual development over the years. In addition to everyone who had come for Harry’s party, there were also several Order members and Hogwarts staff in attendance.
He scowled. His grip tightened around his wand. “I didn’t ask for them.”
Harry scoffed. “Not me.”
Ron’s mouth fell open. His eyes darted between the two men before landing resolutely back on his boss. “You mean you knew about this, too? Am I the only one who didn’t?”
When they both stood straight and turned towards the subjects of their conversation, they found that most of the room’s occupants were staring at them. The Patil twins who’d been studying at the table just behind them were giggling to each other. Neville and Hannah, who sat on the couch facing them and had been talking to Ron and Hermione, both looked bewildered. Harry’s eyes fell on his two best friends last, who both wore concern tainted frowns.
Robards directed a pointed glare at the door beside them. “Your partner is a head-strong idiot.”
"He wouldn't have seen me out."
Malfoy’s expression was scathing. “You have got to be joking.”
Harry got up on his knees, leaning over Draco as he began to whack him again, letting it punctuate each of his words like their own sentence. "I'm. Not. Bad. At. Snogging!"
He gave Draco’s wrist another squeeze and began to brush a circle into his palm with his thumbnail, all the while looking at the other occupants of the room and speaking to keep the attention off the movement. “Is there anything new on the girl?”
He glanced at Hermione. She waved her hand away. “Go, I’ll take care of Draco. Just, please, don’t do anything too stupid.”
"Malfoy, Malfoy," Harry tried to cut off his rant while simultaneously attempting not to become completely undone with laughter. "They have tableware; this is just a cultural thing. In the U.K., we just use them for certain foods," he gestured to the box of noodles in front of him, "like this."
The rest of Tuesday and Wednesday, he went without eating. The abrupt fast did not do well for his body. He had forgotten the feeling of his body eating away at itself, searching for whatever nutrients were left. Every step he took, he wondered if his legs would just give way.
The motherly woman patted his arm. “It’s really okay dear,” she urged for the tenth time. “No one deserves to sit at home alone on Christmas. Though,” she glanced at the woman who sat alone with perfect posture at the dining table, “I expect that she’d prefer it.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “It’s coffee, and you’ll be fine. Stop being dramatic.”
"No, that's okay," Harry interrupted. Kreacher had brought up a fantastic point. Harry had been so distracted, trying to get all of his work done that he had completely skipped lunch. He could go out to eat, which should at least take an hour. There was a nice looking Chinese restaurant a few blocks over he'd meant to try out. "I'm going out. Don't wait up, Kreacher."
Draco instantly stiffened. His hand instinctively twitched for his wand lying on the table, the action not at all going unnoticed by Patil. Her eyes narrowed, the scowl deepening. Draco had shared enough Charms classes with Padma Patil and the other Ravenclaws to know they were fierce with charms. He also knew she’d been a part of Dumbledore’s Army like Luna. Paranoia was expected.
He would get to see Harry soon.
With a sigh, he stopped folding and refolding the parchment beneath his fingers. His curiosity about paper dragons had faded.
"Er, well, you'll have to…" Harry held out his arm, gesturing for Malfoy to grab hold.
is you have to show him you trust him, too.” Her lips were in a firm line, eyes berating. “We’re your best friends, Harry. If anyone knows how you are, it’s us?”
“It doesn’t matter. You knew about it,” he said sternly, crossing his arms.
“Sorry, mate, but I’ve had this one in the books since sixth-year.”
It appeared to be mostly extra stock, stacked so high on shelves it nearly touched the ceiling. Past the rows, pressed into the back corner were two desks. Each overflowed with parchment and blueprints for new ideas. While the contents of both desktops looked prepared to be picked back up again to resume the mad genius which undoubtedly unfolded there, Harry noticed one had a fine layer of dust coating everything. It looked to have been completely undisturbed likely for close to over three years. Harry also noticed what he might have assumed to be a decorative wall mirror but a piece of cloth was draped over it halfhazard, leaving a bottom corner of the reflective material to still peak through. Harry tried to push the reasoning out of his mind.
Harry wanted to be angry. He wanted to start a fight just to do something, but seeing the distance in the once lively eyes of George Weasley made him rethink that path. Maybe deserve wasn’t the right word. The Weasleys had done nothing but good. They truly didn’t deserve their loss.
She shrugged, pulling her bag over her shoulder. “You two share one brain cell. Someone has to show you how to use it.”
Harry remained silent, but his eyes were as loud as ever.
“What? Why would you-” Harry stopped. He glanced down at where he and Draco were still touching ― shoulder-to-shoulder, hands sliding against one another’s as they walked. Kreacher had likely saved him from a very awkward conversation. “Er, can you go over there and tell them I won’t be by.”
The last bell of the year wrung loud and clear through the halls of Hogwarts. “Have a good summer,” Harry called, giving a wave.
“Been a while, Malfoy,” Dean greeted. “You, too, Harry?”
Instead of disposing of the book, she returned it to Draco with the addendum that he would keep it well hidden.
He knew Draco wasn’t going to let him get around this now. “She said the same thing Ron told me.” Harry climbed off the bed and took careful steps towards Draco. “They want us to be happy, and I know for a fact that you’ve made me happier and, from what I’ve seen, you look happier too.” He took step closer. “So why can’t we be together? You asked me once what pleases me? It’s you. It’s being around you that makes me the happiest. Even when I’m not okay, I just… I want to be with you. Please let me.”
? It’s not that hard of a word to say. Your son is gay, Lucius. I should know! I’ve been living with him for almost six months. I’ve also been fu-”
He was just about to try to get up again ― not sure what he would do once he was on his feet ― when the door opened again.
When the tears subsided, they simply sat there in silence for even longer. Feeling that most of her tears had dried, Hermione finally untangled herself from the boys first. “How about some hot chocolate,” she suggested.
to get better.”
“You wanna do everything on your own? You wanna drink yourself into a coma,” Draco’s voice was cracking. “Go ahead. I’m not going to watch. If you’re ‘fine’ then you don’t need me. Go.”
Draco returned to his spot and took out his own bit of parchment to write on.
Malfoy looked up. “You really want to know?”
Harry was just leaving work on Thursday when his eyes brushed past the memorial statue which had taken the place of the last two monuments which stood there ― the
She didn’t say anything, and Malfoy seemed to not think too deeply on Harry’s easy suggestion to leave his friends behind. He was surprised, but the tilt of his head made him look mildly impressed for some odd reason. “Okay.”
“But you’re missing the big one,” Pansy hummed. Her eyes glittered as she peaked into the restricted file over the Auror’s shoulder. He snapped his head up. She expected to get yelled at for snooping, but instead, he was waiting for her to continue. “What happened three years ago today?”
Harry’s heart was still pounding against his ribcage. “Who said it didn’t?”
“Yeah, that’s sort of his thing.”
Ron slipped under his covers and pointed his wand at the light. The room flooded with darkness. “In the morning, Harry, please. I’m not going to be able to sleep if we have this conversation now.”
“Hm?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Cute. Come on.” He snatched Zabini’s wrist before he could try to argue and tore down the hall.
Harry frowned. "Fine, stay up if you want but don't wait to eat because of me." His eyes skimmed over Draco's body, which was finally beginning to fill out again and looking marginally healthy.
He crossed the room to go to his own bed but paused just short of getting into it. He turned back to the other boy who was watching him move. “You aren’t ready to go to sleep yet, right?”
“I’ve had a loose wand pointed at me enough times,” he finally said when he saw their faces begin to shift from shock to accusation.
“Why is it always me that did something?”
Draco’s lip was trembling. He squeezed Harry’s hand, who returned the gesture. “You’re a good man. You just have to believe it yourself.”
“I’m fine.”
But you and I knew the truth of it in advance
Draco glanced at the fuming redhead and his brooding boss. He shook his head. “I’ll be fine.”
After a quick rinse, he got dressed and met Malfoy in the kitchen again. Malfoy was already heating up the leftovers. He handed a plate to Harry as he passed him to pull his own out of the microwave, then followed Harry to the dining room.
Minutes turned to hours. The street lamps began to flicker on when Harry's stomach reminded him that he'd skipped lunch again.
No one was suddenly giving free passes or had forgotten anything that happened. If anything, it gave them all the ability to address it. Berating and arguments happened over meals but never with intentions to harm. Harry was pretty sure that Draco actually liked the mental sparring, especially when bantering with Ron. He was also a new voice in conversations about quidditch, and Harry found himself glaring at a grinning Seamus, who appeared to steal his attention whenever Harry clearly wanted it. Dean also seemed to purposefully get into arguments about muggle sports being better, which somehow aligned Seamus, Ron, and Draco on one side while Justin occasionally took up Dean’s.
Malfoy snorted. "I would pay to see people's expressions when fat Harry Potter walks up to their door to save them."
“Malfoy.”
Hermione let out an audible sigh as she turned forward again―Ron hastily hiding his hand before she could spot it. The look of relief on her face did not look manufactured at all.
His heart was getting louder and louder as he got closer. An unashamed smile spreading across his face the farther he got from prying eyes. He rounded the corner.
There might not have been much of a change between them, even after their minor scuffle; but, that same night, they had once again crossed paths.
Draco’s eyes burned, but his chest burned hotter. “Have you ever considered that I feel the same way?”
“I didn’t!” Draco insisted. “She figured it out…” Harry eased but was still a little confused, “the first time she was over.”
Instead, Malfoy raised the tip of his wand to Harry's mouth and whispered something. Harry instantly felt his skin begin to mend itself, his bottom lip returning to regular size.
“Even drunk and half asleep, you only live to irritate me,” Malfoy grumbled. He tried to move away, but he didn’t get far, Harry’s fingers tightening around the hair.
"No," Harry grumbled. "Robards says he's doing everything he can, but he's too distracted with everything going on tomorrow." So, Harry did know what tomorrow was.
Ron let out a loud snort. “That’s ridiculous.”
His eyes moved down. It was the left hand that sat atop their knees. He could almost feel the darkness seeping out from the cuff of his sleeve where that forbidding mark hid.
"Not ever, really."
"Why are you tying me up?" Malfoy snarled, struggling in his restraints. "This is my house! He's the one attacking me!"
Harry noted Terry Boot and Michael Corner muttering something to one another. They’d both been there seventh-year. Only the trio and possible muggle-borns like Dean and Justin Finch-Fletchley remained in the dark.
He stuck the book back into its place then returned to his studies. It lasted all of twenty minutes before he began to doodle in the margins of his notes. Deep down he really hoped the person would respond. It was becoming extremely boring to be Draco Malfoy.
“Then tell him how you feel and see what happens.” Harry knew that was a bad idea. He wouldn’t have listened had Zabini not gone on, “Before I do.”
“I don’t give a damn. I’m not letting you out on the field until I get written confirmation from a healer that you’re fit enough for the job.”
That was enough for Draco. He was sick of hearing how ‘fine’ Harry was every time he walked into the house with bruises or cuts or dried blood on his robes. He was sick of Harry acting like he had to do everything alone. Even when he had panic attacks, he rarely allowed Draco in the same room. He was just so done with letting Harry lie to himself.
It couldn’t have just been a one-way street, though. Draco wasn’t exactly a sharing person. It took weeks before he really began to describe his nightmares, and there had to be stuff he was leaving out, although Harry knew that the one that bothered him the most was the fiendfyre. He also knew that the best way to get him to relax was to talk about his mother, that while his father was gone for long days at the ministry, Narcissa would chase him through the manicured rows of the garden or bring him about the albino peacocks to feed and study their beauty—they were the first thing he learned how to draw well. Harry also knew about Zabini. He knew that Draco had thoroughly convinced himself that Zabini had actual feelings for him and that Zabini had done everything in his power to tear that idea away, to make Draco feel unlovable. He could see it in his eyes every time the tentative topic would come about, and Harry would hurry to change the subject for him, as well as so he didn’t have to see it anymore. He should have addressed it. He should have worked harder to prove it wrong.
Ron and Hermione remained for dinner and the elephant in the room was ignored. Harry would get to the bottom of this but he wasn’t about to sacrifice all of his peace to it. After all, that’s what whoever had done this intended.
Draco walked up the hill outside the Burrow towards a small cluster of trees. He could hear Arthur and his eldest sons carrying on as he passed the shed, none of them noticing him. He didn’t really know where he was going. He was only hoping he could put the horrible Weasley house out of sight. The warmth had been suffocating. What was worse was that he knew he’d never have a part of that. He would always have his father’s eyes… Cold and unforgiving. All anyone would ever see when they looked at him was his father’s son. He would only ever be a Malfoy.
Ron wasn’t even supposed to be there on a Saturday, but he was helping with the Winchester case. It hadn’t been a big deal, only two wizards getting into a drunken row; the real damage was that they’d been too loud and were spotted by several muggles. The Auror office was helping the Obliviators track down several of the muggles who had left before they got there to clean it up.
Draco’s fingers held on tighter. If it wasn’t for Harry’s shirt, there might have been scratch marks. Instead of complaining, Harry gave him a comforting squeeze and continued to hum assurances.
“Thank you again, Molly.” Harry couldn’t stop himself from continually thanking Mrs. Weasley ever since they arrived at the burrow with Narcissa Malfoy in tow.
Draco knew what Harry was thinking, and he knew how much the whole Skeres case bothered him. He had figured out a while ago that nothing had happened to his attacker ― or he at least assumed it when Harry never brought it up again. He wasn’t surprised. The war had not been over long enough for all prejudices to be erased ― from either side. Maybe it never would be. Draco certainly didn’t expect it to in his lifetime. There was no use fighting it anymore.
He reached out a gentle hand, barely applying any pressure to Harry's bare forearm. Harry turned his head towards him. He blinked a few times, and his eyes slowly began to clear up as Draco moved his hand up and down his arm. The muscles around Harry's mouth tugged involuntarily, a ghostly smile forming on his lips.
“We’re talking about Blibbering Humdingers,” answered Luna in a hum, as if not at all noticing the tension in the air.
Even though it was Tuesday, he couldn’t force himself to Floo to Grimmauld. Maybe he’d bring a shiny new quid for Kreacher to add to his collection as an apology the next time he visited. However this fleeting thought was his only remorse and it too vanished when he arrived in front of the apartment building.
Draco’s gaze snapped to the man. He appeared utterly betrayed. Harry felt remorse only for a moment before Pansy suddenly lit up. “He did!”
Hermione gave an overly exaggerated eye roll. “Don’t even get me started on that. Having children carry inkwells in bags is just absurd, not to mention scrolls of paper. And not even to mention-”
Zabini’s eyes darkened. Whether he was embarrassed or angered, Harry did not care. He released him and stepped away. This wasn’t worth his time.
Malfoy’s head snapped up. “Really.”
Curiously, it was Draco who brought it up. “Are you okay?” He leaned tentatively against the corner of Harry’s bed, watching as Harry exchanged his uniform shirt for the threadbare Weird Sisters t-shirt that had once been Bill’s. “You’ve barely said a word since you arrived at dinner, and you were practically shaking.”
Why did he care? It was Malfoy, after all. Who cares if he starved himself? Harry had cleared his debt with the Malfoy family by keeping them from Azkaban; what they did with that freedom was up to them. If Malfoy wanted to become a recluse, he was welcome to it.
“Harry?” she asked, bewildered.
Harry nodded.
It hadn’t made sense to Draco back then. Now it did. Now he could see it all laid out in front of him like words written on a page. Even if it left a bitter taste in his mouth, he had to admit that Albus Dumbledore was a great wizard.
Harry went back downstairs and found Andromeda in the sitting room. She was busying herself with taking down the last few streamers that were still pinned around the room. “He’s down,” Harry told her, grabbing his jacket off the back of the sofa. “Thank you for having us over.”
Little Victoire was the Weasley family’s pride and joy and probably the greatest inspiration for George to get out of his slump; he loved making her laugh. Harry couldn’t imagine if he brought Draco around the same house as her. He’d likely have to explain to Narcissa Malfoy why her son was dead.
She nodded, her eyes falling down to the cup in her hand. “You weren’t exactly sober, though, were you?”
Harry shrugged. "What can I say? I never asked to be the savior of anything, and everyone acts like I did it all by myself." He scrubbed at the back of his neck. "I was chasing Horcruxes half of the time, and I only survived that because Ron and Hermione were with me. There were a lot of people who gave a lot more than I did who deserve the praise.
It still didn’t feel exactly normal for the four of them to be cordial in each other’s company. If Harry’s old self had looked at this situation, he likely wouldn’t understand his need for this—granted, he wouldn’t understand Malfoy at all. Maybe it was the worried glances from Hermione whenever he and Malfoy stayed late in the Potions room, or perhaps Ron’s apparent dejection whenever Harry chose Malfoy to play quidditch over him. He knew he had to do something before the tension became too great and someone snapped.
A petulant noise came out of Malfoy’s mouth. “You’re a child,” he huffed. “Go away. Go socialize or something, or whatever Gryffindors do.”
There were no arguments. People made their way to the fireplace in an orderly manner, a few going upstairs to call others down. Liquor was retrieved by the Hufflepuffs. Before long, they were all in their usual half-circle. Everyone was there besides, of course, the Slytherins.
“Because they’re going to hate us,” said Draco, his voice just as weak as he felt. “Your friends could barely handle us being friends. What are they going to think? What is everyone going to think? They already hate me. I’m not dragging you into that.”
Despite Harry's words, Malfoy continued to glare at the chicken like it was covered in mold. A terrible idea came to Harry's mind, but it was halfway out of his mouth before he realized how bad it was. "Well, you could-"
Ron rolled his eyes. “His father’s a tool and we all know it. Even Voldemort was happy to use him like scrap.”
Harry swallowed hard, and it looked like he was going to say no, but he eventually nodded.
Harry put a hand over his mouth, but his eyes were still sparkling with mirth. He looked at Pansy. “He did do that, didn’t he?”
“I know you care,” Harry interrupted Ron’s rant. “I trust you, I swear. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about Draco, or the nightmares, or the panic attacks.” The way Ron’s jaw twitched told Harry that he was right to think this wasn’t just about Draco. “I’m still not used to having anyone to talk to, about
Pansy rolled here eyes. “That whole mess with that machine of yours,” she gestured at the espresso machine with a scowl on her face, “was not my fault. I didn’t tell you to stare at my bum.”
Malfoy attempted a long shaky breath and held onto it for a second before it burst out of his lungs again. Harry nodded quickly. "That's good, that's good. Keep going."
There was another deep crease on Malfoy's brow when he turned back around. "You mean that box that makes buzzing sounds every once in a while."
Before he could start to question it, Harry answered, “My resignation.”
They ran to the door. Kreacher lingered behind. The breath was knocked out of the pair simultaneously. Harry was in the nook between his bedside table and bed, his legs brought up to his chest, fingers twisted in his hair, and his face tucked between his knees. He rocked a bit, trying to keep himself grounded with the pain of the corner of the nightstand digging into his back.
“Come sit with us.” It wasn’t Harry who had called to Draco. Parvati was waving him over.
Harry shook his head. Of course Draco was right. “You all think I’m under a love potion do you?”
"Oh thank Merlin! There it is!" Draco tore his arm out of the bag with a bruised banana in the palm of his hand. He peeled the banana and broke off a small piece, "Look what I have, Stella! Breakfast!"
"He most definitely is. The prideful git probably cries himself to sleep over it," Hermione said with a roll of her eyes. The girl then turned back to Harry, the inquisitive look returning to her face. "You still haven't told me about your dream. It was about Malfoy's parents and what else?"
"Yes, Father."
"Alright," the knocker mumbled. "Here's a simple one: what is brown and sticky?"
The three boys stared at Draco with an unspoken question. However, Draco did not have to hear it to know what it was. The blond sighed before responding, "My whole entire family has been Slytherins for since--" Draco stopped to think. "well... forever," He ended lamely, a light blush rising to his cheeks.
Coming to a conclusion, Draco lifted the glass to his mouth and took a large gulp of water.
my twitter: @TODOROTl (the "i" in todoroti is actually a lower-case L)
"Mother got married again," Blaise said causing the rest of the kids to raise their eyebrows in amusement.
"And so, we meet again, young Draco."
"Well done," the knocker said. "but please do remember that my riddles are never this elementary."
Draco looked down at the glass of water and then back up at the Weasley matriarch who had a worried look etched onto her plump face.
"Harry Potter."
Hermione rolled her eyes at the exchange. "Can you two be any more childish-"
A few moments passed before Draco fully understood the reality of his dire situation. Draco was not a Slytherin. He was a
The Gryffindors theorize. Draco settles into his new room. And it's confirmed: Draco is not the baby daddy.
“Wait,” Harry said sharply, “Remus, what's going on? Why's Malfoy here?”
there was painful. The Ravenclaws had to climb a spiral staircase to reach their common room and, to be blunt, the spiral staircase was huge. The stairs went as far up as five stories and Draco was sure that if Vincent or Gregory were to climb it, they would have collapsed just at the sight of it. As the first-years struggled to climb up the stairs, Robert Hilliard, one of the prefects leading them, attempted to motivate them with statements such as: "You'll all be so fit after this year!" and "Two floors down! Three to go!"
“Ah,” he glanced at the clock over the door, “he should be down soon to trade off with me.” He gestured to the old settee shoved against the wall. “You’re welcome to wait, Mr. Potter.”
"Mhm," Malfoy grumbled through pursed lips as he shut the door. Malfoy moved past Harry towards the living area, leading Harry inside.
Harry shrugged. “I just tried it one day. I liked it, that’s all. Why?”
“What is a chainsaw?”
Ron shoved at the other man, smashing Draco’s head against the mirror behind him. “As if you don’t know!” he bellowed. “He’s lying unconscious in St. Mungo’s because of you.”
. He always apologized for things he didn’t need to apologize for. If he caused any small inconvenience, he would apologize profusely. But the big stuff, like throwing his life around like it was worth less than a knut, he would never say sorry for ― even if it did feel like it was shorting all of his friends’ lifespans by at least ten years.
“No, no,” Harry said quickly, shaking his head. “I’m a horrible patient. All I do is piss and moan.”
The conversation moved on, and everyone got a little drunker and a little more tired. Harry didn’t really notice when Draco’s head ended up on his shoulder nor when he began to find Draco’s fingers so interesting to play with.
There was one second of absolute silence. The girls were glancing at each other, entirely confused. Harry could only hear ringing in his ears. Then he was on his feet. One hand snapped around Malfoy’s wrist, and he dragged him up.
Harry simply shrugged. He was still riding his high, and he wasn’t going to let anything pull him down.
Upon closer inspection, their interactions were not new. They were still berating each other with insults—granted, less vicious ones—but they now responded to each of them with half-hearted eye rolls or smiles.
Harry blinked once before his thoughts returned to reality. However, Draco’s words still didn’t make sense. He began to wonder if he had mistaken hearing him speak until the blue-grey gaze found him. “You’re looking at me like he did.”
Malfoy's eyes fell to the metal legs of the table that once stood where he lay. "I couldn't attack you if I wanted to. You kept my family out of Azkaban."
“What do you-”
Only when Harry levered his eyelids open and saw bright white instead of cozy browns and reds did he begin to think harder. He slowly sat up, rubbing at his eyes as he patted around himself for his glasses.
“We have to go now,” Harry said, feeling panic spike in his chest. “We still have to jump off of Essex to even make it to London.”
Cold understanding finally found its way to Malfoy. His initial thoughts said that he didn’t believe it. Potter always seemed so put together. He helped Malfoy through his own panic attacks for Merlin’s sake.
"...Will you share your soul with me?
Sorry I suddenly stopped updating. I was writing a chapter nearly daily and I got a little burnt out. I also started reading a beautiful Drarry fic called Running On Air and I lost all sense of responsibility so I could finish it. Anyways, this super long update should hopefully make up for it.
Harry knew the answer to that was yes. Draco never brought it up, so he never told him, hoping he’d forget the whole thing. He had a feeling he hadn’t but that he wasn’t surprised that Skeres hadn’t gotten a severe punishment ― more mandatory counseling, and he’d keep the tracker on his wand for a year. It was a joke.
Malfoy didn’t want to cause a scene, Harry thought. He didn’t blame him but this wasn’t right. If anything, it aggravated Harry more. There was a time when Malfoy would not have let anyone walk so easily over him, and he likely would have overjoyed at publicly humiliating the person who tried. Where had all of his willpower gone?
Draco scoffed. “If you’re referring to Granger our third-year, then I’ll have you remember that she slapped me, not punched. And, honestly, if those are the habits of mine you’re picking up, then you should probably stop being an Auror. People will think you’re batting for the other team.”
"Why did you walk here?" Draco asked, moving aside to let him in.
Draco made a loud, sharp noise. “You’re translucent, Potter.”
Harry scowled at the clock above the bar. He wasn't sure if he was reading the hands right; the two pints of beer and three shots of whisky were spoiling his naturally impaired sight. Considering the slurred songs coming from the table of rugby players, it was likely past time to leave.
“But I forgot all of that because he was getting better. I noticed the change, but I didn’t know why, and I was too afraid to ask because I didn’t want it to stop. I didn’t know it was because of you. Then when he told me,” Ron shook his head, slumping forward as he tried to level himself once more, “I was too angry to believe what he was trying to tell me. I didn’t listen.”
Draco grabbed his wand and hurried to unhook the latch. He had stopped leaving the door unlocked since Harry usually just apparated into the flat.
Harry swallowed. “Yes, I think I do.”
He ignored her like he always would have and moved onto his job.
“Well, you look a little peaky.”
Zabini’s head snapped up, cold ire hardening his features. “I did what I had to do to survive.”
When he opened the door, Harry stood there with a heavy smile and tired eyes. "Sorry, I should have buzzed in to warn you."
Harry gave a half-hearted salute. “Yes, sir.” Draco rolled his eyes and resumed looking for a mess where there was none.
Draco reviewed what he’d written. Nothing appeared too telling. He didn’t know who he was speaking to but he had a feeling that just about anyone would be aghast at realizing they were speaking to Malfoy. He wasn’t really sure why he cared. It wasn’t as if they’d respond.
"Oh, wow, she's exactly like Pansy then."
Draco instantly smacked his hand, but the biscuit was already in his mouth. “You have your own food at your table, don’t you? What do you want?”
“What’s the point?” Harry interjected. “You’re already dating each other.”
“Do you think I have motives for being around Ron or Hermione?” Harry urged. “Because I don’t! I just like being around them because they’re my friends. I like them. I like you. Can’t that be enough of a reason?”
Short panic shot through Draco as he tried to recall what he’d last written. Maybe it had come out wrong. He hadn’t meant to be insulting.
“Right, but why-” Draco didn’t finish, glancing at the bathroom door. Harry looked as well. He had considered that, but it seemed silly. They were both blokes, after all.
Harry nodded vigorously, deciding to go with it while he could. They both tugged on their shoes and coats then headed out the door. Though it wasn't drizzling at the moment, the overcast above warned them to bring an umbrella just in case. When they got out onto the street, they found the usual quiet of Park Row, but Malfoy began to tense up when they got to the main road. Harry instinctually looped their arms together, partly to comfort and also to keep them from getting separated on the busy pavement.
He kissed his jaw. “I love you.”
Harry’s eyes flitted between the pair. The sense of relief was physical, no matter how much each of them tried to play it off. It stirred something in his chest. “Would it be a bad thing if I did?”
It was never that easy. Draco put his pencil down and turned more towards Harry. “What were you thinking?”
He got to Malfoy's door, finding it closed as he was becoming accustomed to, and knocked twice. "Food's here." He dropped it on the ground and turned away.
Malfoy hadn't gone to Azkaban, though. Harry knew that as a certainty. He had been the one to assure it. After Draco's mother, Narcissa Malfoy, had lied to Voldemort and saved him, he felt responsible for repaying the debt by speaking at their trial. His testimony had saved them and put quite a strain on several of his friendships. Nevertheless, he knew it was right, and he considered his debt paid.
Obligated to listen, Kreacher snapped out of the kitchen before Harry had even gotten to the door.
"What are you smiling about?" Malfoy snapped Harry out of his thoughts.
“I don’t understand having a disapproving family? I grew up with muggles who hated magic. Trust me, I get it. I also understand that you’re a coward. Draco deserves better. So you’re going to leave him the hell alone, or you’re going to deal with me. No more humiliating him. No more locking him out of the room. No more.”
Malfoy scoffed and shoved him back. However, instead of removing his hand, his fingers clung to the material of Harry’s short sleeve. Harry’s stomach dropped. Malfoy’s eyes were swimming with an emotion that he had only ever seen in a mirror before.
“Whose side are you on?” Malfoy grumbled, swatting Harry away after Ron had taken his castle.
“That’s mine.” Harry’s voice was barely audible.
. It had been the last gift he had ever received from his mother’s sister Andromeda. Lucius had been furious at the idea of the muggle book in the house and Narcissa assured she would get rid of it.
"March 12."
Malfoy glared at the clear shock on his face, crossing his arms. "I'll stay here if you're going to make a big deal about it."
Harry’s eyes snapped open. He recognized the voice, but his foggy brain wasn’t making the connection. He reached out for his glasses and summoned a small Lumos to see what was going on.
Draco’s smile deepened. He hummed in comfortable accord. “I’ll accept that if you accept that you’re pretty slow.”
Malfoy fidgeted. He began to pluck at his sweater, loosening another thread. He blinked at the bar as if it held a calendar. "Two…" he paused, considering what he said. "Two months?" He didn't sound sure at all. Suddenly, Harry wasn't so sure that he'd actually been there six months, to begin with. It seemed like it could have been a year, and Malfoy wouldn't have even noticed.
Ron eventually arrived with the food. Hermione was true to her word the whole night and never brought up Malfoy again. It didn’t mean that Harry didn’t think about him. They picked probably the worst takeaway for him. Like a heartbroken schoolgirl, he stared at the packet of chopsticks Ron refused to use ― he claimed utensils were supposed to make it easier to eat, not harder.
This option lightened Malfoy's face for a moment, but it fell once again. He shook his head. "That's just silly. Besides, this is a lot to carry on your own."
For a moment, Harry lost all function in his lungs. Was she really saying what he thought she was? Had the professors been gossiping about him and Draco while they were at school? Once her words settled, a broken laugh fell out of his mouth. Why was he surprised, it was Hogwarts after all? “Of course they don’t,” he said through easing chortles.
Draco only laughed at Harry’s attempt to smother him. His voice was greatly muffled but Harry thought he heard, “Much better.”
“You sound like him.” The accusation felt like a hundred hexes to the chest. “
“We’re right here!” Harry exclaimed. He sat on the other side of the sofa, his legs stretched out over the space that Malfoy refused to occupy.
For the first time, Draco didn’t find himself wishing to be another person. In fact, he realized he wanted the very opposite. He wouldn’t mind losing his last name and everything that being a Malfoy meant, but he very much wanted to be Draco. Just Draco, and all of the parts of himself he never got to explore before. To not have to analyze every decision he made. And maybe, just maybe, if he didn’t think too hard, he’d allow his stranger to kiss him.
The man straightened. His eyes flickered up and down Harry’s form – who was trying very hard to look past him. He folded the newspaper in his hand and stuffed it under his armpit. “I’ll wait for the next one, thank you.”
“I’ve had to call you into my office for a lot things, Potter,” Robards said, making his way to behind his desk, “but never, in a million years, did I think this,” he threw a copy of the Daily Prophet down, “would be one of them.”
Harry spun around. A fearsome glare in his eyes. Draco returned it easily. Harry was the one person he’d never be scared of, he knew what it felt like to be under his glares, and he wasn’t about to back down from it now.
“He ridicules you in front of other people every chance he gets!”
Malfoy’s eyes shot open, searching wildly for the boy who was standing right in front of him, still stroking his arm.
Ron looked ready to pop. He was so done with being gentle. Hermione kept telling him that they needed to let him figure it out for himself, but this wasn't a homework assignment or a puzzle, it was his life, and he was wasting it away on work and liquor. Ron couldn't watch his friend like this anymore. It was bad enough having to go home to see George's forced smiles or Ginny's empty room as she refuses to visit for anything but holidays anymore, too concentrated on her Quidditch career.
“I have my own money.”
“I never lied to you,” Harry snapped. His shoulders fell. “I just…didn’t tell you the whole truth.”
“What’s your motive?”
Harry nodded. "Yeah, definitely. Maybe, er, just give me a few days' notice, yeah? I should get going before the Floo queue gets too long. Tell 'Mione I said hi."
Harry attempted to tell him to go away again, but only a strangled whimper escaped.
The following words were almost impossible for Draco to hear because his blood was pounding so loud in his ears.
“Oh, and Potter?” Harry looked back over his shoulder, halfway out already. “I expected an invite to the wedding.”
“So why was Malfoy in our room last night?”
Robards attempted to hold back a smile, but Harry could see the amusement glittering in his eyes. He muttered something about challenging him and Ron more before telling Harry they could go home early.
...But he wasn't as happy as he had hoped he would be.
“It's not that weird to know about his favorite foods! Everyone knows that he likes granny smith apples!” Harry cried.
The two sat in the dining room along with Draco's father, who was presently reading the Daily Prophet. There was a sundry of different foods displayed on the long ebony table before them. Draco took a piece of toast and proceeded to spread jam on it. He looked up at his mother and shrugged. "I guess," the boy answered, his voice nonchalant. Narcissa knew better. She raised her eyebrows at him in disbelief as he continued to take a bite of his toast.
In hindsight, Draco probably should have ate dinner before he decided to drop everything and run. If he knew that his stomach would be growling throughout his entire journey from Wiltshire to Muggle London, Draco would've shoved a whole baguette down his throat before heading out. The fifteen-year-old had been walking for almost twelve hours straight with no food in his stomach, a bag full of bare necessities on his back, and a one-year-old child in his arms.
Hermione nodded slowly, “Yeah… I think so.”
"Hello, cousin. My sister and I are seeking refuge from the Dark Lord. Would you put your wand down and let us in?"
The average boy shook his head, "No."
That statement caused Draco to snort. "Hardly!" Draco shook his head before continuing, "You two are overreacting. Its not like I'm leaving to Hogwarts today. We're just going shopping." (For a wand. Shopping for a wand. Draco is getting a wand today).
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line. She put on the hat and sat down quickly. There was a moment of silence, and then-- "HUFFLEPUFF!" the hat shouted. The table on the right cheered and clapped as the girl went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.
Hermione's eyes went wide in bewilderment. "
"Uh... yeah," Draco nodded again before changing the topic. "My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands," Draco said, trying to sound calm although he was the exact opposite. "Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow."
Draco couldn't take it anymore. "Yes?" Draco asked, attempting to hold back a sneer. Trelawney blinked a few times before responding.
BUT here's the next chapter. From now on expect one chapter a month unless I somehow manage to pull my lazy ass to write two lol.
“I don't find that git attractive!”
"That brooding face," the boy clarified, "Its annoying me. Stop it."
The hallway was narrow, Draco noted as he squeezed his way through the crowd. Draco was currently on the train trying to navigate his way through (which he found quite hard since what seemed to be London's entire juvenile population was in the train with him). By his side were his massive, leather trunk and his eagle owl, Vyronas-- both charmed by his father to be lighter.
Draco pondered over the question for a moment.
Draco translated in his head. The witch looked at Draco with a frown and continued, "I'm sorry, dear. A child your age shouldn't be under Veritaserum... it's not right-"
Draco thought to himself as he watched Estella chew messily on a banana chunk, spit escaping her mouth and falling onto her chin.
Hermione smiled at the three boys, revealing her rather large front teeth, "Neville and I have to leave but if you find a lone toad, please return it to us."
(See the end of the chapter for
"The-Boy-Who-Lived is on this train, yes," Daphne snapped back, interrupting Draco's thoughts. "I heard that he's sitting near the end of the train."
Trelawney paused at Draco's statement and glanced around the room. "That we are, Draco."
"We are asking the questions here, boy!" Moody screeched. Draco rolled his eyes at the angry man and thought back to what McGonagall said about the note.
“Can you tell us who's baby that is?”
to worry about!"
The somewhat corpulent boy, who was sitting next to Draco, scratched his head in confusion. His eyebrows furrowed as he asked, "But didn't your stepdads die...? So can't she still love them...?" Pansy, Blaise, and Draco all burst out laughing while Theodore smiled. Both the chubby boy and the brunette boy next to him had looks of confusion on their faces.
Narcissa nodded in agreement, sinking her finger's into Draco's pale hair, stroking the soft strands. There was a moment of silence. Draco's mother stared at him longingly while Lucius just looked at him with no emotion showing on his pale face. Narcissa gave her son a small, sad smile, "I'll miss you, dear."
"As much as I
in here? Malfoy is basically a Death Eater in training!”
“They might've not known about the baby,” Ron said. “Maybe the mother of the baby just dropped the kid off on the Manor's doorstep a few days ago.”
Uncomfortable didn't even begin to describe how out of sorts Draco felt with his estranged cousin glowering at him from across the table. After the chaos that ensued earlier, Black and the mother Weasley sent Draco's school mates upstairs and forced Draco to give Black his wand and sit alone in the dining room. Well, Draco was alone at first; for a few minutes, Draco sat silently in the dining room whilst Black was off doing who know's what (Draco realizes later that the man was probably calling backup). Eventually, Black entered the room and sat across from Draco with an angry glint in his eye. While the two pureblooded men sat awkwardly at the dining room table, the Weasley matriarch paced in the kitchen, calmly rocking a still agitated Estella in her arms.
Draco glanced at the stool before grimacing. "Couldn't they have brought a more decent-looking hat?" On top of the stool sat a shabby pointed wizard's hat. The hat was pitiful; it was patched, frayed, and coated in grime. The hat would have been set aflame before it even entered Wiltshire, let alone the Malfoy Manor.
Everyone was silent. Draco could only hear his own rapid heart beat and his (somewhat) controlled breathing.
Draco winced as he heard the screams of his surname. Instead of looking up to see who said his name, the Slytherin quickly glanced down at the toddler in his arm to see her face flushed and scrunched up. She was going to have a fit and Draco knew it was going to be bad.
"I thought fancy purebloods were supposed to keep it in their pants before marriage, Forge!" - George
Vincent and Gregory shook their heads while Draco raised his eyebrows, "...No. We haven't seen any toads."
"No."
Draco stared at the floor for the remainder of his time in Madam Malkin's shop. He knew that he was nervous for school but this was ridiculous! Draco let out a huff, stepping down from the footstool after the second witch told him he was done.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait,” Ginny said with a raised brow. “Are you implying that the baby
"I have my ways," Daphne said, smug. Pansy smiled at her before turning back to her male friends.
Hermione shrugged with a smile on her face, "I'm just joking, Harry. And besides, I'm allowed to call myself that. It's slur against me, so I'll use the word as I please!"
“Stuck-up?”
“Merlin, there it is.”
For those who aren't familiar with Veritaserum, let me explain why Draco, who has a natural inclination towards Occlumency (even though at this time in the fanfic, he isn't fully trained) was unable to resist it. In the books, they say that when people aren't aware they're under Veritaserum, the potion works better. So, Draco was eventually able to stop himself from talking but at first he couldn't because he didn't know he took Veritaserum. Draco's natural skill in Occlumency becomes a plot point later so I just wanted to explain this scene just in case in the future, people see Draco's Occlumency skills as inconsistent because of this scene.
Draco reached into the bag and tried to find the little food he did pack. "Merlin, where is it?" Draco let out a huff of frustration and continued to push the contents of the bag around in search for food.
is he doing here? How did he even find this place?”
if you like kpop or any anime or anything like that!!! follow me on twitter!
"May I see this note?"
Also, for my fellow book readers, I'm planning on having a full redemption arc for Draco. I'm kind of sick and tired of reading fics that blatantly ignore the fact that Draco was a bigoted bully in his youth. Yes, his rude nature can be explained by his upbringing but it's not excusable and I don't want to just gloss over it. It is canon that Draco changes his ways and opinions and in this fic, I want to reflect that! Molly Weasley, Hermione, Lupin, and the Tonk family are going to play huge roles in his redemption so stay tuned!
Draco inhaled sharply at that, "You can communicate using the ball."
I'm gonna try posting at least once a week but sometimes I might just delete shit or get busy so some updates will be delayed, unfortunately.
“I agree,” Hermione said. This caused an uproar from Ron and Harry.
The big girl glowered at him immediately and took a large step towards Draco, her face red in fury. Draco felt himself involuntarily shudder in fear as the girl towered over him. Draco attempted to keep a stoic expression on his face but his wide eyes betrayed him. "Who are you calling a cow, you prissy pixie?"
Draco rolled his eyes at the yells emitting from two floors below him. The plus-side of staying on the fourth floor was not being near the loud Gryffindors; however, the fourth floor also involved dozens of stairs to climb, and the sleep-deprived aristocrat was not happy about the hike. “You're so lucky you're small, Estella,” Draco murmured to the baby in his arms. “You get to be carried around everywhere, meanwhile I have to walk up these stairs.”
“So… Malfoy!” Fred started, causing Remus to let out a groan.
"I'm not a little-"
There was a silence. The towheaded teen glanced up to see Molly Weasley adorning a guilty look on her face. Draco slowly looked down at the glass of water in front of him with a look of realization on his face.
“So,” Ginny started, drumming her fingers on the dining room table, “what is the protocol? Do we just act normal?”
"He thought about her smile. He thought about her thin hair. He thought about the reeking smell of death that exuded from her." -when it goes from 0 to 100 real quick lmaoo.
"-with a strong inner eye would stumble upon me in the year 1991, yearning for my assistance-"
"Since you asked..." the brunette let out a dramatic sigh before continuing, "I heard that we have a celebrity on the train."
"Is that a baby?" - Ginny
"Draco, go in there and request for her to fit you into your uniform," she demanded. She looked past Draco and Lucius before turning back to them. "I shall be in Ollivanders for the time being."
Pansy opened the compartment door and stepped inside. Draco felt himself smile as he also stepped inside with alacrity. Inside the compartment sat four young boys whom Draco recognized immediately.
Lucius smirked before responding, "Right. Well, hurry along in there, Draco," he all but pushed the eleven-year old towards the robe shop and then proceeded to stroll into Flourish and Blotts next door. Draco rolled his eyes and opened the door to the shop.
Everyone burst out laughing while the tan girl, Michael Corner, and Draco all rolled their eyes. "No," the knocker grumbled, "The answer is not feces. Somebody else must try now." Anthony frowned while the other first-years thought of the answer.
"Okay! It's just-" Harry stopped himself again and bit his lip in embarrassment. "Malfoy's mother said that Malfoy told her that he left because some Death Eaters were... harassing him."
"Forgot? Are you- Seriously Pansy?" the short girl, Daphne, looked appalled. She had thick, light brown hair that went down to her chest. She was short and thin and... Draco had no idea who she was. Draco had no idea who either of the girls were, actually-- not Daphne nor the girl next to Daphne (Millie? Who in the world-?). The girl next to Daphne was
Draco huffed before snapping back, "I don't think you should be talking about
Draco thought,
“I'm gonna vomit,” Ron cried while the twins cackled.
"Wiltshire?!" The woman exasperated, her brown eyes wide in shock. "You're telling me that you and the little one walked all this way from Wiltshire?" Draco nodded in response and the muggle woman frowned. "It might be too personal to ask but are you two running away from a dangerous situation? If so, I can contact the police-"
"Are you just reading the shopping list?" Lucius asked with a teasing tone hidden in his question. Narcissa glared at her husband while Draco snickered. Lucius let out a deep sigh. "I still think he should go to Durmstrang. Hogwarts has decreased in quality over the years. Has gone from the 'Wizarding School of Magic' to the 'Wizarding School of Coddling Mudbloods'-- I tell you."
I really don't think anybody cares for my reasons for being late BUT if you rly want to know ;)))))
"His kind of pureblood do the nasty with their own relatives, Gred. It must be his mother's-" - Fred
Draco hesitantly took the bottle from the woman's hand. "Thank you, miss. You're too kind."
"Already?" Theo questioned with an incredulous look on his face. "What gossip could you possibly be discussing? School hasn't even started yet."
Sirius Black, Draco would've called bullshit. But alas, here he was on the front doorstep of 12 Grimmauld Place with half of a banana in his stomach, a bag full of bare necessities (plus a dragon plushie) on his back, a one-year-old child in his arms, and a crazy git pointing a wand at him.
If somebody told Draco a day ago that trusting Snape would lead him to getting his life hexed out of him by
"WHY IS MALFOY HERE?!"
“No.”
Draco did what his mother told him and requested to be fitted. Before he knew it, Draco was standing on a footstool with a loose black robe hanging off his thin frame. The blond boy let his mind roam elsewhere-- to an extent, that is. Draco tried not to think of the dream he had but the more he tried the more he thought about it. The towheaded boy rolled his eyes and looked over at the front window, trying to make himself focus on anything but his dream. That's when he heard Madam Malkin's voice.
BTW my version of Draco is still gonna be smug and rude but he's gonna be pretty introverted because of all of the visions he has... not that he wants to be but because everyone thinks he's really weird RIP so they avoid him.
"Yes. I-I don't know why my brain came up with something so horrid! Especially with someone random like Malfoy! I don't know why I dreamt of him at all!" Harry exclaimed in confusion. Hermione bit her bottom lip and gave Harry a sympathetic look. Harry saw the look on Hermione's face and groaned, "Oh bollocks! Not this again!"
"Here we are!" she squealed.
"I think it is, little sister! Ickle Malfoy is a teen dad!"
“Change it.”
The average boy frowned slightly at that. Draco assumed it was because he was also upset about first years not being allowed their own brooms and carried on, "Have you got your own broom?" Draco asked.
“You were born a Death Eater,” Black said with an odd look in his eye. He wasn't angry, however. It was almost as if he was sad. Draco frowned and looked up at Black, “whether you like it or not, you will always be a Death Eater regardless of whether you have the mark. Malfoy Senior made sure of that.”
want to become a Death Eater. While the young aristocrat agreed with the bases of the ideology (purebloods being superior to mudbloods, muggles being a threat to wizarding society, etcetera), he did not agree with the execution— literally... they literally execute people. Murder, torture, and rape were things that Draco, like any normal functioning human being, looked down upon. Unfortunately, his father, his aunt Bellatrix, and his uncle Rodolphus did not share similar sentiments. Draco shivered as he thought about the screams he heard from the Manor's dungeons just a few days ago.
understand why she did it... even though he wasn't exactly happy that it happened to him. If he was in the Weasley woman's shoes, he would've done the same thing; if (Merlin forbid) Ron Weasley showed up to the Manor with a babe in his arms, he would want to slip the weasel some Veritaserum too.
"What in the seven hells is going on out here?" An older woman exclaimed. Draco looked up to see the Weasley matriarch alongside all of her children that currently went to Hogwarts, Granger, Potter, and Black all staring at him with looks of shock and confusion. The elder woman regained her composure quickly once she saw the toddler crying in Draco's arms. "Oh dear!" the woman cried out before shoving her way past the teenagers to stand next to Black. "Sirius, put your wand down! And all of you stop gawking! Can't you see that you're stressing the poor babe out?" Black begrudgingly put his wand down as the mother Weasley walked over to Draco and held out her arms. "I can take care of the little angel, love. I have quite the experience in this area!" Draco hesitated for a moment handing Estella over. "There! I'll calm the babe down while you head inside. You look exhausted!"
"Why are you blushing? Tell me."
"Who's talking about butts?" Harry and Hermione turned their heads towards the door to see Ron and Ginny Weasley standing in the entranceway of the door. Ginny rolled her eyes at her brother's comment before walking into the room and plopping herself down on the rear end of the bed.
To say Draco was startled would be an understatement. The aristocrat jumped before whipping around in shock only to find Trelawney staring at him with her unsettling bug eyes. "H-hello Professor-"
Draco swallowed the last piece of his Cauldron Cake before turning towards Gregory and Vincent. "Greg, Vince, lets go meet Harry Potter," the blond stood up and slid open their compartment door. Draco stopped before leaving and looked over at the two boys. "Well? Are you coming?"
"What the bloody hell is an 'emo'?"
Harry rolled his eyes but the smile never left his face. “Draco Malfoy…” Draco’s grin widened and he couldn’t stop himself from giving a small hum, making Harry appear even more exasperated. “…will you be my boyfriend?”
“And how is that far?” Malfoy snapped. “You’ve seen me blubbering like an idiot because I don’t want to leave the house. We’re friends, aren’t we? What kind of friend would I be if I only accepted help and didn’t give any?”
Harry crossed his arms, his eyebrows raising. “Oh yeah?”
Harry nodded, making the pair sit up. “Two were taken near the apartment which means whoever it was knows where we live. I trust everyone who knows except for one person: Terry Skeres.”
"What's that?" Malfoy asked when they reached the ground floor. He gestured to the drape, which hung over the portrait of Sirius' mother.
Two loud thuds on his door yanked him from his thoughts and made him jump several centimeters in the air. He stared at the door with wide eyes. For one wild moment, he thought he’d hear Harry’s voice on the other side of the door. However, a different voice rang out. “Malfoy? Open up. I need to talk to you.”
Neville turned back. “Who else is going to grow you fifty lily and narcissus center pieces in a week?”
Panic spread across Draco's face. "No, you don't!"
“Oh.” A pang of guilt surfaced in Malfoy’s chest. Dobby had been his house-elf. He should be the one to remember the date of his death. He never liked getting close to the elves though, it made it too hard to watch his father push them around.
“I don’t know but everyone is going to see it tomorrow and we can’t hide from it.”
Harry shrugged. “Everyone at the party.”
It was a routine call. There were always skirmishes in Knockturn especially with school nearing. Not only was the two man patrol stuck in Diagon dealing with controlling the masses, but kids liked to use the time to their advantage to sneak away. Several usually got spouts bravery before they were sent packing back to Hogwarts and would venture down the dark alley as a last hurrah. It wasn’t rare to end in a visit to Saint Mungo’s but that didn’t stop them.
A firm crease was situated on Malfoy's brow as he stared at Harry, still unsure if he was completely all right. "I think I figured that out. Are you sure that you're okay?"
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “Alone?”
Harry’s smile faltered. He tore his eyes from Draco to look back at the cake. “Yeah,” he straightened one of the sinking candles, “I do.”
Harry nodded.
More than once, he had looked up at the clock and realized that hours had passed without him noticing, or he found himself wandering around his house without really knowing why. However, Harry was usually around for when that happened now, and he always tried to keep Draco somewhat present so he couldn't dissociate completely. Draco knew his favorite way of staying grounded.
To be perfectly honest, I had no idea how I was going to end this story. I typically write a lot of angst so this was mostly just a fluffy piece but I hope it was enjoyable. I may come back and do an epilogue but my niece was just born and I'll be busy helping out for a bit. Thanks for reading!
Ron started to smile as if it was a joke then stopped when Harry looked to his things again like the conversation was over. He was serious. He was actually going to consider something before agreeing to it. “Oh, okay then. Let me know.”
They made it up the stairs and out of sight. It was a little tricky getting to their room, Harry’s heart hammering and yearning for him to spin around and kiss Draco again. However, he managed to get through the door and close it.
George gave him an incredulous look. “It’s Ginny. You know how self-righteous she can be, especially when she’s actually right. However,” he gestured to the overflowing rubbish bin in the corner which had Harry and Draco’s picture peeking out of the top, “I have a feeling all the stuff they said in there isn’t right.”
He first met Harry’s open eyes and then glanced once at the sleeping body in what was meant to be his bed. “Sorry,” he spoke as if he’d interrupted something other than Draco’s sleep. His eyes were blearily beginning to open, blinking several times at Ron. “I, er, didn’t have a clean shirt.”
“A selfish one,” Malfoy corrected. “And I’ve been selfish enough. Let me help you.”
The part which stood out the most to him was that they were watching. They knew what he’d done even if they didn’t know they had an effect on it happening. Like a pet being rewarded with a treat, he felt a jolt of elation at the idea. He bit his lip and picked up his pen.
She opened her mouth but paused with palpable hesitation. She pressed her lips back into a straight line, her brow creased as she looked Harry up and down. Finally, she spoke again, “Feel free to visit whenever. Teddy misses you.”
Ron sat up. “Are you?” he urged. “That would explain why you’re never around anymore. Who is it?”
“Good morning, Potter!” Auror Nettle exclaimed loudly.
Draco rolled his eyes with such exaggeration it was a shock that they didn’t roll out of his head. He took one hand back to rake through his hair, as if silently saying, “But I’m still pretty.” At least, that’s what Harry certainly thought as he watched the delicate white strands feather down into a soft wave.
Harry sighed, dropping his arms. “No, I’m sorry. You’re right.” The Weasley children shared looks in the kitchen. “Well, are you coming or not?”
They sat in silence for only a few seconds before Malfoy began to attempt the chopsticks again. After a few tries, he managed to clumsily get the food to his mouth. It was enough to get him excited. Harry clapped and cheered him on, seeing how utterly delighted with himself Malfoy actually was.
He pulled away with a loud groan. “I have to go to work.” He forced his body still and dropped his head into the pillow beside Draco’s head.
“You too.”
“Alone?” Draco frowned. “He told me he would get back up.”
“You know there are other competent Aurors, right? Including myself, might I add.” He shoved his hands into his pockets. “I was just about to go visit Skeres after hours.”
Sow rolled her eyes. “I said you’ll live, not that you’ll be going back to work anytime soon.”
It was a nice apartment. Harry hadn't really looked at it before. The kitchen, which took up the most room with counter space and a breakfast bar, looked into the living room and small dinette. The three rooms made up most of the apartment, aside from the bedroom. It was just enough space for one person to maintain, and Malfoy indeed maintained it.
Draco slid him a shrewd look. “Since when is Weasley a reliable source?”
Harry put on a cool glare. “Bugger off, Malfoy.”
There was an abrupt pop from the living area.
His conversation with Ron ran through Harry’s head for the rest of the day. It lent to the continued hush of the flat when he got home. Draco was still not talking very much although they kept an easy conversation during dinner about what they’d each gotten up to during the day.
Ron invited Harry to go with him to visit Hermione, an offer Harry would usually take, but then he remembered the girl Ron had mentioned earlier. In a quick decision, he declined, claiming he had to do some errands.
“Ah, there he is,” Ron greeted heartily.
“I’ve wanted revenge for what they did for years but Malfoy Manor is impossible to get into if you aren’t invited.  Then I got this job and months later,” a wicked smile twisted his lips, “I found his address. Before I even thought about doing anything with it, I heard Skeres talking about him. He was so angry.” He let out a breathy laugh and Harry barely managed to not curse him right there. “I knew he’d get my revenge for me.”
Harry stepped out of the fireplace and held out his gift. “What about Teddy?”
The following days, Malfoy refused to even acknowledge Harry’s existence. It wasn’t a very hard thing to do, at least. It wasn’t as if they had the same friend group. Or, rather, it wasn’t as if Malfoy had any friends at all.
“He wouldn’t.”
“No but in this job you get to know everyone even if they don’t know you.”
His words only served to infuriate Ron more because of how mature he sounded. Ron couldn’t remember the last time Harry had chosen to actually talk something out the moment that it became an issue. It was so unlike him, and Ron just couldn’t face the reason why he was suddenly growing more mature.
Harry had always been agile. A lifetime of running—from Dudley or a psychopath—had trained him well. However, Malfoy had the privilege of long legs and kept close to his heels.
Andromeda looked at Harry. “How about you?”
Harry glimpsed Draco’s falling gaze. Did he expect Harry to lie? There wasn’t a point anymore; Ron and Hermione knew they were friends. He wasn’t ashamed. “Tell them the truth.” Kreacher perked up a little. “Quickly, we’re having dinner here tonight.”
Malfoy froze at the sound before slowly turning back. For a second, he doubted he’d even heard anything. Harry looked too far into sleep, already to coherently form words.
“Don’t compare me to those muggle butchers,” the woman remarked, “it’s Healer Sow, and yes, you’ll be fine. However, I want to keep you here overnight for observation. It’s just a precaution.”
“Draco didn’t kill Crabbe,” Harry snapped. “He killed himself with that
“What’s going on?” the woman demanded.
Draco scoffed. If there was one spell he was most proficient at it was the shield charm, it was almost muscle memory now. “I’m personally not so scared of that happening to me, but I think Abbot might have a complaint when you accidently hit her.”
Hermione put her nose up in the air. “That matters on what Malfoy thinks of Metanumerical Theory.”
Ron became silent. It had been a cruel revelation during the trials. Voldemort had devised a way for Draco to actively bring about his own death, and he had to play along, or his family would die in his place. That information was what got the jury on his side.
Harry’s eyes snapped to his. He frowned. He could tell Robards wasn’t talking Ron, his work partner. “What do mean by my partner’s safety?”
Harry could feel Lucius’s glare up until he started snapping at the patrolmen to not touch him. His voice became muffled when the office door swung shut behind them.
The man frowned, apparently offended. He answered nonetheless. “Well, yes, in theory. No one really pays attention to us, like house-elves really. Some of this stuff is too complex for those little guys though.” He gestured to the shelves of cleaning supplies.
They somehow ended up watching the rest of the program. Harry shifted a little uncomfortably when he realized halfway through that two of the characters were gay men. He looked over at Malfoy curiously. Either this didn't bother Malfoy, or he hadn't figured it out yet.
Ron narrowed his eyes. Harry cringed. While Expelliarmus was a useful spell in a duel, it was also a well-known fact that it was the first spell that usually came to Harry's mind. He was so notorious for it among the Aurors that it was often the punchline to any ridicule directed at him. If he was going to lie on the spot, then that was the spell he would say.
“We heard the good news,” Hermione’s voice entered the room before she did. She appeared a moment after. To Harry’s surprise, Ron was in tow and was attempting to put on his best front. Hermione must have really ripped into him the night before. Thankfully, Harry was alone at the moment.
Harry gave a breathy chuckle and a small nod but not one that made it clear he particularly agreed. It wasn't that he didn't find her attractive. Of course, he did. But, he found little other interest in her besides her looks ― a hard realization for him to come to at fifteen. "She cried a lot, that's for sure," he mumbled.
Harry licked his drying lips. “Goodnight.”
His twisted expression morphed into something else. It was a different kind of fear, not for himself but for someone else. “What’s happened to Harry?”
Harry looked over his shoulder to see that Draco had, in fact, turned over to face him. “Hm?” he mumbled, turning over as well.
by Harry Styles
Harry hummed, still attempting to make Malfoy squirm. “Then I guess you don’t know me very well.” He stood straight and started over to the small kitchenette behind Malfoy’s couch which was mostly only stocked with various tea tins and the rogue coffee can which was hardly touched.
Harry shook his head vigorously. His body was moving before he could give it reason, instinct telling him to get close so Draco would soften like he always did. Draco was already a step ahead. He jumped off the bed before Harry could touch him.
Flirting didn’t say enough. Either of the twins could have given him as many cheeky winks as they wanted in the past; he was never under the impression they were into him like that. Besides, most of his flirting with Malfoy had been one-sided anyway.
Harry smacked him again.
"It looks like the git might have been telling the truth," said Ron, returning from his interrogation with Skeres. "The last spell on Terry's wand was the killing curse."
Harry couldn’t help but go on, “Like a peacock, just as pretentious, too.”
However, Harry didn’t realize that
He’d never really considered being a father. He took to his responsibilities with Teddy naturally but he never considered that parenting. He could always hand him back to Andromeda whenever he wanted. He wasn’t sure if he’d even be good at it. It wasn’t as if he had any good examples. He didn’t consider Vernon Dursley a good example for a second. Faces like Dumbledore, Arthur, and Hagrid popped into his head but none sat quite right. Sirius was the closest he’d ever gotten to a father but that had been fleeting.
Teddy ran up to grab Harry’s sleeve. “But I just got here,” he whimpered. “You can’t go yet!”
“Since when did you become Moaning Myrtle?”
“Shut up, Weasel.”
No, his only real education of homosexuality was walking past this club every night. He was careful not to appear outright curious. He'd made a complete, stuttering fool of himself when one of the patrons had caught him staring and invited Harry to join him inside. After that, he made sure to make his glances fleeting and pondering as inconspicuous as possible.
“He is my
The whiskey bottle came near, and Harry knocked back a shot, relishing in the liquid burn sliding down his throat. He handed it off to the next interested person—Hermione sitting back, out of the way—and returned his eyes to the Slytherin.
“McGonagall’s offered me a job,” it came out in a rush.
“No more than London, and the weather is lovely. The summer especially, not a cloud in the sky, cool nights and just the right amount of heat in the day.” Seeing that the weather conditions weren’t going to persuade Draco anytime soon, she quickly changed tact. “Lorena has plenty of room. She keeps asking about you. She says she rather have you live with us than have to constantly listen to me worry.”
Seeing Draco’s uneasiness, Harry was about to suggest inquiring about how long a port key would take to be made when Draco finally squeezed his hand and took the plunge.
In all honesty, he had considered skipping a night, just to give them a break from one another. That was the real reason he had dressed in muggle clothes; he had been halfway to his usual pub when he turned on his heel and went back the other way. He couldn't tell Malfoy that, though. He didn't want to worry him.
If one only looked at his face, he or she would assume that Harry was ignoring Draco. He kept the conversation going with Hermione without pause. However, in the corner of his eye, Harry was extremely aware of Draco’s hypervigilance.
“Do I?”
Bill nodded, pointing at the door, as he followed Andromeda up the stairs. “Yeah, she’s outside with Fleur.” Teddy was no longer the only baby of the family after last year when Bill and Fleur gave birth to a daughter on the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts of all days.
A beat of heavy silence coated the room. Even George and Angelina had paused in the other room out of sight.
Harry yanked the pillow away just so Draco could see his glare - or rather his pout. Draco wasn’t affected. He continued to grin madly even as he reached up to run his fingers through Harry’s hair. “I love you,” he hummed.
Malfoy sighed, brushing his fingers over the spot where his aunt’s picture had once been. “My mother’s family wasn’t so happy about it either. She’s been trying to mend their relationship for some time. Andromeda is the only family she has left now ― besides me.”
Professors were hurrying to stuff as much information into their brains before they all left and let their thoughts turn to pudding. Flitwick was the guiltiest of this, insisting that they were very behind on theory and giving a weekly essay assignment.
“Shush!” Madam Pince snapped.
"Does stuff like this happen often?"
Harry’s brief feeling of vindication disappeared as he frowned at the man in his arms. “I don’t care.” Draco scoffed again but Harry quickly spoke over him. “I know you think I’m a people pleaser, and at times maybe you are right. Growing up it was easier to just do as expected but when it comes to stuff that really matters,” he gave Draco’s shoulders a little squeeze, “then I don’t care what people think. I care about what’s right and being with you,” he lifted his Draco’s chin, finally pulling his gaze to meet his eyes once more, “is right.”
Draco frowned, his hand moving slowly from his face. "Are you saying there are no baby pictures of you?"
There was a small gasp to his left then a rushed, horribly muffled, “It’s Harry Potter!”
“Harry?”
,” she hissed.
“Goodnight.”
Parvati lifted a brow, glancing once at Malfoy then back at Harry. She was trying very hard not to smile. “And what is his type then?”
“Goodnight, Harry.” She gave the healer a pleasant smile. “Have a good evening, Healer Sow.” The healer returned the regard just as politely. Hermione’s eyes moved to Draco next.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Don’t be such a drama queen. You look good anyway. Sort of casually handsome.”
A bitter, breathy laugh jumped out of his mouth. “I’m a Malfoy.” He spoke his own name with such disdain that not even Harry’s younger self could have competed.
“So now I’m not allowed to accept you?”
arrogant.”
Draco’s last response hadn’t been much. It was mostly his usual commentary on what his stranger had said. He could barely even recall it himself, his head had been reeling the moment he read their last letter, and he was only just beginning to recover when he was hit in the face once again.
Harry reached forward, and Malfoy flinched away. Harry instantly stopped, beginning to pull back. “Wait,” Draco whimpered. His eyes were looking down at the hand Harry had just offered.
There didn’t seem to be a reason for Harry’s heart to jolt at such a thing, but it did. It began to pick up speed, even more, when he met Malfoy’s cool, unaffected gaze. If anyone else had asked, Harry likely would have obliged instantly. However, wrestling and hair mussing aside, he typically didn’t make a habit of touching his previous nemesis. That seemed like such a silly word now.
He tried to shake away the thoughts, but his eyes found the statue again. It was a much larger version of Dobby, but he could picture it swaying. Stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. He and the elf looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf’s heaving chest.
“Damn, I’m sorry, mate,” said Dean.
"He was exonerated!" Harry snapped without thought ― a running theme with him that day.
Harry snaked his arms around his waist, pulling their bodies flush against each other. “Then I’ll keep saying it: I love you.”
Hermione had never seen the Malfoy boy look so vulnerable. Whatever this was between them was bringing out things in both men that no one had ever seen in either of them before. It was hard to tell if it was good.
“Yeah, mate, where’ve you been?” asked Ron. “The party started at one.”
He had gotten halfway through the second victim's file when the door opened. For a moment, Draco completely forgot that he wasn't supposed to be snooping, too engrossed in his reading. He barely considered Harry's presence behind the counters as he put the food down. It's only when Harry bellowed at him that he realizes his mistake. "What are you doing?"
Maybe Harry did want to touch his hair again. It had been incredibly soft. It was nothing like the slicked-up style he had worn through most of their time in school. He supposed grooming one’s self became less of a concern when Voldemort was living in your house. Who cared how you looked if everyone around you had a high chance of dying any second? Then again, he still seemed considerably concerned with his appearance. At least the war hadn’t changed everything about him.
“Harry!” Hermione croaked.
“As long as you don’t attempt to find it,” Malfoy said offhandedly, his chortles dying out. “You and your little crew do always appear uncomfortable without a quest in sight.”
Skeres never showed up as far as Harry knew. He waited up until about one in the morning, finding himself dozing off on the bench and knowing he wouldn't be much of a lookout if he was asleep. With tired reluctance, he went back to Grimmauld to sleep but made sure to do a double-check of the street before he did.
Draco’s face was still scrunched up. His eyes flashed between Harry’s face and the hand he had dropped on the mattress to rest between them. “I don’t understand why you keep trying so hard? No one else will accept me, and you keep… I don’t get it.”
for standing up for him against Umbridge and believing he was capable of being an Auror.
“Oh, yes, my bad,” he spoke with a snide hiss. “I didn’t notice that.”
Out of habit, he pushed his hands through the pockets of his robes before tossing them in the hamper, making sure he hadn't accidentally brought home another cursed bracelet he'd forgotten to give to evidence. The only thing that came up was a scrap of paper. He nearly threw it away without a second thought but paused when the numbers caught his attention, it was Draco's address. He should probably keep it in case he had any follow up questions.
He had no such luck.
Draco scrambled out of bed. Only once he was on his feet did he look to Harry to check if he was still asleep. To his great relief, it appeared he hadn’t been disturbed in Draco’s haste.
He didn’t know what Draco would do if Harry crossed that line first. Would he be scared away? Or would he be too scared to leave, thinking that this was all Harry wanted from him?
Sometimes walking around could help. Even as the memory of the dream faded, the tension around his heart told him this had been a particularly nasty one. He wouldn’t be able to lie down for a while.
If anyone didn’t belong back at Hogwarts, it was the golden trio. At the very least, Granger acted like there was something left for her to learn, even if she did figure everything out in half the time everyone else did. Meanwhile, Potter and Weasley were happy to mill about and act as though school was their vacation time. To some degree, it probably was.
That mentally you were already out the door..."
Harry was wholly entertained. He had never seen a pair of friends interact quite like this before. The closest was the bickering of the Weasley siblings; however, there was a certain venomousness to this pair that was far more interesting.
Draco scoffed, finally sitting down into the chair. “Please, you all could find trouble easily enough with me involved. I certainly didn’t cause you to drive that car into the Whomping Willow.”
She straightened instantly. “Wait, really?”
The door burst open and Ron’s voice entered before he did. “There’s the birthday boy!” He was accompanied by Charlie. Their loud entrance stirred some others from the sitting room. George and Angelina popped into view. “And see, I told you,” Ron elbowed Charlie, “there was no way Malfoy would actually show up here.”
Robards slanted a look up the man. “You know him better than most. You really think that’ll be enough?”
All Harry could see was his own outstretched hand before the door snapped closed. He was alone once again.
“There was one thing he said that bothers me, though,” Harry eventually spoke up. He didn’t move his eyes from their hands, but he could feel Draco looking at him. Maybe it was the natural human sense, or perhaps it was the fact that his hand clamped up. As uncomfortable as this might have made Draco, Harry knew he couldn’t put the lid back on. “Last year…were you…” Harry bit his lip, momentarily wondering if there was a way he could suddenly change courses. There didn’t seem to be one. “Were you waiting for me to come and get you?”
Maybe his brain still hadn’t caught up after his panic attack. Or perhaps he hadn’t been completely done with that hug earlier. Either way, he stuffed his hands into his pockets to occupy them and started down the stairs.
Harry huffed and looked away. “That’s progress, I suppose.”
One particularly sunny day that had an usually blue sky, he had stopped to ask this.
“Will I get to see your room?”
"After yesterday, I didn't think you were coming anymore."
Draco let out a harsh scoff. "I was always afraid to be myself." Harry frowned. Draco raked a hand through his hair. "Do you remember that crane I sent you," his brow was furrowed, and there was a firm frown on his lips, but his face was still red, "and the drawing inside?"
“Granger? Weasley?” They all looked up to see Draco descending the last few steps into the kitchen. “I heard voices, I thought…”
“Dray...”
Harry crossed his arms over his chest. While he was relieved to hear this, it didn’t seem like a ridiculous thing to be afraid of. “Really? Because you didn’t seem so happy when he came to the hospital.”
Hermione opened her mouth but it was Ron spoke. “Draco didn’t kill anyone.”
“Okay, I’ll pack.” Draco pulled out his wand and flicked it at the books. They began to put themselves away in no particular order as Draco began folding the blanket on the back of the sofa. “You can go back to work for now. We’ll move when you’re done.”
A crease formed on his brow. “Don’t do that.”
He would rather stare at Harry than have a proper conversation.
He started to turn back towards the flat but Hermione didn’t leave. “Malfoy.” He looked at her out of the corner of his eye. “I don’t trust you.” This wasn’t news to him. He let out a short, curt snort. “I don’t trust you,” she repeated pointedly, urging him not to interrupt again, “but he does, which is enough for me because I know he doesn’t trust easily. It took me lying about going after a troll by myself for him to consider me a friend.
It was easy enough to not care about what strangers thought about you. It was a whole other challenge to face those who called themselves your friends. Pleasant smiles and kind words were not always enough, not when you knew what it felt like for them to go sour. They were both in new territory.
“I’m fine,” Harry snarled. “There’s nothing wrong with me. I don’t need any help.”
“He always told me that everything Dudley was saying was a lie,” continued Harry. “I wasn’t a waste of space or useless or ugly. I was good. As long as I was nice to people, then I was good.”
“What are you doing?” Draco questioned. Harry looked up from the clothes he was folding into the luggage. Draco stood in the doorway, frowning at him. “We just got here. We can give it a few days before we move back to the flat.” He glanced down that hall. “I’m actually having quite a bit of fun cleaning this place up.”
Malfoy pursed his lips, nodding slowly as he turned his head back to the television. "Right, well, I'm sure all of the ladies are thrilled about that."
Suddenly the general indifference the rest of the eighth-years had for Malfoy made more sense. Whatever hostility that had once been between them in the first few weeks must have vanished on nights like those. Harry was sort of disappointed he had missed it. Still, it was comforting to know that he wasn’t the only one who had somewhat warmed up to Malfoy.
Draco’s eyes became the size of bludgers. “And you never told me?” He looked absolutely betrayed.
for inspiring Harry to play quidditch.
She rolled her eyes. “Please, not even the Auror Office can hide blatant murders like that from the Daily Prophet. It’s better for my image that I stay away from that type of stuff, but it is causing quite the stir on the floor.”
“Oh, now it’s suddenly Draco again?” he hissed.
“Well, don’t frown over here then. Come on. We won’t bite.”
Draco took a long time to respond. He kept his gaze forward, continuing to sip at his tea until he ran out. Having nothing else to occupy him, he finally shook his head. “She knows some of it. I can’t lie to her well.”
She sat down in the re-transfigured chair beside his bed. “They’re letting you out today. You’re going to be up on your feet barreling into duels again in no time.”
There was no malice in his tone and it made Harry smile. His eyes inadvertently grazed over the other man’s lips. “Yeah, I suppose you’re right.”
Draco frowned at the folder again, as if he could see through the thick paper. That didn’t add up with the assumption that they had all been random killings. Draco had watched enough muggle television to know that location mattered. “I might have been mistaken about him being crazy,” Draco said. Harry looked at him oddly. “Well, he is crazy, but he isn’t stupid. Weren’t you nearly caught in Diagon Alley during the war?”
Draco waited until Monday to check the book again. A smile broke across his face the moment he saw the familiar writing.
Malfoy’s jaw began to flex in the way that it did when he was mulling something over. Finally, he appeared to relax although he never touched Harry again. “Are you okay now?”
"I can apparate you to the apartment and then come back for this stuff," Harry suggested.
Draco perked up. "Do you?"
“What?” Harry frowned. He wasn’t sure why her teasing tone felt so disconcerting. “No. Actually, you guys can come, too, if you like.”
Another short sound came out of Draco’s mouth, this one closer to a laugh. “Yes, you were Dumbledore’s favorite. He would give that to an underage wizard prone to getting into trouble.”
Draco’s eyes became convincingly wide, his mouth falling open. “You pervert!”
But the drink and my wandering hands
Harry took his own deep breath, but it did not relax him. It only pulled in the hot ire that he’d had when talking to the snake. “Well, he figured out that you told me about last year.” Draco shifted his weight on the bed, this fingers beginning to assault his thumb. Harry went on, trying to make his words sound as ridiculous and unbelievable as possible, “Then he tried to make it sound like you were gonna jump me in my sleep or something.”
"I always said that I'd mess up eventually
"Wait, let me get this right." Malfoy waved his hand as if shaking away any previous thought. "Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World, doesn't like being part of the wizarding world?" He was grinning from ear to ear, but there was curiosity circling his eyes, a light crease in his brow.
If Harry had left Malfoy, then he couldn’t still be too upset with Ron. Maybe he’d accept an offer. “When you’re done with that, you can come over for dinner tonight,” Ron suggested. “It’s been a while.”
“I do know I don’t want to be here when he wakes up,” Robards went on, his eyes opening but becoming very distant. “Macnair already had his next victim with him, a girl he yanked from the next muggle town over. We’re doing our best, but it doesn’t look good for her.”
“From what Pansy says, it would be impossible.” A shiver ran down Draco’s body. He felt properly violated. “They have pictures of us kissing.”
The sneer fell off. Malfoy blinked once and then turned away, never giving Harry a response.
Malfoy finally reached back and unclasped Harry’s hand, pushing it back down to the bed beside his other hand. “And you’re drunk.”
“Do you want to lay down at least?”
Malfoy shoved his face away before all of the words could get out of his mouth. A barking laugh tore out of Harry. The girls laughed with him.
statues. It depicted several familiar faces, including Albus Dumbledore, Cedric Diggory, and Dobby the house-elf. All of the names of the fallen from both wizarding wars were etched into the base. When it was first put up, Harry had to forcibly avoid the atrium or otherwise be stuck staring at the faces he once saw with life behind their eyes or the various names that were too familiar. It was almost impossible to avoid completely.
Malfoy’s mouth had tightened, still assessing even as he spoke, “I am not frowning.”
Harry swore the room got colder as he neared the Slytherin table. Dozens of snake eyes were on him in a flash. Some were apprehensive, others truly disdainful, but none meaning anything to Harry.
“Okay,
Harry was still amazed by Robards' ability to just flip a switch when his wife occasionally popped by the office as if he had no worry at all. Harry wasn't sure he would ever be able to do that.
Malfoy followed his gaze, a grimace forming on his face when he realized what Harry was talking about. "I don't think so. I accidentally sat on the controller thingy, and people started talking really loudly. I had to pull it out the wall to make it stop."
Harry truly loved Ron and all of the Weasleys who had played rounds of low flying quidditch with him in the paddock by the Burrow, but none of it was quite like playing against Malfoy. And without the fear of being spotted by muggles, they were free to push their limits.
"I'm no good at healing charms, and I was too busy trying to figure out how to track him down again. We're pretty sure he left the country. I had to spend an hour trying to talk to the French Auror department, and all they did was say how they would
Potter couldn’t have the same trouble. He was always so good at it, though. He knew the signs. He knew the right words to say and to ask permission before touching. Malfoy should have realized he was just doing what he had always wanted in return.
Harry spun around. Zabini put his hands up in caution. “You can’t keep me away if he wants me there.”
He looked to the healer who was still watching him warily. “Can you take him to her?”
Robards strategically slipped between Lucius and his Auror. His back was to Harry as he stood off against Lucius. “What have I told you about coming here? My predecessors might have let you come and go as you pleased but my people are far too busy to move furniture for you.” There was a bitterness to Robards’ tone that made his remark sound personal. Harry wondered if he’d been one of the Aurors who’d been sent out on that call.
"Look, I don't get why you're so upset. We're keeping him for a few days to cool off and watch him. If he turns out to be a threat, then we'll deal with him in court like we do everyone else. It's Terry, though. He told me why he went there, and I can't say I blame him. If Fred's killer was still on the loose-"
Harry was considering getting up to search through their movie rentals for something they hadn't watched yet when Draco spoke up. "I think I need a haircut." Harry looked over to see the other man twiddling with the ends of his shoulder-length tresses.
Not in a million years would Malfoy have believed he would ever see Harry Potter in such a position. To look so vulnerable. To be in just as much pain as Malfoy, himself.
Malfoy almost looked twice as alarmed when he heard her speak. However, Harry merely shook his head, not appearing the slightest bit concerned by the assumption. “No, I’m not his type.”
"Says you, why are you putting honey in it?" Harry urged. "I mean, it's better than Hermione. Hers is seventy percent sugar; I think she really has a sweets problem now that she doesn't live with her parents."
That was understandable enough. Narcissa had always been rather doting when it came to her son – she reminded Harry of his Aunt Petunia in that way – he couldn’t imagine seeing Draco in the state that Harry had found him in was ever comforting to her.
Kreacher was almost delighted to see Draco and attempted to feed them again. They barely managed to talk him out of it. “Oh, I wanted to grab another pair of jeans, I’m running out too quickly. I’ll be right back.”
A new habit formed. In the span of another week, Harry continued to bring dinner to Malfoy's. Malfoy always opened the door for him to come in, eventually telling Harry to not even bother knocking.
Nevertheless, he felt strange trying to lie. He was so tired of lying. It never made anything better; it only made complications and led to poor decisions.
The gentle, friendly curve of Harry’s mouth fell away and it was almost more disconcerting. So it was really Potter. “Hey, I’m trying to be nice here. You don’t have to call my friends names.”
“Who?”
Her wand was drawn, darting threateningly between the pair but noticeably lingering on Malfoy longer. “What happened? Why are you two trying to kill each other again?”
"Wait, Draco. I don't-" But it was too late. Draco had already bolted towards the bedroom. Harry got up to follow, but he heard the sharp click of the bathroom door locking before he could reach it in time. "Draco!" he called, knocking on the door.
His smile faltered as his gaze fell to the cart which was still near the door. “Then I heard he got caught. I decided to do it myself. I went there the next night,” his eyes slid towards Harry, “only to find you walking into the building. I kept going back but you were there
Harry let out an exaggerated groan, dragging his feet towards the door. It was clearly a sarcastic gesture and one that made Malfoy chuckle.
The man shook his head. A long sigh left his lips, and he took off the dark-rimmed glasses that had fallen to the edge of his nose, folding them on top of his papers before he looked up at Potter. "I'm not tearing apart a whole department just because one Death Eater got a little bruised up."
He didn’t cower, though, because he knew his intentions and his capabilities. “I couldn’t hurt him,” he turned slowly back towards the girl,  “even if I wanted to. He has this annoying habit of saving me, and us Slytherins; well…we never forget a debt.”
"I'm aware, Potter," Robards said. "I was one of the jury members who voted in his favor." His voice was low and even but lethal, and it sent a shiver down Harry's spine, making him realize his mistake.
"Yeah, right," Draco scoffed. "Like any sane person would actually like having to continue to save the population after doing it for the first seventeen years of their life. Don't you want a break?"
Harry rolled his eyes. “You have no idea how huge that is. Everyone was so worried he’d never be the same after…” Harry couldn’t even say it. “Even Seamus and Dean are happy.”
Harry’s dark, lustful eyes widened. “You little-“ He broke off, shooting up to snatch his pillow and drop it over Draco’s head. “How’s my breath smell under there?”
“It’s early,” Harry noted once the door was closed. “People definitely saw you come in here.”
Harry looked back at his friends to give them tentative smiles. “So?”
Harry sent Draco a nervous glance, and Draco assumed he was getting uncomfortable. He attempted to intercept Pansy before she pushed too far, but Harry surprised him by speaking up. “He talked with his hands a lot.”
He was putting together their morning tea when he heard a knock on the door. He stiffened.
Harry wanted to back his friend up, but he remembered what their boss had told them. "Actually, Robards said an Ex-Death Eater lived here." He cast another look at Skeres, who hadn't changed. "And I don't remember him being a Death Eater." Skeres' scathing look flicked up to Harry as if he had just insulted his whole existence.
The attention was yet to leave Harry so he started up a conversation with Ron about Quidditch which Ginny and Seamus quickly joined. Hermione saw that she’d lost Draco in their discussion. He was too busy listening faintly to Harry.
Malfoy gave him an odd look. "I wouldn't make you do that. You don't like going into wizard populated areas either."
Harry took the interruption to attempt to pass. “I have important business to get to. If you have a complaint, file it elsewhere.”
It felt like a hammer had smashed against Harry’s ribcage. The shock reverberated down through his nerves and made his whole body jittery. He sat up. “Like Zabini?”
While Harry was not in the mood for jokes, he was not offended enough to release the pair on Malfoy. He settled for dealing with it himself. “Thanks, that’s very comforting. How about you comment on my lack of decorum and appearance next?”
“Only for that reason,” Ron amended, sitting back again. Draco agreed with a vigorous nod.
"I'm in my bed
“Hey there, Teddy,” Ron greeted, making Teddy grin. “I see you’re getting experimental with your hair.” Most of Teddy’s head had gone a white-blond color although the tips remained cyan. “It kind of fits…” Ron trailed off. His eyes had traveled to the man holding him, spotting their matching emerald eyes and then the man beside him whose hair was almost the same as the child’s. “Hm, who would have thought you two had a kid before the rest of us.”
Draco shook his head frantically. “I know you’re family. I knew that was a possibility. I came back to this living hell because I thought there was some chance that that was what happened, but you’ve been out of your mother’s reach for months. We share a dormitory. You could have told me!” Draco couldn’t take it anymore. He was on his feet. He didn’t leave but instead began to pace back and forth.
Malfoy looked back down at the uniquely shaded family. “Is he…” He wasn’t sure how to ask this delicately, but Voldemort’s taunts of babysitting the ‘cubs’ echoed in his head. “Is he, er, like his father?”
Malfoy cringed. "I think Cho Chang would have to disagree. You had the poor girl in tears."
Draco considered the question for several seconds before taking the Butterbeer bottle from his lips. “The spell took some working, and I had to steel a lot of hairpins from the girls to transfigure them into pins. Once I got them all, it was only one night.”
Draco had been taken back by the news about Goyle. Harry was annoyed but not surprised when Draco didn’t get angry about it, likely assuming he deserved it. If only every knew what kind of prison Draco put himself in. It was far worse than the fait that awaited Goyle.
Draco’s face scrunched up in disgust. “Oh Merlin, that was horrid!”
“Sitting down.”
This time Malfoy was the one to jab him. “That wasn’t–”
“You’re an idiot.”
I love you.
“No, they don’t.” Draco’s eyes flashed up to meet Harry’s. The piercing green gaze sent a shudder down his spine. “But I still think we should talk―alone.” Harry threw a look at Myrtle, who hovered over the top of the cubicles, trying to spy on the sudden silence. She made a face.
Draco shrugged. “I only wanted my due recognition.”
A crease formed on Heather's brow as she glanced back at Harry. "Well, yeah, that's just what I call you," he lied poorly. "It's short for, er, Drake."
They all shuffled carefully past Andromeda who barely moved to give them enough room to pass. Silence remained behind them, but as Draco mumbled once they were out of earshot, “It’s better than screaming.”
Harry’s heart was hammering now. “What the hell? He’s the worst offender of all of us! At least no one else brings outsiders up here, and just because you weren’t miserable on the sofa?”
Completely forgetting the dinner on the table, Harry grabbed Draco's wrist and dragged him out of the kitchen.
“Don’t be a sore loser, Malfoy,” Harry’s voice was lifted by his broad smile. “You can try again next time.”
She gave an innocent shrug. “By now, I would hope I know both of you well enough.”
“That means I like you too,” Teddy declared in the same whisper as before. “That’s why I gave you extra sprinkles. I only give my friends extra sprinkles.”
Draco shook his head. "It was clearly the result of a cursed object, though. Sedation is seldom the answer for that. Your body is so weak from fighting off the curse, sedating it will likely put you in a coma."
With a swipe of his wand, the door opened. Laughing hit his ears the moment he entered. A small girl too young for Hogwarts came whizzing down the stairs, a boy who was just a bit older right behind her.
Harry turned towards him again. The movement caused Draco to jump out of his thoughts; he shook his head trying to regain some control on his own mind. Harry barely managed to conceal the growing grin on his face. “You okay?”
"You look happy today," Harry commented when she brought over their order. She'd had a permanent grin plastered on her face since they'd come in.
Ron gestured to where Harry was now on top of Malfoy and doing his damndest to push as many sticks into Malfoy’s ‘perfect’ hair. “Go ahead now. I don’t think he’ll notice.”
Instead of reaching for his skin, Harry secured a hold on his shirt, keeping him sitting. He tightened his fingers around the bunch of cloth underneath Draco’s ribcage. “It’s not stupid,” he assured, meeting Draco’s eyes again. “Dumbledore did promise that we’d protect you if you helped us. You saved me in the manor. It makes sense to think that you’d think–“
Silence fell across everyone in the room. They listened to the soft roll of water in the kettle as it gradually grew to a boil. Narcissa’s eyes continued to roam the flat. There were potion ingredients but there were also muggle items she didn’t know the name of and things she knew her son would never purchase of his own volition. Another person lived here. It wasn’t just casual nights on the sofa to save a friend from having to go home late either, though the letters she had received had made it seem this way.
Ron was reluctant to look away from Draco. He intended to only glance down, but his attention became stuck on Harry’s name addressed on the letter. Ron shook his head and snapped his eyes back to Draco. “You probably stole his post so you could keep tabs on him. You wouldn’t be the first.”
Harry straightened. He turned to his most trusted friend and partner and stared at him as if he was talking about a Crumple-Horned Snorkack. His eyes narrowed a fraction, appearing to be considering if Ron needed to be taken to the psychiatric ward of Saint Mungo’s. “Sorry?”
It was selfish to ask, he knew that, but this was the first time in three years that this day didn’t hurt. He couldn’t bear to be alone today of all days.
“We’ve behaved!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ron and Hermione aren’t my first friends.”
Harry pressed his forehead against the door, almost precisely where Malfoy did the same on the other side. “I’m not going anywhere,” Malfoy repeated, his voice softening.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Lovely, more people who know my address."
The two girls ran off upstairs, but Harry was still watching his friends. They were both still frowning, though now having one of their silent conversations. It was only the little huff beside him that made him look away. “You owe me, Potter.”
“What do you want, Zabini?”
“Are you certain the people who know are trustworthy?”
Robards took this as a slim form of an apology and lowered himself into his chair. “Of course, I could have helped you avoid this ever happening if you would have told me in the first place.”
“Go on to lunch without me,” Harry spoke up, his eyes locked on the pack of Slytherins in front of them.
Harry chuckled from the sofa. “I know he used to do so in school. It was the quickest way to get your attention.”
“I couldn’t just sit around and wait for someone else to do it!” Harry exclaimed.
“And no one else actually wanted me there.”
Harry felt a weight he had not noticed before lift off his chest at the easy first question. “My father’s invisibility cloak.”
“Hello, Draco,” a lofty voice interrupted Draco’s inner contemplations. He lifted his eyes up from the muddled origami sitting in front of him.
He started to stand up, trying to busy himself by taking their plates to the sink to help Kreacher. He barely got an inch out of his chair, Malfoy grabbing his sleeve. “You aren’t a bother, Potter,” he urged, his face solemn. “It would be a bother if you made me go home and come back to get my things because I meant what I said earlier; I’m not leaving you alone.”
It's not what I meant
The crooked smile on Harry's face stirred something in Malfoy. He snapped his head forward and glared his frustration into the fireplace. "You can do whatever, but I'm not sharing a bed with you. I like to stretch."
Harry’s brain was still floating somewhere in the clouds. He could barely bring himself to take his eyes off of Draco’s mouth, even as he panted to catch his breath.
“You noticed that, too, then?” Harry asked. “Him and Zabini? I mean, I don’t remember them being best friends before―not like Crabbe and Goyle―but Zabini seems to be the one who’s acting like a tool now.”
Harry frowned at him until he remembered his busted lip. He had gotten used to the swollen feeling, so he'd almost forgot about it. "Our culprit got away from me," he sighed.
Ron scoffed. “Do you think I would have come after you if there were other people there to witness what happened?”
Harry rolled his eyes but listened as Malfoy’s steps continued up the stairs. He could almost faintly hear his muffled steps overhead until it faded into the popping sound of the fireplace.
Malfoy heaved a long sigh. Nevertheless, he began to clean up his school work and shoved it to the end of the table. He stood up and made his way to the couch beside Harry. “It’s really not a big deal.”
While Draco tried not to let his excitement show, Harry could read it in his pink face and searching eyes. He chuckled before dropping to plant another kiss on Draco’s lips. “I have to go,” he murmured, still close enough for their lips to brush.

“I hope you have a good life, Zabini.” With that, he snapped the door shut behind him.
Malfoy closed his book with a snap. “I’ll see you on the quidditch pitch in fifteen minutes.” The smile on Harry’s face was undeniable. Malfoy noticed it too. “Keep it up, Potter. I’ll wipe that grin off in just a few minutes.”
Harry was too uncomfortable to resist making a face. Mary was nice, but she was rather mousy for Harry's taste. There was also the fact that he didn't really feel like dating.
“It is strange,” said Hermione, once again stating the obvious. “Are you sure you aren’t up to something?”
“Potter,” he still preferred to say his surname outside the Common Room.
Draco stared at him through dark eyes. His legs felt like jelly. He wasn’t too far gone not to notice the smug smirk on Harry’s lips. “Wanker,” he mumbled.
“What?”
Ron leaned forward around the pair to glare at Harry. “You did this. You brought these nerds together.”
“I thought you were itching to play a real game,” Malfoy muttered, keeping his eyes expertly trained on assessing his broom rather than the two teams of students glaring at him.
Draco was almost ready to disregard it completely but paused as he glanced it over. It was on the same topic they were currently working on in class. Upon further inspection, he realized it was the homework that was due Monday.
Draco pursed his lips at the last comment. So they weren’t a Slytherin. It was a muggle book; he wasn’t really expecting it to be. He should have probably taken this as a sign to forget about the whole endeavor. Nonetheless, it was the most exciting thing to happen to him in almost a month.
Harry’s heart jolted when he looked back at the wide-eyed stare, but it faded under the pale gaze. “Yes, and to be perfectly honest, a part of me was hoping it would work for me, too. I thought you would put down some of your walls. I never realized I was the one who still had them up. I shouldn’t have done that to you.”
Before he began to move his feet, he saw a form dash towards him. His hand tightened around his wand. It was a hooded figure. Was it Voldemort? Had he finally joined the fight to kill Harry?
“What things?”
This continued, and their attention slow turned back to the television. After a while, Draco's fingers stopped moving until he just let his arm drape across the back of the sofa. Harry almost seemed to follow his hand, sitting deep into the sofa and dropping his head back against Draco's arm.
Draco looked away from the tables and took a mental measure of the large stain-glass windows. The sun had finally dipped past the horizon, the last few gold hues of the day drenching the glass. He had at least another hour before the library closed.
“Get off my bed, you dunce.” He shoved hard against Harry’s head and pushed him off.
Harry gave him a shrewd look. “That’s what you said last time I told you there was a leak in the department.” He tossed the paper on the desk to punctuate his statement, too tense to feel remorse.
“You arsehole!” Draco hissed.
“Go,” Robards told him. “I’ll call you back when things begin to calm down or we get a lead.”
"I'm fine, Malfoy," Harry assured, starting to understand his thought process. "I'm not hurt. You didn't hurt me. We aren't going anywhere. I promise. Please, Malfoy, just take some deep breathes. It'll help, I promise."
Malfoy began to shake his head harder. “No, no. I don’t want to put her in that position. It’s better that we don’t have any contact.”
Hermione snapped her head up to Ron. He was staring at the elf, a tight expression on his face. “Ron,” she urged.
Draco scoffed. “Fine, keep sleeping on the sofa, then. I was only trying to be nice.”
She shook her head. “No, he only said you weren’t cleared. He was very brief. I thought it was a bit rude, honestly.”
Ron glanced once in the direction of Malfoy. He was in his usual spot on the other side of the room with plenty of people and chatter to distance them. Nevertheless, Ron leaned close to speak. “I admit that it’s weird he’s back but didn’t we agree that it doesn’t mean anything? He hasn’t even been that much of a prat.”
“Need him?” Ron repeated. “For what?”
Harry had speed-walked to Park Row. Skeres couldn't have had too much time on him. When he got to the street, he didn't see anything out of the ordinary but still considered apparating into Malfoy's apartment to make sure he hadn't been too late. Just before he could make a rash decision, he spotted the familiar slim form pass the window on the third floor.
for being there when he was brought to the Dursleys that night as Hagrid years later had revealed to him.
“You skipped two meals.”
Harry's shoulders fell. Maybe it was time for him to leave. He didn't want to have a repeat of the night before. The thought of going back to Grimmauld didn't sound appealing, though.
Without a word, Malfoy placed his glass on the table and swirled it around the glass before lifting it to his lips and taking a whiff; he considered the smell then took a sip, swishing it around his mouth then finally swallowing.
Harry could only make himself appear to resist. In actuality, the moment Draco’s arms looped around his neck, he began to sit up again. The hard chest against his arm was much easier to give into. He was yanked up straight, tight muscles wrapped around his shoulders and a firm hand pulling his head close. The familiar sweet but earthy scent enveloped him.
The pair didn't need to be asked twice. Harry was still pulling on his cloak when he grabbed Ron's arm and apparated. They lurched, clinging to one another's arm as they straightened out. They were in a stairwell. Harry looked down at the slip of paper Robards' had given him. It looked like an apartment - there were definitely muggles nearby. He took a mental note of the numbers (3B) and began to bound up the steps towards the third floor, muttering the room number on repeat to himself as he went.
“Do I?” Harry hummed. He pushed aside the door to the sandwich shop they often went to for lunch.
They’d come to a stop at the mouth of the corridor just off the Entrance Hall. Voices could still be heard bouncing off the stone, but none could hear them. Harry leaned against the wall, his arms crossed and a narrow-eyed look on the boy in front of him.
"There's one wizard registered in the area. My books say it's an Ex-Death Eater."
Delighted by this turn of events, they both sprung from his arms and ran towards the basement door. “Careful! No running!” he urged as he followed them down.
It became a bit addicting admitting things after that. It was for both of them. They each shared things from their favorite foods to their deepest fears, or simply things that they loathed. Their stranger told him how they despised clowns because their cousin had one at his birthday party that decided to humiliate them to get their cousin to laugh―and keep his paying parents happy. Draco told them that he had a general fear of large, wild animals ever since he was young after witnessing a young Griffin get loose in Knockturn Alley and wreak havoc. Most recently, they had both found that neither of them had a particular interest for large crowds anymore.
The last letter Draco had received continued to swirl in his head for most of the week. They’d talked about many sensitive topics but something about those words struck him strange. It nearly sounded like something Dumbledore would say at one of their school feasts.
Harry sighed. “Those two are inseparable in school as well. I’ll send a letter Mrs. Grouse and see what we can set up.”
“That will only make it worse,” Draco’s voice croaked from neglect. “People will be left to simmer longer.”
"What's it about? Maybe I could-"
A cold chill ran down Harry's spine. His silence pulled Ron around in his chair. He looked at his best mate with a worried frown – he knew that look. "You did check, right?"
“Someone who has tried to kill him?”
He arrived at the Designated Apparition Point and quickly found himself unconcerned with the discontent looks he received from anyone he passed. He rushed up to level two.
They walked until the cobblestone turned into pillows of grass below their feet.
“Muggle money?”
“Yeah, I think I have,” Harry admitted to Ron.
Harry frowned. “Doesn’t everyone who was a part of the war? Especially at the Battle of Hogwarts.”
Harry had only gotten around one of the sofas―Malfoy eyeing him on the other side like a predator on the hunt―when Hermione called everyone to attention.
Harry pulled the half-eaten piece of toast from his mouth to glare at her. “I went to bed right after you.”
Pansy sucked on her teeth, an appraising glance moving down his shirtless form. Harry suddenly became self-conscious, hugging himself. A brief spurt of something sharp shot through Draco’s chest as he stepped into her view. She pushed her lips together, trying not to laugh at either of their reactions. “Potter,” she greeted as sweetly as possible though it still sounded like a mild threat.
The wizened wizard sighed. He turned back to the young couple, his gaze hindering on Hermione. Eventually making up his mind, he shook his head. “He found Macnair.”
"I'll be out in a minute." Draco attempted to make his voice sound light, but it was an octave too high to be natural.
He wasn't sure why, but Malfoy found himself smiling at this news. Maybe it was just the realization that the fears he had had only several minutes ago would become extremely unlikely in the future. If Harry was leaving stuff there, then he'd always come back.
He wasn’t the first to get to the lift but the other occupants shifted out of his way. “Level two,” he barked at the attendant. They complied, tapping their wand to the numbers by the door.
Pieces began to fall together in Harry’s mind. Draco’s address wasn’t the first leak he’d heard of and it certainly wasn’t the last. The one that came to mind the most was, “The Macnair case! You’re the one who was telling them details about the case! Do you know how much panic that caused?”
Terry shook his head. “He doesn’t work in Public Records. He’s a caretaker at the ministry, likely the only job he could get after the war I presume. He heard me when I was down there doing the final paperwork for my father. I was with my older brother, Trenton, and we were talking Malfoy and,” he scuffed toe at the loose dirt, kicking aside a pebble, “a bunch of other stuff that was honestly out of line. He approached me, told me he knew where I could find Malfoy.”
With all of this going through his head, it made it hard to actually sleep that night. He woke up almost every hour, groaning as he checked the clock.
“Hey, Potter.” He tried to reach out for him, but Potter batted his hands away. “Potter,” he tried again. He was shaking his head now.
The moment he saw movement, he began to cast a jinx. His wand spun out of his hand before he could even speak. There was a brief moment of panic before he found relief. He gaped at the old house-elf standing before him, holding his wand.
“About you!” Hermione said. “He has some bazaar idea that you have an ulterior motive for wanting to be around him.”
Potter rolled his eyes and gave his head a good shake. “Whatever, Malfoy. I’m not letting you ruin my good mood.”
"So, this is Grimmauld?" Malfoy voiced, his eyes grazing the room. "It certainly looks like a house of Pureblood family."
“Malfoy, sir?” croaked an unfamiliar voice. Malfoy jumped. His eyes snapped to the kitchen, looking for the source but not seeing anything over the counter. Padded steps grew closer. He hurried to grab his wand off of the coffee table and scrambled to his feet.
Draco was still on edge on the streets, but Pansy observed how Potter would touch his hand, and he’d calm down a bit. He wasn’t all there. It was more like he was letting Potter lead him, but he was
