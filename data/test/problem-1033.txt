“Only because they’re shit and it’s just another way to torture us,” Crabbe interjected. Despite his complaints, Harry could hear him scrapping this plate for every last bit of the meal.
Unable to hold in it, a tear fell down Harry’s cheek. He let go of his shirt and furiously wiped away the tear before rubbing at his eyes. It didn’t stop them from coming, now that Harry had let the first tear fall.
The rest of the evening was spent talking about inane topics. Some of the Death Eaters spoke about the jobs they had prior to their arrest. They had asked him what profession he planned to pursue, but Harry he hadn’t thought of a backup plan since realizing that being an auror was no longer feasible. Lucius observed that Harry had enough money that he probably didn’t need to work if he didn’t want to. Both Lucius and Nott were independently wealthy, so they had spent their time schmoozing people in power in order to influence them. They found it to be quite satisfactory.
From the practice he had creating Albert's box, it was exceedingly easy to create a stone etching of a porcupine. Harry then created a slab with a peacock.
The other prisoners didn’t even hesitate to remove their clothes. Public showers had become common practice for them. Both Lucius and Nott moved leisurely as they matched Harry’s slow pace. He was reluctant to remove his clothes as he noticed many of the prisoners were still giving him curious looks. Harry tried not to peek at anyone, but the room quickly filled with naked men. He couldn’t avoid having his eyes land on someone’s naked arse. Or their Azkaban tattoo. The latter pained him as it reminded him of his own. Harry was surprised that not all prisoners had their tattoo on their neck. The ones that didn’t seems to already have some other tattoo in the place where their Azkaban number would have gone. Instead, this tag was placed on their chest or arms.
“Maybe keep moving in case Snape went to fetch McGonagall,” Harry said. Hale nodded and the two of them continued to walk towards the gate.
“What was that?” a low voice asked. Harry turned his attention back towards Malfoy’s cell. The man was no longer in peacock form.
“I want to tell you, but I can’t,” Harry said. He looked away from Draco, but didn’t pull away physically.
“Exactly,” confirmed the other Lestrange brother. “Your glasses would be a perfect tool to cast the spell on,” he added.
“I will carry Harry’s child myself if it comes to that,” Draco said, trying to end the conversation so he and Harry could have it in private first.
Harry snorted as he imagined the organized and colour-coded assignments that were waiting for him. Normally it would be an unhappy thought, but now he was curious to see how close the Death Eaters had gotten to the sixth-year curriculum.
“Er, Reginald?” Harry said. He felt awkward interrupting their conversation, but was too hopeful to walk on by.
“Our records show Mr. Potter cast the cruciatus on one Bellatrix Lestrange. Duration was only for a couple of seconds,” stated one of the other aurors. Like Bole, the man seemed cold and stern. “Likely he realized that it wasn’t smart to cast such a curse on ministry grounds and cancelled it. Too late, I’m afraid.”
Burke calmed down somewhat once he realized his threats were working. His face wasn’t as red with anger as it had been just moments ago.
“Wait,” someone called. Harry only stopped because he recognized it as Draco’s voice. Harry turned around but didn’t move any closer.
“You could also use a surrogate,” Lucius suggested, either unaware or unconcerned about risking some unknown person’s life if Harry’s worst fears came to pass.
“Yes. Sometimes just talking helps. It distracts you from all the bad things going through your head, you know? I think that’s why they wanted to teach me. It gave them something else to focus on. And I learnt a lot,” Harry said earnestly.
As the only two who could make eye contact with him, Albert and Lucius were the ones to test Harry’s practical skills. Without their wands, they were limited in how long they could keep it up. Especially since they had to go on deep dives to really test Harry’s skills. Harry started off decently enough and kept them distracted by random, trivial thoughts. Inevitably, one thought would catch their interest and when they followed that thread and poked at it, Harry couldn’t prevent a whole slew of memories from unravelling, all centered on a concept or emotion. It led to many awkward moments.
“What the fuck happened?” the man asked. The other guards shifted uncomfortably before turning one by one to look at Harry. In response, Harry’s breathing once again grew laboured. Wiblin, the man closest to the door, stepped forward.
“Potter,” the guard paused as he placed Harry’s trousers and pants on the bed. As much as Harry desperately wanted to be fully clothed, he didn’t dare let go of the sheet while the guards were still there. The man seemed equally uncomfortable. “Did Maxim... had he managed... shit, did Burke penetrate you?” the man eventually managed to ask.
“Er, nothing. I mean, it opened a connection between our minds. He was able to use it to send me false visions. But nothing from the horcrux itself...” Harry said. “I think it was too small of a piece. Or maybe because it was unintentionally made.”
“I think he’s understood it just fine, minister,” a sneering voice called from one of the cells. At Mulciber’s words, Scrimgeour seemed to recall that they were not truly alone. He straightened up and smoothed imaginary wrinkles out of his cloak.
“I have an idea,” Albert cut in. Harry couldn’t help but be impressed by Albert’s problem-solving skills and the sheer amount of knowledge he had. He taught Harry a new spell that called upon a person’s memory in order to place a still image on parchment. The result, if done correctly, would resemble a muggle picture. The process was simple, but Harry needed several attempts as he was not skilled in the mind arts. His first few tries resulted in something more akin to a drawing than a photo – and not a very good drawing. Harry also scrapped several blurry photos before he was able to create a realistic static photo of Bellatrix. He still frowned at the result.
Harry nodded and Hale stood up. He hesitated then turned back to Harry. “After my interview with Albert, I plan to head directly to the ministry. I’m fairly certain they are finally willing to schedule your trial. Some members of the ministry are being bullheaded enough that they do not want to drop the charges, so a trial looks unavoidable. I’m not worried. I never make these sort of promises, but I promise you that you will be out of Azkaban in less than a week,” Hale vowed. His certainty gave Harry hope.
“You didn’t know?” she asked with surprise. The woman looked equal parts awkward but pleased to tell him, “well, congratulations Mr. Potter. You have a son.”
“Auror Bole, Auror Perkins,” Runecraft nodded towards Harry, Hermione and Ron. As both aurors started making their way towards them, Harry glanced at professor Dumbledore for guidance but the man’s attention was on Runecraft.
“Yeah,” Harry said softly and regretted bringing it up. Just because they wanted to help Harry with the horcrux in him, didn’t mean that they would be happy to hear about how he had already destroyed one of their dark lord’s horcruxes. Unfortunately, they were all now curious about it. Harry hesitantly added, “the diary”.
“I feel like a shit dad,” Harry admitted one day. The boys had just been set down for a nap. Whenever this happened, Harry felt a sense of relief as he got a break from James. He always felt guilty about it, but that guilt was easier to ignore than when he had to care for his horcrux and pretend to be happy about his life.
I probably went into more detail than needed with Harry’s gifts to the others. I wanted to stress that Harry was learning more than simple spells. The death eaters have been encouraging him to think about the subjects deeply, to combine different types of magic, and to take charge of his own learning. And most importantly, if there is no known spell to do something, it doesn’t mean it’s impossible. It just might mean you have to create the spell yourself. This provides Harry with hope so that he’s open to the idea that there might be alternative solutions to the horcrux problem. No one has any ideas currently, but a lot can be accomplished with effort.
Draco’s research expanded into learning more about the deathly hallows. Somehow that led to Draco often reading the fable to James as a bedtime story. Eventually it got to the point where Harry had to floo Draco and ask him to come over just for the bedtime story, since James only wanted to be read to by Draco. Harry probably should have been insulted that his reading skills weren’t deemed sufficient, but he was secretly glad about James’ insistence. It gave Harry an excuse to see Draco daily.
“No, this is perfect. It’s nice to know you’re eager to keep me,” Draco smiled, and placed his hand over Harry’s. “May I?”
“He’s been cooperative so far, Burke,” interjected Perkins. Unfortunately, kind comments were the only championing he seemed willing to do for Harry.
She gave him a recap of the final battle. It turned out that Neville was the hero in the end, killing Nagini and then Voldemort at Ron and Hermione’s insistence. When they recovered Harry’s body, they were pleasantly surprised to learn he hadn’t died. Unfortunately, no one could figure out what was wrong with him. The medi-witch briefly tumbled into an explanation of the various tests and spells they tried. While it worried Harry, his immediate concern was finding out what happened to his friends.
Ron, Hermione, and Neville left with him. Harry tried to ignore everyone’s curious eyes following him, even as he sought out one particular set of grey eyes. Like most of the hall, Draco was already looking at him. Harry didn’t know what to make of the look on his face. It wasn’t the sneer he usually had directed at Harry, but it wasn’t exactly warm either. Their eyes met, and Harry was tempted to deviate from his course and go talk to him. He had initially thought he could casually drop off the letters on his way out, but he’d forgotten how gossipy the students were. Harry didn’t need everyone wondering what he gave Draco and the others, or worse discovering the letters. As tempting as it was to run straight for Draco as soon as he spotted him, Harry knew he’d have to wait until he could get the other boy alone. Not that he had any idea how he’d convince any of the Slytherins to meet him. With a sigh, Harry turned away from Draco and followed Hermione out of the hall.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” asked Zabini. Draco shrugged. He kept glancing at Harry but looking away as soon as Harry returned his attention. It wasn’t the reaction Harry hoped for, but at least it wasn’t antagonistic.
“But... you...” Harry floundered. He wasn’t sure what ritual Draco thought created a horcrux, but he doubted it was the real one. If Draco really knew, he would not calmly lay with him and try to reassure him.
Harry's efforts had been enough for the Malfoys’ lawyer to contact him. After listening to what Harry had to say in their defence, the man felt he had enough to try appealing Narcissa and Draco's convictions. Kingsley had tried to dissuade Harry once he'd heard, but dropped it after Andromeda spoke to him privately. Harry didn't know what the woman said to him, but afterwards Kingsley was content to let it play out in court without actively trying to sabotage their efforts.
“Er, in that case, I can pass on a verbal message for you,” Harry offered. Crabbe was the only one that immediately took him up on his offer, though he asked for some time to consider what to say.
Both wizards watched Harry silently for a few moments. Harry watched them in turn but his focus was mostly on Malfoy. Given their past interactions, Malfoy felt like the bigger threat to Harry. Except now Malfoy had become gaunt since his stay in Azkaban, which made him look less threatening. It some ways it reminded Harry of Draco Malfoy’s slow deterioration as of late. It wasn’t uncommon to see Draco with dark circles under his eyes. Despite not looking as pristine as he was used to, Lucius did seem in better shape than Harry would have expected. Of course, Harry was basing that off of how Sirius had looked and his godfather had spent years in Azkaban.
“Surely the boy couldn’t have successfully cast the cruciatus at his age,” tried professor McGonagall, which brought Harry’s attention back to the ministry workers.
“I’m not sure,” Harry said slowly as he second-guessed himself and tried to remember. He knew Draco and his fellow slytherins were willing to help Umbridge, but he wasn’t sure if they did so with knowledge of exactly what went on in detention. Even if they did know, Harry wasn’t sure he could blame them for not speaking up. Harry himself had been adamant about not saying anything in the false belief that it would somehow mean Umbridge won. It seemed stupid now.
“Now is as good a time as any. It’s not like I’ll have any privacy while in Azkaban,” Mulciber pointed out.
Bradley handed the forms back to Anton. There was a slight gasp before the man was glancing at Harry’s forehead, no doubt looking for the scar, but as Harry expected, he did not make any comments about who the newest Azkaban prisoner was or question why this whole thing was happening. By now, Harry was pretty sure no one is going to speak on his behalf.
“You really don’t... hate me? Or think I’m the worst human being to ever live?” Harry asked. Draco snorted in response.
Ron and Hermione took a similar stance. They were confused when Harry started defending the Malfoys, and neither were keen to aid Harry’s efforts. Fortunately, they didn’t try to dismantle his progress either. Hermione had assumed he was doing it for Andromeda, even though he told him he would have done it anyway. It was the right thing to do. They didn’t exactly agree, but didn’t hinder him either.
Twenty minutes before the interview, Harry nervously packed up his books. Ron asked if he wanted them to go with him. Even Nott looked like he’d join if Harry requested it. Harry declined. It was going to hard enough to get through without an audience.
,” Burke accentuated his point by leaning down again. He didn’t try to slip his tongue in again. Instead he harshly bit at Harry’s lower lip in retaliation. Harry whimpered and tried to move away but that just caused more damage as the man clamped down refusing to let his prize leave.
“Yes,” Lucius sighed pleasantly. “Thank you.” After the others thanked him as well, Mulciber noted that the heated area only extended to a quarter of Rabastan’s cell.
“Maybe...” Draco conceded though he sounded unconvinced. He grew quiet as he got lost in his thoughts.
“You’re back,” said Dean. There was a round of pleasantries where they asked how Harry was doing and Harry did the same. However, it didn’t take long for Seamus’ lack of tact to drive him to ask what he really wanted to know.
“I will also release the pictures of your tattoo. That is not yet public knowledge, so that is sure to cause quite the stir. Imprisoning you without a trial is bad enough, but this. This is going too far. The ministry is not only scarring children, but branding them too? It won’t go over well. Once the public is suitably is upset, I will release a statement that you are willing not to press charges for the tattoo if the ministry stops holding you illegally. It will present you as kind and forgiving – a clear contrast to how the ministry is behaving,” Hale summarized. Harry nodded even though he did not forgive Burke or Wiblin. He would love to press charges, but if letting it go allowed him to be released, he would suck it up.
A sniffling sound had him turning to look at his side, and was heartbroken at seeing Mrs. Weasley dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief. His own eyes filled with tears in response. “I’m sorry,” he croaked. It was aimed at Mrs. Weasley, but he owed it to every Weasley gathered in the room.
“Watch your head,” advised Perkins. He placed his hand on Harry’s head and he guided him into the closest carriage. The two aurors then joined him in the carriage. As soon as the door closed behind the second auror, the carriage started to move. Harry’s hopes of having one of the professors stop them were completely dashed.
“Oh, no, Harry dear. It’s... these things sometimes happen,” Mrs. Weasley managed to say, though a few more tears fell. Mr. Weasley moved up beside her to offer a comforting embrace, though Harry noted the man’s eyes were also brimming with tears.
Harry let Draco take the ring from him. His breath hitched a second time that night when Draco got on bended knee with the ring held up as an offering.
“Once, I'd had a nightmare. The dementors had just been by, so I was... unsettled. I must have talked in my sleep,” Harry started with a lie because he couldn't explain the memories Albert had seen with the occlumency/legimency lessons. “I didn’t mean to tell him, but he s- heard some of it. He asked ...”
Harry really didn’t want to look, but eventually could resist no more. The black symbols were not overly large but stood out prominently on his neck. The skin around the area was an angry red shade, but as Burke patted the area, the red seemed to be receding.
Still... Harry also knew it would be effective. He and Hermione were on a wild goose chase to find all of Voldemort’s horcruxes. If by some miracle they managed that, they still had to figure out how to destroy them.
It looked like Malfoy wanted to say something more but instead he shivered and glanced in the direction the dementor was coming from. Without comment he turned into his peacock form and backed up in his cell. A glance in Nott’s direction revealed that he was in his animagus form as well.
“Isn’t that your judicial-wizard?” asked Hermione and gestured to where the man had stopped to talk to a younger Slytherin.
“It slowly peels up the toenails and then rolls them up. Before the nails can detach, they uncurl and reset properly in the foot. After a minute the process starts again,” explained Malfoy. Harry had unconsciously shifted and protectively placed his feet under his bum.
“No, no, don’t give me your stuff. You’ve done enough; I don’t deserve it,” Harry said. Draco sighed, but decided not to force Harry into pajamas.
I hope no one feels Harry is too OOC. I figure he’s quiet here because of shock and fear. Also, he’s not always good about sticking up for himself. If they had arrested some of his friends with him then he might have fought more or tried to escape. I’ll try to bring in sassy Harry later on once he’s grown accustomed to the situation.
“Er,” Harry stammered and blushed fiercely. His eyes widened when he saw Mulciber’s hand waving through the bars of his cell, expecting Harry to comply immediately.
“Is there any way to throw up a soul?” Harry asked as a last attempt to save both himself and Burke. He didn’t know what would happen to a partially eaten soul, but it had to be better than knowingly destroying one.
“Has he ever expressed negative thoughts about muggles, or said he’d like to hurt them?” asked Bones. Harry frowned because the answer was yes, but he didn’t want to say so. However, if he said no, it would probably be obvious that Harry was lying for Albert. Harry got the impression Albert hadn’t censored himself prior to arrest. Harry knew he’d have to give Bones a delicate balance of truth, lies, and misdirection so that Harry’s statements came across as honest, believable, and left a good impression of Albert.
Mulciber first taught him the spell to temporarily improve one’s sense of smell. It was a good thing that he couldn’t cast the charm at the moment. Being prevented from showering for a few days made Harry self-conscious of his smell. He didn’t need to improve his senses anymore than they already were. However, it was a simple enough spell that he might remember it once he had his wand.
“Be that as it may, it is too soon to have Potter return. He should be barred from classes until we’re all certain he’s ready to return,” Snape insisted.
“But why? They never seemed interested in us as more than a snack,” said Mulciber. Harry didn’t have an answer for him.
Even in the dim lighting of Azkaban, Harry noted the fear that flashed across Lucius’ face. It occurred to Harry that the man might not want his fellow death eaters to know about his involvement in the destruction of one of the horcruxes. Harry censored himself as he told the story of his second year. He vaguely mentioned that Ginny happened to have found the diary, and he skipped completely over how he managed to trick Lucius into freeing Dobby.
Burke seemed to stew for a moment. Harry was sure the man was going to do something drastic, but to his surprise, Burke just hissed “get in line! Your shower time is over!”
“It wasn’t the only time we were almost caught... I keep thinking... I know our chances aren’t good. I know I could die,” Harry said. Ginny inhaled sharply, but Harry continued before she said anything in response to that. “I don’t plan to make it easy for them, but I know I could die. I just need... I need to take him with me, you know? I need to make sure that everyone else is okay first.”
The man stopped at the open door and took in the occupants of the cell with a look of shocked horror. He slowly made his way into the cell.
“Alright... if you can’t... I won’t ask again unless I get stuck and need a new angle to explore,” Draco offered. Harry nodded in gratitude, knowing that he’d made Draco’s research significantly harder.
“Wait,” Lucius said after a few moments. “Do you think you could cast some illusions to make it appear as if he is still injured?”
“Ginny told us what happened the last time she saw you,” Mr. Weasley spoke up when he noticed his wife struggling. Harry blanched then reddened. He might have been holding the product that resulted from that night, but that didn’t mean he expected Ginny’s father to bring it up.
“Get off of him,” Crabbe’s voice called out. For a brief moment Harry was relieved, thinking that perhaps Burke would stop this madness if he knew the other prisoners were awake.
She must have said something to the Weasleys because even Percy gave him an awkward speech about always being there for Harry and James. He appreciated it, he really did, but it also made him feel worse.
“Draco might not be as opposed to it as you think,” Lucius was picking his words carefully as he considered how much to reveal about his son’s feelings. When Mulciber laughed, Lucius felt he had to add on “in a relationship, not just a…”
“I will also submit your official request to be released or given a trial date,” Hale continued. “This would have been done sooner but Dumbledore was protesting the validity of my claim as your judicial-wizard,” the man sounded frustrated for the first time since the interview started.
The men were quiet as they waited for Albert’s return. No one wanted to voice their concerns beyond what was already said. Harry suspected they already knew what was happening to Albert, but no one wanted to be the one to tell Harry. They might have wanted to spare him, but it only left Harry imaging the full range of possibilities. He hadn’t quite pinned down if Burke was more of a Umbridge type of sadist, or if he was going to show more Voldemort leanings. Regardless, it left a sick feeling in his stomach. He couldn’t finish his lunch as he completely lost his appetite. It got worst the longer they had to wait for Albert’s return.
There was a brief pause as Hale pointedly looked at the guards. With reluctance, the guards left and closed the door behind them. Harry was happy to see them leave even if they stayed by the window to observe the meeting. He knew they wouldn’t be able to listen to what was said.
Harry cast magic almost non-stop throughout the day, but never felt any fatigue. He might of said he was feeling normal, if he hadn’t been wide awake while the others got ready for bed. It took some convincing for Harry to get the others to sleep instead of keeping him company all night.
“And Luna’s interview... well I’m sure you can imagine how that went,” Hermione added. Harry could. Flitwick probably didn’t bother interrupting as much since Luna would talk about nargles and blibbering humdingers. It might have been more frustrating than the professors blocking all questioning attempts.
“Hi,” said Nott with a hint of amusement. Rather than feeling defensive, it actually put Harry at ease as it reminded him of Albert.
“No,” Burke muttered, annoyed with Harry’s constant talkback. “Tell me how it works. Which motherly type is attractive? Someone to coddle you? Or, do you like it when they nag you? Is that why you cursed Lestrange? Did she remind you of mummy? Hoped she’d spank her naughty boy for using spells he shouldn’t know? I bet you would have loved-”
It was clear the ministry was trying to make Hale’s job harder. It was also clear that the ministry wasn’t just targeting Harry anymore. Albert was worried when Harry informed him, once he has been returned to his cell. They decided that Albert would be the next one that Harry would pass on a letter for. That way, he was not only able to write to his son, but he could give a freehand permission letter for all the documents Hale just had Harry sign. The ministry may not accept it if they were really determined not to, but it was worth a try.
“Fart-knocker,” howled Mulciber, while the Lestrange brothers giggled. “I have to use that some time.”
“Of course,” Hale said, though he did not ask how Lucius had gotten his hands on parchment and a quill. If the guards were being kind and considerate, it would not help either Harry or Albert’s cases.
“Potter fought him off initially. It seemed... I thought Harry would not be able hold him off any longer, but then the dementor arrived,” Lucius briefly paused, and Harry tensed waiting for the truth to come out. “The dementor might have assumed Burke was trying to escape with the boy,” Lucius suggested. Attempted escapes were usually the only time the dementors could kiss someone without ministry approval.
Dumbledore and Harry engaged in a few more pleasantries, but Harry was dismissed soon after. The headmaster suggested Harry enjoy his afternoon before he got swarmed by curious pupils.
is it OK to hurt prisoners? Why is someone like B-, like Burke rewarded for hurting people? Why does he get to walk free while doing the exact same thing some of the prisoners were arrested for?” asked Harry.
“Many of the clan thought you had somehow stolen our knowledge and were just playing dumb,” added Ishanders. “A few even proposed your immediate death so you would be unable to share this knowledge with others if your kind,” Ishanders paused here as if he was waiting for Harry to gasp in horror... but Harry was already there, for the truth was worse than whatever theories the dementors thought up. Seeing no change in Harry’s expression, Ishanders continued, “you’re lucky Asherath has taken a liking to you.”
“Albert, yours works a little differently. I used ‘Thea’ as the password to enlarge and shrink the box, but you can set a second password that would lock and unlock the box,” Harry explained.  Thea was the name of his late wife. Harry had almost set ‘Theodore’ as the lock/unlock password, but figured it would be better if the man choose his own password for what was essentially a small safety deposit box.
“Ursula is too. Only one out of three children in Slytherin,” Hale bemoaned, “my wife won that contest.”
"I would have though Mulciber would be a rabbit given he's always randy," joked Harry. "Are you the kind of rabbit with the floppy ears or straight ones?"
They made their way down a long hallway until they came to a branch. Bright light was coming from the right side and Burke lead the party down that hallway. The light was giving the place a more uplifting feeling, but Harry’s spirits crashed again before he was able to even start to relax. He saw a sign that said “Criminal Processing”.
“No, I’m ok. I mean, I stopped him before he could-” Harry realized that he had not stopped the man before he could inflict some damage, but he still felt like he should reassure Mulciber. “I’m not bleeding or anything.”
“Good on you for avenging your godfather,” as the voice continued. “Pretty ballsy of you to kill her on ministry grounds, but-”
Harry let out an embarrassingly needy whine as Draco’s lips met his. He knew he shouldn’t, but he allowed himself this one moment of weakness. Instead of pulling away, Harry deepened the kiss as he pulled Draco closer. He didn’t know if it lasted a minute or an hour, but he felt at peace and happy for the first time since he made that damned horcrux. He would have stayed that way had Draco’s other hand not started to tease the hemline of his shirt.
Ron told him the map and cloak were in the old DA room, hidden in one of the corners. Harry was a little worried that one of the other DA members might have found them, so he decided to go to the room of requirement before the kitchens. He waved goodbye to his friends before Hermione’s concern compelled her to meddle and force him to go with them.
“Can I help?” Harry blurted just as Draco reached the entrance area. Draco turned back towards him with raised eyebrows.
Harry had the most trouble with his new subjects. Alchemy was interesting but Albert and Harry found themselves limited. Harry had a hard time memorizing formulas and working through equations without the ability to take notes. Harry could tell Albert was frustrated. He couldn’t shake the feeling he was letting the man down and felt horrible about it.
As anticipated, classes the next day were much the same. The professors wanted reassurance that Harry would be able to catch up with the rest of the class. McGonagall or Snape must have relayed the conversation they had in Dumbledore’s office since Harry felt their attention on him. Not wanting to give them an excuse, Harry stuck to his initial plan but didn’t pretend to struggle as much as he’d originally intended. He’d hoped this would alleviate any concerns, but several professors cautioned him not to overextend himself. Harry felt like he was doomed whether he performed well or poorly.
Once Harry finished his shower, he hovered in case he was needed. He also didn’t want to risk running into Burke without backup. It was not the Gryffindor behaviour he was known for, but Albert’s injuries were a stark reminder of what Burke would happily enjoy doing to them all.
On Wednesday, Harry went to the ministry with McGonagall while everyone else attended classes. It was a new experience to attend a trial rather than being the one on trial. Considering his friend was the one strapped to a chair, Harry found he didn’t like attending it any more than he had his own. Albert seemed unbothered, but Harry knew how uncomfortable and demeaning that chair felt.
New clean uniforms were laid out on the benches. Given the magical resizing of the clothes, Harry assumed he could grab any pair and gratefully walked towards the set closest to where he left his glasses. Harry realized one downside of interchangeable clothes was that his old pair of pants weren’t returned to him freshly laundered. Instead he had a thin pair of tighty-whities. A quick glance at Lucius revealed the man had put on a matching pair. As he slipped his on, Harry tried not to think about how many prisoners wore that specific pair of pants previously. He would have skipped them but in Azkaban, every thin layer counted.
“We’d all been wearing it for awhile. I think it siphoned off energy or magic or something from us,” Harry said.
While Hale waited for Harry to gather his thoughts (and courage), he rolled up his sleeves. It temporarily distracted Harry as something about the action registered as wrong to him. It wasn’t until he shivered, that Harry realized Azkaban was too cold for Hale to have done so because he was warm. Harry frowned at the man’s arms. It took him a moment to realize what was bothering him was the fact that there was no tattoo. He had become used to seeing dark marks on the arms of everyone around him, that an unmarked arm registered as odd to him now. Harry felt bad for assuming Hale was a death eater simply because he represented so many of them. This was Hale’s way of assuring Harry that he wasn’t directly answering to the man that wanted to kill Harry. It didn’t mean that he wouldn’t indirectly support Voldemort’s agenda, but Harry did feel better knowing the man wasn’t a death eater.
They’d made love twice that night. The first time was hurried and perhaps a touch desperate. It was still the best he’d felt in months, and he relished the chance to just hold her. When their gentle caresses turned sensual, they made love a second time. Harry had tried to convey his love and admiration in every touch. They stayed together, just holding on to each other, until it became unsafe to remain.
him, villainized him in the press in multiple smear campaigns, and installed a woman in Hogwarts that was given free reign to torture the students? You cannot blame him if he sees your request to view his memories as suspect. Harry has every reason to believe that the ministry would find a way to use this painful memory to further humiliate him,” Hale concludes firmly over the growing protest of the wizengamot members that had voted guilty.
“Did you really cast an unforgivable curse?” asked Albert, cutting into Harry’s internal debate on whether the mattress in the cell was better or worse than the one he was stuck using every summer.
Harry was glad that Mr. Weasley got his job back. Without his salary the family would have been financially crippled. If Ron and Ginny had been arrested, the Weasleys likely would not have been able to afford a judicial-wizard.
“It’s not an unforgivable curse, but the ministry will want to make an example of them. They take break-ins very seriously,” continued Burke.
“Vince? My Vincent?” asked Crabbe from the cell next to Harry. Harry wondered if he should start referring to them by their first names so he could keep everything straight.
“I don’t know,” responded Harry. He was pretty sure the answer was no but didn’t want to talk about it.
“You’re really one of them now,” tried Burke again. Harry made some non-committal noise, which wasn’t the reaction Burke was angling for. However, Wiblin shifted and started moving back towards the end of the hallway and Burke reluctantly followed.
“Only for a second,” Harry repeated. Glancing between Nott and Malfoy, Harry could tell that they both seemed surprised.
Hale paused a moment before he asked if Harry would be willing to answer some questions about Albert. Harry readily agreed, and told Hale about Burke’s attack on Albert. When Harry glanced at the window, he was concerned to note that Albert was not waiting with the guards.
“Maybe not with any other student, but he hates me enough to make an exception,” Harry pointed out. He belatedly realized he was frowning. It was at the thought of what Snape might say about the Dursleys, but he was directing his frown towards Draco. When Draco looked away with his own frown, Harry had to hold back the impulse to call himself an idiot.
The rest of the carriage ride was spent in silence, but the speed they traveled at made the overall journey very short. Harry was surprised to find a nondescript house their destination rather than the ministry.
“Burke’s a vindictive shit,” Albert said slowly. He glanced towards his sink and debated whether it was worth the effort to get cleaned up. After sitting on his cot, it was hard to imagine he’d get up again for a long time. In the end, he carefully laid down. Harry could hear the man’s laboured breathing and hoped there wasn’t more serious internal injuries. Lucius was unable to see his friend, but sensed Albert was having difficulty maintaining his role in the conversation.
Those memories were a big point of contention among Runecraft and his cohorts. They kept asking him if he truly provided a memory of some event from that night but were vague describing it. Harry figured they probably were trying to catch him in a lie. Harry eventually just kept answering those questions by stating that if Hale submitted it and said it Harry’s memory then it was. A wizard Harry vaguely remembered at his own trial had asked about a ‘suspicious’ spell Hermione had cast in a memory. Before Hale could jump in, another wizengamot member insisted that the children weren’t on trial and they ought to focus on Albert. While Harry was certain Hermione hadn’t been silently casting dark arts that night, he suddenly feared Runecraft or one of the others would try to use it against his friends.
“We’re not like that either. I don’t think Draco would want, er… he just never seemed interested in me in that way,” Harry answered and tried not to look at Lucius lest the man see exactly how impure his thoughts were about his son.
“I can’t always control it,” Harry admitted. “If I concentrate, like with the rocks, I can easily do the magic... but it also happens when I don’t intend to. Like with the light spell last night. I’d just thought that it needed to be brighter and suddenly we were blinded by light. I didn’t mean to cast the spell, it just happened because I
“Well, yeah. And everything you said about it sucks… but that’s for… for people like you and Sirius who shouldn’t have been placed there to begin with… but Harry, it
Harry didn’t know what to make for Mulciber as the only thing the man requested had been lube. Harry created another bottle as nothing better came to mind, but when he placed it next to Crabbe’s plant, it felt inadequate. Seeing them side by side, it also occurred to Harry that Crabbe would never be able to hide this gift. Harry morosely watched the cycle and worried that he would have to destroy all that work the second a guard walked down the hall. It was only after several times observing the flower return to a small seed that Harry considered adding some shrinking charms. Unfortunately, at a smaller size, the flower lost some of the details Harry had woven into the spells.
step. I know what you... what you did. I can’t actually picture you doing any of it, but I know what you must have done to create one,” Draco admitted. Harry carefully observed Draco and began to believe him. There was a certain amount of pain and disgust in his expression, even though he did not pull away from Harry. Harry felt relieved but also ashamed.
“Whether they believe you or not,” cut in Malfoy, “you’ll still have sympathy merely due to the fact that you are still a child.”
“Hot,” Harry panted, “and full.” The latter was a similar feeling to having eaten too much. Every time Harry escaped the Dursleys and was presented with one of Mrs. Weasley’s excellent meals, he couldn’t help but gorge himself. With Mrs. Weasley’s instance that he eat plenty, Harry would inevitably eat too much. Despite having done this a few times, the opportunity to eat as much and whatever he wanted meant he was doing his best Dudley impression. He immediately spent the following few hours regretting his life choices as his body rebelled against his too-full belly. He would moan until he finally digested enough to be comfortable again. Apparently eating a soul gave him the same feeling, except he doubted his body could digest it. “Too much,” Harry cried.
“Yeah,” Crabbe said. He turned towards Draco and Harry with a huge smile. Harry’s breath caught when Draco sent Crabbe an answering smile. He hadn’t seen Draco smile like that in months.
“Yes. She’s a fanatic. She wanted the orb so she’d impress Vol-sorry, You-Know-Who,” Harry answered.
Harry did not know enough about curses to follow Voldemort in how he went about protecting his horcruxes. There would be no point in trying to secretly pull that information from Voldemort like he had with how to make a horcrux. The man would know how to circumvent any security Harry put in place. He knew he could ask Hermione for help, or ask her to wear it, but frankly he didn’t want to. He couldn’t bring himself to explain what he’d done. He couldn’t lose her like he’d lost Ron. He didn’t want to see fear or disgust on her face every time she’d be forced to interact with him. Besides, he figured she’d be a terrible choice to carry his horcrux since she was always with him. He didn’t like thinking about it, but there was a good chance she’d be captured or killed with him.
Flitwick was similarly concerned about Harry’s ability to catch up quickly on the missed classes. The charms lesson that day comprised of only a lecture, so Harry was unable to show some of his spellwork. Flitwick asked him to remain after class so he could explain what Harry had missed. He once again reassured his professor that he’d studied Hermione’s notes from those missed lessons. However, like McGonagall, this was not enough to reassure Flitwick. He offered to spend most of the lunch period reviewing the class content and answering questions. Harry was happy to agree as it meant he had an excuse to avoid the great hall and his gossip-hungry peers. Harry pretended to struggle with some spells to prolong how long his meeting with Flitwick went. Flitwick was patient with him, and ultimately declared he was happy with Harry’s progress.
“No, I don’t hate you, Potter,” Draco said gently. He untangled his hand from Harry’s strands, and brought it down to wipe at the new tear tracks.
“I requested the right to collect the memory, but nothing held Harry to providing it,” Hale responded.
Harry clenched his jaw but didn’t respond. He couldn’t exactly be happy with Dumbledore’s decision because it meant that all of his professors would now watch him closely and wait for him to screw up.
Successfully pulled out of his funk, Harry concentrated on keeping the water warm. It wasn’t until Lucius finished washing up and still had time to bask in the warmth that he realized Harry was once again using his wandless magic to make them all more comfortable.
Harry spent the morning reviewing and learning new transfiguration spells. He was enjoying these lessons immensely. He didn’t mean to be disloyal to McGonagall, but Lucius had inspired him to take the subject more seriously. It helped that Harry had a clear view of the man so any demonstrations he did never had to filter through the other prisoners first. There was a fluidity to these lessons that Harry found somewhat lacking in the other subjects.
Hours later, they comfortably snuggled with Draco’s head resting on Harry’s chest. Harry considered opening the champagne Draco had left beside the bed, but didn’t want to move. Draco was equally disinclined as it would mean letting go of Harry’s hand, and he wasn’t finished admiring the ring it now displayed.
“Sounds like a lot of work,” Zabini said. Harry blinked at the reminder that they weren’t the only two in the hallway.
“I understand the theory. It’s... it’s brilliant,” Draco said. Harry felt a surge of pride at his words. “I just don’t get how you pulled it off.”
“Careful not to smudge that with lube later tonight,” Mulciber said to break the tension. The two men snarked at each other, but it held no real heat.
“You seem to come out of it unmolested. I feared that a bunch of criminals who haven’t gotten off in ages would not be able to resist a tasty morsel like you,” Burke stated crudely. Despite his words, Harry could tell the man was more disappointed than worried.
“Shhh, dear,” Mrs. Weasley said and ran a soothing hand up and down his back. “It’s not your fault.”
Harry realized no towel would be provided as he walked pass the entryway leading back to the changing room. Instead a blast of too-hot air surrounded him. Almost instantly the water on his person evaporated. It felt similar to one of those muggle hand dryers, but much more efficient. When Harry reluctantly moved one hand from his groin to touch his hair, he noticed it was dry too.
“What are you doing here?” Stan asked. Since he wasn’t yet fully dressed, Harry got a good look at his forearm. There was no dark mark.
Harry quickly fell into a routine. Lucius would start their morning with a pop quiz. If Harry remembered a spell that he had covered earlier in the year, he would tell them so they could review the theory and practice the wand movements. Similarly, if Harry remembered a potion he had worked on, or a magical creature he covered in class, that would be reviewed before any new content was covered. Most of the day was spent on Harry’s lessons. Harry would call it a day when he started to feel overwhelmed. His tutors usually respected this, but occasionally Lucius or Albert would push him to keep going. Harry wondered if their sons felt just as much pressure to live up to their expectations.
“You think so, don’t you?” laughed Burke. “He won’t be able to get you out any time soon. No, you’re all ours for the time being.”
“Right...” Harry acknowledged Draco’s plan, but was worried about following through. He’d waited years to have proof of his greatest fear, but now that it might be within his reach, he was scared to find out.
“I anticipate that the ministry will try to stall as much as they can. I don’t know the goal, but you seem to be a pawn in a tug of war they’re having with Dumbledore. But I am more than happy to point this out to the public and let it blow up in their faces,” Hale explained. “By the time you go to trial, convicting you will be a career-ending move to whoever is stubborn enough to try.”
Holding Harry in place with one hand on his hair and the other on his chin, Burke leaned forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s. The boy’s eyes widened. He would have pulled back, but he had nowhere to go. He tried to turn his head, not caring if Burke pulled out his hair in the process, but Burke dug his fingers into Harry’s chin and nipped at Harry’s bottom lip in retaliation. In desperation, Harry struggled beneath him to free an arm, and when that didn’t work, he could do nothing more than sob helplessly. Burke chuckled against his lips.
“Snape might not,” Harry said darkly. He’d felt the man’s eyes on him all supper. Harry knew he’d have to avoid making eye contact with Snape as well.
“Where is Mr. Longbottom, Miss Lovegood, and Miss Weasley?” Runecraft asked. The professors raised new protests, especially when they noticed how tightly Bole was holding on to Hermione’s arm. Neville had stood up on his own and was making his way towards the aurors. Harry wasn’t sure where Luna and Ginny were. He didn’t have time to look around either as one of the aurors nodded to Perkins and the man started leading Harry out of the great hall.
Harry felt he should resolve to stop using wandless magic, but that seemed impossible. Even if he could grow accustomed to the uncomfortable feeling of having an extra soul in him, he couldn’t stop being a wizard. If he was ever released, he’d go back to Hogwarts and would cast multiple times a day. It wasn’t like he could explain why he couldn’t do the practical portion of his classes. McGonagall wouldn’t stand for it, and Snape would demand he be expelled if Harry insisted on living like a muggle. Harry couldn’t go back to living with the Dursleys fulltime. He just would not. In some ways, being stuck in Azkaban was preferable.
“You do have a way of catching my son’s attention like no other,” Lucius said, smirking slightly. Harry’s blush deepened and he averted his eyes. Draco had a similar effect on Harry. Draco mostly inspired negative emotions, but Harry couldn’t deny that he paid more attention to him than any other student he had confrontations with. Zacharias Smith and Cormac McLaggen were prats, but Harry didn’t dwell on his encounters with them. Harry
“It’s a place to start,” Hale offered. Harry thanked him but was boggled by how Hale thought this was only the start. There was so much information on the scroll that Harry didn’t know how he’d address it all, let alone whatever else Hale thought he might need to look into.
“Well,” Burke frowned. “Perhaps if you’re good, I can arrange to let you into the showers early. You know, as an incentive.”
“Are you having us on?” asked Crabbe. The man was very confused by the concept. Harry didn’t blame him. It should be impossible.
By the time the conversation naturally died down, Harry felt marginally better. It helped that no one had suggested either killing Harry or handing him over to Voldemort. Harry couldn’t be sure that none of them were thinking it, but at least they were willing to entertain the possibility that the horcrux could be safely removed. He hoped Dumbledore was doing the same. Perhaps he didn’t tell Harry about the horcrux in him because he didn’t want to worry Harry until he had a solution.
The others looked surprised at Harry’s confession, but Goyle just nodded along and added “he really is.”
“Yes, I understand,” Draco reassured him. He raised his hand to thread through Harry’s hair and swept it back. Harry relaxed as Draco essentially pet him. “That’s... That is bad... That explains why he was so... unstable. I can’t imagine splitting your soul even once.”
“And would you like Albert’s judicial-wizard to represent you?” prompted Lucius. “He’s quite good at his job.”
Harry shivered as the temperature dropped the longer the ride went on. He could still make out enough of the auror’s faces to know that Perkins was giving him pitying looks while Bradley was scowling at him. Burke was still watching him intently. Harry wasn’t sure if he was imagining the man smirking at him or not.
Unaware that Asherath had spoken to Harry, Burke once again ordered him to leave. “I’ve got this,” he insisted. Annoyed that the dementor was ignoring his orders, Burke took his frustration out on Harry. When he turned back to the boy, he snarled and roughly yanked down Harry’s trousers and pants in one go.
Harry found both books interesting, though they were a little above Harry’s very beginner knowledge on the subject. He needed Nott to explain a good portion of what he read, but they couldn’t speak about it while surrounded by other students. Harry’s progress was also hindered by his regular classes.
Harry found out that Draco’s mother had bought him dragon footy pajamas afterall. Being the spoiled brat that he is, Draco had pulled a tantrum because he wanted puffskein pajamas instead. Narcissa had searched five stores the next day until she found a puffskein version. Draco had ended up wearing both sets until he outgrew them. Harry told himself that his appreciation for the story was because he could now tease Draco about his love for puffskeins. It had nothing to do with how endearing he assumed a young Draco looked in footy pajamas.
“Recon that’ll make the papers,” Ron said. Harry groaned in response. After a moment, Ron joined in with his own. “Guess this means we’re pretty much living in the library for the rest of the year. It’s Hermione’s dream come true.”
“Yes?” Harry said, though he could understand why she was concerned. He and Draco did not have a great history, so he wasn’t surprised when she just scoffed in response.
“Hear that, Potter? If you ever wanted to see someone in their skivvies, now’s your chance!” laughed Mulciber.
“It’s an honour to be cho-“ Lestrange started to say from the cell next to Harry but Malfoy interrupted.
, but still appreciated the offer of support. Perhaps his headmaster was already looking into safely removing the horcrux.
“Right, so,” Harry glanced around again to make sure no one was obviously paying attention to them. Once he was satisfied, he placed the miniature box on the table and said “stag.”
“I don’t...” He had been about to say that he didn’t want people to know. Unlike with Umbridge, it wasn’t under a false assumption that it would somehow let Burke win. But it was still too new. Harry was embarrassed by it. He didn’t want to acknowledge it. If he let Nott tell his judicial-wizard, it would be in the papers and everyone would know. If he ever got out, people would look for it almost as much, if not more, than they looked for his scar.
“Ok, but you can punish them without… without taking everything. I’m not saying we should turn each cell into some sort of… luxury hotel, but do they have to do anything they can to make sure we’re miserable?” Harry asked.
All in all, he made little progress with the mirror that day. In Charms, they learnt a spell that could link several brooms so that a wizard could send them out to clean his house and call them all back with a single tap to the location where they’d be stored. It wasn’t exactly the spell Harry needed, but it gave him an opportunity to ask Flitwick some questions about connecting objects. Flitwick emphasized there was a maximum distance before the spell broke down, but also hinted there were ways to increase that distance with what he called
“Harry. Harry, you listen to me,” Ginny said and turned his face back towards her, “you’re coming back to me. You’re going to stop him, and then you’re coming back to me. I can let you go – run off to do whatever it is you’re doing, but that’s because I know you’re
“So...” Zabini eventually broke the silence. He looked inexplicably exasperated when Harry turned his attention to him. He was looking between Harry and Draco as if he expected one of them to fill in the awkward silence. When neither did, he rolled his eyes and stated, “I noticed you weren’t in Defense today.”
“I’ve known... almost since the beginning. You know I’ve been ordering books internationally? Some countries aren’t as restrictive and openly study soul magic. I found the ritual in one of the texts I bought,” Draco explained.
“Ah,” was Hale’s response and he stopped frowning at their audience. He carefully tucked away Harry’s memories and the written statements. He handed Harry the two forms he’d mentioned and waved a third scroll of parchment in the direction of the castle.
Mulciber’s bottle of lube started off no taller than an inch high. If pressed on the bottom while saying the word “Celestina”, the bottle would grow larger. As a last-minute decision, Harry made the larger version oversized. It felt like a gag gift, but Harry thought Mulciber would find it hilarious... and practical.
something. Something real. If you’re going to arrest someone for being a death eater, maybe make sure they really are a death eater. And take a closer look at your employees. Get rid of the ones that-”
“What are you doing?” Harry asked, suddenly worried for Albert. Burke snarled at Harry. It took him a moment to fully register Harry’s concern, but when he did, Burke relaxed enough to send a nasty smirk his way.
Harry tried to glance down but couldn’t see the area that was in pain. Noticing this, Burke summoned a mirror that was at the back of the room. Burke arranged it so Harry could watch as he worked. Before Burke returned to his task, Harry was able to see a black line on his neck.
“Right,” Draco said, and took a deep breath. He relaxed when Harry wrapped his arms around him. “Right. I thought I would show you mine first. I’m not exactly a saint. I’ve done things that, well, you know. Still, my soul should theoretically represent a normal, healthy adult’s soul.”
“Yes,” Harry said after a slight pause. He hoped everyone interpreted his reluctance in relation to the subject and not his own guilt.
“Can you not do it yourself?” the dementor asked. At the sound of its voice, Harry recognized the dementor as Asherath. Harry looked at him pleadingly, hoping the dementor had grown fond of him enough to want to help.
“I save the articles... you might want to avoid reading a couple of them, but most were on your side,” Hermione said.
“I still made choices. Choices that hurt someone,” Draco said. Harry wanted to insist that Draco wouldn’t have done it if his family wasn’t in danger. But he knew Draco would still feel bad about every spell. Mostly because if given the same horrible choice now, he’d still choose to keep his family safe at the expense of another.
“It’s no problem. Really,” Harry reassured him. He honestly didn’t know how Hale would make it work, but a large part of Harry hoped it was successful. Death Eater or not, Albert was his friend and Harry had no desire to keep in him Azkaban.
“The papers spent all of last year calling me a delusional attention-seeker. I’m not sure the public will care what the ministry does to me,” Harry said. He moved towards his mattress and sat down on the bed. He suddenly felt tired after finishing his rant about how he came to be here. The fact that someone was finally pointing out how stupid this whole thing was, was also allowing him to cautiously relax. If one person was able to see how unfair it was, perhaps others would too. Albert’s suggestion that the public would be on his side was raising Harry’s hopes despite the fact that he had just expressed his own doubt.
Finally having enough, Burke reached for Harry’s neck and squeezed. Harry choked as his air supply was completely cut off in Burke’s strong grip. Desperately Harry swiped his nails across Burke’s face but only succeed in making the man angrier. Harry tried to pry Burke’s hand from his neck, but he had no strength left.
Surprisingly, despite the threats, their conversation had cleared the air enough that the dinners were no longer tense affairs. Both Lucius and Harry participated more in the conversation, and even spoke civilly towards each other. By the time Andromeda was ready to invite her sister’s husband into her home, Harry was prepared and willing to attend and support her. There were plenty of uneasy moments, but it helped that Lucius was kind to both Teddy and James, despite his feelings about both boys’ parentage.
“Are you about to ask me to transfigure you some parchment so you can give me alchemy worksheets?” Harry asked. He was constantly amused at how each of these men thought the subject they were teaching him was more valuable than the others.
“An understandable reaction. An exaggerated one that many of us might use when hearing such a story. If anyone here says they don’t want retribution, they are either lying or heartless,” Hale boldly stated. Despite how uncomfortable Harry felt, he relaxed as Hale brought the topic back in the direction Harry was aiming for when he decided to share.
Burke led Harry towards the bars. As they neared them, the bars moved aside allowing them to pass. Harry was pretty sure it was not as easy to leave as it was to enter. As they moved away from Anton’s office, the halls grew dim again. There were torches lining the way at regular intervals, but it was very mild light that guided them. Harry stumbled often and Burke pulled him closer every time.
“Hmmm... yes, I remember all those pranks you pulled. Generally, at my expense,” Harry said to try and lighten the mood.
He started simple. He transfigured the rock into a pot, and then filled the pot with soil. He weaved transfigured rocks into something resembling a flower. All in all, it was a decent looking fake plant, but Harry wasn’t satisfied. It was something he could have easily made in his third year. He knew Crabbe would be happy with the gesture, but he wanted to give the man something that properly expressed his gratitude. And the little boy that had been starved for affection from the Dursleys wanted to show that he is worth all of the effort they put into teaching him.
“Ah, yes. I had hoped to get Rufus to see reason,” Dumbledore explained. “Alas, retiring from the aurors has not made him any less stubborn.”
There had also been a smaller article that mentioned Harry had been called to testify in Albert’s trial. Naturally Hermione had seen it and brought it to Ron and Neville’s attention. Having no choice but to address it, Harry confirmed it as he got a letter from Hale that morning telling him he would be needed at the ministry tomorrow.
“Since when do you need permission to do something?” asked Malfoy. “The way Draco tells it, you’ve broken every school rule there is.”
“No, but I used it in my sixth year to get out of taking a transfiguration test I hadn’t studied for,” Crabbed reminisced with a laugh.
“You can’t – We were told – you have to make a formal request to see each prisoner. The request must detail your exact purpose of the meeting, and nothing else shall be discussed or provided that is not officially approved,” the guard stated.
,” one of the creatures murmured which terrified Harry. It couldn’t be a good thing that they found him interesting even if it sparred him the horrible memories.
“You know it’s his dream come- Potter!” Zabini cut himself off when he noticed Harry had rejoined them.
am. I show you what you are – a sickness,” Burke accentuated his point by harshly pulling Harry’s hair before continuing, “a blight on society,” his other hand grabbed Harry’s chin and held him still with a bruising grip, “a disgusting worm that should be grinned against my heel. You have no power here, Potter.”
“Some, maybe,” Harry conceded because he knew better than any of them what muggles who feared wizards were capable of. Harry was pretty sure that the Dursleys were unhappy they couldn’t pawn Harry off on a priest and be done with him. “But there are many more that are decent people,” he insisted. Hermione’s parents would never just stand by if someone tried to burn or drown her just for being a witch.
Harry’s pleasure didn’t stem from stealing Burke’s happiness for his own sustenance. Rather, it had to do with feeling his magic thrum under his skin again. It was knowing that he had stopped Burke from violating him further. It was his decision to keep going until he plucked the man’s soul out of his body so that he couldn’t hurt anyone ever again. Decision made, Harry sat up and got to work.
“...I can’t say,” Harry said awkwardly as he gave Parkinson and Zabini warry looks. He hoped his answer didn’t cause Draco to storm off in anger.
“That’s because he has the good sense not to like you,” Lucius bantered. There was no real heat behind either of the men’s words.
“Don’t worry, Potts. I’ll take care of those muggles for you,” Mulciber offered. Harry couldn’t see him, but he could picture the bloodthirsty look on his face. Despite the genuine offer of bodily harm, possibly even murder, Harry couldn’t help but smile in response. He’d missed the man. He missed all of them.
Harry stared at Asherath in horror, as he realized the significance of what the dementor was telling him.
Harry blinked. He was surprised by the first overt show of support, especially since it was coming from a Death Eater. Someone Harry assumed was a Death Eater anyway.
After they were returned to their cells, Albert thanked them and went to lay down again. The others went back to conversing as quietly as they could. They felt it was getting too late to continue with lessons, so the men quietly told him about their lives before Azkaban. Harry tried not to but he felt some pity for the Lestrange brothers. Most of their stories were about their teen years or early 20s. The majority of their adult lives were wasted in Azkaban. The only ‘happy’ story Rodolphus shared of his later years was when he was briefly reunited with his wife. He still thought she was as beautiful as always. Harry would have found it a sweet story had it been about anyone else. Anger still boiled in him when he thought about Bellatrix, but Harry was slowly warming up to Rodolphus. Harry found he had to constantly remind himself of what the man did to Neville’s family in order to keep an emotional distance.
“Let’s go,” Burke pushed Albert out of the cell. Harry fearfully looked between the two. He remembered all too clearly what happened to him the last time Burke dragged him out of his cell. Whatever Burke planned was likely to be painful and humiliating for Albert.
Harry and Draco exchanged a glance, before they both moved to follow him. Harry purposely walked slow hoping they wouldn’t catch up to Theo so that he’d be able to speak to Draco for a bit longer.
Harry blinked a few times in stunned silence, before he leaned towards Hale. “Is he fucking me with?” Harry asked in genuine uncertainty. His voice was low but given the near silence of the courtroom, his question travelled rather far.
“But... by now I can tell when you’re angry or hurt. I’ve been the cause of those feelings many times over the years. You hide it well – the hurt, I mean. You’re shit at hiding your anger... So, I’ve noticed...” Draco paused and watched Harry for a moment before he decided to finish stating his observations. “You’re either angry or hurt all the time. You do smile and relax, but it’s rare... and it’s easier for you to be happy around Teddy than it is for you to be with James.”
“I’m not sure you should keep hiding it,” Draco said. He raised one hand to Harry’s face and wiped the tears from his cheek. “If it’s causing you this much pain, you should speak to someone. It doesn’t have to be me, but you need to let it out.”
“I can’t believe you’re actually going to read up on ancient runes for fun,” Ron said after Hermione promised to look for her old notes once they got back to the common room. In the meantime, she gave him a couple of book titles he could find while they were in the library. Harry just shrugged at Ron and didn’t bother explaining he didn’t want to let a bunch of Death Eaters down by slacking and letting their efforts go to waste.
“You’re absolutely gorgeous,” Draco said as leaned in for one last kiss. He knew they couldn’t linger much longer before they were missed, but he couldn’t resist.
He wasn’t sure when it happened, but somewhere along the way Harry had fallen hard for Draco. It didn’t help that Draco was so good with James. He was certainly a better role model than Harry was. Draco was so patient with James too. Whenever he watched them together, it made Harry want Draco even more. He feared it was completely obvious that he perked up just as much as James did whenever Draco walked into the room.
“I’m sure he wouldn’t mind if I softened him up for him,” replied Jugson, though he looked worried. “He’d reward me.”
“Crabbe is usually in the top ten highest herbology scores each year,” Neville explained. Harry didn’t know how Neville knew that.
“I don’t know,” Harry answered honestly. He really had no idea what the dementor was talking about. He hadn’t even known that the creatures could talk. They’d always been particularly interested in him, but they had never bothered to stop and talk before. Harry considered that it might be the most terrifying thing about this place yet.
Also, I’m not sure when Slughorn told Harry about that fish. If it wasn’t supposed to have happened yet, let’s just pretend it had for the sake of the plot. He doesn’t resist the idea of blood magic because he assumes his mother was proficient at it. Which I think was likely. With a best friend like Severus Snape, she probably knew all sorts of things a “good” witch shouldn’t know.
Harry let out a disgusted noised and turned his head away from the man. It gave Scrimgeour just the right angle to see the edge of Harry’s new tattoo peaking over the collar of his shirt. The minister let out a shocked gasp. Although suddenly embarrassed and ashamed, Harry took it as a sign that Burke’s actions were not ministry approved. He hoped it was enough to get Burke fired, but considering Umbridge still had her job, Harry wasn’t going to hold his breath.
“Do you know Hale’s strategy?” he asked. When Theo shook his head negatively, Harry began explaining what happened with the testimonies and how Harry thought it fit into Hale’s overall reframing of that night’s events. When he got to the part where he spoke about the Dursleys, he tried to gloss over it.
Poor Pansy. Since I’m denying the Harry of this universe the opportunity to experience the absolute gold that is the whole Roonil scene with Snape, he got to have his snarky moment at Pansy’s expense. ‘I know who Theo is’ was kind of close, ehehehe.
“Has there been more... incidents with your uncle like the one you described?” ask the witch sitting next to Bones.
Harry wanted to argue that he had not cancelled it but rather that the cruse had not worked for him. He held his tongue though knowing that he’d only be digging his own grave if he spoke right now. But the temptation to speak in his defense was strong so instead he turned away from the ministry workers. That left him once again looking towards the student body. His eyes landed on Malfoy out of habit, having spent the majority of the year so far observing the slytherin and trying to figure out what he was up to. Unlike the rest of the year, it seemed like he finally had Malfoy’s full attention. Too bad Harry couldn’t be happy about it at the moment.
“You’re letting Harry copy them,” Ron muttered as he tried to read Hermione’s charms notes over Harry’s shoulder.
“Well, it would get around whatever paperwork they send our way. But conducting a trial without the accused would set a dangerous precedent. Especially when the accused is being illegally imprisoned in Azkaban. It would be an additional violation against your rights,” Hale explained.
McGonagall didn't say anything when Harry sat down but slowly reached for his hand. When Harry didn't object, she gripped him tight. Harry watched her from the corner of his eye and felt guilty for the sad expression he knew he put there.
Lucius once again complained that the water turned cold far too fast. The man was used to indulging in long hot showers, so Azkaban’s accommodations would never compare. Harry was almost thankful that it hadn’t lasted any longer, because he had noticed that Rodolphus was indulging in a little self-love and that was something Harry didn’t need to stick around to hear.
” asked another. Much like their looks, their voices sounded alike. However, there was a minute difference that informed Harry that different creatures were speaking.
Scrimgeour gestured at the guard that had led him to Harry’s cell. The man seemed reluctant to leave, but eventually did so. Scrimgeour glanced at the nearby cells and seemed unhappy that he couldn’t dismiss the other prisoners.
Once the prisoners had made themselves depressed about their situation, it was hard to move forward with Harry’s afternoon lessons. Albert was supposed to have led them, but everyone wanted to give the man time to heal instead. Harry quietly talked to Lucius as Mulciber and the Lestranges brainstormed last minute spells that might interest Harry. Lucius periodically asked for updates on Albert’s status, but Harry couldn’t tell much as the man remained lying down. Harry hoped he had managed to fall asleep.
“But I did mean it at the time. I really wanted to hurt her for killing Sirius,” Harry admitted. “It was actually frustrating that it didn’t work.”
There was a short argument over which one of the men would be stuck pulling up Burke’s pants. When one guard reluctantly agreed to do it and turned Burke over, Burke’s cock was put on display for everyone to see. Harry had to look away. His eyes landed on Burke’s forgotten wand. That inner Hermione was urging him to leave it be, while his inner Ron suggested he ought to hide the wand before the guards noticed it. His magic still felt easily accessible, so he decided to chance it. Once his brain felt the danger had passed, it was likely he wouldn’t be able to purposely access his magic wandlessly. Having a wand would protect him in case one of the guards decided to finish what Burke started.
“I had to be sure. I needed to be able to come back if I died. I was supposed to be the only one who could kill him. But I died. His horcruxes were destroyed. Neville killed him, so I wasn’t needed anymore, but it was too late. I came back too late, and no one knew they had to save Ginny,” Harry said.
“McGonagall did find a reporter that somehow managed to sneak into the school. She had to escort him out, but she didn’t stop him from asking students questions along the way,” Neville recalled and added that McGonagall had walked slowly to ensure that many students had the opportunity to complain about Dolores Umbridge.
“Remind me again what the incantation for that is?” asked Nott. Both Nott and Malfoy had been watching Harry closely. Every time Harry showed a particular interest in (or revulsion to) the suggested curse or hex, one man would prompt the other for the incantation. The other man would provide it and follow up with demonstration of the correct wand movement.
Harry knew it was too much to hope that Burke would be too embarrassed to ever return. Yet it still managed to surprise him when Burke stormed towards their cells. He didn’t expect the amount of anger Burke was displaying. It was a sharp contrast to the mood that the prisoners had been in just before.
“It is something that should be decided upon before marriage,” Lucius insisted. He suspected Draco was going to change the subject, so he continued before anyone else could speak. “Harry already has an heir. You ought to have one too.”
“That dementor did more for me than any of the guards ever did,” Harry said. It was similar to the statement he made about his fellow prisoners and ministry, but if anyone noticed that, it was drowned out by the shocked gasps that went through the room.
“Up to a week if you’ve really pissed them off,” explained Malfoy. Harry made a disgusted face but Malfoy seemed pleased that Harry shared his outrage.
“Good, good. This will save us some time searching for you. Auror Bole has some questions for you about your involvement in the ministry break-in last June,” Runecraft stated. The auror on the far left turned his attention on Hermione. He didn’t look as reluctant to be there as Auror Perkins did.
Except something went wrong. It had taken him months to wake up, and in the meantime, Neville had been burdened with the responsibility of vanquishing Voldemort. And Ginny, his beautiful Ginny had died in childbirth. It didn’t feel real, and Harry held on to the hope that the medi-witch had been mistaken up until the point the Weasleys arrived at the hospital.
Harry got up after he realized he only had two class periods to go about the castle uninterrupted. He grabbed the first sweater and pair of jeans he found, but instead of just changing out of his formal robes, he opted to take a shower first. He might have had one that morning, but he relished the thought of being alone for a change. He didn’t need to charm the water to remain warm, but he still used his wandless magic to make his soap and shampoo levitate around him. It was a relief to let out some magic and consequently the pressure of Burke’s soul. He hadn’t been able to do anything magical since his first shower, and the pressure had been slowly building.
“Harry, dear, you know what happened to Ginevra was not your fault,” Narcissa said. She’d known him long enough to know he carried the weight of her death. Despite her words, she also knew Harry had yet to believe anyone who told him it wasn’t his fault.
“Fresh meat, huh?” the man commented but he barely spared Harry a glance before he moved towards the door. “You best hurry. The dementors are about to do their rounds.”
“Oh, I’ll leave. Since I can do that. I can leave whenever I want. I’m a free man, unlike you who isn’t getting out of here. Ever,” Burke remarked as he left his spot near Harry’s cell and joined his coworkers. Harry stewed in his anger as he listened to Burke’s footsteps move down the hall. Harry stared blankly at where Burke had stood, imagining what could have happened if he’d been able to do wandless magic. It was only when the hallway door closed behind the guards that Harry snapped out of it.
They met in the forbidden forest; risky even without factoring the Death Eaters at the school. Harry tried to make the area as pleasant as possible; he set out a blanket, cast heating charms, and most importantly, properly bathed despite being on the run.
Harry’s trek to the library was derailed when he spotted a surprisingly familiar face in Hogwarts’ halls.
Eventually, the questions died down as they realized Hale was twisting their words. Madame Bones was able to move on and call a vote. Harry didn’t know how it would turn out given he hadn’t been present for the trial. Hale ran circles around the wizengamot members today, but Harry had no way of knowing if that had been the tone throughout the trial. He held his breath as he watched the wizengamot vote on his fate. A significant number voted against him, but the majority voted to acquit him. Harry made a soft, relieved noise when the vote was official and the chains holding him fell idle beside him.
“Yeah, he... likes you,” Draco said. Harry wanted to ask what exactly Lucius had said, but the blush that formed on Draco’s cheeks stopped him. Almost crying aside, the conversation was going remarkably well considering their history. Harry didn’t want to push and ruin it. He was happy enough to assume Lucius had written good things if Draco’s impression was that his dad liked him.
“No,” Harry once again answered truthfully. This time, Bones frowned. She’d probably hoped for some cellblock confessions, but Harry and the other prisoners had been careful about mentioning the whole Death Eater business. They hadn’t ignore it – they couldn’t – but they saw no reason to dwell on it either.
“Mr. Potter, have you seen the Dark Mark on Mr. Nott?” asked Bones in a calm manner that strongly contrasted Runecraft’s harsh approach.
Harry hesitated, not sure if he really wanted to talk to these men, but he wasn’t sure how long he would be stuck here. It was going to be a long stay if he didn’t talk to anyone.
Harry wasn’t surprised to be brought to courtroom ten; the same one used in his last trial. He didn’t know if he should interpret it as a good omen or not. That courtroom was reserved for the more serious crimes, but the last time Harry had been tried there he got off. Unfortunately, Harry recognized some of the same witches and wizards presiding over the trial who had not been on his side back then. The only upside was that neither Fudge nor Umbridge were present.
When supper arrived without Albert rising from his bed, Harry’s concern slipped from Draco and back towards the beaten man. It was only as Harry was lying down for the night that he realized neither of them had been called for a meeting with Hale despite be given the opportunity to shower.
“So, it’s actually more effective when cast on a seeing-aid device. Well, it isn’t as strong, which ironically makes it more effective,” concluded Lestrange after Mulciber finished his cautionary tale.
“I accidentally revealed something personal that I had no intention of sharing,” Harry said. Theo raised an eyebrow at Harry’s vague answer so Harry quickly moved on with his recap.
“That sounds like a reasonable trade,” Harry said as he tried to quickly move the conversation along before Ron or Hermione could ask more questions. At Harry’s acceptance, Nott started pulling out his own school supplies.
All three of them watched Jugson walk away. Harry would have been relieved if it didn’t mean he got a good look at the man’s hairy arse. Even without his glasses, Harry could tell it was an unpleasant sight.
A few quick incantations ensured that Harry’s skin was clean, his shirt was no longer stuck to the side, and the chains unravelled. The tattoo area felt a little tingly, but before Harry could feel it for himself, Burke heaved Harry up as Wiblin put away the boxes. Harry felt unsteady and couldn’t move away from Burke as he spelled Harry’s hands behind him again.
As the others continued to tease Lestrange, Harry noted that Malfoy seemed to be calming down. He did not join in the conversation, but he no longer seemed to be breaking down. Harry thought he understood why Lestrange and Nott had started the conversation, but Harry probably would have preferred if someone had first acknowledged how crappy everything was. Still, Harry started talking about the recent matches he’s read about in the papers. He even spoke about the recent Hogwarts quidditch games, though he skipped over his own recent injury.
