“Where is the Lovegood girl?” I ask to whomever wants to give me the answer.
A smile appeared on his lips, as he saw the little Muggle children laughing and dancing to the rhythm of a sound that came from someone else's fingers. Innocent eyes and childish features, rejoicing to the beat of the music.
Ron looks at me and I immediately know he has something to say.
“That’s so screw up,” Ron says, shaking his head once. “And I want to remind you both that this is an Auror/Collab mission,” he says, straightening his pose.
And when I open my eyes, Dray and Nesha are looking at each other with understanding.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Tell Daddy we love him," Scorpius tells me, squeezing his twin's hand. James nods and pulls Scorpius back as his little hand gets covered in Floo powder.
I am starting to think Draco's smugness is not a Malfoy trait, but a Black one, because Teddy is a Black and he is as smug as Draco was when we were at Hogwarts.
"Don't touch it like that, Ronald," Hermione tells him, who immediately reaches up to take the object from Ron's hands. “Besides, that's new. Hardly formed yesterday."
"People who were victims of certain... More horrendous circles also come to do therapy here," she tells me and immediately my mind takes me to the West case. Human trafficking, when found they are in very deplorable conditions. Some are not even able to stand on their own. "So we try that everyone can feel safe here."
“I am,” Pansy says out loud, standing proud beside her soulmate.
"What did your Occa call you?" I ask him in a hiss.
"What wing are we in?" Harry asks me, as we start to get out of the elevator.
“Yes, Redfern” Iris’ mother says. “He can stay in the shelter.”
My movements are slow, as my own brain tries to remember everything we have learned this week. But then again... The geniuses in the room are Draco and Hermione, and yet Hermione has no photographic memory.
, I remind myself.
I watch him stuff the chocolate frog into his mouth and chew, as he gently nods.
“Are you going to keep up this nonsense, Draco?” she asks to me, arching a beautiful blond eyebrow. Her eyes are searching inside my soul and I slam the ward of my Occlumency back in place.
“Mione,” I call her.
“You listened to the minister, gentlemen,” says Robards. “You will assist the Unspeakables in finishing wrapping up the Narcissa Black case. Now that there is a paint with her in it, the most appropriate thing will be… Take it as a witness”.
I smile at the girl and separate my hand from Harry's to extend it to her.
He's as nosy as Hermione and Draco, and that makes me laugh softly.
"Could you take me to the spectator room?" I ask her, resting my hands on the large desk.
And as sure as hell we will. Parkinson is not one you know for her calmness, but for her viciousness. And I... I sure as hell am ready to chocke to death whomever has dare to harm my better half, even if he refused to go out with me. I don't care, I still love him and I still want to hurt whoever hurt him first.
“It isn’t,” I say to him. “But he is a half-blood and he was raised in the non-magical side of the UK world.”
“I'm not a babe to be held like this,” I tell him, but still, I hide my head against his chest. "I feel miserable."
"Even if 22 years ago they didn't find the body, the blood is good enought to know. That blood might be from Draco Black," says Neekeal. "He can be a 95% dead if these results tell us anything." Says the woman with almost white hair and black robes. "No baby can live without half the blood in its body," says Neekeal. "Let alone a baby wizard. Hitted with a speel like the AK, his body will desintegrate and become magic, since he was from magic. Babies made the most accidental magic because they are still from magic, more then anyone of us."
I smile at him.
HARRY
“What did Moody find?” I ask him.
“Since when has been this development, Auror Potter?” Robards asks, his eyes analyzing me.
Enough.
"Hey!" I say with mock anger, while I watch my two children putting their little hands in the bowl to eat my dough. "No more dough for any of you. You can have a piece of this when everything is ready.”
"Just a magical high in alcohol beverage," I tell him. "And yes, it was against the rules."
"I'm real," I tell him, placing my hand over his.
"Not because he wanted to," Moody says. "Dumbledore has this little cottage in the skirts of Bellebound, in the French Wizarding Society. He is a Dumbledore, after all."
However, I'm not quite sure that Hermione is right about what she's saying. It doesn't feel like it works like this ... Whatever this is, it feels more like I'm having a conversation with Narcissa Black then anything else.
“Do you remember the first time you made paint the living room walls?” I ask him, looking to the bright net that is his brain. Nothing happens. Why? “I remember you not being happy about Kreacher but you were smiling, your face had little spots of paint here,” I touch his cheeks.
Hannah nods.
"Ginny," Harry's voice makes us all turn.
This chapter is the longest in the history alright. It is +3000 words.
“He had a sister, Arabella.” Hermione says. "She died and took their mother to the grave with her."
I leave the store feeling lighter, while a smile falls on my lips.
The reporters return to focus their gaze on my children and although I want to feel relief, I cannot. No one has taught twins how to lie and that's partly because they know they don't need it.
. 'Mione's voice echoes in my head and I smile as I walk over to the young man all the kids call Drake. I feel the nerves take over me and I try to breathe more calmly.
The first thing that occurs inside of my head when I walk into the little muggle coffee shop is that the blond that is always in my thoughts doesn't look good today. His eyes are dim, when they always seem to shine even for the smallest thing.
"Draco," I hear mother's voice again and I know I fell asleep again. "My Dragon, Luna is waiting for you," she combs her hand through my hair. "I know you are tired, but let’s meet Luna. She has been waiting for you for a while."
I say to myself.
“We were together before the assault against Potion Master Malfoy,” I say to him, trying to keep myself in check.
The nurse on duty makes love sounds and other cheesy things as she guides Harry to the elevator. And once the doors close, Harry's hands hit me against the jet's body.
"We will be back, possibly with Teddy and the twins," I say to the others, as I move Molly somewhere. And everything else happens so fast that I don't even notice when I get to the room where Draco is now.
"May l?" I ask him, showing him the highest quality fabric in an intense blue color. And the only response I get is a slight nod and then Dray's eyes close.
“I know, although sometimes I forget too,” and I kiss his white hair and then separate it from me. “Now, I need you to learn so that you can be safe. Okay?"
Ugh. I feel my stomach recoiling. How did we missed this?
"Take him in your arms and sit with him on the ground, where the moonlight can bathe the both of you," the woman tells me, I turn to look and ask, however, there is no one else in this room. "Your magic will guide you, Harry Potter."
And all of the other raises with a hand movement form the Dark Lord. Once the chamber is empty, just Voldemort, Dray and I are here.
I conjure the image with which our children defined our relationship last year. A huge, plump, three horned white dragon that wears a handkerchief in his neck and has a thunder-shaped scar on its forehead.
It is a short chap but here it is... Update! Hope you enjoy it!
He immediately looks up, his grey eyes brewing a storm inside them. And then, he is walking up to me and I can see a few scratches in his face.
“Surprise,” I say, extending the letter, towards Robards and Hermione for their inspection.
I pass my hand over my face.
January 1st, 2003
Suddenly the rhythm of Harry and Nesha's hisses makes me think of Rachmaninoff and I hear the G major sonata inside my head. The fingers of my hand move over the wooden floor, while my head accurately remembers each note of both the cello and the accompanying piano.
My twin of evil hadn’t made an appearance since a few months ago. Now, I have to deal with his needs as well. He is too fucking aware of Draco being our mate and that shit… My own evil twin is not fucking me.
I fill my head with Umbridge images and feel the excitement leave my body.
"Everything is going to be ok, love," I whisper against his cheek. "Everything is gonna be ok."
What if Dray is a wizard too? What if he's a pureblood and a follower of Voldemort?
"Open your mouth for me, Dray," and Dray obediently opens his mouth, trying to override his own desire to raise his hand to touch me. "I promise you it tastes good." This is Daffodil nectar and once my fingers are inside Dray's warm mouth, the blonde closes it. "Suck it, love."
“Bellatrix Lestrange," I whispered, remembering the person who almost killed Sirius Black.
I shrug, because I am not about to tell her Malfoy might have substituted her with Luna Lovegood of all people.
“You needed be there,” I assure him. “I can feel the change on your magic.”
I put that one on and pad out of the comfy room. The safety heaven Harry’s smell has to offers, because I still have a job to do.
And yet the one I see before even thinking about taking Dray towards the food is Rowle.
I reach for Dray, but my hand closes on nothing and I open my eyes to realize that I am completely alone in my bed. However, as I sit and look around the room I am convinced that Dray has not left. His clothes are still scattered on the floor of the room.
But, until a few days, Luna Lovegood and Pansy Parkinson were listed as his medical contacts. Something is not adding up.
Dray is red in the face with anger, his petit body trembling with pent up rage. His magic is all around his body, lashing out and maiming anyone who tries to get close to him.
"A very curious mind," he heard the voice of the sorting hat and turned my face to see Dray with the ancient hat on his head. "However, I can see your bravery and the love you have for people who show you sincerity," the hat seems to be thinking. "What's your name, little one?"
"You'll love it," he with seriously softness. "Maybe not so much the painting or the chairs," he smiles at me and I smile back. "But you're definitely going to like the food."
I feel how our bond contracts and becomes narrower and then it stretches and the feelings that I have inside travel through it and make it widder.
"There will be music, right?" Ron whispers, coming closer to us. Our bodies looking towards the entrance of the place. While the muggle girl put a green headband on his wrist.
Robards pale.
His magic is still tired. What have been my love doing?
I sigh and look at all of them.
Nonetheless, she keeps talking.
“I know where he is,” I say to her, trying to keep this information to myself. “I am just… Not sure if he is okay.”
Draco gives him a tight-lipped smile, as if he doesn't want to smile, but can't fight his own joy either.
Let me know what you think, guys. I appreciate it a lot whenever there are comments. I try to answer them, because I like for you to know I care.
"But," my husband begins to say. "We are Potters before Malfoys," he says seriously. "And we Potters love with all our hearts and laugh very loud," James sits in my husband's belly suddenly.
That is actually something that fascinates me about him. He is so connected with his magical core, that his words aren’t the usual golden letters. Nop. I am pretty sure that some of his own feelings shows through the magic creating the letters every time he uses the spell.
He nods softly and a sincere smile lands on his lips.
Grayback escapes from Azkaban lastnight.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No," he tells me and I stop, looking at our reflections in the mirror. And yet, the emotion that fills our bond is not repudiation. It is shame.
Magdy laughs seriously.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's okay, it's just a cramp," he tells me even with a clenched jaw.
The question takes me by surprise and I force myself to remember that this is not the magical world.
“Do you think he managed to crack it?” I ask her. But, she shake her head.
“Because we don’t take cases of suicides attempts,” Hermione chimes in again.
Baby Dray smiles at Narcissa, as he takes a lock of her mother's black hair and begins to pull it.
Dray smiles at me and Nesha wraps herself around his arm. Her eyes clossing, her wings flapping softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry's lively green eyes stare at me in disbelief. Does Harry think my words are meaningless?
I glaze back at my fake-boyfriend and I see how tight his jaw is set, his small hands balled into fist. His chest falling and rosing at an alarming fast rate. And before I know it, I am by his side, holding him to my chest.
Be careful while reading it, please. If you think any of the things mentioned up is a trigger for you, just don't read this, ok? Your well being is the most important thing in this world.
"What is this place, Hermione?" I ask, stopping in front of the huge blue river that seems to pass objects between its currents.
I ask him, a bit confused.
“I know you didn’t have enough time to practice your powers,” she is playing with her hands. “And I just wanted to know…”
Redfern’s voice is echoing through my mine. I rise from the floor remembering my mentor’s words.
"The faster the procedure can begin, the faster it will heal," Hannah puts his hand on my shoulder. “However, if you take him tomorrow, and even if you take him in a couple of weeks, I would tell you the same thing. Draco will be frustrated, and he's going to need someone to help him calm down. He will feel desolate and useless, you and I know Draco Malfoy and you know how he is. He will need someone to help him understand that he doesn't have to live fast or get better fast, he just need to get better at his own pace."
“Zephora Zambroni really stabbed us in the back?” Hermione asks me softly.
“Everyone with Unspeakable and auror education will be with Harry and me outside strengthening the wards of the castle and ready to battle as a first line,” Hermione says, taking charge of the situation. “Everyone with ministry knowledge will go with Professor Longbottom to ensure the safety of the students we still have to evacuate. Everyone with a Healer or Potion knowledge will assist in the infirmary when the time comes.”
"Excuse me Auror Robards," he says in a small voice. "I have a message for Auror Potter."
I open the door carefully and see my husband. Draco has a bandage on his left side, I can see it under his hospital shirt, and a cast in his thigh. I can feel various enchantments on his body and a celestial sphere on his heart.
“Recently I learned a few things from speaking with the dead,” he says. “As part of learning how to control certain powers, Redfern makes me go to a graveyard and try to understand my real power. Why is the moon so close to the realm of the death,” he told me, reaching to hold my hands and I let him. He is breaking in pieces and he is trying to keep himself whole, for me and a world that doesn’t know about him… or us. “I talked with my mother about her passing away and she told me it was her decision to pass away to a better realm. She told me about the future she can see and the future Pandora Lovegood can see. She told me about how she convinced Zephora to put me in extasis, so you and I can never find each other until later in life and how she asked my father to kill her, because her love for him will be my demised and yours.” His eyes are full of tears and my heart hurts. “How she made me an orphan in order to keep me alive because in all the other futures, you and I were enemies and at the end of the war I always ended like… a shell without a soul.”
"I love you, Harry James," he says to me and the brightness returns to his eyes and I feel lighter again. Happy. Complete.
"That is the matter, Zabini," I tell him in a serious tone. "Dray doesn't know who I am. What's more, he didn't even know my name until I told him one afternoon in the middle of a park.”
But now she is dead.
"Two Potters are missing," Kingsley says by way of greeting.
"I love you, too, Pup," he says softly, letting Teddy go.
“I cannot say a date, Mr. Potter,” she says, taking her glasses out of her face, and arranging them in the pockets of her sky-blue robes. “This,” and a hologram of Draco’s brains appear in front of me. “I had never seen something like this,” and at least she is being honest. “I don’t know what kind of repercussions this is going to cause in the long run,” she let her hands fall on my shoulder. “I didn’t believe you back there when you showed me how much you and Mr. Malfoy were involved one with the other, but I can see that you care a great deal for the other,” her eyes are searching me for something, but I don’t linger to much looking at her, not when Draco is the one lying unconscious in this bed. “I will contact Healer Morris, he is a specialist of magical brain damaged,” she says. “You just have to fill this forms, Mr. Potter. She is pitying me, but I don’t care. As long as that can bring someone here to help the blond, I don’t mind. They can look at me as they want, I don’t care about their opinions.
Out of the corner of my eye I can see Nesha flapping her wings gently and testing the air around her with her little pink tongue. A couple of nights ago, Harry brought a book that his friend, Luna Lovegood, lent him. There she talked about occamies, and how little ones use their tongue to smell… Which is strange, because as far as I know you can smell with your nose. And Nesha has one, then, why is not she using that one?
“Don’t be such a cruel person, Lucius,” she tells him. “Come with me, Draco,” she tells me. “We will never again ask you to kill anyone,” she whispers, guiding me to the kitchen. “We just want to make sure everything will be forgiven,” she stop in the place where is all the things to cook food in the Muggle way. I can feel my tears starting to dry and hope starting to bloom in my chest.
“We found the last Daily Prophet with in her arms,” he says. “It has a small section about you.”
McGonagall nods in understanding.
"Wingwardium Leviosa," Harry's voice breaks the silence.
"You died?" he asks me in disbelief and pain clouding his gaze. “This is just an illusion? Are you not real?"
“Don’t even for a second believe this is on you, Harry James, because it is not,” he says softly. His lips pressing against mine, and then Draco let me go. “This is not your fault. It was not your fault back there, neither is your fault now, not in the future, either. And I will make sure you always remember. I will be there to make you remember. I will be there, I just need you to have faith. Just a bit more, please.”
"I can't believe the hat put me in the yellow house," I tell Harry. "Yellow is not a color that suits me, Harry."
“We will keep them safe,” Ginevra pipes in. Her hair is short and vibrant. “While they do whatever the fuck, they have to in order to win this shit.”
“I am the Dark Lord,” he says, his red eyes looking at me.
I stand up and walk to where the board is. At this point, and after my talk with Tonks' mom, I'm sure Andromeda has no idea what happened to Narcissa Black, much less what happened to her first-born.
And I have seen his mental and physical improvement. His therapists have also seen it and this emotion that I feel inside my chest is called pride. Pride in everything he has accomplished in two weeks, pride in what I know he will accomplish very soon.
“How are you feeling today, Draco?” she asks sweetly.
Ron nods slightly.
"And who's he?" the redhead asks, looking at Dray intently.
"If my son had a magical ability superior to the common ones," I whisper, feeling like a nail of bitterness digs into me, because even though Bellatrix had murdered Dunbledore a couple of years ago, that doesn't mean I'm not a hundred percent certain that Dumbledore manipulated me for most of my childhood, leaving me at the mercy of the Dursleys only for me to gain maturity enough to defeat Voldemort someday. "I would also take him as far away as I could..." My mouth fell silent and I immediately moved uncomfortably. "The fact that Draco Black exists in the archives of Saint Mungo's means that he can also exist in the archives of any other magical hospital, anywhere in the world."
“Dicnonta Aspida,” in a whisper, because in this case is counterproductive to let the enemy know what the fuck is going on.
“We have no idea how many people is there, maybe being tortured as we speak,” the black skinned man looks up at me and I nod, knowing this is something they need to know if I want Cross’ team helping us out. We are just seven individuals in this room, and for politics interesses I know Kingsley can’t assist a mission like this and maybe… Maybe, Tonks would have enough sense into her to remember that Teddy, my own godson, is at home waiting for her.
, 2003
"Not exactly," he tells me softly. “Narcissa didn't survive whatever it was that was thrown at her, instead her body disintegrated, which in theory should have happened with Draco, but it really didn't. We are not quite sure, but you, my dear Harry, are not the only wizard who has survived the curse of being kissed by death,” his voice is only a mere sigh. "Right Phineas?" Albus asks out of nowhere, and I see a man move inside a painting.
“Accio Dray’s cello,” and the case zoom to us. Dray wrap his arms around his cello. "Now, I am taking my boyfriend home," I say to them. "Good night Molly, Arthur, Sirius," I say nodding softly. Dray waving at them, and then I close my eyes and imagine my bedroom at Grimauld 21, my new next-to-empty apartment.
Harry
A lot of our feelings were disregarded by the adults in our lives, a lot of fears were never big enough to deserve a hug. I know, that out there, a lot of people keep this fears and sadness in a tight box with, locked up. But I, again, want to remind you all, that people's feelings are valid and we are no one to actually belittle the things they are struggling with.
I nod, taking a sip from the steaming cup.
"Congratulations Jamie," Teddy fondly tousling his black hair. "You are no longer a baby," he says seriously.
I nod, letting my gaze wander the suspect board.
Ron and Blaise are the first to leave the conference room and when Harry begins to move to start on his duties, I grab his arm and he immediately turns to face me.
"No, child. That means you are as old as the magic that was put into the first walls of this Castle," I choke on my own breath. This wasn't so supossed to happen. This is not the way I would like for Dray to know about his heritage. "What house will I put you in, Draco Black? " asks the hat still moving, what I think, is his mouth.
"Now, Harry Potter," she tells me. "Healing is up to you."
"Harry," Albus calls out to me and I turn my head. "We need to see Dray."
I cross the inches that separate me from the delightful mouth of my husband and in a matter of seconds, it stops being a passionate kiss, to become something completely obscene. Draco's nails scratch my back and I feel my member begin to swell between the soft fabric of my underwear. I grunt at the pleasure I feel in the moment. It has been the most intense and exhausting summer of my entire life, perhaps rivaling only with the final battle at Hogwarts. However, it was easier to face Voldemort than to hear that my family had an accident, that one of my children had a broken arm, and that my entire family could have died if not for my husband.
“They started half an hour ago, but it's not open to the public,” he tells me and gives me a smile. "I don't think they will take much longer. There are a few prodigies playing in there."
“It is too difficult to control my own magic within the walls of a place that insists on feeding me day and night with the magic left by hundreds of people in this place. With the blood of normal humans who died to found this place and protect it... "
The celestial screen closes and the wings return to the ocean of objects.
And I do exactly what my husband demands of me.
I watch Kingsley lose color and breathe deeply, his eyes roaming Hermione's face.
Yes, Scorpius is a nerd.
I shake my head. I can understand where he is coming from. Draco and Teddy are the last Blacks alive. For obvious reasons, Kreacher favors the blond prick.
"Thanks, Harry," he says to me and stands up, the occamy pressed to his chest for warmth. "You are the best boyfriend in the world," he tells me and stands on tiptoe and leaves a kiss on my cheek.
"I love you," I tell him, combing his hair with my fingers and feeling extremely grateful. My own worry evaporating in the wake of his confession.
"We fond the kid I had talked you about, in an abandoned warehouse, close to the Devil's Fall," I tell him. "Today, early this morning."
"Don't pet the snakes like a kitten, Dray," I tell him in a serious tone. "They are not a cat or a rabbit."
Strategy. Ronald Weasley. Bets. Smart. Callous. Bitterness. Jealousy.
Since I woke up to this crazy world, Dumbledore’s existence has makes me queasy. It’s unnatural, gross and creepy. He should be death, but he is not thanks to Zephora and her powers.
"There was no wand in the forest," Blaise says on the brink of yelling at us and I think the only thing that helps him not to do so is Neekeal's gaze.
"The one that is burnt pink," I hear him say. I roll my eyes and take a deep breath, this is my husband, I love him even if he knows every color there it is in the world. "Pink, like Tonks' hair," I hear him say loud and clear. I let the air escape, now everything makes sense. I take the potion and make my way to the dining room.
“All that remains of this case is to find Narcissa Black's wand, although at this point it probably no longer exist. But we have to try, wands can help others to find certain... Things,” says Neekeal. People. Narcissa's wand knows her son, it can pinpoint him without failing. "The reason we are here is because there have been reports of Death Eaters prowling around the place where Narcissa Black and her child perished. We believe they are looking for that wand, too. He have to find it first, since we cannot find her child in time," Neekeal seems sad. "We failed 22 years ago and you are a younger generation. And I am sorry you have to live in the middle of this shitty world. But, if we want peace, we have to actively start to fight for it."
Teddy ends up asleep in my arms as the pieces begin to soften. It is the first time in my fourteen months of being a godfather that I have seen my godson fall asleep without putting up a fight over that simple act. And I smile, tucking Teddy into my arms, his chest moving gently up and down.
"Harry?" I call out to him. “What does it have to do with my magic just awakening? Albus said I could do it if I study hard enough."
"Excellent," the healer tells him, as she conjures up a bench outside the bridge. The image turns and Draco smiles softly, taking it in his hands. "You can change your clothes when you're ready," the woman tells him, smiling sincerely at him. "You have done excellent. I am proud of you."
And then, he is going away from me, his laughter echoing all over the yard, while I wish for the earth to open up and to swallow me, because how is it possible for him to know such detail.
Molly walks past me so fast that I can perfectly smell the scent of her perfume as she leaves the kitchen. And like the good dog that I am, I trail after her.
“Legilimens,” I whisper.
Ginevra Weasley is one of those people whom has been hurting so much, for a long time, that they don’t know how to be anything but sassy, snarky and ruthless. And yet, her eyes spark like lights and her heart is as pure as it can be.
I look at Ron and he looks at me.
And as I watch the two of them walk to the room where a floating Christmas tree is sure to await me… I can't help but feel like I must protect Dray now more than ever. Voldemort will hear from him soon and I am sure he will open the gates of hell just to give me a bitter drink.
“It’s scary, mate,” Ron whispers back, looking to the old cottage in front of us. “Just like that house.”
"What do you mean Master Draco wasn't here?" I ask him, taking my wand inside the pockets of my robes. I pass a hand through my hair, while my magic hum and thrums inside my body. It's ready to leash out to whomever is stupid enough to oppose me right now.
“And my boyfriend, Blaise,” Ginny says sitting beside Ron, Blaise following behind her. “He played seeker against Harry when we were in school. They were pretty good both, if you would’ve been there you will know, but now you know too.”
“Why?” I ask him, rocking the cage with my body. “This seems like so much fun to me.”
Slowly, I let my hand travels to his face, taking his chin with my dominant hand. The movement is obliging him to lift his face and the sight that welcomes me is one I want to burn in my memory forever.
Which is not gonna be anytime soon.
"Yes, Papa," James's amused voice, as he sticks his little fingers into my dough, brings me back to reality.
“Pansy is back in the country,” she says softly.
"But, I am pretty sure you actually became a spy to keep Mr. Potter alive," she says, her eyes glinting with mischief. “You can say whatever you want, you can even lie to yourself, Draco. But I know you better then any other human alive.”
I smile. Dray is one of those few humans in the world who can occasionally gather magic and create what they call Miracles. Dray is like that, he has the flame inside him, small, but resistant. I place a kiss on his forehead, intertwining our hands. I feel him curl up against my side and I mutter a spell to keep him warm. My magic protects me, but I want Dray to be protected too. The last thing I want is for him to catch a cold.
I look down at his finger. My magic is angry, really angry because the asset is lost and she is craving it’s closeness. Which, right now, is not an option.
Disowned by the darkness and disowned by the light.
“He wasn’t,” he says softly. “Dumbledore was selfish enough to drive him to an early grave. He didn’t love Gellert enough. But I am not here to tell you about that. I am here to let you know what was the final destination for Bellatrix’s soul,” he says softly. His hands are moving in circles. An orb is formed and I can see a house. “Can you see them?” he asks me and I nod.
“And why is Granger at our home?” Draco asks, looking at Hermione straight in the eye. “And she brings a visit.”
“Not so smart now, right, Argentum?” he says, closer to my face. The shackles are moving forward. “Leave me with him, all except you, Severus,” he says, raising.
Love you all.
And yet the feeling of wanting to push Hermione away from Dray is still there. The horrible thoughts are still there.
“I hate you,” I fire meekly.
The girl blushes and I hope I'm not being rude. However, the tunic is rearranged again, her hand scratching.
Harry appearing in the middle of the room silence everyone. I look up at Hermione, trying to understand what is happening. Everyone is looking at Harry like if he is some kind of God they haven’t seen before.
My whole body is mangled. My bow arm is littered with scars, my middle finger is missing and I can feel the pain throbbing there. The wound is ugly, and purple and my body is heating up too fast.
And yet, here and now, I feel like the luckiest man on earth.
"Come on, Auror Potter, I have a job to do," and with that, his lips touch my cheek, letting a soft kiss carress my skin, and Dray begins his journey towards the start of this war.
"You disappoint me, Kingsley," I say sadly, looking back at the Bonitas who continue to dance in the magic painting.
The six Weasleys in the kitchen and I, turn to where the blonde is with his huge backpack in hand. The boy's cold gaze flickers from one Weasley to the next.
"I'll ask my wife," he says, choosing the same answer as me.
HARRY
"Professor Flitwick, perhaps," says Teddy.
I swallow hardly.
But when we land home, nothing ever prepared me for what my eyes are showing me. I feel tears gathering on my eyes. I was gone maybe fifteen minutes and now…
Left comment and kuddos.
“Who is the Augurum?” a girl with dark skin asks. She is a Weasley now. She is married to one of the twins.
However, I cannot suppress what I feel inside of me. That feeling that things are wrong, that everything is going to go wrong, and I'm not going to be here to help Dray.
But the only thing I can feel is numbness.
The blond's cheeks are tinged with a soft pink color.
Do you think you knew Harry Potter? Sadly, Dray is the only one.
I smell it. This is the same hoody use to lounge around the house when the mornings are cold. It smells like Harry, not like the detergent and fabric softener non-sense that Harry insists is good for your clothes and your skin.
"Because, their parents were wounded beyond repair. The Dark Lord was wounded beyond repair, Miss Granger," he glance at me. "My parents hurt me and Sirius, but my brother met kindness in Fleammont Potter, James' dad. And when I met Zephora she extend her warm arm towards me. And even there, I thought it wasn't enough. I wanted to be a Death Eater to show my parents what they made of me, how badly they scared me, how wounded I was. Their nonsensical rules, the little affection they will show towards their own children, they lack of comprehension and love, the lack of sincerity, the great amount of coldness they show us... All of that shaped my generation, Miss Granger. But, coldness and evil weren't a common pureblood trait back in the past and Fleammont Potter was the living prove of it, neither was Severus Snape," he whisper. "And when Dray was born I decided I had to be better if I ever wanted for this kid to see me all his life, like the first he saw me. His blue eyes was seeing me like I was Merlin himself, just because I was singing to him. For him I wasn't damaged or hurting. For him I was just the best person in the world, and I wanted to be that... For him. I still want, for him."
“Oh,” I say making an o with my lips. “Are you a lost role character from Star Wars?” I ask, feigning innocence. “Because I am sure with a title like that, you shouldn’t be part of the Man In Blacks that are sitting here. Maybe it is because all of you are related to the space?”
“There were just two candidates to help Voldemort complete a stupid ritual,” he says. “Harry Potter or one Neville Longbottom. Pansy is just a few weeks older than you, Draco. And the same laws that applies for Argenti are for Auguri.” He nods.
Forty minutes latter, I note watching down to my wristwatch.
"Sorry," he apologies to the mediwitch that is walking by his said. She smiles at him, and ruffles his hair.
“He is convinced that Blaise Zabini knew something we didn’t. Zabini was expending an awful lot of time with the shinny orb I now know belongs to your Dray.” Arthur says. “But, whatever Zabini knew is now lost, until he awakes.”
"Dray was born under the name Draco Black, because his mother, Narcissa Black, had not married the man she had fallen in love with, and whom she intended to marry once Dray was one year old." Regulus's eyes quickly sadden. "However, Draco was born not as a magician, but as something else." He pauses and I see him look at the loaves in the center of the table. "Draco was born as an Argentum."
"Yes, his name is Dray Black," says Hermione, brushing the ash off her clothes and arranging her hair in a messy bun.
"And Narcissa?" Hermione asks so quickly, I'm not sure how anyone understood her.
"No," I say softly and quickly.
Teddy is in my arms, looking at everything around him. The small bracelet with red and black beeds that rests on his wrist, enclosing his magic. This was something I had been putting off, spending time with my godson. And even though Voldemort is angry, I don't think that's enough of a reason to attack Muggles, especially not something as out of his sight as a concert.
“Come with me Neville,” Pansy points to the door with her head.
Hugs,
Harry just laughs and holds me tight me against his body.
Left comment and kuddos.
"I need healer Mason in here to connect a Muggle IV to a new patient, who needs a transfusion," he says, and then the Patronus disappeared.
And for the first time this morning, I agree with him.
And between food and games, the morning flies by. My ears are filled with the laughter of boys and grown men alike. Until at the end, a table and a few chairs are set up and I see the same woman who spoke ill of my husband sit on a chair and take out a notebook. The pass she is carrying is that of a press guest and other people sit next to her.
"But, that's silly because you're married to Papa!" Scorpius exclaims in the most obvious tone that reminds me of Granger.
What?
He distances himself from me, then proceeds to hand me a bag.
Voldemort.
Left kuddos and comments, they make my day and makes me feel happy!
Dray looks at me like the words have physically hurt him.
"What are you talking about, Harry?" ´Mione says to me, while taking her eyes off Ron.
“And they believed that shit back there?” I ask her, baffled by her words. “That a little kid will save their asses?”
"He is a human being, not a fucking tool," my magic reach out of my body searching the house until it find Draco sleeping and I conjure him back to me. He appear in my arms, his eyes closed, sking glowing. "He is not gonna stay in here with all of you thinking he is a fucking tool to be use in this war, as if his feeling doesn't matter a fuck."
“I was training with a vampire,” he stops and then, he adds: “And a few house elves, that taught me a lot about elves,” his eyes are glinting in that innocent and I feel drunk suddenly. “And fairies and… what are their name?” he asks me. “The one with the little oval wings that glitters.”
“To the fireplace, then,” I tell the children, as I offer the bowl of Floo powder to Teddy.
I smirk at Draco, watching the children begin to devour their breakfasts. Toast, scrambled eggs, half an apple for each one, and giant cups of tea that remind me of Professor Sprout's mandrake pots.
My husband, who exhausted his magic core to save our children, putting his own life as risk just by trying to keep them... Us, safe.
The press turns to me and I look at my children.
"It depends," I say, stopping in front of the teachers' lounge. "Do you know that Papa doesn't leave work until two in the afternoon?" I ask him and push the door open, letting Scorpius enter first. The truth is, Harry hadn't been home for the last 36 hours. He stopped in the morning, so the kids don't worry about his overworked Papa. Harry went home a few minutes that morning for his family.
“A faes,” I say to him.
I shake my head, because of course this is something Harry might catch from one Hermione Granger. Because that’s how they are. Hermione is always spewing information; Harry is storing them and Ron is strategizing it.
I need to know who this Dray is and why his name feels so… Evil.
"Nothing strange, Regulus," her voice filled the room. “The parts of his body that his father cut off when he was a newborn will never grow again, my dear friend. His eyes are exactly as they should be. His skin color is exactly as it should be, even after his seal is broken nothing of him will physically change. The only thing that will change is the amount of magic that other wizards will feel that he emanates. He will not grow wings, because those of his kind does not have it, because those of his kind does not need them. He will not become violent, since his species is one of the purest that have walked on earth.” Zephora's eyes shine just like Dumbledore's. “He will remain the Dray you loved and adored when he was just an infant, unable to eat more than milk and honey. And it will continue to be the same child you brought to his first day of class, music classes, and karate classes. ” Zephora pauses. "He won't be someone else, he will just be more."
That made the trick and the memory appears in front of me. At least I just can see snips, like this person wasn’t really seeing. And then, there’s my love. Standing in front of this crazy witch with his eyes shinning like a kaleidoscope.
I can see through Dumbledore’s façade.
Damn. He is too cute for my own good.
"Okay, ‘Mione," I tell her, taking a deep breath. "We will keep silent."
"Hello, Vanya," I see him practically lying on the counter. A plump gray-haired woman appears behind the counter, her chocolate eyes gleaming in the golden lights.
The breeze moves the trees and I am so grateful that I made the wise decision to wear a coat and scarf today. I close my eyes and let my magic travel freely around the trees surrounding the little log cabin with white and mint paint. The smell of pine trees invades my senses and makes me feel relaxed.
"The only one who can open this door is you, Harry Potter," she says in a voice that reminds me of the voice of the Unspeakeables. "If someone else tries to open it, I do not guarantee his or her safety." She pats me lightly on the hand. "Go ahead, Harry. Dray is waiting for you.”
Please, left comments. I love to read whatever it is you think about this story so far.
Draco backs away from me and his eyes shine like stars.
His eyes close briefly, and then he opens them, his gray irises staring up at the sky. And even as his bow is raised, his middle finger is still moving over the instrument, and it sounds like a human being has taken its last breath.
Draco’s words are intense in color and big in length. Maybe, his magic is showing through his own happiness.
I see Kingsley conjuring his patronus.
"Harry, I dreamed that He-The Dark Lord-Voldemort," he stuttered. " That he had returned and instead of being me whom let Grayback enter Hogwarts, it was James instead, with his face full of terror. Instead of being me, the tortured one was Teddy," his voice breaks and I squeeze him, I put my arms around his waist and I kissed what I think is his forehead. "Instead of being me the one whom torture all those Muggles during the raids, it was Scorpius. It was Scorpius, small and with his eyes filled with tears, filled with pain and suffering."
I cross the feet that separates us and I engulf her my arms. This is like the little Ginny I grew up with. The little girl that was fierce enough the shit out of you, yet she wears her heart in her sleeves.
Update... Yes. Left kuddos and comments.
Except of course, for my sister's son: The Young Black, the last legitimate heir to the magic that has flowed through the veins of each of the members of the Black family. Sirius the traitor saw to it that we lost track of my sweet little sister Cissy's little boy. The little bastard of hers being the seventh son of a man of our generation, after our little brother Lesath died in a tragic accident while learning black magic at the age of seven.
He laughs so loud. His head tilted to one side.
The children get out of bed with a smile so big that I'm afraid their faces will split in half.
It is like if she is trying to keep her away from Draco’s vulnerability. Even if Draco isn’t actually a kind of invalid or something, I am pretty sure Hermione was trying to preserve his privacy. And I am glad to have her here, because, Draco has always been like this. Lithe, all hardlines… but, fragile. And so fucking strong and beautiful at the same time.
"Voldemort," the head of the Unspeakables tells him, shaking the hood of her robes down. "You can say it, Robards."
"Can we talk about this in the kitchen?" I ask quietly, trying to placate my husband.
“You are not,” she says softly. “You have us, and we are gonna help you find your soulmate. And he will be here with you, Harry. Just, cling a bit long to faith.”
The audacity of this man.
I sigh, letting myself be carried away by my instinct.
the letters are soft and dull.
Hermione smiles sheepishly at him. Her smile isn’t touching her eyes today and I feel utterly concerned about this development. Carefree, knowledgeable, kind Hermione… Trying to keep something horrible for herself. I know this gaze. I know this kind of smile.
“Because I do care about you,” he says softly, and something soft start to dab against my nose. “And I still love you.”
Because there's no way Malfoy doesn't know who Dray is, not when Voldemort has gone so far to have him. Not when they look so fucking alike. I swallow hard, feeling my own stomach pumemeting to the ground with dread.
"Yes," she replies in a serious tone, while continuing to wave her wand from side to side.
The Patronus disappear in a burst of light-blue glittering bubble and I feel cold creeping up my spine. This is not good. Until I hear the commotion outside the room, healers rushing someone to the isolation room. The same room Draco was in when Parkinson and I found him the first time. Aurors following the healers, restraining someone physically.
I had major problems with my eyesight and they are comming slowly to normalcy, but its gonna take a while to be all good again. While that happens, I feel happy to post, not as frecuent as I would like, but...
"Today I want to try a triple with cheese," I tell her, relaxing my muscles. Two people sit at our table. However, I briefly ignore them. "And, I am not a prince."
"Love, you have to calm down. Your magic is out of control,” I say to Draco, squeezing his hand, trying to ground him.
Oh, oh…
Goldstein walks to him and I can hear sob coming out of Parkison’s mouth.
"Voldemort," and I see him shrug along with half the other people present in the room. "He has attacked the Muggle world again."
, and I smile sideways knowing that my thinking is not far from reality.
This is so odd; I reach for my magic. The real magic that elves possess, not this nonsense we show to wizards. A few more elves are appearing around us, and I can feel the thrum of their magiks.
Stag looks at me with his silver, ethereal eyes, his antlers moving in the direction where Dray is asleep. His body in a ball in the wide bed, covered by the sheets. His cream skin contrasting beautifully against the crimson red of my Gryffindor jersey shirt.
“Focus, Harry,” she says, narrowing her eyes at me. “I know you are worried, Harry but, do you really think he might be able to help you?” Hermione asks again. I must do something to signal her my confusion. “Dray.”
"Sure, Harry," she tells me softly and her hand falls on my shoulder. "Just tell me when you want to start the process and I'll put you in touch with one of the best lawyers in the wizarding world."
I close my eyes and chant inside my head an old ritual to bond Draco and Nesha to some extent. My magic will be just a catalyst and this will be temporary. Maybe two or three days, then the magic will be gone.
The woman seating across from us looks at Teddy and immediately begins to make faces at him. My godson gives the stranger his full attention and the lady lets out a loud laugh when the little Metamorphmagus gives her a four-tooth smile.
“Draco, this is the second time your own magic attack a part of your body that is related to one of your senses,” he says, pressing his palms to the bed rail. “The first time it was your vocal cords, now, your magic attacked your hearing,” he says, softly. “This is utterly shocking for me,” he says slowly, but it is not about pity. He is actually, mussing out loud.  “Explain this to me.”
I look up, trying to catch something different. Because, this is so fucked up and I am losing my cool pretty fast. And I know I can become kind of stupider if I am under too much pressure.
The man reads it and smiles at me.
The yells of terror are running through these old, magical alleys. The people are running and I can see the house in front of us closing its doors. The house of a werewolf family. The sky turns grey, but the weather is warm.
This is how Dray hadn't become a dark creature. Zephora Zambroni did her work pretty good. Keeping him pure and allowing him a way to do magic, even if he cannot feel it yet. Or maybe, he can. And I am glad I has been honored to share a kiss with this man.
I nod, and I salute him.
I hear footsteps approaching and immediately a silver head appears in the room. Dray's gray eyes are fixed on each of those present and his hands grab the door frame.
"Yes, however, he is high in positions," he tells me seriously and suddenly stops in front of the door that I am beginning to know as much as my own office.
“We keeps him until its time,” she says again.
I open my eyes and look at Harry, sitting in front of me, his green eyes look at me with the greatest love anyone has ever expressed to me, perhaps only comparable to the love with which my own father looks at me.
"I still think it would be a great idea if they could put this in some kind of closet with which people can teleport from one place to another," says the boy and Harry leans in to place a kiss on the boy's white head.
"Nothing will be right, because he doesn't breathe," I try to keep it together. "Nothing will be ok because he's cold," my voice comes out in broken sobs. "Because he is dead."
"Don't worry, Harry," Kinsgely tells me. "The only messages that must be delivered are those that serve to lift the recipient out of ignorance," a smile rests on the dark lips of the Minister for Magic. "You think Draco doesn't know? Do you think Draco is not aware that only good conquers evil, but does not end up harming the lives of others, but rather by blowing life into a soul that is about to die? " his dark eyes look inside me and I feel naked. “Isn't that what that kid does every day? Isn't that what you've started to do since you've been with him? " I feel my eyes fog up and a lump clogs my throat. "This message was not for Draco, Harry," he tells me softly. “It was for you, because Narcissa is entrusting you with her child's life and heart,” his words are sincere. "And I know better than anyone, because she was my best friend. And I've always known about Draco and what he is. And I have protected him, along with hundreds of other people who left their lives as magicians behind to ensure that the one who would change the outcome of the war will come to full maturity,” Kingsley's words leave me cold. "And that moment has come, Harry," he tells me softly. "You have Narcissa's blessing to woo her child, your soul mate."
I keep thinking about the words Ron just muttered.
the letters are lazily forming. I can perceive Draco’s own hesitation in the air. His weight is resting on my own body, his hands are bunching the fabric that covers his body from the cold. His eyes are glazing slowly. Unshed tears.
Hair as blond as the rays of the sun itself, shining as if hundreds of diamonds were entwined in its strands; hands so milky, with long and delicate fingers dance on the neck of an instrument, whose name I do not remember anything about.
Dray is an Argentum and I wouldn't be surprised if he could set that album on fire just because he wanted to.
Nesha looks at me and I just smile and nod. The occamy throws her body forward, but once Hagrid tries to touch her, Nesha leans back and looks at him like he's ready to attack her.
But I let it go. I let go of the strand.
Harry and Draco are still on their week-end date.
And don’t take me wrong. I could be death, if it wasn’t for his need to ramble until boredom come. So, I am alive due to his lack of being able to shut his trap. Too much for a dark lord that loves to torture and kill.
"Gin," I call out to the girl. "Could you not be all over Harry while the boy is here?" I ask the redhead youngest female.
What on earth could George Weasley give my son to make him so eager to open it?
"Don't tell him that, tough, he might vomit," I say softly, trying to make my son laugh with something they thing are prank words. But deep inside me, I know my husband and even if the year passed by, Draco will still feel ashamed and unworthy of all the thing we have achieved together somedays. James climbs on top of me like he's a spider and I'm a tree, laughing happily. "To watch TV, then."
"Dray, love," I call to him, closing the apartment door behind me. "Draco?"
“This is,” I open the door using my wand. Revealing a bedroom painted in a light brown color, with floor to ceiling windows, because I cannot stand close spaces anymore. “Our bedroom.”
I feel like I am being pushed out of a memory from one moment to the next, and I feel sick from the sudden movement. One moment I am standing next to toddler Dray and the next moment I am facing the twenty-year-old Dray whom I have claimed as my own, night after night, dawn after dawn.
Somehow, she knows I am not her Harry. Harry, the Original one.
"Do you swear Hermione Jean Granger to keep what Draco Black is as a secret?" Dumbledore's voice shakes the air.
I will lose my daughter with this. But we will survive. Because we have love and that’s… That’s all that matters.
I just swallow slowly, not wanting to make this hard for her, or stupidly cruel for the blond. Whatever Hermione is covering up, it couldn’t be good.
You are all on my prayers.
“An old man told me once, Zephora, that is preferable to die before taint our very souls,” I say to her, trying to keep the tears and the pain out of my voice, watching as my own hands starts to tint with black lines.
I nod, not wanting to waste more time in this argument without sense. At the end, Dumbledore will try to play God and all the other might as well be just pawns. I am hundred percent sure he is not seeing Riddle anymore, he is seeing Gellert Grindelwald and all the things he could have done differently back there.
"I know, my love," he answers him softly.
"What is your favorite piece so far?" he asks me, putting his papers aside.
"He is an asset in this..." Moody tells me.
A week. We have been here a week. Hermione and Parkinson were a huge help this last days, helping me to contact with different physicians, healers and what-not to help Draco to find his feet in this new journey. I am still not sure about the life outside here, but I want to be confident he will be all good.
I nod and I guide her through the beauty that is now Grimmauld Place. All the house went through a furious make up, courtesy of Luna and her endless need to help helpless souls that knows nothing about decorating a home. So, she paints the walls with light color and then, I had to put up with a whiney Draco Malfoy about owning the worst fashionable curtains ever, the impossible and less-then-comfortable furniture. And then with a furious Hermione complaining about the lack of things in the house and with a shameless Ron bringing sets of cutleries so he can cook and eat here whenever they drop by. Grimmauld 12 started to change with the endless love of all my friends.
“We are really sure the caster can trigger the attacks,” she says softly. “We have two new patents just yesterday. They injured themselves the same day and the same time, Mister Malfoy did.” I exhale softly. “This is really a curse and a really, old, dark one at that.”
I nod softly. The silent is not suffocating, but my guilt is. I feel the need to scratch my own skin until I am clean… Clean of so much things and magic that had stained me since that horrible day in Godric’s Hollow.
And here we are, trying to find out what is happening to us entirely. It is not just being bonded what we are trying to discover, but how to control Draco's magic. However, I have a promise to keep and that promise means not getting involved in Draco's decisions as to how to develop his own magic.
Kingsley smiles as the eyes of the Narcissa Black's painting open up for the first time.
"Regulus," he says to me in a whisper, his voice tinged with exhaustion. "Regulus Black."
I let my control over my magic break and immediately feel it envelop the room and then crash into something and sing contentedly within my veins.
"If you could recite something your parents say every day, what would you say to me?" asks a woman with chocolate hair.
“Give me my soulmate back!” the voice is in pain. My soulmate is in a pain so big that its bleeding in his words.
"That's right, Mister Potter," he says softly. "Your husband will be well. Now we are just waiting for him to wake up on his own. Maybe it will takes a couple of months and a lot of love and a lot of understanding when his bone starts to heal and he will have to do physical therapy. However, he is alive, and that is what matters. ”
"It's not a little house," Ron tells me, sighing heavily. “It is more like a small town, like Hogsmeade. But, the houses are taller and not so white and pretty,” his eyes move around the office. “More like cold and dingy. Not to mention that all the people who inhabit the place are creatures.”
"I hope you fill out the form, Harry," he tells me in a serious tone.
“Not pretty sure, why?” she asks me, and I let go of her hand.
"I'm sorry, but it's been twenty minutes now, Harry." She tells me in a low voice, smiling at me. "We'll most likely discharge him tomorrow," she tells me, looking up at Draco. "The bruises won't be gone by tomorrow, but I think it will do his brain good to be in a familiar place."
(See the end of the chapter for
“What does that even mean?” I ask him. “I have no idea what I did.” I stand up and Pansy is there to catch me before I can give the floor my declaration of undying love.
She knows something I don’t.
"A brat? You?" it's hard to picture him as everything, but not a brat.
“Well, your blood is the only one thing that is going to restore this body completely,” he says, bringing his lips to the gushing wound.
The blond, who now wears a pale rainbow through her hair, extends her hand to the man.
“Albus, do you know that with this kind of knowledge, Riddle can actually make Grindelwald come back from his grave, right?” I ask him, feeling remorse crept back to my heart.
“It’s like the Monarchy in England, but for magical English people,” she says. “And Ronald, The House of Weasley is part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.”
"Hey, Paps," Teddy greets me. His hair the same color as Remus's.
“Dumbledore doesn’t have just one spy amidst Voldemort’s ranks,” I whisper, understanding dawning in me. “They are four spies. Four spies of Dumbledore in Voldemort’s ranks.”
"Legilimens," Severus whispers, his hand barely touching his wand.
She nods, and then she pull out a cup and we hold it for dear life.
The world around me stops and I raise my eyes, to see the person who has practically just told me that my husband can die.
I look at my two best friends.
“Who?”
It doesn't take long, until it's Draco who's begging. And I immediately seek his entrance by sticking a finger in and stimulating the area, until the ring of muscles relaxes. I look at my husband and I can see his gray eyes clouding with pleasure. And I take that moment to insert one more finger, moving them up and down.
Dray looks me straight in the eye, his gray orbs glowing with pure amusement, while his lips try to hide a small smile.
“Come here the both of you, now,” Iris’ father says, the softly rays of sun caressing his face without harming him. “Your mother says the darkness is coming over. You need to get…”
I open my eyes to see into Bellatrix’s. My stomach is churning, by body is too hot, my hands hurt, like they are tearing themselves in half. I let a cry scape my mouth for the first time.
I sit down at the bed’s foot and let my hand descend to his knee. I gaze up to Draco, remembering that now he needs to see my lips to understand, or cast a spell so the golden letter can appear above my head for him to read.
I can hear the sound, even if that one was meant to stay inside my head.
And that same night I realized, that the twenty-two-year-old Harry Potter was also extremely lucky, because, even if it was many years later, Harry Potter had found someone who wanted to spend time with him, just for the simple fact of being Harry and not The boy who lived.
And even though Harry is here, after introducing me to the person who has turned his world upside down, somehow I can't help but wonder if James and Lilly would be happy about this. Lilly obviously yes, but… James?
Fuck.
I can and I will.
And even as I turn around to go home to my boyfriend and our pets, I can't help but feel like Hermione is going to cause the prophet a lot of trouble.
A new sob escapes Draco's mouth and I feel my heart break in pieces.
“He killed them all?” Ron asks. His face palling.
I shrug, because I don't care.
“Of course, I am not better,” she says happy. “I am worst, really.” She cackles.
“If you want I can come back early,” I offer, knowing that imposing myself will only hurt my husband's feelings.
Ron looks up from the stack of papers in front of him and I watch him look at his cucumber sandwich disinterestedly.
"So, Harry Potter," I say putting leaning my body into his. “Time to unpack. It is time for you to have a home to return to after you are done with the magical Hitler."
I link my hand to Draco’s and he let me have this moment. I still think about not being Gryffindorish of me to lie, or to enjoy this moment, built up just over lies. But I don’t care. I will take whatever it is I can have. Whatever Draco wants to give me.
"What was that?" I ask Parkinson, knowing her she wouldn't resist to insult me and then, she will proceed to give me my answer. I just have to endure in silence.
"Uh ..." I try to hide my laughter as best I can. "Thank you," he finally says and hugs her carefully.
Draco smiles at him and leans down to kiss our youngest son, and suddenly James leans forward and Draco's lips drop to his forehead.
I talk with this beautiful friend of mine and she is always helping me to get through the bad days.
“A better question is, what would be wrong next,” Smart Healer says. “He is alive just because he was here with Mister Potter when the last attack was casted over him.”
Because I could never forget that moment. That moment when I realized that the world needed more people like Dray than people like Harry. Because that night I realized, that Dray Black would do anything to put a smile on a child's face and that if Harry Potter child had met a Dray in his childhood, he would not be so damaged. So broken.
"Cheers," I tell Dray, while trying to figure out how to eat this monstrosity without embarrassing myself in front of this gorgeous blond angel.
"I know, love," he tells me and something cold is set against my cheek. “You'll be fine in a few more hours. Madame Pomfrey has always been good at healing everything."
"Dray!" I call him when I enter the room and I don't see him. The television is off, as is the radio.
“I killed Bellatrix Lestrange,” I say softly to him.
“I will be as careful as I can, master,” I say, snapping my fingers and feeling the magic blanketing me.
The door closing softly behind her.
“We see each other, Harry Potter,” he says smirking at me. “Let me tell you something so you can do your heroic deed. I will destroy Hogwarts today night. So, you can be everyone's hero, again. I will give you that before I destroy you and your soulmate in the process,” I feel my rage building, but my body is frozen. “And when I kill you I will make him watch, just so I can wake up the little rogue argentum that’s sleeping inside him.”
“Who are you,” Ron asks, reading his wand to strike.
The female-one shakes my hand and I kind of feel strange.
"So, James' first toothache," I whisper out of nowhere. However, Draco's hand rests on mine. His wedding ring shining in the sunlight streaming through the window. "They grow too fast," I say to Draco, looking him in the eye.
A sad smile is awarded to you all today, because my heart is sad.
What?
“The what now?” I ask her.
“It can be different for Draco,” I say, feeling exhausted.
"I ... Uh," I see him look at Mione and then Charlie. "Uh, I decided not to go drinking lastnight. I needed to think."
"Two weeks maybe," I reply in a serious tone. "We'd only had two dates, maybe." My voice breaks, my chest hurts and I try to breathe.
"Regulus," he says, nodding his head slightly. "How are you, old friend?" he asks me, his eyes resting on the door in front of us.
"Were you late everywhere you went?" he asks me, while trying to hold his laughter in his mouth.
"Tell Dad to come back soon, the plants are dying," Teddy tells me, winking at me. "The Burrow," he says clearly and disappears into the green flames.
Hermione nods and then asks: “Why are you so involved in this?”
"Soul of the shadows hurt my Occa," it says and looks at me, sadness shining in his sad green eyes. I immediately remember Fawks and how he healed me in the chamber or secrets. "Red light hitting my wing while moving house."
"Don't worry Miss Hermione Granger," Zephora's voice brings me back from whatever Regulus Black has put me on. "You will have it as soon as you and young Weasley have taken an oath with me."
"I actually was expecting a tantrum for messing up with your hair," I confess him.
Bill shakes his head softly.
"Why hasn't Robards informed me of this?" whispers Kingsley.
"My Papa is not an Occlumens," he tells her in a serious tone. Marline. “He is a Legilimango. My Daddy is the Occlumens."
And it is true. Since I've known about Voldemort, I haven't had a single year of peace. However, here is the person who has the power to defeat Voldemort or give him more power, although I still don't really understand how. Zephora said that Dray could give Voldemort a new body and Narcissa Black's wand was filled with something I still can't describe.
"No one disputes that to you, Harry," Hermione tells me in a serious voice. "But, Muggleborns aren't born every year," she tells me in a serious voice. “More purebloods and halfbloods are born than Muggleborns. And although many people here feel sorry and dirty about blood purity, the truth is that most of the ancient families are mixed with some magical creature, which makes them pureblood and not halfblood."
"Will the children stay with Molly?" I ask him, as I open the door to our room, letting Draco go first.
"Some days I don't know how the kids can tell me they love me," Draco whispers. "How can you sleep with me every night and wake up and want to stay by my side."
Out of the corner of my eye I watch James and Scorpius enter the kitchen. Their joy makes the magic of both make the light bulbs, in the house, blink for brief seconds.
Dray looks at her and then looks at me and I see him laugh softly, his gray eyes closing tightly for a brief second and giving her all the tenderness of a little boy who has remembered a mischief.
"Are you always this insecure of yourself?" he asks me and his question catches me off guard. However, a giggle escapes his lips and his right hand rest on my cheeks. “I like you too Harry. A lot."
Rowle's face lingers in my mind, like it's a Muggle portrait photograph, and I can stare straight into his soul.
Patsy the house elf, Grindelwal.
“So, are Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy dating?” and smart-healer doesn’t waste time.
“That’s what he wants,” I say to him. “He wants people to suffer, the same way he suffered.” She murmurs and I feel a pang of sorry for Voldemort.
“Yes, Master Harry?” she asks. She has a new, sparkling, baby pink dress and a white bow on her head. “Make sure Master Draco is okay, please. He cannot hear now, remember. So, he is going to need help around the kitchen.”
I am sure it is not poison. Poison are not meaning to taste this good and as Snape made me drink a few of my own potions, I really know how semi-poison taste likes. My potions were meant to make people ill at best, kill them when I was really out of it.
Draco walks away from me and heads toward the sink. I laugh softly, taking a clean towel to dry the dishes and I stand next to my husband, simply enjoying his company and the warmth that comes from his body.
The fuck?
Usually when the aurors work with them, those who wear black robes rise to the surface, to the floors where all the other people in colored robes work.
I see Hermione wipe away the tears that flow from her eyes. From one moment to the next, one person starts clapping and all the others follow, slowly coming out of the trance that Dray's magic put them into. His talent combined with his magic.
“Harry, if Rowle recognized Dray, even for a brief second, what guarantees us that Rowle doesn't know why he was so shocked when he saw him? We don't know who his father is. Remember, Harry, Regulus said Dray's father was a Death Eater. " She tells me in a serious tone, her eyes alight. “For all we know, in these moments, Voldemort may have already made the connection between Dray and any of his stupid toys. Especially if Rowle met Dray's father in person."
What the fucking hell happened to this kid?
"See you tomorrow, Black," says another blond, setting a small suitcase on his back. "Excellent work," he tells her.
“He asked the same out of you about you killing Lucius,” he says harshly. His voice spitting venom. “And still, you killed him.”
"What is Rossé Cotage like?" I ask him, trying to get an idea of what could have happened in that place.
James stirs in my arms and I let him go.
I listen to it with special attention and I feel that something does not fit. There is something that has been bothering me since the day Ron and I started putting together the puzzle of Narcissa Black's life, in an effort to find what Voldemort is looking for or why did she ran away.
“Come on, sweetheart,” Mrs. Weasley says. She takes Ginny out of my reach. “Let’s go talk to Kingsley, again.”
I lift my eyes looking straight into Redfern’s eyes. He is old, he is skilled in magic… and his eyes changes like a rainbow, laying his emotions open for whomever who wants to meet him.
"Daddy is brave," he says seriously.
And from one moment to the next, I feel a fluffy cloud under my body. Madame Pomfrey stops next to me in a few seconds.
My husband's mouth and hands pull away from me and I immediately feel the loss. The hot water still doesn't help me, except it makes me feel fucking relaxed and half drunk with pleasure. Draco's hands return to my hair and I feel something cold and thick on my scalp, and my husband's fingers deftly massaging.
“Well, Potter truly is the kid from the prophecy,” the man says, getting up and popping his back. “And now I know why.”
"I'd love to make love to you tonight, stay by your side and hold you until dawn," Harry tells me. "But unfortunately, my love, we have a place to be."
I swallow.
The whole room laughs, some more discreetly than others, but eventually everyone ends up laughing.
“What has Dumbledore to do with anything?” Goldstein asks me while munching on a sandwich.
Hermione shake her head.
And it is not the Python that attacks him, but something else, something much more lethal. I just see the white beam blinding me and I press Dray to my body, a pair of sinister curses on the tip of my tongue.
I force myself not to think about what happened last night and focus on Harry. Harry is behind me at my left hand and his magic is still in the air, but calmer now. Madame Pomfrey is in front of me, a little more to my right, perhaps, trying to put distance between her and Harry.
“I am sorry,” I can hear Hermione, but I know Draco can’t. He wanders over their beds, one at the side of the other. “I am really sorry, Draco.”
"Kreacher knows your people," he says in a serious tone. “And you are not like them. You are an abomination that must have died, mudblood. ” Kreacher looks at him with so much hatred and I feel the desire to intervene.
"Gross," James follows.
“Not for many and I am fucking sure I am not over it, yet,” I say, knowing it is true.
But, I hope you can enjoy this chapter. It brakes my heart to wrote this, but yes... I cannot hide this facts anymore.
He nods softly, watching me.
There’s Mad Eye Moody, in the middle of the night. I can see clearly the entry to the Hall of Truth at the Ministry of Magic. This is where a lot of the unspeakable works happens.
"I would rather lock them in a bunker and never let them out, than let someone as mad and full of hatred as Voldemort set their eyes on them," he whispers and I feel like this is not even the worst part. "I would rather commit suicide than force my children to do what my father forced me to do."
God, what kind of monsters have Draco and I created? They only think about winning.
But whatever it takes, my sun will rise soon. I will make sure of that.
“Well, I don’t see you using any cartier or holding a Gucci, darling,” I say to her, looking her up and down. “For all that I know, your clothes are as dirty as her blood, if not even more. At least she has enough money to buy decent clothes. And you have what? A poor taste for clothes, I am sure that statement even apply for the men you fuck with.”
I watch Draco sitting slowly in the hospital bed. His skin is pale, the bags under his eyes are gone and, even if he hadn’t been up and about for much time, his cheeks are growing rosy, just like his plush lips.
“He is gonna be ok, Gin,” I say, rubbing circles in her back. “You know he is a tough guy.”
Albus retracts his hand.
Guys I tried to actually put an image in here but, it is just not happening because if it's not devinart then you are really screw, I hate this about AO3 that you cannot actually publish an image of your own. I just lost all my morning trying to do it and definitely if its not Devinart then nothing is gonna happen. So... I will left you the link to my IG account so you can find my draw.
Without breaking the Statue of Secrecy.
Until the music stops and everything goes silent.
I nod gently.

"Good," says Kinsgley. "This meeting is over. And remember, there is a war over our heads and if we don't win, nothing will be left alive." Kingsley's eyes fall on the same Auror who has been so troublesome this year that even Ron has thought to curse him.
"Okay. Scrabble is over, ”I say, as I take Scorpius and put him down. "Now, get your aprons to decorate Teddy's candy."
I remember Professor Snape right now, because he taught me what was one of the hardest lessons I had ever learned during my teen years. Young and immature, I believed that ignorance would give me the sympathy of others and Snape was always in charge of letting me know that it did not. And, there is no way I could beat Voldemort if I kept myself inside my own ignorance. Not when Voldemort is anything but ignorant about the rules in which the magical world and its population operate.
"Yeah, it a big and pretty College and a lady has a crush on him," Scorpius says as if he's talking to no one. "I don't think she knows that when a person has a ring on his hand it is because he has already found his soul mate."
"You can sit at my desk, Scorpius," I say to my son and I immediately see him obey and climb into the chair. "Or you can sit on the floor."
I look exactly where she is looking at. Regulus Black is sporting a new, blood made, dark mark.
Hermione feels guilty.
his letters spells. “
"Excuse me," Dray speaks to the half-giant. "Could you help her?" he asks, while looking at Nesha and stroking her head with his index finger. "I don't know what's wrong with her… But, I want her to get better."
I've always wondered that. However, I'm sure I can't reach out and ask Dray about this. Because I am pretty sure he doesn't know either. Regulus could be a lot of things, but he is a good dad above everything.
"He knows it, he knows that I can do magic and he also knows that I am some kind of terrorist-victim-policeman," I tell him, taking the copy of the Prophet. "And I also filled out the form where I inform the Ministry about my official relationship with a Muggle."
"You are just like Cissy," he says in a whisper. "One of the most beautiful and powerful witches I have ever met." He tells him, Dray smiles at him full force. "Dra ..." However, he is unable to say the blond's full name. "You are alive," he says softly. "Cissy's legacy has not died."
I smile to her.
Ron nods and I follow.
Draco will be alright soon.
“It’s not a kind diary,” he says. “This are my mother’s memoire,” he whispers. “Here are entries from Kingsley Shacklebolt, Sirius Black, Albus Dumbledore, Pandora Lovegood and my mother. A genius in politics, a rebel with a heart of gold, a master mind orchestrating demises, a seer and a formidable witch.”
A fairy?
“I just… I don’t know,” he says, his hands clutching hard at my shirt. “I was just… Something about a case,” he mumbles brokenly. “A Potion or a cream?” he asks to the nothingness. “I don’t know really. I just remember needing a knife, a copper one. And then, there were my parents telling me how to make our family better.”
GreeneySilvery
"Are you sure of that, my boy?" Albus asks him.
"My time is up, it's about dawn," she smiles at us both. "Goodbye, my prince. Severus, take care of this fool. You were always the smartest once."
Well, I love the Asset, not as much as the other Harry with his stupid feelings in the way. But, the Asset is easy to take care of. The Asset lives on sparkly poop from unicorns, and even the most stupid thing can make him happy.
She nods softly, and Draco worries his lips.
"Professor Malfoy," one of my students raises his hand and begins to ask. "What happened to you?"
I focus exclusively on blinking because I'm not really sure nodding or shaking my head is a good idea. At least not when Hermione directs threats like that at me. I prefer to reserve my answer and act based on how things develop.
"Okay," the healer tells him, helping him to his feet. "You will walk through here," she tells him, as she helps him to what looks like a bridge with iron railings. "And you'll lean against the railings using your hands, trying not to put too much weight on the healing leg, but using it anyways, okay?"
I don't hear anyone's answer, but I do hear the door open and close. I know the Weasleys are in the living room, but I really don't want to see anyone. At least not today.
"There are only five papers in this bag," I reply, as I shake the aforementioned item. "This will be like a sort lottery." I tell them with a tight smile. "A very gore lottery."
"It is not yet known for sure what oxytocin is or all the effects it causes in humans or in their bodies, however it is known that it is a hormone is produced in the hypothalamos and released by the pituitary. It is what cause natural childbirth and also, oxytocin is the hormone the that allows us to connect, in a way os speaking, with other living beings on the planet." he says with a single breath and I look at my students.
Last night was something much more than just sex. It was as if my mind, my body, my soul and my magic were in complete sync. And I loved every second of what we did last night, the feeling of having power, of feeling like I can control my magic and knowing that loving is not bad. The feeling of Dray wrapped all around my body, and mine covering his. His kisses sweet and hot and needy at the same. The little moans that scaped his mouth making me feel powerful.
“I need to remember him,” I say to him.
"Always so humble, Mister Potter," he tells me, trying to hide his giggle. "Where to, today?"
"So you know me, Dray?" I ask him, fixing my eyes on his and I see him blush deeply. "Do you know me from the park?"
“The Dark Lord was never meant to be,” she says softly.
"Thank you, Minister," I tell him, feeling my cheeks burn. Kingsley's face changes for a few seconds and he seems to hesitate for a few seconds. "Is your partner not a Muggle, Auror Potter?"
OCTOBER 27th, 2002
This chapter is dedicated to ZennyNR, because this is the only way I know to offer comfort for the rough time they are going through. It maybe not much, but I hope it can soothe their heart.
Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω Ω
“Her names is Ada Mason,” she says with the same tone she used with Ron and I when we were teens. “Therefor she is Healer Mason.”
“This is not just a U.K. problem?” I ask her, seating down on the floor.
Old magic. Zephora Zambroni's magic is similar to the one that is always coatting the Room of Requirements. Breathing on its own somehow, warm and solid at the same time. But, I am pretty sure this woman is capable of killing without giving the act a second guess. But, then again, all the founders could do the same. All of us can chose to join Voldemort and kill and hurt and maim.
I nod at her.
"Albus will be here any minute now, Harry," Hermione tells me. "He will fix this."
“He is Draco Malfoy,” he answers my question without hesitation. “And he has been cruse.” Davidson says, giving me his back and looking at Draco. I move to be in his visual range to seize him better. “We don’t understand completely what this curse is working, but it is for sure, trying to kill him.”
"Good morning, gentlemen," Robard's voice makes my companions and I turn directly to see him. "As you all know, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named..." begins Robards.
“Can I rally on you to take care of that one?” I ask Hermione, while handling her my robe.
"Love," I whisper against my husband's ear. "Wake up," I say again, exploring my husband's neck with my mouth.
I cannot express in words what I feel, so I briefly let my feelings flood the bond I have with my husband and in seconds I close it, trying not to overwhelm Draco. I kneel down to face my husband and hold him in my arms.
Psychological hugs to everyone!
I look down and while Scorpius has a Malfoy grin on his features, James has a face of utter disgust.
Harry
"Do not. My apologies, Dray,” he says, looking away and then his eyes fall on me. "Well, Harry," Albus tells me. "You've already heard it," the old man hands me a piece of paper. “Here are the schedules of all the teachers, with the houses they attend. I can trust you read the summary of the most important things about each Hogwarts subject, right?" He direct his question towards the blond.
“Clever,” I whisper, my brain trying to reverse whatever Malfoy did here. “The prat is fucking clever.”
I am in fucking hell right now.
"St. Hellene Hospital," her voice filled the room with a little more hope. "The only hospital in the wizarding world that has the name of a woman."
"Harry," she says seriously. "Maybe you want to stop by the Magical Hospital in Warsaw," she says in a near whisper. "I'm sure they can give you more information about Narcissa Black," she tells me in an understandable tone. "They were in charge of preparing her body for the funeral."
"You can take a seat, gentlemen," Neekeal tells us, as he levitates the painting and then sticks it to the wall with her magic.
“Maybe we are not really searching for ghosts,” Hermione whispers, taking her wand fiercely between her fingers. She has that looks that screams Unspeakeable, her eyes fixed upon something.
Fifteen Minutes to Midnight
I see Wardwood from the corner of my eye. He's brain is slowing down if the frown dessapearing form his forehead is something to go by.
"That's impossible," Hermione tells him in a serious voice. "If you take into account the natural factors and that perhaps it was left in the open, chances are that not even its bones remain. As Neekeal said, the most probably thing is for his baby body to turn to magic again."
"Minister," I salute him, tilting my head slightly. "Teddy is with Bill Weasley and Draco is at a friend's house."
“You are angry,” she hisses back.
I take a deep breathe.
And immediately I know that today we will have problems.
the letters form themselves very slowly.
"Yes, love. It talks," I raise my wand. "Regulus Black," I say to the enchanted book and the pages begin to turn quickly. "Look," I tell Dray, as the book settles down and there it is, Regulus Black holding the trophy in a Slytherin uniform.
I see him reach out and grab a piece of treacle tart and right after chewing on it his head turns into the head of a cockatoo, as he looks at the person next to him and his mouth opens, letting out a strange sound.
“And he is confused,” a joy fairy says to us. Her wand is dancing in her hand. “Really confused.”
Hermione twirls her wand between her fingers and her eyes scan the ceiling of the room. Beside her, Ron folds his arms and his lips tighten into a firm line.
"So, whisper to Bella the address of our dear boy Dray, so that my three friends can take better care of him, Miss Skitter, because it is certain that if someone like you could find him, then it is a matter of time until someone like Dumbledore ties up loose ends. and take it away from us. And you see, Miss Skitter, Dray Black is necessary for us, because he is the right person to attract someone I have been looking for for a long time, ”he tells her and walks over to her. "And now, you too will be part of my group of friends, Miss Skitter," and without further ado, her wand digs into the woman's forearm, as red and black smoke begins to wrap around her arm. Blood runs down her pale skin, as do tears.
Today is the day. Regulus will meet with Sirius again, because I cannot hold this any longer. Regulus has been impatient, specially knowing who the fuck I am and how much of a spotlight I am shading in his son.
"He's much better," I tell him, pulling my auror robe off and laying it on my arm. "The healers say it will take a while, that he has to do therapy first and then learn a few extra things to make everything okay."
"Lucius, my friend," he says putting his hand on my shoulder. "Stop tormenting yourself."
“I will bring this to Voldemort,” I say with gritted teeth. And thinking about going back to Malfoy Mannor, I let my magic engulf me, until there’s nothing but the pressure of executing an apparition.
“Good riddance, mate,” the Asian girl says. “Bellatrix was a bitch. She killed a lot of people. Babies, infants, kids, elders, you name them, she has a grave for all o’ them,” Neville says. Pansy’s mate. “She tortured until they were left just as a shell, no soul no pain… She made me into an orphan with living parents. Parents that cannot even talk, walk even if they are alive,” he says softly. Pansy turns around ready to copy Harry’s actions with me. “I am glad she is not longer here. Because she a sadistic little bitch and I am sure that if given the opportunity to torture, maim or kill the kids that attend this school she will gladly do all three.”
“I wasn’t finished,” he says. “I just… Forgget.” He says, but I can feel his breathing slowing.
I giggle.
"The Burrow," they tell me in unison, as they climb into the fireplace.
“A prodigy,” Hermione chimes in.
"No," he tells me and I hear him swallow. “I want to live to keep knowing you. To have a million dates with you."
"Time is up, Regulus," she tells me, as her hands sit still on the black glove.
"And here it is," he tells me in a serious tone, as he stops in front of an old-looking establishment.
Dray’s voice echoing in my head.
"It not matter, Papa held me first," Scorpius replies, putting his little arms around my body.
I am happy with this chapter, viewing things form Sirius perspective wasn't easy but it was enlighten and a bit sad at the same time. Which brough me to this: love everyone, specially if that someone is family.
“I saw Draco,” I say to him, trying to swallow that damn lump in my throat. “There’s a house elf called Patsy, I need to know for whom she works. And Gellert Grindelwald and Obscurials.”
"Harry..." Kingsley try to say me.
I look at the seven story hamburger that can stand only and only because a wooden stick is keeping it together.
That shocks me back to reality.
“I am all better now, Mione,” I say to her softly.  “He is inside my mind and my soul. We are together again.”
"Yes, my Lord," and like Naggini, I walk to the Dark Lord's throne and sit at her feet, in an exact copy of the pose of that detestable serpent.
Because I am sure Greengrass will kill for him, and Parkinson… Parkinson will bring hell to whomever did this to him.
"Green," Scorpius yells.
Draco
"He's in my room with an ecstasy spell covering his body," I tell them, feeling defeated.
I look at the plump, blue-eyed, brown-haired woman and smile at her. This is the second time that I am in this hospital, specifically waiting for this person. The only one who can look me in the eye without making me feel like a Rock Star or something similar.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Harry, but this cello is my responsibility, besides, it's a part of me," he tells me in a low voice.
“Where’s your mother orb?” I ask him, trying to look inside his eyes and he lets me.
I respectfully raise my hand, giving Kingsley a chance to deny me permission to speak. My heart still pounding about Kingsley telling them about Draco Black being in our ranks. Shit.
I feel depressed suddenly.
"It's ok, darling. You can open your eyes, now," he says softly.
And the silhouette of Narcissa Black disappears along with the celestial ocean that is her memory. Just a tiny bright light blue sphere is left floating in the room.
I feel my cheeks turn red as I try to look anywhere but Hermione. This girl spits out knowledge like it's anything.
"Harry here, he says yellow looks good on me," I reply, my nose wrinkling in distaste.
Dray nods and I can breathe easy.
My husband's face is pure love and my heart swells with love.
"The seal that was put on Draco when he was baby is breaking. His magic will reach its peak during the next new moon and then the seal will completely break. The magic that has hidden it from the magical beings who seek him and from those who wait for him, will be broken.” She says with a serious look.
"You are the prodigy, I hadn't forget how you stealed the prize away from me in the juniur cathegory when we were just kids," but he is still smiling at my boyfriend. "Give my greetings to your papa," and then he is laughing his arse off and Dray blush prettily.
“I can say his name,” she says softly. And then her face morph to one of painful confirmation. “They broke him.”
"Wow," Hermione tells us. "I see you discovered the entire Narcissa Black family tree." she say mockingly
“Harry,” Hermione’s voice brings me back to realm of the living. “You need to take a look at this.” She is raising the arm of a dead body. “The dark mark is faded,” she says softly. “But the skin is raw-red and I still can see some of the shape of the mark in there.”
And I can feel his entire body relax in my arms.
"As usual?" she asks and the blonde just nods. "And what can I bring you, handsome?" she asks me, winking at me.
“So, someone brook in the DOM,” I say to him. He nods. I sigh, feeling tire already. I look up at Ron and I can see the bad news aren’t over. “You-Know-How killed muggles, and left them to be burned in the entrance of the Ministry.” He mumbles, sadness coating his voice. “The Hit Wizards believe there’s something else. Something else is going at Hogwarts, something else is going at Diagon Alley, something else is going at Malfoy Mannor, something else is going in Knocturn Alley, something else is going at Burry Hall, and something else is going at Hogsmeade.”
Jaxley and Bella has never play well along. They are like stupid children with an affinity to kill everything and everyone in their paths, and that’s just what a good day looks like for those two.
“Well, he is fit as hell,” I say to her. “And he is so fucking good with his mouth.” A blush graces her cheeks. Yes, because his mouth can land people in Azkaban.
She caresses my cheek softly and then; a full smile is gracing her lips.
"Do you trust me?" I ask him, feeling my own nerves become visible for the first time all night.
"A chicken one and this thing called Burguenator," the red-haired boy with the big biceps tells him.
"Don't you think that's funny..." he asks me, as we make our way to where it smells good. "That Harry can challenge a dark wizard who has tried to kill him since he was a baby without thinking about what might happen to him, but faced with the prospect of bringing the subject of his affections home, he may not be able to see past five minutes?"
"I think we should let young Potter decide if he wants them to know this or not," Regulus says, raising his wand. My wand flies into his hand and I feel betrayed.
"Harry," he whispers and takes my hand in his.
"Who is investigating this?" Ron asks, looking but not touching.
Hello guys and girls. I have been busy a lot this week, but here this is again. I will try to update every Friday because I have half day free and I just wanna make this constantly, being discipline with this story as I am with every concert I prepare.
I nod gently, while taking a deep breath. Was the boy angry about his suitcase?
“It can be Dray or one of the other four spies,” Mione says, her face blanching. “We need to talk with Kingsley.”
Harry reaches into the bag and when his hand comes out, there is a flower on it.
And all this because of the prophecy that was lost to Nathan Nott.
Which is why the extra chair in the livingroom surprises me. However, it is not the only thing that surprises me.
“You were born with so much power, yet you did kill innocent kids, with your magic,” the man says. “We were there, watching you. The three years old kid that cannot control his power. The kid that had no control over his own power because…” he paused. “Right, you own biological father saw you like the hazard you are and tried to end you. Your life took away your mother’s life. And for what?”
"I assure you this is urgent, Minister," I tell him, turning around and looking at him seriously.
"And neither are you," he tells me, looking me straight in the eye. "It may be that he grew up among normal people, but that doesn't mean he didn't know about the magical culture of London, or the hell they've had to live with since you were 13, Harry," his eyes show me gray orbs like the sky before. of a storm. "Soul mates don't just mean being in love and I don't know how much other bullshit, Harry," Dray tells me, looking up from him. "Soulmates know each other's feelings, and at the same time, they have a deep understanding of each other's fears and longings."
I can't help the sob that comes out of my lips, while I feel like my heart is breaking into a thousand pieces again.
“I love you,” he whispers to me. “I cannot tell you anymore and I will try to keep myself away from this fight, because I know between me and the world, you will always put me first,” his lip is trembling. “And I think I am not worth that much.”
"Abrax," Regulus calls out, as his head rolls to the side. "Tell me no one found it."
Her blue eyes rest on me again and I can't help the blush that peeks from my cheeks.
"Yes, and I send him to Hogwarts," I say slowly. "Hogwarts is the key. We need Dobby and we need to go to Hogwarts."
“For me you are worth the world, Dray,” my voice is shaking and I force myself to continue.
November 15th, 2002
“Mister Malfoy,” Robards all him but Draco, just keep his slow pace towards the kitchen, oblivious to our words. “Potion Master Malfoy!”
I take her from her arm.
This person is angry, but most of all, this person is dangerous.
"Daddy loves me more!" James yells enthusiastically, and Scorpius looks at him, gets out of his chair and walks towards me.
"To what do I owe the visit of the three of you?" he asks, as if it's the strangest thing to see the three of us together in his office.
Malfoy’s don’t cry, I try to tell myself. I run my hand over my hair forcefully, trying to erase away the prove of my own agony.
A strange person is Ginevra Weasley.
Draco, the Slytherin that the world accused of having no feelings, of being the most evil person of our year, that Draco was that kid. How funny that no one ever realized he was just a scared boy, too young to know occlumency and be so good at it as Dumbledore. Too young to know how to cast an Imperius correctly or a Cruciatus curse, and he managed it all, because his family was at stake. Because he had a heart back then, and he has a bigger one now.
"Not for this one. This is not a formal event, Miss Hermione," Dray tells her, as he tosses Ron's tie on the couch in my apartment. “It is not necessary for them to wear a tie or cloth pants. A black jean and a long-sleeved shirt of any color is sufficient. Plus, you guys will be in the VIP area,” he tells us, as he fixes my best friend's shirt collar. “It is not necessary for them to hang themselves with a tie. The only ones who need to dress like princes for this event are the musicians. It is something that our director always demands and provides."
Draco
The girl nods quickly and nervously.
And when I turn around, James is also completely asleep.
Determination shines in his eyes and he nods slightly, as he turns and faces the three wizards in front of him.
“They were the first members of Dumbledore’s Army,” she says to me. “A lot of them became Aurors, Unspeakeables and Hit Wizards,” she explains softly to me. “All of them have known the truth since the beginning. A lot of them believed in Harry back there and they still believe in Harry.”
"Or any other elf," complete Ron, wrinkling his nose.
"Don't worry, Dray," I say, lowering my head a little to connect with his eyes. "Of course I eat meat," I say and give him a smile.
"Do you know what happened, Hannah?" I ask her, as I take a seat.
"Voldemort know about Harry Potter, it's only a matter of time until he find my boy. They are together, they are soulmates," she tells us both. "Get ready, the worst is yet to begin."
“Draco,” he says softly, big silver eyes shining with tears. “My name is Draco and I am scare of myself.”
"Potter," he says in a serious tone, but I don't care. "Watch what you are doing, boy."
I am pacing Draco’s room, still waiting for the healers to give us a clear. I am growing anxious, being trapped in this little, white, room. I stop momentarily just to watch Draco peacefully asleep in the mattress.
"It doesn't matter," my mother tells heim, as she hands Fleur a small plate to feed Victoire. “When you feel like it's time, you can bring him in, Harry. You are also my son, and I want to see you at this table sitting with the person you love.”
"Okay, love," I tell him, going back to preparing our drinks.
Narcissa's wand… It's still at my house.
But the thing is… Riddle is no Grindelwald. Because Gellert, like it to no one, was someone with an objective. Instead, the Dark Lord is just a psychopath.
Kingsley smiles at me.
Mostly, Kingsley.
“Is he ok?” Mione asks and her gaze lands on me. “He was recovering good, right?”
"Please," he begs me, sticking his ass against my cock and causing me to lose control of my own magic again, until I feel it collide with something soft, powerful… Alive.
"Nesha," the hiss leaving the occamy makes me tickle. "Like when the sun goes down and the goddess of darkness comes out."
“Maybe you should stop calling him your evil twin, mate,” Ron says to me, taking off his Auror’s robes. “Because he is not. At least, not now.”
I swallow my own feelings, before grabbing my wand, the ten vials for test solutions, the vials of the investigation, to proceed to go to the Muggle World. This is the best part about Harry’s place. I can be a Muggle any day, or a Wizard, without having to go through the hassle.
And once we land on my living room, I can see Robards in there, together with Smart Healer, Hermione and Ron in the couches, sipping tea. I look at all of them with apprehension.
Draco starts to hum and I close my eyes, enjoying my last minutes of peace with my soulmate.
Thanks for reading this. Left comments and kuddos.
He whispers to me, kissing my forehead.
When did the time go so fast? Just yesterday, Teddy was a little bag of joy, asking to fly every Sunday morning. Just yesterday the twin were little bundles of joy blurting out unintelligible words and needing a diaper change every three hours.
Because that's what Draco Malfoy is good at, pushing people away.
"Yes," he says in a serious tone.
Yes, I have been struggling a lot with dark thoughts, and here it is this new chapter.
"What do you mean, Zephora?" Albus asks, trying to confirm the terror that has attacked me for years.
"That's not what matters, Harry," I tell him, stroking his cheek with my free hand. “Do you know what is very very important in life? Do you know what is most important when you live such a short life, Harry? " I ask him and see him softly deny, but his eyes are dead, no spark at all. “The most important thing when you think you are gonna part soon is to love and let yourself be loved. And you, Harry, are adept at the former, and a failure at the latter."
Left comments and kuddos they makes my day/night all better. You can follow me on IG: @GreeneySilvery
Once we reach the main office, I look at everything around me.
"Harry," I hear him say to me, as he lifts his hand and places it on my cheek. "You are real."
Not a lot things to say. I was just remembering my own winter back in 2018, when we decided to give a concert in a hospital. It was amazing, being able to change someone life even for a few moments. It was magical, seeing them smile.
"Ginny is a weird name for a boy," says the redhead, standing next to Harry. "My name is Ginny too," says the girl, smiling at him innocently.
I close my eyes, envisioning in my mind-eye Draco's little country house. The light painted walls and the exotic furniture that doesn't make any sense to me, but that are okay for him and I gather my magic at the tip of my right fingers. I snap them and I feel myself compressing at the navel.
"Have Harry go St. Helen and then to Andromeda's. I'll go with Blaise to Rosse Cottage," says Ron, as he passes his piece of paper to Harry.
But Gwen Goldenheart is a different case. Sometimes I think if it is a curse being born male in a pureblood circle. It’s not like if the girls have is easier, but at least, they weren’t forced onto a lot of things.
But, if you have diabetis don't eat it too much muffin.
Dray's arms wrap around my waist.
"Auror Weasley, what did you come to say?" he says, waving his hand gently. "I hope this day doesn't get worse." He whispers, massaging his forehead.
"Sure he will, your father is Harry Potter," he says in a serious tone.
Draco moves over to the cupboard and starts scooping out the jelly and bread, then putting them on the kitchen counter.
"I have heard of you," she tells her in a sincere tone. Her eyes sparkling. "Harry said you are the youngest member of the London Symphony Orchestra." Hermione tells him, as if that information was in any of the books that she has been reading over the years.
"Dray," I whisper his name, sticking his silver head to my chest. "Please, my love," my whispers turn to sobs. "Please, Dray," I feel the tears trickle down my cheeks, as I try to hold on to her body, her silver head resting on my chest, her body tight against mine. "Please come back. I can't… I can't without you, ”my magic leaves my own body, leaving me completely empty and at the same time lost. I close my eyes and cry for everything I have lost in a matter of a single night, I cry for everything I would like to do and perhaps, now I can never do. "I love you, Dray," and it's a broken sob. "Please, my love, do not abandon me."
“Draco,” I call his name, going straight to his potion lab. That’s Draco favorite place in all the house. When he is not reading or watching History Channel, then he is there, trying to solve the Auror’s, Unspeakable’s and Hit Wizards problems of highly illegal and deadly potions taken on raids.
I smile her back. Because, there’s no way she will misunderstand that I want something with her.
Kingsley opens his mouth and his hand is extends toward the blond's face, who stays still, while the huge dark hand caresses his delicate cheek. At that moment, I see Kingsley's eyes fill with tears and one of them runs away.
“Harry,” I call to him, trying to reach him somehow, even if here is no strand with his fiery magical signature to use as a communication instrument. “Harry. I miss you and I love you so, so much.”
I say to myself.
"What's your dad's name?" I ask him. Perhaps it is wrong to ask just now that he is between sleep and consciousness. However, I can't think of anything else.
“Uh, but that shit is scaring Harry The Frist,” she says softly. She is swearing and it didn’t sound like a bad word at all.
“The war is over, Potter,” he says.
"Wingwardium Leviosa," Dray says, softer this time, but somehow something has changed.
"The day Potter went to visit the giant he was with a person," says Lucius. “A boy with colored hair and a little spark of magic inside him. So small and tiny that it's stupid to think that something like that can be considered the son of a wizard, ”says the fake blond, as disgust creeps onto his features. "This squib was at Hogwarts, and was subsequently brought to Hogwarts with the intention of bridging a gap between us Purebloods and the Mudbloods that have crept into our world."
"Good to know," I tell him, while patting him on the back. “Good to know,” I repeat, stealing a potato chip from the redhead.
Zephora looks at me and shakes her head. A soft smile appearing in her lips.
"Can I already have an excuse to hug you?" Dray asks me, his ears turning pink.
And when I return my gaze to the center of the room, Victoirse's eyes begin to close and I can see her breathing deepen until she stops fighting with exhaustion and surrenders to Morpheus's arms. And even though Victoire has already closed her eyes, Dray continues to play for the grumpy little girl. Each song with long, warm notes, and perhaps a little bitter. But, this is not for me, but for the effusive Vicky.
With a quick step, I leave the Auror floor, while I get into the lift of the Ministry, almost losing a finger in the attempt. However, this is imperative. Kingsley needs to know the truth, now.
Hermione looks at Harry as if she can extract the answers from his head.
"Ginevra," Molly Weasley's voice is a whisper that makes me sit up straight. “Stop teasing Harry and his boyfriend. He has been sad and dull for the past three years. And you're engaged to Blaise Zabini, be respectful of the both of them,” Molly pointed at her with the spatula. "Now when Dray returns to eat dinner diner with us properly, I hope you will apologize to him and I hope that apology is sincere."
“There's a feature coming out tomorrow because all Aurors are heroes,” Brandon Cooper tells me bored. Being Cooper one of the most creative aurors when it comes to hostage rescue tactics, I understand your boredom. "Or so Robards says."
I let a shaky gasp let my mouth.
“I am Redfern,” he says softly.
“It will only take a moment, Nesha. You'll be better,” I tell her, dipping my finger into the foul substance that is dittany and gently touching the snake's wing. "See? Everything is fine."
The hat laughs.
James gently denies.
“I love you both,” I say before gripping my wand between my finger and thinking about my destination.
I nod softly.
"And do you want him to kill you?" I ask him, putting my hands on his cheeks.
This is a bad idea.
I can feel my magic crackling inside me. Ready to take retaliation against anyone that try to harm Draco in any way or form.
“Are you sure you should be going in tonight, Harry?” he asks me.
It lulls me to sleep again. I start to relax my tired muscles and I let go of all the things I shouldn’t be thinking about. But, at the end, the bright emerald eyes of the only person I have ever love romantically, keeps staring at me through my mussing. I can hear Harry’s laugh and I can smell that atrocious treacle tart he is so fond of.
He chuckles in my face, bending to let another kiss in my face. Until now, Harry hasn’t kiss me in the mouth like a normal couple… But, then again, we are the definition of a lot of things, but normal has never been part of that list.
"Yes, the best there is," Draco responds and I know this will involve a couple of changes.
Harry's heart is soaring out to Dray Black.
"They are the best ice creams I have ever had, I assure you," I tell him, as I walk beside him.
"He's going to be fine, Harry," she tells me. The smile on her lips touching her eyes. “He will need therapy, and most likely a wheelchair while completing therapy, but he will be alright. Also, I want him to see a mind healer. "
"Harry," he says in a sensual tone, approaching me, running his hands behind the back of my neck. His hands playing with my hair. “You are still as beautiful as the day we had our first date. Even more beautiful than our wedding day,” he tells me and I see him lift his face. His mouth parted and ready to be kissed to death.
"Harry!" The scream snaps me out of my musings, as I turn my head to where I hear Dray's voice. "Harry!" He calls me again and his hand moves in greeting.
"Sirius?" Harry calls me, running a hand in front of my face.
And she blushes.
“Let’s go home. You need a bath, food and a good movie,” I say to him. I let my hand slip down to his neck, caressing his milky, soft, skin and watching in delight when he shivers from my touch.
There’s the Mione I know and love.
I take the first thrust and Draco finds support on the edge of the tub, his body rising and falling on my erection. The water moving in time with his smooth, slow pace. I raise my hand and caress his abdomen, his chest and any other place that is within reach of my hands. My eyes never leaving my husband's face.
NOVEMBER 1st, 2002
"Harry is still young, but his feelings have never been won lightly," Arthur continues, however, when I follow the point where his eyes are past, I see Molly. Her curly red hair is styled into a high bun and her bangs are falling over her forehead, while her hand tightly grips a wooden spoon. “Harry is our son too, Sirius. And I know that it has always been difficult for him to open up to people, and if this guy has really caught his attention, then I am willing to support him to the end. I would give my life for the happiness of each of my children, including Harry."
"Narcissa Black had two sisters," I reply to Harry. "Narcissa Black's older sister was Bellatrix Lestrange, but her middle sister was Adromeda Tonks," I say as if it were public knowledge. "Any family member of Narcissa Black is, automatically, a suspect in this investigation."
"Healer Abbott requires Auror Potter immediately at Saint Mungos ..." he says it and swallows quickly. “His husband had an accident with his children. She needs someone to make the medical decisions.”
I grip my hand and prepare myself to defend Goldstein. Parkinson is a Hit Wizard, she sure as hell can take care of herself.
"Dray," I whisper, putting my hand on his shoulder and pulling him out of his reverie. “We have to go to Dumbledore. There is one last thing you have to see."
"Hello, beautiful," I can't help the nickname from escaping my lips.
I push him a bit away from me and look for his eyes. I see him shake his head, and then drop against me.
“What if he doesn't like my family? What if he doesn't…? " I hear him say and I try to hide the laugh that tries to escape from my lips. "Sirius," Harry reproaches me. "It's not funny."
"He is more, Harry. He is like you, in a different way," he says in a whisper.
“The pairs will be the next,” Kingsley says and I open my eyes to show awareness. “Potter, Granger and Weasley,” he says and the only question I can think of is: where the fuck is Mione? Ron smirks at me. “Cross, Sloan and Cooper. There would be other two people from the UAB to help you put this crazy plan in action.”
“We just need to catch the geniuses when they are babies,” the other tween says, their eyes glinting with mischief. “So, lets give our friend Dray a broom, so he can show off.”
"It's amazing that he's still holding Victoire," Molly tells me, pulling away from me. "Even Bill doesn't dare get too close to her when she's in this fussy."
"Argenti are known for their soul-healing traits," she tell me.
And suddenly, I see myself in the memory. Dray's eyes look at me as if he wanted to explain all the things that I didn't know at the time, and that the blonde was gently sharing with me.
Hermione pulls away from me and smiles at Ron.
Yes, this same place was where a magical duel took place, in which Bellatrix Lestrange ripped a part of Sirius's neck and Martha Yowle was sucked into the veil. I can still hear the smirk as she cursed Sirius and watched him bleed on the dark cold black floor.
Immediately the warmth of the sun makes me blink and I look forward, where a wall of bushes welcomes me. At first this was just a patio, but with Neville's help and his lack of a places to put his magic flowers, my empty apartment ended up being his little greenhouse.
"Come in," he says softly to me, and all I can do is take off my only remaining piece of clothing and get into the bathtub. The warm water feels good on my muscles. However, the temperature does nothing to make my erection decrease, but I feel a new wave of pleasure travel my back and nest in the center of my body.
January 2
"No," she says softly. “I think he already know who his soulmate is. He already know its name. He've already talked to his other half. He's already touched it and not just physically,” she says with a light smile. "I am sure, the bond is already there. The moon have been too bright these past days."
He looks at her, even if we are surrounded by barely light.
"Rest now, love," I hear him say in a lower volume of voice.
This is my last day in France and the only thing I can think of is that I have been away from Dray for over a month. Usually this is something I dislike deeply, but this time I have no choice but, let it be.
“The quaffle,” the twins chimes in. Angelina Weasley sitting in a couch, far far far away from her husband.
I hope you can enjoy this chapter.
"Tata," Teddy babbles again, waving his little hand.
“Anyone would clap after a beautiful rendition of Panis Angelicus,” he tells me with a bright smile on his lips. "On the other hand, I still don't know what you have done."
"So Harry," I say very softly. "What's it gonna be? Are you going to keep loving me and not let me love you? Or are you going to take my hand and allow me to walk this life by yourside, no matter if it is a short or a long one."
knows better how to inflict pain. And in much ingenious ways too.”
I can see the 3D image going off and I lift my eyes to meet with the healer’s warm ones.
Kreacher nods, and then his hands wipe away the few tears that has gathered in his eyes.
Another wave of pleasure runs through my entire body when Draco suck on my tongue, I push my hips forward trying to get friction. However, Draco pulls away from me and a slight moan of dissatisfaction escapes my lips.
"Who's that?" Ron asks me with a frown.
"Someone like Fudge?" Harry asks.
And all because Hermione touched Dray.
"What is an Argentum?" Ron asks, the same way he asks questions in the auror meeting room. "And why erased his name?"
And here comes the shitty people with dark capes and dark outfits and a kind of scary skull-mask. All of them took a seat, and then, they are taking their masks off, with such easy and grace.
"And I you," he says softly, almost a whisper.
And I know how it feels, after all, I took classes with Snape all summer.
"Sure, whatever you want," I say softly, brushing a few strands of hair from his forehead once I'm settled in bed.
Hey, guys, I have a fucking fever of 103 F, and I feel like shit. But, this was nagging inside my head... So, I tried to writte the best I could.
Harry voice and presence are shimmering inside of my head. He looks so solid right now.
“What thing would Voldemort wants that is in here?” A young man, maybe in age with me asks. His eyes are serene and pure.
"It's Harry Potter," the murmur begins again and Dray chuckles beside me.
“Yes, Harry?” He says, his arms relaxing around my shoulders.
Draco groans, but doesn't miss a beat. He accelerates his pace, looking for friction. Looking to relieve the pain and reach the point of maximum pleasure. I allow it and move in sync with my husband, hitting that sweet spot insides him. That spot that makes him moan and arch his back. I open my eyes briefly, knowing the end is near. Tears wash over Draco's face and I can't help it.
"You are welcome at Hogwarts this week, Harry," Dumbledore tells me again, handing me a scroll. "This is arranged with Kingsley..."
I ask him, not sure and feeling a cold rock fall in my stomach.
Draco smirks at everyone's effort.
, 2003
“I will bring it,” Hermione offers and then, she is gone in a blur of blue and brown.
That set me off me deeply. Dray raises his face so fast that I'm afraid he's hurt himself, as my brain tries to process what Mad Eye just said. And yet, I can't say anything when the man pulls out his wand.
"Yes," she nods at me. "The wards in the back yard had a big hole in them. A dog could walk through it, anyone who still can crawl, could access Draco's yard."
I shake gently. There is no way in the world for me to tell you why.
And I knew that panic did not belong to me. It belonged to Dray, who must have been at home rehearsing to play Paganini. And after that incident, after making sure that Dray was fine, that nothing and no one had hurt him, I promised him that we would find out what was happening to us. And we compromised.
I peel off him and see his gray eyes begin to glow with amusement.
“Since a few weeks ago,” I say, not wanting to give a specific amount of time.
Blaise nods.
Useless, the monster inside my head yell without compassion. Utterly useless.
Slowly I begin to swim towards the surface where my conscious is and immediately a smile rests on my lips. The night before was practically magical. Never in my entire life have I felt anything like last night. I know I can't really compare sex with others to what happened last night with Draco, as that wasn't just sex.
"Apparently," he tells me.
"Good," is all I reply, starting to make my way over to where the blonde is. Out of the corner of my eye I see the girl adjusting her robes, almost making one of the sleeves fall down her arm and leave her shoulder bare. "Did something bite you?"
“As your highness wish,” I say to him, securing him in arms and readying myself to apparated us away.
Harry has time to find peace with the death of his parents, he told me so himself. While Neville…
"I have your address," she says softly, almost without anyone being able to hear her.
"Daddy!" Scorpius's scream echoes in the house.
"Tata," Teddy tells me, pointing at the people marching to the stage and the second white hair I see passing is Dray. Dressed like a prince, with a gold medallion around his neck, he makes me feel extremely proud. "Tata," Teddy starts bouncing on my legs. "Tata!"
"Hard to stop dressing up like a prince, right Dray?" she winks at me.
"You really like him," Sirius tells me, standing next to me, as I focus on the blonde and the little pink bundle resting on his arms. “I can see it in your face. It's been a long time since I've seen your eyes shine like this," Sirius stops suddenly. "You actually remind me a lot of James when he was just getting to know your mother."
"Don't stay with the Mog-les," Teddy repeats, his hair changing to a platinum blond hair with neon blue streaks. His eyes a combination between green and the deep-honey brown that were Remus'.
“For a potion prodigy, you are quite stupid when it is about relationships,” he says going down to my jaw. “But I don’t know any better either.” He says, and I can feel myself being lifted up between strong arms. My head falling to broad muscled shoulders. “I wanted to ask you out, and I was practicing what I was about to say with Ginny, though we shouldn’t do it in my office,” I feel myself being put down in a soft bed and it smell like Harry and Draco and I want to burry myself in the smell, the warm… “Would you have said yes back there, if you hadn’t walk in my rehearsal with Ginny.”
"Now I wonder, are you sure Dad hated you at school, Paps?" Teddy asks me, sitting down in a chair, his lips smiling maliciously. "Surely with all the magic he let out just now, he would have put you in the infirmary more often."
"Zeph?" I call her when I see her stop, her head thrown to one side.
Only Friday Teddy came home, ready to enjoy his summer vacation.
I nod softly, taking the mug in my hands, and seating down in her rug. A rug that seems like some kind of odd state of art.
“Harry,” she says softly, seating next to Ron and pulling me to they both. Two pair of arms closing around me.
"Its a baby female," I let Dray knows. Then I watch him deliciously wrapped in my clothes. "What underwear are you wearing?" I ask trying to make him blush.
It's midnight and Dray is practically asleep on my shoulder. The moon illuminates the small clearing where Dray told me about each constellation that appeared in the sky and each star that is part of it and the stories behind each name. We are in a green open area outside London, and I can understand why he is so tire. We took the sub and then, a handful of busses and then we walked a few minutes to this beautiful place, a few minutes away from a small muggle village.
"Fred, George!" my mother yells again. "Stop poisoning my food. The table is for humans, not for animals. ”
"Yes," I reply after a few seconds of silence. "What are you exceptionally good at?" I ask him, looking into his blue eyes.
And so, I let the magic do all the job. When it is all done, I see the walls splattered with red, a mangled hand here and another mangled foot there.
"Lumos," Draco's wand emits a slight pearl light and takes a brief look. “Subvision,” and suddenly, tiny spots of light appear on James 'little face, to separate from the skin after a few seconds and create an exact replica of James' face.
“Because I had a murdered as a Father!” I turn around and my breathe start to hitch. “And if the dark lord asked my father for him to kill his own son, he surely would. Because he left his family behind in order to become a murder, a torturer. Who gave his heir a fucking magic strengthening potion to make his child a fucking weapon in the middle of a war?”  I feel my body trembling and my magic crackling around me. “Who made his son more appealing at the eyes of an uncaring, heartless snake whom was thirsty of blood?” I didn’t even remember taking so much steeps towards my father. “Who else would watch his son being raped in front of his face while laughing at the same time with his others peers because it was expected of him?” My hands close in a fist. “Answer me!”
"He's a bit angry about Ginny's joke a few moments ago," Harry tells me. And it is understandable. "He's hurt, Ginny's joke hurt him,” Harry tells me, looking towards the balcony of the house, where Dray has a black block stuck to his ear, while talking to it. Maybe. “He is a Muggle, Sirius. There are many things that he still doesn't understand that fascinate him some how and that makes it difficult for him to talk to me, sometimes," Harry answers me, his eyes darkening sadly. “And really, I don't care if I have to explain things to him a million times if that's what he wants, I only care that, for today, he feels comfortable with the people I consider my family. Although, I'm sure Ginny won't make this easy for me or him," Harry crosses his arms, a pout on his lips.
I see her face darkening and I am almost scared to ask.
Cross, one of the hit wizards raises his hand, holding the picture of the little house. “Isn’t this a work for the International Department of Auror’s Cooperations?” He asks, still looking at the photograph.
“If we follow your logical theory about cooking and potions being a kind of cousins, that explain your incapability to produce a decent potion, no matter in what grade we were at the moment,” she says and throw a smile at me.
“I want a raid in the sad town of Sussex this night,” he says. “All of you, but no Severus.”
"Over here are the bags of food for Occamies," says the girl, pulling me out of my own contemplation.
"Never mind, Dray is strong," I tell myself in an attempt to kill my own sadness. "We will be together for ever, for a long long time. He is mine and I am his," and my magic agreed fiercely. "We will live." I am determine to see us both trough this war.
"Who?" Kingsley asks, his hands shaking slightly.
There are a few things in the wax stamp. Two hands sustaining pansies in their hands. The flowers are shinning git gold glitter and a cape encase the hands and the plants.
“Then, you shall remain Master Severus until the day one of us dies,” I say to him, taking the basket into my hands and looking at my clothes, making sure they are pristine.
At Hogwarts.
“Keep going on, Draco,” he tells me. “You mother and I will be here to take care of you.”
"With all your heart," James replies. "I love you too, Papa."
When we get the Asset back, he can beat me into a dark place, inside our screwed-up head. But, for now. He has no fucking reign in this body.
I see him rub his eyes and fall into that state between sleep and awakening. His small hands, scrubbing the sleep out of his system and right away, I scurry in the shower, trying to keep it pure, even in my thoughts. I take the longest shower in my life, it's cold and one of the disadvantages of being in a place as cheap as this is that... There is no hot water.
And if Molly gets mad ... Ugh.
“Draco did this and she has no magical core left Ron. Even if we took her to St. Mungos it will be just matter of hours until she is gone in a painful way. She can be evil, but I am not evil enough to let her suffer that long,” I say to him. “At least, she doesn’t have to experiment the same pain they inflected over me and Dray.”
"Fenrir Grayback, Victor Goldman, Claire Warrington..." Ron whispers firmly, trying not to break the atmosphere of the room. "And Bellatrix Lestrange."
Draco lean his cheek on my shoulder and I can see his long lashes shinning gold.
"You are a magician," he tells me as if that explained many things, his voice a bit rough with sleep.
His hand finds mine and I squeeze back.
But, a clever orphan. With a promising future. A future that was forged by the hand of Abraxas Malfoy, who took him away from his crazy mother and filled him with tutors of the subjects he liked the most. The same man many rumored to be, he used the Dark Lord to complete her revenge against Lilly Evans and her traitorous husband, James Potter.
"We, unlike Muggles, Auror Potter, can restore things," Neekeal tells me. "Unspeakable magic level can transform a solid into a liquid again. While it is not a 100% true copy, it is better than nothing."
"Nox," I mumble and the light go out. I let my magic roam the room free, digging into every crack in the concrete. I let her, my magic, be alert for me and I look up to the pitch black ceiling.
"And you are?" I ask him, pressing Dray to my body.
"Dray," I call out to him in a whisper, taking a step back.
This chapter is over +2000 words and it took a lot of days to write, but here it is.
"It still hurts somedays," I tell him quietly, worry filling my chest.
“This is a fucking nightmare,” I whisper against his lips, waiting for his body to change, for the vision to present itself but none of that happens. “This must be, because there is no fucking way out there that you will ask for that.”
“I love you, did you know that, Harry?” he asks me. “And I love our daughter too. Does she know?”
Harry is dinning with his surrogate family, the Weasleys. Ron can tell something is off with his non-blood brother.
"Andromeda Tonks was only called to St. Helen in Warsaw because she was the only magical relative they could find back then." I say to Ron, as I look carefully at everything in front of us. "Back in that time, Bellatrix was in Azkaban and her mother was as dead as they can be. Andromeda offered to give me memories of the last times she saw Narcissa Black and the day she was called to St. Helen."
“I love you,” I whisper to him.
Parkinson turns red and I swallow the laughter that want to burst out of my mouth.
Have fun!!!!
Left comments and kuddos, they makes my day.
I immediately look at Ron and see him turn pale.
"I swear it, Ron, Harry has never dressed like this," Hermione murmurs into my ear as her eyes fall on Harry, or it could be Charlie. "I've never seen Harry dress like this before."
It's easy to forget that Harry is an exceptionally powerful wizard. Harry, the boy who always walks with his head down, hoping that no one will recognize him, but that in the midst of a public disaster that threatens people's lives is able to raise his head and offer himself as a sacrifice rather than let innocent people be slaughtered.
Because my husband is like this, a nice pain in the butt.
"Kreacher," I say seriously, and immediately the elf appears next to me.
However, the same mirror that showed little Dray hope is the same one that shows him how many bleeding bodies in the middle of his room.
“I did what?” I ask my soulmate in a whisper.
"Is the Auror department taking care of that already?" he asks, looking at Ron seriously.
I watch Dray come out of a huge building with white walls and chocolate bricks. His hair frames his pointy, smooth face as he walks steadily toward me. My eyes drop to where his hands are and...
“Fucking hell,” I say, while I put a portkey on him and I press a little button in pin I put on the younger brother of the Black-McMillan household.
I look ahead and immediately find it. The silver hair falling gently on his forehead and giving him a more fragile appearance. And at that very moment I see him, his face wrinkles in pain and his eyes crystallize.
I take a seat in front of Hannah once we are in a cafeteria table.
“This is not for the modblood,” Kreacher says seriously.
Draco
Raw, red, bleeding lines appears in his arms and face.
Draco's shoulders square and I watch him breathe and measure his steps and synchronize the way his arms move so that his weight is completely balanced between his arms and his good leg, the leg that was healed a few weeks ago resting lightly on the ground.
"You should, yes," I agreed with him. "You've sneezed a lot in the last few hours," I affirm, knowing it's a reality. Luna is as pale as Dray, and I can clearly see the passing of the onset of a cold on Draco's face, because it's the same as Luna used to have after walking through Hogwarts barefoot. "Come on, I'll make you hot chocolate if you promise to wear socks and a warmer sweater," I tell him, pulling away from him and putting one last kiss on his hair. Out of the corner of my eye, I can still see a lock of light blue hair intermingle in the silver strands and I smile at him. "What do you say, Nesha?" I ask the little occamy with a soft hiss. "Shall we hunt cockroaches?" I ask and immediately Nesha's attention falls on me.
"The pleasure is all mine, Dray," Madame Pomfrey tells her. "Harry," she tilts his head slightly towards me and McGonagall fixes her eyes on me.
"Dray, I'm going to take you to rest now," I say to the blond in a low tone, but he doesn't even seem to notice. He is out cold again.
Regulus looks at me with eyes so knowing and yet so indecipherable. And I feel comforted just by looking into them.
Hugs,
"Magdy," I reproach him. "You're supposed to be on my side, not Harry's side."
This is just a hallucination. They are dead, and never coming back.
"Is he still awake?" I ask Hannah, as we continue walking through the white corridors of St. Mungo’s.
"And he hasn't introduced us yet," Ron mutters, leaning his body against the elevator wall.
"You know that's a half truth, Regulus," the seer whispers to me. “If Draco feels his soulmate close, the person who is the one for him, his magic will prepare him to receive his other partner. His magic will try to be at the same magical level of the one his mate's. If he finds it, his magic will unfold faster in an attempt to measure up to the other.”
“You may be looking for Regulus,” she smiles up at us. Her hair is dyed in a neon green color. “My hair is a homage to all the things Salazar believed in.”
"Is that some kind of entrance to a cult you are part of?" Dray asks me, standing next to me, waiting. Until the bricks begin to move around and rotate on their axes to form a kind of arc. "Amazing."
"It wasn't the best," Dray tells me. “I got pretty wet after the recording ended. But at least my cello is fine,” he tells me and I notice the pink tint that his cheeks and nose are acquiring. "I should send a gift to Mr. Olivander, after all, he has been making my cello's since I was four."
“It's still very recent, Harry. The accident was less than a month ago. That he's walking without the aid of that cane is quite a feat,” Kingsley tells me and I force myself to believe him.
"I trust you, Harry," he whisper and I feel better.
And the next words from the Sorting Hat make my head spin.
I'm not a pureblood, nor I am the Harry raised by Muggle uncles. Because, I know the only reason Voldemort got an army of Death Eaters was for the simple fact that he knows how to explode one of their stronges and controversial points of morality: the blood status.
I laugh softly and walk down the long hallway to the bottom, until I reach door 3.
“The morning I took Dray to Grimmauld. I took us there because Rowle was at Lauren’s. And he was ready, a curse on the tip of his tongue. I'm sure of that."
"I will walk you to the garden," Harry says to Dray, taking his hand in his and guiding him out again. "Will you call us when dinner is ready?" Harry asks politely, but he seems troubled while leaving the kitchen.
"Yes," Dray says immediately with a smile on his face. “After you heal Nesha. She is very sick."
"Lucius," he tells me seriously. “I know you didn't mean to make your son or your wife bleed. But, you did the right thing,” he tells me, conjuring an ancient crystal. “This dust is your flesh and blood. That flesh that turned into dust, Lucius, is what has allowed your child to live a normal life and be filled with love and nurtured with mercy and pity, it is what has allowed him to be what this cursed world needs," he tells me, kneeling in front of me. "While it's true that Cissy decided to give her life to make everything easier, you also have to acknowledge your truth, Lucius."
Blaise sighs and turns serious as he sits at the desk in meeting room four.
"If you will let me finish washing your hair..." he says innocently and immediately tilts my head forward.
My son's little hands are holding on to my sweatshirt like a life preserver and I feel bad. I want my children to have everything Draco and I ever had and more. Once I let go, my gaze is focused on Draco's and I can immediately feel it in our link. Draco has something in mind.
I am sure Draco is about to go into a nervous breakdown, thinking that he has damaged our son in some way. Just as Lucius did to him.
Was, Harry. You are as normal as any wizard. But, even if Dray have the spark inside him, he is just a muggle. Anxiety inmediately make a spot for itself in my chest.
Left comments and kuddos, they makes my day better. And they help me a lot!
"No," I say, unable to help but feel completely at ease. "I am a man of veggies and fruits."
OCTOBER 19th, 2002
“That’s what friends are for,” she says and take sit by my side. “He looks really awful,” she says looking to the unconscious blond laying on a hospital bed.
“Why not?” I ask her, worry warming its way in my chest.
“Don’t worry about it, Draco,” she says and I can see a smile adorning her lips. “I will talk with your superior about everything, and I am pretty sure she will be happy to know you are actually out of hospital,” she pauses. “Do you need me to take something to her?” she asks, her brown eyes searching Draco’s body.
“We have to take him to Mungo’s,” I see him casting a spell over Malfoy, and it’s makes the bleed stops. “No one can touch him, since we don’t know if he is curse. Etasis,” the blond whispers and then, I see Malfoy floating. “I will need both of you.”
"We are sorry we intoxicated the food ..." says one of them.
"But for what other reason would you abandon those whom you have known all your life?” I ask to no-one.
But, this night seems magnificent to post despite the lack of sleep this week.
The healer looks at the photo and I see her hit it with her wand.
I am here. A bit late due to illness, but ok.
“If you can feel it, then you can also feel that his magic is not strong. That of a fetus is stronger,” I say in a serious tone. "The person up there is a mystery. However, his name is Dray. Dray Black,” I tell them in a serious tone.
I let my magic wander out of my own body, my tight leash on it diminishing, while I keep shaking the blond awake. Bright, emerald tendrils of magic enveloping softly the body under me.
“Are they gonna play quidditch?” she looks where all the wizards and witches are gearing up.
"Remember to arrive like any Muggle, preferably in a taxi," Dray tells us in a serious tone. "Now, I need one of you to do the magic trick that teleports you from one place to another in order to get there on time," Dray says in a serious tone.
“I need Nesha awake,” I say to no one in particular. Then, suddenly, my eyes are looking up at Hagrid, and he must be scared the fuck of me. “Wake her up.”
"Apparently not, Professor," I tell her and smile at her. "But, this is better than the previous years, isn't it?" And if we compare that in previous years, every year there has been an assassination attempt against me, this is almost normal. "At least now I'm happy."
Dumbledore and Scamander are close friends. But… Scamander might now the Lestrange. Scamander knows them.
"I know. I can feel the little spark of our blood inside him. However, I never saw him at Hogwarts," she says, still keeping her eyes on the beautiful blond. "I think he is a Squib."
Draco manipulates the image with his wand and suddenly I see it.
“You just slept the morning away, my Dragon,” she says to me and her hand caress my cheeks. “It is time to wake up, Draco. We have a lot of things to do today.”
“It will be quick,” I mumble softly.
"Why were you angry?" I ask him, when the silence is enought.
“Why?” I ask her.
"Ugh Harry," he says to me, looking away. "I don't want to know anything about who you have sex with."
"We talk with McGonagall," Hemrione says. "She would know whatever Profesor Snape didn't. And what he knew, Moody knows."
The nods of people I have barely know, agreeing to keep us safe, a couple of elementals elves, just because Harry asked. Just because is essential for the survivor of the people they love a lot.
Whatever it was, it doesn’t matter anymore.
I will always be there for him, but there cannot be a relationship without trust. And while I know that Dray is capable of kissing even the deadliest creature on the planet (Nesha and Python Choralis E are proof of that), I need Dray to trust himself so he can trust me, and vice-versa. Because if not, this relationship is going to be very screwed up, and even if it is not our intention, one of us can get hurt if we do not remedy this soon.
I place my arm in front of Hermione trying to stop her from opening her mouth. Draco is obviously not with us. He is somewhere else.
(See the end of the chapter for
The hat laughs again, heartfully.
More than thirty people are standing around this room. This odd room that seems to get bigger while people keep coming and cushions keep appearing on the floor. A few tables are full of finger food and a few windows are appearing now.
Over my shoulder I see Harry smiling at me, as I play with the glass of water on the table. A smile is crushed against his lips, as he struggles not to laugh.
I nod slowly.
I sigh and drop into the chair behind me.
"Yup," I pause looking at him and I swallow the lump in my throat. Regulus still have to tell him the thruth, but first we have to find out what Dray's powers really are and how being an Argentum can affect Dray's personality. This magic inside him is still dormant, that's the reason we are here, just to see if this place can awake it.
“How do you know?” I whisper.
In it, Draco and I are in the living room lounge sofa, I am on my back and Draco's atop of me, his blonde head under my chin. I am holding open a manila folder, proves that it is auror material; Draco with a small book. At one point Draco jerks his head up, his lips pouting, and my lips descend on his briefly.
"Why?" he asks me, a curious look on his face.
I turn around and look at the three of them.
GreeneySilvery
I feel like if I had one too many concussions to last me a thousand lives.
Never matter that. Ron grips Zephora's wrist with his own. His blue eyes fixed on her and her old magic.
I retract part of my own magic into my chore. Dray have been feeding our bond with too much love for the last twenty-four hours or so. He’s not in pain, but he is exhausted and our bond is making it more terrible for him then for me. I can feel his exhaustion tapping softly against my chore, his consciousness is a caressing wave against my fiery ocean.
"Wait, what?" I ask them, but they are both focused on Malfoy.
Dray looks at me with a surprised grin that then transforms into a strange smile, but one that makes him look extremely sweet.
“A rogue Argentum,” Moody says, scaring the shit out of me. “Because they are similar to these odd creatures.”
“If you weren’t alive, will you have left the same instruction for me to complete?” I ask him, gripping the book tightly.
"Do you remember the hat attack on your fashion sense?" I ask him and his eyes immediately fill with knowledge, and then outrage.
(See the end of the chapter for
I glanced up.
“This thing you are experiencing is the second phase of your bond,” Madame Pomfrey tells us, as her wand moves above our heads and I see several silver threads connect with threads that look like gold… Like gold inside a foundry, with that intense orange touch. "This is what ties you both together, which is quite a bit," the woman gives us a serious look and I feel small again. “You will have to work on this as well. But now, first thing first. You will work on your magical connection,” Madame Pomfrey says, reaching out to help me up. I take it between mine and smile at the matron. However, the growl coming from Harry's throat makes me look down and Madame Pomfrey lets go as quickly as possible, as Harry's magic thunders around his body. "He's yours, Harry," she tells him. "And I do not pose any threat to you or to the bond you both share." However, Harry's magic only fades once Madam Pomfrey takes a step back.
Sure, we have been playing dating for Saint Mungo's lately. But Draco knows about my feeling and I know about his. I have been itching to take him out on a date for real. A sweet, long fancy date.  Taking him to an expensive restaurant in the Wizarding World, something worthy of the sweet tooth of one Draco Malfoy. Somewhere where people feel bold enough to take a picture of me and the beautiful blond. Somewhere that will make our fake-nearly-true relationship, a real thing. Somewhere that would give me a chance to claim Draco as mine, and mine only.
"Does it bother you if I invite a few more people?" Dumbledore's words catch my attention and immediately, my eyes land on the fireplace.
