Hari does know. Hari knows because they’re the only pet Draco has ever imagined himself getting. He also knows that a large part of the reason Draco likes cats is because if they’re big enough, they’ll chase the peacocks, and maybe even nab one here and there. Draco has told him this before.
“We will!” the group choruses and they head out to the next shop. Pansy snatches the list of measurements from Hermione and glares at Hari.
“I’m going to go run around the Jungle Room for a bit,” Hari jumps up, “I’ll be back soon.” They wave him off and keep giggling to themselves. Hari rolls his eyes and strolls out.
“There’s one more room,” Hari steps out of the doorway to let her cross to the final door. Her gasp lets him know everything he needs. The bedroom is deep shades of purple with accents of lavender and cream. There’s a large wardrobe, chest of drawers, and vanity along the walls but the bed itself takes up the majority of the room.
“Would you like to come back with me?” The cat meows and rubs their cheeks together. Hari glances to Critter. “Could I see Galeru now?”
“That’s… a really good point,” Hari smiles at Draco, then turns back to scrutinizing the town, “I always just assumed Diagon was the most easily accessible for us.”
“All the stairs up is being hidden,” Critter tells them, “but there is being more than one because only one would be a safety hazard. Lord James’ great grandfather is saying that.”
“Lord Potter,” Fudge turns to face him. Hari stares dispassionately. “I’m sorry, but I cannot justify withdrawing the Dementors.”
“Yes,” Hari nods, “I would think that it would be possible for her to teach both first and seventh years during the year this year, then take the month of July for fifth and sixth, and August for my year and the year above. She would then do one more year of first and third years and implement the government class after two years, instead of three.”
“I call the victim to the floor.” Master Tomeaxe neglects to address Hari by name and it makes his hands tremble. This, here, is the moment of truth. Will his Wizengamot sessions ever be normal? Hari closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, catches Draco’s eyes for just a moment, then rises. His steps are slow and measured and he ignores the whispering, focusing entirely on Narcissa’s steady gaze. When he reaches the floor, she nods slightly and he turns around. The whispering has faded, but the look on Dumbledore’s face is what really drives out his nerves.
“You and I,” Draco gestures between them, then yanks Hari into his lap, “are already doing our part.”
“Either way, Miss Monroe was kind in offering her help and someday, I hope to repay her in kind.” Hari pushes open the door to the clothing shop. “Besides, there are other reasons she could need to contact me.”
He keeps his eyes straight ahead. This allows Hari to watch the moment Dumbledore sees him. The man’s face goes red from rage under his beard, pinching hilariously. There’s shock and awe written there, too. Pride swells in Hari. He’s made it.
Ayyy another chapter! Stuff has happened in my writing! I think I might actually be able to wrap up book three pretty soon, but it will definitely be pushing at least 70k. I'm pleased with that :D    I'm also excited to start book four because, well, Umbridge, right?
“Everyone got it?” Draco asks. There’s affirmatives all around and the others pack up. “Let’s go, then. Bedtime.”
Hari descends the steps to the floor, the first Lord, Lady, Heir, or Representative in the room to move. He pauses at the center just long enough for Draco, Daphne, Pansy, and Blaise to catch up. They fall in step with each other, Hari’s fingers curled through Draco’s and Blaise’s arm around his shoulder with the girls flanking them. Hermione meets up with them and they walk three by three, the boys in front, and Pansy and Daphne crowding Hermione behind them. They move swiftly through the hall until they reach the port-key room.
“Don’t forget that you have to go back to collect your materials,” Blaise warns. “We’re not required to.”
“Hari, it’s the Ministry,” Draco sighs, “the process for creating a port-key isn’t as difficult as they like to make it out to be, but it can’t be traced as easily as apparitioin or floo, so they put in all this red tape to make it harder to have access to. Just, answer the questions the best you can and lie if you need to. They don’t check and it won’t damage the port-key if you do.”
“Yeah,” a Slytherin agrees slowly, “but I don’t think they’re bad. There’s those new electives—I’m in Healing and it’s going to give me a leg up when I get my apprenticeship. And the Heirs and Lord Potter getting to use their Family Suites? They pay a lot of money for that and Dumbledore has barred access for ten years.”
“Or we could go check out some of my properties,” Hari adds. They’d all seen and transformed Potter Cottage into Moony’s ideal living space, but had yet to have the chance to visit anywhere else.
“There’s a dangerous wizard who has escaped police custody,” Hari jumps in, “One of our friends was crucial in his initial arrest. We’re putting wards at all our houses.”
“Good. I got one I’d like, too. We’ll trade and read them,” Draco smiles sweetly, “Mother gave me the idea. She said we’d learn a lot about each other that way.”
. A series of several, very small, almost-mandala circles connected with dots extending from the very tip of her middle finger down the back of her hand. The final piece is what looks like a large mandala that’s been quartered, so only one portion is visible, arching over her wrist. Hari listens absently to the conversations around him.
Hari sighs, “yeah, well, it means I get carried around, so I’d be fine if you were a little less of a spoiled brat.”
I got somewhere around two hundred comments in the period of time I've been gone, so I'm not even going to try to reply to everyone individually. I want to thank everyone for their kind words about the fic. I'm really glad everyone likes it as much as you do. And to everyone who offered their support while I was struggling, thank you so, so very much. It really means so much to me and helped me push through that much quicker.
The minute that Runes ends, the group makes their way up to the R.O.R to get started on their homework. When they arrive, Luna is already outside, waiting for them.
“You look stunning tonight, Hari,” Draco starts, taking up a bite-sized chocolate piece. “And your hands are gorgeous. Sirius outdid himself tonight.”
Pansy flips open her planner and starts rattling off assignments. Hari pulls out all the necessary notes. He peeks over at Luna, working calmly at her own desk just a little apart from the group. Obviously, she couldn’t work in the circle with them since she’s a year younger and doesn’t have the same assignments, but he feels bad seeing her sit there alone.
Hari thinks about this for a long moment, then says, “I can understand not wanting someone with different views than you to be in charge. However, I think it’s beneficial if the Chief Warlock isn’t a Lord or Lady. In fact, I think they shouldn’t even be part of a House. It would prevent them from being biased and prejudiced. But from what I’ve heard of Madam Bones, she’s able to maintain neutrality even when faced with people her House is pitted against. She’s fair and she’ll hear everyone out equally.”
“We is going to the other doors now, Master Hari,” Critter tells them and takes them to the doors between the two stairways. Once opened, they reveal a large, open library, nearly three stories tall. The center is entirely open and there’s balconies wrapping around each level to provide safe access to all the books. There’s plush carpeting everywhere and plenty of chairs, couches, desks, and window seats to spend a lifetime in the room without ever leaving. Critter lets them look for a few minutes, then says, “Would Master Hari be wanting to see the upstairs?”
“Oh, Hari,” she breathes, “yes, yes, it’s all absolutely alright.” Hari takes in a shaking breath. “Listen, sweetheart, it’s okay, you’re okay. Whatever you want to be, whomever you want to be with, it’s
“Except for the tester,” Luna chimes in. Draco glances at her. “She was going to ask,” Luna shrugs. Draco makes quick eye contact with Blaise, Pansy, and Daphne.
“Oh, Merlin,” Hari looks out the window, “so these things are checking the train for him? Are they even allowed to do that?”
The morning of the next Wizengamot session, Hari is watching Draco rip through his closet, complaining that Hari has a ‘severe lack of clothes’. Hari has pointed out on several occasions that everything is new and they just went shopping, but Draco is having none of it. Apparently, the outfit needs to be ‘perfect’.
“I will be finding time to speak with you on how to arrange long-brewing potions,” Professor Snape adds. Hari nods in agreement. There’s many ways they could go about it, but none of them are particularly sound.
Hari nods to the adults around them, “If you’ll excuse me a moment, I see some other guests I must greet.”
“That’s one of the most incredible things anyone’s ever done for me,” Hari tells her, “thank you. Thank you so much.” He leans back and laughs, a little watery, “I will definitely come to you with questions. If you’ve studied as much as I think you have, you’re practically an expert.”
“Pleased to see you too, Lord Nott.” Hari turns slightly to gesture to Hermione, “Have you met Miss Hermione Granger?”
Draco knocks gently on the door. Hari pauses, counting to ten before opening the door. Draco’s eyes skim over Hari, looking him up and down in a smooth movement.
“You’re quite agile, aren’t you, Beau?” Draco rubs between his ears and the others offer pets and praise, too. Beau puffs up under the attention.
“Both of whom only have good things to say about you,” he assures her and extends his hand. After the general niceties are out of the way, the chime rings through the Ministry.
“You’re so kind and caring and you’ve built this family around you despite everything you’ve been through,” Draco finishes. “You’re honestly incredible and beautiful, inside and out.”
“Quite understanding of them,” Professor Snape’s lips curl slightly, “I do not know if I could be quite so kind were I your friend.”
“Probably,” Draco agrees. “Carriage?” They look over to where the carriages should be and realize they’ve been out later than planned. Hari sighs and holds out his hand, activating the port-key without hesitation. They arrive in the Entrance Hall to see Professor Snape scowling down at them. Hari has the sudden urge to transform and run off.
“And your obstacles crumbled,” Hari rises and bows in unison with his friends. Theo has caught on to the process, as has Lord Malfoy and the others’ parents. Everyone else looks on confused.
“Does it matter which way it goes?” Hermione asks. “Or are we pretty much looking at guaranteed punishment?”
Hari smiles at her, “that would be wonderful, thank you so much.” Hari extends a hand to her and they clasp wrists. “Lord Hari James Potter, at your service. Please, feel free to contact me if you ever need anything.” He pauses, then adds, “there’s wards to prevent fan mail from getting through, so be sure to address it to go to Gringotts, not Hogwarts, okay?”
None of the other Ministry members will be voted into the top ten. That’s a given. When it comes down to it, the Ministry will vote for one of its own. That will let Hari maintain his lead.
“We’re dating,” Draco announces with a beaming smile. Hari giggles and tucks himself under Draco’s chin, a little embarrassed. “We have been since the night of the Summer Ball.”
“No, not guaranteed,” Hari says, “with the perp’s power, if they’re tried in the wix world, it’s likely they’ll weasel their way out. We want them to end up charged in the goblin community.”
“Yeah, it’s an important topic,” Hari agrees, “but I don’t know if I want to listen to her talk for two hours.”
“No,” Sirius shakes his head, “that would’ve broken when the Secret Keeper died, which was years ago.”
“Have you informed the parents of this decision?” Hari asks, voice innocently curious. “I’m interested as to how Lord Malfoy, Lord Nott, Lord Flint, Lady Longbottom, and Lady Bulstrode will feel about this. You did, of course, make sure to let the Board know of your decision, didn’t you? It was just the Headmaster—myself—you overlooked?”
“They can’t be,” Draco mutters, “If Hari hasn’t given the okay, Hogwarts can’t be touched. That’s the one thing about Hogwarts that’s so appealing to everyone: it’s technically sovereign ground. No government can touch it, even if the people within are held to the Ministry’s laws.”
“All those in favor of discarding this bill.” The tapping is louder now and Hari knows they have won this round. Of course, he didn’t have any doubt originally, but this only confirms it.
“Spectacular,” Hari huffs and angrily takes a bite of chocolate cake. It’s moist and perfect and the frosting is divine. “Well, enjoy your extra half hour with the dessert table.” He glares at Draco who seems all too smug.
“Some blood-purity guy,” Draco groans. “I thought we were past that. Honestly, I thought he never even believed in it.”
Hari knows his eyes must be shining with excitement and that he’s not masking it well, but he can’t help it.
Hermione arrives first and they’re assaulted under a barrage of questions. Hari manages to halt those questions for a few minutes, however, when he stands and takes a small owl out of its cage.
“Dementors guard Azkaban, Hari,” Daphne tells him, voice gentle. “They literally suck the happiness out of you and cause you to be entrenched in bad memories. They’re the things that almost drove Sirius crazy.”
“Thanks,” Hermione smiles, “Mum and Dad got it for me as an early birthday gift. It’s featherweight and bottomless.”
“Would you be able to take a look at Hermione’s feet?” Hari winces, looking incredibly like a guilty puppy. “I forgot to cushion her shoes before we came.”
Blaise drags him off until they’re standing in front of a tall, imposing woman who radiates inner strength. “Mother, this is Lord Potter. I’d list his Houses but we don’t have time. And you definitely already know them. Hari, my mother, Lady Zabini of the House Zabini.”
“Never,” Draco vows. Hari lets himself relax in Draco’s arms and soon, has fallen asleep to the sound of Draco’s heart beating.
“Yes,” Hari says slowly, “but I’m not certain she would have been comfortable with this. I mean, homes like this are pretty rare in the muggle world.”
“Won’t your parents be upset with you ruining your appetites?” Fortescue frowns at them from behind the counter.
“Narcissa suggested it,” Hari tells her, “she thought you’d like to get to watch since you want to be Minister someday.”
Draco stares at him for a long moment, eyes wide, before breathing, “Loony Lovegood…” He shakes his head, “yes, they could. They most often do, to be honest, until someone recognizes it as Seeing.”
At the end of the story, Draco rolls to toss the book on his bedside table and then tugs Hari into his arms.
“As is first on our agenda,” Dumbledore begins and Hari opens the file on his desk. He’d reviewed the papers within before coming, studying Lucius’ copy.
“Well,” Blaise corrects, “it’s not actually a court case. It’s a petition from the goblins to receive the right to arrest a wix and try them under goblin law.”
“I’m not sure if I’m happy or sad about that, but I can use it to my advantage, so I won’t complain,” Hari says.
“Yes, well, my love life is much more boring. I’m not even sure I like him and I haven’t seen any signs he likes me.”
“You’re right,” he says, “I should go. It’s important and could impact too many lives, including Remus’.”
“I know this is hard and difficult to process,” she murmurs, “and you have to override years of experiences, but please, do yourself a favor, and ask Draco to dance. Or indicate you’d like him to ask you.”
A rumbling chuff comes from her right. Ajay strolls out of the vegetation and nuzzles her hip with his nose.
“No. Not at all.” Hari lets out a sigh of relief. Flipping between two extreme personalities will cause him to be viewed as a wild-card. It will make it hard for people to prepare to face him, not knowing which persona he’ll walk in as on any given day.
Despite the fact he’d been mumbling that it’s too early to be awake for the last five minutes, Draco pops right up and out of bed.
“What a load of hogwash,” the toad in pink is crying as she shoves past him, “just because the brat can’t take any discipline.”
“Do you want me to read for a bit or would you rather just go to sleep?” Draco curls into the bed next to Hari, holding a book of short stories they’d been reading lately.
“If it isn’t indicated on this letter,” Hari taps the small pile, “then it will be on the ones coming in. If you could search those the same way, that would save you time. And ensure we’ve gotten it all correct.”
“Lord Potter,” Lucius snaps, “your opinions?” Lucius is glaring slightly at him. Hari tries not to wince. He has no clue who was being discussed.
On the floor—he practically chokes. One of the couples is two women. He glances at Draco and flicks his eyes over to draw his attention to the couple. Draco’s eyes widen, then he smiles softly and nods understandingly.
“While you work on Muggle Studies, Hari and I’ll research for Potions and History respectively,” Hermione adds, “And then, if there’s still time, we can pick up a book on red oak. Or even just find the title.”
“We did,” Daphne laughs. “We figured no one would mind if our friend ate with us.” Hari gives a sharp look to the other heirs in the room, daring them to argue with Hermione’s presence. They look away and say nothing.
Lucius is called down next. He explains the rage he felt at the idea that a wix child could ever be treated like that and how he couldn’t initially comprehend that it had been caused on purpose.
“Good,” Professor Flitwick grins, teeth slightly sharp. “It was creating a rift with the ranked students to lose their titles.”
“I am,” Hari confirms, eyeing him warily. Fudge may have been on his side last meeting, but the man is notorious for being… flighty.
Daphne comes down next and, in describing what it felt like to go get Draco, has Hari’s heart breaking for her.
“Of course. If you ever need something clarified, I’d be more than willing to answer your questions,” Hari nods, giving the slightest smile and taking his seat again. He glances over to Lucius and Draco. Lucius is ‘coughing’ into his hand and Draco is turning pink and shaking from the effort of holding in his laughter.
“About a year and a half ago, it was brought to the goblins’ attention that a great disservice had been done to one of your own,” Master Tomeaxe begins and the whispers stop. “The fact that we goblins, through our complacency, allowed this to occur is the reason I stand before you today and not a wix solicitor.
“The Ministry makes no distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex couples in marriage,” Draco informs him, “children are a little more complicated and I don’t know all the details, but I did a little research, anticipating this question.
Hari realizes then why Draco assumes the two shops he wants to visit will take all afternoon. They’re both horribly slow at picking new books.
So they fill her in on the night they got together, taking their time, but skimming past the kiss as quickly as possible. There’s still lots of blushing and avoiding eye contact and squealing friends involved, though. By the time the whole story has been told, the group is a mess of giggles and happy congratulations. Then, a chill washes over the train.
“Two years ago, on the day after the students arrived at Hogwarts, a student of Slytherin House knocked at my quarters, appearing frantic. They informed me that they didn’t know exactly what was wrong, but that one of their friends had seen something and sent them to tell me. This friend had asked that the victim be seen by Madam Pomfrey as discreetly as possible, so as to not reveal that they had told.” It’s the first time Hari is hearing this and his eyes flash to Draco. Daphne had stepped out of the bathroom. Draco was gone when he exited the bathroom. It’s hard to be mad, though, when it probably saved his life. “The list of evidence I was provided with as a basis for concern was the victim’s extreme effects of undernutrition and the fact they had never been taught to properly spell their name.
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Count of House Gaunt, by Right of Conquest. So mote it be.” The last of the green magic swirls around him, then fades away.
The doors seal for the last time that evening and papers are already on the small stand in front of Hari’s seat. He flips the file open to read over the agenda.
“Oh, no you don’t,” Professor Snape sets him on the desk and bars his escape, locking the door with a flick of his wand. “Change back, now. You know it’s my free period and I know you’re not taking either Care or Muggle Studies.”
“According to Dumbledore,” Hari corrects. “According to the elves, they’re bored as they are now and would be grateful to have Filch removed so they can properly do their jobs.”
A young, tall (for his species), and powerful looking goblin rises and strides to the center of the floor. He bows to the Wizengamot, “may your gold have grown.”
“We are!” He flops down next to Draco and leans into him. Draco’s arms automatically wrap around him and he finds himself pulled directly onto Draco’s lap. Hari snuggles in further and sends a quick smile at Daphne.
“We need to go visit Granger,” Draco declares, “the Fall Festival Ball is usually a week before we leave for school, which gives us only about two weeks to get her ready for it.”
“Works for me,” Hari grins, then thumbs his Slytherin ring and calls, “Hogwarts.” The swirling lasts only for a moment, ending when he lands in the Entrance Hall.
Hari bursts into hysterical giggles, “it will be on the agenda for the next session. Although, it’s labeled as something about goblins, instead.”
“The problem, Lord Flint, is that that leaves our current seventh years out of the loop, as they would not be able to take it after graduation.”
At the shop, they spend nearly a half hour debating over which bags to get. Hermione’s is a gorgeous maroon over-the-shoulder bag with bronze detailing. Blaise decides to go with a metallic style and gets a bronze bag with black etching of the same style. Draco gets his in a soothing gray dragon leather with silver etchings. Pansy’s and Daphne’s look more like purses. Pansy’s is a sweet, blush pink with gold detailing and Daphne’s is a baby blue with silver detailing. Hari ends up getting an over-the-shoulder bag, as well, in black leather with blue and green etchings and silver clasps.
“They will come,” Critter says and snaps his fingers twice. The kneazles slink away from the walls and there’s nearly a hundred around him. “The mama and the newborns is not coming.”
“Perhaps that is something that could be left to the Heads of Houses?” Hari offers. “I hesitate to pair them up before they arrive at Hogwarts. There is too much likelihood of personalities clashing. Instead, why not wait two weeks to let them adjust somewhat, and then assign pairs. They can do their work for wizarding culture together.”
“All those in favor of passing this bill.” The room is silent except for the sound of wands being tapped on arms of the seats.
Blaise practically wails, whining about how she’d betrayed him and why she couldn’t just let him have that one moment. Daphne smirks at him and watches him rage at her with an amused gleam in her eye.
“Okay, well, I don’t feel the need to look at those,” Hari sighs, “since I presume I won’t be using them, at least not any time soon. Let’s just see the Lord’s suite and study.”
“Guys, you have to see the closet,” Blaise calls. They walk over and see a room larger than what Hari’s bedroom at the Dursley’s was. The center has four extra walls that reach to the ceiling and are layered with shelves and drawers for shoes and jewelry. Drawers along the outer walls have slots for ties and pocket squares and socks.
Hari shakes his head, “no. I know I have to decide soon, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it to miss a day of school for this one.”
It was beginning to do this after dropping Arithmancy that taught Hari that Professor Snape is not the cruel teacher he seems to be to the younger years. After OWLs, he has students who really want to be in his class. He loses the harsh attitude and takes the time to ensure they’re learning and enjoying the class as much as possible. Although, some of the students had commented that Professor Snape was more relaxed this year… Maybe that’s because he’s got more free time.
Pansy shoots Theo a look, “she is, isn’t she?” Her voice is kind of sharp and Hari realizes it’s the same look Draco has whenever Hari hugs someone else.
“I was placed in this home on the basis that I would one day need to be willing to sacrifice myself, be a martyr, because the person who left me there thought my death would be the only way to remove the soul from my scar. If I was ‘rescued’ and given love, the way this person intended, and then informed the love is conditional on the basis I go out to save the world, I would have willingly done it. This person withheld from me not only my property as listed by Griphook, but also my rights, and attempted to manipulate me out of free choice.” Hari tilts his head pleadingly, “Please, allow these charges to be filed so that this never happens to another child. Make an example of this person so no other wix ever feels the sense of entitlement they do. Protect our future.” Hari looks from Blaise’s proud face, to Daphne’s determined one, to Theo’s pleased and contemplative look. All good signs. “Thank you for your time.” He bows and steps away, taking the stairs back to his seat. Once there, he raises the privacy screen preventing sound from entering and leans back with a sigh.
“I’m afraid I cannot allow you to arrest me,” Dumbledore says, his tone truly apologetic. He whistles a short pattern and there comes a warbling cry from outside the doors. As soon as they open, Dumbledore raises his arms and clutches onto the talons of a swooping red bird. There’s a burst of flame and he’s gone.
“I thought of that, but I figured her sense of morality would outweigh her loyalty to them,” Hari smirks, “and if it doesn’t, I’ll just vote against the Ministry.”
“She’s pureblood,” Draco mutters, “and I know I’ve heard her name before…” Hari leans up and kisses Draco on the cheek.
“We do,” Draco confirms. Remus nods and pushes Hari gently back to Draco, who’s arms are extended, waiting.
“Lord Potter,” she comes out of the bow and turns slightly, bowing again. “Heirs Malfoy, Greengrass, Parkinson, and Zabini.”
“Right,” Hari nods and straightens his tie once more, “I’m ready.” They walk down to the floo room just in time; Hermione steps out moments later.
.” He’d looked up the word and turns out, it translates to home. They’re whisked away to Potter Manor.
Aaaand I'm back. Sorry, that was what, three days? Today being the fourth? Whoops. Okay, but I don't really feel too bad about that. This miss was mostly because of writer's block, which I mentioned before. On the upside, I just wrote an entire chapter in about an hour and a half. And I have ideas for the next chapter and how the last few of the book will go. The best news? This fic has officially broken the 60k mark, reaching just shy of 65k. It's officially the longest of the series!
“With permission from the Headmaster, I suppose,” Hermione nods. Hari pales and his eyes flash almost frantically to her.
“Fry-up,” Draco grins at Hari, “figured you could use the extra fuel. It’ll be a stressful day, I’m sure.” Draco snaps his fingers once and their plates appear on the small table.
permission to so much as step foot in these wards, let alone send Dementors here.” Fudge goes pale, just then realizing Hari had actually studied this. “I believe those charges would include trespassing, attempted false arrest, and human rights infringement. What, fifteen years in Azkaban? If the court chooses to be lenient?”
“Despite your insincerity, Miss Umbridge, I accept your apology. I hope our next meeting will be more friendly.” He steps past her and strides over to where he sees Daphne. She bows and turns to walk with him, keeping time easily.
Hari’s heart stutters and his stomach squirms. He sips his hot chocolate, letting his eyes drop so Draco can’t see how embarrassed he is.
“It is,” Critter confirms. There are three doors on the other side and one at the end of the hall. “These are being the nursery and two studies. The Head of House’s study is being at the end of the hall.”
“He made me promise I’d teach you,” Hari says, “I think he misses having a big family to take care of.”
“I don’t want to go to Azkaban,” the wizard growls. Hari lets out a real growl that has the man shaking.
“Yes. It should be pre-cut,” Daphne nods, pleased. Hari takes the smallest piece he can find and Draco does the same. Within ten minutes, they’re loading up their plates at the dessert buffet.
“Dray,” Hari looks at him and pouts, trying to look as innocent and sad as possible. He sniffles for good measure. “You don’t really mean that, do you?”
“What happened?” Draco jumps up and grabs Hari as soon as he’s back in the compartment. He pulls him down onto his lap again.
In moments, the magical creature is taken down, pinned beneath his fangs and claws. He releases it and watches the magic within fix the toy so it can stand and go off to be a target once more.
“Only if you’ll call me Blaise.” They grin at each other and Blaise leans in to whisper conspiratorially in Hari’s ear, “If you don’t want to be mobbed, stay out here. Also, my mother would like to meet you.”
“Perhaps the most unforgivable action was attempting to beat the magic out of me.” This is the shift. He can see it in the corner of their eyes. Displeased disbelief shifts into horror. Yes, it is horrifying that a child might be beaten, but a wix child being beaten for their gift? The Wizengamot will not stand for that. “Any signs of accidental magic and I would be whipped with a belt until I passed out. The problem with attempting to beat a magical child for their accidental magic is that it only makes the magic stronger, even if it was bound twice, as mine was up until I saw Healer Ripclaw just over a year ago. Accidental magic is an in-born protection system for wix who cannot yet wield their magic. Violence only makes it more desperate to protect the child. This created an endless cycle.
“Anyone want to tell me how so many people know I’m Heir Hogwarts but haven’t figured out I’m the new ‘Headmaster’?”
This is a long way to say that I'm re-writing this. I love the concept and the friendships within it. There likely won't be many changes beyond pacing and stylistic choices. (Okay, I'm changing a
“That…” Lucius looks at him thoughtfully, “might just work. Hogwarts is capable of expanding the dormitories as needed as it has built-in extension charms.”
“Hari’s the reason we’ll all be referred to by title again,” Draco adds, “and we get our Family Suites.”
“Yeah, but this place is historic,” Hari argues, “and I don’t know the spells used to keep it like this or how they lasted for this long.”
“What about my home?” Hermione asks fearfully. “Dumbledore knows I’m close to all of you, what if he goes for my parents?” Although Hari knows Sirius can be insensitive and immature at times, he’s not surprised when his godfather manages to pull himself together to behave as an adult for this.
“I trust you.” Once Hari is dressed in the threatening outfit, Draco waves his wand twice. The first spell drags Hari’s hair up in a series of braids that end in a low ponytail. The second is Hari’s make-up, which is sleek and dark this time. The liner around his eyes is slightly darker and his lashes as long as the previous session. His lips are darker, with the pink only as an undertone. There’s extra make-up, too, to make his cheekbones sharper and strip away some of his childish appearance. Hari studies his appearance in the mirror. The robes cling to him before widening at his waist and splitting open at mid-thigh. His trousers are more fitted than usual and his black formal boots complete the look. Overall, he looks rugged and somewhat dangerous.
“Well,” Pansy grimaces, “that’s not entirely wrong, either. We do usually have tutors from age five on who instruct us in all the theory they can, as well as writing, reading, arithmetic, history, and government. And etiquette.” The whole group winces at that.
Bill Weasley’s testimony is interesting and definitely has everyone’s attention, as he is the only one who had truly seen the conditions Hari had lived in. He receives so many questions, Master Tomeaxe has to cut them off to prevent accidentally revealing Hari’s identity.
“It’s different,” Hari says, “it’s more of a safety piece. You get the information you might’ve gotten in Care, without direct interaction with any creatures. It’s just: this is what’s dangerous and this is how to protect yourself from it. And now, Defense can be primarily focused on spells, creatures, and what Beasts doesn’t cover.”
“Pettigrew got out,” Blaise confirms, “and they’re thinking he’s coming to Hogwarts to get back at you.”
“They,” Draco coughs a little, “provide the genetic material, which is then combined into a donated, blank egg. There is then one of two options. A potion can be used to cause one of the men to develop the appropriate organ to carry the child himself. Or an artificial womb can be used, one outside their person. The second is the most common option and is actually sometimes used by other couples, who don’t technically need assistance with fertility. It’s a safe alternative to being pregnant in public. The womb can be cared for at home and the parents can carry on with their usual lives without changing their habits.”
“I would suggest a scion of a House, someone raised with our culture, but who can be sensitive to muggleborn’s difficulty transitioning.”
“Mom, Dad,” Hermione looks up at them, “he got me political lessons and his friend’s mom sent me that handwriting book. Because of him, I can go see Wizengamot sessions. That’s the governing body,” she explains hurriedly, then continues, “He’s also going to connect our house to the floo so I can see all my school friends without disturbing you.”
“Lord Potter is a terribly strong soul,” she tells the Wizengamot, “When I heard what had happened, I expected a broken little thing to show up at our Manor. Someone who needed constant care and supervision and to be treated like glass.
“Quit being a baby,” Draco rolls his eyes, “go shower and I’ll get you an outfit. Some combination of red and green that won’t make you look like an ugly Christmas decoration.”
Draco enters the room a minute later, perfectly put together and Prince mask perfectly in place. He sits in his desk next to Hari and calmly draws out his books. Hari glances at Pansy and shoots her a grateful smile.
“Draco, that doesn’t mean we have to be this early,” Hari argues. “We’re just going to have to stand there and do nothing until the others arrive.”
“From this moment, let it be known, Hermione Jean Granger stands with Lord Hari James Potter in his House and under his protection,” Draco calls, setting a hand over their clasped ones.
“I… think I can do most of that. Definitely the sweets,” Hari taps his fingers on the back of her hand, “but we were supposed to be talking about you.” Adjusting to this new mindset would be difficult, but at least he knew his friends would be on his side.
“Thank you,” Hari smirks again, just because he can, then checks the time and sighs. “Guys, lunch is about over.”
“The third,” Hari looks at her curiously. “They’re always on the third, seventh, fifteenth, twenty-first, twenty-eighth, and thirty-first.” She should have known that. She winks at him and tilts her head slightly to indicate someone behind Hari. Hari waits a long moment, then peeks quickly. It’s the Longbottom Heir looking utterly confused by everything, as usual.
“To begin today’s session, we will be reviewing nominations for Chief Warlock,” Minister Fudge announces. Hari rolls his eyes.
“And your obstacles fallen,” Hari and his friends echo back, rising to offer bows of their own. Maybe their plan to implement the sayings as their usual greeting had fallen through, but they’d all memorized the general procedure.
“It means,” Draco tightens his arms around Hari, “that the Ministry can only enter Hogwarts on the Headmaster’s say-so. So even to arrest someone, they’d have to get permission or wait for the person to leave the wards.”
This chapter has Hari meeting with the professors and having some important discussions. Also, Draco. Need I say more?
Hari flinches away from this news and Draco rubs his back soothingly. Hari tucks his face into Draco’s neck to take a moment to just breathe. When he pops back up, he feels significantly better.
“Clever, Lord Potter,” he says just as the bell rings once more to indicate the start of the final period.
Hermione just laughs and puts the book back. “Hi, there, Uluka. I promise to be a good owner.” She carefully settles Uluka back in his cage and takes her seat.
“As well as the fact that you believe they can turn without the full moon’s presence,” Lord Malfoy finishes.
will remove that. Leave it on until just before classes tomorrow,” he tells her, “then just brush it off.” Hermione nods and studies the design with a small, happy smile. “And someone tell me why I decided to be mature and step out for the part of the meeting where they discuss students?”
“She was a Fate Seer, yes,” Luna offers a peaceful smile, “and, since you’re going to ask, I’ve not been tested myself.”
“I don’t really know,” Hari mutters and leans his head against her shoulder. “Besides, it’s wrong, isn’t it? To like another boy?”
“You like it, then?” Draco giggles as Ajay rubs their faces together, eyes closed and chuffing happily. He releases Draco after a moment and drops down, changing into Beau. “Beau wants a turn, too?” He lets out a high-pitched meow and darts into a tree, waiting for the prey he can catch to be released.
“And when is the next session, again?” Daphne pokes at her pie curiously with her fork before taking a bite. She makes a surprised but pleased sound and chomps away happily.
“Well, Father thinks that the only people who should be eligible to be Chief Warlock are Lords and Ladies,” Daphne explains, “and Madam Bones holds pretty different views than everyone in our alliance.”
“I’ll begin with what is most difficult for me to announce,” Hari says and clears his throat, suddenly feeling guilty. “We will be terminating two positions. Argus Finch, thank you for your tenure here at the school. However, at this time, Hogwarts finds itself no longer in need of your services.” Finch goes to sneer and yell at Hari, but Professor Snape rises and glares before he can even get a word out. “You have, I am sure, a home you stay at over the summer?” Finch confirms this with a stiff nod. “Is it available to you during the school year?” Another confirmation. “Then I request that you gather your belongings and return home by the end of the week. Is that enough time?” Finch nods stiffly. “Should you need Hogwarts as a reference, you will receive a glowing review.”
Hari looks for Narcissa in the gallery and she offers a small smile and nod. He responds in kind, relieved to know he had done well.
After a quick visit with Galeru, who is happier than ever in his habitat away from the kneazles and crups, they go inside and sit in the formal dining room for lunch.
“Can Dementors get through the wards?” Hari peeks out the window again, studying the terrifying creatures.
“This will tell you everything you need to know for that,” he says smugly. Hari smiles gratefully and snatches the book out of the air.
“That is being Manja, Master Hari. Manja is being with the Potterses inside the Manor and at Godric’s Hollow.” Hari’s eyes go wide and he scoops the cat up, marveling at Critter's garbling of the name.
Draco strokes his fingers through Hari’s hair and feels the soft rumble of Hari’s purr. Somehow, that being the hanger-on from his animagus transformation simply makes Hari all the cuter.
“I-I… of course he was included, he is a werewolf, and certainly not an outlier. Just look at the numbers!”
“No, it wasn’t,” Hari admits, “Hermione wants to be involved in the government. Coming to sessions will be beneficial for that.”
“That’s exactly it! I thought it might be a good idea to put together a few more personas, but then decided four was enough.”
A chime goes off—time for ninth hour. Draco scoops up his bag and heads out for Arithmancy. A bunch of others leave, too, so Hari scurries along beside them and weaves through their legs. If nothing else, Professor Snape will let him sit on his desk during seventh year potions and watch.
“Your father said he’d contact her for me,” Hari points out, “and everyone in the meeting wanted someone different and was really stubborn about their choice. I think, if it comes down to it, almost every Lady and Lord is going to vote for someone different.”
“Hello, dears,” Narcissa smiles at them and quickly casts the charm to allow Harry to see without glasses. “Are you both ready?”
“Manja,” Draco mutters, “well, let’s break it down a little. House elves sometimes have trouble with certain words, but they’re usually similar.”
They spend the rest of the evening giggling over random topics and only return to their houses when Critter pops in to ask if he should turn down the bedsheets for them or not.
Hari’s eyes skim across Draco’s copy of the Prophet. There’d been a sighting of Peter Pettigrew, although why he would show his face given his subtle animagus form, Hari cannot fathom.
“There you two are,” she sets a hand on Hermione’s shoulder, “we’ll go up to the gallery to find some seats. You’ll make it to yours alright?”
“How do you know all this?” Daphne asks, revealing that it’s not just common knowledge. Draco blushes slightly.
“We all will,” Pansy agrees. Hari grabs parchment and an envelope and sets about writing a scathing letter to Fudge. In bright red ink on the outside, he writes ‘URGENT’, just so he knows Fudge will get it right away. He seals it with both the Gryffindor and Slytherin crests and coaxes Hedwig awake. She swoops out their window and off to the Ministry.
“Well, I’ll get the difficult one out of the way first,” Hari starts, “Hermione is a scion as I have extended her my House protections.” This draws some shocked looks from the teachers—excluding Professor Snape. “Aside from that, it should be indicated on their acceptance letter whether or not they are a scion. In simplest terms, the only students you need to check are those of half-blood or more.”
Hari shrugs and takes another bite of cake. Somehow, he manages to clear his plate before the chime goes off for the third time that day.
“Which is why you went to talk to Daphne,” Draco guesses. “I figured. You seemed pretty shocked by the ladies.”
“I don’t care if it was planned or not,” Blaise huffs, “it was still wonderful seeing the old fart go down.”
The room has once again become an obstacle course, though this time, it appears more difficult than the last. It seems that with every time he visits the room, the obstacle challenge never gets easier. Draco assures him it also looks harder from an outsider’s perspective. Which means he is getting more and more comfortable in this form. If he could survive in it for a fair amount of time, that would be best.
“Would you prefer a privacy screen be placed between the Wizengamot and the floor?” Dumbledore asks. Hari nods subtly and Master Tomeaxe agrees.
“Before, please,” Hermione says, looking around in wonder. Hari keeps the first two floors brief—and excludes the library—then leads her up to the studies.
Draco laughs, “yeah, but your appetite is pretty much up to where it should be, so that shouldn’t be an issue.”
Hermione thinks for a long minute, then says, “okay, but that doesn’t really explain why I need this stuff.”
“During those ten years, I acted as a house elf, working non-stop to ensure their home was perfect. I kept the garden and the lawn, cleaned the house, made all the food, and was never allowed a single bite. Starvation keeps you weak and docile. With a child, it is easy to explain away as ‘picky eating’.
“Critter is being happy to be helping!” Critter’s ears wiggle excitedly. “Call Critter to clean up when you is being done, Master Hari.” Hari agrees and Critter pops away.
Hari blushes, then, too, and averts his eyes, drumming his fingers on his mug. Draco’s fingers suddenly trace over his cheek and Hari’s eyes shoot to his.
But then Draco sees him in action, setting the world on fire and not letting anyone attack him. And Draco remembers how much Hari has already survived and how he doesn’t need to be protected. He needs to be supported and sometimes guided. And maybe sometimes, he wants to be protected, shielded from reality. He can always come to Draco for that. But Hari doesn’t
“Of course, Luna, if you will call me Hari.” She grins brilliantly at this and skips away, headed for Ravenclaw tower.
“We are,” Hari says and offers his hand to Hermione. “Make sure you can feel my ring,” he warns, setting his thumb over the center stone. Hermione shifts her hand, then nods at him. “Wizen Session,” Hari announces and the ring whisks them away.
“I must say, you made some waves taking Miss Granger under your protection,” Theo says, taking a small bite of ice cream. “You’ll be getting requests to introduce her soon enough.”
“I figured if you preferred port-keying to flooing, you could use it to go home, instead. The keyword is ‘
“You’re the only other member of any of my Houses except for Sirius,” Hari explains, “Technically, if Draco were disowned or Narcissa got a divorce, they would be House of Black, but they’re officially part of House Malfoy.”
, the top boldly asymmetrical and a striking cobalt with matching shoes and black bottoms, all stitched in gold. Hermione is wearing a set of A-line closed robes with a high collar and elegantly fit-to-flare bell sleeves in a smooth cream with all gold and cobalt jewelry. Draco had warned him that as his first formal event after taking his seat, Hari would need to make a statement. Hari holds his hand out for Lady Longbottom to shake, the henna on his hands travelling from the back to his palms in an almost lacey design his father had apparently worn often.
Minister Fudge holds in an angry shout and orders the Aurors who were coming in to inform the department that Dumbledore is on the ‘most wanted’ list. He turns to Hari.
Thank you, everyone, for your support. I haven't said it yet, but I'll say it now--I love every one of you. Your comments and kudos mean so, so much to me. They really do keep me going on hard days. And all your support just from last night means the world to me. Thank you, again.
“Great idea!” Pansy agrees immediately, “although, your parents will have to share where they found it. It’s a gorgeous bag and I must have one for the school year.”
“And no one could have told me this yesterday?” Hermione asks as if irritated, but she turns to look at Hari and winks teasingly.
Draco laughs, “you’ve got me there! The more you and I do together as a couple, the more they’ll want to be couples. They’ll get subconsciously more and more obvious about their affections until, bam! They’re together!”
“Okay, change back, we’ve gotta get down to business,” Draco snaps his fingers at Hari. Beau nips at them harshly before changing back and glaring.
Hari freezes and stares up at Draco. They both sit back up slowly, studying each other. Hari knows he doesn’t look scared, just curious and slightly nervous.
“Well, the way she knew who we all were immediately and could tell the room was there without being told or seeing us leave it,” Draco lists. “She very well could be.”
The others bid them goodnight as well and separate into their own Family Suites. Hari opens his door and watches Draco do the same. They step in simultaneously, knowing from the first few nights at school that if they don’t, they’ll both stand there, waiting for the other to go in.
“You still have my new measurements on file, yes?” Hari asks. Mr. Lazwell confirms that he does. “Would you be able to make me a set or two of
“So, I have about forty five minutes instead of a half hour. I’m still leaving in a half hour, though. I need to meet with the Hogwarts elves.” He makes his way into the sitting room. “I still enough time for breakfast. What’re we having?”
“I’m glad,” Hari walks into the room, “I have a feeling I’ll be using this room a lot.” There’s a section with a coffee table, two arm chairs, and a settee. The bookshelves are built into the wall and directly facing the far East wall is the desk. Well, Hari calls it a wall, but it’s entirely made of windows. Cobalt curtains hang on either side, ready to be pulled at any moment. On either side of the desk stand two filing cabinets. “Critter, what are these?”
Anyway. Plot is happening in the story. One enemy has been handled for book three. Time to deal with the other... Hopefully soon. I feel like I'm getting to the point I can start wrapping book three up. Part of the plot might end up spilling over into book four, just because of how it lines up. Maybe. I should stop rambling about it and just write it.
Master Tomeaxe looks up, slightly surprised, but his lips curl and he nods towards Hari, “Lord Potter.”
Each of the nominees are called forward to give short speeches. There are a few who speak as if they are neutral, attempting to appeal to both sides of the room, but anyone who knows them knows their true standings. Very few people in the room are actually neutral on any subjects. There are, though, two others who manage to be honestly neutral. Though the most interesting speeches are the ones given by those who are nearly extremists.
“Hey, you’re back!” Draco chirps. Hari thinks about what Daphne had said about initiating and grins at Draco.
This place is smaller than Potter Manor, despite being a Founder’s primary residence. But, then again, Hari presumes most places will be smaller than Potter Manor. They may not have the absolute highest Primacy, but the House of Potter is one of the original families to be added to King Arthur’s Wizengamot, just days before the House of Peverell and the House of Black. In fact, the House of Potter was only preceded by two other Houses, along with the Founding Houses. The only reason the Founding Houses don’t have Primacy over the Most Ancient and Noble Houses is due to their not being nobility at the establishment of the government.
“Wonderful,” Hari smiles and stands. “I have to get to a meeting. Could one of you show me to the conference room?” The elves start to clamber over each other to be the one to go, when finally the spokeself claps his hands and stops them.
“They’d be the first, wouldn’t they?” Daphne agrees, “since they’re not raised here and Hari’s already Lord, it wouldn’t be hard for them to just assume that’s normal. And maybe even assume that it’s so normal, no one’s talking about it.”
“No, Hari, no,” Daphne wraps her arms around him. “You don’t really get to choose who you fall in love with or which gender you prefer. So if you want to date Draco, you can date Draco. Have I ever lied to you?”
Hari reaches the entrance to the Slytherin dorms and studies the hall. Professor Snape’s quarters are directly across from the common room. Given there are no classrooms on that side in this hall, Hari assumes their suites will be there somewhere.
“No, no,” Hari waves her off and flips the book open. There’s a table of contents, perfect. “I’ve given you leave not to already. I’d rather not do that formally. Hey, Dray, could you explain the ins and outs of it to her?”
He pushes open the door and steps in to find a sitting room with a small dining area off to one side. There’s three doors, as with the suites in the Potter Manor. One is a bathroom, another a bedroom, and the last a small study space. Hari makes his way through each room, smiling to himself at the luxury within. This, he knows, is why Dumbledore removed it. The luxury would ‘make other students feel lower.’ It’s not about who’s lower and who’s higher. It’s about safety and comfort. The dorms themselves are incredibly nice. But, Hari isn’t afraid to admit, as he jumps onto the soft, animal-fur blankets, the luxury definitely is worth it.
Aight, chapter two! It's up! Chapter fourteen is mostly written... It needs a little bit of work, but I don't feel bad posting this now, so here. I'm just trying to integrate the new friend appropriately and it is harder than I thought it would be.
“I’ll see you inside,” Theo says, gently dismissing them into the ballroom, “please, enjoy yourselves.”
“I was. I need to pick up Galeru and I want to spend some time with my parents’ kneazle before going back.”
Hari opens it slowly, revealing a silver pocket watch. It has a ring consisting of each of his house stones around the face and an engraving of the Potter crest, but is otherwise simple. It suits him to a tee, Hari thinks.
“Smart move,” the witch smiles at him. She extends her hand, “Auror Nymphadora Tonks, but just call me Tonks.” Hari clasps her wrist. “This is my partner, Auror Kingsley Shacklebot.”
Draco and Hari nod and Professor Snape releases them. They practically run to the R.O.R, where the whole group is waiting for them.
“It went well enough,” Hari says, “but it was hard to do. And Dumbledore escaped. This place is still under Fidelius, isn’t it?”
“Hey,” Draco murmurs and smiles sweetly, “breathe, you’re okay. I’ve got you.” Draco leads them through a swooping turn, causing their robes to flare around them. Some of the tension bleeds out of Hari at the teasing move. He starts to smile again.
“Pettigrew was in Hogsmeade,” Hari says quickly, “we ran into him and had to wait for the Aurors to come get him.”
The worker helps Hari pick out a simple necklace with a small cobalt pendant on the end. Draco doesn’t look pleased when he sees it, but he hands over the thin chain he’d found. It’s silver with a cobalt embedded in the clasp.
“Crumple-horned…” Draco practically starts bouncing on his toes, “I know who she is! Xenophilius Lovegood! He runs the Quibbler. Their line is actually well-known for producing Seers. He never was identified as one, although he always knew who he could trust and who he couldn’t.”
“Well? Are you getting up? We’ve got a busy day,” Draco waves his hand in a ‘get moving’ gesture. Hari stares at him for a moment, a little bewildered, then shakes his head and forces himself up. The day he understands Draco is the day pigs fly.
“Lord Potter is the opposite of this. He came in, not wanting to tell us what had happened not for fear of making his own situation worse, but because he was concerned it would upset us. My son, Draco, had to speak for him because he had been taught all his life not to speak of it.
“Dray,” Hari whines and rolls so they’re as closely cuddled as he can get, “I’m sorry. I promise, I’ll make sure you either know or are coming with me next time.”
Draco stops in the middle of the hall, walks over to one of the suits of armor and starts climbing it.
“Hari!” Draco wails and throws himself onto the smaller boy. “I was just about to make Father go look for you.”
“Because you’re not a gossip monger, like some people,” Draco corrects, shooting a pointed glance at Pansy. Hari laughs and cuddles into Draco’s shoulder.
“Oh, right,” Draco draws his wand, “there’s a spell for that.” He readies it but Hari snatches the wand from his hand and stalks away.
“I suppose it’s a good thing I have access to all my vaults now, isn’t it?” Hari smirks cheekily at her and she laughs.
“I don’t know if I could stand seeing my reflection in everything all the time, but yes, this is nice,” Hari admits.
“Okay,” Hari nods slowly, breathing slightly shallow, “I can do that.” So he says, but his mind is swirling. Daphne takes his arm again and carefully guides him back inside, whispering reminders to breathe. Draco’s dance with Hermione is done and they should be looking for Hari just about now.
“The left is being the paperwork of past Lords and Ladies,” Critter explains, “the right is being Master Hari’s paperwork.”
“You ask him, that’s actually a good idea,” Draco starts to smile, then scowls. “Hey! You tried to distract me! I’m still angry!” Hari sighs. Well, it had almost worked, at least.
“Of course,” Pansy nods, “especially in Slytherin. Most of us were raised with politics that allow for young Lordship, but not the Headmaster thing.”
“She also mentioned wanting to find a crumple-horned snorkack,” Hari says, “she thinks she’ll get along with them better than the nargles.”
“You ready?” Hari asks Hermione. He offers her the book. “My part is easy to remember.” She skims it over and then nods.
“We should,” Hari sighs and stands, extending his hand to help her up. They walk quietly back, bumping shoulders ever few steps, and make it back to the room in giggles.
“Now, we remove all Heirs and myself from the stack,” Hari adds. “We have our Family Suites.” The stack separates again, withdrawing a much smaller amount. He looks, somewhat dismayed at the large pile, “Can you search it by magic for the word ‘Scion’?”
“The day after tomorrow,” Hari smiles, “hence why we’re here today. Oh,” he turns to Draco, “I forgot to ask, but did your father register my port-key into the Ministry?”
“I didn’t expect…” Draco trails off, then grins and swoops down to catch Hari’s lips in a kiss. “You’re wonderful,” he whispers over Hari’s mouth. Hari smiles at the words. They get ready to sleep and snuggle into the center of the large bed. They cuddle up next to each other, Hari wrapped firmly in Draco’s arms, and the promise of Professor Snape working on their troubles allowing him to relax into a deep sleep.
“I’ll stay here. It’s less than a month until school, after all, and we’ll see each other at least once a week for Wizengamot sessions.”
“I believe you’ll be finding out in just a minute, Minister Fudge,” Hari smiles sweetly. Time to play up the innocent act once more. “However, I will say that I chose someone I believe is capable of maintaining neutrality, a trait I believe to be important in such a position.”
The group laughs and Draco explains, “that class is kind of known to be a joke. None of the information is accurate. You’ll likely have a lot of trouble separating what you know from the lies they want you to know.”
Hermione bows, “and you, as well, Lord Nott.” She straightens and clasps wrists with him. He seems both surprised and pleased at her knowledge of etiquette.
Hermione sighs, “I shouldn’t. It’s tempting, but I can come back and explore the library another time. After all,” she smirks at him, “you gave me a port-key.”
“Oh, thank you, Hari!” She looks at him fretfully for a moment, “or should I be calling you ‘Lord Potter’?”
Draco’s pupils flare and his gaze somehow becomes even more intense, even as he smiles, pleased with Hari’s answer, “I’m glad. I wanted to dance with you, too. You needed the time with Daphne, though.” Little does Hari know, Daphne had confirmed that Hari is interested in Draco after their first conversation, but that he had reservations about the relationship.
“’Mione,” Sirius murmurs to her, “take a few deep breaths for me. It will be alright. They’ll be sending Aurors out to find him and Hit Wizards to capture him. He won’t be free for long. Now, what we can do immediately is take care of protecting your home. Hari,” Sirius looks over his shoulder at Hari, “you’re Fidelius-free. Care to join us?”
“This,” he tells her, “is a Northern Saw-whet Owl. They make a distinctive call and are one of the smaller owls. I just thought he was cute.” He hands the little thing to Hermione, who seems to be tearing up. “Sorry I didn’t give him to you sooner.”
“We’ll sign off on that, I believe,” Lucius announces and everyone around the table nods. Lucius makes a mark on the paper in front of him. “Next, let’s talk about who would teach a Wizarding Culture class and whether or not we have it in budget.”
He needs a pensieve, just to relive that kiss over and over. If they could have chosen to never leave that moment…
“This is so stupid!” Hari cries, “why do they need to know this stuff? I mean, ‘the color of the walls (if indoors).’ Really?”
“Of course,” Hari rises and crosses to the counter quickly to pay, then returns. “I’ll see about getting you those port-keys before Monday. And hopefully, your house will be on the floo network by then. I’ll keep you updated by owl.”
“Would you bring some snacks up to my spot in the library?” Hari asks, looking up at Critter, “small finger foods that won’t make a mess and maybe some hot chocolate.”
“Blaise, Pansy, you’ll be late if you don’t go now,” Hermione calls and the two jump up, running from the room with absent ‘thank you’s’ yelled over their shoulders. Hari chuckles at them.
“We’ve got a half hour, then,” Draco says after flicking his wrist to cast a Tempus charm. “I’d say more, but you’ll have to floo to Hogsmeade and walk up.”
He opens it to reveal a thin silver chain, encrusted all along in diamonds. The charm on the end is small and simple, but clearly engraved with the Malfoy crest. Circling it are even more diamonds.
“Right,” Dumbledore glares up at Hari, who simply crooks an eyebrow at him. “As I was saying, the first thing on our agenda is a bill proposed by Secretary Umbridge and dealing with werewolves. Miss Umbridge?” He gestures for her to take the floor.
“For now,” Hari crooks an eyebrow, “every student. Primarily because of the void created by the past ten years of this class not being taught.”
“Well, you’re not big,” Draco snorts and sets Hari gently into a chair. He starts scooping food onto Hari’s plate. Narcissa settles across from Draco’s seat.
“You don’t really have to pay for everything,” Mr. Granger tries to say, but Hari is already shaking his head.
“No, Lord Potter, of course not. My apologies, I simply was unprepared to see someone so young participate,” Minister Fudge bows neatly.
They walk down to the floo room and Hari holds out his hand. Once everyone has a finger on it, he announces, “
“I kind of just left after suggesting her and getting Lucius to agree.” Hari waits for Daphne to start to collecting herself, “why is this funny?”
“I, Lord Hari James Potter, do hereby call Hermione Jean Granger into my House and protection,” Hari intones.
“I don’t think I’ve seen you with your hair down since you got those new potions,” she says, “it’s gorgeous.”
“That’s not to say they won’t try to figure you out,” Draco warns, pointing his fork at Hari over lunch.
“Would you go to the Department of Magical Transportation at the Ministry and get the paperwork to request two new port-keys for me? You can take it to my study at the Manor, I’ll come by tomorrow to fill it out.”
“I will,” Daphne stands, “he and I have nice chats all the time. Besides, I think he’ll respond better to a girl asking about feelings than a boy.”
“I doubt it,” Daphne says, “there’s a lot more moderates out there than admit to being moderate. And maybe my father didn’t vote with you, but I’m sure Lord Malfoy did.”
“Yes?” Daphne’s eyes go wide, “You weren’t there when Hari learned all this, were you? Purebloods save ancestral wands, which don’t have traces on them since their owner is technically dead. And traces can’t be placed on our house like they can at muggleborns’ since our whole family does magic. So, we learn spells early with those.”
For this chapter, we go back to school. It's book three, guys, what do you think happens on the train? Featuring BAMF Hari.
“Alright,” Hari agrees and they step forward, never letting go of each other. They get to their compartment—indeed, the same compartment they’d had every train ride so far—and settle in, Draco sitting against the window with Hari on his lap and firmly wrapped in his arms. Hari snuggles closer and relaxes, content to wait for the others.
“So, basically,” Hermione leans forward, “you’ve got a pool of extremists who are alienating their own supporters by being
“I know,” Hari sighs. They lay down, Hari on top of Draco rather comfortably. Draco lets Hari’s hair down and strokes his fingers through it. The content purring comes back within moments and Draco smiles, pleased with himself.
Hari nods back in the way Narcissa taught him and sits. The other nobility follow, sitting in a ripple effect based on the primacy of their Houses. The Ministry officials have stayed seated through it all.
“All those in favor of granting Lord Potter’s request.” There’s a pause and Dumbledore’s face goes white. “All those in favor of denying Lord Potter’s request.” The pause is brief this time. “Lord Potter’s request has been granted.” Off the bat, Dumbledore’s position as Chief Warlock has been stripped from him. Minister Fudge rises and takes Dumbledore’s spot at the podium.
Hari breathes in and takes his first step. His shoes click tellingly on the floor and if every eye hadn’t already been watching the doors, they would be now.
“I know. The problem is that I’m going to lose the ability to play the childhood innocence card in just a few years.”
“If we do it somewhat regularly, he’ll end up telling us something someday,” Blaise agrees, “and probably sooner, rather than later.”
“No,” Hari glowers, “and I’m going to make whoever thought it was okay to try to go over my head very, very sorry.”
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Baron of House Peverell. So mote it be.” What, did they forget his father also held that title? The Peverell seat glows and the crest hovers in front of Hari, fading after a second.
Hari smiles back, “remind me to show you my memories of him realizing what was happening, it was beautiful.” Hari shows Sirius into the room they had landed. “Padfoot, these are my friends, Heir Draco Malfoy, Heir Daphne Greengrass, Heir Pansy Parkinson, Heir Blaise Zabini, and Miss Hermione Granger.” They all nod to him, but Hari can see that Hermione almost slipped into a bow. “Everyone, this is Sirius Black, my godfather. Oh, and Padfoot, I did a ritual to accept Hermione into my House.”
“Hari? Is that you?” They look over into an alley where someone—dirty and unkempt—is wringing their hands. Hari sneers.
“Which property should we visit next?” Blaise asks over dessert. Hari twists his ring around his finger absently.
“My apologies, but I don’t feel comfortable speculating,” Hari apologizes, “They’ve clearly kept the victim’s name a secret for a reason.”
“Would you please notify Andromeda Tonks that she has been hired by Hogwarts and should arrive for the staff meeting in an hour? Thank you.” Critter pops away to deliver the message.
Remus studies him for a long moment and seems almost frightened at what he sees, but he nods and lets Hari return to his friends.
“You bow first to Hari,” Pansy jumps in, “then more shallowly to the rest of us. We’ll stand close enough together that you won’t need to remember the order.” Hari finds the appropriate page and marks it with his finger.
They have a momentary conversation about allowing students to arrive via apparition and floo, but decide that would set muggleborns apart a bit too much. Instead, they add a clause that would allow for special circumstances to be exceptions. Such as Hari’s case, not that he’ll use it. Besides, the Express is a much-loved tradition now.
“You’re breaking the law,” Hari tells him blandly, “Hogwarts is sovereign land. We’re practically our own country. You have to have my
“Okay, how’s this?” Hari raises an eyebrow, “I tell the Board the new schedule doesn’t seem to be working as well as we’d hoped and we push it back an hour. To 8:45. Does that sound good?”
“He would be able to do… an adequate job,” Professor Snape agrees. Hari has to force his eyebrow not to rise at that. For him to say that about someone he doesn’t truly like is practically a glowing review.
This one's coming pretty late in the day and I'm sorry for that, but getting the new chapter as good as possible I believe to be a valid reason. Anyway, it's been a long day and I hope to get so much more writing done tomorrow. Oh, I should ask, though. Would anyone like me to add a link or something like that so you all can see the new class schedule I designed?
“It’s a nice room to look at,” she says. “It’s nice to meet you, Hari Potter, Draco Malfoy, Daphne Greengrass, Pansy Parkinson, and Blaise Zabini. Shame I didn’t get to meet Hermione Granger.”
“We are,” Draco confirms, “Hari petrified him before he could do anything. Aurors Shacklebot and Tonks took him away just a minute or so ago. We port-keyed back right away.”
“Oh,” Hari perks up, “you want them to get stuck wandering Hogsmeade alone!” Hari looks up at Draco, who shoots a glance at the two in the room and then winks at Hari. Hari stifles a giggle—Draco’s not working one couple at a time, he’s going for two-in-one!
Healer Ripclaw confirms Madam Pomfrey’s assessment of his injuries and explains how he had a curse scar that contained something incredibly dangerous within it. He steadfastly refuses to answer questions about the scar, claiming it does not directly affect the case.
Hari searches Draco’s face. There’s only honesty, pure and open, laid out there. The words spiral in Hari’s head and he recalls every time Draco has ever seemed slightly off. Whenever he hugged Hermione, when the girls at school had thrown themselves at him every Valentine’s Day. The Valentine he’d gotten from the young Weasley girl, who he’d had to apologize to for Draco’s temper. All the hugs and hand-holding and cuddling makes sense now; Daphne had tried to tell him. Draco really does like him.
They leave the next morning at ten. Hari doesn’t know how long the paperwork will take him to fill out, but he’s certain it won’t be easy.
“Well, I’m not certain I’m pleased that there’s someone out there trying to get my daughter, but I’ll trust you to protect our house as best you can.”
“There’s no reason for me to live! You’re taking the greatest gift from this world, Potter,” Draco warns, standing up on the armor’s shoulders. Suddenly, he’s lifted off it and set gently on the floor.
“Very well, Lord Potter,” Professor Sprout agrees. “We will send for you if necessary.” Hari nods and slips out of the room. Once through, he shifts into Ajay and takes off, running for the Room of Requirement, where he can play.
“How did you know our names?” Draco asks, edging closer to Hari protectively. Hari braces himself and gets ready to transform.
“Master Hari!” Critter appears, “you is being at home!” The little elf’s ears wiggle in excitement and Hari giggles, then starts laughing outright.
“Well, going against the Minister might not be a great idea,” Blaise says, shifting uncomfortably. “He’s nice enough, but he knows how to play the game and the backlash might not be fun to deal with.”
She opens the door to the bathroom first, which is entirely white with soft green decorations. The next door she opens is to the little study room. The walls are entirely comprised of bookcases, which have been stocked with both muggle and wizarding literature, both fiction and educational. There’s no windows in the room, but the ceiling is charmed to look like the sky outside, just as the Great Hall at Hogwarts is. There’s a desk in the center of the room and a day bed, loaded with pillows and blankets in shades of blue, off to one side.
“I’m certain.” Lucius leads the way to the Entrance Hall. “I wish you the best of luck with your next meeting. May you persevere beyond their resistance to change.”
“It sounds like you’ve essentially adopted her,” Mr. Granger crosses his arms and glares at Hari. “She is our daughter.”
“Of course I did,” her chin lifts proudly, “my Alice was your godmother and Lily was my Neville’s godmother. Quite the inseparable pair, Alice and Lily.” She looks at him, concerned. “I was very troubled to hear what had happened to you,” Lady Longbottom tells him, “should you ever like to know more about your mother, I believe I have some stories you may enjoy, and even some photographs.”
Draco smiles to himself. He can’t wait to tell Daphne and the others. They’ll be so excited to hear the news. But he stops himself from jumping up and rushing straight to the floo. It’s late. And Hari’s asleep on him. And everyone knows you don’t move a sleeping kitten. Maybe this isn’t such a bad thing, that they can’t tell the others just yet. Maybe having it all for themselves for a few days wouldn’t be so bad.
“I doubt that,” Draco shakes his head, “didn’t you see the antiques section? Plus, that was such a small shelf of the massive shop. I would bet they only bring a fraction of her income. She won’t need to reach out.”
Yesterday, there had been a long conversation about whether or not it would be safe for Hari to go to Hogsmeade at all. But they came to the understanding that Hari is allowed to use magic outside of school now. With his self-defense classes, he’s learned enough protective spells that he can, at the very least, defend himself until help arrives. That, and Luna said they wouldn’t have anything to worry about.
it. He’s strong in a way Draco doesn’t know if he’ll ever be. And they’ve barely started Hari’s self-defense training.
“Oh, you poor dear,” Narcissa reaches out for Hermione, “come, we’ll go back to the Manor and heal you right up.” With that, she apparates away.
“Thank you,” Hari smiles and Draco pulls him close for a long hug. Tension drains out of both of them. When they pull apart, grinning, something catches in the corner of Hari’s eye.
“I think they’ll take from another table if they have to,” Draco snickers. “They’ll be desperate to do well and keep us coming here.”
Hari nods to the man who then proceeds to offer a bow to the Heirs. Draco has had his nose turned up since the first person bows and Blaise refuses to stop making fun of him for it. It’s a long ten more minutes before they find Hermione. She darts over as soon as she sees them and bows gracefully. She’s clearly practiced for this moment.
“You can be Secret Keeper for one of my other properties,” Hari promises and then waves Hermione over.
Hari guides Hermione down to the library and, like in Beauty and the Beast, has her close her eyes before guiding her to the center of the room.
“I trust her,” Hari allows and they start walking back to the dorms. “And I know she’ll get both of them. I’m just concerned. If she signed off on this, I’ve just stepped on her toes.”
“I think Sirius has a set,” Hari points out, “maybe he’d give it to us? Or tell us how to make them. Or make us a set.”
“Yeah,” Draco smiles tightly, “see you there.” Hari leads Hermione out the Manor to the front gates, where Narcissa is waiting.
“It’s up to you,” he tells her, “but one of these studies could be yours.” He gestures to the two unused rooms. “I’ve already promised one to Draco, when he gets a little older.”
Hari glances up at Draco before replying. “I didn’t even know about magic until my letter came. The books are a gross misrepresentation of myself and an attempt to capitalize off my fame. Someone signed off on it and I want that person handled.” There’s a glint in his eye and the witch takes note of it.
“You’re on the floo network,” Hari tells her, “you can call either of us and we’ll do what we can, okay?”
Oh, they’re going to flip when they find out Hari and Draco had been keeping this from them for a week, but how do you not explain in person? Their relationship is deeper than that, isn’t it? Deeper than just saying, ‘we’re dating,’ over floo?
“No,” Draco shakes his head, “she’ll understand. Her niece goes here, remember? Would you want Dementors near anyone in your family?”
The bird has smooth brown feathers on top, only broken by the few slight, pure white spots. His underbelly is practically cream because the white and brown blend so seamlessly. With big golden eyes surrounded by a face that looks like it was painted, the small owl truly is a handsome bird.
“Nothing’s a guarantee, Draco,” Hari leads them into the store for Dueling robes, “so you’ll just have to do your best.”
Hermione hadn’t yet learned to snap her fingers, so it takes her a little longer to catch on, but soon enough, Critter is standing in her sitting room.
“Eat some, it’ll help reverse the effects,” Remus tells them, “I need to speak to the conductor.” Hari grabs a chocolate frog and takes a bite. Warmth spreads through him.
“No, that’s fine,” Hari waves it off, “I just wanted to make sure I wouldn’t have to port-key to my Manor and then floo over during the school year.”
They walk back to Fortescue’s, where they quickly separate their purchases into the proper owner’s bag.
“What?” Draco snaps to attention, looking outside. “They are,” he whispers, sounding terrified, “Lock the compartment door. Now.” He fumbles for the latch on the window and manages to catch it just as a Dementor drifts past. Daphne clicks the lock on the door. Hari glances over—it doesn’t seem like enough if they’re going to keep one of these things out. Already, with it on the outside of the train and several feet away, he feels despair creeping in. He draws his wand and casts a sealing spell at the door, one he’d learned to protect his study, just in case.
The Lords and Ladies nearby are looking on with interest. Umbridge is turning bright red. For the second time in as many meetings, Hari is making her look uncultured and unknowledgeable.
Hermione pales, “he had a meeting last year with Professor McGonagall about how he needs to do better or he may be kicked out of Hogwarts.”
“We go this way, first,” Critter takes them to the right. “These doors only be having a few rooms off them.”
“Though, I’m not sure the jewelry will really blend with my appearance.” She looks down at her muggle clothes doubtfully.
“We can tell,” the single Hufflepuff grins. “Plus, I like that my partner for WizCul is from Slytherin. Inter-House unity and mixing blood and mixing titles. It’s splendid.”
Hari huffs, “we need somewhere safe to stay for a few hours. I don’t want Dumbledore choosing to come after us right away and the other Manors need to be safeguarded before we go home.”
“Maybe you could try showing you like him, too? I mean, you already do some of that subconsciously, letting him cuddle you more and such, but maybe initiate?”
Hari puts the finishing touches on Hermione’s hand, puts the tube away, and casts the charm to protect it. Settling back into Draco, he looks at Hermione.
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Earl of Gryffindor. So mote it be.” Shocked silence reigns in the room as red magic all but surrounds him. But he’s still not done.
Sure enough, upon their arrival, Professor McGonagall pulls Hari aside to inform him that Fudge is there.
This chapter--it's interesting. I don't know how else to explain it. I had some fun writing it and Draco is a character. So... yeah. Let me know your thoughts!
“Uluka,” she declares. “The name of the Goddess Lakshmi’s mount. Although, to be more accurate, he would need to be a white barn owl. I like it anyway.”
“No need,” Hari grins, “we’re all hungry. Let’s go get lunch. You can eat with us.” They get to the Heir’s Lounge to find the others have already arrived.
“Thank you, Critter,” Hari smiles at him, “why don’t you see about designing a suite for her. She loves books and studying,” Hari says, “so maybe she’d prefer an extra family suite?”
“We’re young,” Hari says, “I’ll bet, with a bit of time, you’ll figure it out. And in the meantime, we can see if we can’t get the two of you to spend some time together. I mean, just to see how you click. And maybe it’ll get him to notice you back.”
“Right, but my point is that she might have been uncomfortable touring these and knowing that I technically own them all by birthright,” Hari says, “I don’t think she would have said it outright, but she might have felt inadequate. I’m actually concerned she already does.”
“Don’t worry about formality,” Hari waves him off, “I’m sorry for yelling. I’m still shaken up from having a Dementor try to get into my compartment.” The conductor blanches at that, but Hari turns and walks back out, starting to make his way back to the group.
“Professor Snape, I realize this puts you at somewhat of a disadvantage,” Hari tilts his head apologetically, “if you have suggestions for how to combat this, please arrange a meeting with me.”
“My feet feel like they’re going to fall off,” Hermione replies, wincing slightly. Hari’s eyes go wide.
“Now?” Draco smiles and pulls Hari into him. “Now, I get to cuddle you all the time. And hold your hand everywhere we go, not just to lead you around. Now, everyone knows you’re mine.”
Hey!! I'm back again! This is a little later than I planned to post but I literally fell asleep on my laptop last night, so... Yeah. That happened. Anyway, I feel like this fic is starting to wrap up. I was planning on having Dumbledore's trial in this one, but I might shift that to book four. There's already been a lot of action and I think trying to include it would just drag this one out too much. But we'll see. Ooh, and if anyone has name suggestions for an owl (preferably Indian in origin), please send them!!
“If you’re sure,” Hari nods, then turns and makes his way back into the crowd. Thankfully, he’s already spoken to most of them today and doesn’t have to again.
“Certainly,” Narcissa nods sharply. “I wasn’t truly pleased you would choose to stay there alone, darling,” she tells Hari. “I’m glad you’ll be taking Draco with you.”
“Because if they don’t know a personality they should prepare for, you can use it to get under their skin and win,” Professor Snape presumes. Hari nods excitedly.
“Could I see just one of them, then?” Critter opens the door to the first guest room and lets Hari see a suite of rooms with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a sitting room, and a small dining area.
Master Tomeaxe takes the floor after Narcissa for one last statement. “We request that we, the goblins, be allowed to take the wix responsible for the actions of the muggles—the wix who assumed illegal custody, who
Hari sighs—the Umbridge lady is going up against werewolves again. Why werewolves? Who knows. She must have some kind of personal vendetta against them, since that’s the only reason Hari can feasibly come up with.
Their tongues meet and dance playfully around each other. Hari lets Draco explore his mouth before pushing lightly to be allowed to do the same. He runs his tongue against Draco’s and across the ridges of his teeth.
“So I have witnessed, so mote it be,” Draco completes the ritual. Magic rises over their clasped hands and twine Hari and Hermione together.
“Yeah,” Hermione smiles sheepishly, “I’ve been having fun with all the different hair-dos. It’s easier to try them out when you don’t have to spend hours laboring over them.”
“Nope, not just you,” Hari groans, “the whole thing was pointless either way. Your father confirmed that, too.”
“I would like to apologize for selling them, in that case,” she bows neatly, “I was unaware that you disapproved of them. I will pull them from my shelves with all due haste. If you would like, I can pass the word around to the more reputable shops? Ones with discreet owners.”
Hari makes eye contact with Draco and Daphne nudges him, “go ahead.” She steps back a single step and smiles reassuringly. Hari tilts his head to invite Draco over. Draco grins and leads Hermione back. Hari shifts so he’s nearly facing the dance floor and bends his arms, fingertips lightly brushing. Draco’s eyes shoot between Hari and Daphne and his smile softens. His eyes settle warmly on Hari.
“Critter is being happy to be taking care of Miss Hermione,” Critter tells her and pats her shoulders awkwardly.
“So… what’s the whole story?” Pansy asks, tapping her toe impatiently. “And what are we telling the masses?” Hari lets Draco take the question.
They work hard for a full hour, managing to get through the three short essays before deciding it’s time for a break.
“I do not want to share you,” Draco whines. Hari laughs. Beau can make an appearance tomorrow. For now, they have a welcome-back speech from Professor Snape to hear. And, from the glint in the Professor’s eyes and his curling smirk, it’s going to be a good one.
“Yes, well, I did say I might need a rescue if I wasn’t back sometime during the dinner hours,” Hari admits.
Draco hurries Hari through his nighttime routine and tucks him into the king size bed before bustling off to do his own obnoxiously long routine. Hari snuggles into the middle, warmth blooming from Draco’s care in the center of his chest.
“Sirius can transfigure our clothes for us,” Pansy suggests. Draco doesn’t look pleased at the idea of altering his clothes, but accepts this as the best option.
Hari glances around the room. He’s rather surprised to find that most of the eyes on him are filled with respect, rather than distrust. A few look apathetic, but Hari takes that as boredom over anything else.
“She will,” Draco nods reassuringly, “she’ll understand and catch them and they’ll go on trial,” Draco promises, “and then we’ll be free of them for good.”
“Any objections to Grimmauld Place?” Hari offers. No one objects, so he holds out his hand and they all place a finger on his ring. “
“See that you do,” Hari glares, “or I’ll make good on my promise.” Hari strides from the room, not looking back to see if Fudge gets started on his assigned task, just returning to the Great Hall to eat some good food.
“I suppose we must go in,” she sighs, “at least something interesting should come of the goblins.” Hari glances to Blaise. Does she not know? But then, Hari supposes Lucius wouldn’t have told their allies everything. If one chose to flip, that would be far too much information they could leak.
“Dray, that’s not the problem right now,” Hari huffs, but reaches up and steals a kiss anyway. “How does being a Seer work?”
“I’ll see to it,” Hari promises. A minute later, they’re gathered in Hermione’s living room, Hermione staring at them in shock.
“Well, I’m glad you like them so much,” Hari smiles then, cruel and uncaring, “You’ll be seeing a lot of the Dementors from your cell.” He steps to the floo, grabbing a pinch of powder. Fudge grabs Hari’s arm. “You will unhand me or I will add assault to the list.” Fudge drops him like he’d been burned.
“Maybe not,” Hari allows, “but you’re good enough to pretty much keep up with me, so you could take my spot.”
“I feel kind of bad not bringing Hermione along for this,” Pansy admits, taking a bite of a biscuit.
“I don’t think he could take the Knight Bus,” Daphne muses, “Stan probably wouldn’t let him on. He’d recognize him.” She pauses, “I hope. But as for floo, he’d have to start somewhere there was no people and come out somewhere without people. The second is nearly impossible to guarantee and in Hogsmeade, it essentially is impossible. There’s only two floos and they’re in pubs.”
“He’s already part of the Wizengamot, Dad. He has six titles.” Hari winces slightly and looks sheepish. “He’s the most powerful singular wizard on the Wizengamot, and that’s without allies.”
“Don’t forget Andromeda Tonks,” Draco chimes in, “although, she was officially disowned, so you’d have to find out if she would be willing to be accepted back and I’m not sure she would be.” Hari blinks at Draco until Draco sighs and says, “she didn’t have a great experience as a member of the House of Black. Not only did they disown her, she disowned them.” Hari hums in acceptance of this explanation.
“Minister, do you intend to deny Lord Potter his legal right to sit on this body?” Lucius is standing, eyes slightly narrowed. It is an intimidating look.
“You’re incredibly confident, even though you’re so shy sometimes. The contradiction makes you so sweet, I can’t put it into words.” And Draco likes sweets, Hari knows.
Hari groans and turns to Pansy, “any chance I could get one of those transcribing quills your mother uses?”
“No. You’ll disappear again.” Narcissa peeks out of one of the rooms at the sound of them arguing and has to stifle a laugh. Hari shoots her a pleading look.
“And there was such a danger to her that you decided this was the best course of action?” Mrs. Granger does not sound pleased.
Draco doesn’t seem to have a response to that, so he just huffs and hands over his measurements to the worker. Once delivery is arranged, they leave to collect potions ingredients.
“Isn’t it?” Another agrees, “Even with the addition of WizCul, it’s so much better than previous years. I don’t feel so overwhelmed.”
“I was tested as a kid,” he mutters. “I had some… tendencies my parents were concerned about. It turned out to be so minor, it doesn’t even matter.”
“You weren’t looking for it,” Draco replies with a little shrug. “And we’re young. Besides, they act no differently than any other couple and since everyone wears robes, you wouldn’t have noticed from behind without really looking. We’ve kept you pretty distracted, too, always rushing you around.”
“I was informed by Draco that I am to rescue you if you are not home by dinner,” he tells Hari, lips quirking.
“Then, that means the moderates are far more likely to win,” Hermione points out. “They’ll look reasonable next to the extremists and garner more votes.”
Hari sets down his mug and reaches out with his other hand. The tray vanishes from between them, Critter seemingly knowing they’re already done with it.
“Oh, sorry,” Hari turns to her. “We’re going to be invited to a Fall Festival Ball by Lord and Heir Nott.” Hermione looks somewhat confused, so Hari explains, “by Theo and his father.”
“Exactly,” Hari nods. “For Slytherin, the dorms alternate which side of the hall you’re on each year. Instead, we would have a dorm on each side of the hall for each year, one for scions and one for typical peers. The only occasion I see this as being inappropriate is if there is only one student in either category in a year. That is an isolation I do not anticipate being enjoyable.”
“Formality,” Hari says, “basically, when the ritual was created, formality was expected whether in public or private. Saying that would be saying, ‘you don’t have to bow in private.’”
“That’s good,” Hari murmurs. “There’s a lot of you all anyway.” He smiles teasingly and, soon enough, he and all his friends are petting the hippogriffs. When they start to return inside, a kneazle with orange fur and green eyes races over to Hari out of nowhere. It yowls at him and paws at his leg.
“Oh, would you look at that,” Pansy jumps up, “it’s almost time to go listen to more speeches!” She claps her hands once, grinning brilliantly. The group laughs at her antics and follows her from the room.
“I’m sure,” Daphne placates, glaring at Blaise, “and I’m sure you’re giving Hermione that design because of how she named the owl?”
“That’s true,” Hari nods. “So no one has an issue with it… But what about marriage? And children? We need heirs.”
“Let’s check out the books and clothing, then we’ll go to dinner,” Draco says and leans down to press a kiss to Hari’s cheek.
Hari giggles, but then yawns. When Daphne does the same, Blaise announces that he thinks it’s been a long day and they should head to bed. Hari fetches Sirius, who transfigures their clothes without question. Hari lets Draco lead him to one of the guest rooms, then shifts into Beau and curls up in the crook of Draco’s neck. He’s asleep in minutes. It really had been a long day.
Professor McGonagall reveals herself to have been Professor Snape’s sounding board for when he didn’t know how to react or how to help Hari.
“Alright, miss,” Mr. Lazwell helps her down, “you can change back. Would you like me to write down your measurements?”
They share a glance, then switch to discussing Luna’s homework and classes. She has quite a bit to say about Defense and seems to think Professor Snape is infested with nargles himself. Hari holds in the comment he has about that.
“Aw, I missed you, too,” Draco smirks and nuzzles his nose into Hari’s hair, “though, it’s only been an hour.”
“Thank you, Lucius,” Hari smiles and Lucius turns, striding from the building to reach the nearest apparition point.
“Come on, all of you. This is really cool,” Draco grins brilliantly at all of them and leads Ajay out of the room. They walk all the way over to the East wing of the Manor and to the doors of the large, open room Draco used to learn to fly as a child. “We’re here. Ready, Ajay?”
Theo finishes the last of his ice cream—he’d clearly been there longer than them—and stands. “I’ll be sure to tell my father. It was nice seeing you all.” He slips away into the Alley.
Professor Snape shakes his head, “Closer to the next trip. No sense discussing it now when things could change in the coming weeks.”
“I need to make a port-key to Hermione’s house for each of us,” Hari huffs. “Having to use a floo every time I want to go see her will get old quickly.”
“I just…” he flicks a subtle gesture to the dance floor, “I wasn’t prepared for that. I know you said that it’s okay, but seeing it changed something.”
“Given the look on your face, Lord Potter,” Professor Snape drawls, “I gather you have information we will not like.” Hari winces slightly.
“Hermione is a close friend of mine. There are people who don’t like me and have been targeting her because of it. Simply terminating our friendship would not have stopped that. Now,” Hari tilts his head, “I could have simply told these people that she has my protection, but that wouldn’t give me any legal right to act on it.”
Hari looks up, sniffs and wipes at his eyes, then tackles Draco and lets himself cry into his shoulder for a moment.
“And you, as well,” Hari and Lady Longbottom—Augusta reply. Hermione and Neville bow smoothly, leaving the words for their Heads of Houses.
“Okay, you win that one.” They find their seats with the others. “At least my stomach can handle all this food now.”
“No,” Pansy all but wails, “Madam Malkin makes good quality, but mass produced school robes that are designed to grow with you for the school year. Mr. Lazwell makes high-quality robes designed for appearance. He’s up on all the latest fashions and has the best materials.”
I'm attending school online now, from home, and am working five days a week. I have a membership to a kickboxing club and go to classes three days a week. I'm making changes to my diet and making sure to drink plenty of water every day. I've assigned myself a bedtime and get up two hours before work every day, which actually leads to a pretty relaxing morning. While I am not seeking out medication, which I have used previously, making these changes has actually helped me quite a bit. I have a pretty rigid schedule and it really helps. I'll be making sure to make room for writing between batches of homework.
Hari’s lips were just slightly chapped, but still so soft. And he tasted like the hot chocolate and that ice cream Critter likes to make him. Something sweet with an underlying flavor you can’t put a name to, but would know immediately upon tasting. Sweet like the sugar and cinnamon Hari always smells like. Sweet like Draco’s favorite flavors.
“I want to buy ‘Mione an owl,” he whispers, “so we need to hang back and make sure we’re the last in line for the floo.”
“Are you ready to go, then?” Hari looks Draco over. His pale gray robes fit the bill, but his hair and make-up aren’t done yet and there’s no way Draco would ever leave the Manor, or for that matter, their suite looking like that. Draco glances into the mirror, winces, and fixes the two.
Ooookay so I posted the wrong chapter. I'm leaving that one up as chapter 5 and just adding this one in. Sorry for the mix up.
“Would it not be possible to have first years study this year and implement the government class now, with the other six grades taking the class over the summer?”
“I don’t have the time to learn the way you do,” Hari points out, “I had a year and a half to learn everything, and even then, I had to be taught in secret.”
“Snake pit,” Hari mutters, turning to take in their surroundings. The area is grand and practically the opposite of Potter Manor. The marble is black and polished until practically a mirror. The furniture is a pale wood and the detailing is in silver. The carpet and accents are in a rich, emerald green. Hari walks slowly into the house.
“And there’s no chance of her being bought off,” Blaise adds. “But certainly there’s the issue of her being part of the Ministry?”
“They’ll find him,” Draco pauses. “They’ll find both of them. Madam Bones is spectacular at her job and the Auror program has only gotten better since she took over.”
Critter opens the study doors and turns back to Hari, “Lord James is not using the study often and it is being dirty, so Critter is cleaning and organizing when Critter is hearing Master Hari is coming back.”
“As for the masses, just let it be known that we’re dating, but no details—nothing about how we got together or when or anything like that,” Draco orders, staring Pansy down, “just the fact that we’re dating. That and our behavior should be enough.”
“Please hold,” he whimpers desperately. Draco clutches him tight and the group huddles together as close as they can. The Dementor doesn’t give up.
“Now, I know you two would never intentionally miss the carriages,” Professor Snape raises a brow at them, offering a chance to explain themselves.
Hari pulls on the outfit and spells his hair into a classic, slightly messy bun. He picks make-up that makes him look slightly older than he really is. The staff might know his age, but appearances still matter psychologically. If he looks older, they’ll be more likely to treat him as older.
“Master Hari is liking to cook for fun? Lady Lily be doing the same! Critter will teach Master Hari all the recipes Critter is knowing.”
“This new schedule is so much easier,” one of the seventh years sighs as they arrive at the classroom.
“Perfect.” Hari approaches the desk and pulls back the massive chair. It looks comfortable and inviting and Hari almost gives into the temptation to sit in it. The desk itself has an open area for writing, notches to keep extra pages or books on either side, and divots directly in the wood for quills and an inkpot.
“Dobby!” In an instant, the little house elf is in front of them. “Take a message to Mother that my friends and I are going out and will be back in time for dinner.”
“No, there really isn’t,” Hari smiles at Draco. Draco just watches him for a long minute. Hari sighs and realizes Draco is waiting for an answer.
“Us,” Draco replies simply. “We’re talking about us. Mostly,” Draco’s cheeks go a little pink, “because I really like you. Romantically.”
From Blaise, he gets toys to play with in both his animagus forms and (jokingly) catnip. The whole group laughs at that and he and Blaise hug until Draco coughs pointedly.
“It’s getting ridiculous again,” Daphne huffs, “almost as bad as you and Draco.” Hari glances around the room and realizes what they mean. Right, Pansy and Hermione have been dancing around each other. Hari gives Daphne a warning glance. The same thing had been going on with her and Blaise and if Draco succeeds with Pansy and Hermione, he’ll most definitely try again with them. She discreetly waves him off.
Center, sixth row, nine seats in. Where the Gryffindor and Slytherin seats had been. Instead, there is now a chair nearly as extravagant as Merlin and Arthur’s thrones. The seats for every house he claimed have combined to make it so. Because of this, the layout of the room has changed, seats shifting to fill in the gaps his Claims have made where the seats vanished to combine.
“At this time, we will vote for our top ten,” Fudge announces. Hari groans internally. This could be bad for him. He hadn’t considered that the voting would go like this. No—Lucius hadn’t informed him it would be tiered. Glancing at his friends, he can see them peeking at him nervously. It seems they hadn’t known either. Hari makes sure to keep his mask on and tip his head reassuringly.
“He’d never claw me,” Draco says confidently, “And if he did, I’d just wrap his paws and cuddle him more.” Beau yowls even louder and hisses for good measure. Draco lets him down.
? I’m not certain I’ll always be able to come and see you before an event, so it’d be best to have some formal wear on standby.”
“He’s guaranteed not to take issue with you,” Hari tells her, “since our usual group hasn’t arrived yet.” They had gotten ready at Potter Manor—making Critter ecstatic—but that meant they were cut off from the rest of the group and couldn’t coordinate arrival times.
“That’d be the loyalty, then,” Hari chuckles. How no one else in their House can see that Hufflepuffs would make the most trustworthy friends, Hari will never understand. Not that he has Hufflepuff friends himself, but when required to work with one in class, they’re diligent and kind. He’d take working with them over a Ravenclaw any day.
“Subtly,” Hari grumbles, “I don’t want him feeling bad that I can’t understand how he’s pronouncing the cat’s name.”
“No,” Draco shakes his head vehemently, “less than that. Far less. I either have a sinking feeling around someone or a good feeling around them. That’s it.”
“I think you are lacking discipline, Miss Umbridge,” Hari snaps at her, brushing off his shoulder from where it hit the wall. “Most people apologize when they run into someone.”
“Lady Longbottom,” a voice greets them, “Heir Longbottom, Lord Potter, Miss Granger.” Draco walks up, Lucius and Narcissa close on his heels. He bows elegantly, “wonderful to see you all.”
“The Family wing be having nine suites,” Critter announces. “Four for children, one for the Lord and Lady, and four for extra family.” Extended, Hari realizes, so when children age out of living here, they don’t have to move out entirely. “Eight suites is being on this floor. The Lord and Lady’s suite is being on the next floor with the nursery, classroom, and studies.”
“Very well,” she accepts, her back straightening. Flattery: check. “I suppose you are correct. I would, of course, be interested to hear about the other courses.”
Applause echoes again and he trots back proudly. Draco scoops him up and he lets out a rumbling purr.
“It was made for several reasons, including the need to aggregate funds to implement the new classes Hogwarts will be opening this year.” Hari leaves it there, not sure how Finch would react to finding out Hari had actually fired him out of personal dislike and companionship with the elves.
Slowly, ever so slowly, Hari nods. “Yes,” he whispers, not trusting his voice to be any louder and remain even somewhat steady.
“Meaning that much like Diagon Alley, there’s a part of Hogsmeade that has the types of stores my mother frequents,” Draco explains, “We’ll stick to that area. And Honeyduke’s, because apparently, they have the best sweets in the whole villiage.”
“Brilliant idea,” Lord Flint agrees. With all ruffled feathers soothed, they move into discussing titles. Which isn’t a discussion, really, but more of mutual ranting about Dumbledore’s ineptitude and misunderstanding of wix culture. As this occurs, their lunch is delivered.
“Very well,” Professor Snape nods, then his face softens and he leans in. “I’m glad you’re both alright. Be very careful next time. We may have to discuss whether you going into Hogsmeade regularly is a safe idea.”
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Lord of House Potter. So mote it be.” He has to introduce each house separately, as well as his position as Hogwarts’ Heir. So he’ll have to do this seven times. The Potter seat glows and the crest appears in front of Hari in stunning blue magic for just a moment. He’s been accepted. Several people sit back in their seats, seemingly believing he’s done.
“Dude, there’s so many,” Blaise whispers. As he had said, there are a fair amount more crups than kneazles.
“Dinner will be ready when Master and Miss are ready.” Critter nods sharply with a blinding smile and pops away.
“There are,” Draco nods, “but House families tend to go with private tutoring to ensure their children are getting the education they want. And the schools don’t teach magical theory, government, or etiquette. So we’d still have to do studying at home.”
“Other misbehavior would lead to being locked in the cupboard for a set amount of time without food or water. Dudley, the son, was encouraged to play games called ‘Harry Hunting’, in which I would be chased around the neighborhood until I was caught and then beaten mercilessly. It was seen as character building for Dudley.” Blaise’s lip pulls into a sneer, but he nods to Hari to continue. Hari heaves a quick breath and moves on.
They set about translating for Latin in pairs, knowing that working as a group would mean less learning. The paragraph isn’t long, only three or so sentences, and so it doesn’t take too long to work through, even if Draco does make Hari do most of the work. They pass again, checking each other’s work and reviewing the translations communally. Any changes necessary are made and then Latin is put away.
We visit some properties and learn to dance in this one. No big plot events here. Let me know your thoughts!
“Well, it’s just, I’m the owner,” Hari nods at that, “and I was disturbed by the idea that you didn’t know these books were being sold.”
We pick a new Chief Warlock here and there's some Hermione & Hari cuteness and also Draco (does that need any explanation?).
“It may also be beneficial to pair up students scion to peer,” Lord Nott muses, “if only to assist them in understanding each other’s ways.”
“That he’s an idiot for putting Dementors in a school where there’s children who are defenseless against them,” Hari snarls, “and that he’d better get rid of them or come see me as soon as he gets the letter.”
“We went and spoke with the muggles, to inform them of our plan to keep Lord Potter from them. Cursebreaker Weasley had already set up the room Lord Potter would be staying in, but we needed to ensure the secret would not be revealed. When we arrived, we were immediately turned away, as the muggles would not abide ‘our kind’ at their door. We informed them that we intended to ensure they wouldn’t have to see Lord Potter for the summer and they leapt at the chance to hear our plan. They showed nothing but contempt and hatred of the then-eleven-year-old Lord Potter. They were only disappointed they would have to see him at all. They informed us that the amount of time he would be around them that summer was enough to be unbearable—they saw him only for the trips to and from King’s Cross Station, which totaled an hour. Since leaving their house at the age of eleven to attend Hogwarts, Lord Potter has spent a total of an hour and a half in their presence. If asked, I believe they would claim that to still be far too long.”
“I’m really glad that was one of the things I managed to fix,” Hari admits, “I thought I was going to have to stagger meals, which I might have to later when I mix in different classes, but I haven’t decided yet.”
The reaction is instantaneous. She spins on the spot several times then darts off to explore the shelves.
Hermione gives him books. One is on the etymology of tigers, one of rusty spotted cats, and one is about holiday celebrations in Bengal. Hari actually tears up at the third. Draco lets them hug for a while longer than he had with Blaise before coughing.
“Bleeding heart,” Draco teases and they wade into the racks of clothing. In the end, they don’t buy anything from there, but decide that they’ll come back when winter gets closer. At six, they make their way into the restaurant Draco had pointed out.
“Hello, Hogwarts,” Hari murmurs, “I’m here to help.” There’s a warmth that emanates from the stone wall he brushes his fingers against that wasn’t there before. He smiles and makes his way to the kitchens.
“Hari!” Draco calls, poking his head out of one of the rooms, “you’re done with the meeting! What took you so long?”
His lips are soft and definitely not chapped. They press gently but insistently against Hari’s, coaxing him forward and into Draco.
“Good morning, Hermione,” Hari smiles and holds out the necklace he’d found her, “this is a port-key to your house.”
Hari nods, “alright. I’d like to start by looking into firing Argus Filch. I want to add the Wizarding Culture class back as a required class for first years and find some way to back-track and teach the upper years, as well. I also think we need a new teacher and curriculum for History of Magic. It would also be beneficial to teach something of government and politics, even for students not in power, since everyone should understand their government.” There’s nods around the room, so he continues, “I would also like to evaluate whether or not Divination is a class to be taught here.” Hari holds up a hand before anyone can argue, “I realize that it’s value lies in identifying true Seers, however, it is relatively useless to other students. There are other classes I would like to look into adding, ones that were originally part of the Hogwart’s curriculum that have since been removed; the full list is in your files.”
“Good morning, Miss Granger,” Hari greets and holds out his hand. They clasp wrists. “Please, call me Hari.”
His eyes seek out Draco next, finding the boy already staring at him. Draco’s smile is a little more obvious than his mother’s, but what can you expect from a thirteen year old boy looking at his best friend? Hari smiles back, then faces forward. The meeting is beginning.
“I haven’t gone as sophisticated me or nerdy me, yet,” Hari says. “But yes, the other two, I have. I don’t want to play all my cards yet. I don’t want them to know all the versions I can become.”
“According to Father, this is where he gets some of the incredibly rare books for our library,” Draco murmurs. “But it’s also got a nice little fiction section, so let’s go each pick out a book.”
The spokeself studies him for a minute, “we elveses are understanding. May we elveses monitor students to help when needed?”
“They can’t be hurt by the train,” Remus sighs, “they’ll either move, or get out of the way after they’ve been hit.”
“If we were out in public, you would be expected to bow and address him as ‘Lord Potter’ at least once. He would then publicly tell you to call him ‘Hari’ and you would reply that he should call you ‘Hermione’.” Draco snaps his fingers. “And that would be that. Although, if you see him at the Ministry anywhere but, say, the Heir’s Lounge, you would need to call him Lord Potter and get permission again. The Heir’s Lounge is just private enough to get away with not using titles for anyone, though, so don't worry about it there.”
“I will,” Hari promises. “The charm I’d like to use will take the location of your home from the minds of everyone who knows it. I would be the only one able to give the information out. Not even you or your husband could tell someone. The wizard wouldn’t be able to find Hermione here with it.”
“Now,” Narcissa rises and speaks in her ‘Healer’ voice, “they may be quick to get sore tomorrow, so here’s a pain potion. Take it when you get up, don’t try to tough it out. Your feet and your gait are important. Take it a bit easier than normal so the soreness won’t last any longer than tomorrow. After that, they should be back entirely to normal. Muscles are fickle, though, so if they’re still sore, let one of us know as soon as you can.”
“I, Lord Hari James Potter, as Earl of Gryffindor and Duke of Slytherin, hereby claim my rightful position as Heir to Hogwarts. So mote it be.” Four magics swirl around him, red, green, blue, and yellow. The chairs of each Hogwarts founder glow brightly for an instant, than everything fades.
“I do,” the Ravenclaw nods, “I never knew that wix had a different culture. This is technically my culture, too, and I’m mad Dumbledore kept it from us.”
“Hey, everyone,” he smiles up at them. They take their seats and the train lurches, starting the trip to Hogwarts. Hari starts Hermione’s design, settling on one he’d seen in pictures Sirius gave him of his
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Baron of House Black. So mote it be.” There’s more surprised shifting at this, but they accept it quickly, just as soon as the magic accepts Hari. The black swirling lines fade away and Hari takes a breath to begin again.
Their second song ends and they quickly sweep off the floor, making the rounds and catching Hermione again. After some food, a short, but warm speech from Lord Nott, and a lot more dancing, the Malfoys are getting ready to head out.
“Heir Malfoy, I’m aware you’re prone to fits of hysteria, but can you perhaps not spill blood everywhere?” Professor Snape glares at him.
All of it makes Draco want to wrap Hari in cotton wool and hide him away from the world. He’s too pure and sweet and innocent to have to face all this and bear the evil.
“If he’s here in person,” Hari smiles, “he has to be around the Dementors and see the effects they’re having. Maybe a tour around the grounds and a chat with one of them will do him some good.”
Hari nods, “Andromeda Tonks. She was part of the House of Black and rescinded the title to marry her husband. She has a unique view of our culture and traditions and will be understanding towards muggleborns because of her husband.”
“I’m stopping in at Potter Manor to drop off the file and look over some of the information.” He studies her for a moment, “You’re welcome to come with me if you like. I was planning on having dinner at Malfoy Manor, but we can let them know we’ll be eating elsewhere.”
Sure enough, Madam Bones makes it into the top ten, if only by grace of Hari’s mass amount of titles. Thankfully, all votes are anonymous, so no one can tell who he voted for.
There’s a ripple of shock through the chamber before the Minister stands, “I call to put this to vote.”
“Then,” Lord Flint rises, “have a wonderful week.” They all rise and bow to Hari. Only Lucius remains behind.
“So, Lord Potter,” Minister Fudge catches him before he can get inside the chambers. Hari holds his sigh inside and turns to face the man. “I hear you are submitting a nomination for Chief Warlock.”
There’s the chocolate, from the treats and the drinks. The butterbeer from earlier. And some flavor that is entirely Draco and Hari knows if he ever tasted it again, even without seeing or feeling or smelling Draco, he would know it.
“Hari, we might have to tell my parents I’m spending the night,” she calls and runs over to inspect a window seat, “this place is spectacular.”
“I’m going to show her the room downstairs,” he winks conspiratorially, “and then we will be ready for dinner. Is that acceptable?”
“Okay,” he raises both hands when it looks like everyone is turning red, “let’s be logical about this. Right now, there’s far too many scions of Houses to place all of them in private rooms. However, we could separate scions and typical students within the dormitories themselves. Heirs and such would be allowed access to the private suites their families invested in.”
“My father voted someone similar up,” Daphne realizes. “Someone more extreme than he’d usually vote for.”
“The bill has been discarded,” Dumbledore announces and Umbridge mutters angrily in her seat. Hari glances at her, irritated, but turns back to Dumbledore. It’s already almost twelve-thirty, the silly woman managed to talk for over two hours about her lies, and Hari wants lunch.
“It’s interesting how you say ‘we’ have a busy day when we both know I’m the only one with work to do,” Hari grumbles.
“It may also be a good idea to encourage an enforced group-study,” Lady Longbottom suggests, “so that scions and their peers interact more.”
He reaches his seat and all the other Lords, Ladies, and Heirs stand as one to bow to him. The House of Potter isn’t the highest House in the chamber, despite its Primacy over the two Founding Houses, but his titles combined make him the most powerful person in the room. Hari supposes he shouldn’t be surprised that tradition will be a little warped and place him at the top of the hierarchy instead of the other way around.
“You all probably know where this all begins. The night my parents died. As you all know, my parents intended for my legal guardian to be my godfather, Sirius Black, who, at the time, was Heir Black and an accomplished Auror and Hit Wizard. Had their will been read, been opened by anyone, this would have been public knowledge. In fact, their will contained the true information about their Secret Keeper and the person who performed the Fidlius Charm for them. Said person is the one who placed me in the house I would live in for the next ten years.
“Just keep using the cute to your advantage and it’ll all go swimmingly,” Daphne promises, patting Hari gently on the hand. Hari rolls his eyes but is grinning wildly on the inside. Hey, if it works…
“Adding your house to the floo network,” Hari explains, “then you’ll be able to come and go as you please.”
“Yes, you should have,” Draco sniffs and starts to walk out of the room, “because now you don’t get cuddles.”
“Okay, I have the notes for Professor McGonagall, let’s get through that first,” Draco slides out a heavily notated sheet of parchment and stacks two more behind it, “then we do translating for Latin, and the problems for Runes. We’ll read Herbology first, then Beasts.” Beasts is one they can usually get away with doing the minimum of the reading for. “We discuss Muggle Studies last.”
Alright, so I have definitely decided that Dumbledore's trial will take place in book four. It just doesn't fit in book three, which has officially broke 70k. I don't want book three to be massively larger than all the other books, so I'll just tweak the general plan slightly. It'll work out.
“No. She’s too…” Draco waves a hand after her. “I don’t really know how to say it. Yes, she’s very loyal and hard-working, but she’s also absolutely crazy. I swear, you say one bad thing about someone or something she cares about, you’ll find yourself dead and buried before you have a chance to apologize.”
