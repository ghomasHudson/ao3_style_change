Then he thought about why exactly they'd gone back to their old-school rivalry. It seemed very childish all of a sudden. It had probably happened because Draco hadn't known how to act in front of Potter each time he saw him after the war. He didn't know how to justify his actions during and before the war, and he didn't know how to react to him standing up for him during the trial. Because of this, he'd reverted to the childish mockery, just to get a hold of himself in front of the Gryffindor.
He looked up at the Gryffindor, a mildly agitated look still lingering on his face. He noticed how the other's hair was a wild black mess, even messier than usual if that was even possible. He looked tired too, but probably less than Draco. He was like an actual lion who'd just woken up from a nap, Draco noticed. That was really all it could remind him of.
Suppressing a grin, he led the way back with Potter on his heels.
"Yes, you have, Malfoy. Ever since you met him in your first year. Sorry, but I dare say you've been quite obsessed with the boy for many years now. I know it used to be out of envy and hate, but now, after the war… I don't think you hate him anymore Draco. It's something else now. I guessed it had something to do with regret, and I was right." She stopped for a moment to glance down at him. Her expression was a bit puzzled. When she continued, her voice was softer and more hesitant than before. "But there's more to it, and I'm not sure what it is. I just care about you, and if this is troubling you-"
The Slytherin didn't move and just kind of looked at the other.
Harry had fallen asleep not long after Draco had left. He had been quite peaceful until he heard distant voices. They were quite familiar, but he couldn't quite figure out from where or who they belonged to. When someone shook him, he groaned hitting the back of the person's hand. "Let me sleep."
In shock, he didn't know what to stare at rather as the bridge and the tree. Yes, very convincing.
His reaction couldn't be vague either. Since when did he even plan his answers thoroughly like this, though? It lay on the tip of his tongue, a small laugh, 'what? No. Haha, what made you even think that?'. Something along those lines. But nothing came out. He was just gaping like some stupid goldfish at the other, eyes shifting to different places as he had no idea what to do with himself.
He wasn't losing the other over this, was he? That couldn't happen.
He wanted to laugh. Stepping closer to the other unconsciously.
"Anyway," he resumed, "should we get it over with right now, or can't you bear any more of me at the moment?" Still rubbing the sore spot on his head Harry huffed and turned to the other, unable to stop a small smile to form on his lips. "Oh yeah, duh. I always bang my head on tables in hopes to become friends." Once again he shifted in his seat, this time to open his books.
Now that he thought about it, all of this seemed too perfect to be true.
Pansy grinned sweetly at him. That couldn't be good. "Because you're finally excited about something again. I like it when you get all bossy and determined, that means you're happy." She lowered her voice a bit. "You've been all depressed lately, grumpy and agitated. This is the first time this year you're actually excited about something. Let me have my proud friend moment, would you?"
Honestly, he was turning into Granger. He let out a slightly irritated sigh and leaned back in his chair.
By the time he'd finally finished the last bit of his homework, Draco realized he'd missed dinner. He decided he could manage without it for one night since he was absolutely not in the mood to interact with anyone. Maybe it was best to call it a night and deal with everything the next morning. He'd finished his homework, so tomorrow he would have enough time to look for his ice skates and try the lake again. Though he was sure more students would've gotten that idea by now, it would probably not be as deserted as it had been today.
After a while, Draco was done talking. He'd explained what needed to be explained, and it was Potter's job to write it down. He couldn't become too kind towards his rival now, right?
Harry looked up for a second before looking down on his notes again. "I would say 'be as kind as to help me then' but then again, you're a Malfoy. Slytherin to top." He was silent for a while as it dawned on him that he had actually written quite some nonsense on his paper and tried to ignore the heat that sprawled to his cheeks. "Don't you have anything better to do, anyway?"
"Well," Luna said. "If Harry trusts you, then I don't think it's that bad."
Draco sniffed. "Oh, I'm sure they would have done a thing like that… And I would've went along with it…" He stopped for a moment. It was true, he had heard his parents talk about arranged marriages, he'd grown up thinking it was his destiny. He'd always thought he had to preserve his status, that it was a very good thing to marry someone from a wealthy, pureblood family. However, the war had changed this, as it had changed many things.
Harry groaned as the other moved to the middle, weaker-looking part of the lake. He even taunted him and as much as he wanted to prove the other wrong, something told him not to go there. Yet he couldn't back down now, could he? Trying to hum inside his head to keep himself calm, his eyes darted to the ice as he stepped closer. That damn ice moved as a blanket. How the Slytherin didn't seem to have any problems with that was a miracle, yet Harry tried to look unfazed.
Actually, Hermione was going with Ron now the two of them were dating. After the war and his break-up with Ginny, he did not feel like spending this year with the Weasley family. He felt responsible for Fred's death as well. If he had known about the sword, the snake, necklace and all these other Horcruxes carrying parts of Voldemort's soul he could have spared so many lives. Fred's life for one. People had died just because of him. No. He didn't feel like he was allowed to spend Christmas with the Weasleys as if nothing had happened.
Draco was a bit startled by all of this, but collected himself and looked over at the other. Harry raised his eyebrow before sitting up straighter in the bed.
"You couldn't have told them, and they wouldn't have believed me. They'll find out eventually, you're not dying." The blonde told him. Maybe it was because he'd been taught to be self-dependant all throughout his childhood, or maybe it was because most Slytherins tended to keep their issues to themselves. Whichever reason it was, to Malfoy it didn't seem important to notify the whole school about this fainting problem. "What do you think it is anyway?" He asked as they neared the hospital wing.
"Other as that I have problems sleeping," Harry mumbled. "I don't see why my lack of sleep or that I drink less would cause any of this. Or someone has to have poisoned my food or anything…" Malfoy let out a deep sigh. "A lack of sleep and dehydration can absolutely lead up to a thing like this, has no one ever told you that?" He had experience with this sort of thing, as he also tended to forget to sleep or eat during long study sessions. But at least he knew it was bad, Potter didn't seem to notice how severe it could get.
"I'll see you later. We can discuss the details of the party by then as well." With these words, he decided to walk away.
After a while, Draco was done talking. He'd explained what needed to be explained, and it was Potter's job to write it down. He couldn't become too kind towards his rival now, right?
While Malfoy and he had been fighting in the past years, he had never really hated the guy, nor his friends. Though he couldn't be sure to say Hermione felt the same way about the girl. Deep in thought, he started to play with the blanket, humming now and then. There had to be an easy way though, right? After all, if these guys really were befriended with the blond, they should accept his decisions, right?
Harry sneezed as he tried to keep the cup of hot chocolate in his hands straight.
Harry huffed. "True. Well, since you came up with that oh so brilliant idea, why don't you take the honors to gather those as well, hmm?" Malfoy was right, they should let others help decide on the party if they were gonna get all the houses together. Harry tried not to yawn again, making a wetness flow and glaze his vision. He was tired, yet he didn't want to fall asleep, not yet.
"Hey, so about Christmas," he started, "we could celebrate it with all the students that stay at Hogwarts. We could plan it out, use the room of Requirement, make it a real party." Now Draco wasn't sure if any student, except for the Slytherins, would be willing to do something that he'd proposed. None of the remaining eight-year students seemed to have forgiven him for his actions during the war. He didn't blame them, and he would never ask them to forgive him, but it still hurt. There was a big chance no one would want to come, but maybe if Harry hosted it… Maybe he could just help behind the scenes, make it a great party to repay them for what he'd done to their friends and family.
Of course, the library again. He nodded and turned around on his heels. As he came back to the table he assembled the papers."Can you keep it with you?" He asked the blond, not handing it to him or waiting for a reaction as he placed the bundle of loose parchments on the table next to the other before he walked away again. This time he wasn't searching someone to help or come to the party, but just someone who could get his mind of… other things.
"I didn't really know what your plans were, so for now I just put down that it was a Christmas celebration," she said, handing him one of the papers.
That turned around quite quickly. But did he want the other to do his homework for him? Surely, Snape would put him in detention or give him a load of extra work to do if he messed this assignment up. Yet, what could he even offer the Slytherin? He would have to do it on his own. Or, well…
It didn't break. It didn't make a sound, but he wanted to be sure. He lifted his foot again and kicked as hard as he could. Nothing.
Harry frowned. Malfoy was right, why did he just assume they wouldn't be in the common room? They had often spent their time there after all, even if they had been around other people. Hermione would maybe drag Ron to the library, and if she wanted a kiss she simply pecked his lips.
Since Draco was used to play while standing, he was able to move around. This, of course, led to him turning around while playing and noticing that he wasn't alone anymore. It took him a few seconds to register that there was an actual person standing in the room he had thought to be empty, and it took another few to acknowledge that it was Potter.
When Draco finally started to wake up, the first thing he noticed was the absence of warmth. He shifted a little and moved a hand towards the place where the warmth should be, but only found empty sheets. It took him a while to fully wake up and realize that he was actually looking for Potter and that he'd already left.
"You want to talk about it?" he asked, unsure if he should ask.
It wasn't like Draco said this to be mean or mocking, he was just being practical. Maybe it was also a bit because he was very used to people doing stuff for him, but that wasn't how he wanted to treat Potter.
That stupid Parkinson clinging on Malfoy wouldn't get off his mind and he liked to say he actually despised this feeling. If only the blond would forget all about his stupid confession, he would do so as well and surely things would turn out fine. He had gotten over Cho Chang, he had gotten over Ginny, so he could get over Slytherin boy Malfoy as well.
Harry pulled his sweater back down, making sure he didn't look that messed up before holding his hand out for the other to take.
He had wanted to ask some Ravenclaws to help them keep track of things, now that he was requiting people anyway, but Pansy had stopped him, reminding him of the fact that most other houses probably wouldn't listen to him. Being reminded of this darkened his mood a bit, but made him decide to go to find Potter first. Draco had a great talent for convincing people, but even that couldn't overpower deep prejudice and resentment. Potter would be able to do a better job on it than he would.
Draco felt himself stiffen instantly at the mention of his mother. "We haven't… I haven't spoken much with her ever since the war. It's become a touchy subject to my parents anyway…" Draco wasn't sure what Potter was referring to.
He looked back at the Gryffindor and realized how out of place he looked in the clean, white hospital bed. Yes, he looked tired, but he wasn't the type to stay in bed all day, even Malfoy knew that. He kind of looked like a lost puppy.
"Sounds great," the Slytherin nodded and followed Potter to the kitchens. He'd never been there, but he'd heard about it. He knew Hufflepuff had its dormitories around there. He had also met some of the house elves, due to his extremely fucked up studying and sleeping schedule in his sixth year. There had been a few occasions where he'd been studying until four in the morning or pacing around the common room because he couldn't sleep. Because this was the time when house-elves tended to clean rooms, he'd met them a few times. He'd also woken up a few times with a small plate of snacks and tea next to his books. It was charming how caring they could be.
Then, suddenly, he began to think of another idea. He looked up at the other, already excited.
He wriggled himself out of their position in order to stand up, groaning as he stretched.
He lifted his hand a bit, as to ask the other to stop walking. He turned back towards the lake and walked closer to it. When he reached the edge, he carefully put a foot on the ice. After making sure it wasn't breaking already, he lifted a bit more of his weight onto it, checking how sturdy it really was.
This room seemed quite like a peaceful place, as a room made purely to drink coffee and tea and look pretty. A room from paintings in which the people were looking calm, had smiles on their faces. While he had never really seen Lucius Malfoy treat his son all that kindly, he had no idea what the man was like behind closed doors. He didn't dare to ask as well, that was not something he should ask. Rather, they should think about stuff like the party. That was what he came here for anyway.
Both a little surprised as wary the redhead turned to him.
It didn't take long for the tiny creatures to notice their presence. They seemed to recognize Potter, Draco guessed he'd been here a few times before.
The blonde faintly wondered what it would look like without the sweater covering everything up, but kept himself satisfied with the accidental revealing he'd caused with his tracing touches. Draco finally understood why students liked to use this room.
Draco wanted to tell the other how amazing he was, how much he felt for him and all sorts of stuff like that, but he couldn't.
Not hesitating one bit he made his way out. It was only when he was far from the room, out of the dungeons and on the stairs, that he let out a relieved breath. Though he didn't really understand why he felt this shaky, somewhat put-off, around there
"Having you kiss me and then pulling back, showing clearly you disliked that? That hurts like hell. Like… youŕe toying with me."
He sat up and tried to rub the sleep out of his face. Then he raked a hand through his hair to get it out of the way. Maybe he should just get ready to go to class, it was Monday after all.
He didn't even know, and he didn't care either.
He decided to grab some water when he took notice of his dry throat. It was not as if Malfoy would wake up now or that the other needed to see him when he woke up or whatever anyway.
The Slytherin gave him a perplexed look. "Scared of the forest, you mean? Well excuse me, but any person with a functioning pair of brains would do well to be scared of that. I'm sure you understand why, seeing as you've faced most of what lives there throughout the years already."
Blaise frowned at him, clearly not having expected that to be the reason for his absence lately. "Why?" He asked, seeming almost a little merely returned his offense with a cold glare. "Because I've decided to come to terms with my childish past, and apologize for it."
After Ron and Hermione had left Harry had tried and failed, to fall back asleep. It made him frustrated. He was tired, but he couldn't help but think about what Ron had said. Malfoy had helped him while they had even failed to notice how bad he felt.
"I'm not going to deny what happened during the war. A lot of Slytherins have acted terrible, including me, which is why you're right to feel resentment towards me or my house. I'm aware that a party won't heal all of your wounds, some are too deep to ever fully heal, but I hope this party could provide the people who've done wrong to apologize and the people who've been hurt to forgive."
"Very philosophical," the blonde replied dryly. "Though I believe that if you want an empty mind, you should go to Weasley, he's got one. Must be very quiet in there."
He suddenly felt a lot younger, like he'd returned to the time before his sixth year. When he'd run over the lake with his friends, being total prats but having fun nonetheless. He took a few more steps, tried to gather some speed, and then let himself slip over the ice as if he was skating already. He'd totally forgotten about the puzzled Gryffindor who was standing at the edge of the lake already. He hadn't felt this liberated in ages.
Harry stirred when the dreaded question left the guy's mouth. Ron and Hermione hadn't asked it yet, something he had been glad for. To think it would be Malfoy to ask him how he had made it to this point of self-neglect.
"I'm not saying you have to order more, I just want you to finish it properly," Draco explained.
"They don't love me like parents love their children. They never have. My mom might, but my dad's word is stronger than hers. I'm merely an important object that has lost its worth, and thus lost its importance."
"Hmm, you might be right. How could I even think about that? I mean, that your dad doesn't write back didn't even bother you the slightest bit. How could I even think you had something even close to likable in you. Thanks for confirming things," he countered.
As Harry walked away, Draco got up. "THAT'S WHAT SHE SAAAID."
He stopped and smiled lightly, looking around a bit. "But that's all there is to it," he concluded. He'd left some parts out, but Potter would never know that.
Harry is still in the hospital wing, things don't go well with Ron and Hermione, and Harry gets a little too close for comfort to Draco
"Stop it, Ron," he growled. He knew what actions Malfoy had committed, there were some he had known about and some he had heard about at the trial. But he had never believed Malfoy, the boy who most times were only bark and no bite, would do any of that if he wasn't forced to. People had died because of him as well, didn't that make him unlikeable as well? He just didn't want to hear any of it anymore, it only brought back bad thoughts.
"Yeah! We need to know what to expect."
Once again, the blonde got reminded that Potter was absolutely a well-trained Quidditch player.
He knew Potter had been joking, but who was he to let a comment like that slip by untouched? Besides… Hadn't they been trying to overpower each other like this for years?
"Yeah," he simply replied, taking a sip from his water. "In fact, we're planning to have a Christmas celebration with all four houses. You know, to have the Christmas spirit" Hermione rose her eyebrows at that while Ron whistled. "Bringing the houses together, huh? That's uhm…" he glanced behind the other before eyeing him again. "You know there will be other Slytherin students staying back here as well, right?"
Pansy gave him a mild glare, absolutely not taking this for an answer.
Silence fell between them as the students around them silently muttered to one another. Harry felt his anger fly out the window as if someone just used Expelliarmus on it. "I mean… He's very busy… Very important…" Draco added to his previous words.
"I'm sure you two have talked it through just now, but I expect you want to hear it from me too," he shifted his gaze to the redhead. "Potter and I have indeed put aside our differences, and I was hoping you'd be willing to give me a chance too. Now, I'm not asking you to become a friend, I can see that would be quite a thing to ask in my current position. However, I would like to be able to hang out with Harry without you and Granger trying to glare me to death. I understand it's difficult to forget what I've done, and who I've been, but I'm not asking you to do that. All I want is to bury the hatchet, and for that to happen, I suppose I should apologize for what I've done. I owe you, Granger, Potter, and many others a great apology, so I'll start it right here. I'm sorry for what I've done during the war, and I apologize for being such a childish prick during the years before that. Please, forgive me for all the ugly names I've called you, that was an awful thing for me to do."
Ruffling his own hair he searched for words to start. He knew what he wanted to say, but how? Contemplating, he failed to notice how long he let Malfoy wait. Draco was patient though. He rarely rushed things anyway. This also seemed like a difficult topic, especially with your ex-enemy. Maybe it had been a bit rude to make him talk about it, but Draco knew from experience that talking about it was way better than bottling it up. If Potter hadn't told his friends yet, maybe it was better to tell someone who wasn't quite a friend.
"How's Christmas at the Weasley's though?" Draco suddenly asked. He'd been rather curious about it, and he needed a distraction anyway.
He made sure that he gathered all his belonging and yawned as he walked off. It had been quite problematic to get back as his attention was all over the place. The stairs had moved halfway and he started talking to the small painting in front of him. So much for getting more rest.
They joined Luna in the great hall, who smiled at them in greeting. There were quite some students still inside even though Harry had seen a lot of students bundled in jackets heading outside. Just as he sat down Ron and Hermione came walking in, Hermione with a stack of books under her arms.
"You know, that was the point… " he mumbled hoarsely. "To scare you."
That thing was too damn hot anyway.
"I'm not mature enough? And you are then?" Blaise scowled. "We have endured your complaints about Potter for eight years now, you've been the most childish of us all, and now suddenly we're the immature ones?" His voice was filled with rage that had probably been bottled up for quite a while. It surprised Malfoy, but not enough for him to show it.
"Only because you said you trust him. If I think I have to be cautious I'll use my wand, Harry."
Lightly, Harry let his head fall on the table forehead first as Hermione started ranting about how Parkinson was the worst person in the world, after Malfoy of course. He could never just come out and say it without Hermione trying to cast spells on him. She would believe someone cast a spell on him that caused him to see a kind side to Malfoy. But he honestly did, he just knew that the blonde wasn't actually all that bad. If he were, he wouldn't have wasted his time by helping him out with his homework. Would he?
A silence fell as soon as Draco was done talking. Blaise kept scowling at him, but his other friends, who'd been sitting there during the whole argument, simply looked away with a guilty expression. Draco knew everyone here was dealing with the same regrets, each person just acted them out differently. Draco just so happened to be the first person to bring that to the light, to undertake some action.
Those would've looked good with Slytherin robes, Draco noticed.
When Harry heard the first sniff, he didn't think much of it. People do that sometimes. It was when he felt the other nuzzle his face in his sweater, that he felt something wet that he automatically pushed himself away. Malfoy obviously didn't want him to see him this way, yet he couldn't help himself.
His movements had gotten a tad crude and impulsive, merely serving to act out his needs.
Harry ignored his squeaking voice, ignored how his cheeks burned. Going outside seemed like a wonderful option right now.
The request had put the other off. Draco sounded so serious about this. But why did he ask such a thing? Was he ashamed about his actions after all? Nah, no way. He had said it himself, he was not the kind of person to be affected by such trivial things. Something about Draco's posture and the look on his face was off though. "Is that all?" he simply asked. "I suppose it is," Draco replied, taking his hands off the chair he'd been leaning on and straightening up. There wasn't much else he could say about it.
But there was another possible reason. Draco was alone. And that didn't mean he had no friends because he did, but then why did he feel so miserable as soon as he'd closed the curtains around his bed? Why could he be in a room filled with friends, but still feel like no one was enough for him? He felt like they didn't know him like he didn't fit in this school anymore after everything that had happened. Maybe he should've gone with his parents when they had asked him if he wanted to finish school or leave with them.
Draco neatly sat down beside him, keeping his distance, but being close enough to look at the book and explain it. Yes, he was actually doing this. What a disgrace…. "Right, first of all, the information you've already have. You can completely discard that." He took a new roll of parchment and spread it out on the desk. He then continued to explain what was wrong, and what it should be. He could've done that with kind words, but he decided to put it as it was: harsh and clear.
He turned around and started walking towards the hospital wing, telling himself over and over again that this was just because bringing Potter there had made him responsible. That was the only reason for his curiosity for the other's wellbeing.
Not waiting for the other to respond, he turned to walk off.
His voice had sounded very calm and low, but now that he thought about it, that could just be the thing that made it sound threatening.
"Well, I'm not that fond of having a near panic attack, thank you very much. And why would you even want to- You know what, never mind. Let's just get off the ice."
"Wouldn't be asking you if I did," Harry responded.
To hear him say that surprised him, yet he felt quite grateful for that. With a huff, he flashed the other a little smile. "Thanks, Mal."
It then occurred to him that Potter had a legit reason to be here: he'd come to check the location for the party. Totally obvious and without bad intentions. Draco had just been so stupid to not lock the door. Though, he had always assumed the room did this for him. He'd never locked the door, but no one had ever come in.
His whole body was shaking with adrenaline.
He'd kissed him. He'd actually kissed Potter. And not just that, he had done it impulsively, without a second thought and without asking if Harry was okay with that.
Malfoy nodded and followed the other back to the castle. As soon as they went inside, he could feel how cold it had been outside. The sudden warmth surprised him but felt incredibly good. "The great hall doesn't serve tea around this hour though," he noticed as they walked towards the entrance of the hall.
"I'm a businessman Potter," he said. "I'll do it if you've got something interesting to offer me in return."
"Will we return here, after getting the food?" He asked, looking back at the room as they walked towards the door.
After a while, Draco realized he'd been spouting ideas and words at the others. Maybe he should contain himself a bit before he started to order people around. He was just so used to planning things out, telling others what to do, and coming with ideas, that planning a party like this came naturally to him. He knew what to do if he wanted something and this was no exception.
However, instead of walking over to the water, he stayed put.
He turned his eyes away to stare in the distance. After the war things changed drastically, but for people to think they couldn't afford to love someone, nor to be loved by someone else. That was quite sad. Though he wasn't one to speak of that. Before Hogwarts, love was a concept he hadn't really known. It had been a luxury for him as well if he were to say so himself. He could understand where Malfoy was coming from, yet he still thought it was quite sad that a person had to have such thoughts. To think of themselves as scum.
He was quite proud at himself for a minute when realization dawned on him that he had been acting normal around the blonde even after their way too cozy moments. Surely, he didn't mind, but to keep their friendship secured he had to keep his feelings out of it. He should count himself lucky that they didn't have to go through that ridiculous rivalry for another year. Harry sniffed at the sight of his plate. He wasn't hungry anymore after all that drama if he were to be honest.
"What, scared, Potter?" He yelled, grinning broadly at the little reference he'd made.
Draco found it hard to sympathize with people, but it wasn't hard to see that Potter was completely out of this world. He wasn't going to drink the potion in this condition either, which left Malfoy no other choice but to help him. He made his way to the bed and uncorked the small flask. "Could you please drink this, before you slip away any further?" Was he really doing this? Was he actually taking care of this guy? How did they end up like this…
With a soft smile on his face at that remark, Harry brought their lips back together for a few seconds.
Draco picked up the blanket and draped it over the other. "Occupied?" He asked.
Draco looked up, wearing a confused expression. Now that the Gryffindor had gotten up he was cold again.
A small hum left his lips as he dared to lay his head to rest on the blond boy's chest. It felt perilous to just act so freely with the Slytherin and sleep together with him, again. Yet laying down, cuddled up with the other in his arms he felt warm.
Yes this was weird, and yes it was very new to him, but then why did it feel so cozy? It felt like there was simply a cat sleeping on him. However, this wasn't a cat and if anyone were to walk in right now, Malfoy's reputation and carefully composed image were gone.
"Trying might not even be the right way to say it. No failure allowed." He spoke short and quick. He wanted to wrap this up before Pansy would notice they hadn't been swearing at each other yet. "Come on, let's go," He muttered to the girl. Draco had never felt bad after annoying Potter. Not once. But this time, he felt strangely rude to leave just like this. However, he wasn't allowed to think about this too much. It was better to pretend as nothing had happened to their usual rivalry. Surely, everything would be back to normal tomorrow, he thought as he walked down the library.
"What would be a good place around here to have some romantic moment?"
The Gryffindor reflected all of these things, proving that they were both reduced to the same kind of a mess.
"I'm leaving," he exclaimed.
With a huff the guy pulled himself up, rubbing his eyes. "Sure."
Not kissing the blond while he was so close to him was unnerving him already.
Harry sighed. "Saying I should get soup?"
"Didn't know you had that weak spot all along," he added, now crossing his leg upon the bed while he leaned back on his hands, smirk still there and one of his eyebrows now raising up as well. Yes, teasing was fun.
"Great." Draco stepped back but hesitated. Potter seemed very agitated. It'd be a shame to let that go to waste. "That potion requires a boomslang skin, not bloodroot," he remarked while scanning the list of sloppily written words beneath the other boy. "As much as I enjoy watching Snape roasting you over the tiniest mistakes, I can't stand stupidity."
He had cuddled up on the other? Harry didn't have any collection of that at all, but then again he had no evidence to suggest he had not done any of such thing. But maybe it was an instinct in him. He had slept quite peacefully this night because someone else had been there. Maybe that was what he needed after all. Yet he couldn't just ask someone to sleep with him, now could he?
It didn't feel right to get the Gryffindor addicted to some kind of potion to sleep better. After all, that probably wasn't even the only remedy. Or maybe that was just what Draco liked to believe.
His chest was burning, his face was flushed and his general looks were a mess.
"Great." Draco stepped back but hesitated. Potter seemed very agitated. It'd be a shame to let that go to waste. "That potion requires a boomslang skin, not bloodroot," he remarked while scanning the list of sloppily written words beneath the other boy. "As much as I enjoy watching Snape roasting you over the tiniest mistakes, I can't stand stupidity."
The boy with his wild, messy hair had paused shortly at the other's request. What was he even doing? Harry had silently watched the other try the sturdiness of the frozen lake before the blonde really set his weight on it and his own breath caught in his throat. He had even prayed for whatever being out there that the ice wouldn't break. But now, as he had come closer to the edge of the lake, he could see Malfoy actually enjoying himself just sliding on the slippery ice of the frozen lake. It seemed childish, but he knew how he had enjoyed doing that with Ron and Hermione before the war in the earlier years as well.
But Potter had to know, which was the only reason he'd been able to say any of this out loud. He had the right to at least know what hat driven Malfoy to do those terrible things.
There was no other solution, he had to trust this idea.
Harry felt breathless as soon as the blonde played. The smooth sways he made and the concentrated gaze on the paper, made him really admire this. He had the front row to something that was so personal in the Slytherin's eyes.
Draco, who they deemed a traitor, kissing and cuddling up with him, their hero, like this.
Ignoring the screaming in his head, the 'you must be misunderstanding this!', he pressed back against the blond's lips.
Allowing himself to melt at Malfoy gazing at him, the corners of his mouth couldn't get out of their risen state.
It couldn't be possible that Ron absolutely wasn't mature enough to allow Malfoy to explain things, to apologize, and to talk to him in peace. They could sort this out.
This did not happen.
He'd said it to protect himself, but when he looked back at it, it was a bit… well, very rude actually. Maybe that was really just the thing that'd put him into Slytherin. He thought about apologizing but didn't. Potter wasn't worth his effort, right?
"And you're underestimating my skills to fail to listen to others, Malfoy." He was acting stubborn now, but that could have to do with it stretching the time the blonde was here to keep him company. He wasn't too sure, honestly.
He decided to shrug it off, pretend like he was really just trying to help the other. "And I'm saying this because I think it would help," he said.
As the blonde remarked about him looking like an actual lion though, his mind was a blank slate. Confused, Harry stared at the other until his hand found his locks and it clicked. His hair was a mess in the morning, he knew cause he was the person to deal with it every other single day. Well, he just brushed it out that is...
"Or maybe he doesn't…" Draco continued. "Not that much of a surprise, I must say."
"Well, it's a bit cold, but it's a good place, I guess. Let's go there."
That it disappointed him to hide their love.
When the elves turned to him, Harry had already given up on brewing the tea himself.
Returning the smile, he shifted in the chair. "̈That was no problem, really. You play beautifully, I should have to thank you."
The blonde looked at him for a moment, still thinking about how he could also get rid of Potter's homework problem. There was a solution, but it would keep him in the hospital wing for a while longer. And as much as he wanted to return to his room, preferably with a nice cup of tea, he also promised the other to help. Besides, he didn't dislike having company. The Slytherin dungeons would just feel cold and lonely at this hour.
Draco eventually decided to use this silence to say the thing he'd actually intended to tell them when he came here. "Me and Potter have decided to host an inter-house party, to celebrate Christmas but also to get rid of some of the tensenesses that have been between the houses ever since the war. I'm not forcing any of you to help or come, but I would like to remind you that this is the chance to show that we're not the bullies anymore."
His heart was racing and his breath was quite irregular, sometimes even stopping.
While he thought he had been burning up before, now he felt like lava had spilled all over him.
"We should head back," he said and quickly made a move to leave.
Sharp inhales of air, gaspy breathing, and other uncontrolled sounds.
A little hum left the boy's lips. "Possibly," he mumbled. He didn't really know what had caused the nightmare to be held back. Maybe Malfoy was right and it was due Pomfrey's potion. If that were the case he would love to get some more, yet he couldn't handle getting addicted to such a thing. He hung his head down, his hands cupping around his face as he let out a frustrated groan. Why was it so hard to just deal with this? If he were to just sleep normally he wouldn't have to come back here so many these times.
Harry halted and lingered to stay like the other had asked, pondering whether he shouldn't just leave the other alone. He felt like he should stay now the other had proposed to explain the situation, and honestly, he was quite curious about this room and about since when the other started playing, why he had never known about this.
A frown edged on the other's face. Malfoy was worried about him, that shouldn't surprise him as much as it did. They had become friends, after all, it was a friend-thing to do - worry about a friend in the hospital wing that is.
"It's okay, Hermione. Pomfrey allowed me to-"
Oh, Ron and Hermione. Harry wondered if they would even listen to Malfoy. They didn't really like the boy nor would they take his words. Yet, he did just disappear so they should worry about that at least, right?
No one would expect such a room to be a part of the Malfoy Manor, which was dark, mostly wooden and decorated with silver and green tones. It was a practically forgotten room, which resided right next to the gardens.
Nightmares.
"Just before you say anything," he started, his voice a bit lower and hoarser than usual because he'd just woken up. "You were the one who started to act all sleep drunk all of a sudden, and who started to cuddle up to me, you know. Not the other way around." He paused and yawned. The words didn't come out as easy and clean as they usually did. He did continue, however.
He was already imagining what it could be like. Back in the days, he'd be repulsed by the idea of house unity, but right now he absolutely loved it. It could really work, and it could be a lot of fun. Houses had always held parties but never mixed. Or at least, the Slytherins hadn't been involved in many mixed house parties. Which didn't mean they didn't party, oh no, Malfoy was sure most students didn't really know how chaotic Slytherin parties could get. It really was something to watch out for.
They walked on, Harry gulping and sucking in breaths. He felt just worse and worse with every step he took. He wasn't getting sick, was he? As they entered the library, the first thing he spotted in the dark spots was the familiar mop of blonde hair. 'Oh, that is just great…' Draco had found his book and was now walking to the administration desk to lend it, but noticed a very dizzy looking Potter walking in with his usual attachment. He wanted to comment on the boy's dazed look but didn't. First of all, because he simply couldn't bother at the moment, he didn't feel like conversing with anyone. Secondly, he felt like he didn't have the right to mock Potter's wellbeing. At least, not anymore. And thus he just kind of looked at him, wondering what he should do.
No one could judge them, there was no pressure.
"So, uhm, Harry listen. I was about to go to Hermione, so if you don't mind." Noticing the fidgety air around his friend he groaned, yet a playful smile appeared on his face. "Oh no, keep that for yourself. Go." Ron sputtered for a few seconds before he gave up and said his goodbyes - less enthusiastic to Malfoy as to Harry - before he left.
I wish to inform you that unfortunately, the manor won't be suitable for celebrating Christmas this year.
As soon as the words left his mouth, he knew he was wrong. Well, not entirely. It was true that he rarely spent time here because he was hurt, but that was mostly because he didn't bother to come here in the first place. He kept things like that to himself.
"After that, the potion should turn green," Malfoy began. "If it doesn't, add more mushroom. Easy as that. I hope you do know what comes after that?" He looked up to the other, searching for a sign that told him he didn't have to repeat his whole explanation again. After that explanation, the rest came back to him and his mouth shaped in a small 'o'. "Yes, yes. My bad," he grinned. He picked up his quill, dipped it in the ink, and continued writing.
"Shut up, Malfoy." Harry turned to find Draco's eyes. "How about you go to your daddy and cry 'cuz you failed to get people's respect?" He knew he was rambling, but without Ron or Hermione, he barely had any impulse control. "Well… I would… He hasn't got the time to reply every time though. Especially not when it's about some jerk called Potter." He replied.
The black haired girl looked up and sighed. The good thing about their friendship was that Pansy didn't dwell on fights. Not that she was forgiving, she just chose to not bother with bitterness and hate after they'd argued. No, she was smarter than that. She'd get back at it in a different way. Right now, however, she put her book away and nodded. "Yeah, I was wondering when you'd ask. You know I'm not going to put things like that on my feet," she pointed at Draco's skates, "ever, but I'll accompany you."
He was nearly yelling by now, trying to suppress his angry sobs. "Why don't they care, Harry? Why has my father never cared?"
"I'll leave if you want me to."
"Should've tried sleeping then."
Still trying to wake himself up to look at least a bit more respectable. But the bed was so warm and soft, and his head was still so fuzzy. He'd love to go straight back to sleep, but there was a confused Gryffindor trying to get his attention and he owed him some responses. Not that he had the answers to questions such as 'why did this happen?', but still. He had to explain himself somewhat before Potter got the wrong idea.
He had no objection for a second kiss, after all, he'd been the one to start the first one.
Not sure if the other would let him, he hastily tried to guide the other away from view. He had learned that he should have been more open with people as the years came by, but this was Malfoy. Harry wasn't sure how to act with him, but now the blonde was in a state like this he guessed he should just let him get it out for now. Letting go of Malfoy's wrist he grabbed the blanket. "I uh, am at a loss of words here so uhm," he spread his arms, inviting both the cold and Malfoy in. "You look like you need a hug or something though…"
Draco had wanted to point out that that, in fact, wasn't the blanket, but his robes, but kept his mouth shut. Maybe out of embarrassment, or maybe because he wanted to see what would happen if he just let Potter do his thing. He was very close now, basically cuddled up to him. No one ever came this close to him, and he never came this close to others either. He noticed how he could smell the other's soap, or deodorant, or whatever it was. With it came the smell of burnt wood, like he'd been near a fireplace recently. In a weird way, it was a very calming scent.
Draco slipped back into his usual cold posture and tidied his robes, which had been wrinkled due to his little dramatic display a few minutes ago. Maybe he shouldn't have done that after all. As he walked back towards the Slytherin dorms, it dawned on him that he'd spoken badly about his father. Not only that, but he'd also shown a very vulnerable side of himself. In front of Potter. Malfoy didn't agree with his father, but he did respect him. He was grateful for the protection he offered. Speaking ill about him in front of all those students…
Harry didn't know who to thank first. God? Dumbledore? His parents? Maybe Lucius? He was just glad that the other took up on his offer, it would have been quite some trouble to find something else the blonde would have deemed 'worthy' for this exchange.
"I practically barged in," he mumbled, eyes adverting to scan the room. "As far as permitting me in goes." He couldn't help but be on edge, and not just because he had entered without permission, it obviously had to do with the guy in question as well. Especially after his thoughts before he felt weird to face the other like this again. After all, he had been moving around the great hall in order to avoid the other and keep his mind busy.
Harry knew it would be useless to deny it, the other was watching him and had clearly seen him shift further into the bed. "Nightmares," he simply stated. As he allowed himself to shut his eyes while resting his head on the wall behind him, a frown etched on his features. He had slept well last time he was in the hospital wing, maybe it was the atmosphere of healing and nursery that had helped him, as he wouldn't want to say it was thanks to Malfoy.
He snorted at that. "Just the two of us? That's not fair, you'll know I'll beat your ass." As friendly as they were being now, Harry wondered how things would've gone if they had been friends rather than rivals, enemies as one might say.
Why was he so furious? Why was he actually acting it out, and letting it show so clearly? This was getting ridiculous.
He shifted his gaze to the other. There was still a sting of guilt whenever he laid eyes upon him, but as Pansy had rightfully said, that wasn't all there was to it. Something about those intriguing green eyes, that messy black hair, and body that screamed 'quidditch player', absolutely didn't repel the Slytherin. He'd said it before, Potter was always a mess, but not an unattractive one. It really fit his hero image.
Harry wasn't quite sure whether he was actually excited or nervous about this whole thing.
"In that case what, Potter?" The blond raised an eyebrow, daring the other to continue explaining himself. "Got deep dark secrets you're about to reveal?"
"Hey Mal?" He started somewhat unsure. "Do you think you and Ron could get along if I had a word with him? Or we could just go and talk to him together, I don't really know. I'm not sure what to say about it, but it would make things… Easier. One thing less on my mind you know?"
Harry's fist clenched tightly around the feather in his hand. That guy sure struck a nerve. Mission accomplished for mister Malfoy. Taking deep breaths, he looked up to the other. "It looks more as if you have a soft side to me, Malfoy," he asserted.
His grip tightened, his nails digging themselves into the other's back. He was being pathetic. He was ruining Potter's nice cuddles. He was spoiling everything, and thus undeserving of the other's sympathy and care.
"Don't worry, I can be a very good cuddle-buddy," he grinned. From the inside, he was about to scream, yet he managed to keep himself together quite well. He didn't show, now did he? He shrugged it off, as he didn't want to linger on these feelings. He should be content with the other like this.
Harry had been glad Malfoy felt comfortable enough to share this information with him. As he had lived the most part of his life in a closet he had never had many expectations pressed on him besides being quiet. It had surprised him when the Dursleys had given him his own room, yet besides that, things were the same.
Harry groaned once again when he was pulled up and breathed out deeply as the blanket lay on the floor. He stared at it as he answered the blonde. "Couldn't sleep with my mind occupied."
Now the other had stopped playing and was facing him, Harry immediately regretted his decision, he had intruded this place after all. Malfoy seemed to cherish this place, or else he wouldn't be here. His mouth moved without a sound. Honestly, what was he, a fish?
"Please, don't leave," he finally muttered, a panicky look on his face. "It's okay, but don't go…"
Harry let himself sink in a chair, almost falling right next to it as he was totally lost in the other's movements. Was it normal for musicians to be this mesmerizing or was this just because it was Malfoy?
He groaned and looked up to the ceiling. Luckily he hadn't come that far yet. He should head for the great hall to ask someone there.
Hermione had been looking at something behind Harry before she spoke, and the boy immediately knew what she was asking for. "Is Malfoy staying as well?" While she could have asked him directly, she was being rather careful with her words. He was going to evade the question anyway, though he felt like he should just come out and tell them. About the party and their plans about it, that is, leaving his love confession and the fact that. Malfoy and he had slept together out of the picture. That might be a story for another time.
"Can be anything, as long as it interests me," Draco replied. There wasn't a specific thing he wanted. Proposing a deal like this was ridiculous anyway, but he still wasn't backing away. Maybe he'd expected Potter to react a lot more offended, or angry.
Draco shook his head. "I'm not cold." He had suddenly felt a lot colder as soon as Potter had let go of him, but he wasn't freezing.
Even though it was the truth, cuz it would be a good thing if his two best friends could get along with his new buddy Malfoy, it would also mean they would probably be able to hang out more and he wasn't sure if that was good for his heart. As his eyes found Malfoy's staring at him, he felt his heart rate pick up. Yeah, that was definitely bad…
"Are you tired?" He merely asked, not allowing himself to dwell on it.
But wait, did he even have class? Pomfrey would've woken them up already if that were the case. Draco suddenly remembered that it was Christmas, the holidays had already started. They didn't have class, and he didn't have to hurry at all. He could just take his time, fetch some coffee from the great hall and return to the Slytherin dorms to maybe take a shower or something.
Against his will, he made sure to note that he had to wash the bundle of clothes before he grabbed something else to wear. He picked out a simple sweater from his closet and pulled the one he was wearing over his head. With a huff, he dropped it on the ground, next to his bed. He ruffled his hair with his hand, noticing the dust coming from it.
He was so used to commanding them around and looking at them like they were simply moving furniture that shouldn't be noticed.
Harry didn't know who to thank first. God? Dumbledore? His parents? Maybe Lucius? He was just glad that the other took up on his offer, it would have been quite some trouble to find something else the blonde would have deemed 'worthy' for this exchange.
As he looked through one of the windows into the lake, he started thinking about his future. His parents had left him at Hogwarts for now, but he couldn't stay there forever. This was his last year, after that he was supposed to find a job and earn his own living. Many Malfoys had lived or were living on the family's money: few of them actually worked. Draco wondered what would happen to the manor, their fortune, and to his parents. There was a chance they wouldn't return to England, so what would happen to their belongings? Would Draco inherit it, would he even want that?
Draco let go of the wall and stood up straight, which resulted in him actually looking down at the other because he was taller. "I, am not weak, Potter," he spoke. It almost seemed like a bit of his usual posture toward Harry had returned. His stern face softened a bit as he let a small grin spread across it. "But I am great, you got that right."
Malfoy shrugged and just started transforming the bed he sat on in an improvised desk. Then he moved it a bit closer to Harry's so that they could discuss stuff easier. "You're underestimating my abilities to teach others, Potter."
How does someone look so good in the morning?
It took somewhat longer as he had expected, yet he couldn't complain. As soon as they were done, he'd wanted to leave, yet the other halted him by calling out his name.
He bit his lip hard and could feel his flesh break under the pressure and he instantly regretted it as he quickly pressed his fingers to it. "Just come here, bastard."
"I'm not sure if Slytherins and Gryffindors have the same romantic tastes, I dare say they absolutely don't, but if it were me I'd say the courtyard near the lake, or somewhere near the lake and the forest…"
"Yeah, right," Blaise scoffed, mumbling something under his breath that sounded faintly like 'traitor' and 'weak'.
"Ah yes, you two were hosting it together, right?. It's good to hear you two are not bickering anymore." Well, that wasn't exactly what he had expected for her to say, but at least that was out in the open now.
He could not let that happen again. He did not want it to happen again, he feared it.
It hadn't just been a notice about the Christmas holidays, it had been a subtle farewell. Draco had been foolish to try to cover it up with pretty lies. This was his parents, or maybe just his father's way of telling him he wouldn't be seeing them for quite a while. Possibly for a very long time. They had cut themselves out of his life.
Something in him was scared this moment would be lost forever if they did, that he wouldn't be able to get it back.
He should maybe work on that.
His skin was easily stainable, sometimes too easily. He couldn't help but mumble the other's name, softly and impulsively.
He'd just admitted another flaw to the Gryffindor. He'd done it again. Man, he really felt the urge to punch something.
Draco flashed her an apologetic smile and sat down in one of the unoccupied chairs. How should he explain what had happened? He doubted they would approve of him hanging around Potter, so telling them what really happened would cause quite some uproar. There was, however, one good thing about his friends being Slytherins: they respected each other's privacy and didn't press a subject when someone was clearly not comfortable talking about it. It was a form of respect.
I'm not J.K Rowling and thus I don't own Harry Potter nor do I get paid for any of this.
A lot of alarm bells started ringing, deafening him as he carefully accepted the other's invitation. It didn't matter how awkward or unusual this was, because it felt warm and a lot better than just standing there while trying to make sense of things.
Draco knew who owned this owl. Its shiny, dark brown feathers were a Malfoy family trademark. The owl landed on his shoulder, after which Draco was able to take the letter. His suspicions had been right: the dark, pine green seal wore the Malfoy emblem. He carefully opened the letter and read through its content.
"Uhm," he scratched his neck as his eyes failed to meet the blonde's grey ones that were fixed on him. "That is… complicated."
Draco neatly sat down beside him, keeping his distance, but being close enough to look at the book and explain it. Yes, he was actually doing this. What a disgrace…. "Right, first of all, the information you've already have. You can completely discard that." He took a new roll of parchment and spread it out on the desk. He then continued to explain what was wrong, and what it should be. He could've done that with kind words, but he decided to put it as it was: harsh and clear.
"I see," Draco nodded softly. "Should I keep you company or do you wish for me to leave?" He asked, looking up at the other.
"How, how in the world can you be so… So careless? Excuse me for putting it like this, but do you even know what you're doing? This isn't healthy, you've been hospitalized for it already, do you honestly want to go back just after being released for half an hour?" Yes, he was furious, but mostly because he couldn't bear to see Potter neglecting himself like this. He didn't know why he just did.
Every Malfoy was a sinner when it came to vanity, and Draco was no exception. It was a part of him, just like his blond hair was a part of him. Many people would see it as a bad trait, but Draco had always worn it like a crown. Of course, there were parts of himself that he couldn't stand at all. Rotten parts that even he couldn't get himself to be proud of. But he would never accept others to call him weak or pathetic. He couldn't see himself standing below others. It was both a blessing and a curse.
That turned around quite quickly. But did he want the other to do his homework for him? Surely, Snape would put him in detention or give him a load of extra work to do if he messed this assignment up. Yet, what could he even offer the Slytherin? He would have to do it on his own. Or, well…
That should do. He managed to fold the paper up before handing it to the blonde. Unfortunately, it rather flew out of his hands in the air. So much for motor coordination. Luckily the Slytherin had quick reflexes. He caught the paper before it hit the ground and pocketed it. Then he put his book and the quill back. He wondered if he could actually call that thing a quill though, it didn't remotely look like a feather.
There was obviously more to it, but Potter probably had his reasons for not telling Malfoy. He didn't press it and merely nodded back. He himself had had trouble functioning normally again too, the first few months after the war. Even now the things he'd done haunted him whenever his mind started to wander off.
They continued their way to the common room, still chatting softly. Draco wondered what Potter was doing, and why he'd walked off like that. He somehow felt like it was his fault, but he couldn't remember doing anything wrong. He'd just have to ask him later, it was no use worrying about it now.
Like any of his thoughts appearing just like that, he sniggered at the new memory in his mind.
"I said what?" Harry said. He blinked and shook his head. "Why?"
Slipping in his shoes he went back, through the common room where a few students were seated, back towards the great hall. He wasn't sure if Luna would be there, but he decided that he could best look there first.
The grin was still lingering on his face, possibly showing a bit of his excitement. He didn't really notice this though since he was slightly lost in his thoughts.
"Let's enjoy ourselves for a bit then." She took a few careful steps. "Oh, and if I slip, it's your fault."
It was a marvelous location, he was sure they wouldn't be interrupted anytime soon. They could stay there for ages.
"All I'm saying," Draco continued, "is that I've come to terms with the war and with myself. I've been a bully, a prick, and at least I can admit that now. If you're not able to do that, if you're unable to move on from the past, I can assure you, you won't have a very pretty future lying ahead of you. The dark lord's gone, we've lost. It's time to admit that we were wrong."
Draco nodded and turned around to get back to his dormitories. For the first time that day, he reached them without being stopped. He told the door the password and walked in. The common room was fairly crowded but not as busy as it could have been. There were students playing games, chatting or studying. This didn't surprise him, seeing as it was freezing outside, which meant it was freezing in the castle as well. It was nicer to sit in the common room, where there was a fireplace, instead of the icy great halls or library.
Malfoy widened his eyes in a fake-offended scowl. "You will not, you prat," he scoffed. "You must have never properly watched me fly because if you had, you'd know I could easily beat you. Can't blame you with those glasses though."
"So, tell me, how did it end up like this?" He asked.
"Perhaps we could ask some of the herbology students who like to bake to make some Mandrake cupcakes?" Harry started out in the open. "Or just a cake with the house colors. As for drinks, we could use food coloring for drinks, just to keep it somewhat closer to home for muggle-borns as the basic spells."
"We're not placing those at the party," he huffed. Fortunately he had only been caught twice under them, once when he and Hermione waited for Ron to hurry up and once when he had been wandering around and found Luna. Both incidents had been a kiss on the cheek. Harry wondered if there were people who would wait all day under one to get a kiss or some believed in the extreme version of it.
While he felt somewhat fuzzy, something inside him made him alert. His eyes were wide open and scanning the other's face, noting how the other seemed tired even after sleeping along with him. Maybe it was because he had been resting on top of him, it had probably made it impossible to turn in his sleep.
As usual, the Boy Who Lived felt that tension of being frustrated and powerless, the embarrassed not adding on to any good. He just wanted to fall into a hole or sit in a corner so no one would bother him. Which had been Draco's goal, even Harry knew that. He tried to regain his senses and push his feelings away. He stood up with a deep sigh. "Can someone get a broom? I dropped some trash."
It still didn't feel right to the Slytherin, Potter had a whole family to return to. And as stiff and proper as his own family time during Christmas was, Draco did enjoy spending time with his family. The past few years it had been grim and hardly celebrated due to the war and the things leading up to it. This had never kept Draco from loving Christmas. He had always enjoyed the fancy dinners and family reunions. It had been the only time when the Malfoy manor seemed to warm up a bit. When his father could be seen joking, and when his mother really seemed to enjoy herself. He simply didn't want Potter to miss out on his own family time just because Draco had to.
As soon as said Slytherin was done eating, he got up and gathered his stuff. "I'm leaving early, need a book for astrology," he informed Pansy. She merely nodded as she continued eating. Draco turned around and strode out of the great hall, making his way to the library. However, halfway there he got stopped by an owl that came soaring at him. Now owls weren't allowed in the hallways and it wasn't usual for them to try to reach their owners during school hours. This meant that whatever message this owl was carrying, it had to be important.
Really, why was he even going out of his way to help this guy? He'd already taken more care of him than he'd ever done for anyone else. And it didn't even bother him, it actually felt kind of good to see the other smiling again instead of nearly fainting. Maybe it was because he still felt guilty about the things he'd done. Maybe he did this as an apology, or maybe it was merely a selfish act to get rid of his guilt. Or maybe it was because he understood what the other was going through. Because he knew how terrible the mere thought of Voldemort could be, and what it could do to people.
He didn't want to be the only one being overwhelmed by it.
"Of course sir."
"Sorry for intruding on your uh... On you again."
"It happened before I could think about it, but I'm not that shallow. I'm not trying to play around with you."
This thought, in combination with his current lack of self-control, caused him to do something very stupid. For a moment, he forgot to restrain his cravings. He brought his hands up to grasp the other's head, closed the little distance there was still left between them and finally did what he had unconsciously been wanting to do for a while.
"Yes, I'm fine. Just escaping the crowd," he explained to calm her down. Pomfrey seemed less on edge now she knew she didn't have to worry about yet another student, one who visited quite frequently lately to top.
"Of course."
"I see you found Loony," one of them said as they came to a group of four. Harry nodded and decided to immediately mention the party, which he got surprised reactions too. He noticed that a duo from Hufflepuff were listening to their conversation as well.
He continued to brush his hand through the blond locks, holding back from the temptation to kiss the boy's forehead.
As soon as he'd started talking, he couldn't stop. It spilled out of him like a long-kept secret. He noticed how his hands started to shake slightly, but couldn't control it.
"No, no, wait." He reached for the other and kissed him, just a peck lasting only for a few seconds.
Beating around the bush had done so much good now, had it? Harry didn't like to be confronted with his feelings. With a huff, he let go of the other, as far as he could even get his other arm to wiggle away.
Draco hummed softly. That was no new information to him.
Malfoy quickly interrupted her before she could continue talking. "Don't you dare, Parkinson."
Harry was glad they asked. At least he now knew what he would be doing after his visit to Snape.
A groan was about to leave Harry´s lips.
A huff and a small smile was the only thing that came from him as he made his way to the ice. No way was he going to let the other live with that. He took a bundle of snow before he set foot on the frozen lake, grinning back.
Malfoy smiled softly and made a sniffy, laugh-ish sound. "I am too," he replied. They still had two weeks of the Christmas holidays left, which meant they had all the time of the world to cuddle and be casual with each other, without lessons or other students interfering. There was no pressure, they could take this easy. Draco needed it to go slow and easy.
How long had he been in that position?
Draco didn't understand why she thought this was so funny but decided to ask her about it later. "Thank you," he merely said, giving her a small nod.
"I know this probably doesn't excuse my actions completely, but back then… During and before the war… " He hesitated for a moment, unsure if he should proceed or not. "You have to understand that I didn't know what to do anymore. I was Lucius Malfoy's son, raised to be just like him. A sophisticated pureblood with bigoted standards and terrible morals. I acted terribly during my first years at Hogwarts because that was how I'd been raised, but also what others expected me to be like. And when he came back… When all the death eaters were summoned… My father had never left the dark lord's side. I didn't have a choice. I was involved with the death eaters just as much as he was, it didn't matter if I wanted it or not because I was Lucius' son and had no other choice but to follow in his footsteps. When I had to choose between Hogwarts or Voldemort, during the battle of Hogwarts, I had to choose for Voldemort. I couldn't leave my parent's side, they were the only close family I had, I couldn't leave them. I was also convinced that Voldemort would win, I couldn't risk it."
"I'm willing to because last time had a positive effect on my sleep as well," the Slytherin explained. "I'm purely doing this for my own wellbeing." Well, that wasn't completely true, but it felt better than saying 'I want you to be well-rested and if I can help I will'. He understood that all of this confused the Gryffindor. Draco himself wasn't coping with it that well either. But maybe it wasn't bad, maybe they just had to get used to it.
He didn't speak, not yet, he wasn't sure if his voice would betray him or not. Regaining a slow steady breathe he tried to calm himself down, or his heart rate at least. This was fucked up, why did his body react like that? Ron and Hermione had offered him their help and support throughout the year as well. Why did he only feel like this now when Malfoy said it? Something in the far back of his mind tried to speak up, yet he pressed it back to where it came from. Not now.
Nothing abnormal, but absolutely very pleasing to look at.
Was it really that bad for Malfoy and him to be friends now?
"I think I'd like some goblin wine with that if you have it. A bottle should do," he added to his previous order when the elf returned.
Thinking of it, Malfoy actually craved some time for himself. "You know, I think I'll head back to the Slytherin dormitories then. I probably have homework too." He shrugged. "I guess I'll see you later then…" He looked at the other as they left the kitchens and returned to the hallway.
"Unfortunately for you, I do know how to take care of myself though. I mean have you ever seen me in this room because I was the one who was hurt? And don't start talking about that bloody hippogriff, I'm talking about the current time."
Well, it wasn't that bad too start the day off with…
With a curt nod, Harry looked to the side. Where would Ron be around this time? Surely, the two of them normally hung out with Hermione, but there were times Ron and Hermione left on their own devices to get some 'alone time' together.
Harry finds Draco in the Room of Requirement playing a violin. They end up talking about things like what Christmas at the Weasleys was like and such
Draco gasped. "Savage, Potter."
Draco had gotten violin lessons since he was about 8. He'd always loved it when his parents hired musicians for their parties or dinners, so after a lot of pleading his mother had allowed him to pick an instrument to learn to play. She'd always thought it was very charming and had often watched him play. She, his father and Pansy were the only people who knew about it. It was one of the things Draco held close to himself, a good childhood memory that he shared with his mother. It was a fragile thing to him, and he was terrified that it would shatter if he wasn't careful enough.
Malfoy scoffed softly. He'd actually really worried the guy, to the point where it got pretty serious. That kind of intrigued him, Potter, caring about him.
As she read it, her eyebrows arched even further. It took her a while before she could speak. Ron, curious now as well, snatched the paper from her hands. He stifled a laugh that sounded more like a scoff, as he didn't believe his eyes. "Harry calling you Mal?" he quoted, looking at the blonde. Hermione narrowed her eyes. "I don't think Harry would ever write something like this, even though this is his handwriting," she stated. Ron nodded in agreement behind her, not bothering to back her up as she raised her head a bit. "So, what did you do to Harry. Speak."
Harry folded the blanket back around himself, face nuzzling in the blanket for a bit before he decided to form words. "I'm glad you seem to think so as well," he grinned shortly. "I had already forgiven you for most of your actions, I mean I don't think I would have helped you if I had been still mad about it…"
He stopped writing as he realized how he had called up only food and drinks related stuff and scratched his chin. Maybe they could get their own floating candles in the room of requirement as decoration as well. They would need to see what the room had in store for them. "Not sure about the decorations as I have no idea what the room of requirement is gonna give us. Should have to check if there's a tree included," he mumbled as he wrote down the last few things down on the parchment.
Basically, Harry and Draco make out
"Don't think about the homework, stressing about it will only make you feel bad. I'll figure something out," he promised.
Harry wasn't sure if that ceased his worries about it, but he decided to shake it off for now. "We should decide what kind of party it's going to become then if that's the case," he stated. "Whether it's gonna be more like a gathering or a big party."
Draco didn't really want to leave.
It had taken Draco a while to get used to playing the instrument again, but after a little practice, he felt himself loosen up pretty quickly. Yes, he was very rusty, but still not bad. He just started playing a few songs he had played so often that they were permanently stuck in his head. He didn't need sheet music for that.
Even the densest person could look at him and guess what had just happened.
At first, all Harry did was stare at her before his eyes slid towards the other. Was he supposed to answer her now to explain their newly established friendship or would he have to simply cover it up for now? Gosh if only he could read people's minds. Without confirmation he went back to eye the girl who waited for an answer, her hands almost going to her hips as if she would actually go and scold him.
A hum was not what Malfoy probably wanted as an answer, but it left Harry's lips almost too soon. He tilted his head to the side in thought before he eyed the other again. "Well, yeah. Ron can be a little stubborn sometimes… But I guess that made us such good friends. I understand him, I mean the war has been hard on most people. Yet I just… I can't leave it like this."
"I'm sorry for reacting that dramatic and brushing you off, that was wrong of me."
Needed to be far away from the handsome Slytherin.
Somewhat against his will, he made his way to the place he knew the man would be, the dungeons. He honestly wished he didn't have to go, but after last time he didn't dare to wait with handing in his work. On his way, he stopped. He hadn't finished the thing yet.
"So. I see you fell asleep as well. Had a good rest?"
"Why are you saying no so quickly? You play wonderfully, it's a shame no one is ever allowed to listen to it."
Harry honestly just wanted to press kisses all over the other and just keep on chanting how much he loved the other.
He had never really had the chance to think about it all that much with some evil dude on his heels. Yet he thought he would like to be an Auror. With a hum, he continued. "I know that's gonna make me have to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth… perseverance and dedication." Now he thought about that, he suddenly started to wonder if he was fit for that kind of job. Yes, he wanted to do this. But he honestly to Merlin had no idea if he was gonna make it. He started to doubt himself at times like this, at night. Maybe he shouldn't think of that right now.
"You're the most comforting thing I've encountered in a very long time. The first time we hugged, I instantly realized that I needed more of that warmth. I'm just too much of a prat to admit such things. Too much of a coward to admit that I love being near you, not only just for the comfort."
He just got worried when the other seemed distressed, it was an emotion he didn't even think twice about anymore.
Harry wasn't sure what to make from the things the other told him, and hence ignored it, yet he knew that the other loved to play. Or maybe that was too strong a word to express it, he wasn't that sure.
He shifted his gaze away from the window and leaned his head back against his chair, staring up at the ceiling. He was so used to living in great wealth, that he wasn't sure how to act without it. He was used to the finest clothes, expensive stuff, servants and big manors. Would he be able to turn his back to all of those things, if that was what it took to be self-dependent? He really liked the idea of finding himself a nice job and staying in London, but would he manage to do that?
It was still very difficult for him to think more highly of them, as it was for many other wizards.
As expected both Ron and Hermione weren't present in the Gryffindor's common room, yet that was not why he left soon after. It was because he remembered his stuff was still in the hospital wing. The halls were still crowded and it took him longer as he expected to get to the room. Madame Pomfrey was still absent, which he would consider strange if there had been any other students at the moment, either sleeping over or in need of patches or whatever. The nurse might have a busy day tomorrow, he pondered as he returned to the lion cave. Harry was quite sure that Malfoy wouldn't be the only one that would want to try to skate on the lake.
Had his actions affected the other that much? Oh, this was a thing to mess with, there was no avoiding it now.
Flushing as all the attention was drawn to them at once, Harry picked the other from the ground. Well, he tried - keyword 'tried'. "Stop it. You're embarrassing," he hissed. "Fuck if I care, unlike you I know how to talk myself out of stuff. So, I guess you're the only one being affected by this," he smirked.
Harry watched the other stretch and let his eyes fall over the blonde's body, mesmerized for a moment until he snapped out of it as the other started to pace. Maybe he should decide to eat his food or bring the plate back. It would keep his thoughts in place, at least he hoped it would. Taking a piece of the bread he started munching on it, yet it didn't taste well. It might be him or because it had laid there for a while, but he decided to put the plate away. He stood up as well and grabbed his glass as well, drinking the last bit before he placed it on the plate. He should bring it back now.
Yet he held himself back from that temptation.
Harry woke up abruptly and panic scourged through him at the bundles of sunlight in the room. What was the time? Was he late for- The realization of Christmas hit him and he let himself fall back on the bed with a huff, that was until he landed on something that was most definitely not part of the bed. His breath was stuck in his throat as he turned to find the blond lay there. He had almost forgotten, but now he thought back on it he remembered clearly how they had wrapped themselves up under the blankets and in one another's hold. It reminded him of his stupid feelings as well, as to why he rolled to the side of the bed before he sat up and placed his head in his hands. What was even going on here?
Malfoy sighed and started to help him up, not even asking if he should help, but just doing it. "You damn stubborn Gryffindor," he mumbled as he sat him down on the bed. He'd been talking about leaving, but that wasn't going to happen anytime soon. "You haven't even rested properly, have you?" He asked.
He had thought it had been stupid to ask the other if he needed a hug, and the silence had convinced him the other thought so as well. Well, he had never been the one that came up with good plans, that was Hermione. When the other did step in he was nicely surprised and he felt amused at himself of how quickly his arms had wrapped back.
Harry bet that if this continued, his sweater wouldn't be looking the same as before, not with the way these hands grabbed on him.
Something inside him pulled hard on his heartstrings as he watched the other. He had almost forgotten about that. Malfoy had told him before, that he was staying at Hogwarts because his parents had left. He should have known that would be weighing the other down. Now his other hand was cupping the other half of the blond boy's face.
Draco backed away again too soon, to turn towards the house-elf who'd arrived with the bottle.
Lucius Malfoy."
He knew very well that was not enough, yet with these feelings darting all around him he just had not felt the need to eat at that moment anymore.
Harry had forgotten about that. With a hum he let his eyes wander.
He felt terrible for upsetting the other like this. His own fear and confusion were affecting Harry and that was not what he wanted.
Merlin, he'd never needed Potter as much as he did now.
Of course, this question surprised Draco, but he was too calm to make a big deal out of it. It was actually an interesting question, no one really asked him this. Yes, it was a bit weird to ask in this situation, but honestly, he was too lazy to care.
"Anyway, it's your fault," he concluded.
He'd clearly missed out on a lot the previous years, what a regrettable waste.
Malfoy nodded while rubbing his eyes. "That's great, really great," he murmured, suppressing a yawn. So it had at least been good for something. That was a good thing. He himself couldn't complain either, he'd slept well too. Eventually, he just couldn't bear his drowsiness anymore.
"Of course. If you wish for me to do," he whispered.
"Now we can go."
"You wish, but unfortunately for you, I'm not." the blonde replied, still not getting up, and actually looking pretty comfortable.
He glanced back at the lake once more, still regretting his actions. "I do think I'll try to skate on it, if it keeps freezing. Would love to do that.."
Harry had expected the other to take his challenge, but the way the guy was almost jumping up and down in excitement had caught him by surprise. There was this glint in the grey eyes he didn't often see. It made him feel somewhat proud to make the other boy act like this.
The other Slytherin let out a disapproving laugh. "Why would you do that? I know you, Malfoy. You wouldn't do that unless there's something in it for you."
"I assume I can't press it any further, but surely you know it won't get better if you don't change things. I'm not allowing you to go on like this, I simply am not." He spoke sternly while taking a few steps towards the black-haired boy. "So let me give you a reason to care. First of all, your friends. I'm sure they've been worried for a while, you don't want them to see you back in the hospital again right? So do it for them. Secondly, as I said, I'm not allowing you to fuck yourself over. Try to do it for me, if not for your friends. It would certainly put my mind at ease, and I don't know if you care about that at all, but please keep it in mind."
Glancing back to the other, he couldn't help but frown.
Draco agreed with Potter, having missed the Gryffindor's staring, the scenery was beautiful.
Craving for more touch, he started to move his lips, lightly pulling on the blond lock intertwined between his fingers.
"Back to the room of requirement then?" He asked the other.
He eventually found one, which answered his question. It was 9 am.
"Prick…" Harry muttered under his breath.
Meanwhile, the Gryffindor's kisses had turned less fluttery and more sucky in a way Draco was sure would leave a few marks.
Upon arriving at the library Harry found himself walking towards the shelf with potion books instead of searching for the other Gryffindor, he stared at the books with a frown. Why was he standing here? Harry was about to leave and continue through the library to find the other when it suddenly all fell in place. The assignment.
Neville jumped in to add it was a good idea, and yes it might be crowded, but they should go now before it was way too busy. It took some time before they all stood up to head out. It turned out in none of them having brought skates and only sliding on the ice, sometimes slipping and falling on their butts. Soon enough someone had thrown a snowball at Ron, Harry honestly had no idea if it came from one of them or had been a lost cause in other people's snowball fight, yet it caused one between them. Obviously, Ron and Hermione had teamed up with him, while Neville and Luna had dragged Seamus in the fight.
Oh yeah. Great. That's not weird to ask, especially in this situation. Not at all.
As the day went on, Potter popped up in his mind several times. Draco tried to push it away and succeeded most of the time, but it kept coming back. He tried to pay attention to his classes since that'd spare him some revising later, but it just wouldn't work that day. In the end, he just got so annoyed that he almost blamed it on Gryffindor. It wasn't fair, he knew that, but in a way, it was his fault right?
"Everyone has some Potter, mine just have been hidden well enough. Don't think yours have though, mister 'Christmas miracle'." He sneered back, grinning a bit. Were they really going back to their old bickering just like that? Merlin, they really were a hopeless case, weren't they?
Call it Fanservice
He'd lost them when it turned out that his whole life consisted out of wrong choices when all he'd done turned out to be worthless. And now all that was left was the sobbing mess that was clutching onto Potter as if he were the last thing on earth that could keep him from drowning in his own messed up mind. No wonder his pride had left him.
"I would like just a glass of water and some bread, please," Harry spoke first and Draco looked back down at the elf.
'Someone. If you hear this, please send help.' Harry wanted to slam his head against the table and-THUD. Oh no, he just couldn't control himself now, did he? He groaned, feeling his forehead tingle. That hurt. "I didn't mean it in such a way necessarily," he mumbled while rubbing his head. "Take a joke, Mal." He shifted in his seat and- oh shit... He did not.
With a slight glance to the side, the black-haired boy hummed.
If it hadn't been for his peak of confidence, he would've stood in the entrance forever. He walked up to the group of students with a faint smile, hoping they would let him explain himself before they judged him.
He decided to end his little improvised speech there, where it would have the most impact. Blaise didn't seem as angry as before anymore, but absolutely not convinced yet either. Crabbe and Goyle did seem at least a bit convinced, this didn't surprise Draco, they'd always followed his lead and would probably accept most things he said anyway. And Pansy, well, she already knew about most of this. She seemed to be in thoughts, but not in a negative way. She'd clearly accepted Draco's words, even though she didn't show it that much.
This chapter has a lot more dividing in it for some reason, don't mind that xd
"You're saying I have to forget about Fred?" he hissed.
"Well, I was drenched so it was no surprise for me, yet Pomfrey got all mad," he mumbled. "But well, yes. Aside from the cold, there is nothing wrong with me." When he yawned he huffed. Okay so he was wrong about that, his body had caught up to the lack of sleep now his energy from the snowball fight was gone.
A shiver ran down Harry's spine while he leaned in the touch.
Biting on his bottom lip, he desperately searched for an answer. Maybe he could act as if it was weird for the other to think like that by looking at the other weirdly. Ugh, why did he need to search for excuses anyway… Maybe he should just be honest after all. Put it down like the fact it was. Harry felt how his whole body seemed to protest against his decision, body tensing up and his heart almost seemed to clench. Beat around the bush.
He made his way to a seat next to some Slytherins he knew and started a conversation. None of his close friends were present, but he actually didn't mind that at all. He always felt a bit more relaxed when they weren't around. When no one would notice if he let his guard down for a bit.
Harry thought about that for a moment. It seemed cold outside, but he bet that if Hermione really wanted to go outside to have some time with Ron that the two could be there. The red-haired boy was quite easy to be influenced by his girlfriend.
Entering the hall they reached the Gryffindor table and sat down. For some reason, he felt quite conscious about his hair all of a sudden, as if someone had spoken ill about. Not that he could blame them, he just never got into the whole 'let's try different things to do with my hair'-period. Being locked up in a closet and all did not really do much a favor to his hair and skin after all.
Harry smiled. "You know, that's actually not that bad an idea. We could make letters to invite them as well, to make it seem somewhat more special. It's Christmas after all. Oh, we could have our own decorations and firework show as well!" He felt himself get excited by the idea and had to straighten himself in order for his food not to drop from his plate.
Draco felt shaky, sad, and was a complete mess, but in an intense need of appreciation and care. Potter was the embodiment of these things. Potter was what he needed.
Harry cleared his throat when he realized his previous intimate action, somewhat unsure of why the other hadn't said anything about it yet. Didn't it bother him?
"Thank you for listening," he smiled.
Harry wore a confused expression as well until he spotted the girl coming in view. Naturally. He gave a curt nod. "Keyword; try."
Harry had heard the cracking thou and had stiffened, allowing the snowball Malfoy had sent his way to him in the face. A soft curse left his mouth as he tried to get the ice away as it melted and dripped down his neck.
"We want to use the room of requirement and all houses are invited. We could really use the help to decorate and set the whole thing up, you know?" While the Ravenclaws reacted positively to his message, he saw the Hufflepuffs split up, one towards him and the other out of the great hall. Turned out that they were up to it and the other was fetching some friends. Harry was glad that the Ravenclaw he had talked to before carried some parchment around and flipped out the so-called 'enhanced quill' - he just wanted to call it a pen, but decided against it. If this went on like this, then he wondered if there would even be people against the whole idea.
"You might want to try a pepper-up potion…" Draco suggested softly, casually moving a bit closer to the Gryffindor. Holding his head, he watched the other move closer. "Hm, yeah. I'll ask Hermione if she has time, else I got to-," his speech was interrupted as a stabbing pain shot through his head for a moment which made him hiss. "Else I got to wait a little longer. Thanks for your concern though Mal, I appreciate it."
"Damn blanket, it's cold," he muttered in the sheets.
"Yeah, sure."
"No need to get defensive now," Harry grinned, cocking his head to the side. "That incident with the hippogriff though, may I dare say, was your own fault. If you had only listened, something you actually did on the lake, it might have been prevented. But no, the great Draco Malfoy had it all handled."
And thus he sat up and then bowed down to grab some stuff from his bag. "I have a better idea," he began, "what if we make the homework together? Right here. Shouldn't take too long, and I think it could be quite efficient if we do it right."
Maybe Draco's behavior and shame hurt him.
Disclaimer:
The conversation had silenced at his arrival, but no one had spoken up yet. Draco looked at Harry, hoping he'd be able to ease the situation a bit.
Now that there was nothing to focus on, just the silence and peace this room brought, he couldn't help but lightly rock back and forth. That guy really was something. Attractive, talented, and not that bad in helping others as he had supposed the Slytherin was either, yet also something he could not touch.
His arms lowered to wrap around the other's waist, resting his head on top of the messy mop of hair his hands had made of the before decent-looking blond coupe.
"If I made the great Malfoy show such weakness towards me and let me sleep oh so graciously on his lap, I guess I'm not allowed to actually tell you off." As he stared the other in his eyes, he felt the corners of his mouth rise as of why he bit on his lip in hopes to prevent it.
They just slept together, was that not worth mentioning? Did Malfoy not worry about this?
Harry never wanted to be their hero, he just wanted to have friends and find love like anyone else did.
In all honesty, he felt stupid. Not just for telling him or telling him to forget it afterward, but just for having these feelings at all. It only caused problems he didn't want. Maybe it was for the best to let the topic rest for now. Malfoy didn't have an answer ready yet. Besides, he didn't want to ruin this nice cuddle moment. However, he did want the other to know that it was okay, that Malfoy didn't judge him or wanted to end their friendship. Because he absolutely didn't.
And a smile. Merlin wanted him dead now, didn't he? Harry had been glad he could breathe again, but with this action, he almost choked on it again. That guy really didn't know half of what he was doing to him, did he? Still, he couldn't really blame the other as he had asked the blond to play for him, not the other way around.
"Not?" he teased. "That's just disappointing." Malfoy dropping his stuff was for Harry a sign that the other wasn't leaving him for quite a while, and for him, that was a good sign.
But then Draco heard those two words: 'not yet'. And as opposed to Crabbe and Goyle, Malfoy possessed a pair of brains. It didn't take him long to figure out what was really going on. Potter had just revealed something that Draco didn't dare to believe, something he would refuse to believe unless the Gryffindor would actually say it out loud. As much evidence as there was, it was still just guesswork and even though it was highly likely that Draco was right, he couldn't call it the truth just yet. It was an outrageous idea and absolutely not allowed. He knew it shouldn't happen, and thus made himself believe it couldn't happen. That was the only way.
"Yes, I suppose so. I think you could do with some sleep, and I'm not needed for that." He stretched as he got up from his slightly crouching position. "I'll try to notify your friends, but I doubt they'll believe me... "
Kissing Draco fucking Malfoy, that was a thought Harry had pressed back far away in a corner - but here he was.
Though he knew that it was going to be somewhat larger for his expectations due that students from all houses were to join. He hadn't thought about how many people it would be, but if all four houses would gather it would probably still be a rather large group. Tilting his head to the side to look up he pondered about what food they should have at the party. Did they need to keep it simple or did they put down all kinds of plates? Was he overthinking stuff right now?
"So what now? You're gonna buy me a huge stuffed animal for that job?" Now he thought about it, he had never been that kid who slept with stuffed animals. Not because he didn't want or need them, but because his aunt and uncle wouldn't buy him one. And he obviously couldn't afford it himself back then.
"Hmm, well you do have a nice smile," Harry mumbled. When he realized he had actually said that out loud he cleared his throat, sinking his nails in the palm of his hands in hope the heat would not rise to his cheeks. He should not have said that out loud.
He decided to not think into it too much, and move onto the next thing the other had said. He'd complimented him, not mocked him. And somehow, this made Draco flush a light shade of red. Being complimented on something so personal was a big deal to him, it seemed. Through all of this, he did, however, notice the Gryffindor's uncomfortable posture. He probably knew he'd intruded and was feeling bad for it now.
Draco could practically feel the other's eyes on his back, but ignored it and continued as if he were alone. He eventually got really into it and couldn't prevent a smile from playing around his lips as he focused on the music sheets.
"Well," Harry started. "I guess I should head back to the hospital wing. My books are there and I still have an assignment to write, if I don't wish for Snape to curse me that is."
Potter was an exception.
Well, maybe that was because he had never played any musical instrument himself that he had never bothered about it. If he were to have played the piano or violin or something himself, the chances of him paying any interest in it would be severely higher than it was right now.
Draco would have preferred to tell them the truth, but he was a magnificent actor and the lies left his mouth within seconds. "I've been studying and lost track of time," he told them.
Because it was nice to feel the comfort of someone being close to him, no matter how often he told himself he didn't need it. Why did Potter just have to get so sleep-drunk and put Malfoy in a situation like this?
"Maybe my parents should've made an effort to show me that then," he whispered, looking at the other through watery eyes.
"Yeah," the blonde nodded, still kind of trying to wake up properly.
This did him no good. With a little jump, he got back on his feet again, looking anywhere but at the blond on the sofa.
Harry inhaled just then and he almost choked on the air. Okay, that turned around quickly. He hummed to get the attention of the two. "There's no need for that, Ron." Ron didn't seem content with that reply from his best friend but kept silent about it.
Man, this was sad. Tracing his teeth with his tongue before scratching his head, Harry contemplated what to do or say. Should he ask him to come along with them to Hogsmeade? He was Draco Malfoy after all… Plus Hermione wouldn't let him see another day if he did.
Before he could answer Madame Pomfrey walked up to the blonde. "He can't sleep anyway so I would rather have you keep him some company to keep the kid sane."
As his gaze fell on Luna, he was reminded of the party he had discussed with a specific Slytherin. "Hey Luna, you were gonna stay at Hogwarts over break, right?"
Was this hug lasting too long? Do you just loosely hang your arms around the person in situations like these or do you actually pull them in tight? Ron's mom gave him a lot of hugs in different kind of situations and so did Hermione, Ron at times as well, but for some reason, he felt like he still hadn't gotten the hang of it…
They made their way through the halls towards the great hall. It was then that Harry was reminded of that he would see Draco there. Ron and Hermione didn't know about his little homework sessions with Draco. He wondered how long it would take for the two of them to fight each other as usual. With how Draco had treated Ron and Hermione, he wasn't sure if they would ever like him even a bit.
"W-well, let's continue then."
He frowned, honestly a bit irritated that the boy had still forgotten to take care of himself.
Harry almost immediately shook his head. "You and laugh? As if."
His voice was weird, suddenly higher in sound, cracking almost. Weird like his actions.
This feeling of loneliness could have led him to Potter, in some way. Because they both struggled with the war, and they both didn't quite fit in anymore.
"Well, uhm, I just sleep unwell thanks to the nightmares I have," Harry stated, "And I fail to get my daily dose of liquid as you know. I don't know, I guess I just forget to drink enough?" He knew that he didn't tell all of it, but he just didn't know how to bring it. He knew that most people would call him crazy if he would have asked if there was a possibility that You-Know-Who would return.
He'd done it again, he'd called Malfoy 'Mal' again. Now that Draco thought of it, it was a miracle he'd never commented on it. Not really at least. He didn't comment this time either since he doubted Potter would care. The boy was nearly fainting. "You should go to Madam Pomfrey, I don't think anyone would want to wipe you off the floor. Go now before you faint." Why did he care, why was he concerned? He couldn't be concerned, he shouldn't care less about what state Potter was in. Then why did he dislike seeing the guy this miserable?
If he could, he would have never left this room and stayed here with the other.
"You know how I feel about you, so why would you even do that? Just..."
"Oh, uhm, actually…" He scratched his head awkwardly, looking to the side. Why did this fluster him so much? Because no one's ever said a thing like that.
"I…" His hand reached to his head. Why was his head spinning now? Did he jump up too quick?
Harry should have expected this, should have been prepared for anything of this sort, but he wasn't. The other had spoken softly, yet he had heard it clearly. Unable to form words he decided to just act and made his way over to the other, almost crawling towards the other as he didn't trust his legs. "You sure?" He asked, watching the other as he bit his lip.
"So, uhm. We're… Okay again, right?"
It would have been better if the other didn't just only lay there all stiff but actually gave in to the coziness as well. Maybe that was why he reached for the Slytherin's arm to pull it over him. It felt weird how he had been scooting away from the guy and feeling all nervous and fidgety just mere minutes ago while he was now draped over him and even going as far as to pull the other closer.
"Oh my god..." He muttered, trembling a little.
"Yes, you've said so," Draco nodded. "But you'll have to do it again, this is not the room it will show you for the party, sorry." Draco looked at the other, slowly tracing his features with his eyes and taking everything in bit by bit.
Harry didn't know how to tell the other goodbye. It felt weird to just leave with a 'yeah see ya' but he had no idea how else to leave. Should he shake the other's hand in some bro-ish fashion or just lightly pat him on the shoulder? A hug was too intimate, wasn't it? He decided to just pat the other's shoulder.
Granted permission, Harry's hand found the back of the blond's head, pulling the other in.
Ron suddenly hissed. "Why is Malfoy looking over here like that?" Surprised Harry scanned through the students seated at the Slytherin table for the blonde boy. He found the boy seated next to Pansy Parkison, his eyes on Harry. "I don't know..." He mumbled.
It went silent again, which caused another thought to pop up in Draco's head. Potter hadn't taken care of himself, why? And why hadn't his friends noticed this yet? Draco didn't expect the Gryffindor to be good at hiding emotions or feelings, so at least Granger should've noticed.
While they had grown much closer these days, he shouldn't get his hopes up nor expect anything. He wouldn't want him anyway. He ruined the life laid out for him, though he knew Malfoy wasn't all too keen on that future. Harry couldn't possibly decide to risk their friendship.
Harry couldn't help but smile at that. "Thanks Mal," he spoke in a hushed tone as if he were afraid for anyone else to hear him speak. "It means a lot." After a mere seconds, he decided to jump to his feet. Harry brushed the dust from his robes and scratched the back from his head.
Harry was taken aback. They had just come here, sat down and barely eaten anything. Where did they have to go anyway? Hermione sipped from her glass before she looked straight at the other girl. "You mean to the lake? I suppose it's quite crowded there already."
Draco never reached the dorms. Instead, he went to the library. He told himself it was because of his Arithmancy homework, but even he knew better. He'd seen Potter walk off in that direction. It wasn't like he wanted to be around him, but he did want to make sure he would keep his mouth shut about what happened.
"You're really taking this serious then, I'll see what I can do," she said, glancing at Draco with a little grin.
He really hoped this would work. He wanted to do something for Potter, and he wanted it to go well. Malfoy was a well-known perfectionist, which was a burden but could also be good at times. Right now it could actually lead to good things, even though it made him act completely out of character.
Ugh, why was it so hard to just formulate the right words? Why did his heart need to clench like that?
He wasn't planning on running around the halls with it, but could he leave it here?
Hermione gasped as she lightly hit the red-haired boy. "Ron! Harry needs to rest, you can't just make him run all the way over here." Harry stifled his laugh at the horrified look on his friend's face asking, no begging, him to help.
"I said no."
When the silence settled, Harry was sure the other either left or decided to stay quiet until he fell asleep. A little hum escaped his lips as he reached around him to grasp for the blanket, his fingers finding fabric soon enough. Did the blanket feel that silky before? Had to. With a pull to bring it over his head, little to none movement came in it and he let go with a frustrated groan.
Draco pulled back first, and it finally dawned on him what he'd done.
"You are gonna regret ever saying that, Draco Malfoy." He then resumed his way to the blonde, snowball ready to throw.
In his mind, old memories flashed by until it kept hanging on his two friends. Instead of concluding 'I should have more friends to spend my time with' his mind shifted to the whole other side of the story. "Or I have to find a Hermione to my Ron," he mumbled with a somewhat spotting tone.
"It's just that I don't have an answer yet," he softly explained, hesitantly bringing a hand up to the other's hair to play with it. "I'm not forgetting anything, it just needs some time." Draco wasn't sure if Harry had dozed off already, but didn't want to potentially wake him up to check. He looked so peaceful like this, it'd be a shame to disrupt that.
Harry frowned, wanting to ask why when he realized. Of course. The Malfoy's were probably trying to get away, as to why their son should have to stay at school. He slowly nodded, rubbing his forehead. "Same here," he mumbled. "I think I told you before how Ron asks me each year to come over, but after Fred's death, I don't feel like I should be there."
Draco looked back at the other, not really knowing what to ask for.
It was just the two of them, completely absorbed in their feelings.
"The 'I woke up in a hospital wing, tired, with wrinkled clothes, and now my mood is ruined' part. The 'maybe I've never wanted this' part," Draco hissed back.
He just couldn't live with the idea of the other thinking he hated him.
That stuck-up brat. "And after how you spoke to me about my father, you actually think I would just go ahead and listen to that request?" Draco raised one eyebrow as if Harry had just said something entertaining. "I thought the Gryffindor in you would naturally do the right thing, we'll see what that is. I'm just here because asking you to forget about it is a lot easier than asking a group of people to forget about it. It's a matter of efficiency, I'm not depending on you."
There was one that immediately turned to get some hot water and glass while Harry simply took it all in. It had been a while since he had seen so many house-elves, after Dobby's death he had it quite difficult with progressing it, especially when he saw another house elf. Dobby had been one of his friends, another person that died for him. That thought made him feel grim and his smile vanished. Maybe he shouldn't have brought those memories back, huh.
"Very much," Draco grinned, already loving the idea of a challenge. It had been a while since he'd had a real challenge. A fun one, that was.
"Okay then." He nodded.
"You're ruining me, Potter," he sighed.
Slytherins didn't stop before they got what they wanted, but he knew when to stop. And right now, there were enough stop signs surrounding the Gryffindor. However, sadly, this didn't restrict his emotions. If only he could just...
In any way, the Gryffindor was doing just fine. Great, even.
Harry's cheeks burned up at the thought of them casually hooking up and cuddling. Well, obviously he didn't mind that. Why would he even? It made him wonder what the other exactly wanted from him though. "That would be of no problem at all," he freely expressed, holding their eye contact now suddenly a way harder thing to do.
There were clear signs that it was getting quite hot and he couldn't help but to feel slightly nervous.
He took a deep breath, forcing himself to keep looking at the two Gryffindors. This wasn't the time to give into his emotions. "I can only hope you're willing to accept my apology. If there's anything I can do to make it up to you, please say so. I know it won't make up for the things I've done, but I want you to know I'm willing to at least try my best."
Green eyes widened as he saw the other shake and kicked the blankets away, regretting it as he noticed how warm the blankets had kept him. He grabbed them back as he stood up to wrap around him as he made his way towards the other. What was he actually planning to do? He only realized he was eye to eye when he stood there, staring at the other. Well, that was going to be awkward if he doesn't say anything.
Draco sighed. If that stubborn bastard wasn't going to the hospital wing himself, he'd have to drag him over there. He got a hold of the Gryffindor's arm, made sure he could lean on him and started walking out of the library and towards the hospital wing. He didn't care what Potter's friends would think, or what anyone else would think for that matter. He'd made his decision. He and the Gryffindor weren't arch-enemies anymore.
He'd never kissed someone like this before. Never had there been so many emotions linked to it.
Harry allowed the other to come closer as he simply pointed at it. "Uhm, like right here. After the part on how not to use Fairy Wing in it."
"I suppose so…" She mumbled, clearly deep in thought about something. She eventually turned back to Draco and folded her arms. "We're done here then?"
There it was. He'd said it.
"I mean… this was discussed during class, but you're usually busy with anything but the class, so, this doesn't surprise me." He stopped for a bit. "Snape isn't exactly the kindest either, he doesn't reward students in the right way. It should be based on knowledge, not houses." It sounded like a thing a Slytherin would never say, but it still fits with one of the main Slytherin traits: wanting to achieve things. Some preferred to do that by cheating, but most purebloods actually played fair game.
Malfoy grinned and got onto the ice as well, slowly easing into the familiar feeling of skating again. "Then don't slip."
It took another minute before Draco had found his voice again. He cleared his throat and got rid of the pressing silence that had surrounded them. "What are you doing here?"
If he were to say everything that was on his mind at that moment, he would talk about how confusing Potter was to him. How scared he was of anyone getting closer to him. How unsure he got around the Gryffindor and how he made Draco doubt himself. Whenever he was around Harry, he would say and do stupid things. It would feel like he wasn't in control anymore, and he hated not being in control.
He let out a deep breath as he shifted underneath the blankets and snuggled his head in his pillow. Such a cozy place. He drifted off soon enough with a content smile on his face as he thought about the things that happened that day. He had had quite a good day with the blonde Slytherin after all. There had been a few moments he had started to worry, like when the blond had almost fallen through the ice, yet he already deemed them fond memories.
Harry didn't really know how to respond to that, let alone had the will to do it. He simply shook his head with a sigh and turned back around again - he really had to find Ron or Hermione to help him after all.
"Well, I just happen to have lost my appetite due to my mood," Harry decided to at least tell the blonde part of the reason. He scratched the back of his head. It felt weird to have someone worry about him like this about him not finishing up his meal. Yet it felt kind of reassuring like you could fall back on that person.
"Which part are you referring to?"
Harry was gonna be bothered by the other moving, but he guessed that sitting up wasn't that a comfortable position to sleep in. When it got quiet and the movements stopped, he pried his other arm from underneath himself to wiggle underneath the other's neck to just slightly tighten his hold. Harry's heartbeat hadn't calmed down yet, but the heat that radiated from Malfoy was pretty reassuring.
When he was still unable to fall asleep he had started to pace around the room and bang his head against the wall several times, with time intervals due to Madame Pomfrey coming at him and tucking him back in. There had been a moment he fell asleep, but a nightmare had shaken him. It had caused him to space around, even more, that drove the nurse crazy. When he started to talk to himself though she had forced him back in bed and given him another potion - whatever that might have been. It made his drowsiness worse, so he guessed it should help him sleep. It did. He slept for over three hours maybe, until the effects of the potion couldn't hold his nightmares back and he was back at square one.
"Say Mal…" he started. "Did your mother ever talk about what happened?"
Draco decided to leave them be and simply went for some breakfast at the Slytherin table. The hall was already pretty empty, seeing as most students had probably left either last Friday or the previous evening already. The Slytherin table was also pretty empty, but Draco didn't mind that at all. All he wanted to do was get some quick breakfast anyway.
It seemed like the world had just stopped turning to allow them to take their time with this, but there was no way that could've actually happened.
This went on for a few minutes until the boy got stuck. Oh no. No, no, no. Not happening. He scratched the back of his head while taking a deep breath. Malfoy just explained this, didn't he? Oh man, maybe he shouldn't have questioned himself about their situation and just shut it all out to just focus on what the guy told him.
Right. He had to talk to Ron, he had to apologize, that should be his top priority.
Malfoy had moved his hands up to hold the other's face, but the Gryffindor had already turned around before he'd gotten the chance to do so. Hands left in the air he huffed a silent 'bastard', although he was hiding a small grin while trying to recover from the sudden 'attack'.
Maybe for the first time ever, Draco knew exactly how he felt. His eyes widened a bit at this resemblance, but he didn't say anything. Somehow it felt wrong to tell the hero that he, a former death eater, the kid of a man who'd murdered some of Potter's loved ones, felt the same way about the war. That he had the same nightmares and post-traumatic experiences. It simply wasn't his place to act as he'd gone through the same stuff.
The small creature just nodded and walked off again, already busy with the next task.
He blinked a few times and then decided to just answer the question.
He was so tired. He hadn't slept that well last night and Draco being this pompous jerk really didn't help him out. With one heavy sigh, he tried to get rid of all the negativity in him. "You know what, fine. I'll act as if you're not some kind of drama queen. Now, if you would please let me work."
He kissed him.
"Ah, yes. No problem." Harry shifted the blanket that was still wrapped around his frame. Should he change the subject? Maybe Ron and Hermione would visit him and it would be better if Malfoy left before that. He wasn't so sure. As his eyes fell on the Christmas decoration on the wall behind the blonde he felt a little request form in his head. "You know… Seeing we're both going to be staying at Hogwarts at break, how about we, you know, spent it together?"
Draco made a sudden, surprised sound.
As someone came walking by realization hit him, this was the way towards the Slytherin dungeons. He wasn't all that hungry so he had been having an inner dialogue with his food. Malfoy brought a stop to that for a few moments.
After a while, Draco noticed that he'd gotten lost in his own words. He'd just been talking and talking, and not really paying any attention to Potter. When he shifted his gaze to the other, he noticed how tired he looked. Actually, Draco was pretty sure he was already dozing off.
He started to whistle as he came to the end of his essay. It had been quite nice to actually sit back and not yell at one another. They should do this-ohhhhh no. NO. Stop. Right. There. Harry, keep your head cool. After this, they would just split up again and that was it… He guessed…
About to take a bite when Malfoy proposed that, the Gryffindor looked at the other with his mouth open wide, fork lingering in front of him in the air before he lowered it. He hadn't been sure on what he would do at Hogwarts, not on his own accord or with the blond. But if they could use the room of Requirement and host a party there with the others that would be quite the perfect way to spend their time.
This made him panic a bit, didn't they have school at this time?
For a moment Harry had to resist to pick the girl up and swing her around in the air. He was thankful for her words because he could already see others mumble in agreement to that, even though they seemed unsure, while others just shrugged it off and were okay with it in general. He didn't know why he had that effect on people.
"Yes, Hermione does," he hummed, "but it's not as easy to understand." He kept writing, not minding the silence that fell back. He would have been surprised by the guy asking about Hermione if he wasn't concentrating on his work.
"Listen, I'm either gonna resume my sleep or get some coffee, because this ain't working," he said as he stretched. Merlin, he hated not being brisk. "I don't know about you, but I suppose you need breakfast too."
"Sorry, I was too fast," he mumbled, not bothering to look if Potter had even heard it or not. The guy was probably asleep already, which was good. He had clearly needed it, and Malfoy wasn't going to keep him from finally getting some rest. If a boring study session was all it took, then so be it.
"What...? I have kissed before yes, though-"
Not sure what had gotten into him, he already started to list down things in his head. A bag of candy? Nah, Draco didn't seem like the guy to accept work for sweets. Maybe a muggle pen? It lasted longer than the ink of their feathers. But then again, he knew about the 'that is what she said' thing… There was no harm in trying though. He searched through his stuff in hope of finding one, looking almost victorious when he found one "What about this?"
While he should have just either have run or made the other forget he had ever even said that, he just laid there. This was comfortable and felt way too good for his sleep-deprived self to give up on. His chest was in knots, it made him feel paralyzed. With a small sigh, he dared to snuggle somewhat closer.
What now? Where they gonna stay in here or something? Surely, he didn't mind if he had to listen to another piece, but it also had something rare written in this scene. Because he would never think Draco Malfoy would smile at him like that. Wait, why was he even...?
With that last thought, his eyes found the other's grey ones. Yeah, he guessed that feeling of hatred had been seeping out of him ever since the Slytherin had helped him out with his Potion's homework.
A shiver ran down his spine as their lips met and Harry couldn't help but pull the other in even closer.
As he finally spotted the other, somewhere in the halls after passing through many of them, he let out a long breath.
He sat down on the edge of the lake and started to change into his skates. Pansy patiently waited for him, looking around if she saw any other friends. Draco was caught completely off guard when she started talking again, and immediately realized she'd chosen this moment to take her revenge for yesterday's argument. Very clever.
Conscious of his bare front, he lightly pulled his sweater back, hand going through his hair as if to fix it.
"It's not funny, Harry," Ron whined, pulling away from the wall as his friends came walking outside the class a few minutes later. "I told you to eat more at breakfast," Hermione stated in return and Harry grinned. "Let's just head straight for lunch. We don't want you to miss out and get sent away again," he added.
His hands were balled into tight fists out of frustration.
On his way back Harry noticed the two Slytherins being even cozier and he then and there decided he was just going to leave right this moment. He went over to Luna, opposite of the table where the blonde was talking with his Slytherin ex-girlfriend. "Luna, you know where Neville is hanging out?"
They have given me permission to post this, yet didn't wish to be mentioned as re-reading the contents had made them cringe and they rather not attach their name to this fanfic lol
Nothing too fancy, their lips had simply been pressed together and it lasted a few heartbeats.
"I mean, it's more practical that way…" He corrected himself. "I can also just do it myself."
Malfoy leaned back again. Something about all of this satisfied him. Teaching someone, and then seeing the result was quite satisfying. Maybe that's why people became teachers. He continued to kind of look around, lost in his thoughts.
He shifted their positions a bit so that he could reach the other's chest and latched his mouth onto it, not being patient enough to be slow and gentle.
"I don't suppose you know any pieces?" He asked casually, thinking of what to play.
It was as if all the frustration, all the tension between them that had been building up for years, was flooding out and pouring over them.
"I've never underestimated that," he said, opening up some books and looking over at the other. "Come on then."
It amazed him how easily it came to him to actually alleviate someone, though he wondered if it was something from the Weasley family or Hermione that had rubbed off on him. Harry wasn't sure about that one, to be frank.
Draco felt like he was about to be very sick when suddenly, something snapped. He nodded and wrapped his arms around the other, pulling him in closer and nuzzling his face into the sweater. Once again, he got reminded of how much he needed this. Everything else that was going on suddenly seemed incredibly unimportant. How had he been able to survive without this for so long? What was it that kept stopping him from getting closer to the Gryffindor? It was so easy, he wanted it so badly, why in the world was he still so reluctant to take what he wanted? Honestly, he didn't care anymore. Just to lay here, holding on to each other without a care of the world. This was so much better as when they had been in the hospital wing. Could this be like a thing? Was that possible? He felt like he really needed this, needed the other.
Harry felt stabbed. He stirred a bit before taking his speed up a notch.
He greeted them with a smile, which they both returned, as he asked them about the food-related task. "Sure, that's no problem at all. We got that covered," the reply came with a grin and he felt relieved. What, had he expected the Hufflepuffs to let him down or something? Harry returned to the table and put it down on the parchment.
They turned around to get back to where he had left Malfoy behind, intentions set on having a little chat with the blond. As the two friends talked, Malfoy got up to look at least a bit more respectable. He patiently waited for them to finish while thinking of what he could say to convince the redhead that he wasn't some kind of demon. When they approached him he tried to look calm and approachable, making sure Weasley could see he didn't have any bad intentions. He kept this posture as he started talking.
Draco nodded and sat up a bit more. "So you wouldn't mind getting used to it?" He asked, his face turning a bit more red than usual. He couldn't care, all he wanted was to just cuddle and be cozy. It was stupid, ridiculous, unusual, and very random, but he still wanted it and he wasn't going to deny himself this.
It was surprising how well he was able to read the other's emotions now, he wasn't even sure how that could be possible just because they'd kissed.
While he didn't really want to leave, his stomach was making it clear to him that was no choice.
"They canceled Quidditch this semester though," Harry immediately responded.
"When two people get caught under a mistletoe, they have to kiss or their souls get sacrificed to the devil…" he mumbled, repeating the words he had a girl scream in delight years back. Clueless, he had believed that. Well, until Ron had enlightened him that it really wasn't like that. At Hogwarts another rule was at play though, when two people were caught underneath it, their impulse control would be stimulated or something. He wasn't really sure how it worked, but the thing was enchanted and would make the two kiss no matter what. Yeah, he definitely didn't want to be caught underneath these things again…
"I thought you guys would be gone by now," he mumbled before he sat down.
"Yes," he continued their conversation. "I'm quite keen on my role" Harry felt himself grimace as he eyed the other.
A soft curse left his mouth between the kisses, a small sign of how much everything still overwhelmed him.
A nice and quiet thing like this couldn't last forever, which became clear when Draco noticed a black haired girl walking up to them. Several alarm bells in his head started to ring, pushing him back into his normal behavior instantly. Pansy couldn't catch him hanging out with Potter, especially not this peacefully.
They sat in silence, concentrating on their food as several students walked by. Some chose to go outside and enjoy the snow as Draco and Harry had done. Others went for the great hall to sit there and study or play games. Draco had never really understood why people did that in the great hall instead of the library or common room but suspected that they had their reasons to do so.
"This is infuriating."
After a while, the ice became less dark again, and he dared to get back up. He walked the last bit towards the Gryffindor and kind of leaned against him, half hugging him out of relief as soon as he reached him. Was he actually shaking? He didn't know, and he didn't care. All he knew was that he was glad to be safe again. He mumbled a few soft curse words and buried his face in the fabric of the other's robes.
As Malfoy had spoken a few took that as a sign to leave while others just took a few steps away to settle down on the tables again. The girl behind the blond had kept a look of amusement through the whole ordeal and it made him wonder if something was funny about it, yet he decided not to ask. Instead, he grabbed for a glass to fill with water while he studied the list of students.
"I'm implying that there's always a few who manage to smuggle illegal stuff onto the grounds, nothing super serious of course, but fun at parties. Just funny drinks, magically modified stuff and such, can make things a lot more fun." Draco hadn't taken much of this stuff himself, he liked to know what he was doing and remember it afterward. "And I know, that sounds kinda shady, but no one's ever died from it and I think there's much shadier stuff out there that we can't even get our hands on, so…"
Draco allowed himself to smile faintly at this. He would've been devastated if the party were to be canceled just because of him. He didn't want that for Potter, nor for the other people that were already so excited about it.
Harry's mouth fell open, literally. Now, this was not alone a dangerous zone this was heading to, he was just so confused. "You…" He mumbled, at the loss of words. "You are actually willing to?" His eyes flew over the blonde's face in disbelieve, a deep frown edged on his face. Why would this even turn out this way? The last time was an accident, a little thing called a potion that made him act weird and Malfoy just had run out of enough energy to get rid of him.
The blonde smiled, his cheeks were a bit flushed from the compliment, but also from the kissing that had preceded it.
It was clear Potter wasn't in the mood to talk, but he cared little about that. "I want you to forget what happened just now." That surprised the Gryffindor. Forget what he just said? Well, that little- "I'm not sure what you're talking about Malfoy." He let a silence linger to give the blond time to form an answer before cutting in. "Or you must be talking about the way you had been rolling around the floor? I mean, I knew you were in Slytherin but that it would mean you would just up and go act like a snake all the way?"
Harry was surprised by the sudden entrance of the two Slytherins, Parkinson more to the back as Malfoy was. Not to mention the other had stated his first name in the greeting, yet he made note that the blonde had probably done that because of the presence of the other students. As he realized the other kept eye-contact with him, a smile graced his features as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
There was a moment that Madame Pomfrey came walking in with a student that had gotten sick by eating too much. She had been busy with the child until she went to get something and passed by him. He hadn't seen her surprised look then, but when she came to him, a frown on her face, he was pulled back to the here and now.
"I just couldn't accept the idea that I loved you, Potter, I'm still struggling with it. It's just so hard to ignore and it's shown me more than once that I can't. It makes me uncontrolled and emotional and confused. It scares me, but it's stuck within me. I love you and there's nothing I can do about it."
The Golden trio sat there for a few minutes in silence, eating their breakfast, until the time came that the couple had to pack their stuff. As Ron packed the last of his things, back at the dorms, Harry sat on the end of the bed, silently observing the other. Ron finished up quickly, and they made their way to the common room to wait for Hermione to come to join them.
"Ah," he raised one of his legs up to balance his hands on as he let his head rest on them. "I just remembered a specific blonde dramatically rolling over the ground when he didn't receive the so-wanted attention. Seeing our situation now, I found it quite ironic." He gave the other a smirk as he finished, quite amused with himself for some reason. It was he who had been embarrassed while Malfoy could have cared any less, so why would it amuse him like this? He had no idea, but it just brought that smile on his face for some reason…
"Just checking up on you, they'll find a way to blame me if you're dying." He mumbled, tightening his grip around the strap of his bag.
"Mal, are you awake? I can't sleep," he mentioned.
Focused on his own little bubble he missed how they had moved towards the library. Hermione had said they should just head there as she needed a book as well, but he had failed to pay attention. The dizziness got worse and black spots formed in front of his eyes. "You know, I was meaning to ask you before…" Ron started. Harry hummed to encourage him to continue as the small spots turned to rather large black pools, his body swaying. "I heard from other students that they were going home for Christmas and all, and I was quite excited to go home myself but you don't really want to go home, I guessed. So what I thought- maybe you should just join us this year again."
"Should have brought something warmer," he complained. His eyes fell on the blonde.
"You were in the hospital wing weren't you?"
He had given Harry the completely wrong signals, which he'd just interpreted as disgust and dislike.
There had been a period, just before the war, when Draco had been neglecting himself just like Potter had done. With voldemort occupying his mind, his father engulfed in shady business, a war coming up and heavy responsibilities pressing upon his shoulders, he'd fallen into terrible habits. He'd completely ignored himself and become an empty, walking shell. Just a face with nothing behind it. Eventually, the stress and poor self-care had to lead up to a burn-out, which had left him stuck in his bed for weeks. Draco looked back at Harry and put his thoughts aside.
Potter was sitting at one of the tables in the back of the library when Draco strode in, wearing a grim expression and ignoring the other students. He leaned on one of the chairs and cleared his throat to indicate his presence. Harry allowed his eyes to slowly slid away from the potions book to find Draco Malfoy looking down at him. God, if there was anyone he didn't want to see right now… His eyes narrowed. "What do you want this time Malfoy?"
"I understand," he said. "I will try to talk to him. You shouldn't be fighting with your friends just because… " he hesitated for a moment. "Well, just because we're not enemies anymore."
"It's no problem," he mentioned faintly, still busy with his thoughts. Potter's crushing on someone, Potter's crushing, who is it, how did I not notice before… Draco really had a hard time pushing these thoughts away but didn't manage to suppress his curiosity.
Harry couldn't help but snort. Yes, he was well aware the Slytherin house wasn't going to evacuate the school to return home. Some didn't want to return home, because they knew someone would be missing at the dinner table, and others knew they wouldn't want to come back if they finally came home. The war left a mental scar on a lot of students, which Hogwarts only made burn.
"I think I'd like grilled cheese... with herbs, if possible," he said slowly.
Draco sat up a bit more, looked at the nurse's office, which was clearly empty, and scoffed. "Fuck Pomfrey. I need coffee, you need water, that's obviously not here, so let's just go." He really couldn't care about anything anymore at this point. He didn't care about Pomfrey, nor about what would happen if he and Harry entered the great hall like this. He'd cared too much about others already, right now he couldn't care less what people thought.
He thought he would miss that atmosphere this Christmas, though he had chosen for this himself, yet with their plans to hold a party to include all houses that might change. Christmas at the Weasley's sounded amazing.
Malfoy got himself some coffee and started silently sipping, his grip on the cup being a tad tighter than needed. He was glad there was no one trying to talk to him. His friends, or what was left of them, were either still in the Slytherin dormitories or already done eating. The other students around him didn't talk to him either, which Malfoy had gotten used to by now. Most of them were younger than him and judged him for being a former death eater. The rest was either too scared or despised him too much.
'Maybe take a shower first, huh.'
His voice had left him and the words wouldn't come. Instead, he deepened the kisses.
"Sure thing, but if no one knows what's going on it'll just continue. I understand that I'm not the person you want to talk to, but let me remind you that I've also spilled a little insecurity to you." Draco spoke, reminding himself of his mother. She would've said the same thing if it were Draco laying on a hospital bed.
Letting out a deep sigh, Harry let himself sink back on the bench and drop his mop of dark hair against the wall. "I had no idea…"
Draco sighed and finished his lunch. There was no use in all of this, he just had to focus on his classes.
He probably did, but that wasn't as satisfying as nagging Potter. Or rather, a lot less entertaining. Right now he wasn't joking, the essay didn't make sense. As much of a drama queen as he could be, Draco did strive for good results. He wasn't as pushy with it as Granger, but it did grant him good grades. Potions wasn't an exception. He was very suitable to help Potter, but why would he do that? Maybe if there were something to gain…
It was too quiet. Too peaceful. They should be fighting, not sitting together in peace. It wasn't like them at all… But it was nice, for a change. Kind of. It certainly was a lot less exhausting. "Doesn't Granger help you out with this stuff?" Draco asked. They were chatting anyway, so he just went with it.
"So, after this…" He began, unsure how to finish the sentence.
He took another step back, swaying a bit as to mimic a jump, but not actually jumping because he knew that was probably a bit dangerous. He saw the worry on the other's face, the genuine care. It surprised him a bit, but also reminded him of the thing that explained it. He liked it though, he liked worrying the other because it showed that at least someone cared about his well-being. Was that a healthy thing to think, standing in the middle of a frozen lake like this? He pushed the thought aside and kept moving back, bit by bit, flashing the other a mocking grin.
Malfoy shook his head to get rid of that thought and looked at the black haired girl next to him. "So, why have you been smiling like someone's about to make a really nasty, but entertaining fall?"
He'd said it to protect himself, but when he looked back at it, it was a bit… well, very rude actually. Maybe that was really just the thing that'd put him into Slytherin. He thought about apologizing but didn't. Potter wasn't worth his effort, right?
He had to convince himself that he could love him, that it was okay to do so.
He did want to go. He didn't like hanging around this arrogant twat. The boy who lived. The young Malfoy was still convinced he didn't deserve the fame. He hadn't achieved it, he'd just rolled into it. To Draco, a Slytherin, this had always seemed very unfair. However, not liking Potter meant that he'd do anything to annoy him. If the boy asked him to leave, he simply wouldn't. "You'll fail potions, you know. With an essay like that…"
It was weird to walk towards the Potions classroom when there were no classes. Halting in front of the door he tried not to groan, just knocking on the door as it almost immediately swung open. Snape was in the front of the room and he slowly rose his eyebrow as he saw him, though the man should have expected him by now. "I see you have finally decided to come by, Potter."
Ah yes. Decorations. This time he didn't speak but just went off towards the Slytherin table to ask around. Wasn't he eager now? If he were honest though, he just didn't like the closure that had displayed between the two Slytherins just now and wanted to be away from it. He didn't like how he felt angry, he had no right to be anyway. Trying to fling his thought out the window was what he was simply doing now as he tried to check off the list for the party. Though if he were to keep himself busy with that event, the list had to grow even longer, didn't it?
"About Malfoy and I. It was sudden, I know, and I didn't want to hurt your feelings. But now the two of us have set our rivalry, if you could call it that, aside I just wanted you to accept him as well. Sorry if I rushed things or yelled. That was wrong."
The question was if Potter would be willing to help him with it. The mere thought of curling up against the other, pressing his face into the soft sweater, being warm and taken care of... Draco had truly steeped to his lowest level of decency. The only assurance he had was that he couldn't get any lower, which was his only reason for accepting it.
Draco frowned and thought about a way to distract Potter from the dark lord. That wasn't an easy task, especially because no one could control dreams, but maybe there was a way. "You need something that'll occupy your thoughts more than Voldemort." He eventually concluded, after having thought it through a few times.
Draco hesitated for a moment, but eventually spoke up. "I'll only tell you what you wish to know," he answered, his voice still appearing awful. As much as he just wanted to lose himself in the other, thrust his problems at him, and overwhelm him with himself, he had enough decency to not do so.
I'm not J.K Rowling nor is my collaboration partner and thus we don't own Harry Potter nor do we get paid for any of this.
Draco couldn't help but feel a bit triumphant.
It was harsh to talk about his family like this, and he couldn't deny there had never been any form of love between him and his parents, but then why had they left without him? Why had his father always been so cold towards him? Why had they shown so little care over the years?
Kind regards,
Pansy had always said he took too much care of his appearance. Or rather, that he cared too much. His morning routine was considerably longer than that of his roommates, but they'd accepted that by now. He just liked to look decent, another remainder of his upbringing. So after taking care of his hair, which he'd been dying to do ever since it had been messed up the previous day, he left the dormitories, carrying a pair of figure skating skates. He'd found them underneath his bed, where they'd been laying for quite a while. It had amazed him that the house elves had never gotten rid of them, not even after the war.
With this thought stuck in his mind, he started making his way to the Slytherin dormitories. The library wasn't an option, it was too crowded with people that he didn't want to see.
Eventually, the elf came back in quite the excited manner with a glass of hot water and a few bags, clearly not sure if the blonde would be satisfied with just the usual flavored tea. Draco smiled and took the cup that was handed to him, together with one of the bags of tea.
It felt as if he indirectly approved of a part of Malfoy's personality. For some reason this made his insides squirm, almost making him feel giggly. He was glad Potter approved of him. He turned to look at the other.
He was just acting out his whims and urges.
Taken aback he stared at the other. He was somewhat confused. "Say what? That you're precious? As I said, it just slipped." Harry knew it was vague, yet he didn't really want to go on. It was not as if he could say he- "Just put down my feelings."
A big part of this story has been written alongside someone else.
Draco nodded with a scoffing laugh. "For your information, you've called me a christmas miracle. I think that pretty much explains how far off you were."
A glassy stare had fallen over his face, making him look even more dysfunctional. He just didn't know how to react to this and was still trying to manage his thoughts. Meanwhile, Potter was distancing himself from him and Draco silently cursed himself for not being able to do anything. He didn't want the other to leave, he'd enjoyed being so close, he hadn't scared him, right?
Potter's presence was bothering him less and less now, he actually didn't mind that much anymore. "But yes, I do value this," he continued with a softer voice. "Calms me down."
However, he wondered if it was wise to go out and play one-on-one after his lack of sleep. He also asked himself what they would do if Madame Pomfrey wouldn't let him go. Would he have to stay here another night? And what about Malfoy, what if he met Ron and Hermione in the hallways? After Ron's sudden outburst he wouldn't be surprised if they would act out even more on the rivalry act.
The room was just so peaceful and silent, it wasn't hard to lose himself while playing. It came like second nature to him, he didn't need to think about what to do. It was great to not think about anything for a little while.
Draco shook his head. "No, no it's nothing you've done. You've been nothing but kind to me for a while now." He looked up at Harry, seemingly hesitating on something.
Call it Fanservice
"You must be very dense than," he sneered back. Malfoy had been pestering Potter since year one because of one simple reason: he was incredibly easy to anger. Draco always got the reaction he wanted, it was honestly the most entertaining thing.
Draco merely snickered, feeling like he was winning this fight already. "Are you giving up then? Look, I'm perfectly fine."
The other had secretly hoped that the blonde would have come after him, but obviously, that guy only cared about himself. He walked towards the library, that potion homework wouldn't write itself.
Ron was the first to come to him at the beginning of his first year at Hogwarts. They had become good friends over the years and Hermione had even joined them, making them known as the Golden Trio. He knew they would have some issues with him suddenly coming up with 'hey I have befriended Malfoy, you two should too' but his emotions had ruled him and he hadn't been reasonable when he spoke to Ron. If it were Hermione, things might have turned out differently. But now Hermione avoided him in order to both not anger her boyfriend as to force the two to talk. Harry hadn't seen Ron ever since their argument as well… It had made him both mad at the other as himself.
With little resistance from his impulse control, he wrapped his arms tightly around the other to press him further in, another breath of relief coming from him. "For Merlin's sake, Mal, have a little mercy on my heart. What were you even thinking, that part was way too fragile."
Immediately he felt his body tense and a lump formed in his throat.
Even if he overlooked the lack of nourishments, he knew they couldn't stay in here forever.
Harry only realized he had spoken out loud when it clicked as of how he knew his voice was hoarse, and in frustration, he started to assemble the blanket away on the bed.
The way Potter put things, confused Malfoy a bit. He didn't question it though and simply nodded his head. Apparently, Potter didn't care if it was a girl or a guy, which was new to the Slytherin. It made him wonder, but he didn't say anything.
The few students that were present around the table seemed surprised at first as he came up to them but soon enough joined him to discuss some things. Just to stretch time, he took out some parchment to make them draw some examples. He was going to be sorry for this behavior at the end of this day, he noted as he felt his mind grow heavy already with all the thoughts piling up one another.
Could it be anything? They weren't going to have a whole dinner here, right?
Draco grumpily avoided her expectant gaze. "You're allowed."
"Morning, Harry." She looked him over with an eyebrow raised. "You seem… quite fresh yet tired somehow."
Harry was confused at first as the other was standing still instead of moving away. Was he still taunting him? The blonde was looking at the ice beneath him and didn't budge an inch. It was only when he saw how the other's face was turning pale that he realized what was going on.
Draco merely gave him a confused look. "I meant helping you… not… doing it completely…" Had he been clear enough about that? Maybe not, but it was worth mentioning. He'd keep his word, which unlike his untrustworthy image, was part of his loyal personality.
But then again, Potter didn't have experience either, Right? Or had he?
"That damn Malfoy…"
It was a good thing Potter had left him some time to gather himself before he asked the question. Draco wouldn't have been able to answer with a steady voice if it had been asked just a minute ago. "I'm staying here," he replied coolly, leaving it to Harry to figure out what that meant. He would probably have a jolly Christmas over at the Weasley's house, with a lot of friends and people who were dear to him. He was the hero, he deserved that after all.
Hermione internally groaned. He had a point, but it was just so weird for Harry to refer to this guy as Mal, let stand let him , she had to say Harry didn't really seem on his best behavior today. He looked way too pale and tired and didn't want anything to eat or drink this morning. With a huff, she looked at Ron. "As weird as this might sound, I think we have to believe his word." Ron gasped and wanted to reply, bring her back to her senses. "Ron. You saw how Harry was acting this morning. And I bet his nightmares haven't just disappeared, which will do no better. We should at least take a look." Ron grumbled at that, knowing he couldn't deny that. He took another look at the paper before he followed Hermione, who gave nothing but a curt nod to the Slytherin. He trusted the paper in the blonde's hands. "You better seem as friendly as this letter and your story make you seem to be," he barked, leaving the library as well.
After seeing the quick smile, Draco turned away again. That hadn't looked like staring, right? They had had fights across the hall all the time, this was nothing special.
It wasn't until Malfoy saw the other's unease that he got reminded of the fact that maybe he did have a secret. Draco had spoken without thinking about it, but couldn't think of anything else now that he was reminded of it. Potter seemed unusually nervous, what did that mean? Was Draco right?
"How come you were practicing now? Are you planning to play at the party?" Though that would be great, Malfoy had just told him this was rather personal. Then why had the other come here to play? If it was to get his mind of things, was it because of the party? If that were the case, he should have just told him.
He was lucky that he'd given up crying years ago. All his body could do now was shake and heat up from the emotions. He didn't want to break down in front of Potter, he couldn't. At this point, however, it wasn't a matter of wanting. He'd already broken down.
Draco hadn't expected this. He'd thought that, especially after the war, Harry would want to be with the remaining people. That he'd want to be with them because they were still alive, to celebrate that. Draco couldn't find a reason for him to stay at Hogwarts, which probably only reminded him of the battle that had taken away so many people. Draco, on the other hand, had become convinced that it was his right to stay here. To stay at the place that reminded him of the awful things he'd done as some kind of punishment. All the death eaters had been punished, except for him. It was only fair for him to stay here without his family.
Harry had felt quite lonely even though he had friends besides those two, like Luna and Malfoy. Yet he felt differently when he was with the blonde. It felt the same as when he had been crushing on Cho Chang, as when he had been dating Ginny and was looking forward to seeing her again so that he could kiss her. Fuck. Malfoy was just being a nice friend and offering some guidance, there was no need to have expectations and hope for things that would never happen. Why did this happen anyway? Was it because of last night?
"Well, good luck down there." He turned around on his heel, robe flying after him, as he continued on his track.
The thought that he was glad the room of requirement existed crossed his mind. They certainly could not have been doing these things in the hospital wing without anyone walking by and seeing them. He knew some people would be fairly surprised, maybe even shocked, if they were to find them like this.
"Leave Ron out of this, Malfoy," Harry mumbled, trying to concentrate on the words he was writing down. "Does it anger you?" A small smirk spread across Draco's face. "I am merely displeased with your words," came his response to the blonde. He didn't feel like looking up, knowing that the Slytherin probably had a smirk plastered on his face. "Now, I do believe your business with me is done, so if you just leave and let me do my stuff. I'm sure you have another letter to write to your father."
"Depends, how do you feel?" the blonde asked.
It apparently woke Neville up as he found said guy shoot him a confused look that soon turned in worry, Harry simply offered him a smile. "Don't worry, I'm fine," he said before the other could speak up. Neville slowly nodded before getting out of bed, eyes darting to the clock. It was 9 am, enough time for a relaxed breakfast.
