important was Courting Potter Properly, all in ten days or less, max. This to enact the vilest form of revenge Draco could possibly conceive of which wouldn't physically harm a hair on that spry Seeker's body of Harry's nor a single atom of that tenderly innocent Gryffindor heart of his. But still—it would be a proper Malfoy revenge and Harry would know it as exactly that, Draco swore to himself.
Potter nudged Malfoy hard in the ribs, sloshing the half-gone contents of Draco's tumbler. "Go on with you, git. Stop playing around."
"Next time, Draco, wait for a reply, alright?" Harry smirked, drawing back and favouring his idiot fiancé with a superiour stare. He felt he'd a right to; not everyone could shut a Malfoy up so thoroughly when one was in a full spate of temper—nor would everyone care to, either. It took a special kind of Wizard—a real Hero—to accomplish such acts of bravery. Clearly, he and Malfoy were meant for one another. "It's not done to leave without one, dumb arse!"
Draco was already on his feet and walking towards their kitchen, a well appointed room Harry tended to avoid like the plague. He glanced back over his shoulder.
Draco doggedly kept on to the meat of the matter: establishing a favour owed. “And I—ah, well…I suppose you may borrow my copy, Potter, if you promise not to dog-ear the pages nor damage it in any way. Overnight, only. I can’t exactly spare it for long. I’m opting for a career in Advanced Potions, after NEWTS.”
"Next year," Draco murmured as they turned to go, low and intimate, and meant only for Harry's ears. "Next year, Harry, it's the rings in the window. Did you see?"
Harry shot Draco a look; one that implied any number of emotions, all quite unspeakable; his eyes very green indeed beneath his dark lashes.
“Grimmauld itself, though? Hmm, how strange,” Draco murmured, following after. Harry gallantly handed him the fancy urn which held the special Unspeakable floo powder. “Ta. Manor’s all wonky and now you say Grimmauld also is. I wonder if it’s a related issue? Blood ties, you know.”
"Oh, I don't know, Hars." Millie tilted her head at her handful of things wrapped in thin pancake and smiled. "It might be serious this time. You never know. Not with Lovegood."
"Nope. That's it." The black curly tendrils quivered as Harry gently shook his head. His hair was a shade too long but Draco liked it that way, too. He wished he'd had the chance to observe Harry growing it out. If the world spun the proper way, he would've. He'd never have missed a moment, if he's his druthers. "Sorry, but not, Malfoy. I'm done, finished, through with you. And I'm leaving now. I never should've stopped to even hear you out, you know? I was just here for a break, to get out. And I have the bad luck to run into you. But it's over now. This isn't doing either of us any favours."
"Ngh!" Harry shivered, even as he burnt to shamed ashes. This was awful; he resolved never to love anyone again—certainly never to admit it.
Pansy’s wand, stuffed into the cushion next to her, chimed loudly; once--twice--thrice. She cast down her knitting and took it up, silencing it.
your Kneazle Nip, you lying git. We both knew back at Flamel that you choose the Runes Mastery specifically because it
"Jealousy, twat," Hermione announced, "is counter-productive." Ron huffed, nodded again—sharply, smugly-at Draco's mumbling confession, his cheeks mottling faintly red with stifled ire. Draco paled, impossibly so. Had he said that last out loud?
Draco rolled his eyes back in his head. It was just like the Hogwarts Express, smashing some unwary Kneazle flat on the rails. Really. That fast, that shocking—that Gryffindor-batshit insane!
Of his parents. Hagrid. Professor McGonigal. Uni days, after, and new friendships forged, new horizons opened, his old ones graciously expanded.
He smiled, a genuine grin that Potter matched instantly, and pushed himself off the wall, making his way back across the intricately woven woolen carpet.
"The same as ever was, Draco," Harry pronounced. "Been there, done that. Talent show, remember, git-for-brains?"
"Interested in beekeeping, Potter?” he asked quietly, and sat himself down when he caught sight of the elevenses tray resting on their coffee table. His favourite mug was also there, along with a fresh pot of his preferred blend, plus a small plate of pastries Harry must’ve picked up along the way back from the MInistry. “You’ve never mentioned.”
—up again, though he'd barely just let him go; hard and fast and all inclusive, practically lifting the smaller man right off his feet, burying his steaming hot face into Potter's frowsy, wild hair, "aslongasyoupromisetowearmine!"
fine. And shut up about my feelings, cause you're the one to blame for me even having them, arse. Now, let's go the fuck
Hermione was laughing, soundlessly. Or at least her shoulders were shaking and her face was pink. Neville and Seamus, their nearest neighbors, only stared, as gobsmacked as Harry. They’d not, however had the advantage of the truly volcanic surge of anger that was building up in his gut.
He tore open his trunk, grabbing at broom and cloak haphazardly—and then halted, eying the ring glinting on his finger. He'd stuffed it on in his hurry and now it tingled oddly.
"Nope, sorry," Harry smiled into Draco's throat, where he'd shoved his cold nose, the little git. "You ate, already?"
"Draco..." Potter replied evenly enough, though a subtle note of warning infused his voice. "You're not making sense. Come on."
"…likely we should talk this over. Not that I'm good at talking things over—rather pants at it, really, but—"
Very amusing, and quite ironic, too. Rather like discovering Snape had him polishing cauldrons nightly so that Headmistress McGonagall wouldn’t crucify their arses for shagging improperly on Hogwarts premises. Snape’s Notice-Me-Nots were industrial strength power—and hadn’t
way; hadn't even been able to imagine it. "The timing? I mean—I mean to say, it's not like there's anyone else—"
"Hey, hey, Harry…" Draco asked, after a long moment, during which both young men established they still retained all their usual bits, unaltered. "Okay? No—no
“About five minutes remaining, I should think,” Draco replied calmly, easing himself upright. He stepped away; Harry missed his departing warmth intensely. “We may finish the report for Peesely if you like. And then you may go, as you so wish. But safely.”
His face fell. His shoulders slumped. His kneecaps were full of the strangest sensation…and his wings slowed finally:
Pansy crocheted, or possibly knitted, whatever; it was something with wicked sticks involving creating very long rectangular swathes of interestingly-hued woolies. She claimed it was for ‘stress’ and had repeatedly tried to encourage Draco to partake. Now, he eyed the loopy skein askance and did his best to avoid her disappointed side-eyed stare, regarding the bundle of wool resting upon his lap with great intensity.
“Yeah, please,” Nott grumbled. “Please, please, please, you mental patient. I’m fucking freezing my bits off. Two warming Charms, mate, and some cocoa.”
“Tell you what, I’ll pass it over to you after supper, Potter. In the Library, at eight sharp. Meet me there.”
But he couldn’t and Draco shouldn’t and that was a fanciful pipedream his mental musician was playing him, and for now he could only look—and dream, eyes wide open. And
“I see it, Harry,” Luna replied, coming to stand at his shoulder. She raised her wand, clasping his larger hand in hers. “Ready?”
“Worse than the Mark, right," Harry prompted gently after they rounded two entirely unexpected bends in the apparently straight hall and then carefully navigated a sudden small fountain. It was a cherub, set about with assorted greenery.  "Yes, this is decidedly wonky, alright. Well, go on then. What happened next?”
He shivered, barely repressing an unmanly giggle. His heart nigh bubbled up his throat, trying to burst out and fly away, like the twinned snitches.
“Giving you a bloody hug, what do you think?” Harry replied happily, stifling a small yawn and withdrawing just enough for Draco to be free of his wild hair. “It’s an apology. Luna does them and it's nice. Hmm, you’re warm as anything, you know? Ta for that.” Squirming, he pushed himself closer, snugging up to Draco’s torso, his arms naturally loosening as he relaxed. Another sudden yawn overtook him, which then inevitably prompted Draco to wish to yawn as well. “Merlin, but I’m knackered. Too”--he yawned again, the bugger--"tired to budge. May I sleep here, M’foy?”
"Right," Harry nodded. "Uh—see you, Hermione. Ron," he repeated and finally the two of them moved on ahead, to Draco's great—and unspoken—relief.
“Do you?” Draco’s voice was light and casual; the careful grasp he had on Harry’s collarbone was anything but. “I wonder, sometimes.”
Harry—was under the impression he was being a friend to the snot-nosed wench! A very true-blue one, all because the little skank had had her wittle grubby heart injured by that nasty cheating Finnegan sot, and now she was bereft of male company and sorely in need of a keeper.
"You're an unmitigated arse," Draco alternatively groaned and snogged and talked with alacrity, never ceasing the flow of any. "You have not a bloody clue—no sense at all," he informed his captive. "To even think! I'm ashamed of you, I am—you stupid, speccy git! Don't you ever use that shaggy head of yours for anything other than yapping nonsense?"
“Shut it, you flaming arse.” Draco's lip twitched. “I’m not, really. Just experiencing a very healthy and rational amount of concern at the moment, that’s all. As you should be, too, if you weren’t
Amazing, however, though descriptive and apt, did not by any means confer either dignity nor oratorical skill upon a supplicant when one was placed in the peculiar position of begging one's hugely significant other to accept one's hand in marriage. But, heedful of his Mum's warnings about wasting no time in slamming that ring of Grandme're's upon Harry's finger, it was the very next evening Draco went down on one boney kneecap and proposed. To his Harry, like a proper Wizard. He made a right mash of it, naturally, but at least it was accomplished.
lately, since he's literally not allowed right now. Who did you hear this from? What 'bird'? Are you certain?”
Harry turned to the Wizard eagerly, as far as Draco's arms allowed it. Draco kept his eyes lowered for another second or two, blinking faster than usual, perhaps. The poor excuse for a decent shop was terribly, terribly dusty inside. Obviously lacked decent house elves to clean it.
Besides…now he had a viable goal of his own for next Slytherin practice. He’d duplicate that final move of Potter’s. The one with all the curlicue bits and the spirals, like a Wronski but not. Bloody well perfect it, because no way was
He was all at once feeling quite hot-and-humid about the kneecaps and the base of his spine ached oddly, panging. He swallowed with difficulty, mentally flailing for composure. The Healer had warned him of what to expect but Harry had rather been hoping to be done with his part of the waiting paperwork for the case and be well away from Draco's vicinity before any of the patently obvious effects of the spell showed themselves. It only lasted a few hours altogether, Veritas, but he’d not been able to delay his return to their office any longer, as much as he wished he might.
“His shoulders have really gotten broad, have you noticed?” Harry asked Ron this on the way to Transfigurations. “For his height, I mean. Makes him look taller still, that. I think it’s his hips, too. He’s not exactly looking overfed, is he?”
A squabble instantly broke out; Harry retreated, fed up. Malfoy’s hair was looking better and better, over at the peaceful Slytherin table, just happily gleaming.
"That's true, mate, sorry," Thomas horned in. "I've had the pleasure of being consulted as to how to unlock Harry's wards—not that you can, mind you. Not that anyone can."
, kneeling pathetically and offering up his pathetic little heart gift-wrapped for all to see. To a Plebe, who simply had no concept! "Look at me, berk! Down here!" he hissed.
Hermione would scold him over breakfast and the whole damned day would be shot to flinders. Disappointing from the start, really.  Bloody hell.
." He hung on with both hands to the chairs arms, gripping them fast. Leaving Grimmauld was not an option; not now he was inside. Inside, he still had a chance, he knew. If he allowed Harry to usher him out, he might as well give up on Harry altogether. The little git was that bull-headed. "Not if I've got this far, at least."
even said, for that matter, but I didn't mean it, whatever it was. Not to hurt you. I would never, ever hurt you, not by choice. Not by accident, either! You have to know that by now."
"Huh." Draco clamped down on the scowl he felt rising; schooled his features into blandness. "Of course, Harry. Pity—got it to spare, I do. For
"Why should I?" It was a dark growl, flung over his collar carelessly, and blond locks flopped restlessly when Draco asked it. "Why should I even bother, Potter?"
Then Harry’s best mate took a long lascivious lick over his half-consumed sage-and-onion banger, with a great deal of unnecessary tongue showing.
"Oh. Um." Harry grinned at him, and life was good. "Sooo. Like we'll pretend I never saw any of that, then?" All balance was instantly restored and Grimmauld Place would make a nice house to let for a little extra income because it was crystal clear Harry and Draco wouldn't be living here. "I see how it is. Scaredey-pants, Malfoy. Coward; afraid of a few feelings. Fine, then."
That it didn't matter if Draco's arm was Marked, or that his own father was a criminal and incarcerated in Azkaban. That it was purely incidental he'd tried to murder Dumbledore several times and had very nearly succeeding in harming unto death any number of other, innocent people, including Potter's best mate.
“Yeah,” Draco sighed, the little twinge of anxiety fitfully subsiding. “Okay, I sort of see your point. Though I can’t see how you’d ever think Kreacher was a better roommate than me.”
Harry gulped. Forgive him? Forgive him for what, precisely? Draco hadn't done a thing but mumble, froth a bit over something, shout about rings and-and leave as if the demons of Hades itself were chasing him—oh, hey!
Draco was nodding politely, though; agreeing with his papa's words despite himself. Some old habits died hard indeed and lamenting over Potter's general arse-ishness was one of them.
Interpretations – can indicate or symbolize a connection between two people – the giver and the recipient.

It can also mean that you should contemplate your own contributions and self-sacrifice. Are you holding back or giving too freely to those who may be taking advantage? With Gebo it’s important to always be mindful of balance in relationships whether it’s romantic, friendship or business.
For they'd been ensconced happily and peacefully in Gryffindor's untasteful-to-the-extreme Common Room, which was thankfully deserted due to the lateness of the hour. Draco had snuck through a window in the Tower, secretively flying up to meet Harry as per their agreed-upon assignation. The ring had been burning a hole in his trouser's pocket for nearly a whole day at that point; Draco couldn't wait a moment longer to get his torment over with and done. He'd a plan. He'd snog Harry into pliability and then execute the Burning Question. And Harry would agree, blinded as he was by both Draco's love and Draco's Veela.
"Oh," the pale eyebrows soared, "I'm not being snide, Potter," and the white teeth flashed. Harry closed his eyes briefly against the lust-love combo that sloshed through him like battery acid. Malfoy chuckled, obliviously amused. "I was just taken aback, a little. You…surprised me."
Harry cycled through that syllable a few too many times for anyone’s liking all the while doing a very weird thing with his body, by shoving hastily at Draco’s chest whilst tangling his bare legs completely about Draco’s pajama-clad ones. For a split-second Draco could only mightily boggle.
, a Malfoy! And you disregarded every rule of Purebloody Courtship, Harry. I have to make it right, somehow; don't you get it? Now, listen and listen well—"
how much effort I’ve put into the Manor, to return it back to the Light--you and Ronald have come and helped me, for Merlin’s sake! How could you even suggest I give up my home, the home of my family for eons?”
Draco dragged his lips into a wry smile, increasingly uncomfortable with Harry's thanking him for something he would have done anyway. Truly, it was best to keep his expression in good order. Harry didn't need it spelled out, just exactly how foul it had been for him, living life with a Potter-sized hole in it. And he quite clearly wasn't in the mood for a real heart-to-heart between old mates at the moment, rushed as he obviously was with all the work piled about his posh new office in Mysteries.
“Yes,” Theo added. “It’s an excuse for you to ogle Potter. Why didn’t you say so, Malfoy? I’d’ve brought Zabini along for reinforcements.”
“A year,” Draco stated firmly, having thought it through thoroughly, well before his happy shaggers had even taken up residence. “Not less than, surely. That’s quite powerful Magic affecting mine, and it needs be appeased by some quite heavy-duty acts of fertility. If we're not there to do it, then it’s still got to be accomplished in some fashion, and regularly."
As to that: a fortune had been spent to make it so very…pristine—this, Draco knew from his Goblin accountant. Father 's rapacious claws had been barely kept out Draco's Trust Fund he'd been left by dear old Grandfather Abraxas. What with all the Galleons Lucius had determinedly doled out in the effort to eradicate all traces of both the Dark Lord and the Aurors from his ancestral pile, it had better damned well better be a bloody National Wizarding Trust Gold Seal Residence. Father would not, it seemed, put up with even the tiniest of besmirchments upon either his person, his Heir,
“Look," Draco gulped hard, brows set in a determined line across his forehead. "Just look how much happier you’ve been since we’ve started sharing this flat! You needed a real friend, not a bloody jumped-up housekeep!” He flung out a helpless sort of hand gesture, reeling with unspeakable fustratration and angry, so angry at this bloody emotional Bludger his best mate was hurling at him--and fresh-dipped in a pain, a very strange and inexplicable agony. How could Harry not realize?
--and they should know, really--that Wizarding homes are remarkably opinionated concerning what’s best for their chosen Wizards and Witches. They say that, Draco knew, and he certainly wasn’t about to argue because there was certainly a markedly different atmosphere hanging about his Manor, these days.
"On the count of three, then," Draco mumbled, a fingertip still soothing down an errant curl to the brightly shaded ribbon. He'd not touched Harry's gift beyond that, as if it were something terribly dangerous—a magical cabinet he'd no interest in opening. "Alright?"
When had his name ever contained that particular degree of buried, layered, burbling-over the brim meaning? Harry wondered, in the split-second before he gave up on such mundane acts as thinking in favour of only feeling. When had he ever felt he'd just been helplessly captivated by a more powerful source of magic than even his own—and then loved it? Wanted it to continue so much so he could taste his own desire pooling in the back of his throat, in the crevasses between gums and molars; was willing to beg to have it consume him?
This Draco could not ignore. It was true. He'd allowed it, much to his regret. Besides, it was becoming clear he might be in need of their assistance. If only to understand Harry. The parts that always confused him, which he never quite got right. He was oddly certain that if he could just get a handle, he could woo Harry back.
"How much will it set me back, Mr. Pucker?" Draco interrupted. "Not that the Galleons are at all important—but, can you have it ready by Beltane?"
"Ohgods!" Harry swore, as Malfoy ran a hand down his sternum and his robes and the shirt beneath fell open. "Please!" he said again, and clutched at Malfoy's wide shoulders. "I want—ca-can we?"
"Huh." Draco made a nasal noise of disbelief. "You'll manage not to do it, Potter. Don't forget I know you very well; always skiving off when it comes to commitment. I don't trust you."
Draco looked to Potter's expression to see if it was alright, but Harry's eyes were shut so tight his dark brows were wrinkled, the lashes damp, and he was wincing and biting his lower lip nearly through.
"You will, won't you?" The pleading edge to his voice—so unfamiliar and wrong—was long gone, replaced a very determined steely glint. Give a Malfoy a scant inch to run with and they'd parlay it into a lifetime. "After we matriculate, Harry, naturally. Mum will organize it for us, you know. In fact, I don't think I can stop her. She adores events such as weddings. Really, it's her forte."
"What did you mean, 'start right now', Draco?" Weasley asked. "Did you have something in mind for tonight? 'Cause if you do, I'll bloody well snog your feet out of gratitude, mate."
Harry, scowling and shifting about uncomfortably in an effort to avoid her knowing smile, whacked his head on a flat stone hidden under the wool. Naturally and of course, but that was exactly in line with all the other irksome, painful little mini-crises that had occurred to him ever since he'd realized Malfoy was the direct cause for his raving case of the 'hots'. He'd entered a whole new realm of accident-prone since that fateful moment. Afflicted with Malfoy-itis, he was nothing more than a walking disaster zone.
"Hah!" Ron snorted. "As if anything's actually private, here. Look, Harry, Malfoy—we need you over there at the frigging Council of War the girls have going. Nev's inching his way towards being willing, sort of. I think Pansy's managed to convince him. Or maybe it's Luna—you know how she is. You agree 'cause you can't remember what the question was."
"But I might've guessed." Draco shrugged slightly, his hand sliding to Harry's nape. "If I'd thought."
"Er?" Harry asked the empty room. The fire crackled. "Oh! Oh, fuck! That sod—that git! What is he thinking?"
“Oh—er, Malfoy…um, what?” Potter did pause in his determined trot out of DADA, though, and that was the important thing. Better yet, his execrable choice of companions had preceded them, swept away by the rush to luncheon, and it was too late for Potter to call them back to his side. “Yes?”
"Are you baffled, Potter?" Malfoy's voice—another one of Harry's inner pitfalls of want-need-lust—sounded quite close to his one ear. "We don't want that, do we?" Git had dropped down his knees when Harry wasn't noticing and was sharing a good half of Harry's rug, arse situated not a hand's-breadth away from the fist harry leant upon for balance; a bony hip budging his familiarly and knuckled hands planted on either side of Harry's half-raised shoulders. He was effectively trapped. "Don't be. This is pretty easy to follow, what happens next."
and that even the two strongest, most powerful of Wizards of their generation had little to no chance of halting it, of subverting its will. Some might, indeed, say that. And some might be bloody doubting wankers, too.
"Dear…" Draco's Mum interjected, with a winsome smile and a cautioning Look send Draco's direction. "Don't you think—? Perhaps a tonic might be just the thing-"
“I’ll fucking skin you, Potter, if you do,” hissed Malfoy, and all at once he was quite, quite terrifyingly serious. “Don’t even consider it. You’ll find yourself hexed so hard you’ll not know your arse from a sodding hole in the ground!
“And you know that’s a regular school broom he’s flying today? Not that good, really. Shame. Miss that Firebolt he had. Even the Nimbus. Pity.”
Till the sounds of groaning and moaning, the small incoherent noises of shock and pleasure and amazement—
“Oh—my—gods, Malfoy!” Harry burst out. He glared at the wickedly grinning face  bobbing before his narrowed eyes. “You huge prick! You annoying twink! I can’t believe you’re wasting time over teasing me! Now—get on with it, git, or I’ll cut you off!”
"I'll--I'll--I'll KILL HIM!" Lucius ordered, in a tinny little roar, but clearly enunciated. "I will!  For daring—to shame you—with this rigmarole over your Bonding! Bonds are sacred--Bonds are sacrosanct! Bonds are not the purview of rude little Gryffindor upstarts!
“Right, right. But Potter?” Shaking his head as if to clear it of distraction, Draco impatiently threw down his battered quill a second time. “You’ve
"D'you—will you—please?" he gibbered, wrapping all his limbs about Harry in an effort to keep to the subject at hand. "With—always—me?"
“Oh, Merlin!” Harry panted, caught up in see-saw sliding. His arse felt so amazingly brilliant, it should be a sin. “Oh—oh—
Quidditch fan could inform them history had been made this afternoon—that last and decisive chase after the Snitch of Potter’s was one for the record books!
“Erm…sure, Harry,” Hermione smiled feebly, reluctantly nodding. Her toast—whole wheat, buttered, gooseberry jam-spread—seemed to be disagreeing with her.
Draco grabbed at him, pressed them closer, all the way down, from foreheads to chins and lips to shins and hips and shoetips. "
friends would've taken the hint directly after lunch. So you'd best get used to it, Potter; I'm about to get much pushier yet."
Stay, Harry repeated, and maybe-could be it was not a soundless whisper or the waft of passing lips over flesh this time.
"Surely. No fear,” Draco croaked, when he'd managed to catch his breath. Only a tad ironically, too. "Er, ah. Help yourself, I s'pose."
"S’alright w’me," he allowed, letting the dregs of the night's tension slip away. "Wha’ever. Just...you know. Sleep, now. No more talking.”
If he was going to blubber--and that unholy prickle at the back of his eyes and the stifling feeling in his throat surely besaged it--he’d much rather do it alone, by himself.
“Shut it, mate,” Harry informed Ron sternly, interrupting a heated exchange between Ron and Seamus and not caring. “It was your doing; don’t deny it.”
Flailing, scrabbling to manage a better grip, to lay himself wide, he sought only to imprint himself permanently on those especial bones, that specific skin, that extraordinarily private blend of lingering lime-sandalwood scent. He'd strive to become a part of it—he'd be stuck to Draco Malfoy on a forever basis.
They began walking ever faster as the hallway twisted itself FunHouse-wise all about them, projecting scenes of the stylized Nursery Life of circa Merlin knew how many eras, all flashing by eerily as visual spectres, emblazoned as brilliant murals on the now cream-plastered walls.  The runner ended abruptly and the parquet segued smoothly into a glossy milk-white marble tile, the Persian lamps replaced with Classical sconces. The walls switched up again and suddenly sprouted tapestries, featuring all manner of fantastical fish, animals and birds cavorting about freely with a never-ending stream of elegantly clad children.
Harry glanced up quickly at Draco for confirmation but his companion was preoccupied with staring at the man standing before them, all decked out in dark violet robes practically sprouting outsize stars and indecent amounts of spangles and cheerfully running his gnarled fingers through his excessively long silver-grey beard.
Harry heard the bitterness, though he wasn't sure why Draco might feel that way. The dregs of the cup taste that no amount of sugared whip or icing on cakes could quite disguise. He gulped hard against it—it sent a funny shimmy through his stomach; not pleasant—and his eyes fell again to his gift.
“Uh-huh," Malfoy scoffed, dropping his lips to Harry's nape and mouthing it hotly. He shrugged, sending a shiver all up Harry's bare back. "Sure, Potter. You won’t and you know you won't and besides, I’ll always be older than you, young Hawwy Potty. You’ll never attain my advanced wisdom nor my great years, you know? So, eat it and weep, my vertically-challenged wisp of a Wizardling; you’ll never beat me! Not a sodding chance of it.”
Pansy and Nott exchanged a quick, meaningful glance, all the while edging their respective bums away an infinitesimal distance on the reserved bench they all shared.
Draco tilted his chin impudently, rudely rocked his chair back on its hindlegs and made no move to leap into mollifying action.
But it hadn't stopped with simple alleyway hand jobs, nor more progressive bar room loo blowjobs, nor even full-on anal penetration up against the rear door of the Gagging Stoat, one of Edinburgh's seamier Wizarding pubs. Oh, no. Draco—being Draco—had to take it all one step further. Prat was on the looksee for every antique sex magic position he could winkle out of the Restricted Section—and with the clear intent of trying them out on
But Potter was in action again, seizing Draco's wrist and dragging him straight to one of the maroon upholstered armchairs stationed before his desk.
He thinks instantly of Draco as he gazes up and up. Draco, who would be ecstatic to be here, where Harry was, standing beneath it and marvelling. No doubt that intriguing mouth would be chattering away of this and of that arcane astronomical aspect, those hands moving swift as swallows in flight, darting to point out this or that constellation. Or p’raps he’d be dead silent instead, biting at his full lower lip contemplatively, pointy chin cocked at an elegant angle and neck craned, taking it all in with a deep and grave attention.
Draco looked up, wondering where it might have been destined to go, when he happened to notice Dumbledore going very pale. The other judges seemed to share this sentiment as they all began arguing amongst themselves.
Automatically he secured the walls in his mind, as he had been conditioned to do. They were strong and they would not break.
Once- and only once- some second years had tried to sit in their spot, only to be subjected to Pansy’s wrath. It had been an amusing sight, albeit, not for the second years. Draco glanced at her as she unpacked her bag, laughing at a joke Theo had made.
“Hi, my name’s Bethany.” Draco took the offered hand, amused “I’m Draco” The small smile Bethany gave him was one of shyness and of innocence. Draco felt a pang of longing for the time when he had been- well not shy, but certainly innocent.
So this was on the back burner for a bit, I've still been writing, but it's far more fun to write new content then revise old, PluS- I kept missing my upload time and would just be like yeah I'll upload tomorrow but it never happened :((
His Mother nodded. “Very well. I believe you.” Draco knew she was just trying to end the conversation. He closed his eyes, fighting tears as she reached out and touched his shoulder.
Draco had to check these letters, because, upon his father's incarceration, he was now the head of house.
“Yes, I do quite agree, and I hope you can make the difference that all of us students here truly need.” He said, smiling back. He glanced at the clock on the wall. Breakfast had finished, the other students would be here soon.
“I know that you are preparing to fight.” Draco began to feel nauseous as his heart struggled to leave the confines of his chest. Voldemort was
He could see the appeal that was there for other guys- the good bone structure, perfect skin, the wicked smile and playful eyes she taunted you with...but- Draco had never felt anything other than a brotherly love for the girl, and he had come to realise that he never would.
They had followed all the students up to the entrance to the new exit, and Draco told Crabbe and Goyle that Potter was "just up ahead" the whole time.
“Copied it with a duplication charm. Filch didn’t even try to stop me- he's too scared of me.” She turned and grinned at him. She sounded proud.
He sat down between her and Theo, and reached for an apple. That would be all he could stomach this morning.
He felt a low sort of amusement from Voldemort, and while he was distracted, Draco nervously brought the memory of the dream Voldemort had invaded forth, which Draco had very carefully edited.

He searched the luggage rack above him, glad to he could do it easily as his head was in Pansy’s lap, but he could find no sign of Potter.
He set off, feeling troubled, yet freer then he had for the first time in months. It was one of those days in autumn when it had been cold in the morning but was stiflingly warm in the sun now that it was midday. Draco stripped off his robes and sweater, draping them over his arm. He had a whole hour until Ancient Runes and decided to walk slowly.
He had swallowed and assumed the role of the faithful death eater. Determined to somehow stop them without openly giving away his position. He gripped his mother's wand in his sweaty hand, and struggled to control the shaking.
“A vanishing cabinet-” Came Borgin’s voice from behind him. “Rare things, but the ones that do exist were used extensively in the war...Unfortunately, I’ve never been able to locate the sister cabinet of-”
If she found Draco, she might need a wand if they were to escape. She edged closer and closer. But she froze as a voice rang out.
Draco felt sick. Not just in his stomach, but in his entire body. His legs and arms were weak, sweating. His mouth was dry and his eyes could not seem to focus-- neither could his head, it jumped from one incomplete fear to the next and each thought made him feel sicker. He was lost for words for a long time. His Mother became silent as well.
Umbridge paused, eyes flicking to Blaise, seeing him for the first time again, as she considered them both.
That's important... “ he trailed off, a picture of beauty and peace. Then, as the rest of the world faded away, Harry raised his wand. In a grand, yet still relatively quiet voice, he commanded- “
Draco's heart swelled as he spotted him- Messy hair and messy clothes- looking very out of his element as every pair of eyes in the room turned to look at him. It was almost laughable. How could Potter still not be accustomed to people looking at him?
Crabbe didn’t notice the poor attempts at distraction. “We’re gonna be rewarded,” he took a deep breath in, looking ecstatic. “We hung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to ’im.”
Draco had experienced the flight or fight sensation before, but he experienced it in a new way as the hopelessness of the situation overwhelmed him to. He was wandless, and running from a curse that made him feel completely insignificant. His feet pelted underneath him and Goyle’s dead weight made his back hurt.
He suddenly felt the need to talk, to get stuff off his chest, which he had been wanting to for the last month- exemplify.
wasn't the background music his audience had been listening to, and it demanded attention. It was intense, expressive and complicated. One by one those in the room turned to watch him. But Draco didn’t see this, he played the song without thinking, allowing the weeks of constant practice to take hold of him. His fingers whirled across the keys and the notes blended and danced in the air in response. It was beautiful, and the audience knew it.
Blaise looked at him for a moment, then gave in “So we are using you showing me around as an excuse to butter up Umbridge?”
Draco laughed as they took off, the air beneath them and the sky theirs to claim. It was a good afternoon, and they both forgot most of their worries.
Snape stopped speaking, and a very concerned look came onto his face. After a period of silence, he spoke.“I assume we are talking about the Dark Lord?”
Pansy agreed, and soon their conversation was all about the coming year. He felt the anger slowly subside, he breathed deeply, thankful he hadn’t exploded at her.
Everybody but Draco laughed and Potters head snapped up. Immediately his eyes looked to Draco, who wasn’t laughing while the others were. Draco knew Potter thought he had told a joke about him. Draco inwardly groaned before he realised that this is what he promised himself he would do. He
As he slowly descended the stairs, his head pounding, he was relieved to find a cup of tea waiting for him at the bottom of the stairs. He smiled thankfully at Pansy as he took the warm drink from her hands.
home yesterday. And she ended up staying.” He looked around and swayed a little. “I only arrived in Hogsmeade about 20 minutes ago, via the knight bus. But I did manage to steal this from him.” Theo opened his jacket to reveal a flask sitting in his coat pocket, presumably filled with firewhiskey. “It was my present from him to me. Since he couldn’t be fucked to get me one I actually gave a shit about.”
“What are you doing?!” Blaise held up his bleeding hands for inspection. “We have to get you to the hospital ward.” Concern filled his eyes.
He pulled back in as the team begun some drills. Crabbe and Goyle were happy to get the beater positions and boosted Draco’s good mood as the afternoon progressed.
“Do you want your wand back? I’m working out. Uh- Exercising. It keeps my head in order.” The words tumbled from his mouth in a feeble attempt to fill in the awkwardness in the air. He swiped at the sweat dripping down his forehead as he said it.
Draco let the anger and jealousy consume him, tired of trying to always suppress and control it, tired of the yearning which lurked underneath, a yearning which could never be realised. He let it burn through him, and was so caught in the high of the emotion, of the pain which was being crushed by the pure anger- that he almost didn’t feel it...
yesterday.” He lied, stopping her from dismissing him. He could actually see the words stop in her throat as she forced out the word- “Oh?”
In no time he was sitting down on the uncomfortable piano stool ready to begin. He opened the book, only to be surprised to find the loose pages of a song that had not been there before. With it came a note.
Two minutes later he found himself bursting into the gloomy office. The only change to the space was a few Christmas cards on Snape’s desk. He knew they would be from Dumbledore and the other teachers who got offended at Snape's lack of decorations each year.
“Pansy, I won’t tell you again. I’m not going to keep you all from your family, who would kill me if they didn’t get to see you guys.
, little team. Let's call it… the Inquisitorial squad! How does that sound?” Draco was vaguely reminded of a hound attempting to smile by the look she gave him.
Draco smirked 'I seem to have touched a nerve,” He had indeed “Well, just watch yourself, Potter, because I'll be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line.” Potter nearly turned white.
towards him. It took effort, but he managed to use reducto to shrink the massive darkness into a quaffle sized ball, which pulsated in and out of itself.
“So” said Crabbe, not bothering with the pleasantries, “Pansy told us about what she heard. That Potter might be coming. What’s happening?”
Crabbe wheeled around and desperately shot another killing curse at Weasley, who dived out of the way. While they did that, Granger finally took out Goyle, with her third well-aimed stunner.
he found the release that his wand could provide. He screamed one final time as he forced it from his mind and out of his wand, making it explode into his childhood bedroom.
He spent the rest of the time walking, and taking in the environment surrounding him, noticing how at peace he felt walking among nature. The lake, forest, mountains and sky all seemed bigger than him and somehow that made him and his problems seem small. Their pristine qualities seemed to help cleanse his tight lungs and calm his ever-busy brain. Eventually, he finished the circuit and regretfully returned to reality. He walked back to the castle, wanting to drag his feet like a child.
“Draco, she’s a teacher. No- she’s a high inquisitor, what of you had gone too far and fucked it up for yourself and the rest of the us?”
His father slapped him. Shocking him into silence. “Quiet boy!”  It hurt, but Draco was more focused on the panic spreading through his entire body “Swear to me-” His father's eyes had suddenly become very still. “Swear to me- that you shall never do that again. That you shall
“I swear, Mother, I was just lonely, and needed somebody- and she was glad for the food and shower I could give her.”
“I’m so sorry” She was holding him and sobbing. They stayed there for a while- wrapped in each other's arms for the second time that day, sickened and shocked by what they had been through.
After clearing a spot on the dirty ground, he sat down and upon doing so realised how exhausted he was. His whole body ached from burns, scrapes and a constant headache. Running for his life for the last hour or two had distracted him, but now the fatigue from such an extreme emotion threatened to overwhelm him. Despite some part of him knowing he should stay alert, he just wanted to lay down.
Draco turned his back on Fleur, frowning across at the alarmed students. Of the large group only two seemed to be unaffected by his use of the taboo name; a girl with bushy brown hair who was sat on one of the long benches, a book open on her lap, and the boy who had caught his attention when they'd been presented to the students of Hogwarts, the one with piercing green eyes and ink black hair which was unfortunately even messier than before.
“Seriously, Claude?” Draco huffed, glaring over his shoulder at the still sleeping couple who had responded to his movement by wrapping themselves tightly together. How Javier didn’t get woken up by his lovers constant moving Draco didn’t know. “I’m going back to sleep…”
“Yes,” Hermione answered, flicking through the pages of her book far too quickly to actually be reading them. She was probably looking for her place, he realised, remembering the fact that she didn't like to use bookmarks in case they damaged the pages and that she considered dog-earring pages to be a crime. “And it's got a horrible reputation. According to ‘
’ thing and it was just as disconcerting from them as it was from the two redheads who had jumped up to stand on the bench, shaking the potion vials so vigorously that Draco feared for the potion held within them.
It was reassuring that nothing out of the ordinary happened for the remainder of the journey, unlike last year when the Dementors had attacked, and that the most exciting moment had been when Seamus, Dean and Neville had tumbled into their compartment sparking a rather heated debate about the match between Ireland and Bulgaria. Neville hadn't been able to convince his grandmother to get them tickets so he was more than eager to listen to every single detail as told by the people who had actually been there.
“Whilst other members of my family believed that the Dark Lord was merely in hiding my parents chose to believe the theory that the curse had backfired somehow,” he explained, his eyes following the strings of fairy lights hanging around the room as he spoke, the lights dimmed in response to the late hour thanks to the spell Ramona had cast on them when she’d put them up. “They believed it so strongly that they were willing to risk their lives in order to keep me safe, to give me a chance at a normal life away from the darkness that had tainted our family. Honestly, I dread to think what I would’ve turned out like if they hadn’t.”
The worst thing about his new dreams, the ones about the Beauxbatons student, was that he didn't even know the boy’s name and there was no way for him to find it out without asking either him or one of his friends and that…that simply wasn't possible. They were all seventeen, at least, making them Seventh Years whilst he, despite being the ‘
“Thank you!” the first twin cried out in response to the crowd who had responding to their cheering with cries of their own, moving out of the way so that they could move to the centre of the group. “Thank you. Well lads, we've done it. Brewed it up this morning.”
is about to start. I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket just to clarify the procedure which we will be following this year.” He paused, gesturing towards the doors which opened to admit two smartly dressed men only one of whom Draco recognised as a former Quidditch Beater. “But firstly, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of International Magical Co-operation and Mr Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.”
“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and – most particularly – guests,” Dumbledore called out, offering the sea of faces a smile. “I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to
“What's that he's drinking, do you suppose?” Seamus, their Irish friend, supposed loudly as they all watched Moody take a long drink from a strange looking hip-flask. He was Dean’s best friend and prone to mischief, almost as much as the Weasley twins although he was not nearly so inventive about it. He was also something of a snob and rather filthy minded.
“You were never my favourite, Claude,” Ramona snorted, to which he pretended to have been shot in the heart, gasping dramatically. Javier snorted, throwing a handful of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans at his boyfriend who proceeded to catch three of them in his mouth, celebrating accordingly. “And I would have given you fairy lights had you not ended up sharing a room with Gerard Argent, Mr
“But Bagman wanted to tell us what's happening at Hogwarts, remember?” the most volatile of the three of them huffed as he dropped down onto the other bench seat. Harry, as the last in, turned around on the spot and began struggling to pull the stiff sliding door closed. “At the World Cup, remember? But my own mother won't say. Wonder what – ”
Madame Maxine had made it perfectly clear during the welcoming banquet that she expected every student who met the various requirements set down in the amended rules of the historical contest to put their name down for “consideration” by the end of the week.
“Very well,” Snape snapped, crumpling the parchment in his hand as he turned to Harry. “Potter, leave your things here; I want you back down here later to test your antidote.”
Desiree had obviously spent more time on her hair, pinned in an artful bun high up on the back of her head than on her dress, the lacing not quite as tight or as perfect as Odette’s.
He turned around, his eyes seeking out the pin attached to the other boy’s uniform; judging by the fact that Javier’s badge was a deep blue colour with a dozen silver stars surrounding a crescent moon Harry felt secure in assuming that they weren’t in the same house at school.
As per usual the Entrance Hall was a hive of activity as students began queuing outside the decorative doors which would eventually admit them into the Great Hall where the delicious smells of dinner were emanating from. It didn’t take long for Ron to grumble about the wait, claiming that his stomach was eating itself, and Harry was just about to beg his friend to shut up when a piercing voice cut through the general hubbub of the large crowd,
“If you wanted to try and set me up with him I wouldn’t mind,” she admitted softly as they watched the famous teenager walk up to the
It was just then, as they were being ushered towards the seats which had been made available to them at the end of one of the tables, that Draco felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickle, warning him that someone was paying particularly close attention to him.
Harry reached across to pat his friends hand reassuringly after hearing her gasp loudly in shock but he kept the majority of his attention on what Professor Dumbledore was saying.
“Seriously?” she grumbled, reaching out to flick the back of his neck. He flinched away from her, his hand shooting across to jab a finger into her side in retaliation which caused her to let out a sharp yelp. Ramona was very ticklish. “
a shade of blue. His shoes, of course, were black and every article of clothing which made up his uniform had the schools coat of arms embroidered on it somewhere or other; for their blazers it was located on the left breast pocket, for their shirts (or blouses in the girls case) it was in the same sort of location on the smooth fabric, for their trousers or skirts it was actually located on the belt buckle which came with them and on their robes it was also high on the left breast but hidden from view underneath the stylish cape which barely grazed their elbows.
Professor Binns continued, the historical inflections and spelling making it even more challenging for the students to focus on what was being said. His monotonous voice was a sedative at the best of times.
,” Granger sighed, closing her book with a distinctive thud. “A genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something as pathetically dim-witted as an ageing potion.”
“There are those who’ll turn even the most innocent of occasions to their advantage,” Moody announced, almost completely drowning out the end of Cedric’s statement. “It’s my job to think the way dark witches and wizards do, Karkaroff, as you ought to remember…”
on it such as the one which Ramona now wore. As it was the pin he had been given during the final welcoming feast he would ever experience at the school was slightly larger than either of his previous pins and was clearly marked with the words
“Well, you look a little bit more alive than the last time I saw you,” Draco murmured as his friends joined him just before a house elf appeared to lead them inside the building. Claude grimaced, rubbing gently at his stomach. “Good luck if any of your classes are up there…”
A little way down the table the twins waved at him and a little further along from that Ginny offered him a smile that was filled with hero worship, giggling with her fellow Third Years.
” Claude gasped, clutching at his boyfriends arm as his body was wracked with uncontrollable laughter. Javier wasn’t much better, chuckling to himself. “
after all even if it had meant being alone for their final year of school. His stomach suddenly felt like it was full of lead, clenching unpleasantly at the very thought that his name could be the one to be chosen, his skin becoming clammy as he imagine the amount of attention he would receive. But it was too late to do anything about it now; his name had been entered into the
Another sigh, this one of defeated frustration, escaped Harry as allowed his head to fall back, leaving him gazing up at the intricate moulding of the ceiling high above them for a long moment before he closed his eyes, took a deep breath and returned to facing them.
Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into rather ugly tears, their caterwauling reminding Harry his Aunt Petunia when she pretended to be upset about something in order to convince her husband to see things her way, and were sobbing with their heads on their arms. One of the boys was shaking his head in such a way that it was obvious he had no idea he was performing such an obvious display of disapproval whilst another had slammed his clenched fist down onto the tabletop with enough for to make the poor Ravenclaw girl sitting to his left jump almost out of her seat. Finally there was one particular girl, sitting with the two crying their eyes out, who had the expression of someone who’d inadvertently swallowed a particularly sharp piece of lemon and couldn’t spit it out.
“Just think of all the positive outcomes that could happen because of this,” Ramona tacked on eagerly, leaning against Draco's side in such a way that he was forced to lean against Javier's free side turning his bed into one big snuggle fest. “You're the only one of us to have ever been to England and you don't even remember it. None of us have seen any magical school but our own. Plus one of us could be selected as the Beauxbatons champion…”
students helped themselves to steaming mugs of coffee, a variety of porridges to which some of them added jam and/or cream or to a towering plate of what appeared to Harry to be doorstop sandwiches whilst at the Ravenclaw table the
Washing himself off as quickly as possible, a habit born from the fact that his Aunt Petunia timed how much hot water he used up which he still couldn't break even though he knew Hogwarts could never run out of hot water due to the fact that it was all done by magic, he used one of the fluffy towels provided to dry himself off, pulled on his pyjamas and returned to his dormitory to get himself ready for the day. Despite the fact that it was nearly an hour before his usual wake-up time he knew better than to try and go back to sleep, knowing that he'd slip into a deep enough sleep that he would then oversleep and miss out on breakfast.
interested in Draco before she’d finally gone too far and been arrested. Apolline had been almost as bad before she married and had a child of her own, a daughter she’d named Fleur after her husband’s grandmother. “I had no idea she would react as violently as she did but I’ll be all right. I’ll be better once we’ve settled into our new home and can begin our new lives together.”
as she referred to them) were quite possibly the only people in the entire school that she couldn't stand.

,” Moody explained. “I’m guessing they submitted Potter’s name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category.”
“Well…” Dumbledore sighed as Harry came to stand directly in front of the headmaster, his face devoid of his usual smile. In fact, Harry thought he looked pained. “Through the door.”
with the troll in the girl’s bathroom. Ever since then the three of them had been nigh on inseparable and both his and Ron's grades had benefited from the unexpected friendship, the female member of their trio a literal sponge for knowledge. There was a reason so many of the teachers referred to her as “
“…or it might have Muggle-Repelling Charms on it, like the World Cup Stadium,” Hermione was explaining matter-of-factly when he tuned back into the conversation. “And to keep foreign witches and wizards from finding it they'll have made it Unplottable – ”
Continuing to chuckle to himself Draco hung his towel up on the hook provided, kicked off his awful footwear and turned on the shower to get the water heating up. Whilst he waited for it to reach the temperature he personally preferred he unpacked his wash bag, placing everything with easy reach of the stream of steaming water; shampoo, conditioner, body wash, a natural sea sponge and a body moisturiser designed to be applied in the shower.
“Slave labour,” she had announced, her voice thick with disgust as she pushed her almost full plate away from her, breathing heavily. “That's what made this dinner.
In the dream he'd been kissed by not only Charlie but the Sheriff of Nottingham and, whilst the latter had been very unpleasant and had prompted him to fight back until he could escape his evil clutches, kissing Charlie, a boy…no, a man...had been…nice…really nice…which was so completely unexpected that it took him a good few minutes to realise that a certain part of his anatomy was significantly more awake than the rest of him.
Thierry’s voice came from immediately behind him and Draco had no sooner stepped to the side when the other boy hurried past, his expression pained as he dove into a cubicle.
“May I introduce our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,” Dumbledore announced as the man in question limped over to the empty seat left for him. “Professor Moody.”
Around him his fellow students shifted to stare at him, some sneering whilst others gazed at him in awe. Only Ron turned away, staring up at the ceiling as his cheeks flushed a deep red.
Harry’s mouth dropped out in shock as the ferret was unceremoniously deposited down the front of Vincent Crabbe’s trousers, the creature struggling to grip onto the boy’s belt in an attempt to stop itself vanishing from sight. It was no good and into the piece of clothing it went, followed quickly by Gregory Goyle’s hand as the taller boy attempted to rescue Fleur.
“Finally I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this Tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the Tournament through to the end,” Dumbledore’s tone turned graver as he gazed out at the excited faces, pressing his point home as clearly as he could. “The placing of your name in the Goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are whole-heartedly prepared to play, before you drop your name into the Goblet.”
It all stemmed from the fact that both Yvette and Odette had had designs on Draco at one point or another and had seen his close friendship with Ramona as an obstacle to be overcome, neither of them willing to accept the fact that he was completely gay. They had made it very clear that they believed the
?” Narcissa cried out dramatically, reaching down to straighten the blue jacket the much loved stuffed toy wore. It had been a gift from Andromeda, a representation of the main character of one of Draco’s favourite story books by the muggle author, Beatrix Potter. “Whatever would have happened to
“Yes,” she responded, speaking firmly but kindly as she had treated all of the house elves she had become mistress of in her own house following her marriage. “Please see to it that all of my belongings which remain in this house are sent to Malfoy Manor at once.”
“If it had to be anyone I’m glad it’s you, Draco,” Ramona, the owner of the squeal, gushed once they had calmed down enough to release him although she herself tucked her arm through his as the group of friends instinctively moved to follow their Headmistress. He smiled tightly at her, not entirely pleased with being chosen yet. “I mean, of course we all wanted to be chosen ourselves but as that wasn’t to be I’m glad it’s you. We all are, right?”
“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled the now familiar voice of Professor Moody as the older man limped into the room, his metal leg thinking loudly with each step. Out of the corner of his eye Harry registered Draco taking a seemingly involuntary step backwards in response to the teachers sudden appearance, his right hand moving to take hold of his wand where it was tucked into the inside pocket of his smart jacket. His expression was one of concern, of wariness. That was odd… “Your champion can’t go anywhere. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Bit convenient, eh?”
Madame Maxime's voice echoed through the carriage once more just as Draco had finished fussing with the angle of his beret, grumbling the whole time as he struggled to make it look alright.
“And with...” he paused, glancing across at the clock mounted on the wall beside the window in order to find out what the time was. “…forty-five minutes to go until we land.”
Colin's brother was easy to spot amongst the group, his face dominated by a beaming smile whilst all of the others looked understandably nervous. And cold, they all looked very, very cold. They were all soaked but none more so than Colin's brother who had been given what appeared to be Hagrid’s coat to wear over his completely soaked uniform and black robes.
“It’s ok, you know? You can tell me the truth. If you don’t want everyone else to know, fine, but I don’t know why you’re bothering to lie. It’s not like you got into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady’s, Violet, she’s already told us all that they’re letting you enter.”
Ron and Hermione had been forced into a similar position as Harry and Ginny and seemed equally as embarrassed about it, springing apart and eagerly hurrying along the corridor. Poor Ginny was left standing alone for a long moment as Harry hurried after his friends before the infatuated third year let out a deep sigh and set off to find her own friends.
Draco and the others followed at a more sedate pace; heads held high, shoulders back and polite smiles on their faces. Nothing too big or showy, such a display would be considered
She could already imagine how her parents were going to take this decision of theirs which was why her husband and son had already begun closing up Malfoy Manor, five-year-old Draco “helping” as best he could, and would meet her at the international apparation point in a couple of hours time after she had concluded her business with her family. It wasn’t going to be a pleasant meeting. She could remember how her parents, especially her mother, had reacted when Andromeda had admitted she was pregnant out of wedlock and that the father of her child had been a muggle she’d met on a night out in muggle London.
After sharing a look the twins moved to sit on either side of the girl, leaning in far too close for them to be anything less than good friends. Had they merely been school acquaintances Draco got the feeling that the bushy haired witch would have had no trouble removing them from her personal space. As it was she merely offered them both a truly unimpressed look.
Rolling over, uncaring of the fact that his movements jostled the sleeping couple he had previously been turned towards, he smirked at Ramona who had half of his bed to herself whilst the other three were squashed together on the other half. It always ended up that way whenever the four of them would talk so late into the night that they just fell asleep together despite the fact that it would have made sense to give Claude the most room.
“That's because you spend all your free time designing fabulous interiors and redecorating any room you can get your hands on,” he pointed out, dropping down beside her so that they ended up lying side by side, their heads together on his pillow. “You can build a career on that. I can hardly build a career on reading novels and short stories, well, unless I become an editor or a…a reviewer, neither of which hold much appeal if I'm completely honest.”
A quick glance towards the Slytherin table as they entered the Great Hall unfortunately proved otherwise, the glamorous fourteen year old checking her makeup on a compact mirror. It didn't look like she'd gotten wet at all, not even when she was outside in the rain.
It had been frightening the first time he'd orgasmed, a word he had only learned during the “talk” much to his embarrassment, but by the second and third time he could understand why people always seemed to make such a big deal about it. It felt amazing, like flying…
“We must follow the rules,” Mr Crouch announced calmly from where he stood apart from the group, his face half concealed in shadow. “And the rules clearly state that those people whose names come out of the
It seemed, if only for a brief moment, that their potion might have done the trick and their celebrations resumed. Draco was unsurprised, however, when the atmosphere changed.
A good third of the room’s occupants visibly swooned as a storm of applause and cheering swept through the Great Hall. They watched as Viktor Krum, his normally apathetic expression replaced with a confident smile, rose from his seat at the Slytherin table amidst his friends congratulations and made his way up towards Dumbledore. Nodding to all three of the Headteachers he followed the instruction the Hogwarts Headmaster had given, turning right and walking along the staff table before disappearing through the open door.
No, this couldn’t be a student prank, he reasoned with himself as he fought to hold back his tears. Even for a Slytherin this was too much, too dangerous. Professor Moody was right.
“Well, the Goblet is almost ready to make its decision,” Professor Dumbledore announced after taking a moment to assess the blue flame flickering within the Goblet. Beside him Madame Maxime smiled, nodding in agreement, and Headmaster Karkaroff fixed his cold gaze upon his students waiting in silence. “I estimate that it requires one more minute.”
“I believe they only have two houses,” Javier answered, twisting around in his seat to look across at the Durmstrang students who were sat at the Slytherin table. “North and South.”

was well-known for being something of a progressive community, forward thinking and very welcoming. Of the people they’d been in contact to regarding the house sale and getting the place ready for them they had had no trouble at all, not even when their wartime affiliations had come up.
. Not that he’d ever admit it out loud but Draco felt his heart give an embarrassing lurch as he gazed upon the handsome wizard, nowhere near immune to the effect that his stoic expression and muscular figure had on them all.
Draco’s eyes flew open as he climaxed with a shocked grunt, only just catching himself in time to stop a loud cry bursting forth from his mouth and revealing what he had been doing.
“Yes, we could have,” Ramona agreed, reaching over to flick the back of Claude's ear for no other reason than she could. “However, we all agreed that your penmanship is far superior to our and, given the importance of these slips of parchment, only the very best will do.”
“Potter?” Cedric frowned when he realised who had joined them, stepping slightly away from the fireplace as he turned to face the younger boy. Krum’s frown was even more prominent as he too turned to face the newest arrival. Draco, on the other hand, kept his face almost completely expressionless with only a hint of a frown. “Is something wrong?”
“Be grateful there's only the three of you in there,” Ramona muttered from where she was fighting to get a emerald drape to hang just right above the door. “I can tell you now that there aren't enough extension charms in the world to make it comfortable for four teenage girls to share a room. We're already getting in each other's way and it's only day one...”
staff and students faces that it was a rarity for Dumbledore to raise his voice as he had just done, silencing Moody before the former Auror could continue. Karkaroff was furious, his face turning an alarming shade of purple as he faced the room full of people who had just been reminded of his dark past.
The fact that his inky black gaze met Harry’s as he spoke warned the student that he would be the one testing one of the antidotes, probably the one that had been brewed improperly.
“…I still don't understand why you can't sign your own names,” Draco muttered as he carefully put the finishing touches to his friend’s circular slip of parchment. As was their habit the four friends were curled up together on his bed, Javier and Claude exchanging lazy kisses as they completed their required reading for their next Transfiguration class while Ramona lay with her legs tangled with Draco's as she worked on her Potions essay. “It's not as though it's very complicated; all you have to do is turn the parchment as you write so as to follow the circular shape. Even you could have managed such a feat, Claude…”
“No more hitting people in your sleep,” Javier ordered, his lips brushing against Claude’s forehead. “We don’t want our Champion going to breakfast with a black eye now do we?”
Arriving at the front of the hall Odette and Desiree performed a synchronised series of pirouettes, magical butterfly’s fluttering out from the ruffles of their tutus, before ending in an elegant pose amidst the polite applause coming from the sea of students and teachers.
“You heard correctly,” Severus confirmed, shrinking his supplies and slipped them into one of his pockets. “But one day he will be old enough to attend Hogwarts where I will be able to look out for him. I need to cement my position as a member of the faculty until then.”
A simple tap to the top of the badge caused the ink to shift colour, becoming a deep green on a sickly green background as a picture of Harry’s own face appeared above the words,

“I can certainly see why we're trying to keep them alive,” Fleur sneered, refusing to go anywhere near the creature she'd been given as Dean began making his way back towards the castle in order to visit the Hospital Wing, the burn on his hand rather alarming in both size and severity. “Who wouldn't want pets that can burn, sting and bite all at once?”
Draco yelped as his world turned upside down when he got launched off the broom from the impact from hitting the wall beyond the door.
Draco gazed at the photo of the shopfront, his mind taken back to the memory of when he had bought his wand there, beaming as his father had praised him for the hawthorn wand, which typically went to witches and wizards of proven talent.
He was so caught up in the guilt and worry for his mother, he almost missed the oaf Hagrid saying they were going to be going into the forest for the day's lesson to study a creature that “preferred the dark”
Also can someone help me with the tags... like there is no rape, but it might trigger something in someone so I'd like to tag properly but I don't know what to tag...
Draco nodded, amused, “Regardless, I can survive a few weeks alone. Merlin knows I’m used to it in the Manor.”
He wasn’t allowed out of the house, the Dark Lord had forbidden it. So, for another long period of time, he was trapped in his room.
She was silent for a second, her lack of answer conveying that she was surprised he had taken this route. “Well.” was all she said, before stopping to bend a glowing yellow flower to her nose.
Draco nodded “He got through my walls, I wasn’t fast enough when I put them up… he saw through the Pansy stuff but it distracted him enough that I hid the memories.”
Draco reached over and began to sift through the letters, which included some from his friends, the morning paper, some formal letters from the various causes that the Malfoy’s Gringotts vault supported, and some bills and receipts.
He gave Pansy her present. As she unwrapped the necklace and earrings that Draco had noticed her looking at in Hogsmeade weeks back, she gasped.
“Yes well, I do maintain my old house pride!” She smiled at them, then sat down in her seat, “It’s good to see such lovely young gentlemen surviving in what is...quite the mess of a school system. Hopefully, my presence here will change that.” Her smile was predatory.
She drew back and held his face, inspecting it. “It's good to have you home darling. Come, give your things to the elves… You must be tired, but- perhaps you would like to go for a walk in the gardens later?”
Sneaking closer, he made his way to the doorframe of the drawing room, which was more than close enough to hear the debates of the Death Eaters.
Hellooo! Please leave a comment or Kudos if you enjoyed! They help a lot! Any critique- good or bad would also help! Hope you guys like the budding romance between Blaise and Draco. it's kind of something to keep you going until we get to Harry :) - which is still a while away augh.
Who saw that coming? Let me know on my socials if you picked up on any other of the clues sprinkled throughout! If you have any questions be sure to hit me up too.
Draco inwardly cursed as he remembered he had forgotten to look up the animal. He had forgotten to show Blaise around too. Perhaps he needed to invest in a remembrall.
Draco froze. He had been struggling to breathe before but now he just stopped. Did Potter know? How did he know? Draco's heart was going a million times an hour and he felt like he was going to be sick when Potter frowned at him, obviously confused by his silence “Oh you’re so disgusted by my Bi-ness that you can't even manage a response. Is that fear in your eyes I see? I was joking Malfoy- as if I'd even consider hooking up with someone as disgusting as you.”
The answer had obviously been prepared and rehearsed. Nevertheless, Draco actually felt everything deflate, relief flooding into him. He didn't know what he would have done if the answer had been different. She was so different from Father, so loving and accepting. She always had been. He was stupid for thinking otherwise.
Draco could not get Potter’s face out of his head as he attempted to sleep that night after Snape had returned and released them, giving Draco a look as he did so. Draco had kept his walls strong, especially after feeling of a light touch on them. Snape could not see what he had just done.
He spent the next half hour half attempting to study ancient history, then got annoyed at his inability to focus and changed into his working out clothes.

to whisper “No wonder, Snape doesn't seem like the most pleasant-” Draco cleared his throat, edging away from Blaise, who’s low whisper was far too attractive to be safe for Draco. Who would
He desperately wanted to see Mother. He wrote his reply and suggested they meet in Hogsmeade the next day. As he tied his letter to Tawkins and sent the owl off as he ate another sweet from his Mother's 'Care Package’ and smiled at the flavour explosion in his mouth. He hoped she would reply quickly.
“What were you making?” Draco asked as Snape slowly unwrapped his gift, being careful not to tear the wrapping.
They told him of their plan to hang back and try to capture Potter, something he had felt his stomach clench at. They were stupid, but they could now do dissolusion charms and Potter wasn't expecting an attack. Plus, sometimes stupidity could be dangerous.
Draco shook Blaise's arm off him, “I know her type. She’s going to be cruel to anybody below her, just to prove she can, and I’m not going to be treated like shit. She doesn't see us as people, she sees us as students to control.” He continued walking to the hall, and Blaise scrambled to keep up “However-- she will snivel up to anyone
The next chapter will be back at the normal pace, it was just important to get through a bit of time because I don't want to bore any of you.
Draco was sipping his usual morning tea and was reading a book Bellatrix had instructed him to read, which was enchanted to look like a textbook when there was a small knock at his door.
“Follow me please” Pansy began leading the first years away, and Draco glanced up to see Potter leaving the hall, looking distressed, and the source of his departure was clear. He was being followed by looks of apprehension, fear and some which displayed outright hate.
He had watched as Voldemort orchestrated it all from his position in the Malfoy Manor, and had wreaked havoc within the folds of the ministry itself. He had watched as his Mother had hosted the death eaters, putting up with their requests for her to make them meals and other bullshit when they had house elves.
“Who cares,” Draco interrupted, wanting to change the subject “He’s probably only doing it for attention. And besides, I think he only keeps the Mudblood around for her head and not her looks… I mean- have you seen those teeth?”
"But it's only been a couple of weeks." He finished for her, returning her warm smile. She let him in using the same key Filch had used. As soon as he got through she swung it shut behind him and then turned around and swept him into a long hug. But then she stepped back, and he saw none of the joy he had felt in the hug. She was biting her lip and looking concerned.
“It could be any number of things- but my guess is that it’s his Horcrux. Because he came back from the dead.”
“Alright! Let’s start off easy” said Graham, who was a chaser himself. They all launched in the air.
amongst friends. He felt a smile, a real smile, come onto his face. It was the first one since the night of the piano concert.
His Father continued “Regardless, I did not come down here just to lecture you- There have been a few Death Eaters staying here recently but- there will be more. If all goes well in the next couple of weeks- well... I cannot tell you, but the Dark Lord is planning something, and I am to be involved.” His father looked uncomfortable “But if all does not go well, you shall be the head of house. Until I am able to return. I will leave no power to your mother, as she has become too unstable-”
The small boy shrunk under Snape's glare. "Sir- sir, Mr. Bagman wants him," he stuttered "All the champions have got to go, I think they want to take photographs..."
The human mind lost logical control when faced with imminent death, and simultaneously would do anything to survive.
Draco breathed out, the hardest part of coming home over, and was surprised to find himself alone. He decided to find Blaise, perhaps he would want to go for a run. It was spring after all, and the gardens would be looking beautiful.
I’ve never seen Him so angry… We were in a meeting when He first got the news that Potter had robbed Gringotts.” Draco paused as he re-lived the memory. “I didn’t think it was possible but he got paler than normal. And before he got angry- well- he looked scared.”
He hadn’t realised how sleep deprived his mother had looked the last time he had seen her. But looking upon her face now- and her eyes, which didn’t have permanent bags under them and had the spark of life in them he could see just how bad she had been. He smiled at her, glad to see her looking so well.
They made their way to Spintwitches Sporting Needs, the smell of leather and wood polish drifting pleasantly into their noses as a small snitch came and flew around their heads. The shop owner bustled over to them and upon request quickly showed them to the gloves section. He pointed out a couple and was obviously trying to sell the most expensive ones. Draco shrugged and bought a pair of Clabbert Leather and Dragonhide gloves ‘for both comfort and grip’ it was his father’s money, whom he hated, so why not waste it? It wasn’t like his father would find out.
They re-entered the manor and made their way to their rooms, Draco teased Blaise and playfully shoved him. “If you hadn’t strayed from the path you might have won, idiot.”
Poppy cast the magical core spell on him, and they all fell silent. When the boy was unconscious, his magic had filled the room, but all previous tests while he was awake showed fairly normal results. This was not that.
“Your mom knows some of it, actually. So it can stay between her too. If you… if you need someone to talk to about it. Ron and Hermione have each other, but it’s still quite a lot.”
“Entity Death, I am the Tether to your Master- I tie him to life, as he ties me. Until Death comes for us both, we shall not part.” Draco watched the gold thread light up and grow taught. His quick glance to Hermione showed she had noticed as well. “To tie is to honor, to bind is to serve, in power and health the chain is forged, in fragility and sickness the chain is wielded. With the tether of life, we shall not part.”
“Oi, I wrote that one!” Said Ron, puffing his chest out. “See look, even Draco thinks I know what romance is.”
drawing them closer together, weaving them like a cloth. He willed it to first slow the plummet of Draco’s body, before trying to catch him.
They continued in silence once again, reaching the dungeons before Weasley put out a hand and clapped Malfoy on the shoulder.
In the days immediately after his apology to Granger there were some small hiccups. Moments when Harry’s face would shine with adoration, and Draco would have to force down the swell of delight that crept up his spine. Similarly he caught himself gazing at Harry’s profile in classes, or letting his eyes linger too long on his figure as they walked down the corridor.
It was late, he realized absently. The moon was high in the sky, and the chatter that normally filled their common room had been reduced to a few murmurs. In the reflection of the glass Draco could tell two thirds of the golden trio were still out, sitting near but not with Hannah Abbot and Millie.
The question was said with such exasperated feeling that Harry had no choice but to say, “You’re so pretty.”
“I pay attention,” he said, tone grave as he spoke around his mouthful, “got to practice to increase my emotional range, I think I’m almost to a tablespoon now.”
, and instead of feeling his walls fill in their Potter shaped holes, he thought their contours were getting more defined. It didn’t help that Draco had been wrong in assuming that the night in the hospital wing would have been the last time Potter would touch him. Oh no. Potter’s easy affection with his friends extended to him too.
“So much for greeting as old friends,” Ron scoffed, to which Hermione nodded. Draco hoped it made as little sense to everyone else in the room as it did to him.
Internally shrugging, Draco chalks it up to the glasses thing. Unfortunately this mental detour had him pause for too long, and his and Pansy’s cauldron is bubbling ominously.
The golden trio lost it, all laughing into their plates, completely unaware of how a pair of grey eyes across the room softened at the sight.
“If nothing,” she hissed, pulling him into a hug. “You both were idiots for leaving your wands but none of this is your fault.”
exactly the two women seemed to understand about the light when Pansy whipped her head out of the pensive, face ashen.
Draco snorted out a laugh, not in the least surprised. Harry shot him a rueful grin before continuing.
Draco nodded, miserably aware that his going forward with this meant he too was part of the problem.
“We haven’t looked at that one from Grimmauld, the one that talked about bonds where you had to be close.” Ron said, cocking his head to the side.
A trade. Turning this into a transaction appealed to Draco, however he couldn’t be sure that Harry’s secret was as revealing as his own. It was enough to get him to turn and meet grey eyes to green, however.
old hat at this whole dying at school business, but if you ever come close again, leave me out of it. I haven’t spent so much time in the infirmary since you put me there, and even then it was only overnight. One night, mind you! One, singular, medicated sleep.”
The only other person she had seen him get this flustered around was Cho. That was another realization Harry had yet to embrace from this summer.
“I cannot say I’m surprised at you two,” she said, shooting a dark look at Ron and Hermione, “but Mister Malfoy- could you really not wait until tomorrow?”
“Right, well. Later then.” Weasley lumbered into the classroom, returning to his spot next to Longbottom, immediately bending to look at their cauldron.
“You’re the only one he trusts.” He blurted out. She looked at him incredulously. “Adult, or faculty- I mean. You. You mean as much to him as he does, to you.”
“Thank you, Mister Malfoy. I feel very lucky to have known Harry, and I am equally grateful that you have gotten the chance to become close with him as well. Please, think about what I’ve said. I will certainly be thinking about your words.”
Golds, greens, and blues took over the room. No one area was the brightest- instead the light seemed to shift about, pulsing around them erratically. Draco looked down at his hands and saw some of the light there was a deep red. It seemed almost solid, as if he could grip it.
“Harry Potter you are, without a doubt, the thickest, most obtuse hero on this planet. I’m in love with you, you absolute tosser!”
“Hermione might’ve gone into something of a snit when I refused to leave you alone with them for the night,” Pansy started. “I told her I wasn’t going to leave you without a friend, and one thing led to another and now we’re all trying to
“Harry James Potter, you will not die another time so long as I live, do you hear me?” Her voice was stern, though it carried a wobble that she couldn’t hide. She waited until the boy tried to nod, and threw her arms around him. “Oh young man you gave me such a fright, I can’t even begin to say!”
Draco wished he had some control over the hope that was sweeping through him like daybreak. It was clear that, at present, Harry had no reservations on Draco remaining close to him- in more ways than one. He knew that Pansy wouldn’t be so easily swayed. It was her voice that warned him that this might not be permanent, that this could backfire so deeply that he might not recover.
It had been her idea, of course. “Surely my being there will help you, plus Potter might even be an ass to me and you’ll see he’s not worth all this pinning.”
Draco didn’t know what to do with the missive. It sounded nothing like Potter, but at the same time it was exactly like him. It made Draco’s stomach squirm in ways he didn’t understand. He had ultimately decided it was a need to respond, and thus began the confusing but delightful exchange they had kept.
While she knew Harry wasn’t prone to falsehoods, he had always possessed a flair for the dramatic in a way that made her question the extent to which Draco Malfoy had been trying. However, between the way he had pleaded with Harry in his memory, and the gentle touch he had just unthinkingly given- she was convinced. More than a little touched, as well. Gaining Harry’s trust to the extent he obviously had was one thing, but knowing Harry let someone care for him the way Draco did- well, she was pleased to say the least.
“Oh don’t pretend you don’t care about him too!” Draco cried, frustration bubbling out of him. “You two have become such good friends that I’ve had to ask
Which brought him back to the clarity the world possessed. He could see the faint smattering of freckles that dusted across Malfoy’s nose- he didn’t even know Malfoy had freckles before today.
that soothed the prickly worry at the back of Draco’s mind. He made himself match his breath to Harry’s, and quickly slipped off to sleep.
Draco wasn’t sure what to say. His eyes still burned as he stared blankly at his fingers entwined with Pansy’s. He wished, not for the first time, that he could have loved her.
“There’s a bit of a chant involved. It’s quite a bit like the muggle wedding vows, but they’ve bungled it a bit. That’s why it sounded familiar when you mentioned it last night, Pansy. Mione had me keeping track of some of the phrases and that one kept coming up.”
“Right,” Hermione started, drawing out a stack of books from the small purse on her hip. “As you are aware, Harry was able to defeat Voldemort through his use of the elder wand. He also had to die.” Her voice wavered some, but she took a breath and plowed on. “He came back, obviously, but he had completely died out there in the forest. And since then his magic has been… difficult.”
There was a stretch of silence after Draco spoke that made him realize how painfully earnest he sounded. He was just resolving to explain it away as a tactic for when Pansy inevitably brought it up when McGonagall spoke again.
Harry had manoeuvred them near a rock so he could be taller than Draco, arms still wrapped tight around each other. He pressed a kiss to the top of silver-blond hair, before rocking Draco in his arms.
Pansy and Draco gaped at the ginger. He looked between them, confused, before slow understanding spread across his face.
It was warm. It felt like laughter, and heartbeats, and the fluttering of a snitch. It felt like life.
All the questions buzzing through Draco’s mind were overshadowed by Harry’s eyes meeting his. He suddenly recalled a line from one of Skeeter’s articles, some nonsense about Harry’s eyes “swimming with the ghosts of his past.” As it turned out, the way the green shone with tears, open and so immensely, senselessly
He quieted as she approached. Draco, Hermione, and Ron all stepped aside, heads somewhat bowed, though Draco thought the other two were only following his lead.
“Sorry, sorry, not the time. My best guess is that you have to start with an appeal to death, state your status as his tether, and that nothing
“I think Harry ought to be the one to decide if he’d like to share the full extent, but for the moment- yes.” Her eyes flashed and everyone in the room seemed to flinch as she fixed them with a hard stare. “This stays here, I am not afraid to use memory charms if that ends up being the only way to keep this quiet.”
They sat in silence like that until Pansy squeezed his hand, once, twice, then let go. She rose, giving a small nod to Granger as she turned to leave the room. A nonverbal goodnight that was returned from Granger’s place across the room, leaning heavily against a sleeping Weasley.
Draco looked at her, and thought of how Harry always seemed brighter after having tea with her. He recalled Harry telling him about how she had offered a biscuit when he had been sure she was going to tell him off for standing up to Umbridge. He had smiled so fondly while recounting it, and Draco felt a slow gnawing at his chest at the memory.
“At one point we managed to convince you to sit with us, but Harry’s vitals promptly got worse. It was quite romantic, in an exceedingly morbid way. He started to recover as soon as you were back at his side.” Pansy said. Her tone skirted the edge of teasing, and Draco flushed.
Draco looks down, and realizes absently that he was about to add powdered bicorn horn instead of powdered boomslang skin- a sure fire way to turn what should be a healing draught into a sizable explosion.
“Poppy,” he heard McGonagall say, her tone almost pleading. Draco lowered his gaze, and tried to block out their voices.
“Yes,” Draco said haltingly, “yes, what I thought might’ve been his blood looked like the consistency of unicorn blood, but was dark and gold, rather than silver. I should probably tell Granger.” Draco moved to get off of the bed and was shocked when Pansy and Weasley both lunged forward, stopping him.
“I love you,” Harry said quietly. “You’re lovely to be around, you’re funny and sharp, and brilliant in ways that make me wish we could have been friends from the beginning. I’m so lucky you’re here with me now.”
That was the thought that kept him going, lowering the net closer and closer to the ground as slow as he dared. His vision began growing black at the edges, and each breath felt harder than the last, but he would make this work.
The aftermath of Weasley’s confrontation left him feeling adrift. Pansy had tried to cajole him into talking about why he had fled the common room, but he couldn’t make himself tell her the thoughts circling in his head.
Hermione nodded, and flipped open a decrepit looking tome. Draco and Pansy looked at each other before bending their heads to see what the book said.
Harry ducked his head and laughed, oblivious to the wave of adrenaline coursing through the blond boy.
“And am I meant to do something about it? You know just as well as I do that if I could control some aspect of this, I would.” Draco tried to match the evenness of her voice, but couldn’t help the tinge of frustration that leaked into it.
A quick flick of her own wand, paired with a simple summoning spell, and Ramona was soon in possession of a medium sized box of Belgian truffles. The Muggle kind, Draco noticed with silent approval, rather than the Magical equivalent. If there was one thing that Muggles, particularly the Belgians, could do better than Witches and Wizards it was make superior chocolate. She handed them over without a word, Draco accepting them with a small nod.
“We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn’t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,” Karkaroff sneered, showing off his yellowed teeth. “Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination, too. An odd quality in a
swung open to admit them they were surrounded by a gaggles of students, all of them giggling and gossiping and pointing out various members of the group. Whilst it was predominantly the younger students, the ones who wouldn't have entered even if they hadn't introduced the age restriction, Draco spotted a few of the older students amongst the group. Their expressions were different, more calculating, as they attempted to figure out which one of the
“Josephine Villeneuve,” Ramona answered, struggling with the French pronunciations a little bit given her naturally thick Spanish accent even when speaking English as was a requirement of the school. Every day the school spoke in a different language, supposedly to teach the students how to survive in a “multi-cultural magical world” despite the fact that translation spells were covered in their third year. “Which isn't so bad, all things considered. She doesn't mind what I do with my side of the room so long as it doesn't interfere with her filing system. I'm hoping to convince her to let me brighten her side up a bit, though…”
and would then be serving as their home away from home for the duration on the tournament. “I mean it.”
whatever happens but Thierry…I don't know if he could survive Claude and my brother’s exuberant lifestyles…”
“Dark-Wizard catcher,” Ron answered before Hermione could launch into a more factual explanation, much to her annoyance. “Half the cells in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.”
“I’m going to head back to the carriage where I can study in peace,” he announced, glaring pointedly at Ramona who huffed theatrically, throwing a screwed up piece of parchment at his head much to the annoyance of the school’s vulture-like librarian.
He took his seat, helped himself to some food and tried to ignore the way everyone was staring at him, most of his fellow students not even bothering to be discreet about it, tried to ignore the way Ron turned his back on him where he was sat with Seamus and Dean, both of whom offered Harry an apologetic smile before carrying on their conversation.
“No,” Fleur responded sharply, her voice carrying above the amused titters of the Hogwarts students gathering around them watching the scene taking place with undisguised interest. “Although, obviously, you can't be all that important or else you would know that I am…”
trapped in a small space together for any length of time would most probably lead to an outbreak of war,” Ramona sighed, using a simple transfiguration spells to transform the flat beige carpet beneath their feet into a ridiculously soft and fluffy expanse of forest greens and midnight blues. Draco snorted, nodding to show his agreement of her simple statement. “So I'm stuck with the lesser of two evils but if Skye carries on as she is she'll soon find her things going missing...”
been abused and Hermione was right about the fact that they should be protected in circumstances such as that, where their employers mistreat them or cause them harm, but if what Nearly Headless Nick said about the elves at Hogwarts was true, that they were all happy and enjoyed their lives, shouldn’t they just be left alone to live them?
It was a struggle for Draco not to start chuckling at his friends “misfortunes” but he managed to control himself, focusing instead of unpacking his various textbooks and organising them in alphabetical order on one of the shelves above his small study area.
His words, both his agreement to put his name down and his statement about the “unwelcome touching” quickly reduced the four of them to a mess of giggles, chuckles and outright laughter as they rearranged themselves into a slightly more relaxed snuggle fest.
once more, and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It’s only fair, Dumbledore.”
“No,” Narcissa countered. She glanced down at her son before answering softly. “I visited my parents today, to let them know about our leaving the country. And then I fell over.”
“So,” Dumbledore announced as he rose to his feet, waving a single hand to clear away the empty plates and bowls from the various tables. “Now that you are all fed and watered I must once more ask for your attention while I give out a few notices. Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle this…”
. Draco had barely paid it any attention earlier, all of them passing through the boundary without hesitation as they were all over the age limit.
He had been less than thrilled to discover that they were to travel to Hogwarts in a flying carriage pulled by a dozen winged horses, given how utterly terrified he was of heights, but it was actually the view out of the window that was causing his stomach to rebel. Whilst the interior of the carriage seemed to be perfectly still thanks to a suitable stabilising spell the exterior of the carriage was, in fact, at the mercy of the elements and as such was being flung this way and that. This meant that the view out of the various windows in the different rooms of the carriage which was, of course, bigger on the inside was constantly moving, the fluffy white clouds jerking back and forth across the blindingly blue sky, the sun flashing up once in a while to blind them. Claude wasn't the only one suffering and so most of the elegant drapes had been drawn across the windows, Draco's included, but the damage had been done as far as their friend was concerned, the motion combined with his fear leaving him desperately trying to keep his breakfast down in his stomach where it belonged.
“Please, take your seats quickly and quietly so that I may begin the class,” tiny Professor Flitwick called out from his place standing upon a stack of books. “Now, as you can see…”
“Yeah,” Bill, Ron’s eldest brother who wore his flaming red hair in an effortlessly cool looking ponytail which his mother kept threatening to chop off, sighed deeply as he gazed wistfully at the train, hands in his pockets. “I sort of wish I was back at Hogwarts this year.”
“Sometimes a little emotional blackmail is called for,” he eventually announced once Claude had stopped moving around, having found his desired comfortable position. “Especially when your friend is being a bit of an idiot and worrying about things that don't really matter. You're cousins are evil minions. We all know that. Don't let them ruin our last year.”
“The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr Crouch and Mr Bagman and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge,” Dumbledore continued, smiling at the squib as the casket was placed on the raised platform beside where he was standing. A sheen of sweat glistened on the squibs forehead for a moment before it was wiped away with a rag. “Thank you, Mr Filch.”
“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts the Heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year,” Dumbledore interrupted the seemingly premature celebrations, silencing the premature celebrations. “Only students who are of age, that is to say seventeen years or older, will be allowed to put their names for consideration.”
The Owlery was a circular stone room located at the top of the West Tower and no matter what time of year it was the room was always rather cold due to the fact that none of the

students gazing at Draco with mixed emotions; Yvette and Odette, theory makes-up streaked, were positively glowering across at him whilst beside them Desiree still wore the pinched expression she had when his name had been read out.
“But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,” Hermione mused thoughtfully, returning her attention to her book and the search for her place amongst the pages. “Somewhere very cold, because they've got fur capes as part of their uniforms.”
As far as he could see when facing a dangerous competition against opponents three years his senior could only end in two possible ways for him; to make a complete and utter fool out of him when he failed or, as had just been suggested, to permanently maim or
He was forced to endure the celebration in his honour for an hour, during which his voice grew hoarse from telling people over and over again that he hadn’t entered his name at all.
“Disperse!” Professor McGonagall ordered the students, using her wand to throw open the doors of the Great Hall so that they could enter the cavernous room. “All of you!
The excitable voice of Colin Creevey, a third year Gryffindor who had something of a crush on Harry, interrupted Ron before the dripping wet teen could even begin to truly complain about the unfairness of the situation. Despite being thirteen Colin was positively tiny, so small he could probably have passed for a first year had he wanted to. He clutched his old-fashioned magical camera to his chest, thankfully unused thus far, as he dropped do into the seat beside Harry, forcing Ron and Hermione to take the two empty places on his other side.
“Oh, I think the least you can do is owe me a favour,” he announced as, with a flick of his wand, he sent the tiny bundles of parchment to the correct owner. Ramona murmured her thanks, tucking hers into her pocket, while both Claude and Javier continued to stare across at him in protest, tiny bundles on their open palms. “Or perhaps some Belgian chocolates…”

“…huh…” he muttered as he finally turned off the water, stepping out to grab his towel. Patting himself dry quickly he secured the rectangle of cloth around his waist, collected his shower things and headed back to his private bedroom. “…well that was…unexpected…”
Harry promised he would. Siblings generally ended up in the same house, like the Weasley, but that wasn't set in stone. Parvati’s twin sister, Padma, was in Ravenclaw and as Hermione had mumbled thoughtfully you'd expect identical twins, of all people, to end up together.
for him and his friends, ranging from confronting a psychotic professor who had another man’s head underneath his turban to fighting a basilisk to being attacked by Dementors. He'd been hoping for a painfully quiet year. “I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it…”
“He could not have crossed the Age Line,” McGonagall, his wonderful Head of House, came to his defence. She pulled him away from Bagman. “I am sure we are all agreed on that –”
Sorry for the delay – had a bit of writers block which was firmly dealt with my taking my five Godchildren to the Harry Potter Studio Tour a couple of weeks ago. I think it’s safe to say that they loved it and I loved seeing how much they enjoyed it. So, hopefully I can churn out a few more chapters before I get stalled again. Lol. Comments/Suggestions welcome. X
,” Madame Maxime agreed, throwing her truly massive hands up into the air with an overly-dramatic flair. “’Ogwarts cannot ‘ave two champions. It is most unjust.”
Victor Krum, Cedric Diggory and Draco Malfoy were all stood in front of the truly enormous fireplace, the only source of light in the room, creating a trio of impressive silhouettes; Krum was by far the most muscular but the other two weren’t lacking in the muscles department.
not even pausing when he reached the age line, and dropped his slip of parchment into the flames. “He’s so strong…”
It was Colin Creevey, the promising young photographer who had been more than a little bit obsessed with Harry since coming to Hogwarts. The Third Year flashed a smile across at his hero before forcing his expression into one of politeness as he approached Professor Snape.
Given that they were all anxiously awaiting the arrival of the feast the sorting seemed to drag on and on, an endless stream of new students joining the houses they'd been given. As usual there was a pretty even spread between the houses although there were a few more Hufflepuff’s than usual this year, the “
“I want you to call me if you experience any lingering pain or problems,” Penelope ordered as she finished up, rising from the crouched position she had been working in and smoothing out the fabric of her skirt. She’d obviously come straight from work as she still wore the distinct uniform of a hospital matron. “Especially in regards to those ribs of yours.”
“Please arrange yourselves by order of position,” Madame Maxime ordered, gesturing towards the giant double doors to their right. “Mademoiselles Poulin and Morel shall lead.”
to Oahu, the third largest and most densely populated of the Hawaiian Islands which was also home to the states magical community. Ramona giggles softly, putting her wand away as she perched on the bed. “You finished?”
Javier slipped away from the other three so as to open the ornate carriage door for their Headmistress, smiling up at the giantess as she nodded her thanks before entering. He then proceeded to hold the door open for his sister, his lover and his best friend before following them inside and closing it firmly behind him. When he turned around to face the room he found all his fellow
sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within. And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead for you, alas…most difficult…I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass…and perhaps sooner than you think…”
“Draco,” Ramona murmured, her voice little more than a pure as she moved to stand beside him, placing a gentle hand on his arm. He didn't miss the way the redhead’s eyes snapped across to her, an entirely different look appearing in them. “Perhaps we should be going…”
“Oh, that’s right, you were staying with them this summer, weren’t you?” Fleur sneered, tossing her picture perfect platinum blonde hair over her shoulder. Out of the corner of his eye Harry caught sight of Hermione fussing with her own less than perfect hair, attempting to get it to lie flat. “Tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?”
“We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants, Dumbledore,” Karkaroff added imperiously. “Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools. I know several who would…”
“I think it looks like you just got out of bed,” Draco responded, earning a glare from his friend even as the twins snorted loudly. “And Madame Maxime will never let you leave this carriage looking like that, or did you forget her lecture about representing our school?”
“Oh, shut up…” Claude muttered, moving over to Draco's mirror so that he could sort his hair out properly until it could be described as stylishly messy rather than just a mess. It was similar to how Draco worse his own hair only Claude added more volume. “There? Better?”
“Honestly? I don’t know,” Draco sighed at length, shifting so that his arms were pillowed beneath his head. It stretched out his back, a loud pop emanating from the base of his spine. “He was absolutely petrified. No matter what they were trying to suggest, and by
“I hate to rush you but we have a rather strict timetable to keep to,” Narcissa murmured, nodding towards where Lucius was admittedly reluctantly continuing to shrink their possessions so that they could be carried in a single suitcase. Narbey had arrived with her things shortly before her own arrival. “Draco, have you finished packing up your things?”
Given his past dealing with Ministry of Magic the knowledge that they had a hand in the secrecy only served to make Harry frown deeper. They'd tried to expel him the previous year, after all, for defending his muggle cousin from a bunch of Dementors and they were the ones who had forced Sirius, his Godfather and the closest link he had to his deceased parents, to go on the run after having wrongly imprisoned him for a crime he didn't commit.
Currently it was too much of a jumble; fear, anger, anxiety, bitterness…not to mention the unfamiliar yearning sensation he felt whenever he’d been in the presense of Draco Malfoy.
There were a set of twins a couple of years below Draco and his friends, Andre and Etienne, who did the whole ‘
. She was an excellent teacher, strict but still fair, who encouraged her students to learn as much as they possibly could; he was confident that when he sat his final exams after the
Gone were the sun-kissed honey blonde curls, replaced by a mess of jet-black hair which was just a fraction too long. Tanned skin became almost painfully pale. Soft, plump cheeks became hollowed, more angular but not quite as sharp as Draco’s own deadly cheekbones.
Turning on the nearest shower stall to the bathroom door he stripped off his pyjamas, an old set of Dudley’s which were ridiculously huge on him, and ducked under the hot spray.
“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the Tournament, none of which have been very successful,” Dumbledore continued calmly. “However, our own Departments of International Magical Co-Operation and Magical Games and Sports have decided that the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that, this time no champion shall find himself or herself in mortal danger.”
him to pay attention to him, and that…well…that was the complete opposite of what he normally wanted to happen. Normally he would give pretty much anything to pass by unnoticed like everyone else was able to, to simply be a normal student attending class.
He watched, amused, as she indicated the circle of blue smoke floating a couple of feet off of the floor around the
Harry couldn't blame her for finding refuge from all of that as it was bad enough when Dean Thomas got started on his love of football, discussing things at length with Seamus and Harry who were the only ones who understood what he was going on about and then only vaguely, in Harry's case, as they weren't quite do obsessive about the popular muggle sport.
Alternate Universe, Alternate Timeline (tiny little tweaks only), Slash, Canon-Typical Violence, Coming Out, First Time, Underage (nothing graphic), Homophobia
Harry had only met two House Elves in his life, Dobby and Winky, but he suspected that were there more like the former out there they would have had an uprising long before now. Poor Winky
To the right of the door the long thin room which effectively ran the full length of the magical interior of the carriage was split up into two types of cubicles; the ones nearest the door were the toilets and the ones furthest away were the showers. There were six of each.
“Draco Malfoy, at your service,” he supplied his name without hesitation, so focused on his cousin that he didn't even realising how many people were staring straight him. “Our mothers are sisters, Fleur, only mine decided to get away from Voldemort’s clutches before it was too late, as did my father, saving their reputations and their souls. Unlike yours.”
Harry halted, growling. “Fuck you, Malfoy--I wasn't going to touch you! What are you even doing--accusing me of? You’re off your nut! We’re talking here--it’s important! You can’t just leave!”
Wandering about the market place, Harry thought of the Spider and the Flower and the Tree, parts of a Whole, and the meanings therein that spoke to Wizarding folk. For though the Nazca Lines had been made mostly by Muggles, Wizardkind had still dwelt amongst them, and far more freely before the earliest of the Old World invaders had arrived. Magic was integral to living, part of everyday existence back then, and the lines between blurred very thin. Life to life, and forward together, Harry thought, his mind flashing to Altamira.
“Well…” Harry shrugged, grimacing ruefully. “There’s my Antwerp chappie, always, and I’ve been receiving some unsettling news from the Americas recently. Damages at Nazca, unfortunately. And I never leave here at a rational hour and the bloody Aurors are always nattering after us for field support. So, normal enough, I’d say. Nothing drastic.”
Harry. Harry being gone, the git. Inexplicably, endlessly, ruthlessly departed. There was nothing, that's all.
Feathers, for all their inherent softness, were amazingly loud things when they were flapping. Draco winced.
, thanks. He didn't want the git's far-too-pointy nose stuffed up with gross Bogeys. He'd be the one kissing him, later.
"You can," Harry insisted, pursing his lips and wrinkling up his nose, as if Draco were dense as a thicket and just wasn't twigging something so obvious. But to him, only him. "You must. We're over with, Draco. Have been. Old news."
"Please-please-please!" Harry returned the hiss thought tight-clamped teeth, the edges of them pinching his lower lip. "Oh!"
All else was drowned in snogs and cheers. Tears, too, from fond mother-in-laws to be and stern but kind-hearted Scotswomen. The triumphant roars of Gryffs, pleased for Harry; the happy hiss of Slytherins, proud of Draco. A multitude of VIPs and miscellany—even Weasleys.
A familiar figure, hunched assiduously over a beautiful old wooden desk nearly as wide as a barn door, looked up immediately and hastily flung down his tattered quill.
Gawds! Merlin's saggy behind! It practically fused his eyes blind, the horror of it. Weaselbee's naked freckled cock and Granger's equally bushy brown muff—right there before him, bobbing up and swooping down—naked! Nude! Starkers!
The blur of Draco's hidden thoughts were all at once golden-and-silver; they bloody sparkled with brilliance. Harry felt a great wave of what could only be the essence of 'happy', crashing across the conduit the magical ring had laid open.
“Yes? Talk,” Harry prompted, looking severely unimpressed with the entire business. “Tell me yours if you don't like mine, then. Because we’ve tried everything there is to try. Even the Unspeakable things that I can’t even properly speak of, they're of no use and don't think I'm even the slightest bit--”
"Why should I? So you can talk me into coming back to the flat and then make me feel like shite again at your leisure? I don't think so, Malfoy. I'm happy where I am, back at Grimmauld. It's very comfortable there, these days. So, er.
"No!" Draco surged forward once more, stung into action, the force of it toppling the armchair abandoned behind him. It fell with a solid thunk, rattling the random bibelots on the mantel. "No! Fuck
love you—" This didn't seem to faze Harry as it did Draco, though. He blushed all the more, all of him.
A month more had passed since he'd come back to Grimmauld--he grabbed at the next file in the stack and pulled it toward him, reaching for his battered copy of
"No. Let him go," Neville contradicted, glaring from his seat at their table for four. "Enough's enough, mate." For when Harry and Draco had stormed from the Men's a moment ago Nev had been his usual self: calm and composed, as befitted a newly staid Herbology prof at Flamel Uni. But his chin had firmed as his head snapped to follow Draco's stormy progress and his eyes had gone grimly stern. Harry just knew Nev wouldn't hesitate to take Draco's perfect kneecaps right out from under him if he dared venture one step further toward that plated glass door. And Draco would regret it, Harry knew; Neville would make sure to humiliate him—for daring to walk away from Harry.
So did Potter, who had his mouth on Draco's neck, vampirical. Draco's starched high collar had been unbuttoned and his tie loosened, his school robes shoved aside so that they were sliding off one shoulder most awkwardly and Potter, the engineer of Draco's current highly unkempt appearance, was nibbling at him.
Harry jerked his chin, feeling the feathery trails of Luna’s magic meet and intertwine with his own. “Set.”
If Draco peered and squinted, turning his chin at an angle, just so, he could make out his mother's hand gripping his father's shoulder quite tightly; restraining him, apparently, from striding straight through the Floo and throttling his only spawn-and-rightful heir astride the elegant flames of pretty Slytherin green. If beloved Mumsy hadn't cast a partial damper on this paternal shite-storm already, then Merlin knew, it was looking to be a rough few moments coming. Nasty, even.
When Draco stayed, Harry never did. He never fell back to sleep after the dramatic dreams woke him. Instead he grimly stayed eyes-plastered- open to enjoy the feeling of not-alone. Enjoy
pretty horribly. It was probably his delivery, his inimitable Malfoy style. All he knew was that it wasn't working, his version of
, Harry. Don't go. Don't be this way. Come home with me. Don't be like this, so stubborn, so arse-headed. Come home with me, talk this out, talk to me, okay? We can fix it up—we can fix whatever it was, whatever I said; I don't even know what that was? I didn't mean it, alright? I never mean to be like tha-"
That earned him a nasty gtare. "Don't joke, Draco," Harry snapped. "This is no laughing matter. We'll likely have the rest of the year in detention for this. S'not funny!"
Draco thought instead of his life now, which had Harry Potter featured prominently. How incredibly, strangely different it was from anything he'd ever imagined, back in the day.
Draco was not at all surprised to find Harry not in his bed in the morning. Nor in the flat, either, although there was a half pot of tea left under a stasis charm and the
. Draco wrestled his way out from underneath his lover, Harry's softened cock leaving his slightly sore arse behind with a faint squishy sound.
Appalling, that his own mother could actually make light of what had surely been the most life-altering event he'd ever experienced—even if he'd been convinced it was also the most freakish...at the time. The worst day and night ever, Draco had been certain: having Potter incarcerated in his own bloody basement, covered in boils, the Mu-Granger being tortured right before his very eyes, his own precious wand waltzed off with, and then—and then! The very next morning—courtesy his beloved Grandme're's Veela legacy—he'd awoken to confront a bloody roc-sized wingspan and a bird beak where his usual rather more than good-looking nose should have been!
"Circe. Don't look now but this has gone all skew-whiff, Harry," Draco breathed quietly, doing his best to ignore the Manor's antics. "Deucedly odder than breakfast-time, this is."
“Yes, immediately,” Harry agreed, sliding his arm about Draco’s waist and taking a good firm grip of it. “Do the honours?”
"Go." Harry's soft command, a literal leitmotif of denial, was a hammer to Draco's ears, never ceasing. "
“Right, that's it. You’re swaying, Potter, and now you’ve gone dead pale,” Draco stated flatly and this time he did rise up, slipping his wand out of his sleeve holster as he did so in one smooth motion. “Enough. Either tell me what you got hit with right now or I’ll hex you silly and trot you straight back to St Mungo’s myself.”
,” Harry reproved her. “At all. It’s only hair. I’m working up my skills for Auror training, Hermione. I have to practice; Kingsley said to.”
But…Draco's sultry fond murmurings were sending Harry straight off to Nod; with a sigh, he surrendered, barely listening 'cept to know it was good, whatever it was Draco said, and he'd likely like it very much when it happened.
He growled and threw the paper across the room. He had to be better, and stronger- for his Mother and for himself.
you fucking asshole.” It was Blaise’s voice that held the panic. Draco burst into the room, wand out.
As if to prove his point, Draco watched as the Gryffindors stood as one and turned their very angry faces to glare at Pansy and the rest of the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws- Draco saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from under the sleeves and out of the pockets of dressing gowns.
Whilst continuing to pace and realised he wanted to go for a walk again, but it was dark and he wasn’t allowed out of the school. Additionally, he had begun to worry more about his mother. It had been two weeks and he hadn’t received a single letter from her. He had sent her his weekly letter, yet had received no reply. Had something happened to her? Was she okay? The thoughts had begun to dominate his head. He needed someway to release his energy. He hit his pillow but it was too soft and didn’t offer up enough resistance. He glanced around for something better.
Unable to resist teasing his friend further Draco responded with a noncommittal sounds and a patronisingly reassuring smile which was actually more of a grimace. Claude stuck his tongue out at him, moving to follow his boyfriend out of the room, their hands drifting towards one another so that they could link their fingers together. It was sickeningly sweet.
Glancing at himself in the mirror he mussed up his medium length platinum blond hair with his fingers, grateful that he had given up wearing it slicked back over the summer, getting it to hang artfully around his face before reaching into his wardrobe for the only part of his uniform he genuinely loathed; his beret. Draco was not now nor had he ever been a hat person and so being forced to wear the light blue “
“There!” Ramona announced triumphantly, standing with her hands on her shapely hips as she surveyed the room. Unlike most of the girls in their year who were determined not to put on an ounce of weight if they could help it his friend had accepted the fact that her body wanted her to be “cuddly” like her mother was. She wasn't fat by any means, there was just more meat on her bones than the others girls they knew. “Done! Although if we all enter the Triwizard Tournament like Madame wants us to I shall have to take it all down in a couple of weeks and transfer it to whatever accommodation we end up in for the duration.”
“Claude, if you throw up in my room I won't be responsible for my actions,” Draco muttered as he manually transferred his clothes from his trunk to the various storage options in his private room upon the carriage which was transporting them to
“This is Draco, here,” she pointed out the name that Harry had been searching for. “And it’s through his mother, Narcissa, that he is related to the DeLacour’s. Narcissa Malfoy was born Narcissa Black and,

Harry himself thought that, while he didn't particular fancy entering himself having spent too much time in the spotlight already being The-Boy-Who-Lived, he couldn't blame his friends for wanting to have a go. It was definitely going to be an interesting year…
“They can’t…they can’t seriously be thinking of letting him compete,” he found himself muttering in disbelief, his fellow Champions turning to face him. “He’s…he’s too young…”
In fact there were only three parts of his uniform, both his everyday outfit and the robes which he only had to don for special occasions such as this, that
as the door finally closed, leaving Harry alone to turn and drop down onto the third step with a heavy sigh, awkwardly resting his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. His eyes stung with tears of frustration.
Laughter surrounded him, other Slytherin’s calling out their own suggestions for how long it would take for him to get himself killed, and it was only Hagrid’s arrival that silenced them.
lessons last year Professor Trelawney had predicted death and destruction for Harry and his closest friends and it seemed that she was determined to keep the tradition going this year.
“I can see you as a Champion,” an unfamiliar voice announced suddenly, startling Draco enough that he jumped as he turned around to face the owner of the voice. He was genuinely surprised when he came face to face with none other than his cousin, Fleur, the young witch flanked by a couple of goons with a couple of less than attractive young witches hovering in the background. Ramona, having realised what was going on, smacked Claude on the shoulder until he turned, bringing Javier with him, and the three of them moved to flank Draco just in case he should need their assistance dealing with his cousin. “Should you be selected I would be delighted to attend the Yule Ball with you, were you to ask me.”
Harry woke, not for the first time, with a strangled gasp as he sat bolt upright in his bed within the confines of the heavy red curtains which surrounded in only this time it wasn't because of a nightmare or some horrific vision of Voldemort. No, this time it was because of a very strange dream which had featured the cast and storyline of ‘Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves’ which Dudley had become so obsessed with over the holidays that even Harry had been forced to watch it on more than one occasion only in his dream Robin Hood had been replaced by Charlie Weasley while Harry had found himself playing the part of Maid Marion.
Draco rolled his eyes towards her fondly, knowing full well that she wasn't implying that they'd miss him, rather that she was implying that he would need them and as much as it pained him to do so even just to himself she was probably right. As much as his parents had done their best to raise him to be good and honourable, something they had never been encouraged to be, he had still suffered from an alarming amount of jealousy and arrogance, particularly after he'd hit puberty. His mind had been conflicted, torn between the behaviour he'd been taught growing up and the unpleasantness growing within him but neither of his parents had been upset with him. When he'd gone to them, confused, they'd explained that unfortunately both jealousy and arrogance were traits of both their families.
for some reason, no idea why, but I’m making use of my time off work during this difficult time to work of some of my poorly neglected stories so I’ve got myself going with it again. In doing so I’ve found my love for this alternate universe I created again so hopefully I’ll be able to keep this story going. If I’ve made any silly mistakes after such a long absence please excuse me and let me know what they are so I can correct them. Marblez
In spite of everything else going on learning about the other school was surprisingly interesting as up until this year Harry hadn’t realised that there were other schools of witchcraft and wizardry scattered around the world. It had been terribly naïve of him, he realised now, to assume that everyone studied at Hogwarts but he wasn’t alone; almost every single Muggleborn had been unaware of the existence of the other schools as well.
do that again. And if you ever lie to me again, I will know.” Seemingly satisfied with his lesson, Lucius let go of his neck. Draco collapsed to the floor, gasping for breath. He could hear his mother whimpering and sobbing. Lucius squatted down, and laid a hand on Draco’s shoulder, his voice had softened “You are my son, I only want what is best for you” Draco was silent, tears coursing down his face “I love you very much, my son. But sometimes...you make me so
‘Examine your fears, ask yourself why you feel this way, and what you can do to change your situation.’
people in the school Blaise! Never mind our odd Headmaster, this is the woman you should come to have you any troubles…” Umbridge tilted her head at him, smiling.
Draco, I don't have much, but I've heard they are preparing to shut down Hogsmeade… you’re lucky I'm so quick to pass this onto you, the school is also in chaos...
Also am I droning on a bit with the story? My biggest problem when I first started writing was everything would go wayyyy to fast, so i put in filler stuff to build the relationships and make it feel more real. But now Im worries Im getting clogged down in it :l
He decided to continue on his way to the library, and gathered all the books he needed. But before leaving he paused. Perhaps his father had been spying on him through the occlumency, despite him not sleeping. Maybe it had something to do with him being drunk.
They swept onto the floor in their usual, graceful, fashion. In addition to having their children learn an instrument, it was common for rich pureblood families to give their children dancing lessons- as they wouldn't want their children to embarrass them at social functions.
His attention was captured by Harry again as he began walking backwards and forwards beside a now empty wall- a process that would look rather odd if one didn’t know that the pacing was the key to entering the room of hidden things. But why Potter was going back in when he had just exited, Draco could not figure out...
"You act like you're better than us all the time but you’re not, Draco!" Crabbe said as he straightened himself, "You won't get the glory of getting Potter all for yourself. So stop trying to fuck with us!" Crabbe took out his wand.
She noticed him looking, smiled, and came and kissed him on the cheek. Draco took her hand and kissed it, ignoring the awkward feeling- He had long gotten used to it.
"Want one, Granger?" he said, holding one out "I've got loads. But don't touch my hand, now. I've just washed it, you see; don't want a Mudblood sliming it up." Granger paled and her eyes narrowed to match Potter’s.
Draco smirked and began to draw an enchanted sketch of what he dubbed as ‘Pathetic Potter’ to throw at him. Draco turned around, smiling when Potter scowled at his glowing badge. He was about to throw the sketch when a small boy burst into the classroom, puffing like he had run a race.
“I don’t hate myself for it” Draco mumbled from his knees. “I hate myself for other shit. It’s a relief to feel something other than the shit in my head.” He felt like a child, hiding his head from the world as if that could fix everything.
he was dreaming about dancing with and kissing. He arrived early into the little village, feeling incredibly conflicted and decided to get a butterbeer while he waited.
“Mmm- Yes.” Harry barely managed to get the word out before he burst out laughing, and strangely enough, Draco found himself joining in, because he couldn’t help it either.
Draco held his breath, checking every part of his defences. After a time it stopped. He opened his eyes to see The Dark Lord’s red eyes staring at- no-
The night had arrived and Draco was wearing his Yule Ball suit again. He sat at the piano, playing through the program, trying to ignore the company and words surrounding him. Pansy stepped up for her scheduled solo piece and Draco decided to get some water for them both. On the way, he unfortunately ran into his father, who looked rather intimidating in his black robes.
Ever since the incident with his father last holidays, Snape had been keeping close tabs on Draco and had been teaching him occlumency. Whilst Draco wasn't a fan of Snape always wanting to know what he was doing and how he was feeling, he did appreciate the lessons.
looking at Draco and Pansy with a surprised look on his face again. Draco mustered his courage, winked. Potter looked taken aback at that, and then frowned. Draco scoffed, amused, and turned back to Pansy. This was going to be a good night.
Draco paused. Fenrir was trying to tempt Draco with a secret. He was looking for payment from anywhere.
Draco steeled himself and tried to control his nerves, realising that Potter would definitely be in the Prefects cartridge. There was no way he wouldn’t have been made Prefect.
Draco nodded “Um, yeah. It’s very good for you. Blaise taught me. It helps me sleep too, I’m exhausted at the end of the day.”
speak ill of me or of the cause ever again- swear to me.” Lucius put his hand out, gesturing for Draco to give his own.
“Let’s see how well Snape has trained you. I shall test you” Draco panicked to finish the last of his wall with the little warning he had.
But he had found the mention of meditations on 'confronting your fears and other darknesses' in one of the occlumency books. He figured they were worth a try.
“What does it look like?” Draco couldn't keep the bitter tones from his voice. “He lost his shit again”
They stared at each other, stubbornness clear in each of their faces. Draco broke and looked away, he was not in the mood nor mental space to fight.
I need you to… how do I put this? ...Get on her good side when you are at school. She’s not only smart but resourceful, and managed to consolidate a lot of power while at the Ministry. And while I still have control of her while she remains there, I cannot know how she will react when faced with the unattended power she shall have at Hogwarts. Therefore, you must get in her good graces and keep an eye on her for me.
Harry grabbed Draco and dragged him onto his own broom and Draco felt his own arms wrap around the warm body of the boy in front of him.
Like a predator getting ready to pounce, Draco watched as Goyle slowly raised his wand, a twisted smile on his face.
“Relax Pansy.” He placed a reassuring hand on her arm “You are the most stunning one in the room...I think everyone’s just a bit shocked because Granger looks respectable for once. You always look beautiful, so you’re not getting the same reaction.” She smiled gratefully at him, seemingly placated.
“Oh, well-” She had gone even redder. She needed time to process the information he had just given her. He didn’t give her that time.
He strode over to the Slytherin table, made eye contact with Pansy who was grinning at him and smiled slyly back.
“But when he hit you... when he turned that side onto you- I saw what I had so ignorantly been hiding from myself. Any love that might have still been there... left me, and I realised having no father would be better for you than having
Crabbe snarled then backed away a bit. "Your dad always told us you were just using us," Draco frowned at the mention of his father. "We never believed ‘im... but when you were so quick to discard us after you killed Dumbledore...well. Your dad wasn't so happy when he didn't have an inside source anymore."
Sighing, he reached out and grasped the handle, closing his eyes as he felt the familiar, warm, tingling sensation.
“I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,” Draco said, going along with it. “I know how to get in.”
Draco’s chest warmed with pride. Snape continued “But your father might not make that mistake, or he might find something before you are able to force him out. Keep strengthening your initial defence. And clear your mind more effectively.”
, watching as the blood slowly got sucked into nothingness. He then washed his face, gripped the side of the basing and breathed deeply.
Draco began counting off how he was doing in all of his subjects- very well in all of them, “In Charms, Ancient Runes and Transfiguration I’m second-”
Told you more would be up soon. ive just hit over 100,000 words uploaded. Thanks everyone who came back to read it.<
“IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” Weasley swooped down to them, Granger sharing his broom. And then, miraculously, they began dragging Goyle onto their broom. Draco felt the tears that were running down his face from pure gratitude dry as the flames suddenly became angrier.
Draco. You are my son and I will love you no matter what you do and I will always love who you love.”
He also knew that Unicorn hair was the most difficult cores to turn to dark magic, which is what Draco told himself was the reason he had been struggling with Bellatrix when they had moved onto dark magic. He had hoped the dual nature of the Hawthorn- which favoured both healing spells and curses would help him, but it seemed the Unicorn hair was preventing him.
The darkness seeped through the cracks it had created, and he could not stop it. Letting it back in had been a bad idea.
Ice began to creep through Draco’s veins and he began to rebuild his walls as his father’s voice slowly raised in volume “I see your feelings! I see how disgusted you are by having to kiss her. Just to
Okay so- its against Canon that Bellatrix is in this scene- I know. But I think this is one of the things the movie got right...
at me when I first said hi, y’know? But I’m not sure, he might just be playing the game really well” With that, she directed him the cabin that Crabbe and Goyle had reserved for him and found the boy Pansy had been talking about.
They reached the carriages, meaning he felt as if he could breathe. He took a large inhale, and felt a hand on his shoulder. He was ready to shove it off and tell Pansy to leave him alone when he noticed it wasn’t Pansy, but Theo.
“Just give me a second” Blaise said as he finished tied his tie. “You left so fast I didn’t have time to tell you to wait- while I grabbed my robes.” Blaise was smiling at him, but Draco didn’t smile back, he had to stop whatever
He looked up to see him mother crawling over to him. It was then that he noticed her red eye as well. His father had hit her in addition to choking her.
Draco had been up high enough on his broom to know what the muggles were after. It was a freeing feeling.
do? Apart from gather information?” Her eyes snapped to Blaise who had spoken for the first time. Her shudder-inducing grin widened.
Draco continued, struggling not to scream at her. “I know we are going to brew a Draught of Peace...Snape told me. Should be useful for tests huh?”
him. He fled to the small corner of his mind full of the good memories and better Draco, which had strong enough walls that Draco knew it would provide safety he needed and barred the entry with everything he had. Outside of himself, a strangled scream escaped his mouth.
But of course, Potter ruined it “Where’s Hagrid?” Potter asked the professor. At a poke in the back from Crabbe, Draco sighed, and seized the opportunity. He recalled the meeting he had overheard about Yaxely working with giants, and the mentioning of Hagrid being on the same journey.
Something was calling his attention, he looked down and groaned again, settling on a morning walk over a cold shower to calm things down.
“Oh Darling you look practically edible!” The words, which accompanied a squeal of delight were from Pansy, who didn't look too bad herself. She wore a dark green velvet dress which clung to her body and had black lace twining around her above the chest and down the arms. Noticing Draco looking she gave a sly smile and turned her back to him. The dress had an incredibly low cut and was held together with thin metal chains. As he got closer he realised there wasana enchanted metal snake slithering along them. Around her arms sat a black and grey fur stole, ready to be worn should they step outside.
“Um, yeah- sure” Draco agreed, inwardly hating that he was being forced to confront the last person he wanted to see.
The Hogwarts express seemed different. It could have been the Aurors prowling around the platform, or perhaps it was the tension and fear that was thick in the air.
Wow hi, thanks for reading. This is my first go at fanfiction so any comments or suggestions are welcome!
“Pay attention” Draco flicked his wand at Blaise's cauldron, “Your flame was too high, you could have ruined it”
Potter shot a stunning spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Draco’s wand out of his hand- causing it to roll out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and boxes.
“Uh Draco, you’ve got some...” Goyle pointed at the corner of his mouth. Draco swiped at his face, only to find a large glob of mashed potato.
Yeah, thanks for sticking around if you have, I'm kind of convincing myself that no one likes this fic anymore hahaha- because its gone on for too long with no romance.
Each of the store owners were not the same people that Draco remembered. They were all distant, stressed and had large bags under their eyes. Eventually, they finished their shopping, and Draco swallowed as he realised they would now have to go to Borgin and Burkes.
” he said to the nondescript part of the wall which marked the entrance to the secret passage. He slowly walked in, caught in his thoughts, only to be assaulted by a ball of robes which squealed “Draco!”
?” she had crowed delightfully, flicking her hair back dramatically as her gaggle of cronies chuckled along with her. Crabbe and Goyle followed her around like a pair of lovesick puppies, ogling her breasts as soon as they had begun to show last year and obeying her every whim. Pansy Parkinson loathed her, everyone knew that, but she also knew that it was better to be friends with the girl she was jealous of than to be her enemy and so she played the role of best girl friend very well. Blaise Zabini was the smartest in their group, dark and mysterious whilst Theodore Knott was amazingly shy for a member of Slytherin house. He was a sheep, plain and simple, and did whatever his friends did. Pike, the thug, was there as always even though no one really liked him. “You've got a father and a brother at the Ministry and you don't ever
Draco grimaced as the twins linked their arms together, smiling broadly at each other as they uncorked their vials in preparation of drinking the worryingly unstable contents.
He found Lara at one of the four sinks to the left of the bathroom door, dressed in a fluffy white bathrobe with her hair secured in an elegant towel-twist on top of her head, carefully applying a lightly scented moisturiser to her face. They smiled at one another in greeting but, as was the unwritten rule in the unisex bathroom, didn’t stop to chat with each other.
Fabian, it seemed, was being comforted by his boyfriend. He didn’t look angry or jealous, like the girls, but he was obviously disappointed. On the other JJ, his boyfriend, looked more relieved than anything else. Whether that was for himself or for his boyfriend remained to be seen. Nina offered Draco a blinding smile, truly pleased for him, even as her arm was wrapped around Adelaide who somehow managed to look pleased for Draco but sad for herself. Jan actually crossed the room to shake Draco’s hand, congratulating him whilst simultaneously offering him a flirtatious smile which was acknowledged but not returned.
Thankfully it wasn’t more than five minutes later that Draco felt his eyelids growing heavy and, rather than fighting it as he could have done to keep Ramona company until she was ready to fall back asleep, he allowed them to fall closed and in a matter of minutes he was dreaming about flying through the clouds in pursuit a snitch glinting in the perfect sunlight.
Fred’s incredulous accusation broke through the stunned silence which had fallen following the declaration, causing nearly everyone to laugh softly. Even Dumbledore chuckled deeply.
“I'm…I'm fine…just…” Neville mumbled, bringing a shaking hand up to rub at his eyes. “I just didn't sleep very well, that's all. I couldn't…I couldn't stop thinking about my…my parents…”
That hurt, like a knife to his stomach; his best friend still believed that he’d found a way to get past the age-line and had decided not to share that knowledge with anyone so that he could hold onto all of the glory himself. Hermione claimed he was jealous of the attention.
“I couldn’t have faced them knowing that Draco was unprotected,” she admitted softly, thinking of how her older sister had always been a fraction
