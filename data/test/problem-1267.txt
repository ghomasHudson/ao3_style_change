“You can,” Malfoy insisted. “This is a panic attack. You just have to breathe and it’ll be okay.”
Harry turned towards the source and immediately held back a groan. “You guys go on ahead. I’ll catch up later,” he said, passing Ron his broomstick and crossing the field towards one of the stands.
Just before his knees could hit the ground, Malfoy lunged the last few steps between them, catching Harry around the middle from behind.
McGonagall stepped past him and led the way up the stairs. Harry followed her reluctantly, feeling his heart beginning to race once again. He willed it to slow down, following her with heavy footsteps dragged down by dread.
“And you thought punching a wall would help because…?”
Harry rolled his eyes, taking a step closer. “Yeah, well, classic Slytherin helping someone without them even asking for it or wanting it,” he murmured.
“Yes, Professor?” he said, voice pulled taut with fear.
And with that, Harry spun on his heel and marched out of the room, trying to hold back another set of tears.
“But—but why?”
As a result, every year for the first few weeks of school Harry was swarmed and ogled by the new first years, all pushing and shoving to get a look at the son of everyone’s favourite Quidditch player, to see their immediate likeness and see if he was just as talented as his father. Hari lost count of just how many times people asked him to get an autograph from his father, having taken to outright ignoring anyone that asked.
“Well, you should have thought of that before you… caught your fall on the stairs,” interjected Madam Pomfrey.
Harry sighed, dropping his foot on the step again and continuing up the stairs. He heard Malfoy’s hurried footsteps behind him up the stairs. He was just about to turn the corner to use the shortcut hidden behind a tapestry of a unicorn and a knight when Malfoy grabbed his arm, pulling him to a stumbling halt.
“But I don’t want to play for either of them.”
Harry ignored them, turning and slamming the door shut behind him. His heart was faster than ever, a tight fist squeezing around his throat until he choked, his feet carrying him through the school without him even registering it. Anger and betrayal and panic were clawing their way up his throat, rumbling through his blood roaring in his ears, thoughts scattering with each frantic step. He stormed all the way up the stairs again without looking back, a swirl of emotions thundering in his ears to the time of his rapid heartbeat.
“Can I help you, Malfoy?” Harry asked, tilting his head to the side and scowling at the other boy.
Harry James Potter was the most well-known student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
often?” Harry blurted, feeling sick at the idea of feeling that way even one more time.
“Y-yeah, I’ll—be there in a minute,” Harry choked out, screwing his eyes shut.
Harry sat up, looking at Malfoy with furrowed brows. “Yeah, you said that earlier. What the hell does that mean?” he asked, feeling stupid. Of course Malfoy knew something about him that he didn’t even understand himself.
No matter how old Harry got, nothing would ever change at Hogwarts.
“Godric, don’t even remind me,” Harry groaned as they entered the Potions classroom. “My head already hurts just thinking about it.”
“Is it about how Romilda Vane is trying to spike you with Amortentia again?” enquired Ernie, pausing his direction to an affronted bishop on his chess board.
Draco snorted, shaking his head. “Classic Gryffindor. Of course you needed the most dramatic way to get help.”
“I thought you were trying to knock me out of the sky,” Malfoy admitted, cheeks slightly pink. He dropped Harry’s hand at last.
As soon as his parents and Sirius and Peter said goodbye, Harry took off across the field, trying to catch up to Malfoy before he lost sight of his blond hair in the crowd.
“God, you look so much like your mum like that,” said James, snorting. Harry continued to frown in silence and he dropped his shoulders, sighing dramatically. “Alright, so it’s not
A few weeks later, Harry was whipping through the air on his broomstick, the sun beginning to creep behind the horizon as he finished off the last of the drills with his Quidditch team before their first match coming up that weekend. It was already getting cold despite October still being a few days away, leaves falling from the trees and the wind growing unforgiving. Harry just hoped their first match against Hufflepuff would at least be dry.
“What’s wrong with you? What happened to your hand?” Malfoy asked, his voice growing high pitched with alarm.
“I didn’t want to disappoint you,” Harry admitted. “You were always so happy about how I was ‘following in your footsteps’ and getting to hang out with me and stuff. I didn’t know how to tell you how I felt.”
Harry glanced at his hand again. “I—I don’t know. I guess I’m just tired of all this pressure being put on me lately,” he explained, grimacing. “I just can’t do it anymore. Everyone expects me to be this brilliant Quidditch player and to take after my dad and he’s always trying to urge me to be as good as him. I just—I’m so tired of it. I can’t do it…” He sniffled, wiping fresh tears on the back of his dirty sleeve.
The door to the bathroom burst open behind him.
were sitting across from her. His mum was teary-eyed and clutching a hanky and his dad’s hand while James was frowning deeply at the floor with his jaw tight and his expression distant. And Malfoy? Malfoy was turned in his seat, staring guiltily up at Harry’s entrance.
Lily burst into tears immediately and James stiffened violently, inhaling sharply.
“You hate Quidditch,” said Harry and James at the same time.
Malfoy dropped his grip. “I’m s—”
“Go—away, Malfoy,” Harry gritted out, cutting himself off with a harsh sob. He hiccoughed, turning around to face Malfoy directly.
Harry looked up from his hand. Malfoy was crouched nearby, eyes on his bloody hand, bulging slightly and his face drained of colour even more than usual. His lips were pursed together in a disarming look of concern that Harry struggled to match with his school rival. Had he always been this gentle?
Harry excused himself a few minutes later with the excuse of finishing off an essay for the next day. Brushing off his friends’ various offers to join him, Harry slung his bag over his shoulder and made a b-line for the exit before anyone else could catch up.
Harry shrugged, still leaning against his knees as he hugged them to his chest, letting go of Draco again. “I think I’m dying,” he murmured against his legs. “There’s something wrong with me.”
As Harry neared, he swore Uncle Remus gave him an apologetic look while James merely grinned broader.
Harry pushed Malfoy away gently and turned, sliding down the wall and sitting with his forehead against his knees. Malfoy kneeled in front of him and Harry clutched Draco’s arms in a weak attempt to ground himself. Much like last time, he made Harry follow his lead through a series of breathing exercises until he was finally able to breathe normally, murmuring gently through Harry’s muddled thoughts.
“Have a seat, Mr. Potter,” said McGonagall, sitting in her seat behind her desk and gesturing to the empty chair between his parents.
Malfoy cocked an eyebrow, looking suspiciously down at the proffered hand. After a long, awkward moment, he reluctantly took Harry’s hand and shook it. They both lingered perhaps a bit too long, looking into each other’s eyes.
Harry shook his head, more sobs escaping him, clutching his arm to his chest. “It’s—there’s just. So. Much.
As he traipsed through the empty corridors by himself, his breathing grew ragged and his heart raced, his stomach tying itself in knots of nausea and his blood rushing in his ears like a roar of the crowds always egging him on. He was hardly aware of where he was going or what he was doing, bursting through the door of one of the boys’ lavatories just in time for him to burst into tears.
Madam Pomfrey cocked an eyebrow, pausing dousing him with dittany to give him a signature frown. Through the years, Harry had been in and out of the hospital wing countless times for a variety of Quidditch injuries, backfiring spells or silly pranks gone wrong. She joked multiple times that she ought to dedicate the space to him, seeing as she had hardly any students in there as much as Harry.
“Harry! Oh, there you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you!”
He knew he was being childish, hiding from his problems and his friends, but even the notion of seeing his friends and being reminded of his situation made him positively sick to his stomach.
As he got dressed into his Quidditch gear and the cheers and shouts from the crowd outside grew, so too did Harry’s anxiety. He felt the pressure returning in full force, filling his lungs with stones and clouding his mind with doubts and regrets. He excused himself to one of the private changing stalls, leaning against the wall and trying to get his breathing under control. He couldn’t afford to faint or punch a wall right before the match; his friends and family were all counting on him. He just needed to go through the new breathing exercises he learned from his Mindhealer (and Malfoy, but he would never admit it) and then he could go out there and everything would be fine. He just needed to—
“I heard it was the England national team,” commented Ernie.
“Well? Who’s coming?”
He paced back and forth, clenching his fists at his sides or tugging at his hair, losing all control of his breathing. He was sure he was having some sort of heart attack, vision blurring with his tears and mind spinning with panic and dread.
After the meeting with his parents and McGonagall, Harry tried to go back to normal again. In the following weeks, he went to all of his Quidditch practices and duelling club meetings with Neville, he completed all his assignments without complaint and put on a happy face as he hung out with his friends in the common room or the library or the courtyard. McGonagall was insistent that he start talking to a Mindhealer once a week via the floo in her office, to talk about his problems and his panic attacks, which was tiresome if somewhat helpful. He largely ignored Malfoy in the corridors or in classes when the blond continued to try to talk to him, but after giving him the cold shoulder multiple times, Malfoy eventually gave up and left him alone. That didn’t stop his own gaze from straying in his direction every so often, his heart heavy.
Alongside their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin, stood Harry’s dad James, dressed in one of his old England team jerseys. Despite nearing 40, James Potter was still a handsome man with his artfully messy black hair peppered with grey, stylish glasses and a cheeky grin. Beside him, Remus Lupin was also similarly handsome even with the many scars littering his body and the beginnings of grey hair already taking over his brown hair. Harry knew he was one of the most popular professors at school with his cozy jumpers and tweed jackets and his kind smile that had everyone swooning.
At the steely-eyed gaze she shot him, Harry silenced himself and resigned himself to his fate. They reached her office a minute later and she held the door open for him. Much like the night before, his parents were already sitting waiting for him, faces full of discomfort and hurt. Thankfully, there was no Malfoy this time.
“Ginny’s getting scouted by the Harpies?” interrupted Remus, raising his eyebrows. “Good for her.”
“You okay? You sound funny,” said Ron, voice full of concern.
“Of course!” said Lily, elbowing James in the side as he opened his mouth to protest. “Go ahead, love. We’ll see you in only a week for the Christmas holiday and you can tell us all about it then.”
Malfoy was on his feet in seconds. “Merlin, Potter, careful,” he chastised. “You’ve clearly lost a surprising amount of blood. Let’s just get you to the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey can fix you up.”
“I—I don’t know,” Harry blurted, crumpling at the sight of his mum crying because of him.
“But Professor—”
Harry said nothing. His stomach felt suddenly hollowed out with dread, his heart rate picking up as it thumped against his chest.
“NO!” Harry jumped to his feet. Both Malfoy and Professor Lupin jumped in surprise at his volume. “You don’t understand! I’ve
Remus sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Well, you don’t befriend James Potter, star Chaser for the fucking national Quidditch team without learning a thing or two about Quidditch, you know,” he replied pointedly, frowning at them both.
“I didn’t get a chance to thank you,” said Harry. “And to apologise, I guess.”
“Harry.”
He took another few deep breaths and then he unlocked the stall, stepping out, shaking himself off. Ron was standing outside, dressed in his Keeper gear with his broom propped on his shoulder. He frowned deeply as soon as Harry stepped out. He opened his mouth to likely ask Harry if he was okay again, but Harry brushed past him and stepped into the main area of the locker room to address his teammates.
The next day, Harry tried to pretend that everything was okay and he wasn’t falling apart inside. He went down to breakfast with his friends and forced himself to join in with their conversations with enthusiasm, laughing at jokes and making as many comments as he could. He could feel both McGonagall and Remus watching him from the teachers’ table as well as Malfoy from the Slytherin table, but he ignored them, turning himself away from them and avoiding catching their eyes.
“Just don’t steal my food again, then,” said Harry, even though he knew it was futile. “But, no, that’s not what I was thinking about. I was just distracted about the upcoming match.”
“Oh, for crying out loud, Ronald. Watch where you’re going!” Hermione Granger, another of Harry’s many friends, complained as Ron stumbled right into her in his effort to avoid Harry’s attack. She was already sagging under the weight of a pile of textbooks in her arms, despite it being only their third lesson of the day.
“What is it, Potter? Why am I being manhandled?” he complained, letting Harry drag him into a small copse of trees to the side. He pulled his arm out of Harry’s grasp, frowning at him.
“Maybe not, but I’m sure you’ll be getting even more scouts as the year goes on, Harry,” insisted James with an air of confidence Harry wished he had. “I saw the last of your practice. You’re doing great, obviously, but I think if you really start pushing yourself and working on getting the snitch even faster, you’ll have even more scouts coming for you. You might even get a national team scout!”
Just as Malfoy went to open his mouth, Harry disapparated.
After a long while of silence, Malfoy sauntered over to the bed and sat close to Harry. The air around Malfoy seemed cold to him.
Everything happened so quickly. The wizard on the right drew his wand higher. In that time, Harry noticed Malfoy’s wand on the floor, the men must have knocked it out of his hand when they walked in. As quietly and quickly as he could, Harry dived to the floor and grabbed the wand, grasping it tight before shouting “EXPELLIARMUS!”
The wizards and witch got to work instantly, all rushing off out of the room to begin their tasks.
“I hate this place. I really hate it,” said Hermione, Harry could tell she was crying. Pulling her at arm’s length, he attempted a smile.
“Oh, give over,” muttered Ron, shaking his head so vigorously his mop of ginger hair shook too. “It’s Malfoy.”
That seemed to irk Malfoy. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Malfoy stared at Harry for some time, his jaw clenched, before he began to relax. “My life is a mess, Harry,” he said. The use of Harry’s first name made his heart flutter, made him think maybe Malfoy did trust him. “Mine and Astoria’s marriage is falling apart. We’re struggling with conceiving a child. We’re hardly talking now; our conversations are one sided and that’s my fault. Things are falling apart with the manor, father’s extra cruel,” Malfoy laughed at himself. Why, after all these years, was he still afraid of his father? He was an adult now, but the anxiety still built up in him whenever he was near Lucius.
“What’s going on?” asked Harry.
There was a soft knock on Harry’s door. Expecting it to be Ron, Harry didn’t bother with throwing on a shirt, and opened the door in just his trousers. But, on the other side, was Malfoy. The swelling in his cheek had gone down, he must’ve used an elixir on it, and the cut was on its way to healed.
“No he hadn’t, that’s a shame,” smiled Harry. He always thought Mrs Weasley hadn’t forgiven him for ending things with Ginny, even though it was mutual. Even so, she still treated him like a son, and there was nothing he could be more thankful for. Especially in these dark times.
“No, I don’t think so,” replied Harry, running his fingers through his hair. “I’m not sure. I never had time to experiment with my sexuality when I was younger, I don’t really know,” he looked at Malfoy and laughed. “I’ll get you a drink.”
Harry grabbed a large stone, quickly transfiguring it into a cup before casting aguamenti.
“This means…?”
“I was. Now I’m not.”
“I’m so sorry, Mrs Weasley,” said Harry, “Draco cast a patronus.” Pulling away, Mrs Weasley looked at Draco with wide eyes, only just noticing the skinny boy was stood in the doorway.
“Yeah, Hogwarts was an odd time,” slurred Malfoy, clumsily sipping his whiskey. “I couldn’t find myself dating anyone.”
In this moment, Harry kept thinking back to when they were eleven. Malfoy’s outstretched hand, a smarmy grin spread across his mouth, attempting to make friends with one of the most famous kids in the Wizarding World. Though seemingly smug, there was an innocence to Malfoy then. He was only a boy, who just wanted to be Harry’s friend, who didn’t know any better than what his father had taught him for those eleven years he had been in the isolated environment. Harry remembered back to their conversation all those months ago, down in the basement with the dark artefacts. Malfoy had been such a lonely child, he’d had no friends growing up, and even when he made them, he felt as though they were only using him.
“Rye?” asked Harry, looking at the few pictures that decorated the page.
“Who?” asked one of the other ministry members.
Malfoy had been buying Harry firewhiskeys all night. It was a busy night in the pub, there were a few familiar faces there too. Seamus and Dean, who were now an out and proud couple, kissed in the corner of the room. Harry remembered when they came out. They’d been secretly seeing each other throughout the whole of their Hogwarts years, but they were too nervous to tell anyone and tried to deny their feelings. Years later, they allowed people to know, just before Lucius had taken over. Dean had ended up working for Blaise Zabini’s family at their manor, so Seamus and Dean could only see each other on the weekends. But they made it work, and Harry thought they were very sweet. He always admired their courage to be out and proud, to be themselves, to not feel the fear of anyone judging them.
Even so, that didn’t stop him from excusing himself from Narcissa to spend time with Malfoy in secret. Although, Narcissa knew, and she was very accepting of it. Whether Malfoy had told her about them Harry didn’t know, but he was thankful all the same.
The situation flooded bad memories back into his mind. He could feel the fear seventeen-year-old Harry felt when he was tracking down the horcruxes. Every noise that was made in the burrow had him in a fearsome frenzy, listening out more, waiting for someone to barge into the attic and steal him. The release of the breath when he heard Mrs Weasley’s voice after a creak, or seeing George enter the attic just so he wasn’t lonely.
Malfoy watched with eyes wide as the wolf circled the men, sniffing the area around them, before it disappeared. Malfoy had lost his concentration of the memory due to the shock of being able to produce a patronus, watching the wolf walk around so casually.
Malfoy took a few moments to answer, but his breath hitched when Harry asked the question.
“Over the past few days, we have been given evidence of your illegal activity.”
“Live a little!” Malfoy looked back up at the sky and began to laugh. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d heard Malfoy laugh, not even in Hogwarts. He was always cracking the jokes but didn’t seem to laugh at many. His laugh sounded beautiful, Harry thought, the way it bellowed from his stomach. Even being drowned out by the rain Harry could still hear it, and it was infectious. Beginning to laugh too, Harry looked up at the sky, watching the lightning streak across in forks.
“Do you think…” said Ron, staring at the black wooden doors.
“Yeah, of course,” said Harry, walking over to him. “Right now?”
“Oh?” Mrs Weasley sat opposite.
Malfoy stood at the door of his office, leaning on the doorframe, arms folded. “What are you pottering about for, Weasley?”
Harry’s stomach churned again. No. Not now. This wasn’t the time.
“What is it, Draco?” asked Harry, stopping him from entering.
“There’s no proof you’re not.”
Malfoy remained silent as he headed towards the exit of Knockturn Alley, towards Diagon Alley.
Malfoy turned, and for the first time Harry noticed the dark circles under his eyes. “Astoria and I got into a fight this morning. She thinks it was wrong of me to get drunk with you last night. She wants me to be home whenever I can, trying to make a child. She desperately wants a little boy. So do I. I tried to tell her I’m allowed to go out and have some fun. She responded with I shouldn’t be having fun with the staff,” that comment hurt Harry. Was that also what Malfoy thought of him, as staff? Someone who once his task is done, isn’t needed anymore? Someone so easily replaceable?
Malfoy took a few moments to respond. “No,” he finally said, looking down at the floor. “Maybe some help with tidying up.”
“We can certainly try,” said Harry, resting his head against the wall. “And look. My hangover stopped your panic attack,” he chuckled.
“One room for everyone,” replied Draco, making George laugh. “How are you, George?”
In a groggy haze, Harry heard his door open and shut. He tried to look to see who it was but could only see a blurry figure. One eye was swollen shut and his lip had been cut open, his nose had definitely cracked out of place. The pain was unbearable, and after attempting to lift his head, he had to put it back on his blood-soaked pillow.
“Oh, I will, Mr Malfoy,” Caractacus started doing the maths for the money. Thankfully, it was a lot more than Draco was expecting. His father would be very pleased about that.
“I can also issue you with protection from the organisation, too, to ensure your safety. I’d also like you to be involved, to help with the planning of taking my father down. Your work in the Order was exceptional and obviously proved to be successful,” said Draco.
“Hello everyone,” called a voice from behind. Turning round in his seat, Harry saw a tall, slender figure and a mass of orange hair.
Harry took in his surroundings. The air felt clean and fresh as he breathed in, letting the smell of wet ground fill his nostrils.
“Why are we here?”
“We know you’re up to your dirty tricks again, Malfoy, you and your whole family.” This wizard had jet black hair which was slicked down in a combover. He wore a suit, not a very posh one, in a navy blue, which was the same as the other two wizards.
“Hi, Mrs Malfoy,” responded Hermione.
“Oh, Harry,” sighed Hermione, placing a hand on his and giving it a squeeze. “You’ve gotten through something like this before, remember? It felt like there would never be an end when we were seventeen. It all worked out in the end.”
After a few hours, it certainly looked more homely. Cluttered, but homely. Harry would have to get used to it.
“Ah, yes,” Lucius said coolly, rising from his desk. He waved his wand quickly, which made the doors slam shut behind Harry, causing him to jump. “Draco, my son, why don’t you go and stand in the corner. Potter, come here.”
“How are things at the manor?” asked George as he began a game of chess with Ron.
Toward the end of the evening, a few of the guests had gone home. The others were tipsy or drunk from the champagne they had consumed, including Malfoy and Astoria.
“To the Three Broomsticks. We need to get you drunk,” said Malfoy, before grabbing Harry’s hand and disapparating with a pop.
After spending an hour in the coffee shop, having two coffees, and listening to muggle conversations, he decided to go home. He found a private corner, away from any muggles, and apparated. Suddenly he was back in his living room. The feeling of apparating never got better, it always made Harry’s stomach churn. He remembered back to the first time he apparated, a side-along apparition with Professor Dumbledore. The feeling made Harry extremely queasy and it happened so quick. Nowadays, he apparated often, it was such an easy mode of transport to him. But, if he could floo somewhere, he’d pick that over apparition any day.
“Well?” asked Malfoy.
“You sure as hell made it seem like it,” spat Harry. Malfoy turned and glared at him, and instantly he knew he had messed up.
Harry looked around, ensuring no one was near, before pulling out his wand. With a quick flick, his canal boat came into view as he undid the cloaking spell. The same as Ryan, Harry owned a narrowboat as Ryan had told him how good they were for the London canals. Harry’s was a deep green colour, with gold detailing all around.
Once they had set sail, Harry joined Ryan on the deck. Ryan even let Harry take control of the boat, ensuring it didn’t veer off course, while he made them cups of tea. They both sat, the sun warming their bodies up, sipping tea on the deck.
Malfoy paused again. “You seem like you want to continue that sentence.” His eyes studied Harry. The way his fists clenched weakly, the way his breathing was staggered, how he couldn’t look Malfoy in the face.
“You must be too,” said Blaise from across the table.
But then it became brighter, and brighter, until Harry realised it was no longer the moon. Looking to his side, he noticed a silver ball of light flickering. Frowning, he slowly sat up, trying to figure out what it was. For a split second, he could see an ear of an animal, but then the light disappeared completely.
After dinner, and after the children had gone to bed, the many bodies all sat around the fire on the sofas. Harry and Draco sat together, Draco’s head resting on Harry’s chest, tucked underneath his chin. He was certain Draco could hear his heart beating quickly, because for the first time in so long, he felt excited. Excited to have this beautiful man curled into him, in front of the people he calls family.
Harry poured himself a glass, which he very nearly spilled all over him when he saw a figure move in by him. For a moment, he thought the figure resembled Malfoy and his heart leapt from his chest, until he realised it was George.
“Interesting? Since when do you find muggles interesting?”
Sharing all of this with other people had lifted a huge weight off Draco’s shoulders. The pressure wasn’t solely focused on him now, though it still remained that way when he was to return to the manor.
“Better,” replied Harry as he rinsed his brush under the faucet, “although I haven’t seen him for a while. Haven’t you?”
He had never felt so safe in his entire life.
“Just tired, Sunday’s shift has worn me out still,” lied Harry, shooting them a small smile to try and stop the couple from worrying. “I need an early night.”
“Okay,” he whispered, his voice strained.
“Are you looking forward to going home, Harry?” Asked Hermione, an attempt at changing the subject. Of course he was, Harry thought. There was nothing better than the weekends when he can sleep in his own, comfortable bed, his wand by his side. The days he can use magic, floo himself to the Leaky Cauldron and have a butterbeer with Ron and Hermione. Every day he missed his apartment, even if it wasn’t luxurious, even if it wasn’t a sweet homely cottage he had always dreamed of.
“It’s true, Malfoy,” the man said, rather firmly.
Both men flopped down onto the bed, soft giggles escaping Draco’s plump lips.
“Potter,” Malfoy started, “I need you to work tomorrow as well.”
“I will take you to Lucius and win the reward.” The man began stampeding towards him, and without a second thought, Harry disapparated.
“Here you are,” smiled Mr Weasley, handing Harry a glass of whiskey, snapping him out of his thoughts.
Draco helped out in Hogwarts from time to time, sometimes covering the Potions classes, and would teach a few Defence Against the Dark Arts classes for his occlumency skills.
Harry had been helping set up the hall in which the party would be held. Green curtains hung on the floor to ceiling windows, the long table was decorated in a dark green velvet table cloth, candles decorated the top of the table and to put a Hogwarts twist on things, Malfoy enchanted candles to float in the air like the great hall. There was even a dark green rolled out carpet that ran through the middle of the hall.
“This is the closest thing we’ll get to an anti-drunk potion,” said Harry light-heartedly as he poured Malfoy a cup. Attempting to be careful, Malfoy took hold of the cup and slowly sipped the coffee, grimacing when he realised it was a black coffee.
“Make yourself at home,” said Ryan, gesturing to the place, “I need to release the rope,” and he climbed back up. Harry just looked around, taken aback at how beautiful the boat was. He sat on the sofa, staring out of the window at the rising sun as the boat gently bobbed up and down.
“Ginny wanted children, too,” said Harry, playing with the rim of his coffee cup with his finger. “Two. A boy and a girl. But our relationship didn’t work out. Same sort of situation, there were things I hadn’t fully realised when I was younger. My childhood didn’t really leave room for me to discover myself, it left me feeling lost…” Harry trailed off, shaking his head with a small smile curling his thin lips. “Sorry, I’m getting personal.”
“You miss it, don’t you?” Whispered Malfoy. “Hogwarts.”
Slowly, Draco pulled himself to his feet.
It was brave of him, Harry had thought as he watched his love, to face the place it happened.
“You have been leaving the manor unprotected, without my permission, to sell
“George,” said Harry gently before placing a hand on top of George’s.
Harry heard in his head,
“Continue the communications. If you send another three red ribbons, we will have to put you in hiding,” one of the men explained, to which Malfoy didn’t respond. Then, Harry heard a pop, signifying they had disapparated.
“I told you to sit,” interrupted Malfoy, pointing to the chairs that businessmen usually sat on while waiting to see him. Slowly Harry managed to sit down, his whole body trembling from the throbbing pain in his cheek. He was sure it had started bleeding again from him talking, but he didn’t want to be seen as weak. He didn’t want Malfoy to laugh at him.
“How are you here? Aren’t you-“
“I need you to teach me how to form a patronus charm.”
“It’s me. We fell asleep. I don’t know what time it is but it’s early. We need to go back to the manor.”
“Thank you,” responded Harry, taking a long drink from it. The alcohol burned his throat but brought warmth to his body instantly.
Malfoy and Harry looked at each other nervously before Malfoy headed towards the corner of the room. The room seemed to spin as Harry stepped towards Lucius, who peered down at him with evil eyes.
After getting himself dressed, Harry decided to go to Ron and Hermione’s. Hermione always made the best cup of tea, and that’s exactly what Harry needed right now. Not trusting himself to disapparate in his current state, Harry made his way through the manor to floo himself to the couple’s house.
Though Harry felt he hated Malfoy’s guts, he realised that his life must be tough. Everything he went through while they were at Hogwarts, for starters, then having to take over the Manor. He remembered Hermione telling him and Ron that Astoria was having problems conceiving, and he wondered if this was a big reason as to why Malfoy was so irritable. But Malfoy was always irritable, wasn’t he? Harry couldn’t help but wonder why. He had a beautiful wife, he was richer than any wizard Harry knew, he finally got what he wanted and had all Muggleborns and Half-Bloods now unable to do magic during the week. Why did he seem so… Lonely?
“George tried to kill himself,” Ron had just about managed to cry out. Harry still remembers what he felt when he heard those words. Cold, as if his blood had turned to ice, his entire body tingling with pins and needles. His stomach had churned, he didn’t know whether he was going to be sick or pass out. This was all his fault, he remembered himself thinking, this was all his fault.
“I haven’t heard that,” Mr Weasley responded. “And I’d know if he was.”
Draco’s hands shook as he held the cup, and he wasn’t able to hold it for very long in fear the tea would spill. After a few moments, a wave of nausea overcame Draco. His eyes darted to Harry’s in panic, and Harry could tell something was wrong. Suddenly, Draco shot up, knocking the chair over with force and ran to the sink, throwing up the small amount of contents in his stomach.
Silently, Harry ran his finger down the marking, making Malfoy’s hair stand on end. Then, he pulled Malfoy’s arm towards him, and gently pressed his lips against the dark mark. Malfoy closed his eyes, feeling every sensation it gave him. Sparks shot through his arm; the dark mark felt alive again, but not as it did before. This time, it did not hurt. Instead, it felt warm, it felt as though it was filling Malfoy’s veins with love.
But the more Harry thought about it, the dizzier his thoughts were and the churning feeling in his stomach returned. He got up and headed down the many flights of stairs that held the burrow up. Water was what he needed, and maybe some fresh air.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” asked Harry. As he looked down at his cup of tea, he noticed his hands were shaking.
“Draco-”
Filled with anger and annoyance, Harry floo’d himself to Malfoy Manor at 10:50am. He was met by one of the weekend staff, who accepted his identification. Sometimes he wished he was one of the staff who were at the front of the house, they were able to use magic to identify everyone who came into the Manor. But no, of course he had to have the job where he stood for twelve hours a day, outside Malfoy’s office, serving him food and leaving his wand at home.
“Harry. Harry Potter. No, I haven’t. It’s lovely,” responded Harry, having another sip of tea which was slowly sobering him up.
Draco stood from the table and walked to an empty space. Placing something down on the floor, he took out his wand and gave it a tap. He felt shocked the Weasley’s didn’t even blink when he pulled his wand, and part of him wanted to cry from the emotion it brought him. But he didn’t, what he had to say was far more important.
“Yes sir,” said Harry in a serious voice, which made the corner of Malfoy’s lip curl up in a smile.
The wand flew from the wizard’s hand. Harry got himself up, pointing Malfoy’s wand at them. “I’d suggest you leave. Now.”
“Lucius wants to see you. Both you and Mr Malfoy,” said Seamus quickly. “It doesn’t seem good.”
“He’s not,” said Harry reassuringly, “he’s just very tired.”
Grabbing his wand, the three wizards quickly scurried out of the room. After all these years, people were still afraid of Harry Potter. Besides, he defeated the Dark Lord.
“It won’t,” said Harry, “I’ll make sure of it.”
“You haven’t been able to have lunch yet, Potter. Can’t have you fainting like you’ve seen a dementor on me,” there was a twinkle in Malfoy’s eyes as he said that and a smirk attempted to pull at his lips, but he controlled it. Harry looked back down at the soup, also trying his best not to smile, before picking up the spoon and beginning to eat. He heard Malfoy sigh and looked back up, seeing him with his head in his hands.
“I politely disagree,” said Malfoy, and that was the end of that conversation. They continued walking through the manor until they reached Malfoy’s office. For a while, Malfoy rummaged through some papers until he pulled out a guide to English towns and flicked it open, looking for a certain page.
“No, sir,” said Harry. “I’m putting my foot down. I’m doing what you’re paying me to do. Keeping you safe,” Harry grabbed onto Malfoy’s arms and tugged him off the seat. Malfoy attempted to break free, but at that moment was too weak. Defeated, Malfoy allowed Harry to pull him out of the Leaky Cauldron.
Suddenly feeling overwhelmed, Harry made his excuses and left the room, heading straight for the bathroom and locking himself in. Tears stung his eyes as he stared at himself in the mirror. There was a lump in his throat that hurt him to breathe, and his chest felt tight.
“I can’t now!”
“Mm,” Malfoy continued watching Harry, who shuffled on his seat uncomfortably, trying to avoid his stare. “Sometimes, on rare occasion, I see why you had lots of friends back at Hogwarts. But, if you tell anyone I just said that, you’ll be at the workhouses before you can cast Expelliarmus for the umpteenth time.”
Malfoy moved quickly; he always had done. His walk was sleek, it was almost as if he was floating along. The confidence shone in him; it was as if he knew exactly where he was going at all times of the day. This had been the same as when he was in Hogwarts. Even lost, Malfoy walked with confidence, his chin raised and staring straight ahead. Something about this Harry admired in him.
“I’m sorry,” whispered Malfoy with an embarrassed smile.
“What?”
Struggling to tie his tie, Harry stared at himself in the mirror. The scar on his forehead showed through his hair. Though all his features were the same as before, Harry felt as though he didn’t recognise himself, the person staring back at him was a stranger. A lot had happened since the battle of Hogwarts.
Draco gestured to the ribbons. “We’d tie them to owl’s feet or tie them onto the parchment we sent for generic letters. No one has suspected anything, as we’ve managed to make it look as though the ribbons are used for practical purposes. There are meanings to them all.
spending time with Draco Malfoy?”
Harry finally made it back to the manor. Malfoy had given him the rest of the day off, so he was able to just crawl into bed. Though, as soon as his head hit the pillow, bad thoughts whirred round. All he could think about was George, being in that place, having to talk through his emotions every day. Having to talk about losing his twin, his sidekick, his everything. Groaning loudly, Harry decided to get up and wander about the manor, something he was thankfully allowed to do on his days off. He always made sure to avoid the areas that were restricted to him, he didn’t want to get into trouble, and most of the time he just walked along the staff quarters.
“He’s hungover,” she explained, which made Ron laugh.
“Expecto patronum,” said Draco, holding his wand out confidently and steadily. Nothing. Not even a beam of light.
“Absolutely fascinating,” said Mr Weasley in awe. “But what do you need us to do?”
“Do you think he heard us?” Whispered Ron, a worried look on his face. All Harry could do in response was laugh.
“Stupefy!” all the ministers said at once, making Lucius fly back and hit the wall. But, the spell was already cast.
Harry could barely remember that year. It was such a blur, and his alcohol dependency didn’t help. Turning eighteen, being the boy who actually did kill Voldemort, along with losing so many people he loved in just one night took its toll. But one morning after a long night of drinking, he ended up among a canal in the London countryside. The sun was just about to rise, and the streets were silent, aside from one man named Ryan. It was a brief friendship, but Harry held it dear to his heart.
“I’m not sure,” replied Malfoy, running his bony fingers through his blonde hair. “It’s hard to trust anyone nowadays.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see Malfoy watching him. His expression was… Different. As always, his mouth lay flat, but there was something in his eyes that Harry couldn’t quite figure out. Attempting to avoid eye contact, Malfoy looked at the table, and started to pick at the skin on his knuckles.
Malfoy then flopped down on Harry’s bed, still giggling to himself, resting one hand on his stomach while the other was tucked behind his head.
“Oh,” said Harry suddenly, looking down to the ground, his mouth sitting in the same shape.
“Where have you been?”
the poster read,
This is it.
“You were in a state, Mal- sir,” Harry corrected himself quickly. “I won’t ask why. I don’t know why I was worried, to be truthful.”
Harry wandered around the quiet town, looking at the shops that were starting to open. They were all very quaint, it reminded him somewhat of Wales, and he knew he would have to come back here sometime. Maybe bring Ron, Hermione and their kids, he thought, they’d like that very much.
It seemed to be some kind of citizens advice meeting, but Harry wasn’t too sure, it had been so long since Harry had been in the real world and had to face real problems. Everything was so hidden to the Muggleborns and Half-Bloods.
“True. But when isn’t he quiet, really? You’d think he’d be happy that his father is running the Wizarding World. You’d think he’d be happy that Muggleborns and Half-Bloods are tortured.”
“I’m not… Your butler… Anymore…” Harry said through intakes of breath from the pain in his ribs.
“What in Merlin’s name is that supposed to mean?”
“Oh yeah, now that they’re the most powerful wizards in the Wizarding World?” said Ron sarcastically, rolling his eyes. “We’re dirt on their shoes.”
Stomach churning, Harry apparated into the dark room. With a flick of his wand, all the lights switched on, and he saw his familiar apartment. Though, it brought him no comfort, only a faint feeling of misery. Knowing Malfoy wouldn’t be able to follow him here, he realised this would be his best bet.
“Of course,” Harry walked in front of her and knocked gently on the door. As he opened it, he saw Draco, lay in the bed. Today was a bad day. “Draco,” said Harry, “you have a visitor.”
“Just in case.” Harry could feel the anxiety build up inside him. He still hadn’t forgotten what happened to him after he and Malfoy had disappeared to the loch. Sometimes his ribs still ached, the bruises were only just beginning to fade.
Harry got up and walked out of the office before turning round, his brows knitted together in a frown. “Malfoy?”
Excitedly, Harry set out to the canal. There was nothing he missed more than boating. He’d picked up the hobby after he’d left Hogwarts, becoming interested when he had made a friend who sailed.
Two days after his arrival at the burrow, he entered the kitchen to a panicked Mr and Mrs Weasley.
“Harry?” Malfoy was shocked, but Harry didn’t respond to him. Slowly, he understood, and squeezed Harry’s hand tighter.
After packing away the plates and washing up, it was now time for the butlers to have their breakfast. They all sat in the Manor’s kitchen with the cooks, eating eggs and toast. This was one of Harry’s favourite times of the day, because they were all together and they knew they had some time to themselves.
“I wish I could have my wand,” grumbled Ron as they stood outside the office. “I miss magic so much in the week.”
“I’m fine, Potter,” snapped Malfoy.
“We’re here,” said Malfoy, stepping out of the elevator. Harry just about managed to stumble after him, his head now spinning with every movement he made.
“Don’t leave me,” said Malfoy to Harry, who was now looking back down at him.
It took a lot of strength from him, and as soon as he reappeared with a pop, he cried out in pain. His chest and arm burned from the hex and he had to take a few moments to calm himself down. Lifting up his shirt, he looked at his torso. A deep purple mark decorated it, looking almost like a bruise. It wasn’t serious, it was supposed to be enough to harm Harry for a limited amount of time while the attacker grabbed him. But, of course, Harry was too clever and too strong for that. Sometimes, he thought, people must forget that he defeated Lord Voldemort.
After breakfast, all the butlers and maids got to work doing their duties. Harry and Ron mostly stood by Malfoy’s office, somehow ensuring his safety and also being there if he needed anything, like water. The pair had originally had some Auror training before Lucius took over the ministry, which was why Malfoy had assigned them and a few others to be outside his office, depending on who was on shift.
“I wish I wasn’t,” replied Harry as they made their way back to the kitchen area of their home. Both Mr and Mrs Weasley had spent so many months rebuilding their home after it got burned down all those years ago. Ron and Harry had helped of course, and it was back to the way it was before, if not better.
Draco couldn’t help but pace around the burrow. His heart pounded so hard in his chest he swore it was about to burst out.
With a pop, he apparated.
“Why not?” Asked Harry curiously, which caused a sigh of frustration from Malfoy as he made his way to a large bookshelf.
Maybe Narcissa would be glad to be rid of Lucius. Harry hoped, at least.
“Oh, how I’ve missed you,” he softly spoke to his bed. His own bed. At his own apartment. Harry did not want to move now; he never did at the weekends. But, he had plans to meet up with some friends at the Leaky Cauldron, so his bed would have to wait until tonight.
“You will do, Draco,” Harry spoke softly to him. Slowly Malfoy’s eyes opened again, and his silver eyes stared at Harry’s green ones.
love to her.”
“You were so…
“What was your memory?” asked Harry nosily. Smiling, Malfoy looked at Harry’s eager face. His body still felt warm as the memory only slightly lingered.
“Perfect,” sighed Harry, the irritation dripping in his voice. Switching off the shower, he grabbed his towel and dried himself off before stepping out. Grinning at Harry, Ron grabbed his towel and walked over to the shower himself.
Pulling away after a few moments, Harry’s green eyes desperately searched the icy grey ones that glimmered in front of him.
Malfoy swallowed. “No,” he answered. “We’re not on the best of terms.”
Malfoy sat on his office chair, head in his hands, sobbing. Louder than Harry had ever heard him sob. There was a pool of blood and tears sitting on his desk. His knuckles were, too, dripping with blood.
“Oh yes, I’ll have to see if I can risk losing a member of my staff,” said Malfoy, his voice slightly raised. He seemed to be panicking.
He walked round the large table, slowly filling up the glasses that sat there. Then, he approached an old enemy. Blonde hair, grey eyes and pale skin. Draco Malfoy.
“Now, I heard you two had a little field trip, is that right?” said Lucius through gritted teeth. Harry didn’t respond, but his breathing hitched and became staggered. “We were all incredibly worried as to where you had gotten to. Astoria had gone out of her mind, searching the manor, calling out Draco’s name. Now, why in the name of Salazar do you think you can go around, taking my son here, there and everywhere, without telling anyone else, hmm?”
“It’s just, today’s a visiting day for George. Stupid place only allows people to visit in the week. I was hoping to floo myself there during staff dinner and see him for half an hour maybe, but I think it’ll be too late.” Ron looked at Harry. There was a desperate look in his eyes, his face was scrunched up as if he was in pain. Harry knew how much Ron had wanted to see George, but he hadn’t been able to ever since he was admitted to the mind healing facility. There was only visitation once a week and Ron hadn’t been able to go to any of them.
Ron had floo’d himself to Harry’s house one night, at around three in the morning. He’d shook Harry awake, tears and snot dribbling down his face.
“If it is okay, sir, I’d like to use the burrow as a meeting point and a place to receive my ribbons. Harry accidentally walked in on a meeting once, and it made me realise it’s far too risky to have my meetings at the manor.”
“They
The door opened and Hermione’s beautiful face peeked round. “Harry!” She called, opening the door wider.
But Draco stood still. His eyes were tightly shut, expecting any moment for him to drop dead onto the marble floor. As he opened his eyes, he saw the ministers all rushing over to an unconscious Lucius to arrest him. Looking to the side of him, he saw his mother, her eyes wide, hand clasped over her mouth in horror.
“No, Mrs Malfoy, please,” said Harry, but she shook her head to stop him.
“I have an hour appointment every day. It’s not too bad here, I’m better than I was at home, at least.”
“Do you mind if I take off my jumper?” asked Malfoy, frowning at Harry.
“Father-” began Malfoy but was cut off. In front of everyone, his mother and wife, all of the butlers and maids from the morning staff, Lucius slammed the metal snake head of his cane across Malfoy’s cheekbone, slicing it open. Astoria nearly screamed, clasping her hands over her mouth as she watched in horror. The staff all cowered; terrified Lucius would take his anger out on them next.
Harry realised now, in despair but also a thrill of excitement, that Draco Malfoy was the one.
“I’m not in the mood, George,” said Harry, but the light didn’t go away. It got closer to him, and he swore this time he could see two eyes peering at him. But again, the light flickered, and went out.
Either way, Harry smiled whenever George did, and wanted to be there to support Ron.
“I think maybe it’s best we think about changing your position,” Malfoy said, his smile quickly fading and his eyebrows furrowing into a frown. “I need someone with as quick reflexes as yours to be somewhat of a bodyguard for me.”
Though, it was as if Lucius didn’t know his wife one bit. Instead, she had Harry help her with her tasks. These ranged from gardening, to cooking, and even to organising the threads for her as she embroidered. Narcissa tried to avoid using magic for lots of her hobbies. She had told Harry, “it’s taking all the fun out of it. Besides, I see it as cheating.” So, she embroidered with thread and needles, she gardened with shovels and spades, she cooked with wooden spoons and measuring jugs.
“I’d never have imagined being in the Weasley’s home,” said Draco, looking around with a smile he failed to hide, “it’s actually nicer than I expected.”
“It’s medicinal,” said Hermione with a small grin.
Blood boiling, Harry pulled out his wand he now kept concealed in his jacket and pointed it at Malfoy.
“So, what is it you do now, Draco?” questioned Pansy as the butlers swung into action, serving food. Harry was serving the wine.
“We should. I’ll apparate us back,” said Harry. Nodding, Malfoy gripped onto Harry’s hand harder, and they disapparated with a pop.
As he stepped, he noticed a note on his floor. The pain was immense as he bent down to pick it up, but it was no match to the sudden queasy feeling in his stomach as he read the note.
“Don’t apologise. I know it’s scary. Do you want a cup of tea?”
And he looked the most peaceful Harry had ever seen him.
“Doesn’t matter. You saved me,” his lips curled upwards. Was this Malfoy smiling? Harry hadn’t seen that in years, not since Malfoy had been in the Inquisitorial Squad.
“I like the sound of the water. It makes me feel safe. The sound of running water. I can’t explain it, but it relaxes me. It’s almost as if the water’s my friend, I can talk to it and it will reply with its noises.”
But Harry was there, holding Draco tightly, breathing, living, okay. The pain shot through Draco like bullets, piercing his heart with every sob he released.
“Malfoy was quiet,” Ron commented, shovelling scrambled eggs into his mouth.
“Come on, Malfoy, we need to apparate back to the manor,” said Harry. Malfoy didn’t respond, he just continued looking at the sky, a smile growing on his plump lips. “Sir!”
“Dismissed,” responded Malfoy coldly. Nodding, Harry walked himself out of the room and stood next to Ron, posing himself in their usual, and muscle-aching, position of arms behind their back.
“You do not call me Malfoy, you only call me sir,” he spat. “How dare you swear at me, how dare you attempt to question what goes on. I can easily find another bodyguard and have you sent to the workhouses. You should be wishing yourself lucky, Potter.”
Draco watched Harry, who slept peacefully in his bed. Though exhausted, Draco couldn’t find himself switching off. The room had been cast with a protection and noise cancelling spell to ensure Harry’s safety.
“It seems you’re the only person who can open the door to me, Potter,” said Malfoy after a while. He turned back around to face Harry, giving him a small smile, something Harry couldn’t remember seeing on him since their fifth year at Hogwarts.
“All the time,” he said finally. They continued to be in each other’s company in silence, while Malfoy carefully cleaned Harry’s face. Just the gesture of Malfoy helping him made Harry’s eyes fill with tears. This man, years ago, would have laughed at Harry getting injured. Probably would have helped inflict it, too. But now, instead, he was tending to Harry’s wounds.
“I think you’ve had too much to drink,” said Harry with a smile, in attempt to seem kind. “I’ll help you back.”
Harry thought back to his time at Hogwarts as he watched Malfoy throw more sticks into the loch. He wondered what it would have been like if he and Malfoy had become friends that first year. Would Malfoy have become a Death Eater? Would Harry have become a Death Eater? Would he have been able to help Draco, take him away from the toxicity in his life and help him start fresh? Would the London Wizarding World be how it is now, with Lucius as the minister? The questions whirled around his head one after the other, completely deafening him. He attempted to shake them off, but he was unsuccessful.
Malfoy didn’t answer. Harry quickly caught onto the fact Malfoy hadn’t told Astoria about the loch and didn’t want to. It was his safe space, where he could go to escape everything in his life. Telling Astoria now would destroy that privacy from him.
“Am I? Or are you?” Harry’s face was red with anger now. He had no idea what came over him, what made him suddenly so furious with the beautiful figure that sat before him, but he couldn’t help himself. “You rely on me so often. It’s as if you can’t live without me by your side. How do you think that makes me feel? Am I going to have to look after you forever?”
The large doors opened, and the cooks came through with breakfast foods. The smell made Harry’s mouth water, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to eat anything for a while. Attempting to distract himself, Harry looked around the dining room. The dining table was large, for such a small family it seemed odd. The dark oak wood table stretched at least ten metres, which could easily house a large party, but it never did. The fireplace crackled quietly behind the end chair.
But George didn’t want to see anyone. All he did was stare at the walls, hands in his lap, and Harry swore he wasn’t blinking either. They all attempted to talk to him, but he kept his lips tight together, ignoring everything they were saying. He didn’t even react when a healer walked in and checked him over.
“Very funny.” He slumped down into his chair, watching Harry put his wand back in his pocket. “I don’t have anyone to talk to but you. How funny is that?”
“Your favourite time,” chuckled Hermione, who was sat in between her children.
I told you this,” said Hermione, looking around the room at the bodies of people who were all too busy to notice the three’s conversation, chatting to each other and enjoying the food. The only good part of working at Malfoy Manor was that the food was delicious. It may have been a hard job, but the Malfoys always made sure their staff was fed properly. Those were Narcissa’s rules. If Lucius had it his way, they’d be eating beans and bread, but Narcissa insisted they had meals that were similar to those they ate at Hogwarts.
“Draco,” said Harry gently, placing a hand on his.
After getting himself ready, Harry met up with Ron and headed to the dining room for the usual breakfast. All the butlers and maids stood, waiting for the Malfoys to enter. And they did, one by one as usual, but Malfoy seemed out of sorts today. His hair wasn’t as pristine as it usually was, and there were dark circles under his eyes, darker than normal. Harry noticed Lucius walked with his chin cocked higher, he seemed to be more confident. Not that he never was, but today was different. Today felt very off to Harry.
“I just needed to talk to you for a moment.”
“Harry,” said Ron quietly as Harry had gotten lost in thought again. It was very nearly time for breakfast and there was no way he could deal with another beating from Lucius if he spilled water on him or did anything wrong. But Harry was so tired, all he wanted to do was crawl back in bed and pretend this day didn’t exist.
“It really makes you think about everything,” said George after a long moment of quiet.
“What with?”
“Sorry.”
“You know exactly what we are talking about,” stated the German minister.
“Where do you go on your days off?” asked Malfoy, taking the towel from Harry.
The stars that twinkled extraordinarily bright.
“What are you doing?”
Looking around his apartment for the last time, he felt a few tears threaten to fall. Although he hated the apartment, it held memories here, memories with Ginny, Ron, Hermione, their kids. Harry didn’t know if he’d ever see this apartment again. After switching off the lights, he grabbed some floo powder.
Seamus rushed over to Harry, who was now stood outside Malfoy’s office.
“Where will he end up?” Draco’s voice was small as he spoke.
“Alright, goodnight,” said Ron. Hermione stood up and wrapped her arms around Harry, she always gave him a hug before they went off to their rooms. The hugs always felt Hermione didn’t know whether they’d see each other again the next day. Which, in the past, was definitely something they risked every day. It was hard to let go of that, even so many years later, the trauma still resided in all of them. Especially with Lucius now in charge, he could easily change the rules and make it so Hermione would be sent away, which terrified her to no end.
Harry was about to settle in front of the fire now the rain hard started, reading a book, when there was a knock on his door. Finding this odd, he got up to go and answer. It couldn’t be Hermione or Ron; they’d both be at work by now. Mrs Weasley, possibly, as she was always popping over to see how Harry was and to give him some company when he was back from Hogwarts. She still treated him like a son.
“Merlin, that must be torture,” said George before hitting his fist softly against the table as one of Ron’s pawns smashed into his.
“And how exactly have you obtained this information?” asked Lucius in a mocking tone. A silence was held for a few moments, before Draco stepped forward.
He’d gotten better since then, or so Harry thought, but seeing him now made Harry think something bad was going on with George.
“Draco,” replied Harry.
“I’m fine here,” slurred Malfoy.
“No,” replied Draco, beginning to pace again. But Harry ignored him and walked over to the teapot, giving it a tap with his wand to boil the water inside. He made the tea and poured one for Draco, putting in one sugar.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” said Harry.
“Mate, it was extremely risky, you doing this,” said Ron with a shake of his head, “Lucius is absolutely furious.”
Harry almost couldn’t believe what he was reading. There had always been a huge conspiracy around Lucius’ reign, how he had managed to remain out of Azkaban all these years after being one of the most loyal Death Eaters. No one could ever think of how he had done it, but Harry had definitely heard theories centred around what he now knew to be the truth.
Mr Weasley was taken aback by Draco’s compliment. “Well, thank you, we do appreciate it,” he looked over at Mrs Weasley, who nodded. “Of course we will help. Our family is directly involved in his reign as minister and we are petrified our grand kids will end up without a mother.”
“Only because I killed Voldemort.”
“Here,” said Malfoy, looking at a shop. “In there.”
But most of the time Harry just felt alone.
“Yes, sir?”
“Apparently,” started Ron, mid tooth-brushing, “he’s in a terrible mood today.”
The two men stared at each other.
“There’s no need to thank us,” Mr Weasley smiled, “you are family.”
“No, you don’t,” muttered Malfoy, scratching at the Dark Mark on his arm.
“Well, I don’t know why I started to worry about you when father took you into another room,” said Malfoy sheepishly, looking down at his hands which were nearly bleeding.
“I’m not that old,” huffed Mrs Weasley, but a smile stayed firmly on her face.
“Fine,” replied Malfoy, not moving. “Hunky dory.”
Draco eyed him, pulling his hands behind his back, turning to eye the exit, knowing he could easily leave and ignore Harry. It was simply a matter of honor. It didn’t mean he had to answer. He nodded, still eyeing the exit.
Harry shrugged, “Curious.”
Malfoy sighed, “I’m going to assume the Dursley’s are the muggles you grew up with. And from your sarcastic tone I will also assume they weren’t… great.”
Harry almost replied, but decided to pretend he wasn’t.
Later that night, in the privacy of his four-poster bed, he lifted both his sleeves to look at his new enemy, Draco Malfoy, on his left wrist and his future husband, Tom Riddle, on his right wrist. He felt, maybe, a little better, now that there was less guessing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco nodded like it was obvious.
Molly shook her head and looked away, “We all ignored the rotting. I can’t fault Narcissa Malfoy for it. The signs were obvious from the beginning. No one saw the Malfoy kid until he was nine. Many were unsure if he even really existed. Some crazy people theorize that he’s not even the real one, that the real Malfoy heir had died for one reason or another and the Malfoys were just biding their time until they could get a replacement… Lucius kept him hidden for too long. And I remember mentioning it to Arhur, that I felt that it was far too strange the secrecy Lucius was keeping regarding his son.”
Hermione’s smirk let Harry know she had a strong guess, “You think he knows.”
He nodded, passing the fat lady and entering the dorm where he was met with more hostility and two panicked looking friends.
Harry could get away with this very easily, he realized. Everyone believed him to be slow, distracted, unaware. Someone like that gives quick answers of basic assumptions, so he shrugged, “My scar is telling me that something is coming.”
Harry groaned as Hermione shook him awake, sloppily picking up his bag and moaning in complaint the entire walk to Gryffindor tower as they went to drop their bags before supper. Harry dropped on his bed, nodding to Ron as he complained about Binns uselessness, sounding a lot like Hermione in the process.
An hour later, both laying on the edge of the balcony at the Astronomy tower, legs dangling off the edge as they stared at the mess of stars in the sky, was when Harry remembered what they had been discussing prior to getting off topic.
“No... Who am I supposed to complain about the dementors?”
Harry was doing everything possible to not blame himself for this. That wasn’t his fault, and neither was it Draco’s. Now repeat that a few billion times and maybe both will start believing it.
“Did you think I did it?”
Hermione lightly grabbed Harry’s forearm and quietly warned, “Malfoy did insult the hippogriff, Harry.”
After a few minutes of staring, glaring and gawking at the letter, Ron huffed then switched his glare to Draco, “Dude… open it!”
“Be my… fake date,” He felt gross saying that, but at the root of it all, that’s what he was asking her to be. A front.
Dumbledore nodded, watching the young quidditch player disappear in the back, in some room where they were going to be informed about what exactly being a champion was going to entail. After he disappeared they all waited, watching for another bursts of sparks and another name to be announced. They all hoped otherwise but when it came, they all still flinched, not expecting it still. Dumbledore didn’t seem to notice, reaching up and once again adding unnecessary tension as he slowly read the name on the delicate burnt paper. He looked at the Ravenclaw table with all the students from Beauxbaton, “The champion for Beauxbaton will be… Fleur Delacour.”
“Of putting Granger and Weasley and even the she-Weasel in dangerous situations.”
Ron paused, a smile still on his face as he absorbed and tried to make sense of what Harry had just told him. Then he remembered what Draco had said and all the pieces fell together as Ron’s smile fell apart, “He doesn’t care.”
It only made Harry hate this pureblood culture even more.
Draco smirked.
Harry shrugged, “I imagine you will find it funny me dancing alone, because I’m not going with anyone else, regardless of what McGonnagall says.”
Moody gave Malfoy a knowing look and didn’t bother keeping it a secret why, wanting the entire class to know that he could hold the slytherin house on a leash with all the dirt he had on them.
Harry nodded but his face showed he was clearly confused as to why.
“Why would I be scared of him!?”
“Why are you here? Gryffindor dorm too noisy to ponder about the wonderful class we had today?”
He heard as a few of them, Ron included, cursed out Hermione, demanding that she leave and close their curtains. Harry simply couldn’t believe that Hermione dared to open the drapes of any teenage boy who she knew had been drinking the night prior. Who knows what you’d find.
When he felt the press of lips on his he rejoiced, following the lead in a slow dance of lips. Every small turn, every swift gasp felt like a gift, like an apology, like a promise. Harry was unsure of who was promising who what. So Harry turned off his consciousness for a few minutes and let his body speak for him. It usually did a better job anyway.
“And you’re telling me to eat pineapples to ease a bruise?”
And Harry wanted to go back and ask again, try to show him that they are meant to be and just skip the whole prologue. But Dream Draco kept him still. According to Dream Draco, if Harry makes the first move, Draco might- will say yes which… FUCK YES! But, if he says yes, someone will tell Malfoy Senior and Draco will get a beating. Because Lucius doesn’t want Draco to be with Harry. And Lucius will all but kill his son to prevent that.
Sitting back on his bed, his feet bumped into the discarded package and curiosity rose. Harry picked it up, settling it on his bed, closing the curtains and sitting crossed legged, glaring at it as though that would make it reveal what was inside. It didn’t. Finally Harry sighed and ripped it open.
Hermione leaned back into her chair, going back to pretending she was paying attention to Binns who at this point was ignoring them. Harry looked around and realized that people were either blatantly paying attention to their argument, blatantly sleeping, or just ignoring everything and everyone.
“I told him to stop whining and writhing and do something with his time.”
Harry’s left hand grabbed Draco’s wrist, panic immediately flinching in his eyes. Harry’s finger enveloped the wrist, covering throughout with his fingers, lifting it up between their faces. Draco’s eyes were panicked and glued to his own. Harry sighed. He didn’t know what he was doing anymore. But he could see it, in the corner of his eyes, Draco’s name sparkling with every lighting flash in the sky.
Draco shrugged, “No one knew about his son being a Deatheater until Karkaroff’s trial. He gave names for a lesser sentence, and in front of everyone and in the presence of both the father and the son, ratted out to Barty Crouch that Jr was one of the people responsible for the attack on the Longbottoms.”
Just as Dream Draco had predicted, something called the Yule Ball was announced. And Harry became a bit worried about those dreams/visions- WHATEVER! He became a bit worried about them because… prior to that dream, Harry hadn’t heard a word about the Yule Ball. So… it wasn’t something Hary inserted in a fantastical way in his dreams.
I legit wrote this while in classes. All three of them.
Harry turned around, flanked on either side by Ron and Hermione who looked confused to hear Draco calling him out after all but running away from him for the past week.
When alone in his room at the Dursley, he would wonder how this whole soulmate/enemy-bond came to be and who even decided who was whose what. He liked to believe there was some powerful being beyond their reach who would assign these things, and sometimes… they would get bored.
That didn’t stop Harry from blatantly trying to steal glances every now and then, only to be interrupted by an elbow from Ron and a quiet ‘You’re being too obvious!’.
“Ah, and he finally says what he pulled me aside for, Inside Information. You want me to rat out all my friends?” There was a teasing tone, and Harry knew that Draco knew that wasn’t Harry’s goal. But Draco wanted it to be. Because the real one caused him panic.
That which he pulled out was fear.
“Do you listen to yourself!?”
And then shook their head.
“Ron is willing to try.” Harry corrected defensively.
Harry was the clear soul mate and the Malfoys adults didn’t want anyone to know who Draco’s real enemy was.
Harry opened his mouth to object again before Draco interrupted, “I’m not stupid, or stubborn, and maybe I am a masochist but I’ve had enough… But I’m not leaving him with my mother. I don’t fancy finding out what he would do to her. And convincing her to leave him… that won’t be easy.”
Harry buried his gaze in Draco’s eyes, faintly aware that Draco let his guard down and that if he glanced down he could easily see if his dreams were visions or just fantasies. Harry nodded, “After three years of near death experiences, we’ve become more intimate and we’ve learnt to trust one another. I’ve asked them for a chance to make this right.” It was… sort of true. There was definitely some twisting in there.
Harry turned to look at Draco whose face was blank. Harry slowly grabbed them, unsure of what was going on. Apparently Harry did not grab it right because Draco groaned, grabbed Harry’s hand and forced the Dried Nettles and the piece of paper holding- OH!
Harry was silently baffled. Ron was shaking his head in shame. But it took Hermione’s scoff for Ginny to burst out laughing and exclaim in unadulterated joy, “I fucking love school!”
Harry only realized he was also crying when he heard himself sniffle as he reached the boy sitting beaten on the floor. He knelt down and sighed, “You know that’s not what this is.”
And then he looked at Malfoy, who didn’t even get a hug before they began to hurry him along to get as far away from all the muggles.  And he immediately realized that there was a way. A way for Draco to be that soul mate he had on his left wrist. That there’s someone else, that’s being hidden by the pressure of his family.
And finally Harry knew what he would ask next time he saw Dream Draco.
Harry woke up to the collective groaning of all his dorm mates. Who had snuck in the whiskey, no one would tell.
“Have you looked at your face? If I didn’t know you any better I would have guessed you had a shag in the tower, but…” Ron gave him a once over and shrugged, “That doesn’t seem like something you would easily do.”
Draco looked scared and angry and confused with which expression to hurl at Harry, “What?”
Moody nodded and pulled out one last, unsuspecting spider.
Walking into that classroom and seeing that person you love broken and wondering over and over again if staying away was the right choice… sucks.
“NO! No! My name is Malfoy! You call me Malfoy! We’re not on first-name basis!” He looked alive with anger and his eyes were becoming bloodshot with withheld tears of fear or shame that Draco would never admit to.
Ron looked at her confused before turning to Harry to see if he knew, and Harry believed he knew why Hermione laughed. I mean, the way elder Malfoy was acting, it was almost like he wanted to Weasleys to really know that elder Malfoy was aggressively ignoring them. It was childish and petty.
Regardless, that week prior to the Yule Ball was silent terror. Despite all the letters the boys, Ron, Harry and Draco, sent to their respective mothers -adoptive mums included-, neither woman was in a mood to dispute to the teenagers how their… conversations were going?
Harry stood up, slowly approaching the panicking Draco, trying to touch his arm to calm him down, “Draco-”
Harry nodded, “And Lockhart is a Ravenclaw. And instead he cheated and stole other people’s stories to become famous. And you are a Slytherin and yet here you are conspiring with an age-old enemy of the snakes, a Gryffindor. And-” Harry smirked, eyes closing in on Draco, wanting to savour his reaction, “I was primarily going to be sorted into Slytherin. But here I am, wearing red.”
Second year:
“If he can’t solve the Lefty issue now, he should at least feel like he can win at something else. He already cheated. He helped Diggory cheat. Without cheating Harry wouldn’t be alive. Cheating is the only way he will be able to survive this fucking tournament!”
“The only way he can assure himself you can be trusted and it is okay to be with you is by jumping head first into the deep end and hoping he didn’t make a mistake.”
“He’s sucking up to a ghost. Just in case that ghost comes back to life.”
Draco looked behind him frantically, looking for something that wasn’t there. Parkinson looked understandably confused, “What is it Draco?”
“I’m not getting out.”
Harry heard the rain, the thunder, the disturbance in the lake, the wind in the forest. And yet his heartbeat was louder than all of that as for a second he wondered… if I open my eyes now… will I be in my room?
Two days later, Harry wondered if it was humanly possible to vomit all your organs. He wanted to. And sometimes it felt like he was about to whenever he heard a dragon roar.
Starting off year 4, things get a little out of hands.
And then Harry looked at Ron, and at Hermione, and then for the first time ever he wondered just how intimate his friends had gotten with each other, if it happened, when did it happen and how did he miss it… Harry shook his head, “I had company.” And with that he entered his room, forcing the other two to remain quiet as their roommates went about dragging themselves awake and dressing themselves for class.
“What about her?”
“Isn’t Malfoy in that class?” Harry asked distractedly, starting to walk towards class. When he didn’t hear a response, or felt them walking with him, he turned around to find the duo glaring at him, arms crossed, looking like the stern parents he sometimes ached for. He kind of liked it right now.
Obviously not. Much less now if his startled yelp and his flinch were anything to go by. Harry wasn’t even quiet on the way up.
He shrugged, “Everyone knew who the Potters were. At least they were popular names with the Deatheaters. Pain in the arse is what my father seemed to refer them as, along with many other Deatheaters.” Draco gave a small smile in return to Harry’s prideful joy at hearing that his parents had given Voldermort’s army a run for their money. “It wasn’t common knowledge though that he was hunting them, you, down. Only the inner circle knew, and even then it was a select few. My aunt Bellatrix- She was- is probably still a Deatheater. She’s now in Azkaban. She helped at… hurting the-” Draco choked, and breathed in and out a few times before he gathered the courage to say, “She helped or was mostly responsible for hurting the Longbottoms.”
“What flowers do you want on your corpse, because you’re getting me there!” Harry would never hurt Draco, but he really wanted Draco to stop being so dry and sassy. At least for a moment.
“I opened it, it screamed. I attacked it, it screamed. I did every spell I know, it screamed. I leave it alone, it screams in my head. What else should I do?”
Harry felt so small, so delicate, so vulnerable. And that was great.
“Harry, we’re four years in. How much clearer do we have to make it that we’ll go to the end of the world with you? Just like how you would for me, for Hermione, for my family, for the school. You may not realize it, but you’ve done so much already, and had so much done to you. It’s okay to rely on others.”
Harry shook his head, he’s been forced to ingest enough things for one day. What if… What if in the first challenge he had to fight the other champions? They would destroy him, they clearly are more skilled than he was.
“How stupid do you believe me to be?”
Harry worried for his hands and tried to grab one of them, only to have him pull away and turn around, giving his back to him as he sighed aggressively, “I want to go with you.” Draco sounded almost angry with himself about it, “I want to spend time with you. But I don’t want to be the center of attention.” Harry scoffed and Draco shot him a glare over his shoulder, “It will be made into a bigger deal than it is regardless, so if I could minimize it.”
He sighed and squeezed harder until the boy groaned and reluctantly opened his eyes, “What?”
Harry opened his eyes, heard Ron walking out of the room, and contemplated murder for a second. Then he took notice of the tent between his legs and decided he needed a cold shower.
“Have we ever made it feel like you couldn’t tell us anything?”
“Why were you out for so long? What if something had happened? You’re not back to full health Harry!” He heard them following after him diligently, up till that second where Ron pulled Hermione back and whispered something to her.
“What does it mean?”
Apparently, Harry’s new thing was being jealous and possessive. But it stemmed from confusion. He had no idea where he stood with Malfoy, and until he knew he didn’t want anyone having a better position than him.
Moody targeted one of them, “Malfoy.”
Side note, don't know if this demographic even watches this show, but I'm really tempted to make a fic about Sabrina, post season 3. (with Caliban and Nick)... Uhm, let me know your opinion?
Harry tried to reach for his wrist, but Draco stopped him, “NO!”
“Harry, get up mate! We’re going to be late!”
“Shut up, McClaggan.”
“Before that!”
And Harry himself paused to think. He said it because in a way he understood… but he’s never really stopped to think about it. And Hermione warned him about it too.
“Well… do you want me to give you a summarized report of the past four years of my life? Do you want me to start back at the Dursley’s? Or do you want the details?”
He crossed the line.
Hermione and Ron looked up at him, expecting.
Harry wanted to give Parkinson an unsure smile, anything to try and ease the tension, but it came out as nothing more than a quiver on the corner of his lips. He sighed and decided to join those who were blatantly sleeping through class.
It was in potions class when Harry finally allowed himself to focus on anything other than class and Hermione’s constant worrying. And when he turned to look for Malfoy he found the boy looking back at him, unashamed… analytical. Harry shyly smiled. Malfoy gave him a once-over, frown still in place and turned back to his cauldron.
Ron sarcastically laughed, “How is that any different than the truth?”
He turned to her in a flash, “Did you grab me?”
But they looked sorta good. . . Harry was still getting used to the accumulating heat on his wrists.
Ron shrugged, “Do we even know any seniors?”
And the kiss.
“Fuck you.”
“Are you the reason why he hates me?”
Draco smirked looking past Harry, “Life isn’t so easy for you. What with all the dementors, and murderers who are after you.”
There were mixed reactions as half the school cheered for the handsome boy who stood up, both proud and amazed that he was chosen, and the other half glared at nothing with disappointment from not being chosen or losing a bet. Malfoy seemed to be feeling both at the same time.
Draco shook his head, dropping Parkinson’s arm and walking towards the corner they just came from, hoping to find someone hiding there and finding disappointment. “I swear someone’s-”
Harry shook his head, “I couldn’t hear anything past my own heartbeat and the movements of the dragon.”
He nodded, turning to look at Ron.
“Yes you can,” Harry smiled and took his hand, “There are people who would gladly take you in and help you simply because they would respect your for defecting from … death-”
Harry nodded, “I’m looking for coffee, or tea… I don’t know and I don’t care, as long as its highly caffeinated.”
Harry wished he had gotten better. But he hadn’t.
3. I... graduated. Or at least I finished university. My uni cancelled the graduation and refuses to acknowledge there are alternatives to celebrate the achievements of their graduating class. I'm not bitter. I'm empty. I need my closure and I'm never going to get it. Whatever. I now need to get a job and I might be moving to the USA by October, so that's my future excuse.
“I just figured there was nothing else to add to the conversation,” Hermione muttered, glancing at Ron, a small glare on the corner of her eyes.
“Hermione?”
And I need to quench the thirst, or the pressure will kill me.
“Read between the lines, Harry!” Hermione was geniunely wondering if they were playing dumb so she would get the pleasure of explaining it to them. It was quickly becoming less of a pleasure. “We’ve been wondering if Lefty has you as well and what that would mean, good or bad. I think from this we can assume he does. I still don’t know if its good or not, but Malfoy senior would rather keep you two separated than figure it out… Unless he knows.”
Hermione sighed, “I don’t think anything will phase her after what happened during her first year here. Nothing can top being possessed and nearly dying.”
But Harry seriously disrespected Arthur at the moment. Not just for following along a teenager and spreading exaggerated rumors to defame someone -talk about being the bigger man-, but also that whole pause.
Ron and Harry shared a confused look before turning to Hermione, Harry sighed, “Can we share your epiphany?”
Both times now he’s expected Draco to pull back, push away, anything. Both times Draco has just stood there, letting Harry do with his lips whatever he pleased. Not pushing away, but not collaborating either. After a few seconds of this Harry pulled away, but not too far, his face, his lips always inches away, waiting. “You don’t have to tell anyone.” His whisper was barely audible in the storm.
Harry opened his mouth to say tired, before realizing Ron was staring at him from his bed, “Better. Could be much better, but good for now.”
“You left your bed at one.” Ron continued, frustrated and tired.
“You think there’s something coming.”
“I am,” Harry muttered, glaring at the ground.
‘Astronomy. Midnight.’
Side note: I wrote a story once where I made people leave a certain amount of comments before I posted the next chapter. A reader complained about it saying it was unfair and that I was holding the chapters hostage, etc etc. I stopped doing it. If you are that person, here's what I really wanted to say, and I want everyone to know that even like 2 years later I still feel this way:
“I’m not moody or anything. I just had a disturbing dream, and you were a part of it.”
“Because it was the right thing to do. He was the only one who didn’t know!”
Harry could guess.
“Draco.”
After watching two schools make a spectacle of their arrival, the school joined them in the grand hall to find they were to share a table with the Slytherins and Ravenclaws. Ron wouldn’t shut up about how Victor Krum was here at the school with them. Harry couldn’t ignore that Victor Krum was seated next to Malfoy and they appeared to be having a nice conversation.
While standing behind them, knowing that they were focused and getting out of here as fast as possible, Draco looked at his wrists.
Still.
Not because in his sleepless ramble he distracted himself with the marauders map and noticed Malfoy was out of his room, wandering the halls and Harry HAD to know what Malfoy was doing. No. Not that. Just fresh air.
Dean shook his head, “Name or no bet, Parvati. You can’t just bet on a house. I’m okay with you guys betting other houses, but names or no bet.”
He looked at Percy, Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny loudly join their big family in a warm spectacle of love.
(See the end of the chapter for
And Draco looked offended, “What the fuck did you just accuse my father of?”
“Be careful though.”
“No.”
No way…. there’s no way Malfoy was his soul mate.  No.
It sounded like Dean tried to slam the door but the visitor stopped him, muttering something before Dean groaned and then closed the door. Shuffling footsteps and then his curtain was pulled, revealing a very annoyed Dean, “Someone is looking for you outside of the Gryffindor Tower, the Fat Lady is annoyed. Go.”
They respected his privacy.
And neither wants to admit how stupid it is to be fighting their fathers’ battles.
He began to walk towards the entrance, never looking at Harry, “It is mandatory to wear it, so you should probably run back quickly and get it.”
“What?” Draco sounded out of breath.
Ron sat down, hands drooping between his knees, head hanging with signs of tiredness, “What’s on your mind?”
Harry smiled, “Hmm. You said you wouldn't rat them out, but then you told me Parkinson is just full of empty threats.”
Molly sighed, shame seeping out of every orifice, “He told me that’s just how strict elitist, Pure-Blooded families were like. And that we should be glad we’re not like them.”
So . . . jewelry.
They sat in silence for far too long. Finally Draco looked up, “Is that all?”
Ron sighed, “It’s rude to ignore people.”
“After that Harry,” Hermione groaned.
Harry sighed, not knowing where things stood was the most frustrating part of all of this.
Harry looked at Arthur who was blatantly glaring back at elder Malfoy, and wondered what age-old feud laid between them.
Chapter 8 (this one) was finished 3 weeks ago. Chapter 9 (next one) was finished right now as I post this, and I started it yesterday. It's frustrating how I can go months with writers block and then write a fucking essay in 6 hours. Because the next chapter feels like a fucking essay.
Voldemort was Tom Riddle.
“Senior freaked out-”
“I said I don’t know.”
He’s still in the astronomy tower.
“That something like this was going to happen.”
Draco was about to fight him on it when they both froze at the sound of Filch opening a classroom nearby. In a haste Harry grabbed Draco and dragged him out of the underneath the cloak, covering his mouth as he tried to comment on it.
“I kept wondering, what would it mean. To die right then, to a dragon, in a competition I never consented to participate in. In front of all my friends and classmates. In front of strangers. My death as much of a spectacle as my parents’.”
“It’s just a four step pattern!”
Harry fights a dragon... and then another.
“On class. Not on-,” Ron looked around and whispered even quieter, “Malfoy. Or the deatheaters, or his father or… you know who.”
Harry wanted to punch him again.
The class watched as Moody made the spider do all kinds of things from dancing to jumping from table to table. Hermione was not happy about it, not one bit. Ron had found it funny until the spider landed on their table. Malfoy was mentally gone.
“Another belief that Salazar and his followers had was the women could not be in a position of power. They had to be submissive and obedient. And Helena was anything but that. And she had accepted the role of Headmistress for the next year. When the Salazar and the followers heard of that they concocted a plan to… dispose of her. Whitaker wanted to protect her from that, so he went to the school to find her and take her away before The Followers of Slytherin could find her. She knew he was one of them and believed him despicable for it, so she once again rejected him and tried to walk away from him.
Harry gave a tight smile and walked away with a bag full of clothes and books and a heart heavy with worry. Ron is less guided by emotions. Ron controls himself more and will not let worry freak him out. He trusts Hermione, but not with this.
Hermione shrugged, picking up her quill and going back to paying attention.
It took him a while to open his eyes, his body wanting to go back to sleep, and he had to have Ron help him get dressed and help him get to the Gryffindor tower. According to Ron, Harry had been glaring at Hermione one second and the next his head dropped on the table, and no matter what anyone did, Harry wouldn’t wake up. Pomfrey had told Ron and Hermione that it was most likely symptoms of stress and that’s what Hermione spread when she went back to class to continue getting the class notes for Ron and Harry. Harry had slept for two days.
Draco blinked, indifference reigning on his face, “Why?”
Harry smiled, not looking away from the frosty eyes that ravaged the skin on his wrist and he felt warm. In the cold autumn, rainy night he felt warm. “Do you trust me?”
Harry stood up.
Molly nodded, “I still don’t know how I’m going to tell Arthur. He sees them as a whole. One brain, three bodies, all rotting the world.”
… “What triggered it? The class? You could complain...”
Harry sighed. He pulled back to try and calm his anger, but Draco pulled him back in, forehead to forehead, eyes closed, lips inches away. The sigh that escaped Draco let him know that what the boy wanted right now was his company and his silence. Harry provided it.
“And how would you achieve that?”
Harry looked at Ron who was grimacing at the Skrewts and leaned in close to whisper, “Pick a fight with Draco, I’ll fix it later.”
The weekend came with an uncomfortable meeting with Molly, who was infuriated at having to keep quiet regarding Draco’s abuse, even to Arthur. Harry had a feeling that if Arthur knew he would use it as a weapon against Lucius and blow their cover. But now he’s worried that Molly’s rage for a wounded child will be too much. She loves too much. And so she hurts just as badly.
“The Unforgivable Curses are three spells that if casted would result in immediate imprisonment in Azkaban.  They are named so because they are, in fact, unforgivable.” Hermione dictated quick and precise, like a talking book.
Harry nodded, bitterly smiling, “Kind of like how I remember how my parents died but that shouldn’t be possible because I was too young to be creating such vivid memories.”
Harry smiled, “Why?”
Draco froze and Harry finally grabbed his hands, turning them over and examining the half moon cuts that adorned his palms. He sighed and pulled the palms up to his mouth, kissing each palm before setting them down on his lap and giving Draco an annoyed look, “I don’t like the no-mates trying to fill their time with you. Your mine, and I never had anything in my life so I never learned how to share. Forgive me.”
His ears perked up when the Hufflepuff seeker was mentioned. Harry believed he saw Diggory walking out of the goblet hall, but was unsure he ever put his name in. Harry looked at Ron and shrugged. “Two knuts for Diggory?”
I would really like to know your opinion on this, and where the story might be headed. I'll be real honest. My senior project for Graphic Design is to make a sex stories app, and I plan on not just being the main app and project designer, but on also being the writer. So, I would like encouragement and (lets be honest) reminders about this story.
“It’s hard to find a place to hide and have a moment to yourself. And you had to find this one.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded, “But… people don’t hide both. Is not normal, but it is known of people hiding one wrist, but both? That’s not a thing.”
Harry was happy.
Harry looked down and saw the orange he had taken from the grand hall, meant to have been an afternoon snack when they got to History of Magic class, was now ruined in his hand, mostly juice in the cold ground. Harry didn’t know he had the strength to squeeze an orange still with its skin. He had been wearing gloves.
“Just tell me!”
Your father is more open-minded and has attempted to teach you guys how to be more open to muggles and muggle-borns, but I doubt whole-heartedly that Lucius has even considered to tell Draco to be accepting of those that aren’t like him. So, of course, he doesn’t know. It’s not an excuse, I would definitely like an apology, but I understand. I can put myself in Draco’s shoes and see the world from his eyes, can you?”
On the walk in the forest, on their way to some form of magical transportation, Ron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Diggory kept on ranting about how despicable the entire Malfoy family is.
In the silence that followed after Harry was too afraid to move, scared he would hurt Draco, unaware of where exactly Lucius hit him. It was an hour later when Draco began to shift around, uncomfortable, and no position he shifted himself to seemed to fix this. FInally after attempting to sleep on the floor with his head resting on Harry’s lap, he gave up and sat up. His eyes made it clear that while physically up, his mind was still trying to join him in the waking world.
Malfoy laughed at something Zabini said, a mocking laugh if his body language is anything to go by, then joined Parkinson on the seats, watching Zabini follow a few seventh years to the goblet, not putting his name in, but seeming like he was pressuring the older students to do so. This would not be the first time Harry wondered what was the extent of these kids’ social power in this school. A fourth year pressuring a seventh year to enter a competition was new.
Mentions of suicide.
He never imagined a day where Draco would ask for help, not without Harry gaining his trust and letting him know that he would always be there when needed, so he was confused by Draco’s willingness to trust and beg right now. It felt intimate in a way Harry could not even begin to explain. Harry simply pulled his hand back, his eyes never leaving Draco’s.
Very shortly after they dropped the Malfoy subject, moving on to quidditch. Ron didn’t speak to him for the rest of the evening, only giving him a few passing looks here and there, clearly looking for a way to approach the subject, and not finding it. It bothered him, not because of his cowardice, but because Hermione was quickly growing irritated with the silence between them and Harry was scared of what would happen once the bottle tipped.
“Is it normal?”
Ron sighed, pulling out from beneath his bed their trunk of snacks, “I know. But you have to get out of this alive.”
He did sleep. An empty, dreamless nap after supper and anxiety about missing his… date? Woke him up at five past eleven. Unsure of what to do, Harry just grabbed his cloak and map and decided to wait for Draco in the tower.
Cruel, but Harry’s lived his whole life in the center of Cruel Town. They were thinking of making him the mayor…
Draco grimaced at his last comment, “I can’t leave them.”
Draco looked back at Harry, scared and confused, eyes flickering to his wrist, “What?”
Harry nodded, and Draco continued, “She’s now paying for it. I imagine she’s lost her mind by this point. Though evidence suggests she was gone before she was put in Azkaban, so… My father was part of the inner circle, and one of the few who knew about the hunt for the Potters. Crouch’s son was one of the inner circle who knew.”
Harry waited outside the Slytherin dorms under his invisibility cloak, his map telling him Malfoy had yet to return, but was on his way, flanked by Parkinson and Zabini… Slowly.
Harry nodded.
It’s not that Harry is mad at Arthur and is trying to find a reason to hate him. Arthur has done great things for him that he doesn’t know how he would repay them.
“What’s going on!?” He was panicked, out of breath, and he could definitely feel the smoke had reached them by the pain in his lungs.
Funny note:
Harry shook his head, “For getting lucky.”
Draco sighed, “The champions have to start the dance-”
Harry’s tone never changed, sounded like he was bored asking these questions, and he thought Draco’s behavior was immature, “Why does he hate me?”
Then Harry looked at Neville. And he could understand why Hermione burst out demanding he stopped. Neville looked the curse was being done on him. And once Moody stopped, Neville left too. Physically there, mentally gone.
“Company, friends, love. A family. I want friends who hold me so close I can call them family. I want someone who when they hold me they never want to let go. I need… people in my life who care, because I know for a fact I would lose my mind without them.”
Draco remained silent for a while, until Harry went back to his table, “Pineapples.”
“Are you jealous?”
“I wish you hadn’t told me.”
Harry stared at Ron for a few seconds before shaking his head, “Later. For now let’s do as Hermione said and enjoy the game.”
MY. GOD! I'll be surprised if anyone is still reading this (I know one person is, their comment inspired me to come back and finish this chapter that was a few words away from being finished... 4 MONTHS AGO!)
Harry watched Draco’s bottom lip disappear as Draco bit it in hesitation, “What makes you think I’m in an unsa-”
“Are you okay?”
He sounded tired, too tired to even argue and tell him to leave. Good... Good?
Harry scoffed, “I had to tell you about Hermione ‘cause you were to embarrassed to ask!”
Lucius Malfoy, written in rigid calligraphy on his right.
I don't know when the next one will come or if anyone still cares. But for sake of completion I will end it.
Harry and Ron silently flinched, wondering why Hermione sometimes had to be a bit more annoying than she needed to be. As Hermione opened her mouth to further on argue, Harry covered her mouth, rolling his eyes and pulled her away towards the dorms. When they reached the stairs to the boys dorms Hermione pushed Harry’s hand away and huffed. “Why? I was putting him in his place.”
Harry smiled and went inside a stall, taking care of business and changing clothes. He was sitting on the loo, tying his shoes when Ron whispered, clearly leaning on the door, “Hermione came down at five. . . I checked the marauders’ map before that… I came down before that.”
Malfoy nodded, “... He shouldn’t have done that.”
Harry stared at Draco’s face, looking for a whole minute at his nervous ticks like biting the inside of his lips and pressing his nails into the palms of his hands. Draco did not like Harry’s silence, the hypocrite. The lip biting was a nervous tick, the nail carving was an angry nervous tick. There was a faint redness in the palms of his hands. His nails were breaking skin. He sighed, “Why?”
First year:
Draco was ignoring everything and everyone. Parkinson was blatantly staring at them. Zabini was leaning back on his chair and sleeping on Parkinson’s shoulder.
There was a knock on their dorm room. All the boys grumbled and Harry noticed that someone had taken his shoes off and tucked him in, closing the curtains around him. Harry groaned and wrapped himself tighter with the afghan, wanting the noise to go away.
“You foolish idiot!”
And that was it. He just walked away. And Ron was pissed. And Harry was confused. And Hermione was holding back a laugh.
“You had left a sour taste in my mouth.” Draco did not like that answer, and Harry shrugged, “Hagrid had told me that Vold- You-know-who had been a Slytherin, Ron expanded it by saying nearly all bad wizards had been Slytherins and then you nailed it in with the wonderful introduction of yours. Everything had led me to believe that was the path to destruction, and I wanted to prove I was good and worthy of people’s time, after being told otherwise my whole life.”
No one was breathing now. Everyone held their breath as Moody casted one last curse, shooting a green stream glow, ending the life of an innocent spider. For his own entertainment.
The blonde shrugged, “So do you. You keep talking about protecting me and my mother from my father-”
Draco sighed and opened his eyes to see Harry intensely staring back, “It’s not that easy.”
Moving on.
“How the hell am I supposed to rescue something from it? Moody says use my broom, but for what? Do a few laps around the stadium and show off to the audience that the dragon knows how to fly better than I do when it knocks me down and kills me?”
Harry stared. Cheers going all around, but silence filling the room as Malfoy turned to look at his table and found him staring. He didn’t turn away. Malfoy looked down for a second, as though deciding how to continue forward, deciding one satisfied smile was an appropriate response for the situation. Harry wondered was Malfoy was thinking, and if it had to do with him. The school sat down confused, but Harry didn’t care as Malfoy raised his eyebrows and motioned towards the goblet, almost like he was asking him if he was happy that Diggory had been chosen. In part… yes. He was.
“Let me finish.”
Hermione on the other hand, decided he needed time alone to ponder what happened. Sitting in the common room, Ron and Hermione off to the side doing their homework and glaring at anyone who got near him, he pondered how it really was. Not his broken memories, not the faint memories of an infant, not the stories, theories, retelling of every noisy person in Hogwarts and the wizarding world... what really happened. How did his parents feel. Did they blame him for being destined for this life? Did they blame themselves for fitting the bill of the prophecy? Did they blame whoever made the prophecy, Voldermort, life? Did they live their final days in peace, no blame, no worries, just enjoying each other as a family?
Harry smiled and nodded, not pointing out the obvious betrayal sitting right there in the empty classroom, “My father, Sirius, Remus and Peter had been friends since their first year of Hogwarts.”
“Not to be alone.”
“Quidditch Cup. Father told me to go ahead while he talked to some friend of his, and…” He sighed, “I guess from the context you were telling Weasley for the first time. All I saw was my name.”
He was extremely disoriented when he woke up though, presumably hours laters. Mostly because Ron was sitting a few tables away. Ron gave a half smile and waved the map at him. “I lied to Hermione after she came back from the library and told her you were sleeping and not to bother you.”
“No. With me there will always be choices. It would rip me apart, but if you decided to walk away now and forbid me from ever even looking at you again, I would do it. You have enough on your plate and I don’t plan on being another menace in your life.” Draco looked up once Harry finished, flinching under the seriousness of Harry’s voice, of his eyes. Harry wondered if Draco has felt love or utmost dedication in the past few… ever. If Lucius had ever loved him, if Narcissa had ever praised him, hugged him, if either of them ever let Draco know that he was worthy of love, of protection, of being adored.
“I believed him a cheater, blackmailer, and criminal… didn’t think he would abuse his own child. The concept still feels foreign to me. Malfoy is the only kid Lucius has, why would he risk it?” Ron muttered, shuffling around.
“The goblet chose you?”
Draco paused and took one good look at Harry before asking credulously, “Did you ever read Hogwarts: A History?”
Ron nodded, face looking tired and scared and worried, altogether, “Use your broom… That’s what Moody said?”
“That’s a lie.”
Either that or Draco was so baffled by the letter that it took him a long time to process it, because when he turned the letter around for the boys to see the letter only had 3 short sentences in it;
Draco was quiet and his eyes analytical, but his breathing labored. He looked down at their joined hands in Harry’s lap then back up to Harry’s eyes and slowly, he nodded. “I’ll talk to my mother. I will try to coerce her as vaguely as possible so as to not freak her out…” He whispered, barely audible.
Harry was going to keep his mouth shut, but, “... Are the others asleep?”
“I’m just saying, I get the Claws, but the Huffies? The Huffies are the last people I’d expect a Snake to cahoots with.”
Draco stayed silent as he absorbed this information.
“And I’m going to take a wild guess and say Lefty didn’t take that too well,” Ron finished, smirking.
Distraction. Now he needed a distraction from this.
He shrugged, picking at his tie, noticing the red getting discolored, “How the more time I spent in the wizarding community the more complicated my life gets… and the less time there is between each special event.”
“Do you think he saw?” Ron sounded mortified.
She pushed Ron from his bed and laid down like Harry had just put the world’s weight on her shoulders and she was crumbling. Ron shook his head and patted her back, smiling as she once again huffed at him and ignored his attempt at soothing her, “How did he react?”
After arranging a meeting between the two mothers they both went ‘radio silent’, which in both Harry and Ron’s opinion it was a prick move to do. They could understand not telling Ron or Harry, but Draco was just as much of a victim here as Narcissa was, and his current faith was relying on her decision. The least they could do was keep him in the loop.
Draco nodded, reluctance clear on his face, “Rowena was not headmistress. The four founders were teachers and a joint voice of authority while they were alive. Until Salazar decided he did not like the whole…”
Draco held on to Harry’s stare before sighing and looking away, “It’s better this way.”
Harry didn’t have to look to know Ron had quickly warned him, in some way, that Harry’s anger is not to be taken personally. Harry sighed, put the parcel on the floor and closed the curtains, trying to shut down the worry that everything was going to go wrong soon.
Harry could not promise him that. The future was so fickle and any small decision could change it so drastically.
Draco was silent as he took it all in, looking both surprised and annoyed at what Harry said, so he reviewed what he said and took a step back, “I know it sounds a bit possessive, and I’m being as respectful of your privacy as I can, but I’m no fool. I was a victim of child abuse, I know better than anyone how it looks like, how victims behave, and I also know how hard it is to walk away, but I have this very strong gut feeling that it will get worse for you. Maybe not now, maybe not this year… But something in me tells me you might not make it to senior year without a few scars. I want to save you from that.”
“No, I meant,” Harry gave a breathy chuckle, “The… us… thing, is need-to-know till the Yule Ball. The other thing, no one has to know that ever. Except…”
Harry knew what she meant, and Harry hated the answer. But he wasn’t going to lie anymore, “You’ve all never hid your distaste for the Malfoys.” He muttered in return, not looking at her.
“You asked him to the Yule Ball?!”
Harry was the clear enemy, and there was somebody else, maybe a man, who maybe they thought was the soul mate.
Harry didn’t know what to say, so after a minute he nodded. “Would you rather I insult you?”
Harry looked at Ron, who shrugged, “He’s moved and adjusted himself a few times in his sleep… His movement is stiff. Like his favoring a bruised muscle or an injured… body part… Couldn’t pinpoint where exactly Lucius hit him.”
“It is six in the morning.” Mione started, tight lipped, control swaying.
Luckily after a side look from Hermione, Hagrid stepped in and ordered the two boys to separate.
Harry smiled at the way Draco’s cheeks seemed to push his eyes tighter and smaller when he smiled, when he laughed. He sighed, “I’m sorry for pushing too hard back then. That day.”
Walking out and getting hit with the cold air Harry shivered. Ron scuffed, “But he’s the one who’s running away from Harry!”
“Exactly. We don’t know three things, if Harry’s on Malfoy’s wrist, if Harry’s the soulmate, or if Malfoy knows who's who on his wrists.”
What did Harry learn? Draco is a heavy sleeper and a slow waker, because even having said that, Draco just closed his eyes and laid his head back down on Harry’s shoulder, huddling closer to Harry’s warmth. Harry sighed again, struggling to find that damn will to do this, “Malfoy.”
“Which is why I need him out of there before he finds out.” Harry turned to Ron, “Your mum.”
Malfoy looked up for a second, nodding again, his eyes shining a warm silver in the candlelights. Why were the candles still on?
Draco looked back as Harry walked away with the muggles, and went back to following closely behind his parents as they searched for an appropriate place to apparate.
I don't know what else to warn about, but if you think I should add another trigger warning to this or any other chapter, please tell me.
“You know, maybe I won’t go to the Yule ball with you.”
“And I’m the one who people call dramatic.”
When Harry woke up he looked around to see it was still dark, if not darker, and Ron had let exhaustion take him down. His heart twisted at Ron sleeping, curtain open, body half out of bed, head facing him as though he had been guarding Harry until he fell asleep. Harry got up and pushed him back onto his bed, covering him up and closing the curtains, “Thanks, mate.”
They reached a lake where everyone had huddled together and waited for someone to tell them it was safe to go back.
Harry laughed silently through his nose, “Wasn’t even thinking about that.”
Moody nodded, “Now who can tell me anything about these curses?”
“Don’t ask.”
Hermione nodded, and continued up the boys dorm, most likely to dictate to them everything that had to do with the Triwizard Tournament. Harry both wanted to know… and to forget.
Physically there, staring off into nothing. Mentally gone.
And there was still another curse.
They both turned back towards the forever young Helena, “After years of arguing on the matter they… kicked him out of the group. They asked a younger lord who had all the qualities of the Slytherins to take his place as representative of the house and the students and for a while the bad history with Salazar was forgotten. But Salazar was petty and gathered a following outside of Hogwarts, not yet named Hogwarts,” Draco paused to add that tidbit but also to make sure Harry was still paying attention to which he nodded.
And for a second Harry forgot why. And then Harry understood why Draco just ‘attacked’ him out of nowhere, after a week of avoiding him. He’s setting a precedent. Witnesses. If his father asks, they are fighting. Like they normally do. But Harry could feel it, hear it in the words, he doesn’t want to.
Harry could feel the bile rising up. This man was practicing torture in front of children, without any reservation.
He had yet to open his eyes but suddenly his senses were overwhelmed as Ron grabbed his shoulders and squeezed, unsure of what to do next, but knowing all he wanted was for Harry to wake up, “Hey… buddy. Err, are you okay?”
The next time Harry saw Draco, he was surrounded by Durmstrang and Beauxbatons girls and a few Beauxbaton boys. Harry had not expected someone to try and pursue Draco, much more considering the soulmate marks. But people liked to experiment with non-soulmates when they had yet to find their own. And they didn’t know they were hitting on Harry’s soulmate. And Harry couldn’t fight them. Draco was loving the positive attention.
“I was your enemy and you were going to be loyal to your father.”
This was not going to be good.
I know it took a LONG time for this to come, enough time for someone to write what they thought would happen.
Draco was not happy realizing this.
He tried to smile as he heard Pomfrey grumpily walk away. She cared too much and he could never fault her for it. But he was still exhausted so all he did was murmur, “I’ll try to limit my visits to one per year.”
They remained in silence for a while as Draco considered it.
“I mean you never know. You might think you're alone talking to your friend about some deep secret, but two stairs above might be your nemesis, too curious for his own good, listening in on something that to this day he still doesn’t understand what it means.”
And Ron’s not helping.
Turning over to look at the Slytherin table he found Draco calmly eating and talking with Parkinson who seemed to be extremely excited about something, and despite his distaste for the girl and her imposed beliefs and bullying behaviour, Harry could admit that when joyfully excited and with that bright smile on her face, the young girl had her beauty to her. It was almost like all the darkness of her breeding was gone and she was just a teen girl happy about something. It was the same beauty in excitement that appeared on Hermione’s face whenever she found some new forgotten old book.
Hermione nodded, looking at Ron proud, “Plus I don’t think Lefty senior would be so open-minded about his son taking the family name with him to the grave due to his sexuality. Lefty senior would want a son that could make him heirs and keep their tyranny going. Harry as an enemy is great, it gives them credit with their ‘friends’ and leader, it sells the idea that they are the baddest of the bad. But Harry as his soulmate? It just screws their whole plan up.”
But it felt out of nowhere. Harry wasn’t aware that he was stressed. But in hindsight, he could see why. Things just kept piling up for Harry, and he was not sure he’s had to opportunity to decompress.
Ron seemed like he wanted to retort but had nothing to deliver, until Fred and George ran in, bragging about a potion that would challenge the barriers, and in their gloating, Harry both heard Hermione groan, and saw as Malfoy rolled his eyes, already predicting their failure. And Harry smiled, as he imagined a world where Voldemort didn’t exist, where social status didn’t matter and Malfoy and Hermione were friends, smarting their way out of any situation, dragging Ron and Harry out of danger and taking over the world with their wits. They would be dangerous together, and Harry craved it. Malfoy friends with his friends. Malfoy a part of his life.
Her tone showed clearly how she wasn’t going to take any bullshit from either of them, “You both have until we reach the box to talk it out and get over whatever drama you both have magically brewed up. We are here to have a nice evening as friends and family and you’re awkward mood is ruining it for all of us.”
“Cross my heart.”
I wrote the first half of this before the trip and the second half in the last 24 hours. To be 100% honest with you, there was a small shift in the story because I genuinely can't remember what ... what Harry's plan was. (I should've written it down.) I'm still not sure about the path I took, or even where this might lead. But I'm strangely excited for the shift.
Draco lips pursed, looking down, helping Harry realize that in his small monologue he invaded Draco’s personal space. Harry waited for a sign that Draco wanted him to leave it, hoping for the opposite. When Harry didn’t move, Draco did it himself, going down one step, his right hand bracing the rail. “Secon-”
The trio remained silent, absorbing the suck-fest that was this realization.
Draco pulled his hands away but never out of reach and that’s how Harry knew he was just playing with him, not really pushing him away, “What, are you such a gryffindor that you have to do everything in packs?”
Ron stared at him, almost expressionless, but Harry could see that Ron was having a hard time accepting the truth that whether he liked it or not, Harry and Malfoy now came as a package deal -and they always really have, they just didn’t want to see it-, and a hard time figuring out how this one could be solved. I mean, no matter what problems life threw their way, Ron, Hermione and he would always find a way out of it together. But…
Amos slowly started what could only be described as a nervous laughter and then gave a goofy shrug, “So, it’s not as bad. Doesn’t change the fact that he pissed off a hippogriff as an excuse to get a teacher fired,” He then turned to Arthur and very loudly in a ‘murmur’ gossip tone, “Do you remember Malfoy, following the minister around demanding that they fired that poor Hagrid?”
“All I could think is… ‘Great. Another person who’s going to hurt you, and you are going to foolishly enough let them do it. Because you’re so desperate to have anyone love you, that you’ll take it wherever you can get it.’”
1. I did NOT proofread this, or beta this or anything. So, even I don't know what's in this chapter.
Zabini looked like he was tired of this argument, Parkinson looked like this argument was far from over, and Draco didn’t even look like he was paying attention. So of course he nearly jumped out of his skin when Harry snuck behind them and pulled on Draco’s belt loops.
I will try to warn per chapter, and if there's a trigger in this one I will add the warning later. Like I said, not a fucking clue what I just posted except that it's filler.
Sleep was a complicated issue for him when he was in Gryffindor tower. It sometimes came when he didn’t want it, but mostly it never did. But next to this boy… it was like calmly submerging himself into still waters.
Harry thought about it. What would he commit a crime for? What would he metaphorically tarnish his soul for?
Harry softly moved to try and look at Draco’s face and confirm this. It was true. Lucius restrained himself from scarring Draco’s face. Probably realized-
“Yes.”
Ron choked on a chuckle, hiding his face in his arms as Binns glared at them, Hermione whispering to Harry, also amused, “Good things come to those who wait.”
I'm sorry for the rant. Enjoy.
“I ask that you monitor him from now on. Stress is bound to show more symptoms soon, this will most likely not be the last. If you notice he’s having trouble sleeping, try everything on this list first before resorting to the potion, understand, Mr. Weasley?”
“Draco,” Harry whispered, pausing at seeing the boy shake his head.
I'm sorry if the next one takes a while, and feel sorry for me if it doesn't(cuz i'm gonna get an F).
Harry nodded, leaned back and offered his hand again.
Harry nodded, “I prefer you over Hermione sometimes, she’d just tell me to wait to figure out how to diffuse Lefty’s anger. And then scold me. But also prefer Hermione… she would help me understand in depth what I did wrong and how I could do better.”
Oops. It's been a month.
The itch and his sleepiness came back, “Is there any way your father had anything to do with it?”
Ron had an array of reactions to what he saw. First he laughed even more. Then he started to tell Harry how that had to mean that Malfoy was his enemy, cutting it quick and short when Harry lifted up his right wrist to remind him who his real enemy was. Then it finally settled in and the harsh wave of shock hit Ron, mouth agape, eyes wide open, looking at Harry like a fish out of water. And finally, pity.
He nodded, “Defense class. Focus on the new teacher, new students and new schools. Got it.”
Harry looked up to see it was now Draco who’d yet to open his eyes, confusion and fear adorning his face. He shook his head, “That doesn’t make sense either.”
Hermione piped in, uncomfortable and shy, “It’s the dark mark, Harry. His… mark. It appears above an area where his followers or he… has killed…”
“Mr Malfoy!” shouted Harry as he finally caught up with him. “Wait!”
“Hullo, Mrs Nott,” he responded.
“I don’t know why it is the way it is,” Malfoy seemed to be speaking no sense, “but I need to find out. I need you to help me find out.”
“I don’t think it’s true, you know,” said Harry, noticing his words were starting to string together from the alcohol. The warm air had hit him when he had walked outside, and all the alcohol he had drank was now noticeable.
Looking down at the glass of whiskey in his hand, Harry couldn’t help but smile as more tears filled his eyes. He had always wished there were something he could do in return for the Weasleys, they had nurtured him since he was twelve years old, and still to this day treated him as their own son or brother. Even after his breakup with Ginny.
So, he sheepishly walked over to the bed and sat next to Draco, who tightly kept their hands locked together.
“A clothes shop?” asked Harry with a confused expression.
“I saw Pansy on and off while we were at Hogwarts, and I had a fling with Blaise and a few Slytherin girls, but I never settled until I got with Astoria,” admitted Malfoy, the words slipping off his tongue so easily Harry had barely noticed he’d admitted being with a man. “And now I’m unhappy in my marriage.”
“You wanted to see us, father?” said Malfoy confidently as he strode into the room. Harry traipsed behind him, his hands shaking from fear.
“You too,” laughed Harry, walking out of the shared bathroom. He made his way back to his bedroom, luckily the only thing in this place he didn’t have to share. It was small, the walls engulfed him sometimes, but he was thankful he could have his own privacy. The walls were bare and black, with only one small window, which Harry was just able to see the sunrise through.
“Are you still with Ginny?”
“No thanks,” Ron rolled his eyes.
His mother, who’s life was taken from him at such a young age, that there were no memories Harry could recall of her.
“Father,” said a familiar voice. “Why don’t you continue with breakfast, I’ll deal with Potter.” Lucius looked over at Malfoy for a moment, then smirked and nodded.
“Do you need someone to talk to?” asked Harry, still stood outside the room. He didn’t want to overstep his boundaries, in this situation Malfoy was in control. He controlled everything to do with Harry. Where he slept, how long he slept for, when he ate, if he was to survive another day or not. Though Harry had backchatted a few times, he always stayed slightly fearful of Malfoy, as much as he didn’t want to.
“Yeah, but this is Malfoy,” replied Ron.
“Oh no, too much drinking with Malfoy,” said Ron, sitting next to Harry while Hermione went to make a pot of tea.
Draco had to relive those experiences every time he had to make a dodgy deal at Borgin and Burkes, which to Harry’s current knowledge, was nothing to do with Lucius as he had originally thought. There was something else, something serious, going on and Draco had to put himself through hell every time he needed to get a dark artefact.
“It’s awful,” grumbled Ron, taking a big swig of his butterbeer. “Bloody Malfoy. Him and his family are just so rude. They don’t care about anyone but themselves. Malfoy sometimes makes fun because we were always fighting at Hogwarts.”
The light appeared again. But this time, it did not become the wolf. Instead, the silver light approached him, flickering between being bright and dim. Slowly, it crept its way towards Harry’s ear.
“I have something to tell you both,” she spoke in a hushed tone, she didn’t want anyone else to know.
“Seamus told me,” replied Ron.
“Malfoy, I don’t understand,” said Harry quietly. His mouth felt dry, he needed a glass of water. Malfoy spent a few moments thinking about what to say. He stayed faced away from Harry, staring out of the window that looked upon some woods.
Malfoy seemed taken aback. “No, I’m fine.”
“Where did you hear that?” asked Harry, suddenly interested. He remembered those men in Malfoy’s office talking about that, but Malfoy had insisted the accusations were false. Surely Hermione couldn’t know about it?
“Oh?” Narcissa asked, quite obviously uninterested.
That night at dinner, Hermione had some gossip for them all. She sat down almost excitedly, smoothing her maids dress as she did.
“Draco?” another voice called from behind them. Harry turned to see Astoria, running down the garden in bare feet, her long white dress flowing behind her. Sometimes Harry saw Astoria in the gardens just before dawn, in her white dresses, making her look like a ghost that haunted the grounds.
When the feeling finally stopped, he started to take in his surroundings. A strong damp smell filled his senses as his eyes adjusted to the dark.
“Face it, sir, you care about me,” said Harry sarcastically, with a small smirk on his thin lips. Laughing, Malfoy shrugged and pushed himself off the desk.
“I need you to stand watch,” instructed Malfoy, pointing towards the door without looking at Harry. “No one is allowed down here. It’s strictly out of bounds, and you are not allowed to tell anyone what is down here.”
“Oh yes, he’s dreadful,” agreed Hermione. “Mrs Malfoy doesn’t seem too bad, either, though. I mean, I still like her for saving Harry’s life.”
“Goodnight, ‘Mione,” said Harry, giving her small frame a squeeze before turning on his heel and walking out of the staff dining room.
“If you don’t, you need to name someone. You were the leader of this operation, Draco. You are the one who has to finish everything up.”
, and suddenly Harry didn’t want to be in the room anymore.
The time rolled around for the guests to arrive, and they flowed in. A few Slytherins they recognised, such as Goyle, didn’t cause them any bother. It was odd to see him without Crabbe by his side.
“Get back in there,” sneered Lucius, pushing Harry back into the dining room. Hermione from across the room audibly gasped, her cheeks going red as she looked down, avoiding eye contact with Lucius. Harry knew how terrified she was recently, after finding out the possibility that Lucius was Obliviating Muggleborns. Hermione tried her hardest not to step out of line, to do everything right, as if she was back in Hogwarts studying for an exam.
“Potter quit getting on my nerves,” Malfoy looked at him, his icy grey eyes glimmered in the dim light, causing Harry’s heart to skip a beat. “You are paid to follow my orders and that’s all. You are not supposed to speak or ask any stupid questions,” Malfoy was getting angrier by the second. “This isn’t Hogwarts anymore. We’re not flying our broomsticks trying to chase a fucking snitch, we’re adults dealing with adult things,” shaking his head, Malfoy turned back to the drawer.
“I’m fine,” said Harry, attempting to keep his cool.
“Hermione!” called Astoria. Hermione turned to look at her, a grin on her face.
Without saying anything else, Malfoy raised his wand. Eyes closed, he took a few deep breaths, before saying, “Expecto patronum.”
“Draco,” started Harry, before he was cut off.
A life he now knew he wanted to spend the rest of with Harry Potter.
Malfoy clumsily grabbed his wand and drew out the constellation with it. The stars in the sky joined up together with lines.
Suddenly, there it was again, watching him coolly, like Draco always did. Even when in pain, even when weak, Draco would remain calm and collected, unlike his days at Hogwarts. With a nod of its head, the wolf turned and began to walk again. The light was still dim, so Harry made a point of walking quicker than before, ensuring he’d reach the destination before Draco got too weak.
They stepped forwards, but just as he was about to reach the door, Draco stopped. “Do you think they will be angry to see me, the Weasleys?”
The thoughts of his past shrouded his mind as he headed towards Borgin and Burkes. It seemed he couldn’t escape them anymore. A while back he was able to push them down, ignore them as much as possible. Every thought that entered his mind he could bat away by doing extra work, talking to Astoria, going for trips with her. But now it seemed as though nothing could get rid of them. Partially he blamed Potter, having him back in his life made everything harder. Every time Draco saw Potter’s face, he felt his scars ache. But, another part of him always wanted to be with Potter. There was a comfort to his voice, the same messy hair that he had all throughout Hogwarts, the same stubbornness and back-chatting. Potter made Draco feel like a kid again, in all the best ways possible.
“You got me food?” Asked Harry, looking down at the yummy looking soup before back up at Malfoy.
The drinks flowed, and for the first time in days, Harry saw Draco smile, laugh, having fun.
“What, Potter?” asked Malfoy, obviously irritated, still staring at the fire.
“Harry-”
“Are… Are you okay?” Slowly Malfoy looked up at Harry. His lip was no longer swollen, and the cut was nearly gone, Harry had noticed there was a bottle of healing potion on the table.
“Me too, ‘Mione, but we can get through it.”
As soon as Harry entered the staff dining room, Hermione was by his side, pulling him into a warm hug.
“We’re going to do everything we can to keep you safe,” said Mr Weasley with a nod, and Mrs Weasley then nodded too.
“Please, keep your voice down.”
Then, they adopted a son, whom they named Scorpius Malfoy. The name Astoria had always dreamt of giving to a son.
“Thank you,” said Mr Weasley as he entered the room.
“We have been preparing for tonight’s events,” said the wizard with a nod.
“I’m fine,” said Harry, attempting to shake himself out of it. But it seemed the more he thought about it, the more tired he felt. Stifling a yawn, Harry straightened himself up when the doors opened, and the Malfoy family walked in. Malfoy looked just as tired as Harry did, which didn’t take Harry by surprise.
“I’m okay thank you,” said Harry, shuffling uncomfortably. “And yourself?”
“I need to ask the biggest favour,” he swallowed, “I’ve ran away from the manor.”
“Don’t say anything,” their hands were still connected.
“Is everything okay?” asked Harry gently, placing his spoon down.
“That’s that side of the job. Sometimes I like going places with him. We go to places I wouldn’t dare step foot in without Malfoy. Like Borgin and Burkes, for example.”
“That’s true, they’re so creepy,” said Ron, shuddering a little then groaning when one of George’s chess pieces destroyed his. “How are you getting better at this?”
“By me.”
“Yes, this is true, father,” responded Malfoy, his voice small.
Harry’s heart raced. “Okay.”
“A little,” replied Harry, before sucking a sharp intake of breath through clenched teeth as Malfoy accidentally pressed too hard.
Ron seemed taken aback. “Not great, sir. They’re thinking of taking him to St Mungo’s mind healing facility.”
“Why?”
Harry could feel his ears burning and goose bumps on the back of his neck. Why did Malfoy thank him, in front of everyone, the people who used to join in on bullying him? Shaking his head, Harry attempted to silently laugh off the thought. He was nothing but a bodyguard, a butler, to Malfoy. That’s all he ever will be. No matter the kiss, no matter the hug, no matter their deep conversations. Malfoy was married, trying to have a child, and Harry
“What do you mean?” asked Hermione, looking at him with a frown.
Harry changed into his butler clothes. Since being upgraded to bodyguard, he wore more comfortable clothes, something that if he needed to quickly save Malfoy’s life would be easy to do so in. He had forgotten how uncomfortable the collar of the suit was and how hot the waistcoat made him.
“I am not in the mood today, mate,” Ron sighed, running his fingers through his messy ginger hair. Nodding in agreement, Harry put some toothpaste onto his toothbrush. Ron was one of his closest friends from his days at Hogwarts. He had taken Harry under his wing when Harry had first arrived, showed him the ropes, helped him when Harry had gotten stuck or in trouble. Ron had been Harry’s saving grace, both him and his wife, Hermione.
“Fire-call other ministries. France and Germany will definitely be on our side as it has been affecting them too,” explained the wizard as he nodded towards the other three wizards in the room. “Try and fire-call any other ministries you think may also get involved,” he looked at the witch this time, “prepare a special floo network to the safe house. Mr Malfoy has stated it is protected with every bit of magic possible as Mr Potter is there. They have a floo system.”
Or did he seem happy? Harry thought back to all the times he had seen them together. Astoria would cling to Malfoy’s arm, chatting away, while Malfoy looked miles away, eyes completely glazed over, expression forever unchanging. Their conversations were always one sided, and if Malfoy were to ever reply, it would just be in agreement for what she was saying. The conversations they had never seemed deep, never seemed personal, just Astoria telling him about the clothes she bought, or the letters her family had owled to her. She would kiss him on the cheek, and he wouldn’t smile, he wouldn’t blush, he wouldn’t even blink, he’d just stare straight ahead and nod to her in response. There was no affection there.
His face was red and crumpled, his eyes brimming with tears threatening to fall with the next blink.
Smiling, Narcissa nodded. “Oh. Of course, Mr Potter,” she said, and just as Harry was about to leave the room, she called, “tell my son I said hello.”
As he opened his eyes, Harry felt the throbbing pain shoot through his head. The room spun around him as he attempted to sit up, his entire body swaying to the side as he did so. This hangover was the worst he’d had in a long time.
“Where are we going?”
“Here you are, sir,” said Harry, placing the papers in front of Malfoy. He didn’t respond, his lips pressed together, staring down at the other papers that were scattered on his desk. For a split moment, Harry watched Malfoy. The infamous blonde hair slicked back neatly, tucked behind his ears. It had grown a small length since he had been at Hogwarts, reaching just above his shoulders, and always looked tidy. Malfoy’s grey eyes shone in the dim light, even while looking down, something that seemed completely mesmerising to Harry.
“Ron too?” Harry asked, moving his hands from behind his back, feeling some form of relief.
“Oh, so now I’m losing my helper!” shouted Mrs Weasley as Ron dragged Harry away, making the two boys laugh. Harry’s laughing stopped as soon as he walked into the room though. There sat George, glass of whiskey in his hand, opposite to Mr Weasley. He looked skinnier than Harry had ever seen him, ginger hair a mess, dark circles under his eyes.
Shaking himself off, Harry finally asked, “anything else?”
“Harry,” Hermione looked at him, “do you seriously not think she understands the situation at hand?” Harry’s eyes widened as he stared at his best friend.
“No, I’m not.”
Finally, something was going to be done, and maybe one day he could have an easy life.
Finally grabbing his wand, Harry rushed after the wolf. He found it making it’s way down the stairs and he made the choice to follow. Looking at the bedroom where Mr and Mrs Weasley slept, he whispered, “I’m sorry,” before turning and heading down the stairs too.
“It’s fine,” responded Harry with a gentle smile, “what are you doing up?”
“No,” Malfoy closed his eyes again.
“Isn’t he supposed to be careful who he spends his time with?” asked Hermione inquisitively, her eyebrows furrowing as she poured cups of tea for the trio.
“Do you want anything? Tea?”
“Suits you,” he said, his arms folded.
“Why?” asked Ron with a slight frown. “You okay mate?”
“Well done, my boy,” cheered Lucius. But Malfoy couldn’t stay there a moment longer.
“What are they?”
Harry found himself falling asleep with his clothes still on, his mind whirring with thoughts about Malfoy.
to toy around with? I thought you’d know me better by now.”
“Adding more rules in that haven’t been enforced, sending more Muggleborns to be obliviated. It’s not a rule for them to be, only Squibs,” the man tried to explain.
“No,” said Harry, still staring at the dark red boat, mesmerised by its colour. “I don’t.”
“I heard Astoria talking to someone,” she replied, tucking her wild curls behind her ear.
“Alright, no need to become big headed, golden boy. I’ll make you work the rest of the day and the night if you’re not careful.”
“Of course. Good day, gentlemen,” said Malfoy, coolly waving his wand to open the doors. The men left, and Harry took a deep breath. Malfoy got up and walked over to Harry. He could feel Malfoy’s breath on his ear as the blond-haired man leaned down.
“Thank
Malfoy sharply turned a corner and Harry followed. This was a section of Malfoy Manor he had never been allowed to before. There were certain rooms the staff were allowed in, and there were forbidden places too. Bedrooms were a no, unless specifically asked. Harry knew Hermione had been in Astoria’s bedroom, as Hermione and Astoria seemed quite friendly with each other. It was because of their values, Harry thought, since Hermione was a Muggleborn but also one of the smartest and most successful witches of this age. Astoria deeply admired that and seemed to dislike the fact that Hermione worked for her. Though, this didn’t stop her from being harsh on Hermione when the time was right.
“I’ll think of something, Potter. Now go to your room. I never want this to happen again, do you understand me?” And with that, Astoria dragged Malfoy to his bedroom. Harry stood there, watching them go. The jealousy was back. It should be him helping Malfoy to his room, him tucking him into the bed, him giving Malfoy a gentle kiss on the forehead to say goodnight.
“I am, Malfoy,” responded Harry, staring straight into the grey eyes that pierced back. There was something different about them. Usually when Malfoy was angry, they reflected that, narrowing as they glared, but today they stayed wide. They darted between Harry’s eyes, unable to keep focused on one thing. He was scared. But scared of what, Harry didn’t know.
Malfoy swallowed, “now you’re being unfair.”
“I’m only saying what I heard Astoria talk about. Besides, Mr Weasley has said he doesn’t, so I should believe that,” Hermione wrapped her cardigan around her in frustration.
“It certainly is, considering you are threatening me.”
“What does this have to do with me?”
“Yes, I can! I have to, Blaise. Can’t you see that?” There was a long pause. Harry stepped back, accidentally bashing his foot into a wall with a clash. In an attempt to make it look like he had only just arrived, Harry continued walking forwards and turned the corner to see the two men stood there, Malfoy’s cheeks pink.
“Wh-What will I have to do in return, sir?” asked Ron. Harry could sense his fear, which always seemed odd to him, because Ron had never feared Malfoy before. But the situation had changed, and there was always the worry of Lucius obliviating Hermione. Doing so would have her lose all memories of her children, her life with Ron, everything she had ever learned about the Wizarding World. After finding out that there was a possibility of Lucius obliviating muggleborns, Ron had been on high alert, making sure he didn’t do anything wrong and working twice as hard. Which also meant being scared of Malfoy.
“Draco-“ said Harry quietly.
“Potter,” said Malfoy, “I need you to run some errands with me. Weasley, you can have the rest of the day off. How’s George?”
,” Hermione piped up.
“You know how scary he is. I’m so sorry,” Malfoy’s hand gently grabbed onto Harry’s limp one, squeezing it tight. Slowly his thumb stroked Harry’s hand, soothing him, comforting him. It felt nice.
“Don’t you ever apologise,” she beamed, looking up at him with pride in her eyes. “You’re very busy nowadays.”
“Now as I was saying,” she continued her story. “I heard Lucius is also obliviating Muggleborns.”
“Harry-”
“It’s
“We have now seen you selling illegal artefacts to the shop,” said the man, allowing the other to release Draco’s neck. All he wanted to do was cough and splutter, take in deep breaths, but he didn’t. Instead, he kept his mouth shut, and he stared at the men in front of him. He didn’t want to look weak.
Everyone was left in shock. It was dumbfounding to hear Draco speak about destroying Lucius’ career, after all those years at Hogwarts of Draco arguing about how great his father was.
Though feeling uneasy, Harry couldn’t help but have a spark of excitement running through him. He watched Draco every so often, seeing a twinkle in his eyes, the colour returning to his face. Draco had started speaking quicker and more eccentric as he usually did, just like the days in Hogwarts when he got excited about his grades or showed off his new broom.
“Yes, sir?” asked Harry, standing on the other side of the desk.
Harry stopped. The blood ran cold through his veins.
All the while, Malfoy stood by the wall, whimpering to himself, his grey eyes brimmed with tears.
“This week has just been awful,” she told him as they sat down to eat their food. “George has been doing worse. He’s seeing his mind healer every day now, but he’s been drinking every night. It’s since he told Ron he wasn’t doing well, it’s as if he’s accepted it and now that’s how he is. Ron’s sick with worry,” Hermione shook her head, wiping her eyes with her hands.
“It’s dangerous,” hissed Malfoy back, “if he catches you here, if
After changing into something more comfortable, Harry then floo’d himself to the pub. Already there were Ron and Hermione, with their two children, Hugo and Rose. Along with them, Neville sat. He joined in every so often, after his wife, Hannah, became the new landlady. Harry was always happy to see any of his old Hogwarts alumni.
“You know what the Malfoys are like,” Harry lied, knowing he couldn’t slip up and accidentally tell them. It was almost top secret what Malfoy took Harry to do with him, and he knew Malfoy selling cursed artefacts was definitely against the law, even with Lucius in charge.
“It could be days, but it could be months,” stated Mrs Weasley, sadness in her voice.
“Oh, Harry,” exclaimed Hermione as she ran over to him, engulfing him in the biggest hug he had in a long time. It had been two weeks since he had left the manor and so far, he appeared to be safe.
“Well what?”
“Oh, Mrs Malfoy, I’m fine,” lied Harry with a fake smile, “go back to Draco.”
Leaning against the wall, he breathed deeply, trying to soothe his throbbing cheek.
“You’re never in the mood,” chuckled Harry, putting the toothbrush into his mouth.
“You’re being extremely unfair.”
Draco lay in the bed, staring at the window, his eyes completely dried out of tears while the pillow remained soaked in them.
“Yes, Mrs Weasley?” answered Harry, making his way over to her. Without saying anything, she pulled Harry into a large hug, squeezing him tightly.
“I can’t explain, I’m sorry,” said Malfoy coldly.
“I didn’t know what the curse did. I found it in Snape’s copy of
Harry’s heart dropped. Surely Astoria had thought of a good enough excuse to cover for them? Or did she tell him the truth out of spite? No, Harry thought, she was far too sweet to do anything like that. Besides, it was obvious Harry was with Malfoy last night, both disappeared while the party was still ongoing.
The lift sent him to the lower most floor and he exited, quietly but quickly making his way to a room he found himself in often. There stood four other people, one witch and three wizards. They turned to look at him as the door clicked shut behind.
“I need Potter,” he said.
“And guess what I found out was the inane, absolutely foolish stunt you pulled to have yourself assaulted? Selling illegal dark artefacts to Borgin and Burkes from our own personal, private collection,” explained Lucius in a quiet, cool voice. How he spoke had Harry’s hair standing up on end.
“Will you two be quiet!” They heard Malfoy’s voice call from the office. Instantly Harry’s cheeks went bright red, his ears burning.
Malfoy swiftly walked over to the counter as if he already knew what he wanted. Tottering behind slowly, Harry darted his eyes to the lunch menu. The food was simple, the usual muggle café type of food.
“It appears the Muggleborns didn’t have a job, so instead of being sent to the workhouses, the Healers took them in,” Lucius shook his head. “Disgusting.”
“I know,” answered Harry quietly, “Sirius reminded me of that when I faced Voldemort.”
“Why?”
“You’re unwell. You can’t work like this,” Malfoy pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket. Of course, it was black silk, with ‘DM’ embroidered in red thread. “Here, for your cheek.” Harry took it from him uncertainly and pressed it against his cheek, sucking in through his teeth as the fabric pained him.
“Can I ask, why me?”
He stood outside the office again with Ron, hands behind his back. Slowly he moved his head from side to side, his neck cracking as he did. The position caused him to seize up all the time, making his shoulders and neck ache.
But Harry knew he wouldn’t last. Quickly he grabbed onto Malfoy’s arms and attempted to disapparate. How they managed to make it back to Harry’s bedroom without being splinched was a miracle, but as soon as they arrived back, Harry ran to the toilet and promptly threw up.
“Then let me help you.”
“Good luck,” he said, before shutting the door.
They walked in and she sent Harry straight over to the burrow’s lounge, where Harry found George and Mr Weasley.
“Mrs Malfoy,” said Harry as he folded Narcissa’s beautiful gowns, “may I be excused?”
Hermione’s life was in Harry’s hands.
“So’s Narcissa. I almost prefer working for her than Draco,” laughed Harry as he ran his hands through his hair.
“Seamus was right,” whispered Harry to Ron. “He’s definitely in a foul mood.”
“That’s okay, sir. I’ll be outside if you need anything,” said Harry, a small smile on his thin lips. Malfoy just nodded in response as Harry exited the office, closing the doors behind him and attempted to ignore all of Ron’s questions about why Malfoy seemed drunk.
Moving his lips from the mark, Harry then pulled Malfoy close and their lips brushed together before they began to kiss each other, passionately, lovingly.
“Lucius?”
Harry shook his head, letting out a laugh. “You made me believe you trusted me. You made me believe I was worth more than my position in your manor.”
“So,” said Malfoy, handing Harry another drink, this time of wizard’s brew. “Amuse me. What’s the real reason you and Ginny broke up?”
Sat at the desk was Malfoy, his head in his hands. His shoulders were moving up and down as he let out quiet, muffled sobs. Paper was strewn everywhere, as if he had just thrown it in a rage, and the teapot was smashed on the floor.
Lips pursed together; Harry decided to keep quiet. Sometimes he forgot that they were adults, his childhood had been ripped from him since he was one years old. After that, he was never able to have fun like a kid, even when he went to Hogwarts. In his first year he had battled against Voldemort for the first time.
Not too long later, the burrow was filled with witches and wizards from all over the world, including their ministers. Draco stood in the corner of the room, watching them with fear in his eyes, as they all talked together planning their attack.
Malfoy glared at him. “Because, Potter, if we take another day trip somewhere, I’d rather be seen with someone who doesn’t look like they’re stuck in the nineties. Please, go and try that on. I’ll bring you more.”
“Whenever you are ready, son,” Lucius said, stepping back to allow Malfoy to take the limelight. For a moment he just stood, staring at the floor, building up the confidence. Then he walked forwards, standing in front of the Squib. Slowly raising his wand, Malfoy’s eyes began to tear up before he furiously blinked them away.
“Lucius obliviating Muggleborns. I don’t think he’d be allowed to,” said Harry, looking over to the sunset again. There was something about the red and orange hues that always drew him in. The sunset was always better than sunrise, he thought, as he enjoyed the darkness of the night that followed. There was something that seemed so personal about a sunset to him, and he couldn’t quite put his finger on why.
Malfoy looked down to the ground, almost in shame. “You’re the only chance I have at being safe.”
“Am I? Or are you? There are so many things you refuse to tell me. The dealings at Borgin and Burkes, the men who have twice, now, attacked you, and now this secret meeting? Red ribbons? What the fuck?”
“That’s none of your business.”
Their relationship had fizzled a year ago, and she had moved out. They both wanted different things. She went on to play for the Holyhead Harpies Quidditch team, and she loved every second of it. Harry adored seeing her thrive in something she was excelling at. But she was always gone to play matches, and he spent most of the year on the grounds of Hogwarts, not wanting to leave during Christmas as it was so magical at that time of year. Naturally, their relationship died, but they remained friendly whenever they saw each other. Sometimes Harry missed her touch, her voice calling him in the morning, sitting by the fire with hot chocolates together, but he always knew it was for the best.
“Whoever uses it can change the future of who they are telling the future of. It can result in death if the caster so wishes,” said Malfoy. Harry felt his blood boil. Why would Malfoy sell something like this to Mr Borgin, who would just sell it to someone else? Why didn’t Malfoy just keep it in his manor with all those other artefacts? He stayed silent, but felt his hands begin to shake.
“What?”
“What, Draco? I’d like to join them.”
“I mean, I guess,” said Harry quietly. George picked up on this and looked at him, his eyes wide.
His mother, who’s eyes stared back at him every time he looked in the mirror.
“Hullo Mrs Weasley,” said Harry as he wrapped his arms around her plump frame.
The Weasleys had automatically set to work, setting up the attic with Harry so it was sustainable for him to live in. There were piles of junk up there, including boxes and boxes of memories Harry was sure he’d end up looking through when boredom struck. While Mr and Mrs Weasley dusted away the cobwebs, George and Harry brought up a mattress and bedding.
Harry didn’t realise he had been silent for a while, taking Malfoy’s words in. Slowly he looked up, seeing Malfoy’s grey eyes staring back.
isn’t?”
The warm air hit Harry in his face, contrasting with how cold the manor always was. Malfoy had already started walking over the cobblestones, heading towards the centre of the town. Malfoy stayed silent the whole walk, just looking straight ahead, his chin up in the confident manor he always held himself. The town was truly beautiful, the buildings were all old and mix matched, the floor was purely cobblestones that Harry almost struggled to walk on.
“What?”
The reason the room felt so familiar when Draco had been looking for dark artefacts, why he had always seemed so tense when they went in there. It was the cellar Bellatrix had used to hold prisoners, where Harry and Ron had ended up for a short amount of time, just before Dobby was murdered.
“What the-” said Harry before Malfoy snatched his hand away.
“Yes, Draco?” Harry gently tucked some blonde locks behind Draco’s pointed ear.
The thought had his head swimming, his eyes constantly fuzzy. He could barely see Harry crouched in front of him, barely feel the hands that squeezed tightly onto his. But he appreciated every second Harry spent attempting to comfort him.
“Draco?” asked Harry gently, standing up, trying not to stumble as the pain in his head throbbed.
A small smile pulled at Draco’s lips for the first time since Harry had disappeared.
“What do you want, Potter?” asked Malfoy, his voice cracking as he spoke.
Ron and Hermione had managed to get him a job working as a butler at Malfoy Manor, and he was honestly extremely grateful for that. It had seemed that Malfoy had argued the case that Harry should work for them, rather than go to the workhouses, because then they could keep a closer eye on him and torture him when they see fit.
Harry stared at him. At this moment, he felt nothing but hate. It was as if he were back at Hogwarts, all that anger he felt when he found out about Katie Bell, all the pain he felt when he saw Malfoy point his wand at Dumbledore. Hands beginning to shake, Harry finally lowered his wand. There was nothing he wanted to say to Malfoy anymore.
They spent the remainder of the morning reading through Draco’s logs, letters and talking about ideas that they could think of.
This would soon be his freedom.
“I went with Malfoy to a pub, where he wanted to go, and didn’t leave his side, just like I am paid to do, Hermione. That’s all.”
But, unfortunately, thirty minutes later, the wolf stopped. They had reached the outskirts of a village, one Harry knew to belong to wizards and witches.
“I’d say so,” Hermione finally picked up her fork and stabbed it into her food. “Stops them from conceiving even more evil into the world.”
“Please!” said Malfoy, nudging Harry with his elbow as Harry rose.
“Uh, I don’t mind, but if you want privacy you can go in the bathroom,” responded Harry. His ears started burning and he felt his cheeks flush. Nodding again, Malfoy walked into the bathroom but left the door open. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry watched him slowly peel off the wet turtleneck, revealing his very thin body. It was a small shock to Harry how thin he was, he could see Malfoy’s ribcage and spine. The scars that Harry had given him decorated his body, reminding Harry of their fucked-up past. They seemed worse than he remembered, deeper and many more than he thought. Closing his eyes, he looked away, attempting to fight back tears.
“It’s my pleasure,” answered Harry as they all sat down at the table, the other patient leaving to give the three some alone time.
The floo powder brought him to the door of the house. A sweet cottage on the outskirts of London, where their children could run around and play happily. Harry knocked on the old wooden door, groaning as his head pounded after every knock. The fresh air wasn’t helping in the slightest.
Draco thrived now, leaving as much of his pain behind as he could. Both he and Harry had begun to see mind healers, to work through their immense trauma, which only brought them closer together.
