Before Draco could fire back a retort, Potter pulled back. For a second, Draco thought he would leave. Then again, this was his flat. So was he going to ask Draco to leave?
After grabbing his favourite jumper and a pair of black trousers, Draco stomped down the stairs and into the kitchen. He was in desperate need of some tea. There had to be something that would calm him down again.
“Oh. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no!” He jumped out of bed as fast as he could. He suddenly felt the need to get as far away from Potter as possible. “No. No, this can’t be.” He ran his fingers through his hair nervously, his mind reeling.
All Harry can do is stare, confusion and shock crashing down on him. Draco seems startled as well and Harry wonders why, when he’s the one who apparated here.
“You’re cute,” Malfoy says and casually brushes his fingers against Harry’s arm. “Could I maybe interest you in something… a little more intimate?”
Trying to keep his face impassive is so hard at this point, Draco pinches his own thigh under the table.
“Goodbye, Potter,” Malfoy said, his eyes still on his book. It didn’t stop Harry from sitting down next to him on the sofa.
“Yeah, don’t get used to it.” She gives Malfoy a gentle peck on the cheek and then smacks him on the back of his head. “Tell me if you need space. Don’t just abandon me, okay?”
“Yes. No. I don’t know,” Potter says, shaking his head. “He told me he was a virgin while we were fighting. I don’t think he would have otherwise. He said it was no big deal, but I don’t believe him.”
“Just shut up, Potter,” Malfoy says, in a much softer tone than his words warrant, and slowly puts his arms around Harry.
“I heard you the first time,” Draco snapped.  It was ridiculous. Draco glanced at the koala, which was still chewing. With one eye closed. Weird. “He doesn’t like me,” Draco pointed out, hoping this train of thought would convince Teddy of how impossible this was.
“It’ll take us so much longer to get down to the grounds if we sleep in the castle and something happens.”
It affects Draco more than he anticipated, seeing the goalposts and stands again. This is where Potter humiliated him, match after match. It’s hard to let go of the grudge he’s been holding against Potter for so long. It may make him a sore loser, but it was one of the things that had contributed to his father’s disappointment in him.
Potter’s lips were hesitant against his at first. But soon, his fingers were digging into Draco’s back as they both sucked the air out of each other’s lungs.
Draco scrunches up his nose. “I think I’ll stick with the pancakes. I mean, you did go through all the trouble of whipping up a baking mixture.”
Malfoy puts down his fork, props up his elbow on the table and leans his forehead against the back of his hand. “Potter, you’re such a knobhead.”
Harry smiled and got down on his knees. He had just enough time to open his arms before Celia and Teddy slammed into him.
“I think we should wait a bit longer,” Draco protested, sounding very skeptical. Harry trailed his fingers up his chest and buried his face in Draco’s hair.
Against his better judgement, Harry puts his arm around Malfoy’s midriff. His fingers twitch nervously and he realises he can feel Malfoy’s spine through his pyjamas. He traces it absentmindedly and only stops when he feels a featherlight touch on his cheek. He gulps when Malfoy brushes a few strands of hair out of his eyes and then lets his thumb glide down Harry’s cheek. Oh god. Oh god! Oh GOD!
But as embarrassing as this was, Harry hadn’t pulled away. That was a good sign, right? Well, he was still watching the movie intently. But he couldn’t be so distracted, he didn’t realise what was going on, right? Right? Well, Draco would have to get his attention to find out…
“Mr Malfoy,” Celia said, tugging at his robes. “It’s him, isn’t it?” she asked, her voice quivering with excitement.
Something suddenly changed in Potter’s expression, making Draco shiver. His eyes twinkled and his lips, his delicious lips, slowly stretched into a smile.
“Merlin, Draco, wait,” Potter laughed. He gently pushed him out of the way to coat his cock with more lube. “Okay, whenever you’re ready,” he grinned. Draco leaned down to kiss him again, until they were both short of breath. After making sure Potter wasn’t grinning anymore, he straightened himself and lifted his hips. He wrapped his hand around Potter’s cock, realising he had to bend in an awkward way to adjust himself. He did it as gracefully as he could, holding Potter’s cock in place as he slowly tried to lower himself on it.
Draco throws back his head indignantly, even though he planned on doing exactly what Potter just called him out on.
“Well,” Draco began, eyeing Potter’s burgundy T-shirt and his short trouser, which reached to his knees, “I was taught elegance is a virtue, as well as endurance. Clearly, a concept which seems to be lost on you.” He let his eyes wander over Potter’s body and gave him an appraising look when their eyes met again. Potter seemed to stifle a giggle.
Panic washed over him. Where had it gone? Draco hadn’t seen it since… since before Potter had shown up. How could he have forgotten about Baxter? Granted, the whole situation with Potter had been quite distracting, but still! Draco couldn’t believe himself.
“I think—” —it’s trying to get you to take your hand off me, Draco wanted to say. He decided against it. It would probably seem weird. “I think it’s just hungry,” he said with a shrug.
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?” Potter jumps off him, as though he’s just been stung by something poisonous.
Harry’s frown deepens. Is he? Desperate and lonely? Is that why his body is unwilling to move? It’s the last thing Harry wants to admit, but this… feels kinda nice. Oh god, he must be going bonkers. But Malfoy is asleep, unaware of Harry’s crisis. So there’s actually no harm, is there?
He bites his tongue when Potter’s fingers ghost over his cock. Merlin, this is unbearable. Why isn’t Potter touching him properly?
He grabs the hem of Potter’s jumper and pulls it over his head; the sensation of Potter’s bare chest pressed against his is almost too much. His hands cling to Potter’s shoulders as their mouths move together and Potter walks them over to the bed. Draco lets himself fall backwards when his calves touch something solid, pulling Potter down with him.
After a quick detour to the kitchens, Harry finds himself in front of the Niffler’s burrow once more.
“Oi, Malfoy,” he heard Potter call. Draco briefly closed his eyes and took a deep breath before he threw a questioning look over his shoulder. Potter was smiling at him. Shyly. Sweet Merlin!
Draco can’t finish the thought. He shakes his head at himself. And that’s when he see it. The sky. The clouds. They’re red, as though they’re on fire. Something’s going on.
On more than one occasion, he’s grateful the Slytherin can’t speak. He’s not particularly keen on hearing all the nasty things he’d undoubtedly throw in his face. But it must be eating him up inside, not being able to scream at Harry for what he did to him.
“We probably would have made the history books, though,” he says, trying to sound light-hearted. “A Slytherin and a Gryffindor being friends…” He laughs nervously. The silence that follows seems significant somehow and Harry quickly coughs to break the tension. Being ‘light-hearted’ around Malfoy is proving to be very difficult.
“You never were the most observant type,” he murmured, his eyes flickering over Harry’s face. A smile tugged on the corner of Harry’s mouth as he leaned forward. He unconsciously held his breath as he let his lips brush over Draco’s, savouring the warmth and the silky feeling of his mouth. He barely noticed the loud cheers and wolf-whistles behind him.
Harry hesitates, feeling caught. He doesn’t, though. He doesn’t feel that way about Malfoy. It’s all just been teasing and winding each other up and… and…
“Remember the plan, Potter,” he hisses, crouching down, mimicking Potter. “Or do you need me to go over it one more time?”
Casting a quick cleansing charm on the socks, Draco put them on again, along with some fresh clothes and made his way back to the kitchen. Just as he was about to enter, however, he heard a squeal that made him stop.
“Is that a no?” Potter asked. Draco looked away, not sure what to say. As much as he enjoyed spending time with him, the way Potter was behaving made everything so hard. Draco wasn’t sure he could do it for much longer without exploding. Maybe it would be better to pause this friendship thing for a little bit. When his eyes found Potter’s again, his mouth opened involuntarily. Potter’s eyes were piercing and there was an odd expression on his face.
The following silence felt so pregnant with meaning, it was stifling. Potter, opening up like that, showing Draco all his vulnerabilities… He had no idea how to process that.
Harry sighs, but he can’t suppress a snigger. “I’m just saying… I wouldn’t be who I am today without you.”
“No,” Draco says, mentally slapping himself when he hears the panic in his own voice. “No, thank you.”
“Do they hurt?” he asks softly. “The scars?” At first, Harry thinks Malfoy isn’t going to answer. It feels like minutes have passed when Malfoy taps once. No
“Potter,” somebody whines. Harry blinks and sees Zabini standing a few feet away from them. “I thought this whole thing would finally be over! Why did you have to go and snog him? Now he will never shut up about you!”
Draco is so sick of Weasley screaming. He almost wishes he was deaf himself. Then, he wouldn’t have to listen to either of those Gryffindor buffoons.
“Great, now that your friends are here, there’s really no need for me to stick around,” he says, smoothing down his robes.
Halfway into the class, it becomes apparent that Harry doesn’t need to touch anything to make Malfoy’s worst nightmares come true.
“There,” Draco whispers, pointing at the boy sitting by the fire. He looks like somebody just told him he failed all of his exams.
“Look, Draco, it’s not like I enjoy talking about these things, I just— The others… They don’t really get it. I mean, we all lost people, so they understand the grief, but… I just felt lost after the war, and my friends… they didn’t really understand what it was like for me.”
There, short and simple. Feeling pleased with himself, he went back to the parlour. He halted when something strange caught his eyes. Why were there suddenly two owls blinking at him? Sceptically, he went over to the new owl. His eyes widened when he recognised Potter’s messy handwriting.
Draco’s eyes are fixed on her, his hands pressed against his mouth. Harry steps closer to him, his heart sinking. He looks so sad. No, sad isn’t the right word. He looks… shattered. As though he’s abandoned all hope.
“I—I heard what you said to Granger and Weasley,” Draco hears himself say. Potter pales. “I heard everything.”
Draco mentally curses his traitorous mind as his eyes wander back to Potter’s face. His lips are parted and he seems to be holding his breath. Draco rolls his eyes again as he slowly taps the Gryffindor’s hand. He’s incredibly grateful Potter can’t see him right now. Because then, he would have seen his snarl turning into something much more delicate. And that scares Draco even more than his nightmares.
“Well, I don’t have to deal with it alone anymore.” Potter reaches up and cups Draco’s cheek. “At least I’m hoping I won’t have to.”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake!” Draco cast a quick silencing charm, so his mother wouldn’t be alarmed by the koala’s squeaky screams. As he tucked his wand away, he noticed Teddy sniffing at his neck. “What are you doing?”
Malfoy, of course, doesn’t say anything to that and Harry wonders if he would, even if he were able to speak.
“Merlin, you’re so dramatic,” Potter chuckles. He lifts one of the rolls with perfect ease and dangles it in front of Draco. “Here you go.”
“We can’t risk more students getting kidnapped,” she says, her voice a bit steadier. “The entire school is in danger.”
on tumblr, who saved me and this fic by basically being my muse and who graciously allowed me to share a link to
“She did, actually,” Draco said with an amused smile. She made them before she left, knowing Blaise was going to visit while she was gone.
Them being friends was still very new to him and definitely needed some getting used to. Potter seemed already comfortable around Draco, always blabbering on about this and that, bumping Draco’s arm with his elbow, grinning at him mischievously…
He shakes his head, trying to get the image of Draco screaming and clinging to his lifeless body out of his mind.
“Ugh, please, I don’t want to hear your pathetic denial,” Malfoy says, scrunching up his nose. “Just remember that I tried to help you. Only,” he adds when Harry is about to say something, “because I want to spend this year in peace.”
“You do realise the way you looked in school wasn’t healthy, right? Now, you finally look like a person, not like a skeleton.”
Begrudgingly, Harry pulls back and quickly scans the room. There, beside the sink, is Penny, bouncing on some plates.
He rises from his seat and, suddenly, the room starts spinning. Bugger, maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to drink the whole bottle by himself after all. He probably wouldn’t have if Potter wasn’t such an annoying prat.
Potter blinks, confusion written all over his face, before his lips stretch into a soft smile. “No, I think you’re misunderstanding.”
Harry tries to interrupt her, but she talks over him. “I’m not saying I approve of it. I’m simply saying that—” She stops abruptly. A second later, Harry has a suspicion why. There’s a low moan to his left.
It took a moment before Potter answered. “Right. You’re right.” He sounded disappointed. It made Draco huff in anger.
“What is it?” he asks, an uneasy feeling bubbling up inside him. Waiting for Malfoy’s next move is as frustrating as watching the Snitch fluttering out of sight after having nearly caught it. Becoming impatient, he opens his mouth to ask one more time when he suddenly feels Malfoy’s fingers on his mouth. He stiffens, inhaling sharply.
Draco rolls his eyes at his boyfriend. As much as he dislikes cheesy gestures like this, he can’t help but notice his heart is beating a lot faster all of a sudden, which makes him smile. Damn Harry and his sweet gestures.
“I see,” Draco said, in lack of anything else to say. “But you really don’t know how you ended up as a koala?” he pressed. He sensed there was something Potter wasn’t telling him.
Draco exhales, not knowing what to do with these random pieces of information. “I guess I’ll have to talk to Potter about this.” He wrinkles his nose. “He was brought up by Muggles. Maybe he knows something.”
“Shut up.” Malfoy’s eyes bore into his as though he’s searching for something. “You’re the bloody Gryffindor here. You do it if you want to so badly.”
Harry reacted on instinct when he saw Malfoy draw his wand. He grabbed his own from the nightstand and pointed it at Malfoy.
“You can touch me too, if you want.” He swallows again as he slowly lets their fingers trail down his throat. Malfoy’s hand twitches in his and Harry pauses.
He marches over to the bed, both hands curled around his mug. He slips his feet beneath the duvet and leans his back against the wall.
Draco does, crossing his arms in front of his chest. He jerks when he feels warm hands on his back and immediately closes his eyes. Potter has never touched his bare skin like this before. It’s heaven. But it’s nothing compared to the feeling of Potter’s tongue. Draco has to keep himself from letting out a moan when Potter licks his back in one swift motion.
“Half of it is probably untrue, though,” Potter muttered. There was something in his voice that made Draco frown.
Internally grumbling, he jumps out of his seat. Before he even reaches the stairs, however, he feels a hand on his shoulder.
Potter puts his hand back on Draco’s cheek. “I’m happy because I’m finally in control of myself again and that means I can finally trust my gut again, my emotions. They’re not deceiving me anymore.” His eyes search Draco’s face. “And now, I—I guess I’m asking you if—if there’s a chance—”
“You did, didn’t you?” Harry says, leaning forward to examine Malfoy’s face more closely. It’s still blurry without his glasses.
He clutches the sink as he waits for his coffee, feeling like death warmed up. His head is pounding and it almost feels like his limbs are detached from his body. Good thing it’s Sunday. He wouldn’t survive Auror training like this.
At first, he had been wary of this weird Muggle device that had suddenly replaced one of their shelves in the living room. Harry had assured him, he’d like it. And he did. This television thing was quite entertaining. But that wasn’t the part Draco liked most.
Malfoy says nothing and just stares at him. His eyes wander over Harry’s body, making the back of his neck tingle.
Draco knew he was too frantic as he crossed Potter’s living room, but he couldn’t help it. He didn’t want another minute to go by with Potter being self-destructive.
He knows he should probably stop talking. But, again, something in Harry seems to be convinced that Malfoy understands. Maybe even more than Ron and Hermione.
Slowly, Draco sinks down to the ground. He hugs his knees, feeling a burning sensation in his chest. He has no idea how long he’s sitting there like this. When he unlocks the door again, it’s completely dark outside. He walks over to his bed, trying to be as quiet as possible. He gives Potter’s sleeping figure one quick glance, before he climbs into his bed.
He tried to move, but instantly stopped when a sharp tingling rushed through his body, right down to his loins, and his mind belatedly supplied him with the missing pieces.
He pays careful attention to his hand, currently resting against his collarbone. Under no circumstances is it to touch Potter’s. He has to make sure of it.
was the way to do it?” Potter yells. “God, for someone so intelligent, you’re such a fucking moron!”
“Are you… not sure how to answer that?” Two taps. “Huh. Yeah, we kinda limited your choice of answers, didn’t we?” He considers this, frowning in concentration. “How about this,” he says, and puts his index finger on Malfoy’s hand. “If you want to say ‘I don’t know’, you do this.” He draws a short line on the back of Malfoy’s hand. “Okay?”
Malfoy doesn’t move a muscle and Harry wonders once more what he’s thinking. It’s unnerving, talking to someone without seeing their reaction. He doesn’t know if Malfoy is stunned, afraid, or if he’s going to strangle Harry.
Connor looks over his shoulder, as though he’s worried about being seen with them. “I couldn’t say anything in front of the others,” he whispers.
Damn it, talking to Weasley was a mistake after all. Draco has no reason to trust that he’ll keep this to himself. He can only hope Weasley deems this too upsetting for Potter to blab Draco’s observations. Then again, maybe Potter will finally ask for a new partner. That wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.
“Sometime?” Malfoy asks, teasingly. Harry makes a face and quickly kisses him again, trying to hide his embarrassment.
“Yes, really,” Draco grumbled. “Even though you’re a prat. A prat who’s far too attractive for his own good.”
“Well, yes, but—” Potter bites his lip. It makes Draco want to sink his teeth into it as well. “We could do something that’s even better than this.”
Harry can’t believe he’s having these thoughts. Again. He kept trying to push them to the back of his mind the night before, but, apparently, it’s pointless to ignore them. It’s like his body is acting on its own, intent on getting what it craves. Harry still can’t really wrap his head around the idea that Malfoy is the object of his desire. Does he really want to go there? With him?
“How come you’re not at work at two in the afternoon on a Monday?” Draco said after clearing his throat. “Are you already on holiday? I didn’t take you for the type to take a holiday at all.”
“Clearly, you’re insane. Shouldn’t really surprise me, though. I mean, you went with Pansy Parkinson. That tells me enough about your taste. Oh, Merlin, please don’t tell me you kissed her at the end of the night?”
❤️️ At one point, I was so blocked I couldn’t write for several weeks. Then, I saw this stunning piece of art and it was like the idea I had in my head for so long had suddenly come to life. It inspired the scene in the last chapter when Draco finally goes and talks to Harry :)
“Potter, no!” Draco turns away and shields his head as the blast of the explosion whooshes over them. He peeks out from under his arms and sees Potter is already on his feet again.
And Draco couldn’t help wondering what that would be like… letting his fingers slip underneath Harry’s shirt, caressing his stomach… moving his hand to his back, sliding his fingers up and down his spine. At that point, he’d probably take off Harry’s shirt. What noises would Harry make if Draco started kissing his chest? He’d have one hand buried in Harry’s hair and move his mouth up to his neck from time to time, before slowly moving down again.
“Because I don’t think you would have opened up to me the way you did if I hadn’t accidentally turned myself into an animal. I guess it helps that I’m such an adorable creature.”
He waits, his impatience almost overpowering him. When he feels two taps against his scalp, he sighs and immediately lowers his head. Malfoy squirms and gasps as Harry alternates between kissing and sucking on his delicate skin. The hands in his hair move forward and tip Harry’s head back up. Malfoy licks into his mouth, making Harry shudder. There’s something so bittersweet in that kiss, he can barely stand it.
“He’s in the Janus Thickey Ward,” Draco says, not wanting to know what else Potter was about to ask. “He doesn’t recognise anyone. I stopped visiting him two years ago, but mother goes there every week.”
“That’s my job,” Harry protests, and Draco hides a snort in his scarf. “Aren’t we all going to get cold and wet? Isn’t the
“You’re right,” Harry says. “We’ve already had one incident where someone was accused based on nothing at all. Imagine what it’ll be like if people actually know that someone in our community is the one doing all this.”
Draco strokes his fingers through the sweat-damp hair on Harry’s forehead and gazes at him. Through the haze of his panic, Harry can see that he is trying his best to look unconcerned, but it’s easy to see the anxiety that pulls his face tight. He looks tired. His hair is flopping over his forehead and his shirt sleeves are rumpled, there are shadows under his eyes and scrawls of ink on the back of his hands. He looks wonderful, and Harry thinks his heart might not be able to take it.
Harry gives him a nervous smile. “She’s just here for moral support, really. I thought I’d feel like less of an idiot if you told me to shove it if I had her with me. Don’t worry, I’m not expecting it to make sense.”
“Fred, you brilliant bastard!” George pelts out of the gloom and tackle-hugs his brother until their respective antlers are tangled and Bill has to step in to help.
“I’m glad you like it, Dad, but I’m going to go and get changed,” she says, rising from her chair and kissing her father on the top of his head. He smells like ink and patchouli and his pale hair has been warmed by the morning sunshine. She smiles. “I love you.”
When the moon finally slides over the sun and bathes Diagon Alley in darkness, the music stops and even the reporter drops his voice to almost a whisper. Luna gazes up at it through her glasses, taking in the velvety shadow and fiery corona—the sun’s own glimmer, she supposes. At last, the reporter stops talking altogether and the perfect, silent stillness washes over Luna, calming her and grounding her to the earth.
“As I’m sure you all know by now, we have suffered two incidents of theft in the last few days. The security of our community here in Diagon Alley has been threatened, and we cannot allow it to continue.” Florean looks around, severe expression softening as he catches the eyes of Mrs Purley. “We must protect one another. I have called this meeting to hear your ideas, your thoughts, your worries. The floor is yours.”
“You’re not going to let that go, are you?” Draco sighs, stepping out into the Saturday morning crowds and holding the door open for Harry with his foot.
“It just wasn’t a good idea,” Draco says, and the ragged kindness in his voice makes Harry’s heart sore.
Harry looks at Needle and then at Draco, who is listening with an odd little smile. As they lean against the counter, their fingers brush together and neither one of them moves away. Rose turns her paper around to show a picture of a sad-faced swan and a star covered in glitter.
“What’s right with it, Harry?” Draco snaps, gesturing at the dark sky beyond the windows and the cold, uninviting room. “There’s nothing here! It’s just rain and... mothballs... and... what the hell is this, anyway?”
“Your father asked Angelina to look at the funny step because her mother is a carpenter,” Molly says irritably. “Where is that girl, anyway?”
“I see,” Draco says, but he doesn’t. He doesn’t see at all. He has no idea what to do with that information, and he has even less of an idea what to do about the churning sensation in his stomach that has nothing to do with the spicy food.
“Definitely. I fixed the draught in this lady’s stall and she gave me this,” he grins, holding up an enormous bag of liquorice. “Gotta love the way this place works.”
He asks, of course, about Potter’s campaign of madness—why he’s wearing a top hat, why he decided to walk all the way to work backwards, whether or not Brenda will be making a reappearance—but all too easily he finds himself making more prosaic inquiries about Potter’s plans for the evening, his family of Weasels, what kind of sandwich filling he actually likes best.
“You’re a leader,” Draco says, pressing his thigh against Harry’s. “When Florean retires, everyone is going to start squashing themselves into Borteg’s once a month.”
Harry hoists her up with practised ease and she smiles, twisting little fingers into his coat fabric.
Harry is ready for that confrontation now, but he knows he will have to wait and he might as well direct his frustration at something. He’d rather that something involved a nice warm room and Draco’s mouth all over his body but he does still have a job to go to, and an organised confrontation to plan.
“Is he alright?” she asks, rising and stroking Stanley’s shell. “He’s had a bit of a time, hasn’t he?”
“Long enough to know there’s nothing new on this earth,” Lee says, shuffling back towards the door. “And that this is a bloody awful song.”
“I don’t blame her,” Neville says, appearing at her side and putting an arm around her waist. “Getting married is terrifying.”
“What about secret cameras?” Jean suggests. “I’ve seen them on the television box. My son-in-law’s a Muggle, you know.”
When he’s done, and has washed up his plate for good measure, he grabs his broom, throws on his coat and heads for his favourite flying spot. Conditions are perfect and he lingers, swooping over snow-topped mountains and shivering evergreen forests until his face and hands and backside are numb, but when he returns home, exhilarated and stiff with cold, he is astonished to find that it is only half past ten. He taps the clock face in disbelief, drawing his wand and casting a diagnostic charm, but the hands refuse to budge and, according to the spell, the sodding thing is working just fine.
“No, just myself,” he admits. He fishes out the bag of sweets and hands it to her. “Remember to chew.”
Harry nods, realising that he’s holding himself so stiffly that he can hardly breathe. With some effort, he relaxes his muscles, watching Molly as she refills their cups and bustles around the kitchen just like always, as though none of this is really strange for her, and perhaps it’s not. Perhaps, after seven children and a war, there are no surprises left.
“I don’t know,” Potter shrugged, “after two Firewhiskeys you might get the chance to run your hands through my
“Master Draco,” he breathes, bowing so low, his ears flop to the ground. It takes another long moment until he’s straightened himself again.
“Headmistress,” Draco said softly. “He’s—” He glanced at Potter, his heart twisting. “He’s been having a really hard time with this.”
Malfoy huffs and slams the pillow down on the mattress. When Harry lies down beside him, he’s already turned his back to him. Harry does the same, trying very hard to move without touching any part of Malfoy. God, that would be horrible. It’s then Harry realises he’s never shared a bed with anyone before. He’s slept in a dormitory for years, but nobody has ever been
“Draco promised me we’d play after dinner,” Teddy said and continued to wolf down his peas and mashed potatoes.
“Fine, be like that,” Potter retorts. “But I don’t want to hear any complaints tomorrow. We’re here to work.”
The image of Malfoy’s slender fingers, clutching the sink in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, while tears streamed down his face, flashes into Harry’s mind, unbidden. He wishes he could obliviate himself. He wishes he never went into that bathroom in the first place.
Draco lets out a shuddering breath. As much he hates to admit it, they did it to protect him. And that, Draco slowly realises, is the difference. Because he didn’t tell Potter he was a virgin to protect him; he was protecting himself. He was being selfish. But what was he supposed to do? He couldn’t tell Potter. He would have felt too exposed.
“I really enjoyed the gala,” Potter said after a while. Draco cleared his throat and simply nodded. He refrained from pointing out that Potter had looked utterly uncomfortable the whole evening. “You never got back to me about another drink,” Potter added.
“Okay, look,” he says, sounding a little exasperated. He feels Malfoy withdraw his hand, but he quickly grabs it. “Just— You know, you can… do whatever you want.”
Draco doesn’t need another reminder of that. He watches in amusement as Potter tries to shove his hand aside.
“Oh god.” Without fully realising what he’s doing, he pulls Malfoy closer, who stumbles but quickly catches himself. Harry feels him move and gasps when he’s suddenly on the bed with Harry, straddling him. Maybe it’s a good thing Malfoy locked the door after all.
“Oh.” There was nothing else he would have been capable of saying. Slowly, he closed his eyes as Potter started sucking on a particularly sensitive spot, right behind his ear. Instinctively, his hands found their way to Potter’s back, desperately gripping his shirt.
It felt good, seeing Potter stare at him in astonishment. It took the edge off the heat that was spreading in Draco’s chest.
Draco grits his teeth at Potter’s audacity. “You’re the one who’s bleeding, you idiot,” he grumbles as he picks himself off the floor.
“So, are we going to talk about the other night?” Potter asks while stuffing his face with more goat cheese. Well, at least the picnic Draco prepared is somewhat appreciated.
There’s a moment of silence, in which Draco considers going outside and digging a hole in the pumpkin patch, so he can bury himself in it and never come out again.
“You asked for it,” Potter says and grabs his chopsticks again. The kimchi is bright red and it’s dripping onto the table.
“No, please don’t go,” Harry said in pleading tone. “He’s going to kill me,” he hissed under his breath.
Draco walks back to Potter’s side, feeling foolish. How was he supposed to know Potter’s personal matters aren’t off limits to him?
“Fuck, yes,” Potter groaned, and Draco immediately felt his rim loosen up. He wasted no time to push his tongue further in, marvelling at the sounds Potter made. “Yes, yes, yes!”
“Thank you, Professor,” Harry smiles, grateful he doesn’t have to spend another second with Malfoy. There’s only so much awkwardness a person can handle in one day.
“Well, he didn’t tell me,” Potter glowers. “He didn’t tell me until after we—” He breaks off, lowering his head.
“There’s your music,” Draco smiles, grabbing Potter’s hand once more. He’s tempted to ask if he’s really rendered him speechless, but he’s momentarily distracted by several twinkling lights that suddenly surround them.
“God, you arrogant prick,” Potter mutters. “You accuse me of having a death wish, then you go and almost get yourself killed.”
“I- Um… You know, we have been living together for a while now and- I mean, of course you know that, you were there.” Why was this so hard? He wished his mind would stop screaming at him for just a second, so he could blurt out what he so desperately wanted to say. But this voice in his head wouldn’t shut up about how he was making a fool out of himself.
He slaps his palm against the wall. Potter has no right to act like this. Potter has no right to act like Draco actually means something to him.
For a moment, the room was completely silent. Harry felt Celia’s hand twitch, but her face was unreadable. She looked shocked. Oh. They hadn’t talked about the possibility she might not want to be their child. Oh no, did she not want—
Draco huffs. “Not all teenagers are brutish Gryffindors, who get off on saving people and volunteer to sacrifice themselves and—”
His grip on the broom slackens, his entire body trembling as he drinks in Malfoy’s slender figure glistening against the sun.
As if it isn’t bad enough that he barely slept last night and is now sitting in the Great Hall where the acoustic level is the most unbearable on a Sunday morning, he had to wake up to the utmost horror he can imagine; holding Potter’s hand. He held Potter’s hand. To be fair, it was right there on Draco’s stomach. But still.
There, in the middle of his tiny room, stands Draco, only illuminated by the faint moonlight glistening through the window. Still, Harry can clearly see the swollen, purple mark on his left cheek, the cut on his bottom lip, and the angry red streaks on his neck.
Draco stared at him while his insides started to tighten painfully. It felt like he was free-falling into a black hole, which was sucking all traces of happiness out of him, leaving him empty and cold.
Still, something’s going on with him and he’s not very good at hiding it; unlike Draco. He hides his interest in the matter perfectly, concentrating on his paperwork. He only raises an eyebrow slightly when Potter returns from his lunch break on Wednesday, looking ruffled and annoyed.
He’s one of the only people Draco actually likes in here. Most of all because Nick doesn’t piss himself every time Potter enters the room. He barely ever talks to him. Draco has often wondered if Nick is jealous of Potter; he’d make a fine Head Auror as well, minus one crucial detail. He’s not Harry bloody Potter.
Draco debates snatching his hand away, but what if the prat starts whimpering again? There’s no way he can ignore that. He’ll lie awake, tempted to strangle him. To make matters worse, the tosser seems to be more relaxed now, his breathing slow and even. Draco isn’t keen on disrupting that, suspecting he won’t get a wink of sleep if he does. It’s got nothing to do with the fact that Potter’s heartbeat is now drumming against the back of his hand and Draco’s face is feeling strangely warm.
“You know, I don’t have any other plans this evening,” Malfoy says in a low voice. “So if you’d like to take me home with you…”
For once in his life, Harry heartily agreed with Malfoy. This really was ridiculous. What was Dumbledore thinking? True, things had gone a bit out of hand after the last Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin but that didn’t justify… this!
Neither of them commented on the fact that Draco could have simply levitated him to the Hospital Wing. Instead, Potter’s fingers were curled around Draco’s neck and Draco felt his whole body heat up.
So. What now? Giving up has never been Draco’s forte, but, he has to admit, there might be a few flaws in his plan he hadn’t taken into consideration; for example, tricking Potter into liking him might not be the way to go with this dimwit. He might have to be—Draco shudders—honest with him. Merlin, he can’t do that. But what if it’s the only way? Ugh. He’ll have to sleep on it.
“We all come with baggage, I guess,” he murmured. As he was gazing into Potter’s eyes, he remembered what Luna had said right before he had taken off. “We’ll have to be patient with each other.”
“Merlin, you really are dense. Not everything is about you. You couldn’t have helped me. Besides, I wouldn’t have accepted your help, even if it had killed the Dark Lord on the spot.”
“Thank you so much for reminding me. As if that wasn’t obvious enough by me being forced to spend the evening with you.”
As always, only a few days later, when Hermione walks up to him in the common room, he kind of wishes he could take that thought back.
“I didn’t know that,” Draco said, taken aback. Huh. Maybe that would explain why Potter had waltzed in here without even batting an eyelash. Draco would have thought he would be more… traumatised by the Manor. Draco still was. Sometimes. “But you were barely training to be an Auror then.”
“Forget I said anything,” Draco says with as much calmness as he can muster. “I don’t think we’ll find anything here,” he adds.
“Harry, when you first started telling me about this biddy club, I thought you were suggesting that I join it,” she says, and Harry shakes his head vehemently. “Are you asking me to have them here? At the Burrow?”
“No, but it would only be a matter of time before she stood on him with one of her great big feet, and that would be the end of it. Shall we go inside? I can’t feel my… anything,” Draco says, and Harry takes one last look at the stars, returns the beetle to his family and follows him inside.
, deciding not to dwell on the cross little exhalations that issue from the driver’s seat whenever he mentions the Northern Lights.
Harry can do that. He pushes all thoughts of letters and lies and cruel silence from his head, breathes in the cool night air and grips Draco’s hand tightly.
“One down, fifteen to go,” Draco murmurs, looking rather pleased with himself despite having spent the entire journey to the barn doing nothing but chatting away to the goat about the weather.
“Down in one, me old mateys!” George cries, and Harry obeys, wondering just where he got that eyepatch from.
“From what I remember, they’re wrong a lot,” Harry says, taking the cup and perching on the edge of a vast sofa that is upholstered in soft green-grey and draped in alpine blankets and fat cushions.
“Well, none of you have particularly quiet voices,” Marius says, and Harry isn’t sure if he wants to smile or die of shame. “Thank you for inviting me. You have a lovely home.”
Harry smiles. At the other end of the counter, Draco takes his drink and wanders over to stand beside him.
Draco mentally cheers. Phase two is also going beautifully so far. He just has to get Potter and himself a little tipsy; whatever happens next won’t be his fault then. He can always blame it on the alcohol.
Draco was glad Potter had stopped talking. He wasn’t sure if he would have been able to hear anything else over the ringing in his ears.
Draco arched an incredulous eyebrow. “For very obvious reasons, Potter. Like I said, I never thought you would like me like that, so what was the point?” It was almost physically painful to say these words out loud. His pride was begging him to stop. But if his pride was the price he had to pay to get Potter to finally see what a dickhead he was being, then so it shall be. “I finally realised how my choice would affect all the lives of the people involved, how unfair it would be. I would rob Astoria of the chance to find true happiness, with someone who truly wanted to be with her. There was a time when I thought we might come to love each other, but… that would have never happened. Because—” He balled his hands into fists, trying to stop them from shaking. Damn it! It felt like he was holding his heart in his hands, offering it to Potter, hoping he wouldn’t crush it.
With one hand on the wall and one hand outstretched in front of him, he makes his way through the castle. He hates being so slow. He can hear students chattering from afar, and suddenly, he wishes he hadn’t left the hospital wing after all. He’s still in his pyjamas and he’s blind for crying out loud. Do the other students know about that?
“Tell me about it,” Draco muttered under his breath. He grabbed his wand and extinguished the lights before he climbed into bed and lay down, stiff as a board, making sure there was no contact with Potter whatsoever. He stared at the ceiling as Potter put down his glasses on the bed table and mimicked his position. They both lay there, completely motionless, until Potter softly cleared his throat.
The news that Gryffindor won the Quidditch Cup momentarily lifted his mood, but it was pushed to the back of his mind quicker than Ginny catching the Snitch. Far more pressing things are preoccupying him. Like the fact that he seems to be unable to get Malfoy out of his head. Not that that’s anything new, but now… it’s kind of… different. Even though he can hardly believe it, he finds himself wanting to talk to Malfoy. He actually
Even though relief flooded through him, at this point, Draco really didn’t care what happened to him anymore. He had experienced what it meant to lose  nearly everything.
Firenze bends down his head, as though he’s taking a bow, and without another word, he gallops away into the Forest.
“You’re a public figure, Potter. Everybody knows where you live.” He sounds jaunty, but Harry can tell he’s trying to hide something.
“This is a one time thing, isn’t it?” Harry murmured into Draco’s hair. Lifting his head, Draco snorted once before pulling Harry into a searing kiss.
Draco experimentally loosened his grip on Potter’s waist, only to find that Potter really couldn’t stand on his own.
Harry gives him a brief nod before his eyes inadvertently wander over to Malfoy. He’s looking at Harry’s cauldron with what can only be described as indifference before he turns back to his own potion. That git. So he’s not even going to make fun of Harry anymore? Well, one less thing to worry about, then. Only, it does worry him. He can’t really explain it, but it makes him feel uneasy. He’s used to being taunted and laughed at, but no reaction whatsoever? What is he supposed to do with that?
“Mr Potter, such an honour to finally meet you. Howard Chamberlain.” He grabbed Potter’s hand with both of his and shook it enthusiastically. Potter smiled awkwardly. “I hope I’m not overstepping, but I’ve been dying to know. There have been many tales about your victory over You-Know-Who.” He leaned closer and Draco noticed he was still clutching Potter’s hand. “Is it true you defeated him with the Elder Wand? Do you still have it?”
It was suddenly brought to Draco’s attention that there was another thing that hadn’t changed one bit. Potter’s eyes were still so mesmerising, you could drown in them, forget everything around you. Draco almost did, except… there was a reason that realisation had suddenly hit him. Potter was staring right at him. Draco felt like the rug had been pulled out from under his feet. A cold shiver ran down his spine, followed by a hot flash that prompted him to subtly lay his hand on the bar for support.
He was about to surrender to the aching in his body, his insides screaming at him to lie down, when two arms circled him from behind. Harry didn’t turn around and made no sound as the arms tightened around him and a body pressed against him from behind. The exhaustion didn’t vanish, but it was momentarily replaced by shame.
“Hurry, before I change my mind.” Potter obliges but Draco immediately wishes he hadn’t. “Ew, that’s… ew!”
“I just want to know what the fuck is going on,” Draco shot back, slamming his fist down on the table.
Harry turns to Hermione, who’s sitting on the edge of the bed. Her quiet sobs fill the entire hospital wing.
“We can always enchant the plushie,” Draco winked. “And we do have another surprise for you.” He chuckled when Teddy gave him a cautious glance.
It’s got nothing to do with the case? Why are Weasley and Granger here then? What did Potter call them over for? Oh. OH! No. He wouldn’t.
Ron snorts as if he understands what Hermione just told him. Harry pokes around on his plate, not really feeling like eating at the moment.
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco said and shoved him with his elbow. He glanced at the cake and sighed. “It’s a unicorn,” he said. “Well, it’s supposed to be a unicorn.” He reached inside his pocket and pointed his wand at the cake. Before he could say the incantation, Potter grabbed his hand and lowered it.
Still, there’s something unnerving in the air. It makes the hair on the back of Harry’s neck stand up. It almost feels like someone is watching him.
“Oh no,” Teddy said, his eyes widening in horror. “You gave him back to the zoo, didn’t you? You promised me, Draco. YOU PROMISED ME!”
Draco grits his teeth, his eyes narrowed into slits. “This,” he takes a threatening step forward, “happens to be my favourite book.”
“They are on my side of the room. Have you forgotten everything I told you about boundaries?” Malfoy fumed, drawing an invisible line between their beds with his hand, as he had done on their first day as dormmates.
“Ugh! Come on! I’m going to guess it. Just wait and see! Ugh, what else is there? Is it raspberry?” One tap.
Harry blinks at him, wondering when Malfoy became so insightful. True friends. Is that what he and Malfoy have to become to break the bond? Ugh, no. He’s thinking about it again. Malfoy told him not to overthink it. Whatever the hell that’s supposed to mean. How can he not?
“Here, Baxter,” he said softly and tried to put the koala on one of the branches. “Ugh, you’re heavy.”
Just as Draco wanted to ask what the fuck he was doing here, Potter opened his mouth. He looked like he finally wanted to say something, but before he could, his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he crumpled to the ground.
Draco let out a sigh, hoping he wouldn’t regret this decision. “Alright. Meet me there on Tuesday at nine. I’ll show you around and introduce you to the others.”
“Don’t do that to me again,” Draco murmured, placing a kiss on the koala’s head. “Stay with me, okay?”
Draco tried to hide his smile as Teddy folded his hands in front of his chest and looked at Andromeda with pleading eyes.
“Severus, if you know what happened in that bathroom, you need to tell us. Otherwise we will have no way of helping them.” She sounds almost frantic. But why? What is going on? What makes all their voices quaver in fear like that?
“Why?” Mr Borteg continues. “Because both of these things require a lot of patience… a lot of care… the right ingredients… and perhaps most importantly, everything must happen at exactly the right time.”
A sensible person might imagine that Florean Fortescue would be tired of ice cream, but the huge knickerbocker glory now sitting beside him tells another story.
Just as Draco scrambles onto the shore, panting, the vast fish pokes his head from the water, opening and closing his mouth in what seems, to Harry, at least, to be a firm scolding.
“Enjoy it while you can—it won’t be long before she’ll be asking for horses and racing brooms,” Arthur says, eyes flicking to Ginny.
In the hope of getting some time alone with Draco, Harry hails the Knight Bus as early as he dares. The sun hasn’t even started to struggle above the horizon yet and the headlights of the bus illuminate glittering frost on every surface.
He shifts in the rumpled sheets so that he is lying on his side, head propped up one hand, while the other strokes slowly down Draco’s back. He is sprawled on his stomach, hair ruffled and expression utterly peaceful. He doesn’t wake when Harry touches him, even when he traces his fingertips over the pink, crescent-shaped marks that stretch across his lower back, and even when Harry lets out a soft sigh as he thinks about how they got there, hours before the sun came up. Harry fits his fingernails to the marks absently and smiles, suddenly very aware of his morning hardness, brushing the sheets and aching for attention.
“And here they all come to have a look—it’s like being at school,” Draco says, but his weary tone is completely at odds with the smile in his eyes.
“Youse’ve done a great job, laddies,” William says, buying each of them a pint of Ginger Rodent and chiding Gertie when she makes a comment about drinking at lunchtime. “Don’t fuss, eh? They’ve worked hard, helped me with my goats.”
“A butterbeer cap? Thank you,” she says, watching the soft blue glimmer around the bird darken from turquoise to cerulean.
Harry’s mouth pulls into a split-second smile. He bats the enormous snake away from his hair and then stomps over to lean on the counter beside Draco.
Draco watches him for a moment and then stalks out of the shop. That’s fine, he thinks. He doesn’t need to know anyway, and he absolutely, definitely won’t be coming back.
“Alright, alright,” George says, holding up his hands. “There was an incident and I had to hang around a bit and help.”
“Thank you, George,” Ginny says. “You lot are just jealous because these antlers look better on me.”
Feeling ashamed, he lets out a long breath. “Not just me. You’re getting the worst of this and you know it.”
“I have sacks from everyone except Flourish and Blotts, who only use crates, and Florean, who was so busy that I almost offered to put on an apron and help,” Draco says. “How about you?”
“You should,” Ron says, sitting beside Hermione as though none of this is a surprise to him, and maybe it isn’t. Harry just doesn’t know any more.
“I don’t think she sleeps,” a gruff voice answers when he shares this thought with Draco over dinner that evening.
“Good. Well, now that’s sorted, why don’t you hail the bus tomorrow when you’ve finished at the Burrow, and we’ll take it from there?”
“I’m not saying he’s a bad person… I mean, we all have a past, and I saw a lot of things that made me… you know what? You don’t need to know about those,” Harry says, reclaiming his glasses and exchanging them for the cup decorated with tiny fishes. “The point is, he’s very cranky and I’m pretty sure he’s being mysterious on purpose.”
Harry sits down and takes off his coat. “Not really. We know that none of the stallholders are involved because so many people saw them working at the times the crimes occurred… I think he was just an angry idiot with some very dodgy ideas about foreigners.”
Just before midday, Draco arrives and Rose is so delighted to see Needle that she becomes temporarily incoherent.
“You know why not. Because every single one of them has been arrogant, vain, and obsessed with Quidditch to the exclusion of everything else, including manners,” Harry hisses, and for no helpful reason that he can see, a voice in his head that sounds a lot like Draco says,
“Of course not,” Shan says with a small smile. “Anyway, we’ve all been told to keep away. That woman from MLE is down there and she doesn’t want us contaminating her scene.”
Hurriedly, he picks up his knife and fork and starts into his pie, darting anxious glances at the old woman all the way. Harry hides a smile and gulps at his beer, suddenly parched as well as ravenous. Which is a good job, as it turns out, because Gertie appears set on ensuring that neither of them have an empty glass at any point. By the time he has worked his way through all of the food on his plate, Harry is full to bursting and is feeling quite pleasantly drunk. He has no idea why Gertie is being so kind to them. Perhaps she’s insane. Perhaps she has some sort of evil plan and is lulling them both into a false sense of security. Or perhaps, he thinks, perhaps she’s insane.
Feeling rather pleased with himself, he pays for it with a handful of coins and then Apparates on the spot back to the kitchen at number twelve, half-eaten sandwich still in hand.
Potter looks up slowly, meeting his gaze. The violent new shade of his hair seems to make his eyes even greener, almost ridiculously so.
Despite the flutter of interest whenever the two of them enter a room, Harry and Draco are shunted from office to office and floor to floor, each employee that they meet informing them that they are in the wrong department entirely and that they need to go to Complaints or Personnel or the Picture Desk. Eventually, they find themselves in a stuffy basement room with a woman who looks very much like Pansy will in fifty years’ time if she doesn’t start taking care of herself.
“He must really want that apology,” Ron says. “Is he open today? I could really go for that belly pork.”
“Behave yourselves, girls, I’m serious,” he says, reaching out and scraping the fork along Luna’s copper bracelets. “The most important thing is to get people’s attention. It doesn’t matter if they think you’ve lost your marbles, just as long as they’re listening.”
“Youse’ve made my nan very happy,” he insists, smiling at them and hobbling back to his seat just seconds before Gertie emerges from the kitchen with more food than ever.
“Your mother,” Harry says, raising his voice above the chatter of the chefs. “I saw your Borteg’s bottles and I asked if you like the whiskies and she said you didn’t drink them. You didn’t drink any of them. Why would you lie to me? Why would you lie about something so weird?”
“Bloody hell,” Ron mumbles, glancing at Draco and shaking his head. “It looks a bit different when you’re…” He looks at Rose and pauses. “… tired.”
“Neither do I,” Draco says, folding his arms crossly. “But I’m pretty sure all of this—” He indicates the mess of bracken with a sweep of his hand, “Isn’t supposed to be here. If we can get rid of this, we might be able to see what else there is.”
“I’ve been shopping for pastries. I’m sorry I didn’t make them myself but these will definitely be better than anything I could produce,” Harry says.
Harry nods. Shan is his friend and he wants to at least appear empathetic, but what he knows about long term relationships is hardly worth knowing, and he has nothing to offer a couple with half a century behind them.
“Harry, this is Marius,” Hermione says, and fuck, she doesn’t look even a little bit guilty. “He’s a curse breaker.”
“I thought you got lost in the desert,” Harry mumbles, covering his embarrassment by pulling Draco down into a kiss. He smells like somewhere brand new but tastes like home. “I thought…”
“This is the place where we can come, you see,” Corrie says, reaching for the tea pot. “When we come here, we’re not alone.”
“Needle thinks my jokes are brilliant,” Draco calls after him, and he tries so hard not to smile that his face begins to ache.
No one has definitely seen Malfoy in years. He had stopped appearing in the Prophet shortly after the end of the war and has, since then, seemed to keep his business to himself. Not that Harry has a problem with that, of course. He had been happy enough at the time that his testimony had helped keep Draco and his mother out of Azkaban, and since then… well, he hasn’t really given it much thought. He has caught glimpses from time to time, of course, but he has stopped mentioning those to his friends because all they do is make fun of him.
Corrie acquiesces, still mumbling to herself, and Harry sits on the top bar of the luggage rack to watch their game. He has never seen such serious faces on the ladies, and Draco’s little frown of concentration makes him want to smile.
“Am I on the right bus?” he jokes, and all the ladies look up as though they haven’t heard him arrive.
Harry laughs, light with relief. “My scarf is brilliant,” he says, allowing himself to be tugged into Draco’s arms. “Maybe you can drink it on New Year’s Eve.”
“He’ll be alright,” Hermione says, accepting her plate with a sly smile. “He owed me a favour anyway.”
“Have you ever picked him up?” Luna asks, stirring her drink with a pink straw. “You can get on a weighing scale with him and find the difference. That’s how I weigh my cats.”
“I thought I was being friendly. I asked him about the wedding.” Draco grimaces. “I didn’t realise he and Felicity had split up.”
When she turns to Louis and questions him in slightly wobbly French, he just laughs. Ron observes him for a moment and then turns to Harry.
“Right, that’s it,” Molly says suddenly, reaching for her oven gloves. “I’m getting the chickens out before they go dry. If George wants cold dinner, that’s his choice.”
Finally, when his plate is clear and the topic of the weather has been exhausted, Draco kisses his mother on the cheek and retrieves his coat.
Luna raises her eyebrows, head suddenly filled with a vivid image of little boys ricocheting around the house.
He stares at her, fingers gripping the arms of his chair. “Oh? And I’ll owe you what horrible favour, exactly?”
“There, all paid for,” Miss Lister says. She looks at Needle, who is still sitting nicely in the corner, touching her repaired pearl bracelet with a small smile. “I’d better go. I hope you have the most wonderful wedding.”
It’s only a little deception—a kind lie, her mother would have called it—because everyone she knows really does love Ron’s food, and all have tried to persuade him to make a career of it, but when he says that their compliments are ‘biased’ and therefore ‘don’t count’, what else is there to do?
“We’re hoping some of the other shop owners will close up for long enough to see the ceremony,” Shan says, and her smile is brighter than Harry has ever seen it. “It’ll only be short and it doesn’t seem right to do it without our friends.”
“Aye, most of it,” the man says. “She’s always been stubborn. My mother’s known her since she was a bairn, ye ken, and she’s always liked to do things her way. Don’t tell her I said that, though,” he adds, eyes flicking to the bar and then back to Harry. “I’m William McIntyre.”
“It’s from a dance called Swan Lake,” Draco says, frowning and swiping his hair out of his eyes. “I thought it might be fitting.”
The thought is pushed out of his mind as he carries the requested extra chairs to the table and then finally sits down with his family to eat. Molly’s roasts are enough to make any irritating puzzles disappear, and besides, Ron and Hermione seem intent on talking about Draco.
His living room glitters and shimmers back at him. With a sigh, he turns down the carols, douses the main light and crawls onto the sofa. Closing his eyes, he breathes in the comforting scent of pine, drifting away to the soft sound of a children’s choir. He sleeps.
Sherlock after all,” Harry says, leaning against Draco and feeling his anger bubbling down into something strong and purposeful.
“I don’t know if he really meant it, but I certainly think it’s worth talking to her. I haven’t done that section of the street yet anyway.”
“Oh, aye,” William says, grinning. “Down in the cellar. It’s a regular... what do ye call it? A microbrewery!”
“That mad woman comes on Mondays as well,” Corrie interrupts, shaking her head. “Something wrong with her.”
Now inconveniently wide awake, he gazes at his rumpled bed for a second or two and then abandons it, heading downstairs with a warm robe wrapped around himself and a thick pair of woollen socks on his feet. He makes tea and drinks it slowly, peering out idly at the coloured lights on the houses nearby and resolving to retrieve his own decorations from the attic just as soon as he has time.
They walk side by side for several minutes in silence, until Harry realises that they have almost reached Grimmauld Place. He stops, wondering if he should invite Draco in for a cup of tea.
“Well, it’s not the first time I’ve been accused of that,” Lee says, shuffling his wizened form into the studio and thrusting a sheaf of parchments into Draco’s hands.
The woman clutches her necklace and stares at him, horrified. “I never even thought of that. I feel horrible.”
When he turns the corner, he stops. In a sheltered section of the garden, someone has set up Ron and Hermione’s beautiful wooden table with plates and cutlery, glasses and a basket of fresh bread that is still steaming gently. Strung up between two small trees is a selection of glowing white lights, each made from an old-fashioned light bulb and no two the same.
“We could make him little shoes,” says the dark-haired girl, picking up two little round discs from the brightly-coloured game they seem to have been playing.
“Not if no one finds out,” Draco says, and then he’s grabbing Harry by the hand and kissing him, and Harry forgets just what his next objection was going to be.
The female painter pops up inside her stall, hands already covered in smears of colour. “No, sorry. Haven’t seen him since yesterday. Hey, you’re the spider guy,” she adds, beaming at Harry. “Your little girl was awesome—it was really cool to paint something different.”
She nods, turning around to see Deb peering in the window of the ice cream parlour, where someone has left a copy of the
“That’s right,” Luna says, smiling at him and then turning her most no nonsense look on Draco. “You might not like the taste of dancing at first, but that doesn’t stop it being good for you.”
Draco jerks and comes over Harry’s fist, tightening around him and dragging his orgasm through him with such surprising intensity that his knees turn weak and he has to grip Draco’s hips to keep himself upright. For long, breathless seconds, they lean against the tiles, and then slowly fold to the shower floor, facing one another in a tangle of limbs as the hot water continues to hammer down around them.
“I can’t keep what?” he demands, eyes glittering. “Tell me, please do, because I just know that you’ve got it all worked out!”
Draco sighs, hands tightening around the wheel as though he is fighting the temptation to pull the bus into a violent swerve in the hope that Harry will slide off his chair and onto the floor. Of course, he could be over-thinking it.
“I do have a preference for the golden brown kind,” Harry admits, biting into his toastie and rushing to inhale cool air when the molten cheese burns his tongue. “Ow.”
“And would you all prefer that?” Molly asks, and there’s a tiny wobble in her voice that catches Harry somewhere painful.
He doesn’t think it’s working, and it doesn’t help that he can’t stop darting glances at Draco any more than Draco can stop looking over at him. Harry has no idea how much time has passed since they last spoke, but his hands are sweat-slippery and his nerves are jangling, and god, it feels like
“I did,” Harry agrees, fishing out the paper-wrapped millefeuille and setting it on the dashboard with a secret little flicker in the pit of his stomach.
