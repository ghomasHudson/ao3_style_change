Finally, Potter’s gaze lands on the drinks before them. He points to the small pile sat on the table. “Which one of these can I have?”
He’ll have to be happy if he doesn’t want to further upset things between them right now. Yet, he’s so tired of performing normalcy when under the surface he’s breaking apart, being pulled from all corners of his tortured mind. But he has to do it, because he can’t see himself without Potter anymore. He bites the side of his cheek before answering, a twinge of guilt sparking low in his belly. He plasters on a fond smile and nods.
, and do you know what happened? Four years later I’m singing
. Fuck, I’m coming!
“Alright there, Harry?”
Draco has withdrawn into himself again, anxiety growing to insurmountable levels. He takes to visiting only Pansy right after he finishes work in the potion’s lab. Potter is now aware that Draco’s due at New Scotland Yard in one week and believes this is the full reason for his behaviour. Potter’s tried to corner him about it many times.
Harry nods and makes his way towards the kitchen Floo, but not before ruffling Teddy’s hair and shooting a concerned, shaky smile at his husband.
A little over an hour later, all her possessions are probably neatly packed away, shrunk for transport. Harry wouldn’t know. He hasn’t moved from his spot at the table, his food still untouched.
Because the clothing Draco had worn during his assault was still in the possession of the Aurors, the Trainee Healer provided him with a standard black hospital-issued jumper, trainers, and joggers with the St Mungo’s emblem embossed on the front of the jumper. It’s scratchy and the material is too thin, but he’s grateful nonetheless. Once fully dressed, he gingerly sits on the edge of the bed, his movements slow from the potions and the dull tingle of remnant pain. He’ll be needing another dose soon, he realises. Before he can decide whether to sprawl out on the bed or not, the Trainee Healer bustles into the room, her lime green robes slightly wrinkled and her expression agitated. She shoves a medium-sized simple, wooden box with a small latch on the front containing thirty-six neatly labelled vials under Draco’s nose. He takes it gingerly.
is the guy who’s stolen you away from us, Draco?” And Draco would smile and coyly nod his head. It made Harry’s heart pound against his ribs with excitement. It made him think that
“It’s been seven months. He’d want his daddies to be happy. So, come on, Harry,” Draco says softly, gently squeezing his hand.
before, especially in someone else’s hands. But Harry...
Draco smiles. “No. You’re sweet, thank you.” Mia smiles back and tips an extra finger of liquor in Draco’s glass before waving her wand over the bottle to replace it on the shelf.
“You haven’t had a bite of your curry yet, so your mouth on my dick will work out just fine,” Harry says.
It’s then that Draco notices the gold band on Harry’s left hand.
Potter nods. “Yeah. I reckon you do, so let’s crack on, shall we?”
. He’s

“Yes, that’s all very true, Harry, but still. You
“Here we are,” Draco says, his hand tightening nervously around the handle of his briefcase.
“Stop it,” Harry intones, his voice flat.
“Oh. Devastatingly handsome, twice our age, filthy rich. You know, your basic nightmare,” Ginny said, heading back towards the curtained fitting room.
“Speaking of ridiculous, how about that neighbour of yours, with the pomeranian?” Harry tuts.
“Do you want to be the little spoon or the big spoon?” Harry asks playfully.
you—”
“How about I help you clean up this mess and you crack open that bottle of firewhisky from the 1800s I know you keep in the study?”
Ginny claps and then shoots up from her seat, pulling out her wand. With a flourish, she transfigures one of Harry’s throws into a rainbow-coloured feather boa, sauntering over to him to wrap it around his neck as she sings off-tune, “

Flushed and slightly drunk off the pleasure, Draco pushes up to his elbows to glare at Potter. “Potter, if you don’t get back down there—”

“What the hell is this, Malfoy?”
“You smoke it,” Luna answers. Everyone turns to her in surprise. “What? I spent a lot of time in Muggle communes during my travels. Marijuana allows you to see Heliopaths.”
“You know
---------
Draco mentally swears, his hands stuttering to a stop above the keyboard.
It’s storming outside, but it’s also storming inside Grimmauld Place. All over the floors are shattered pieces of vases, pictures, plates, torn tapestries and ripped books. He’s so engrossed in ripping a small painting Dean gifted him last Christmas in half that he doesn’t hear the heavy knocking at the door in between his shouts, grunts of anger, and the claps of thunder. When it finally dawns on him that someone is
“You’re not even
It’s a funny thing, time.
His gaze once again falls on Bitty, thoughts of their first time together coming to mind, that same dark curl of forbidden yearning ensnaring him in her sweet clutches pulling him in now. He’s in front of her in seconds and watches in awe as her deft fingers begin to make quick work of unbuttoning his shirt. Her pupils are blown as she runs her hands up his chest and over his shoulders, pushing the thin material off to land on the floor. When her hand grazes the buckle of his belt, Blaise is back, tugging her hands away to spin her back towards him, his lips descending onto hers, heated and possessive.
“I’m okay. It’s just, I’m still trying to process it all,” he says hoarsely.
“That’s not true, Harry.”
“Me too,” Pansy says, now standing from the floor, sniffling. “I don’t give a fuck about the repercussions.”
This fucking piece of shit

“I just don’t want you to be by yourself. Your flatmates and friends are all on the opposite side of that door.”
“Goddamn it, Malfoy,” Potter hisses.
as he eats. He doesn’t think about the letter when he’s back in his lab, meticulously slicing up a bat’s spleen. He doesn’t even think about it when he’s back in the sitting room, shuffling through the rest of the post.
, which was an astonishing feat for the usually vocal man. Harry will never forget the tears that poured down Draco’s face at the end of the film.
He feels so fucking helpless that all he can do is toss the book aside and bury his head into his hands with a sob.
“I have a feeling that’ll change,” she says with a warm smile before extending her hand. “Hello, my name is Mia Burke. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Don’t be silly, darling. There’s no need to hide how big of a fan you are of João’s.”
him, to think back on their last exchange and feel bad for not doing more, for not saying more, for not reaching across whatever line divided them and linking their fingers together: them against the world. He spends too much time than reasonable at night, still high from a shared spliff with Pansy or Blaise, thinking about it. Right before sleep conquers him, Draco wishes that he would have kissed Potter before saying goodbye for good.
Harry’s hand is a gentle yet firm reminder of what
Harry pauses, biting his lower lip before he clasps Draco’s hand.
Theo shrugs. “You’ve told us where he lives already. And I’ve personally been to the Black estate when we were kids. I can get us in.”
He’s on his way to the loo when he hears a scuffle in front of him. The penthouse hallways are long, a bit twisty, and wide. When he recognises Ginny hissing, “What do you want?” he stops in his tracks, peering around a corner to see Pansy and Ginny standing together.
Draco looks like a fallen angel accepting his fate with a resigned gracefulness as soft, shuddering huffs escape his lips. As he shuts the door behind him, he feels sick to his stomach. He hates that his mind has wandered to such thoughts when Draco is obviously hurting. He tries to reel his focus back to the very real, very troubling matter at hand: Draco’s pain.
” She spits out the last word as if it left a nasty taste in her mouth. She leans forward, staring directly into his eyes.
“Just wrapping up,” Harry says, moving from off the bed. “You want to sleep in the bed or the fort, love?”
“Oh, Wanda Warlock! I
“And?” Draco replies coolly as he pumps soap onto his palms and lathers up. Draco peers back up at the mirror.
“She would have wanted justice.”
As he pulls away, he catches the
“Are you okay?”
It’s then that Potter shoves Draco’s cloak into his chest, holding it there against him even as Draco’s hands fly up to clutch the fabric.
“Did you say this film is scary?” Draco whispers, taking another swig from the can. Harry shakes himself a bit and clears his suddenly dry throat.
Draco blinks slowly. He’s sure she spends most of her time watching
“You’re coming to Mia’s party tomorrow, right?” Pansy asks, for the millionth time.
“But afterwards, if you’re free later, I would like to take you out to dinner. Do you, er—do you reckon you’ll be free?” Harry asks.
Draco ignores him. At his accusation, a blaze of fiery incredulity flashes in Granger’s bloodshot eyes before it’s snuffed out as the eerie, vacant look clouds over her gaze once more.
“I know you do.” He clears his throat and tries desperately not to sound too affected by Pansy’s blatant display of emotion. The conversation has worn him out and he needs to be alone right now. “I believe I’ve overstayed my visit, Pansy. Thank you for your hospitality,” he says with a carefully controlled look of polite indifference. He makes his way towards the Floo, feeling worse than he did before arriving to come see her. Pansy gracefully stands and follows him.
“Fine, fine. Of course, they should be invited.”
____________________
He finally steps out into a wide, long hallway, his eyes bulging at the enormity of it. There are paintings of landscapes and beautiful still-lifes lining the walls before the hallway opens up to a mammoth of a sitting room. One entire wall is made up of nothing but windows, the city of London on display in its lit and inky black glory.
Harry’s head rolls against the wall to stare at Draco, his vivid eyes severe as his hand goes to Draco’s knee. He squeezes.
“Why did you do this? This was
Draco runs a hand through his hair. “I’ve only been with two people my entire life. I just, I don’t want to fuck just anybody,”

“Keep your paws off my receptionist,” Draco says, unbuttoning his white doctor’s coat. They’re alone now in an empty corridor heading towards the lifts.
Draco had been expecting a middle-aged man with tweed trousers and an oversized jumper. Not someone his own age and certainly not someone he knows. He hasn’t seen Thomas since Christmas at the Burrow. It was now mid-July.
Draco pushes himself off the wall. “I have to—” he trails off, his body feeling unsteady, lost in the blaze of Harry’s eyes. “I have to leave now. Standing here hurts, looking at you fucking
Harry sits up then, pressing his palms to his eyes, drawing in a deep breath. “I would
Draco suddenly recalls what Potter rambled on about last night. King’s Cross Station in his afterlife. Draco thinks about the place he went to when he had arrested and flatlined. How beautiful the Malfoy gardens were, how pristine the Manor looked in the bright summer daylight. He had walked around for what felt like hours, stopping to peek into the flourishing greenhouse that held some of Mother’s prized orchids. He watched the small pond and the baby ducks that flitted across the water. He ran past several beautiful, but temperamental white peacocks. And finally, he came upon the swing his Mother helped him hang on a tree branch when he was five years old. Draco knew that his Father had it removed when he turned eleven, claiming that he was too old for it. But here, in this beautiful afterlife where the Manor was untouched from the perils of war and the garden in bloom and sweet smelling, Draco had seen his swing.
“And. I want to tell you that I’m not interested in causing you any grief here, Malfoy. We…we’re probably going to cross paths a lot as the Auror Team Leaders work with the Chief Prosecutor’s team throughout our prominent cases. And perhaps for the betterment of our future time together, maybe you’d be interested in a, you know, truce?” Potter babbles, suddenly standing and offering his hand.
It disgusted him so much, the notions of love and death, that he committed heinous murders to split his soul into tiny pieces just to avoid it. And still, the embodiment of love prevailed—you won despite carrying a piece of that repulsion within you. And so I rationalise, to love and to be loved
“No!” Harry says petulantly.
“And sometimes in Scandinavian forests,” Rolf supplemented.
, this is all too much for him to swallow.
As Harry chuckles, albeit quietly, he realises that he can get used to being around Malfoy like this.
couch drinking
“I can see why he’d be afraid of feeling that way, Harry. If you made him feel unsafe and unsure after such an intimate encounter, it makes sense if he regrets ever allowing you in in the first place.” Harry hangs his head. Hermione scoots closer to him, picking up his hand from his lap to hold. “But I know Draco cares so much about you. Just give it time, Harry. Your connection with him is stronger than you think.”
Harry completely forgot that they were all gathering to plan Pansy’s birthday party. “You’re right.”
“Come here often?” Draco asks once they step inside. Potter shrugs, his lips turned up in a happy smile.
“Fuck you, and fuck your threats,” Draco wheezes out.
“I know what’s in that box. I know what you’re about to ask me, but there are some things I have to tell you first.”
He can literally feel his face heating up, and not just from his blunder, but for the very real fact that Malfoy is about to sneer and spit some vitriolic rubbish his way. He braces himself for it as the other man jerks back, his arms coming away from his chest to fall to his sides in tightly balled hands as he gives Harry a searching look. Whatever Malfoy finds on his face must be agreeable because he offers a small nod, face wary.
“I know it hasn’t been that long, but Draco, there’s something special happening here, and I want it to happen. I’ll admit, it took me by surprise, but I’ve welcomed it with open arms. I want to know all of you. Please let me.”
“This music box is Dark. Did you know?”
Draco is as still as a stone, the expression on his pale face blank—withdrawn. Harry knows better, though. He knows that underneath that outward stoniness, Draco’s heart is breaking into a million little pieces.
Still, now that he has it, the responsibility of said scroll rests heavily on his conscience, even when Monday rolls around. He’s surprised to find himself packing away the damned thing in his briefcase, his subconscious obviously clearing up his indecisiveness.
Hermione is standing before the window overlooking the Weasley’s garden. The mid-afternoon light pouring into the room catches on the flower-shaped diamond-studded clips pinning her curly, coarse hair up into an elaborate chignon. He finally shuts the door and slowly walks up to her. When Hermione turns away from the window to fully face him, he gasps.
he thinks to himself. He curses the sudden rush of comprehension flooding over him. It hits him so hard that he does indeed start to cry – slow, harsh choked sounds that hurt his stomach as they travel up his throat.
As they head out the front door, Theo again hands Draco his handkerchief to wipe away their handprints on the doorknob. Draco turns around once more—dog under his arm, nose slightly runny from the copious amount of drugs, and a deep-seated satisfaction unfurling in his chest. He uses the handkerchief to undo Sprinkles’ collar.
Potter lifts a hand to place on Draco’s knee but pulls back just as his ghostly fingers attempt to curl around his kneecap. “I don’t know. But I promise I won’t hurt you.”
The flutters erupt in Draco’s stomach, his head falling back against the pillows as Harry scoots his body down Draco’s, his lips pressing against Draco’s clavicle, down his sternum, over his taut stomach, his belly button and the line of hair there leading to his cock. Draco bends his legs, feet planted on the bed. When Harry’s on his stomach between Draco’s legs, he tucks his nose against Draco, his lips pressed against Draco’s hard, leaking cock, drawing in deep breaths as he groans, deeply.
Draco lifts his right foot and gives it a little shake, the tassel shifting wildly on the top of the shoe, much to Potter’s amusement.
“Oh, you bloody fool,” Draco interjects.
Despite his very real fear, Harry’s desire to help Draco outweighs it. He nods.
Pansy crosses her arms against her chest and sticks up her nose. “Fine. Draco, give me one of your shots.”
“Draco,” says Hermione. She comes into the room, a tray of mixed drinks and a bottle in her hands, Potter following behind her with an expression on his face that wouldn’t be out of place on someone attending a funeral. She’s also dressed in a peach-coloured dress, though hers is a simple Bardot dress that ends right above her knees. It brings out the cool rosy undertones of her tawny-brown skin, her own wild curls shaped like a cloud around her head. Her warm smile fades as she takes in Draco’s exhausted face. “Oh dear, Harry was just telling me about your rough week,” she says, sitting the tray on the low coffee table and coming up to him. Draco glances over at Potter, surprised they both came up with the same excuse. “For what it’s worth, thank you for showing up.”
“She’s only eight months, ‘Mione. Teddy is a toddler,” Weasley mumbles, not taking his eyes off the board. Hermione huffs.
“Was it Gedeon? Did he say something to you to make you resign? Does it have to do with Potter’s death? Just tell me what you know,” Draco rushes out.
“Er, a month. He wasn’t, er, he wasn’t really my type either,” Harry mutters.
Harry stops in his tracks, looking confused. “Is it because of your - your panic attack? We should talk about it.”
“I wanted you to know. He’s not doing well without you.”
Harry really was going to order the lobster and crab burger, but he refuses to give Malfoy the satisfaction of knowing he’s right. “Do you regularly talk to wait staff in such a rude way?”
It did little to quell his anxiety or the crippling shame he felt. “I couldn’t,” he starts, closing his eyes and swallowing. “I couldn’t reach my wand, he…he had me pinned against a wall.”
When Gedeon realises that Draco is watching him, with a snarl he pushes himself up with his arms, panting heavily as he glares at Draco.
Jenkins’ grip on Draco tightens, and he drags Draco backwards towards the burning Veil, the Fiendfyre swirling within it, the heads of snakes, chimeras, eagles, and dragons coming to the surface of the Veil to hiss, howl, and roar. Draco struggles against him, desperately digging his heels of his shoes in and trying to become dead weight against Jenkins.
“You’re wrong,” Draco says with a dramatic, chastising shake of his head.
“I make my intentions clear before I fuck anyone, Draco. Having sex requires a conversation, a continuous one, especially during. They know what I’m about.” Harry runs a hand through his hair. “I don’t expect you to understand, you have your own set way of navigating the dating scene and sex. You’re entitled to your opinions.” Draco takes a long sip from his drink.
The increased heavy weight Draco’s been carrying in the centre of his chest since the weekend eases a bit. He’s shocked to realise just how much he
I’ll allow you to cuddle me.” But even as Draco rolls his eyes theatrically and releases a put-upon sigh, he scoots a bit closer to Harry. Harry laughs.
, I wish you both a long and healthy relationship.”
. I know it is. Just please,
, Harry. How did that even happen?” Sometimes Ginny really reminds him of Ron. At the thought of his boyfriend he smiles.  With a blush he launches into the whole story – the nightclub, the alcohol, the snogging, Pansy Parkinson, Dean standing on his doorstep, wanting him—as they make their way through their appetiser.
Draco feels himself sinking into a pit of pain-free darkness as the ground beneath his feet collapses. He gasps.
“What are we going to do?” he asks against her shoulder. She pulls away slightly and cards a hand through his wild hair. Her face is red and her nose is runny; the sight makes his heart ache even more. He hates seeing her like this.
“Miss Cissy is being need anything else?” Kreacher asks, in yet another bow.
Harry finds his voice. “Draco…”
“Hmmm, I haven’t yet, Potter,” Draco says, leaning in to press a soft, chaste kiss to his husband’s lips. “Okay. Let’s go get the baddies.”
He doesn’t know what possessed him to do it at first, whether it was guilt or regret or what some people have accused him of, his saviour-complex, that prompted Harry to help someone like Draco Malfoy. But he hadn’t questioned it further, and had helped him sober up. They became close friends almost immediately, Draco opening himself up to Harry first out of necessity to get off the streets, then slowly, because of so much more than they were ready to address.
His blood pumps vermilion,
“Let me sleep, Potter,” Draco says dismissively, flopping back against the pillows, burying under the duvet again. Potter doesn’t move. Draco drifts off to sleep.
“Come here,” Draco suddenly mutters, tugging him close to gently kiss him in front of all the pearl-clutching daycare mums. When they separate, Teddy is beaming up at them and more than a few parents are looking their way. “Love you,” Draco whispers with a wink.
Pansy grumbles as she rummages through the bag for the other sandwich. “You’ve always been incapable of leaving Potter alone. Now you both practically work together.”
Draco hangs his head, his face lips tightening into a scowl. “I told her that’s a bad idea.”
“Oh. Draco...” Padma starts, her free hand flying to rest at the base of her throat.
“He was
Hermione scowls and is suddenly on her feet as well, her expression growing dark. “Are

“Glad to be of service,” Harry says affectionately before spinning Draco. He knows how important this decision was for Draco. He had vowed never to return to the Wizarding World, and now he was in the centre of Diagon Alley, quite literally surrounded by the media and people who would have spit in his face if they caught him strolling the streets during the day. Merlin, Draco was braver than he gives himself credit for.
“You look like shit,” Draco's brain offers up, even as his heart aches.
“Fat chance of that. We’re bloody Aurors, Draco.”
“Harry,” Draco croaks out. “That poem—”

“Thanks Richard, you’re a gem. Oh, you’ve got a little something there,” Harry starts, leaning forward to pluck a piece of lint from Richard’s hair. Draco comes through the double doors that lead to the nurse’s station and examination rooms.
Draco lowers his sandwich and catches Pansy’s eye, offering a small commiserating smile. “It’ll get better.”

Draco laughs, careless, winded. “You can have all of them for all I care. May you please answer my question?”
Harry shakes his head in disbelief, the humour draining from his face as he slips his hand from Draco’s to draw his knees up to his chest, wrapping his arms around them. “You’ll have to give her back, you know?”

Draco’s grateful that Harry never visits in these shadows. No. Never shadows. He’s on the outside making sure people don’t come and murder Draco in his sleep. Harry is the dart of sunlight that kisses his face as he moves through the corridor. Never the dark.
Potter shows no sign of acknowledging what Draco’s said, or having even heard him. “You really didn’t open the scroll?” Potter asks, now reaching up to the gilded handle poking out from his holster. He pulls free his knife to carefully slide under the seal, breaking it. He replaces his knife and then pulls free his wand to trace over the scroll, muttering incoherently under his breath. “You didn’t open it.”
Smith pulls his cock out before turning away to step up to the urinal. With a disgusted curl of Draco’s lip, he drops his gaze from Smith’s to flick the faucet on and run his hands under the water.
Draco starts to feel uneasy, and it must show on his face because Harry blanches.
“Thank you. It was a

A tap at their kitchen window has everyone turning towards the sound. When Pansy and Blaise turn back to their plates, Draco sighs exasperatedly and gets to his feet to throw the window open. The tiny, fidgety owl swoops into the kitchen, slamming against their fridge before skidding across their kitchen table, knocking over a bottle of sriracha sauce and the salt shaker.

“Oh, sorry, this’ll just be a mo’,” Neville says, pulling out his wand and tapping on the case three times. It opens with the slowness of a music box, revealing a neat row of what looks like hand-rolled cigarettes to Draco. “Added the charm for extra protection,” Neville explains. “I reckon every couple gets a spliff?”
"Please, don’t hurt me again...because I
Harry cranes his neck to look over the tight rows of shelves holding colourful Muggle packages. “I was wondering if your Mr Slush machine is working?”
something from me,” Potter says, that eerie echo back in his voice. He shudders and continues to sob.
Draco freezes, as does Bitty.
“Are you having a funny turn?”
He freezes in shock. But when Draco’s tongue slides against his bottom lip asking for entrance, he obeys and the kiss deepens. And
“So, you’re blaming
“You don’t owe me anything,” Potter starts softly. “I would do it all again. Look at you, look at the man you’ve become.” Potter smiles at him. “I’m happy to be sitting here with you right now, meeting you all over again.”
They never had any problems discussing this with him before, but for the last week Teddy has spurned Draco whenever he broached the topic of wearing his regular clothes.
disrespect of this Ministry!” Member Gresham shoots back, several other members nod along.
Draco was provided the chance to start over for good this time. He’s going to take advantage of this rare third opportunity to continue to figure out who he is and what he wants, all while having someone who loves him and encourages him by his side.

, today I must’ve left it—”
Draco smiles faintly at her with an inward sigh of relief. He opens his arms, and Pansy falls into them. He holds her tightly.
“And I was tired. I was so bloody tired of feeling like I wasn’t alive, barely existing as I listlessly made my way through an unfeeling, stagnant world. I'm aware of my privilege and what it's afforded me in life, but I resent it every single day. All the parties, the polite conversations, the lies and the boredom— it was soul crushing. So I admit that I started the break-ins as a means to embarrass some of your families, but it quickly turned into a matter of life or death. See, while you all were hoarding your Dark artefacts and still promoting Blood Purity behind closed doors and during your weekly luncheons, you made it okay for evil to fester once more. You were silent and complacent as people, children even, were murdered once again in the name of power and Blood Purity. You gave this evil your time, your energy, and your money.”
talked about in the Pureblood circle. It was scandalous and exciting. Exotic and controversial. It put the Davis family on the map for the preying upper echelons of society.
now the rising star, the one keeping these streets safe. If I have to falsify records, alter the memories of witnesses, or beat the living shite out of scum, I’ll fucking do it, and Harry will be right there, signing off on those records, documenting those altered memories in a Pensieve, and leaning on the Ministry officials I need him to in order to prevent charges from being brought against me. And if I take it too far and break a suspect’s jaw, well, Harry’s going to say he fucking did it and I tried to stop him. And you know why? Because he’s a coward. Because
immortality; to die for it, the ultimate sacrifice. It’s ritualistic and strong, stronger than the act of murdering someone to preserve a shard of one’s soul, Mr Potter. So, I ask again: what would you do for love? Would you die for it?”

When Draco reaches Potter’s office, the first thing he notices is how tidy and organised it is.
. With so many young people having fought in the war, witnessing all of the destruction, rebuilding Diagon Alley to reflect the needs of their ushering-in generation of Magical people must’ve been a necessity.
Draco downs the rest of his wine. The bubble that they had cocooned themselves in upon sitting at the table finally pops as Draco gets to his feet, digging into the back pocket of his trousers to pull out his wallet to throw money on the table. The sound of the restaurant rushes over Harry, and he watches in horror as Draco walks away from him.
“No, not that, either,” Harry says with a dramatic sigh.
He gasps. Everything in his lounge room has been ransacked— the upholstery torn, books pulled down from its shelves, tables and chairs overturned. The smell of cigarette smoke and something else, a sharp, spicy scent his muddled brain can’t quite place, permeates the air. Panicked and trembling, Draco stumbles from the lounge room down the hall, wand at the ready. The pictures on the walls are askew and the furniture also overturned.
“Not everything is black and white in the field of science...or life,” Granger says as she shows him the Veil. “You’ll come to appreciate the need to leave your emotions at the door so you can tackle the kind of work we’re going to do here.” Granger smirks at him. “But you know all about that, don’t you?”
“Come’ere, come’ere,” he mumbles softly, his hands rubbing up and down the length of Draco’s back before holding him closer. Harry can feel the flutter of Draco’s heartbeat against his chest. “It’s all going to work out, you’ll see. You’ll be okay, I promise.” Harry kisses Draco’s cheek.
Auror partner; it was some American that transferred in from MACUSA temporarily to work on a special project. It was such a difficult time for my girl, honestly,” Blaise says, now fiddling with their Floo. The relief that slams into Draco makes his knees shake, but he holds himself still as Pansy continues to stare at him in that hawk-eyed assessing way of hers.
Pansy giggles. “Merlin, why purple?” Her head slides from Draco’s shoulder to land onto the back of the sofa as she draws in more of the spliff. She blows the smoke out towards the ceiling. “You don’t have to prove anything to anyone. Especially not to a bunch of Gryffindor cunts. I can’t believe what that Leprechaun-looking bastard Finnegan did to you.”
“I wonder how they keep it on the property?” Millie muses, her hand scratching the back of its ears.
“Don’t pretend you’re not just as nosy about me,” Draco says, quirking an eyebrow.
Milton crouches down beside him.
“Last night when I left the pub I was attacked by a Muggle and he raped me,” he admits in one rushed, ragged breath, cringing over the filthy word. Pansy gasps, her hands stilling against his back. Draco pulls away from her. Her mouth opens and closes before she swallows, her eyes wide with shock. She reaches out to pull him to her again and he lets her. He can tell she wants to throw a million questions his way, but he’s happy she keeps them to herself for now. “I Apparated to St Mungo’s and—” A lump forms in his throat to cut him off and instead he takes a deep breath, the words he wants to say a jumble in his own head. The kettle hisses and he disentangles himself to stand. Her arms fall limply to her side. He faces the cooker, shaking hands blindly reaching out to turn the electric hob off and place the kettle to the side. It’s a blissful momentary distraction from the look of abject horror on Pansy’s face. He  prepares two cups of tea with Earl Grey, having no idea where his Prince of Wales is. He’s calming down through the monotonous act of preparing the tea. “It wasn’t that bad,” he says thickly. “It could have been a lot worse.”
Both Pansy and Blaise freeze, eyes wide.
“You’ve always been such a mummy’s boy, you weak bastard. Both you and Blaise, mummy’s boys. You were quite the pair at Hogwarts. Always sharing your women, my poor wife, one of them.” He sighs. “The Agnelli’s are funding our venture, Draco! Though, they’re not as rich as they pretend to be,” Marcus mocks. “They have to skim money from all the charity events that run through St Mungo’s, a position
“Harry?” Draco asks, holding his own glass out to him. He takes it and sips from it.
Then squeezes tight. Faster.
He shoves Harry away from him, panting.
“You just don’t want to have this conversation because you can’t be honest with me! We both know what this is about, Draco. You’re scared of what people will think, just admit it!”
Draco waits patiently, his leg bouncing from nerves; he has to cross his legs at the knees to stop the impulsive movement. A few more minutes pass, and he checks his watch, wondering if Harry can’t find him in the thick mass of bodies. He’s considering heading back into the pub when Harry strides towards him, slipping smoothly through the Repellent charm, a bottle of Firewhiskey and two glasses in hand.
All Draco had was time and an abundance of memories.
“You’re fine,” Draco says weakly before taking a few more closer, smaller sips. He runs a hand through his hair, trying to take strong, even breaths to prepare himself for it.
Bitty rushes up to him then, throwing her arms around his neck as she rests her head against his chest.
Draco can see the swelling ache of longing in Harry’s eyes, the subtle expansion of his pupils, the taut, rigid strain of his body even as his slow, ragged breaths catch in his chest. Draco’s overwhelmed by the intense yearning that sweeps over him as they hold each other’s gazes.
Draco makes his decision after a quick, furious wank in the loo after his lunch with Blaise and Bitty. The whole time he was pulling off he kept calling himself
If the Healers here were literally using human flesh and blood to somehow recreate or understand the links between DNA and inherent Dark Magic, who knows what kind of torture and body modification they’re causing their subjects.
“Will Thea be okay?” Maggie asks, looking up at him with a solemn expression.
“Merlin, I’m a fucking idiot!” he cries.
Master, such an
Jeremy’s eyes bulge, his hands shake uncontrollably, to the point that he drops the knife. He stumbles away from Draco and opens his mouth to scream, but what instead comes out is a black tendril of smoke, reaching out towards the ceiling to spread out like an insidious bacterial growth, clinging to the walls, a rancid smell like rotting meat permeating the air. Jeremy shakes and moans, head tilted back and arms spread wide as he stares, wide-eyed, at the ceiling. The room darkens, and Draco shivers, feeling cold and weak. There’s a roaring scream in his ears, and every single miserable thought Draco’s ever had begins to bubble to the front of his mind. He whimpers as images of his mother, blood shining bright on his hands, her beautiful blue eyes wide and unseeing, flash across his mind’s eye.
“No, no! I promise it’ll be open. C’mon, it’ll be a fun, quick little adventure.” Harry begins to stretch, shaking up Draco’s comfortable position in his lap.
Draco laughs at that. The
“Narcissa, you don’t need to be,” Harry says consolingly. "You saved my life."
Later that night, after they make love, Harry cradles Draco’s head in his lap while Draco massages the hand that Harry’s broken, twice now. Even though it’s healed fully, sometimes a dull ache will radiate from his palm to the tips of his fingers. Draco made it his personal mission to work the kinks out of Harry’s hand every night.

“Thank you, Adanya, you’re much too kind,” Pansy says, her gaze lifting to Dany’s as her lashes flutter. “I’ve been meaning to tell you about my upcoming exhibition of some rather lovely abstract screen prints I just know you’ll love…”
All this. To observe Potter’s death. To mourn him. Remember him. Pray for him.
. And I’ve been patient, haven’t I? Don’t tell me you haven’t been in agony, too,” Harry says, his voice crisp and clear, unwavering despite his tired, hooded eyes and sallow skin; his chapped lips part. “I miss you, and I love you, and I’m sorry,” Harry says, his voice loud over the cacophony of music and the laughter from good-natured people trying to enjoy their Friday night out.
Harry says, pulling back to search Draco’s face. “I’ve missed you. Spending the last 24-hours not being able to

“You know, Ron and I…Molly and Arthur…Neville...Seamus...Do I
“No, thank you,” Draco says with a dismissive wave of his hand.
“He didn’t mean it like that. You know he loves you. He could never hate you,” Harry whispers.
“I want my fucking curry!” Draco snaps. “You can wait out here while I order if you can’t pull yourself together and be an adult for once in your fucking life.”
“You know as well as I do that I’m incapable of leaving you alone, Draco.”

Harry hums. “You look it all.” Harry presses his lips against Draco’s ear, his cock sliding against Draco’s hip.

Draco’s leads to the bed, Harry encouraging him to sit on the edge. Draco does, a small smile gracing his lips as Harry kneels down in front of him to begin unlacing Draco’s shoes.
about you,” he says, ticking down one finger. “Two, you have a reputation that precedes you; three, you’re an absolute arrogant arse; four, you’ve just tried to come onto me; and five, I have a loving and gorgeous boyfriend. Simply put, I’m not interested in anything you have to offer,” he says snidely, withdrawing his hand.
He suddenly spots Goldstein coming from the breakroom, as usual, but this time with Astoria Greengrass at his side. Draco doesn’t miss the brief locking of their pinkies before pausing under the sterilising vent, Astoria looks up and smiles sadly at Draco.
“I went into Diagon Alley to purchase a Kneazle. Without magic, I’m left quite vulnerable so a Kneazle would be an asset to the wards at the Manor and to myself.”
to miss me,” Harry says numbly.
“Stop it, Blaise! Don’t make this about us. Don’t use Draco as an excuse to pull us apart even more.”
James is silent. Harry steps back, the weight of his step causes a loose floor panel to creak and James whips around in his swivel chair, their gazes locking. Brown to green. Without looking back at his laptop, his hands scramble to close it, promptly ending his conversation with Teddy. Harry bows his head and steps into the room.
Draco’s laugh is abrupt, and he stifles it, feeling fond. He flexes his hand again and Harry finally takes it. Draco turns it over, runs his thumb over the nearest bruised, battered knuckle. He brings Harry’s hand to his lips and kisses it. “I could never be afraid of you. I’m just sorry I was ready to believe the worst...believe that you could— with someone like
Padma hesitates only a second before she reaches out, like earlier, to brush back Draco’s fringe from his forehead.
Harry had flushed, images of doing just that popping up in his head. “You wanker. You don’t mean that. You don’t mean that at all.”

But all that aside, even Hermione was impressed with his Walburga makeover, particularly the glitter portion of the transfiguration, and of course his sentimental –
“You should obviously be at home so the Weasel can look over you and the bump. You look like shite.”
It’s rehearsed and sounds hollow to his own ears. Parroting something he heard Hermione spout to Rose was better than nothing, though. Even if Rose is only five. James is fifteen, and so mature for his age. He was their first, their surprise. Despite the brown hair and eyes, he looks so much like a young Lucius, more than Draco, that Harry had irrationally worried if it would make him love him less. He had been stupid.
“Why can’t I just talk to you about it when I’m ready? Trust and all.”
belong together. Don’t let petty outside forces send your love for him up in flames.” Pansy sniffs, her posture straightening, scrambling to her feet. “I’m going to get you a glass of water and a vial of Draught of Peace, I’ll be right back.”
Bitty’s lips curl upward. As they part, no doubt with something cutting, she’s interrupted.
“Sorry, Hermione, you were saying?” Harry asks.
“I don’t want to be a burden,” he whispers, surprised by his own honesty. His eyelids feel heavy.

When she gets a proper look at him, she becomes pale, a look of concern crossing her face. “You look like utter shite,” she says in surprise. His knows there’s probably bags under red-rimmed eyes and an ugly flush to his skin. He doesn’t care.
Draco shuffles through the papers, coming across medical records for each person, and now his stomach lurches. Each person listed as missing is noted in the notes from Granger to have participated in a “group rehabilitation program” at the Ministry of Magic's Department of Mysteries.
Linda smiles and walks away.
“I said we can go!” Draco snaps, slamming shut the wardrobe doors. “I want to take a bath first, so why don’t you go get dressed, preferably
And then Potter’s eyes narrow as they land on Milton, his frown sliding into a sneer.
his eyes suddenly feel very wet. He blinks furiously.
Draco considers approaching them, but decides against it. There’s no need to have his night spoiled this early in the event by verbally sparring with Potter, Lovegood’s dress providing Draco wonderful working material to get the other man's blood boiling. Instead, he makes his way to the ground floor where the quieter loos and kitchens are. This far down, the corridors are a bit darker, colder. It’s eerie, but in the distance he can hear the clinking of glasses, plates, and cutlery as the waiters prepare food.

“Are you sure? It doesn’t have to be so
Draco’s loath to run into Blaise and Bitty, knowing that they’re both lingering somewhere in the shadows, probably watching his every move. He forces himself not to wipe his sweaty palms on the legs of his traditional, fitted black tuxedo, his bow-tie feeling tight around his neck despite adjusting it several times before arriving at the event.
“Yes, okay.”
“Don’t worry about me, Draco. And I promise you, killing you right now would do them no favours. They’re desperate to get the dossier back, and they have no idea I have it, right?”
“You said this last time,” Draco says. Potter glances up at him, confusion writ across his face. Draco sighs. “A fortnight ago, the last pub night. I mentioned that you were...staring at me in a particularly hateful manner, and you said the same thing before cutting yourself off. I have the memory of a dolphin, as the Muggles say. What is it that you’re forgetting?”
“Then why do people keep fucking leaving me?” he asks angrily, pulling away from her. He makes his way to the only sofa without a rip in it and plops down, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around his legs.
“I fought with Potter,” he says after a moment. His ire slowly bleeds from him as he drains his glass and refills it.
“That’s not true,” Draco says softly. Granger smiles at him.
And it hits him.
“It’s worth a shot, Potter. We can’t continue on not knowing if she’s alright,” Draco sighs heavily, his left arm spasming as he shoves his hand into the pocket of his lab coat. He holds his weakening arm tightly against his side.
Harry doesn’t respond, and when no one answers his demands, Robards clears his throat.
“I’m so sorry. I could
Jenkins grabs under his arms and hauls him up against him so Draco is facing Gedeon again.

Potter chuckles. “You taste so delicious, Draco, I could feast on you forever. I’d never want for the taste of anything else.”
documents.”
Mia stares at him, a small, sad smile on her face before she says, “Harry will be there.”
He’s in
Draco closes his eyes briefly, kissing the top of her head. “He’ll understand. You...you were working through things.”
Blaise begins to scatter kisses up Draco’s neck, the hand that was playing with his nipple now gently brushing Draco’s hair from his forehead. Bitty suddenly glances up, and Draco doesn’t know if it’s because of seeing the two of them together, or maybe something in Blaise’s face, but she pulls away from Draco’s cock to crawl towards the bed.
“Now’s not the time, Potter,” Draco snaps. At that moment, Granger closes the space between them, her hands curling around the collar of Draco’s lab coat. Despite her very pregnant stature she’s able to jerk him forward with a surprising strength. But that’s not what causes the plummeting sensation in Draco’s belly. It’s the devastation written across her face―the brimming tears, the trembling gash of lips, the rigid posture―that does Draco in. His hands come up to gently cover Granger’s as she forcibly shakes him.
He watches in amusement as Potter steps up to the fireplace, his shoulders squared and his eyes narrowed. He leans forward and whispers, the slithering sound that slips between his lips sending a sharp jolt up Draco’s spine. He draws in a slow breath, his heart fluttering as heat rushes to his face.
“Why?” Harry asks.
“I’ll represent you,” Draco reassures her, placing his clammy hand on her shoulder.
“He can’t wait to see you on the broom, trust me! Like I said, he’s always had a bit of a crush on you,” Pansy says.
section, looking around shiftily before pulling down a book and tossing it into his already full tote. Harry’s pulled out of his ogling at Ginny’s low whistle.
Granger shrugs, her hand trembling as she smooths back her perfectly in place hair―another strange thing he’s noticed about her today―her hair is almost always done up in a messy bun. “Andromeda couldn’t make it so she sent me.”
“Indeed I am. So I say we finish the rest of this wine, have Kreacher pop us some popcorn, and we take advantage of that telly of yours?”

“I’d like you to explain your decisions behind resigning,” Draco states. “I’ve never known you to be a quitter, even in the face of adversity.”
“Fuck off! There’s someone in here!” he calls out.
“Oh, yeah, definitely,” Mia says, a line appearing between her eyebrows. “Are you sure you’re okay?”

“I do not treat it like some kinda game, Draco. I happen to really enjoy casual sex, it’s
Draco laughs. “Merlin, I would hope so,” he says, running a hand through his hair. He hasn’t thought about that letter in ages. Draco had only sent two that first month in Paris: one to Granger to apologise for calling her a Mudblood and not doing more to stop her from being tortured; the other to Luna for not doing more for her when she was a hostage at the Manor. Granger responded with a curt thank you and well wishes. Luna never replied, and Draco figured it was all for the best, leaving that nasty business in the past and all that rot. “How have you been?”
“I noticed Hannah when we were First Years,” Neville announced then, his hair flopping into his face, hiding the sudden flush to his cheeks. Hannah turned to him with an amused smile on her pretty round face.
There’s a pregnant pause before Harry tilts his head forward to press his lips to Draco’s forehead.
Expression still blank, Harry turns to Draco. “The Veil is my Horcrux. I’m linked to it and trapped in its magical manifestation. Destroying the Veil should release my soul to the other side, and release my body...so you can…” Harry trails off. Draco swallows with a nod.
Malfoy is snogging his older muggle boyfriend...
, I know! I would sell my soul for one of those sweet, Muggle icy drinks...you know, they come in little plastic cups with round lids, and an assortment of flavours.
Draco may not know how to measure the value of his life, but he knows it doesn’t rest on his Father’s approval anymore.
“Oh please, Harry, don’t look so bloody surprised.”
Potter looks ill. “It doesn’t matter! This is disgusting, using people as guinea pigs!”
He sinks down onto the floor, one white-knuckled hand clenching the edge of the counter as he huddles against the cabinet. Pansy follows him, legs tucking beneath her as a hand comes out to grasp his knee in consolation. He grits his teeth before taking another round of slow, deep breaths in through his nose and out his mouth before covering his face with his hands, uncaring of the throbbing pain in his cheek.
as he flips through documents he brought home from work.
Merlin, that smile. That smile causes butterflies in Draco’s stomach.
“God, I hope you didn’t hurt yourself,” Draco says acerbically.
. “Yeah, I reckon I would’ve. I love him. I — I thought he was
“Wow, well done. Your place is beautiful,” Draco says. Pansy turns around, a smile on her makeup-free face. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen Pansy without lipstick and the heavy kohl around her eyes.
Draco swallows down the lump rising in his throat and nods. “This,” he started, eyes burning. “This is my fault. I should have…” He trails off as his insides go cold with dismay even though he can feel the flush to his skin, red-hot and aching all at once. “I’m sorry,” he says with a note of finality, drawing his gaze downward to glare at his hands clasped in his lap. He clears his throat before turning his gaze back to the picturesque, cloudless window and says nothing more, but can tell when Siobhan steps a bit closer to his bed, her warmth radiating now only a foot away. Draco wonders how she can stomach looking at something like this – like
“Merlin, that’s priceless!” Potter says, slipping a finger under his glasses to wipe at his eyes. “So you’ve nothing to worry about, really, if you can handle that, you can handle this party, you’re a pro now.”
“Careful, Draco. With an attitude like that, I don’t see you reaching a happily ever after any time soon,” Zabini says in a falsely sweet tone, walking away.
Unless Potter wants to do it in secret.
, and he knows that, but he, er, he admitted that he’s just never felt quite as strongly, so…”
“I don’t want to hear any more of your excuses! Hold him up!” Gedeon snarls.
After several exchanges, Harry asked him:
Hermione and Weasley are sat together on an enlarged armchair in front of Draco and Harry. Weasley stares intently at the chessboard between them, elbows resting on his knees with his chin propped up on his hand.
Draco quirks a brow, thinking about what would lead his own friends into doing something similar. “And why would they do that...unless you were avoiding them?”
“Very. Some truly lovely poetry,” Harry responds quietly.
help, Potter. Right now, what I need is
Harry chuckles, holding the box in his lap as Draco pulls one out to mop up Harry’s face. When he’s all done, Harry places the box aside and tugs Draco to him once more.
“I think that’s pretty great,” Draco responds, nodding.
“I pulled the evening rotation tonight. Don’t wanna go, thought you’d take it over for me instead.”
“Did you miss me?” Draco asks, depositing his briefcase and jacket in a spare chair before taking a seat across from Potter.
He can’t control the shivers or rein in his thoughts as Bitty slowly sinks to her knees. Draco fixes his gaze on her, transfixed as she parts her full lips to wrap around the head of his cock.
“Ah, there you are! Don’t worry, Kreacher let me in,” Draco says cheerfully. “So good of you to join me, Potter. I hope you don’t mind some company.”
“Merlin. You look glorious, Draco,” she says, her eyes roaming over him. “Pink is definitely your colour.”
Harry shifts, feeling a bit embarrassed. “I find it comforting, touching something as solid and steady as a floor.” Especially when everything else around him is wildly spinning out of control and becoming less and less tangible.
with Bitty? Draco can’t help but think about her not so humble beginnings.
Draco’s eyes fly open. Blaise is standing before him, a concerned expression on his usually stoic face. Draco’s shoulders sag.
“Draco,” Pansy starts enquiringly. “Is she right about Potter?”
“No.”
Draco’s nervous. He’s never consumed Muggle drugs before, but he wasn’t going to admit that now that everyone was lighting their cigarette-looking drugs. Potter laughs beside him, placing the spliff in between his lips and pulling out his wand to light the tip. Draco watches carefully as Potter puffs on the end twice before inhaling deeply and holding it in. He blows out. Repeats the process. He holds out the spliff. “Don’t be afraid, you’ll love it.”
goes the mood. Draco glares at him. Theo’s always had a stick up his arse about him dating Potter. When he had first started exploring his sexuality at fifteen, Theo had been the one he’d done so with. They were both young and inexperienced, and although it had been an interesting year, Draco simply didn’t carry a torch for Theo like he did for Draco. Sixth year had come and Draco had been thrown into his task for the Dark Lord, leaving no room to continue his fling. They’d had sex a few times after the war, but then Potter had happened. Potter was fully aware of this and understood Draco valued his friendship with Theo.
Draco blinks rapidly, lowering the package and smiling. “Yes. And, ah, I will be going to Mia’s party tomorrow, actually.”
“Look at you. So beautiful laid out and on display for me. I want to remember every inch of you.”
single humiliating event in my fucking life?”
” he says haughtily, leaving no room for argument. The tone reminds him of someone, but he can’t quite place it. Either way, that was him told. Harry gives the man a sheepish, apologetic smile. The tailor goes back to work on Hermione’s hem without so much as another look in his direction. Harry, quite humiliated, looks up to Hermione as she struggles and fails to keep a straight face.
“Right,” Dean says, his breath hitching. “Let’s go.”
“Where are you going?”
Teddy is sprawled on his back, his little legs kicking out against the fluffy pillows and blankets underneath the silky, gauzy champagne-coloured fabric of the massive fort in the middle of his bedroom. The fairy lights and cut-out star and moon shapes that are supposed to be hanging from the ceiling of the fort are strewn about the room in what looks like a fit of rage. Harry cringes at Teddy’s high-pitched wailing.
“Please, let me explain—”
Draco’s gaze is suddenly furious and now trained on Harry. “It meant everything to me.”
going to say kinder, but now I kinda want to call you a prick,” he says wryly. “You seem kinder.”
“I will be once you come over,” he whispers. Potter raises an eyebrow but doesn’t question him any further, he just nods. Draco quickly scoots away from the hearth as Potter steps through. He’s shirtless and only wearing a pair of scarlet boxer-briefs with tiny snitches on them. Draco stands and immediately wraps his arms around Potter’s bare torso and presses his still tingling lips against Potter’s shoulder. “I couldn’t sleep,” he says, voice muffled.
Draco cranes his neck as he looks back, flashing the young women a grin. “Will do, ladies!” he calls back. Potter laughs.
“Are you sure, Malfoy? I was looking forward to getting to know you. Seems like you’re the only person I know in town for the summer,” he says, trying once more with a small, genuine smile.

“Barcelona sounds lovely, Gin, I know how fond you are of tapas,” he teases with a wry smile.
“You’ll notice that within the Death Chamber the spells you’re able to use have been limited. This was enacted after the Department of Mysteries was broken into back in 1996 and a Battle took place. I’m sure you can recall,” Granger drawls. “Too much magic in this Chamber can have some unfortunate reactions with the Veil. We’ve seen the archway begin to deteriorate since the end of the war, so I actually helped develop a sort of blocking system against certain spells. Extremely defensive magic, for one, could simply destroy this Chamber and all the untapped secrets with it. I do have a loophole in place. Wandless magic.”
The flutters go rampant. Draco touches his stomach, for once a smile creeps across his face at the sensation.
Harry doesn’t know exactly what the question is really for, but with Draco’s voice pitched so low, and filled with such uncertainty and yes, he can hear it,
“Have you tried opening it?” Draco asks, standing up straight and clasping his arms behind his back.
” Blaise repeats dramatically, his eyes dancing. “
As if reading his mind and being summoned, Bitty glides up to him, a large hot pink clutch under one arm. She’s donned a short, long-sleeved bubblegum pink dress that’s skin-tight and made of lace, a clunky black zipper down the front. Her choice of dress is quite unconventional compared to the ballgowns some of the other women are wearing. Draco would admire her nerve if he didn’t find her completely abhorrent.
“Right.”
“Well Professor Malfoy, when you’re giving your next lecture, in bloody Pureblood Social Graces, I’ll be sure to sign up!” he says, stopping to glare at him.
Potter comes back into the room, a forest green jumper with a gold
“I have to tell you, Mr Malfoy, that we are a split community it seems,” Simmons says, opening the briefcase set between them. He pulls out a copy of
“Merlin, I thought you high-tailed it out of here for good after last time,” she laughs, her shapely lips painted black. Her large hair is braided back into two neat rows, and she’s wearing a long, fitted black dress with chunky black platforms. Draco’s miffed that he can only peek some tattoos on her neck, wrists, and hands.
. It wouldn’t be the Dark Lord living in his house, or watching the murders of professors and fellow students, or torturing innocent people and being tortured that would make him lose his mind – it would be
After twenty minutes of deliberation, the verdict was announced: Lucius would serve ten years in Azkaban for his war crimes. Narcissa, who had already spent the last three months under house arrest, assisting Aurors in the removal of Dark artefacts from Malfoy Manor, is released with no further sanctions. The youngest Malfoy was also granted freedom from Azkaban, but sentenced to ten years without the use of magic, both wand and wandless. He would face a sentence of five years in Azkaban if caught brewing or attempting any spells. The family was also to pay twenty-five million galleons in reparations, and agree to demolish the dungeons in the Manor.

Dean stumbles back into a table of gadgets, his breath knocked from him. But he quickly regains his footing, reaching out to painfully grip Harry’s shoulders.
famous.”
“Please come here,” Draco whispers, lifting his hand before resting it on the side of the bed, palm up, fingers curled towards the ceiling. A few beats pass before Harry jerks one foot forward, ambling towards Draco like a calf fresh out of the womb, stumbling until he falls into Pansy’s vacated seat, his lips pursed and his eyebrows low and furrowed. Harry stares at Draco’s open hand.
“Seamus!” He tries again, determined not to sound as drunk as he is. He
Harry is surprised that it’s not terribly busy in the Louis B. Maybel-Sterling Paediatric Wing today. There’s a beautiful mosaic of a jungle with lions, monkeys, elephants, giraffes and zebras right behind the receptionist desk. The rest of the wing is painted in a soothing sky blue with little animal drawings scattered across the walls. There are toys, books, puzzles, and a flat screen TV to keep the young patients occupied as their tired, panic-stricken parents fill out forms and speak to one another in hushed tones.
Malfoy shifts in his seat, his gaze dropping down to his cup as he shrugs. “It’s whatever.”
, please forgive me.” Draco drops his head onto Potter’s shoulder, his face screwing up with another fresh wave of tears. He wants to tell Potter there’s nothing to forgive, it’s not his fault, it’s not his job to protect him.
“She…I tried not to talk about myself too much. Anyway, she was more interested in Voldemort, if that makes any bloody sense,” he grumbles. Draco, however, stares at him in disbelief.
“See. You see!?
Draco swallows and slowly turns around to crawl onto the bed, leaning back against his pillows, his arms loose at his sides.
“Thanks, Saeed. I wish you nothing but joy and prosperity,” he mutters, stepping around him and heading towards the loo.
he’s going to dinner with and he doesn’t really see why it’s important, it’s just Malfoy and it’s not like he’s thinking of Malfoy or this dinner as anything more than an outing with a potential friend, he doesn’t need to tell his friends what this is, and they certainly don’t need to know it’s Malfoy...right...at least not yet, and oh hell, he’s run-on sentencing.
“I’m a monster. That’s what all the papers are saying. That I attacked Smith because he found out I was a werewolf.”
“You’re not.”

He quickly ducks into a shadowy alcove when they both turn to peer down the hallway. When he’s sure the coast is clear, he peeks back around the corner, feeling only a little guilty for spying. Harry watches as Pansy crowds Ginny in the corner, towering over her with ease in those perilously high heels of hers. Harry holds his breath as he listens in on their conversation.
“No,” Teddy says resolutely, one tiny hand clinging onto Harry’s forearm as he balances on one socked foot, the other resting on Harry’s knee so Harry can tie the laces of his shoes.

“I didn’t tell you because the memory not only confused me, but, I, I didn’t know how to tell you without scaring you off. But even then, I knew I was where I was supposed to be.”
Draco’s silent for a moment. “He just has a vivid imagination. We don’t
Malfoy says reverently. “I
He shakes his head, pulling himself away from memories he’s buried deep in his mind for over six months. After the events of this morning, he can’t stomach thinking about her again. He wonders, for the first time in years, if he’s a monster, if running away from the true depths of his feelings or pushing away thoughts of his Mother have finally rendered him incapable of experiencing even a modicum of humanity and humility without spiralling into a deeper depression or experiencing a panic attack. A human being wouldn’t be able to exist in an abyss of numbness for so long without turning into a monster. He’s a monster.
When the door clicks shut, Draco runs a hand through his hair, adrenaline rushing through him.
Still feeling flushed, Draco runs a hand through his hair before untucking his shirt to hide his own effects from their kissing.
“I’m aware,” Gedeon snaps. “Honestly, Draco. I thought you of all people would’ve understood why I made that call, but I see you’re simply not willing to take this project to the next level. Your subject was taking too long to fully engage with the Veil. True communication did not happen until he experienced an NDE. We’ve saved time by making his discovery. Since you fail to see my point, I may have to re-evaluate the resources that the department is providing your little venture.”
“Don’t stress out over it. They love you, Harry. We all do.”
“You two are disgusting,” Draco jibes, joining in on their giggles. Harry walks up to the vase, anger crackling inside him, and picks it up, carefully turning it over in his hands. His shoulders begin to shake as a hysterical laugh bubbles up his throat. He spins on his heel, looking back at the curious expressions of his friends as he tilts his head back and laughs even harder. Everything,
Draco shakes his head, still scowling. “
Malfoy sticks out his index finger. “How the hell did
Thea rests her head against Draco’s. “I’m hungry,” she says.
Harry and Draco are just removing their winter jackets and scarves when Hermione steps through the floo. Teddy’s small frame is pressed against her shoulder and he’s slightly snoring. His peaceful, cherub face and current wild white blond hair pulls a warm smile from Harry. Draco immediately rushes forward to relieve Hermione of him, taking care not to wake him from his slumber. He smiles at her and then turns to Harry with a nod before making his way up the stairs to Teddy’s bedroom.
: here he is, in the loo down the hall from his office, barely able to conceal the moans escaping his dry lips. Thank Merlin for a Silencing Charm. Ashamed of himself, Draco is unable to destroy the picture afterwards and instead slips it into his wallet.
, my love,” Blaise starts gently. “Potter loving you in secret isn’t fair. I’m worried about you.”
. “Locked and loaded.”
Draco glances up at the doorway. Granger’s face is thunderous as she holds up Draco’s most recent findings from his experiment. Draco had been able to create the tablet, which could dissolve immediately under the tongue, allowing it to hit the bloodstream faster. Considering that he’s kept this side project a secret, he didn’t know exactly how to go about involving Granger, so he simply sent her a classified copy of all of his notes, methodologies, and subsequent testings.
, Draco wants to kiss him.
“Anything, Draco. Anything you want.”
Draco nearly chokes as he tries to hide his laugh over the ridiculousness of their cover. “I, for one, would like to disagree. This was a huge inconvenience to our honeymoon. I had to fight these creeps in just a Speedo. My modesty was in constant jeopardy.” One of the marine officers actually provided Draco a jacket earlier, but this did little to smooth away Draco’s annoyance over the whole wasted day.
person that can see him and he doesn’t remember the last six months of his life. Use that brilliant mind of yours...you know this is the work of something Dark if Potter died, came back in spirit form, but can’t be seen by everyone. You know you can help Potter by just telling us what happened.”
“I love you.”
about the situation is utterly fucking ridiculous to him.
It’s then that Draco sees it.
There’s rain pouring down outside now, the noise against the window of the bathroom rhythmic and soothing to Draco as he prepares for a shower, the old pipes rattling as he turns the water on to heat up. Potter agreed to wait for him in the kitchen, giving Draco the space he needed to wrap his brain around the events of the morning, and to offer a modicum of privacy now that Potter is practically haunting him. Draco threatened to find a Banishing Charm that would work on him if he opened his mouth or purposely sought out his housemates. This early, everyone would still be asleep, but Draco wasn’t keen on testing out Potter’s supposed theory that Draco is the only person capable of seeing him.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Of course I did. You ordered one every single time we visited a
The beautiful art in this chapter is from the fabulous artist, Maria AKA UpTheHill! Many thanks to her for bringing to life one of my favourite scenes in this story!
Draco decides he wants to be on top so he can control the pace. As he straddles a wickedly grinning Potter, who continues to knead the top of Draco’s thighs, Draco leans forward, lubes up two fingers, and presses them inside himself to make sure he’s properly open. He reaches behind himself to take a hold of Potter’s lubed cock. He bites his lower lip, hard.
“I want you to take your clothes off and get on the bed with me. I want you to get on top of me,” he suggests, voice thick. “Do you like the sound of that?”
It’s clear, it’s always been so clear, that whatever sick connection Harry has with Smith has always been more than just work related. Draco should’ve known that he would never be enough for Harry. He should have listened to his own thoughts before letting this soulmate connection lull him into believing theirs was a true love.

There’s a rather long pause before Ginny screeches, “
Draco takes another sip of his drink. Potter clears his throat.
“Harry?” A tingle runs down Harry’s spine. There’s no way he’ll ever get tired of hearing Draco say his name, especially when it’s said in such a soft, contemplative tone like that.
The light from the fire reflects in Draco’s glassy-eyed gaze, red-orange and white hot licking across grey.
Draco hadn’t planned on staying, but he finds himself sitting across from Harry at his kitchen table, nibbling on a piece of buttered toast as Harry rambles on about his plan to visit the Weasley’s for Sunday roast tomorrow. He’s hungover and feels grimy despite the fresh pair of thin grey joggers and green t-shirt Harry gave him to sleep in. The fit isn’t perfect, Harry being wider than Draco and a bit shorter, but it is easily the most comfortable clothing Draco has ever put on.
“Dean,” he whimpers in relief, his head lolling a bit as he tries to focus on his other friend.
“It was weird, those first few months after being Turned,” Harry admits.
“You’re a terrible sap, Potter,” he says, but bites his lower lip to clamp down on the pleased smile threatening to cross his face. That’s the thing about Potter. He’s a sap and he’s terrible with words, but when he tries it’s endearingly Gryffindorish and Draco’s finding he doesn’t mind it. He’s starting to appreciate Potter’s shit way with words just as much as the long looks, the gentle caresses, and the sweet kisses he bestows on him. Potter chuckles, his eyes crinkling at the corners and reaches out an arm to curl around Draco’s waist to pull him in closer, his fingers skimming the soft cotton t-shirt Draco’s worn to bed. Beside him like this, Draco can almost forget the reasons why they haven’t slept next to one another all week, or why he needed the other man here tonight in the first place.
” he says, voice muffled. “All this time I’ve been saying he didn’t want to get married,” Draco wheezes. “The truth is he just didn’t want to marry
Hermione shoves him in the side with a sharp elbow. Harry laughs softly as he wraps an arm around her shoulders, pulling her in close as Dean’s sensible ground floor flat comes into view. “You know if we bomb his flat, his muggle neighbours will smell it,” Harry says.
Draco’s distaste for her increases ten-fold.
because of their stats. And bloody hell, your
Draco turns to grab his jacket slung across the back of his seat.
“Are we going to go in or not?” Draco asks with a pointed glare his way. Harry shifts from one foot to the other before bouncing on spot, as if to rev himself up.
As I live and breathe, Draco fuckin’ Malfoy!” Smith announces with a sneer. “I thought all you snake-y bastards fled the country.”
“Fuck, yes,” Draco whines, hands gripping the edge of the nearest sofa cushion. “Fuck, she’ll,
The office door clicks shut.
“Yes!” Draco nearly shouts. “Because it shows that you really are a fucking arsehole, Harry, and that I made a
Panic prickles its way up his chest and lodges painfully in his throat. He rips his gaze away from the carving to the empty park, drinking in the carefully manicured grass, its blooming flowers, and the memorial benches formed in a loose circle. The sharp scent of dirt and fresh cut grass fills Draco’s nose. The proof that he was once in love is immortalised in worn wood. His fingers trace the jagged carvings, eyes still trained forward, his chest aching.
“I told you before not to use silly terms of endearment with me, Potter. And it’s nothing to worry your tiny brain over. He punched me and the Healers kept me overnight to monitor my concussion,” he drawls, and it’s smooth. He’s surprised at how smooth the lie comes out, even with his Occlumency shutters high in defence. He’s so grateful for Pansy’s quick ability to lie, like the perfect snake she is. All thoughts of wanting her to go home last night fly out the window; he could kiss her right now.
A choking sound escapes Harry. “
Rodrigo chuckles. “I’m sure she says that about all her…clients,” he says, his dark eyes dancing.
Not Draco. Not
Harry looks over at Draco’s laughing form and his breath catches. As dusk falls around them, Draco is illuminated by the descending sun, his white blond hair and sharp features softening. Harry can’t help the warm feeling spreading across his chest as his eyes flit over Draco. He wants to commit this image of him today to memory. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen Draco look so comfortable and happy, especially in a plain white t-shirt and worn jeans. His face is open, contemplative, and calm as he quiets and sips from his beverage, watching the trailers that come on before the film.
“Yeah, you really do, mate,” Ron says with an encouraging nod.
“You better be careful with him, Potter. I won’t ever forgive you if you hurt him.
” he chokes out, his free hand slapping across his forehead. “Christ.”
Draco’s mind races. Perhaps he could work this case from the inside out—make sure a whiff of his antics with his friends haven’t caught DMLE’s attention. Harry wouldn’t be discussing this with him in such detail if he thought him a suspect.
With a jolt, Draco turns on his heel to face Potter and his stupid, sympathetic expression. Embarrassed, Draco clenches his jaw and affects an air of nonchalance.
“Can I?” he asks, his entire body going rigid.
You can’t keep—”
, a tiny voice says.
Draco hums quietly in agreement, rocking in his seat, but then suddenly thinks of how Blaise said he was over it. It wasn’t the first time Blaise had said something like that, but it was the first time he said it to protect someone other than himself, Draco, or Pansy. And that worries Draco.
“Hey,” Potter starts softly, soothing. “I know you’re probably crawling in your skin right now because of her shitty comments, believe me, I’ve been there. She’s been especially nasty since I sent Kreacher away to one of those posh house-elf retirement facilities.”
me, Potter.”
“Oh, you know,” he starts, grinning at his mate, “catching up on the latest gossip.”
“What were you expecting?” he asks loftily.
“That certain, are you?”
Millie’s eyebrows furrow. “I heard the Selwyns have dealings in the Muggle Black Market.”
Malfoy’s in the middle of the floor— as if the very establishment was erected just for him. With the rainbow coloured lights flashing across his alabaster skin, practically glimmering off him like that, it’s as if he’s precious crystal. Harry’s jaw drops.
Harry's nose tucks behind Draco’s ear and he breathes in deeply. “I swear to you: I never wanted to hide you. I was shocked when you suggested we see one another in secret, but I wanted to be with you so badly, I would entertain the idea while trying to convince you that we didn’t have to hide our relationship. I’m...not quite sure about the beer garden incident, but it sounds like it had nothing to do with you and everything to do with a flood of people entering an enclosed area. I’m still getting used to overwhelming crowds...it’s...a lot of different scents, and sometimes it gives me anxiety. I also didn’t know you heard that conversation, and I’m so sorry you had to. Smith made everything complicated, and I lost control of myself, my life, for a while...” Harry confesses. “I will spend the rest of my life making it up to you and proving myself worthy of your trust.”
“Really? Are you?”
It would be so simple for Harry to snatch the candelabra at his feet and swing it at Draco’s head. Or lunge at the shaking man in order to wrap his hands around his long, thin pale neck. Or push him to the ground and into the fire.
The look of utter confusion on her face causes him to choke back a laugh. He can’t wait until she figures
“Draco. There is no one beside you. If Harry were a ghost, I would be able to see him too.”
The first thing he notices is that he’s soaked to the bone. The second is that Draco’s nose is definitely broken.
“It’s so short, I can see her hot pink knickers, Draco! For fuck’s sake, I don’t know why I try with her, I don’t! Look, I’ll be right back,” Hermione says, stomping over to Weasley and pulling him down to fiercely whisper in his ear. Draco catches Pansy’s eye, and she waves jovially at him before turning to face an approaching Blaise, his arms spread wide as he gives her an appreciative smile, no doubt complimenting her choice of outfit.
Potter laughs.

“Draco, what the hell happened to your face?” Draco opens his mouth to stumble out some sort of answer but Pansy jumps in.
He spends the rest of November and the first week of December taking his Auror practicals, but he can’t recall what was on the exams. He goes to the pub with his fellow trainees, but the conversations go in and out of his ears in an nonsensical mishmash of words and sounds. He visits Ron and Hermione’s for dinner, but doesn’t taste the food on his tongue. He does his household chores, but doesn’t feel the familiar burn of satisfaction. He goes out to Ginny’s Hen party at a stripclub followed by a private booth with unlimited drinks in a posh nightclub in Diagon Alley, all while draped in a sash that reads,
“I wouldn’t want you to exhaust that brain of yours,” Draco says, a thrill running through him as Potter leans into the touch.
it—your overwhelming willingness to die is what brought me back to my...this, to my humanity.”
“You know what I love about this whole ordeal? With working with Mark and his dad? We all love a good before and after picture,” Andrews says, gently touching the polaroid of Millie. “She looks so happy here. I wonder what face she’ll make when I slice her open.”
long time.
“He’s living as a muggle,” Harry whispers back.
“What?” she snaps, biting into her sandwich. “Her family only amassed their fortune within the last hundred years or so,” she says around the sandwich, not even bothering to chew and swallow first.
Draco can tell even in the dim light of their bedroom Potter is flushing, but his expression is still confident as ever, his fingers gently caressing his stomach before landing on the buttons of his jeans, popping one button open at a time in a slow, torturous pace. He pushes his pants and jeans down his legs, kicking them off each foot. Potter’s then standing before him in all his glory. Draco’s chest  rises and falls rapidly, his heart pounding painfully at the sight. He’s never seen anyone as gorgeous as Potter. With his skin, kissed gold, his wild, shaggy jet black hair pulled back into a knot at the base of his neck, his stubble gracing his strong jaw, taut, brawny body and bright, almond-shaped green eyes— he’s something from a dream.
Draco winces. “We’ve agreed to date in a way that’s free from the public’s eyes and ears,” Draco says carefully, taking a sip from his drink and averting his eyes.
Draco's face crumples as a sob escapes him.
When Harry agrees to complete his final psych rotation for Healer training at an ominous asylum, nothing will prepare him for the secrets and people he’ll encounter there.
“I think it’s bigger than your new one at the Manor,” she quips, stepping around him to enter the elegant drawing room. Draco shrugs.
Draco throws his arms around him, his heart pounding, his head pounding, spinning with disbelief. He’s concussed, surely, hallucinating. But Harry is in his arms, Draco’s burnt hands press against warm, solid flesh. Harry’s arms are tight around Draco’s body, squeezing him so hard it almost hurts but Draco doesn’t care. He tucks his face into the crook of Harry’s neck. He’s real.
Draco’s hand darts out. He snatches his missing Louboutin tassel out of the air. The one he had blamed Sprinkles of destroying.

His Occlumency walls immediately slam to the forefront of his mind, sheltering his consternation, but even as his face smooths out into a blank wall Potter sets down his cup and reaches across the table, his hand planting firmly on Draco’s side of the table.
my poor attempt at humour(?), drama queen!Draco (but who doesn’t want that?!), lots of kissing, so much ridiculousness
He’s relieved when Flint senior claps him on the shoulder and thanks him. It also helps that his nifty snuff bullet is placed carefully in his back pocket. Draco doesn’t think he’ll use it, but knowing it’s there in case his natural good mood plateaus keeps him afloat.
His head is full of so many questions and startling, frightening poignant answers that he’s tried to bury for so long. He wants to cry. He only avoids the onslaught of tears by belatedly realising that the men who had caught him snogging are exiting the toilets, all three of them turning to laugh in his direction. He still needs to pee, badly. He turns back towards the toilets, sniffling.
“It’s okay, Draco,” Luna says, gracefully rising to her feet to sit beside him on the bed. She places a consoling hand on his knee. “And you’re going to help find him so he can be happy?”
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Harry hisses.
“Did you think I wasn’t going to find out?” Draco asks this as if he’s gently chastising a child. He turns to shut the door, facing away from Harry. Something slips by his mask because Draco shudders and rests his head against the door for a few beats. “I trusted you,” Draco’s small, broken voice hitches.
But Harry is turning away from him again.
“I can’t imagine how difficult that must’ve been for you.”
. He had bared so much of his soul to him, had learned so much about himself through him, had done things with him he’d never done with anyone else. He was in love with him and this wasn’t some disillusioned version of picture-perfect he’s clinging to. He felt that this love was real, mature, and tangible. Then again so was the love he had felt for the woman crying beside him. She’s no longer a lover and a partner as he’d once expected, but now an irreplaceable ally. He pulls her into a fierce hug.
Draco gets to his feet. Wipes his sweaty palms as he smooths his jumper down on the sides. “I should go.”
“I wanted to pull her out, I did. Every single day staying with Marcus and his family was a direct threat to her wellbeing, but she refused to step away from the investigation.”

“We were friends for a long time,” Draco says, nodding.

Draco feels a wave of shame hit him. His gaze immediately locks on the thin scar across the base of Harry’s neck. Harry’s marking proves he’s a hero, Draco’s proves he’s a coward.
At this, several people around the room bustle. Draco doesn’t care – as soon as he stepped from the doorway, half the room fixed him with hateful eyes, the other half merely looked suspicious. He doesn’t expect miracles—it’s only been three years since the war, and even though he’s making a career out of putting away bad guys, Draco

“Hermione, did you hex Parvati?” he whispers. Hermione flinches, but fixes Harry with a look of defiance.

“It was just a friendship between us at first, you know?” Hannah continued, “But I was so in love with him, I just didn’t know how to put those feelings into words. Neville was so patient with me—he was a true shoulder to lean on that whole year after the war. He regularly came to visit on the weekends and we’d meet in Hogsmeade. I finally gathered up the courage to tell him how I felt, and well, we never looked back.”
Gedeon approaches the dais, devastation clear on his face as he takes in the flaming Veil and apparition. “You’ve destroyed it! You’ve destroyed
“What the fuck does that have to do with anything, Potter? If I fuck someone, will that prove that I’ve moved on? You’ve fucked so many people, you’re going to have to move to the continent to meet someone new. I don’t see how fucking everything in trousers or a skirt is going to erase the memory of what you had with Dean or with Ginny for that matter, you self-righteous arsehole. When I decide to become intimate with someone, I won’t be fucking them. I’ll make love with that person and it won’t be for revenge or to make some sort of point like you do.”
“Ginny—” he begins, perturbed by her outburst, but before he can chastise her, she’s tugging him away from their hidden spot and towards the staircase.
Draco smirks. Potter’s right – he is grossly attentive— but Draco likes to be contrary as much as possible in the face of Potter’s Gryffindorianism. “It doesn’t matter. It was Slytherin Pub night. You know the rule: No Gryffindor Prats allowed,” he says with a shrug.
,” he adds quickly when he notices the slight stiffening of Malfoy’s shoulders.
But right now, he feels safe. He feels hopeful. As he stands up straight, pressing against Harry’s warm side, Draco is grateful to be alive for the first time in months. He’s grateful to be able to feel all the pain, the grief, the fear, the relief and the love. So, so, so much
“No, wait,” Draco says. “Hold me for a bit, please?” he asks, resting his head against Potter’s shoulder.
“Is this where you buy your books?” Draco asks, peering into the dark shop window, yellow shelves upon yellow shelves of books as far as Draco’s eye can see. He has a vivid image of Harry strolling through the isles looking for Neruda, and smiles fondly.
“I’m so sorry, Pansy,” Draco says, placing a hand on her shoulder.
A light flashes in Harry’s face. “Who the
“I never loved you, Theo,” he says bluntly. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hand, his stomach churning. “This is getting out of hand, it’s seriously starting to negatively impact our friendship.” Theo stands in front of him. “What about Daphne, do you think she feels good watching her fiancé fling himself at another man?”
He grasps his wand, focusing on the wild flutters in his stomach as he thinks of Harry, of his smiles, his laughter, his gentle caresses, the shape of his mouth and the feel of his hair, of him saying,
“Oh, it’s Thomas now,” she says with a smile.
“Yes, Potter,
tight. Harry pushes forward, every inch he pushes in is short thrusts until he’s halfway in. The rest of the way is eased by a greedy thrust from Draco until his pelvis is pressed against Draco’s bum.
His eyes grow wide as he recognises Draco’s favourite Björk song,
Potter’s eyes search Draco’s face with such an intensity that Draco’s knees weaken. “May I kiss you?”
“I had to be sure.”
for me to hate you…”
The paper is plucked from out of his hands.
“How dare he show his face!” someone shouts from the crowd. Shouts of agreement ring out –
Pansy coughs behind Draco, her hand grazing his elbow. Draco shifts his weight to his other foot, the nervous ball in his stomach growing as he glances at Pansy, a grin on her face. He doesn’t know what she’s got up her sleeve.
He suddenly has a thought so overwhelming that her response goes unheard.
One of Smith’s friends has his arm pressed against Harry’s neck, the other holding his wand against the side of Harry’s face. Draco can see Harry struggling against silver Binds tying his wrists behind his back, his feet stuck to the ground.
, do please share. Again, many thanks to the mods for this fest. And thank you to my beta for their immense wisdom and insight.
“I’m starting to think this is personal,” Draco mutters to himself. He starts when he hears a snort beside him. Potter has been sitting beside him silently this entire time.
I wasn’t obsessed with him!”
Harry huffs, suddenly looking pensive. “I don’t know,” he says with a short, brittle laugh. “Peace of mind? Real happiness?”
But then he thinks of Smith, and how he had run his fingers through Draco's hair before telling him to stay away from Potter. Draco draws in a breath too quickly, too sharply, and his diaphragm constricts painfully. It’s something he’s been dealing with since Smith’s assault, along with a flare up in intrusive thoughts. Anytime he thinks about the man, he’ll breathe too deeply, and pain will erupt throughout his chest. He’s starting to think this reaction might be psychosomatic.
“I know,” Harry says, shoving his trembling hands into his pockets. “I, er, wasn’t trying to eavesdrop.”
“You’re right about that. Fuck all the niceties. How have you been, you wicked witch?”
growing in his chest with each breath he takes.
“I don’t know. It might be better than what I’ve got going in my living life.”
Hi loves!
Draco can feel Harry’s body tense beside him. “Do you
“Congratulations,” Draco says, shifting in his seat to stare out the window as he sips his beer.
“Bollocks! Let me ask you a question, Malfoy. Have you even
“It’s okay. It’s okay to feel this. Let it out,” Draco says.
“HARRY!” shouts Teddy’s high-pitched squeaky voice. “HARRY, I CAN’T FIND MY SPARKLY SHOES!”
“It’s easier said than done,” Longbottom pipes up, determinedly staring at the table to avoid everyone’s eyes.
He buries himself further under his heavy duvet, a low moan escaping him as he turns on his side and curls up into a foetal position, trying to maintain as much heat as possible.
When Draco hears rather than sees first, a drunk and shouting Smith walking through the door of the garden, arm draped around some poor young witch, Draco decides it’s time to go.
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Draco says, a part of him sorely regretting that fact. “Though, I did invite him to this monstrosity of an event. Alas, he can only deal with Pureblood snobbery in small doses.” Draco plucks a flute of champagne from the tray of a passing waiter.
“Yeah, I know Hermione,” he says, suddenly worried about the direction of this conversation. He doesn’t want Hermione to “unpack” anything with him right now. Or ever, if he can swing it. “I’m okay,” he urges. “I’ll be—”
I’d like to mention here that Draco’s brutal assault is a case of stranger rape, and in addition, briefly discuss my reasons behind depicting a stranger rape in this story.
with her?” Draco asks, staring at him wide-eyed in shock. “The creepy Dark Lord obsessed wench?”
----------
“No,” Draco says, a mocking smile on his face.
He’s suddenly overcome with memories of his first time. Dean on his knees as Harry’s throbbing cock hit the back of his throat. Dean’s fingers slowly opening him up for what felt like hours, then pinned beneath Dean as he’s ruthlessly fucked into his mattress. Good on his word, Dean had him screaming so loud someone surely would have called the police for the murder happening next door, had Grimmauld Place not been warded against his muggle neighbours’ eyes and ears.
The next morning, Draco wakes with a start when he hears a soft knock on their bedroom door. His hand quickly reaches under his pillow to grope for his wand. He relaxes when he feels the soft thrum of magic as his hand wraps around it. “Come,” he murmurs as he wipes the sleep from his eyes. Potter’s unruly head appears behind the door before he pushes it open with his elbow, a tray of food in his hands. “Hey,” Potter says quietly, a soft smile on his face. “I thought maybe you’d like some breakfast, so, er, I brought it up to you.”
Draco runs his fingers through Harry’s hair, the flutters in his stomach soft and gentle. Draco cradles Harry’s bandaged hand against his chest, his other curling a fistful of Draco’s jumper. “Of course I will, I’ll stay with you forever and ever,” Draco replies quietly.
“This is

can pretend not to be broken and angry. The more he’s talked to Pansy, the more he’s grasping how unstable he is. “This was a mistake,” he says quietly, echoing Pansy’s warning. “I never should have moved in with you.”
“So I can either walk you home or get you a taxi. I’d say we’ve both had a bit too much to Apparate.”

“You’re such a

Padma takes a cautious step forward, wordlessly lighting the tip of her wand as her gaze roams about the room. “I do not understand.”
Harry stands nervously in the foyer of a tall slate grey building. He’s sure he’s at the right place. There are no names on the lit-up directory, and per the list, there are two buttons that might lead to penthouses in the enormously posh building. His fingers skate over the buzzers for each flat, not at all eager to ring the wrong person. It’s then that the door leading to the main lounge flings open, a severe looking middle-aged woman clenching a small Pomeranian to her chest stepping out. She looks upon him with extreme interest, her shrewd eyes roaming his body from top to bottom. After an approving hum

more firmly. “But, why didn’t he want to marry me? Why didn’t he love me? I mean…what’s the matter with me?” Draco asks in a strained, tinny voice. Harry has never seen Draco this vulnerable and it awakens in him this possessiveness, this need to
He’d spent his night with Harry carefully crafting his recusal letter to the Chief Prosecutor, knowing fully that the man is in bed with Flint. Draco had then spent the rest of the day explaining to Harry how he'd conducted each robbery, how he'd planned on influencing the case, how he’d become somewhat dependent on Muggle drugs, and his fucked up encounter with Blaise and Bitty. Harry had sat through it, listening carefully, not judging him. He'd made Draco dinner, held him, kissed him, and made love to him instead.
“Fuck this, Smith. I’m not gonna die in this alley!” Smith’s remaining crony cries out, shoving Draco towards him before turning to run down the alley. Harry stretches his arm out and clenches his fist and the crony screams, the sound blood curdling, as he collapses onto the pavement, disappearing beyond the cracks.
Harry shrugs. “I’m a work in progress,” he admits, startled by his own honesty. “Why are you in the muggle world?”
The next time Harry sees Draco Malfoy after the trials, they’re both in Diagon Alley and it’s a cloudless, humid Friday.
You think you’ve finally gotten back into the good graces of your parents after running away for eloping with a man. You think the Wizarding world has forgiven you of your sins during the war. You think you can have this perfect, cookie-cutter no-frills life and anything that threatens it needs to be repressed or flat out destroyed. I won’t let you do that to Teddy.”
“I need you,” Draco whimpers as he crawls into Harry’s lap. Harry throws up a one-way Silencing charm. They need to be comforted, they need to feel one another and know that they’re in this together. Harry’s careful as he removes his and Draco’s clothing, as his hands caress Draco’s hot skin, and as he slides into Draco’s body. He’s careful as he kisses Draco’s fears and his regrets away and soothes his overwrought nerves. They make love and it’s a slow and gentle conversation exchanged between them. When Draco comes undone, he opens up, so Harry can see every inch of his bared soul.
“Why don’t we head back to your office to flesh out our next steps?” Potter asks. Draco’s about to agree when someone clears their throat from behind them.
This didn’t happen to
“It’s just not normal for someone so awful to look that good, it’s not,” she mutters, shaking her head.
When Draco finally arrives at The Apothecary, potion portfolio in hand, he pulls the door open but doesn’t step in.
“We’re all superb liars,” Potter says gravely. Potter’s mouth ticks up into a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes, his gaze piercing nonetheless. Draco feels a chill run up his spine.
“What the fuck do you think I’ve been doing, eh, Potter? I think I’ve been doing a pretty decent job at pulling myself together.”
He carefully makes his way to an armchair across from Malfoy’s state-of-the-art entertainment centre. He feels weak and suddenly very cold, but surprisingly a lot clearer than earlier, having chundered
There’s a wicked slant to Potter’s brows as he leans into Draco’s personal space, that excitable energy spilling into the charged air around them. “You’re worth flattering.”
It’s hot and heavy and for some reason blood pumps through his veins and shoots down to his cock. He tries to ignore it, but the tingling sensation as his cock hardens is too difficult to ignore.
“We could find a spell. There’s got to be something at the Manor, some kind of resurrection spell to bring him back,” James says.
“Ah…” Neville starts. Draco watches as Neville gently nudges Hannah in the side to quiet her giggling. “It’s cannabis.”
Andrews laughs in amusement. “You really are something, aren’t ya? You don’t think I’ve been on to you since these string of burglaries were brought to the attention of the Auror Office? Preliminary research into the families with the most confiscated Dark artefacts after the war was conducted. You and that druggie Nott were top of the list of possible suspects. Ex-Death Eater and Death Eater’s son. Bruised and battered from the war, treated unjustly in education and workforce environments, murdered or incarcerated fathers. Drug problems. Christ, you are both the textbook profile of a criminal vigilante. I could arrest you now and no one in this bloody office would blink an eye!”
“I love you, Draco.”
Harry bursts into laughter despite his aching head. “Oh, Merlin!” Malfoy joins in his laughter.
The young witch thanks Draco profusely as he walks her to the door much later, having helped her pick the best medicinal hair regrowth and care potions after using an unfortunate dye potion from a different shop. Draco glances down at his watch again. It’s 11:08am.
“So, Potter, what I’m saying is,” he starts slowly, as if speaking to a child, “please see yourself to one of the many seats that are nowhere near me. Thank you.” He crosses his legs at the knees and takes another sip from his glass.
,” Draco whispers, his heart pounding, pressure in his groin thrumming, his cock stirring. His brain goes blank for a split second as his hand curls around Harry’s thick girth.
Draco wants him too, but right now there’s too much going on in his head.
“Of course! Why—”
Potter’s expression is hard and a twinging of a strangely familiar sensation starts in the centre of Draco’s chest. It feels like dipping one’s finger into hot wax, just on the edge of painful, stopped short when the air hits the wax, and it’s oddly comforting. There’s a few beats of silence between them until Draco nods reluctantly, pushing away the odd feeling. He notices that the sun has gone, hidden behind grey clouds. It looks like it’s about to rain. “I have to get ready for work soon.”
“Draco!” Gedeon says, voice rich and deep. He smiles kindly at Draco. “I knew you’d be in. I’m so sorry for your loss.”

Harry pulls him in close and they kiss, softly, tenderly.
A faint heat spills across Draco’s face. His black neckroll jumper feels impossibly hot. He clears his throat. “Did you just—”
. Late to your own party,” Pansy says, her husky voice flat, but eyes glinting with mirth. A martini glass is grasped in her red-tipped hand as she approaches them, a gorgeous blonde woman following close behind her.
It’s a large room, with floor-to-ceiling windows with the heavy blackout drapes currently pulled back, allowing sunshine to spill into the room, heating the wooden floors and illuminating dust particles Draco kicks up as he strolls the space. He notes the color-coordinated files, the alphabetised books on the massive shelves behind the office desk that’s set in the middle of the room, with its lush leather chair. The laptop Potter mentioned earlier is sat on top of the desk beside an inbox/outbox, along with yesterday’s copy of the
“The pleasure is all mine, Harry. I look forward to having tea with my son
“Merlin, I knew we shouldn’t have come here,” Millie says wildly, spinning on her heel and jabbing a finger into the centre of Theo’s chest. “This is your fault, getting us this fucked up and belligerent!”
“I wish I could kiss you right now.”
“Happy New Year,” Draco responds, squeezing Harry back. “Now let’s go back in and get completely sloshed.”
Draco makes an amused sound. “My own personal house elf, making sure I eat every day. Going to personally escort me down to dinner, too? Mm? Pour my portions, and refill my wine glasses, too?” he asks, shooting him a wry smile.
“Pans, I’m telling you babe, the beer garden is absolutely gorgeous,” he says, thoughts lingering to Potter’s glass green eyes and smiling face. He wishes Potter would smile more often.
It was late in the afternoon when Draco finally re-emerged onto Portobello Road feeling full, dazed, and incredibly aroused. The vendor ladies had been packing away their booths when they saw him, both breaking into cheers while giving him a thumbs up that had Draco blushing furiously.
“Yes, you are,” Harry says, kissing his temple.
Harry laughs. “I know you’re an arsehole. I actually love that part of you. You lock away a bit of yourself, and only someone that’s really
, I believe I see some sanctimonious prats—
Kreacher pulls out the cloak, brandishing it with a flourish in front of him. Draco grins.
“Wotcha, Malfoy! I’m on my way to the kitchen, are ya itchin’ for a cuppa?” she asks loudly and jovially.
“Merlin, I’ve never seen her so bloody happy,” he hears Zabini say. “Completely different person.”
to hold onto his newly attained autonomy. Potter’s influences are
Draco feels a swell of anger bloom in the centre of his chest, immediately knowing what Potter is referring to. “I don’t know what you mean,” he says coldly.

perform at the wedding?” Ron asks in astonishment. “Mum is practically beside herself!” They both turn to see Molly clinging to Arthur, looking torn between rushing over to Celestina or fainting where she stands.
“It’s bloody brilliant,” he says, a warmth of pleasure spreading in his belly and then up to his chest where it flutters about wildly. “He’s brilliant.”
It also helped that Draco, in addition to his legal mind, has a prolific grasp on Ancient Runes, 5th century Mervingian Dynasty era Runes, to be precise, thanks to Lucius. Of course Lucius had hammered such a rare, powerful type of magic into his son since infancy. The fact that most of the cursed objects Draco encountered were not even from this century only benefited him in developing the appropriate protective spells based on Mervingian theory. The average person would not be able to trace Draco’s magical signature within such ancient protective magic. Even a highly skilled researcher would have to somehow narrow down this particular strain of magic out of hundreds and thousands of different Runic iterations, and have a sample of Draco’s strain to link him to it. After all, the 5th century was an
In front of him, Draco might as well be dead.
you are and how much you’re worth waiting for, then he’s a dozy fucker and doesn’t deserve you or access to your arse.”
The kitchen and the sitting room are joined, and Draco can keep an eye on Potter while he sits at the small table and waits patiently as Jeremy puts the kettle on. Draco’s surprised that he’s doing everything the Muggle way.

He finally responds two days after Draco’s last text. It’s a lie. A horrible one, too. But Harry can’t bring himself to tell Draco that he
“Daraja’s cancer is back,” Draco interrupts, a faraway look in his eyes as he collapses into Harry’s favourite armchair. “Our initial treatment plan was not as aggressive as we hoped it would be,” Draco explains, his voice sounding thin. “Despite my new rotation in Obstetrics, I’ve remained a part of her treatment team...I…”
“It was the most beautiful, most spiritual connection I’ve ever experienced with another person. We ended up vomiting out all of our pain, our insecurities, and our fears about our relationship. We became one with the earth, but more importantly, we became one heart, one mind,

about how to counter-program some of the toxic policies and backhanded deals. If Kingsley has to sacrifice his position, then so be it. Ideally, there would be a new election for Minister.”
Draco doesn’t know what the fuck is happening, or how he arrived to the Atrium in the first place. He closes his eyes and wills the trembles away, his hands curling into fists as he lowers his arms to his side. He sorts through his memories, usually so painfully organised. During their Occlumency and Legilimency teaching sessions, Aunt Bellatrix used to praise him in between bouts of Cruciatus for his mental tidiness.
that,” Draco hisses.
say it back. But he can’t bear to watch Potter become this helpless person because he’s been touched by Draco’s trauma. Potter doesn’t deserve to feel that way. And yes, maybe he’d been coming to terms with his feelings for Potter before, but now, well now he doesn’t know how to function, at least not enough to try to return those three words. Though his crippling anxiety sometimes pushes Potter away, he doesn’t want to let go of Potter either, as his presence is the only reason he’s held onto some modicum of sanity in the last several weeks. It’s selfish, but Draco’s never considered himself a generous or brave man.
taste,” Pansy corrects, once again turning back to the wardrobe to pull out a green frock. She steps back to look into the mirror attached to the door of the wardrobe, holding the dress against her before shoving it back into its rightful place. “This little adventure works out for me at the end of the day.” Pansy sighs, glancing over at him. “What I’m trying to say is that I get it. I understand where you’re coming from.”

find you?” Draco tsks, crossing his arms against his naked chest. “Is this something I’m going to have to deal with forever?”
“Yes, well. Good.” He sticks his hand out to Coelho. “Draco Malfoy,” he announces. “And my date, Pansy Parkinson.”
Draco pivots towards Blaise, whose eyes are wide with concern.
He’s suddenly reminded of the summer before Fifth Year with Millie, when they were 14 and Lucius, having started early on the scotch, inappropriately called her
Irritation shoots through Draco with a sting. He levels Finnegan with a bored look. “I merely said that your singing is torturous, Finnegan. Clearly, I’m not the only bystander who believes this,” Draco drawls, gesturing to the patrons who are currently pretending not to be listening.
The garden is also entirely empty, surprising for a Wednesday evening. But most people are piled out in front of the Leaky instead, lounging on the picnic benches, enjoying the break in rain and slightly warmer temperature that has lulled cranky Londoners into a good mood. Taking advantage of the oasis, Draco makes a beeline for the cushioned armchairs. A content sigh escapes him as he sinks into the chair, the music swelling around him as he takes a sip from his glass and closes his eyes, a small smile gracing his lips.
“That day, in the park when those monsters bullied Teddy. When we came home, I gave him a bath, he…he told me he wished his penis would fall off. He said he wished that it never existed in the first place…because he’s not supposed to have one.”
“Maybe I’m fine not knowing how. I don’t want to come back to life. Maybe I’m fine feeling like an idiot and suffering in silence.” He quickly wipes away the first drop of a tear.
Blaise’s confused frown is all for show and as elusive as ever. “I’m not sure what you mean.”
“I don’t know...There’s something nice about exploring my sexuality with different types of people. I think it helps develop my expectations and confidence towards sex.”
Draco nods and cradles Potter’s face in his hands before their mouths meet. And it’s perfect, Draco thinks, his fingers now in Potter’s hair as the kiss becomes frenzied. They kiss vehemently, not at all like the tender kisses they have been prone to do as of late. Potter holds him tighter around his waist as he tugs the bottom of his lip between his teeth. It’s like a fierce and sultry dance as they moan, lick, and gasp against each other’s mouths. Draco’s so enthralled by Potter’s wicked tongue he shamelessly whimpers in the back of his throat, breaths coming out in heavy gusts through his nostrils as his eyes flutter shut and he wraps his arms around Potter’s neck.
“Oh… erm, yes, no, I MEAN
When the door clicks shut, Harry sits up in the bed, grabs his glasses from the nightstand and putting them on, begins to hyperventilate. He’s spent the better half of the year squashing any romantic feelings he had for Draco and now he’s manipulated his best mate into sex during a time of vulnerability and grieving. He feels nauseous and above all else, he feels ashamed. He needs to fix this somehow – Draco isn’t like the other men and women he’s had one-offs with. Another kind of anxiety sets in, prickly and much more insidious than the first: what if he loses Draco because of this?
“You say this even though this is your own mother’s event?” Bitty asks, a faux-shocked expression on her face.
“I’m not really surprised,” Ron shrugs, ignoring Harry’s comment. “Mione told me ages ago that you two’ve been running into each other.”
“Here, this!
“Same, kid! That’s a wicked name you got there. Well, look at you, Haz! I’m happy for you. Are you, uh, looking for the regular?” Martin turns to grab two large bottles of Jack Daniels. Draco’s eyebrow lifts as Harry flushes, shaking his head.
With Blaise focusing the majority of his attention on his new girlfriend, Draco takes the time to understand the gravity of what Blaise had meant when he initially begged Draco to tag along. The words “Gryffindors” and “too far gone” and “snake in a den of lions” comes to mind as he watches Finnegan, Thomas, Jordan, Longbottom, one of the Patil sisters, and Weaslette, all sat with several shots in front of them, swaying together as they belt out:
“No, but just sitting there talking about art and stuff, well, it was upsetting for me.”
Draco presses his lips against the side of Harry’s face, thrusting down once more to chase after the remnants of his orgasm. His fingers curl into Harry’s hair as he brokenly whispers, “We promised. We promised.
Potter rolls his eyes. “Do you wanna grab a drink or not?”
Ruined Harry.
The Slytherin laughs. “

“What!” Ginny exclaims, causing Harry to jump in his seat. He looks around nervously, but like he figured, the restaurant is much too crowded and boisterous for anyone to pay them any real attention.
Harry’s hands slide up Draco’s legs.
“There’s that special treatment again,” Draco mocks, but the words sound hollow.
So, I would like to quickly state how I explored consent in this story.
He steps into this room that was once their classroom, their dining room, their escape as his fingers graze the soft silk material of the bed sheets. He smiles at the small Muggle picture Saeed has on his bedside table, a lovely black and white portrait of his friends from Durmstrang. Saeed enjoys Muggle photography and fashions, quite the photographer. Draco loves—loved
“Ugh, stop it, Harry. You’re going to make me cry, too, and I can’t get all blotchy right now,” Draco says weakly, pulling out his wand to Summon a box of Kleenex. “Here.”
. He doesn’t want Ginny to think he is, and more importantly, doesn’t want Draco to.
A handsome man, probably a couple of years out of Hogwarts cracks open the door. His shaggy auburn hair and brown eyes narrow as recognition crosses his face.
Warm arms wrap around him and Draco is pulled against a firm chest.
He passes the new pâtissierie that sells macarons that rival the ones in Montmartre, a little cafe with seating outdoors. Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour has people spilling out the door again, and both WWW and Flourish and Blotts are hosting late-night events. He passes by some other shopkeepers that wave at him, fond smiles on their faces as he hops by.
Draco reaches the first small shelf and pulls out what Draco recognises are a stack of Muggle polaroids.
“The fun is just starting,” she promises, leading Draco into a dark room before helping him sit down.
“I wasn’t,” Tracey says quietly, as Draco responds, “She’s not, but you terribly are.”

“Potter. I don’t think this is a good idea—”
“When?” Harry asks, flipping through the pizza menus.
“Fine, my boy. Do you really want to go out tonight? Do you

Malfoy is statuesque, exuding an allure of confidence he surely lacked two years ago. His posture is impossibly perfect as he tears his face away from his mobile, ordering two macchiatos and paying for the sandwiches tucked under his arm. Harry almost faints as he watches Malfoy pull out a

Harry knows he’s fucked.

Harry takes a step forward before he stops short, straightening himself up and visibly collecting himself. Watching him causes Draco’s stomach to flip. He’s never seen such restraint in Harry before. Harry then takes another careful step towards Draco. And another, until he’s standing next to Draco, staring down at him with a look as if he’s a hallucination that’ll disappear once he brushes his fingers against him.
fabulous,” Draco quips, reaching down to swing Thea into his arms. Her long white blonde hair is pulled up into pigtails today and the smile that graces her face, well, it’s a smile Harry would travel to the end of the world to see.
Harry whimpers. If only he could offer all of that and more to Draco, but he can’t. Harry's still too angry. Too selfish.
And just like that, he lost his head.
“You’re trying to bust my bollocks!” Flint says, swaying on his feet. “Did you hear that I’m joining the Ministry? Magical Games and Sports,” Flint says proudly, his chest puffing up as he plucks a glass of champagne from the tray of a passing waiter. He guzzles half of it down before shooting Draco a shark-like smile. “I say, Malfoy, if you’re interested, I know of an excellent wager pool that’s opening up for the upcoming Quidditch match between Pudd United and the Tarapoto Tree-Skimmers.”
“Yes, lucky
” Theo says, ruffling Millie’s hair. “Don’t be such a spoilsport!”
At Harry.
“Thank you,” he mumbles against him. “How the hell are you getting so good at this?” he asks, lifting his head up. There’s a flush of a toilet from the only stall in the loo and they both freeze. Potter doesn’t remove his arms as an elderly man steps out, shooting them both a smile before washing his hands and quickly exiting the loo.
idea, okay? I told him it would be less pressure,” Draco says, not necessarily lying. Harry may have been the first to show he was adverse to being seen with Draco, but it was Draco who was the first to suggest they date in secret. This wasn’t all on Harry.
. They were always a single entity to Harry.
at Potter? Draco’s eyes roam over him once more, a confused frown gracing his face. Potter removes his glasses to rub at the bridge of his nose before placing them back on. “At first I thought perhaps you were still cross because I asked you to move in with me the first time, but then you eventually agreed. I know you like to do things at your own pace, that’s what I both appreciate and adore about you, Draco.” Potter shakes his head. “But you’re still acting…
“Take me home, Harry.”
He doesn’t know what he’s mourning anymore in these nightmares—the war, his father, his ex, his friends, his own guilt, despondency, or meaninglessness in life. Draco closes his eyes. The pain rips through him as he struggles to draw a breath, tears pushing against the back of his eyelids. He whimpers.
spewing from your mouth? Where’s the party animal I danced on top of literal bars with in Paris?”
“What’s wrong with right now, Malfoy? It’s a bloody perfect time to talk about it, I want them to see this,” he says, his voice trembling with anger. He goes over to one of the open boxes by the bookshelf and pulls out a hot pink book, holding it up. “I just want them to see the reality of what this leads to. You both are so happy, everybody’s so content and before you know it, you’re screaming at each other over who owns—” he peers down at the cover of the book, “—
“I’ve taken the kids to Molly’s. Narcissa will come back soon. Don’t fucking follow us,” Harry hisses before turning on his heel to leave.
This is it. He steels himself for the words that are about to come out of his mouth.
She opens the door.
“So. Was it you? Did you tell him about my pregnancy?”

At the slam of their front door, Draco snaps out of his daze.
Potter pauses and rests his forehead against Draco’s, his gaze unwavering as their eyes lock. One hand holds the back of his neck and Draco briefly relishes the affectionate and familiar touch as Potter’s other hand caresses his cheek, his long neck, then back up to push his fingers through his hair.
“Er, yeah, could you excuse us for a bit?” Harry asks, looking at Draco’s date. “I’d like to talk to Draco privately.” Draco looks like he’s about to spit fire, but Draco’s date, obviously in awe of talking to Harry Potter, sticks his hand out for Harry to shake.
I saw. I’m unable to comment on the extent of injuries.”
“Harry!” he tries one more time, looking back up at Potter. “Harry, please. Let me help you. I want to help you and I know you can help me. I know you want to help me. We can both be safe again. If you’d just let me, Harry. I know you’re scared. I am too!” Draco shouts, the tendril wrapping itself around his neck. He’s not supposed to
When the song ends, and the crowd applauds the brides, and Celestina starts to sing again. “
But when Blaise and Pansy sat him down to ask him to join them back in Britain, well, Draco couldn’t refuse them. He had to return the favour. He missed nothing about Britain and accepting that has made him miserable and unpleasant. Now, after a month back in colourless London, sharing an unnecessarily large flat in Fitzrovia with his friends, and expecting several long, boring months of unemployment, Draco feels as if all the progress he made in Paris is disappearing. Memory is a fickle thing, like holding onto sand—sometimes the good things can slip through the cracks.

“Would it make you feel better if I said I’d never opened myself up to love again? Because I would deserve it if you did,” Draco says quietly, his eyes stinging. “I deserve worse than that, even.”

“No, he didn’t do...say anything. At least not today,” Draco says voice hoarse as he lifts a hand to flush away the gross contents of the toilet. When he does, he shakes Pansy off of him, rising to his feet to head towards the sink, Theo watching him through narrowed eyes. “I...I’m distancing myself from him. It was all a misunderstanding, really.” The misunderstanding being that Harry seems to believe Draco is worthy of his love. “And…” He wants to admit everything that he’s been hiding from them, but he can’t. He refuses to burden his friends with the madness that he’s attracted into his life.

Harry’s eyebrows knit together. “Why didn’t you?”
“I don’t anymore. I don’t know what this is, but I know I want nothing to do with it,” Draco says, edging away from them once more.
And several vividly orange potions that Draco can’t identify.

as Bitty shoots him a coy smile. He draws in a breath to compose himself. “What happened at the WWN?” Draco asks, desperate to change the conversation.
“Kreacher, I’m sorry Harry is so awful to you—”

Potter’s face becomes pinched. “Those nightmares you keep having are about the attack, am I right?" At his silence, Potter's face crumbles. "
“Merlin. What have you done to the Floo, Potter?” Draco asks, eyes narrowing as Potter tosses the smaller chest onto the one sitting next to Pansy. “Careful!” he hisses. Potter doubles over with a rough cough, pounding his sternum with a balled hand. Draco quickly conjures a paper cup, using

to come off, he’s not shallow at all. Either way, he thinks some Christmas décor will brighten the place up. He at least wants the décor up before Ginny gets back from training in a week.
He takes a deep, shuddering breath, and scans the crowd. Now that he’s no longer cloaked in the darkness of the pub, he feels vulnerable in this well-lit space. No one seems particularly interested in what he’s doing, too busy laughing and drinking. He nods to himself and slips through the crowd, eyes downcast, until he makes his way to the edge of the garden with the intimate corner of lush armchairs. To his surprise, there’s a small corner available with three free armchairs, the small table littered with empty glasses and bottles. He quickly makes his way there, taking the middle seat. He pulls out his wand, careful not to move too quickly and give cause to some arsehole to attack Draco. He first Vanishes the clutter on the table with an annoyed tutt before he casts a Disillusionment Charm on himself and the little corner, followed by a modified Repellent Charm he learned from one of the texts in the Malfoy Library when he was young. It had come in handy during the war with Fenrir and other Death Eaters eager to put Draco in his place roaming the halls of the Manor. He didn’t like to use it, wanting to get used to his environment instead of hiding from it. He’ll have to lift it momentarily when he sees Harry approaching.
“Er, well.” Potter grips his pint. “You seem like you need a friend.”
Draco doesn’t move, though, instead noticing Pansy wrapped up in Mia’s arms, the two watching Blaise slip the ring Draco’s been guarding for the last week onto Ginevra’s finger. He watches as Ron and Hermione clap, teary-eyed and beaming. Blaise turns around to grab Draco into a hug, Pansy coming up from behind to throw her arms around both of them. It’s emotional, and perfect, and Draco’s heart has never been so full and so light in his entire life.
“Like what?”
you know?” Draco snaps.
she made such a huge leap, but kept his questions to himself.
“I’m going into the lab early today.”
“I’m sorry I have to do this to you, Healer Malfoy. You ruined a good thing. You ruined my one chance to see my mother again.”
Potter rubs the back of his neck, his body language reading uncomfortable as he looks around the loo.
Harry returns the smile. “Yes. And I’ll keep saying this until I’m blue in the face, Draco, you deserve your second chance, you deserve to be happy, and if you let me, I want to help you get there.”
“Er, okay. Maybe we can have dinner, then?”
Though, it would be a lie if he didn’t admit that Dean’s leaving him still affected him deeply. On some level, he could even agree that maybe the breakup had left him a bit crazy. He had learned so much from Dean –  had learned how to deal with his anxieties about coming out, how to work through the sadness he still experienced post-war, had learned what it felt like to be loved, and what truly mind-blowing sex is. He wanted to feel that safe again with someone. Nowadays he feels anxious, with bouts of depression striking him at inopportune times. He feels unsure about himself all the time now– these feelings only slightly alleviated when he pulls for the night. He wracked his brain day and night to pinpoint exactly when things had gone wrong in the relationship and had come to the conclusion that it was from day one: from that first kiss in the men’s loo. Not because Harry was inexperienced and still reeling from his breakup with Ginny. No. The simple fact was that true love didn’t exist for him. Dean saw in him that he was incapable of being loved, and took what he could from Harry, but it wasn’t enough for him to stay. Everything and anything even relating to love is only a temporary fixture in his life, from his parents on down to his ex-boyfriend. It’s not meant for him and he’s made a promise to himself that he’ll never go looking for it again.
Draco’s never seen Blaise this torn up before, and he can hardly draw in a breath, a ball of pressure in his throat.

“I’m sorry, Draco,” Theo says, his eyes wide and child-like as he takes another step towards Draco’s trembling form.
“That’s what she said, yes. Even spelled it out for me. I looked it up. It’s Greek,” says Healer Walker.
I’d like to take this moment to briefly reiterate some of the elements of consent I explored.

“Yes.”
He had thrown up in the loo at work. Cried himself sick inside his magically-silenced office at the Ministry. Cursed Draco in his head more times than he had tried to soothe him with words aloud.
“Harry works to support our family, Mrs Pumpernickel,” Draco responds, now turning to face his boys. He wrests free the toy they’re both clinging onto and then hoists them up, one at a time, into the car to strap them into their own car seat.
.” He gives a sharp, pained bark of a laughter at her words. She pushes on.

“Welcome to modern day fucking science, Potter! How do you think doctors and scientists are learning how to cure some of the most devastating illnesses on the planet? By using rats and monkeys? Get your head out of your arse. Science can only make breakthroughs when we test our creations on
The week after robbing Potter flies by in a blur. Draco finds that the increased demands of his job distract him from feeling utterly miserable and guilty at having disrespected Harry in such an unfair way. Since breaking into Harry’s, he’s spurned any suggestions from his friends to rob other estates, the rush of excitement and the belief that he was doing some kind of good no longer there for him.
“I agree,” Ginny says, a grin on her face as she shoots an appreciative look at Hermione’s sensible floral-patterned blouse covered bosom.
Draco bites his lower lip as he nods. “I’ve never done this,” he says softly, averting his gaze from Harry’s enquiring one. Draco suddenly feels terribly exposed, as if he’s already standing naked in front of Harry by simply admitting his utter inexperience. He’s so embarrassed and flushed that he’s now unable to stop the words rushing from his mouth—
“Because you think I can be nice?” Draco asks, a weak smile tugging at his lips as he recalls a less complicated time, a night of firsts. Their first night out for drinks. Their first kiss. The first time Draco saw Harry as someone he wants to have in his life.
Draco nods. “Of course. I don’t think we’ll have trouble finding people. We can contact St Mungo’s and some of the local hospitals to enquire about specific patient profiles…”
Draco scoffs. “I’d sooner willingly take a Bat Bogey. I’m clearly going to have words with Blaise tonight. Surrounding myself with this many Gryffindors can’t be good for my personal well-being.”
“Regardless. He could just be
“You...you don’t see him?” Draco pants, his eyes widening.
Milton squints at Draco before briefly biting down on his lower lip. He seems to come to some sort of conclusion because he nods and smiles at Draco. “You’re right. We shouldn’t discuss his details in public. Gedeon mentioned that you voiced some concerns with the direction of the project. I personally had qualms at first, but when Gedeon showed me the results, well, Christ, I cried a bit,” Milton chuckles before slapping Draco on the shoulder once more. “I’m really happy you decided to stay on. Despite Gedeon gloating that you’d be in the lab this morning, he was feeling rather nervous that you’d prove him wrong.”
And still, he tries to shove the thoughts back down, this time taking longer. A sharp pain shoots through his head from the effort, but he powers through until the familiar walls of his Occlumency rises up, encasing the painful memories.
“Perhaps we will try four tablets? That may increase the time you’ll be able to spend on the other side with your wife, Mr Graham.” Milton kneels beside the old man, pushing him onto his back and yanking open his mouth to slip four more tablets under his tongue.
,” she spits. “You can’t even muster the strength to tell him the truth.”
“I have to tell you something, it’s...it’s a secret, and I-I feel awful that I’ve kept it from you for so long, I mean. I should have told you the last time we were in this garden because I knew how I felt about you, but I...I was worried you’d lash out or reject me, I don’t know. But I have to tell you before—before we see where the rest of this night takes us.”

” He blurts out.

anyway?
And Draco is suddenly reminded of a Dementor. A Dementor sucks the joy out of someone, craves a soul. That’s the Dark energy that’s building in Potter, morphing him into something just as insidious.
He makes to move, but once again Harry reaches out for him.
“Er…no, I’m not.”
Draco snorts. “Absolutely not.”
“That’s what she is if she’s forcing you to drag your friends places they don’t want to go, and shouldn’t, for the sake of their mental health!”
Draco hums. “I’m always going to be there for you. You know that, don’t you? You know how much I care about you?”
“Harry,” Draco starts, not meeting his gaze. “I don’t know what you possibly see in me.”
By the time the party is in full swing with a sea of obnoxiously loud red-haired adults and screaming children, Draco’s pretty drunk.
“You were each other’s beard,” Draco says as realisation dawns on him. It’s almost anticlimactic, obtaining this bit of loose ended information.
“But this is my bloody honeymoon!” Draco pouts.
no matter how badly you want to silence that truth. Look at your friends. The extent of what they would do for you in a heartbeat is not such a foreign concept,” Draco says, thinking of Pansy and Blaise. “But I’m right in saying they would do anything for you, uplift you, flatter you, even. They’d sacrifice their own happiness and well-being for you.”
“Draco,” Potter starts. Draco glances down at him in surprise. He doesn’t think he’s heard Potter use his given name before. It causes the flutters in his stomach again, and Draco frowns. Potter has a hand on each armrest, gripping it. “I mean it. I like - I like you.”
“Not bad,” Blaise says quietly. Pansy and Mia both have soft looks on their faces. “Could definitely use a bit of work.”
Harry jerks from out of his grasp, spinning around. “Don’t you
“Are you absolutely daft? Get out of my way,” Malfoy demands as he tries to step around him once more and fails to escape. When Malfoy finds that he won’t stop, Harry notices with a kind of childish glee bubbling in his chest that the other man’s beginning to fume with silent fury.
“Jeremy, I’m sorry, I—” Draco struggles to his feet, his legs trembling. He stumbles into the table, his hand darting out to steady himself.
Draco’s mind begins to whirl—his heart slamming against his ribcage. Blaise has never touched him like this before and he’s so hard, it’s too much.
Pansy twitches, but her laugh is still coy, the one she reserves for her Society gal-pals. Draco decides to take his leave
“Don’t do this,” Harry says, crawling onto the bed to touch him—any part of him. He latches onto his bony hip, trying and failing to turn the creature around, desperate to see a flicker of Draco once more. “Just – just fucking listen to me!” Harry shouts.
Both Draco and Potter look over to see Padma standing in the doorway of the bathroom, wand in hand. Draco doesn’t think he’s ever seen her in anything but her posh skirt suits, pristine lab coat, or colourful Kantha printed sleep robe. Her simple flannel pyjamas and long single braid draped over her shoulder makes her look so much younger than she actually is. Even in the pale moonlight, Draco can discern the exhausted, though concerned expression on her face.
Ron,” Ginny starts, staring at Ron as if he’s grown a second head. “Sometimes I think you’re a few sandwiches short of a picnic, d’you know that?”
“Impatient, are we?” Pansy asks, her voice dripping with apprehension. She lifts her own glass to her cherry red lips for a sip before sitting it down. With a quirked eyebrow, he downs his own drink in one swallow. The Scotch burns an uncomfortable trail down his throat, chased by a dry gag, and warms his entire body. He slides his feet from the table to the floor and makes to pour another helping, his face impassive as he purposely disregards  Pansy’s grimace. “Is there something on your mind, Draco darling?”
Pansy’s grip tightens.
hydrangeas! Do you need any advice—”
Upon seeing the first image, Draco immediately drops them.
Ginny throws her arms around his neck when she opens the door, her shaved head tickling his chin, dressed in a grey crop top that says
, she’ll tell all the fucking neighbours!
“You think that’s you
Draco sits on the edge of the bathtub as Harry carefully undresses him, steam on his back as it fills. Harry adds a few drops of Draught of Peace into the water, and the air is fragrant and sweet, a gentle hum of magic across Draco’s skin and a mouthful of honey as he closes his eyes, relishing the sensations. Draco’s reminded of that first night together, how Harry had carefully removed his shoes and socks. How gentle Harry had handled him, how carefully Harry was when taking him so beautifully, and so very slowly, apart.
“I wasn’t watching!” Harry finally peeks between his fingers and glances over at Draco, who looks like he’s about to faint.
“Harry, not now...we’re going to be late and Teddy is still doing Merlin knows what upstairs…”
Malfoy takes a swig from his glass of prosecco. “We need music,” he suddenly declares.
to get past this? Are you really not going to even consider anything I have to say on the matter?”
“No!” Kreacher screeches, quickly standing upright. The elf now becomes frantic. “Harry Potter is being a good, decent Master, but won’t allow Kreacher to call him Master or care for Mistress Walburga’s portrait! Kreacher is being a good elf for Harry Potter but Harry Potter is not being following the rules—”
You know she made sure I was taken care of? Took out life insurance,” Hannah’s voice cracked.
“No, stop,” he pants, stepping back. Merlin, he wants to kick himself in his own arse for stopping their snog, but he knows better.
Harry nods, withdrawing his hands from Draco’s warm but still stiff body. “Right you are,” he says, quickly picking his cup of tea up for a few rapid sips. Draco hasn’t addressed Teddy directly yet. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Harry groans, annoyed by the portrait and whoever it is at his door. It’s probably Ron and Hermione trying to convince him to come to the
that you could only love in secret, like your Neruda poem,” Draco admits, his face heating up with a blush. “I...it was something that ran through my mind quite a lot and I must admit, coloured my perception on our relationship, as well.”
, check up on him. And for Merlin’s sake don’t tell him that’s what you’re doing.”
“I know. Look, of course I know… There is almost no one on this earth that could deserve Harry. And I’m in the bottom five bloody percentile.”
“What if I did choose to seduce him?”
Harry shrugs, then looks like he regrets it, from the way his jaw clenches and he holds his shoulders stiff after.
Harry’s smile is wry, sad, as far away from a real smile as that stump is from an arm. “They haven’t caught him yet, have they?”
“And,” Pansy adds, “you were planning to present at the Edinburgh conference after this tea, and you seem to have forgotten it entirely.”
Weasley comes towards him, pats him on the shoulder, like he needs to be shuffled out. “You’ve been cooped in this room for a while, I reckon. Best to head home, clear your head.”
“Would I
, wrote the Ministry, and that’s how it feels to Draco now, that he is near catastrophe.
, he’d know someone cared more than anything. He’d thought it would be enough.
Draco squeezes Harry’s hand tighter, wishing he could hold onto it until Harry let go of everything else. They shouldn’t be having this conversation with Harry barely awake. But Draco suddenly understands how it must have felt for Ginny, to love a hero and watch the hero give her up for the good of the world. To ‘keep her safe’, when safety wasn’t what she wanted, or needed, or even got.
As if Draco couldn’t have coped, or something.)
And then in a quick rush before Draco can break every one of his rules about silencing himself in the Auror’s office, Harry appears in the office. He is grasping a portkey in his right hand,

Draco can’t tell Harry that he’s wrong. He overheard one of the juniors yesterday muttering
“Your galleon!” Hermione is shouting at Weasley. “Mine heated up - did yours - can we?”

when awkwardly sat at Harry’s bedside for the allocated ten minutes of sympathy. Which means, of course, that they haven’t yet.
, Harry had insisted on seeing those articles, and Draco thought,
They do not even start with small talk.
“Ron’s just frustrated, Draco,” she says. “We are all are. Though
and then scream.
He doesn’t try sleeping. Dreamless Sleep potion hasn’t worked for him since the overdose, and the alternative is worse. Pepper-up is almost the same as sleep, anyway.
“Pans, I know you think I always worry but-”
He’d hoped he’d be able to speak to Healer Grey, who seemed to understand a little of the situation. Draco knew that if he had a room already prepared, he could quietly floo Harry into it and not cause a fuss. Otherwise Harry refused to come to St Mungo’s for all but the most life-threatening injuries, when he was unconscious and his Aurors brought him unknowingly. Harry hated how the press latched onto it, speculating about how close to death Harry was and how their whole society would fall apart in minutes. (
Harry blinks at the St. Mungo’s lights and Draco dims them for him. Then Harry sits up, and reaches for Draco with his good arm.
at recovery. And he always manages to persuade the healers to let him get away with it. After this,” if there is an after this, but Draco’s not thinking that, not thinking at all, “would you…?”
Teddy takes that moment to run away, so Draco chases him into the living room, catches him, tugs him close. Listens to Teddy’s quick heartbeat. Lets it soothe his own. Draco doesn’t care about the world. He cares for Harry, and Pansy, and this little man.
Pansy has an uncomfortable look on her face that on anyone else he’d call sympathy.
“Draco,” Harry says urgently, turning to face him fully and wincing as he does it.
Harry had split with Ginny to devote himself to the greater good, but here Draco is, holding onto Harry like he might die tomorrow, and Harry is clinging back like Draco is a tether that will keep him sane.
