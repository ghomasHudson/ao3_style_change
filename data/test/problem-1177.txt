‘Yet.’ Still, Harry handed this glasses to Malfoy and sank briefly under the surface. He rose, shaking his wet hair, and felt Malfoy’s hand on his forearm, pulling him deeper in the reeds, further away from the shore.
, the voice inside his head whispers. It’s not like this is forever. Not when Draco proves he can’t be trusted. Not when he betrays Potter so thoroughly.
‘Please hold hands,’ the priestess said, and Harry clasped the hands of his husband-to-be, who looked thoroughly displeased with Harry — as if it’d been
‘I’m mainly here for Dean.’ Harry points at the artist surrounded by a cluster of people under the infamous
In the morning, breakfast was a silent affair. Esther had stayed in bed, and Draco and Harry made their own breakfast, under the watchful eye of Dawn, who darned socks by the window. Draco looked like he hadn’t slept much, but neither of them made any reference to last night’s conversation. Harry’s thoughts now revolved around the risk these two women were taking by letting them stay. He itched to talk to Draco about it, and Dawn gave him the opportunity when she sent them to the forest to gather wood.
Harry took a fortifying sip of his tea. ‘Draco might stay.’ He ignored Draco’s glare and stood. ‘Would it be OK if we go to collect some wood first before we start on the chores?’ They’d collected enough wood to last them a month, but Dawn didn’t object.
‘No,’ she said, vigorously soaping him. It was the most thorough hand-washing Harry had ever witnessed. ‘We’ve got few wands between us as it is. Not many
When he stops, Harry’s speechless. He’s not sure what he can say, but he’s also confident Malfoy will disembowel him if Harry attempts a platitude like the ones he’s had aimed at him. ‘I’m glad you don’t have them any more.’
A bird cawed outside the window in the morning. Harry pulled the cover over his eyes, trying to prolong the lovely dream he’d had, but it dissipated like mist. Pleasant dreams rarely visited him these days and he wished it had lingered. Warmth enveloped him and his stomach rumbled with normal morning hunger rather than that gnawing, empty feeling he’d got used to in the last few months. The sheets smelled stale, but not unpleasantly so. Clean, but unused. He registered another pleasant scent near him, a combination of musk, hair, soap. He turned his head. Malfoy was still asleep.
landed in front of his cup. Draco grabbed it, hoping it’d shed some more light into the place he found himself in.
A feathery sensation tickled Harry awake. He scrunched his face and pressed his cheek to his pillow, hoping for another couple of hours of sleep. The feathery thing tickled him again and, with a low grumble, he brushed it off. His fingers found some resistance, which startled him enough to open his eyes.
The land changed. They entered a forest full of gurgling streams and birds calling in the night. The underbrush caught at his feet making him stumble. Malfoy started sneezing. Hunger made Harry dizzy, which was possibly why he felt that the trees reached out to touch him, to caress his cheek. He heard whispers coming through the woods, soft talk, laughter, even a snippet of a song. He looked at Malfoy, who’d turned towards the sound.
Draco stared at him, but nothing else was forthcoming. ‘What were you expecting?’ he asked in the end.
Draco hasn’t experienced thirst like that in ages, if ever. Getting his hands on Potter became the night’s goal, one he’d royally fucked up, because Potter’s an arsehole.
His eyes surveyed the drawing room again; Lucius, Bellatrix and Narcissa writhing on the floor, their faces contorted in agony, but for Bellatrix’s deranged, ecstatic martyr’s smile.
exchange his home for Slytherdom’s rocky capital, he’d have been furious. ‘I’m sorry you were the one to abandon your life for this alliance. It’s a crappy situation,’ he agreed. ‘But we’re stuck in it, and we should learn to work together. Is there something you like to do? Something you miss from home?’
Her story painted the portrait of a young man, smart enough to recognise what he would be getting himself into, confident enough to not need the dubious glory of the Death Eaters to make a name for himself, and heroic enough to face torture and death in his attempt to aid Harry’s cause. Hermione mentioned secret Order meetings and how Draco had fought his aunt in order to save Hermione from her torture in the Manor, thereby revealing his cover and being tortured himself. ‘I owe you so much,’ she told him, holding his hand in hers, eyes welling up. Draco’s cheeks burned. His Mirror self had made the choices Draco didn’t. The memory of Hermione on the drawing room floor had filled him with revulsion, but he hadn’t found in himself the courage to intervene. Now shame overwhelmed him. These people liked a version of him, but not
‘Talia lives in Sydney; she can’t make it. Lila, her daughter, will be visiting in the summer, though. She’s a
‘They’re old palace coins,’ Harry improvised. ‘Collector's items.’ He added desperately, ‘I promise you they’re worth something. A lot, actually.’
‘When all this is over.’ Draco slanted a sideways look at Harry, who gazed back. Harry's heart pounded under Draco’s examining eyes. He’d stupidly sat way too close and now wished he hadn’t. Draco’s proximity made him uneasy.
Potter’s faced Voldemort; Draco should have expected he’d ignore his warning. He grins now, insolently. ‘Maybe I like that. Maybe I want to be “hurt” by—’
‘Done.’ He meets the man’s eyes in the mirror. He looks almost unrecognisable without the halo of his hair. His cheekbones and his pointy chin stand in sharper relief — a knife of a face, sharp enough to make Harry bleed. He holds Harry’s gaze, who feels hot from his proximity to the man’s body and the smell of his skin, soap and sweat and
Lying in bed, trying to calm himself enough to sleep, Harry rubbed his scar. It’d tingled for most of the day, but no visions had assaulted him. Draco came in and slid under the covers. Long moments passed with them breathing side by side, staring at the ceiling. Draco’s breaths sounded calm. When he spoke, his voice was level. ‘I don’t know why murder keeps surprising me. You’d think I’d be used to it by now.’
He spreads him wider and Draco holds his knees to his chest. Sparks of desire course through Harry at the sight of Draco presenting himself so beautifully open, so wonderfully trusting. Harry's lust feels bottomless, overflowing, infinite, and Harry summons it to give Draco
Malfoy glances at the bar and the other patrons, his voice distant. ‘I work with my hands. Long story.’ He turns and faces Harry, a too-bright smile on his face. ‘But tell me about you. Being an Unspeakable. It must be fascinating.’
Potter slid closer to Draco with an ease that betrayed familiarity. He pressed against his side and said, ‘Well, I’m Harry and you’re Draco.’
, which Harry assumed meant non-Roma. The violinist resumed playing, a wistful melody that filled Harry’s heart with an ineffable melancholy. He should be happy: after over a week wandering in Cornwall wandless and lost, he’d reached Tinworth. His friends were somewhere close. He’d missed them an awful lot; but at the same time, this was an
Draco knows Nariyoshi’s only saying it because the hospital is miles away and they can’t afford long taxi rides. ‘I’ll go get ready then.’
Malfoy’s hands are trembling and he puts them on his lap. ‘I was always helpless. Sometimes I dreamed of being back at home with
Harry didn’t stop. ‘You can call him, you know. Get yourself out of this mess. Just touch that little Dark Mark you have on your arm, and he’ll be here in a jiffy.’
Draco had finally gone insane. This was a hallucination of epic proportions, and he jerked away, only to stumble in the curtains and knock his head on the bed post. Darkness came upon him swiftly.
The fact they were meant to leave soon weighed on everyone’s mind. Harry could see it in the wistfulness in Esther’s smile and Dawn’s examining gaze. It was written all over Draco’s face, a sharp longing to stay in the cottage mixed with the abject terror that he’d be found. The appearance of the owl had shaken them both. It brought with it not just a letter but also a tangible reminder that their world was out there, clamouring for their return.
‘Why did you do it?’ Harry asked gently, no rancour, just… just wanting to know. Draco could be cruel and sharp and quick to take offence, but there was compassion deep down, a spark of decency buried under his old money accent. ‘Why did you bully Neville so much?’
On a round table in the middle of the room stands a covered object. Harry flicks his wand and the black velvet rises to reveal the notorious figurine.
‘It sounds like a scam — especially as the young men claimed to be part of the royal family — however, the gold they offered was one hundred percent real, according to a bank teller.’
. He thrusts his tongue insistently inside the snug heat, a growl escaping his mouth as he tries to reach deep inside Draco, as deep as he can. Draco lets out an astonished, wild sound; he bucks his hips, and Harry has to hold him tight.
Harry bit his lip. ‘I think that perhaps you should stay here.’ He ignored Draco’s astonishment and ploughed on. ‘It’s not safe for you out there. Besides, you’re not heading anywhere in particular. You just need to stay out of sight. This is the best place. I bet Esther would love to have you. You might even learn to vacuum.’ He hastened to make a joke, because Draco’s eyes glinted dangerously.
wet dream, he thinks as he trudges to the shower, the gleaming eyes and sharp nails of Malfoy dancing in his consciousness until the hot water soaks them away.
‘Is it powerful enough to justify a hundred thousand Galleons?’ Draco adds the promised money to his debt, although he hasn’t seen any sign of the former in the room. He’s not surprised. He didn’t come here thinking the Lis would let him go.
Draco reddened. ‘I meant no disrespect…’ And then, almost as if he couldn’t stop himself, he continued obstinately ‘—but my parents said…’
‘I want you so much.’ He wrapped himself over Harry’s wet back and pumped his hips, deep and slow. ‘I want to
Draco stopped, his fingers hovering over Harry’s skin. Harry stayed resolutely still, his heart a wild drum, hoping Draco wouldn’t stop touching him. He yearned for
Draco’s expression was gleeful at seeing Dolohov thoroughly flustered because of a humble Muggle device. Despite the terror, Harry shared his glee. ‘Oops. Missed me,’ he said, when Dolohov’s Accio produced no results. ‘But you get points for effort.’
with.’ He’s so close now that the whole of Draco’s skin burns with barely restrained desire — both his and Potter’s.
The adrenaline from Harry’s close call with the fairies still bubbled in his veins. He felt antsy, and the tension pouring from Draco didn’t help. ‘Where did you learn all this?’ Harry didn’t remember Professor Sprout nor Snape mentioning this.
‘Where?’ Harry walked further into the trees, eyes darting all around, trying to catch a glimpse of Draco. ‘Where
At a second glance, the differences—lots of little details—emerged. It was like those pictures in the children’s section of the
The train chugged along. Harry assumed he wouldn’t get an answer, but eventually Draco spoke. He didn’t meet Harry’s eyes. ‘Because it made me feel good.’
The simple word has an unexpected effect on him. He stares at Potter, startled that he’d deign to plead with Draco. Potter shoves his hands in his jeans’ pockets. He even dressed like a Muggle to come find him.
It’s the last day of June, and Harry walks down the lane from the hospital to the village. He hasn’t told Ginny nor anyone else that he’s been discharged. He’ll take a train to Devon to where Bathilda lives. An old friend of his parents’, Bathilda’s assured Harry he can stay with her at any time and for as long as he wants.
‘Shut up.’ Draco hauls Potter close by his jacket and smashes their lips together. Potter returns the kiss, his hands wrapping hungrily around Draco, squeezing him tight.
that’s making Draco obstinate rather than his reluctance to accept orders. He’d thought, after Voldemort and after Azkaban, that he was free, but here he is, beholden again to someone whose purposes he can’t fathom.
Draco didn’t give him the chance. He smiled and said, ‘I guess it needs some attention too. Would you let me?’
Harry shook his head, feeling as if he’d just woken up from a daze. He clenched the rusty nail Draco had thrust in his palm, the metal digging in the flesh. ‘What just happened?’ he asked Draco — real Draco, flesh and blood Draco, breathing hard, hair in his face, and fury in his eyes.
It was a busy night. Dawn bustled about with her usual efficiency, preparing chicken sandwiches for them and digging an old rucksack out of the attic. Harry and Draco dressed in their Oxfam outfits and gathered their few possessions. Draco retrieved his aunt’s dagger from the back of the drawer he’d hidden it in, and Harry took out all the objects in his purse and gazed at them. The shard of mirror was dark; silent. A reminder of a costly mistake. He lay his broken wand pieces on the duvet, staring at them as if they’d be fixed just because he wanted them to. He put everything back, wore the jacket he’d bought at Oxfam — another costly mistake — and trudged down the stairs, where Esther was waiting for them by the door.
Malfoy leans closer over the stand. ‘Can you talk about your research, or is it something you keep…’ he gives Harry a smooth glance from top to bottom, ‘hidden?’
Harry laughed and pulled him down and he proceeded to show Draco, with his fingers, his mouth and his cock, exactly what their first time was like. They stayed long after night fell, lounging in bed or wrapped in a throw in front of the fire, until starvation made them return to the castle and seek the kitchens.
‘Then you’re awake,’ she shrugged. ‘Are you okay? Harry mentioned something about a stray curse that hit you?’
, son of a Death Eater, who’d taunted Harry for years and who’d willingly joined the most brutal regime Britain had ever known. Harry could picture Mad-Eye Moody rising from the grave to scold him for taking it up with someone who, for all intents and purposes, could well still be a Death Eater.
‘I guess we could—’ Draco froze, his eyes on his left wrist, bare now that the sleeve rode up. He stared at it for long moments, his brain unable to process the sight. Swallowing hard, he ran a finger over the pale skin. The Dark Mark was gone.
Someone else has scribbled below: THE TIME ROOM IS FOR NERDS. I WORK IN THE DEATH ROOM. ELEANOR. The packet is half-empty.
A golden mesh glowed briefly before it sank into their skin. Perhaps Harry’d imagined it. It took him an embarrassing amount of time to get his head together. He breathed heavily, gazing at Draco over him, a pale, sweaty vision of lean muscle and rosy, swollen lips. He stroked Draco’s hair off his face and caressed his cheek, his neck, his chest. Draco leaned in and kissed him with much tenderness before he moved to curl beside him on the cool grass.
However, the deeper into the village they delved, the more Harry relaxed. St Cleer exuded a reassuringly Muggle ambiance, untouched by the magical world; mundane, and safe in its mundanity. They strode down the high street, past the still dark shops and a pub with blooming hanging baskets swinging in the breeze, on their way to the train station. A yawning clerk sold them two single tickets for Falmouth, and Harry led Draco to the right platform. It’d just gone seven.
A shiny car drives up the house and all the patients gather at the windows to gape at it. ‘It’s a Rolls,’ says Finnigan, a match hanging from his lips. ‘My mate down Cork fixes them.’
, standing right there, being thoroughly obnoxious,’ he added, because his heart beat frantically, and Harry’s expression had softened and deepened at the same time.
Draco climbed up and shuffled until he reached the back wall. Harry followed, leaning against the sun-warmed slats beside him. A beetle scuttled across the floor.
Draco smiles faintly and lowers his head a fraction. He kisses Harry almost reverently, and Harry kisses back, his hand rubbing Draco’s head, shorn of the telltale Malfoy hair. He kisses Draco deeper and more insistently, trying to pour into the kiss everything he can’t say in words.
‘Did you fuck me?’ Harry asked in a hoarse voice when they pulled up for air. Draco, impressed though he was by his stamina, feared he’d pass out from lack of oxygen.
For a second, Harry almost reached for the chocolate, but his rage over the events at the Manor took over and he told Malfoy where to shove his chocolate frog. ‘I don’t want anything from you,
Harry bucked his hips furiously, seeking more friction, when abruptly Draco pulled his hand back. Before Harry had time to protest, Draco had sat up, jerked his boxers down, and with a swift movement he hovered over Harry, his eyes asking for something.
It was a dry day, not particularly warm, and ideal for walking. They found a bridge across the Camel, and passed a cluster of cottages, grazing sheep, a group of tourists on a walking tour to Rough Tor, and a party of pixies, which thankfully ignored them in favour of harassing cattle. Soon the fields and pastures gave way to the desolate expanse of the moor. The windswept, vast space filled Harry with trepidation. They’d be completely exposed, unable to hide if anyone tracked them here.
Frantic and defenseless, Harry scrambled behind the nearest tree, Draco on his other side. Through the dark woods, a darker shape appeared. Rookwood. He brandished his wand with one hand and held a limp owl in the other. Harry’s blood chilled at the sight of the dead bird. Draco whispered, ‘Oh, Melor!’
, Aunt dearest. Potter might not have ways to get you off the wall, but I—’ here he lets his eyes turn black and his nails grow sharp, the only Incubus features he has ‘—I can get past your silly charms. I can cut through that canvas like it’s butter.’
Malfoy had divested him of wand and dagger, the latter pointed at his face by a trembling hand. He shivered, his fancy robes too thin for this weather, flapping in the wind. Harry ignored Malfoy’s dagger and tried to stand up, but couldn’t. His forehead still stung and he felt clammy and weak. He dug his fingers into the soil —
Draco finds he can’t breathe. He’s protected this secret with his life, and the only people who knew — a warden in Azkaban and his mother — are both dead.
‘You really like the stuff,’ Harry said, tethering his horse. He took the piece of cheese Draco offered and sat beside him on the grass. ‘Um, what’s got into you?’
Harry flicks a sideways glance at him. ‘Perhaps I missed the masterclass in pretentious art talk that Slytherins gave in their common room.’
The door creaked open and Harry froze. Draco tiptoed in the room and dressed for bed in the dark while Harry, mortified and sporting a magnificent erection, removed his hand from his cock very quietly and carefully, and pretended to be asleep.
He dismissed instantly the possibility of a curse. For one, he’d never heard of a similar spell, and secondly, what kind of curse gave so much pleasure to the victim? If it was a curse, Draco was ready to buy very expensive flowers and/or a house to the caster.
Draco’s insults failed to meet their mark and this bothered him more than he could say. Potter should’ve got angry; he should’ve retaliated with an insult, a hex, a glare. But instead he said, ‘Looking forward to seeing what you write next.’
‘Here, too.’ Draco dragged Harry to him by the jumper and kissed him. ‘Get this off,’ he muttered and pulled at his clothes.
Outside, Malfoy veers down a twisting alley, and Harry follows him, exultant and impatient. When they’re not in sight of the main road, he pushes Malfoy against the wall, catching him by surprise. A faint growl comes from his lips as Harry presses down on him.
‘Can you give my address to your master?’ Harry passed her a paper with his details. He’d no idea what good it’d do, but he was desperate. She stared at him but didn’t take the note. ‘Please?’ Harry insisted.
Harry nodded, trying to suppress the swelling of emotion in his chest. He forced himself to meet Draco’s eyes. ‘I didn’t mean to accuse you earlier… about my friends, and what your aunt did. I didn’t mean to imply it was your fault. I know you tried to help us.’
An hour later, cranky from being turned out from everywhere, they came across an Oxfam in an alley off the high street.
Full of foreboding and fear that he’d be sucked back in, he guided her in front of the Mirror and stepped aside. The only way to activate the Mirror was to face it alone.
Harry finds himself in his bed, naked and aroused. Someone is kissing his stomach. A man. Blond. Talented. His long fingers dig into Harry’s thighs, his tongue circles Harry’s navel with unhurried swipes. The tension from the earlier dream shifts into a different kind and Harry threads his finger through the almost-silver hair of the bloke licking his way down Harry’s body. He’s reached his groin now, his mouth warm on Harry’s skin. Harry’s fucked countless faceless blonds in his dreams, but this one — this dream and this man — feels vivid and solid, unlike any other.
Bob is called to the office; he comes out of it looking furious and miserable. His father looks furious and satisfied as he sweeps out of the hospital, leaving behind tittering nurses.
Sunlight streamed through the curtains they always forgot to shut properly and bathed the bed in translucent ivory tones. Harry buried his face in Draco’s neck, committing the smell of his skin to memory; a talisman to take with him when they would eventually leave this place, and Harry would go back to his mission. If time stopped, this could be Harry’s life: a life of home-cooked meals, kind ladies and verdant, fairy-infested forest. Mundane chores to pass the day and Draco Malfoy in his bed to spend the night. Uncomplicated, unhurried joy. A pang of longing tore through Harry for the life he couldn’t have.
Extricating himself from the bed, he pads out to explore the flat. He’d been too dazed last night to remember much about the old Japanese man who’s currently in the kitchen, another surprise factor in Malfoy’s mystery of a life.
He was certain it was meant to be a joke, a sign of contempt, judging by the stifled laughter from some of them when Granger made the announcement. Let’s all have a laugh at Malfoy writing the last page of the magazine, the one you could rip out without losing any content. Let’s assign to Malfoy the one topic that everyone else was united in: their disdain for horoscopes.
As Draco is well aware, it won’t pass in a minute or even a day unless he’s properly looked after. ‘Coming down with something, I reckon,’ Draco says, trying to force lightness in his voice. He cleans them up with a spell, grabs his clothing from the floor and dresses in a hurry. ‘Put your clothes on and let’s have some dinner upstairs.’
After some tense seconds, Malfoy relaxed and lowered his head. Harry breathed again, but didn’t let go.
The crowd dispersed, everyone going back to their tasks, except for the children who stared with unabashed curiosity as Harry and Draco lingered by the fire, unsure what to do with themselves. Cam spoke to the Animagi, who slunk back into the woods and melted in the darkness. Harry guessed they’d keep watch during the night.
Harry couldn’t last much longer. Grabbing Draco’s waist, Harry raised his hips and buried himself as deep as he could inside Draco, listening to the sweet, broken sounds he made. The pace grew erratic, Harry helplessly descending into a mindless state of pure lust, and fucking,
‘I thought the mere drone of his voice pissed you off.’ Every time Harry visited the prisoner, he came out of the meeting tense and irritable, as if his skin was too tight for his flesh.
Harry nodded. ‘Everyone said he was a great man, and I’d idealised him. The memory shook me. To know he was nothing better than a bully, even for a short period of time.’
Malfoy’s eyes were wide on his face, slick with lakewater. Dolohov kept yelling about what Voldemort promised, threats and rewards mixed with the barking of the dogs and the wind whistling through the reeds, and Harry stared, unblinkingly, at Malfoy’s face.
body; that he was Harry, and not an extension of Voldemort, a feeling that he couldn’t shake off and which terrified him.
Draco bit his lip, but replied honestly. ‘There are four more. Eighteen altogether.’ He glanced up at Harry, who hadn’t stopped tracing the skin on his back. ‘Eighteen presents for every birthday that your family ignored.’
‘Hey,’ he said later, while Harry was getting dressed. ‘Are you allowed to spend the night in my bedroom? Is this an Eighth Year thing? Because in real—’ He stopped before he fucked everything up by talking about trivial things, like reality.
Despite his pleading, Draco’s still holding back. Harry can tell, so he adds a third finger, and is none too gentle about it. Draco whimpers —
Draco said, ‘Unless a witness sees me too, the Death Eaters might speculate — correctly if I might add — that I’m still here. They need to know we’re both in Tinworth.
He dressed for sleep in the dark, climbed under the covers, and exhaled. Harry had never been this close to a boy before, especially a half-naked one. Especially a
Draco chuckled. ‘Of course you won’t. You’ll save us all.’ His tone was slightly mocking, but affectionate rather than cruel.
Harry shook away the reminder that he’d indeed gone for a walk after Draco’s hurried exit. He hunched to lick a nipple, swirling his tongue around the bud. ‘You could’ve…’
It’s fantastic, is what it is. The slap of skin on skin echoes in the dim room, the moans and gasps and hard breathing become louder, and Draco’s relishing in the lushest arse he’s ever had the pleasure of ploughing. Sweat drips down his back, and he shuts his eyes for fear of the telltale black in them alerting Potter of what he is.
Potter takes a deliberate step closer. Awkward and determined is a combination that only works on Potter — but, boy, does it work. Draco walks backwards until his legs meet his worktable. Holding his breath doesn’t stop Potter’s desire from assaulting his senses.
Harry could go to bed. Draco knew how to treat the laceration now, and even if it was hard to reach… well, he’d manage, surely. Still, Harry lingered on the landing, listening to the tap running, thinking that for once he shared the burden with another person; for once, he needn’t carry his guilt alone.
we will. Here,’ Draco drags Harry along the wall in front of the portrait. ‘I want her to see everything.’ He Banishes their clothing upstairs and presses himself on Harry. ‘I was going to suck you, but now I want to give my aunt a better show. Open your legs.’
tempted,’ he admitted eventually. ‘But Dumbledore told me it was dangerous to live in dreams and he was right. Seeing you almost die because of it—no, I don’t think I’d like to visit that place despite—’ He turned to Draco. ‘Do me a favour, though, and don’t tell Ron his brother’s alive in there. Not until the Mirror is safe in the Ministry.’
‘No, I didn’t.’ Her gaze is calculating even as her manner remains friendly. ‘I’d like to make you a proposition. A little job you can do for us in exchange for clearing your debt.’
Draco smiled with satisfaction at whatever torment he read on Harry’s face. He smoothed his white T-shirt and shook his hair out of his eyes. ‘What did you play when you were little? What did you call it? Cops and robbers?’
Draco gazed at the green eyes, the concerned pout, the casual way Potter’s hand rested on his arm, and decided to play along. Whether this was a dream, a stress-induced hallucination or a timeslip, Draco saw no valid reason to kick Potter out of bed.
‘The saving thing wouldn’t work in the Mirror. I tried several times to enter it, but it didn’t work. It only allows entry to the most desperate. I managed to step through only when bringing you home became my most desperate desire. When you were about to die.’
. If Draco accepts her help, Nariyoshi might be saved. But first Draco’ll have to steal the figurine, betraying Potter, who’s shown only kindness to him, and who’ll surely have him arrested. Potter has friends in high places, but Mrs Li has friends in low places, and Draco’s not sure what’s worse.
‘Well, let me pop to Kevin in the bank and check about the gold really quick,’ the shop assistant said. ‘If everything’s in order, I’ll be happy to sell you what you need. I’ll ask Pauline from next door to keep an eye on the shop. Clothing’s at the back.’
‘You best keep yourselves in one piece, got it? Esther don’t need to mourn more people.’ It was Dawn’s way of telling them she cared.
‘Listen to me. When I’m gone, the studio is yours. You know the craft. You’re good at it, talented. Keep the business, if you like.’
When the woman dried off Draco’s hands, she gave him a light, kindly shove. ‘Grab some food, you look starved, off you go,’ and she hauled Harry closer.
One fast swipe, and Draco slashes the portrait near her face. Aunt Walburga yelps in fear. She whimpers when Draco leans close and whispers, ‘A demon who can
‘Yes, and a silver thread connects your body to the blood. But, not to fret,’ he said. ‘If we’re lucky, the house-elves have cleaned up the mess already. Hopefully, no one will realise it’s
Harry gasped, his knees almost buckling. Enveloped by the heat of the fire and the coolness of Draco’s mouth, hot and cold playing on him, Draco’s mouth worked on him sweetly—and expertly. Soft lips sucked at the crown, tonguing the slit, and Harry had to shut his eyes at the onslaught of sensation. Draco licked at the shaft once before he swallowed him back whole, deeper and deeper until Harry felt the tantalising brush of his crown against Draco’s throat. Threading his fingers through Draco’s silky hair, Harry caressed it back from his forehead, entranced with the sight. Draco gazed up, his mouth stretched around Harry’s cock, and smiled. It was a smile that held promise as well as danger, searing hot like an iron pulled from the fire. It was a smile that could bring a grown man to his knees, and so it did.
Draco closed his stinging eyes. His chest tightened at the thought of his parents. Of course they’d wish he were alive; but Draco of all people knew how painful those wishes were. He remembered how much it hurt him to want something he couldn’t change.
), Ron wasn’t Head Boy or Quidditch Captain, and Potter definitely wasn’t in Draco’s bed. Or anywhere near him.
Odd as it had been, it was nothing compared to Draco’s complete personality change the following day.
‘I wonder how you made it through school,’ Draco continued, ignoring him. He put down the picture frame and picked up a candlestick. ‘Not that your grades were anything to write home about, but even so.’
‘I’m going to tell them the good news,’ Hermione said, running ahead. She looked at the Mirror, concentrated and touched it. A bright flash blinded them, and then Hermione ran a hand through her tight curls and turned to leave.
Now he knows Potter’s more than the gilded hero Draco had thought he was. He’s witnessed him terrified and distraught in his night terrors; he’s seen the weight Potter carries. Draco has been privileged to peek inside Potter’s heart and see the cracks that run through him; his broken pieces held together by a thread of gold, Potter’s fiery will. If things were different… Draco’s eyes smart again. If things were different, he’d never have approached Potter, and that would have been the end of it.
The tsunami that had carried Harry from his bathroom to the Office to the Hebrides to this living room pushed him to his knees, and in one fluid movement he hauled Draco down by his shirt and kissed him. A startled, pleased noise escaped Draco’s mouth, before he kissed back, hands sliding in Harry’s hair. Harry clung on Draco, fisting the fabric of his shirt, pressing him close, as close as he could manage until they lost their balance and collapsed on the ground.
Still, sounds of activity from the other boy’s corner made him look. His eyes could just make out the fair hair and the slow movements, as Malfoy unbuttoned his damp robes and winced when he uncovered his hurt shoulder. Harry struggled to make out the injury in the dark until Malfoy stood and walked to the collapsed wall, which let in what little light there was to be found that night. The skin appeared to be torn. A deep scratch, that was all.
Harry noticed the two ladies watching their exchange. ‘He doesn’t have a TV,’ he explained. ‘His family was — religious. A cult, actually.’
It took Harry a moment to get his voice to work. ‘Probably not as a deep. Or they’re newer. In any case, we should treat them, too.’
Harry flinched and Draco froze. He slowly drew his hand back, a wounded expression appearing on his face and melting away just as swiftly. His voice grew cold even as his eyes burned. ‘I’m not contagious.’
Draco’s breathing changed; it sounded shallower and faster as he moved his hand with rather more determination than before. Eyes shut, feigning sleep because it was easier than admitting how much he wanted this, Harry concentrated on the fiery trail of Draco’s touch as his hand stroked Harry’s ribs, his waist, and then,
Her eyes soften. ‘It’s OK, Draco.’ After a brief, poignant pause, she assumes her business-like tone. ‘You’ll need to fill in an application, have a short interview with Fausta, Kingsley’s secretary, and then you may legally talk to Nariyoshi about magic.’ Her smile is encouraging.
a long time. Harry’s not the same as he was back then. It’s not inconceivable that Malfoy might have changed.
When the waitress brought the wine to the stranger, pointing at Harry, the man ran his eyes slowly over him. The uninhibited gaze pleased Harry some more, sending sparks up his spine. The stranger invited him over and Harry sat with him, heart beating fast. He’d never been desperate enough to sleep with a commoner, but tonight the idea of rutting with one of them was like a ‘fuck you’ to his parents, the alliance and the ridiculous marriage he was being forced into.
Draco’s eyes held a challenge and a sort of furious shame. ‘Wouldn’t you, if you were that other kid? He ignored him and looked happy while doing so.’
Draco’s face had frozen in an expression of horror and disgust. Harry shivered at the senseless cruelty. So much hate; so much pain. All because people sought power, believing the best way to find it was to step on others. Harry was weary; with the day’s exertions, the worry about the coming night, the terror that hung over him, day in and day out. A headache pounded against his eyes, blurring his vision.
to it: one of those strange realities that wizards sometimes found themselves in, because of time malfunctioning. He’d read a novel like that once. He’d always assumed it was fiction, but now he was reconsidering.
Bob moves beside him and unties the curtain. It falls over the window seat, covering them from sight. ‘I wish I could take you with me.’
They walked in silence for a while. Draco wrapped his scarf tight against the chilly day. He glanced furtively at Potter several times, unable to stop himself. Sometimes he caught Potter glancing back.
Terry Boot had frozen when he saw Draco waiting for him outside Transfiguration. ‘What do you want?’
realises Rookwood isn’t coming back, he’ll think we killed him or something. He’ll know Rookwood found us here in this area.’ He took a deep breath and let it out. He’d made his decision. ‘I’ll go to Tinworth. As soon as possible. And— I’ll show my face around there.’
Draco didn’t care, not when Potter—Harry?—pressed his body flush against Draco’s and continued kissing him with such intensity that threatened to melt his bones. Harry tasted the same. He kissed the same, plunging his tongue inside Draco’s mouth, pouring everything he had into the kiss, making Draco’s knees buckle. The tightly-wound knot in his chest loosened and unraveled, leaving him dizzy. And still Harry kissed him, his hands everywhere: digging under Draco’s shirt, cupping his arse, running over his back. They ran the danger of suffocating but that didn’t stop them until Draco brushed his growing erection against Harry’s. His moan was as sweet as it had ever been. Draco kissed him on the neck, smelling his skin and his hair, all the while grinding slowly against him, every inch of his body heating up with arousal.
Harry smiled at his playful tone. Whatever mood Draco had entertained on the way home persisted in his eyes, but he seemed determined to make an effort. Harry intertwined his fingers with Draco’s. He had beautiful hands. ‘He was just a fisherman,’ he explained. ‘It thrilled him to sail in stormy weather. Said “it was battling something far more powerful than you” and “knowing you might not make it, but still giving it your all”. He—’ Harry shook his head. ‘You know, I think he might’ve been a little mental.’
So, the stirring inside him when he looked at Malfoy’s lips didn’t surprise him, and he didn’t make a big deal out of it. He knew that as soon as Malfoy woke up and wore his habitual disdain, Harry would go back to disliking him.
The dead were living here, because it was someone in the real world’s deepest desire. Vincent’s whole family had died in the final battle; there was no one to wish him alive. Draco clutched his fork, his eyes stinging with the memory of his former friend. He’d have liked to see him again, even after everything.
‘Harry Potter,’ he replies, imitating the bow. ‘I’m sorry for the inconvenience, I think it’s the flu…’
Dumbledore smiled sadly. ‘Indeed it won’t. It’s too dangerous an artefact to be allowed to remain in contact with the public.’ He surveyed Draco with kindness. ‘Unfortunately, we don’t always get what we want in life.’
, and got up to date with the lurid details of Potter’s life. The early marriage and the swift divorce; his ex-wife’s relationship with Cho Chang of all people; the few dates Potter’s been out with. Mostly women, but also Goldstein from school. Three days later and Draco was none the wiser as to a way into Potter’s life. Visiting Potter in sleep was a last resort.
He pours the soup in a bowl and returns to find Potter in his bed, wearing Draco’s clothes. The sight, although expected, is nonetheless shocking. Potter looks very innocent for someone who could destroy Draco so thoroughly, and Draco hates that life has thrown him in the path of Harry Potter again; he hates that he already feels hungry for him, desirous in a way he isn’t used to, stomach clenching as he watches the man thumb through Draco’s bedside table book, clad in a faded Puma T-shirt.
‘What is it?’ Harry whispered when the door shut, leaving them in darkness pressed against wool coats, but Draco didn’t reply. He just grabbed him and held him tight. Harry wrapped his hands around the slim back, rubbing it in what he hoped was a soothing manner.
This was Dumbledore’s kind of magic, Harry wanted to say. Instead, he watched him. Malfoy’s T-shirt was stuck on his body, every contour of his chest visible under the white fabric. The parka must have weighed a ton when wet. He was shaking.
Draco wore an odd look on his face, something between astonishment, gratitude and disbelief. He cleared his throat. ‘I hope I can repay your kindness one day.’
a witch in stylish black robes exclaims. ‘The purity of the lines, together with the remarkable handling of the light, visually and conceptually contextualise emotion in a way we’ve never seen before. What do you think?’
Dolohov paused. ‘Perhaps they thought we wouldn’t believe it, which means they might actually head that way—’
‘Well, he plays better chess than all of youse. It’s a distraction. I only played with him twice—this week.’ He mumbled the last part.
Dolohov paused, panting with exertion. The three other Death Eaters had fanned out behind him, but they were all ignoring the church. While the dust of the chipped wall was settling, Draco Accioed the walkie-talkie across the square, through the tree branches. They’d hoped no one would see it in the darkness, that they could lead Dolohov on a merry trail, but the rustling leaves gave it away. ‘There!’ The witch cried out, pointing at the oak. ‘Something’s there! At the tree.’
Draco wishes she’d snog her boyfriend and forget about this topic. He glances furtively at Potter, who stares at the middle distance, looking as if his mind is elsewhere.
Draco was well aware of the side he’d shown to Potter and his friends all these years. He wasn’t sure what to say, but they’d arrived at Greenhouse Five.
The light from the window behind the bed bathed Draco in muted grey tones, softening the angles of his face. His eyes didn’t meet Harry’s and he went back to staring at the bed cover. ‘Not one of my finer moments,’ he said, his voice hoarse.
‘Is that what you tell yourself?’ the man sneered. ‘It’s fascinating how delusional you are. Do you see yourself as a revolutionary? Trying to balance the scale between rich and poor?’
. Bring the Malfoy brat so he can die, squealing, in front of Lucius. The Malfoys need to be taken to task. I’ve allowed their incompetence to go unpunished for far too long.’ Fury coursed through his veins at the thought of Potter escaping his grasp again. ‘But don’t speak of this. Pretend their son is coming home.’ This would make it all the more painful for the Malfoys. All the more edifying a lesson.
‘It does,’ Draco panted. ‘It feels so good when you fuck me.’ He kept a stream of encouragement as he moved his hips. ‘That’s perfect, Harry. Look at me, look at how well you fit inside me.’
They hadn’t taken their eyes from the ceiling, as if this conversation didn’t involve them. Perhaps it was easier to talk about sex to the ceiling. Harry attempted to deal with this news as calmly as he could, even though his heart — and cock — swelled with the thrill of
A gasp. ‘Again,’ said Harry, and Draco, kissing him sloppily on the jaw and the corner of his mouth, did it again, fucking him desperately, pumping swiftly. He was starting to lose control again and Harry revelled in it. ‘Faster, Draco, fuck me until the end,’ he rasped nonsensically, and Draco, a wild laugh escaping him and betraying a loss of control, thrust deeper and deeper.
Harry walked closer to the yellow flowers. The small mounds, spaced neatly around the fence, seemed freshly dug. St John’s wort was an unassuming plant, similar to the wildflowers blooming all around them, and Harry couldn’t remember if he’d seen these bushes when they first arrived. ‘They’re for healing, right?’
. Everything circled back to Potter. He’d saved the wandmaker, perhaps with inside help. Voldemort loathed traitors more than anything, and if he had to make an example of the Malfoy brat, then he would. He addressed the kneeling men. ‘The Ichnilato spell is much more reliable. Go back to where you tracked Potter. Malfoy won’t be far. Use any means necessary to see where they might have gone to. Burn the whole county down if you must.
But voices drifted in the air with the melody. Unlike the seductive, almost-familiar whispers of Them, Harry caught snatches of conversations. Something about… laundry.
Granger, eyes widened with surprise, decides to ignore Potter’s ill-timed relationship comment. She addresses Draco. ‘You do realise magic can’t cure him? Transplants are one of the limitations of magical Healing. Organs are complex; quite different to, say, regrowing bones. Still, there are spells that will improve your friend’s quality of life and extend it for years — dialysis is a simple incantation. You’ll need to speak to a Healer about any side effects on Muggle constitutions, but it should make a marked difference on his general well-being.’
Harry nodded and picked the lube up with trembling hands. With infinite care, he breached Draco with two fingers and gasped.
Potter stood furthest from everyone and stared unblinkingly at Draco. Then, he turned on his heel and stormed out. Well, that was that then.
‘This is where we first slept together.’ Draco made his voice flirty; suggestive rather than enquiring.
‘Well. We all make mistakes.’ Malfoy sends a look of unadulterated fury at Harry and pushes off him, disappearing down the shadows at the end of the alley. A crack echoes and he’s gone, leaving Harry dishevelled and cold, his temper melting away, his cock softening, Malfoy’s saliva on his skin cooling in the night air.
‘If you don’t, I’ll ask him out for you,’ Draco threatened, meaning every word. ‘I’ll tell him how long you’ve been wanting to do it and might even mention those
She looked heart-broken. Draco blinked fast as he held her and he murmured something in her ear. She patted his back and whispered something back to him, glancing at Harry. Then, she cupped his face. ‘B’ezrat hashem.’
Malfoy glanced at him in alarm. His eyes fell on Harry’s open palm and the soft, swollen pink tissue where the dagger had nicked him.
‘I heard your voice,’ Harry insisted. ‘I saw you — or well, I thought it was you, but I definitely heard your voice.’
Harry busies himself with his drink for something to do. The reality of who he’s with suggests that this idea — Malfoy and Harry together, having a drink, talking their way into bed — will lead to catastrophe, but it’s not enough to make him leave. That wet dream with Malfoy has left its hooks in him, and he’s nothing if not curious.
Harry’s moans echoed in the steamy room. His knees buckled and Draco followed him as he knelt on the floor, spreading his cheeks again and renewing his attack on his hole. Draco had never done anything similar before so he let Harry’s gasps and shudders guide him. He alternated his thrusts from short jabs to leisurely swirls to deep, slow laps, each creating a symphony of sounds from Harry’s mouth: moans and grunts and
This position had an unfortunate effect on Harry’s groin; a reaction that would prove mortifying if Draco woke now with Harry’s rapidly hardening cock pressed against his arse cheeks. Making as little sound as possible, Harry extricated himself and padded down to the bathroom. Locking himself in, he slid his hand in his boxers and closed his eyes. Merlin, it’d been
‘You were always desperate to have power over me,’ he murmurs. He doesn’t know why he says it, he doesn’t even mean anything by it; he’s aiming to tease more than anything, but Malfoy stiffens.
Harry laughed, his fingers tracing circles on Draco’s belly. ‘We got accosted by fans. It was after the interview you gave to Rita Skeeter and everyone wanted a piece of you, the Silver Hero. We ran through the village, chased by shrieking fans, and found refuge in the Sanctuary. The Shrieking Shack.’
‘Anything I can do?’ Nariyoshi starts to rise, but Draco waves him down. ‘I can handle it, you watch the talentless teens on the telly.’
,’ Rookwood said. ‘There was no sign of you, no sign of spells cast in the area, no signs of habitation. The Dark Lord sent me on a fool’s errand, I thought. And just when I was about to leave, guess what flew through the sky! The Malfoy owl, going where it shouldn’t. The answer fell into my lap, just like that. All I had to do was follow the trajectory.’
Draco might have yelped. His cheeks burned with embarrassment, but, luckily, Harry found it charming and chuckled before he pulled Draco’s shirt up and wrapped his lips around his nipples, causing severe problems in Draco’s ability to think. His brain latched on the last thing he heard: ‘Shrieking Shack is a sanctuary?’
‘There’s loads of stories about the moor,’ Malfoy said as they walked. He rambled about the Arthurian legends associated with it. ‘Some people say Dozmary pool is where Arthur found the Excalibur.’
— orgasming themselves is pleasing but not a prerequisite. It’s a difficult conundrum and one which suggests why his kind is considered cursed in love: the more you please someone, the better you make it for
‘Didn’t you know that?’ Suspicion gathered in Pauline’s eyes and Harry froze, his mind frantically searching for a way to cover the faux-pas.
There was a moment’s silence and then Draco started singing. His voice was low and the song, depressing though it was, was beautiful and mellow. Draco sang it twice — or maybe it was meant to be sung twice, Harry couldn’t know — and by the end of it, Harry teared up. Everything about that day flooded him and spilled from his eyes: the school and the Carrows, the worry over being followed to this cottage, cleaning Draco’s wounds in the bathroom, the looming figure of Voldemort whenever he dared to consider his future. Notes floated between them, words of a mother’s love which continues even after death. Harry let his tears flow, glad for the darkness that hid them. He didn’t want Draco to know that he was so touched; that it was the first time he was sung to. But he wanted to offer something in return, because the lullaby felt like a gift, and so Harry reached under the covers and found Draco’s hand, and held it. He pressed it tight, a thank you in the pressure, and Draco pressed back. It was a real truce brought on by music and memory and longing. Draco let go first, and Harry turned to his side and stared in the darkness until sleep took him.
‘What now?’ Draco glanced at Harry with uncertainty. He looked like a pup fearing he’d get kicked to the curb.
In primary school, Harry had been chased, beaten up, surreptitiously kicked when the teacher wasn’t looking, called names, all because of Dudley. Dudley’s influence, Harry’s ill-fitting school uniform, his isolation: a cocktail that attracted bullies like sugar attracts wasps. At Hogwarts, he’d endured whispers and rumours; the newspaper spreading lies about him — some at Draco’s eager prompting; Draco himself taunting him for being an orphan.
Draco had been staring at the TV with a duster in his hands, horror written over his face. Harry turned to see, and his blood chilled. The local news was on, a reporter with coiffed brown hair speaking to the camera in front of a burnt out shop front. ‘…the tragedy has shaken the local community. Beth Cooper and Pauline Seacole were well-liked by…’
‘I know,’ Draco assured him, eating a piece of cheese. ‘I got a letter this morning from my mother complaining that the bells haven’t rung.’
her, you twat. We…’ Harry swallowed, not sure why he was confiding. The dark made it easier. ‘We just made out a lot.’
‘This is Esther,’ the first woman explained. ‘Dear me, you’re soaked,’ she said, taking their jackets.
‘When I was in—’ Malfoy swallows, then speaks in a rush. ‘I used to dream about being chained in a public place. A bright square. People paraded in front of me and laughed. Or spit at me. You were there — you were always there. Laughing. Pointing. Spitting.’
‘Apology accepted,’ Draco says in the end, and Potter smiles in relief. It seems to mean something to him, to hear these words from Draco. He’s endlessly baffling, this man.
The noise of the pub comes back to Harry when he stops, so absorbed in his memories was he. He looks up to see an expression on Malfoy that’s becoming familiar: something between fury, hunger, and lust.
Harry stroked Draco’s cheek. ‘I don't think you should. Mirror-Draco sounds too virtuous for me,’ he said. ‘I’m in love with
Luna Lovegood was easy to befriend once approached. One mention of the baby thestral and she was happy to follow him to the Forbidden Forest to look for it. Draco also started flying again to train his atrophied muscles. Just with Blaise at first, at the edge of the pitch, but one day Dean and Seamus challenged them to a game, and before long, he and Blaise wiped the floor with them.
Harry tapped the scuffed dark wood of his desk. ‘We’ll wait. The reports say that Lord Lucius's wife dotes on their son. She’s old money, too. Perhaps
who apologises to Draco; the man who’d saved Draco’s life. The man who’d been right in every way Draco had been wrong.
Draco wanted to gorge himself on Harry’s lips. As Harry ground himself against him, one part of Draco’s mind marvelled at the fact that if this was a timeslip,
‘He won’t.’ Harry pressed his knees to his chest and hoped he was right. He shivered under his damp clothes and the constant rumblings from his stomach made him wish he’d accepted the chocolate frog.
‘Yes.’ Harry doubted they’d been Obliviated. No, the Muggles were most likely killed, simply because they happened to be near Harry. He knew he shouldn’t feel responsible for these deaths, but he couldn’t help adding them to the tally that weighed around his heart, constricting it like a chain.
, and Draco kissed him again, his hands running over his back, his strong arms and the round curve of his arse.
‘Why would anyone in their right mind believe people are inferior just because they are a different race? It doesn’t make any sense at all.’
He follows her into what is probably her office, spacious and elegant, with gleaming surfaces, vases of peonies and dark rosewood sofas. A jade chandelier hangs from the ceiling, bright with candles.
Harry heard it too. A violin thrummed from somewhere near, a sorrowful tune suffusing the air with melancholy. Merlin, would they never find any peace?
. An end to his travels with Draco. An end to sharing a bed and waking up next to each other. An end to touching him whenever he wished, as he did now, discreetly slipping his hand in Draco’s. As terrifying as some of their experiences were, he’d miss aspects of these last few days.
Brimming with desire, he bucked his hips experimentally, gratified to hear Harry moan. He did it again and Harry pressed back, grinding his hips slowly and giving open-mouthed kisses to Draco, soft and luxurious. He tugged Draco’s pyjamas off, shifting to allow him to remove them. His jeans followed Draco’s clothing to the floor.
Harry opened his eyes again. He could keep his connection to Voldemort a secret, but what was the point anymore? ‘You-Know-Who is sending two of his Death Eaters to find us.’ Malfoy stifled a horrified gasp. Perhaps he had enough sense to know what that meant. ‘He told your parents he’ll bring you home but, in truth, he’s planning to kill you in front of them. To punish them.’
Harry examined it, his mind refusing to accept he had a malfunctioning wand in his hands. Any last shred of hope he might have still entertained left him: a deep crack ran along the length of it and something silvery-white peeked from inside.
‘I was never one for patience.’ Wrists still pinned to the wall, Harry glances at Malfoy’s collar. ‘Take that off.’ He tries to free his hands, but the other man doesn’t let go.
‘…still unclear how the fire started, Jim. The fire department has ruled out electrical fault, but arson remains a possibility.  The local residents talk of suspicious strangers in town this morning, in
‘I didn’t think we could get more fucked, but it appears I was wrong,’ Malfoy said as they waded out. He held their loaf for inspection. It was soaked and completely disgusting.
A fire roared in the fireplace under an ornate mantelpiece with carved vines. Dormer windows looked over the mountains, but the four-poster bed caught Draco’s attention. He looked at Harry, who unclasped his cloak and left it on an armchair.
‘Come out, come out!’ Rookwood crooned. ‘Come out, and I won’t hurt you. A lot.’ He cackled at his own joke and cast a bright Lumos, dazzling Harry and drenching the woods with light. Draco crouched behind a birch and aimed another spell, but although the spells reached their target, they didn’t seem powerful enough to affect him.
‘If you don’t, the treaty is invalid,’ King James said. ‘Look, I’ve been told he’s not an unattractive man… perhaps a tad cold—’ he paused. ‘Well, maybe a lot cold, but the islanders are like that, I suppose. A result of living on those godforsaken rocks, battered by the ocean.’
‘He’s that type, eh? Is that why you like him so much?’ Esther smiled at Draco’s look of surprise. ‘My youngest was like you two. I’m glad you have each other. People shouldn’t be alone.’
‘I saw the Mirror of Erised when I was eleven,’ Potter broke the silence. ‘I stood in front of it and saw my whole family around me. I left my room every night and stared at the Mirror until Dumbledore found me and removed it. I’m glad I didn’t realise I could enter it. I don’t think I’d have left, then.’
A low mist hung over the land, clinging to the grass, swirling slowly with drifts of wind. Everything felt dreamlike and Harry wondered if he wasn’t, in fact, sleeping: never could he imagine that one day he’d end up stranded in the countryside with Draco Malfoy.
Signs of the magical world emerged gradually as they walked up the hill, hazy details turning sharp, like a distant shore coming closer. First, Harry noticed blooming asphodels under the window of a solitary cottage. Next, a crup barked at rabbits in a field. Soon, they came across a cluster of farmhouses; the gates of some changed colour, flashing red for STRANGER when they passed, while a few lean-tos hovered in the air. The smell of burnt mandrake root wafted from an open window. Harry found himself walking closer to Draco, his eyes darting around, keen on any movement, anything that could spell danger. Beside him, Draco stalked with tense shoulders, his eyes narrowed.
‘I’m good at this,’ he said, somewhat surprised. He picked up his goblet and winked at Draco. ‘I’ve also got a date with one of them.’
‘Are you fighting me, or is this foreplay?’ Rookwood’s dark, cloaked shape drew closer. Harry panted, his sweaty palms clutching the rough bark of the tree he was hiding behind. In this bright light, he’d be spotted as soon as he moved. He turned his head to the right, glancing at Draco who, like him, breathed hard against another tree. Draco gazed back, his expression saying what they both thought: they had to keep going. They had to ensure they drew the Death Eater away from the cottage.
Draco didn’t pry, but his eyes stayed keen on him. Harry heaved a deep breath. ‘Once I happened to see a memory. By accident. It featured my father when he was at school. A couple of years younger than we are now. He bullied this… this person. He did something awful, and I—’
‘They’re not. There have been documented instances of Incubi or Succubi in the past. It’s just been a while since one of them existed,’ Granger says. Her hand often strays at her tummy — Potter’s told him she’s expecting.
‘We used hounds, my Lord. Goyle’s hounds, but they lost the scent of the boy in the lake,’ Rookwood pleaded.  A trickle of blood smeared the corner of his mouth and he wiped it off with his sleeve.
The clock strikes six. He steps outside for a smoke, letting the January night cool his thoughts. It’s a cold evening, cloudless, devoid of beauty. His veins stand blue on his skin, his insides are hollow. He’ll need to dig his robes out and go back to Knockturn Alley to find yet another nameless shag in a club or a cheap rentboy. The Muggles, unfortunately, are unsuitable for feeding. They sense he’s
‘Everything sorted?’ Potter offers Draco a mug that says YULE RETREAT 1993, and some biscuits, possibly Jacob’s.
‘Don’t say that, They’ll hear!’ Draco hissed. He sighed at Harry's uncompehending look. ‘Do you remember learning about faeries?’
The return of the shop assistant spared them as well as her announcement that the coins were pure gold. She rang up their purchases. Harry stuffed their own dirty clothing in a plastic bag, while Malfoy opened the map and inquired about the fastest way to Falmouth.
Draco watches in numb horror as Potter’s hand trembles as he lifts the spoon. He’s worse than he’d thought. ‘Let me do that, or you’ll make a mess.’
Her smile reminds him of her mother’s; the same triumph shines in her eyes. ‘I knew you’d be reasonable. What we want you to do is simple: seduce Harry Potter.’
Harry took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. ‘Why, Hermione? He’s as rich as Croesus, the reports said.’
‘Is your other daughter coming?’ Harry asked. They’d learned by now the names of Esther’s children: Hannah and Talia, and the late Elijah and Levi.
Upon waking the next morning, Harry stared at the ceiling and wondered if he looked different now. He didn’t
A young woman approached them with her friend. ‘Dinner will be ready soon, shukar raklo.’ Her friend giggled as they hurried back to a massive cauldron. A rich, mouth-watering aroma wafted from it, and Harry’s stomach rumbled. They hadn’t eaten since the morning.
Harry’s heart drummed in his chest. He rubbed his palms on his jeans, body tense, getting ready to fight.
‘Ah, don’t fret. We move a lot these days anyhow. These are troubled times.’ He cast a look over them both. ‘Look after yourselves, yeah?’
Climbing the stairs after dinner, Draco headed to the first floor bathroom and Harry paused at the landing. Last night he’d promised Draco he’d help clean his wound again, but Draco shut the door behind him without a backward glance, his stiff back the only indication he was upset.
He lies beside Draco. ‘There are potions for energy draining. For vamps and the like. They can be adapted for our case.’ He strokes Draco’s face, tracing his cheek, his jaw, the corner of his mouth. Draco’s eyes are grey again. ‘Did my orgasm right now feed you?’
Harry meets Malfoy’s heated gaze. Desire crackles at his veins; he’s tempted to drag Malfoy to the nearest dark corner, but, for now, he savours the anticipation of what’ll come after. Hopefully.
of what he was meant to do and prayed to Salazar that he wouldn’t mess it up. With a light shove, he pushed the head in Harry’s arse and gasped.
Draco fed him another piece of cheese. ‘The first time I sampled your local delicacy,’ he said, eating a piece and licking his fingers, ‘was at a tavern at the edge of town. I had a casual encounter, too, dear husband. Someone that I couldn’t take my mind off for days.’
A dry peck on the mouth, and applause rang out in the elaborately decorated temple. Crown Prince Harry of Gryffenland had married Crown Prince Draco of the island kingdom of Slytherdom.
‘Harry…’ Harry’s hands hadn’t stopped stroking his hair, and Draco grinned, his face lit with jubilation. ‘Are you telling me you like my hair this way? Longer?’
And then: Draco. Harry panted with exertion, his fist flying on his prick, as the images unspooled in his mind, one after the other in a frantic succession. He imagined shoving his tongue in Draco’s mouth; Draco smirking before he sucked him off; Draco spreading his legs; long fingers playing with Harry’s balls, an arse that begged to be kneaded, lips parted, eyes closed, skin flushed, Draco naked, Draco half-dressed, Draco on his knees, Draco thrusting inside Harry— ugghh.
‘Why are you standing there? Come here.’ Potter placed the book on the bedside table and patted the duvet beside him.
Draco drew him in a soft kiss. ‘I’ll miss you terribly. My only consolation is that when you return to Port Royal from your journeys, we can have whole days together.’
A light in the distance promised salvation. A farmhouse probably, offering the chance of a dry bed and some food. He picked up his speed, pushing through his fatigue to get there faster.
Harry held her, her frail bones delicate under his hands. ‘Will we see you again?’ she asked. ‘You can always visit.’
He wasn’t sure who he was punishing that way, but accepting Granger’s suggestion would mean acknowledging the insult done to him by assigning him the horoscopes.
‘I’ve got a plan,’ Draco murmurs. He’s made inquiries into going private, the cost, the procedure, the dangers; even considered the black market. He just needs the money. ‘Distract me. Tell me about your work,’ he says, burrowing against Potter’s chest.
‘I was in the Somme,’ Harry volunteers one day. The man hasn’t asked, and he probably doesn’t care. They all have stories like that. The Somme, the Marne, Gallipoli…
‘After what?’ Draco narrowed his eyes at Potter, who was unwilling to continue. ‘After your testimony? After you saved me? Is that what you were going to say?’ His anger rose, hot as the flames that crowded his nightmares. ‘Were you expecting me to fall on my knees in gratitude?’
‘I think so. I assume the people that were similar to real life were those who are happy here. Which means my parents’ deepest desire…’
Draco’s gaze was drawn to the group too, but unlike Harry, he didn’t find the sight of the smiling boy charming. ‘He’s going to lose the magazine,’ he said, his eyes on a short, wiry lad.
Draco is breathing hard. Harry shuffles closer, his hand tight on Draco’s arm. ‘I remembered the way you were so terrified after that first time. I wondered why you’d bring me to your flat if I was contagious with flu, when it could seriously endanger Nariyoshi’s health. Then, Ron mentioned the Incubus rumours. I did some reading. The way you reacted at the pub when Neville called Incubi rapists; the dreams; it all added up.’
). The incident with Potter from a week ago replays in his mind like in an Omniocular. Draco’d guessed correctly that Potter would be at the opening of his friend’s exhibition, and he’d also accurately guessed that a conservative style of dress would intrigue Potter more than a tight-fitting, revealing outfit would. Gryffindors like the chase, and from what Draco had gathered, his choice of attire had worked.
. He sucked the rim hard, provoking a whimper, and reached his hand to touch Harry’s cock. A couple of strokes were enough to send him over the edge, shuddering and calling Draco’s name.
‘We’re in Hogwarts,’ Potter whispered, his lips brushing Draco’s ear. ‘We’re in our Eighth Year, preparing for N.E.W.T.s. It’s an accelerated course, since the start of the school year was delayed, so we’ve been studying like Hermione. It’s February and we have a Transfiguration exam coming up in a week.’
Wooing his iceberg of a husband in six days constituted a challenge, but challenges were what Harry thrived on. He had little success at first; flowers and gifts didn’t thaw Draco’s frosty demeanour, and suggestions to go to the tavern or a spa were met with stone cold refusal. Draco seemed to want to avoid being alone with Harry; he spent most of his time in the war council room and the rest in his bedroom, studying or whatever it was that scholars did and asking for food to be sent in.
Four hours later he revisited that statement: he’d give all the gold in his vault never to do any more chores in his life. The house had to be pristine in preparation for seder, Esther had said, and so they washed and hoovered everywhere, even under the sofa cushions, and they dusted shelves and windowsills and each and every one of the innumerable photo frames Esther had placed on every surface. Dawn bustled in and out with instructions, her hands full of the curtains she’d taken down to wash. Esther kept them company now and again, reminiscing about her life. How, after the war, she’d found work at a London theatre making costumes, and how she fell in love with the young man who did the lighting. The years working backstage, the actors she met, the pranks her first son, Elijah, played on the cast when he was little. ‘And Olivier had to go on stage with flour in his hair!’ She beamed as the memories flowed, one after the other; a life well-lived, even after the horror she’d gone through. She was a tiny woman, and yet so strong. Harry clutched at the hope emanating from her stories with the desperation of a drowning man: the hope that after this dire time, he’d have a chance to live and love, like she did.
He storms out of the house, Apparating as soon as he’s past the barrier, but there’s no solace for him there either. A carved red dragon he’s never seen before flies over his bed, chasing a glowing pearl, which drifts towards Draco as soon as he steps in. When he touches it, words sparkle in the air:
Malfoy sighed and looked at Harry, who tried for an approximation of the truth; they owed it to them, even if it meant being kicked out.
Harry pulled back to look at him in the eye. ‘Can’t say I’ve tasted you to know.’ He paused before adding meaningfully, ‘Yet.’
It was time. Harry took out the walkie-talkies and set one handset down in one corner of the street, diagonally to the pub. With the other held in his clammy hand, he clambered over the church fence, Draco right behind him. An Alohomora allowed them inside the darkened church. Its stone walls held no warmth; Harry rubbed his arms to dispel the chill.
.’ Days of endless walking, without shelter or the means to buy food. Harry put his face in his hands. Fuck, fuck and
‘A lullaby. My mother used to sing it to me when I was little and storms scared me. The sky over the Manor might have been torn by lightning, but as long as she sat by my bed and sang, I felt no fear. It always soothed me.’
Nariyoshi is easy to chat with, and Harry engages him in conversation, trying to piece together the puzzle that is Malfoy’s Muggle life. Mysteries fascinate him; it’s what drew him to work with the Unspeakables, and Malfoy’s never been short of intrigue.
Harry listened. Sound travelled in the wind, but he couldn’t decipher— yes, he heard it then. ‘Dogs?’
, when a big hard cock intruded and took up space in Harry’s body. He urged Draco faster, and Draco propped himself over him, elbows on either side of his face, and snapped his hips forward.
‘Er…’ Harry said, ‘tonight is the seventh night we’ve been married. And— as you know— or maybe you don’t—’
Malfoy graciously extricated himself from the conversation and gathered the bundle of clothing he’d selected, which included — to Harry’s alarm — a purple frilly blouse and a pair of silvery tights. The memory of the wizard Archie in his nightdress at the Quidditch World Cup flashed in Harry's mind and his mouth dried with terror. The lies they’d told stood on shaky ground and would certainly collapse if Malfoy left the changing room in
Harry had to bite his lip harder. ‘If I’d known you were such a natural, I would’ve let you work out the ticket gate yourself.’
And found himself on a windy seaside cliff with Draco Malfoy, both of them wrestling with the wand for a brief moment, until Malfoy released it with a grunt and collapsed on the ground.
Draco picked up another pebble. He rolled it in his hand before he tossed it in the stream. ‘I was never a big fan of hell.’
Silence followed his words, murky and heavy, full of dark moving things. Harry’s blood boiled. The lack of a wand seemed fortuitous, because otherwise he’d Apparate to school straight away, Horcruxes be damned.
The next morning dawned bright and silver. Harry had slept in an east-facing bedroom under a pile of blankets and furs. He found his clothes dry and ironed on a chair, dressed, and went down to breakfast only to find his host absent. The servant muttered that he’s “indisposed”. She hurried Harry through breakfast and then out of the gates where a horse-drawn carriage awaited him.
The fire warmed Harry’s back, and his pulse had finally settled in a sweet, fluttering beat, like a bird trying out its wings. The others would be arriving any minute now, and they had to separate, look professional, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to let go of Draco, not after the yawning abyss of terror he’d felt when the Patronus had brought the news of his abduction. He traced Draco’s neck. ‘What did you want to ask me before? Before I—?’ Had Draco read his emotions on his face?
‘No, you haven’t,’ Draco smiled. Coming closer, he wiped Harry’s forehead and the drops of blood there. ‘Yours?’
‘Sure,’ Harry chimed in. He glanced at the picture of Lady Di on the assistant’s mug and was struck by another desperate idea. ‘I don’t know if you’ve recognised him, but Fenston here is seventeenth in line to the throne.’ He crossed his fingers behind his back, hoping the lady didn’t know the order of succession too well.
‘Don’t send me back,’ Draco said, his mouth trailing Harry’s jaw. ‘I don’t want to have to leave you.’
‘It’s all worked out.’ Harry strokes his back. ‘But you two still should move in. The Lis have ties to the mob. Hell, they
‘That’s it!’ Draco had said when they’d left the train at Falmouth. ‘We don’t have magical resources that could stand against him. But what about Muggle ones?’
Potter blushed and ignored the question. He pointed at the construction equipment by the side of the road. ‘I see someone else is as obsessed with this house as you. Even more, because they actually paid money for it.’ He shook his head. ‘Don’t know who would be crazy enough to want to fix this piece of crap.’
It is. Harry’s sleepy again and relaxed. His eyes flutter shut. The words come out of his mouth without conscious thought.
Harry sipped his drink, his eyes on the man. ‘Are you not from around here? I detect a hint of an accent.’
Galleons. You don’t understand how priceless this is, Mr Malfoy. Besides its powers, its historical significance is immense. Its origin is lost in time, made in the valleys of Shaanxi by witches that could bring down the sky. Kingdoms fought over it; kingdoms which have since crumbled to dust, their names forgotten. But this still exists, and it was found in an old crone’s home after her death in Chippenham of all places!’
‘What’s going on?’ Draco said. Harry didn’t reply. He stared right ahead, still red in the face and breathing hard. Draco suddenly felt fearful, and tried to pull his arm from Harry’s clutch, but Harry didn’t let go.
He might as well have stabbed Draco. ‘Don’t speak.’ He removes his mouth to rest his forehead on Harry’s stomach. ‘Just fuck my mouth. Please.’
He raises his head. ‘Why Harry Potter? Four Unspeakables have been working on this. Why did Potter have to be the mark?’
He and Draco picked fallen branches as they followed the path along an avenue of beech trees. ‘We need to talk,’ Harry told him.
‘This was spectacular,’ Harry whispered, a boneless heap in Draco’s arms. Drops of water from the turned-off shower head punctuated their breathing. Steam curled around the room, wrapping them in warm mist. It could have been a dream.
Potter was still babbling by the time they reached the front steps, and Draco had to stifle a smile, especially as Potter deepened to a beetroot shade. It was endearing to see the Saviour so flustered, and it made Draco’s stomach lurch to know he had this effect on him.
On the other hand, taking him to Shell Cottage was out of the question. No, here was the best place for him. He’d be safe, and when Harry found his friends and had access to a wand, he’d come and cast some protective spells, just in case. And maybe — maybe he could see Draco again.
He stared at the wand in his hands. Harry trailed his finger along the crack, certain that it’d been bigger before. ‘It looks like it’s mending itself,’ he said. ‘That’s odd.’
Two hours later, Harry felt the most miserable he’d ever been in his life. In fact, he realised that every time in his life he thought he’d reached that point, he’d been wrong.
That night, Draco was late to bed again. Harry’s scar ached; closing his eyes dragged him into the mire of the dreaded visions. Voldemort hunted wandmakers in his unceasing — and, so far, futile — effort to find out why the Elder Wand failed to be the exceptional instrument he’d expected. Answers eluded him. His frustration on top of his lieutenants’ failure in apprehending Harry and Draco enraged him, a fury he barely kept under control. He lashed out and punished and struck. Harry struggled against the bleak tide of his visions, trying to cling to the burnished memories of the last couple of days. Kissing Draco. Touching him.
‘What do you remember?’ Potter’s eyes searched Draco’s face, as he settled beside him under the covers.
‘You sound surprised.’ Draco grinned at Harry. He looked lovely, all flushed and sweaty, his damp hair falling on his forehead. ‘Here, I got us a snack.’ Draco pulled out a parcel from his leather bag. ‘Your famous cheddar.’
Harry dragged his mind from a filthy daydream to focus on Draco’s question. ‘I didn’t, not really. I had no friends while I was growing up.’
Draco’s drowning — he’s not sure in what. All he knows is he can’t breathe. ‘I want to make love to you tonight,’ he hears himself say.
Salazar gasped and stroked him harder, his pace matching the abandon in their kisses and caresses, the desperation in the way they clung at each other. Before long, Harry came in Salazar’s fist with a groan, his body shuddering at the explosive orgasm. He leaned his head back against the wall, trying to catch his breath, while Salazar kissed his neck.
‘Bite me,’ he breathed. ‘Just don’t stop fucking me.’ Harry was too close, he’d been too close for ages, and wanted to come.
Potter looked even more worried as he followed Draco in the dim room and called for the nurse. A few moments later, a young woman approached them, tying her dressing gown around her. ‘What seems to be the problem?’
The train stopped at what seemed every Cornish village on the line, tiny stations that were no more than a narrow building in the woods. Commuters and teenagers climbed on board. The morning mist had burned off; in the east, the sea sparkled.
‘Ah yes, the evil Death Eater's wand should only have a core from a Grindylow scale or a Horned Serpent’s fang or— how do you know my wand has a unicorn hair core?’
Their footsteps echoed down dark corridors and past sleeping portraits until they reached the hospital wing. They didn’t speak, although Potter glanced several times at Draco.
Dawn hadn’t broken yet and the night was full of the sounds of the woods outside and the creaks of the old, groaning house. In the half-light of the waning moon, Harry stared transfixed at the blond head in front of him. Draco’d let his hair grow this year. It brushed his ears and covered his eyes and now it fanned on the pillow; liquid silver on blue cotton. Soft strands moved with Harry’s exhales.
‘You won’t die.’ Harry’s voice startled him with its intensity. He wouldn’t be able to bear it if Draco was captured after everything they’d gone through. Despite the fact Draco’d been a bully at school, despite the abominable Mark on his arm, he still didn’t deserve to die like this, a scared seventeen-year-old hunted by his parents’ associates. ‘
Malfoy sat up. Moonlight illuminated his troubled face. ‘That’s different,’ he protested, unwilling to admit it, but years of indoctrination were hard to shake off. ‘Magic is different — it’s an innate quality, not simply a feature like your hair or skin colour; it sets you above Muggles—’
A day after he handed in his assignment, Granger took him aside. ‘Draco,’ she said, insisting on using his first name for Merlin knows what reason, ‘you did a fantastic job with the horoscopes. I was wondering if you’d like to work on an editorial piece next month.’
Uncertain of his reception but determined to make the effort, Draco had ambled around the gallery for a while, examining Potter from a distance. Unlike his dream self, there’d been no trace of pain or hesitation on Potter’s face. Draco found it hard to ignore the magnetism of his presence; the charm Potter has always had that makes people gravitate towards him, hungry for a scrap of attention, wishing for a chance to touch him — even if it costs them the world.
The two ladies stared at Malfoy with surprise. The cult excuse meant they could probably get away with him not knowing what a soap opera was or how to turn on the lights (Harry had to show him), but ignorance about something huge like World War II raised suspicions. He couldn’t even suggest that Draco had been knocked in the head since he’d been lucid all day. He wished he’d mentioned it last night. It’d save them a lot of bother, and Draco wouldn’t have to act too hard.
idiot. You made friends with all the losers in the school,’ Draco said. ‘You rejected me on day one—’

By the time they reached the town, Harry was famished. His examination of his pockets had resulted in one positive discovery: a crumpled tenner, courtesy of the Snatchers’ ignorance of Muggle money. Harry stopped in front of a bakery, practically drooling at the shop window with the pastries and the rolls, and Malfoy paused next to him.
In the meantime, Potter received an owl every day with a present: a shirt, new quills, Honeydukes chocolate. Today he tore open an envelope, which contained tickets to a Chudley Cannons match. Beside him Weasley hollered. He grabbed the tickets and waved them in the air, while Potter glanced around the Hall as if the mystery buyer was there.
Draco accepted it, his mind flashing back to Harry fucking him against the wall in the Quidditch broom shed. ‘Terrible,’ he nodded. He lowered his head and sipped some tea, hoping his blush didn’t betray him.
The house stood there, innocently slumbering, as if nothing had happened. But everything had changed. Harry sat on the ground, facing the forest, his back against the fence. Draco settled next to him, his thigh and arm touching Harry’s, both relishing each other’s warmth after the harrowing incident. They hadn’t uttered it out loud, but they remained there, in the cool spring night, sentinels against the enemy. Rookwood could have lived. He could come back.
, Harry wrapped his hand around Draco's neck, rising to finally capture Draco's pretty mouth with his. Their kiss turned messy, filthy, sloppy even, as Harry opened his legs wider, feeling Draco’s balls rub against his, pleasure flooding his veins. He wrapped his legs around Draco’s hips and squeezed him tight, craving more pressure, more friction. More
It was as if everyone had decided to trust him with their most precious secrets. His past self (Slytherin, Malfoy), trained from a young age to look for ways to use a situation to his profit, would have been delighted at all the opportunities for blackmail he’d have if he returned to the real world. His father certainly would be over the moon. However, every moment Draco spent in this world of laughter, a world where people’s main source of anxiety was the amount of coursework piled on them, resolved his decision to stay put. He wasn’t going anywhere. In fact, he much preferred this version of Potter.
