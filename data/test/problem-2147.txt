When his surroundings regain their focus around him, Harry is once again kneeling on the floor and this time he feels like his brain itself has been battered and brusied from someone trying to physically remove it from his skull and his chest is tight, his lungs squeezed together and he has to gasp for breath.
”It’s just…” Harry mumbles. ”Thinking about what it would have been like… Finally getting back here and…”
Climbing to his feet, he turns around to see a very exhausted-looking wizard look up from a large gold watch and stoop down to pluck the tea cup from the ground and toss it in a large box of other used Portkeys. Another wizard, just as tired-looking as the first, if not more so, scribbles something on roll of parchment.
She waves Harry in and he quickly stumbles after her into the back of the shop where a boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blonde hair is standing on a footstool while a second witch is pinning up his long black robes.
He knows Lucius always wanted Draco to attend Durmstrang, but that Narcissa had put her foot down and insisted he attend Hogwarts instead, because she wanted him closer to home… but what if the witch has now changed her mind? What if she plans to make the move to France permanent, to get Draco out of harm’s way now that Voldemort is returned?
Harry’s mind whispers — is nowhere to be seen. Wormtail mutters incantations under his breath, staring at the bubbling contents of the cauldron with a look of contained panic in his eyes.
Draco leads him up to the castle and continues to pull on his arm insistently, all the way up to the fifth floor and every time Harry tries to ask him where they’re going — about once every floor — he just shoots him a secretive smirk and just shakes his head.
The oak front doors open and the Durmstrang students march inside lead by Karkaroff, looking as smarmy as ever in his fur-lined robes. Harry’s eyes immediately dart to Krum at the front of the group. He, like all the other boys from Durmstrang, is wearing blood red robes lined with dark brown fur, a stark contrast to the light blue robes of the petite girl hanging off his arm. Harry doesn’t recognise her and thinks she must be a Beauxbatons…
”Well… actually, I was wondering if you have a date for the Yule Ball yet, because if not I was thinking maybe… maybe you and I could go together…
Edging along the window, Harry manages to get a glimpse of a familiar mop of golden blonde hair and a pair of grinning blood red lips.
Harry gives Draco a questioning look, wondering if he will leave. But the other boy just hangs back when Moody tells them all to line up, watching warily as one by one their classmates are put under the Imperius and made to do the oddest things, like imitating animals or performing amazing tricks or acrobatics they would never normally be able to do.
”I can’t believe you didn’t tell them sooner!” Pansy says, practically bouncing with excitement. ”We could have been rid of her ages ago!”
Mr Ollivander measures Harry’s right arm from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and finally around his head. Harry peers curiously at Remus, who just gives him an encouraging wink and sits back down on the spindly chair.
After breakfast Sirius hugs Harry good bye and leaves for work and Harry spends the rest of the morning helping Remus with the house work and then retires to his bedroom to pack his things, while his daddy sits down to do some writing.
”Harry … Shhh … it’s okay … look at me”, the man says softly, gently prying Harry’s arms down from around his neck and peering into his face. ”You’re okay, it’s okay … but we have to get you out of here… you can tell me what happened when we get home, okay?”
”There!” someone cries, pointing towards the Dark Forest and everyone’s eyes flit in the same direction.
The others exchange uncomfortable looks, but no-one says anything else. The last remnants of sleepiness has been stomped out of the group, but the mood around the table is far from uplifting. If anything, Harry feels like someone has put a blanket soaked with ice-cold water over his shoulders, weighing him down and chilling him to the bone at the same time.
”Come to think about it… I think I’ve seen noses like yours down the village…” Gaunt says, his lips curling in distaste.
”So…” Harry finishes lamely. ”We think maybe there’s some sort of connection between us, that they’re not just dreams…”
”Well…” Professor Snape says and shifts his weight a little awkwardly, before turning back to the door. ”I’ll leave you to… Yes. I’ll see you at the feast —”
Stumbling out of the fireplace at home, Harry remains standing in the middle of the room for a moment. He looks around at the familiar, bulging bookcases and snoozing portraits, the worn old sofa and the coffee table, the row of framed photographs on top of the mantlepiece… Home… He wonders if Draco and Narcissa are home at the Manor yet… Unless… Unless… Harry shivers and hugs himself. No, he tells himself sternly. Draco said he’d be fine, Drcao is fine. They’re both home and safe.
Something glints in his peripheral and, acting on pure instinct, Harry throws himself flat along his broomstick and hurtles forward into a dive… it’s only when he’s halfway across the Stadium that he realises that he’s not in pursuit of the Snitch at all, but his teammate Montague’s wristwatch.
”Winky convinced my father to let me go. They told everyone she was saving a seat for him in the Top Box, but in actuality I was sitting there, under the Invisibility Cloak… imagine my surprise and delight, when Harry Potter himself sat down in the seat next to me… I even managed to lift the wand from his pocket… you see, I’d been growing stronger for months, able to throw off my father’s Imperius Curse without him or Winky knowing… I had no plan, then… I just saw the wand and knew I wanted it, I hadn’t held a wand in my hand since before I was sent to Azkaban… but then, as we were walking back to the tent, we heard the Death Eaters, the cowards who’d evaded Azkaban… not enslaved as I was, but free to seek our master, yet they did not… rage filled me… I conjured the Dark Mark… the filthy traitors ran as soon as they saw it!”
And then, before the other boy can say anything else or attempt to accost his person, Harry slips out the door.
Harry throws her a withering look of warning, but he might not have bothered because Slughorn seems to far gone already to reflect on the absurdity of it all. He’s shaking his head and staring unseeingly into his empty glass, mumbling something about
Harry shivers as the cold, night air hits him. Then he spots a lantern bobbing along towards them and a loud, booming voice calls out, ”Firs’-years! Firs’-years over here! Gather aroun’ ye lot!”
Draco’s eyes, impossible big and shiny, staring back at him. Wary. Almost scared. Then the idea, exploding in Harry’s chest, sinking heavy into his stomach, anchoring him, steeling him.
”Oh — right”, Harry mutters. ”Well, I don’t mind if you have a seat… Hey, do your family know you’re here?”
”Maybe you want to save it for next year then, Harry…” Remus says with a teasing smile in his husband’s direction, but he clearly senses that the other man is genuinely worried Harry won’t like the jumper, because he immediately reaches out across the back of Harry’s shoulders and combs his fingers through the man’s hair. ”I’m only joking. I think it’s great and Harry will look really handsome in it…”
”So? I’m bored here, all alone…” Harry grouses, even though it’s not strictly true and he feels kind of bad for making his daddy feel guilty.
Just a heads up, everyone: I'm in Sweden for the month of August and super busy (I have a writing deadline plus working as an actress on a week long writing lab) which means this might be the last update in a while. (But maybe not!)
He holds up his other hand and smiles thinly. Draco’s eyes flicker up to meet his for half a second, before focusing on his hand again, his lips never even twitching. Harry sighs.
The twins’ faces fall and their shoulders slump, but they quickly shake off the disappointment again and begin to sell him on something called
”We must be the first ones here…” Sirius mutters, glancing around him furtively. ”Thought the Weasleys would have been here already…”
do you have to talk to the Gryffindorks though? You’re not really friends with them, why can’t you just…” he shakes his head and sighs again, this time in frustration. ”I do love that about you, but I kind of hate it too. If that makes sense.”
The red of Harry’s Disarming Charm and the green of Voldemort’s Killing Curse both begin to fade and soon their wands are connected by one narrow beam of golden light… Suddenly, Harry feels his feet lift from the ground and before he knows it, he is soaring into the air… Voldemort too, is suspended above the ground, gripping his own wand with both hands and staring in astonishment at the golden beam of light still connecting their wands… they begin to drift away from Tom Riddle Senior’s grave and the circle of Death Eaters and land on a patch of grass away from the gravestones.
”Good. That’s good. I don’t think I’ve seen her since… When was it, Moony? My dear mother’s funeral, was it —?”
The truth is that out of all the pamphlets he’s glanced at during the weekend, none of the professions seem all that exciting to him. When he tries to picture the future life he’d like to have, he can picture the house he’d like to live in perfectly, and he can picture Draco by his side, maybe even a kid or two… And his dads of course, visiting them on the weekends and celebrating all the major holidays with them like one big family… But no job really comes to mind.
”Well, have you had a look at the career advice pamphlets?” Professor Snape asks in a long-suffering voice. ”There are plenty of professions that allow you to
Their friends are all waiting for them in the Common Room, and rather anxiously if the collective sigh of relief at the sight of them returning is anything to go by, Harry is amused to note.
Longbottom seems to have had the same idea, because he nearly trips over his own feet in his hurry to dive through the door and accidentally bumps sideways into Draco, who immediately shoves him away with a disgusted snarl —
I could teach you — if you want”, Malfoy says a little more loudly, looking none too pleased about it.
”It was found on the body, yes”, Dawlish says, squinting suspiciously at the other man. ”Why do you ask?”
The Slytherin Common Room is completely deserted, but Harry can hear muffled voices coming from one of the girls’ dormitories. The boys’ side seems quiet though and Harry is immensely grateful for that. This is just what he needs right now: peace and quiet — and a bed.
”I’m just going to have a seat over here and watch you die, Harry”, Riddle says and lowers himself to the ground and leaning back aganist his arms, as if he was talking about sun bathing or something. ”Take your time. I’m in no hurry.”
“Now really, that’s enough… I’m afraid that’s detention for you, young man. Oh yes, ‘fraid so old chap!”
A small creatures suddenly comes running across the floor and throws herself on top of Barty Crouch Junior’s chest and wails, ”You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed master’s son!”
Finishing up his porridge, Harry reaches for the coffee caraffe and refills his cup while he waits for Draco to finish eating, but it only takes him a few minutes longer than Harry and the others. It’s amazing to see the change, Harry thinks. Less than a year ago it would take Draco at least an hour to finish his breakfast and almost two hours to pick his way through the larger meals at lunch and dinner. Now he’s almost as fast as the rest of them and he probably would be
Harry chuckles breathlessly and just to reassure the blonde, he reaches out and gently combs his fingers through what silky strands he can reach.
— and even when he does try to take a break from his studies, it’s impossible to relax because Draco is constantly next to him, muttering to himself or practising his wand movements.
But then, another memory surfaces to the front of Harry’s mind. The teenager Tom Riddle, preserved in the Diary that Harry discovered in Second Year, his handsome features contorting in malice and anger as he told Harry about his time at the school, about opening the Chamber of Secrets to send the Basilisk after the muggleborns at the school, but how Dumbledore kept an annoyingly close eye on him, making it nearly impossible to
He grabs Draco’s book from him and tears the rope off. The book immediately tries to clamp down its jaws on his hand, but Hagrid smoothly moves it away and drags the forefinger down the book’s spine. It shivers and then falls open.
"Harry!" came an excited voice as he swallowed the last bite of his sandwich, and he turned to find a grinning Scorpius running through the door. Laughing, he bent down and scooped the little boy up in his arms, giving him a tight hug.
“Scorp, don’t you think you’re being a little overbearing? The poor guy’s probably getting tired of eating unseasoned food every day.”
Harry hummed appreciatively, popping the rest of it into his mouth. She offered him another one, and he happily accepted.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’ve been really shitty about all this. You were right. You deserved to know more, growing up.”
He bit his tongue as the awkwardness around the table intensified. He glanced carefully at his dad, who looked like he was thinking hard. Casting around for a change in subject, Scorpius looked down at his plate.
“That’s a big stereotype, assuming that only girls are neat, and all just to avoid my question. Who is that letter from?”
Harry looked pointedly at her colleague at the far end of the counter, who was handing another client a tray with chips on it, but she remained silent.
“Thank you for this,” she said, raising her glass toward him. “It’s been a long time since I’ve had such a good wine. I never buy the nicer ones for myself because it’s so hard to find the opportunity to enjoy it when you’re raising a kid as energetic as Teddy.”
“The quality of the food is probably also rubbish. I’m sure Grandpa here will be sick tomorrow from something he ate here.”
“I asked if you’d want to come to the pub with my friends. We all meet up once a week at the Leaky Cauldron. You’re right, I shouldn’t keep you a secret, and the pub will just be the easiest way to meet everyone at once.”
Draco snorted. “So the rumours are true, then? That you and Weasley would have failed miserably if it wasn’t for Granger?”
them, and if Draco was to be believed, they loved him back. Taking a deep breath, he leaned forward, toward Draco.
Scorpius was technically right—Harry had gotten the idea from his stay in Hassan’s house months prior—and so Harry simply sighed and conceded the point.
“Then set one up,” Teddy suggested. “We’ll join, and there’s never a shortage of Weasleys either, especially when it comes to Quidditch.”
Harry watched silently as Malfoy marched along the black tiles. For a moment, Harry wondered if he was going down to the courtrooms on Level Ten, but there were no Wizengamot hearings scheduled for the day. In the few times he’d skulked around out here, however, he’d noticed that everyone who wasn’t wearing the typical navy blue Unspeakable robes had turned and made their way down those stairs. He watched, surprised, as the black door leading into the round room swung open at Malfoy’s approach. That meant that Malfoy had some business with the department—Harry had tried slipping through that door enough times to know how it worked.
Harry was still seething, but he could feel a little curiosity creeping in. He didn’t want to admit it, but Teddy may have had a point—he was angry at Draco for lying to him, for betraying him. The tiny, rational part of his brain had registered what Teddy said. Draco had been blackmailed, as Harry had imagined a million times over, and probably didn’t deserve life in Azkaban for that. Deciding he needed more information, he flopped gracelessly onto the opposite sofa and glared at Teddy, arms folded across his chest. Teddy started to speak again, clearly understanding what Harry wanted.
Draco nodded. “That’s true, and I understand that. But you know how independent I am. Sometimes it just gets a bit much to have him hovering over every action I take. I’d like to be able to walk to the loo without him trying to guide me there.”
," Corner scoffed. "It's all bullshit of course. I doubt it's a real thing. It's supposed to mean that he doesn't want sex, or some similar bullshit. But what 25 year old man doesn't want sex? I think he's just saying it for more attention."
"So now what?" she asked, tears in her eyes. Harry hated that he was hurting her, but he couldn't stay married to her. He barely knew her. "We married now Harree. Even if you didn't know. I still come home with you."
“What are you thinking about?” Bryan asked, sitting back down next to Harry, a large plate in his hands. Harry eyed what looked like a waffle topped with four scoops of ice cream, two slices of mousse cake, a bunch of fruits, five swirls of whipped cream, and what looked like an entire tonne of sprinkles. There were also three slices of pie on the side of his plate.
Harry nodded, sitting down at the top of the slide and crossing his arms the way the poster instructed.
“How is it that no one knows how to get ahold of Malfoy?” Potter demanded. The poor receptionist bit her lip.
As they finished their coffees and parted ways for the night, Harry started to wonder what had really come from the last two dates. It seemed he was no closer to figuring out what Draco even did, let alone how he might be connected to the Department of Mysteries. Every time he tried to ask a question, he got caught up in Draco’s obvious passion for his work, and any hope of uncovering his plans got side tracked. It was starting to seem like a futile effort.
about this new perfume. A strange feeling of familiarity, even though it was as unique as perfumes go. Yet another smell that Harry had never picked up before.
Harry was still pacing when Teddy popped in through the floo. Harry took one look at his face and could tell that his godson knew everything that had been going on.
“Don’t let me finish all of this,” Malfoy said, indicating the dessert that Harry had yet to try. “And hospital staff tend to know more than people think. The Aurors usually interview patients while they’re still in the hospital—we overhear things. We just don’t tell the world because we’re good at maintaining patient confidentiality.”
Harry laughed at the image of Draco trying to shake Scorpius off in this small flat. It was true that Draco had always been fiercely independent. He’d continued to work after they had gotten married, despite Harry’s insistence that he didn’t need to, and he’d also been adamant about sharing the costs of things around the house.
Harry shrugged. “He knew you’d been arrested, but I refused to talk about why. I think I didn’t want to have to face reality, and I knew talking to Scorp about it would make it seem so much more real. I didn’t realise at that time how much I was hurting him.”
“You look confused,” Head Auror Clearwater said as she pulled up a chair in front of Scorpius. He sat back in his chair, his mind still racing with unanswered questions.
As much as Harry loved and appreciated (it took a lot of trust before Draco would laugh so freely, without all the facade and ill-intended snark) his laugh, he really wanted—needed—to know the answer. So, he let himself a tiny smile before putting back his strict mask, making sure Draco didn't see his slip-up.
“He was very careful, you see, when he was admitting his affair. Always said ‘they’. Never ‘she.’ That tipped me off straight away.” Ginny threads her wand through her fingers, drawing Malfoy’s eyes. “And then you turn up on our doorstep after he’s ended the affair, looking like some kicked Krup. So what am I supposed to think?”
“I prefer ‘the other woman’, actually,” Ginny says importantly, which only makes her giggle more. “You’ve got to lean into it, Draco. If you think about it too hard it’ll all start to unravel.”
“You’d better come in, then,” she says, walking past him and waving her wand at the door, disabling the inner wards. She doesn’t turn to see if Malfoy follows her into the house, fearing that if she does, the calm moment will be broken, like Odysseus in Hades.
looking after three kids. I still don’t know how my mum did it,” she adds with a laugh. The idea of seven kids made her want to curl up into a ball and never come out again. “And Harry. The only thing that ever made sense to Harry was kids. He’s brash and impatient and hot-tempered with everything and anything else, but kids he
“He was just so guilty, all the time. Spending all the time he could with Lily, promising to take us on weekend trips as soon he could get the time off work – it was like it was ten years ago, and it was
“And yes, he has a wife who loves him, but he doesn’t love.” The thought makes her throat constrict, makes her shut her eyes tightly, but she breathes through it. “And our kids are not perfect. They’re so unbelievably fragile and Harry will always blame himself for it.”
Ginny watches him, waiting for any flash of emotion. Malfoy stays silent. “Harry hadn’t even given Ron a cover story. He said there weren’t any big cases, and none that would warrant weekend overtime. So I put Lily to bed and waited for Harry, all Sunday evening. I think it was past midnight by the time he got back?” She laughs again, smacking her hand theatrically against her forehead, “But of course, you know that already.
“Right,” he says, staring down at his drink, “right.” He downs the glass. “May I?” he asks, and Ginny waves a hand. If he’s going to have her husband, he might as well have her whiskey as well.
“Close, but no,” a sardonic voice says from below. She manoeuvres the majority of her shopping onto her hip so she can peer at the man. His platinum hair looks limp around his face and he’s picking at the sleeve of his robe. She sighs.
kids, you know? There was always so much pressure.” She sighs, resting her chin on her hand. She knows Malfoy understands – Scorpius has been through just the same thing, but worse, in a way; the pressure to
“What are we going to do about this?” she asks the room, not really expecting an answer. Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Malfoy raise an eyebrow.
He stares at her for a moment, looking torn to the point of breaking, and sighs heavily. “Fuck!” he exhales. “Fuck. Yes, alright, I love him. Are you happy now?”
Malfoy splutters, a blush spreading over his pale features. It almost makes Ginny want to laugh. Almost.
“I haven’t been a Weasley in a long time,” she counters, but she knows, secretly, that she has never stopped thinking of herself as such. “So,” she says sharply, clasping her hands together. “What are we going to do about this?”
Ginny hums, swirling her own drink around her glass. “I could argue that falling for your male ex-nemesis would be a fair reason.”
Ginny smiles, knowing he’s trying to hide his interest. “No. He would’ve been a professor.” Malfoy raises an eyebrow, and she huffs out a laugh. “No, really. He was a natural teacher. When he taught the DA – it was a time he was really
Ginny smiles softly. “Of course they are, Draco.” She thinks of way Harry strokes her hair, kisses the top of her head. Always asks if it’s okay before he touches her. How he looks at her with awe, with reverence, with kindness. It’s the same way he looks at their children. He loves her; they’re
Then the amicable separation, Harry moving into Godric’s Hollow, the house they’d planned for their retirement, and Ginny staying here, in their family’s home, close to Lily’s school, close to her parents, and Ron and Hermione.
“Harry’s not like that.” Malfoy scoffs, but Ginny continues, “he’s never been like that. He doesn’t – feel, that way, about people. He can’t separate sexual and romantic.” She smiles sadly. “You know, I asked him once? I asked what fantasies he had, about other people. He looked at me like I was crazy, like I suspected him of cheating.” She snorts at the irony. “I told him I’ve fantasied about every Quidditch player I’ve ever played against. But he – he really doesn’t think that way. He only loves.”
Malfoy’s eyes are wide. He licks his lips as though he doesn’t know what to say, but that can’t be right, because Malfoy
She rubs at her eyes, standing at the bottom of the stairs and tries to smile at him. “We’ll talk in the morning, Harry.” He opens his mouth as if to argue and she pins him with a glare. “Tomorrow.” She turns fully then and looks at Draco. “Look after him, will you?”
Malfoy scratches at his forearm and shakes his head. “That’s not true.” His face turns cold, guarded. “You just don’t want to think about it, right? You don’t want to think of your lovely, straight, war-hero husband pushing a Death Eater against a wall, fucking into
"Harry," Bryan said. Harry couldn't actually hear it, but he watched as those lips formed the syllables, soft and red. He had a sudden urge to kiss this man who'd been such a wonderful friend to him over the past few days. He wondered when the last time he'd kissed someone had been. He thought about it for a few beats, and realised it must have been Camilla. Merlin, that felt like a lifetime ago now.
They locked eyes, Draco standing over Harry, who was still curled up on the couch. It was an unbearably tender moment, and Draco couldn’t help reaching out with his free hand and brushing the curls off of Harry’s face. It looked like Harry was about to say something, but after a moment he shook his head, and released Draco’s hand.
“That sounds like a good idea,” Harry agreed. “Draco and I were actually talking about your work today.”
Harry stared warily at the spoon, before finally leaning in and accepting the bite. He was surprised to find that Bryan was right. The cake was light, melting in his mouth with a sweet, chocolatey flavour.
“I’m going to America,” Harry said happily. “Where the national language is English, and there can’t be any miscommunications.”
“So, what do you think?” Scorpius asked as his father looked around the newly completed apartment in awe.
But then again, this wouldn’t be a real relationship either, right? It was just to be able to figure out what Malfoy was up to. Surely that wouldn’t take too long. They’d have dinner together a few times, and then once he knew what deal the git had made with the Unspeakables, Harry could simply put an end to it.
“It’s not ideal,” Draco agreed. “But it’s not like St Mungo’s will take me. They’ve made it clear that they don’t trust me to be on their staff.”
“Now if you don’t mind removing these ridiculous spells, I am rather hungry and would like for Sarah to be able to find our table sometime today.”
“So, how are you finding your new flat?” he asked casually. Scorpius shrugged, wondering what he could say about the place. It didn’t quite feel like a home yet. Granted, he’d rushed the process of buying it and moving in, since he’d needed a place for his papa. He didn’t quite want to say so to his dad, however.
“I think it’s just something we’ve been taught to believe in. That’s why they’ve been trying to invent potions and spells and bonds for centuries, but we’ve never figured out how to recreate true love. It’s a little depressing to think that even dragons can find true love, but I can’t.”
Harry shook his head. “I’m never really alone on these trips. I always find someone to make friends with.”
Everyone else chuckled, and Harry felt himself blushing. It was true that he often got himself into frankly unbelievable situations, though it had been happening less often as he got older.
”In this interview, did you reveal the identities of the Death Eaters that were present in the graveyard?”
Harry gingerly perches on the edge of his seat and studies his daddy’s face with a frown… He hadn’t noticed it at all during the lesson, but the man looks ill… His complexion is pale, almost ashen and he’s clearly exhausted…
”Exactly! Very well put, Draco — Have a point for Slytherin — No-one knows what a Boggart looks like when it’s alone. The Boggart inside this wardrobe has not assumed its form yet, because it cannot know what the person on the other side of the door fears the most until it comes face to face with that person… So when I let him out in a minute, it will immediately seem to become whatever each of us fear the most… That means that we have a huge advantage on the Boggart before we even begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?”
After what must have been hours, days, lifetimes, he’s vaguely aware of the Curse lifting again. But the pain doesn’t immediately stop, it just fades slightly. His whole body continues to convulse and his head pounds, either from the lingering effects of the Curse or from the imapct with the headstone — Harry’s lost count on how many times he’s slammed his hack back against it now…
Wheeling around they see Rita Skeeter in her acid-green robes, her blood red lips stretched wide and her beady blue eyes narrowed. Next to her, the bored-looking photographer lowers his camera, the blown lightbulb of the flash smoking slightly. Except, he doesn’t look so bored this time, Harry notices with a sinking feeling.
Dumbledore falls silent and studies Harry’s face patiently for a moment, then gently asks him what he’s thinking.
again, Draco discreetly grabs Harry’s hand and stops him from following the rest of the team to the changing rooms. He turns back around and gives the blonde a questioning look.
Draco looks horror-struck and just opens and closes his mouth silently a couple of times. Harry frowns, ”Suit yourself…”
”Yeah. Christmas gift from mother”, Draco says happily, his eyes glinting with surprise. ”You like them?”
Suddenly the memory dissolves and Harry stumbles forward with the force of the spell leaving him, gasping and blinking frantically. He feels his cheeks burn with embarassment and his heart is still hammering away inside his chest.
He stutters to stop as Draco keeps pulling him away from the dance floor and continues towards the doors, stumbling after him into the corridor outside.
Harry smiles to himself. It morphs into a full on chuckle when he sees Pansy casually sidling up to Granger whilst looking in the opposite direction like she doesn’t know exactly where she’s going.
”Well, if it’s as simple as the two of you having swapped places, then we just need to figure out a way to swap you back”, she states matter-of-factly. ”If there would have been more realities and more Harrys involved, it would have made things a lot more complicated. Don’t you think?”
”Oh, stop it”, Harry huffs. ”Enough. This is ridiculous. Pansy will be fine, everything will be fine. If
The bed next to his is empty, but Harry can see the others still have their hangings pulled, except for one, which only has one side still closed but the side facing Harry pulled aside and he can see Blaise Zabini sit up with a sleepy stretch, squinting over at him with sleep-swollen eyes before yawning widely.
”Hey, Ron”, one of the twins say from the doorway. ”Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.”
”Harry says there was a house-elf in his room”, Sirius says, then looks at Harry again. ”It wasn’t Kreacher, was it?”
It’s as if the course of Dreamless Sleep has created a solid foundation of calmness in him that somehow spills into the nights when he doesn’t take any potion… and last night, the oddest thing happened. He’d been dreaming about the graveyard as usual, but before the Death Eaters even showed up the dream shifted and he found himself indoors suddenly…
”Okay, enough!” Harry snaps in a strangled voice, the ringing in his ears worsened by Riddle’s high-pitched voice.
As they are finishing up their breakfast, Professor Snape comes striding down the aisle between the Slytherin and Ravenclaw tables and tells Harry that the champions’ families are waiting in the adjoining chamber.
Harry is only vaguely aware of the Transfiguration teacher’s stern voice instructing everyone to remain calm as he touches down on the ground next to Seamus and Draco, collapsing on his knees next to them both and giving his boyfriend’s shoulder a gentle shake.
Harry throws the girl a sidelong look, the memories of the two End of Year parties in the other world already fresh in his mind. The other Pansy hadn’t seemed all that concerned with ”Gryffindor cooties” when she was plastering herself over Granger on the dance floor and cosying up to her on the floor behind the sofa… He doesn’t think this is the right time or place to be sharing that particular memory with anyone. But he makes a mental note to definitely
A few hands shoot up and Harry isn’t surprised to see Granger’s twitching eagerly in the air, but he
Draco tilts his head back and Harry feels his own mouth watering as he watches the outline of his Adam’s apple move up and down, as he swallows several mouthfuls of firewhiskey without pause.
and whether or not Snape has anything to do with all of this, that evil thing in forest wants that Stone, that’s what Firenze tried to tell me before you and Hagrid interrupted us. He said the unicorn blood would sustain them until they could get their hands on something else, something that would restore all their strength and power, something that would mean they can never die —
”Oh-kay, al-ready!” Harry says loudly, pleasantly surprised despite everything when the blonde bursts out laughing. ”I wasn’t thinking — stop laughing!”
Blaise and Harry nod in understanding, and Harry thanks the girl for letting them know. She gives them all another pinched smile, then walks back to the Gryffindor table.
The building dread of now knowing he could be ending up on the other side of the universe, only has a moment to take hold before he’s tumbling out onto the living room floor at Creirwyn’s Hollow and Harry feels his heart skip a beat at the familiar sight. I’m home!
”Yeah…” Sirius mumbles. ”I can’t believe I found it funny, though… you sort of jumped, all startled and the next thing we knew you were bawling your eyes out and running to Remus, and I felt bad but… I also thought it was very funny, I actually started laughing… Remus was so cross with me…”
”Umbridge!” Draco gasps and Harry flips over to his back and stares at the blonde lying next to him on the floor.
Blaise roll his eyes and sighs, ”Where is Draco… This conversation needs some more intelligence to balance out the dung that you come up with, Finnigan…”
On the morning of the third task, Harry’s nerves finally start to kick in. It’s nowhere near as bad as the panic he’d felt before the first two tasks, more like the butterflies he used to get before a Quidditch game back in Second Year. It’s actually quite a nice feeling, and with adrenaline slowly starting to course through him, Harry is actually excited for this evening!
… It wouldn’t surprise me if he’s gone round the bend finally… That house-elf of his who was found on the scene of the Dark Mark at the World Cup, probably just hiding in the woods during all the commotion, he gave it clothes, right then and there, in front of everyone… There’s no way a house-elf conjured that Dark Mark. I don’t care that they found Harry’s wand next to her. She could just as easily have found it on the forest floor.”
Twisting around slightly, Harry looks around for Draco. Professor Snape keeps his arm around the blonde’s shoulders and the two of them stand as well, following Harry and his dads towards the castle. Draco’s eyes flicker up and lock with Harry’s for a second and Harry feels his insides squirm as the shuttered look in the blonde’s face registers… Not being able to read the other boy’s feelings, when his own has been ruthlessly and publicly exposed makes Harry feel vulnerable and at a significant disadvantage; he feels like his chest has been slit open and his heart put on public display, whereas Draco gets to keep his feelings close to his chest as always.
Harry frowns. Draco quickly glances up at him, but then looks down again and stares intently at his own feet instead, the toe of his shoe scuffing against the silver and green carpet…
The lanterns roar to life, bathing the dormitory in a warm, green glow. Professor Snape is standing just inside the door, his dark eyes narrowed and lips pressed together.
Because one thing that does bother Harry, is that Draco still hasn’t told him about his summer since he implied that there actually is something
Narcissa comes swooping inside the room from another doorway and smiles serenly at him as she inclines her head in greeting. Harry quickly mirrors the gesture and smiles back, if a little hesitantly. Although Mrs Malfoy has never been anything but nice to him, something about the witch makes him feel very uncomfortable. Probably because he can’t seem to read her and therefore has no idea what the woman is thinking, and more specifically what she thinks of
, Harry thinks as he lies awake in bed later that night and the image keeps flickering back into his mind’s eye, making him fluttery and frustrated in equal measures.
The old Headmaster peers at him over the rim of his half-moon spectacles and gives him a small smile.
Taking a deep breath, Harry pushes himself up to sitting. He hears his dad let out a bark of laughter and gestures rudely in his general direction.
Umbridge’s head snaps up and she fixes him with a furious look, the Quibbler crumbling in her trembling fists.
A roasted leg of lamb is waiting for them in the kitchen, surrounded by all sorts of greens, roasted potatoes and a steaming gravy boat. Harry feels his stomach growl in anticipation and eagerly takes his seat at the table.
”Oh, this?” the other twin says casually. ”Just a potion we’ve been working on… We were trying to cheer Ginny up, she’s been really upset since we all found out about Colin — they sit next to each other in Charms — but it didn’t seem to work as we’d expected…”
”I’ll give you your change”, Mr Roberts mutters with a glare. ”But you’re over there, just by those trees…”
”Oh-kay, fair enough”, Diggory says in his unwaveringly cheerful manner, which Harry has come to realise is the teaching persona he’s chosen to go with.
Besides himself with grief, Harry fists the blanket and continues to scream for his daddy hysterically as hot tears run down his face.
”I didn’t mean it like that…” He sniffles. ”But dad is still so mean to Professor Snape, and I always thought he’d been really awful to you guys at school and then I find out it was the other way around, that
Harry swallows a groan and shoots the Ravenclaw girl a piteous look, while Skeeter lets out a snort so loud it attracts the attention of people sitting at nearby tables. When she starts disparaging the paper, Draco leans in to hiss in Harry’s ear, ”What are we even doing here?”
Sirius, who clearly hadn’t thought of it from that angle, is suddenly looking less convinced of the whole plan and blinks at his husband. But he says nothing.
Draco glances at Harry quickly, but doesn’t say anything. Harry pretends not to have heard and helps himself to some pumpkin juice. He can’t stand Pansy, but it’s really up to Draco whom he talks to.
”I have given my statement to the Minister”, Dumbledore cuts in calmly. ”Surely, Harry shouldn’t have to go over everything again?”
He looks over at the very last row of desks on the Gryffindor side of the classroom where Neville Longbottom is sitting and pins him with an intense look. The Gryffindor gives a tiny jolt that makes him wobble like a pile of jelly in his chair and he gulps visibly.
Harry feels the fluttery things in his belly fly up again and smiles, ”I like you too, Draco. I really want us to be friends.”
The door slides shut again and Harry turns over to his back and stares up at the ceiling. He’s just beginning to drift off when the soft creak of the door reaches him for a third time and he blinks his eyes open again.
The others follow suit, one by one, and after kissing the hem of Voldemort’s robes they quickly back away from him again and move to stand in a circle around him and the grave, leaving spaces between them as if waiting for more people to arrive.
”… Mr Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration”, Bagman continues. ”Which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage. We award him forty points… And finally, Mr Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm to great effect, returned with his hostage but well outside of the time limit, so we award him forty points!… The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty-fourth of June and the champions will be notified of what is coming exactly one month before. Thank you all for your support of the champions!”
”Harry? What are you doing?” Remus says on the other side of his bedroom door. ”I thought I heard something—”
”Horace has his weaknesses like the rest of us”, Dumbledore continues. ”Occlumensy or wit are not part of them, so I do not believe that I could get the unaltered memory from him by force or outsmarting him… But I do believe that you are the one person wo might be able to penetrate his defences.”
Snape marches up to them, his big black robes billowing behind him and he pushes them both ahead of him out the door.
Nothing happens for at least five long seconds. Harry is about to suggest they come up with a different plan, when suddenly the eagle begins to move. Slowly but steadily it starts to revolve, revealing the spiral staircase behind.
He doesn’t, but he does remain in the doorway until Harry has walked over to his bed and sat down. With one last sweeping glance over the other beds in the dorm, Snape gives Harry a curt nod and leaves, sliding the door closed as quietly as possible.
As Harry cranes his neck and looks down at the quill it begins to flutter frantically, scribbling on the parchment, ”
She starts circulating amongst the students, quizzing them on magical creatures and asking them about the class, and about Hagrid, before she sidles up to Professor Grubbly-Plank.
”Granger, Professor”, the Gryffindor says. ”I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets?”
”Hogwarts, is it?” she asks him in a brittle voice and Harry nods politely. ”Ah yes, I remember my first year at Hogwarts… What house are you in, boy? I was a Hufflepuff myself… Ah yes, what a glorious time it was…”
”Close your eyes”, Harry murmurs and keeps his own eyes narrowed into slits, ready to squeeze them shut at the slightest noise or hint of movement.
Spinning back round to face Madam Pince, Harry feels his heart thud excitedly in his chest as he asks her about the book on languages. She gives him an unimpressed look and points to a whole section of the library dedicated to languages.
”You’re joking”, Seamus mutters, looking uncomfortable at such a serious subject matter. ”What, for real?”
”Do you want to risk it?” Draco counters. ”He’s the only professor who isn’t biased towards us slytherins, and who stands up to the other teachers for us, do you really want to lose him as Head of House—?”
Harry doesn’t answer, because he can already see the headlights of the approaching Hogwarts Express through the darkness and his stomach gives an excited jolt at the thought of seeing Draco and his friends again soon.
”Some of you handed in acceptable essays and were graded accordingly, but the general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week’s essay on various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get a ’D’ in the future…”
”Where the Hell have you been?” a voice hisses in the darkness and he startles. ”Tell me you didn’t go into the Forbidden Forest by yourself in the middle of the night!”
The look he gives Harry is unmistakably sympathetic and Harry nods in understanding. It makes very little sense to him, but he figures Dumbledore must have his reasons.
”Because, Harry…” Remus says as he joins them in the kitchen. ”I’m not a Hogwarts professor anymore, so he has no obligation to help me.”
The Gryffindor team is already waiting for them in the middle of the pitch, next to the Quidditch teacher Madam Hooch, in her judging robes. As the Slytherin team joins them, she instructs Flint and Oliver Wood to shake hands, which they do reluctantly, but once they’re gripping the other’s hand they seem to be squeezing a lot harder than necessary.
Snape smirks, then turns to Draco and murmurs something. Harry frowns, glancing uncertainly at Lockhart.
”Yeah, Ron’s brother Percy”, Harry says. ”He went to the Yule Ball instead of Mr Crouch as well, said he was overworked or something…”
” the girl exclaims and Harry winces at her shrill, grating voice. ”Is there something going on that I should know about?”
”I don’t think you meant it to kill anyone, but monsters don’t make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for a bit of exercise and —”
If the threat of expulsion and Professor Snape’s reprimand, which reminded Harry of his promise to his dads to stay out of trouble this year, weren’t enough to strengthen his resolve to keep his head down and stay off Umbridge’s radar, then these nightly detentions surely are… as Harry averts his eyes from the woman’s wide, cold grin and slumps into the straight-backed chair for the third night in a row, feeling like he’s stuck in some nightmarish vicious circle, he can help but think that he’d do anything not to have to come back here again —
It’s not until a somewhat frazzled-looking Granger latches onto him inside the Gryffindor Common Roo portrait hole, accusing him of
Grasping one of the Cup’s handles, Harry immediately feels swooping sensation in his stomach, like he’s being pulled through space by an invisible thread hooked to his navel, while the whole world swirls around him and Krum, connected by the Triwizard Cup in their hands.
”He definitely hates me”, Malfoy adds, then looks up at Harry with a look challenging him to disagree.
Harry watches their progress and that of the other students clamber over each other and the sudden pest to flee the Great Hall, in dumbstruck fascination. Draco grabs a hold of him and hisses something about getting out of there and Harry nods numbly, still staring at the crowd that is stampeding out of the Great Hall, past a very stricken-looking Umbridge standing in the door.
Harry scrunches his eyes up hard and then blinks a few time before refocusing on his surroundings again, then lets out a pained groan that is part frustration, part despair as there is no doubt about where he is: sprawled on his back across the threshold between the two rooms, his legs stretched out inside the Time Room and the rest of him inside the Space Room, but more importantly, s
Remus’s mouth twitches slightly, ”Yes, like that. Although I hope the Boggart won’t turn into Professor Snape again, or something’s quite awry… In fact, I want you all to take a moment now to think of the thing that you fear the most and then try and come up with a way to alter that thing to make it funny.”
!” Draco exclaims, tapping his wand against the lock on the door and immediately it clicks, and the door swings open.
”You guys…” Harry says and it’s like he’s hearing himself from the outside. ”I think you should owl Dumbledore. I think… I think I know what I need to do…”
”Well, I have to go to the Ball with her, won’t I?” Draco says and sits up properly. ”Don’t look at me like that! You told me to tell you what I need,
His mind flashes to the young qizards in the illustrations in the book Remus gave him, frantically trying to remember everything they did and how… and he curses himself for not having looked in the book for weeks, he should have been refreshing his memory, he should have been revising, he should —
They hop off the staircase at the top and Harry throws himself at the door to the office and bangs on it, but nothing happens… He tries the door handle, but the door is locked… Draco tries the Alohomora spell, but it doesn’t work… That’s when Harry remembers the knife Sirius gave him for Christmas and he digs it out of his book bag with shaking hands and kneels down in front of the door.
He nods numbly and shuffles across the room. He’s vaguely aware of the dormitory door easing shut with a sigh behind him as he toes his shoes off and crawls onto the bed. Once the bed-hangings are securely in place around the bed, he pulls his uniform off and buries under the duvet and blankets. He closes his eyes and methodically goes through all of his relaxation exercises, feeling more adamant than ever to do them all and do them right…
”, Dudley snarls. ”You tried to pull that one last time, as well. But no-one believed you then and I don’t believe you now! It was
When the first bead to reach the other wizard’s wand touches the tip, the wand emits a scream as if in pain and then smoke begins to curl out of it, except it’s not just smoke… it’s a shape… it’s the shape of a hand, and Harry realises this must be the ghost — or echo — of Wormtail’s silver hand, like the wand is regurgitating its’ own spells… no sooner has this thought flared inside Harry’s head than another, horrible thought occurs to him… the spell performed by the wand before the hand…
What’s worse, is that he now dreams of walking down that corridor outside the Department of Mysteries every single night, with a feeling of building excitement and longing that leaves him feeling extremely frustrated when he wakes up, after having stood staring at the door for what always feels like hours. He almost wishes the door would open, just for the variety of it. But also, because that’s what he longs for in the dream.
He had contemplated talking to Goyle or Crabbe about it but they were different too. They saw him as, well, the prince. They thought him flawless, like they could find no fault in his doing. If he were to rant about this trivial matter to them, he'd be trying to cover up for himself instead of opening his heart (Merlin, that sounds cringe) to them. He didn't want to disappoint them.
"I mean no, stop it you git," Malfoy firmly said. "I'm not going to disappoint little Teddy like that," because of course everything is for the kid, Harry longed the time when Draco would— when Malfoy— As much as he was glad his plan seemed to be working somewhat, Harry couldn't help but be disappointed. Just a little.
Draco nodded. He knew exactly that was the root of the problem, but he couldn't deny, "It is still my fault, in the end."
And that was it; he didn't want to disappoint anybody, especially his parents. Merlin knew if his nosy homeroom teacher would tell them, but if he did, Draco was certain he was done for. He had never been close to his parents (most rich kids weren't, he assumed, or he hoped) and the only string holding them consisted of hopes and expectations that he didn't dare to cross. But here he was, making a mess out of his life. Again.
The blond had stepped back until his back reached the door, still looking at Harry with hurt. He still remembered the way Draco's eyes had glistened with unshed tears and the man was gone in a blink of an eye.
A deep breath. Harry kept his gaze glued to the wall behind Draco, unable to look at him in the eye.
As close as Harry had been to getting into Slytherin, Draco was the person who the hat shouted, "Slytherin!" to despite not having touched his head for even two seconds. So obviously, the brunette couldn't compare when it came to sneaky plans and such things.
Harry was surprised to hear the blond say, "Fine." Teddy was the right lie to go, it seemed. "But not today. Unlike the Chosen One, we, the lower beings, have better things to do on a Monday morning. Such as, I apologize if the term is too rare for
"Are you… homophobic? Is that it?" Draco had asked, confusion now mingling with hurt. "Because I swear- you've been sending me so many signals! And you-"
See, Harry found it hard to keep on being angry once ‘love’ came out of those sinful lips. He couldn’t fight the grin coming out his face. “Yes, yes whatever. I love you too, even though you’re the worst asshole to ever exist. Embarrassing us in front of my godson, Draco, my underage, innocent godson—”
He'd fallen asleep during class. It was the second time it'd happened this whole semester, and the first time he got caught. It wasn't even the whole subject, only one thirds of it, but his homeroom teacher kept asking and prodding and bothering and making him want to-
Draco felt a bit like something was choking him from the inside, slowing his breathing until he became restless. He wanted to reach out to someone, but what would he say? He'd done a minor fuck-up that caused him to have a small internal breakdown, but nothing actually enough to tell someone and have them symphatize, because it really almost didn't matter.
Draco raised his head up, looking at the sky that'd turned dark a long time ago. He exhaled a puff of breath that turned into a wisp before disappearing.
Draco couldn' t swim. He knew how to, sure, but he couldn't do it long enough to save himself if he were to say, drowning. That was one of his ways to go, in his head. To throw himself down a cliff; it just sounded so… nice. Unproblematic. Another was by meds, but he didn't know which ones were lethal and how much they'd hurt. His parents had lots of those stored in their cupboards—they were doctors.
And if Draco's words and Draco's flirty, dirty grin didn't make him speechless and gaping and with a bit of a hard-on (just a bit), then Draco's away of hips and his fucking
"Not at all. I enjoy having you here," Harry replied. "Your presence is like the wind. I enjoy talking to you. Can we talk more?"
It was a long time ago that Malfoy changed into Draco, that hurtful insults turned into playful jabs, that punches became tentative touches and hate evolved into love. They were two sides of the same coin, always attracted to one another like some magnets that couldn't get enough of one another.
Harry could sense it in every corner of their home. Don't get him wrong, he smelt as aromatic as usual, but his snake had used a different perfume and Harry… didn't know how to feel about this particular change. He didn't dislike the new perfume, no, (as if he could ever dislike that Draco personally handpicked anyways,) but he had gotten so used to the old one, had made beautiful memories with it. It seemed sad to part with it.
"Well he's not asking to fuck me-" Draco cut himself off when he realized what he'd said. "Sorry, uh…"
Strange as it was, Harry already found it ingrained in him, whenever he met someone or went someplace new, to
“I just- I didn’t know I hated myself so much, that I hurt you over it. It’s such a stupid thing. You deserve better, not someone like-”
Draco sighed, sitting down on a familiar bench not too far from his house. Another person was already there, he looked up when Draco let himself fall with a loud thud, obviously thinking, didn't that hurt?
"And whatever makes you think that I know this?" Malfoy asked, still not paying Harry a glance because to the git his plants deserved more attention than his guest. Then again, it might be that he didn't consider Harry a guest at all. Malfoy Manor was cold as ever,
“Oh,” she says, softening. This isn’t the time for selfishness. “Well, yes. He’s my husband, but he was my friend first. I love him. I want him to be happy.”
Ginny lowers her wand. “I think – I think I could live with myself if it was just that. But it’s not, is it?”
“But,” she continues, “when he started to get really, really fed up with the Ministry and the bloody politics of it all, James was just about to go to Hogwarts. He couldn’t do that to our kids, because Hogwarts was one place where people forgot to stare, for the most part. And if Harry was there – well, they’d never escape his shadow.”
“Oh, I know. We got exceptionally lucky. But I think they would’ve turned out different if they weren’t
“It’s always quiet with them gone, isn’t it?” he says softly, and Ginny feels a kindred ache that never goes away, no matter how many times she drops the boys off at King’s Cross station. Oddly, she hadn’t expected Malfoy to feel the same.
Harry is leaning against the doorframe, still in his Auror robes. He looks haggard; Ginny has noticed, of course she has, but she didn’t realise that the dead-on-his-feet aura extends past his hatred of work. It looks bone-deep, making his limbs and eyelids heavy. He looks old.
Malfoy swirls the liquid in his glass, watching it, mesmerized. “I’m not here to steal your husband,” he starts. It makes Ginny laugh.
She looks up at Malfoy who hasn’t looked away since the start of her speech. “He blames himself, really. For them. For how they’ve turned out.”
“Harry’s not home,” she calls over her shoulder as she charms the biscuits to sit in neat little rows. “He’s doing overtime today, working on a raid of some description.” But he should know that, she thinks.
“Oh, it’s Malfoy, now?” he taunts. Ginny digs her fingernails into the arms of her chair. She takes deep breaths.
Ginny smiles. “Oh. Well, no, actually, I do. Because the wards to the grounds of the house are very specific with who they allow to just sit on our doorstep. People’d be staring through our windows, see, wouldn’t they? So it’s actually quite a short list of people who are allowed so close to the house. And two weeks ago, that list lengthened by one name. Your name.”
Ginny can barely see past her armful of shopping bags, only able to navigate the drive from memory alone, and she’s thinking about whether she could be bothered to cook anything for dinner. That’s why she doesn’t see him until she almost treads on him.
She pours out two more measures, adds an ice cube without asking, and passes one to Malfoy. He takes a delicate sip.
She doesn’t look back at him as she pours out two more healthy measures. She hesitates before she passes the second glass to him.
“Was Charlie the fit one?” Draco asks suddenly, then looks down at his drink as though it’s betrayed him.
“Harry had this brilliant smile on his face when he came in the door. I actually didn’t say anything for a minute, just so I could look at him. But then he saw me. He cried; did you know? I was sitting in his armchair and he knelt down in front of me and cried into my knees.”
