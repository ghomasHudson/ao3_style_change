"You're always welcome in my room" Draco smirked and walked out of the bathroom into his room. Harry followed and slid onto the right side of the bed. Draco smiled at Harry then climbed into bed on the left side. Harry curled up under the covers.
"What did you decide for the password Potter?"  Draco said trying his best to sound cold and angry. "Unicorn Hair" Harry said smiling. "Interesting choice Potter what made you choose it?" Harry was not about to admit that he knew Draco's wand was unicorn hair core. "It just had a nice ring to it" Harry said with a convincing smile.  "Do you need to use the restroom?" Harry asked, that had probably came out oddly.
"Yes be patient" Draco said pouring it into a vial. Harry watched the liquid spill into the vial. "Here smell it" Draco held it up to Harry's nose. Harry sniffed it. "Well if you would move back a little I could probably smell it, you're too close all I smell is you" Harry pushed the vial away. Draco broke out into a big smile, but let it fade so Harry wouldn't be suspicious.
Harry lips quivered and he broke out into laughter. "She's very funny right? God I hate that girl" Harry said wiping his eyes which were now tearful from laughter. "Who is she?" Draco looked down at him. "Ginny Weasley, my most recent ex cover-up" Harry chuckled and sighed happily. "Hm interesting, didn't know you were into red heads." Draco smiled.
All was calm until he heard a branch snap behind him. Harry stopped dead in his tracks and halted his breathing. Harry grabbed hold of his wand. He slowly turned around. "Lumos" He mumbled and a light sprouted from the end of his wand. He walked towards the sound he had heard.
"No ones ever loved me the way you described before." Harry sniffled and kissed Draco softly. "It's just how I feel in my heart about you love. My life would be incomplete without you" Draco kissed Harry's forehead.
"Stupefy" Lucius smiled as he did it. Harry fell unconscious as well. "Quite disgusting Draco let this Gryffindor anywhere near these colors, thought I raised him better" Lucius said with disgust. He left with Harry.
Harry cleared his head and began talking to Hermione and Ron. Well sort of Ron, it was a tad bit difficult to talk to him because he was too busy shoving food into his face like his life depended on it. Harry looked up at the front of the hall to see Professor Mcgonagall, Flitwick, Snape, Sprout, and Dumbledore. Hagrid was also sitting up there in between Snape and Mcgonagall. The Head's of all the houses, Hagrid, and of course Headmaster.
The day had gone by faster than he expected. Next thing Harry knew it was potions class. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way into the classroom. They took their seats at a table. Snape was straightening up his desk. Harry spotted Draco on the other side of the room and smiled.
Draco pulled away and led him up to their dorm. They got into the dorm and Harry started talking. "What was all tha-" Harry was cut off by Draco pinning him against a wall. Once again Draco was gentle, careful not to hurt Harry.  "So, think it's funny to tease me?" Draco said softly keeping Harry against the wall. "Yes, yes I do" Harry smirked with a fire igniting in his eyes.
"Ok Barty today's the big day!" Bellatrix smiled. Barty smiled as well. "Can we do it now?" Barty asked with excitement. And a sense of impatience. "No their friends are on their way right now. We must wait until they leave. We can do it then" Bellatrix began changing into some more appropriate clothes for the day.
"I am so absolutely deeply infatuated with you. You are the most gorgeous person I have ever laid my eyes on. I cant even imagine my life without you. I love your smile, your eyes, your smell, your laugh, and so much more darling. It doesn't get any better than you. I could never stop loving you. You are my dream come true, you are my comfort person. You are my safety. You are the stability I longed for, for so long. You are my home." Draco was a bit teary by the time he was done talking. He meant every single word he said.
"Harry do you think..?" Hermione looked at him. "I- I don't know" He stuttered and ruffled his hair. "I mean maybe" He replied. Hermione smiled and got giddy. "I'm so happy for you" She hugged him. Harry smiled and furrowed his eyebrows. "Uh Okay" Harry smiled oddly. "Well I'll be off to the library, read some old books, relax during the free period" Harry said backing away from his friends.
"I told you, you cannot sneak up on me like that" Bellatrix said sounding frustrated. The man sat down on her bed. "C'mon like you don't love being scared?" The man chuckled. "You must be quiet they may hear you" She said as she put her dress back into her wardrobe.
Draco slowly and softly pulled away from Harry's mouth. He smirked when he heard a small whine come from Harry's mouth. Harry's cheeks were flushed, his bottom lip bruised, his hair a mess. Draco was just as equally messy, his hair was messed up, his lips were beat red, his cheeks also flushed. They were both out of breath.
"Alrighty let me put my shoes back on and we can go" Harry smiled and cheerily walked into his room. He slid his shoes back on and made his way into the common room. Draco was already there waiting. "Ready?" Draco looked at him. Harry nodded and smiled making his way out of the dorm in front of Draco.
Harry put his suit on, having a little difficulty tying his tie but he managed. Harry looked at himself in the bathroom mirror and ran his hands along the material. Harry looked good in a suit and he knew he did. Harry walked out into the bedroom to find Draco putting his bracelet on.
Harry smiled insincerely just wanting Dumbledore to go away. Harry had already dealt with enough Dumbledore for the day. "Oh well yes I do believe there is no reason for me to be here anymore, you boys get comfortable and make yourselves at home. Goodbye"
They continued chatting while dinner was being prepared, nothing necessarily interesting considering all of the awkward energy in the room.
Draco scoffed and sat on his broomstick looking up at the sky. "You ever wonder where you'll be in 10 years?" Harry said softly. "All the time" Draco responded solemnly. Draco was pretty sure he wasn't going to make it past the next 1 year. Harry was also sure of the same thing. Draco's life wasn't as bad as Harry's, but it was most definitely not perfect.
"What are you on about? You really think I can just give up on you that easily?" Draco looked down at him getting slightly angry. Harry took a deep breath. "Draco. I'm nothing, I won't be able to keep you in this weird happiness for long. I have problems, I have insecurities. I have sadness and anger running through me at all times of every day." Harry sniffled.
"I promise" Harry pulled away. "Now let's go read." He went into Draco's room and grabbed the book. "By the lake?" Draco watched him come out of his room. "Yes" Harry smiled and walked out of the dorm. Harry had a habit of just walking out, he knew Draco would follow.
Draco found it so hard to believe he was in Harry Potters bedroom, in his bed. Draco had only woken up this morning when Harry was having a nightmare because something inside him told him something was wrong with Harry.  He hadn't understood what had woken him up and alerted him Harry wasn't happy or content.
Hermione hugged Harry as well. "I'll see you around. Be safe ok?" She said as she smiled and walked out the door. Harry closed the door once they were gone, and locked it.
Bellatrix had become a very close person to Harry. She gave him advice, she joked with him, and she was there for him. Harry and her had began to become friends, very good friends. He trusted her, he believed she was truly a changed woman.
They made it back to the dorm with only a few odd glances coming their way from others. All three walked inside. "Wait here let me see if he's up" Draco said and set his and Harry's plates down. Hermione and Ron both exchanged confused glances.
Snape nodded and walked out of the room swooshing his robes dramatically. Harry chuckled. "Does he do that every time?" Harry looked at Draco. Draco nodded and smiled. "I'm glad your back I really missed you" Draco held Harry's hand. "Me too." Harry smiled.
Draco wanted to cry, if something happened to Harry he would be truly alone again. A selfish reason he knew. It wasn't just that. It was that Harry had grown so close to him, Harry began to mean so much to him. Draco truly cared for Harry, he would just fall apart if anything happened to him. Draco had never cared this much about another human none the less another boy. A boy he was sure he hated for years. A boy who had been through so much, more than anyone deserved.
"Oh and tonight" Harry looked at Draco. "Yes?" Draco cleared his throat. "We're sleeping in my room, I refuse to look at this green anymore" Harry looked around the room making a face as if he had just smelled an utterly dastardly smell. "Oh quiet, you love this green" Draco looked around as well.
"How about you smell it then?" Harry asked Draco. "You're the one taking it" Draco smirked. He had already smelled it, it smelled of treacle tart and broomstick handle. Draco could recognize that smell anywhere. It was Harry.
"So are you two coming to classes today" Hermione asked. Harry shook his head. "No, not today considering I'm leaving tonight I asked headmaster if we could skip" Harry continued to eat. "Aw you need to skip with Malfoy so you two can spend time together" Hermione made a pouty face at the two of them and giggled. Harry rolled his eyes jokingly. "As much as I love you 'Mione you can be a royal pain in the arse" Harry chuckled.
Someone tapped on Harry's right shoulder. Harry spun around and stared down at a girl who stared back at him.
"James." Harry responded. "Harry James Potter." Draco said as if he was making sure he got it right. "Yeah that's it." Harry smiled and gazed up at the sky. "What's yours?"
"It's gorgeous darling" Draco kissed Harry, Draco really kissed Harry with every ounce of love in his body. "Okay okay your turn, It was sort of last minute. Although I think you'll love it" Draco smiled and waited impatiently for Harry to unwrap his gift.
"So, you obviously know break has moved up" Harry said as Neville sat down. "Yeah sucks we won't be able to that gathering" Neville shrugged and ran a hand through his hair. "Well actually..would you like to come to Draco's manor at some point during break for a dinner?" Harry looked at Neville who had regained that cheery look in his eye.
"I go home for Christmas, get malnourished and beaten. T- that's why I c- cut.." The last word out of Harry's mouth came as a whisper. Draco scooted closer to Harry. "Can I see?" Draco whispered looking at Harry.  Harry let a tear fall down his cheek.
"Well then looks like I'll be on my way back to my much better color schemed room, this one has much too red and gold" Draco looked hesitant almost as if he regretted saying what he had.  "Yeah right Malfoy, red and gold are much more elegant than that wretched green that you and all your Slytherin worship." Harry chuckled at his own remark. Draco looked impressed. "Didn't know you had some snake in you." Draco smirked.
"What was all that about?" Ron said, stuffing his face like usual. Hermione nodded wanting to know as well. "Nothing" Harry mumbled now feeling bad about how he was to Draco.
Draco and Harry ended up having to push the trip back until school had finished. Narcissa made a full and speedy recovery, thankfully. They had disposed of Barty and Bellatrix properly.
"I'm sorry, i'm so sorry" Draco whispered. Harry cried and held onto Draco. He couldn't stay mad at Draco, they were both a little damaged in all fairness.
If he had known how good his life would become he never would've put himself through all the shit he did. With a loving husband and an adorable little boy.
"Seems as if you just could not shut up about me." Draco teased on. Harry just remained silent and smiling. Draco began laughing hysterically as they entered the hall. Once they were in multiple heads turned to face them. Harry Potter back from the hospital with Draco Malfoy. Quite a scene.
Harry took off his shoes and walked to Draco's bedroom. He was barely conscious, barely aware of where he was going. Draco chuckled and followed him. Harry started removing his clothes. "Woah Harry don't get me wrong I'd love to see you in all your glory, but how about I go get your pajamas? Alright?" Draco smirked
updated Pansy" Hermione smiled as well and began to walk in the direction of Harry's dorm. "Oh and I will win the bet" Hermione smiled. "Forgetting something?" Pansy asked. "Oh god Ron" Hermione laughed and walked back into the hall getting Ron. "Thank you" she said as she walked back in. Pansy smiled and walked away to her first class.
"It can be our thinking spot now" Draco looked down at Harry. Harry felt a smile tug at the corners of his mouth. "I'd like that"
Harry's eyes fluttered open. He looked around, very confused. He seemed to be in the one of the beds in the hospital wing. Harry's heart rate quickened had something happened to him, to Draco? The past 2 hours of his life were a complete blur. Harry tried to remember what had happened but couldn't. And then it clicked. Blaise Zabini used him. He knocked him out. Harry remembered being in Blaise's arms.
"Oh shut up" Harry hit Draco's chest and rolled his eyes playfully. "I must see this journal sometime." Draco smiled and proceeded to walk down the hall. Harry followed him. "Never."
"So you two are spending Christmas together?" Ron wiggled his eyebrows and Harry laughed. "Yes we are and Ron please don't ever do that again" Harry smiled and wiped his eyes teary from laughter. Draco smiled as well. "Bye guys" Harry and Draco waved as they walked out of the hall behind the other students. They walked back up to the dorm and looked around for any last minute items. "I'm nervous but excited" Harry wiped the sweat from his hands.
Harry looked around the hallways half hoping he would see Draco walking back to their dorm. He wasn't.
"It's alright, my fault I get startled easily. If you don't mind my asking what's your name?" He said while looking down at her emerald green pajamas. A Slytherin.
They made their way downstairs, passing Bellatrix on the way. They smiled to her and continued to the main room. Narcissa was already in there, sitting on the couch. She seemed to be waiting for them.
Harry smiled because he knew this was going to be a forever sort of thing. They were in love, true love. They knew it wasn't just lust or physical attraction because they were in a bath together. Just a bath, nothing sexual, just a nice relaxing bath.
Harry looked back at him making direct eye contact. Draco looked to the side not wanting to see Harry's eyes. "A little help here?" Harry asked still struggling. Draco shook his head "I must get dressed" He said oddly formal.
Two figures emerged from each of the corners. Out of the moonlit corner came a man with long white hair, his father. Out of the white light came a boy with short raven hair and round glasses. Harry. He smiled and felt warm at the sight of Harry.
"Avada Keda-" Bellatrix began speaking and pointing her wand at Draco who was attempting to protect Harry. "No!" Harry yelled and jumped in front of Draco.
Draco sniffled and made his way downstairs. His mother put her hand on his back and rubbed softly. Draco began sobbing again. He couldn't control himself.
"That was nothing compared to what would start happening. My room is under the stairs, it's tiny, hot, and frankly disgusting. My uncle...well he.." Harry cleared his throat and bit the inside of his cheek.  He took a deep breath trying to maintain his composure.
"What? How?" Blaise turned his attention to Draco. "You outed me to the whole damn school!" Draco slightly raised his voice. "What are you talking about? You sound mad, I didn't out you to anyone!" Blaise raised his voice as well.
Draco got down on one knee and looked up to Harry as he pulled a black velvet box out of his pocket. Harry let out a choked up chuckle as Draco fumbled with the box. Harry sniffled and stared down at him.
Everyone hugged and chatted for a bit. "Okay gift exchange. Me and 'Mione have got to be on our way soon. Mum's expecting us home soon." Ron said and pulled the gifts out of Hermione's bag. Neville and Blaise were cuddled up together next to the fireplace.
"Love." Draco lifted Harry's head and stared at him. Harry kissed Draco, Harry placed his soft lips to Draco's. Draco kissed back, his tears wetting Harry's cheeks. "It's okay, everything's okay. We're okay. I'm here" Draco said against Harry's lips. Harry nodded and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck. Draco held Harry so tightly, never wanting to let go again.
A grand king size bed was pushed against a wall in the center of the room, grey duvet and silky grey pillowcases. The bed frame was absolutely stunning, hand carved figures were in the dark wood of it. There were two suggestively large windows on either side of the bed. There were two wardrobes. One had a gryffindor emblem on it while the other had a slytherin emblem on it. "I figured I would put the emblems on them so you two know who's wardrobe is who's so you two didn't fuss about it" She smiled.
Harry looked up at him smiling. "I'll miss you too" Harry kissed his nose. Draco chuckled. Harry turned his attention back down to the book. Draco began reading aloud. They sat and read. Almost finished the book from the amount of time they spent out there. Draco would stop reading every now and then to call for some food from a house elf. "I have to leave in about an hour" Harry spoke up interrupting Draco.
"What? Really? Who'd you hear that from?" Neville got a sudden wave of excitement. "I..I mean oh cool. How do you know?" Neville adjusted his tone, but the sparkle of excitement was still glistening in his eye. "Just trust me on this one, try talking to him. He's a good guy you won't regret it." Harry nudged Neville a little and smiled.
They hated when Harry went to school, that means that they had lost their servant, and punching bag. Harry continued to poke his food and move it around his plate. He took a few bites of scrambled eggs. That was all he had ate. "You eat like a mouse Potter it's odd" Draco said looking over at him
Harry was so happy everything seemed to work out perfectly. Draco's mother supported them, she loved them. It was perfection.
Draco got out of the shower after about a twenty-five minute pep talk to himself about how everything would be fine.
Finally, Harry said, “I think this weekend just -” He made a vague gesture with the hand that wasn’t holding Draco. “It had to happen eventually - the whole Ginny thing, that is. I just don’t think any of us were prepared for it.”
Draco didn’t say anything, mulling over the words. Finally, he said, “I’m not sure if she knows Harry and I are married.”
“I don’t know about that.”
Well, he thought to himself, at least she didn’t start throwing hexes. Draco doubted that would be a pleasant thing for the children to wake up to, and he personally didn’t feel like handling any more family drama than was necessary.
Draco couldn’t imagine her being happy for him and Harry.
“It’s not your baby!”
Draco scoffed. “You could say that.”
Hell, he was still debating whether or not he should send an ‘SOS’ text to Ella and have her fake some emergency for the theatre.
“What happened to him, Mother?” Draco had asked, and Narcissa’s eyes fluttered shut, a brief flicker of pain passing through her face.
Harry looked at Draco, and it felt like the man was seeing through him. Draco was flayed open and sewn back together all at once, Harry’s gaze was so intense. “You know, Sirius and Remus were together.”
Everyone just laughed and patted his back, before leaving to get changed and go home.
Draco hummed. “Fuck indeed. Speaking of fucking,” he said, and Harry laughed.
He grabbed them and went to go sit on the balcony, expertly lighting his pipe, puffing once, twice, thrice, and exhaling. He looked out at the city, at all the muggles buzzing about like bees in a hive. What simple lives they all must lead.
Ella gasped and he chuckled. He opened the door, and heard the crowd loudly settling in their seats.
Before he went to find Ginny in the living room, he went to find the half-empty package of cigarettes laying on top of the case that held his pipes.
“Oh, no, no, no. They will feel worse. If I pulled half the shit they’ve done while I was interning, I would have been fired within the first week.”
He was thankful Harry understood his hangups when it came to the wizarding world; how Harry met him halfway.
That brief smile told Harry all he needed to know. The girl would stay.
“That was impolite of me,” she said.
When he told Harry as much, one day while visiting the Potter house, the man threw his head back and laughed. “God help us. If they are nearly as mischievous as we were, they will be insufferable.”
Harry was standing next to them, solemn in his ill-fitting black suit. He held a black umbrella over all three of their heads, and Draco loved him endlessly for it.
Scorpius looked unsure of what to say, silent in his plush chair by the fireplace.
“Harry, if an intern fucks up one more thing for this show, please feel free to finish what you started in sixth year and kill me already,” Draco’s voice spoke from the phone.
“Anyways,” Draco continued, “I stopped singing after Mother passed.” They exited the building. “I hummed to Scorpius when he was a wee one, of course. It was the only way for him to fall asleep sometimes. But I never really sang until tonight.”
It was official: Draco married an idiot.
Ginny turned such a remarkable shade of puce it was hard for Draco not to laugh. “Well, I -”
Draco looked back down at the little thing in his arms and tilted his head. “Come look. I think he looks a bit squashed, but the mediwitch said that was normal.”
Harry sucked in a breath.
“Maybe so, but that doesn’t mean I can’t be sympathetic.”
Harry absentmindedly, wrapped his arm around Draco and Draco sighed again, before actively tuning into his husband’s conversation.
“I just don’t understand why she’d wait so long to see us. Or why she’s never asked to see us before this,” Albus muttered, scowling at the floor.
He could feel Harry smile. “And you said you wanted a boyfriend, not a barnacle.”
“Damn it, Ginny, I don’t care about that! He’s my best friend. He wouldn’t call if it wasn’t serious.”
“Oh, come on, dad,” Scorpius rolled his eyes. “You wouldn’t sound so sad about your friends if you weren’t fucking at least one of them.”
When Harry and Ginny got divorced, it was such a spectacle in the Wizarding World that even Draco heard of it from where he stood, far removed from wizarding society.
“Who even says that?” Harry teased, an incredulous look on his face.
“Harry,” Draco softened his voice. “You’re hurting, and you’re my best friend. I’m entitled to buying you a drink and you are entitled to a night among adults where you can bitch. Or cry. Whichever you prefer.”
Harry was surprised to find Draco was even involved in theatre. They might have met while Draco was looking for a book on wizarding costuming, but Draco had only mentioned it was for a paper he was writing, and how it was part of his work.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You, my darling friend, are being dramatic. Save that shite for your ex-wife, not for me.” Harry winced at the use of “ex-wife”, and Draco cringed. “Sorry.”
Draco could feel the blood rush to his face.
“Oh, I’m just dandy. My children heard about my - rather unsafe, might I add - teenage sex life. What could ever be wrong?”
Draco sighed. He hoped, at least for Harry’s sake, that the miserable couple would fix themselves. Harry was in love with Ginny still, and it was sad to see him hurting.
“What do you think? She brought up the fucking war - which, might I add, we had not discussed with the children  - and called me a fucking Death Eater in front of everyone.”
“Whatever.” Draco paused, his voice taking a more serious tone. “I mean it, Harry. They shouldn’t have to deal with her bullshit.”
They both sighed.
Not many people knew this - Draco tried a little too hard to keep it a secret - but Draco could sing rather well.
Harry grinned and leaned in for a kiss. “Only for you.”
Ella nodded. “Fair enough.” She looked at her watch, and held out her wrist so Draco could see. Nine fifty-one. Almost time for the show to be over.
Draco scoffed. “Karma’s a bitch, or so I’m told.” He sucked in a breath, and Harry felt helpless. “Thank you for coming.”
“Understudies?” Draco asked. Seriously, at this point he would take anyone who knew the lines.”
“But that’s not who you are anymore.”
Draco blinked, absentmindedly flicking the ash off of his cigarette.
From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Ella on the dance floor, grinning and becoming him over. He took another sip of his water and pushed himself off of his seat, stumbling. Harry wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist to steady him, and Draco shot him a blinding grin before running to Ella and grabbing her hand.
Harry gave a wry smile. “I’m sure I can relate.”
Harry sniggered beside him. “No, but you do use that kind of language a lot.”
Draco bolted, laughing all the while.
“Yup,” Harry said, popping the ‘p.’
“Look, I get it. I just - I need you here. For me.”
Harry was going to be
This turned out far longer and just a tad angstier than I expected, so fair warning. Thank you so much for reading!
“In all honesty, Draco,” Potter said, setting his mug down. Draco tried not to wince at how the condensation was beginning to drip onto the wooden bartop and summoned a coaster to place under the mug. Potter noticed the almost-cringe but didn’t say anything, just smiled softly and winked, like he did it on purpose. Draco ignored the fluttery feeling in his stomach. “I don’t know if I’m going crazy-”
Harry sighed and stepped up to wrap his arms around Draco. “I know, love. I think she wants to talk to me about something.”
“Draco -”
Harry laughed. “I think Parkinson might’ve done.”
“You never thought to tell me you could sing?” Harry asked. He seemed so loud in the quiet room.
Harry laughed outright this time. “No, you’re right.”
Draco shrugged again. “I’m gay. Astoria knew that and we planned on ending the marriage as soon as Scorpius was weaned, but....that does not change the fact that she was one of my closest friends, and I miss her dearly.”
The room became charged with...something, so thick it felt tangible. It felt like one of those moments that had the potential to change everything, and Draco wasn’t sure if he appreciated it.
He tried not to think about his own mother, whose worst fault was her habit of sighing. Draco himself was bad about that, too - he sighed at anything. But his mother, God, her sighs said everything she never could - often weighted, cold things that never failed to make Draco feel like shit.
“Yes, that seems to be the general consensus this evening. I thought the same when I first saw myself.” He looked at the clock hanging on the wall. “I take it’s time to go?”
The conversation stopped.
Harry scratched the back of his neck. “Er, yeah. I only got her text just now. She must have apparated.”
He heaved a dramatic sigh, bracing himself to answer the door when he heard footsteps behind him.
Draco hummed in affirmation. “I’d had an on and off relationship with a muggle man before I proposed to her.” He paused. “Granted, I broke things off long before that, and we lost contact after the war, but he was my first love. And I didn’t want to begin a marriage on a lie.”
Harry shot him a mild glare, then sighed. “The kids have extendable ears, you know.”
Scorpius nodded, looking pensive.
Draco resisted the urge to cup Harry’s face and wipe those wrinkles away, and instead waited patiently for Harry to think through his words. “Aren’t you lonely?” Harry blinked, shocked - as if that wasn’t what he meant to say.
“I’m sorry.”
At the very least, he had his family. At this point, that was all he could really ask for. He said as much later that night, when the kids were all in their rooms and Draco and Harry were cuddling on the couch, sharing a bottle of wine and decompressing.
“Sure,” Draco said, nodding. “Well, Ginny has arrived, so do try not to let your conversation about Quidditch hold you up.”
“James said it’s been over twenty years; we’re different people now.”
He’d already wept so much his tears had stained Harry’s white dress shirt a soggy looking gray. Harry had just held him like a child until he calmed down, and Draco wanted to be embarrassed, but he wasn’t because this was Harry and he knew everything about Draco. He accepted everything about Draco, and Draco was so in love with him, despite how his wife had just died. How fucked was that?
Ella shook her head.
“My muggle friends?”
Draco snickered to himself before stealing the cigarette back. It was almost to the filter at this point. “I mean, so can I. It seems you have a type, my love.”
He lifted his glass, and they clinked their drinks together.
When he voiced that, Harry just said, “I think we parent with love, and that’s what matters.”
Harry blinked. “Okay. We’ll be there.”
Harry raised his hand in an aborted wave but lowered it when he really looked at Draco.
She sucked in a breath. “Wow.”
Which wasn’t much, honestly. Draco couldn’t decide if he was disappointed or if he was just that old as he nursed his finger of Odgen’s across from Harry. The other man was drinking from a mug of beer that left traces of frothy foam on his top lip every time he took a sip.
“Oh, most definitely. Much better than me, at least. I never deserved her.”
Draco winced. That was no way to garner favor from Harry. He sighed.
Draco gasped. “I’ll have you know that was a very hard time in my life!”
Draco sighed, pulling out his phone to call Harry.
Harry barked a surprised laugh. “You remember that?”
“You stealing my wine, Malfoy?”
Ginny looked well, since the last time he had seen her.
Harry scoffed, shaking his head.
Draco laughed a soft, bitter thing. “I will.” He sighed. “So, anything new in your life?”
Harry and he had decided that once the kids covered the war in History of Magic, they would sit down and tell the children about their respective experiences. But that time had not yet come, and so the children didn’t know.
And Draco left.
Harry gently grabbed Draco’s hand and cradled it close. He took a deep breath. “You were...kind of brutal, honestly, when you were on the phone with Ella just then.”
Draco drew in a shuddering breath. Truthfully, he and Scorpius had never really talked in depth about Astoria. Scorpius had never expressed interest in learning about his mother, and Draco always suspected it was partially because his son didn’t want him to feel bad.
Truthfully, Draco knew he was probably overreacting in his anxiety over Ginny’s visit that morning.
It was Lily who spoke this time. “She hasn’t wanted to see us since she left.”
Draco offered a sarcastic bow. “How do you do?”
Draco shot her a tired smile. “What did I miss?”
Harry’s jaw dropped to the floor. He looked like a fish.
Harry nudged him with his ebow, shooting Draco a wide-eyed look. “We’ve been married for about two years now.”
Harry scooped Albus into his arms and they followed until they stopped at a set of ornate double doors.
Harry took a sip of his beer and swiped his tongue over his upper lip to get the foam. Draco tried not to think about it. “It’s fine. I should have seen it coming, I think.” He looked down into his mug, contemplative. “I...I don’t think I ever really loved her, Draco. I think we were each other’s source of comfort during the final years of the war, and then we just...stagnated.”
“Oh, Draco,” Harry murmured. He sounded sad.
Harry chuckled and shook his head. “Small people with a big attitude?”
Draco sighed and carded his hand through his husband’s hair once more, before getting up. He left their room, Harry still asleep in bed, and went back to the kitchen. He perched on one of the barstools lining the island and plucked his phone from his pocket, absentmindedly scrolling through Instagram. He heard someone clunking about in their bedroom upstairs.
“Hm?”
Albus scoffed. “Sure it isn’t.”
All in all, Harry didn’t know what to expect.
Draco gave her a pitying look. “Honey, I didn’t insinuate anything.”
Harry gave him another kiss. “I love you too.”
There was no way to tell.
Draco shifted so he could lay against Harry’s chest. “And I love them. I just don’t want to take away their time with their mother - I know my being there will make her feel unsafe and more likely to lash out.”
It was a short walk to the train, and Draco gave each of the children a hug and kiss on the cheek before they all boarded, sighing when he was left alone on the platform. He could feel the weighted stares falling upon him, and it took nearly all of his energy to remain standing upright. Even after all these years, he was still scrutinized by wizarding society.
Astoria.
His husband rolled his eyes and patted the sheets beside him.
They lowered Astoria’s casket into the ground and all Draco could think about was how she had held him as he wept over a man who would never love him back. Scorpius, his son, his darling baby boy, was propped against Draco’s hip, sucking his tiny thumb, unaware of what was happening. Draco kissed the fine hair atop his son’s head, bouncing him slightly, and tried to stifle his sobs for the baby’s sake. If Scorpius saw Draco weep, so would he, and Draco couldn’t handle that. Not now.
Harry made a face. “Did you have to say that?”
Albus rolled his eyes, looking every inch the sullen teenager he was. “Why did she decide to come to see us now?”
Draco looked between the children, affronted. They each had a curious gleam in their eyes. Lily was smiling as if she knew something he didn’t.
Draco cringed. “Well, I do hope that blows over.” He looked at Harry, who was still staring after Weasley, frowning. For a moment, Draco just looked at the other man, admiring him. Harry had barely aged a day since the first time they had met after the war. He still had the same piercing green eyes, the same silky dark hair, and clear brown skin. The only things that marked a difference between now and then were the fine lines running across the man’s forehead and lining the corners of his eyes, and the thick black beard adorning his chin.
Harry laughed and shook his head, then took a sip.  “This is mine.”
“And I’ll be the first to admit that those things were caused by me and my family’s actions,” Draco added. “I’m not proud of it; my father was the only one who bought into all that shit, but…” he shrugged.
“Christ, Draco.”
Draco sighed to himself at that. He and Pansy used to be close, but after the war, she had fucked off to Europe to marry some rich pureblood Frenchman. They hadn’t talked much since, although they did occasionally meet up if either of them were in town.
The flat was silent, now. It was of the oppressive sort, thick and cloying and heavy on the air. It sent Harry back to those final moments after the Battle of Hogwarts, where everything sounded muffled, muted. Dangerous.
Harry just rubbed over Draco’s knuckles with his thumb. “That about sums it up, yeah.” He shot Draco a conspiratory grin. “A chihuahua, huh?”
It was funny, Draco distantly thought while following the actors’ lines. He had never pictured himself being a stage manager in Muggle London, but he couldn’t be happier. His father would roll in his grave if he found out, of course, but Draco didn’t care about that. The people that mattered were happy for him.
“But then you think of all the good memories you have and realize their leaving isn’t so bad after all,” he finished. Then, he gave each of his stepchildren a stern look. “I want you to know I’m not trying to make you feel guilty by saying this. You are all entitled to your feelings about this situation, and that is perfectly normal and valid.”
So why did Draco feel so wary?
Draco sighed. “I am sorry, you know.”
“Yes, but…”
“I did,” Scorpius mumbled, and Draco’s heart broke.
Draco sighed for what felt like the thousandth time that night, easing himself off the chair and into the kitchen so he could brew a cuppa before bed.
Draco sighed again, and rested his mug on his bedside table, before ungracefully plopping face first on the bed. “I’m not sure I’m going to survive this,” he said into the duvet.
“You know,” Draco began, lost in thought, “Your mother was the first person I told when I figured out I was gay.”
He didn’t think Ginny knew what to say. She just stared at him, opening and closing her mouth like a fish.
Draco stewed on this all day until he got home.
Spring 2016
“Oh yeah?”
Draco blinked, then nodded. “Okay. I’ll be in makeup. Come to me with all of your questions.”
“I went clubbing, naturally. Got fucked in an alleyway a few times; did a few things my mother would have been appalled at had she known what they were. All that good stuff.”
Draco pulled the shirt over his head and set it to where Harry laid the leggings and reached for his own clothes. He had them tucked away in his backpack, and after digging them out and pulling on his trousers, he continued. “Mother said that Sirius -” Harry’s breath hitched, like it always did when talking about his godfather. “Sirius used to share his records with her. They were quite close, from what I could tell.”
It was silent for a moment.
Ella frowned. “Oh.”
Draco nodded. “Oh, I’m sure. When I knew you, you trailed after Harry like a lovesick puppy. Now, you can’t be bothered to give us a week’s notice of a single visit.”
“Was this your plan then?”
“You turned out just fine,” Harry murmured.
“What’d she say?”
Draco sighed and sat up. “Fuck.”
He knew she was all he would be able to think about when performing later, and all he could think about was how she would have been so proud of him. At that thought, Draco smiled.
“Oh, I doubt it. I remember the aftermath of the fights you would get into before you two were divorced. I think your exact words were that ‘she could hold grudges better than Snape himself.’”
Draco sneered. “How very nice of you. Figure it out. I expect a full mic check tomorrow. Be here at four so we can fix this. Now go home.”
“You remember what I was wearing?” Ginny asked, bewildered.
He lit the first cigarette while kicking open the door to his office.
Draco turned his face so his mouth was free. “I said, I don’t think I’m going to survive this weekend.”
Draco held out his hand, and the irony was not lost on him when Harry took it. They began to walk through the corridor leading to the exit.
Draco continued, a little louder, “When they do leave, it hurts, and often you think you’re better off having not known them at all, to save yourself from that hurt, yes?” He looked them each in the eye.
Harry grinned and kissed the top of Draco’s head. “Thank you, love.”
And then someone knocked on the front door.
Ella nodded.
“Do you think Scorpius and I should go somewhere while Ginny is visiting?” Draco broke away from his husband’s arms anxiously, taking a quick drag from his pipe. “She’s not his mother; she has no attachment to him. She surely won’t want to see me.”
And all Draco could do was be there for his children, he thought while waiting for the kettle to boil. He laid a teabag in a mug and rested it on the counter.
On those occasions, they’ll go out on their balcony and sit together. Draco will have a smoke, Harry will clutch his cup of tea like a vice. They never really talked, unless one of them needed to cry, or rage, or rant.
“And the other?”
Sometimes, Draco didn’t believe this was his life. That he and Harry were actually married, that he’d gotten this lucky. If he was being honest, Draco wasn’t sure if he deserved it, for surely he had to atone for all the things he’s done at some point, right?
Ginny chuckled, looking on the verge of tears.
Draco shook his head with a small frown. “My mother…” he whispered, “she died about twenty years ago, come January. We used to sing together, and so when she was gone, I stopped singing entirely.”
He arrived before Harry did, and as soon as he set his bag down in its spot by the door, he headed straight for the display case that held his pipes and tobacco.
Harry pushed the door open and held it for Draco.
Potter laughed even harder at that, and it filled Draco with such happiness that he was the one that caused that laughter. “Oh, but by the time this one goes off to Hogwarts, it’ll be joining your own sprog. Another rivalry for the ages.”
Suspicious, he turned around, crossing his arms across his chest like a petulant child. He raised an eyebrow.
Draco didn’t like thinking about it, either. When he and Harry had first become friends, they hashed everything out so exhaustively they no longer needed to discuss it, save for the nights when the PTSD got the better of them.
Draco shook his head softly, a small smile adorning his face. He had never smiled quite as bright as when Astoria was alive. Draco thought it was the cost of losing one’s best friend. “I think because we were that bad, we’ll know how to handle them.”
It took Harry a long while to notice it, but Draco admired people who could withstand his more acerbic moods. He respected that kind of strength, and often when he met someone, Draco would be ten times ruder than he was normally. Harry chalked it up to the Slytherin side of things.
“I just...You’ve been through so much shit, Draco. You shouldn’t have to do it again for me.”
“The understudy isn’t here. I gave him a call and he didn’t pick up, and then I had Jason - you know the understudy for Johnson? Well I had him call the understudy and same thing. No dice.”
He wondered what someone would see if they walked in to see him like this. It wasn’t likely; the only people who were here more than he was were the build crew and various maintenance workers.
If today was any sort of sign for how this weekend was going to go, he wanted no part of it. He hated the children’s doubt when it came to Ginny. No child should ever have to deal with that.
He sighed and entered the ghastly old house, climbing up the stairs until he reached the attic. The door to the room was shut, but the knob twisted when Draco reached for it. He could hear loud music coming from the inside, and he briefly wondered if this floor was warded so no sound might leak downstairs.
“I dunno, love. That’s up to you.”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and murmured “You’re my family too.”
Draco released a breath through his nose. “Where’s the understudy?”
“It was...inappropriate of me to call you out like that,” she continued.
Harry just huffed. “Fuck.”
Astoria, Draco knew, would have been a much better mother than Ginny. He kicked himself for thinking it, but it was true. Astoria loved Scorpius with all she was. She would have supported him and his happiness, been there for him.
Draco slowly nodded. He couldn’t believe he was doing this.
For a moment, he imagined what it would have been like if neither of them was married. Maybe, if they were both single, this would be the moment where Draco leaned over and kissed the other man. They would leave together and wake up next to one another, and maybe they would continue pub nights, but this time as a couple. Draco could picture it so easily, in his mind’s eye. Yes, the pub nights would continue, and keep continuing until they invited each other’s friends. Not everyone would get along, naturally, but it was enough that they would all be happy when one of them finally proposed. He and Harry would get married, have a brood of their own, grow old together.
Surely this is how most people felt when interacting with the estranged mothers of their stepchildren?
Draco wondered where they received their volatile emotions. Harry was bullheaded, stubborn, and authoritative, but he rarely showed any sort of feeling around others. Draco always chalked it up to his hero complex; Harry couldn’t play the savior everyone adored if he cried all the time.
“But,” Harry interjected. “It has a happy ending.”
She laughed, swotting him on the shoulder. “You better be. I don’t do this for just anybody.”
Ella laughed and Draco smiled to himself. He loved the girl like family, and he didn’t know what he would do without her.
Was this how Lily Potter felt for most of Harry’s life?
Laughing, Draco replied, “My money’s on him pursuing Teddy. If Teddy could get over their age difference, that is.”
Finally, Ginny said, “I requested to meet you and Harry so I could ask if I could rebuild my relationship with the kids.”
It all started when he came home one night, weary in his bedraggled Auror robes, and informed Draco his ex-wife asked to see the children.
“Thank you,” he said, with too much conviction - so much conviction - and dashed for the corridor leading to the Maternity Ward. The room numbers seemed to fly by as he ran, knocking past several people and ignoring their hushed shouts.
Draco never mentioned to Harry that he could sing. It had never come up in their relationship, and maybe that was a good thing. Sometimes a surprise was good for a relationship, Draco thought, though he never thought his little secret would be revealed like this. He was definitely looking forward to seeing Harry’s reaction after the show.
But he had to make a decision. “Fine.”
The thing is: Scorpius always told Draco of his plans.
The children seemed to soften at that.
Eventually, Ella ended the call and Draco went back inside. The kids were out, probably to give himself and Harry some time to talk.
“What happened to him?” James asked.
Harry rolled his eyes. “And the children? They’ll want to see you too.”
But what about the children? Jamie had more memories of Ginny being motherly, but Albus and Lily only remember her being mostly absent. What would they think of her asking to see them?
Draco sighed. Ginny was due to return from visiting her parents with Lily and Jamie within the hour. She had taken to leaving whenever he was around. Draco knew that as soon as the Weaslette was off of maternity leave, she would be touring with the Harpies, leaving Harry to care for three children under the age of eight. Draco had made a point of not voicing his opinions on the matter. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Oh, no,” Draco said, affronted. “For one thing, he’s at school in Scotland now, and secondly, he’s far too young for this.”
He realized it was Draco when the person shouted “What the fuck do you mean, you don’t know the -” His voice went quiet again, suddenly, as if he realized exactly where he was.
Draco’s reply came easy as breathing. “Love and hate are two sides of the same coin, you know. I think hate is just love that’s been hurt. If you’re still feeling something for someone, you still have a chance.”
Harry nodded, a frown on his face. “Why now?”
“I don’t! I mean it.”
He entered the living room to find the children in their usual spots, with Harry sitting alone on the loveseat. Draco’s husband patted the cushion, and he went to sit down, careful not to slosh his tea when he did.
“I was prepared for it.”
Harry looked away, turned his face to their boys. “Things have been difficult, lately, with Ginny.”
Draco’s mother was quite independent, and he cherished his memories of her, tucked in a little lockbox in his heart with all the other bittersweet memories of his childhood.
“Yeah,” Draco said bitterly. “Naturally, I felt like an ass. Stupid, too - I was relatively safe with all the men I had been with, but…”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You heard me.”
Harry didn’t know, so he didn’t say anything. He was honestly just trying to mask his shock at how forthcoming Draco was being. It had to have been a lack of sleep that was making him so talkative.
Ginny wasn’t there for any of that. She hated it when he and Harry had become friends the year Draco and Astoria were to be married. She hated the very mention of his name.
Draco was sitting at one of the tall round tables for two, nursing a beer with Harry across from him. He could have laughed at the expression on the other man’s face, but he would reserve that for when they would inevitably discuss this night’s reverie over lunch tomorrow.
Draco sighed. “Fine.” He turned around and walked into the house.
Draco groaned. “They’re going to be insufferable when we get home, then.”
Harry huffed, a wry smile briefly flickering across his face, and shook his head. “Silencing charms.”
Unsubtly, Ginny glared at him.
Draco just huffed and cuddled deeper into his husband’s chest.
Harry sputtered, startled. “What?”
“Oh, Harry, you didn’t tell her?” Draco whined.
Draco let out a dramatic sigh, tossing his bag in the corner and plopping ungraciously in his desk chair. Distantly, he thought his mother would have been appalled. “My husband’s ex-wife will be in town on holiday for the weekend and wants to see the kids.”
Harry drew in a breath so deep Draco could feel it. “I know, love.”
He found his husband brooding on the sofa. “What’s got your knickers in a bunch?”
Ginny scowled, crossing her arms over her chest and huffing. Harry sighed, sliding his wand into its holster on his arm and walking over to his wife. Gently, he kissed her on the cheek. When he pulled back, she looked away. “Go, then.”
Draco sighed and took another drag, flicking ash on the floor again before croaking, “Is she gone?”
Draco just sighed. “I love you.”
He sighed and stopped at Scorpius’ door first. He gently knocked and let himself in, only to find Albus and Scorpius sitting cross-legged across from each other on the bed, deep in conversation.
“Do you?”
Draco blinked, and Harry seemed to shift even closer, and it was scary. It was electric, addictive, this air; it felt dangerous just the same.
“Ah, yes, I did hear that a lot.”
Draco opened the door, and leaned against the jamb, watching Harry putter about. It looked like he was going through Sirius’ old things, sifting through an old trunk and pulling the odd clothes and knickknacks out.
He didn’t like to think about Harry’s childhood, though he knew the only love he had received was from Molly Weasley and Hagrid when he was 11.
He nodded, taking another drag. “You were wearing the ugliest mauve slip dress, and you shook your head when Harry took the stand in my defense.”
The girl with blue hair just gave him another look and started applying something on his lips with a brush.
Distantly, he could hear his mother laughing at him. She would have told him to get a grip; this wouldn’t be the end of the world, no matter how awkward it is.
Despite what anyone in the Sacred Twenty-Eight thought, the Weasleys were a genuine family. Molly and Arthur were faithful to each other. No child of theirs had been disowned for bringing shame onto the family name, and Draco...all Draco wanted was a family like that.
Draco liked to read. His mother made him learn at a very young age, and it was a wonderful skill to have when he was younger and he needed to flee from the megalomaniac living in his house.  With books, he could escape to new worlds where he didn’t have to be himself. He liked how characters in books were normal, how they led mundane lives with only a few menial problems.
He couldn’t do much else.
“A lot can change in two years, Draco. Who knows? Maybe by the end of it, you’ll want to keep her as an assistant.”
Draco only allowed himself to get this pissed after a long show, at the cast parties.
He stood up.
Draco leaned over Harry’s shoulder. “What does it say?”
“Okay, cool. You alright?”
Harry sat next to him, pressed up against him. “Tell me about it?”
Harry rushed from where he was standing beside Draco to offer the fallen man a hand up, and Draco sighed.
Draco took a breath. “I also want you to know that as someone who has lost his mother for good, I would give anything to see her again. Just as I know Astoria or Lily Potter would have given anything to see their sons again.”
Harry sputtered. “Because - because it’s you, Draco. If anyone deserves someone good in their life, it’s you.”
“Great, shall we walk up together?” Draco walked up to her and offered his arm.
“Thank you three!” resounded the chorus.
“Hi,” she said, seemingly appearing from nothing. Draco didn’t have time to think about it.
Harry shrugged, sheepish. “It’s fine. Are you okay?”
At his silence, Harry continued. “And I made you stay.”
Draco frowned, unimpressed. “I’m sorry?”  Scorpius started babbling and pulling away from Draco’s hold. Draco set him down on the mat next to Albus.
He shook his head. “Maybe. Astoria had her suspicions; I know that much.”
That must be the curse of being a parent, Draco mused in his chair. One can’t protect their children from every heartbreak.
Draco nodded and left the room.
He sighed, mixing a spoonful of sugar in the dark liquid. There could have been worse things. At least he was recalcitrant.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Whatever. I am going to get properly dressed. Breakfast is on stasis in the kitchen. Your coffee’s in the pot.”
Harry laughed, a tired, rumbly thing. “I’m serious, Draco. You really were like an angel up there.”
Draco chuckled, shaking his head. He and Astoria announced the impending arrival of their firstborn a few months prior, and he was ebullient. “For her sake, I hope they get on well enough.”
Draco kissed his forehead. “She was one of my dearest friends. I loved her in that way.”
Draco sighed. It seemed he would be doing a lot of that this weekend. “I’m sure she has her reasons, darling.”
Ella turned her head to beam at him. “I’ll hold you to that.”
“It was so bad I had to send the kids to their rooms so they wouldn’t hear any more of it.”
And later, when Draco was almost asleep, he heard Harry murmur, “And don’t think I didn’t see you wink during that one song. I’ll get you for that.”
Draco sighed again. “Ginny is your mother. She wants to see you.”
“Alright. Love you.”
“I don’t wish to see her right now, Harry,” he hissed, pleading. “I’m in a fairly good mood and I don’t want that ruined.”
As he headed back to the dressing rooms, Draco was anxiously aware of how Harry was probably waiting for him. There was a chance Andromeda and Teddy were, too, but he doubted it. Teddy had to get back to school, and Andromeda was awfully strict about those sorts of things, even in her distinguished age.
This was all fine and good - though it was ultimately the children’s choice, Ginny had a right to see her kids - until Draco had the sudden realization that Ginny might not even know Harry had remarried.
“Who do you know here that auditioned for Angel? Maybe we can just go short one chorus member.” He looked at Ella, who was fanning her face.
Later, when Scorpius was down for the night, Draco clutched his finger of firewhiskey like a vice and watched his son sleep. Harry was next to him, unwavering, steady, and Draco was clinging to that steadiness as if it were a rock in a storm.
God, that had to have been their third or fourth date. Draco had never had a serious relationship before Harry, and he remembered being mildly terrified when the other man had said that.
he hissed as an afterthought, “We are professionals here. If I hear a peep out of any one of you you’re out.”
Sure enough, Ginny Weasly was waiting on the doorstep.
“Ah, yes, chihuahuas. Those.” He sighed, pulling a hand down over his brows. “Point is, I didn’t want to disturb them, so I didn’t go into detail.”
Ella still looked puzzled. “Well yes, but…” She shrugged, as if she didn’t know what to say.
“Oh.”
Harry slumped where he sat and nodded.
He didn’t notice Harry still sitting at the bar, watching in rapture.
“Then why didn’t you ever tell me?”
And that...that was something that induced a cold-blooded sense of terror almost equivalent to the fear he felt when he learned the Dark Lord would be living with him.
Draco made a low noise in the back of his throat. “Makes sense, I suppose.”
“He’s a no-show.”
Harry nodded. “I didn’t explain anything, either. After I kicked Ginny out, I told them I was going to find you and left right after. I think Scorpius was worried.”
“The children are on the train,” Draco murmured in Harry’s ear, before dropping his hand and stepping a little off to the side.
Draco sucked in a breath. “What?” he bit out.
Harry sighed and sat in front of Draco on the floor, carefully maneuvering around the pile of ash to his left. “Yeah.”
“Where are you?”
Ella gave him a soft smile, but then looked confused. “How did you sound so good just now if you haven’t sang in twenty years then?”
They both sighed.
“Hah! No, we can. I just can’t have you living in squalor - I’d never hear the end of it, I think.”
Draco playfully pouted, leaning away from Harry’s embrace.
Harry crept up the stairs and entered the master bedroom, only to find no one there. Instead, a patronus - a swan - appeared, and Draco’s voice spoke, “At St. Mungo’s. Room 567.” The voice was shaky, scared.
Draco’s mouth opened, then shut. “I’m sure that isn’t the case, darling.”
Draco shook his head, shocked. “Fuck. What do I do?”
Eventually, he would have to enlist Ella’s help to email the people who auditioned and inform them who made the cast list or not. He’d have to get the tech-heads together and make a shopping list, and then undoubtedly yell at them for not submitting what they needed by the deadline. He’d have to come up with that deadline, too.
It was a depressing thought.
Draco gave a sleepy smile against Harry’s dark skin. “I’m sure you will.”
Draco looked at Harry, curious. His husband just shrugged.
Briefly, he was envious of his children. There was no love in his family when he grew up, just stolen moments between him and his mother when Lucius wasn’t around.
Draco winced at the thought. He shouldn’t feel intimidated. Harry and Ginny’s relationship was over long before they divorced, and Harry was married to him now. That should be enough reassurance.
Draco looked at Amber, who nodded. They were already steaming their voice. “I don’t sing,” he said softly.
“Hey, Draco?” He heard Ella ask. Draco looked at her. She gulped. “You know all the lines and choreography, don’t you?”
God, it wasn’t even noon.
Harry huffed, frustrated. “Babies don’t care about time, Gin. You know that.” He waved a hand at her own rounded belly, and she glowered.
Harry didn’t think twice before apparating to the hospital, rushing to the front desk and demanding to see Draco. The Welcome Witch - an old woman, with stern but kind eyes - looked him over and nodded. “Room 567.”
Now, it seemed as if she had gotten her mojo back.
Draco opened the door to the dressing rooms, only to find Harry and Ella chatting.
“It’s stressful,” Draco slurred, glaring at the water bottle Harry pressed into his hands. He took a sip of the offending drink and looked at Harry. “We work long hours with little food and rest to make people happy. I love it.”
“He’s my best friend, Gin. And it’s an emergency.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. It was always so obvious how much Draco loved his wife, and it was obvious how much this all devastated him. “I’m sorry.”
Ella gave him a look. “It wasn’t that. You were genuinely that good.” She paused for a minute, hesitating. “Why did you never audition for anything before?”
Winter 2015
“I dunno, love. We’ll find out soon, I guess.”
Ella nodded, and they got to work.
Draco returned her look and said, “What my darling husband is too polite to say is why do you want to spend time with them now when you have never wanted to before?”
Harry winked. “I’m sure they will.” He raised his mug, grinning. “To fatherhood!”
Harry hummed quietly. “She was a good woman.”
“You are their stepfather. And you’ve been more of a parent to them in the last two years than Ginny has ever been.”
Harry nodded, silent, a frown marring his face.
“The baby, Harry. He’s coming and Astoria -” Draco’s voice cracked at her mention. “God, Harry, she’s white as a sheet and there’s blood everywhere and I don’t know what to do.”
Ella grinned. “Yay! Awesome, okay. I know you can walk in heels, right?”
He sighed. “I broke up with William maybe two months before the Dark Lord took over the Manor. We remained friends - he introduced us all to his new partner a few weeks later; but...the day I said I couldn’t see them anymore, Will announced he was diagnosed with AIDS.”
In the end, it was Scorpius, Harry, and the theatre that brought him back to himself. He still missed Astoria like a lost limb, but it no longer hurt as much as it did when he had first lost her. When the depression took him, as it was wont to do, he distracted himself with his son, and pub nights with Harry, and his work.
“We’re waiting at Fortescue’s, but now you’re done, I suppose we’ll come home. Do you want us to pick up curry or something on the way?”
He hated how he couldn’t magically make it all better.
Draco nodded. “I know.”
That year, he tagged along with Harry to drop off Teddy, James, and Lily at Kings Cross for the semester. They had left Albus and Scorpius at Aunt Andromeda’s so they could go get lunch and a few beers afterward. This time, Draco insisted they go to a muggle pub if only because he was sure many other parents would get the same idea of getting drinks after the children leave.
was his favorite part to play, no doubt. He found a particular joy toasting to all the starving artists and their freedom.
“I won’t go into too much detail as I’m sure you’ll learn about all this in your History of Magic class,” Draco continued. “But…” He shrugged.
“Look, Genevra,” Draco interrupted. “If I thought you were thinking about the children upon making this request, I wouldn’t be such a bitch about it. But they’re my kids, too, and as such I need to look out for them.”
Ginny paused. “What?”
A small frown flickered across Draco’s face. Harry wanted so badly to make it go away.
When they were all there, he tried looking at each of them individually. “Okay, guys, tonight Ella is going to be covering for me. If you have any questions, go to her and she’ll help you out. Are we all good?”
“Is it true, what you said about my mother?”
Harry chuckled softly. “I didn’t hear that, love.”
“Have you told them that?”
A very small, vindictive part of Draco was gleeful. Now Harry had no one to tie him down, no commitment to another. Draco stamped that particular thought down into the depths of his mind. He needed to be there for his friend.
Well, he thought, as he made his way back to Harry, there was a reason he barely went to wizarding places. It had taken him years to fully be accepted at the Three Broomsticks, with countless apologies and amends on top of that.
Rehearsal started.
“What?” he responded petulantly, dumping the ash in the bowl of the pipe in the little bowl and knocking it against the cork. He set the pipe down, taking in a deep breath.
Harry blinked. “Um.”
It was that moment that the children entered the room.
Draco sighed. He’d been doing that a lot this weekend. “Remember when we first got together, and you said you’d always be by my side?”
“Why…” Draco breathed, hating himself for breaking this explosive silence. “Why are you up here?”
“And how would you have handled it?”
Backstage was its own sort of quiet chaos, with everyone bustling about trying to get to their places and find their assigned section. He looked over everyone in the darkness, his eyes having adjusted a minute ago, searching for the individual crew heads and motioning for them to meet him in the corner where his stool was.
Harry scoffed, disbelieving. “You never liked her.”
Draco sighed, frowning a bit. “Sorry, love.”
Belatedly, Harry realized he had never thought of taking his kids to the theatre before. He wondered if he should feel ashamed for it never having crossed his mind.
As soon as they stepped inside, Draco made a beeline for the kitchen. He’d need a nice, strong cuppa while he gathered his words.
Harry slumped back in his chair, looking bewildered. “Honestly, it makes a hell of a lot more sense, now.”
There was an awkward silence after that.
“Because you love me.”
Harry sighed and scooted closer to Draco, wrapping an arm around his shoulders in comfort. “Nobody was mad at you.”
Finally, Draco heard Ella sigh and ask, “Are you okay, Draco?”
It was like flipping a light switch, he thought. He could talk to Harry about anything, and there would be no judgment.
Harry took a breath. “Good.”
Draco rolled his eyes, a bitter smile briefly crossing his face. “Right,” he said, gracefully unfurling himself and standing up. He kissed Harry’s forehead, murmuring, “I’ll be at the theatre. I’ve some things to get done before the first rehearsal on Friday.”
He’d figure that out later.
“Wasn’t Ginny on tour with the Harpies or something?”
“Oh, darling, didn’t you hear? Once you take the Mark, it doesn’t go away.”
They hung up, and Draco sighed to himself. He sat on the bed and pulled out his book.
“Jesus, Draco.”
Ginny nodded.
Draco sighed. “I know,” he whined. “She hates me. Always has, even after I grew up and stopped being such an ass.”
No one objected; everyone seemed to sense his mood. Draco hadn’t meant to make things depressing. He certainly didn’t mean to cut any of his children off. It was just difficult - exhausting, really - to discuss such things. He had hit his limit early.
But his son had just lost his mother. Scorpius would never know exactly how much Astoria loved him, still loves him even in the afterlife, and Draco would never be able to quite explain it.
Draco waved his hands about, placatingly. “It’s fine. It was a long time ago, anyhow.”
Draco harrumphed and nudged Harry’s shoulder. “Yeah. Your children are quite spoiled, despite your best efforts.”
“Hey.” Harry didn’t know where to start. Where was Astoria? Was everything all right?
His mother had turned and looked at him, booping his nose and smiling. “You have the same eyes as he did, the Black eyes. And he had long dark hair, and high cheekbones, and a laugh you could hear from a mile away.”
This time, Draco failed to stifle his snort. Harry turned and smiled at him, and Weasley looked bewildered.
As if on cue, Scorpius’ owl, Ulysses, flew past and landed on the coffee table. Harry plucked the letter from his beak, tearing it open in one fell swoop.
The kids nodded.
Harry nodded, grabbing Draco’s hand and squeezing gently. Draco took Harry’s hand in his and kissed it softly.
“Yep.”
Ella picked up on his anxiety the minute he stepped into his office the following morning, clutching his coffee the way he had clutched his mother’s hand on her deathbed.
“Scorpius and I can make ourselves scarce while she’s visiting, then. She won’t be spending the night, so we can leave after breakfast and return after dinner. Besides, there’s plenty for me to do at the theatre and all my colleagues love him.”
And then Scorpius hopped off his seat and ran to his father on the stage.
Ella hummed, a questioning thing.
Draco nodded, still laughing softly. “Go. We love you all.”
They were silent for a few moments, there holding each other on the balcony until Draco drew in a shuddering breath. “Do you think…” He trailed off, unable to fully articulate it.
Harry stifled a smile. “It’s a little funny.”
For a single moment, Draco was glad Scorpius would never have to deal with that. He wouldn’t have had to if Astoria were still alive, either, because she was actually articulate about her love. The thought only made him cry harder.
It was Draco’s turn to nod. “I know. Now, unless you wish to see me undress - which I highly doubt you do - I’d leave if I were you.”
“Well,” she had said, her eyes glinting in the light of the drawing room. “He always dressed in muggle clothes. This infuriated my Aunt and Uncle, of course. And he was a Gryffindor! The only one in our family.”
If he was being honest, Harry couldn’t tell if Draco actually liked his interns or not.
“I’m sorry,” Ginny said.
Harry finished pulling off the leggings and nodded, listening.
A pause. He could feel his face turning redder by the second. It took him a minute to realize he probably shouldn't have been so explicit.
“Look, Ginny,” he said, taking another drag of his cigarette before leaning forward and flicking the ash into an abandoned mug resting on the coffee table. “It’s not our choice whether or not you get a relationship with the kids. Harry and I can try and protect them all we want, but if they want to see you, they will.”
Draco sighed and slumped in the little loveseat he was sitting in.
“No,” Draco reinforced. “I knew this was coming and I knew exactly what I was signing up for when I married you. Don’t you feel guilty when I knew full well what could happen.”
He heard footsteps coming closer and turned his head to face Harry’s favorite pair of worn dragonhide work boots. Draco would have to get his husband some new jeans soon, he thought; these were fraying at the edges.
Draco felt faintly ridiculous, still standing in full costume, but he still had things to do. He stomped up to the sound booth, having not missed how Mimi’s mic cut off for a second in
He’d save his fretting over Ginny’s arrival for tomorrow, he thought, curling into Harry’s side and slowly drifting to sleep.
“So that’s what this is about.”
“I know.”
“Indeed.”
So, he got up the morning Ginny was due to arrive and proceeded as normal. He brewed himself a cuppa and made breakfast for himself, Harry, and the children, then went outside to have his morning smoke and annotate the script for his theatre’s next show.
“Or something.”
Harry was met with a series of groans and protestations, to which Draco snickered, but Harry was firm. “I’m serious, guys, go to bed. We’ll see you in the morning.”
Draco left the room, then, leaving the boys to continue their conversation.
Draco paused. Everyone was sick. That’s what happens when you go for weeks on no sleep and extreme amounts of coffee. “How sick?”
They all nodded and went to their positions backstage. Draco moved to his own.
Scorpius walked in first, and Draco broke from the conversation to give his son a long look. “Well, don’t you look like you’re having fun. Where have you been?”
Albus toddled next to Scorpius, looking around in wonder. Lily and James were walking behind them, holding hands with Teddy.
Draco hadn’t sung a single note since.
Draco hadn’t felt this safe, this comfortable, this natural in ages. He never wanted it to end.
Draco peered at her. She seemed genuine. “Well, I’ll be. What changed?”
Draco arrived at the theatre at five to prepare for tonight’s show. The actors were all supposed to arrive at six to get ready. They were due to go on at eight.
After she left, Draco shook his head to himself. That whole conversation was stilted, more awkward than his last interactions with his father.
“It’s okay.”
Harry winked at Ella and laughed before turning to Draco. “You know it.”
“Apathy is the opposite of love, then.”
They generally didn’t talk about the sorry state of Harry’s marriage, as a rule. Truth was that Harry and Ginny had been falling apart for a while now, and Draco held the suspicion that Albus was an accident resulting from attempted reparations. It was a sad thought to have, and of course, Draco never told Harry about it, but. The point still stood.
It was silent until Draco blurted, “My father was murdered in his cell in Azkaban when I was twenty years old. He was the only one in my family that was not acquitted during his trial, and I know that was what would have happened to me if I had been in the same situation.”
Because it was. Here was Draco, next to the man he loved, holding his darling baby boy close to his chest. It was better than anything Draco would have dreamed for himself. It didn’t matter how Harry didn’t know about Draco’s feelings for him, how he would likely never learn. He was here, and Draco was more than content with that.
Harry hummed. “A long time ago, I used to hate someone. But I couldn’t stop following him around. I was fascinated.”
Of course, the day that Teddy, Andromeda, and Harry were supposed to come see him was the day that everything went to shit.
And then Angel died.
Draco gave Ella a wry look. “She’s more stubborn than Harry, darling. I doubt I’ll be able to convince her of anything.”
Draco scoffed, burying his head into his husband’s chest. “I should hope not. They weren’t even a twinkle in my eye at that time in my life.” He paused, then murmured. “I just don’t want to embarrass them. It’s a tragic tale, anyway.”
Harry looked like he couldn’t decide whether to laugh or cry at that. “Please, Draco.”
He made the rounds, checking on the children still asleep in their bedrooms before heading to his and Harry’s room, only to find his husband still asleep in their bed. At some point, Harry had managed to cuddle Draco’s pillow as if it were Draco himself, and he still had one arm draped loosely around it. His dark hair was splayed across his pillow, his face half-obscured from view, but Draco knew the fine wrinkles would be softened in sleep.
She looked at him, questioning.
Draco chuckled softly, so as not to disturb the show. “Well, I can hum, can’t I?”
She was hunched over her purse, clutching it to her chest in a vice. Ginny looked to be on the verge of tears, upset.
Ella rolled her eyes. “Okay well, you got that covered up, for one thing. And you have changed.”
She laughed again. “What has you worked up this time? Did everything go well with the ex-wife?”
“You know,” Harry mused, lost in thought. “I think there’s only so much we can do, as parents, for our children. Eventually, they just have to -” he lifted his hand from Draco’s hair and made a fleeting gesture. “ - make their own choices.”
“And keep
Draco checked the time in the dressing room one last time before bolting to makeup. Six forty-five.
Ella nodded, bouncing on her feet and grinning. “Awesome. I’ll take care of everything, Draco, I promise.”
Draco just hummed, then gently patted his son’s side. “Alright, time for you to go to bed. We’ve a long day tomorrow.”
Ginny’s jaw dropped.
“I went to the office and chain-smoked cigarettes until my husband found me.”
Harry’s head whipped back to look at Draco, his eyes wide. “What?”
“To fucked up relationships.”
Draco gasped, standing up in one swift motion. “No, I’m too hurt.”
Finally, his son sighed. “You should come and see for yourself.”
“No, you’re married to me. That’s the problem.”
This was odd. Scorpius had always been cunning - he inherited that from Draco - but he was never likely to carry anything out. If anything, he came up with schemes and had someone else execute them so that he wouldn’t have to take the fall.
“Oh, you know,” Draco sighed.
Harry wanted to ask if Draco really would be fine. He knew from experience how much work newborns were, and Astoria couldn’t do much to help Draco. But then Harry looked at Draco, at the reverence with which he held his son, at the love in his eyes whenever he looked at the child and knew he would be okay.
But then he realized that maybe he had already paid for all his sins. Maybe, just maybe, this was his happy ending after all these years of hardship.
“Or not,” Draco mused. “I have heard him talking about some seventh-year boy, before.”
As soon as Draco exited the stage, still wrapped up in his white sheet, he was surrounded by overenthusiastic chorus and crew members. All of them were clamoring for his attention, frantically whispering about how he did so well and they were so proud of him and holy shit how could he dance in heels, and Draco loved every second of it. He basked in the mob’s attention for a few more seconds before sending them all a glare and motioning for them to get into places.
Draco carried on. “Although, it could have been how I was fucking the lead boy…” He sighed. “Anyway, I have to run. Rehearsal starts at six.”
Ella winced. Draco tried not to take too much pleasure from it. “What’s got your knickers in a twist?”
He just felt wholly unprepared to help them with Ginny.
“Obviously. She’s up there looking out for us, making sure we’re happy.” Draco smiled softly. “She only ever wanted that for us.”
Interlude - Scorpius
Draco usually made a point of abstaining from venturing into the wizarding sector of London, and, by all accounts, that is what he would have done this year. The only thing that made this particular occasion the exception to the rule was that Harry had asked him to go.
And Draco had once been known for never being able to say no to a pretty face.
“Draco.” Harry gave him a pleading look.
He knew that people changed - he certainly had from the time he knew the youngest Weasley; maybe she had too. But he also knew that perhaps Ginny had the greatest ability to affect their family.
“He was such a free spirit, my cousin,” she had said, one day when Draco asked about her cousin,  her eyes focused on a point far away in time.
Draco shook his head, plucking his oxfords from his bag and putting them on. Left foot first, always. He gathered his things and stood, waiting for Harry to meet him at the door so they could walk out together. “No, I don’t think he would have. Mother never tried to reach out to him after Azkaban.”
Scorpius led him and Harry through the front door and into their little front lawn, where they found the rest of the kids huddled around someone.
Draco blinked at the non-sequitur. “Remus as in our third year Defense professor? Teddy’s father?”
He shrugged, ignoring the burning in the back of his eyes. “I was so reckless then, Harry.”
They never really mentioned his standing in the war, nowadays. Harry and Draco had discussed it heavily when they first reconnected, if only to see the other’s perspective on it. But once they had finished discussing the war, they were done.
Distantly, Draco realized he didn’t know where the children were.
Potter, who was in the middle of a swig of his ale, choked. He set his mug down, sputtering, and Draco laughed brightly. Suddenly, he was overcome with the sinking feeling of rightness, like this was how it was always meant to go. Here, Draco was sitting across from Harry Potter, of all people, and all he wanted to do was make the other man laugh more.
“Surprisingly, yes. I mean, it was awkward as hell - I don’t think she knew how to interact with me.”
Could he just go back to sleep and waste the day away? Would that be okay?
Just before she ran off, Draco called her name one last time. She paused and turned and he looked her in the eye. “Thank you.”
But at the same time, it felt like they were in their own universe. Time seemed to stop the way it did in grocery stores or airports after two in the morning. It was slow, syrupy, but it made anything seem possible.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and pushed his black-framed glasses up his nose, looking away.
Harry turned to Draco, still wearing that frown. “I didn’t like hearing him say that shit about you.”
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” Harry said.
Winter 2006
Draco flinched when he heard the door click shut behind him. The sound was worse than a slam, quiet but no less dramatic. No less painful.
Draco gave her a pointed glare and continued. “My point is that now she’s going to find out, and think Harry daft for marrying a Death Eater.”
“I know that.” Draco sighed. “Do you think we’ve screwed them up?”
It made Draco nervous.
Draco laughed, gently swatting his husband’s chest. “I do. Now, answer my question.”
She smiled back at him. “Is he coming to see the show?”
Ella picked up on the third ring. “Hello?”
If he was being honest, Harry didn’t know what the play was about. All he could see was Draco in his spot next to the director, frantically scribbling notes on a legal pad with a biro.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said between chuckles. He caught his breath before leveling a calm stare at Weasley. “For many things.” He didn’t elaborate any further.
He sighed and pulled out his phone, walking out onto the balcony.
“Amber is sick.”
Harry had never felt so out of depth.
“Ella, sweetheart, what am I supposed to say? ‘Ah, yes, I single-handedly caused the siege of Hogwarts. It was terrible; I witnessed one of my best friends die in a fire and I can still hear his screams to this day.’ Or, better yet, ‘Ah, yes, Voldemort himself tortured me so much that I’m still constantly trembling.”
Draco was drunk. He could feel it in the steady thrumming beneath his veins, how his head felt as if it were stuffed with cotton. He felt weightless - which wasn’t all that, bad, considering.
They met at the pub at eight. Teddy had agreed to watch the kids for the night, and Draco was endlessly thankful. Without the responsibility that came with having kids, they could drink as much and as long as they wanted.
It was so silent in the room, Draco could hear a faraway muggle ambulance. Then it dawned on him. “Oh, fuck.”
Cast parties were infamous in their own right. Each show, a member of the cast or crew would pick a pub to host the party after the final show. It was a production on its own, a way for everyone to let loose after weeks and weeks of stress. Cast and crew members could bring a plus one if they chose so, and, as such, Draco invited Harry to tag along. It would be Harry’s first time attending a cast party, and Draco felt a wicked sort of delight in being the one to introduce the man to it.
Astoria was released from the hospital three days later, with orders to remain on bed rest. Harry offered to help with the baby, but Draco declined with a smile and a shake of his head. “He’s my son. I’ll be fine.”
Draco hummed around a sip of his drink. “I think...sometimes we don’t love the people we marry. Or sometimes we do and we just grow apart, but…” he shrugged. “I never loved Astoria romantically.”
Draco herded everyone into the living room and sat them all down before taking a deep breath and sitting down himself. “I trust you all had a good week so far?”
Draco studied her body language in an attempt to gain some insight into what she was thinking.
And wasn’t that a scary thought? Draco was someone who planned and predicted everything by nature - it’s why he was so good at his job, why he survived the damn war against the Dark Lord. Not being able to predict Ginny’s reaction to seeing him with Harry - with her children, and being unable to plan accordingly was terrifying to him.
Scorpius grinned. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
And, well. Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He was under a time crunch, and they had to find someone who could play Angel. Suddenly he wondered what would Harry think? What would his family think? He was thirty-seven years old, now. What if he was too old to play the character?
Harry sighed. “You know this is going to be tough either way. Doesn’t matter if I’m married to you or not.”
Harry’s hands were soft when they cupped Draco’s face and he tasted of wine. He cradled Draco’s cheeks with such care that Draco forgot all of his worries. In the end, he decided, if he had this, all would be well.
“Why are you telling me this?”
Harry gestured to the cigarette. “Come down here and chain-smoke until you felt better.”
“When my son was young enough that he still needed comforting, I would hum to him,” Draco explained. “For a time, it was the only way I could get him to fall asleep.”
When he reached the dressing rooms, he was out of breath, but he still bit out Ella’s name.
Draco laughed, gently tossing the pillow back to her. “I love you, you know.”
He nodded. “I’ll walk you out.”
rang out in the crowd, Draco pointedly did not search for his family. He knew that wherever they were, they were probably aghast at seeing him on stage, and some part of him was thrilled.
Draco sighed, defeated. “I just don’t want them to hurt.”
There was a lull in the conversation.
“Sometimes, my darling,” she had said, looking him in the eye, “bad things happen to good people.”
Draco turned to Harry in confusion, feeling the heat flood to his face and pool in his cheeks. Somehow, that made him feel more embarrassed; Draco had a terrible blush. “You didn’t tell them?”
“She is their mother, darling.”
“Oh,” Ella said. “Well, how did you cope?”
When Draco asked his mother why she liked music so much,his tone filled with childish awe, she always laughed and said that it reminded her of when the days were long and golden. She said that she had a cousin who would listen to all kinds of music, and shared it with herself and Aunt Andromeda in secret.
Ella laughed. “You look great. I almost didn’t recognise you.”
It was true. A few years ago, Draco had gone into a muggle tattoo shop and covered the damn thing in a bunch of Narcissus flowers that trailed up his forearm.
His husband sighed. “They said they’ll come home and see her.”
Draco sat down on one of the couches, yanking off his heels and waiting for Harry to speak.
Harry sighed and kissed the crown of Draco’s head. “We all love you, Draco.”
She chuckled. “That’s depressing as hell.”
And Draco definitely wasn’t as much of a little shit as he was in his formative school years.
“Okay!” Ella ran off, and Draco looked at his phone. Three minutes to places.
“Don’t you ever get lonely, like, romantically?” Harry’s brow was still furrowed. He was going to develop wrinkles if he kept it up.
And he was smiling.
Oftentimes, she would sneak him to muggle concerts when Draco’s father was absent. They weren’t big arena concerts like he would see on Aunt Andromeda’s television many years later, though; instead they were small things. A violinist on the corner of Trafalgar Square, or a small chorus caroling in Piccadilly around Christmas. Music always brought his mother great joy, which she shared with Draco when she could.
Harry looked wounded. “Isn’t that something you tell your friends, though?”
Draco had gasped, both his small hands flying to cover his mouth in surprise. His eyes were wide. “Really?”
Harry returned her hug, kissed her on the head, and mumbled something to her.
Draco gave a harrumph and looked at Ella appraisingly. “You did well tonight, Ella. I don’t think I can thank you enough.”
“I mean it, Draco. We all did stupid shit during the war.”
Draco looked down at his pyjamas. He was wearing one of Harry’s old Gryffindor jumpers and his pants had little dancing penguins on them.
Draco rolled his eyes and turned to face Ella. Her long black hair was twisted in a messy updo and she was wearing glasses instead of her usual contacts. “She wasn’t around much when they were growing up, and she didn’t want custody when she and Harry divorced five years ago, so she hasn’t seen the kids since.”
“Really?”
Draco smiled a bright, soft thing. “Really?”
“Well…” Scorpius looked to the floor, fiddling with his fingers.
“Draco,” Ella bit out, “Angel can’t find her wig.”
“What did he look like?” Draco asked from where he was perched in his mother’s lap.
Maybe Draco should suggest Harry be a pirate for Halloween this year when they take Scorpius and Albus trick-or-treating. He sighed. “Don’t be too mad at Weasley. He is justified in his anger towards me.”
He sighed, and stood up, dragging Harry with him.
“- I just think it would be fun for me to take them to travel a bit. Get them away from England,” Ginny was saying. She unsubtly glanced at Draco.
Draco laughed, leading them off the platform and towards the apparition point. “Why? It was all true.”
When Draco looked at the kids, they seemed morose. His voice softened. “No, I wasn’t okay, I -” He took a deep breath. “Before the Dark Lord came to live with us, I would sneak out and go to muggle clubs to relieve some...tension. I met a few friends there - they were the ones who got me into muggle theatre - and we had a good time. They kept me from thinking too hard about what I had done.”
“Alright -” Harry started, but Draco cut him off.
“I think I’ll talk to them,” she said, taking a deep breath.
The blond rolled his eyes so far back Harry thought they would have disappeared. “God knows I have plenty of that.”
He nodded stiffly. “It was.”
“Actually, tonight is one of the first dress rehearsals. You and the kids could come watch if you fancy. And Teddy. If he wants to come along. We could go to dinner after?”
Draco was silent, watching her.
Draco grinned. “Speaking of fucking,” he continued. “Did the kids actually hear me telling Ella of my, ah, whorish days?”
Draco hummed and lit the next cigarette.
Harry huffed, exasperated. “I’m serious, Draco. You’re my husband. She’s going to be here the entire weekend, and you live here too. You’re bound to run into each other eventually.”
Harry was already in bed when Draco came through the doorway, reading a book. He looked up from his book and smiled at Draco as he entered the room, the same bright, carefree smile Draco fell in love with many years ago.
Draco lifted his glass of wine with a wry smile. “To the death of any sex life, I might have had.”
And then there was a commotion coming from one of the corridors. Harry could hear someone furiously murmuring, steadily getting louder as they came closer.
Harry nodded, gently kissing the top of Draco’s head. “I love you.”
It was also Ella’s first time at one of these things, and Draco would almost feel bad for her if it weren’t for her excitement. He had taken to the girl like a fish to water, once she figured out how to help without being in the way. Eventually, he would make her his assistant. For now, she was with the others on the dance floor, with her raven held up in a ponytail at the crown of her head.
He sighed, exhausted, and pulled away, wincing at the tear stains on her shirt. “I’m sorry.”
At Harry’s nod and smile, Weasley’s face twisted into a frown. It looked like he had tasted something particularly disgusting. “Harry, what the hell is Malfoy doing here?”
Harry’s eyes turned sorrowful. He nodded.
“All do respect, Draco,” Ella said with a softer smile, “I’m not the one going on stage.”
Ginny looked affronted. Draco tried not to take too much joy from that.
Mark swiveled around, and looked up at Draco sheepishly. “I don’t know what happened, dude. I swear.”
Harry shook his head violently, then, looking affronted. “You deserve someone like her, Draco. Someone that good.”
“It was a hard time for all of us,” Harry said, gently patting Draco’s knee.
Autumn 2005
“You are. You’ve grown tame in your old age, love. Just accept it.”
There was a light in the attic of Grimmauld Place. From where he stood on the sidewalk, Draco could see a shadow shifting about up there - likely Harry. But what Harry could be doing up there, Draco couldn’t guess. Harry generally avoided the place like the plague - it was once Sirius’s room, and it was too drenched in memories to be safe.
He knew it would take much more than that to make peace with Weasley. Draco sighed and walked up to Harry, who was still talking to Weasley and gesturing emphatically. He placed a gentle hand on Harry’s shoulder, notifying the man of his presence, and grimaced when he saw Weasley staring at him, a furious look on the ginger’s face.
Harry didn’t bother to smother his chuckles this time. “Yes, dear.”
Harry looked at him with wide green eyes.
Draco came to the sudden realization that he fucked up.
Draco nodded. “It was. Everything intensified in our sixth year. The Dark Lord had taken over the Manor, and I was forced to take the Mark. If I didn’t, he would have killed myself and my family.”
Draco gave her a smug grin, crossing one long leg over the other. “Do you need a minute, darling?”
“I shouldn’t have gotten attached.”
Draco saw the red hair and turned around, walking back towards the door.
Harry hummed through the speaker.
Draco didn’t answer. What was Ginny’s game here? What was she trying to do? He knew she wanted to see the kids more, but she had always hated him.
Harry’s confusion was so palpable it was tangible. “Is that a good thing?”
Her eyes crinkled. “I love you too.”
He looked at Harry, pleading. “They weren’t supposed to know.”
Was this how she felt now, watching helplessly somewhere in the heavens? Was this how Astoria felt, watching Draco explain how much she loved Scorpius?
“He’s a fucking stage manager, Ron. Being a Death Eater isn’t an occupation,” Harry spat.
“What is it, darling?” Draco asked. He felt his husband’s arm drape over his shoulders and leaned into the embrace, still looking at his son.
Teddy was last, giving Harry a hug and whispering something in his ear. Harry flushed at whatever the young man said and lightly whacked him upside the head.
“Oh.”
Draco sat up in one swift motion that left his head spinning. “Honestly, sometimes I wish she would just leave us alone.”
“Now go home!” Draco shouted. “I don’t want to see any of your faces until five o’clock tomorrow!”
“Right.”
Harry looked at him questioningly. “I thought you were closer with Pansy.”
“Pah! You know I wouldn’t actually do anything. For Scorpius’s sake.” A sigh. “How is he?”
Draco just shot his husband a look. Not now.
A pause. “Fair point. So I’m assuming you and Harry explained everything, then?”
Harry shook his head. “No, you weren’t. You braced yourself for it; there’s a difference.”
Draco sighed dramatically and slumped onto the daybed. “Ella, my darling, please do kill me now before I do so myself.”
Now, however, he did not have the time to be nice to her. So, Draco turned to her with a pointed look. “What.”
Draco barked a bitter laugh, hysterical. “Oh, darling, I hadn’t been okay since my father whored me out to save his arse.”
Draco winced. “Poor thing. He inherited my blush, unfortunately.”
Okay, maybe it wasn’t only for comfort.
Admittedly, there weren’t many things Draco would face head-on, as his husband was so apt to do. But for his children, he’d do anything if only to spare them any pain.
It was odd being on this side of the stage. Draco knew, cognitively, that there was so much work the actors put into each individual show, but now that he was singing
And the curtains went up.
“It’s just embarrassing, you know?” Draco pushed away from Harry’s embrace in order to look his husband in the eye. “And it’s - I don’t know how to articulate everything, and my story - our story - is very sad.”
Draco just hummed, then sighed. “Oh, indeed. Now, we need to email the actors who auditioned for the show and tell them who got in.”
“Um.” Draco’s eyes scanned the crowd of actors, skimming each and every corner in his line of sight. “Okay,” he nodded to himself twice. “Here’s what we’re going to do. We still have the wig from Matilda last season. It should be with the rest of the wigs in the makeup closet. We’ll use it this show.”
“I don’t bloody care if it’s an emergency,” she hissed. “It’s the middle of the night!”
It was the sound of his phone vibrating on the bedside table that woke Harry up. Ginny groaned her protest from where she lay beside him, rolling over and grumbling. “Sorry, sorry,” he mumbled, rolling out of bed. He picked up the call, murmuring a near-silent “Hello?” into the speaker as he left the room.
“I think they got the point after I ripped them a new asshole this afternoon if that’s what you’re referring to.”
“Oh, stop it.”
Harry rolled his eyes, leaning further into Draco’s space. Draco latently realized the man was positioning himself in front of Draco, shielding him. Draco ignored the fluttery feeling that set off in his stomach.
Ella nodded. “Someone special?”
“I’m serious, Harry,” Draco turned his face to pout at his husband. “This weekend has been...” He trailed off, shaking his head.
The thing about the front door was that there were two windows on either side of it. They let in a nice amount of natural light into the foyer, but they also served the purpose of allowing someone to check and see who is at the door, before letting them inside.
“I’m sorry.”
It was showtime at the Piccadilly Theatre in London, and everyone was bustling backstage. Draco was making last minute checks on sound and lights, flitting about like a hummingbird on speed. He loved the rush of the theatre these first few minutes between showtime. Call for places was in five minutes, and he was just about to call for his interns to spread the news, when his newest intern ran up to him, panting.
James spoke up first, hesitant. “How did you cope? Were you okay?”
“How dare you,” she seethed, “insinuate that.”
Draco prickled. “I hardly see how that’s any of your business.”
Quickly, he ran to the bedroom, trying - and failing - to be quiet as he scrambled into a shirt and trousers. Ginny had woken up fully in this time, and she sat up in the bed, her fiery hair mussed, watching him in disbelief. “You can’t be serious, Harry.”
Astoria shook her head. “Don’t be. We knew what we were getting into.”
Draco could picture it so easily, and his heart ached when he was sucked back into the present, sitting across from Harry Potter, each of their pregnant wives at home.
Ugh, he was becoming depressing in his old age.
Ella’s mouth was wide open.
One of the kids gasped, and Draco could feel his cheeks flush.
It was only the mother of his step-children, the woman his husband was once married to.
He reached the door.
“What did they say?”
Draco didn’t know what he’d do with himself if the next day didn’t go well.
“Right.” Draco took a deep breath, then nodded to himself, beginning to walk down one of the halls. “You can come another time if you want the whole tour. For now, just follow me.”
Scorpius never asked about Astoria, so he didn’t know Draco had truly loved her, even if it was only as a friend.
Draco groaned. “I swear to god, Harry, you do not understand the wrath I felt when I had to explain to the kids that Ginny actually loved them.”
Draco gave a world-weary sigh. “It’s not so funny, Scorpius.” He gave his son a pointed look. “William and I had broken up a few months before everything. He was good, but we were better off as friends.”
Draco hadn’t thought of it much at the time, but he understood when he heard what happened to Sirius Black, and his understanding deepened when sickness took his mother the winter after the war ended.
Draco laughed. “I suppose it does.”
Draco realized he was in love with Harry one night when Potter was laughing brightly over his mug of ale, green eyes twinkling in the light of the neon signs lining the walls. The pub they were visiting was one of Draco’s choosing, and they were there celebrating the announcement of Potter’s third child.
With the Weasleys, there was no risk of any of that.
Draco froze, his phone clattering to the countertop, loud in the silence of the kitchen. Belatedly, he realized he was shaking.
“Draco are you -” He heard Ella stop in her tracks.
“She said she wanted me to be happy, and that once we had a child we could get a divorce.”
“Draco…”
Ella babbled on about some new boyfriend she had, and Draco was happy that at least her life was so simple. While he was not that old, listening to her tales about her mundane life made him feel young in a way he never had. He tried not to pity himself too much for it - that his childhood was ripped away in the face of a racist megalomaniac.
Her jaw dropped.
He desperately wished Harry hadn’t convinced him to stay.
Draco gave a wry smile, and sat next to Harry on the loveseat. “Ginevra.”
Draco knew the feeling; it was why he sold the Manor as soon as his mother died.
Unlike Ginny.
“Yeah.”
“Should you really be saying this to an Auror?”
Draco blinked. “Why on Earth would they still be outside?”
Potter had already celebrated with his own friends, Draco knew - he wasn’t invited to that particular event due to obvious reasons - but the man also made the time to invite Draco out, jubilant with the news.
Ella laughed, somewhat hysterically. “They’re called chihuahuas, Draco.”
He shook his head, unwilling to dwell on it lest he panic, then faced the children. “Your mother...she is looking out for you, you know? She only wants what’s best for you, and I can’t fault her for that.”
Draco laughed. “I’ve changed my mind. I’m so glad you’ve been here.”
Draco received a new batch of interns once every two years. It was something the theatre did as part of a partnership with the local university - the theatre would have a relatively wealthy board of investors, and the students would get some real work experience. The whole thing would sound quite good, normally. Harry thought it sounded like a good thing - if it meant Draco could spend more time out of work, then it had to be.
“It was sweet, actually. They asked if I was okay, and how I coped and all that.”
Harry sighed, fond. “Well, what is she like? Aside from being in the way.”
But that didn’t feel right. “Don’t lie to me.”
“Three to places!” he shouted.
Draco harrumphed.. “It’s nothing I could help, and it was a long time ago.”
Harry let out a wounded noise, looking for all the world as if he’d been hit with an unforgivable. “No.”
Harry stood up too, slowly walking towards Draco like a wildcat. “Oh, really?”
Draco sighed. “For one thing, they’re my kids too, now, and I don’t want any of them to get hurt.”
Harry kissed his head again. “Maybe it’s for the best. We don’t have to discuss everything right now - not when this is still so fresh, but at least they’ll have an inkling as to what to expect.”
Ella gasped. “No way.”
Draco sighed and took a drag of his cigarette, morose. He was ashamed enough of his actions during the war as is; he didn’t need Ginny Weasley of all people telling him he fucked up. He knew that. He accepted it. He moved on.
Harry, though, looked troubled. His brow was furrowed, wrinkling that iconic lightning bolt scar. His lips, usually formed into a great, wide smile, were pursed into a tight frown.
Harry sighed. “Me too, love.”
Draco sighed, stepping out onto the balcony. He snuffed out his cigarette in the ashtray in front of the daybed before saying, “Sure.”
Draco laughed quietly. “I know.” He paused. “Also, after the show, I suspect a man will try to come backstage to come and look for me. If he has a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead, let him through, yes?”
Draco tried to suppress a grin at her shock. “Didn’t you hear?”
“I’m not sure.” Draco bit his lip and received a smack on the arm. “Look, everything is okay. Tonight will just be...unexpected for you, and I just wanted to tell you that I love you.”
He was wrong.
Scorpius looked up. “Really?”
Draco liked his office. He supposed he’d have to since he ran and hid there whenever he was feeling too much, too fast. As such, his office was comforting, cast in the buttery light emanating from the Tiffany lamp on his desk. It held all the basic amenities: he had an electric kettle sitting next to the lamp and a couch laden with throw pillows and blankets pushed up against the far wall. There were pictures of his family and leftover programs hanging from the ceiling on little string lights. It was his home away from home.
It would make sense, all things considered.
Harry didn’t say anything, instead opting to pluck the cigarette from between Draco’s fingers and taking a drag of his own. “She can be,” he said on the exhale, smoke pouring from his nostrils.
Draco took another puff, then leaned over to tap the bowl of his pipe against the cork on the coffee table in front of them. “I was thinking about what you said last night. About Ginny. Did you write to the children?”
He sighed, announcing himself as he entered the sitting room.
And with that, the call was over.
Affronted, she replied, “Why would they need protection from me? I’m their mother.”
“Harry - Harry, I need you to come quick.” Draco sounded frantic on the other end of the line, his breath coming in short, quick bursts across the speaker. Harry tried not to wince. The other man - no matter how much he assimilated into muggle society - never seemed to catch onto holding the phone away from his face.
Ella laughed. Standing up, she said, “Now who says I don’t want to see that?” Draco wrinkled his nose and she laughed harder. She walked up to him and kissed him on the cheek, turning to whisper in his ear. “I can’t believe your fiance is Harry bloody Potter. You have some explaining to do, Malfoy.”
“What do you want to know?” God, he should have had this conversation with his boy years ago.
Harry hummed. “You shouldn’t be.”
Harry tried to stamp down any surprise in his tone when he agreed.
Some small part of him remarked that he had the emotional intelligence of a potato. Draco ignored it.
Harry struggled to hide his own grin behind his beer. The girl would be just fine.
He rolled his eyes, cupping Harry’s face with the fingers that weren’t holding the cigarette. “I have. Which is why I know I can handle your bitchy ex-wife. How did that go, anyway? After I left.”
They bowed again, this time all together as one conglomerate, and exited the stage. This time, all the main actors came up to him and told Draco how well he’d done, and how they were surprised he didn’t regularly audition.
“Fantastic,” Draco said. “I can’t guarantee I’ll be able to spend much time with you while the show is going on, and it might have some stop-and-go moments, but I think it’ll be fun for the kids to see. I saw this for the first time - I was about fifteen or so - and it was just dazzling, you know?”
She shook her head again, a small, sad smile on her face. “Neither do you. I’m not the one in love.”
And truly, Harry understood. It was frustrating to have someone stepping on your feet all of the time, especially if they kept screwing up. But he also knew Draco was particular on the best of days, and the poor girl likely just hadn’t found a way to fit into his routine. “Are you sure you’re not just being contrary because you like working by yourself?”
Ginny looked affronted, and Draco tried not to take too much joy from it.
His husband laughed.
“Harry,” Draco breathed. “Okay, so something has changed with the show.”
God, It wasn’t even eight-o’clock yet.
Until now.
And damn if Harry hadn’t aged well, Draco thought, sitting on his side of the bed and gently raking his fingers through the other man’s hair.
“Thank you, but no,” he said with a laugh. “I’m just fine backstage.”
Scorpius scoffed. “So?”
“Does it? They hated each other in the beginning. Even when they were together, they sometimes hated each other.”
Harry shook his head. “No.”
Truthfully, Harry was the only reason Draco didn’t open the door in his pajamas only to shut it in Genevra’s face and tell the wretch to leave.
Harry and Draco were seated on the sofa, debating whether or not to get Chinese or Curry.
Distantly, Draco concluded that Harry had probably taken the kids somewhere so that they wouldn’t be bothered. It was probably for the best, given what had happened that morning.
And oh, did that send a pang of something unpleasant in Draco’s heart. “I know,” he said. “But you still need to go rest.”
Draco grunted and flicked the ash onto the concrete floor. He’d vanish it later if he remembered.
“That, my love,” Draco tutted, “is an acquired trait.”
Draco sighed. This was getting even more depressing than he had anticipated. “I’m not quite sure. I....” he took a deep breath. “I stopped hanging out with all of them the day I took the Mark for their safety.”
“I didn’t know you had a son.”
Draco turned to find Harry already dressed, looking sheepish. He raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t know she’d be arriving so early.”
Harry combed his fingers through Draco’s hair and placed another kiss atop his head. “Are you ashamed of it?”
“See that you are, okay?”
Draco stepped back inside and headed for his and Harry’s bedroom. “Nobody expects me to be a camp old stage manager,” he agreed.
It was times like these when he desperately wished he could truly love her as a wife instead of a friend. She was the mother of his child, his dearest friend, and Draco knew he was doing her a disservice in his marriage to her.
Harry kissed the top of Draco’s head, then teased, “Slutty past and all.”
Luckily, they had continued their pub nights over the years. Draco demanded they meet up for drinks as soon as Harry told him the news, and Harry hadn’t wanted to at first.  “Draco, I can’t. The kids -”
“Does she even know we’re married?”
There was a reason he rarely interacted with the wizarding world. Aside from how he was one of the most disgraced wizards of his time, he didn’t like how every little thing reminded him of the war. It was why Harry took the kids to Diagon every year before school; why Draco had most of the magical things he needed delivered to them by owl.
“Yes, well,” Harry sighed. “Forgive me if it seems a little fake. Everything does, at the moment.”
Draco’s eyes went wide. Distantly, he realized that everyone in the dressing room was looking at him to see his response. He shook his head. “I do, but…”
He wanted to make a joke of it. He’d lost nearly everything now, and it felt like retribution. This was his penance for all the wrong he had done, and Draco was fine with it, honestly.
Harry gave him a look. “Draco.”
Ginny paused, looking pensive. Draco didn’t think she knew how to answer.
Draco sucked in a long breath. Harry rubbed his shoulder comfortingly. “Ah, yes,” he said slowly. “The famous Death Eater son of Lucius Malfoy. The one who should be rotting in Azkaban with his father’s corpse, instead marrying the Saviour of the Wizarding World. I’m sure that’s what you’re insinuating now, yes?”
“And I’m the Queen,” he scoffed. “Don’t lie, Genevra. It’s unbecoming.”
“Well, why are you so wound up about it?”
Everything went so silent it made their breathing seem loud.
Draco quickly went over what he said and winced. “I didn’t mean it like that.”
Harry decided to make his appearance at that moment, striding to Draco’s side and plopping a quick kiss atop his head. “Ginny does have her reasons, little one. And we will find them out in the morning, but for now, all of you little nargles need to go to bed.”
When it was his turn for curtain call, he ran onstage and bowed, grinning all the while. He waved at the audience all ant-like from the stage, and ran back offstage. Even with the break in between his character’s death and curtain call, he was still high off the rush of adrenaline that comes with every show.
“I didn’t know I was supposed to! We aren’t married anymore!.”
Harry had perfected the art of giving his all into everything he deemed worth it, and while Draco adored him for it, the habit was unfortunate at the best of times. Harry couldn’t possibly put his all into his marriage, and his friendship with Draco, and his relationship with his children, and his work. Something had to give eventually, and, well, now something was giving. It was just difficult for Draco to watch.
The other man sucked in a tight breath. Harry nodded, once, twice, thrice, then forced out a quick, “Thanks.”
There was no doubt in his mind that he would have a nightmare that night.
“Just because you don’t doesn’t mean you can’t, Draco,” Ella responded.
Draco groaned, pushing his face into his hands. “Can we just not talk about things? My family has done that for generations and I turned out fine.”
Harry shook his head. “I need you here.”
Draco sighed. “When did we get so fucking depressing?”
“Not exactly.”
But he couldn’t concentrate. Not now. For once in his life, he couldn’t compartmentalize what had happened in the real world and focus on the fictional.
“I know, and I don’t care. Anyone that makes the children feel so sad is not, and will never be in my good graces. Mother or not.”
Draco hummed. “It never seemed to come up.”
Draco hummed, quiet. “Poor thing.”
James elbowed his brother in the side, receiving a swat to the back of the head in return. “She’s our mother, dumbass. She wants to see us.”
He had one of those clear tenors that could ring in a room like a church bell on Sunday mornings, and somehow it maintained its clarity despite his weakness for a pipe in the evenings, and despite how little he utilized it.
“What do you do if you need to, I dunno, rant about a partner or something?”
“Draco-” Harry called, and Draco whipped around.
Draco huffed, slumping back into the corner of the sofa. “At the very least, I’m glad it’s you I’m married to.”
And, oh, what a loaded question that was. “You never asked, darling. I didn’t know you wanted to know about her.”
Harry wanted to disagree - Draco was one of the most beautiful men he had ever seen - but he huffed a laugh instead. “Where’s Astoria?”
Draco wrinkled his nose. “I usually prefer a pipe.”
“Really? I heard that Nott boy - Theo’s younger brother -” This time, Astoria threw a pillow at him, rolling her eyes and laughing.
This time, Draco did laugh. “No, I don’t think you would have.” At Harry’s gasp, Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh, don’t be dramatic. I didn’t tell you not out of a lack of trust, but a lack of relevance. It never came up.”
What would Scorpius think? He wasn’t Ginny’s son; she had no attachment to him. Would she treat him badly because he’s a Malfoy?
Draco elbowed his husband in the side. “That’s unimportant.”
Harry laughed again, his shoulders shaking. He let out a long breath and leaned into Draco’s side. “Well, we can’t have it all.”
“Okay, awesome. I’ll talk to Mia in costumes and see what we can do in the next twenty minutes.” Ella was starting to count the things she had to do on her fingers. “You need to go sit in makeup, and I’ll just do what you usually do. Can I see your iPad? It has the script on it, yes?”
“Oh.”
Draco waved a hand. “Oh, she’s so tiny. Can’t be more than 150 centimeters - which is why it’s so frustrating!” He sighed, a wry smile fleeting across his face so fast Harry might have missed it were he not paying such close attention. “But she takes all of my shit in stride - no tears or anything, which is admirable.”
He hummed, then laughed softly, shaking his head all the while. “We’re so fucked up.”
He looked at Harry, who just seemed sad and a little wary. He hated seeing that expression on his husband’s face; he never wanted to be the cause of it.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m sure you are.”
Lovingly, Harry nuzzled his face into Draco’s hair. “That we are, my love.”
Draco angled his head up from where it rested on his husband’s shoulder. He frowned. “I do.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, internally shuddering. The boys looked like every set of twins in every horror flick ever when they did that.
“Draco?” Harry called.
Draco pushed himself off of the jamb and went to sit cross-legged on the floor next to Harry, uncorking the bottle and taking a hearty swig in one fluid motion. “I don’t suppose the kids can hear this?”
Was he to answer the door looking like this?
“Wonderful. We’ll meet at the Three Broomsticks.” And that was that.
Draco scoffed. “Of course I am. Don’t ask stupid questions, Potter.”
How would he explain everything to the kids, he wondered. Draco knew Scorpius likely had heard of some of his past - the other children probably had as well, but, if they had, they never brought it up. Draco thought it was to respect his privacy, even though he and Harry had long ago established an open-door policy for any questions they had.
“Ah.” Draco coughed, uncomfortable. “Let’s not discuss that now.”
Harry nudged his shoulder, and Draco met his eyes. It felt like a challenge. “You know why.”
If he was being honest, Draco wasn’t ready for this conversation. He doubted he ever would be.
He could hear his husband sigh. “Nobody does these days.”
“Ah.” Draco held out the bottle.
“I swear, if this show gets a bad review because of a fucking intern, I cannot be held responsible for anything that may happen to them.”
Well.
He was silent for a minute, mulling over the words. “Not really, darling. I’ll be fine though.”
And Draco was fine with that, honestly. His work wouldn’t get too hectic until near the end of the month, and God knew he’d missed so many of the children’s’ things because of that, so it was only fair he take care of the children now.
Ella was young, fresh out of college and with enough energy to fuel a small house. She was small, probably only around 155 centimetres tall, and thin enough Draco worried she would float away with a strong breeze. Her sheet of black hair reached the small of her back, and her dark skin always seemed to glow, which Draco attributed to her youth. Ella was always smiling, always finding a reason to laugh, and, honestly, Draco loved her to pieces. She reminded him of Scorpius.
“She’s in the way, Harry. All of the time. And she does everything wrong!” Draco honestly looked like he was about to cry, and Harry figured it was best to start the man on water.
Draco did dance. Not only was it one of the unofficial requirements for his job, but he had also learned how to dance since he was a child before everything went to shit. His mother insisted upon it, said it would do him well later in life to know how, and she was right.
“Why do you want to take them now? Why not earlier, when we first divorced?”
Harry didn’t say anything, but Draco could tell he was just mulling over his words. Finally, he whispered, “You saw this coming, didn’t you?”
Draco sighed again and began walking to the corner store at the end of their block. He probably shouldn’t be comparing Astoria to Ginny, he thought. The two were incomparable, and, in the end, only one was alive.
And Harry was smiling that one smile that made Draco weak in the knees, the smile that was soft and happy and meant only for him. “You sap,” Draco accused.
Draco scoffed but didn’t say anything.
Harry’s mouth had dropped to the floor, and Draco wanted to laugh. “I didn’t know that.”
“To fucked up relationships, I guess,” Harry toasted with a wry grin.
Harry plopped a kiss on the top of Draco’s head. “What happened?”
He glared at his husband, tiredly. “Of course it is, Harry.”
“Why now?”
Draco grinned. “And so the Potter brood grows. God save McGonagall.”
“Oh, Draco, come on.”
“I just thought they might enjoy it better now they are older,” she said.
He settled on an emerald green turtleneck, tucking it into a pair of black denims cut to perfection. He pulled his flaxen hair into a messy knot atop his head and switched his glasses out for contacts, looking himself over in the mirror before deciding he looked good enough.
When Draco was a boy, he used to sing songs with his mother. In secret, of course, for Draco’s father would have never allowed it. Draco always thought he got his voice from his mother.
Were it directed at anybody else, Draco’s glare would have been scathing. Harry just took it as confirmation. He sighed, biting back a smile. “Give her time, Draco.”
Harry gave him a fond but strained smile. “Yeah, they did. Scorpius flushed scarlet.”
She tensed. “Albus said I should make things right.”
“I’m sorry,” Ella said with a frown.
“Why haven’t you fired them already, then?”
Ginny’s smug smile was scathing. “I’m not insinuating anything.”
“No, thank you.”
“Do you have any shame?”
Draco drew in a deep, shivering, breath. “And now, what do you feel for this person?”
Harry frowned, then nodded. “Yeah. McGonagall said it was fine with her; she’ll leave the decision to the kids. And the kids said it was up to us.”
“I’ll get it, love.”
“Ginny doesn’t care about that,” he pouted.
He wondered if it was too early to have a finger of firewhisky. Draco shook himself internally at that. Leave it to Ginny Weasly to drive him to daydrink.
“Harry,” Draco called, catching the other man’s attention. He nodded acknowledgment at Ron Weasley, who was staring at Draco in bewilderment, and waved a hand towards the kids. “I’ll take them to board, yeah?”
“Well, it’s not surprising considering she’s been away for so long.”
She hummed. “Not that much.”
They would be putting on Spring Awakening this season, and he couldn’t decide if he wanted to laugh or cry at the irony.
Harry’s son had been born that summer, and he took after his father. Little Albus - which, honestly, why would Harry name the poor thing after that old coot - shared the same bright green eyes and dark skin that Draco adored. The baby was fat and happy, as all babies should be, and Draco loved him like his own. Scorpius, who was just beginning to discover his own mobility, was fascinated by the newborn, and Draco just knew the two boys would be the best of friends.
Draco shook his head. “You don’t have to say anything.”
Draco turned around and stuck his hip out with a flourish. “Yes, darling?”
Draco nodded, perching on the edge of the sofa.
Draco’s flat was a muggle brownstone on the other side of London. He once told Harry he bought it because he couldn’t live with the memories that soaked the foundation of the Manor, but, while some part of that had to be true, Harry always suspected Draco bought the place because he liked how ordinary and quiet it was.
Draco rolled his eyes and sighed, standing up. “I’ll go wake the children. They’re likely still sleeping.”
When the kids did return, it was late.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, suppressing a shudder. “Do you know when you’ll be picking him up?”
When Draco emerged from the hall, he was rubbing his eyes tiredly and whoever he was talking to had gone.
he found an all-new sense of appreciation for the actors. But damn, if these lights weren’t hot.
“Careful, dear, you’re going to catch flies,” he said with a grin. He looked back in the mirror for a second before turning back to her. “How do I look? Not bad for an old man, I hope?”
She looked mildly terrified. “None of the chorus auditioned for Angel.”
“I’m coming to you. Where are you?”
If he could survive this weekend, that is.
The children each gave muffled replies, looking exactly as Draco felt.
Harry sucked in a breath. “I doubt it’ll get any better. I told Ginny I’d meet her for coffee tomorrow to discuss everything away from the kids.”
“Mark,” he drawled, coming to stand behind the man in his seat.
“Of course. They love you.”
She should be happy for them, Draco thought. They were happy, and in love, and they had found anything they could ever wish for in each other.
Scorpius had wished him luck in his last letter from Hogwarts, and Aunt Andromeda was going to come see the show with Teddy and Harry on Friday night. Pansy and Blaise weren’t able to make it since Pansy had a gallery running at the same time as the show, but they wished him luck, and Draco was content with that.
Draco huffed, but let it be, instead nuzzling further into his husband’s chest.
It felt as if all the anxiety he felt over the last week had culminated in this moment.
Harry hummed, sounding distracted. “We can argue that later. I’ll see you when I get home.”
Draco scoffed. “Obviously. You looked like a fucking ghost; that was how much it washed you out. There are few very specific shades of pink redheads can wear and that was not one of them.”
Owe him, Harry did. The night before Ginny was due to arrive, the kids all came through the floo. His darling husband wasn’t there to greet the children like usual since some emergency case came up and he had to leave only five minutes before the children arrived.
Draco smiled. “I love you too.”
Harry didn’t answer.
“He always worries,” Draco said, taking one last drag of his cigarette before standing up, tossing it on the floor, and stamping on the thing with the heel of his boot. “We should probably go home, then.”
Harry rolled his eyes, unruffled by Draco’s bleakness. “I’m sure the intern feels the same way.”
But he was curious.
Draco slumped back in the seat and groaned. “Fuck.”
In his more reprehensible moments, Draco thought about just kissing the other man and offering himself as a modicum of comfort. He would do it, too, if it wouldn’t upset and confuse Harry further than he already was. But he knew it wouldn’t be fair, and it would likely just make things worse in the end.
At this, Scorpius looked sheepish. “They are still outside.”
Somewhere along the way, Draco assumed Harry had told his other friends he was close with Draco.
“I know. And I’m thankful every day for that. But, Harry,” Draco was still playing with Harry’s fingers. “Ginny still sees me as the enemy. She always will, I think, and I can’t blame her for that. I just don’t want her to treat you or the children any worse for it.”
When Harry looked at him this time, Draco felt as if he was missing something. “No,” he said. “It isn’t.”
Autumn 2012
“Dressing rooms.”
Draco ignored the pang that shot through his heart at that. Harry was good. He was better than good. Harry was kind and strong, and beautiful, and Draco wanted him so badly it hurt. He didn’t say that, though. “I know.” He sent Harry a conspiring grin. “What was that quote from the film Jamie likes? ‘I’m the greatest good you’re ever going to get’?”
“Honey, that whole time was depressing as hell.”
He was in the middle of taking another drag of his cigarette when someone knocked on his door.
His son gave him a look. “Which one of them was your boyfriend?”
Albus and Scorpius froze, shooting each other frantic looks before synchronously turning to face Draco.
Harry followed him, grinning. “Oh, Draco, I’m sorry. I’ll take it back for a kiss.”
They nodded, small signs of guilt on their faces.
Despite having a vague idea of what happened, the children wouldn’t learn about the war until their seventh year. When Draco asked Harry why, he said it was because, by that time, they would be emotionally mature enough to realize that it was their parents who fought.
Soon, the open chords for
Ella shook her head. “Not much back here.” She nudged him with her shoulder. “You did really well. I even cried when Angel died. I never do that.”
Draco coughed, pointedly. “You’ve always been a little barmy, Potter.”
Draco nodded, then realized Harry couldn’t see him. “It went as well as it could have.”
When it all came down to it, Draco supposed, everything would resolve eventually. They still had to talk to the children about Draco’s past and his part in everything, but that didn’t matter. Not here.
“They lost their voice. Entirely.”
Draco nodded. “Sorry.”
“Maybe it’s good that they’re spoiled.”
He sighed. “Anyways, it’s not my decision. You have a right to see your children, obviously, but only on their terms.”
“Can we talk?”
Draco scoffed, vanishing the cigarette and the ash before sitting up to light a new one. “I’m not small where it matters, darling.”
That was the thing about mothers. They loved you unconditionally, but it always seemed to be hard for them to totally articulate it. Draco surely never would be able to explain that to little Scorpius, who wouldn’t even know what he was missing.
Draco huffed. “What the fuck could she want now?”
He lit one in the hallway and took a deep drag, disregarding the fact he was indoors.
Draco heard the front door slam open, and five boisterous voices echoing in the hallway. He smiled to himself.
Oh, Harry was a beautiful idiot with a kind heart and an excellent cock, but he was an idiot all the same.
Draco wanted to cry, to scream as he had when she passed. “She loved you more than anything.”
“I’m serious,” Draco said as he slid under the covers to cuddle into Harry’s side. “Very Dark Arts-ish and Slytherin things. Things my father would approve of.”
He could do this, he thought, briskly walking out of the room. It was only Ginny Weasely.
Draco didn’t really know what that would mean for him.
Her hair was falling down her shoulders in a sheet, her eyes bright and full of warmth. She had a tan, and so many freckles dotted her face it looked like a galaxy.
Draco looked at Ella and smiled. “He’s my pride and joy. He’s eleven now.”
Ginny’s eyes were wide, shock painted clearly on her face.
Ella was laughing as he walked up to her after that. “You get ‘em,” she whispered.
“Oh, fuck off. I just meant something else is going to come from this; I can feel it in my bones.”
“Love you, too.”
Draco let Harry slowly roll down the pants, gathering his thoughts. “My mother and I used to sing together,” he said eventually. “We would hide from father, usually in her drawing room or the atrium, and sing old songs.”
The girl nodded and smiled before running back to Draco.
His heels clicked against the linoleum as he picked up a box of smokes and a cheap plastic lighter. It had smiley faces on it.
It was exhausting, exhilarating work, he thought as he exhaled smoke on the balcony.
As soon as he reached the threshold, though, he heard a feminine voice call, “Malfoy.”
Draco rolled his eyes and huffed, “Good morning, Ella. I see you are tactless as ever.”
As the opening notes of
Draco’s eyes widened. “What.”
Ella blushed and nodded. “Anytime, Draco.”
“Fuck.” Draco looked around the dressing room, locating the clock in an instant. Six fifteen.
Harry shook his head. “No. It’s always been there.”
“I’m like one of those muggle rat dogs,” he interjected. “You know the ones; what are they called again? Chiwowowows? Cheetahs? Cheetos?”
With that, Scorpius scurried off to his room and Draco sighed, sinking into his chair.
“Oh, Scorpius,” Draco said. “She would have seen you whenever she wanted. And she’s still watching over us, you know.”
It was startling to see Draco seamlessly blending in with the muggles, but if anything, Harry could tell the man was in his element. At the very end, the director gave some notes, and then  Draco stood up to give some of his own, and Harry could see how comfortable the man was.
Draco looked up at Harry and his kids and gave them a tired smile. “Sorry if you heard me earlier - interns.”
Harry sighed and moved so he was closer to Draco. Draco winced, knowing it didn’t help the other man’s case.  “I told you, Ron. Draco’s my friend.”
A sigh. “A little goes a long way.”
“No one in the family mentions it, but you lost an uncle in the War,” Harry said. “Ginny herself almost died when she was in her first year. Those kinds of experiences take a toll on you.”
Weasley scoffed. “He’s a bloody Death Eater, Harry.”
When Harry and Draco had first gotten together - when they knew they were serious - they decided one day they would sit the kids down and discuss their respective pasts. Harry had anticipated it would come up after James learned it in History of Magic, but Draco always had a feeling it would be earlier. Guess he was right.
Harry hit his arm. Hermione swooned over their flirting. Even if it was odd it was still flirting. She loved seeing Harry happy. As did Ron. Although he didn't swoon. "Take notes for me in class today Hermione?" Harry looked at her.
He sighed. "Never ugly" he mumbled and placed his lips on the furthest up bruise, the one on Harry's chest.
Draco rolled over and kissed Harry's cheek. "Are you ok?" He asked softly. Harry was out of breath and sweaty. "mhm" Harry said throatily.  Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and kissed the top of his head. "I love you" Draco said. Harry smiled. "I love you too"
Draco slowly and softly sucked down Harry's collarbone. He softly licked and bit at the skin. Harry would moan and arch his back slightly every now then. Draco held his waist delicately. Harry let his hands fall down to his sides. Harry couldn't help but think, this felt like more than 'enemies with benefits'.
Draco cleared his throat and got up in front of everyone. "I have an image, an image I put up of myself. An image that I'm evil, cold, and heartless. Most of you wouldn't believe me if I told you I was none of those things, but it's true. I'm not any of the things I've made myself out to be. I cannot blame any of you for hating me, I've made it very hard for anyone to like me." Draco took a deep breath.
Draco found an envelope. He sat down on the bed with it. His trembling hands opened it. He found a simple piece of parchment. Draco opened it and began reading.
A sweet slow song began playing, they decided the wedding march was too traditional for them. Everyone rose to their feet. Sirius Black was walking Harry, he had been more of a father to him than anyone ever was.
"So then what did you need?" Harry said sitting up a little. Draco searched Harry's eyes. Harry had a look of sadness hidden behind his playful persona. His eyes glowed a gorgeous green as always. Harry looked...worn out. "Just.." Draco said making his way to Harry's bed and sitting down.
"Liar" Ron said chuckling. "I'm not a liar you prat" Harry said throwing some egg at him. "Malfoy looked..worried or upset or something" Ron said finishing his food.
Harry ground his hips up against Draco as he carried him. Draco squeezed Harry's thighs causing Harry to gasp. With the gasp Draco slid his tongue into Harry's mouth. Harry quietly whimpered into Draco's mouth. Draco's shirt had been left in the main room along with Harry's.
Draco pulled away. "You could've just told me to get up, not that i'm complaining." Harry smiled softly. Always softly. "I figured this would be much nicer" Draco smirked and got up. "Dinner is in 30 minutes, I'm going to put my robes on, you should do the same. I'll be back in 20 minutes." Draco smiled and left.
Bellatrix got up and walked to him, he grabbed her by the waist and they shared a very unnecessary sloppy kiss. Draco and Harry cringed and looked away. Narcissa was shell shocked, just standing in one place, frozen.
He realized he may be over sharing but by this point he didn't really care.
What Harry saw calmed his nerves instantly. "Dray" Harry said softly and wiped his teary eyes. Draco turned around and saw Harry's puffy red eyes and droopy posture. "Oh Harry I didn't think you'd be awake yet" Draco walked over to him and kissed him softly. "I'm so sorry I scared you darling" Draco took Harry's hands in his, rubbing the backs of them with his thumbs.
Draco moved over, closer to Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry tensed and felt his ears go hot. He heard Draco stifle a chuckle. "We're going to end up like this in the morning anyways, why not enjoy it all night" Draco said softly. Harry couldn't help but agree. He snuggled up to Draco. Harry laid his head down on Draco's chest and slung his arm over Draco's abdomen. "Now go to sleep so we can be up early, I absolutely hate being late" Draco said softly.
Harry did the same.
"You trust me Potter?" Draco smiled. Harry was at a loss for words. "..I guess I do Malfoy" Harry smiled a little.
"I'm so sorry Harry this is absolutely awful" Hermione said offering a wry smile. "Good luck with that bloke mate" Ron said, still stuffing his face. "I.. um.. It's fine I can do this I can stay civil and calm I'm mature enough..right?" Harry said looking at his two best friends for reassurance. They both nodded in agreement. The rest of the feast Harry sat there poking at his food barely eating any. It's not anything new or painful he's already used to not eating much so it didn't really affect him.
Draco studied Harry's face. He studied the way his nose curved. He studied the way his lips laid perfectly upon his face. Everything just fit right on Harry's face. He was made perfectly. Draco couldn't find one imperfection on Harry's face. His eyes flickered down to Harry's now marked up neck. Draco smirked, he left his mark. Draco smiled, satisfied with himself.
Draco felt himself loose control, his anger overtaking him. "Thank you Myrtle I promise to visit more." He nodded and stormed out of the bathroom and back into the Hall. He was stopped by Hermione. "What's got your knickers in a twist?" She scoffed. "Not now Granger" He shoved past her and walked over to Blaise and Harry.
They hugged him tightly before letting go, letting him walk up to the box where his lifeless love laid. Draco began walking up to his casket. He began walking up to see the man who was so full of life, dead.
'Seventh year' Harry thought as he walked through the streets of his 'hometown' Little Whinging. He made it all the way to seventh year without good 'ole Voldie killing him. Harry killed Voldemort before he had a chance to kill Harry. The battle had left Harry more than traumatized.
His Aunt Petunia would yell at him or slap him if dinner was cold or prepared later then she wanted. His cousin Dudley was just plain rude, he would make fun of Harry for being a 'freak' he would bring up Harry's dead parents every now and then. Although they were nothing compared to his Uncle Vernon. His Uncle Vernon was a monster. He had done unspeakable things to Harry countless times. That whole family was toxic, manipulative, and underhanded. Harry had hoped that soon he could scrounge up enough money to move out or maybe find somewhere else to stay.
"Yes of course" Draco smiled and kissed Harry. A long kiss. Draco held Harry's face. They finally pulled away. "What was that for?" Harry chuckled. "I'm gonna get as much of your lips as I can today considering I'll be without them for two whole days" Draco pouted. That wasn't the only reason. Draco wasn't 100% sure Harry was gonna come back as himself. He didn't know what Harry's relatives wanted from him.
Harry could see a a bit of sadness and emptiness behind Draco's eyes. Harry wanted to fill up the emptiness, he wanted to love Draco.
He got up and put his school clothes and robes on. He fixed his collar and looked at the marks on his neck, he smirked. Draco fixed his tie and his hair. He slid his shoes on and made his way to Harry's door.
"Thank you." Draco stepped down from the podium. There was a slight moment of silence before the hall broke out in applause. Draco smiled sincerely and thought for a second, maybe things would get better.
"Isn't Christmas just absolutely wonderful?" Narcissa said cheerily. "Yes, yes it is. Maybe tomorrow we could go to the city." Draco said with a smile on his face. Harry cuddled into Draco's side, Draco wrapped his arm around him. Draco caressed Harry's side with his hand. Harry smiled and kissed Draco's cheek.
Draco woke up around 7:20 am, the night had been awful he barley slept. He got up and yawned. Draco rubbed his sleepy eyes and dragged himself out of bed. He figured maybe Harry wasn't mad anymore, he would go wake him for breakfast and everything would be back to normal.
Draco's face was still very close to Harry's. Harry was trying to steady his breathing. Draco could feel Harry's soft breaths against his lips. Draco softly planted one more kiss to Harry's lips, capturing Harry's bottom lip between his teeth. Draco smiled and pulled away. "So Mr.Potter is a bottom" Draco chuckled and said lowly.
Bellatrix got up and walked to him, he grabbed her by the waist and they shared a very unnecessary sloppy kiss. Draco and Harry cringed and looked away. Narcissa was shell shocked, just standing in one place, frozen.
"Now c'mon" Harry got out of bed tugging on Draco's hand. "I am I am calm down" Draco chuckled and got up. He put his slippers on and handed Harry his. Harry slid his own on.
never the same again.
"I'm sure Dumbledore wouldn't mind, considering Potter is his all time favorite" Draco said chuckling. "I guess we could go" Hermione said smiling. "Oh and bring a plate for Potter he's hungry, make sure there's a little of everything, he needs to eat" Draco said to a now very confused Hermione and Ron. They were staring at him with a complete look of astonishment. Draco suddenly felt stupid. He should definitely not have said all of that aloud.
Draco unwrapped his arm once they were out of Snape's sight. "Always nice to give him a good scare" Draco chuckled. Harry burst out laughing. "Do you know how hard it was to keep my composure when you called him Sevy" Harry smiled.
"Here Harry" Narcissa pushed his pile of gifts towards him. Harry looked completely stunned, his face frozen with a large smile. "Thank you so much, you really didn't have to" Harry managed out. Narcissa shook her head and smiled. "You deserve it hon." She smiled and gave Draco his pile, then Bellatrix her's.
Harry looked up at Draco. Draco smiled down at Harry. A small soft smile. Harry had his heart completely. "No" Draco said. Harry furrowed his eyebrows and felt embarrassed. "We will be sleeping in mine, I much prefer my green" Draco smiled again.
"Tired?" Draco looked down at Harry and twirled a piece of his hair. "mhm" Harry grumbled and turned on his side. "okay love just rest, you've been through a lot." Draco played with Harry's hair soothingly.
"To ensure I don't wake you, sleep in mine?"
Draco looked down to see Harry Potter scrambling around for his glasses. Draco's heart skipped a beat when he saw how frantic and panicked he looked. Draco wanted to get down and help, but of course he didn't. He never did.
"Yes we will, I'll be sending a letter to check up on this in two days." He apparated out of the room. Bellatrix danced around, giddy with the excitement of knowing she could finally kill golden boy.
"Are we interrupting something or...?" They heard a voice and both jumped back from each other. Draco almost fell off of the bed and Harry caught him but quickly let go. Harry looked to see who it was..Hermione and Ron again. "N- no nothing why would you be interrupting something? M-Malfoy is gross there's nothing to interrupt" Harry said rambling on and catching his breath. Draco smirked. Draco hadn't even kissed him, he had barely touched him and yet somehow Harry was breathless.
