He had seen Malfoy at the end of the battle, when he had helped. The trials were all a blur to him. Mostly everything since the end of the war was a blur.
The trouble with the Ministry was not that it was as corrupt as before, it was that it was still in complete shambles even five months after the war. So many of the higher officials were arrested for dark magic and following Voldemort, and so many others his died, that there were simply not enough of age wizards to fill all the postions that needed filling.
“We did go out in Muggle London on Harry’s birthday,” Ron said. “We weren’t in imminent danger then.”
“School? I though you had graduated?” Vivian looked around the room at his trunk and all of his Slytherin gear thrown about the room.
Harry felt his face flame up, “Only the bits that I need to sign. Or that Featherstone points me too.” This earned another eyeball form Hermione.
Sorry in the delay of posting everyone. Just started school back up again and I forgot how hard college is!
“You do know that you can just send it with an owl, you don’t have to come all the way to the Ministry everyday to deliver it,” Featherstone motioned to put the papers on his desk. “It is nice that you are here though. How are classes going?”
“Half of her friends are in Azkaban!” Hermione said, like it was obvious. “Also some of them are dead, and some are still missing. And not because they were Death Eaters,” she pointed a finger at them, “or that they were bad people. It is because their parents were, some former Slytherins are missing because their parents hid them away during the war. Or that they were killed by Death Eaters because their parents defied Voldemort.”
“So,” the witch said setting down her quill and turning her full attention to Draco. “Welcome back to Hogwarts Mr. Malfoy.”
Ron continued to spot questions. “What about everyone else? Are they going to have to have an Eighth Year or are they all going to repeat the same year because of last year and the war? Is an eighth year going to continue until the current First Years graduate? And will they graduate with the year ahead of them because they will be the last group of Eighth Years?”
“Who even knows where he went?” The first voice said. The pair was getting closer and Draco was frozen in the hallway with the two people clearly talking about him.
“Things not fitting the same as they did in the tower princess?” A voice sneered from behind the couch the two boys were sitting at.
“I say Draco,” Victor said from his spot on the couch next to him. “That you blow off school and stay here. You never know how much further up you could make it in the company.”
“Draco,” she look up at him with her bright blue eyes. “Please don’t leave without saying goodbye. All of us.”
Draco looked up from the computer that he was typing on to where Roger stood, in his unimpressive suit and greasy hair that reminded him of his godfather. “Sure thing sir.”
“I thought that he was sent to Azkaban?” Hermione questioned. She got up to squeeze in-between the two boys.
This was his chance, there was no way that he would be able to do a nonverbal spell for this. He would have to be quick, he would not have time to raise his wand at the beginning of the spell.
He just hoped that would be able to continue when he got back to Hogwarts. He couldn’t bare going back to the way things were before. But only time would tell. If he wanted to find out he first needed to figure out a way to get back.
“I didn’t want to disappoint your mother,” Harry looked up at his best friend and then turned to look at Hermione who was next to him. “Or your girlfriend.”
The worst part about his flatmates was the fact that they seemed to really care about Draco, and he had little to no interest in them. There was Vivian and Kyle who Draco could hear through the thin walls of the flat. And then there was Vivian’s little brother Victor, who constantly kept making eyes at Draco and was the reason why Draco even lived there in the first place.
“You’ll call?” Victor sniffed. He seemed to be crying. From the goodbye or the sun Draco wasn’t sure.
Harry Potter was on his feet, wand in hand, and staring down his foe. Voldemort yelled the Killing Curse as Potter yelled another spell. Someone had grabbed Draco in order to drag him away from he two dueling wizards.
That seemed to cheer her up a bit. “Wait until the morning then?” She asked. “I’ll have Vic pick up some dinner and well break out the posh plates and everything. Yeah?”
There was no one really out, so he grabbed his trunks again and made the long treck up to the castle.
“Expelliarmus,” Potter said pointing his wand at Draco. The wand that he had borrowed flying out of his hand.
“As I was working with Featherstone this summer, I couldn’t help but notice that there are many children who are either missing or displaced due to the war in one way or another,” Harry said quickly, thinking that the Headmistress would interrupt him and tell him it wasn’t his place. “And as an orphan of the First Wizarding War, I was thinking. Or rather Hermione pointed it out to me, that I should be helping these kids. I don’t want these kids to end up like me with family who don’t want them. Or kids whose parents were Death Eaters having to face being sent away just because of choices their parents made. Some of these kids are only first years or younger. It’s just no fair.”
“Well, I’ve just been really busy with this project, and not to mention all the other stuff that I do for Featherstone,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck finally looking up at her.
“I feel like we have a responsibility to these kids,” Hermione said. “We are the reason that they are missing and all.”
“Alright then. But still try to call,” Victor laughed and then pushed Draco away. “Now go, you don’t want to miss the train.”
Molly had spent the remainder of the summer sighing that her boys were not going to graduate from Hogwarts. That they should be grateful that they were able to go back at all. That there were many kids not going back. And that they were lucky that they had survived the War at all, that last one was always given with a pointed look at Harry. And it really was the fact that she consistently called both him and Ron ‘her boys’ that convinced Harry to go back. She thought of him still as her son, even grown up and having defeated the Dark Lord. And he didn’t want to disappoint her.
“The war,” she said matter of factly. “We spent all this time looking for those who actively went against the Ministry and followed Voldemort. Not once have I heard a mention of helping to find the children that went missing. I’m sure that that one paper you had Harry wasn’t the only one. I bet there are hundreds of kids that are missing or displaced because of what their parents did.”
He closed his door behind him and look at the mess that was before him. Most of his belongings were packed. It was really just the muggle stuff he had gotten these past few months that were left. He packed up his three favorite pairs of jeans, a few shirts and a pair of boots. The rest he left. Just to prove to Vivian that he would return. At least at some point in the future.
“You do mean the list of kids that I gave you, right?” Hermione said as she sat on next to Ron and pulled the stack out of Harry’s hands.
“Yes, but we overheard the talk that she gave you over the summer before we went to Diagon Alley. Let me tell you mate it scared the shit out of me. I was sure that she was going to give me the same speech,” Harry shook his head. He had defeated Lord Voldemort the most dangerous wizard who ever lived, but he was terrified of what Mrs. Weasley would think of him if he didn’t go back and finish school.
“What?” He wasn’t sure what the professors angle was, but there was no way that he was going to be lured into the castle only for someone to kill him. Or worse, take him to Azkaban.
The problem that Harry had, was now that he was back in school he could no longer go out and help Featherstone find the people that the was looking for. Featherstone just sent Harry all the paperwork that needed to be looked over and sighed. Which Harry had done anyway when he was in the office. But along with all his school work and the growing pressure of the NEWT exams at the end of the year, things were really starting to pile up. He had already had to drop Quidditch, even though that had only because he had wanted to avoid talking to Ginny.
“I was wondering if there was a way for me to get, um, a new wand? I haven’t had one since,” Draco stopped and looked up at McGonagall.
“Potter, see me in my office after you last lesson,” she patted him on the shoulder as she passed. All Harry could do was nod and she was gone.
“Just so you know you coming back got me fifty galleons, so thanks for that,” Daphne smiled and lead Draco down the hall.
The Headmistress looked up from her work and gave Draco a smile. “Mr. Malfoy, thank you for being so prompt. Please come in.”
Draco swallowed and opened the door to his room. Vivian must have closed the window already. He placed the mug of tea on his desk next to the piece of yellow lined paper. If she had seen a bird it was possible that an owl had been here.
“That was his father,” Harry said, he reached over and grabbed the sheet out of Ron’s hand. “The last time I remember seeing him was…”
“These must be from the teachers room or something,” Harry replied. “There is no way that they came from a common room. They are terrible to relax in.”
After the Battle of Hogwarts he had simply just walked away. He had no wand, his father was in Azkaban, and he knew that if he went back then someone was either going to kill him or send him to Azkaban. It didn’t seem like anyone cared at all. His mother had not tried contact him, and no one from the Ministry had knocked on the door of the shitty apartment that he shared with three other people.
“Give the man a break ‘Mione,” Ron said around the toast he was inhaling. “He has enough on his plate already. Speaking of plate, are you going to eat that last piece of bacon?”
"I hope you don't mind, Harry's upstairs taking a nap. It's been ages since he's gotten off early like this. Merlin knows he needs the rest. I really ought to have a word with that boss of his, that man would work Harry to death if he could and Harry would let him. Anyway since Hermione isn't here yet, I assume she was held up with work again? Would you like the tea I made for her?"
Draco's world had been jumbled and it took a second to register that he'd fallen on his arse and a pretty-faced stranger was leaning down holding a hand out for him to take. His words lost to the loud thump of the music lulling behind them.
"Draco, my love, what is it? What's the matter, my precious pet? Was it too much? You know you can always safeword out. My sweet prince, tell me, please?"
. I'm sorry. I'm worried, I don't want him to go through what he did last year, not again. Never again. I couldn't survive it again, I-I can't-"
Draco pulled her hands off of the door and his wrist and held them in his own hands. He smoothed his thumbs over the back of her hands over and over again. He couldn't remember when his hands had gotten larger than hers and the thought saddened him a little.
When he made it to their door, dread filled his body as he saw a fist-sized dent in the wall next to it. Red staining it from whoever's bloody knuckles had met the wall. And he could hear faint whimpers coming from inside the flat. He heaved in a deep breath and knocked on the door lightly. The sound of crying stopped abruptly and he could hear scrambling just before the door opened.
"Have a lovely time trying to deal with Narcissa Black once she hears about all this, I'm sure she'll gladly put the fear of Circe into you herself." Harry laughed coldly, then turned and pulled a stunned Draco towards the hospital wing.
Draco blinked, then blinked again. Did he just...? His mind blanked as he watched the other boy grab him and pull him up. He stamped out the urge to cringe away. He really needed to get a handle on the no-touch thing.
The two boys exchanged a look which consisted of Harry glaring and Blaise studying him closely. A long beat of silence followed. If that wasn't awkward enough, Isaac decided to pull up on the curb, right at that moment, the headlights of the vehicle putting them all in a spotlight. Sometimes Draco swore he was in some bad romance novel. Ever the peacemaker Blaise offered him a hand to shake, which Harry took, albeit begrudgingly.
Harry shrugged off his hands and turned back around to storm up to Lucius, digging his wand back into the old wizard’s throat. The older man flinched at Harry's actions and went to speak again when he cast a silent
"Ew! Get a room," Pansy gagged tossing throw pillows at them until they broke apart laughing, childishly sticking their tongues out at her. And all Draco could do was smile. He couldn't ask for better friends. He didn't know how he managed to grow up with the least judgmental and most kind-hearted people he'd ever met, especially since they all had such horrid parents to deal with, but he was grateful.
"Sorry, what can I do for you?" He sighed, finally taking in the boy in front of him. He was quite...handsome.
"Both of you look at me." Blaise snapped, his tone reminding Draco of Mrs Zabini when she was cross. Pansy turned to face him as did Draco and he continued in a firm voice.
He watched as Draco yanked his arm from Lucius and hurried over to help him up with a soft smile that Harry returned. Harry held firmly to the blond's hand and gave it an encouraging squeeze as Draco faced his horrid father.
A/N Hey, I'm not sure who all is keeping up with this but my school starts up again tomorrow so I don't know how often I'll be able to update once that starts. Everything is going to be chaotic bc we are doing completely online for the foreseeable future. I'll try my best to keep up with this story! Thanks for reading!! (And please comment bc I loveee to hear from you!)
"Lord above, I don't know, Blaise. This is all such a mess!" He groaned, dropping his head in his hands as he went. Draco heard Blaise sigh as he tugged Draco's hands off of his face.
"No it's alright, Dean's just a nosey git. I used to be the same about touching, I get it." Dudley said casually as he returned his gaze to the game unfolding in front of them. Draco watched as Harry kicked the ball towards their imaginary goal and Seamus blocked his efforts. Then it clicked.
"That- that sounds good. I think I'll do that. Just-not today, and I don't...I don't know if I'd be comfortable sharing it with-with all of your friends but maybe just you, Luna, and Dudley would be okay."
Draco's hand rested on the doorknob as he pulled the heavy door open only to have it slammed shut once again.
"Dray, calm down. Breathe. It's okay." Luna said calmly using her free hand to stroke his arm, but all he could feel was panic and his throat felt like it was closing up and he couldn't breathe! He couldn't
"Alright, alright. Slow down, Ron." Harry said softly as he took the glass out of his hand before he could chug the rest of the drink. Maybe Firewhiskey hadn't been the best call. He set down both of their drinks. It would probably be best if he was sober for whatever this was.
At that moment a young man, looking more than a bit skittish, opened the door. He was a head shorter than Draco with startlingly green eyes framed by round, crooked glasses and messy black hair.
Harry groaned again, they weren't helping. What use were best friends if they couldn't even bother giving him some real advice or stop snogging each other all the time? He was better off talking to a wall at this point.
Harry paused and took another deep breath while Draco steeled himself for whatever horrors he was in for hearing. He knew there was something wrong with Harry's muggles because of the immense aversion he had to the idea of visiting them or even speaking about them but he hadn't known exactly what.
"Nah, not my fight, mate. I'm not about to get in between that." Ron shook his head, and let Hermione continue.
him, it made Draco's skin itch. But he didn't see anyone who looked even remotely familiar. It made Draco want to curl up and hide.
This was going to be brilliant. A new start. Far away from his family, their dirty money and nothing stopping him from pursuing whatever and
"I-ahem-sorry. I heard shouting and it sounded like someone had gotten hurt. I wanted to make sure everything was alright. I recently moved into the flat just beneath you." Draco explained with an awkward smile. He desperately resisted the urge to ask about the markings on his neck. People never seemed to appreciate his overly observant tendencies.
He feels Harry's hands trail down to his thighs straddling him and then up to hold his hips. Harry draws circles into his skin with calloused thumbs. It's soothing in a way that Draco still feels he doesn't deserve but he lets him anyway. He's too weak to resist any comfort given to him.
"Luna and Gin went to the guest bedroom to...well anyway, when they opened the door they found Nott on top of you, the pair of you were shirtless and you were struggling. Gin hates guys like that. Ones who take and take and don't ask permission first. She jumped at him and dragged him off, gave Nott a good beating, broke his nose too. Then she came and found me and I shut everything down, made everyone leave. This should've never happened. The party was for fun not some easy cover for arseholes like Nott to victimize-"
Draco knew he probably looked like a disaster, eyes red and puffy, tears streaming down his face covered in pink splotches no doubt, but Harry looked at him like he was priceless, even now.
"You know, Draco, that was very stupid of you. Going up to their flat like you did, several times apparently. Not telling anyone." Pansy said absently, not asking for an explanation, but simply stating a fact. Draco looked at her, her eyes still focused on the telly, not bothering to look at him as she spoke. He'd hurt her. He knew he had, she was his best friend and he'd gone to Blaise and hadn't even mentioned the topic to her other than the one time they'd all heard the commotion upstairs.
Before he managed to wander into the kitchen and ask if he could help with dinner, he was swept up by Harry, whose arms wrapped around his waist from behind. His fiancé pressed kisses to the back of Draco’s neck. The tension he hadn’t realized he’d been carrying seeped out of his shoulders. He lent back into Harry’s strong arms and exhaled contently.
Draco scrambled off of him and offered a hand to pull him up only to release him at the last second making Harry fall on his arse all over again. He let out a puff of air and Draco smiled down at him sweetly.
Worry spiked in his chest as he turned the stovetop off again. He quickly grabbed his keys and found himself locking the door and walking down the hall. Even if he was acting a bit paranoid, he couldn't ignore what sounded like a domestic gone bad, especially not when it sounded so violent.
"I'm s-sorry," Harry hiccuped, leaning against Draco, "I n-never meant to drag you into this. It's all-all m-my fault."
"I had fun," Draco said, then glanced down at his shoes before continuing, "Thank you, for telling them about my touching rule. I appreciate that and your friends aren't so horrible now that I've spoken with them more."
"Well, as much as you've made 'Mione's blood pressure rise, I thought it was funny. 'Course if you're pining after the bloke I wouldn't suggest attacking his best mate."
This is why they all worked so well as friends. They all had posh, traditional (homophobic), filthy-rich, old-English families. And they were all massive homos, despite how much Draco's parents tried to deny it.
"Well, it's nice to meet you. Again." Draco laughed awkwardly, "I'm usually not so forgetful with names, sorry about that."
Sirius scrambled off of Remus and sat up properly, worry marring his face as he took in the sight of Draco in front of him. His hair looked dishevelled, he had red-rimmed eyes and he had that far off look on his face that was never good news. A look that haunted Sirius' nightmares. He grabbed Draco's chin and moved his head about looked him over to check for any ill received markings. At the very least he could thank the heavens he didn't see any physical marks.
One of the blonde boys said as he settled in next to Draco, leaving a considerable amount of space between them. He was silently grateful for the consideration all of them had been showing him with his no touching rule. He guessed Potter-
"I couldn't hate you, mate. You were my first friend ever, you fought alongside me through a war, you even pushed me to go after Draco despite everything he’d done to you and your family. I couldn’t hate you, Ron.” Harry said calmly, patting his shoulder. He wished Ron would just come out and say it. This amping it up was making him anxious.
Draco can feel his gaze on him filled with its usual encouragement and tenderness. He presses a kiss to Draco's hair.
Harry hated seeing him like this, so nervous and insecure, so unlike the snarky and confident Draco he knew. Just as Harry was going to wrap him in a hug, Draco shot up, off of the bed. His body was a jumble of anxiety as he wrung his hands together.
"Th~thank you, m~master." Draco slurred, smiling at him like he was God-sent. Tears ran down his flushed face, his silver eyes glazed over from the pleasure. Fuck, the sight of his pet coming untouched and looking so utterly wrecked was mouthwatering. And knowing only
“Bloody fucking hell! I did not need to know that,” Draco sputtered, his face twisting into a grimace. He truly needn’t know what it is Granger may or may not have
"It's alright, my love, you don't have to tell me. I'm sorry I shouted. I won't do it again. I never want you to feel unsafe or scared, not with me, not ever." Draco apologized leaving a kiss at Harry's pulse point.
"That's it! I am going to slaughter whomever this prick is, what was his name Draco? I swear to heaven above I will maul the bloody bastard!" Pansy snapped as she jumped off the bed and began to angrily pace the perimeter of the room.
"But, nothing, love. If you can see me for more than just my blood, then I can do the same for you."
Harry pulls his inconsequential and fragile-looking hands, a dangerous deception seeing as what they're capable of, down against his chest. The action makes Draco flinch. He puts his large and callous and warm ones over top of them keeping them pressed into his shirt till he can feel Harry's heartbeat. It unconsciously soothes him. And he hates himself a little for relaxing even the slightest after he did something so heinous.
"But-but Draco, you have to-please we're friends right? Let me apologize!" Hermione nearly shouted in her desperation, trying her hardest to catch a glance of her husband over Draco's shoulder. Not for long, Draco thought somewhat bitterly.
He can physically feel wetness hitting his cheeks, it makes his mouth twitch down, eyebrows scrunch a little. That shouldn't be happening.
"Oh um, I changed schools last year. I go to Durmstrang now, better sports scholarships come in there," Harry shrugged. He gave Draco a hopeful look, "So, will you come?"
Draco continued to cry into Blaise. He hated this. Hated that he was so mentally hijacked by the mess his life had become. He thought moving might help, but Nott had managed to mangle that idea quickly enough. And now his best friends were a city away from him because of his own stupid decisions. He felt hopeless.
Draco finally managed to pull out what he was looking for and smiled at his success as he filled the kettle with tap water and turned the gas stove on.
"Sorry I grabbed you like that, I didn't know how else to calm you down. I know you don't like being touched but it always works when my cousin has one of his...um...his father was horrible, but, anyway, sorry." Harry scratched the back of his neck guilt written all over his face. And Draco just stared.
“Yes, I expected as much. Bloody Gryffindors and their need to hold grudges.” She said flippantly, throwing her manicured hand about as though to wave away the thought. Draco soured at the comment. His silver eyes narrowed at her and he sat up, properly this time, to watch how she reacted to what he said next.
Draco shook his head and manoeuvred their bodies so Harry sat straddling him with his hands rubbing at the tears tracking down his face. He moved Harry's hands away from his face and cupped his jaw with tender hands.
" Draco huffed angrily and blew his hair out of his eyes, it was completely unfair. Dad fixed him with a pointed look and Draco almost felt bad about interrupting Papá. Almost.
"I think not! He won't be seeing the likes of you anymore, not while he lives under my roof. You've filled that boys head with enough nonsense and I won't stand for it!" Vernon yelled, then promptly slammed the door in his face. Draco was fuming.
"Where are my shoes?" Draco asked stumbling to his feet, patting down his jeans for his phone. His limbs still felt wrong and his hands were still shaky but he had to leave. He had to go home. Oh God, Papá would be worrying himself sick by now.
"I sent Luna and them out...I just...she looked like she was going to be sick and I didn't think it would help."
"Draco, darling, why exactly did you wait till now to tell us this?" Pansy asked quietly, "We've been calling for the past week and you never mentioned any-"
Then promptly sank to his knees too and wrapped his arms around Ron's shoulders. Draco pulled Ron into his chest and let the other man cry into his shirt. Ron had never called him by his first name before, let alone had an entire break down in front of him. And Draco had never been more worried about his friend.
The fact that he was trying so hard to apologize alone should've been proof enough that he was nothing like Riddle. Riddle never apologized. He had a knack for pinning everything on Draco instead. And yet, some part of him was still a little paranoid anyway.
The soft earnestness in his pretty green eyes halts all sorts of arguments from leaving his mouth. Draco sighs and relents.
"It's been a while, Harry," Hermione said lightly, she looked like she wanted to pull him into a hug but she didn't. Draco assumed Pansy had let them know how Harry could be about touching sometimes. Something Harry had finally gotten past with Draco and Pansy a few months ago.
"Then I suppose I'll never step foot in this hell forsaken manor again. Good riddance." Draco said haughtily his lips curled in a disgusted sneer, one his father had taught him. Then he turned on the balls of his feet and sauntered towards the front door with an arrogant sway to his hips as he went.
"It's alright," Draco whispered, stroking Ron's hair as he cried into his chest, "It'll be alright, Ron, you'll stay with us tonight and we'll sort this all out tomorrow."
The pair stood staring into one another's eyes until Harry heard Ron shout from somewhere within the crowd.
"What's- Draco? Bloody hell! Love, you okay? What's wrong? What happened? Merlin, please tell me he didn't hurt you."
"Merlin's balls, what's going on? Draco?" Harry asked more forcefully this time as he fully stepped into the room, all of the sleepy-eyed confusion leaving his body. Draco looked straight into his eyes and gave him a meaningful look.
"It's really nothing, it's only...he was right, what he said," He made a vague gesture at the dead body behind him, "I'll never be able to bear you any children, never be able to give you a family. It's-sometimes-sometimes I'm unsure why you chose me. You know who my parents are, whom I'm promised to. You know I can never give you anything other than grief and hardships. You are far too good, too kind, for the likes of me. And I know staying with you, loving you, letting you love me, it's...it's selfish of me. But I cannot help it and I-I'm sorry."
Harry eyed him suspiciously like Draco might take back his words or break out into cruel laughter over what he'd just suggested. Draco reached up and ran a hand through his hair and licked his lips, trying to find the right words to say.
“Harry, baby. It’s me, Draco. Come back, love, it’s okay. I’m not cross. You’re okay and in a safe place. It’s alright.” He said firmly, trying to coax his boyfriend back to reality and away from whatever horrid flashback that had put him in such a catatonic state.
With that he drew back and smiled venomously, patting the older man’s cheek. It was a purely condescending gesture and Harry watched as Lucius angrily threw his head in the opposite direction of his touch. Like he was poison, like it burned. Harry hoped it did.
"No!" Harry shouted, then quickly regained his composure and continued, only, quieter this time, "I mean no, I just thought you might like to come."
They stayed like that for a while, Draco taking in the breeze and darkening sky while he traced random patterns into Blaise's skin. A calmness overtook the pair, just as the sun dipped out of existence Draco's porch light clicked on and bathed them in yellow light. After the long and comfortable silence, a smirk found its way onto Draco's face.
Bloody hell. He hadn't meant for it to sound like that. Draco noticed his parents sharing a worried look, having a silent debate about him right in front of him. He hated when they did that. It made him feel broken. Like damaged goods. And he was
Draco was silenced by Harry's lips kissing him. Draco melted into the action letting him take control of it. So Harry did. He pulled Draco into his lap, one hand cupping his face tenderly and the other resting on his lower back. Harry felt Draco's fingers lace into his hair and tug lightly.
"Well he's throwing a party at my house this Friday around eight and a bunch of other Hogwarts students will be there. You can come as well if you like. I figured it might be a way for you to make some friends since you're new to their school." Harry explained a goofy smile found its way onto his face as he finished speaking. And Draco would have found it cute if he wasn't so distracted by what Harry was saying.
"You know, I haven't the faintest idea why you feel the urge to smother me in your so-called protection. I see no reason for you to act like this, we've barely just met. And another thing-"
"I'm glad you're alright, Black. I'm sorry that happened. If you ever need anything ‘Mione and I are always here in case this git," He jabbed a harsh finger into Harry’s shoulder again, making Harry scowl and flick his finger away, "Isn't around with his bloody hero-complex to save the day."
," Ron grinned, turning to face Blaise and yanking him down by the collar till they were full-on snogging for nearly an entire minute.
"Pansy, this is not the time for that," Blaise said firmly giving her a pointed look as he pulled Draco further against him, leaning his back against the wall and wrapping his arms around the blonde protectively. Pansy let out a disbelieving noise and folded her arms as she continued to pace.
"It's alright. Not every day you get a" --he looked him up and down then beamed-- "cute french boy falling for you, now is it?" The boy said licking his cupid's bow lips.
Pansy opened her mouth and whether it was to argue, cuss at him, or hex him, Draco will never know because he simply continued, refusing to give her the chance to interrupt.
shields cracking and he lets them slide away, a violent sob clawing its way out of his throat. It leaves his mouth and makes him feel raw and exposed. It's heart-wrenching and frightening how broken he sounds. And it
. He glanced around the flat once more and realized how common Pansy would certainly find it. It wasn't overly cheap, or run down but it was nothing compared to either of their childhood homes. The flat had only three rooms: a bedroom and bath, the living and dining area, and the kitchen. She would be mortified.
And in spite of the circumstances, Harry smiles at Draco. He smiles like Draco hung the sun, the moon, and all the stars. Draco can't help but think that Harry is the one who should be smiled at in that way. He's the one who will save them all as much as Draco hates the very idea of him having to. It should have never been his job in the first place. He was-
"You're going to hate me," Ron said, his voice sounding empty, as he looked at anything but Harry. What was he talking about?
"Harry," Draco sighs a little, "I really wish you wouldn't tell me these things without discussing them with Dudley be-"
Draco followed him through the crowd of tipsy teenagers, most of them grinding on each other to the loud music that thumped throughout the house. He preferred the back room they'd been in, it was more private and had less of the blaring noise. It also happened to have fewer people to deal with. Out here Draco felt as if he couldn't breathe.
was all he could manage to choke out before tears made their way down his face and he was swept into strong arms. They stood like that for a while, Blaise running a comforting hand up and down his back as he cried from all of the worry and the frustration he had about Harry. Sometimes he felt so bloody useless.
After he had fixed his own wand with the Elder Wand he no longer had any use for it. And seeing how he had never seen Malfoy since then there was never a time to give it back. The only time this summer that he had seen a Malfoy was during the trials. Which he knew that there was no way an intern for one of the most influential Auror’s could go up to the wife of a Death Eater and hand her a wand.
Harry let a small laugh escape him. “Not that Professor. I was wondering if you would be willing to help me in a project that I am trying to put together to present to Auror Featherstone.”
Draco worked through the rest of the day without any problems. Except for having to tell the boy who worked in the cubicle beside him to cut it out with the smoking. It wasn’t even the fun kind, and it gave him a headache.
“Do you want to take a break from the work? I’m sure that a lot of paper work atop of all your NEWT levels must be a lot,” Featherstone offered as he pulled the stack towards him. “I really don’t think that Professor want to get so me random Auror work for your assignment. Nor do I want to get your Transfiguration homework.”
“You’ve been driving the Golden One mental not being here. Just so you’re aware,” Daphne said, her smirk deepening. “It’s only been a week but I’m sure he was going to combust any day now if you didn’t show up.”
“That’s excellent Harry,” Hermione said from where she was tucked into Ron’s other side. Harry was thankful that for the moment that he was in some random wing of the castle and not in the common room where he would have to run into Ginny, the summer at the Burrow had been awkward enough after they had called it off.
Lastly, he packed a single picture. It was one of all four of them that someone had taken in a bar over the summer. They all looked so happy, even Draco was smiling. He couldn’t remember another photo that had a smile as genuine as that. The photo didn’t even move, but that was okay with him.
Hermione rolled her eyes at that. She reached over and grabbed pieces of parchment off the top off the pile. “Theo Nott, age seventeen, last seen before the Battle of Hogwarts. Gemma Flint, age twelve, last seen December 1997 when leaving for Christmas break. Draco Malfoy, age eighteen, last seen at the defeat of Voldemort. Marcus King, age fourteen, last seen March 1997 leaving fo Easter break. It goes on and on Harry, they are all missing kids. Do you even read the papers?”
"Awe, love. It'll be alright, tell me what happened. Please?" Harry said holding Draco's face with soft hands. He sniffed a little and buried his face into Harry's neck. And he felt Harry's arms wrap around his waist holding him close.
His pet draped his arms around his shoulders, straddling him. His frown wilted into a devilish smile, teeth bared. Harry raised an eyebrow at him wrapping his broad arms around his back. Draco's pretty eyes flashed mischievously as he twisted his fingers into the hair at the nape of Harry's neck and tugged deviously.
, that someone would walk in and stop Theodore. He wished he had never left the house. All he wanted was his dad and his papá. He wanted to wake up to Blaise's snoring and Pansy poking his cheek and realize this to be one horrible nightmare. But this wasn't a nightmare and this boy was
"My cousin, ever the charmer isn't he? Come along Ron, Hermione, we'd best leave Harry to entertain his guest. Fancy a drink?" Luna said airily pulling the couple along with her, leaving Harry and Draco alone.
"You can stay here, and we'll figure it out, you know my parents love you. And he's your father and you are allowed to love him even if he is a complete wanker. Don't worry, love, we'll figure it out, I promise." Harry whispered and Draco curled his body into Harry's. He let the tears run down his face quietly and closed his eyes.
date-rape drug and I was felt up. Same bloke tried to take advantage of me, I passed out, oh and then had another panic attack. So that's how that went."
"I'll try my best," Draco replied as Blaise pulled him into a bear hug and planted a kiss on each of his cheeks and his forehead for good measure. Draco cracked a small smile and watched as his best friend walked to where they'd dumped his bag on the floor and swept it up. He climbed into the back seat then rolled down the window as Isaac pulled out of the driveway.
“Oh-ho-ho, can’t wait till the wedding can we boys? So desperate for it you’d risk a go in the living room while mums in the room over, are we?” The redhead cackled as George appeared after him, throwing an arm around his twin.
He smiled fondly at the thought, his gorgeous wife with her tongue poking out of her mouth as she concentrated on reading something. He still couldn't believe someone as brilliant and beautiful as her had married him not even after being married for over two years.
Harry watched as a delightful laugh bubbled out of Draco. His eyes crinkling at the corners and a delicate hand flying up to cover his mouth. He grinned back at him as they stood on the porch of Draco's front door. He had such a pretty laugh.
Narcissa let out a shrill sound of disapproval and dug her fingernails into her husband's arm. "So help me, Lucius, you'd better take those words back this instant or I'll make you regret it!" She hissed, her face pinched with motherly anger.
"I can't really remember, everything's sort of fuzzy, I think he put something in my drink. What happened? What did he..."
"I don't send anyone to stalk you!" Harry sputtered. He didn't! He just sort of had his friends watch out for Draco was all. That wasn't stalking it was being... neighbourly.
Draco could practically hear the blush in Harry's voice as he spoke. He let out a startled little laugh, of course, Harry told his parents about him.
"You were right, Harry! Father even suggested he take us to London Pride this year, all of us. Wouldn't that be lovely?" Draco babbled happily, finally facing the rest of his friends. The others nodded happily along, scattered responses of congratulations coming from the other four.
"But I do. I never explained why I was such a prick for that entire year." He said taking a deep breath as he looked up at the ceiling. He could feel the tears pressing against his eyes already. He just wanted this to end!
Harry sighed heavily and dragged a hand through his hair. He hadn't meant to be a hassle. He also hadn't meant to nearly bite off Draco's friends head, or boyfriend maybe, they
sorry for how long this took. I underestimated my classes abilities to completely drain me off any sort of creative energy, otherwise I would have had previously written chapters so I could try and post more regularly. I promise I'm still trying to write and such, but bear with me as I try to figure out how to split my focus enough to do so. I hope you enjoy and thank you for understanding! As always please be safe while reading! <3
Draco's nerves had since calmed. He'd quit his pacing and settled himself against the headboard of his bed, his free hand fiddling with the sheets. Harry's rambling always seemed to pull him away from any unnerving feelings he had towards the other boy. He was just so painfully
"I'm fine. Where is my phone, what time is it? Where are my shoes?" Draco huffed helping himself up and shrugging away from Harry's hands.
"I-" Draco stopped himself and thought a little. He didn't just want to leave it at that. As much as he didn't want to intrude, he felt worse, leaving without offering any sort of lifeline. Then he'd be like every other occupant in this building who hadn't done anything about this.
Draco, in between those two moments, had risen and elegantly jumped from the dais, bare feet silent on the tiled floor, as he threw carefully aimed daggers killing Harry's advisor. The blond sauntered over towards the body, hips swaying as he went. Bloody hell was he gorgeous. Harry watched him let out a noise of disgust, nose wrinkling adorably as he bent down and retrieved his obsidian daggers coated in tacky blood. The sight made Harry's mouth water. The red silk tied round his waist leaving nothing to the imagination, his round arse on display for Harry's pleasure. Draco wiped the knives off on Pettigrews clothes till they were clean and then reholstered them on his thigh strap.
"I'm so sorry Blaise. You'll have to forgive Harry, he hasn't been feeling himself all day and it seems his foul mood has clouded his better judgment."
"Are you implying I don't have friends?" Draco arched his eyebrow in a questioning manner as Harry fidgeted more. That
He dug his fingers into Draco's waist painfully, pulling his body flush against him. Draco put his hand on top of Theodore's and tugged lightly, hoping to loosen his grip or even get out of his grasp completely as the other boy swayed with the music. He didn't seem to notice and Draco's face burned with embarrassment and shame as Theodore made Draco grind up against him. He hated this. He shouldn't have come. He wanted to throw up.
Draco's brain sort of short-circuited at that. Harry didn't want to know what happened? He only wanted to know how not to trigger him? W-what? Sometimes he swore Harry was too good to be true. Or maybe he was just a really good liar.
His words are calm and soft-spoken but the way his eyes are fixed on Draco makes them so much more intense and concrete. And he isn't wrong. Draco had had the same conversation with him before. But that time he had been the one to hold Harry as he cried over the death of Sirius Black, of Dumbledore, of Cedric Diggory, of Alastor Moody and blamed himself for them all. But it's different. Those were all good people who lost their lives to Death Eaters and Draco, Draco
Before Draco could finish his sentence Theodore had grabbed him by the waist and began dragging him along towards the sofa. His brain detached itself from his body and while it screamed in disapproval his body stayed pliant and allowed the other boy to manoeuvre him easily.
"Naughty pet, aren't you?" Harry murmured, nosing along Draco's chest, up to his milky collar bones, kissing softly as he went. Draco let out a frustrated puff of air and squirmed down into Harry's lap. He wanted more friction, touch,
He howled fury making his entire body shake as he slammed his hands down on the dinner table. He was so
It was finally Friday and he had agreed to meet up with Harry and his friends at the park for a picnic. Dad had fussed at him about what he should wear and made him bring an extra jacket just in case he got cold while Papá gushed over him and how proud he was that Draco was finally putting himself out there and making friends. It was all a bit much but he'd taken it with a smile and slipped out of the door quickly enough to avoid any overly emotional group hugging that would ensue.
"His name is Leonidas Baros. The name's Greek. It means lion strength," Draco laughs wetly through the new wave of tears that cascade down his cheeks, "Not a bad name for a first-year Gryffindor is it?"
"Now, you are going to tell us exactly as much as you want or need to. We'll discuss whatever you want, leave out the bits you don't, then I'll hunt-"
"Don't ever regret caring about others the way you do. Not ever," Blaise held his gaze fiercely, "You've saved all of us from ourselves countless times and you make us better people because of who you are. Never wish to be apathetic."
Lucius looked up from his work, taken aback at the outburst. He set the parchment down and folded his hands tightly. After fixing his composure, he raised a calculating brow at Draco from across the long table.
"No, Sirius, we both sent him to that party. We agreed he needed to get out. This was neither of our faults."
Draco yelled back. He watched the car fully disappear out of his neighbourhood before the half-smile dropped from his face. He returning his focus to Potter and fixed him with a scowl. Dear, Lord was this going to be irritating. He could already feel the urge to roll his eyes building up.
He'd spent the better part of the day feeling empty and lifeless. No tears had made an appearance and he hadn't crumpled to the floor sobbing just yet, but he hadn't planned on feeling so worthless after telling his father everything either. Draco had mostly felt numb.
"They said if he liked muggles so much they would show him how vile and primitive they were," His voice shakes as he speaks and he feels sick and dirty all over, "How-how d-dangerous. They-they cut him to pieces, Harry. I couldn't-I couldn't help him."
"Draco!" The quick snap of Dudley's voice drew him back out of his head, "Stop thinking for a second. Focus on something else. Here."
"I've gone up to check before. Harry lives up there with his uncle, I suppose. He looks about our age, maybe a little younger. And he had bruises on his neck, Theo, like hands-choking-you-out sort of bruises, I doubt they were consensual." Draco said, feeling his anger simmer at the reminder of it. Blaise hushed Theo from continuing his disapproval and nodded at Draco.
Harry nodded mutely and let Draco clean him up once Pansy came back with the supplies, although convincing him he had to let go of Draco before he could do so had been a struggle.
"Hey it's alright, I'm not asking you out like that. Just want to get to know each other as friends. We can invite Luna and the others if you like, whoever you want." Harry said softly, smiling nervously at the blonde.
"Be polite, Draco," Remus warned from in the kitchen. Draco's face tinged pink at his father's words and he corrected himself.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek to keep from snipping at Harry about his nosiness and how overly familiar he was being with him. He released a calming breath and turned to face the other boy.
A tight hug later, one Harry hoped translated every ounce of love he had for her into her body, and they went their separate ways.
He tries to get away from him, scrambles off of his broad chest, and tries to pull far far away. Draco doesn't deserve to touch someone so good with his hands that have hurt and maimed and-and
finish that sentence, Draco, you are not a bother and you know it. You have to tell them or at least, please, tell your new counsellor or tell me or Blaise or someone, anyone. You are so very important to so many people and I -
Harry watched him disappear into his house a small pang of hope thudding quietly in his chest. He'd said that boy had been his
Draco shakes his head, face carefully vacant, eyes glazed over as he stares past him. It's too hard to look him in the eye and keep everything perfectly in place.
Draco's face relaxed and the look of terror and panic washed away. He inhaled deeply, slowly, filling the pit of his stomach with air and released it. His racing heart slowed to a normal pace and he finally mustered up the will to open his eyes finding green ones staring back at him.
Harry watched the trembling man lift his head defiantly. A stuttered and awkward movement that looked nothing, but unnatural on the spineless git before him. Harry honestly didn't see why he needed to hear any of this. They had had this conversation before and Harry was unwavering in his stance. Draco would be his and that was that. Although, Pettigrew's insolence
"No, really, you'd be doing me a favour. I loath football," The other boy smiled kindly as they watched the boys kick off and begin playing. They sat in comfortable silence for a while until the other boy interrupted him trying to recall his name.
you for sticking with this story despite my erratic  and inconsistent updating schedule. Thank you for reading, my lovelies!
"Poor, Princess Pansy, having to visit her dearest friend in squalor, so terribly close to peasants, however will she survive?" Draco cried dramatically, leaning his hip against the counter as he waited, a snooty smirk plastered on his face.
"I'm so sorry!" He chuckled a little madly running his free hand across his face, "Fuck, I'm all over the place tonight, my brains a little shot. I've just never been shocked out of a panic via pinecone before, it's a bit funny."
"I won't let him touch you, never again. You're safe now, Harry, I promise." Draco soothed, stroking his hair and pulling him further into the flat.
A short fifteen minutes later, Draco had Blaise sitting at his dining table scrutinizing him with his dark eyes as he stirred his tea. He had just finished explaining the situation and Blaise's silence was killing him.
"Yes, I am. I just... I couldn't listen to their disappointment any longer." He replied softly, and he felt Pansy reach out to him, intertwining their fingers to comfort him.
The room had fallen silent. Harry looked over to the teachers table and all of them were beginning to stand up. Slughorn had a piece of sausage frozen halfway up to his mouth.
“All the Sixth Years in Hufflepuff think you’re part of an underground smuggling ring and a few were wondering if there was a way for you to get them in. I guess Hogwarts has become a terrible place to sell,” the younger girl shrugged.
“Not bad. He gave me a break and told me that he is going to lighten the load a bit until I graduate,” Harry shrugged and began to fill his plate.
The rest of the group laughed and Vivian opened the bottle, took a swig and passed it to Draco. He took a smaller drink then her and passed it to Victor.
“I don’t know, some guy that you went to school with. He is going to be in town next week and he was wondering if you wanted to meet up for lunch or something,” Vivian shrugged. She pointed the remote to Draco’s room. “I wrote down his message and left it on your desk.”
When Harry got back to Eighth Year dorms he went straight over to the trunk at the foot of his bed. He dropped his bag next to himself as he opened the trunk. He felt around to the bottom, when there, he felt it. With a quick glance over his shoulder Harry made sure that no one else was in the dorm. He pulled the wand out from the trunk.
It had ended up being harder than he thought to leave the flat. One reason being that even though he thought he wasn’t drunk last night, Draco had, like everyone else, woken up with a massive hangover.
“That’s right!” Vivian said, she pulled another bottle of the muggle liquor out of the cabinet. “Draco wants to live the peaceful life. And I agree with him.” She flashed him smile.
“First thing in the morning come by before breakfast,” the older witch smiled. “Have a good day Draco.”
“Good, good,” McGonagall nodded. She flicked her wand and several larger stacks of parchment landed on his increasing stack. “Here is the work that you missed this week. You will have a week to complete it, I’m sure that you will be able to I do not doubt your ability…Draco.”
“Fuck parents am I right? They throw you out of your house and cut you off then what?” Victor asked no one.
“I figured there was just more work,” Harry shrugged. “Just because it was mixing in with my homework.”
When she put it like that Harry couldn’t believe that he hadn’t seen it that way himself. Actually he could, but still. “Alright,” he nodded. “When I go in next week to drop off the papers to Featherstone I will bring it up with him. Even if the Auror’s can’t do anything about it, I’m sure that there is another department that can.”
Instead of separate rooms for the houses, the boys were all put into one wing, and the girls in another. The bedspreads were all the same color, and Harry swore that they were the same color as the ones in the Hospital Wing, only unused. Due to the fact that so few people from their year came back to finish it did make since.
Ron continued to have the smug look on his face for the remainder of breakfast. Harry turned back to his work.
There was something about standing in front of the gargoyle entrance that made Draco uncomfortable. He had never known a person who sat behind the desk who didn’t want to kill him. Or that he was supposed to kill.
The three of them were quiet. There was one one else in the common room to disturb them. “I thought he went to Azkaban, that’s why he wasn’t here. I cant imagine him not willing not coming back to finish up,” Hermione said breaking the silence.
Draco hated his job, he hated the dull work, and he hated the Muggle technology that he had to use in order to do his work. But it payed well and there was no way that he was going to spend the next few years working at a hamburger shop selling food to the fat American tourists that came to London. He had watched an episode of an American Muggle show and on of the main characters worked for a company like the one Draco worked for, all he did was look at and analysis numbers. He made shit money, but it was enough Muggle money to get him through the past few months of rent.
“I’ll try,” Draco said, he knew there was an old phone booth in Hogsmeade but he wasn’t sure if it worked. “But I can write for sure.”
“And I am sure that you are aware that you will be taking your NEWT’s this year as well,” McGonagall raised her right eyebrow.
Also due to the fact that many half-bloods and muggleborns had no interest of serving a government that had failed them during the war. Not to mention the older generation, who were failed twice by the Ministry in two separate wars.
He hugged her back, which felt strange as he did not have much practice. Not in the way that she was hugging him at least. When she finally let him go she gave him another smile and followed Kyle into her little brother’s room.
Draco logged out os his computer, he hated the blasted thing, and grabbed his coat and his scarf. The one thing that he had taken with him to Muggle London. His House scarf. He had been able to make it back to the Manor before the rest of the fallout of the war could happen. All he grabbed was the scarf, without his wand it was the only thing that mattered.
But then there was the looks that Molly Weasley had given him over the dinner table when he and Ron had expressed not wanting to go back. The owls had arrived with the letter saying that they were welcome to come back. And then came the letter from Hermione saying that they better go or so help her she would spell them there her herself.
“Well,” she stressed. “I figured that Harry would want to help because the same thing happened to him. Yes, is parents were in the Order. But they were still killed during the last Wizarding War and left Harry alone. What’s to say that there aren’t kids like Harry out there right now who’s parents were killed or imprisoned?”
Draco didn’t move, he didn’t even react. He was done. Maybe someone would just put him out of his misery and shoot a killing curse at him now. Maybe Potter would do it. He killed the man that tried to kill him when he was a baby, now maybe he would kill his childhood nemesis tonight as well.
The first was his letter for Hogwarts. And invitation to finish his final year. To graduate. How the owl knew where to find him was a mystery. But it wasn’t like he had gone far.
“Not the point Ronald,” Hermione sighed. “I assume we will be spending the weekend working on homework then? At least that way I can get ahead a bit. Of course I will have to then look over the two of yours. I figure that we can meet in the library at eight then tomorrow morning. See if we can knock it all down and then try and get to… The two of you aren’t even listening to me are you?”
“One thing,” she said taking the stack of names. She shuffled through them before she seemed to find the one she wanted. She scribbled something and handed both the quill and the paper back to Harry. “Here. That’s one less person to have to find.”
He didn’t have a wand, seeing as how Potter had just expelled it from his hand. So he walked. And walked, and walked. And no one stopped him.
“Mr. Potter, what brings you into my office?” Artemus Featherstone asked as Harry pushed the door open. “I did not expect to see you so soon into the term.”
Harry almost wished he had a mad scheme to try and figure out. At least they would normally get him out of his homework and exams.
“You are a wonderful student Draco,” McGonagall said. “I have no doubt that you will continue to thrive this year as you have in years past. You will need to catch up for this week that you missed. But as I said, I have no doubts that you will be able to catch up. I am…” the witch paused. “I am glad to see that you are back Draco. I was worried that you wouldn’t return, and I am very glad to see you back.”
It had begun to get cold, first term had just begun, and Draco had no interest of going back. Not that he thought he would have even been welcomed back. The son of one of Voldemorts most loyal followers, and the nephew of his right hand woman. However, he stilled missed Hogwarts. No matter how much he had hated the people or the professors, he loved Hogwarts itself. When he was there there were no parents. No crazy aunts, no Dark Lords. Just a bunch of idiots his age and amazing food.
“I was hoping to leave as soon as possible really,” Draco looked up at the girl he had been sharing a flat with for the past few months. She looked sad. “I’m sorry Vivian. I just have to get back to school that’s all. I’ll be back for Christmas, that is if you will have me.” It wasn’t like he would go home. Or could.
Draco walked the empty halls towards the Eighth Year dorms. The rest of the students were in classes, and it was strange to be walking alone durning the time of day.
“No, just had to drop off paperwork,” Harry stood up and kicked his bag under his bed. “Featherstone gave me the weekend off.”
“I think you are right Potter,” McGonagall said nodding. “There are many students who did not return this year. Those who survived the War that is. I do think that it is important that we find these children, many were hidden away before the Battle of Hogwarts, on both sides.”
The Dark Lord had called from those from the Hogwarts side to join him. His parents called his name again, telling him to join them. He knew that they were dead. All three of them. There was no way that the Dark Lord would let any of them live to the next week after the events at Malfoy Manner. He had let them live this long, and now that Potter was dead, so were they.
“I really don’t think I’m going back. Class is almost over, maybe I’ll just hit up the greenhouses,” Astoria said making her way back towards the way she and her sister came.
“Have a seat Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall gestured to the chair opposite her desk with her quill. Draco cross the room and took the offered seat. “Biscuit?”
“What did I miss?” Hermione asked as she climbed through the door. She stopped when she saw Ron bowing. “Seriously what did I miss?”
“No thank you,” Draco smiled. “I think that I can manage a castle where I have called home since I was eleven.”
McGonagall looked up as if she forgot Harry and he were speaking only seconds ago. “Oh yes, Potter thank you. Have a nice evening.”
And there, standing in the doorway dressed in Eighth Year robes was Draco Malfoy. Not a hair out of place. No blood, no scratches, nothing that made him look like he had been missing for five months. He glanced over the room, and seemed to have realized where he was supposed to be seated and made his way over to the table where Harry, Ron and Hermione were.
There was really only one problem. It was already a week into the term, meaning that Draco could not catch the Hogwarts Express. He had to find his own way to get there. Which at the moment seemed impossible.
Harry had almost skipped out on lunch that afternoon. It was only Ron convincing him that he could spread out all his papers on the Eighth Year table and therefore not have to deal with Pansy complaining that he was taking over all the table space in the common room. The Eighth Year table was just as long as the rest of the House tables, and therefore Harry could take up as much space as he wanted without bothering anyone. Well, except for Hermione and Ron.
But the homework, and having to study for NEWT’s was something Harry was not happy to be doing. He did like his current job, and now his new project. And he was sure that McGonagall would have let him come and see her whenever he wanted to.
All four flatmates had decided to take one last trip together to the diner under their flat and had one last greasy breakfast. That seemed to cheer everyone up a bit. Victor seemed to have the worst of it.
"Gin, I've got the bandages. You ready?" Harry said upon entering the room carrying medical supplies. The red-haired girl, Gin presumably, nodded towards Draco and raised a suggestive eyebrow, "Blondie's awake, I think I can manage a few bloody knuckles. Unless, of course, my angel wants to help me?"
know what you meant. But that doesn't mean he does! Certainly not, when you're going off on a tangent about it as though what happened was somehow his fault." Remus interrupted a look of distress finding its way onto his face. "Gods, Sirius, you need to be more careful with your words."
"He called you a fool. Suggested you would end up poisoned just as your father did for disagreeing with his wishes," Draco began to ascend the steps to the dais as he spoke, "His disrespect of you was cause enough, but it was his veiled threat of your downfall that I could not let pass."
His pet, who hadn't so much as flinched at the belligerent lord's raised voice, let out a small whine. He looked up at Harry with beseeching silver eyes and a pout gracing his pink lips. Harry released his tight grip, massaging his lover's head. He smiled regretfully, raising one of Draco's hands to his lips and pressing a kiss to his palm in apology. He would never purposefully harm his pet unless it was something Draco had asked for explicitly.
"You cannot seriously intend to keep him!" Pettigrew continued, "Harry, my boy, please see reason. Lord Malfoy and Lady Narcissa will not stand for it! You know he has been promised to King Riddle and-"
"Lord, have mercy on my soul," He sighed, dramatically leaning his entire body weight on Blaise, "Potter, this is Blaise. Blaise, my neighbour, Harry Potter."
Harry stuttered out tears trailing their way down his face in waves and blood dripping from his hand. He looked like a scared child, trying to disappear. The sight made Draco's body
and his all body encompassing sobbing morphed into small and quiet whimpers, Draco decided it was safe to move away from him for a second. He knew the reason Harry hadn't moved was because he was waiting for another smack, but it would never come. Instead, Draco walked over to the dresser on the other side of the room and grabbed a pair of pants and one of his shirts. He knew Harry always felt more comfortable in one of his shirts after a punishment.
Harry slowly rose from his spot on the floor and followed the directions. The position Draco had put him in offered no support and they both knew holding it would make the punishment seem so much longer.
He reached a tentative hand out and pulled Draco to him till he stood snugly between his legs. Harry trailed his hands down Draco's arms and left them resting on the other boy's hips, his thumbs rubbing soothing circles on the exposed skin, just above Draco's hip bone.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Harry," Draco murmured looking up at Harry from where he was tucked into his arms. His pretty silver eyes, red-rimmed from the hysterical crying he had done a few minutes prior. He sighed and kissed Draco's temples.
A knock on the door startled Remus from his spot in the kitchen where he'd been cooking dinner for his boys. He tossed the apron he was wearing onto one of the dining room chairs and made his way to the door.
a/n hello, loves! it's been a while but I've apologized quite a bit over my messed up writing schedule (it really is difficult to write for fun when you
"It's fine, good, actually. Much better than Beauxbaton. They even have their own pool. I haven't really spoken to anyone on the team or otherwise, but they seem alright."
as you put it. And I don't date so if that's what this-" Draco began defensively, dropping his arms down to his sides and then wrapping them protectively around his middle.
Draco let out a wail, back bowing in a perfect arc as his orgasm ripped through his body. Such a beautifully broken sound. He convulsed in his haze of pleasure, sobs, and spasms wracking his body. Come shooting up and dirtying his chest along with Harry's dress shirt. He didn't care and held his pet fast, his thrusts slowing to a calm and steady pace as he lovingly fucked Draco through his orgasm. Harry traced light circles against milky thighs, admiring how they shook as his lovely pet came back down, his pretty cock twitching and spent.
"We've got him, hmm? He'll be fine. He tries his hardest to tell us what he has to when he's ready. We simply have to support him and hope he knows he can come to us with anything." He hummed pressing their foreheads together again as he spoke, his hands still resting on either side of Sirius' face, "It would help if you didn't become so angry and protective."
"Oi! Fuck off." Harry replied, his words lacking any of the anger. He stuck his tongue out at all of them. They would know about being whipped, wouldn't they, always tangled up in each other. Draco laughed prettily into his chest and he couldn't help but feel giddy at the prospect of what was to come.
Draco let out a shaky breath and fisted his hands into Harry's shirt before lifting his head and sitting back enough to face him. He lifted sad silver eyes to meet his green ones. Harry had to resist the urge to kiss away the tears.
No, Harry did not work for the Ministry. He worked for Artemus Featherstone, the Auror who was in the lead of gathering up the last of the Death Eaters, and taking care of those who had been misplaced during the war.
Parkinson began to stutter something and then turned an alarming shade of purple and stomped into the girls dormitories.
Harry had no idea why he was so nervous to ask McGonagall for her help. She had never not wanted to help in in his seven, well eight, years at Hogwarts. But then again this wasn’t a school project or the fight against an evil wizard.
“It is up to you if you would like to go to your classes this afternoon. But I can understand if you do not want to. Your belongings are in your dorm,” The headmistress gave him a final look as if to say that she was done.
The Headmistress looked taken by surprise. “Whatever for Potter? It’s only been a week of class, surely not even you are behind yet.”
“I know what it is,” Draco snapped. He looked down at the piece of parchment in his hands. “Bubbles and squeak.”
McGonagall did not say anything in the moments after Harry’s speech. She simply sat there and thought about what he had said. Harry hoped that this was a good thing. After several moments the older witch finally spoke.
“Me too,” Harry admitted. Those first few weeks after the end of the war, all the trials, and hunting down Death Eaters. He had sworn that he had seen Malfoy there. Somewhere.
“You boys done with all your homework?” Hermione asked, she began to flip through Harry’s list. “That way I figured tomorrow we can all head for drinks? A day at Hogsmeade?”
Draco made his way back to his room. He still had some packing left to do. Vivian grabbed his arm before he made it in though.
Harry shook his head. Hermione had apparently gotten it into her head that now that the war was over and they did not have to worry about fighting Voldemort at the end of the year, that it would be a good idea if they, mainly Harry, helped to find the missing children. She thought that it was wrong that the Ministry had spent all its time looking for the Death Eaters and not the children that they had left behind.
“Thank you sir,” Harry said and turned to leave the office. He stood outside the office door and pulled a single piece of parchment out of his bag.
Coming back to Hogwarts was something the Harry really did not want to do. He was content working for Featherstone and living off of the goodwill that people had of him saving the Wizarding
“Roger fucking hates me though,” Draco replied. Muggle liquor did not hit him the same as his flatmates. Firewhiskey must be more potent.
“Hold on,” Ron said holding out his hand for the papers. Hermione handed them to him. he shuffled through to the one that he was looking for. “Malfoy, you mentioned Malfoy.”
“I agree with you Harry,” McGonagall said softly. “But years of injustice and hatred cannot be fixed over one summer. The effects of war will last for many years to come.”
“I did,” Draco said trying to shove everything in the one truck he had. He had not realized how many belongings that were in the trunk, and how many belongings he had acquired these past months. “Off to uni.”
With that reasoning there was nothing left for Draco to loose. He was going to die anyway. Even if the Dark Lord was defeated by the small group of Order members and Hogwarts students that surrounded him, he was sure that they would try and kill him or lock him up in Azkaban for life.
He walked out of the crowd, he heard Professor McGonagall gasp behind him. The sounds of someone quietly crying behind him could be heard too.
“Did you want a biscuit?” The witch flicked her wand and a tray of biscuits flew from some corner of the office. A teapot and two cups with saucers followed. They landed on the desk in between them.
In the end Draco had decided to just do the easiest option and just Apparate right to Hogsmeade. He could take the path up to the castle. And, hopefully, not be arrested on his hike up.
“Just a rumor that I heard,” Daphne Greengrass said flicking her long hair behind her shoulder. “The other ones are a bit more out there. But then again only a select few really know the truth about you.”
“That’s some information that I really didn’t need to know,” the other girl said as they almost reached where Draco was standing. He realized he wouldn’t be able to avoid this conversation forever. Better get the first one over and done with.
“Thanks mate,” Ron said happily and took the plate from Harry. “What are you even working on? It’s only the second day of classes, even I’m not behind yet.”
No, that wasn’t possible, he was the Boy Who Lived. Not the Boy Who Died. There was no way that the great Harry Potter was dead. His bright green eyes were not closed, they could not be dull for the rest of time. It just wasn’t possible.
“Hard of a time she’s having?” Ron asked incredulously. “What about me? She was being her normal horrible self. She should be taken down. Half of her friends are in Azkaban anyway, so now she is being even more horrible.”
“I just don’t want kids to have to grow up alone,” Harry said. “I just thought that ending the war would have fixed it all. That everyone could feel safe, at least here at Hogwarts.”
Draco looked up from the dead body of Voldemort to the boy standing on the other side. Potter was looking at him with a look that he had never seen before, at least directed at him.
Harry figured that he should at least try to find Malfoy, if only just to return his wand. Not because he wanted to turn him over to the Aurors and send him to Azkaban. The halls of Hogwarts seemed empty without someone always antagonizing him. And now that he didn’t have Voldemort to worry about, it felt weird not to have anyone to be angry at or to figure out of someone was plotting something.
“Er,” Ron began, but was quickly cut off with Hermione whipping her head up. Her curls bouncing and nearly hitting him in the face.
She smiled at him again. Then reached her arms up wrap around his neck. And she…gave him hug. “I hope so Draco.”
And that was to go to Hogwarts. He had his letter, there was no way that McGonagall would send him a letter just to then ship him off to Azkaban.
“I don’t know why you came back anyway,” Ron grabbed a paper off the pile that was by Harry’s arm. “You have a killer job at the Ministry already. And I am sure that you could get any job you wanted, everyone pretty much owes you for the rest of your life.”
London was nice enough, but with magic London took on a whole new look. If he still had magic he could go to Gringgots and get money out his vault to pay for a better apartment. Preferably one that didn’t have three other people in it.
“It’s not a problem sir. I dealt with far more than just extra work on top of homework,” Harry shrugged.
“Yeah, just set him back the work from this morning. And not a minute later there was another owl flying in,” Harry sighed and threw hs quill onto the stack of parchment.
Draco picked up his plate and took the offered sausage. Harry turned to look back at the teachers table. McGonagall was getting up and walking at a brisk pace to the end of the Eighth Year table.
“It just doesn’t have the same effect anymore,” Ron smirked. “We killed Voldemort. I was almost killed by his crazy snake. And I killed a piece of his soul, not to mention we all camped in the wood for months. So, you and your little gang of arseholes do scare us anymore.”
