Draco tasted like adventure, the kind that might maroon a wizard with a hinkypunk and a swamp, so that they would only continue to exist in their old life as just another sad heap of missing person flyers. But it was the same kind that could make a hero out of anyone, would goad them until they tore their way into the history books and clear out a throne for their name. Not that Harry needed that, but still.
The world is much kinder down here—less loud, with fewer familiar faces Draco can no longer see clear. It’s just him and the water; his seventh dictawand and an ever-expanding collection of sounds.
Draco does not answer, his tongue numb, a little knot knocking about in his chest—freed soon enough, by the barest brush of Harry’s lips against the corner of his mouth. “Because I’m still counting on you to take charge of the pacing. Our pacing.”
“What isn’t worth it?”
The last thing Harry registered before strong-arming his way through the Anti-Apparition barricades was the piercing
Harry scowled. “I think I have an idea on what it might be,” he said in a low voice. Draco spun round, but Harry wasn’t looking at him. “It’s a dragon heart.”
Draco—a nameless surliness, in turn, begins lodging splinters into his back of his throat.
In reality, there was no lovely geometry Draco could offer in return, only boxes of cosmic void, delineated to confine him. He couldn’t show Harry the sleek, promising octahedron that would be unlidded a few months to come, nor the ring that it held, with a radius too small for Draco’s heart.
“I’ll take over from here,” the Shaman told him, sweeping her way over to them and wrapping Draco’s still writhing body into her arms. They vanished, just like that, leaving Harry clammy and shaking before the mud-brown trail. Alone and confused. He doubted his sanity for a while, marched one leg out. It landed on solid ground with a soft
on her. Draco chewed on his bottom lip for a while, then followed her gaze; turned around. Harry was standing by the door. His duffel bag had been unzipped, but he was stuffing whatever he’d been taking out right into it again, looking chagrined. Draco caught sight of a flash of silver, and no more.
Harry released his arms from his chest, letting them hang defeatedly by his sides. He looked dejected and about as confused as Draco felt. It was over. Draco tried to piece the broken fragments together into what might be the full conversation, but there were plainly too many lost pieces of puzzle. He stepped out of the dusty nook, wandlessly dropping the charms as he came into Harry’s sight.
The remedies were prepared for the locals: pain-relieving salve for arthritis; powdered Charms to prevent dragon pox; sachets for sweet dreams … the Shaman had told them, before leading them through the front door again and into the open air.
They could always come back for the heart—Harry wished to complete the second section as much as the next Flyer—with a proper action plan
But Harry and Malfoy got on—they had to—since they shared the cabin, the shower, the loo, the oxygen within the cabin and ... lunch, which Harry had at some point started making for two, just to stop Malfoy from complaining about the absence of egg in egg salad sandwiches, or the ubiquitous mayo in everything they served in their canteen. (“—should at least have the sense to slather on some crème fraîche, instead of this vulgar—”)
“Yeah. Well. As I said, it’s nothing. Doesn’t matter now.”
Atop Hagrid’s Hut, the stone chimney is a cold loose fist waiting to catch a falling sun. Harry glances around, at the evening fields with stale breath, at a brown stretch of bentgrass, whose knees were fractured bearing Malfoy's empty weight, unmoving, a shaky reality Harry will soon unload from the fixed past.
As they walked, an archway revealed itself before them. It loomed black and stony upon the spired mountain top, and was rather similar to the one at the Department of Mysteries. “Just like that,” Harry said, flinging the heavy parcel through the black rippling Veil. Without a noise, it disappeared into the void.
As if!” Draco huffs, but he takes Harry’s hand, and as one they meander slowly towards the mustard loveseat, whose ghastliness has often been raptly observed by Draco's smart mouth.
What he did next could probably count as the strangest thing Harry had ever seen anyone do. As though the parcel could channel Draco’s intention of deflecting the curse, a watery shield emerged from it, then expanded until it was broad enough to wrap around them several times, forming a cylindrical safe space at where they stood. It wasn’t a standard
"Merlin. Discovering you in a tangle of rubbish and dead spells doesn't make me feel any better."
“He might just be a bit tiddly,” Draco mused along the way.
“What,” Draco said flatly, drying the snips of herbs with a spell, “that I am your bonded dragon?”
"And I'm trained," Draco fights the stutter that threatens to spill out his throat, "I've received training in, taking care of, I mean, rescuing stranded life forms."
Malfoy was therefore suspended from his position while the Board carried out an investigation. He raised no objection to it, as far as Harry knew; yet it didn’t make him appear any less suspicious.
“Will we ever fly together, some day?”
Charlie came out of the Station, followed closely by Harry, who had the defiant look of a child who’d just won a fight. Under the sun, Charlie’s hair was a heavy copper, almost as weighty as Yulia’s gunmetal grey. There was a seasoned confidence rolling off Charlie’s shoulders when he walked, a fierce fortitude.
You can’t possibly think—” Trailing off, he abused the straw with his teeth some more.
Draco had done packing the briefcase in which he stored supplements, potions and other Healing consumables—the standard stuff for a standard day—when he heard voices coming from the kitchenette by the stove. They were Harry’s and Madam Cholpon’s. Their voices grew loud for a brief spell, before self-consciously toning down again. It stirred Draco’s curiosity; he set his door half ajar so that it still concealed him, but would allow him to hear them clearly.
Harry has to wade through his own dilemma, the methodically commuting bodies and the low-hanging humidity among the city, just to get another step closer to Draco. It is quite impossible to lose him though; his bright hair, along with the Tutshill aqua he wore, is his calling card among the dimmed flurry of the crowd.
“Right,” Harry said. The Luna-ness in her speech had caught him off guard, but at the same time, it reminded Harry of the first few times he tried to learn a Patronus Charm. She reminded him of Lupin. Harry looked up at her face again; there were wrinkles under her eyes, unfurling sagely as they wormed into her cheeks.
He manoeuvered himself through it with some difficulty, letting the ancient lure draw him deeper and deeper with its gentle coaxing.
“Hullo,” the apparition said when he noticed Harry’s gaze, riveted on him—for all the dissimilarity between them, he was Draco alright.
Harry runs Polyjuiced, but he suspects its effect has worn off over time. An ogling receptionist of the hostel must already recognise Harry by the shape of his arse; the beady, rain-washed tarmac by the briny taste of his sweat; the quaint, wood-framed houses by the darting speed of his shadow.
“Probably because of the smell of dragon dung on Harry’s robe,” Malfoy had complained to no one in particular.
“I said—” Draco pushed himself off the tree and made his way towards Harry, who backed away out of surprise. “Merlin.” Draco rolled his eyes, when he took in the confused look on Harry’s face. “You’re hopeless.”
Harry angled his face to have a look at him, and their lips brushed just the barest touch in the process. Draco did not back away; neither did Harry.
“For riding a horse?” Draco was genuinely lost, but when he caught sight of Harry’s face—“Oh. I see. For a dragon.”
They thought it was strange that the ward takeover and the following attack had gone completely under the radar. According to the Navigation centre, Malfoy’s alert had been filed almost ten minutes after his tracking spells lost contact with his Flyer.
In the corner of Harry’s eye, Draco’s profile was another pale glowing crescent. Somehow he had the feeling that Draco was watching him; Harry wished it would last. He could break more rules and complete more insane tasks if it meant that Draco might look at him like that for a while longer. It was a dangerous and childish desire. Harry was quite good at capturing things with wings, he knew, but also tended to lose whatever he treasured.
“The fog will rise in the eventide,” the Centaur told them placidly.
His vision became fuzzy once Draco reached a depth of low light and crushing pressure, making it difficult to locate the heart, even though it had been tugging at his magic as if it had something important to divulge.
“Where did you get this?” Malfoy’s voice had a breathy quality now. “This stuff’s divine.”
While I, Harry—I love making friends.”
Buckbeak blinks, drags the leafy tendrils underfoot with a bored claw, as if the earth is an unravelled seam and one could twirl all the loose threads round their fingers. Harry smiles, flips the hourglass thrice, shutting his eyes as the causes-and-effects are recrystallised around him, the cantering of clock hands unheard, every old etching smoothed out until newly annealed.
“You don’t just …? How do you know it’s you, and not the bond? How can you—”
Draco had disappeared through the bookshelves and into the wall after that—to clear his head, probably. Harry could not bring himself to blame him. He still remembered the raw, exposed fear he fostered, after realising that the final Horcrux was lodged deep within his own skull.
“Will you tell me about it?”
After the bookshop, Draco noses about rather enthusiastically in a CD shop on the corner of the street, comes out feeding a disc-shaped Walkman with jazz albums that can cool down the rain and the summer air.
Finally, having spotted it, he snatched the parcel, caging it under his arm. There seemed to be some kind of jinx on this place, a security system that would cancel all external enchantments—Draco’s Bubble-Head Charm was the first to be slowly nullified. Oxygen was running low in his blood, and his chest felt tight. Draco should return at once; he turned round, noticed how holding the parcel slowed down his swimming. A flash of white tore the dim sweep in half—he whirled about again—but it was gone as quickly as it had come. Instead, a black nothingness dwelled.
Shapeshifter—an enigma; a shadowy concept that haunted some of their oldest myths. Of course Malfoy wasn’t one. Whoever started that rumour was an idiot who probably had to light up a bonfire and a firework show in their bedroom to fall asleep at night.
The red mountaintops looked as if they were bleeding for the dragons who had been rounded up and slaughtered by the wizards, right here, not long after the Statute of Secrecy took effect. Maybe that was why.
“What? No, not yet.”
But Harry kept the cigarette in his pocket, dry and safe, all the same.
“I just fucking did, didn’t I?” Draco demands, breathless in the strange quietude of Harry’s unlit bedroom. The defiant look he gives Harry hints that he might be waiting for a mulish,
What bothered him more was the implication of it. The young man shrunk back into himself, looking quite pleased with his display until he saw the look on Harry’s face. “Good morning to you too,” he sniffed. “Upon my soul, I dare say I would never have tolerated such incivility back in my time.”
Draco's steps are light as the dancing hops in beer as he deviates from the rolling rush of city sound, a lone tropical fish venturing into the deep end of Yoyogi Park.
“Your potion’s ready.”
“Solomonar,” she turned to Harry sharply, “what happens when a dragon dies, but their heart isn’t returned to their loved ones—or in some cases, their bonded wizards?”
“Now you know what it's like,” Harry tells him, seriously indulgent, “looking into your eyes.”
Outside, the familiar stranger skirts their station from a distance like a curious fish, while Draco moors himself to their voice, nearing, as though beckoned by his attention, as though they are waiting for Draco’s silhouette to give up its shape and temperature in return, because—Draco gasps—honed sharp by old magic, the eerie call has speared through the wards, electrifying the scientific cold as it charges across the room, sending shivers along the walls, along Draco's skin.
“Touché, but apparently that’s my defining character.”
He delivered potions to the alpine lakes for the nomads. Sometimes, the Centaurs came knocking on the wards at her Apparition Gate, and Draco Healed them if she wasn’t available. For the farmers, he could make one patch of the fields rain and the other one remain sunny. And whatever ridiculous objects the River Trolls wished to find, he easily Summoned.
He wasn’t sure what to expect, what he might see. If it really was the heart from Draco’s past, would the magic in the heartstrings recognise Harry? Draco had suggested that they were bonded; Harry secretly agreed. He could feel it sometimes, like the time he pulled Draco out of the lake—he always suspected it had perhaps been more the bond’s doing than the Summoning Charm’s. What the Shaman told them yesterday night hinted the possibility of them being also bonded in a previous life, which was wild, but they lived in a magical world and Harry supposed that was enough to warrant just about anything.
Why was he helping Draco?
“How come you know so much about an artifact of my line?” Draco asked tightly. His veneer of politeness had already slipped.
. A warm presence to his right. This was getting easier every time. He'd barely needed to concentrate.
“But for now, let’s get lunch on the way,” Mrs. Weasley said cheerily and began cluttering about in the kitchen.
She marched towards the bed. She looked like she was about to hex the living daylights out of him. However, she resorted to non-magical means, leaned over the bed and cuffed him over the head sharply.
“-and wandless-”
“Where’s the others then?” he asked with good cheer. He seemed to be wholly unconcerned about the state of his mother’s kitchen.
“Oh, look at zem! So sweet!”
“Why thank you, mum, but I think I’d rather go to bed early. I won’t be able to watch my tongue with
“Hello, pleased to meet you. I’m Harry Potter. How are you doing, Mrs. Valpolicella?”
“Harry Potter. Nice to meet you,” Harry introduced himself, shaking Mr. Al-Keydari’s hand.
“Well.” He eyed them and cleared his throat. “Great to have you as well, Harry. I will just…” He muttered, took his copy of the Daily Prophet and went to sit in his armchair.
He stepped closer to the window and saw the rooftops of the greenhouses underneath. On the right, the view opened over the Great Lake. The were evidently somewhere between the Bell Towers and the Central Towers, along the Long Gallery.
He looked over at Draco’s reflection. His face was pale and his lips stood out. His eyes seemed darker that they should be. Was he thinking of his mother? His father? His hair was curled inwards at the nape and his collar was dirty from sweating and his cravat was creased. The sleeves of his shirt were wrinkled where he had pulled them up while they’d worked on the wall. The legs of his trousers where sprinkled with mud. All in all, he looked exceedingly dishevelled for a Malfoy.
How could she say these things in such a calm tone? Why was she not questioning him? Why wasn’t she angry? He would have expected her to have a few choice words for him at the very least.
Draco came out of his crouch a few yards away and made his way back towards him. He’d dropped the Lumos. His hair was as shiny as those fluorescent flowers. It was awful. The set of his shoulders was confident and his stride was purposeful. Something had changed from that haunted boy on the train, to become this elegant self-possessed young man. His face was pale like porcelain and his eyes glittered like grey pearls reflecting the moonlight, as he ascended the last steps.
This is a one off - the story will continue in Harry's POV.
“But… wouldn’t Ginny play with you? And what about Fred and George?”
“Thanks,” Hermione mumbled, blew her nose and dabbed at her eyes. Harry averted his face when Ron murmured something into her ear quietly. She shook her head and dislodged another few strands in the process. “No, I’m fine, Ron. Thank you.”
He blushed fiercely at the whole idea, but half of it was for pleasure. Hope blossomed in some part of him that he hadn’t realised had been empty for a long time. It made him nearly giddy.
“Oh no!” He gasped in horrified tones. “I haven’t… I haven’t packed
“Oh joy,” Draco sighed.
“Draco…” Harry started but he didn’t really know what to say. Mrs. Weasley was keeping busy and Mr. Weasley was hidden behind his paper, but he bet they were listening to every word. At least, they seemed to be alright with the way things were, for the moment. Maybe Harry could be alright with things, too.
Be blessed! xx
“He didn’t have to save me.” Harry said quietly into the silence. “He… he never even hesitated.” Looking back towards the house, Harry knew exactly were Draco was, sitting in his room, alone. Was he working on something? Was he catching up on sleep? Was he lounging around on the bed, bored? There was a way to find out. Would it be like it had been on the train? Harry closed his eyes and focused. Almost instantly, he could see a worn wooden desk with deep scratches and scorch marks and Draco’s hand gracefully holding a quill, writing what seemed to be a letter. His fingers were long and a bit bony. With a jolt, Harry remembered where those fingers had been before. He quickly opened his eyes. Luckily, Ron hadn’t noticed his absentmindedness.
“Where are they?” Harry asked, draining the dregs of his tea and carrying the cup towards the sink in the corner. He took Draco’s cup too.
“I’d like to see him try!” Ron laughed, hitting Harry on the back as he stepped past him into the restroom and closed the door behind him.
“How come you have been here for two days and I have to hear everything from Mr. Weasley, of all people?” she huffed. She stood there just fixing him with this
Harry handed him his wand and watched as Draco performed a cleaning charm and something that made his clothes look freshly ironed after he had tucked himself back in.
Her hands wandered to the back and then she patted the sides of her head, presumably checking her hair. When she seemed satisfied with her appearance, she looked up. Their eyes met and an inviting smile sprung to life on her face. Perfect white teeth were showcased by her full lips, as red as the dress she was wearing. Her eyes were the same brilliant green as Harry’s own.
, Harry nearly killed him, but then Draco said, cool as a cucumber: “Fuck my mouth.”
“He should be here, too. This involves him just as much as it involves me. I don’t like leaving him out of the loop,” he told Ron.
“Ah.”
“Yes, thank you, I got it!” Harry choked out around his laughter and snatched the magazine from below Ron’s face.
“Not to mention those muscles,” he murmured. He came very close. Too close.
He stood there staring at the space she had left for a solid five minutes, trying to wrap his head around what had just happened. It was like a tornado had blown through and he was surprised to find all his limbs still attached.
Draco let go of his arm abruptly. Harry told himself he didn’t miss the warmth of Malfoy’s touch through his jumper.
“Thank Merlin. I nearly forgot Malfoy is here somewhere. The thought of sharing a bathroom is too creepy,” Ron whispered with a shudder when Harry stepped onto the hall.
“What I meant was, you forget you are a Bonded man. You are legally considered an adult because the Bond took hold. Or did you not know about that?”
Ron looked vaguely ill. “Death Eaters?”
She sighed once more and then fixed him with her unapologetic gaze, setting down her pen.
,' Harry’s mind supplied.
to ask me anything and you inquire after a plant?” he moaned disbelievingly.
This went deeper. It was as if Draco’s tenderness dragged it out of him forcefully wherever they were touching. The hand on his back tightened and soothing fingers carded through his curls. With a grunt, Harry pulled Draco towards him in one abrupt motion and buried his face in his shoulder. They were both shaking with the force of his sobs.
When Harry hesitated, Draco clucked his tongue in irritation and snatched both of Harry’s wrists and put them on his head.
to be together, like, being in the same place.”
“Hermione-“ Harry tried, but she just barrelled over him.
“Leave it, mate,” he said tiredly.
Before he could decide to do either, Draco put his hands on the counter either side of Harry and inclined his head towards him. Every sense of Harry’s was on high alert. His skin tingled from head to toe, and Draco hadn’t even touched him yet.
,” he said flatly as he got up, “but maybe you should wait with that until Granger gets here, because she’ll undoubtedly have you describe every detail you remember and have a thousand question for every detail you don’t.” He shoved past Ron and headed towards the staircase. “I’ll be in my room, if you need me.”
Draco looked up, quizzical air.
They stilled and listened for half a minute but when nothing else happened, Harry sat up and started looking for the missing knife and fork.
“Well, I suppose. It’s quite late already and it probably takes about three hours to get there by train. We could always take the floo, but I’m sure most public grates in London are being watched now that we’ve gone missing.”
Suddenly Draco grabbed his hips, pulled him away from the window sharply, shuffled around on the floor and leaned his head back against the wall, Harry’s fingers still buried in his hair.
“What’s so amusing?” he bit out.
The whole thing had been so much like Ginny, Harry really should have expected a reaction exactly like this. What he could not have foreseen was his own forceful response to Draco being threatened in this – all things considered – rather harmless way. After all, Ginny was only a 15-year-old girl and Harry had experienced multiple attacks by grown up Death Eaters and, not to mention, faced an angry Mrs. Weasley more than once. The latter was a lot higher on the scariness scale, as far as he was concerned. Still, the panic he had felt upon Ginny’s hastily drawn wand and ear-piercingly screeched insults had been sharper than any he had felt before, even at the graveyard. He knew where she got her fierceness from, anyway.
Harry just shook his head and went ahead.
need to know. I’m only your best friend. No need to inform me at all. Not like you need
“Yes, quite.” Mrs. Weasley said. “Draco, you can stay in the twin’s room and Harry will bunk in with Ronald. There will be no sharing a bed in this house until you both become of age!” She lifted an admonishing finger.
“Mr. Potter, please sit down. If you want to meet with somebody, you may invite them into your quarters.”
“No… you know what I mean.”
“Dumblidore left or right, eet eez no good to force a man to work weezout food een ‘is belly. Dumblidore can wait a ‘alf ‘our. You go on your own, no? You ‘ave eaten.”
“Please, sit down.”
He had pitied him, just for a moment, and Draco had instantly turned on him. He hadn’t said things that hurtful to Harry in a while. Harry wouldn’t be surprised if that were the approach Malfoy had learned from his father – hiding insecurity behind cutting remarks. Antagonising people before they could see your weakness. It had worked brilliantly over the years, ever since Harry had first met him. Hadn’t it been that way from the start?
Harry started off slowly but when Draco’s whines got louder, Harry sped up and soon got lost in the pleasure of it. His thrusts were strengthening and he cut off Draco’s breath with every push. His hands tightened in Draco’s hair and at some point he
“Nox. So, how come-“
“Don’t forget you are a Bonded man,” he said in a reprimanding tone.
“What, send a quick note while the Death Eaters where chasing us though the forest? ‘Just wanted to tell you we’ll be coming over. My scar is gone because Draco healed my fatal chest injury. Also, we’re bonded for life now.’ Something along those lines?”
“Well… I don’t really know myself. When my chest was smashed open (“Oh Harry!”), Draco put his hands on the wound and pulled the- the pain and the hurt into himself and that’s how the wound closed.” He shuddered. It had been a rather gruesome image. “But when the wound had closed all the way, it felt like he wasn’t done. I know he felt the same. So he kept on pulling and pulling and this green goo-  came out.” He looked down at his hands. He remembered how the stuff had clung to Draco’s. Goosebumps spread along his arms and back in spite of the warm room. “It felt really horrible,” he whispered. “Like I would never be happy again.”
! Undefinable dread surged up inside Harry like a tsunami. That couldn’t be. Surely that couldn’t be. That’s why it was called an Indissoluble Bond, right? Because there was no way to dissolve it. And even if the Malfoys had books on the subject, they wouldn’t experiment on their own son, would they? It would be unsafe, even if it
Bewildered, Harry looked back to the table, where Fleur was just reaching out to stroke a strand of Draco’s hair between thumb and forefinger. The monster that had lain dormant inside him for weeks woke up and hissed. ‘Don’t touch him,’ he wanted to spit. Abruptly, Draco lifted his gaze and stared at him. Then he smiled sweetly and said something to Fleur in French. She let go of his hair, pivoted on the spot, and saw them standing by the stairs.
“Now on to a different matter,” the Professor said brusquely.
Draco eyed him for a moment longer and then nodded sharply.
“Here, help us up,” he commanded.
“Yes, well. That’s just Ginny. She has a bit of a temper.”
“You are right, I am no potions master. Fortunately, I have an assistant who is more versed in that area than I am,” he said, gesturing towards Mr. Al-Keydari.
Harry slumped against the wall. He could hear Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the kitchen. He just knew she would ask him about his talk with Draco, so he went upstairs instead and sat down on his bed listlessly. This day’d had more than enough excitement. His body felt sluggish. Come to think of it – he hadn’t really gotten that much sleep the night before. He took off his glasses, lay down and closed his eyes.
“Oh,” Draco said, “You really don’t know,” with a slight frown and a tip of his head.
“Well, if you insist, I will of course cease calling you familiar names
Her eyes glowed with affection and a hint of sadness. Harry lowered his eyes.
Draco seemed to see something in his expression, because after a moment, he nodded stiffly and drew himself up.
Then he sat back, thinking for a moment.
Draco lifted the book. Harry leaned closer and squinted to decipher the title.
Harry felt his cheeks heat. He ducked his head. “Yes, I… that might be a good idea.”
“Oh, Ron, Harry, you don’t mind, do you? I’ll be right back!” she said and out the door she was.
Hermione elbowed him in the ribs.
He gestured towards the door.
When her husband had handed the items over, she carefully cleaned the wound with the salve and bandaged it. Then she just held Draco’s hand in hers. “Look at me, young man.” Draco lifted his head immediately and looked at her. “It was a foolish thing to do, but it must have taken you great courage to do it.” She patted his hand and let go.
The familiarity of the transfiguration office was comforting. Red dominated the room no matter where you looked.
“Yes,” he ground out.
Hermione tensed. “We have more important things to do than hot cross buns! We have to speak to Dumbledore immediately. Come on, boys.” She strode towards the floo but Fleur cut off her way.
“I’m sorry,” Harry tried to say, but only a croak emerged.
Harry and Draco have a heart-to-heart. And also something else.
And even if he had to demean himself, he would not lose this. This Bond was his strength now, his anchor and his weapon.
When Draco pulled off
“So, how come you were invited to help with this case? You are not a potions master, as far as I can tell,” she asked him with a small, triumphant smile.
“That is no laughing matter!” Draco protested in mock outrage.
To all those who are on their own and would rather be with the people they love; despair not! There will be a next time when you can be together. You will get through this week and life will go on and you will be fine! You are loved :)
Mrs. Weasley didn’t look the slightest bit inclined to lessen Ron’s sentence, however. Her hands had taken permanent residence on her hips and her cheeks were flushed an angry red.
“Oh, for… you know exactly what I meant!” Harry scraped his chair back from the table as he shot up and started walking back and forth between the kitchen and the living room. “How can you be so… so… argh!”
Harry opened his mouth to say… something, but strands of hair plastered themselves onto his tongue.
Harry hesitated. How could he explain this without Ron blowing the roof off the house?
“Well…” Mr. Al-Keydari said again. He glanced at the man to his right, but Mr. Reichel didn’t seem to mind either way. “If you want to, you could have a look at our office library. We take it with us wherever we go, so we’ve got it in our rooms, just down the corridor.”
“Yes, of course. This way.”
“Good morning, Harry,” Bill answered, broad smile showcasing his white teeth.
She sniffed.
“While being worn, they leech a tiny but steady thread of magical power from the person wearing them. It’s why they are considered Dark by some. They cannot be removed violently but have to be freely given. Once the wearer puts them down, they become invisible to everyone’s eyes but theirs. The strength they hold must be immense. They have been held by the Malfoy family for generations and generations. The bearer can use the power within to cast spells. I’ve heard other rumours about them, but that’s all I know for certain.”
“You have no idea,” Harry said. “Have you heard of submarines?” He widened his eyes playfully.
Bill took a sip of his tea, and grimaced. It was stone cold.
Mr. Weasley came in from the shed and Harry helped Mrs. Weasley with the rest of dinner preparations. He listened bemusedly to Draco navigating his way through a conversation about radios and toasters with an enthusiastic Mr. Weasley all throughout dinner. Occasionally, Draco would glance in Harry’s direction with that same put-upon look from before, but to Harry’s ongoing astonishment and Mrs. Weasley’s obvious amusement, managed to hold his own.
She tensed and then flew away from him, her face a red moon.
Draco’s eyes gleamed.
“Forgive me. I am… quick to jump into discussions. Tell me, how are you doing? How is Master Malfoy?” he asked. He was still studying Harry more intently than he felt comfortable with, but at least his tone had evened.
Draco was standing by the door, watching him.
He shook his head slightly. He was just being paranoid.
If he hadn’t faced Voldemort on his own on a graveyard aged fourteen, he might have said this had been the worst experience of his life.
“I apologise on behalf of my blood,” here he drew his wand across his left palm and blood started pooling in it’s centre,” for any insult or injury to any member of your line caused by any member of my line. I am your servant, excluding all services owned by my Bonded, until I pay the price you name by which I would be free.”
Without another look back, he fairly sprinted towards the end of the carriage and shot through the door. He was just closing it behind him, when he noticed the woman in the dark coat leaning against the opposite wall, watching him. Her small, purple hat was slightly tilted, sitting atop mousy grey hair.
“Hermione…” Harry said, spluttering past Hemione’s locks. He didn’t know where to put his hands, so he just patted her back awkwardly. How on earth had Draco managed to deal with this so effortlessly yesterday?
Now, he sat at the dining table, stunned, disbelieving eyes sweeping over the scene. The kitchen was an unholy mess. Pots and pans lay scattered. Shards of broken glasses, cups and plates were strewn across the floor and counter tops and even some of the windows were cracked. The armchair Mr. Weasley had sat in was still upside down and half the chairs were in pieces, all of them toppled over. The flour bag Mrs. Weasley had placed on the counter had been flung against the wall, exploded in a loud bang and by now the flour had set on every surface of the room and made the scene look eerily like a cheap Christmas shopping window display. Even Fleur looked a little dishevelled as she danced about the room, righting furniture and muttering
Harry had written a single line:
“Well,” he said after a while, “Ginny just wants me to be keeper all the time so she can ‘practice her aiming and trick shots’.” The last was delivered with a whining lilt. “We did play a few games over the summer, but Fred and George are always busy, either with their shop or doing secret stuff for the order.”
“Harry.”
“Well, we can’t get to Hogwarts on our own,” he answered slowly. “I don’t know where Hedwig is, but when we stay somewhere long enough, she might catch up and we could contact Dumbledore.”
“We found a… different solution. I don’t understand any of it, you would have to speak to Professor Dumbledore…”
“Noo?” Harry replied.
“Don’t you fret, Harry, it was just an accident and she’ll be right as rain in no time. The headmaster kindly allowed her to stay in the Hogwarts infirmary overnight, so Poppy can keep an eye on her for a few more hours. It was just a concussion and a few bruises, nothing serious,” Mrs. Weasley said and patted his hand. “However, you might want to speak to Professor Dumbledore about some extra lessons in keeping that temper of yours in check. Combined with your magic’s strength, it could land you in big trouble someday. As an adult member of magical society, it’s important you learn sufficient control over you magic.”
Draco turned around in bewildered outrage. It was so easy to rile him.
There was a warmth in her face that smoothed out some of the lines framing her mouth and eyes.
“Alright,” he said slowly.
Harry scratched his head.
“That’s not actually what I wanted to talk about. Can’t we not argue for five minutes straight?”
“Well-“ Hermione started, but it seemed the angry man was not finished.
It felt like a lifetime ago. His main ambition had been trying to pass his days without punching Draco in the face and waiting for school to begin so everything could go back to normal. Trying not to punch Draco had soon turned into trying not to complete the bond by applying Hermione’s suggestion, but that’d turned out to be a waste of time and energy.
But first, he had to get Ron his dinner.
“Mrs. Weasley, Mr. Weasley, we have never been formally introduced. My name is Draco Ignatius Abraxus Malfoy, thirty-seventh of the line of Armand Malfoy. I have been welcomed into this house under Sanctuary together with my Bonded,” he straightened and gestured towards Harry” by your son William Arthur Weasley.” He took a deep breath, then went down on one knee and took out his wand. Mrs. Weasley gasped.
“She’s mad as a hatter,” George whispered to Harry, eyes sparkling, as he stepped into the grate.
“Let me ‘elp you, Molly.” Fleur got up and put on her apron.
Silence reigned.
Please Enjoy.
“You know what, I think she will be just fine. But you can wait for her, I really don’t mind,” he said with a quick smile and walked to the door.
“I didn’t say you weren’t, I just-“
“Apparate? You can apparate?” Harry stared at him. “But you are underage!”
“Better, actually, for the show will go on in perpetuity, in the best-case scenario.”
“What does it do?”
Ron handed her another tissue.
“I talk about him however I like, Potter. It’s not like he ever did anything for me or my family. Or any Slytherin, for that matter,” Draco spat.
“Don’t you dare talk to me about fairness, Potter!” Draco hissed. He twisted in his seat to get as far away from Harry as the armrest would allow and glared at him. Something inside Harry trembled.
Hermione’s eyes went huge like saucers. Tentatively, she lifted her hand and with a quizzical look, touched his forehead, stroking a finger over where the scar used to be tenderly.
He turned around and fell asleep swiftly.
“Can you please go back to your usual prattish self now? I really can’t cope with this meek version of you.”
“If you look at him like that again, I shall have to teach you what it means to be Bonded to a Malfoy,” he purred.
Harry eyed Draco from beneath his fringe. This careful civility was so unlike him. His face was carefully neutral and it was only now, seeing it devoid of any emotion but polite attention, that Harry realised how open Draco’s demeanour had become around him over the last few weeks. He missed that other Draco with a sudden and fierce, hot jolt.
Draco groaned.
Puzzled, he blew on his tea to cool it. What was Draco doing at the cottage? He could have said something, really. Now that he knew Draco was indisposed, the urge to take him along became nearly unbearable.
And now he was a bonded man. Burdened with responsibility for yet another person. He felt like his appearance should reflect the added weight his circumstances had saddled him with. And if he looked closely, wasn’t there a more determined cast to his mouth? A little more conviction in his gaze? Maybe a tiny amount of added confidence in his stance?
They locked eyes grimly. Harry took everything back. Draco could hold his own in a fight quite without his help.
“That’s a good question,” he said, letting the tea bag drop into his cup.
On his way back to the Guest Wing, Harry got lost twice.
Ron snickered. “You know Hermione and I-“
his only son than become beholden to a blood traitor family, even if he might have been able to work the bonding itself to his advantage a few years ago.
“Harry, I’m so sorry we left, but the gentleman was not to be swayed,” she whispered loudly, throwing a look over her shoulder at the gentleman in question. If Harry hadn’t been standing in Scotland’s only wizarding school, he would have thought the man a muggle. He was wearing a black suit, a slim, dark grey vest and tie and shiny leather shoes. The way he sat on the sofa he looked about as comfortable in this hodgepodge of a room as a swan might in a chicken pen.
When they got off the train at last, it was pitch dark beyond the puddles of light underneath the streetlamps.
“Please, call me Maria, Harry. I am fabuloso, thank you. What brings you here? I understand term does not start until September?”
Draco gave him one of those looks that said 'I knew you were stupid, Potter, but I had no idea as to your particular kind of idiocy'.
scared…” he sniggered.
“Ah.”
“See you!” Harry said and hurried to catch up with Professor McGonagall, who was waiting at the next intersection of corridors. Unfamiliar corridors.
However, he was actually sitting in the warm, happy, cluttered kitchen of the burrow. Home to a family Draco had insulted time and again. A family, whose only daughter had nearly been killed by his father. Quietly eating breakfast next to a boy he had insulted, threatened, taunted and even kicked in the face when he was unable to defend himself. How in Merlin’s name could he be so …placid? How could he talk to Bill and Fleur as if he were their friend? How could he sit here with Harry as if they really were… bonded.
“Harry! What in the name of sweet Morgana are you doing here?” the voice asked, not unkindly.
“Excuse me boys, just moving through,” a high-pitched voice sounded.
“Hermione?” Ron groaned from the bed, lifting his head from the pillows just enough to glance towards them through a cracked eye.
“I…” Draco faltered. His eyes moved around the room, jumping from the table to the counter, to the clock on the wall rapidly. Bill could see the wheels turning in his head. “Nothing!” Draco said at last, a bit desperately. “I thought this through dozens of times! It’s absolutely watertight!”
“Let’s finish this and then head back,” he said.
. Her every step puffed up a small white mushroom.
The staccato of Maria’s heeled foot hitting the floor beat almost the same rhythm as Harry’s heart. How was he going to get out of this without having his head bitten off by this woman?
“I’m sorry,” he said with a little laugh. “Yusuf Al-Keydari. At your service.”
“I work for Gringotts.” Bill smiled a dangerous smile that made his eyes glitter. “You learn a lot about the old families and their riches by listening and speaking to the right goblins.”
He sounded very excited about this prospect. Harry had never thought about any of these things and by the look on Ron’s face, neither had he.
Professor McGonagall sighed deeply and fidgeted with her pen.
Harry wanted to do it again.
“You’ll do no such thing. I’ll go,” he said and rushed out the door.
“Exactly,” Ron said. “He is playing you for a fool.”
Ron’s mouth twisted, but he sat up and put the biscuits on the table.
“Why are you helping me?” Draco asked at last, quietly.
“Don’t be absurd, Potter. Did you forget? We are Bonded. For life. I’m aware you don’t know a lot about wizarding traditions, but surely even you can guess that that is enough of a reason to share a bed, not to mention a living?”
“A problem, poppet?” Malfoy asked.
He had to console her somehow, help her calm down.
“Quite the tale,” Bill huffed eventually.
“Do you know what Professor McGonagall wants to talk to you about?” Hermione asked Harry with a tilt of her head.
“Is Draco still asleep?” Harry asked, half to change the subject and half because he had just thought about whether they shouldn't take him along, too.
“Here we are,” Professor McGonagall said a few minutes later, as she was coming up to her office. She brandished her wand and the heavy wood door opened. They stepped inside.
Very deliberately, Draco lifted his left hand to drag his fingertips up Harry’s arm and shoulder leisurely, leaving goose bumps in his wake. His fingers lingered on Harry's neck before twisting into his hair suddenly. Harry gave a low hiss, whether of pain or pleasure, he didn't know himself. Draco used his leverage to tilt Harry’s head to the side. His lips ghosted over the shell of Harry’s ear.
“Ronald Bilius Weasley!”
“Bugger.”
Mr. Reichel approached them and shook both their hands.
“Ron…” he started. “I… I am sorry for not writing about everything before.”
“They were thoroughly checked for any kind of maleficent magic or spells, of course, but please open it up for me once, to make sure nothing escaped our attention,” Professor McGonagall said.
Draco sat up abruptly. “My choice to get you tea, you imbecile. What did you think? I would put up with this household if I weren’t sure of you?”
Harry trailed off. He had not spoken to Dumbledore about what he could safely reveal. More importantly, he hadn’t spoken to Draco about what to tell people. Would he even be comfortable with the public knowing? Was this whole case classified information? He had to tell her something, though.
Bill chortled.
It just wasn’t like Draco, except, apparently it was, because he couldn’t have kept up that kind of behaviour if it were all an act, could he? Was it more likely Harry had never noticed this side of him? Or maybe he’d simply never had an opportunity to notice it? It’s not like Draco had ever felt the need to be attentive to him before, or his friends. Or anyone, probably, except for his family.
He sat back and swept his eyes around the room. It really was very colourful. Draco would have a fit. ‘This isn’t decoration, this is abuse! Who allowed that man to misuse a perfectly proportioned room to such an extent?’ Harry’s cheeks hurt from grinning just thinking about it. He’d have to show it to him as a surprise without telling him where they were going when term started.
Harry looked over at Draco who lifted his right shoulder in an elegant shrug.
“You really sure it’ll be enough?” Ron asked. He was stretched out on his bed reading the Qidditch Times.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked. He looked around sceptically. “Who cultivates marshes in their back garden? Ugh, it’s revolting. My shoes are ruined!”
Draco cupped his face and put his forehead against his own. It felt uniquely intimate. Intimate, but calming.
Draco furrowed his brow.
“Why ever
danger. Now they have no legal hold over me and therefor
Harry touched his head and inspected his eyes with his fingers. He was half convinced they’d changed shape.
“Are you mad? That place is crawling with people who would turn us over in a second.”
“Those points were deserved! And Snape takes away so many of Gryffindors points for no reason at all, it’s only fair we get…”
They both sighed theatrically and batted their eyelashes at Harry.
Still, breaking the Bond was no option.
He blew his nose and found himself staring at Draco’s initials, wondering again why he was being so attentive. Considerate, even. Caring to the point of awkwardness.
Ron stood by the stairs, looking as shocked as Harry felt, face changing slowly from disbelief to outrage.
Draco lifted his eyebrows.
Harry gave a sigh. He gladly took the much-needed breathing room.
Mr. Reichel pointedly did not look at his companion, instead leaning forward to take a sip of his tea.
“What?” Harry wanted to know. “You do too, right?”
Then he remembered Harry’s eyes reflected in the window as he had thought: ‘beautiful’. Harry’s eyes on him in the garden, the same sharp focus of his green gaze. Slowly, warmth replaced the cold dread clinging to his thoughts. He let himself fall back into the mattress and think of green eyes instead of blue, of a hot temper and gentle hands and a blushing neck.
Draco’s lips, when they met his, felt different than they had before when they’d kissed. There was no movement, just a lingering. It was like a consolation and a promise. Harry felt tears in the corners of his eyes. What was happening?
“All done, I’m decent,” he pronounced and made space on his bunk bed, shifting blankets and cushions aside. “Come, take a seat.” He sat down cross legged at the head and patted the mattress in front of him.
He trailed off.
Bill’s uproarious laughter echoed through the cottage. Who would have guessed Draco would be so much fun?
“Okay,” Harry said, “but can you please stop saying bugger?”
“Au revoir, ‘Arry!” Fleur said, as she kissed his cheeks. Bill clapped Ron on the shoulder and Fleur made him blush as she kissed him in goodbye, too. “Au revoir, Ron!”
“Yes, but… how can you just accept all this so easily and move on?” Harry asked bewildered. This was what he really wanted to know, he realised.
Harry stumbled backwards and lifted his hands placatingly for the second time in under half an hour. The man straightened, pocketing his wand. The menacing aura around him disappeared so suddenly, Harry must have imagined it. The man seemed as unassuming as his colourful clothing suggested. He smiled ruefully at Harry and cleared his throat.
“So, what’s that plant you gave Mrs. Weasley,” Harry asked aggressively, putting the cup back down on the desk.
He should just go back to the Burrow and let Hermione explain everything to Professor Dumbledore.
“Well,” Mrs. Weasley said, seemingly flustered. “Well. I guess in that case.” She wrung her hands.
What was so funny? Why was Draco so comfortable? It’s not like he’d ever been there before. Right? It’s not like they were friends. Hadn’t he been really jealous of Bill not two nights back?
“I give up. It’s just not fair with you on that broom,” Ron panted as he lay in the grass, chest heaving. Harry sat down next to him.
Bill got a tin from a cupboard, sat down across from them, and fixed them with a stern look.
The thought emerged from some repressed corner of his brain sluggishly and Harry tried to actively resist it, because it couldn’t be, it
Instinctively, Harry scooted back on the bed, but before he was even half-way up, he had a face full of bushy curls and a lap full of a sobbing Hermione.
“Where is Mr. Malfoy? He cannot be far, sí?” she asked.
Fascination wrestled with mindless pleasure, but the second won out as he came up towards that crest he was searching. He could feel his toes curl even before it started and when it hit him, he had to cling to Draco to keep upright. His knees bent slightly and his hips twitched rhythmically. He was buried inside Draco’s mouth as deeply as he could go, clutching his hair and Draco swallowed and swallowed, and shook with his own release. It lasted longer than Harry had expected and when he was finally done, he slowly unclenched his fists and moved back on unsteady feet to give Draco some space. They were both gasping, Draco pulling in huge gulps of air. His eyes were still closed and his head was leaned back against the wall, exposing his long, pale throat. His fingers were covered with his pleasure and even his trousers had gotten their fair share. Harry pulled his boxers up over himself and sat down on the floor in front of him, looking for signs of distress.
He hadn't even felt him leave...
“Hermione,  I… I’m not wearing anything underneath that blanket,” is what came out of his mouth.
Draco pulled off.
He started upright. The same powerful urge to protect Draco had roared to life and caused so much damage yesterday. He had to remain calm.
“I see,” Mr. Reichel said.
“Am I not to get breakfast, my angel?” He asked, noticing his lack of a plate.
“Well, either your sense of direction needs serious improving, or your good friends, the Weasleys, have warded you out of their property.”
Draco nodded at him and as Harry was creeping up the stairs, balancing the plate on one hand, he heard Mr. Weasley say: “Well, Draco. Molly and I had a talk with Bill over the floo earlier and we all…” before he moved around the corner and the voices became too quiet to make out clearly. Should he go back and listen?
Here it came. Harry was sure of it.
“Muggles are such odd creatures,” he announced, sitting down with enough reading material to cover the next five hours.
Draco flinched. Good. He was on the defensive, now. Thrown off balance, easy to read.
It was Professor McGonagall.
“Well,” Draco said, visibly taken aback.
“But, we are not even of age!” Harry objected with more vehemence this time.
This, Harry had to concede, was a good point.
“You don’t really want to know,” he said dejectedly.
“Ah, yes. Harry, my dear, why don’t you take that up to Ronald, he must be very hungry,” she said distractedly, pushing a plate into Harry’s hands. Potatoes and mushrooms were piled high, surrounded by peas and carrots, drowned in gravy.
“Uh, yeah, actually,” Harry said. “For starters, please don’t call me that stupid name in public anymore.”
If only Mrs. Weasley knew what kind of extra lessons Professor Dumbledore had been taking with him. She would be horrified to know Harry had supported him in finding heavily warded, cursed and volatile pieces of Voldemort’s soul and worked on understanding his twisted worldview, in order to destroy him with that knowledge.
Please enjoy!
“There is another matter. Concerning your private relation with Mr. Malfoy.”
“Uhhh… did I miss something?” He asked Bill stupidly.
“Hey!” Ron said. “I can be insightful. I’m insightful all the time.”
“Sorry, I am so sorry,” he said in between crying tears of delight, “but it’s just such an incredible circumstance. The only Malfoy heir, beholden to the Weasley family!”
Harry hesitated. Mr. Al-Keydari picked up on Harry’s indecision instantly. His mouth twitched.
“Hallo. Reichel,” he said in clipped tones.
“Well, I…” Draco trailed off. He was deep in thought, but what about? His cloudy eyes were distant again, unseeing. Bill hated not knowing something. He had to get a better grasp of this boy, and soon.
“Let’s take wagers on who kills whom first,” George smirked.
“I forgot,” he mumbled and turned pleading eyes to Ron. “She is going to kill me!”
“You know, I’m thankful he saved your life. But from what you said, it was a spur of the moment decision he made under pressure and I’m sure he only thought of the consequences afterwards. He wasn’t willing to let you die when he could prevent it and that shows he’s a human being but it doesn’t mean he has changed.”
“Of course I can apparate. I was taught by my Father when I was twelve. I can’t normally use it, because of the trace, but these are my Mother’s Providing Pearls. Now shut up and concentrate.”
He smirked at Draco.
Draco snorted. “As is comes, Fleur is quite handy with all the wardrobe and cosmetic charms I never bothered to learn.”
“Not that it’s very likely I’ll stay the heir for much longer, anyway. But there is nowhere else I’d want to be. Some are moving to France.” He shuddered. “It’s nice for a holiday, but who’d like to spend an entire life there?” he asked in apparent revulsion. “They’re so… rude. No etiquette in the purist circles. And did you know it takes nearly twenty minutes to get a glass of water in a Parisienne café?”
doing here?” He added, rounding on Draco, who sat in his chair, not a hair out of place, while everything and everyone around him looked like a gang of pixies had given it their all to tear down the place. A drunken, furious gang of pixies who had come back to their nest after a good round of beers in the pub around the corner, only to find their front door knocked down and their grandmothers abducted and had then sworn to take revenge on the next best wizarding lair they came across.
“Oh no, I didn’t mean it like that!” she was quick to reassure him. “I just think those are really interesting questions and finding answers would do so much to further tolerance and acceptance of squibs and muggleborns. Did you take some of your material with you? Did you publish your findings? Could I borrow some?” she asked, nearly falling off the sofa in her excitement.
“Vhe where doing no such zing,” Mr. Reichel contradicted. “Vhe vhere vhondering how it is zat Dumbledore has neglected to-“
“I’m sure he didn’t lie about that. We can ask Hermione, she would know.”
It was just as bad as the first time he had been side-alonged by Professor Dumbledore. At first there was a twisting sensation, starting from his arm connected to Draco. Then everything went dark and a sudden weight pushed at his body from all sides at once. His eyes and ears were pressed into his skull and he couldn’t breathe at all. At last they were spat out underneath the open sky on a stretch of wet marshland.
“It was glorious,” Fred – or was it George? – declared, before Harry could even open his mouth. The twins had exited the floo right as Ginny had drawn her wand and thus witnessed the whole sordid spectacle.
“I’m sorry.”
“You- stop patronising me!” Draco hissed.
She fixed him with blue, steely eyes.
Ron was still tense. His brow was furrowed and he was unnaturally quiet, even though they hadn’t seen each other in five weeks.
He did not know how long he wailed into Draco’s embrace. He cried for his mother and father. He cried for his lost childhood, full of love and affection. He cried for Sirius. He cried for the crushing weight of expectation on his shoulders. He cried and he cried and he cried.
He grimaced. “It’s just not something to write in a letter. I wasn’t even sure what I thought about it myself. And if everything had happened the way we’d thought with the unfettering brew, it certainly wouldn’t have mattered.”
“Charlie’s name is Charlus?” Harry asked incredulously.
“Now, how come you are here and not at Malfoy Manor, where you were to be until school started?” She asked and sat down next to Draco.
Harry took a deep breath. It seemed like Professor McGonagall was not angry with him. He got up and knelt down in front of the Gryffindor chest. When he touched it, he felt his familiar protective magic on it.
“That’s what
Harry closed his mouth slowly and gave a slow nod.
Harry stared into his tea.
He grinned lopsidedly and shrugged.
“I know this is not how you planned to spend your last year at Hogwarts, and for all it is worth, I am sorry.”
Harry stood there thunderstruck. He opened his mouth to… what? Deny being bonded? The Weasleys would find out soon enough. A nervous laugh escaped him. At the sound, Bill, who had been staring at Draco’s wand incredulously, looked over at him.
Harry was torn between laughing out loud and reaching out to comfort him. Draco seemed genuinely distressed at his lacking resources of proper attire, visiting the Weasley’s, of all people. Leave it to a Malfoy to stay absolutely calm in the face of a horde of death eaters with their terrifying spectral hounds and lose their composure over a rumpled shirt.
!” He clutched the necklace in his fist. “I’m not fit to be seen like this! I didn’t take a single shirt! I mean, obviously I didn’t, it’s not like I expected to need a full wardrobe for a bit of cleaning up the estate walls, but… I don’t even have a change of….”
Apparently, it was Harry’s job to stop ignoring the dragon in the room. “So… we arrived at the Dursley’s…” he started after a while and told Ron the whole story from the beginning, putting in things he had left out in his letters, like how Draco had cowed the Dursley’s into submission and how they’d been to Diagon together. They laughed ten solid minutes as Harry recounted the pixies incident, but Ron grew very still when Harry talked about how Draco had been punished by his father. Ron’s mood was pensive as Harry described the healing and stayed that way until Fleur called them both inside for a late lunch.
Harry sighed. “Hermione… I already know Mrs. Malfoy did that on purpose, because Draco deduced exactly the same thing just minutes after we safely landed our brooms. He wasn’t trying to convince me of anything. And believe me when I say, he had no idea. Just… trust me on this, ok?” He looked at her earnestly.
Before he could turn around, the door opened and he stood face to face with a tall man who carried himself like every inch of his body was under his conscious command. The time it took Harry to blink twice, the man had taken a step out of the room, closed the door behind himself with his right hand and pointed his wand low towards Harry’s gut with his left. His stance was defensive but he looked ready to strike in an instant, with only little effort involved.
They discussed it for another five minutes, but everyone Draco knew wasn’t safe and Harry had no idea where any of his other friends lived. They’d both had enough of Hermione’s prodding the last time around, so the Burrow it was.
This chapter earns the "mature" rating, so if that's not your cup of tea, I will post lines in the notes at the end (I'm not going to spoiler the others by posting them here), so you can have a look at them now and skip that part, if you want. Heed the tags.
His father had striven to make him into a blade of steel. Cunning, cold, unyielding, eager to exploit the weaknesses of his enemies, to thrust into the soft and hidden places. At the same time, he was meant to be a lump of clay. Pliable, lukewarm, spineless – moulded into any shape by the same hand that would wield the dagger. His mother’s quiet education had been towards a different purpose. She had warned him to be like a willow tree. Strongly rooted in the earth, but bending with the wind, so as not to break whilst facing the storm. Proudly humble, boldly reserved, shrewdly gracious.
Ron leaned back against the wall and pulled up his knees.
Harry’s mouth dropped open. How in Merlin’s name had Draco done that? Harry had only ever seen Mr. Weasley placate Mrs. Weasley like that and never with such ease.
Ron didn’t look happy about it, but he bowed to the wisdom of his older brother, or maybe he knew what was in store for them if Mrs. Weasley came back and found them lazing about. They all got to work quickly. He and Ron helped collect the broken shards and put them on the table in neat piles, sorted by colour and material, as much as was possible. Unsurprisingly, the twins were very handy with fixing charms. They put every item back together and Fleur rinsed each one before putting it away. In the meantime, Bill did his best to get rid of the flour with vanishing and cleaning charms. Finally, they repaired the last of the broken chairs and the cracked windows. They were done before the clock stroke two. Everything was clean and tidy. Tidier than it had been before, to tell the truth. The twins flooed home to their flat above the shop to work on a few ideas Aunt Adalberta had supposedly given them.
There was a short pause.
“Well?” Harry asked, raising his eyebrows in mimicry of Draco’s usual gesture. Two could play at this game!
Ron was sitting on his small balcony, watching the night. When Harry stepped outside, Ron glanced at him and went right back to studying the sky.
His mind played the scene over and over. It couldn’t be… that was how Malfoy saw him, could it? That dark, alluring figure with roguishly tousled hair and rounded lips.
“It’s in the name, Potter. Ever-green? You plant it in your garden and it protects the other flowers from bad weather.”
Ron frowned and gave him a disbelieving look, but some of the tension left his body.
“It’s a charmed plant. A simple Evergreen spell, if you must know.”
Unhurriedly he got up and padded through the hall, down the flights of stairs and into the kitchen. Yawning and scratching his head, he settled at the table.
Harry smiled, but a tongue of sadness flickered up inside. He’d missed out on things here while he had been busy dealing with his own problems. He’d been totally absorbed in Draco, hadn’t he? Grimacing, he remembered last year’s sneaking about. Maybe that wasn’t actually a new phenomenon.
Draco’s hand in his felt nice. Comfortable. He wondered what it would feel like, sleeping in the same bed, the way they were now.
“You smell like me,” he said stupidly, gaze dropping to Draco’s mouth.
Harry nearly snorted tea through his nose. Had Draco just… commandeered biscuits for him? This whole situation kept getting weirder and weirder.
“No, I mean yes, that’s fine. Thank you,” Harry replied.
Fleur had not been amused when he’d rushed off in the afternoon the day before, but what was he to do? No warning, no information, no preparation. And then Friday had happened with the two lovebirds just swanning into the Burrow like… well. Like somebody was after them. And then Saturday was even worse. Couldn’t the Malfoy boy NOT get bonded to somebody for a bloody day? Lifelong servitude, honestly.
Harry blinked. Sirius' name left a dull throb in his ribcage. He had expected his all-too-familiar temper to rise halfway through that tirade, but it hadn’t. The anger, like a burning sea of rage that had become less and less controllable over the last year – it did not come. He felt a bit overwhelmed at Ron’s ire and he was annoyed Ron brought Draco’s trustworthiness up again. He shared Ron’s worry for his family and then realised he
“Did you get sent a change of clothes after all?”
Bill leaned back in his chair. His nose twitched again.
Harry elected not to tell him about his vault full of coins just yet.
Harry wanted to retort something, but Ron grabbed his shoulder.
Bill takes things in hand (not what you think, get your mind out of the gutter!) and Harry has two interesting conversations.
“You mean magical core diseases?” she asked.
“Don’t take it meanly, Harry-”
With a last twitch of the corner of his mouth, Draco opened the door.
“…never felt it to be necessary. It is said Harry Potter is a great sorcerer. Ve all know ze story, of course. Vhy vas he not apprenticed in a Guild? Or sent to a Internat for gifted?”
“-was ready to rip Malfoy’s throat right out-”
He cleared his throat and tried again.
“Well, that’s good, isn’t it?” Ron said. “Whatever it was, it had something to do with your scar. It must have something to do with the night You-Know-Who…”
Mr. Weasley nodded.
“Uh, I’m here to see Professor Dumbledore about something, actually.”
Harry stepped back from the door. Should he go in? He wasn’t particularly keen on meeting the owner of the voice. Something told him the angry man would have no compunctions to say the exact same things to his face. And the way he put it – he was right, wasn’t he? Harry was just a teenager. How
The Professor gestured to the chair in front of her desk and sat down behind it. Harry sat down, too.
Draco rolling his eyes.
“Furthermore, you are a married couple in the eyes of the law and even though the current situation is somewhat… unusual, Hogwarts rules are very clear on providing housing and quarters.”
That had been… something. If Draco knew, Harry would never hear the end of it. He would spend the rest of his earthly existence being torturously reminded of having gotten
“I –“ Draco began, but then the floo lit up with bright green flames and Molly Weasley came stepping out the grate. She landed nearly on top of Harry.
With this proclamation she spun on her heel and marched out the room, backside swaying from side to side as she went.
“What?” Harry squeaked.
Harry eyed him. Draco seemed perfectly sincere.
“Basically, Draco saved my life.”
“It’ll be alright,” Harry said. “Let’s just get there first and then maybe your mum can send you a set.”
“Well. If you would be so kind as to show me the way to my room.”
“You heard Hartmuth, ey? He can be a little… fierce, but I can vouch for him. He is a very noble-hearted man,” Mr. Al-Keydari said.
“Shut up. I noticed the way you looked at Ginny earlier in the year, and she’s practically your sister, too,” he countered.
Harry felt like he was floating. Something that had held him securely on the ground had been cut loose.
“Uhm, Professor… What is this corridor?”
“Uh, thanks.” Harry mumbled.
“Oh!” she said abruptly turned around on her heels, searching the room.
And then Draco recounted it all again. Harry would have thought him to be reluctant, but he left nothing out and gave great detail when Mrs. Weasley interjected questions to clarify something. Harry’s ears went hot a few times during the history and Mr. Weasley cleared his throat nervously when it came to the sleeping arrangements. Draco made it quite clear what they had been up to. His face flushed unbecomingly, but he never paused his recounting. Fleur listened to it all with an indulgent smile. Bill merely cocked his head when he heard information that seemed to interest him, especially when it came to Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy’s behaviour. Mrs. Weasley exclaimed in shocked outrage at Draco’s description of the caning and patted Harry’s cheek when he spoke of how Harry had helped him up the stairs and healed his wounds. “Well done, Harry,” she said. When Draco finished at last with their arrival at the burrow, the table was steeped in a contemplative hush.
Bill laughed. He couldn’t help himself. He was beginning to warm up to the boy.
“What do we do now?” he quietly asked Hermione. “Do we just wait here for Professor Dumbledore?”
“Not one word!” she said tightly with her finger raiser in his direction.
“No, we are uh… staying over at Ron’s place until term starts,” Harry said, gesturing towards Ron, who waved awkwardly.
“I’m going to apparate us. But you have to be the link. Think about where you want to go. Picture it in your mind, very clearly. Don’t think of anything else!”
“-if what mum tried to explain to Ginny can be believed.” They were both grinning madly, as if this was the finest joke they’d heard in a year.
“I sure hope so!”
Harry studied him from the side. His hair was even shaggier than before the holidays and could it be that he was a bit wider, as well?
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley stood next to the hearth in total silence. Harry was not entirely sure what the meaning of Draco’s gesture had been, but it’s effect had certainly been profound. If he understood correctly, then Draco had apologised? And offered something in the way of servitude? Was that to be taken literally or was it just a phrase of some kind?
He carded his hands through his hair. How often had Hermione told him it was important that he practiced control over his accidental magic? That he learn to keep his emotions in check? He had broken things before with his magic and had given people a scare, but never had he truly hurt anyone with an outburst.
In all honesty, Harry had never seen a woman like this in real life before. The girls from Beauxbatons had been pretty and angelic, but the way this woman held herself spoke of self-confidence in more than her looks.
“Not diseases, no. Alterations. It means ze changes are not yet known to the medicals or are not part of a verified disease. Zey can happen because of an accident or psychological problems or anyzing else. Every case is different to ze next, but ze subject suffers under zem, meaning pazological, unwanted,” he explained.

“So, his mum asked us to repair a broken wall on the edge of the estate. We flew over,” he held up the Numbus 2001, “and put the stones back on the wall. When we were finished and turned to go, one of the boulders tumbled loose and hit me in the chest.” Harry rubbed his breastbone unconsciously. “I’d healed Draco’s back before-“ at this Ron halted on the doorstep, gave him a dark look and opened his mouth, but Harry raised his voice, “-and so we knew it was possible. He came over and put his hands on my chest. The bone was coming out and it was… not looking good. Then he somehow… pulled, or pushed, and the wound closed up slowly. There was something else there, too, that he pulled out, somehow. This horrible green goo, it’s hard to explain. Anyway, my scar is gone,” he added and lifted his fringe.
Surprise everyone! I have so much to do that I have to publish this now, otherwise I will just keep working on it and I simply don't have the time to do that.
Harry shuffled his feet nervously. Draco leaned back in his chair, smirking. When Fleur reached him, she touched his shoulders lightly and kissed both his cheeks.
He leaned over and drained Hermione’s cup as well. Harry grimaced. If Ron and Hermione got any closer, they would start finishing each other's sentences like Fred and George.
“Yes, what?” he inquired, smiling beatifically.
“Yeah. I’ll take one of yours next time,” he said apologetically, plucking blades of grass and fiddling with them. He had expected Ron to have stomped inside and started a fight with Draco by now, or to shout at him some more, or at least to ask loads of angry passive-aggressive questions. However, he was just lying there, eyes closed, breathing deeply. The only outward sign he showed for any uneasiness were the lines on his forehead.
“Now, let’s get some sleep.” Draco said lightly, let go of his hair and pushed off the counter. He sauntered towards the stairs without looking back.
The two men looked at each other.
“Yes, exactly. But now, we can be apart, can’t we? We don’t actually
Hermione dithered for a moment longer, but then sighed and joined them at the table, throwing Fleur a dark look. Fleur seemed unperturbed as she served them buns, jam, chocolate spread and double cream. Cups of tea floated over as well and when she had finished wiping the counter, she sat down opposite Ron.
“Latin,” he said loftily with a toss of his head.
“Our dear sister-”
“Maybe it’s about the bonding. She must know, because she didn’t exactly seem surprised to see you here without the ferret,” Ron said.
Bill set his cup of tea down on the table and grabbed another tin box.
"Oh, shut up." Harry rolled his eyes but couldn’t supress an answering grin.
“I added somezeeng, but eet eez a zecret.” She winked.
“Touch my hair!” he groaned and made a move for Harry’s hand.
Ron’s shrieks of laughter echoed into the night and soon they were rolling across the floor, Ron shouting things like “Buggering!” and “Love!” and “Help! I’m being raped!” until Harry hit the plate with his elbow and it sailed straight off the balcony and landed in the garden with a thump and a crash.
“Not… not go back to the dormitories? Why would that…? …but we are still students!” Harry protested feebly.
How… How did he know about the case being closed? Had Hermione and Ron explained everything, then? Harry glared at Hermione, but she was busy staring at Mr. Al-Keydari with starry eyes, so he glared at Ron, instead.
“It’s all as it should be,” he said, getting up.
“It’s… not a very widely known spell,” Draco said carefully. “And it’s kind of one of Mother’s specialities, so Molly would not get hold of it under more ordinary circumstances.”
“However, it would not be prudent to allow Mr. Malfoy to enter the Slytherin Common Room, for his own protection. For the sake of fairness, this prohibition will be extended to both of you.”
“No, stop!” Harry yelled and threw himself at Ron to cover his mouth with his hands. “I don’t want to hear this!”
“-what was it that he did, Fred?”
“Oh, he saved your life, did he? Well, then everything is just
He rolled the magazine into a perfect weapon and whacked Ron’s arm with it.
Ron’s shoulders tensed as he went over to the sink to wash his hands. Harry winced. It seemed he had gravely misjudged Ron’s mood. When they’d talked earlier on, he’d seemed more... cheerful. Had something happened in the meantime?
Hey folks, thanks for your patience! I am uploading this chapter now, but I might change some small things about it, so don't be surprised when you reread it and some words are different. I just didn't want to make you wait any longer.
He wrung his hands.
“Put up with…?” Harry spluttered. “Is it so horrible to be treated decently and be cooked for and…”
“-defended his blushing bride-” (Draco glowered at them from the side)
There. See? Not nice. Wait, what?
Hermione opened the door, then turned around abruptly.
“You have no idea what it’s like to live in that school and get sideway glances whenever you set foot out the common room door! The only places we can relax are our own dormitories! It’s bad enough the other pupils treat us like a pest of sewage grindylows, but Snape is the only teacher who’s on our side! If you think for a minute that I will respect a man who turns a blind eye when children are being bullied whose only crime is belonging to the wrong house, you are clearly deranged!”
“Yes, exactly!” Hermione said. “We have a very deep connection.”
“What are you doing here anyway?” Ron continued. “Don’t get me wrong, mate,  I’m glad you’re here so we can keep an eye on the ferret,” he jerked his chin at Draco, “but didn’t his father insist you stayed there for the whole month?”
Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry stopped short. He hadn’t even though about it. She didn’t even know they were here! Harry slapped his face hard and shook his head, getting up.
As always, if you are early reading this chapter, I'm sure a few typos have found their way in. However, I thought you would rather have this now and I'll change a few words here and there over the next couple of days, instead of waiting another week for it. If you see any typos, don't hesitate to put it in a comment!
Then is face fell comically. He looked at Harry, eyes wide and shiny.
“Exactly. Well put,” he said.
“See you guys later, I guess. You’ll be here?” Harry interjected, before they got into serious bickering.
Obviously, he had been wrong.
family, in a more literal way even than the Weasley’s. Draco was his husband. Entirely and irrevocably.
“Say it.” Draco said gently but firmly.
Bill pondered this question while going through the soothing motions of boiling water, rinsing his cup and opening the tin box of tea bags.
Harry leaned against the doorway.
“He doesn’t ‘blatantly favour Gryffindor’,” Harry protested. How could they go from happily munching chocolate and huddling together to arguing in a minute?
“I’m sure you could have,” Bill said and walked over to ruffle Draco’s hair.
“I don’t actually know which one the twin’s room is,” he said with an elegant lift of a shoulder.
Draco’s smile turned predatory.
He got up numbly, following Mr. Weasley and Draco up the stairs. Mrs. Weasley, whose face was a bit pinched, was hot on their heels.
“What?” Harry croaked, blinking.
Mr. Al-Keydari shook his head and put his left hand over his mouth, which didn’t do much to disguise his snickering. Mr. Reichel frowned at him, but then looked back at Harry with a questioning mien.
“Well, nobody said anything about messing around with the bond, Harry. At least not without being a hundred percent sure you wont be hurt in the process” She narrowed her eyes at him and hummed. “Are you alright? Is there something else you haven’t told me yet?” She looked at Ron, too.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up. He got a calculating look for a second, but then nodded.
“She’s practically you sister, now,” Harry needled him as they went upstairs to take showers, “so you really shouldn’t pine after her so much.”
When Harry stumbled over a raised line of bricks surrounding the fireplace, he was surprised to see that he wasn’t in Dumbledore’s office at all, but in a comfortably decorated room filled with sofas and wall hangings and side tables. He had a moment of panic until he saw Ron and Hermione standing in the door talking to someone.
Draco however… He needed all the help he could get. The blood ritual had been a sloppy move.
Draco sighed in a way that somehow expressed his ongoing and deep dissatisfaction with life in general and got up with a look at Harry that clearly said “I don’t know why I do this for you and I hope you die an early death of the most painful kind” and stalked over to where Mrs. Weasley was gutting the chicken using increasingly aggressive methods.
“Arthur!” she said in a loud whisper, but Mr. Weasley just kept going. They went to the third floor and entered the first door on the right, which Harry had never opened before. It was a small room with one desk and one extra armchair. The walls were crammed with books, but it was surprisingly tidy.
“I understand perfectly, Miss Granger, but I have no way of contacting him at the moment. The only option I can offer is to send for a cup of tea so you can be comfortable while you wait for him to return.”
“Bonds like this are made by magic and based on consent and on…” she blushed an unbecoming shade of red that clashed with her hair.
“How could you tell? It’s not like you really know him.” Hermione crossed her arms. She was radiating ‘stubborn’.
This new, unplanned outlook on life also brought with it a kind of weightlessness he hadn’t ever experienced before. His insides still squirmed when he thought about the feeling of Draco’s mouth and the knowledge that this won’t have been the last time this sort of thing happened between them. In fact, as soon as they were out from underneath Mrs. Weasley's thumb, he might learn to get used to it. Maybe they could even–
Harry doubled over and would have fallen if Draco had not pulled him upright.
“That’s because it’s amusing to see you suffer. Your pain causes amusement. Your suffering is a constant source of satisfaction. It’s fun to-“
“Good evening,” she nodded at him brusquely. “Nice weather for a late outing, isn’t it?”
"Yor hair..." Harry said and sat back down, too, amused. Draco actually blushed, after everything they had just done, and furiosly tried to smooth it back down.
“Those are all valid arguments at first glance, but didn’t you forget about one tiny detail?” Bill asked, smiling. He was enjoying this a bit too much, maybe.
Draco's eyebrows flew straight into his hairline. “Are you for real? I give you
Draco looked about ready to faint. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He looked like a fish. Like a very pale, very terrified fish, who just found out he had to visit a fairy princess who lived fifty miles from shore and had a liking for skewered sea creatures.
“This is mine, yes. I can’t say for Draco’s, though…”
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him.
He shifted his focus and saw Bill sitting on a chair back to front, gesticulating wildly, then throwing his head back laughing, neck exposed. He couldn’t hear anything, but he felt the warm cup between Draco’s fingers and the chair underneath him. He was in a kitchen he’d never seen before. The walls and furniture where white-washed and a picture of Bill and Fleur in their wedding attire decorated the opposite wall. Their home, then.
“Aaargh!” he groaned, rubbing his face with both hands.
Good evening, my lovelies, it's been a while! My men have been ill, so I've done nothing but care for the sick over the last month. Didn't get anything done ._______.
“What do they do?” Harry asked around his fifteenth biscuit.
Harry’s heart quickened. He had half sprung out of his chair.
Harry faltered.
“We’ve all been friends since first year!” Hermione enthused. “It’s become a kind of ritual to stay together before term starts,” she said and eyed Harry in a way that seemed to be communicating something. Most likely how stupid he was being. Ron nearly gagged next to him, probably at the suggestion they had been
“Well?” Draco asked, eyebrow raised. “I know basic courtesy is not something you were taught, but a simple ‘thank you’ would have sufficed,” he said blandly, inspecting his fingernails. “I am already regretting my choice.”
“No, you forget ze Palestinian Apotheker who spilled a form of the binding potion on his camel,” the other man corrected.
“Harry, dear, come sit down with us. Would you like a cup of tea?” she asked after she noticed him. She waved her wand and a cup and saucer came neatly flying out the cupboard. They were in a different place than Fleur had put them before. Actually, there was a whole pile of kitchen utensils and crockery sitting on one of the sideboards, evidently wating to be sorted into their proper places. Harry thought Fleurs arrangement had been quite sensible, but he prudently held his tongue.
“Well, that’s why it’s called an Indissoluble Bond.”
“Mr. Potter, a word with you in my office, if you please.”
Ron leaned in to catch their hushed exchange.
“But Ron, you
Draco turned away, hunching back in on himself.
“If I started with the explaining I wouldn’t know where to stop, so I’ll just send it like this,” Harry replied, a little hassled at this point. His hands kept slipping off the tiny string he’d been trying to use in order to fasten the letter to Pig’s excitedly quivering little leg. As soon as he managed to tighten the knot sufficiently, Pig took off in a flurry of feathers and swept off the balcony.
Draco's point of view. Christmas Special!
He opened his eyes and found Ron looking at him oddly.
Hermione jumped up and bundled over.
, Harry wanted to say, but it wasn’t the truth anymore. Whatever he thought about Draco, it wasn’t fuelled by the same relentless, blind loathing it had been before. But how to put into words what he couldn’t even understand himself? What they had done at the manor had seemed so natural, back then.
His mirth ebbed into quiet chuckles. Fleur clapped him over the head quite sharply. “Eet was really a very ‘onourable zing to do. You should not laugh at Draco so.” Then she turned to Draco and clasped her hands in front of her. “Eet is such a romantic story. I am glad you escaped those mean men and now you can be togezzer for ever!” She sighed happily.
“No, wait, just a minute,” Harry said.
Ron was standing at the counter next to his mother, grumbling and peeling potatoes.
Draco’s mouth twisted. “Yes, I suppose we should contact the old coot.”
Harry’s brain switched into survival mode and he stayed absolutely quiet, just shaking his head when Professor McGonagall asked him if he needed clarification on something. The sooner they got this conversation over with, the better.
Even though she was noticeably smaller than Harry, he was beginning to fear he would be shipped back to the Burrow in a lunch bag. His only consolation was that she had yet to draw her wand.
“I had a feeling," Mr. Al-Keydari said. Harry's eyes snapped back up to the man's face. "Your friends were quite adamant about staying at the Arrival Chamber, but I told them I would look for you periodically, so we were able to persuade them to take a seat in the lounge.”
They bickered the whole way through putting up the spare bed in Ron’s room. Harry knew he could ask Mrs. Weasley to put him up in Bill’s or Percy’s old room, but he preferred to be with Ron anyway. Sleeping in the eery quiet of an empty room set his senses on high alert in the same way that hearing Ron snore and shuffle about sent him right into an easy sleep.
“I guess,” he said.
“You are incorrigible,” Harry said, but heaved him up anyway.
She nodded at him again, then turned around abruptly and strode off. Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, puzzled.
shield that blasted-”
“I… beg your pardon?”
“Oh, no, dear, that’s perfectly alright. You go and have a nice long walk with Bill.”
Harry opened his mouth but he didn’t even know where to start. He closed it again, helplessly.
“How can you sit here like it’s your own house?” He accused. “How can you talk to them like they are your friends, when, a few weeks ago, you would gladly have handed all of us over to Voldemort!”
Immediately, the man got up and approached them, hand outstretched. His hair was blond and tied neatly at the nape in a style that reminded Harry uncomfortably of Lucius Malfoy. His eyes were a muddy blue and Harry would bet his last pair of trainers the man had been born scowling.
“You ‘ave slept well, no? Before someone stormed een and woke you, yes?” she asked and smiled at them. Hermione bristled and bit her lip. She glared at her cup of tea as if it had called for house elves to be thrown back into slavery where they belonged.
Wait, what? What did she mean, going back to the dormitories wasn’t feasible?
“Wicked,” Ron breathed and whistled a low note as he slowly turned full circle, taking it all in once more.
“You must be Harry Potter,” she said and glided over. The ‘r’ in his name rolled of her tongue like silk, but her accent still sounded a bit funny; a slight hint of an ‘ah’ sound behind every word. Definitely Italian. He felt like he should have known that.
“Thank you. I would be glad for your help,” Draco said, “in whatever way you can give it.”
“Are you asking me if I can imagine being with you for the rest of my life? I think that train has rather left the station, wouldn’t you say?”
Please enjoy.
He took a more careful swallow of tea and leaned back in his armchair. What were they even doing? He could never talk to Draco sincerely. Somehow, one of them always ended up offended over something the other person said. Maybe it was their shared history of mutual resentment. Harry just couldn’t take anything Draco said without a grain of salt. But he’d promised himself to try, so try he would.
“…Ah, Jafari, wasn’t it? Yes, you are right, as you so often are," the mild one said in a teasing tone. Harry could hear the man’s smile through his words. He sounded fondly exasperated.
there to
He turned around and fixed his eyes on Harry.
“Yeah, I am not so sure what Draco meant by sanctuary, but the, ah… the Death Eaters were making a bit of a nuisance out of themselves back at Malfoy Manor, so we thought it best to, ah… vacate the premises.” He would have expected Draco to take up that line of reasoning, but he was still holding that weird pose, waiting for something.
What Harry had not expected to see the next day, when he came down to hunt the delicious smell creeping up the stairs and through the crack of his door, was Draco Malfoy holding a lively conversation with Fleur Delacour – no, Weasley – in the midst of the homely chaos that was the Weasley kitchen. They were truly a picture to behold. He was sitting at the head of the table, cup of tea lifted daintily and top three buttons undone. He was eerily handsome with his friendly look and open mien. Fleur was standing to his left. Her apron was stained with flour and she was enthusiastically waving about a pair of serving tongs. French flowed freely from her lips and she was absolutely radiant. Her hair was carefully braided down the back and her smile so lovely, Harry took a step towards her involuntarily. He bumped into Bill’s shoulder, who was leaning against the staircase, watching the scene with an amused glint in his eyes.
“Now, give me your hand,” he demanded imperiously, holding out his arm.
Hey my lovelies, here's the next chapter! As always, give me a few days to correct any typos et cetera. If you find anything, please let me know :)
At long last, he went still as the heaving stopped and his breathing evened out. Draco was humming something under his breath, rocking him softly.
Sobs so broken wracked his chest that no sound came from his throat. He felt a force around his neck as if it were being pressed tight from the outside.
“Have a seat, please.”
Mr. Reichel stopped talking. He looked at Mr. Al-Keydari, who had put a conciliatory hand on the other man’s elbow, and sighed deeply. Mr. Reichel closed his eyes for a second and when he opened them, a hint of softness had crept into his features.
Anyway, please enjoy :)
Draco’s mouth thinned. He looked at his cup of tea silently. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley went awfully quiet. Then Mr. Weasley got up.
” Draco asked.
Harry's insides moved and his chest expanded like the snake he had always believed Draco to be had slithered its way past his heart and was now making itself a home curled right around it. Instead of answering, he lifted his hands towards Draco's face, closed his eyes and captured Draco's mouth in a passionate kiss. A little noise of surprise spilled past Draco's lips into his mouth and with a smile, Harry attacked Draco's tongue with his teeth. Draco gave back as good as he got. They hadn't kissed like this since the akward train scene, when he had been nearly overwhelmed by the onslaught of sensations. This time he knew what to expect and kept the connecting door inside him firmly closed. He reveled in every touch, every sound he elicited from Draco, every slide of tongue against tongue. When they managed to separate at last, Harry was breathing hard again and Draco looked… he looked absolutely irresistible. There was a particular smug pride in his eyes that suited his face very well. His chin was raised in a manner Harry would have found infuriating only a week past, but now it worked to draw Harry’s attention more favourably towards his mouth and exposed neck.
Then he took Harry’s hand in his, clasping the pearls in the other.
to just swan into the Parkinson estate in the middle of the night, and I’ve known Pansy since I was two months old,” he added drily.
“Uh… so it might be true, but you don’t know?” Ron asked.
“I don’t think breaking the Bond is possible,” he said hotly. “At least not without a lot of collateral damage… We don’t know how deep the bond is. There might be parts connected that I can’t even see or feel. I’d rather not risk it. It’s not like I wouldn’t want the bond gone, of course, but I’ve… kind of… gotten used to having him around… a bit?”
“That’s the shed!” He announced. “This is where I was trying to go,” he added sheepishly.
“Very well, thanks.” Ron mouthed around his bite. “These are really good!”
“I heard about the Bonding from Mr. Weasley just now. About what Mrs. Malfoy did and about the healing and the Death Eaters.” At this her eyes teared up again. “Oh Harry, I am so sorry about everything.”
Purple seemed to be a recurring colour. Even the floor was carpeted in a rich mauve with moons and stars moving about it lazily. But… where were they?
Harry should have known better than to hope to derail her so quickly.
With that he marched off into the garden.
Harry was briefly taken aback by his straightforwardness. He hadn’t even thought about the next step.
“And on top of that, think of the shagging we could do every night.”
“Still, I am quite impressed by how you managed to get through the last few days without being murdered by either Ron or Ginny. Even though it was a close call,” he chuckled.
“Yes, I’m fine, Harry.” He said earnestly. Then he lowered his head onto Harry’s arm atop the table and closed his eyes. “That was awful,” he added quietly.
“I am not setting foot in another muggle house if my life depends on it,” Draco said. Perking up, he added: “What about Nocturne Alley? I know an inn, there.”
Fleur floated around the corner. She was wearing a flowery, frilly apron and looked altogether lovely.
“I don’t think I can quite follow…”
“Of course we have time. Nothing to do now that we can stop working on the case,” he said and winked at Harry,
Harry’s heart clenched. Draco couldn’t go back home. And he couldn’t go back to the way he was at Hogwarts, either.
“Mr. Potter.” She nodded at him brusquely. “Good to see you well.”
“Tell me,” he demanded, pebble eyes hard and chin tilted up.
He stopped next to her and put a tentative hand on her arm. His expression had changed from night to day in a second.
“Hey! Don’t talk about him like that!” Harry barked, indignant.
Harry sighed. Ron wouldn’t understand.
“Oof!” Harry said, still smiling. “If I didn’t know you were planning to keep me as life insurance, I would be sure you were trying to kill me.”
“Yeah…”
“Good morning, darling. Fleur set the table for us both.”
Harry could just make out his blush in the light of the Lumos. He wanted to touch him again, to feel the warmth of his skin underneath his fingertips, but he was sure Draco wouldn’t let him. And really, Draco was an arse, a pure-blood supremacist bigot. Harry just needed to remember that. He didn’t
“Ah, she’ll be fine,” Ron said, waving a hand. “She’s had worse on the pitch. Don’t worry about it, Harry.” He looked about for a chair to sit down in but found them all still in various states of disrepair. “But why did you defend the git in the firs… oh, right. You’d have gotten that Bat Boogey Hex too.” He clapped Harry on the shoulder. “Knew you were scared of her. But
“Oh… right! Ron said something in a letter! I’m so sorry, I… with everything that’s been going on, I… Well. Congratulations!” He made as if to hug Bill, but then thought better of it, in light of the lack of clothing, and just offered his hand awkwardly. Bill laughed out loud and threw an arm across Harry’s shoulders.
He kept touching his forehead because his scar was gone. It was
“Lumos,” a deep voice sounded.
for that matter, bonded to
His lull came to a sharp end and a gasp escaped him as Draco
“It was all very sudden. I’m actually here to talk to Professor Dumbledore, as I said, but he is not available. I’m sure he would have informed you immediately," he tried to reason.
He shrugged.
Harry shook his head in fond disbelief. Trust Draco to take his reputation among Voldemort sympathisers more serious than threat to life and limb.
“I needed you to grant us Sanctuary…”
“Nah, I don’t think that’s it. Why would they ward me out?” He said critically.
Harry, Ron and Hermione meet an interesting duo.
“Mate, I hate to say this, but you don’t really think you can just… bugger someone and it doesn’t change anything? And I’m not even talking about the foolishness of wanting to bugger Malfoy in the first place.”
As it happened, no-one had told him that he would be sitting at his kitchen table at 9 o’clock on a Sunday morning calmly drinking tea with Lucious Malfoy’s spawn, so unfortunately no cornering had taken place and he felt woefully unprepared to deal with this situation.
He got up, glancing over at Draco again but his face was carefully blank and held no indication of anything amiss.
Draco looked into his eyes. Then he got up gradually and came towards him, one step at a time. When Harry didn’t do anything, Draco took his wrists and moved his hands down. Softly, he cupped Harry’s chin and pulled his face up. Checking his reaction, he slowly bent down towards him. Harry couldn’t move at all. There was no energy in him to resist this intense gentleness.
“Harry? So, what is it?” Hermione asked again impatiently.
Draco’s throat bobbed as he swallowed. He glanced at Bill.
“No, I’m alright. I just felt different afterwards and I wanted to see if it’s still like that. Better, I mean. I feel better.”
“Anything,” Draco said quietly. “Anything you want to know. I will answer you, without hesitation or ambiguity.”
When their plates were empty and Mrs. Weasley began clearing the table, Mr. Weasley scraped back his chair and looked at his wife with serious eyes, clearing his throat.
“Oh, I am a jack-of-all-trades. I dabble a bit at potions, but I am more interested in chemistry. The two intertwine more often than not. However, I also have a license for alimentary osteopathy and I read everything about the biochemical cycle and the nervous system I can get my hands on,” he replied.
In this story, young witches and wizards get taught apparition in 7th year and are considered legal adults at 18 years old.
“You know,  I… uh.” But what could he say, really? Ron hadn’t been there over the summer. Ron couldn’t know Draco the same way Harry did, thank God for small mercies. “I’m pretty much knackered. Let’s just… call it a day.”
They sat next to each other in a double seat facing the direction of travel. It would have looked odd for two blokes to be seen sitting pressed together at one of the tables. Draco didn’t even complain about the lack of space, as Harry would have expected him to. He looked like he was in a kind of trance. He didn’t say anything, just held onto Harry’s arm so strongly it nearly hurt. Harry didn’t mind; he wouldn’t know what to talk about, anyway. It should have been awkward.
“Don’t blow the place up again, Harry,” Fred laughed as he was swallowed by the green fire.
He groaned again and scrubbed his face hard, as if he could rub away the memories that way, too.
“Thank you, sir,” Draco responded.
“I could have barbequed you on the spot, you know," Bill added with a bit too much cheer. "I felt someone unfamiliar pass the wards. I thought I would recognise everyone’s signature, but I guess not.”
This was it. This was what had been bothering him. He realised it the moment the words left his lips.
When he found the floo room at last, he fell into one of the sofas and threw an arm over his head, hiding his face in the crook of his elbow.
“After you, poppet” he said with a mock bow.
“Alright, mate. She’ll get here when she gets here. No use worrying about it.”
“I think it’s just not as important as it used to be,” he added. “Playing, I mean. There is so much going on… Dad has two days of vacation left, but then he’ll have to go back to the ministry and he’ll be working overtime and… you should have seen him last month, the circles underneath his eyes. Even when he did get home in time for dinner, he would just sit there and stare, sometimes. He wasn’t sleeping well either, I could tell. He won’t tell me what’s going on but You-Know-Who has half the ministry undermined and they’re planning something big, I just know it! And mum gets really weird when he is gone too long, she cooks way too much food and looks out the window every few minutes. Hermione spent a lot of time here and when we weren’t doing homework, we were thinking about what you told us about the hocruxes. With you gone for a whole month, we didn’t get any news, because Dumbledore won’t talk to us and mum forbade us to join them on the order meetings, even though we were there last year! How the buggering boggarts are we supposed to help when no-one tells us anything! And then your letters got less and less and we knew there was something you weren’t telling us, but how could we have guessed you decided to start shagging Malfoy instead of trying to get rid of him! And then you just swanned in here with a baby death eater in tow without any thoughts as to what they could be planning! He ridiculed us for years! He called Hermione a…” Ron stopped and growled low in his throat.
“Grab it!” he growled and only when Harry had curled is fingers into Draco’s soft hair did Draco let him go to clutch at his shorts again, opening his lips. This time Harry couldn’t close his eyes. He was mesmerised by Draco’s lips being stretched around him; mouth filled. The way his throat worked as it adjusted to this unfamiliar intrusion. The way he was starting to sweat slightly at the temples. The way his eyelashes fluttered.
Harry only moaned again. There was no way in heaven and on earth he was ever going to give this up again, ever. How could it feel so
“Why didn’t you remind me of that five minutes ago?” He plonked himself down next to Ron using his momentum to give him a good shove. Ron grinned and shoved back.
“We have to tell Dumbledore, right now,” Hermione said fiercely and got up. “This can’t wait.”
Ron squared his shoulders.
“Obviously you don’t, that was a rhetorical question!” Draco hissed. “You couldn’t afford a handkerchief made of this material, let alone a whole set of robes.”
“I’m really sorry. I’ll sneak you dinner later,” Harry mouthed towards Ron when he glowered at Draco on his way past.
“Oh, ‘Arry! Eet is so nice to see you again!” She trilled and rounded the table.
“What?” Ron said, eyes wide. He turned and stared at Harry. “Are you sure?”
“What?” Ron asked. “We didn’t.”
It wasn’t his fault for getting used to the git’s barbed comments and thinly veiled innuendos. It wasn’t his fault either that they’d had to leave without him this morning. And it definitely wasn’t his fault that being here on his own felt like wearing a bath robe to a fancy pure-blood reception he hadn’t been invited to in the first place. Too exposed. Too… naked.
“Wow,” he breathed.
Harry sighed. She would ask more questions later.
Harry stopped short.
“Well then – what did you want to talk about?” He asked flatly.
The thought made Harry inexplicably sad.
“I hurt her,” Harry moaned, anguished. “I hurt Ginny, Ron!”
Then Malfoy slowly turned around and looked at him full on. There was a small cut on his cheekbone. Probably from one of the twigs when they’d raced through the trees. Harry stared at it. The surge of protectiveness he felt surprised him. He gradually lifted his arm, so as not to startle Draco, and touched his cheek with his right index finger. He didn’t have to concentrate at all for the mark to gradually fade away. Then it was gone. Harry moved his finger along the delicate bone towards Draco’s ear. His skin was soft and warm. The tip of his ear was faintly pink. He cupped his face. His eyes fell to his lips. They were thin and red. Malfoy moved towards him by increments. His breath warmed Harry’s skin along his neck. He didn’t dare move at all. He closed his eyes.
“In the worst…” he waggled his eyebrows.
A tidal wave of protectiveness surged up inside him, so fierce, he felt his entire perspective shift. He was responsible for Draco, especially considering he had willingly and probably under considerable strain tried to integrate himself into Harry’s surrogate family. This new understanding made Harry’s determination rise in strength. He would… he would… what exactly could he do? He could start by being more trusting, he supposed. And maybe back him in case of conflict. The others all had each other, but Draco had no-one else to stand up for him, and conflict was inevitable in the present constellation.
“Sorry, I… it’s just…”
“You make it sound like he hated all Slytherins or something.”
At that moment the door opened and Draco stepped inside, a tray with tea and biscuits trailing after him. With a small wave the tray set itself down on the desk and a glance from Draco was all it took to make the pot pour for them. He half expected Draco to smirk at him, but there was only a little fond smile playing around his lips when he noticed Harry watching.
Draco cocked his head.
“Well,” he started and paused.
And that weird blood ritual he had done. Why had he done that? Was it really to make amends? It couldn’t be. He would have been able to do it the whole time if he really felt that bad about what his family had done to the Weasleys. Mrs. Weasley had said they could ask for all his possessions, so it must be something very serious and very binding. But that was the nature of spells involving blood, wasn’t it? That’s the reason most of Blood Magic was considered Dark Magic. No wonder Malfoy knew how to do that kind of thing.
“And we will be using muggle transportation?” Draco guessed, making a face.
“Yes, boarding school, zank you. He could have developed his skills a lot more focused. Also, how exactly is he supposed to fight Voldemort? He is only a teenager. All of zis is absolutely irresponsible. It is a zing for ze adults, not for ze children.”
“So… you think that’s possible?”
Harry’s scowl deepened. That didn’t feel right somehow, even though it made some sense, logically.
“As we understand the situation, Ronniekins-,“ Fred stepped in,
Harry is bewildered. Draco makes amends.
Draco took a look around, then rolled over the muggle desk chair with a grimace and gingerly sat down, gesturing towards the armchair.
She clapped her hands sharply and ordered tea for herself from a doe eyed little house-elf with furry ears.
“Hart, let the man take a seat and have a cup of tea before you start interrogating him, yes?” Mr. Al-Keydari said with a twitch of lips and guided a protesting Mr. Reichel back to the couch.
The water went on in the other room and Harry felt at home for the first time in weeks. He could nearly forget Draco was there in the house, writing mysterious letters and being unnaturally unobtrusive. Now that he thought about it, Draco was not at all behaving like Harry had expected. He’d been a bit rude to Ron, but there had been no taunting, no insults. Well, it would be quite the thing to insult someone in their own home, even for Draco.
Harry sneaked a glance at Ron, but he’d lain down on the pink sofa and placed the biscuits on his lap, happily munching away with a dreamy expression on his face. Harry closed his eyes and
“What are you reading?” he asked when Draco didn’t say anything.
“Oi!” Ron said.
“Why didn’t you just use a sticking charm?” Ron asked without looking up from his magazine.
Harry ignored him and kept walking. After a minute he stumbled onto dry ground and when he parted the next patch of grass, he could see the outlines of a small building.
“This ought to do,” he said. Then he cocked his head. “Alright there, Potter?”
“Ah, well. I. I only ever went to Ron’s place by floo.” And by flying car, Harry thought, but didn’t say.
“Get hexed behind my back?”
“So, we are bonded, right? And we can’t take that back, I guess,” he continued after a few minutes.
Draco’s voice was barely audible. There was something heavy in it, and vulnerable. It made Harry look up. Draco sat in the ridiculous chair that made him seem very much out of place. Draco belonged in fancy leather armchairs or red velvet seats. He should not be here. This was wrong. He did not belong in this house.
“Well,” Harry said slowly, “he told me so.”
When they had eaten and Ron had at last torn himself away from Fleur’s radiance (Hermione shoving him towards the fire place had probably helped), they made their way through the floo. Harry dragged his feet as he took a fistfull of floo powder. He stood there for nearly a full minute, before he clucked his tongue at himself for dawdling. Draco would not appear out of thin air right this very instant, just because he wanted him to.
“Let’s get the place in order before mum gets back and then you two can sit down and discuss everything,” Bill suggested, before Ron could stomp after Draco.
,” they finished.
“Uhhh. Well, that is… uh. He is…”
Heat still stained his cheeks and flared in his belly as the pictures danced before his eyes.
“He vants to find out vhere in our bodies ze magic comes from,” Mr. Reichel added.
“What do you mean,
“We could always go to Ron’s,” he mused.
“So you live togezer?” Mr. Reichel asked pointedly.
“That’s quite amazing!” Hermione said, sounding impressed despite herself. “What about you, Mr. Al-Keydari?”
“They're all at Aunt Adalberta’s for the weekend. She says she is dying and wants to see them before she goes. She’s been saying that for the last twenty-two years.” He smiled widely. “Fleur and I just got back from our honeymoon yesterday.”
“Why, zank you!” Fleur beamed. “They are Bill’s favoureete. Molly’s rezeepe.”
“Should we just go in?” Harry asked.
“In fact,” Harry interrupted Ron and stood, “I think I’m going to go back to the Burrow. We can leave a note for Dumbledore. He can contact us when he’s back.”
“Yes, please,” Harry groaned and fell into one of the comfortably padded chairs, lowering his head down onto his arms.
“A different potion? Where did you get it from? Who brewed it? I wasn’t informed about any other team working on this case!” she asked in dangerously low tones.
“What?” Harry asked flatly.
“Yeah. Like… 20 of them.”
He sunk down into the brown armchair next to Draco’s and put his feet on the table.
Trying to get his bearing, he breathed deeply a few times, brushed a hand through his hair and chugged down a glass of cold water. When he felt more put together, he went up the stairs.
“-but this is the best entertainment you provided us with since fighting that dragon for its golden egg!” Fred exclaimed earnestly.
Harry could just make out a dark coat moving past the edge of his vision. Draco flew away from him and turned around to look out the window again. Harry twisted to watch the woman close the door of the apartment.
His eyes snapped open. The expression on his freind's faces reflected sympathy and concern.
Never mind that now! Why was Draco so… so… cosy with Bill all of a sudden?
“Well? Which way do we go?” he asked a little impatiently.
Then Draco put one hand down between his own legs, rubbing in quick motions. The sight almost undid him.
I just wanted to tell you that I am thinking of you and I've got a little something for you.
"The headmaster's office!"
“Quidditch,” was all he said and swallowed. “Forgot how hungry it makes you.”
, this he knew. This he could understand.
Ron’s eyebrows lifted.
Bill studied them with narrowed eyes, but eventually huffed a sigh and stepped forward. Lifting his wand again, he hesitatingly placed it atop Draco’s, barely touching, and said flatly: “The Weasley family welcomes Draco Ignatius Abraxas Malfoy of the line of Armand Malfoy and his Bonded.”
“I brought you some dinner,” Harry tried and sat down next to him.
Draco got up and went over to the window, studying the countryside, maybe. The sunlight spilling over his form made his hair nearly translucent at the ends. The side of his neck was smooth and it made Harry’s fingers itch.
“Bye!” Ron waved enthusiastically until they’d vanished.
“The blood magic. That might have just been to get us to trust him. He must know that my parents are too noble to really take anything from him or do anything to him.”
He poured his tea and added a splash of milk.
Bill laughed again and sat back down. Draco was trying to fix his hair, glaring at him. After a minute, Bill thought he could make out a tiny smile lifting the side of Draco’s mouth.
“Oh, that would be amazing! Thank you so much!” she said and actually clapped her hands.
“Potter!” Draco hissed. “Where are we?”
“Mr. Potter!” the Professor’s voice called sternly from the hall.
“What do you mean, you didn’t? He obviously knew, otherwise he would have asked where Draco was, don’t you think? Also, he said he wouldn’t have to work on the case anymore. Why would he have said that?”
“Don’t bother with the plate, you can bring it back down tomorrow morning. Sleep well!” She fairly shoved Harry towards the stairs, handing him fork and knife with an afterthought.
“Wait just a second, would you. I’ll be right back. Don’t go in without me! I think I just saw a particularly lovely bloom over there,” Draco muttered.
“No! I don’t want to hear it! It’s just plain gross!” Ron said, holding up a hand.
Draco sat next to him staring out the window. Harry had the bizarre impulse to take his hand, to see how it felt, but the way Draco had reacted earlier gave him pause.
