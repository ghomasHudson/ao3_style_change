Letting go of the hair that he very much had been pulling at, his head whips to Hermione, who has a finger pointing to the plate in front of Harry. He looks at it, and sure enough, the bread is blackened. Hermione raises an eyebrow because she knows that Harry's able to do wandless magic when he's feeling very strongly about something and right now he's feeling very strongly that he wants to slap Draco Malfoy.
. Because then McGonagall knew, and with sad eyes, she dismissed Draco and asked him to send in Ronald Weasley.
Harry, who had lay in his hospital bed, giving Fred and George his Triwizard winnings and assured Ron and Hermione many times that he was alright and recounted the story to Dumbledore, but could only think about Draco and was relieved out of his mind when the boy arrived, holding him tightly.
Ignoring Draco's protests, Harry grinned and walked closer until he had tackled a struggling Draco into his arms, holding the boy close in a hug. Draco sighed and gave in, wrapping his arms around Harry and hugging him back. "You're my number one, you needy prat. You got that?" Harry muttered into Draco's shoulder.
Harry wouldn't let Draco off that easily. He reach out and grabbed the pale boy's hand. Draco panicked, looking around, but Harry just kept his eyes on Draco's. "Look at me and tell me you don't feel anything."
Granger sighed, knowing she wouldn't get him to move. So, she squeezed his shoulder supportively, then left the hospital wing to head for her dorm. Draco watched Harry's chest go up and down, the only sign that he was still alive.
Harry definitely did not meet Draco's eyes now. He bit his lip and looked out of the window. They clouds were grey and stormy, as though reflecting the moods that everyone felt in the courtroom today.
A pang of what suspiciously felt like jealousy ran through Draco as he scowled at the red-haired boys.
"How'd you do it?" Ron asked, finally saying something. Harry's head snapped over to him. "Oh, nevermind. It doesn't matter." Ron bitterly made his way over to his own bed. Harry turned to look at him. "You might've let your best friend know, though."
But there wasn't any time to argue before Harry grabbed Draco's hand and turned, apparating them to Harry's Westminster flat. Harry walked right in, which is what Draco should have done, which is what Draco
Stopping beside the trunk, Malfoy jumped down and smirked, walking over to Harry. "He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five."
Harry flung his arms. "Because I've got no one else to tell! Because nobody will talk to me and although you only insult be at least you're saying
Draco, who caught Harry alone outside during the Yule Ball and commented on his awful dancing. Draco, who then, with a smug smile, taught Harry how to properly dance out there in the courtyard on that beautiful December night.
So, here Harry is, sitting at the window, glaring at the stormy sky with Draco sitting across from him, glaring at Harry. Harry finally turns. "What's your issue?'
He'd devoted everything to this boy. And, sure, he got to laugh with him and high five him and be with him, but he couldn't be with him how he'd like to.
Then he turned sixteen and came to the worst realization of his entire life. He loved Harry Potter. And his morning pumpkin juice wasn't spiked with Weasley's Wizard Wheezes
"Malfoy, come with me," Harry said, taking the taller boy and his gang of Slytherins by surprise. Harry turned and began walking towards the castle. He looked back over his shoulder to find the boy standing shock-still. "Coming?" Harry called, turning back around. From the sound of footsteps, he knew Malfoy was following.
More tears were spilling down Draco's face. "Harry, I love you too, but we can't be together. It's for your safety and for mine. And things will start to be easier when you just accept that." He whispered.
And then he's walking. The parchment is folded and crumpled in Harry's hand and his shoes are echoing on the stone and his heart is hammering and his hands are shaking because what-
When Harry woke up every day after that, he kept hoping it was all some horrid nightmare. It wasn't. Every day for the next two weeks, until he faced reality, he had to deal with Ron ignoring him, dirty looks and insults from
"Why?" Draco snapped, pulling his arm from Harry's grip. "Why are you with me? Is it pity? Hm? Or do you just feel obligated to be with me because you feel bad or something-" Draco's angry rant was cut off quickly when Harry pressed his lips to Draco's.
The entirety of the Great Hall turned in their seats, all eyes scanning the room, trying to find the lanky, messy-haired, green-eyed fourteen year old that was sinking lower and lower in his chair as the seconds passed. Of course. Of course his name had somehow gotten into that bloody cup and of course he couldn't have the peaceful year he was hoping for. In all honesty, Harry and Ron had planned to make bets and watch the Tournament with excitement. Guess that wasn't happening now.
Risking everything, Harry takes a step closer to Draco. "Don't wipe away your tears," Harry shakes his head. "I know we're not together and I know I can't do anything about the reason you're crying, but... just let me be there for you."
Draco, who joined the Inquisitorial Squad because his father forced him to, but during dark, moon-lit hours, stayed up in empty classrooms with Harry, learning how to properly cast
Ron rolled his eyes and walked away, Seamus still at his side. Harry, still bubbling with anger and wanting to get this done and over with, arched up to Cedric and asked to talk to him privately. They stood a few feet away from Cedric's fan club, and the older Hufflepuff frowned at Harry. "Look, Harry, about the badges- I've asked them to stop wearing them-"
And when Draco finished, Harry was livid. He was angrier than he had been when Draco had accidentally set his Auror case file on fire. That was a long story.
At once, Draco slammed his hands on the table and stood up, exclaiming, "Of course I mind!" All the other students in the Slytherin common room looked at the pair, which Harry noticed. He grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him to their dorm, closing the door behind them.
Closing the doors, Draco muttered a few more words and pulled his wand away. A few seconds passed before Draco opened the doors once more, bent down, and took the bird out.
"Come on," Harry held out his hand to Ethan, who was peering over the edge of the cliff, a terrified expression on his face. There was also sadness there, and Harry knew it was the effect of the Dementors. Harry leaned to him and grabbed his hand, making Ethan look into his green eyes. "Let's just get in and get out, yeah?"
Ron could hold grudges and stick to them for a long time, but when word got around that Harry Potter was hanging out and spending a lot of time with Draco Malfoy, even
A second later he was lunging at Harry, knocking him to the ground, and landing on top of him. The tent was still as Draco hovered over Harry in a push-up position, both boys suddenly aware of how quick their hearts were hammering. They both were silent, breathless, and blushing. That is, until Harry giggled.
The hospital wing doors burst open, much to the annoyance of Madam Pomfrey. Harry sat up quickly, wincing from the cut near his ribs, but not caring. He had done it. He'd successfully summoned his broom, gotten the egg from the dragon, and made it out alive and in one piece. He insisted on finding Draco, but Pomfrey had rushed him up here instead.
But he didn't. Draco pressed his lips in a kiss to Harry's forehead and pulled away, a small smile on his face.
wasn't. He knew from the second the Savior of the wizarding world gave the bad guy in the tale a chance that he loved the green-eyed boy who lived. Love was the way Harry held Draco's hands while he taught him how to cook. Love was the way Draco patiently explained the proper history of ancient wizarding families and the way Harry would frown when stuck, and grin and kiss Draco's cheek when he understood.
Draco caught on when the Triwizard Cup appeared in front of the maze, Potter clinging to it with one hand and to Diggory in the other. Draco scowled when he saw Potter's head on Diggory's chest, but that angered look soon faded to one of horror when he realized that Diggory wasn't blinking or breathing and tears were pouring down Potter's face.
"I was not that desperate." Harry insisted, while Draco pecked him on his forehead with a smug look.
Harry turned around, ready to leave. He waited for a moment, he heard nothing, and let the flicker of hope burn out.
. That's none of your business, is it?" Draco's voice was nasty. But he was right. It was none of Harry's business.
ing muggles right as they went and Harry himself running to catch the Death Eaters. Harry just remembered glimpses of running and cursing and running, and right when he'd thought he'd got them, they apparated.
"And while you were at it you decided to snoop on my stuff?" Draco's voice was now low, dangerously low, and he was hissing at Harry like a basilisk that was about to have him as his meal. Draco pushed the drawer shut, and Harry had to draw his fingers out of the way at the quick movement. "
"My magic?" Harry smirked as he took Draco's hand in his own. Everything was finally going to be alright.
Harry is again knocking on Draco's door, but this time he's not asking for Draco to heal his wounds. Well, wounds yes, but not bleeding ones.
He inhaled Draco's scent and swallowed his taste and did everything he had wanted to done again for the past four months. Draco's hand was pulling at his hair and his tongue was slipping in his mouth and Harry felt like he could jump at Draco, have his legs around Draco's torso and see what Draco would do. Harry's hands roamed to Draco's neck to the hem of his shirt to the curve of his back. Draco's lips were then on Harry's neck and he had a breather before Draco attacked his mouth again.
Draco shrugged Harry's robes off, then his undershirt, and then pointedly did not look at Harry as he applied something that smelled like vinegar on Harry's wounds. Harry gritted his teeth, sucked in his spit.
Draco was so close to him, but the moment was broken as the bottle containing the cream dropped on Harry's wound, making him wail.
He rather felt Draco's laugh than heard it. "It's mother's. She gave it to me one day and said to use it when I decide to propose to some wealthy woman. I got so pissed that I didn't want to see the whole thing, brought it to work and shoved it in my drawer." Harry turned to look at Draco. His hair was laying all over the pillow, and a blush was on his cheeks. "I honestly forgot it was there."
Harry finished his curry, and then in the next minute found himself just outside of Draco's office. The door was slightly ajar, and Harry's nerves picked on. He braced himself before knocking on the door and going in.
Harry was laying on the bed with Draco, body slick with sweat and other things. Their legs were intertwined, and Harry's head was on Draco's chest so that he could still feel the rapid rise of his chest. Harry played with Draco's fingers while Draco's other hand caressed his hair, smoothing it backwards.
Harry hummed as he decided to look around. No harm in that, right? Draco's office looked more like a blank canvas, than someone's personal space. There weren't any photos of his loved ones like Ron had, nor did he have any half-dead succulents in a stuffy corner. The only thing that was implying that someone actually worked in there was the neatly laid coat on Draco's chair, and the scarf wrapped on the doorknob. Despite of his better knowledge, Harry took the scarf in his hands, looked around to make sure that no-one was coming, and brought it under his nose.
A flash of uncertainty passed on Draco's face, but it was so quick that Harry couldn't tell if it really had been there. His body remained stiff, eyes full of anger. Draco opened the drawer, and took out the dark blue box. Then, to Harry's worst nightmare, he opened it and showed a beautiful ring. A huge emerald in the middle of a rose gold ring, full of tiny dots and details.
Harry threw himself on Draco, not knowing whether to punch him or kiss him. Maybe the latter, though.
The pang about the engagement ring was still pounding in the back of Harry's head, but he decided that it could wait for later. He knew that Draco wasn't getting engaged, except maybe to Harry in the future. Everything else could wait. It was now just Harry and Draco and their lips and limbs. Draco was warm, like home, and the way he was smiling at Harry made his heart do a couple cartwheels. He looked thoroughly kissed, and then he was pulling his coat and scarf on. "You know, I've always found your magic hot."
Harry set the envelope on Draco's desk, and then contemplated whether he should stay and wait for Draco or to simply leave. Draco's office was far from Harry's; it was clean, papers where in right files and there were no coffee mug stains on the desk. Well, Draco had always been a bit obsessed about keeping his drinks on a coaster.
"What are you doing here?!" Draco beelined to him, and stopped when he saw that the bottom drawer was open.
"What? You'd think that I was getting engaged and then proceeded to fuck you when you found out? I have a bit more class than that, you must know Harry." Draco's lips pursed with unpleasantness.
Harry couldn't do anything. He just stared at Draco and complied at Draco's whisper to lift his hips. Draco pulled Harry's trousers and pants lower, and then he was looking at Harry's freckled hip. One that Draco had just months before thrust against, left his fingerprints there. Only if removing Draco's fingerprints from Harry's heart had been as easy as removing them from his thighs.
Harry could see Draco's Adam's apple bobbing as he applied the same cream as earlier. "You're splinched."
Draco grunted then, turning around and going somewhere ㅡ at that point Harry didn't really care ㅡ and Harry took that as an invitation to come in. He slumped against the door right as it closed, and cursed when a mind-numbing pain bolted in his head.
"Draco-" Harry's voice came out a bit more choked up than he'd've liked. He cleared his throat. "It's time for your trial."
“Now that’s a sight to come home to,” the wicked voice said from the doorway, “delicious smells and that fabulous arse in tight trousers on display for me. I know what’s for dessert, what’s for dinner?”
Harry teased Cedric that no one that handsome should be put in the thick of combat, but the truth was there were few sailors as proficient as he at subduing a ship.
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I know you must be confused and worried. I didn’t mean to run off like that.
Harry studied her for a moment, taking in the dark circles under her eyes and the tense purse of her mouth and saw past the elegance and breeding to the pure fear underneath. She was a wife and mother and terrified; Harry understood terrified. He took a deep breath and gave her a tiny half-smile. “I am honoring my life debt to you. My home is your home for as long as it's needed. Let me show you to your rooms and then we’ll have dinner and discuss the household rules.” Before leaving, Harry turned to the others. “Kingsley, if you’ll wait, I’d like to speak with you before you go.”
He turned his head towards the question but the tears streaming down his face made it impossible to see. "The book should be on my ... on the shelf." They rarely corrected the clone when he used a possessive term except when Draco was around. Still, best not to get in the habit in case he slipped when it mattered.
“You can kiss my arse, you posh git,” Harry said with a slight grin as he rolled his face into Draco’s neck and inhaled deeply. He loved Draco’s scent.
“The Minister and Head Auror Robards believe that is true,” Lucius answered, his tone very different from the haughty man that entered his home a month ago. “However,” he continued, “if you would be so kind, I would appreciate my wife and son being able to remain here until the last of the trials are over. I will leave, if you prefer it.”
‘The Marauder’ had been Harry's father's ship, once upon a time. Harry had no memory of his father and yet there were times Harry thought he could picture him, striding its decks as he fought the same fight Harry now continued in his name.
The hodge-podge of the ship seemed to fit the personality of the Weasley clan perfectly. As soon as someone explained to Harry how the leaky bucket stayed afloat he would worry about the even more unbelievable feat of ‘The Burrow’ keeping up. Not even magic could explain that.
Apparently, they think we’re still the two teenagers we used to be.  I pointed out that we’re adults
“I see, I'm not really needed here,” the nurse gestured to Harry's expert handling of the hospital bed and grinned, “are you by any chance thinking of changing professions, Auror Potter?”
“Molly’s. She popped over with bread and preserves and offered to take him for the night. She could tell that I was just not doing well. She said Ron and Hermione were over with the kids, so Scorpius would have someone to play with. I asked her to tell them that we won't be there for our playdate tomorrow.”
“Of course, Mother. It would be my pleasure,” Draco said, his voice flat and his eyes never lifting to look at Harry.
Harry, I wonder every day what it would it would be like to taste your mouth, what it would be like to be yours, for you to be mine.
Draco couldn’t quite imagine how this worked but he was very curious and nodded in response, not trusting his voice much at the moment. The friendliness between them was still new and strange.
“Why doesn’t he feel well, Daddy? I bet I could make him feel better,” the toddler offered. “He likes it when I make him laugh.”
Everything is going so well right now. I mean can you imagine the howlers? I don’t particularly fancy going back to being spit on in the street. (I mean I would, for you I would, but it’s a lot to ask of you, so I understand) I don’t want to jeopardise this if public attention is too much. I can keep a secret. I’m very, very good at that. Nobody needs to know about me.
"It's not!" Pettigrew interrupted, waving his hands, his eyes wide and wild. "I'm just not sure what they're doing. With the wind, staying on a broom is almost impossible, let alone trying to cast and dodge spells."
“We’re going to have to lift them out one at a time.” Harry said, his voice unsteady and he struggled to maintain a strong defense.  None of them had brooms and there was no energy to float.
Sorry this is a couple days late.  It's been a week.  I don't understand why I need to deal with people in order to work for a living.  That shouldn't be a thing.
They'd lost their forward momentum but it didn't seem to phase Sirius at all. The small man visible on the high deck bounced on his toes in excitement. His booming cry was as though he spoke with the voice of the ship herself. "Open the gun ports!" he bellowed. A moment later came the directive, "Fire!"
Harry relaxed a touch. He hadn’t missed that Draco actually looked at him and he counted it as a win.
The Minister shook Harry’s hand and clamped his large hand on Harry’s shoulder before moving toward the Floo. “Alright, I need to get back, the Ministry doesn’t run itself. Harry, let me know if you need anything.”
“Wow,” Draco said when he finally landed and looked around. “This is amazing. I never expected anything like this. Did you do the spellwork?”
“But that is a hero, Harry. A hero is someone who does the right thing as best they can, in spite of being scared, in spite of being unsure, in spite of being uncomfortable. You were our hero, that day you took us in to protect us.” Draco said quietly, his regret rising like a physical lump in his throat. “I know that wasn’t easy for you, especially with my father or with me, really. I was so horrible to you. I’m not sure I’ve ever properly said thank you. I have my family back, alive and much wiser, so thank you.”
Draco laughed. “Yes, really. I still have some of mine. When we get out of this mess, I’ll show you.”
Pettigrew disappeared from Harry’s sight. It was unfortunate but Harry had already resigned himself to that loss.
Her tone said ‘you’re gonna need it’, so Harry nodded and returned to his chair. He finished his toast and jam quietly, listening to her stirring and Ron’s nattering on about Quidditch. When they were all seated with fresh, hot tea, Harry looked at them both. “May as well just say it, whatever it is. It won’t get any better delaying the conversation.”
“Can you do the voices like Papa does? I love the voices. Nana Cissa says that Papa makes the bestest voices.”
Draco nodded, looking over the heads thoughtfully. He pulled his wand and tried several spells that Harry didn’t recognise. Finally, he put his wand away and Harry waited, trying to be patient.
Just then Harry sneezed and froze, the sound of footsteps drawing close before the pantry door was yanked open and an angry Draco Malfoy was staring him down.
“I’d like to keep them overnight, just to be sure. Everything went well, but Draco’s been through a lot. Let’s give him a night to rest and recover.”
Having tasted nothing in his life but simple fare, geared towards health, he relished the feast of colours and flavours.
If you wear that grey top I picked out for you, I’m sure any touch of green would do to complete the outfit for the match this weekend. I might have an old scarf laying about from our school days. I quite like the idea of you in my old school scarf. But honestly, you are such a shameless flirt. It doesn’t matter what you wear, you can always sit next to me. I thought that was well established by now.
His lieutenant understood instantly. “Got it!” Cedric dropped his shielding spell and put both hands on his axe.  His whole body went into the throw. The large two handed axe hurtled end over end across the endless space.  It hit with a sound that shook the ship, cleaving the large wooden beam in two. The halves slipped from their metal holds and fell to the ground.
“Harry!” Ron’s panicked voice called down to him. The corner of his mouth twitched up. Maybe he wasn’t alone after all, with his best friend nearby.
The man himself stood on the raised quarter deck of his flagship. He cut an impressive figure, broad chested with muscled arms and legs. The tricorn caught under one arm allowed the wind to play through his curls, concealing and revealing his famous scar, as it whipped his long black coat around his legs. Under the coat he wore a white shirt, ties open to display the firm chest beneath and loose brown trousers tucked tight into well fitted tall boots with shiny buckles.
Oy, mate! I knew you were going with the ferret and expected the Prophet to be full of shite but bloody hell. You had to get caught snogging for all of us to see?? Seriously, though, you're obviously happy and that's what matters to me, yeah? Don't think for a minute I'm going to let you out of our monthly get togethers or you coming to Sunday dinners sometimes. I'm sure you'll hear from mum but I know she considers you family too, even if that includes the ferret.
Hermione sat her teacup down and opened her arms, and Harry stood and melted into the embrace. He buried his face in her strawberry scented curls and fought the desire to just break down. He managed, just, then Ron was there, his strong arms giving Harry a different kind of anchor borne of long years and numerous challenges.
The smile Draco gave him assured Harry that this was the right decision. He didn’t need to work and it was clear there would be plenty to do at home. “To be honest, I’m looking forward to it. My next great adventure, changing nappies and spoiling my beautiful husband.”
The clone visualized several responses to the impassioned request to join the pirates. In one, he played coy. "Oh please sir, I couldn't possibly." The details of how he allowed Potter to woo him into changing his mind never failed to lift his spirits.
“That’s just it, doctor, he’s not eating more,” Harry said. “In fact, he barely keeps anything down. There’s no way he’s gaining weight from eating.”
“Yeah,” Harry said as he sat the head in the corner. “I’ll be very glad to have these down. Thank you, Draco.”
It was mid morning two weeks later when the wards alerted Harry that someone was coming through the kitchen Floo.
Harry relaxed just a touch and nodded. “It does,” he agreed. “I’ll try, with Cissy, though it might take me some time to get used to. I wasn’t taught a lot of manners, but respect for elders was, well, rather heavily enforced.”
"You think the twins will beat your spell record?" Pettigrew questioned, abruptly changing the subject.
Harry reclaimed his tea, cradling his favourite mug in both hands to keep them occupied. After taking a sip, he continued. “As for the rest, well, Winky is a Hogwarts house-elf who will be taking care of us. I don’t actually have a house-elf anymore, I just care for myself. Kreacher is far too old and has retired to Hogwarts. Headmistress McGonegall was kind enough to loan Winky to me for as long as we are in this situation. She will cook and clean, do laundry and such. To be clear,” Harry said, looking directly at Lucius now, his voice stern, “she is to be treated with respect and kindness. You will ask for what you need, not order her about. If there is a problem, bring it to me. You are not to discipline her in any way. Understood?”
Fuck, Draco, I was drinking tea when I read about Binn’s army and nearly choked.  That’s hilarious and I wouldn’t be surprised if he did have some kind of agenda. It’s not like the meetings aren’t already tough to sit through as it is - not to mention how much important stuff we could be doing with that time.  Things like
As to your students proclivities for landing themselves into trouble, I’m not sure what you expected. Children are monsters. Did you forget everything about our years at school? The threat of detention never kept us in line either. Although, I can’t imagine why you have difficulty maintaining order. Perhaps Arithmancy isn’t as fascinating a subject as Defence. I suspect it inspires much less “enthusiasm”. How could it not when taught by the great Professor Potter?
I don’t... I don’t remember much, I think I made some fairly humiliating noises. I think I wrapped my arms around you, terrified that if you left you’d take all of the oxygen in the room with you.
Where was I? Oh yes, I want to know your quirks and habits. I also want to know what you want in the future, where you’d like to visit, what sort of house you’d like to live in. Do you want pets? If you ever have children how do you want to raise them? What’s on your bucket list? I’d like to spend hours, days, months, years, learning everything about you. You fascinate me endlessly.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, reaching for another biscuit. “The real test is after we’ve been in the same house for a while. I’ve no idea how the hell I’m going to manage to survive this, really.”
The hold was in the bottom of the ship below several levels full of guns, hammocks, crates and the minutiae that made up the day to day life of the regular sailor. Most of these levels were cleared out, the occupants having scrambled to the top deck when the fighting began. The main access to the hold was through two large hatch doors that opened from the deck down to the area where cargo was kept. But the easier access, when not using the cranes, was through a series of staircases that led down and down and down.
"I'm not letting him over the side without one. It's too easy for wands to get stolen or battles to end up too close quarters for them to be effective."
The next day, the lab techs experimented on the clone's lungs. The day passed with the slowness of a decaying body. They pushed him to exercise so hard that his chest burned, and he felt blood coming up the back of his throat as he fought to breathe.
Calling you Harry is still a little odd to me, but in the interest of professional cooperation I’ll give it a try. My apologies, I’m not sure why you are so hell-bent on speaking to me. You’ve hardly shown any inclination before…I suppose I’m wondering why you care?
I however manage to retain control of my students and my grading, as well as other duties, Quidditch for one.
Robards cleared his throat. “Yes, well, because of his position, he knew about how she really died as soon as that information was divulged, and he decided revenge was the answer. He coldly planned your deaths even though he knew you did not kill her. We found notes in his satchel that outlined plans to murder any further Death Eaters we managed to find before they could be sentenced. By all appearances, he was acting alone.”
Harry's pirates were unhinged and Fred and George led the charge in that race. The twins catapulted themselves off the ship together before Ron got to them. Behind them, others, many with the trademark Weasley red hair and patched clothing, were also taking off on their brooms.
Above the hold Ron, Cedric, Luna and the others waited for Harry to once again pull off a miracle.  The seconds ticked by like minutes.  The breath was caught in their lungs.  They waited.
Crewmembers scrambled to their weapons as officers strode purposefully to their positions. Twelve pound cannon balls and bags of black powder danced along through the chaos and into the open mouths of the fifty weapons, twenty-five on each side.
At the helm Neville flipped the wooden handles, turning the wheel with almost unearthly speed, competence borne out of years of practice. 'The Phoenix' veered even further to port, exposing their right side to the oncoming squadron. As they turned, Harry got a clear look at the chaos Fred, George and the others created as they wrecked their enemies.
Draco chuckled, nuzzling Harry’s cheek before pulling back to look into his eyes. “Our last birthdays as single Wizards. Are you excited?”
“How, Harry?? How?? Wizards can’t have babies without a lot of effort and help and that’s really only in theory. We asked about it, remember?”
Sailing home, Voldemort’s ghost stood looking out into the darkness.  Harry’s body was safely stored in the hold he had fought so hard to escape.  Voldemort had felt the deep pain in his soul at the destruction of the Horcrux.  Despite this loss, it was a victory for Voldemort and his forces and his men were celebrating.  Letters had already been dispatched by the fastest owls to all corners of the Wizarding World.
“Hmm,” Harry said. “Merlin, that’s really disturbing and more than a little embarrassing,” he said, his lips held tightly as though fighting the urge to laugh. When an actual giggle pushed past his lips, Draco joined in and they laughed until they were breathless.
His time was up.  The enemy was closing in.  Eternal darkness beckoned.  Harry took a deep breath.  He did not bother to wipe the tears from his eyes.  With a warrior’s cry, he dropped his shield and charged forward.
Spells exploded on the pirates and even as prepared as they had been, several went down immediately. Harry and Cedric took up position side by side. As the strongest spell casters, their shielding spells overlapped, and their ability to catch the spells that slipped through on their bracers provided a bit of protection for the others. Cedric’s axe was also flying but the curses were too thick to block them all.
“It’s not, not really,” Draco said, “thankfully. Every trace of him is gone as well as who we were before. It reflects all the changes this family has been through and I, for one, am glad of it.”
Harry was listening, but never took his eyes off Draco. He felt the trembling increase, saw the colour drain from the pale face and knew the minute Draco was in trouble. He jumped up, pulling Draco to his feet and down the hall into the loo just in time for Draco to throw up. Closing the door behind them, Harry grabbed a wet flannel and a glass of water, then knelt by his friend, his hand spread across the middle of his back. When Draco finally stopped heaving, Harry flushed and used the flannel to gently wash Draco’s face, then handed him the glass of water.
After his friends left, with a promise to be there when the Malfoy’s arrived, Harry scrubbed his face one last time and then made his way to the Floo, his first call to Minerva McGonagall.
“Daddy, why can’t I come with you to get my sissers from the hospital?” Scorpius was tired and fussy as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck.
"Yeah, guess so," Harry said. The unease in his tone belied his words. He turned his gaze out to the horizon again.
“I’m actually okay,” Harry said as he dropped into his chair at the kitchen table. “I slept all night, only woke up a little early when I felt sick.”
“I sincerely doubt it, but we can ask.” Draco sleeved his wand and looked at his now filthy hands. “I think I’d like to get cleaned up. We can ask her at dinner.”
Peter had been a friend of his father’s, a link to his parents that Harry had treasured despite his dislike of the man himself. But it was not a pain Harry had time to dwell on. “We’re going to need to push them back to get to the door.”
They looked at each other and then Ron cleared his throat. “The thing is, mate, well, you know the Malfoys were in protective custody after their trials, waiting for Lucius to finish testifying and remaining Death Eaters to be captured.”
There’s a plate of toast and bacon, a bowl of fruit, coffee, tea and Harry’s glasses. There’s also a copy of the prophet and scattered about are a few of the owls they’ve received.
Harry took a deep breath and put his glasses back on. “This would be easier if it were just Narcissa and Draco. As shitty as he was to me in school, he was simply a bully and then just fucking scared. I can forgive that. It’s Lucius. The idea that I have to have that arsehole here in my house, to put up with his arrogant bullshit, it’s just …”
That was a promise they had not been able to keep. His acquisition of knowledge was a secret the clone guarded carefully.
It boosted morale to hear all the wonderful ways the Pirates were making their enemies' lives miserable and the effect on the fighters being attacked was as dramatic. They always won battles faster when Jordan reminded them how well they were doing.
A final look at the puzzle waiting to be solved, a deep breath to prepare and then the clone allowed himself to be drawn off.
It was the skull and crossbones, a pirates flag, and this the most famous of them all. A tricorn captain hat sat at a rakish angle on the skull and behind, a lightning bolt, cutting the black in bold jagged lines. This was the mark of the great Phoenix of the Sea, captained by the unstoppable Harry Potter.
“Harry, I know we thought this was just dodgy takeout, which, given that place you got it from, it still could be, but it might be wise to go and see a healer. Just to be sure, of course.” Draco’s voice was so kind that it made Harry’s heart melt.
“Send a couple of your people into the cabins. Those will be tight quarters and fighting won’t be as intense. Just make sure they are checking for traps as they go. The rest of us will investigate the hold.”
The clone was provided a simple white cotton shift and loose fitting trousers, as well as a small journal and quill to record his thoughts. The book had never been private, with techs and scholars often picking it up and leafing through it. The clone never did find out what they searched for.
I don’t really want to talk about those days, and those Hogsmeade trips though. I prefer my most recent one.
“She doesn’t. She said there’s a story in one of her medical books about it supposedly happening in the late 1600s, but no one is positive if it did or not.”
“I will, I promise. You too,” he responded. A nod and they were gone. Winky was watching him when he turned back in her direction and he gave her a small smile. “I’m going to go to bed, Winky. Will you wake me half an hour before breakfast is ready, if I’m not up yet?”
“I promise,” Harry said, nodding his head in Scorpius’ hands and kissing the end of his nose before handing him to Molly. “Be good for Nana and Poppy, and we’ll see you tomorrow. Love you, champ.”
“Come on, this is the best seat.” Harry made his way to a lounger in the centre of the garden and turned, clearly waiting for Draco. His mouth curved into a soft smile, and Draco’s heart pounded just a bit harder. Giving himself a mental shake, Draco made his way over and following Harry’s lead, laid down. The lounger wasn’t exactly built for two grown men, and Draco could feel the warmth of Harry’s arm next to his own, close enough to almost touch, and he could smell the lemons from his shampoo as they shared the small space. Feeling Harry’s gaze on him, Draco turned his head and looked into those intense green eyes. Time seemed to stand still, his heart beating frantically, captured in that gaze.
After a thorough examination and the typical battery of testing were complete, they waited nervously for the results. A short time later, the door to the exam room opened and their Obstetrician Dr. Smithers entered.
“So, Scorpius,” Draco began, his arm around his son’s shoulders, “tonight will be a different kind of story, okay?”
"Stupid way to sort the loot," the small man muttered. "...should be based on rank or seniority like a proper military."
The clone unconsciously straightened up. Harry Potter. He allowed his mouth to form the shape of it. The mighty 'He' that even Voldemort feared. Long arms wrapped around the clone's pale torso and a bit of smile played at the edges of his lips as he mouthed the name again and again.
True to word, Granger wasn't able to meet with Draco until Monday evening. Draco had spent the remainder of the week and most of the weekend being ignored by the black panther and reading book after book. When he was done with the books he had in his possession, he began analyzing all of them just to be certain he didn't miss anything important.
, he has never had the opportunity to fully treat a wild cat. Draco felt a shiver run through his blood as he thought about all the new challenges he soon will be facing. If there is one thing Draco has always known about himself, it was that he loved a good challenge. Also, seeing as his Animagus was that of the feline species, it will be very interesting to learn more about his larger family.
The meal time slowly came to a close as the moon started rising higher. The professors handed out the students parchments and ushered them to their designated rooms.
Forest had driven them to their hotel, but Harry and Draco refused to speak, just letting Forest happily rattled on and on about the beauty of the island.
He felt a knee nudging his thigh. Tingles formed around his leg from the soft touch. He opened one eye and saw Draco Malfoy looking at him with humor laced across his face, a single eyebrow raised, "Rough night, Potter?"
Harry looked up, confused on who he is talking to, "Um, are you.. did you hit your head that hard that you are now talking to air?"
Seeing the soft smirk gracing Malfoy's face and the bright eyes that danced with humor, he couldn't help but smirk back, "That is very true."
Harry hesitated before touching his arm softly, "No, I asked and I'm glad you trusted me enough to answer honestly."
The other person occupying the table finally raised his head up. Draco couldn't help but smirk at the exhausted green eyes looking back at his.
When the elevator dinged, Draco quickly shoved the three pamphlets into his pocket and turned towards the doors.
Draco couldn't help but lean closer to Harry. He put his elbow on the table and leaned his head into his hands. They just looked at each other for a moment.
Thomas shrugged, "'The caged ones finally have caged the un-cage-able.'" Draco turned to look at the other man with a quirked eyebrow. "That's what they kept saying."
The second Draco stepped into the tiny shack, every hair on his body stood up. Instantly recognizing the feel of the low rumble of magic.
He looked down at the hand. It felt nice. Extremely nice. He quickly nodded and tried not to be too disappointed when Draco took his hand away.
The cat looked down at his paws for a moment before looking towards its hostages. For a moment everything was still as the panther sat with an unreadable expression staring at the floating bodies before he jumped down from the boulder and began walking underneath the victims. Draco stood back as they both began to lower, dropping softly unto the cold, stone ground.
Draco leaned back, sighing. Deciding to cut his losses, he slowly stood, collecting the food bowl and refilled the water dish, hoping that tomorrow he could begin working on breaking down a few of the cat's walls.
, his mind supplied, but instead of his thin, long pale skinned hand, he found a slightly chunkier tanned one reaching out instead. A loud
The restroom was dimly lit, like it often was during late nights. He strolled over to one of the sinks and turned on the cold water, letting the water stream down his hands for a moment before rubbing it on his neck and face, letting the vague memories of his nightmares slip down the drain. The depression, he knew, would take a little longer to disappear.
Draco's office was quiet when he arrived, the only sound coming from the scratching of Draco's old and broken Quick Quotes Quill that sat on the highest shelf, locked in glass casing.
Harry plopped down, grabbing a cracker from the sleeve Hermione was holding. Draco gave them each a kiss on the cheek before sitting beside Harry.
"Either way, we need to figure out what to do and fast. The storm has already begun wrapping itself around the island." Widow Annie said, somberly.
They both stood up and stretched out their limbs. They grabbed their things, and began walking towards the hotel, talking about the lighter, fun things that have happened over the years.
He laid awake, staring at the top of his canopy for a long while, thinking over what exactly might happen if he and Malfoy actually hung out this weekend. Turning over to face the bed he knew held the strange boy, he prayed that what ever happens wouldn't ruin this small truce and acquaintanceship that the boys have fallen in to since the start of term.
Ginny and Luna dropped the many supplies they carried. An array of chips, snack cakes, dips, and finger sandwiches fell to the table. Malfoy placed down what looked like muggle soda along with pumpkin juice and plastic cups elegantly onto the table besides the snacks.
Slughorn hummed his approval as he walked pass them, only looking just a little bit upset that they did it correctly. After Slughorn found out about the book Harry was using during sixth year, he instantly took a dislike to him. He also didn't care too much for the Malfoy heir, either, because, well, he is the Malfoy heir.
Harry sighed and turned around, leaning against the sink, "Look I just.. no offense but we just met and I just.." Harry put his head in his hands. When he looked back up Hampton had moved a little closer.
The next morning, Harry woke up with a grin, still on a bit of a high from the previous day. He jumped out of bed, eager to get down stairs, and began getting dressed and ready for the day.
"That and much, much worse." Draco took a deep sip of water, "There is a reason Slytherins keep to themselves. None of us want our deep, dark secretes getting out."
After accidentally falling back asleep for the third time, Harry finally forced himself out of bed. The dorm room was empty, seeing as all of his roommates were more than likely eating a hearty, well-balanced breakfast in the Great Hall. His stomach rumbled thinking about it. He quickly threw his clothes on, grabbed a half eaten chocolate bar from the night before, and rushed out the room.
George slowly sat down in the worn out chair Hampton had vacated, Hampton took the blue chair across from it, "It's just so infuriating. He is giving everyone in our family a bad name. It's bad enough that he refuses to go to meetings and participate in rituals. He can't just be giving out something as precious as
The man smiled as he looked at Draco, "The landscape is marvelous isn't it? Many people travel here just to see the beauty.. or to study it." Draco hummed, acknowledging the words, not truly listening.
Once they all settled in, Fleur was the first to speak, "Harry, Draco has had a very, how do you say.. traumatizing experience since the months after the war. Since his birthday. I know you know of the Veela blood that runs through my veins, I don't keep that hidden, but Draco, his family holds the same blood." She paused, waiting for a sign of acknowledgement. Harry nodded, and she continued. "The blood that runs through his veins is much different than mine, however. The Malfoy family is very old family, with many things laced in it. As far as I know, the Malfoy's haven't had a true Veela in centuries, that is until Draco."
Since when had Draco cared who Harry was friends with? Harry had hung out alone with Pansy, Theo, Blaise, and even Crabbe and Goyle thousands of times before. But the second he tells Draco he's leaving to study with Hermione in the library or play Quidditch with Ron on the pitch, Draco's livid.
Blaise and Theo caught on when Draco's eyes would not leave Potter at the Yule Ball. When Draco droned on and on about how the Patil twin Potter took wasn't even pretty, and how Potter couldn't dance and if he took
Before he could lose his wit, Harry led his younger boyfriend through the Azkaban entrance and into the dark prison. He gulped, keeping his eyes off of the insane and depressed prisoners who were either muttering to themselves, screaming at anyone who walked by, or both. Ethan kept very close to Harry, but of his hands wrapped around Harry's arm. Harry didn't mind. It reminded him he was human and he felt and he thought and he had a soul.
But he didn't. The first thing he did was frown and think about how that wasn't normal, then wondered if Potter was okay or not. After all, if he didn't have Potter, who would he tease? His sarcastic remarks would go to waste. Young and naive thirteen year old Draco thought that that was what his worry was about.
His eyes snapped up and Harry saw that they were a cool shade of melted mercury, but if he tilted his head, they could be blue. It amazed Harry how he had never noticed how brilliant Draco Malfoy's eyes were.
, watching Madam Maxime fix Harry with a deathly glare as her and Fleur mumbled in furious French with one another, watching Dumbledore converse with McGonagall, Snape, and Crouch about what was to be decided, Harry began to feel very dizzy. He wanted nothing more than to go and find Ron, crash onto Ron's bed, make Ron shove him onto his own bed, sleep, then complain to Ron.
civil. He led the Slytherin to a back table near the corner where they wouldn't get stares because a) Harry always got stares, and b) they were together and they weren't fighting. He sat Malfoy down, much to his protest, since he kept demanding to know why Harry had brought him there. Once he shoved the boy back into a chair, he skimmed the aisles, looking for a book on dragons.
Hermione, on the other hand, would be far more challenging. She'd ask questions. Probably ones Harry didn't have answers to, and probably ones that would stress him out.
Though, he supposed he could relate to it. Confined in a space large enough to fly around and large enough to, if only for a moment, believe that you're free. But, when all is said and done, you are are still in a cage. You are still trapped. You are still not free.
Harry glanced at him. In that moment, and every moment for the past five years, all he could do was think about those wonderful weeks he had spent with Draco. He had gotten know him, gotten to
Frowning, Draco sat up and looked at Harry. "You- you need a date, Harry. You're a Triwizard champion, and the champions always dance with their partners to start off the night."
Draco stood up quickly. Harry pulled a ten inch hawthorn wand with a unicorn hair core out of his pocket. Draco's wand. Well, Harry
Hermione follows his gaze to the Slytherin table. "Oh, honestly, Harry! You're not still on about that silly Death Eater idea, are you?"
!" Harry breathed through his laughter. "They set me up with this, you know. All you had to do was put on the sweatshirt and it would turn into girl clothes. I've had it for a while but,
The boy nodded to the two larger boys next to him. "This is Crabbe and Goyle," he took a step forward so he was in front of Harry, on the step above him. "And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy."
Draco looked up guiltily. He opened his mouth, but Harry just shook his head. So, Draco closed his mouth. He looked down, willing himself not to let his threatening tears fall. All he felt was shame, and if his tears fell, he'd feel it ten times worse. One look at Harry had told Draco that, based on the stiff jaw and hard eyes, Harry wasn't happy.
"Would you stop saying his name like that?" Harry snapped. "And Draco's not... as bad as we thought. He's actually been quite helpful, and he's pretty funny, really..." He trailed off at the look on Ron's face. "What?"
"Yeah, I guess I'll be leaving then-" Draco moved to stand, but Harry wrapped his arms around him quickly, taking Draco by surprise. He slowly hugged Harry back as the raven haired boy buried his face in Draco's shoulder, kissing his exposed collarbone lightly, making Draco shiver, and not from the wind this time.
Harry, who had grown to be quite pleasant when in Malfoy's company, glared at the redhead. "Well I haven't exactly got
"I do mind," Draco glared at Harry. But it didn't mean anything. They bickered because it's what they know. And if they didn't bicker Draco would lose his mind, since he always has the constant need to complain and insult. Luckily he found Harry, who ignores him when he does that.
Well, not that easily. He was paired with someone his age that had been in the investigative department a bit longer, but that was okay. At least someone his age wouldn't treat him like an assistant made to serve coffee like the older ones did. He took the elevator up to Ron's office, who, even at this young age, was appointed head of the Case and On-Field Assignments, so he'd be able to tell Harry who his partner was and the information of the case.
The woman who got that ring was going to be lucky. But Harry knew that she wouldn't ever enjoy the fact that she had Draco as her own more than Harry would. Nobody could do that.
Harry put the scarf away, not wanting to get intoxicated by the scent ㅡ or worse, getting caught sniffing it. Harry looked at Draco's desk drawers, and opened the one which said
"You tricked me!" Harry laughed as Draco hid his face under the pillow. "Were you that desperate to get yourself in my bed?"
Harry jumped awake from his daze, and started to un-button his auror robes with shaky hands. He could feel Draco's piercing gaze on him, and Harry tried not to get flustered when Draco gently grabbed his hands and moved them away, continuing Harry's work. Harry could still remember how Draco's hands had felt on his skin, how Draco's breath had tickled his neck the morning after.
"Shit! Sorry, sorry..." but it was already ruined, and Draco wouldn't look at Harry again even as he wrapped bandages around Harry's thigh and hip. The gesture was so intimate that Harry thought that he may just pass away, especially when Draco's hands brushed against him sending jolts of electricity. When Harry was wrapped up, his pants and trousers pulled up by Draco, he realized that he needed to leave. Draco had already done enough for him, and Harry couldn't ask anything more because Draco was already everything Harry was asking. Except his.
Harry panted, and grimaced when a flash of hot pain shot through him. He imagined what he must look like compared to Draco, who was standing at the door with a glass of whiskey in his hand, still the clothes on that he'd wore at work under his auror robes. The posh git was looking at him across his nose, and for a moment Harry felt like a puppy at the sidewalk.
Draco pulled him in and while they were wrangling in their sheets, a Jack Russell Terrier appeared next to them, Ron's voice booming in the background: "
Harry dreamed of Draco for a moment longer, before his thoughts were thrown away by a knock on his door. Just when Ron stepped in did he realise that his office looked like after a hurricane. There were coffee mugs thrown across the desk, the brown circles from the cups permanently marked on his files and folders and sheets and papers. Harry's office was never really clean (except when Hermione popped in to bring lunch and proceeded to clean it, too), but this almost felt like a violation against his
"Transportation Tim ain't Tim no more." Harry was confused. Why was Ron telling him this and how come Transportation Tim isn't Tim anymore? Everyone in every single department knew him. He was famous for watering Debra's succulents with bleach for a whole year without getting caught. Debra always kept buying more and wondering why they died immediately. Needless to say, they didn't like each other. "She's now Tam. Transportation Tam without the 'portation'. I felt bad for laughing in the cafe when Bob said that." Ron chuckled a bit, blushing from shame, and then sighed when he looked at Harry.
Harry had seen Draco sad before. He'd seen him upset. But never, not once, did Draco let anything affect him to the point of tears. So, when Harry saw Draco's red eyes and tear-stained cheeks and trembling lip, he didn't hesitate before walking forward and revealing himself.
About a million strings tugged on Harry's heart when he saw Draco. The last time he had been this close to his former, well,
"What's that?" Ron asked, curious as ever, and choosing the worst possible time to look up from his plate full of breakfast. "Whoa, Harry. You look like you could murder a Horntail. What's wrong?"
, had been assigned his first case. He had transferred from the Auror on-field work to the investigative to try it out, and ended up loving it. He had assisted the older detectives on a few cases but now he had gotten his own.
So maybe the man who had ambushed him in Knockturn Alley earlier that day had been correct. What was it he had said? Ah, right-
Draco cleared his throat. "Maybe we should start with the kid," he nodded to the gas station, "Yes, we'll wake him up first-"
He watched Draco lie at the Manor and save Harry's life. Saw himself pull Draco onto the broom. Saw himself refuse Draco's kiss this time bc he had seen in his dreams the amount of killing and torturing Draco had done in the Manor.
"Whatever's best... better be... SLYTHERIN!" The hat yelled, and Professor McGonagall pulled it off Harry's head.
"I'm not sure I know what you mean," Harry said carefully. He refused to meet Draco's eyes, afraid of the emotions he would feel, but Draco was staring intently at Harry, his gaze unwavering.
Harry, who had never felt anything like the way Draco held him while he taught him how to dance before.
Harry, who saw Draco grow thinner and paler and more tired and sadder at the start of sixth year. Harry, who tried to help, but was pushed away. Harry, who watched the boy he loved go down the road he tried to prevent him from following.
on the piece of parchment and looked up, glaring daggers at the Slytherin table across the Great Hall. He was met with daggers right back, a cold glare from cold, grey eyes. Harry wanted to get up and yell at Draco right there, but he knew he couldn't. So, he looked back down at the box that held his tie and shirt he had left in Draco's dorm.
So, all in all, yes, they quite acted like friends. But, were they? Could you really go from three years of being enemies to just suddenly being friends over three weeks?
He got up off and walked over to Ron's bed, looking down at the angered ginger boy. "I didn't put my name in that cup.
"You did it," Draco was repeating, his face buried in the crook where Harry's neck met his shoulder and Harry found that he couldn't stop blushing. He laughed at Draco's concern.
"I'm flattered," Harry joked, and watched Draco look at him in confusion before understanding the joke. He didn't even bother with a rebuttal, he just rolled his eyes and dropped his head again. "I'll probably go without a date."
It took Harry a moment to figure out what Ron meant. Then his eyes widened in horror as he looked at Draco, who looked pale and like he might throw up at the realization that Harry was his partner. Harry looked back to Ron, who knew Harry and Draco's history. "Ron! No! Change it!"
It took all of Draco's willpower not to laugh at the look on Harry's face. "Yeah, so, you might want to tell me now if you're the Heir of Slytherin or not."
Of course, he didn't know that Draco Malfoy was thinking the exact same thing he was. He knew Harry's eyes had been green- everyone knows that. But what he didn't know was that they were a deep forest green on the outside and gradually faded to lighter shades until it got to the pupil.
Draco's voice was hoarse from lack of use and lack of water. Without a second thought, Harry had conjured him a glass and levitated it towards him. Draco was sitting in a chair outside the courtroom, Harry leaning against the wall across from him. Ethan had been sent to the council to announce their arrival.
It had been controversial, to allow someone to give a blow-by-blow on the battle. Harry had been nervous but allowed himself to be talked into giving it a try.
Harry took a moment to turn, face Neville and look him right in the eye. "See you on the other side." Then he moved, striding purposefully across the deck to take his place near the bow.
I never expected that I’d one day find myself in charge of the Ravenclaw team, but they needed a coach. My Slytherin roots will never leave me, but that said, I now have two teams to root for to destroy Gryffindor. And trust me, we will. Calcagno is an excellent keeper and I’ve taught Piper some of my finest moves. I may not have beaten you in school, but this is the year Gryffindor goes down.
While the observers made marks on their charts, the clone let his mind go back to the ideas presented in the journal. Voldemort had split his soul so many times to make the Horcruxes, did what he have left count or had those actions resulted in his current insane behavior? Was the ghost that haunted the capital what remained of Voldemort's soul or some other part of him?
When the pair reached the gates, they turned and looked back at the house. The grim grey stones had been resurfaced in warm tan stone, and the new windows shone in the sunlight. The pointed turret tops had been replaced with a flat roof and family garden. It made Harry smile, knowing it was modeled after his own little oasis that the Malfoys had fallen in love with, and meant that a small part of himself was part of this regal, ancestral home.
The only thing Harry registered was the excited squeeze of Draco's hand as Harry apparated them through the Ministry's wards.
During the apparition Harry had successfully pulled the other Death Eater in a spin with him, resulting in splinching the Death Eater, but also himself. Then there had been three more of them, four to fight, and Harry's mind had been in a whirl. It was lucky that he'd even had the concentration to apparate away. But then, he didn't even want to think about how Draco's address had been the first one to come to mind.
