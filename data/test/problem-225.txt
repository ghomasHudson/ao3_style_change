was filled with the highest level of concealment charmswork, but today, after weeks of frustration, Rodolphus told him that Lucius gave in and just opened the necklace in a moment of anger, figuring out that it was a fake, and the real
The elder Malfoy was almost seventy, with thin hair, his once proud posture a little hunched over, his height now almost the same as hers, and his pale skin turned wrinkled and stained – however, with his wits intact and eyes as piercing as ever, people never stopped being intimidated by him.
Draco stretched his hand to hold Bellatix’s wand with her – a common request of Draco for the members of the family, that after failed attempts of trying to explain why it wasn’t polite to touch another wizard's wand, decided to just indulge him. After all, it was his way to get closer to his loved ones magic.
“Who is going to teach me?” he asked, curiously, since Professor Trelawney’s name was not in either one of the lists provided.
Miles pointed his wand towards the shadows were they were hiding and casted:
“We’re wasting time” Harry whispered between clenched teeth.
Draco laughed out loud – he just couldn’t help it! He was feeling so
He was woken up a few hours later, with Genevieve on his chest and the arm he had placed under his head uncomfortably numb. The sky was still bright, but with the Sun much lower in the horizon. Beside him, a Hufflepuff boy was crouched down and shaking his shoulder. He stopped once Draco was awake.
Severus Snape appeared shortly after, seeming reserved and strict, walking fast and not allowing too much conversation. He had greasy hair and Draco was pretty sure that the man was using a spell to make his robes flow dramatically around him – Draco really wanted to ask about it, but he had a feeling the man wasn’t going to appreciate it very much, so he stayed quiet. And soon enough, Draco was alone in his common room.
Scattered through the property were also a few greenhouses, a single tower, a well kept crypt, an owlery, and other miscellaneous structures.
In the aftermath, Harry was sweaty and tired, his cheeks hurting from smiling so much. He was feeling light and happy, before he turned and saw James and Sirius smiling at one another, both flushed and sweaty. Ordinarily, it would be a normal occurrence, but the event of the night before - that Harry had pushed to the back of his mind - came back with force, and made him uncomfortable and irritated.
“I’ll be right there!” he screamed back to the Hufflepuff student from his year that was standing close to the castle, before talking to Draco in a lower voice.
“I see you’re excited for the learning experience” Ron jumped up with the unexpected voice, just to see Malfoy taking a seat in front of them. He didn’t have any books with him, only his very pale wand, that had multiple small runes engraved in it. The blonde boy flashed them a white teethed smile, that, to Ron’s dismay, made Hermione stutter in her greeting.

he smiled teasingly.
was a tricky charm, sure, but it was based on emotion, and one thing Draco was always in touch with was emotion. A whole month had gone by since the whole Dementor debacle, and he was still annoyed. His and Pansy’s parents were absolutely irate when they heard about it, but the ministry wouldn’t change their stance. His father told him that he was once offered to join the board of governors of Hogwarts; after all of this he would probably rethink his previous refusal.
“So I’m bad at biology. So what?” Harry tried to hide the desperation in his voice. It’s not like his friends were going to guess that Harry was a
Just the thought of it made Harry’s hands all sweaty. Could it possibly be that –
So, even if Harry had suffered a bit of paternal pressure to befriend her at first, they were good friends now. Hermione, Ron and Harry were closer then the boys were with any other students - even Seamus and Dean -, and it made her so
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
“This is all very stupid” he voiced. Sybill only huffed. “I’m serious” Draco continued “Look, think like this: if the things
Harry thought. One second the boy looked cold and detached, and then he was all sweet smiles. And those spells? Merlin they weren’t even Hogwarts level. Harry imagined where the other boy could have learned those. It wasn't as if his family didn't already have a reputation for dark magic. As Remus finished the lesson and gave off homework, Harry’s mind was analyzing everything. Why did Malfoy even singled him out as his partner? He was already friends with the other Slytherins, and it’s not like he had no other options among the Griffyndors, because he had plenty – just one look to all the blushing girls could tell you that. So what was he playing at?
Harry was still snickering after Malfoy stomped out of the Great Hall, small white flowers leaving a delicate trail behind him. Down the Gryffindor table, Tessa’s face was bright red.
Moments later, the rest of his family had mounted the brooms that were in the shed, and Harry was no longer alone in the air.
“Okay...” she worried her lip, nervous about what could have happened.
But he decided to cooperate.
He hoped he would never need to have this conversation with the Malfoys, but obviously the stars hadn’t heard his pleas.
“Well, can’t you?” he indicated Fang, that, Harry didn’t realize, was trying to get closer to him, but seemingly couldn’t, because he kept getting pushed back by an invisible force. Wide eyed, Harry stared at the cat once again. “How’s she doing that?”.
Draco was disappointed, because he really had been curious about the boy, but he refused to be mistreated for things he had no control of. And besides, he learned a long time ago that he shouldn’t let others negative emotions reach him. So, he decided, Harry was just not worth the trouble.
However, Draco didn’t really have other matters to attend, he actually had nothing to do. That’s why he was strolling through the castle before, looking for someone to talk to – since his friends were doing some important charms essay and had kicked him out of their rooms – or some activity to take part on. He had been glad to find Ron and Hermione outside of the castle, well, at least until Potter came along. Now Draco was sitting in the alcove of some random tower, sulking away.
The Slytherins were already sitting on the right side of class when they arrived, Harry noticed Malfoy sharing a table with Pansy Parkinson, nodding while she spoke but looking distractedly at the Grindylows in the aquarium that was in front of the room. Remus was standing while waiting for the rest of the students to arrive, and smiled and nodded at Harry as the boy grinned wildly at the professor.
The thing is, all these Valentine Day’s shenanigans weren’t even that stressing – Draco was just constantly on the edge of a mental breakdown, or at least that was he felt like most of the time.
Thank you for reading! Let me know how you liked this chapter, or if you find any mistakes in need of correcting!!
Bella felt her eye twitch once before she gripped her wand tighter to cast:
Soon enough, they were all sitting around the fireplace, catching up before dinner - Harry noticed years ago how much his aunt and uncle loved to talk, mostly about boring subjects. They were bragging about a promotion Vernon got at work, then about a vacation to Majorca they were planning for the next month, about their car, how Dudley was doing at school and his new diet, they mentioned their neighborhood's new gossip, and even about Petunia’s new book-club. Honestly, Harry was about to snore right then and there. He looked over at Dudley, who was looking at the wall with no expression on his face – the poor boy was desensitized. James seemed to actually be paying attention to what they were saying - he always put extra effort to welcome them – but Harry noticed that he would occasionally send, very discreetly and wandlessly, light stinging hexes towards Sirius, who every now and then blinked for a little too long. Tessa was squirming, and gave Harry a look of pure agony, to which he was very sympathetic.
” Sirius interrupted, looking a little confused. Harry nodded. “The only Malfoy your age is Narcissa’s boy, but he was studying in France, last I heard”.
She pouted at him, but not for long, since a cackling Blaise swoop in with an arm around her shoulders. The two of them kept going to the Great Hall in a discreet fit of giggles.
After saying goodbye to Remus, Harry decided to spend some time with Hagrid. He still hadn’t properly spoken with his friend this school year, and was feeling guilty about it.
“...but?” Harry asked, worried. “But” Remus sighted “yesterday evening three of them got close to the castle, and there was a incident with two other students. They recovered fine, but it was concerning. Their parents were notified and are irate, understandably so.”
He couldn’t stop replaying Potter’s words in his head. They hurt, Draco had to admit.
When his professor woke up, he gave her water and explained everything that happened. She looked as spent as he felt. Since Trelawney wasn’t really up to discussing the whole ordeal with him, they sat in silence waiting for Draco’s parents response - Draco could feel that Genevieve had already delivered the message.
They were late, Bellatrix realized, as she saw Alicia Malfoy – Lucius’s mother – dead on the floor, eyes wide open. Lucius and Narcissa were desperately picking themselves up, after probably being thrown to the walls, strangled sobs leaving the latter, as the Avada Kedavra curse was leaving the Dark Lord’s wand. She took one last look to the blond boy crying on the marble floor before green engulfed him.
While in his way through the castle, Draco had to change his route to avoid Filch and his cat – with his regular magical sensitivity, he wouldn’t be able to sense the man approaching, since he was a squib, but Draco was on high alert tonight, so he noticed him trough his emotions instead. He was technically allowed to be out after curfew, but it would be a stretch to explain why he was leaving Trelawney’s privet quarters at two in the morning – and Draco didn’t need that type of scandal.
“We also call the students to the halls. We need a lot of people to see him, so the news can get out and Dumbledore won’t be able to keep denying it” Amanda completed.
Draco didn’t know what he had done to the boy, but he suspected that the answer was ‘nothing at all’. He had met people who held his parents former crimes over his head before, it was frustrating, but it had happened. Draco suspected that it was the case for one Harry Potter. His father was Head Auror after all, it only made sense.
And for that handful, the whole ordeal was very entertaining.
really annoying.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry! Wha’ a surprise! Do come in” Hagrid pulled Fang away and gestured for Harry to sit at the table, while he started to make some tea. Harry was going to drink more tea today then, yay.
Amanda was Flint’s girlfriend, and was brought into their scheming with no objection from Miles, since he knew she was smart and would actually be more helpful than Marcus in the planning and execution of their little project.
“Come on, let’s have a chat before I have to leave” Sirius directed them around the castle, and they walked slowly towards the front entrance, chatting about Sirius’s last trip and how Harry was enjoying the year so far. They got a little stuck on the subject of Harry’s father. It was no surprise that the man wasn’t doing very well, being the Head Auror and dealing with Peter’s escape. But Sirius assured Harry that he was planning to stick around until everything was dealt with.
with their headmaster.
“Draco?”. He opened his eyes to his teacher sitting in front of him.

“Ok” Draco smiled back, feeling a little light headed.
” Oliver finished.
His own screams were the last thing he heard before passing out.
BEFORE
“Really?” he asked, excited.
Hermione gasped but her worries were unfunded, because Malfoy just raised his empty hand and deflected the spell wordlessly. He at least looked a little alarmed. Harry felt embarrassed by his friends reproving and impressed expressions, so he turned and left, this time for real.
“Well, would anybody like to hear about that time Tessa had a acidental magic situation when we were in the
Blaise mentioned this to Pansy, while on their way to the Slytherin Common Room to get changed for the Hufflepuff’s celebration, and she agreed with him, of course.
Harry wanted to tell them to shut up, but honestly, his own book was forcibly closed with spell-o tape, after his father
“Look at this question” Daniel pointed at the one that was crossed over with red marker “If you, with all of those expert teachers and extra classes, can’t figure it out, it means we were totally justified” he said expectantly.
Angrily, he had gone to Trelawney, asking her to continue the lessons in the annoying spell - to what she agreed, looking unimpressed.
“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named”
She prided herself on being smart, and faced with a different reality from the one she grew up with, she
“I had detention with Snape” Harry answered, and waited for Draco’s justification. But guess what? he wasn’t getting it.
that is going to be?” Ron threw his arms up, exasperation cutting through his tiredness.
“And you still believe you’re not dramatic?” Pansy raised a perfectly arched eyebrow. Draco didn’t dignify the remark with a response.
“Probably nothing” she set her shoulders “Do you want me to get the Cloack from Tessa? I know she has it right now”
Draco scowled and dislodged his hand from hers “I do
Harry observed the exchange. Although Malfoy’s expression stayed interested and polite, with a subtle smile, Nott and Zabini were raising their eyebrows and stealing glances at one another, sometimes looking at the rest of the second year girls that were still by the door. When Tessa came back to her friends, her face was beat red and she was panting, as if she just ran a marathon. Draco went to breakfast as if nothing had happened, but with the other boys laughing silently behind him.
“Yeah but, Hermione, it
other students, Draco was a Malfoy, and that meant he wouldn’t be undignified. So, before he stepped onto to the stairs leading to the headmaster's office, he straightened his back, put on a blank expression, tightened the hold on his cat – that started to squirm back to consciousness due to Draco’s worried emotions – and made an effort to look as if nothing was wrong.
Either way, he was very much done with the bothersome and, honestly, ineffective displays.
“Yeah, I’m sure” Draco said “I’m Draco, by the way”
The game was obviously influenced by the atmosphere in the stands, with Hufflepuff in a winning streak never seen before. Which fed the cheering even more, with students that came in with red and gold now transfiguring their garments to black and yellow. At some point, the collective excitement even made Blaise join the cheering. He spent the rest of the game jumping, screaming and singing along with the other students, one arm laced with Pansy’s, and other with Daphne Greengrass.
They both looked over at Miles, who groaned inwardly.
The lesson was great, Remus was great at engaging the students and getting his point across, everyone was understanding and enjoying the class, including the Slytherins. Crabbe and Goyle even asked a question, it was a stupid question, nonetheless, but at least it showed they were interested.
Harry now was looking at her intently, like it was his first time hearing english after listening to only russian for months. She took a breath before continuing.
The surface of the lake below him was glimmering with the reflexes of the Sun, and as Harry looked down, he saw his own reflection, grinning wildly back at him.
Miles sighted before turning back to Flint.
“Wait! I got a condition!” he managed to say though the embraces “It has to be after this school year. There’s no way I can do this right now”
Now, Draco was lighter and more himself, and if the cost of it was a little slaking in a few of his many obligations, then so be it. He was
. Marcus, it’s up to us”
. He literally could feel the flow of magic round him - for Morgana’s sake! Nonetheless, Draco’s skin wasn’t very thick – he was mature enough to admit that. And that stupid Gryffindor had hit a sensitive spot, the spot that always questioned why Draco’s parents had such high expectations for him, how reformed were his parents - it always hurt to think of the War, his family's part on it - that Draco was actually inferior to everyone, and everything he thought made him stronger, would be his demise. Merlin, he was so boring in his depressions.
“Not really Petunia. I’ve gotten a few offers, but I think I might stay here for a little while longer. I think it will be a nice change of pace” he smiled. At the end of the table, Harry and Tessa exchanged excited looks. They
“Well, better him than Harry” he muttered, making Harry spill his pumpkin juice “I thought she was done with that”.
Harry was laughing and cheering with his friends, very proudly showing the Snitch to Ron and Hermione, who joined him in the ground. Before he got down, Harry saw a glimpse of a head of very pale blond hair leaving in the direction of the castle.
Again, he was a really bad liar.
Narcissa was in the Garden, in the section Lucius had dedicated to her all those years ago - but the Diamonds weren’t reflecting any prisms under the clouded sky.
Pansy’s loud sob reverberated as Malfoy then hit the ground before them, unconscious.
When the War broke out, the Manor was filled with Death Eaters, and Lucius was acting so brain-washed that she suspected he was under the
. Ok?”
“What’s her name?”
Pansy rolled her eyes when she saw him “There goes his ‘impenetrable Malfoy façade’”
On the other side of the greenhouse, Ron and Harry were having some trouble completing the assignment. Their Vampiric Vegetation was agitated and biting at any attempt to get close. Ron’s calming spells were unstable and Harry’s gloves were all torn up already. He got a particularly nasty bite when Draco, still working with Hermione, threw his head back to laugh after his own joke. Harry snapped his head up at the sound and stopped paying attention to the sharp fangs near his fingers. Ron slapped him in the back of the head, deciding he would now do the extractions while Harry tried the charmswork.
The dungeons were cold and humid, but had a regal tone to them, with expensive furniture, many detailed paintings, dim lighting and a very wide fireplace – all in a pallet of greens, silver and black, tied up with dark woods and sparse gems and gold. Draco was still accessing his surroundings when the common room entry wall dissipated and Slytherin students of all years walked in.
Harry sat down on the floor besides his sister and grabbed her head to close her mouth forcefully “Ok, ok... It was not that big of a deal” he explained. But Tessa was surprisingly strong for her size and managed to get out of his hold and elbow him in the ribs. “Yes it was!” she was still laughing “You almost pissed yourself and your eyes were this big!” she used her fingers to push the skin of her face away from her eyes and managed to make a pretty disturbing image, that got the others to keep cackling at his expense. But no worries, Harry knew how to procede.
“Oh hello darling boy! Look how handsome you are, it’s been so long, you’ve gotten so tall!”
As an answer, Ron just pointed at the Maradeurs Map, sitting on the small table in front of them, where Harry sat it when his friend walked in. It was still displaying the Divination classroom. Harry cringed.
“What’s all this?”
“Then just call it off” Pansy huffed when Draco bugged her for head scratches. She always made a scene of rolling her eyes and looking exasperated, but she always gave in. “It’s not like she needs a tutor, and you’re not that great of a teacher”.
Overall, Ron was pleasantly surprised. Malfoy ignored the theory in the books, making them think about what the wand movements meant and the process of how the spell is suppose to act – Ron wondered if that was the teaching method in France.
- I am very sorry, but I'm not from the UK and don't know how to make this very cohesive, as it happens there in the 90's. If you see something wrong, let me know and I'll try to make it better!!
After talking for a while longer, all the boys were soon in bed, after all, tomorrow was the fist day of school. Draco was looking forward to it.
When he got to his dormitory, his friends were already asleep. With a pounding headache, Draco made a cocoon around himself with the blankets and raised his occlumency shields as best as he could, hoping for a good night of sleep.
“Thanks Tessa, I appreciate it” he hugged her, tucking her head beneath his chin “What d’you ask him, anyway” he asked, letting her go. “I just introduced myself” Harry raised his eyebrows,
“How appropriate” Draco laughed. He thought about all of those convenient articles that would pop out of the blue and give his family the upper hand of multiple situations in the past. He guessed that there were good advantages to uncovering a stray Animagi – his Mother could name three more, of various lines of work.
Bella was half-heartedly sending the animated cadavers back into the water as she tried to listen for whatever he was reciting so intently. He didn’t acknowledge her or the undead army until one of them got close enough to grab onto his robes. He gave her a disapproving look as she propelled the creature away with a jet of fire.
Harry was in his third year at Hogwarts, and had seen boys dating boys before, and it was no big deal, no one said anything about it.
Hermione overcompensated by being the best, showing that she
He watched as a large painting of a landscape slid sideways in the wall in front of him, showing a metal door carved full of runes glowing red. The door opened, and Draco walked in to see a simple black book jump from one of the cramped up shelves into the floor in front of him.
“Yes, nothing’s wrong, I just want to talk to you for a bit, is that alright? It’ll only take one second” he assured her.
They fled through the castle, approaching the DADA corridor, where they had seen the older students earlier. After a moment, the white ferret faded away in a mist. Blaise and Pansy came to a halt, looking around for another thing to guide them, but they only saw the Gryffindors following behind them that found no alcove or nook to hide in the open corridor.
However, most students didn’t notice those other things. Probably because they didn’t pay as much attention as Miles, who was
They said goodbye to Sirius’s relatives first, Dora ruffled Harry’s hair and promised to update him in her Auror exams soon, she also winked at Remus before stepping into the fireplace, leaving him positively red. James and Sirius made fun of him for it, before McGonagall recruited Remus to help her guide a mostly unconscious Hagrid back to Hogwarts. The Abbotts then said their goodbyes, followed by Augusta, whose tall and extravagant hat was lopsided in her head. Hermione’s family were the last ones to leave, through the front door, after having watched with wide eyes all the other guests being consumed by green flames.
“And how is Lycanthropy transmitted?” Snape looked over the class, making a point of ignoring Hermione’s raised hand. “Mr. Potter, maybe you can enlighten us” he drawled.
“I know you are up to something” Harry blocked his way.

Harry could say “
Everything was perfect in Narcissa’s life, as far as she was concerned, but that changed pretty quickly, when their families got closer and closer to the ideas of one Lord Voldemort. Before she even realized it, Lucius was so roped up in the whole crusade that the Malfoy Manor was being offered as residence for the now He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and their money and influence being used at his mercy.
Cedric smiled.

Two weeks had passed since third year had started, and things were going well. Since Draco had transferred from Beauxbatons, Pansy rekindled her friendship with him and Blaise. Although they all pretty much grew up around each other, and were the best of friends when younger, when her and Blaise started Hogwarts they drifted apart to different friendgroups. She still loved and appreciated Blaise, but he got closer with Theodore, while Pansy connected better with Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis.
know, is that he is not getting anywhere near you kid, that’s for sure”.
Draco laughed and hugged them once again, really happy to have such good friends in this new school. As they bickered with one another, Pansy and Blaise introduced Draco to the rest of their class and a few other students. Some of them he already knew, and most of them he at least heard of, after all, the Slytherin house is known for having either pure-bloods or families of high social standing, and he was familiar with those. He noticed that most of the students were curious about him, probably because they heard about the Malfoy family before. Draco knew that he had a reputation to uphold, but he didn't bother to put up a cool exterior when meeting his housemates, that was for outsiders. /p>

However, there were other things about the boy that the others didn’t seem to notice: Draco Malfoy - the perfect poster child for the First Families, Pureblood Traditions and Old Magic... didn’t care about blood purity.
“My apologies Milord, I’ve been distracted, there’s been so many new developments in our front today... hard to keep up” she managed to keep her voice still, while trying desperately to keep her mind blank and protected from any
“It was a impressive dive he did today” Blaise offered, distractedly.
Abraxas looked very smug as she began to drink.
“You are oftly silent lately Mrs. Malfoy, nothing to add to the conversation?” he said with a low voice, while holding a glass full of one of the most expensive wines from the Manor’s cellar.
“So, what would you like to revise?” the Slytherin asked, leaning over the table to peak at their notes. Although the boy seemed nice and calm, Ron couldn’t help to think that he also looked a little stiff, as if he was calculating his movements.
Malfoy deflected it wordlessly “I thought you were a seventh year, Miles” he sounded bored, maybe amused, but if you paid attention, he had his fist clenched around his wand, his posture stiff and nervous. He countered with
Narcissa gave Cygnus multiple tours of the grounds after her marriage, but he was still as enchanted by them as he’d been in his fist visit.
And, who knows, maybe the boy doesn’t know about Lupin, and will actually help them expose the creature.

“I’m as good as a
James Potter punched the tree beside him, so hard that leaves fell around him and his knuckles got bloody. He was so angry that the men around him didn’t dare to utter a word, and just waited on what to do next.
“Well, uh, do you know who you were speaking to, just now?” she looked at him intently, making him squirm, before furrowing her brows “Tell me this is just about you being an overprotective brother Har”.
She calmed herself thinking of her nephew. Just a week ago Narcissa and Lucius came to her, after listening to the prophecy, begging for secrecy. Draco had been premature, for over a month. They didn’t know if that made him fit the criteria of “end of July”, since his actual birth was June 5th, but they didn’t want to find out. The whole family kept their mouths shut about it, and she didn’t regret it one bit.
Later that day, Theresa found Harry in one of the alcoves of the Clock Tower that looked over the Courtyard, where the older students were preparing to leave for Hogsmead.
“What about you?” the Hufflepuff asked, looking up “Are you doing anything special today...? With... anyone in particular...?” Cedric seemed to cringe at himself by the end on the sentence.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
“Professor?” Draco opened the door to the astronomy tower slowly “Ah, yes Draco, do come in, I was just getting my divination lessons ready for my next class. Go sit down over there, I’ll be right with you”.
When he woke up, it was about 3am. The ghost of the excessive amount of food he had forced down his throat during dinner came back to hunt him, and he felt the need to get up and walk it off. He put on his fluffy slippers and his red and gold robe - it would have been really weird if he weren't selected into Griffyndor -  and went down the stairs to the kitchen, meaning to get himself a big glass of water, maybe a mild potion, before trying to fall asleep once again. But when he got to the living room, he froze in his tracks after hearing voices from the kitchen. He stood in silence for a second before relaxing – he recognized the sound of Sirius and James talking.
Oliver rolled his eyes before getting up from his bed and looking though a bundle of papers in one of his drawers. He came back with the said biology test and sat besides Harry, giving him the paper. Daniel scooted closer too, looking at the test in Harry’s lap.
“Very good, Peter. I must say, I had my doubts. But tonight, you have proven me wrong, and I am glad” the Dark Lord broke into a grin, and the man at his feet blushed and giggled in delight, like a little girl.
Draco was disappointed at that. He wanted to spend a little more time with the other student. Especially after noticing how good the Hufflepuff was looking, with his soft brown hair and long legs stretched in front of him.
She prided herself on being smart, but sometimes, she wondered if she would ever, truly, feel smart.
Harry was flying languidly over the Quidditch Pitch, occasionally dodging the bludger that the Ravenclaw beaters would send his way, and searching for signs of the Golden Snitch. So far he had no luck. He blamed Draco Malfoy – just a little bit.
The overwhelming support for Hufflepuff surprised both teams when they entered the pitch – said team with impossibly wide smiles and incredulity, and Gryffindor with frowns and confusion.
After that, Draco was never happier, showering everyone with a compelling atmosphere of such love and acceptance, that the adults had to limit their number of guests and events at the Manor, because people were getting addicted to it.
Hermione’s face was all scrunched up while she opened her mouth to reply, and Ron almost recoiled in the eminence of her retaliation, when they both got distracted by some giggling coming from the other side of the table. They turned to see Malfoy using his hand to cover his mouth while he laughed.
“It will happen tonight. The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant had been chained and tonight he set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid, greater and more terrible than he ever was. Tonight... the Servant... to rejoin... his master...”
There, his mother and his aunt were talking quietly over some tea. He sat down at the remaining chair around the patio table, and as soon as he was accommodated, a house elf appeared by his side, asking his tea preference. Kreacher was a very old and grumpy elf, an ugly looking thing, but constantly pampered and fussed over by the remaining Blacks, since he was almost as old as the house itself. After the elf brought him his beverage, his mother and aunt decided to include him on the conversation.
It was astounding to Draco how someone that oozed perfection could act so unsure of himself.
“Okay then” Draco nodded and proceeded to make his way back to the dungeons.
Lucius let go of Draco and was calling for Nacissa as Rodolphus started casting diagnostic spells on his wife, who was trying “Lumos!” loudly over and over again, tears streaming down her face.
“It would be more easily justifiable” Hermione raised her brows “Not that I would condone it” she added quickly after.
“Okay then” Pansy tried to keep a clear head, since Draco was looking lost and Blaise had wide and manic eyes “You go get a teacher” she ordered to the latter, that nodded before turning to were they came from and started running. She faced Draco “What should we do? Is it trying to hurt us? Or to get inside the castle? Should we run away too?”.
“... too late Amanda, we’re already too deep into this. If we stop now, Dumbledore is just going to protect him again. But you can be
“Oh, you should have opened Sirius’s last letter!”
“Malfoy. What are you doing here? How did you find me?”. Draco looked a little insulted at that, and a little mad, but the last part didn’t seem directed at Harry. The blond boy looked down at the cat sitting besides Harry.
Is not like he thought that the boy has plotting the demise of the Wizarding World or whatever Harry was delirious about, but still, Ron just didn’t trust him. Was it because a lot of girls payed too much attention to him? Maybe. But he told himself that the other boy was also suspiciously good in class, and that whole distant attitude was strange.
Happy reading!
“Yeah, apparently” he held a hand to help her up, and handed her the share of the books he had picked up.
Ginny” Ron continued, making a disgusted face.
He couldn’t quite remember her name, but he knew she was a year older than him. She was small, with hair almost as dark as his. Harry thought she looked cute, but he didn’t like the whole tailing him strategy, and he wasn’t going to let her get away with it.
“Darling, I know we’ve already discussed your schedule, and all the things you need to do to better prepare yourself to the future” his Mother started.
Let me know what you think so far!!!
They went to the back of the class with the rest of the students and drawn out their wands, Harry noticed that Draco’s was a very light colored oak one.
, but Draco never thought he would try to use the technique on a student.
self centered?" he sounded insulted. Harry couldn't help but notice he didn't answer the question. As Draco turned to walk away, finishing the conversation, Harry couldn’t contain himself, so he asked one more harmless question “What’s her name?”
For a wild moment, Draco wanted to roll around in the grass and just enjoy the fluttering feeling in his stomach, but he remembered he was a Malfoy and should have some self respect. He settled for going after Blaise and Pansy to force them to hear him gossip about Cedric for many hours.
The three of them rushed through the halls, hearts beating fast and trying to keep silent. Harry wanted to intercept Malfoy right away, but he was already very close to the other older students. Eventually, they stumbled upon Zabini and Parkinson, both wide eyed and with casual robes thrown on top of their pajamas.
Malfoy’s expression was serious, but Ron’s was angry and Hermione’s was sad. Harry turned around to leave, once again. And once again, a posh accent stopped him “Poor Golden boy, are you feeling threatened? That’s why you’re dumping your insecurities all over the place?” the tone was mocking but his words were rushed - however, Harry barely registered any of this, and before Malfoy finished talking Harry already had his wand out and was sending a very strong stinging hex towards him.
“Focus. Breathe in, and breathe out. Think of your chosen memory in detail, of what makes you happy. Feel your energy, let it flow thr-“
“Oh, I see why you’ve been having trouble” Trelawney said, sparking his interest “Don’t think of it as exposing your happy memories, but as taking ownership of them” she finished, simply. And just like that, it all clicked in Draco’s head.
“Yeah?” Cedric’s smile widened “With me?”
away, to take the prophecy to his parents. He usually would never expect her to go such a long distance for just a letter, but she understood that the situation was out of the ordinary.
He reached Harry’s bedside, and touched his face carefully, brushing away his wild hair. After checking with Madam Pomfrey that the boy was indeed alright, he looked over his son’s classmates. James was very similar to Harry, even though some of Harry’s features were more harmonic, others softer – his mother’s influence, she suspected – but James’s eyes where from a deep brown, when Harry’s were green.
With that guilt in mind, James got in his car and headed home. It was a flying car, courtesy of Arthur Weasley. Since James now lived in the Potter State, in the outside of London, he had to take precautions to appear muggle, to blend with the neighborhood, and that included leaving and arriving from work by car – what the car did in between destinations wasn’t anyone's business.
he thought to himself, before falling asleep.
Now, they were all slumped in Oliver’s room, looking over some of his miscellaneous comics while they chatted about their school, updating Harry on the gossip. As they got caught up on the absurdity of a past biology test, Harry disassociated, because is not like he had biology tests in Hogwarts.
Now, knowing that the 'girlfriend' was Harry’s Godfather...
“What do you mean?” Harry asked.
He was petting her head when she sat up, looking intently to the direction of the trees besides them. Harry was about to stupidly ask her what was up, when he heard footsteps from that direction. Harry didn’t know what he was expecting, but it wasn’t Draco Malfoy.
“Confusion is a part of life” a soft voice spoke before him. Harry open his eyes quickly, to find a tall translucent figure looming above the ground “However, it is important to try and find the answers to what matters to us”.
She must have given him a very insulting look, for the way he admonished her like she was a petulant child.
Harry looked at Remus with wide eyes.
“Insolent child” professor Trelawney muttered, but allowed Draco to try without her guidance.
The Malfoys might seem reformed and all of that, but it never hurts to be careful. Tessa knew that too. So instead of arguing and telling Harry he was paranoid, like some people would sometimes do, she just nodded, defeated. “Okay, I get it” she smiled softly at him, resigned.
, she screamed, and as she did, the fire in the torches went out.
Blaise furrowed his eyebrows “Do you even have the time to do that?”. He knew that his friend had had plenty of fun rounding up the crowd and organizing today’s event – but he had also neglected many of his other obligations to do so.
Seeing Severus, James’s already enraged face only grew darker, throwing vicious curses at Pyrites, while not allowing Snape to go through him. But Severus wasn’t there to fight James or kill children, so instead on engaging, he tried to find a way around him – and that was when he noticed that Peter wasn’t in the bodybind or even in the room anymore. “PETTIGREW” he raged, as he saw a ugly rat climbing the last steps of the stairs behind James.
“Ohh, Harry...” Hermione’s expression turned pitying. Harry hated it. He looked at Ron for support, but the other boy seemed conflicted, if not confused again.
was breathing steadily –
Draco started on his breathing exercises as he waited, pulling the air in, holding on to it for a couple of seconds before exhaling slowly. He could feel the subdued buzz of the castle around him, the steady energy from Trelawney, and the waves of raw magic from the Forbidden Forest outside the large windows. If he focused, he could feel faint magical signatures from witches and wizards on the castle, the most noticeable one being Dumbledore, pacing in his study, feeling... conflicted? Or maybe –
charm for good mesure when he caught Ginny staring at him from across the room. He turned back to his friends, and exhaled.
“Harry! Wait, I didn’t mean to imply...” Hermione started, but Harry cut her off.
In the Headmaster’s office, the Sorting Hat was brought to determine in which house Draco would be in, and although he was pretty much sure about how it was going to go, he still beamed at his parents when the hat announced “Slytherin” before even touching his head.
Before she felt her own knees give out, she remembered hearing a loud voice screaming out a spell.
He touched the book.
if it’s not something very new? If they are happy, isn’t it all that matters? It’s been twelve years since Mom died. I think Dad deserves to love again”

“Oh, yeah, I forgot you are a big bad Slytherin. I’ll try to remember next time. But just so you know, taking a nap on the grass, under the sun, while cuddling with a cat and with flowers in your hair... It’s not the most threatening of images, you might want to work on that” he teased.
It was ironic, funny even, that something like that had to happen in a family that practically had a tradition of being emotionally closed off.
She moved across the room to go in front of a mirror, before going under the cape and disappearing from view, her giggles being the only indication of her location. Sirius and James were also laughing at her amusement, and turned hysterical when Harry began to be tackled and pushed around by his invisible sister, who he was defenseless from. It took a while before she finally settled and took out the cape.
Soon, when there were only a few presentes left, James nudged Harry with his elbow, and gave him a pointed look. Harry sighed, acknowledging his cue. He got a poorly wrapped, lanky gift from under the tree, and gave to Tessa. She just raised her eyebrows and looked from Harry to James, noticing the out of the ordinary exchange.

It was a September evening, and Bellatrix was teaching Draco how to play the piano, a fairly new hobby of them, while her husband was playing chess with Lucius Malfoy in front of the fireplace. After her and Draco dissolved in giggles over a little song they made, Bella conjured a few colorful butterflies to fly around the piano, leaving Draco open-mouthed as he admired them.
So, either way, it bothered Harry to now that there was a “JamesxSirius Situation”, and he didn’t like that he was being lied to, and that it was happening at all. In conclusion, he would keep it a secret, because he had no desire of thinking about it any longer.
Still in the garden, but in it’s ending portion, was a hexagonal hedge maze. With high walls and a large fountain in the middle, the maze also housed an endangered species of Fairy, that could mess with it’s visitors heads, making them get lost in it for days if they were in a bad mood. Narcissa assured Cygnus that the Fairies mostly kept to themselves, but avoided the maze all the same.
- edit: I altered the scene where Harry confronts Draco, to justify Harry's attitude a little bit better (I hope it was effective!)
Marcus seemed happy enough with the explanation – for now at least.
He was pleasant to work with, with precise charmswork and delicate hands, although refusing to outright touch any rogue substances that oozed during the de-fanging process. Draco also slowly relaxed his stance during the lesson – he started stiff and businesslike, but by the middle of the class turned to making jokes and funny faces. Hermione was aware that she would be annoyed about it if they weren’t ahead of the rest of the class in the assignment, but since they were, she allowed to laugh along with the boy, and to let her attention to slip enough to see how the rest of the students were doing.
The overall content of the letter, however, was vague. It was advised for Trelawney to reveal this information to whoever she saw fit – which Draco thought weird, but didn’t comment on it – and requested absolute discretion besides that. Since Draco would never go and reveal such important things to just anyone, he guessed that meant he shouldn’t say anything to Blaise and Pansy – a secrecy he could already feel weight down on his shoulders.
That was a very conceited, pretentious name.
“Come on Tessa, that’s not fair, you know it isn’t that simple”.
“I understand!” she took the cup from his hand forcefully “Stop yapping! I beg of you”.
She was waiting for Draco and Blaise at the edge of the Quidditch pitch. They wanted to watch the try outs for the new teams, and then they would meet her for dinner. Honestly, she didn’t see the point on watching a bunch of mediocre teenagers fumbling about on brooms, but at least her friends weren’t
“Shhh” Daniel interrupted him “Just let him do it”.
“What is it Drake?” Blaise looked around the halls, that were practically empty. “I’m not sure” Draco answered “But it’s nothing good” he continued walking, Pansy and Blaise in toll, past the loud Great Hall, and in the direction of the exit closer to the Forbidden Forest. “Yep, definitely something wrong” Draco slowed down as they got closer to the exit.
“How was detention?” Harry smiled up at him “Was Filch in a cheery mood?”
Blaise Zabini was actually very good at Herbology, he would probably be ahead of her and Draco if he wasn’t being so overzealous – or if he had any assistance from his partner. But Pansy Parkinson left him in favor of rotating between the attention of the other boys of the class – she would lounge and make conversation and be a bother, with her skirt shortened inappropriately and make up that a thirteen year old shouldn’t be using. Hermione wondered if Zabini wasn’t angry about being left to do work by himself, but she caught his exchange with Malfoy, of fond exasperated looks, rolled eyes and small smiles.
Miles should have known. Use simple rationalization and Flint was at a loss, but a weak appeal to as misplaced sense of pride...
Cygnus instructed Rodolphus to get her a strong calming drought, before going inside the Manor to find a wide eyed Lucius writhing his hands anxiously “Is she better?”
hurriedly.
“A bond to a familiar is a very deep connection, yeh see, your magical cores get mixed together, and yeh can always feel each other. But don’t be sad over it. Yeh see how much she likes you? Tha'’s rare too! Very particular creatures these are, and if she’s gettin’ close to yeh like tha’, it means she respects and admires yeh”.
She always knew that Lucius could be ingenuous and malleable, but the extent of how her husband got blind-sided and subservient was scary. Soon she found herself afraid to express her opinion in her own house, having to settle with exchanging heavy looks with Abraxas, who was thrown out of the inner circle after not being enthusiastic enough about the leadership distribution.
On his way there, he was quickly intercepted by a grey fuzzball with blue eyes, which had become quite common over the past couple of weeks. Harry didn’t even hesitate in picking the cat up (that he figured out was a little lady) and carrying her along. After their time together, he had realized that she was very demanding, very loud and attention seeking. He was charmed.
Pansy jumped and squealed, kicking Draco’s back. “Ouch!” he huffed, before turning, annoyed at the gray cat.

Draco liked to jump on a broom from time to time, and just enjoy the magnificent view – it was therapeutic. And, oh Merlin, therapeutic was just what he needed at the moment.
Draco thought. Dumbledore was known to be a very powerful
Before the crowd dissipated, the Ravenclaw seeker showed up in front of him. “That was a good catch Harry” she smiled at him from under her eyelashes “I hope I’m a bigger challenge next time” she waved him off before leaving, and Harry stared dumbly after her for a second - she really was pretty. He was blushing, but thankfully the team was still too distracted with their victory to notice. He made a mental note to ask around for her name later.
“What happened?” she asked.
“What made you change to Hogwarts, then?” Ron asked, genuinely curious. Malfoy seem to consider the question for a while, before answering.
The boy was sitting with the rest of his housemates, and wasn’t doing anything noticeable, really, just babbling about with Pansy, Blaise and Daphne – but every time he moved, his
that dared to come out of the water, the only sign of their previous existence being their dying screeches and putrid smell.
Miles had to agree.
He honestly considered letting it go by as 'internalized trauma', but he remembered all those times his sister called him
“Why you crying Tix?” Draco came down from the bench and ran to his hysterical aunt. “Not now dragon” she muttered in between tries to make the lighting spell work. “I got it auntie” Draco said, as he raised his hand and a sphere of bright light came out. He smiled at her while everyone else froze.
“I’m sorry headmaster, for the inconvenience, but Genevieve here was a little restless in the dorms, and I decided to accompany her in a stroll. I assure you it won’t happen again” Draco flashed a charming smile, that got him out of trouble many times before. He knew that Albus Dumbledore wouldn’t believe him, but maybe Draco could tire him out of prying.
She was at the Dining Hall of the Manor, for another one of those meals where she ate silently and let Lucius hold her hand from time to time above the table, when The Dark Lord directed the word to her. It was the first time that ever had hapenned, and her head shot up, incredulous.
“Did everyone
“Not sure of what Peter?” he answered cuttingly “You already betrayed your precious friends, now, simply finish. the. job. Pyrites here will help you, won’t you, Pyrites?” he signaled carelessly to a masked Death Eater that promptly bowed and proceeded to hastily pick up Pettigrew from the ground, where the man was still trembling in shock.
“I-I’m sorry” he giggled again “but you guys are so funny. You remind me of my best friends from Beauxbatons, they were always at each others throats too”.
“This is it”
Daniel and Oliver were the only reason why Harry was ever sad to go to Hogwarts, but he managed with the winter visits and summer vacation, and his friends were satisfied with teasing Harry about his posh private school and posh friends. Not that they didn't go to a posh school and weren't posh themselves - just look at their neighborhood. But the dynamic worked either way.
“Come on Harry, just tell me. Did something happen?” He didn’t respond, so she continued. “I know it’s nothing with your friends, you’re normal around them. And you’re also not butthurt about the Hufflepuff game anymore, it’s been a week and I heard you scheming with Fred and George about it. Is there something to do with Cho Chang? Because
Draco looked unfazed but Remus raised his eyebrows. “Alright. Why don’t you try the jinx Mr. Malfoy?”. “Very well, Sir.” he said, again with his indifferent expression. Malfoy did the wand movement perfectly, and only muttered the incantation. The large bubble formed around Harry instantly.
and Draco would be delighted to indulge him, but no – Harry just petted his owl a couple more times, gave her a treat, and turned to leave. He gave Draco a very stiff and slightly hostile nod and left without looking back.
“So, Draco, how lovely to see you at such a unconventional hour” the headmaster said, when he finished his work. His tone and demeanor were friendly, as if it was, indeed, lovely to find a student breaking curfew.
Draco knew how ancient Hogwarts was, but he was still overwhelmed. Ever since summer, when his parentes agreed to let him leave Beauxbatons for the Scottish school, all he did was research - needless to say he was very excited to finally be here.
When Draco re-emerged from the Pensieve, the boy had blood red eyes streaming with tears and a look of hopelessness. The room they were in sizzling with his magic.
“Sure Harry” Hermione closed and put away the book she was skimming through “Whatever you want to discuss, we’re here for you” she gave him a, understanding – and somehow knowing – look before kicking Ron in his shins. Ron jumped.
“Aren’t we talking about him? And you?” Hermione furrowed her brows in confusion.
Harry thought about what he just heard. The Blacks had kicked Sirius out when he was still studying at Hogwarts, so he ended up moving in with James's family. Associating the Blacks with the Malfoys...that made Harry despise the family even more. He tried to remember the woman that was with Draco the first time he saw him, but couldn’t quite recall her face. Right now though, looking at Sirius, he could maybe see a little resemblance with the Malfoy heir – piercing eyes, straight jawline, maybe even the way they walked? He wondered if Draco’s Mom also shared those traits.
“What is it” Tessa budged closer to look inside the box, gasping when she saw it “No way” she said – very original with her commentary, was his sister.
Harry chocked a scream as the animal opened it's mighty wings – and soon enough, they were gliding oven the Great Lake.

“Thank you Great Aunt Walburga, it’s nice to see you too” Draco smiled to the portrait that decorated the hall of the Black Family’s Ancestral Home. His mother had grown up here along with a big portion of the family, but now it’s only residents were his aunt, uncle and grandfather. It was the last week of the Christmas Break, and he was paying a visit to the old home.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” Draco almost fell off his broom with the booming voice of his aunt resonating through the grounds “Get your scrawny ass over here right this instant!”
It took about half an hour for Bellatrix to finish the whole basin, and in the bottom of it, rested a large gold locket, with a serpentine ‘S’ made of emeralds in it’s center.
“Dumbledore is not one either” Bellatrix added.

“And during a few classes. Like Potions”
The thought was amusing.
charms yet, and hoped the heat of the arguing would be distraction enough for them to analise the situation without being noticed.
The source of the voices was around the corner of the corridor they were in, overlapping and arguing without concern about being heard. One of them was clearly Malfoy’s.
“Yeah, you probably should” Draco kept smiling as the Hefflupuff went back to the castle. He met with his friend –

His train of thought was interrupted –

spell.
“Sorry. I guess I should be going...” he didn’t make a move to leave, though.
That being said, since Draco returned with the news, one of the things the trio were brain-storming on was how to protect her, worst comes to worst.
It was so difficult to argue with their ingrained Slytherin, high society, pureblood mentality. They’d already had this discussion multiple times – Miles was always able to shut it down, but they were more insistent every time.
He took a deep breath and dismissed his team, composed of three hand selected

As soon as the boy finished rolling up the parchment, Genevieve snatched it from his hands, safely trapping it in her mouth. She spared a second of reassuring eye contact before
“It was pretty good” Ron responded honestly.
It hurt Harry to think about this, but he couldn’t help it.
FYI: the prophecy is almost the same one from canon.
“Weird how?” Ron looked at his friend, who seemed to be really considering the subject.
After class, Ron and Harry had to bodily drag her away from Malfoy – she needed to know more! But the Slytherin’s inicial preening had already turned into annoyance, and he had been much too glad to run away from her.
It was a week after that last lesson, that Draco stopped in front of the door to his father’s study, as it opened up for him, even though no one was inside. He knew instantly that it was dark magic doing that - of the worst kind, the kind that didn’t just want to harm him, but wanted to make him suffer too. He knew he should call his parents, but his occlumency was just so
Miles, however, changed his aim in the last moment, and instead of hitting their defenses, his spell barreled towards Malfoy, who was closer to him and unprotected.
“Just because
“Oh, sorry”.
“But Tessa, it didn’t
“It really is scrawny, you ought to know” she shrugged.
Harry instinctively pulled out his wand and moved to the action, but Blaise held him back by his shoulder.
“No” he answered, sweetly.
for that strategy
After some time, James was ushering the people to the dining room, and Harry ate so much that he thought he might actually pass out. Everyone seemed pleased and excited, conversations flowing freely and laughter resonating in the room. After a couple hours, the adults were growing drunker and drunker - and that only made everything so much better. By the end of the night, Hagrid was snoring loudly in his seat and McGonagall and Augusta were arguing about Quidditch, rather enthusiastically. James, and Lupin were talking excitedly with Hannah’s and Hermione’s parents, while the house elfs tried to swiftly replace some of the half empty glasses of alcohol for water. Sirius was sharing tales of his last travel to a energetic Nymphadora and Ted, while Andromeda would occasionally shake her head disapprovingly. The evening reached an ending when the adults started to notice that the children were starting to fall asleep in their seats.
Pansy was soon overcome with a different type of admiration when she realized who was Draco’s latest crush and that it was actually
Draco scowled at her and went inside. He only had forty minutes to get ready, and refused to use cleaning spells as a replacement for showers – that was just barbaric.
Lucius exhaled and ran one of his hands through his long hair as he sat in a settee. He called an elf for a cup of tea before speaking.
Harry looked at the castle, that seemed small in the distance, and realized that this wasn’t bad at all. The Hippogriff huffed from under him, as if it took offence in his thoughts.
“No... We already went over the plan like, ten times-“
“You three dunderheads go for Amanda and me and Blaise can help Draco” Pansy inserted herself, sounding bossy and annoying even with rushed whispers.
in love with Mom if he is- you know, if he and Sirius...”
Everything exploded during Halloween night, when her worst fears came true. The night that his now thirteen-year-old son was watching on a Pensieve.
The creatures came forwards once again, and now she also felt their pull. They weren’t taking the breath out of her lungs, it was much worse than that. It was like they were bringing to light the worst emotions she ever felt in her life. She remembered when her uncle slapped her in the face for being insolent; when his dad called her useless once; the time she cried herself to sleep because her friends were ignoring her; the day she found a book about the history of the war, and stopped trusting the adults around her.
once again – it was so obvious that the man was a werewolf! Not that anyone except Draco knew, but whatever – and he was embarrassed. The class was cut short, so Draco didn’t even get to see what Potter’s biggest fear was.
Lucius was the only one that didn’t seize the moment to send a killing curse to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, that had stood in transfixed horror before the child. No, Lucius was instead freezed in silence, with tears running down his eyes, looking at his son, and feeling all those spaces in his soul that were before occupied by hate, being filled with only love.
He was smiling while talking to some Seventh Year Slytherins, blond hair ruffled and wide-eyed.
laughing at this expense made his blood boil, but he kept his cool, waiting for the Hippogriff to
“Hagriddd” Harry knocked loudly on his door, that opened up to Fang jumping enthusiastically, which didn’t make the lady cat very happy, Harry realized, as she hissed and squirmed in his arms.
“I’m sorry mommy” Draco cried with his head in her hair, she could feel his tears in her neck. The torches in the room flickering. “It’s okay dragon, shhh, it’s okay”. She looked at her sister “how did it happen?”. Bellatrix explained it with a shaky voice, about how he touched her wand and the spells he made later, and how she couldn’t do any now. She tried to do some to show her, but the result is was still the same.
“Good morning everybody” Remus smiled at the class “My name is Remus Lupin, and I’ll be your Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher this year. Now, I know this subject has a, uhm,
Blaise was particularly glad for Cedric.
“Oh, Harry!”
Remus was basically part of his family, being childhood friends with his dad and with his godfather. After a little insistence, he agreed to give Harry extra lessons during the summer, since it was his favorite subject, and now Harry was expecting to be top of the class. Remus would be a great teacher and the school was lucky to have him, but Harry knew that he had ulterior motives. His application was actually Harry’s dad, James’s idea, since Peter Pettigrew had escaped Azkaban at the beginning of the summer, and they both thought it would be better if the school had a competent defense teacher in case the Death Eater came by, and not some phony like Gilderoy Lockhart.
Everything was fine and easy for the family. Well – at least until Draco turned six.
Harry Potter and Ron Weasley ran through the halls trying to contain their laughter, stumbling over their own feet. They came to a halt with the distant sound of explosions, grinning madly at each other, before hearing the angry screams of one Argus Filch, witch just made them double over laughing, while still trying to be silent.
“Your aunt can help you with that son, but she needs her magic first” Lucius cut in when Bellatrix’s face scrunched up, and crouched down in front of his son next to his sister-in-law “can you give it back to her?”. Draco didn’t say anything, but the lights and butterflies that he had created disappeared, and the furniture stopped moving. The room suddenly very quiet and dark. Taking that as a cue, Bellatrix got up and tried muttering “
That's why he was surprised to wake up with a jolt, sweaty and breathless, in the middle of the night. Genevieve was in his bed, already awake and looking as uneasy as he felt. Draco got up and paced a little bit, before deciding to meditate and access the weird feeling that woke him up a little bit better. The cat matched her breathing with him, and Draco felt himself grow calm alongside her.
“Well, it wasn’t suppose to be. They should only patrol the edges of the property, and not even be seen by students. That’s why there wasn’t a oficial announcement about them to the public”.
. Abraxas and his wife definitely were, since they shared similar views to Narcissa, but weren’t quite as good as holding back their tongues. Bellatrix fell in a hysteric state, and Rodolphus was trying his best to take care of her. Narcissa’s father and the rest of the Black Family were difficult to read – she couldn’t tell how much of their conviction to The Dark Lord was genuine or out of self-preservation.
There were a lot of other peculiar things about Draco’s magic that his parents hadn’t noticed yet. How sensitive he was to magic in general, how it would seek him out, how passive he was to it. “It could be a great advantage, but also a huge weakness” Trelawney had said. She was always saying enigmatic things.

“Ohh, I see” he gave a Harry a conspiratorial look, who got confused really fast and turned to Hermione with a questioning side glance, but she had a rather condescending, if not amused, expression.
After Snape’s grim speech, he got to his new dormitory, which he was sharing with Blaise, Theodore Nott – who was also kind of a childhood friend -, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, both who seemed really dumb? Anyway, the dormitory was circular with large beds with curtains, and was big enough for the boys to spread their things around leisurely.  However, the dampness was starting to annoy him just a little, as he was starting to feel his hair curling in the back. Why the
“Didn’t I just tell you about my standing in Potions Studies?” he said, making her eye twitch again as she refilled the goblet.
Luckily, Draco was nonsensical as much as he was impressive, and their friendship soon stabilized. The trigger, this time, for Blaise and Pansy’s ‘admiration’ to tone down was Draco’s devotion to Cedric Diggory.
” Draco yawned. As he sat up, his cat slid from his chest to his lap, and hissed angrily at him. Draco held her face and hissed back.
“If you say so...” she did find the whole ‘Harry and Cho being kinda of a thing’ weird, because it came out of
“Genevieve” he smiled, like he found it funny.
“What do you mean? What does Malfoy has to do with anything?”
They had a short staring contest but soon enough she caved and offered her hand in a truce. Harry shook on it and they moved on with the conversation without exposing more of their childhood ‘events’. After a while Hermione pointed to the other side of the room, were Augusta Longbottom was still chatting the ears off of her parents “Who is that?” she asked. The girl had been excited to spend Christmas with Harry’s family, it was the first time she would be visiting a wizarding household, and had demanded a full tour upon arrival, asking waay too many questions that Harry barely knew how to respond, and almost had to be dragged away from the house elfs. She had been a little surprised when Hagrid arrived, spluttered as Remus came though, and completely inarticulate in the sight of McGonagall – “I didn’t know there would be
The image that greeted him downstairs was one that he saw every Christmas - mugs of hot chocolate and cookies piled up in the table, the fireplace lit up, a bunch of presents under the large and colorful tree. His Dad, godfather and sister in their pajamas, with messed up bed hair and big smiles – it was familiar, but it wasn’t comfort that Harry felt. His cheeks burned when he remembered the night before, and he felt out of place, knowing something he shouldn’t know.
, Harry remembered the name he read previously on the Map.
“Sybill, darling, I love you to pieces but if you don’t be quiet this instant I’ll rip my own head off” Draco whispered, through gritted teeth.
“Severus”. The man stopped. “If you walk out now, there will be consequences”. Snape turned around, a very poorly placed mask of indifference already slipping of his face. “My Lord, please, I only ask for her. You have my loyalty, be sure of it, but I must beg of you, spare her” his voice cracking at the end. For a moment, there was only silence from The Dark Lord, and then, almost imperceptible, a nod. It was enough for Snape to let out a shaky breath and bow deeply, before leaving the room with wide steps.
It took a while for Blaise to get used to it – well, he still wasn’t completely used to it. His mother wasn’t the most affectionate or available woman, and he never got too close to any of his temporary – and now deceased - ‘father figures’. So Draco’s unrestrained tenderness was off putting, at first, to say the least.
She drank it in silence, trying to ignore the smell of burned rotten flesh from around them.
The small furry animal came to a stop before Zabini, and it was Malfoy’s tired voice that came out when it opened it’s mouth.
“So it’s fine” he summed up.
‘Love’ especially, was a necessary word to explain Draco. The boy grew up showered in it, and had no qualms in distributing, expressing and requesting it.
Blaise Zabini made a show of rolling his eyes and huffing every time Pansy and Draco jumped up and down in the Slytherin stand, but both of his friends knew he was internally amused.
“Well, it
“My Lord, I’ve got it my Lord” he screeched. Across the room, she saw Severus Snape expression tremble; she knew what Peter Pettigrew being here meant for him, but she couldn’t make herself care - not after he brought that sodding prophecy here, not after she lost her baby and her womb because of it.
“You did”.
“Oh, we know a few” she took a sip of her tea “Rita Skeeter is a beetle”
“You didn’t join the House Team” James responded automatically. Harry cackled at her frown, and picked up the broom once Sirius released him.
Sorry this took so long... Please let me know if you see any mistakes!
Neither Ron nor Hermione were eager to approach the subject of Malfoy’s parents, so they redirected the conversation to the lesson. Ron was glad that Hermione insisted in coming to the great hall to study instead of the library, since, apparently, Malfoy took a more practical approach to the spells. After pestering them with weird directions about intent and state of mind, Ron was actually able to reproduce all the spells he was having trouble with, and Hermione was also happily babbling about how she never though about doing things that way.
around today?” he spoke with narrowed eyes. Genevieve just meowed.
He he threw himself at Sirius’s opened arms, thanking him, and his godfather hugged him so tight he felt his lungs get squeezed inside of his chest.
And maybe he was also trying to avoid Sirius’s encouraging words, always ready to motivate him after one failed operation. But this was the seventh time James went on a rampage after a false piece of information regarding Peter Pettigrew. Merlin, how James hated Peter.
The cat meowed languidly, before getting up and rubbing her side on Harry’s leg, all while looking at Draco, who seemed aggravated. Harry was also feeling a little insulted, he thought. “Do you know her?” he got up, cleaning the dirt from his trousers. The cat huffed and walked slowly towards Draco, that was looking at Harry like was really dumb.
“Really?” Sirius was brought back from his own thoughts on the matter “He is good looking then" he wiggled his eyebrows. Harry just huffed.
“Aand, the last one's for Harry” Sirius said, after a while of opening more gifts, and pulled a long rectangle box from under the tree, barely concealing the excitement from his face. Harry opened the box to find a unmistakable broom shaped wrap inside it.
After Trelawney passed out, Draco was stunned to silence. He wasn’t stupid – he knew that she had just uttered a prophecy. Not only was his Professor known for being prophetic, but Draco had felt the power behind her words - they felt inevitable.
“Is Ron in Hogsmead?” Tessa tuned back into the conversation.
She smiled, and held Lucius’s hand with her sweaty ones – he didn’t notice. She looked into his worried eyes and tried to see the man she fell in love with. It was difficult.
She jumped out of her thoughts with the feather light touch of Rodolphus’s hand on her own, and went to scowl at him for showing weakness, before accidentally meeting the stare of her Dark Lord, who was bubbling with anger while looking at her. She also noticed she was feeling a slight headache, that vanished when he broke the eye contact. Oh no.
“I’m telling you, that’s not normal” Ron’s voice made Harry jump. He sat down hurriedly besides Hermione and across from Ron. “What?” Harry asked. “I can’t even remember the last time I
Now here Draco was, waiting for Albus Dumbledore to finish shuffling some parchments, trying not to sweat through his pijamas. He didn’t even have a robe on, how embarrassing.
He leaned his back against the wall and slid to floor with closed eyes, cradling his hand, that was slowly bleeding from his knuckles.
She kept her back straight and expression bored as Death Eaters would come in and out from the ballroom of the Malfoy Manor, casual
“Hum” Sirius hummed “They kept the Black tradition”.

“How- How could I...I was one year old...” Draco gulped, sitting on the floor “The prophecy... Was
“Ronald, just let him speak!” Hermione shushed Ron. She had a eager look on her face.
“Uh, hullo” he said. The cat blinked. It had big blue eyes and fluffy grey fur, and it seemed to demand respect – that was why Harry stopped to talk to it. “Do you know Crookshanks? He is also a cat. Maybe you could be friends?”. Absolutely nothing. “Hum, okay. Well, it was nice to meet you, but now I’m gonna go eat, ok?” he waited as the cat quirked it’s head sideways, before meowing softly and getting up. The grey furball then proceeded to rub it’s side on Harry’s leg before continuing to make its way down the corridor.
Hermione, but now they owe me a favor! Do you have any idea how
“Yeah, I should probably leave now” Cedric flinched and slowly got up.
Bella didn’t respond – she already suspected it.
“So don’t get caught with it” Sirius added, with a toothy grin.
- Thank you for reading!
She felt the magic flow from her chest to her arm and then her wand, expelling a strong stream of back and blue flames that formed a protective ring of fire around the center of the island. She let it extend outwards, covering at least a mile of the surface of the lake, lighting the cavern in blue light and burning the
“I don’t know. The way he had such a intuitive approach to magic. I never heard anyone talk about it that way before”
When Remus directed them to the next lesson, Harry left hurriedly, Ron and Hermione on his toes. “Can you wait a second please?” Hermione said to them before taking a few strides to the opposite direction on the corridor, where the Slytherins were leaving to their next lesson. Harry’s wrist clenched when he saw Hermione approaching Malfoy, a slight blush to her cheeks. “What is she doing? Why is she talking to him?” Ron seemed to like the interaction as much as Harry did. They waited for Hermione to return before demanding a explanation.
“Well, you just needed to be gentle with it” Harry’s head snapped up with the cold voice of Draco Malfoy, who was holding his own book with only his bare hands, and it was showing no signs of trying to snap them off. “The book is almost a creature itself. I thought it was a good first lesson”.
“What?” Hermione shrieked “We are going to get in trouble! Ron, you just got back from detention! You want to get another one?” she stomped her foot, aggravated.
When Draco was born everything got so much scarier – she never loved anything so much in her life. She lost track of what was happening in the War and the people around her after that – her priorities had changed.
“Yeah, Malfoy. He hasn’t
Now she thought that the best strategy was to ‘bring your enemies closer’, and plastered on the least threatening smile she was able to produce, before asking him to be her partner. It wasn’t a really good strategy – she had very few classes with the slytherins – but she figured he at lest could give her some good tips on the ones they had.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Theresa rolled her eyes.
After some more bickering, they all made their way out of the castle to Care of Magical Creatures. Harry was able to sustain his good mood for about ten minutes, before he realized who they were sharing the class with. Harry’s deep sight got cut off by Hermione’s elbow in his stomach.
Before them, Miles still had his wand raised.
Upon closer inspection, he could also see rips in her clothes and various blood stains, fresh from the sharp Diamond thorns she was handling carelessly.
“What? No! I’m just going with my friends! We’re all going together! It has nothing to do with today’s date or anything... like that” he defeatedly looked down at his nails as he finished talking, inspecting them intently.
“Not you too!” Draco sat up, making Genevieve fall of his chest.
He pulled in a breath, as silently as possible, and forced himself to move back. He got out of the living room stepping as lightly as he could, then ran the rest of the way up to his room.
Draco meditated a lot, to help him feel the flow of magic. When he turned eight, he was taught occlumency, so he could be less vulnerable to the emotions around him.  He was taught how to access his own magic instead of taking what he felt around him, although that was easier, according to him.  He got a wand when he turned nine, because he already could do wandless magic without it, and should learn how to channel it properly. He also learned how to differentiate what magic was welcoming, from what was threatening – he always kind of
“Of course he is capable! As long as it adds to his dramatics!” Blaise Zabini also made his way trough the wave of students that entered the common room, grinning and giving Draco a bear hug. “Did you know he would be here?” Pansy questioned him, now scowling. “No, I didn’t dear” Blaise rolled his eyes .
Marcus and Amanda grinned, but but Miles inserted his concessions before they could get too excited.
“Uh, no?” Harry furrowed his brows “why?”
he tried to mutter, but he knew it wouldn’t work, his mind wasn’t in it. The room had gone cold and the creature was closer, and Draco couldn’t even remember what he was doing there.
“Did you know?” he sounded angry.
TW: mentions of homophobia and homophobic slurs
“How come I didn’t get one” Tessa pouted behind him.

“Our strategy” Amanda picked up where he left off “is to replace the Potion with a strong Sleeping Draught. Sleeping Draught is easy to make, but we need to disguise it as Wolfsbane - and
we need to be prepared to break down most of his protective spells by the time the moon rises, and that will also take time”
“What?!” Harry gasped “How?!”
“I think you two look alike, a little bit” Harry confided.
Marcus Flint got wide eyed and puffed up his chest
The prophecy was about Peter Pettigrew – that was just obvious – and although his parents never seemed particularly worried about the rogue convict, the man was not the interesting part of the prediction. No, no, Peter Pettigrew was absolutely
leaving his room to get a potion, or whatever.
It was before he started school that Draco learned all Trelawney had to teach about understanding and controlling his magic, and all he had to do ever since was practice. Now most of what she teaches him are things she can’t even do, but she knows enough theory about it to understand how it should work - like, how to detect defense wards and activate or enable them, change them or manipulate them, turn them into a curse or apply them to self defense. Besides these theoretical lessons, she would also teach him some advanced spells, that were always pretty fun to learn.
He was talking very quietly, with a childish voice, so she got closer to understand the mumbled words better.
“Nothing to do with her” he confirmed.
“Yes, do your worst” he wiggled his eyebrows, but she just ignored him, as always.
Harry thought, unsurprised. Something about him just screamed pureblood.
Draco watched as the older boy reached to pet her. First, offering his hand for the cat to smell and inspect. Once she was satisfied, he scratched softly behind her ear, and she purred loudly in approval.
we shouldn’t have included him. Consider yourself lucky that I already sent Flint on his way before you arrived”
He tightened the hold on his broom and zoomed away through the middle of the other players, dodging them with precision, until she was out of sight. She was good in a broom, but Harry grew up on his – there was no competition.
Harry’s father already knew Ron, having met his family previously, but it was his first time talking to Hermione. He heard she was friends with his son ever since the Troll incident, and seemed eager to finally talk to her, getting a twinkle in his eyes every time she rambled in the tone of voice that always made Ron roll his eyes and mutter under his breath.
Harry was suddenly glad for the darkness in which he was basked, being in a portion of the corridor not baring any windows or torches, otherwise they would have been immediately noticed.
The concerned look in Rodolphus’s eyes was enough to understand what type of reaction the news brought on Narcissa. It was a look that up until now had been reserved for Bella. Cygnus hurried though the floo.
“I have no flowers on my hair!” Draco screeched. He had made sure to get rid of all those little abominations. He started to shake his head from side to side profusely, messing up his hair, just to make sure.
Trelawney’s lessons always left him exhausted, so much that he always pulled his occlumency shields all the way up afterwards, because although it made him feel a little blindsided, he just couldn’t handle the sensory overload of the school afterwards.

Harry just cowered in his chair “Sorry sir, I don’t know”.
“And your school is supposed to be, like,
“I’m going to shower” he said to no one in particular, before putting his new broom in the shed, and heading back to the house.
Blaise smiled “I think he dropped that one after a couple of months, didn’t he?”

“Oh, and watching Cho wouldn’t be creepy?” Harry sulked.
“Yes. Rodolphus is getting her a calming drought. Tell me what prompted this.”
Draco decided to spare him of his misery.
So, today, he decided to talk about it. He made that decision just like always makes them – by impulse.
“Then, what are-“
“I need to talk about something” Harry started.
How long had this been happening for? Were they ever planning to tell anyone? Were they doing it while Lily was alive?
“It’s good to see you too, kiddo. Yeah I talked to her right after the game. Nice catch by the way, your Dad would be impressed”.
Harry got ready to use his old and overused excuse about Malfoy generally behaving way too suspiciously and needing to be kept on his toes, when Ron asked, with a mildly curious voice “Who is Amanda Nott?”
other students must have caught on. But I imagine any Hufflepuff would perish before considering a confrontational effort, and Gryffindors protect their own. I
“I see” Dumbledore’s eyes were twinkling under his half-moon shaped glasses, and Draco found the man’s emotions at the moment quite interesting. He was curious, but in a analytical type of way, like he was trying to assemble a difficult puzzle, and Draco was a hard to place piece. “Your Genevieve is a very special animal, indeed. You know, is very rare to see bonded Familiars nowadays” he pointed with his head towards the Phoenix in the other side of the office “Besides Fawkes here, I haven’t seen one in many years”.
Pansy once again broke into a murderous expression, but before her open mouth could utter a word, voices dragged though the Hall, and all of them were in the move again.
“He’s really pretty” Draco said, softly. Harry freezed before continued petting the owl “It’s a she, actually”, he said, without turning around. “Oh, sorry” Draco mumbled, “...my family has a few owls, mine is named Volturus, but I could only bring one pet, so he stayed at home” he was babbling, but Harry was giving him
This chapter turned out a lot more gloomy than I expected, but hopefully I can make the next one more fun
“Cedric?” Blaise whispered at her when they were out of view.
“I can’t tell
“What? But, Pettigrew-”
After that, the lesson went quite well, besides a few snickers and snide comments from the Slytherins, that were promptly met with defying Gryffindor glares. Overall, everyone was at least curious about the Hippogriffs (that was the name of the creatures), paying attention with various levels of amazement to fear of the beasts. Malfoy, Harry noticed, was squirming a little bit.
The small and rocky island was now surrounded by the skeletal grey figures that were climbing out of the lake’s tarnished water, the sheer amount of corpses only visible in the light of her fire spells, and otherwise concealed by the darkness of the giant cave they were in.
Ron just rolled his eyes, knowing he would absolutely keep bringing it up.
Draco was expecting a Dementor, but he wasn’t completely surprised about it. The Boggart wasn’t exactly
Draco rolled his eyes,
“And we’ll be there to help” Pansy added, smiling when Draco pulled her into a thankful hug. She winked at Blaise from over the blond’s shoulder.

Blaise didn’t know what had Draco more excited: Cedric’s adoring smile, or the power trip of having his whole house going along with his ideas.
And soon enough, stomping into the living room of the Potter State, were the Dursleys.
His feet brushed the ground below him when Harry pulled his broom upwards, but it was that momentum he saved that allowed him to finally close his hands around the Golden snitch.
Harry was admiring the big animal when Hagrid caught him by surprise, grabbing Harry under his armpits and lifting him on top of the animal, while babbling about Harry
“Very good Harry!” Remus said, and went to push and pull the surface of the bubble, that stretched but never broke “Very good indeed. Ten points to Griffyndor!” he beamed and turned to Draco, who was looking relaxed inside it. “Now Mr. Malfoy, how would you exit this predicament?” Draco, looked from Harry to Remus before raising his wand and muttering a spell that cut the bubble into hundreds of tiny peaces that slowly drifted to the ground around him.
“...and we want to add another ability for you to start working on. Now, I have to warn you, it’s a demanding and tiring process, so you’ll need to really apply yourself if you want to go through with it”.
Harry couldn’t get pass everything Malfoy represented, and he wasn’t actually trying to get past it either, not allowing himself to get back into that downwards spiral of confusing feelings, that always managed to bring up thoughts of his father and Sirius as well.
He raised his head and let the warm light wash over his face. He was feeling so comfortable in the soft grass, with his furry Familiar on his lap, that he decided to ditch his afternoon lessons – they were independent studies anyway – to take a nap under the Sun.
Later in the party, it was clear that the cheerfulness from the game accompanied the students. Blaise never saw Slytherins mingling with other houses quite so openly. And not even the grumpiest Gryffindors were able avoid such displays of ‘

Dementors weren’t really discussed, since basically all of them stay in Azkaban. But they are really dark and mysterious creatures, and there’s really just one way to defend yourself from them, and without it, nothing else is effective.

Hermione rolled her eyes.
She snickered as Harry jumped, startled – and almost cried from full belly laughter when he fell from the windowsill, after trying to turn around too fast, to see who was there behind him. His face went from worried to annoyed when he saw it was her – which just made everything funnier.
James let out a
“We have DADA and Herbology with the Slytherins, Charms and Transfiguration with Ravenclaw and Potions with Hufflepuff. Which electives are you taking?” Hermione asked. “Me and Harry will take Divination and Care of Magical creatures. Those are with Slytherin too” Ron announced, making Hermione frown “You picked those because they are the easiest ones, didn’t you?” they shrugged. “Harry! You know you need Ancient Runes for Auror training!” she yelped “And that is no way to choose subjects! I’m disappointed with you both!”.
Whatever was happening, Harry didn’t like it. By the sound of things, Malfoy was trying to stop it, so, if that meant helping Malfoy – well, it really was a exceptional circumstance.

Silence echoed between them again. They eventually hugged, letting their affection express what couldn’t be put into words.
again and again, with no success. “Draco please give it back to her” Lucius continued to plead with his son, even Rodolphus trying to coax the child, that was now crying silently.
The house elfs had deep cleaned the house and put up cheery Christmas decorations, and were now hiding. The family was wearing their fancy muggle clothes – the boys had flat-fronts and formal shirts; Tessa, a flowery dress – Sirius and Tessa had their hair neatly styled, trying to overcompensate for Harry and James’s untamable mess.
Cignus was in his home in Grimmauld Place, roaming through some old files, when Rodolphus came through the floo, looking flustered, and hastily explaining that was figured out that the necklace Bellatrix retrieved with Abraxas was not the original one.
“Where is the rest of your loyal followers?” Draco asked, noticing that there were no other Hufflepuffs in the vicinity, which was unusual, since Cedric was rarely seen without a large group of people – part of the reason Draco and the other boy didn’t have more of these alone moments.
how to do that, but it was important to label all the different types correctly, Trelawney had said, so he could differentiate what was magic that could help him, or protect him, or even harm him.
When he returned, hair wilder and face flushed, he pulled a chair to sit by his son’s bedside and asked them about what had happened, looking more receptive to childish recollections than most adults.
“I’m sorry dear, no taking things off the list. Quite the contrary” he looked back at his Mother, who was suddenly looking excited “Me and your aunt have been thinking...”
After the end of the War, some resemblance of normalcy returned to their lives, mostly prompted by Draco’s upbringing and the consequent sense of unity that it brought to the family. Most days, it was easy to ignore any darkness that loomed around the edges of their day-to-day life. Today, though, was no such day.
The Slytherins and Gryffndors were mashed up together in a line, and everyone took turns facing and dismissing the creature. So far, there had been some Dark creatures, some muggle lore, parents and even a few professors. When it was Pansy’s turn, who was a few people ahead of him in line, the Boggart turned into a mirrored image of herself.
But Harry was fine, and very cute, and actually smart. He was pretty advanced on the spell, and the jinx was a difficult one, Draco himself took a long time to understand it. Of course, his own relationship with magic was different from other wizards, and he was heavily trained to perfect it, so things came easy for him. Draco could

charm even before he got a proper wand. He was fascinated by James’s glimmering stag, even though he only knew the spell for it’s communication purpose. His father finally decided to teach it to him in the end of his second year, even though it was a tricky spell. It took Harry the whole summer to learn, but he got the hang of it after Remus’s help. Right now, he felt assured about knowing the incantation, since those creatures were roaming around.
a dementor. Remus shrugged his shoulders “I don’t get it either”.
“I heard he transferred from Beauxbatons” Hermione said, breaking his trance. “He is in our year, isn’t he?” Ron asked with his mouth full. “Ugh” Hermione grimaced, looking away from Ron “Yes, he is. His name is Draco Malfoy”. Harry turned to face his friends again.
They could both now see the grounds through the large archways, and Pansy pulled on the sleeve of Draco’s robes, trying to get him to stop, but he kept going, despite looking like he would pass out in any second. The corridor they were in was completely empty and dimly lit, and seemed unnaturally cold. By the time they reached the end of the hall, Pansy was shaking alongside Draco, and squinting trying to see outside, were the Sun had already set.
Ron splayed the Map on his lap, and used his elbow to poke Harry in the ribs playfully “So how is miss Chang doing tonight, hm?”
Therefore, he hadn’t discussed what he witnessed during the Holidays with anyone yet. Not his sister, not his best friends, not his hometown friends.

was a person. He found her hand and squeezed back.
“Thank you, Harry” she stood with the rest of the Ravenclaws, and Harry felt a little embarrassed when he notice how intensely her friends were staring him down.
There were plenty of little moments like that stashed away in his head – all of them resurfacing now.
– when Harry mounted the broom and sped away. And the broom was just –
And furthest away from the Manor, in the limits of the property, loomed a large and dense forest, supposedly filled with a variety of animals and magical creatures – as a child Draco would always babble about how a Hebridean Black dragon lived in a cave deep within the forest, but Cygnus never received a confirmation about said dragon from any other members of the family.
He got off his broom outside one of the Manor’s back entrances, next to Bellatrix, who was just cancelling her
“Sorry” he gasped, looking up to a group of girls in Ravenclaw embroidered uniforms, and then to the one student he had accidentally pushed over to the floor. He bent down to help her gather her books and parchments, and realized that the girl was none other than Cho Chang – the other house’s Seeker.

Ron and Hermione were close to the castle, Harry saw they arriving after practice ended, probably looking for him. He had let them know he would stay on the air for a little longer, so his friends decided to wait. Now they weren’t alone, though.

“No, that was me” Pansy admitted, while checking her manicured nails - this week they were silver with black and violet pansies.
“Looks like your stellar reflexes are limited to when you’re in a broom” she huffed, but smiled nonetheless.
“I just don’t think it is... worth it? Or the right thing for me?” he tried to justify himself.

, Blaise had said – came to talk about his spellwork. He normally would have refused, but she seemed really interested, and Draco loved how his voice sounded in eager ears, so he said he would help her – and of couse, if her friends happened to stop by, they would be welcomed too, Draco was generous like that.

As he turned around to follow Severus’s line of sight, James got hit with whatever spell Pyrites had been muttering, and was thrown to the ground. Snape didn’t spare him even a glance.
Either way, Miles never needed Flint to be smart, just malleable was more than enough for their mutualistic relationship – but at the moment, a few more functioning neurons would really be of help.
The Slytherins scowled, pulling out their own wands. Soon enough, all of them were in duelling stances, sizing each other up and considering how to proceed. Hermione, who seemed the most discontented with the situation, dragged in a big breath of air, most certainly to make a rational and conciliatory speech about how they could all help each other here, when a bright mist appeared from around the corner, making it’s way towards them, everyone abandoning thoughts of a duel to focus on what was coming. It took Harry a second before he recognized it as a
Tessa giggled and Harry gave a sheepish smile, thinking about the times he almost got caught with it.

Harry approached the animal cautiously, although the Hippogriff closest to him looked very bored and uninterested in him. He looked at Hagrid for guidance on what to do next, but the gamekeeper just nodded encouragingly. Harry faced the beast again and bowed down. And stayed bowed, stealing glances from time to time to the animal, but it was still gazing in the direction of the class, ignoring Harry completely.
“Peter!”, the Dark Lord’s voice cut through all the noise in the room, silencing it. Bellatrix raised her head just in time to see a short man make his way to his master’s feet.
Sirius said that she was more like Lilly.
, but at least her reaction was much better than Ginny’s. Maybe now her friend’s crush on Harry would fade away - Tessa hoped.
Draco was happy with the interaction. Genevieve’s blessing was usually harder to attain, and Cedric getting it so earnestly made him trustworthy in Draco’s eyes.
“I am more surprised that he – and I find it weird even saying this – is demanding
“Maybe he really should start a activity to put some meat in those bones” Lucius mused, moving to stand next to his wife.
Miles scowled.
the Situation.
“She belongs to me” he said, although he looked at her like he was regretting that at the moment. Harry took a moment to process that “She’s a Familiar” he said.
“Bellatrix that’s not-“ “Shut it Lucius!” she screamed at him, making him close his mouth and look pleadingly to Rodolphus, who had a helpless expression, not knowing the right thing to do either.
The Malfoy Forest was also known for harboring rare potions ingredients, - which made one of the steady side incomes for the family, whenever Potioneers bid them high prices for the precious and high quality components – and a few ancient plants. Before the forest, there was also a large lake, of deep blue waters and rumored to be so filled with creatures that Cygnus never dared get too close to it.
“Who is
The liquid was uncomfortable to swallow, but surprisingly tasteless.
Draco was nervous from all the stares for about a second, before a familiar black haired girl broke from the crowd, and jumped in his arms with wide eyes and a huge grin, “Draco? Oh, I can’t believe it!”. He hugged her tightly and twirled her round once, laughing “Hi Pans, how do you like the surprise?”. After he put her down she sized him up with a exaggerated pout “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! I honestly didn’t think you were capable of keeping secrets”.
Draco knew that they would like to keep discussing the matter even further, but he didn’t feel like having this conversation, so he shrugged dismissively and said “Well, it was nice talking to you children, but if you would excuse me, I have some other matters to attend - world domination and whatnot” without waiting for a goodbye, he started making his way back to the castle, but before he was inside, he turned to tell them, while walking backwards “And please, do put your friend on a leash next time!”.
attention” Blaise added.
Either way, Hermione had cornered the Slytherin and forcefully scheduled a study date for them, so here Ron was. Harry had refused to come, after throwing a temper tantrum about loyalty and whatnot – honestly, even Ron was tired of the whole rivalry/obsession that his best friend kept pushing.
And no one could see that there was something wrong with the boy. Even Harry’s friends were now defending him. They greeted each other and sometimes stopped to talk and laugh. Harry hated it. When Harry thought about how
There. Great. Solved.
“What?” he was still looking distractedly at the butterflies.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry looked around the corridor, but yes, he was alone. After having to come back to the Griffyndor Tower for his DADA book, everyone was already in the Great Hall. Which was where he was going to go too, but a cat just appeared in his way – Harry didn’t even notice until he almost stumbled on it – and it didn’t even flinch.
“Come on Hermione! Harry can take that next year, his dad said so. And focusing on the grades is totally justifiable!”. “Which electives are you taking, Hermione?” Harry added rapidly, before she had a chance to argue with Ron.
Now, Miles was no hypocrite. As a muggleborn, he was glad for the changes – façade or not.
The blond boy came out from behind the trees, seeming very tired and spent, with poorly concealed dark circles under his eyes, and his usually impeccably styled hair all messed up. He looked a little surprised to see Harry, but he recovered rapidly, standing a little straighter “Potter” he greeted him. Harry quickly shut his slack jaw.
it for him. As much as Harry wanted to defend Hagrid, it really wasn’t a good choice of book.
That became obvious after ten minutes of class. It was surprising, though, since all the other teachers seemed so taken with the boy. Draco wanted to like Snape for it, but he realized that he couldn’t, not when the anger was so misplaced.
After the revelations from Winter Break, the Malfoy Heir had been gloomy and severe, constantly worried and on edge. Pansy and Blaise did their best to smooth his edges, but the biggest results only appeared after Hufflepuff’s seeker jumped into scene.
“Mate. Really?” his expression was exasperated “I thought you stopped with this Malfoy thing”
“I know” Draco said “But at the time I didn’t know Potter was such a dimwit. I wanted to get close” he murmured, embarrassed. He crawled closer to where Pansy was sitting, with her back on the headboard, and put his head in her lap.
They sat in silence for a while before Harry talked again.
“And then” Flint seemed to have caught on – since that was the part of the plan he liked “We take him out of his room, let him turn, provoque him with some hexes, and let the Wolf loose” he grinned.
“See, this makes me think we need to go over the plan
Back at the corridor, while hurriedly making his way back to the dungeons, Draco thought that Albus Dumbledore was, indeed, a very dangerous man.
James asked if they would mind looking after Harry for a little while longer, since he needed to have a
Snape just raised his eyebrow and muttered “Typical” before turning back to the front of the room and kept on trying to fit as much werewolf knowledge as he could in one lesson. Draco’s eye twitched.
“What!” Harry was stunned. Dementors were the single creepiest things he ever heard of. He only knew about them because of his Dad. James sometimes needed to go to Azkaban for work, and even though he knew the defense spell to repel the creatures, he still returned home shaken and spent, just for being near them. And now those things were in Hogwarts? “Isn’t it dangerous for them to be near students?”
Draco laughed as Cedric pulled Harper by the arm for them to finally leave.
“When he’s walking the corridors?”
She stopped when she saw tears escaping her brother’s closed eyes.
But after the Winter Break, when Draco confided in them that he was the only wizard ever known to survive a Killing Curse, and one from Lord Voldemort nonetheless... They once again started seeing Draco with new admiring eyes, noticing in awe all the things that made him extraordinary. Which, didn’t really fit their friendship dynamic and was uncomfortable for everyone involved.
Harry huffed, a little insulted, but also a little embarrassed “I’m not going to run after him”. Remus took a sip of his tea, raising one eyebrow and looking unimpressed “I’m not!” Harry assured him. “So, I can’t go to Hogsmeade. What other 'extreme measures' were made?” he asked, trying to change the subject. It worked, since Remus squirmed a little in his chair, making Harry very curious.
It was the Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff match, and usually, a tough one for the Slytherins to attend - considering the infamous rivalry of their house with the Gryffindors, plus their reluctance to support anything Hufflepuff. In the years past, the Slytherins would be passive observers, silently cheering for whatever house that would advance their own standing in the Season.
“Although Harry was raised by Wizards, Ron, he went to a muggle school, and grew up with muggle children – therefore, muggle culture. In the muggle world, homosexuality is not easily accepted like in the Wizarding World, and-“
He was there for three hours!” Tessa screeched “Dad had to use a locating spell to find him!”
“Now, I want to be very clear with you Harry. Everyone is concerned about capturing Pettigrew and bringing him to justice,
“Were your Herbology classes in Beauxbatons same as ours?” Hermione asked Draco, after they filled their first jar with the white sharp teeth.
The next day was a misty one, especially for the middle of the afternoon, but Harry accepted the offer for a football game anyway. He felt specially urged to get out of the house when Tessa welcomed a bunch of giggling girls in. Luckily, he could always find a refuge in the other side of the street.
Harry stayed silent, using the shadows of the living room to remain concealed. He enjoyed seeing his father laugh so carelessly, a sight he missed after the last months of compulsively worrying about Peter Pettigrew.
Draco though about the ways he could possibly jump her, but in all honestly she wouldn’t hesitate to
He made his way down through the mostly empty castle. He would wait in the library and catch up in his homework before his next class.
The winter break runs on for close to two weeks, finishing in the New Year.
Before she finished the last steps to the top of the Tower, she pulled out the invisibility cloak from her robe and covered herself – because even though she was a Gryffindor, a sneaking opportunity between siblings should never be wasted.
“I think the teachers, mostly. You have very powerful, knowledgeable wizards here. Besides, this is where both my parents studied, so I was curious”
Lost in her own despair, she almost didn’t notice Draco’s. The boy was dealing with it worse than she was, sweating profusely and with silent tears streaming down his face. “I can’t block them out” he whispered with a strangled voice. Draco was very susceptible to outside influences, she remembered. She couldn’t imagine what he was feeling right now, if she already felt so awful as it was.
“Let’s go over everything one more time”
“No, they’ll stay here. It was a big discussion, and Dumbledore was not pleased. But the Minister and the Auror department assured him that the dementors will be reprimanded”.
Bellatrix Lestrange wiped the blood that slithered through her brow after blasting the
, so he was just inviting conversation, really.
“Oh no Harry, if she was bonded to yeh, yeh woul’ had figured that out already” Hagrid laughed as Harry deflated, feeling a little betrayed.
“Is this it?” It didn’t look like it guarded a severed piece of soul. But the others also didn’t.
“How much do you know about the Rosier family history?”
“Well, I guess he’s my cousin” Sirius said, simply.
All of this was complicated enough, so when the topic of
Eventually, they did drop it, but Harry was still on edge. It was not the first time that his friends thought something was wrong in regards to Harry. At this point, it’s surprising how they still treated him pretty normally. Harry remembered all the times his friends found some “weird object” in Harry’s house that someone forgot to conceal, or when Harry would babble about something he forgot didn’t exist in the muggle world, or when they questioned why he had a pet owl. Not even mentioning all the magic flares he had growing up, that he hoped they had forgotten about, but sometimes felt like they remembered all to well.
“Oh, yes, don’t worry about me” Draco gave Ron and Hermione one of his special shiny smiles, to make sure they wouldn’t get worked up over it.
There was no time like Christmas time – for Harry, at least. Enchanted snowflakes were falling from the ceiling, the whole house smelled like gingerbread and colored candles floated around aimlessly. He felt warm and fuzzy and content.
of not spilling the family’s secrets – and at least 10 months of the manor being under constant lightning storm, with random earthquakes and nasty curses flaring up the place – courtesy of Draco – but eventually, all the years of suppressed discontent and grudges from childhood expectations, meaningless traditions, bottled resentment and misunderstandings were brought to light, and the Black-Malfoys finally started to heal.
“Is there something wrong?” Pansy held his hand, concern written all over her face. Even Blaise had a frown.
“Yes” Hermione smiled. Ron didn’t seem to have followed the conversation.
“Oh, I’m quite certain” Bella mumbled through her long curls.
Draco went along with the subject diversion and quickly processed that Dumbledore knew about Genevieve, although he never told anyone – besides his closest friends and Harry Potter, for some reason – but it wasn’t very difficult to figure out, if one only paid attention. He looked over at the bird, and tried to seem more surprised than he felt – even for a Phoenix, the animal had a very strong magical aura, that was intertwined to Dumbledore’s. Therefore, Draco had already known.
Suddenly, Draco remembered that it was Valentine’s Day. He gave Cedric a side glace.
He demonstrated it, pouring the thick liquid into the irregular floor, and as it vanished slowly from the ground, the basin became once again full.
, Genevieve was suddenly sat on his chest.
“Oh, I’m sorry Potter. Are we friends?” Draco interrupted him, looking very irritated “Do I seem very eager to satisfy your curious little questions?” he rubbed a hand over his eyes, before picking the cat up with one hand under her chest and holding her by his side. Harry got mad because of the rudeness, but he could also see that the other boy was
”. The cat sat down besides Draco, looking at Harry with a matching expression as her supposed owner. Harry saw Malfoy’s eye twitch before he replied, sighting “She belongs to me, like I belong to her. It’s an even exchange. And she did, 'pick me', that is” he explained, making air quotes and everything.
“Father!” oh, the bitter betrayal.

His family killed The Dark Lord, after The Dark Lord had failed to kill
When the statue to his left spun open, Draco jumped up, only to pale right after.
Lucius cleaned his throat, and corrected his posture, waiting for an answer. Cygnus could see the worry seep through his rehearsed mannerisms.
“Well, don’t get gloomy on me now kid. What else is going on around here? Any girls you like? Or anyone giving you trouble? You mentioned someone in your last letter” Sirius poked Harry in his ribs, making him giggle.
Both got back to looking at Draco expectantly. He just sighted. “I suppose I can give it a try if...”
James landed the vehicle in a empty dirt road close to his suburb, and made his way slowly to the large four story state that was his childhood home. The gates opened for him and he parked in the large garage that also kept Sirius’s motorbike.
“Whot?” Hagrid looked around the class, noticing everyone had their books tied up or in cages “None of yeh could open it?” he looked disappointed. “Of course not” Theodore Nott sounded annoyed and smug at the same time “It almost bit my hand off. How d’you expect us to use it anyway?” Hagrid now looked almost embarrassed while the Slytherins, and even some Gryffindors were muttering in agreement.
Her intense purring combined with the warm sun-rays on his skin were enough to calm him down after the absolute humiliation of the flower-bomb letter.
“But he
“Why?” he asked, sitting up straight.
to be smart. Only, sometimes she forgot how big and complex the Wizarding World actually was.
Draco marched down the corridor, enduring the annoying birds that were flying around his head until he entered the Great Hall, where he stood silently, waiting for it’s occupants to notice him in the entrance – which happened fairly quickly, swarm of loud paper birds considered.
After a few moments, Ron tumbled through the Fat Lady portrait, his robes dusty and face set in a grimace.
“So, any of yeh can tell me wha’ these are?” Hagrid asked, looking expectantly at the students, but no one lifted their hand. Harry and Ron turned surprised at Hermione, as she never passed a chance to answer a question in class, even Hagrid was looking at the girl. But Hermione was facing the ground sheepishly “I couldn’t open the book”.
Cedric laughed.
After two days at the school, Hogwarts was just what Draco had expected, and he was pretty happy about it.
Draco conjured more butterflies and giggled delightedly to his father “look daddy, how pretty auntie Tix’s magic is” and then all the furniture started to dance.
- 'Everte Statum' is a spell Draco used in Canon during Second Year, for the Duelling Club. It basically just throws a person backwards.
that there are wild misconceptions” she finished her coffee like it was a shot and lifted her eyebrows at them “Should we get going?”
, he guessed,
The headmaster’s office was large, but full of weird and miscellaneous artifacts that overflowed of every surface and made piles on the ground,  the whole place pulsing with magical energy, enough to make Draco’s skin tingle - though he didn’t know if the magic came from all the random trinkets, the headmaster himself, or if it was just Hogwarts.
Thankfully, the incident happened when no other students were around, so they were able to keep it quiet, and no one else heard about it. Professor Lupin had appeared just in time to save the day. Draco was glad - he woke up in the hospital wing, with Blaise looking wide eyed while describing how scary it all was.
“No” his heart was pounding “Why would you even think that?”
“Okay, let’s do this again” he urged Flint to pay attention “Most werewolfs drink a Wolfsbane Potion every full moon, when they transform. They have to do that in order to maintain their rational minds and not hurt themselves while indoors. If they are outdoors for the full moon, it also helps to control their impulses so they don’t hurt anyone, or anything like that” Flint already looked distracted. Amanda gave Miles a empathetic look, and he tried to go over everything as simply as possible.
“So?” he raised his eyebrows at her “Any info on the outlaws?”
“Hum”. Harry didn’t really know how to respond. He was distracted for the rest of the conversation because of it. After he said his goodbyes and accepted a pocket full os rock-cakes, he promised to come back with Ron and Hermione.
“A Familiar?” Harry looked at the grey cat on his lap, who was also staring up at him, with her head quirked sideways “What does that really mean? I mean- how can you tell?”.
“That’s Harry Potter” Pansy answered, after following his gaze. “
It had been a small gathering, only for immediate family. Cygnus’s wife, Druella, was still alive, as was Abraxas’s, Alicia. They chatted amicably as Lucius and Narcissa led them though the beautiful gardens, to a new section concealed by a faint mist. The newlyweds gazed into each others eyes and held hands before Lucius waved his wand to reveal what would be their mark for the new era of the Malfoy's, and everyone gasped in wonder when their surroundings revealed hundreds of diamond Narcissus. The sunlight reflected off the delicate petals and created rainbow prisms all around – such beauty was hard to overcome, but the joyous smile that shined in Narcissa’s face in that moment did just that.
Before the feast, Draco went to the owlery to send a update to his parents. He knew they would be worried about how he was being treated, since the war affected Hogwarts much more than it affected Beauxbatons, but Draco was fine, no problem so far. Some people might had stared at him a bit crossly, but one icy glare was enough to make them look away – his mother would be proud. Overall, he would say the students were rather scared of him, not trying to hurt him.
The party was overall a success, only finishing once Professor Sprout recruited help from Peeves to disperse the students back to their Common Rooms. Before Blaise got into bed that night, he thought about how nice it would be if the students could be friendly like that all the time – but immediately shook his head and huffed in amusement,
- maybe is not even that big of a deal, and that’s why they didn’t tell us. Maybe it’s just starting”
Hagrid looked at her intently, and even tried to pet her, but she gave him a deadly look, se he backed down. “Lis’en Harry, I need to tell yeh, this is not jus’ a cat. She’s a Familiar” Hagrid said, excited.
Yes, it was difficult to find sympathy for the man. Draco could only muster pity.
They were very reluctant at first, but James always put in a lot of effort into making the experience as ordinary as possible for them, and now they were fairly acceptable of magic. They even enjoyed the visits a little, Harry suspected, as once Dudley confided that his parents always bragged about their rich relatives.

While he waited for his friends to come back from Hogsmead, Harry sat down by the lake, with his kitty friend still in tow, and thought about all the things he learned that day. The dementor thing still had him creeped out, although, he was reluctant to admit, it was assuring to know that there were measures in place for his safety. He was also sad to not be able to go Hogsmead. Part of him wanted to sneak out through one of the secret passages he had learned from the Marauders Map, but he knew how mad his father would be if he heard about it, so that impulse was easily denied. The whole Familiar thing also got him thinking – if the cat didn’t want to bond with him, what was she doing following him around like that? Up until this day, he had only ever heard about these animals in old stories, and now he had one glued to his side. Harry didn't really know what to think of that.
in Ravenclaw. She extended a friendly branch, and the boy had been mostly gracious about it.
“I hope you didn’t just burn down the boat” Abraxas remarked from behind her.
“What is happening here!” Narcissa Malfoy walked in the room alarmed, going towards Draco and pulling him away from her sister. “What is the meaning of this” she picked him up and hugged him tightly, looking between the three adults. “He stole my magic Cissa. I-I know it doesn’t make sense, but-but I just can’t...” Bellatrix panted. Narcissa looked from her hysterical sister to the men in the room, that looked helpless and struck.
“Nope, just a good old-fashioned
Harry jumped back before a barking laughter made him realize instantly that the man was, in fact, his Godfather - Sirius Black.
Still in a sleepy haze, Draco half groaned-half hummed, confused.
“Come on in Draco” he heard the serene voice of Albus Dumbledore call out to him.
Now, Petunia fawned over Harry and Tessa, pulling on their hair and cheeks, and brushing off invisible dust off their clothes “Look how big you both have gotten! They’re feeding you all too well in that mysterious school of yours!”. Vernon spoke with Sirius about what’s new in the economy, well, he spoke
“Yeah” he smiled and put a hand gingerly on the older boy’s arm.

“Very well Malfoy, as you wish” he got into a more traditional duelling stance “Everte Statum”
“That’s just because you can’t accept constructive criticism!”
Draco let go of her wand and outstretched his little hand - and suddenly the previously vanished butterflies were flying around again. Bellatrix straightened her back and looked incredulously to her nephew, 'that was

“We could ask you the same thing” Ron narrowed his eyes.

After a while, Draco arrived, changed from his Hufflepuff colors into a pastel pink fluffy cardigan, that made him get into an argument with Pansy about good fashion sense - Blaise was only able to distract them from it with spiked punch.
Draco slapped himself in the forehead “Of course! Cedric Diggory! I know who you are! You’re Hufflepuff’s
“Yes. You may try to act all composed and... and well mannered or whatever, but really, it's obvious”. Draco raised his eyebrows, unimpressed. “Ok Potter, let me know when you figure out my master plan, will you?” he finally dodged the menace and left.

“Now, I know this is a high request for Gryffindors, but let’s not make a scene” Blaise Zabini interjected, throwing a arm around Pansy’s shoulders and sounding calm and collected, and maybe a little annoyed “I’m sure all of us have urgent business to attend to.

Before Blaise could protest, Pansy pulled on his arm for them to keep on their way, and waved Draco away “Of course darling, we’ll be waiting for you. Have fun!”
As it turns out, students start their classes in Beauxbatons when they are ten. The school offers lighter and more dynamic classes, beginning with a general overview of magical theory, wandlore, and other magical manifestations. The first years get to go home at weekends, or after classes sometimes, and family visits are accepted. Also, a few times during term, they have organized field trips, through
He zoomed back to the Manor, remembering they were due to attend a Ministry party at seven. That was also a big part of the contingency plan his family was working on – building as many useful aliances as possible, with whatever time they had left. And these events were great for networking.

what’s most likely. So you need to understand Harry, your security is our top priority at the moment”.
“Do you know what it is?” Pansy asked Draco, trying to force herself to remain calm, and exchanged a worried look with Blaise. They both knew that Draco could feel things they didn’t, and although there was a lot they didn’t understand about how that worked, or what that meant, they

Only... that didn’t really work either.
“He’s the Head Auror’s son, and wants to be just like daddy dearest. Got in the Quidditch team in his first year, the youngest in like a century or whatever – he’s a seeker. Very polite, well-mannered, and flavorless in my opinion” Blaise cut in with a ready explanation “The boy has a nasty temper though. Oh, and see that girl? - brunette, besides the ginger?” he indicated the other end of the Griffyndor table “That’s Theresa, his sister. She’s absolutely just like him, kind of funny actually”. The girl lifted her head and made eye contact with Draco, before blushing furiously and looking away. “That’s the summary. I agree with Pansy, Drake, he’s pretty plain” Draco just hummed, thinking about it.

“Shut up Ron! If you are going to stay here you need to not be dramatic about it! Harry is being annoying enough for the both of you” she had a point, but Ron was not going to admit it. Instead, he rolled his eyes and stuck his tongue out, but stopped sighting all the same. He knew that she would kick him out if she got too bothered, especially since she had been waiting for weeks for this study session, and Ron was not about to let her spend time with Draco Malfoy by herself.

With concentration, Draco just felt a unspecific rush of agitated magic, he couldn't pin down where it came from or where it was going. The vibration was too faint for him to determine if it was Dark. Another peculiar thing was that he could also feel some emotion emanating from it... Joy? Maybe.
“Okay. Don’t freak out. But, they were kissing. I think they are together – like

so he and Harry could compete on a seekers game – not that there was much competition, at least, not with Harry on the Firebolt.
Draco was still shivering when he started to mutter energy and restoration spells to wake Trelawney up. He had left his wand in the dormitory, but that never stopped him before.
The Malfoys really were a powerful family – they might not be the oldest, but the impeccable way they managed themselves throughout the years made sure they held one of highest spots in the worldwide Wizarding Community.

Wide eyed, they stared at each other. Pyrites was the first to move, left to dissapparate and never be found. Snape was second, raising his wand to
Miles might not agree with prejudice against muggleborns, but he respected the Old Magic traditions.
When Draco’s parents told him that they had sensitive information to reveal to him during Christmas Break, he knew it would be serious. He mentally prepared for it. He expected some dirty secrets about their involvement in the War, maybe even some concealed-from-the-public facts about He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. And technically, that was what they told him. But, just... also... so much more.
“Oh, fuck off” Ron echoed Harry’s own thoughts at the audacity of the short girl, telling them what to do. The problem, though, was that Ron’s exasperation was louder than it should have been, and it echoed softly around the shadows. They five of them froze when a laugh broke the rhythm of the duel happening before them.
“What was that all about?” Pansy asked him.
“He tried. Multiple times. He was fascinated by the process, by the transformative magic, even by the aspect of a animal that represented your true-self. He often searched for validation through magical conquests, I noticed. But this one he never achieved”
“You might want to take a look at the Map first, Ron” she suggested, entertained.
“We’ll tell him once the plan is already mostly executed” he started, trying to find a way for the outcome be the same even if Malfoy tries to interfere.
So he walked calmly, with his back straight and chin up, making polite and insightful remarks only when it was required. Although he was pretty much drunk from all the magic round him, it was still not enough for him to be oblivious of the tension between his parents and the Hogwarts Headmaster and the other teacher. His father had explained that Draco’s family was not in the best terms with the school’s staff since the war, that was one of the reasons Draco was sent to Beauxbatons in the first place. But now that he was here, he was not going to let old grudges that had nothing to do with him get in his way, so he was extra charming and well behaved.
“Then, did something happen between you and Dad? Or you and Sirius?” He turned to the window again, so maybe she was getting warmer. “Was it during the Christmas Break?” she tried. He kept quiet, but his jaw locked tight.

He and his parentes received a quick tour of the grounds, and for the duration of it, all he wanted to do was squeak and run around – Draco was just so

For the rest of the night, they practiced spells and studied. Pansy showed them some accessories she received by owl that day, and proceeded to add animated spells to them - Draco brought her a pair of his socks, and she made little blue stitched dragons fly around on them. Blaise gushed to them about the new book he was reading, and also showed them a plant he had stolen from the Herbology greenhouse. Draco listened intently while petting Genevieve, who was purring ferociously. When Draco went to bed, he was satisfied with his day.
Harry was in the large windowsill of the main alcove, laying on his back, with his backpack supporting his head and knees folded up. His hair was the usual birdsnest, and he had his glasses on – of a thin rectangular dark silver frame. It was rare for him to wear them, since there was a potion that corrected eyesight temporarily. He always drank it growing up, and brought vials to school.
The rest of the day was great. He loved Transfiguration, and Potions was easy as always. Arithmancy was a little more challenging, but that’s where the fun is at. Instead of charms, he had private magical theory lessons with professor Sybill Trelawney. Since he had already exhausted both Hogwarts and Beauxbatons charms curriculum ages ago, he would get advanced private charms lessons with professor Flitwick every couple of weeks.
The two boys stared dumbly at each other with bright smiles for a few moments.
as he passed his aunt – who tripped him, a completely unjustified action.
Vernon, Petunia and their son Dudley were the only remaining relatives on Lily’s side of the family, and after her death, James made a point of keeping in touch - and that included a yearly dinner around the winter holidays.
By Harry’s side, Hermione’s breath hitched and she grabbed his sleeve. Harry followed her eyes to something he hadn’t noticed immediately in the scene before them. Lightly covered by the overall darkness of the hall, between Miles’s and Malfoy’s feet, was a large bundle of clothing. Only it was too large, shaped weirdly. Hermione’s reaction made sense when Harry noticed that

to the “will rise again” bit.
“Well, it was a pleasure talking to you, dear boy. I’ll keep a watch for the great things I’m sure you will accomplish” the old man smiled warmly, but Draco couldn’t help to see a warning in his words. The boy smiled sweetly and stood up to leave, glad that Dumbledore didn’t confront the fact of Draco being where he was in such a inappropriate time, and as he was about to thank the man for the conversation, he felt a very faint nudge on his
Malfoy himself was also surprising. Yes, he had a posh accent and arrogant posture, he would sometimes make snide comments and use too much sarcasm – but he was funny too, in a over the top way. Still, Ron felt like the blond boy was holding back, but much less than before. When they parted ways, Ron was also much more relaxed about how threatening Malfoy really was – yes, Hermione blushed and stuttered a few times, but with much less frequency as time went on; and the other boy seemed unfazed, not giving her any extra attention or inappropriate interest, which helped Ron like the boy much more.
“That’s Augusta Longbottom” Harry explained “Her son and his wife were Aurors and friends with Dad. They were hurt during the War, so now they have to live in St. Mungos, their minds... they were never the same” Hermione’s face was tinged with horror “They had a son, but he was killed – he would be about our age, now”. Harry didn’t want to add that he was almost killed for the same reasons as their son was. He didn’t know if Hermione had read about all those kids that died because they were born in July, but now it wasn’t the time for that conversation, especially since he would have to get into how he survived, and his Mom, and...
Before Draco was even three years old, the family realized that it was unlikely that anyone could stop Draco’s magic from manifesting, so they opted for the next best thing – get a hold of the emotional environment of the Manor. It was then that they started the infamous Black-Malfoy Therapy Sessions.
The large translucent bubble flickered before solidifying into place, glimmering a faint blue. Draco grinned at him from inside the bubble and Harry felt his insides squirm, before a hand drop on his shoulder.
But Harry was brought out of his glee by Hermione’s deathly glare.
“Yeah mate, whatever it is, we’re here” He gave a contorted smile.
When Blaise and Draco met her, the Sun was already setting, and they hurried back to the castle, since Draco was nagging them about needing to go to the library after the feast.
Did I...?” he croaked, incapable of finishing a sentence, and looked up at his family.
... Harry punched the wall beside him, the pain exploding in his hand and coursing though his arm.
“Oh fuck off” he got back into the alcove, sitting cross-legged “Talk about my reflexes after you make the team” he picked up the unbothered cat and sat it in the space between his folded legs, petting it aggressively.
By the time his next class started, he couldn’t even remember why he had been upset.
Professor Snape had taken over the Defense Against Dark Arts class for the day since Lupin had a “illness” that left him indisposed for a couple of days each month – to Draco, Remus Lupin being a werewolf was
“Well of course” he smirked when she deflated “But don’t beat yourself too much over it, Granger. As I said, we had more time due to the lack of practical lessons, and, you know” he shrugged “Beauxbatons starts earlier”.
It was now Draco’s turn to frown. What did Harry have against him? Ever since the school started two days ago Draco made a point to be accessible and nice, particularly to Harry, but he was only met with coldness.
Daniel and Oliver were Harry’s neighbors, and they were muggles. Harry had no problems blending in with muggles because he had a lot of experience being around them. Harry’s mum was muggleborn, and since she wasn’t around anymore, his dad wanted him and Tessa to experience the muggle world as much as they could, so they’d stay connected with her. Because of that, they grew up in a muggle neighborhood, with muggle friends, went to a muggle school, kept contact with the muggle side of the family, and visited muggle cities.

“Hello, are you ok?” the boy had a soft voice, and ran a hand through his brown curls as he spoke. Only then Draco noticed his own face was cold with tears, and felt a little silly.
Harry asked for his father to teach him the
“Hey, my bad” he smiled coyly.
And the other thing was, going into the “secrecy” line of questioning was great at keeping Harry from the other path of questions...
“How Gryffindorish of you, Mother” Draco croaked, wide eyed. It was all he managed to say
Blaise had another reason for being glad about Cedric - he was a great distraction for Draco.
When she learned she was a witch, Hermione though everything would change. And most things did. But she still had no friends. Kids still said mean things behind her back. She still felt like a pariah - alone and isolated. And she couldn’t blame it on the feeling of being
“You Slytherins act like everyone is plotting to discover and sell your secrets” he mumbled.
“Draco” Harry told him.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Harry thought.
There was a note inside it, seemingly from Regulus – Cygnus’s nephew and devoted Death Eater – but that hadn’t been the point of Rodolphus’s hurried floo visit. What he wanted was for Cygnus to check on Narcissa, who apparently didn’t cope very well with the new development.
She came closer to the basin - the liquid was now a sickly dark green, thick and opaque. Abraxas had stopped the incantation, and was silently doing wand movements to mix the potions further.
“They want me to organize the cheer for the next Slytherin’s games!” he smiled broadly.
When Narcissa Malfoy was sixteen, she performed the spell that permanently changed her hair from dark brown to silvery blond. It involved a tricky to brew potion, and her scalp remained tingly for days afterwards, but it was worth it. Lucius had proposed to her in the week prior, and he was nervous about their parent’s reaction to the whole ordeal, especially since they were both promised to different people.
Draco scrunched up his face in distaste of the name, making Cedric laugh once again, but still responded with a awkward reverence he did while still sitting in the alcove and said “Well, it’s your pleasure”
Harry finished unfolding the Map, letting it splayed completely open over the table, so they could see the entire castle all at once.

Three weeks after that, he met Professor Trelawney for the first time, and officially started his magical training.

“You mean-“
Other extremely amusing part of the match was the ire of one Harry Potter, who was red faced and muttering to himself. From time to time he would fly by the Slytherins to – and Blaise suspected, exclusively to, – scowl at Draco, who was always ready to make mocking faces for the further entertainment of his mates – and enraging of Potter.
“My magic Draco. Give it back to me”.

“I didn’t think he would actually try to hex you!” she added, Ron nodding along to her words “Yes mate” he contributed “I don’t know what has gotten into him!”.
He felt bad about dimming their excited looks, but he had learned about Animagi Theory, and he just wasn’t really interested.
He couldn’t believe it. It was that bloody
He made a point of being friends with the other boy early in his schooling. It was simple to do, offering Marcus a bit of tutoring and listening to his nonsensical musings from time to time. And although not enjoyable, it had been worth it. Flint was from a rich pureblood family, and he could easily provide contacts and status by association – all that Miles needed, being one of the few Slytherin muggleborns in the school. Not that he knew how few there actually were, since they all made a pretty good effort of hiding it.

times” Amanda Nott drawled from the other side of the table.
“Did you say ‘Malfoy’?” Harry asked, he had to be sure. “Yes, Malfoy. I heard some second years talking about him” Hermione answered, still throwing glances to the new boy. “A lot of girls talking about him” Ron mumbled as Hermione blushed. But Harry wasn’t really paying attention “Well, my dad told me a lot about the Malfoy’s” Harry started, and Ron and Hermione exchanged worried glances in front of him. “What?” he asked.
By the time it was Draco’s turn, the students were cheery again, but it wasn’t for long. A large Dementor materialized for the boy, whose mouth had gone dry.
One other thing she noticed was the boy-Potter. He was never extra friendly towards Slytherins before, but his reaction to Draco was particularly negative, to her surprise. She noticed that he would find excuses for them to snicker at each other through the halls, exchange glares during classes and sometimes even throw around insults. He also seemed to put Draco on edge, which was never good.

it to be Malfoy. Harry was fuming, he was about to enter the castle when a teasing voice made him turn around “Excuse you Potter. What got your knickers in a twist?” Malfoy looked unbothered, a teasing smirk tainting his otherwise emotionless face.

Harry rolled his eyes before going downstairs to the living room, where his Dad was throwing around last minute concealment charms, trying to make the house as muggle-looking as possible. Tessa was just lounging on the couch, reading a magazine, and Sirius scolded her to get up already.
“I don’t know how it happened, but you can be

tired, and decided to back off, very maturely.
“We can’t be sure of that” her sister rebuttaled.
“No way” he gaped from Sirius to his father, both had big smiles.
“Darling, we are ready to start” his Mother’s voice carried melodically through the corridor, and he gave the portrait an apologetic look before heading to the magically enlarged backyard.
“But I’m too
“I wanted to ask him about the spell. Remus was right, it
“A ferret?” Ron broke the silence after the message, with a breathy laugh.
“Okay” Harry let out a breath “Good.”
He was allowed to be out of bed despite the curfew, because of his extra classes during the night. At first he was worried that the Headmaster wasn’t going to allow him his extra lessons, but Dumbledore was understanding and seemed very curious about how Draco was so advanced and required tutors in so many different subjects that weren’t in the curriculum. With his eyes twinkling, he had asked for them to meet sometime for tea and talk about it, and Draco agreed promptly – after all, Dumbledore was a very famous wizard and the boy wanted to learn more about him. His parents weren’t so excited about the meeting, but Draco reassured them that he knew how to be discrete, and they allowed it. Now, he was only waiting for the Headmaster to make the appointment. Draco was aware, of course, that Dumbledore was a very important person and was very busy, and he wasn’t in a hurry either, but he was a impatient boy, so naturally he was counting the minutes everyday and –
“I’m doing better than Harry in the grades department” was Tessa’s amazing contribution, which earned her a kick in the shin. “I've been doing really good on the Quidditch Team, really saved us last game” Harry gave the adults a wide smile, and they promptly changed the topic of conversation, knowing that none of them were ready to have the “what is Quidditch” discussion.
“A man dating another man” Harry blurted out. Then blushed.
“Wait, I got it” Cedric was laughing again, but once Draco stopped moving to allow the other boy to touch his hair, he quieted down. Instead, he was looking at Draco with upmost attention. He reached up, and carefully threaded his fingers through Draco’s platinum hair, and pulled a little white flower from it. Cedric caught Draco’s grey eyes in his caramel ones before he looked away to place the rogue flower in between Genevieve’s ears, who hissed once more.
“That’s good” smiled again, and turned to continue to make her way though the castle, but Harry scrambled to his feet “Wait” he asked.
Ron really was a great lad.
“Uhh, with some, yes” Hermione said.

Harry sighed and looked away, to the empty courtyard outside the window.
“Because, you’re annoying” he said.
very impressive” she said, simply. “And what did he say?” Ron asked suspiciously.“I wanted him to teach me some things, and he agreed, he said we can meet sometime” Ron almost chocked before Hermione could finish speaking. “Oh stop it, you can come along” she said pointedly, but Harry wasn’t convinced.
Now, they were a trio again, and she couldn’t be happier. She realized how she missed Draco, with his obnoxious ways and dramatics. He settled in Hogwarts pretty well, she thought, although her and Blaise were worried at first. Draco always required a lot of extra attention, and people have different reactions to that.
When the game ended with whooping a 300 point advantage to Hufflepuff, the students invaded the pitch in commemoration. Going along with the crowd, Blaise would have missed how Potter stomped angrily back to the locker rooms if it weren’t for Pansy pointing it out for him while cackling.
“Wait! No, I didn’t
“What about it?” Ron seemed more confused than before.
“More mature than you” she laughed.
“Muggle Studies? You are muggleborn” Harry said, dumbly. “Well, I thought it would be enlightening to see what the magical world thinks of muggles. I just
They’ve been playing soccer in Oliver’s backyard for about one hour. And since there was only three of them, it was really Daniel and Harry competing for the ball while Oliver attended the goal. The boys were having fun, but since the cold air wasn’t forgiving, they decided to go back to the house.
magic. She was performing spells better than the kids that grew up with magic. But her colleagues weren’t impressed. They got worse, actually.
Draco always had a rather loud personality. It involved big displays, loud reactions, demands of attention and shameless demonstrations of love. It was entertaining, annoying and endearing all the same.
“And why would Snape try to expose him to the students?”
Harry came up to the archway to see that it was, in fact, his father and godfather, that were laughing silently over glasses of wine. He could see James sitting in the isle with a hand holding his wine up and the other supporting his weight behind his back. Sirius was standing in front of him, slightly shaking with laughter as he recalled the funny events of the evening. He was gesticulating broadly with his wine hand, almost spilling everywhere, and the other hand was holding James’s tight for support.
Either way, Narcissa got to Hogwarts knowing she had a unofficial marriage contract to a pureblood boy from Durmstrang.
“I mean” Harry continued, annoyed “you can’t just own her, right? She has to
“Hmm, why do you ask?” Draco couldn’t help but tease, smiling wickedly. Cedric actually scowled and pushed Draco’s shoulder lightly.

“Sure” Draco nodded, and watched Cedric sit with crossed legs and look over the view of the Great Lake.
“I’m okay, really. Nothing to worry about”
“What I
“Oh dear, no need to be shy now. Share the good news” He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named gave a dimmed smile with his expressionless eyes, and Narcissa held her breath, looking away. Lucius squeezed her hand over the table.
James picked up his bag from the back seat and made his way inside the large house. When he entered the living room, his childhood best friend was sitting on the couch, and looked up apprehensively at James, with wide eyes and careful expression. James shrugged, dropping his bag on the floor. Suddenly his throat felt tight, and he wasn’t sure he could utter a single word.
He let a cold stare wash over the now silent tables, lingering on anyone that was blushing or avoiding his eyes, before lifting up his wand, and letting the enchanted birds burst into flames around him.
“They’re here!!!”
That was one of the spells Harry practiced during break, and he already could make it physical. When it was time for them to try, Harry focused and pointed his wand to Malfoy, who was waiting patiently “
puzzled about Ravenclaws, they really should have this all figured out, but I guess applying academical knowledge to real life situations might be a little challenging for them”
He missed his best friends, Ella and Raphael, his teachers, his soft blue uniform (that was much more fashionable than these boring black robes), the dormitory, and the castle itself. He sighted loudly as he walked trough the dark and empty Hogwarts halls, making his way slowly towards the dungeons.
"What is his name?” Sirius added.
“Wait. Did you say
Abraxas nodded.
“That’s quite alright dear, ready to start?”

She took the smile as an indication of ‘good-mood’ and decided to start the heavier topics.
. The cover-up for Harry going to Hogwarts was that it was a
“She seems to be leading Malfoy towards them” Hermione noticed how they were moving away from the dungeons.
A tall, lean, platinum blonde and grey eyed boy was talking to them, bearing a charming smile and twirling his wand carelessly in his fingers. Harry got off his broom and felt irritation bubble in his stomach. It all got worse when the Slytherin boy met Harry’s eyes from a distance, and his smile disappeared from his face in a second, being replaced by cold indifference and boredom. Harry sped his pace, stomping his feet.
As soon as the whistle was blown and the players got in the air, Blaise saw Cedric scanning the Slytherin stand – now covered in black and yellow – until he found the head of silver white hair that was leading the chant.
“You’re lucky that I really like these robes” he huffed, adjusting his dark green vest, that had silver embroidery along the sewing lines. Bellatrix cackled but he ignored her, pretending to analyze the ongoing chess game.
It took seven different mind healers – each one under a
Narcissa felt alone and scared. Playing gullible housewife had been enough up until that moment, but when she found out about her pregnancy, she started making plans of running away. She could find Andromeda, or even her little cousin Sirius. But she never made it that far.
It was a very short list. Eight people in total. Some names he recognized, such as Professor McGonagall; Broderick Bode, who worked in the Department on Mysteries; Mafalda Hopkirk, another Ministry employee; and some other miscellaneous names. He also noticed James Potter, Head Auror and Harry’s father – his form was a Stag.
“Oh please. As if a need any more prestige”
was long gone, no one knew where to.
“Oh Harry, it’s just, we know the war was specially harsh on your family...” Hermione started, looking understanding “but remember that not everyone is like their parents”. “Yeah mate” Ron continued, looking a little apprehensive “and I heard that the Malfoys are one of the few families that tried to have a change of attitude since then”.
Blaise huffed as they turned back in the direction of the Great Hall.
“But you suspected?”
Ever since the man’s escape from Azkaban, James would wake up screaming from nightmares featuring Lily’s lifeless body laying on the ground. Not even the warm tea that Sirius would prepare for him after he got up was enough to put him back to sleep. Actually, lately the tea would only make it harder, making the desperation in the pit of his stomach mix up with guilt, the ever present guilt.
“Giving names after constellations”
Pansy didn’t know what those creatures were, she didn’t remember ever studying them or even hearing about them before - meaning, she had no idea what their intentions were. Just their presence was enough to make her freeze on her tracks and want to lay on the floor, fetal position, and cry for her Mum. So, when all three of them turned to Draco, her already twisted insides turned cold.
“Oh, how nice to finally see you. Not following dear
“BYE HARPER” Draco waved back.
Harry exchanged a glance with Ron and Hermione, before tailing the Slytherins. Hermione, bless her, casted a silencing charm on their feet to avoid creating any noise.
“Are the dementors being removed from the property now?” Harry wondered. He felt guilty that the students were hurt because of something that was here for him. He couldn’t imagine what must have been like for them. They probably didn’t even realize what was happening or how to defend themselves.
Flint seemed to consider all of this, but still wasn’t convinced.
“Talk about what?” he said, innocently, bating his eyelashes to the other boy, who just gave Draco a flat look.
“Miles. Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea” responded a female, hesitant and quieter than the others.
************************
“But, well, don’t you find it weird? The way he talked about the spells?”
On top of the constant worry for his family and friends, Draco was getting more lessons than ever before, perfecting his dueling and charmswork. His mother insisted that he also bettered his healing arts and potions. Plus, the physical training. As a result, Draco had little free time and was always exhausted. He started getting frequent headaches and was blocking more and more of his everyday sensory overload, to preserve his sanity.
“Huh?”
“Hum, I actually don’t disagree” Narcissa hummed, looking at Draco, who didn’t even say anything. Why bother at this point – his whole family was against him.
Harry was extremely content by the time they were practicing spells, he had practiced the Revulsion Jinx during the summer, and was one of the few students that had already mastered it during class, only needing a few tries to get it right, while Ron could barely make it work. He was about to ask Hermione to be her partner for the Ebublio Jinx when someone stopped by the side of his table, making him look up. Harry froze when he met eyes of molten silver.
she’d screeched. Draco had seemed pleased about that.
Later that night, Harry was laying in the common room’s couch, watching the Maradeurs Map in front of the lit fireplace, while Hermione buried her head in copious amounts of books in a armchair by his side. It was late enough that they were the only ones there, lulled by the cackling of the fire, with the harsh wind brushing the tower and occasionally entering through the open window.
“Last class he was charming the back of Snape’s robes to display obscene versions of the instructions” Blaise said, in case she had forgotten. He certainly didn’t.
When they backed away from each other, Harry laughed. “Ron would be so grossed out”.
“Well, you know why Remus is here right?” he asked, and she knew. Although the War was, in fact, long over, it left lasting damage. Their Dad going mad over Peter Pettigrew's escape ripped the band-aid off of the memory of their mother’s death. A lot of things were pretty much still the same, there was still prejudice against muggles, and many Death Eater families stood by Voldemort’s ideals.
The atmosphere was light again. It was the power of Talking, Crying and Hugging. Sirius taught them about it when they were growing up.
Cedric got closer to the window and signaled the other side of the alcove, that was pretty big “May I?”
“We actually had a problem with that yesterday, Dumbledore is furious” Remus started, hesitantly, before looking at Harry “Dementors were brought in from Azkaban to secure the grounds”.
, and they started a proper duel.
Draco thought of gentle ways to convey that he really wasn’t up for it, but it was difficult to go against his mother’s disappointed look. Luckily he didn’t need to say anything at the moment, because Bellatrix dropped a file in front of him. He raised one eyebrow.
“What did she want?”
instantly, dropping them in his professor’s private quarters.
Harry’s pained face echoed the hurt Tessa felt after saying that last sentence. She knew it was true, but it was difficult to say. It was like she was betraying her Mom – even though she didn’t have any memories of her, Tessa still loved her.
on the other hand...”
One way Draco’s endless affection would manifest through the years was in his unrestrained number of crushes. Cedric was the latest in a long list that included childhood friends, famous wizards, multiple Beauxbatons students, even one or another Ministry employee from random galas he attended. Even Blaise had been in the list – a dark period in their friendship history. Either way, Draco was no stranger to gushing, babbling, staring and daydreaming - watching him look less than dignified doing any of that was more than enough for Blaise and Pansy to get over whatever weird admiration had developed after Christmas.
Flint made a face, but didn’t give in.

, to finally belong.
He was finishing his meal, repressing a giggle after seeing that the white dove that had come into the Hall to deliver Potter a pink letter had shitted on his shoulder – good entertainment – when a school owl dropped an envelope in front of him. Draco and Pansy braced themselves for it to start singing or yelling, but it seemed like a ordinary envelope. Blaise even pointed out the good quality paper and the respectful wax seal – he was good at noticing that type of thing -, so Draco decided to open it.
“Have you figured out how you want them to pay it?” Harry asked, slightly ducking from one of Ron’s limbs.
He was tall and lean, pale skin and head held high, with glimmering white hair that fell on his forehead, just a little too long. The boy moved elegantly and effortlessly, making his strides towards the Slytherin table look somehow incredibly compelling.
“Cedric!” someone screeched from behind them, making the boy flinch. He sighted before turning to respond.
The answer was unsatisfactory, to say the least. No one knew the exact origin of the creatures, what they actually do, or how they do it. Their history is tied to Azkaban itself - rumored to be born out Dark Magic and the despair of it’s first residentes. They supposedly fed of happy memories and souls of wizards, leaving only the shells of what a person once was. It was all very depressing.
“Oh that’s no problem at all!” his Mother patted his cheek “We were planning for the lessons to happen in the summer either way!”
– Harry felt like he was about to cry.
“It varies from person to person, really, there weren’t any formal studies to determine a standard reaction – you see, this isn’t a very
Harry woke up to something weighting down on his chest. He froze, trying not to move. After a while of nothing happening, he slowly lifted his head up, squinting in the dark to try and make out what was on top of him.
Thank you for reading!!!
“Thanks Tessa!” he jumped down from the windowsill, quickly hugged her and ran down the steps of the Clock Tower excitedly, trying to catch up with his friends, she assumed. He seemed free as bird, like the emotional turmoil he had carried for months never had existed in the first place.
He laughed a little at that – although it sounded a bit pained, if Tessa strained her ears.
How are we feeling about this so far? Hope you liked it!
“Are you sure? I can get someone for you, if you’d like” the boy asked again. He was older than Draco, taller and with broader shoulders. Draco now recalled seeing him outside of school too, maybe in one of those excessive Galas his family frequented before, but still didn’t remember his name.
” he spoke bitterly, before taking a somber tone “I think it was the frustration. We’ve wasted so much time and resources to find it, but it was fruitless. And also because of Regulus – he was never found, so the prospect of figuring out what happened to the actual medallion is slim. She is just so worried, we all are. With Pettigrew’s escape, and Trelawney’s Prophecy – it seems like something big is about to happen”
After multiple students flinched, and a first year Hufflepuff cried, Draco was satisfied to make his way to the Slytherin table for lunch. He squeezed himself in between Pansy and Blaise, that were once again snickering.
“You are very mature. You know that?” he said into her dark hair.
It was the last week before Christmas break, and Harry was ready to go home. He loved Hogwarts, he really did, but he just wanted to get away for a while.
“How do you know so much about this potion?” she asked, to distract herself.
, her own father gave her charged looks and dubious sayings, and after The Dark Lord cut the unborn child off her sister’s belly, Bellatrix’s whole demeanor changed.

“Don’t be an idiot. We need a plan”
“Shhhh, keep your voice down. I’m being serious” he sighted before trying to explain everything to Marcus once again “Think about it. Snape has been dropping hints nonstop. I heard that he’s been giving the same lecture about werewolfs to every year. The last Defense professors were so incompetent with the curriculum that he can get away with it”
“Harry, right?” Draco Malfoy asked with a half smile. “Ugh, yes” Harry answer dumbly, his voice cracking, he noticed the students were suddenly quieter and cursed internally when he felt a blush starting to creep up his face. “My name’s Draco”
He didn’t

“It’s fine. I’m fine” he mumbled before leaving the Gryffindor Tower “Talk to you guys later”. And he
Maybe it’s just a coincidence, he thought, if he power walked really silently he could...
“Ok” Cedric smiled softly, looking more relaxed.
It was the Saturday after the Quidditch tryouts, and the first weekend where the third years would be allowed to go to Hogsmeade, and Harry was really excited about visiting the village with his friends. But when he presented his authorization form to Filch, the caretaker stubbornly denied him, and before Harry could find a way around it, Remus was already behind him, with a hand on his shoulder, asking him to have a talk.
“Ron, you’re scaring him” Hermione laughed.
Well, the turmoil in his stomach was back and he definitely didn’t want to deal with it.
“His mother is a Black, and she was my cousin” he shrugged “We were actually quite close when we were kids, but she has always been a good pureblood through and through. She sent me a couple letters a few years after the War ended, actually”.
“I didn’t know you had a cat” Cedric’s spoke, after Genevieve’s hiss broke the tension that had built up in the air – the ungrateful feline.
“So? What are you doing here? It’s been after curfew for a few hours already”
Malfoy? Did Hermione really think that Harry was asking those things in relation to Malfoy? Does she... does she think Malfoy likes boys? Or that Harry liked... him? No, they fought all the time, that didn’t make sense. Or... maybe it did?
After what The Dark Lord’s old diary did to Draco all those years ago, they’ve all been extremely cautious with the handling of such tainted artifacts, therefore, had placed the heirloom in intricate contingency spells and had been doing a multitude of tests ever since – but to no avail, since it showed no indication of even being touched by black magic.
“Well” Hermione closed the book she was currently skimming through and came to sit by Harry’s other side “I clearly remember telling you that taking the guilt for them would be-“
“So, she asked Malfoy if he has a girlfriend or not” Harry started, he didn’t know why he brought it up, but he just really wanted to talk about it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Lucius was used to hate, he thought. He grew up hating muggles and their filthy ways, hating ignorant wizards and witches that wouldn't make an effort to understand and better their society, hating those too lazy to better their standing – honestly, he lost count of it over the years.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Sirius and Tessa usually played as beaters, so they were aiming bludgers at the two seekers - to spice up the game – and sometimes at each other – because Tessa was really prone to violence, apparently.
It was like she only ever felt bad things her whole life. Even if she tried to find something good, something happy – she just couldn’t, there was nothing there. She registered Draco’s body falling to the ground behind her, but she couldn’t be bothered to just turn and look.
“Now, these are very proud animals. Easily offended. Yeh walk up to them and bow, and yeh wait. Let them make the firs’ move. If I tell yeh to go back, yeh go back, ‘cause tha’ beak is no joke”.
“We are going to have a baby”
Away from the garden, by the West Wing of the Manor, laid a Weeping Willow – one out of five created by an Ethiopian herbologist in the XIV century. The other four semi-sentient trees were scattered around the globe – the most noticeable one being in Hogwarts. Differently from it’s untamable sibling, however, this one was loyal to the Malfoy Family, being able to sense their allies and enemies, and respond accordingly.
At the time, they all thought it meant that the
“I cannot believe the degree of sheer stupidity that went into orchestrating such a disgusting display of ignorance!” Harry was surprised to hear the nasty tone being use on someone other them himself.
“You seem upset though” she couldn’t help but add. Because it was truth.
If one was to question Draco’s sudden interest in Hufflepuffs’s success, it would be justified in his desire to see Harry Potter loose – their antagonistic relationship a source of gossip and entertainment in the school. To support this narrative, there were even a few lines in the Slytherin’s chant that involved the raven haired boy falling off his broom and being eaten by wild Hippogriffs.
, takes weeks.
The headmaster hummed along while Draco raised his eyebrows at the bird, but again, didn’t seem very impressed with the boy’s feign surprise. “Professor Flitwick tells me you’re having great progress with your private lessons”.
, Miles reminded himself.
“Hey, anything interesting going on tonight?” Ron inquired them, after a moment of amused silence.
Already feeling much better after his little walk, Harry was about to make himself noticed and get his water, when his eyes almost popped out of his face.
His face was still bored, and his demeanor was indifferent, but Hagrid let out a relieved laugh “Tha’s right! Five points to Slytherin for figurin’ it ou’! Yeh’re suppose to pet it!”. The Slytherins still looked skeptical, but they tried it with the rest of the students anyway, and soon enough, everyone had their books open.
