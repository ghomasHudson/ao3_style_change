"Ohh~ am I angering you, golden boy? I didn't know you were so sensitive. Maybe you shouldn't be in Quidditch, considering you aren't much of a fighter." He goaded continuously on purpose and Harry gritted his teeth in anger. He had let out a small scoff and glowered at Draco. "I bet you can't even fight Malfoy. I think we both know who the fighter is between the two of us." Draco's smirk almost fell, but he retained it and crossed his arms.
Potters' eyes flickered between Draco's lips and eyes before softly kissing his lips. Potter was quite enjoying the reaction he got out of Draco and gripped his hips tighter but kissed him even softer.
He doesn't mind the crushes on him. But he's when they get too descriptive. He doesn't want to hear their fantasies about him in bed. Or their nasty wet dreams. It's quite embarrassing.
The two boys continued to walk a few minutes more but then a groan was heard by Draco. Harry raised a brow at him and looked at him annoyedly. "What is it this time?" The sarcastic tone had Draco on the edge of snapping at him but he holds it back for later. "We are going nowhere! We probably aren't even going north!" Draco fully stops and looks to be refusing to move another step. Harry rolls his eyes and shrugs. "So? What do you want me to do about it?" Draco narrowed his eyes at the raven and sneered.
"Stop it, the both of you! You both have gotten in trouble for the same thing as last year. Have you not learned your lesson?" She asked and both boys stood quietly. She nods her head in realization. "Okay, I know exactly how to handle this." She raises a brow at Draco who looks to be unsteady.
He stands at close eye level with him and starts straight into his grey eyes. "You don't feel anything? Tell me that with your own words then." Draco once again became paralyzed when Harry grabbed his hand.
"The worst punishment I've ever received was my broom and wand being taken away from me." That didn't even sound right, even for Harry who thought he must've not been punished that badly, but even he could tell that didn't sound truthful, however, he let it go. Harry wasn't stupid when it came to abuse and deflection, and Draco was undoubtedly deflecting the truth. It could be heard by his tone of voice and his facial expressions. They weren't genuine. If Harry hadn't known better, he'd say something probably happened at home much worse than just taking away his broom and wand for a week or two. The boys continued on walking in silence until Draco spoke up.
Does this mean Draco likes Potter? Were his observations correct? The chance of Draco liking Potter was becoming higher and higher the longer Harry observed his actions and body language.
Harry didn't even have to look twice before dropping the map and running out the door. Maybe if he ran fast enough, he could catch up with the little Malfoy heir. He heard soft footsteps close to him and stopped.
But Harry's not surprised, he could tell from a mile away that he's not fit for sports and doesn't like it. He could imagine his father making him do it. That wouldn't be too far from the truth either. He scoots closer to Draco and hugs him. The first thing Draco does is try to get out of his hold. "What are you doing?!" Draco yelled but Harry's hold tightened on him. "I'm keeping you warm since you only have these thin shorts on. And body heat helps when in cold weather like this." Harry says and pulls Draco closer by the waist. Draco wanted to push him away again but the warmth Harry was giving him was honestly way better than the sweatshirt. So he moved himself a little closer to Harry and snuggled up against him.
Harry narrowed his eyes in confusion at Draco's reaction toward his girlfriend when he found that he looked quite annoyed. He looked as if he didn't want to be there at that moment.
"I did not!" Draco stomped his foot on the ground and became very determined to prove Harry wrong. He did not enjoy it. Not one bit. Or did he? "Oh really?" Harry asks and struts over to Malfoy with a smirk.
At 10 pm, Harry's mind was racing 100 miles per hour, and his hands rapidly began to clam up. How would he find Draco? He couldn't just ask to talk to him privately during the daytime.
"And who are you to make such accusations?!" Draco furrowed his brows and crossed his arms. "I do not remember asking for your opinion." Draco snarled and rolled his eyes at the boy.
Draco looked up at Harry with his pretty silver eyes and gripped Harry's arm. Harry looked down and Draco swears his eyes sparkled when their eyes met. Harry's hand pressed against Draco's cheek and kept his other arm around his waist. Draco blushed deeply and felt his heart accelerate by the intense soft look Harry was giving him. Harry saw the scarlet blush that scattered cutely across Draco's two cheeks and his small nose. Everything about Draco just made him want to kiss him now. He didn't know why he was suddenly feeling like this, but all these feelings at once were too much.
Harry took a deep breath and fixed his posture. He pushed up his glasses and moved his neck around to release any tension. Because he was about to do some sussy baka shit.üòè (A/N: I'm kidding peeps.)
"Anyway, see you around Malfoy." Potter was quickly out of Draco's sight and returned to his room with the biggest smile he's ever had. He kissed Malfoy, and he absolutely loved it. His lips were so soft.
However he had to admit, Draco didn't seem that into it if he was being honest. Now he didn't know if this was his jealousy talking or his inner observer self, but he just has a feeling that Draco didn't like Pansy.
Harry eyed the thin clothing hugged around the blonde and sighed. He was overheating in that sweatshirt anyway. He slipped off the sweatshirt and threw it to Draco who caught it immediately. He slipped on the sweatshirt that surprisingly was a bit oversized and hugged himself. His legs were still freezing though. "I bet you'd hate telling me about your worst punishment given by your parents." Draco grimaced at that bet but tried to remain cold. "I uh.. this bet is stupid." Harry scoffs and turns to the blonde.
"No your dating her because you don't want anyone to know you fancy me," Harry says with zero hesitation. Now, this was the risky part, but he just had to follow through. No matter what Draco's insults were.
Harry thought it was weird, but kind of cute. It was cute if the reason behind all his tenseness was because Harry was staring at him. Harry wouldn't have taken Draco for the shy type but he's proving him otherwise.
Basically called him attractive! Harry then had an idea. What if he confronted Draco about it? Of course, he wouldn't admit he liked Potter, but what if he made a bold move and tested if Draco really liked him.
source of light?! We don't have any light!" He yells. "She's talking about the moonlight Malfoy." Harry seethed with crossed arms.
He crossed his arms and leaned against a tree, looking up at the night sky in frustration. His eyes traced all of the stars that shined so brightly and noticed how they made an irregular shape. Something clicks in Draco and he leans off the tree with uncrossed arms. "Wait I think I know how to get north.." Harry looks at him in confusion but decides to listen. "The stars are a source of navigation! We can use them to lead us north!" Harry confusingly looks up at the stars but only sees a bunch of stars in weird shapes. Nothing unusual.
"So you and Parkinson aren't a thing?" Harry asked and Draco looked disgusted with the question. "Ew no! Who gave you that idea?!" Harry shrugged as Draco continued to gag. "Just some rumors were spreading about how you and Parkinson were boyfriend and girlfriend," Draco grumbled and shook and his head. "Well, we're not! I don't even like g-" Draco had stopped himself from saying something that he would definitely regret later. The words came out so fast in response that he didn't even realize what he was saying.
Harry just couldn't believe he even got the chance to do that. And he wanted to do it again, but he wanted to talk to Malfoy before that happened, so maybe he could get more of a reaction out of him.
"Hello, Malfoy.." Potter greeted with a faint smile. Draco froze and didn't know if he should play along or degrade him. He decided to play along though. "Hello, Potter." Draco shortly said.
In fact, he would be elated if that was the reason, considering he did have a crush on the blonde-haired boy. He just knew how to hide and express it better than the pure-blood did.
But if he was correct, and his crush fancies him, he will definitely be forcing Draco to talk about it with him. Harry won't just let it go just because Draco is too much of a coward to fess up.
Draco puts his finger on his chin as if deciding whether he wants to teach him or not. But he shrugs and nods. "Okay, copy my exact words." Harry nods and listens closely, walking a little closer to Draco. "Je.. m'appelle... Harry Potter.. got that?" Harry blinked at Draco and shook his head. "Say it again, I forgot what you said." Draco rolled his eyes and turned to him. "Je." Draco waits for Potter to say it too. "Je." Harry says a little uncertainly. "M'appelle." Potter was quickly behind him on the words. "M'appelle." Draco nods and glances at Harry.
Harry suddenly detached his lips and smiled when he realized Draco did not fight back at all. He didn't kiss back but he also wasn't fighting it. So maybe, just maybe... he liked it?
Harry pondered about it while he was in class, and thought it made sense. What if Draco was just dating Pansy to impress him? Would it be that far from the truth?
(A/N: Harry's healthy in this one shot and he's the same height as Draco. He obviously would have grown a few inches if he actually was healthy and wasn't malnourished. So I believe them being the same height is accurate since Potter could never maintain proper sleep or a healthy diet a growing boy needs to grow properly in the books and movies.)
Draco's head laid on Harry's chest, and everything seemed to disappear as the only thing he could hear was Harry's heartbeat. It was slow and weirdly soothing. Draco wouldn't mind staying like this, but that would also be embarrassing. Draco's scent was very addicting, and Harry really tried to not sniff it too much, but how could he not when the blonde boy was so close to him. He smelled like the scent vanilla Carmel latte.
Harry had just noticed he had really pretty lips, they were naturally always a red-ish pink color and never were dry or chapped. They looked really soft. Harry really liked Dracos smile, it was one of those smiles that just made your heart hurt, but in the best way possible. But his smile vanished just as quick as it had come and was replaced with a frown that Harry had not missed at all.
"Have you?" Draco asks with a raised brow as he scans Harry's face. His features were illuminated by the moonlight and quite frankly, Draco found it hypnotizing seeing Harry's already bright emerald eyes glow even more. It looked magical to Draco. "Umm no.." Harry replies and turns to Draco who turned away when Harry's eyes met his. Draco's eyes no longer looked grey but looked like a glittery silver. A color that mimicked the moon.
But he hadn't felt cold at all because he was fully covered. The seasons were nearing winter and it was pretty chilly and not very warm or breezeless. Draco however was starting to really feel the cold, considering he always got cold very easily and hated it. He didn't expect to get caught by McGonagall again so he didn't bother to change his clothing into something more protective. His clothing was very thin and breathable, which did work against him at this very moment.
Harry noticed the sudden stop in Draco's words and pulled him closer. "You gonna tell me?" Harry teased and Draco turned his head to the side and glared at the floor. Harry's face was pretty close to his own.
He had some evidence to back it up but he wanted proof. Once class was over he and his friends chatted while walking towards their next destination. But their conversation ended when he bumped into someone.
This has Harry thinking, he has never seen Draco genuinely smile before. And as weird as it sounds, he would like to experience it once in his life. Preferably now. "I bet you can't smile," Harry says and is itching to smirk at how sly he was. "Of course I can." Draco disagreed but made no move to actually prove it. "Then smile!" Harry was waiting as he saw Draco groan loudly and roll his eyes, but eventually faced him and smiled. His smile was sweet and pretty, especially because he had such straight teeth. Harry wondered if he'd had braces before because of how straight they were.
Draco wondered if that could have helped him, too. He mentally noted to ask for Hermione's help, Malfoy Pride be damned.
He remembered how he and Ginny had had long discussions about how they would name their son. She had wanted to name him Fred, but George had claimed the name for his own future child, and everyone immediately agreed to that. Sure, the names were plain and simple, but they had both fallen in love with him when he first came into the world, and the name seemed a perfect fit.
It took a while for the man to settle down from his bout of mocking laughter, but eventually he stopped, a great grin back on his face as he leered at Draco
Ginny sighed, and settled onto the couch. Harry remained standing, now with his arms crossed. He had no idea where this conversation was headed, and he felt there were other, more pressing matters, that they had to resolve.
"What is it, Dray?" Harry asked concernedly. He rarely saw his friend at a loss for words. Even under pressure, Draco could talk his way out of anything. His sudden reticence just made Harry all the more sure that nothing good would come out of this conversation.
"Of course," said Hermione. "But would you mind getting to it now? I think it's best you read it before hearing it from someone else..."
"I've missed a lot, I know that," she said, shaking so bad that Harry decided to comfort her. It was just what they did, they comforted each other, even though they were hurting each other. "I've always hated being away from James, but now I can't fucking accept that he's even more at ease with fucking Malfoy than with me! And I did all that, it was all my fault!"
, dating a super-awesome-mega-foxy-hot Quidditch star is quite the experience, what with all that fame and glory." He poked the tip of her nose playfully. "But I'll tell them that none of that unwanted attention matters at the end of the day because this boring old Auror gets to take her home every night for the rest of his life."
With that, she turned away and marched back towards the Manor, and Draco was left speechless. Was this just so she could gloat at him about being right? But it had to be more serious than that, or she wouldn't have cut his morning walk short.
Ron was the first to come back to his senses after the surprise arrival of his sister, jumping up to welcome her. "Bloody hell! What the fuck are you doing here?!" She eagerly walked into his embrace, eyes still trained on Harry, who seemed to get over his shock as well.
Harry just sighed. "Not for now, but we'll tell you about it when it gets sorted out," he promised. Macmillan nodded, said his goodbyes and disappeared.
Ginny shrugged. "A long engagement isn't that big of a deal in our family anyway. Not like in traditional pureblood families where they basically sell you off to the family with the best assets."
Harry brushed off the apology. "Come off it. We're mature enough to handle serious matters. I mean, I admit I quite enjoy our talks anyway, regardless of whether they're just stupid or whatever."
Her reaction made Draco wonder silently, if this was what it felt like to be needed and wanted in someone's life that a simple agreement to show up meant everything to them.
He shook his head and opened his book, forcing himself to tune out the discussion between Narcissa and Astoria, and instead turned the pages to the first piece about neurally debilitating poisons.
As if on signal, more voices were added to the room with the sudden arrival of Ron, Hermione, Hugo and Rose. Almost instantly, the energy in Grimmauld Place became supercharged and energized that Harry felt even more excited than he had been that morning.
: That's wonderful news. I'm sure with all of you grown up, there was a need for them to help out with the grandchildren.
"Right now?" Astoria took the sleeping Scorpius from her husband, intending to take him to bed. Near the door, she turned back to him. "Making an emergency call to your mother is one thing. But isn't it too early for a business call?"
"Hello, Teddy," Draco greeted warmly, letting the little boy hug him around the legs. "You just keep on growing and growing, don't you?"
It took Harry another quarter hour just to assure Andromeda, but eventually he was able to convince her to relax and go about her way. After all, she had left Teddy with Harry because she needed to take care of important family matters, and couldn't bring the boy with her. When she finally disappeared from the Floo, Harry picked Teddy up in his arms, then levitated the small trunk to the smallest bedroom, which he had long since kept for the little boy. It was almost time for bed, so they went through the routine of washing up and tucking in. When Teddy was settled and looking sleepy after Harry read to him, he yawned largely and turned on his side, which was Harry's cue to leave.
Harry rolled his eyes. "You keep my secrets, I keep yours," he said, eyes twinkling. "The ultimate Potter and Malfoy conspiracy, and no one would be the wiser."
Draco rushed out of the bathroom in response to his wife's growing impatience. She knew him well enough to know that he took great pride in grooming himself, taking special care that his soft hair always fell around his face in just the right way, but
It was only then that Harry remembered that Arthur was still with them. He shifted to look at the man and was surprised to see him smiling warmly at Malfoy.
"Not really, no. Mostly we fought about our differing priorities. I'm not the kind of person to leave my work behind when I know that it's within my capabilities to excel. Being offered the position of Legal consultant to the Minister in addition to my job at the Ministry was a prize that I felt I had earned. I never saw it as a burden."
"I don't think house elves are meant to understand rhetoric questions or sarcasm," a voice drawled from the doorway. "Dilly, thank you for telling me he was awake. Please prepare the usual breakfast in the smaller dining room for the both of us." The house elf nodded, bowed, and popped away, leaving the two men to stare at each other.
Potter's interest seemed piqued at the possible new lead. He liked having something for his team to do on the field. "Anything else?"
It had only come to Harry the previous night to owl Malfoy. If he were being honest with himself, he was surprised that he hadn't come up with the idea earlier, considering that the blonde was considered one of the brightest Potions experts. Obviously, since his consultancy for the Department of Mysteries was highly confidential, as was the nature of the case, Harry had had to word his desperate letter in such a way that would not draw attention. He had sent it off first thing in the morning, hoping to hear back from the man by the evening. Thank Merlin that Malfoy had picked up the severity of his (kind of stupid)¬†message. Now that Harry knew Malfoy was willing to help them, he had felt much better and was able to greet Andromeda and Teddy without the usual burden on his back.
It was late when Harry received a very unexpected call from Malfoy Manor, but he knew in a heartbeat that it wasn't Draco. (Ron, who was having dinner at Grimmauld Place with Hermione and their children, never bothered to ask how he knew, but of course Harry never expected Malfoy to call any time before eleven).
"So, Ferret," Ron teased, beer in hand, "for what particular reason did you finally succumb to the call of the pint?"
"I hope she gets over it eventually," Harry said, pouring himself a shot of Firewhiskey once they reached the bar. "D'you need to get away for a bit?" When Ginny nodded, Harry brought her to their bedroom and closed the door. The noise level immediately lowered and his fiancee let out a sigh of relief.
Neither of them spoke for a while. They hadn't had a row that heated. Granted, this was prompted by her sudden admittance that she was leaving for a month and a half.
She rushed out, leaving him in her dust. Draco, however, now had a small smile on his face. If anything terrible occurred, at least he could guarantee the safety of his only child.
It wasn't that he was sad, or mad, or angry. He wasn't even properly frustrated. He just felt like he was an over-inflated dirigible, just waiting for the moment of explosion with no prior warning.
"You were exposed to the hazards of fire and sharp objects and manual labor when you were only a child?!"
"Neither did I," Harry answered, though quietly as if only to himself. He wondered the same thing in his head. What had prompted Malfoy to talk to him via Floo, on a whim? He hadn't exactly given a reason, but it had made sense to Harry at the moment. He didn't question why Malfoy needed him, but it did feel right. He himself was having a pretty shit day, but all of it had gone out the window when he found that he had to comfort the blond git somehow.
Despite Harry's worries after the odd Floo Call, Malfoy seemed oblivious to how close he had come to unravelling his biggest secret, and he was grateful. The two of them had now gotten more used to having to work around each other, either by Floo or owl post. Meeting in person was still too risky for either of them, though Ron had pointed out that Grimmauld Place would be sufficiently private enough for them to converse in person should the need arise. Harry agreed, but so far, the fire calls and the owls were working well enough as a means of communication.
"That's‚Ä¶ preposterous‚Ä¶" Draco whispered, deep in thought. "Why would anyone take such extreme measures to intimidate me? I can't think of anyone who has a deep enough grudge against me."
"Er... yeah, kind of..." Harry mumbled, suddenly regretting ever calling his best friends over. He hadn't exactly foreseen them to be on the extreme opposites where Ginny was concerned.
has an infinite range when invoked, meaning that the focus of the ancient invocation, meaning you," he paused, pointing at Potter, "is the basis for the wards."
"It was just an idea," Ginny said lightly. "We should check in with Hermione more, if Ron's still full time at the Ministry and Mum and Dad are in France, she'll need all the help she can get."
"You made this for me?!" Hermione exclaimed. In her hands, she held a ceramic dish, inside of which was Harry's trademark Shepherd's Pie.
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "She hasn't been herself lately, both of you must have seen that. I don't think she hated it here, or hated having to run around the house and take care of me and James, but you can't deny that she wasn't feeling... right."
He often found Draco staring at him, but quickly looking away when he would look towards him. He knew that there could only be two reasons why his enemy would be staring at him.
"I DO NOT! I'm not even ga-" Harry gets close enough to grab Draco's waist and pulls him into his body. He then cuts Draco off by forcing his lips onto his, but still with a softness he has only for his crush.
The funny thing about that was, it was dependent on the people around Harry. He didn't have control over what they thought, but their own minds came up with various explanations for whatever Harry wanted unseen. Once, he had brought James with him under a full set of privacy wards, and no one even noticed anything out of the ordinary. Not even one witch, who had merely commented on the weather after bumping into him. So the fact that Malfoy even noticed Harry's awkward arms around James had shaken him, and it left him tense all throughout the call.
"You're not being spied on, Ron," Hermione interjected. She had a thoughtful expression, which Draco was sure meant that the cogs were working overtime. "But I do agree that it's a rather large inconvenience for the entire department. Surely they're aware of the gross amount of interdepartmental cooperation within the Ministry in one month, let alone a year? It's such a generalized and sloppy solution, and it'll take forever just to get everyone done!"
Draco turned to his mother. He knew that she, with limited exposure to the muggle world, would be doubting the entire process. But at this point, he was pretty much desperate for any solution, and all it would take was a reading of their aura and their family bloodline. Perhaps, he would pursue this interesting branch of muggle studies, but for now, his only concern was how it could help Scorpius.
The blond matriarch shook her head, though her eyes remained focused on the tome in her hands. "There is none that is as all-encompassing in physical and magical protection as this one. The only known ward that is superior to this is the
The woman visibly gulped, but Harry could see how much she tried to look him in the eye. "William Howe is still at his home, sir. The Aurors on watch have had him in sight since before the -
"Who would have thought we'd all become parents, eh?" he whispered, not really aware that Hermione had heard him.
Finally, he heard Ron leaving the lockers and Harry immediately forgot his unprompted reflections because he noticed the time. "Fuck!" he cried. "You certainly took your time!" They hurried quickly out of the Ministry's Atrium, almost ran into the overlarge Floos, and simultaneously called out, "The Leaky Cauldron!" before vanishing in a puff of green smoke. In their hurry to leave, Ron and Harry didn't notice a pair of grey eyes watching them with curious amusement.
: Ron and I have no qualms about such matters. He understands my personal need to focus on the law, and it's not really a big deal between us, to be honest.
James was slapping his fisted hands on the top of his high chair, so Ginny took his wrists and gently admonished him until the baby relented and put his attention elsewhere. No one around them batted an eyelash. Today, Harry had decided to make the three of them unrecognizable to anyone, so that they could have a lunch out together as a family without any pressure. No one in the wizarding world even knew about James, so the three of them were just an average picture of a happy family dining out.
"Amazing how much things have changed in such a short time," he mused, taking a sip of his tea. "Here I am, defending Potter and Weasley's honor from
Draco's words echoed in the chamber, cutting off the conversation between his so-called wife and her lover. They both stared at him oddly, and Gerard seemed amused.
Malfoy just scoffed. "One, immediate proximity. Two, a deep emotional bond that is mutual in nature Three, a sincere intent to protect and cherish. So how do you suggest we get more than one of those?" he finally spat out.
Harry groaned. "As if my life hasn't been one huge cauldron of angst. I need the laughs more, I think. I'm sure anything is better to talk about than my life."
Draco thanked them all, then dissolved into the fire. Harry sat back while Ron stretched. "Well," said the redhead, "let's get this party started."
After checking in with Ron via Floo, Harry hastily scribbled out a reply and sent off the letter. Then he sent off his own owl with another letter for Andromeda, asking if she could take James for the night. He would have asked Molly, but he was sure that she already had her hands full with Hugo and a pregnant Hermione.
"I gave birth to him, yes. I have done what a mother must do for a child, have I not? And you, of course, helped. There was definitely no room for a child in our original plan, but it still worked out somehow."
Weasley nodded in approval, noting it down. "Ernie, you go over to Lucas, he's still got pull within the International Magical Transportation office. Tell him to ask for the list of British wizards or witches who went in and out of France within two weeks before and after the Malfoys were there."
Harry looked curiously at his host. He didn't want to steer the conversation into dangerous waters this early in the day, and he was having fun. He was actually having a good time for once without having to try.
"Of course! I'm grown up!" Teddy exclaimed, puffing out his chest proudly and hair turning a shade of red. Harry was immediately reminded of a tiny Percy Weasley.
Draco couldn't help but laugh. He really did want to watch the rest, and now that Harry mentioned it, he did understand the need to lay back and just forgo the unnecessary fanfare. More often nowadays, he and Astoria tended to disagree about having those extra lavish birthday soirees. If he were being honest, that kind of stuff could be a little exhausting unless you kept it within the immediate family and friends (which Astoria did not, of course.) Silently, he agreed with Harry - it was his birthday, so he could spend it however he wanted, no matter how simple.
The blonde's face flashed with obvious surprise at being invited. "Oh, er, thank you, yes I think I'll join you," he said, seating himself next to, but slightly away from Harry. The brunet drained the rest of his drink, waved to the barman for another round, and worried about how to make small talk while they waited. Thankfully, Malfoy seemed much better at handling awkward situations, socialite that he was.
"Harryyyyyyyy!" the little boy cried out, running to him. Harry instinctively took him up in his arms. "Quick, Gran is right behind me! She says it's a 'mergency-"
Draco laughed, brandishing his own glass. "I find that non-magic whiskey sometimes burns more on the way down than Firewhiskey, which is saying something. Now, what's wrong?"
That night, Harry stayed in his study to wait for Ginny. In a bassinet by the corner, James was fast asleep. It was during these quiet hours when his mind usually began to work.
"I don't care if she's a muggle," Draco said softly, turning to face his friend. "But if this helps to save my son, then I will take back everything I've ever said against muggles."
From the other side of the room, Narcissa lay down a sleeping Scorpius. Her own brow was marked with worry, and it was with immense self-control, Draco knew, that his mother could keep her face as calm as it seemed. Astoria sat close to their son, hands clutching subconsciously on her silk robes.
Harry gave out an exaggerated, long-suffering sigh. Spending time with Malfoy also meant going with the flow. Which meant going with whatever Malfoy judged best. Ironically enough, they both had realized that Harry and Ron made terrible decisions all the time, and that Malfoy could be trusted to actually make the right call for a number of situations. The man was bossy and prissy, but he knew what he was doing more half the time.
"The fact that both she and I are perfectly fine. It's kind of a red flag, you know, when you realize you're just fine and dandy whether your fianc√©e is with you or not. I barely even notice when she's away - it doesn't make much of a difference. And I'm pretty sure it's the same with James. He hardly misses his own mum, because he hasn't an idea what he's even supposed to miss."
"Truthfully, yes," Potter confirmed Draco's suspicions. "It now feels like everything is moving in slow motion."
He also, most definitely, hadn't realized how much better he now felt with the new company he had by his side.
Harry liked that he could cause Draco to snort whenever he quoted his favorite lines along with the characters on the screen. He didn't care though, and he mostly kept on doing it because it seemed to amuse the blond so much.
Not that the entire situation had been solved in the blink of an eye, of course. The entire family was still at odds at how Harry and Ginny would be able to handle their now family of four while not being together. It was something that Arthur had reminded everyone was between Harry and Ginny, and that it was no one else's business. Add to that the fact that it had to be kept from the public again.
Ron's eyebrows furrowed a bit, but he didn't say anything yet. Hermione looked confused. "Did you guys argue about her having to go away, then?"
"Exactly. 'Mione probably has this list of things that she wants to achieve first. It's not that she doesn't want to marry you, mate, I think she's just doesn't want to now."
"Using familial blood to call on a ward invokes very powerful magic. If it could protect Harry Potter from the Dark Lord, then it could very well be our only means to keep Scorpius safe no matter what happens."
"What is it?" he asked sharply, feeling as if his broomstick had been yanked out from under him while flying. All thoughts of the good morning he had shared with Malfoy were immediately replaced with the sting of reality. "Arthur? Molly? What did they say?"
"Anyway, he thought it was unfair that you were going to have an open hearing. He thought it was only an excuse for officials to humiliate you and get you to react in such a way as to incriminate yourself in public."
"What are we talking about?" Potter had rejoined them at last, bringing with him a fresh batch of butterbeers.
"It feels brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! I can't wait till I can actually try walking down Diagon Alley and not have any nosy reporters trying to catch me off guard. I mean, I'm eighteen and all but this'll be the first time I'll get to feel like I'm normal, y'know?"
On the long walk up the lifts to Shacklebolt's wing, Draco thought about how much more interesting Potter had become since he called up the
"Careful, you'll squeeze him," Ginny said amusedly, which brought Harry's thoughts back down. He pulled away slowly, not even daring to breathe.
"I don't know!" Astoria cried, shaking her head. "I don't know, I'm sorry I can't tell you much more. I'm just sure it‚Äôs him, I'm sure! Please don't be angry at me!"
"Yeah," Ron said in agreement, "we think Pince is the same thing. Pettigrew had been more of a footman or a mere servant, but he held the key to the Dark ritual that brought Voldemort a new body. We at the MMI think that Pince has been kept out of the loop, but may have highly significant information, despite the fact that he himself might not be aware."
His heart felt like it would burst at any moment, it was filled with such a lightness that he had never known before. He had held other children before, of course. But knowing that Potter had allowed him this peek into his private life, this great responsibility of keeping such a huge secret - it filled him with wonder.
Draco looked doubtfully at the man, while Weasley and Hermione grabbed the opportunity to voice out their own concerns.
"So... you've no idea?" Harry asked desperately. He had gotten so used to her solving everything by reciting a book verbatim. She shook her head sadly.
It was to their immense surprise, therefore, when a nervous-looking mediwitch came in to announce the arrival of several visitors.
She didn't speak for a while, which alarmed Draco somewhat, but he stayed the entire time that she was silent. Finally though, she seemed to realize his presence again after several minutes. "I'm sorry, Draco," she sighed. "I didn't mean to bother you so late at night-"
Draco nodded, knowing full well that being an Auror was really a full-time job, and he was glad that he was a consultant. At least he had more control of his work hours.
When he felt that she had let out most of her excitement to the sky, he sat down on one of the lounges he had there, and beckoned her.
"Draco," Harry heard Arthur say politely, which gave him enough motivation to lift his head and find out if he was hallucinating or not.
A smile lit Harry's face against his will. "It's true," he said, turning more to face Draco. "When you have that capacity to love, and you use it to the fullest by carrying as many as possible, that's when you feel even stronger. And the fact that you're scared for your family doesn't discount that, but it‚Ä¶ it shows that you have that empathy. Merlin, I'm rambling now."
When Harry gave her a smug look, Ginny grumbled some more. "At least I can fly for the rest of Montreal," she said consolingly to herself.
"Yes, yes, but I got a call from-" she stopped, looking suddenly behind him. With a jolt, Harry remembered that Malfoy was with them.
"I think..." Harry took a deep breath. "I think it's because we still had some growing up to do... and having James forced us to do it too fast and... skip ahead. I think we outgrew ourselves, Ginny."
though his final conclusions had been off base. Still, it unnerved him. Once again, he felt vulnerable.
around him would permit trustworthy family and friends. This probably meant that Malfoy himself was unwittingly included in the list, being a former schoolmate, current acquaintance and now a confidential colleague. It also meant, Harry realized, that he was trustworthy.
The first thought that Harry had was, how in the fucking hell could she have been photographed? Harry was sure that his
At first, he and Ron had been apprehensive, both of them fearing the additional workload and extended hours. However, Kingsley pointed out that his intetion was that they could now delegate more tasks to their new subordinates, as well as spread out and rotate the Aurors around the clock. This ultimately meant that Harry and Ron, as Head and Deputy Head respectively, now had much more time on their hands, and much less stress to deal with, and Merlin knew that they both needed the break.
He didn't voice out to his mother his own insecure assumptions. He had always been proud of his having her as a wife, and always aimed to please her as much as he could, even when it sometimes meant he had to swallow his Malfoy pride. He wouldn't go as far as to say that they were very romantic - after all, such a relationship was not truly expected in pureblood alliances. But he had seen the way Lucius and Narcissa had looked at each other, and even without words Draco understood that there was something hiding in those furtive glances and secret smiles. He had wanted that. And he found it in Astoria.
"Tell me how you see yourself a year from now. Two years from now. Five years. Tell me, now, the first thing that comes to mind."
"Oh I'm sure it did, but it's not publicized in the way that you probably imagine," said Ron offhandedly. "It's usually between the two families, and it doesn't matter to anyone else because it's usually assumed to be true. I mean, no one really bats an eyelash about it because it's the way things have been for centuries."
"Before-" Malfoy's eyes widened in disbelief. "Potter, you realize, 'before Hogwarts' means 'before eleven."
As expected, Hermione was highly affronted. "How is me handling my jobs perfectly fine an example of over-involvement or attachment?! Are you telling me I can't manage my own affairs? Just because I'm a girl, Harry, doesn't mean I'm not capable of-"
"You misunderstand me," Hermione answered. "I just need to take the same samples from your sister, Andromeda, and her grandson."
Draco groaned. He had never felt more lost than he did now, having met someone with whom he could verbally spar with, someone he could see as his equal, only to lose them right after. (There was always Potter, of course, but he didn't want to think about
"I don't know what happened to us, Harry," she cried, tears soaking into his shirt. "Why do you think this happened? I thought we would be so happy together! We used to be so happy!"
Ella Perkins might have jumped a bit at Harry's sharpness, but he didn‚Äôt feel like apologizing at the moment. There were more important things on his mind.
Wearing down the carpet in front of his office fire did nothing to soothe Harry's nerves, but he couldn't stop. A sudden sense of recklessness had overcome him, and his feet took up the challenge of using his pent up energy. He felt like a tightly wound coil at the end of its limit. The Floo roared a vivid emerald, and the brunet was immediately on his knees to take the call he'd been expecting from Malfoy Manor.
"Helen thinks... the pregnancy might be too unstable at this point, and that Ginny might go into labor any time soon. No guarantee yet of what that might mean..."
Malfoy feigned a look of disbelief, which he knew Potter would take as a joke. "How preposterous. Naming is such a great moment in a Pureblood's life, old families even had it professionally done before."
Narcissa and Hermione had been taken to the MMI office as soon as the securely direct Floo travel was established.
"Draco," Potter said suddenly, as if disregarding his best friends' words. Draco glanced at him, surprised at the sudden and casual use of his given name. "Are you sure about this?"
The little boy, just turned eight, was now a boisterous bubble of energy (or more so than he had already been when Draco had met him) but this was easily diverted by now having two outlets for his entertainment - Uncle Harry and Cousin Draco.
It was those precious moments, right before, that Draco saw the determination that the green eyes exuded, the singe-minded intent to strike down the maniacal murderer in front of him to save the people who meant everything to him.
Ginny ignored his puppy dog face, and instead pulled him towards the door. Harry held her back, however. "There's one more thing I forgot to show you! One of the deal breakers of this place."
"Oh," Harry exclaimed, "sorry, I'm not sure if we'd talked about this before, you see, since we're mostly piss-drunk. I meant... er... When I died, the afterlife looked pretty much like King's Cross Station, and Dumbledore told me that moving on might have involved taking a train from there. So I was kind of making a casual joke about, you know, you and me having a laugh while waiting for the train."
"-And now the Healers say they've stabilized her, whatever that means, but then she might have the baby soon, which is two months too early, and I can't help but worry for her safety, and the baby's as well, I mean, aren't babies supposed to keep developing 'til the full term? Merlin, there's so much that can go wrong if we have the baby too early, and Ginny's probably having a hard time, too, and there's nothing I can really do to help at this point and I hate feeling absolutely useless and - I'm sorry, I'm rambling, aren‚Äôt' I?"
This case was driving everyone in MMI mental. The amount of guilt running around the department was also increasing, since they hadn't been able to put a stop to the string of murders. The suspect that they had apprehended had had a complicated Memory Charm worked into his mind, which made it difficult for Harry's team to construct a decent profile. All that they had to work on was a recovered list of ingredients, whose final product could not be found in the suspect's head, but was presumably sinister in nature, and probably used to commit the horrid crimes.
Ron remained quiet for a while, and Harry was afraid that he had overstepped his boundaries, but then the redhead nodded and said, "Thanks."
Making breakfast with the potions prat had been awkward enough, but proper manners pretty much dictated that Malfoy could hardly refuse Hermione's invitation to dine together as '
A sudden pop in front of him announced the presence of one of his house elves, who immediately bowed low. "Master Draco is back home," it said reverently. "Would Master be wanting to join Lady Black and her guests?"
To his amusement, Potter seemed to resign himself to his new companion, and finally got up to follow him.
Malfoy sniggered. "Baby steps, Potter," he said. "We can worry about taking over the world some other time."
"Ugh, don't remind me," Harry said, putting his forehead on the table in defeat. "I'm absolutely not looking forward to it, and neither is Ginny."
," he insisted, gesturing towards one of the rooms upstairs. "There are so many extra rooms and floors that we can probably have our own floor if need be."
Draco looked at him, surprised. He knew about Ginevra, and assumed the same for Weasley and Hermione too, would be obvious recipients of the benefits of
"Ah, just a little special brew that's been used with no fail for centuries‚Ä¶ Worked like a charm, too, pun intended."
Harry got up from his seat and started pacing again. He was pretty sure he'd worn down a sizeable chunk of his office carpet, but he couldn't really give a damn right now because his best mate was in trouble. This wasn't just about his duty. This shit just became
, you know," he said smugly. "And I know perfectly well the... depth... of the requirements to successfully bind someone else to your protection."
"Because you take care of 'beauty' while I take charge of the 'brains' part of this marriage," Draco teased, kissing her forehead before getting back on his feet. "Tell me if there's anything else you'll need today, since I'll be out after dinner."
Harry thought back to his conversations on the Floo with Malfoy. "Hang on. One of the reasons he takes this seriously is because the letter got through his wards in the first place. So relying on just the property wards isn't foolproof."
"Yes, Mother, I understand." Draco nodded, already knowing where the conversation would eventually end up. "I will trust your judgment."
Draco thought about that, reflected the slight heaviness in the tone of voice. Potter was obviously speaking from experience. It made him wonder if he was referring to Voldemort's time, or his run as an Auror, or perhaps something else that he just had no idea about. "I never would have thought it was a common occurrence," he said lightly.
Several weeks passed after the bindings were invoked for Malfoy when the next threat came. Harry rubbed frustratingly at his eyes in a valiant effort to wake himself up enough as he leaned a bit closer to the fire where Malfoy's face hovered, full of concern.
In fact, Harry believed, they had both done each other a favor tonight, and given each other some much-needed peace of mind. How and why, precisely, were beyond him.
"Well," Draco began slowly, "our relationship had always been more formal and‚Ä¶ strict. I've told you before about my own upbringing, and Father was‚Ä¶" his brows furrowed, "he played his role as best he could."
"Whatever it is, you'll get through it," Potter said with conviction, squeezing Draco's shoulder in a comforting way. "And I would never judge you, Malfoy. Not after everything we've been through. You deserve more than that."
The shell-shocked blond heard the voice calling his name, and he felt his blood run cold. He turned reluctantly towards the source. There, in the dim light of his makeshift prison, was‚Ä¶
Harry frowned. Both of them had noticed that James took to his father much better than to his mum. Despite all the alternate hours they had set up with the boys, Ginny couldn't seem to offer the kind of comfort that their eldest found in Harry. It was both warming and disheartening at the same time.
"Well, it did take a while to convince them, but Mum became ecstatic when I mentioned that Gwenog Jones had personally requested my attendance. You know how she is."
"You may now commence your interrupted moment of emotional expression," he said quietly to the brunet next to him, who was obviously still trying to wipe away tear tracks, before jabbing an elbow into his friend's chest. "What? You deserve to go crazy considering your fianc√©e is in the middle of a medical situation. No one can fault you for that."
"That's what friends are for, aren't they?" Draco replied teasingly. "Though in our case, I think bringing up the old rivalry seems to do wonders, doesn't it?"
"I have been blessed enough to have made a new name for myself, and to have such a high regard for my profession within the ministry itself, in only a few years. Of course I know the benefits we reap from making friends and forging new alliances in all those official events that we attend. It was the only reason we are where we are now. But I realized lately that I no longer put too much stock in the social aspect of our society."
"I knew that already," Harry said, unable to hide the tone of pride in his voice. Who would've imagined that his girl would be playing for the country in the upcoming World Cup?!
Kingsley cleared his throat to pull the audience back from their guilty thoughts. "Harry Potter has been deemed as a Hero of the Wizarding World, and awarded with the Order of Merlin, First Class. He is a hero in every sense of the word, as well as in our history books, and his name has been marked with distinction equal to the greatest heroes of the Wizarding World. He is, therefore, within his right to invoke
When Narcissa was struck dumb by his outburst, he moved towards her and took her hands in his. "Thank you, for everything," he said softly, gently. "I know you mean well. I will... take your words into consideration."
Hermione sputtered, while Ron's eyes widened somewhat comically. "You let her go?! Just like that?" he exclaimed.
He knew nothing of Kingsley Shacklebolt, except that he had been an Auror, as well as stuck to Potter like glue. The man would have become a Muggle for Potter. But he was also a formidable person, and someone you wouldn't like to oppose. He was actually the best kind of wizard to become the Minister for Magic. Facing him one on one would be unnerving, Draco was sure. But he had been raised to withstand immense amounts of pressure without breaking a sweat, so he dutifully answered the summons, left a note for his mother, and Flooed straight into the Atrium of the Ministry of Magic.
"Does that mean we get to play with Cousin Draco again?" the little metamorphmagus asked excitedly. He was still at the age where he couldn't quite understand repetitive patterns in the long term, but knew enough that he was always worked up whenever he realized it was a Sunday, because Sundays were special.
"I have no idea how it happened," Harry said thoughtfully, brow furrowing. At the mediwitch's¬†raised brow, he felt his cheeks flush.¬†"I mean, I know how but not
Harry was thoroughly enjoying himself. Ron almost always fell asleep through the first twenty minutes, while Hermione just didn't find the movies as interesting, preferring factual or intellectual types instead.
"It's the Pureblood version of a marriage contract," Ron explained. "It's very different from the one between me and Mione. Our family doesn't follow those old traditions, see."
Flourish & Blotts always held the promise of fresh new Potions manuals for Draco, so he usually went there when he needed a distraction from his thoughts. Having been back for only a couple of months was enough time to give him a headache, and he decided that a quick visit to the book shop was in order.
Harry gaped at that. Of course it was highly involved! A woman physically had a foreign body growing inside of her for nine months! When Molly saw his expression, she shook her head.
"He means that quite literally," Potter said suddenly to Draco. "This was horrible when I first got it, and- well, way too many bad memories, to be honest. So one day, I just took an old axe from the storeroom and just chopped through whatever I thought needed to go."
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Your estate is only keyed to the Malfoy family, right?" He knew he remembered correctly when the blonde nodded. "Do you have anyone else keyed in?"
"I was more of a father to Scorpius that you have ever been! Or ever will be!" Draco's cries took on a desperate tone. "I
"Ah." Draco was unsure on how to respond to his mother's observation. Inwardly, he cursed himself for letting his Malfoy Mask fail. And then cursed himself again for letting his mother, of all people, be the one to call him out. And accuse him of adultery in the same breath. Clearly, his skills in taking in details from brief observations were inherited.
Draco had never felt so insulted in his entire life. He had been kicked out of the delivery room and was just two seconds close from drawing his wand and cursing the damned Mediwizard, when his mother finally appeared and helped to pull him back to his senses.
Narcissa seemed to appreciate his fears though. "Of course, dear," she said gently. "Worry not for me. I am safe at the Manor. Get here as soon as you can." With that, the call ended and Draco allowed himself to melt into the seat's backrest.
"That sounds like a plan," Harry agreed, grinning. "I'm really proud of your commitment to Quidditch!"
"You never stopped being part of us, Gin," Harry said, now moving to hold her closer. She let him pull her into his embrace, and Harry felt like something inside him clicked back into place.
Percy laughed. "Harry, you had every right to do that. Really, it's the least that the Ministry can do, to keep out of your life for once."
Two years. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for waiting patiently, and encouraging me to keep the tale going. Love, Idishi <3
"No, Potter," Malfoy spat out in spite of himself. "Obviously I was saving all the information up for the next Dark Lord to use against the Golden Boy of the Wizarding World."
Narcissa was lounging in the smaller breakfast alcove in a secluded corner of the Manor when Draco joined her for breakfast. The tension in her face, which her son had grown accustomed to in the last few months, had almost completely melted away, and her face was slowly returning to its graceful beauty. Draco himself, had flourished quite well after the strange events that occurred at their trial.
"Yes, we'd sort of established that a while back," Harry said with a slight smirk. Malfoy glared at him, though, so he schooled his expression into what he hoped was a serious one.
Harry, meanwhile, was caught in an onslaught of visions and memories full of blood, pain and guilt. Then he found himself running down a familiar corridor and into a flooded bathroom, with mirrors all around. At the other end of the room, bent over an old lavatory, was a blond someone. Harry's instincts told him to draw his wand. The man in front of him turned around to face Harry, and morphed into a teenager. His face was stained with grime and tears, his lips beginning to form into words, possibly a curse. Harry's bones told him it was the Cruciatus.
"Come to me later, Draco," the matriarch said seriously, before turning gracefully and walking towards her own suite within the Manor.
Draco scoffed at her attempt to give him a sermon and instead focused on his once-archenemy. The brunet looked as if he hadn't gotten enough sleep - the sallow skin and baggy eyes made Draco worry a bit, but also determined to show the remainders of the Trio that coddling was the last thing that Potter needed.
Harry shrugged his shoulders before hugging her tightly. "I can control the extent of the wards around us. All that'll change is us actually giving permission. Like personal information. Maybe even photos."
With a barking laugh, Harry agreed enthusiastically. "Of course! This might actually be one of my better birthdays, you know. Just the kids, no nosy strangers and stuffy people to impress. No noisy fanfare. Just cake. Oh, and Lord of the Rings. Perfect."
"I'll just go and check in with Molly," his pseudo-dad said, clapping Harry on the back again. "You two go ahead and take a break. Go for a walk. Have some coffee. It'll help," he added to Harry insistently when he was about to protest.
"I want so much more for us, Gin," Harry whispered. "We can have so much now! Without any of the public scrutiny, without the stupid Ministry in the way, we can finally have a real future together."
He leaned against the wall just outside the lockers. His body was exhausted, but he still felt a certain pride knowing that he was already on the way to becoming an Auror.
. Ron had long since given up, pulling Ernie up to cover for him as they did the final cataloguing of all¬†77 active Aurors,¬†45 reserves, 29 cross-department consultants and¬†13 independent consultants, with the non-Aurors taking up an additional three weeks.
Draco went out again into the hall, this time looking around the place with the goal of identifying it from his childhood memories. That was when his beer-laden mind came to the question.
Malfoy, ever the gracious socialite, gave her a brilliant smile in return. "Hello, Ginevra. It's good to see you again."
They settled in their usual past-midnight habit of sharing a bit of Firewhiskey between the two of them and just basking in the warmth of the fire. Not that anyone really knew how often this type of thing happened. Though it wasn't as if they were hiding some terrible secret.
He stared at the tiny figure in Ginny's arms, focused on the gentle curves of the face, lingered on the dark tufts of hair, touched a finger to the tiny little balled up fists.
"Good morning, Mister Potter, sir, if Mister Potter would please stops hitting himself," the elf squeaked. "Master Draco has told Dilly to attend to you after you wakes up, sir. What breakfast would sir like to have?"
"That-that was you?!" Malfoy sputtered, his turn to be incredulous. "Ha! I thought those were stupid rumors you spread around."
Harry easily took care of the pancakes and bacon, while Malfoy chatted with an overexcited Teddy. James had yet to wake, but Harry didn't mind being able to entertain Malfoy and Teddy just a little longer without all the baby drama. Merlin knows last night had been enough.
He had grabbed Ginny and spun her around, then almost immediately dropping her gently, worried for the baby.
Harry paused to think about it. "I guess it could be true," he said slowly. "Ginny was always tired, physically, but she always had this great mood. She had a lot of stress as well but now that you mention it, she was always happier than sad." He mentally compared Ginny's exhausted but contented smiles, against Hermione's fragility and pessimism. Where he and Ginny had decided to see the pregnancy as a slight speed bump but a gift nevertheless, he knew that Ron and Hermione had had debates on the practicality of child rearing, and tended to focus on their personal differences. He couldn't really see Ron adding to the negativity, because they worked together and he was a witness to Ron's amazing work ethic, his efficiency at keeping his professional and personal lives clearly defined. He never took work home with him (as if Harry would let him!) and he always looked forward to coming home to his wife.
Announcement Charm. The couple, as they had already expected, were immediately accosted by the other guests, who were clamoring for their attention. The Malfoys were still very much celebrities amongst the more exclusive wizarding society, and people fawned over the perfect picture of pureblood partnership that they embodied. And so began another night of polite conversation, formal dancing and the occasional caress between the spouses when they could manage them. With the flash of lightbulbs almost blinding Draco, it was no surprise that he completely ignored the pair of dark grey eyes, ominously watching him from across the hall.
Dinner that evening was a lively affair. Hermione and Ginny were forgiving despite having waited for the boys, but since the two women had spent the time exchanging stories and sharing their career plans, neither noticed the time.
Andromeda appeared lost, but quickly gathered herself and returned his polite tone. "Yes, I'm afraid though that I have been, ah, out of touch with your side of the family for many years."
But he still didn't say anything, of course. He just hoped that she changed her mind very soon. Apparently, Narcissa was not the only one to feel the fluttery sense of excitement at the thought of expecting a child into the Malfoy clan.
Trivia time!: "Solum Sanctuarii" is literally Latin for "Sole Sanctuary". This will be elaborated in later Chapters. If you think it has bad grammar or syntax, kindly blame Google Translate :)
When Narcissa's expression brightened at his words, Draco couldn't help but smirk. "We'll see if your theories have any basis in fact."
Honestly, Draco could barely pay any attention to his Mother's enchantment because he was too ecstatic once she had said the name out loud. None of her other words mattered after that.
The look of horror on Draco's face must have been expected, because the man smirked even more in delight. "Yeah, that's right, Who'dve guessed your pretty little wife was the center of all of this?"
Letting out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding, Harry once again relaxed onto his chair. A lot had really changed since the war. He felt much better now that he knew he would get the right kind of help he needed to move this case along, even if that help came from Draco Malfoy.
They were all still waiting for the other shoe to drop, for that moment when the suspected wizard would become so annoyed or so overconfident that he would give himself away. The Auror watch was still tailing William Howe, but it was so far inconclusive.
Ginny bit her lip. "You know we were pretty lucky that James' delivery was perfectly normal, if a bit of a challenge."
"I'm worried though," he continued, "she's been acting quite cold, not exactly as I pictured someone who was happy and excited to have their first child."
Harry could feel just a little bit of pressure in his chest melt away at Ron's words. "So Draco isn't in immediate danger of OD-ing, right? That's a good thing?"
He didn't even have the chance to gasp in furious surprise as a force grabbed him from behind his navel. In the blink of an eye, Draco was gone.
"One time, our head elf popped in front of me in a panic because they couldn't settle Scorpius down to sleep. It turns out one of them had completely forgotten to give him a pre-prepared bottle that he'd gotten used to sleeping with. Started bawling when he couldn't find it and the elves had no idea at all until I retrieved it myself."
Harry's head snapped up to meet Ginny's eyes. "It wouldn't be the same," was all he said. Being an Auror meant so much to him. It represented all his hard work, his training, his effort to be good enough to earn the title. "Sure, the hours are demanding, but it's worth it."
"If memory serves, you weren't exactly just sitting, nor were you the slightest bit useless. Look, you've even managed to polish this part of the marble to a terrific sheen, and only with your shoes. Job well done."
"Ugh, I don't even get my own room," Ginny wrinkled her nose, but her tone was playful. Harry pulled her to him and they stood that way for a long while just savoring each other's warmth.
The second thing that immediately caught his attention was Potter's amused expression as he handed him a steaming cup of tea.
Teddy scrunched his nose in childish disgust - apparently he had an inkling of what dirty diapers meant.
"Exactly," Potter said, nodding. "He doesn't even seem like he was in the center of information, but more along the fringe of whatever nefarious plans the real mastermind has in store." Draco noticed the brunet pause as if uncomfortable with what he was about to say. "Er, actually, he reminded me more of, er, Pettigrew."
"But Mother!" Draco cried, unable to sound level-headed in teh face of a medical crisis. "She's been in there for almost half an hour and I've not been allowed to see her! It's unbelievable!"
Potter gave a sort of bark of laughter, which was unexpected, but melted the bit of frost from the depths of Draco's heart. He couldn't help but grin.
Harry stabbed his quill into the parchment in agitation. "Apollo, assemble a Tracking team and lead the search to Vienna. Ella can secure the necessary permits for the ministry. I'll get a hold of Lucas myself, fix the transportation." He turned over to Draco. "I'm sorry, was there anything else from Astoria?"
Ron blanched. "But she...she said... well, she said she wasn't ready yet, but you're right, she didn't actually tell me no!"
"She should have," Harry agreed. "But she didn't. Neither did I, if you recall. Like I said, we didn't realize that we needed to really grow into ourselves on our own first. We didn't. i think we both acted on impulse, we both had our own reasons to prove ourselves. And... Now we're here, and we've agreed that we won't regret any of it, or blame each other for our disillusioned choices after the war."
Hearing such things from Draco broke Hermione's self-control, and they both snorted in laughter at the image of the Malfoy ancestors rolling in their graves.
Of course, Draco was only trying to reach Potter the only way he knew how - by verbal fencing. And to the surprise of the Weasel and the Mudblood, Potter gave out a barking laugh.
Harry couldn't help but be a little curious. It wasn't difficult to get Hermione flustered, but he had long since become sensitive to his friends' reactions, and he took her warning tone seriously.
Their conversation was interrupted by the tapping of an owl by the window. Ron recognized it as one of their official owls, so he immediately took the letter it delivered. His face scrunched as he read it.
Harry nodded. He turned back to their Healer. "And you're sure that both Ginny and the baby will be safe if we do this as soon as possible?"
"No! I just - I'm glad to be closer to being an Auror. It feels like my life is on track and my purpose is crystal clear. I'm pretty excited about graduating and being inducted into the Corps."
"It happens," Apollo shrugged. "At least we can actually trace him as soon as Ella gets those permits. It was a good call, using that experimental tracker."
Finally reminding himself that it was not something to lose sleep over, given all his other serious problems, Harry finally allowed himself to drift off. His dreams that night were a blurry mix of baby James and Malfoy, and of the two of them playing together in the park, but all of that was forgotten by the time Harry awoke the next morning.
: Well, George stays at the shop in Diagon Alley, or sometimes he stays at the one in Hogsmeade. Percy's got a flat somewhere in London. Charlie decided to go back to Romania, says he's a man of habit and doesn't like change much. Ginny stays over more at (incoherent language)
The next morning, Harry awoke with a misplaced feeling in his gut. There was no memory of any nightmare, only of Malfoy's late night visit. There were no words for it, but he had a feeling deep down that Malfoy needed him in his life, and Harry needed him in his.
"Hang on. So..." Potter's brows came together as a show of his intellectual capacity. Obviously very little. "So your parents didn't name you?"
Hermione's exuberant cry for attention from across the room immediately took away Draco's presence, which left Harry a few moments to himself.
"Thank you," Malfoy said suddenly and very quietly. "Between you and me, Pureblood friendships are less shocking and more of a steadfast alliance. Neither Astoria nor I are quite accustomed to being attacked by a gang of Gryffindors like this, most notably within our private wards. Though we truly appreciate this... grand gesture."
Harry read it out loud. "Dirigible Plum...Dirigible Plum!" He turned towards Ron, suddenly excited. "No fucking way!"
"I did, of course. Didn't need changing. And he wasn't hungry either when I tried to give him his bottle." She carefully handed the baby to Harry, who automatically tucked him onto his side.
When Draco nodded, Harry caught his attention. "We'll be able to record where you've been. We'd be able to pinpoint your location if necessary. Are you sure?" He knew how fussy Draco was with his privacy.
Malfoy glanced at Ron's sleeping form, then turned back to Harry. "Maybe it's because we've got more in common than anyone thinks," he muttered.
Draco pretended to be offended once more, but his face had the trademark smug expression. "You forget my charm, my wit, my sharp intellect, my highly aristocratic beauty. And my gorgeous body, of course."
"How's that been for you?" Harry asked, curious. "I mean, I never had either of my parents around, but you actually got to know yours before he passed away. Er, not sure exactly how well you two got along‚Ä¶"
"Will you write him back?" Astoria queried, using the tone usually reserved for when she was giving him the benefit of the doubt.
Hi guys! I'd like to apologize for making you all wait so long for an update! It was pretty hard writing out the last two and a half chapters that I had to break them up into smaller batches for a better story flow. After that, My schedule became a bit too busy so it completely slipped my mind. Then after that, my detachable (slightly expensive) keyboard decided to slowly kill itself. But anyway, I hope I haven't lost too many readers out there. Much love, X
Realizing that he couldn't stand Ron being in such a bad mood, he finally stood up and went over to his partner's desk. Ron barely even looked up at his approach.
Draco heard the slightly begrudging way that Potter had said this, but he understood praise when he heard it. "This requires first distinguishing what the ingredients are, and then exploring every avenue of the magical characteristics of said ingredients, and then determining how they can all be used in conjunction with each other, and thus figuring out the possible nature of the hypothetical potion."
"Neither of you even stopped for a second to ask yourselves if maybe it was still... salvageable?" Ron offered, perhaps still holding out for the best possible outcome. He deflated though when Harry shook his head.
Draco was confused by the expression, but Potter just laughed. "As healthy as a horse, Ron," he corrected, but it still made no sense to Draco.
"What are you talking about?" Draco eyed them skeptically. "Oh. Oh. Of course." He shook his head in mock pity.
Molly and Arthur, of course, were already on their way as they had been personally contacted by Harry through the emergency Floo at St. Mungo's, which left Harry just a few minutes to himself, feeling even more nervous as each second ticked by.
No one had ever asked him that, as he would have only had to think about doing so for his future grandchildren. He was silent as he pondered this odd question, and missed the way that Potter was glancing at him from behind his cup of tea.
Harry immediately sought out Ginny. Sure enough he found her in one corner of the kitchen, behind her mother. Her big smile otherwise hid her rising impatience, which was already obvious to him but apparently missed by all the other guests in their home.
"Muggle film reference. Sorry." Harry shook his head, but then an idea came to him. "Tell you what. Let‚Äôs get those drinks, and maybe some crisps, and I'll show you what I was talking about."
: Oh my bad. (rolls eyes at HP) I meant to say, she's been travelling around with the Holyhead Harpies, you know, she's training for the National team and everything, so they've got her working day and night. She practically lives with them, so you can barely catch her here.
To be fair, he had never imagined he would be in such a situation, at least not so soon. Things had been going great after the ward release, more than a year ago, and he and Ginny had fallen into the kind of comfortable companionship that they'd always looked for in each other. They'd given each other so much space to grow, and they both enjoyed the amazing experience of being by each other's sides during every accomplishment they had. Ginny had decided to move in with Harry to spend more time with him and offset her constant training with the Harpies, and they had both felt quite giddy at the idea of living together.
Andromeda looked at the blond man as if he were something she couldn't identify. "That is quite a feat, young man, given the bad blood between."
Harry had looked through the memory again and again, but he still couldn't see the exact moment when he had actually agreed.
The blonde looked at him with fiery eyes. "I didn't mean to upset you, but I was trying to make my point when you so rudely interrupted me." He glared at Harry, and the latter had the decency to look embarrassed.
He and Astoria, had once again become the beacon of the modernized Purebloods, seeking to compromise and revolutionize what it meant to follow old traditions as well as accept new ones. Though admittedly, his wife was much more of a believer in the truly traditional customs while he found himself defending his more... liberal... tendencies when it came to the child-rearing. So far though, the couple had had no real problems when it came to Scorpius.
In light of his efforts to prove himself despite his darker past, rumours have spread that even the Minister himself has forged a working relationship with the Malfoy Heir. As reported before, Mr. Malfoy is an accomplished Potions Master, with an exceptional academic and professional record in France. This highly determined Prophet correspondent can confirm that the Ministry has in fact secured Mr. Malfoy's professional services, though the specific area or department is still being kept confidential. In any case, this is groundbreaking for the Malfoy family, and it is obvious that despite the previous collective scorn for their names, the new husband and wife have proven to be new favorite stars of Wizarding Society. The Daily Prophet offers our congratulations to the happy couple, and are looking forward to covering the upcoming Society Ball to be held at Malfoy Manor next month.
"See here, Malfoy," the Auror said, indicating old parchment records of previous cases. "There's typically a lull in threatening activity for stalkers especially in cases like yours where we've chosen to act as if it isn't to be taken seriously. They take it as an insult that you don't care, so they bide their time until they can't help it. When they blow off their top, that's usually when they do something careless and lead us right to 'em!"
Harry groaned in irritation. This meeting was not at all going as planned. All the blond had to say was yes. "One," he said somewhat forcefully than intended while counting out with his fingers. "you are right here next to me and that is close enough. Two," he continued, waving two fingers in front of Malfoy's face, "I care about you and I think the same goes the other way around. Three," and this time he poked his three fingers into Malfoys chest. "Three, not even your stubbornness will prevent me from doing so. I want to protect you and I will."
Harry couldn't help it, he let out a little laugh. "Yes, I did. Not sure for how long, but when I came back, your mum was checking to see if I was alive, and she lied to Voldemort to get to you."
Malfoy cocked his head to the side. "That's true. Less pressure sounds good. I've got enough going on as it is."
"Look at us," Draco suddenly said. "Chosen One and Death Eater Spawn, baking cakes and exchanging baby stories." He used a finger to poke James repeatedly, causing the boy to giggle and squeal out 'Day-co staaaaahp'.
Draco, as always, tucked his lovely wife into bed and went to back to his son's bedside, where he just sat and watched, Scorpius' gentle breathing becoming a lullaby that effortlessly sent him to a dreamless slumber.
She had just signed up for introductory training into the Holyhead Harpies, and Harry indulged her need to talk about it all of the time because it made him happy to see her so excited about it.
Number Twelve Grimmauld Place was dark and austere, but it was where Harry found some of the peace he'd needed. On a whim, he had packed a trunk for both him and James, and announced to Kreacher that they would be staying for a few weeks. The old elf was elated to be serving Harry once again, since he hadn't particularly enjoyed staying at Hogwarts when he knew his Master was trying to manage his own home without his assistance. In just a day, Kreacher had buffed and polished every possible surface of the old Black House, and welcomed Harry and his son with a wide smile and a warm meal, both of which Harry appreciated.
"Albus..." he said, staring in wonder. He looked Ginny again, as if making sure that it was all real. Ginny nodded and Harry saw tears of joy in her eyes. She never cried when she was sad. Just always, always when she was happy.
achieved his privacy by distorting the way people perceived reality. Every single time that he took James out for a walk to the park, anyone he wished to remain oblivious would not sense James in any way. Or sometimes, when Harry wanted to enjoy the experience of being father and son on a nice day out, he would adjust the bindings on both of them so that people would see them and be able to talk to them, but remain ignorant of who they really were. That way, it wasn't so depressing for him, since he got to talk to other parents (mostly Muggles) and allow them to fawn over his own son while he admired theirs. He didn't get to do this often, but he felt much lighter whenever he did, simply because he liked the idea of being normal. More often than not, he had to resort to the full sensory block on James just to be sure.
: (flips confusedly through notes) Oh, er- yes - here's another one. How are you dealing with your recent promotion in the Auror Corps?
Draco couldn't help but snort in amusement as he threw a handful of powder into the fire and watched the flames turn green.
The embrace was sudden, but Draco welcomed his mother's show of affection. Though she was slighter than him, it felt like her slender arms were holding him up and keeping him aloft of his problems. For a terrifying second, he felt sixteen again, helpless and alone. Deep down, he knew that it wasn't the pregnancy that worried him so, but his wife's nonsensical words.
Weasley sighed. "Not sure. The researchers over at Tracking got some information from the cross comparison of the two letters."
Ron was bewildered and looked to Harry for assistance. The latter shrugged. "I just meant, you know, like the whole... I dunno... girls-can-do-anything thing?" he finished weakly, knowing he had dug himself a grave. Ginny looked affronted.
She nodded in agreement and turned back to their Healer. "Will I be allowed to go back to Montreal? I need to be there for the remainder of the month, and then back here to Britain."
And what was the big deal anyway? It wasn't a crime to invite a friend to stay the night, was it? Ron always stayed after too many beers.
In the ensuing muster of the Auror team, no one could tell that the calm and efficient exterior masked a whole other level of chaos within. Harry was a mix of fury and focus, his mind intent on doing nothing but finding Draco and punishing whoever took him.
Astoria rose gracefully and brushed off imaginary specks of dust from her elegant dress robes. "In that case, I shall be off. I do need to be there hours before in order to welcome the delegates. Time difference does change things up a lot."
Harry rested his forehead on one of his hands, hiding his eyes. He felt so tired these past few weeks. "So you only think you know what I called you two here for?"
The image of Gryffindor's Golden Boy cramped into a richly upholstered yet unforgiving loveseat was pathetic enough for Draco to call out for an elf to Apparate Potter into one of the guest rooms on his side of the Manor. When the man blinked out from vision, surely to reappear in a much more comfortable bed, Draco allowed himself to collapse onto one of the lounges.
Harry warmed at the compliment. He had told himself that the house had needed a little life in it, so he liked that Malfoy had used those words to describe how he saw it.
"Leaving soon?" he asked, knowing that she had to be back on the training grounds by sunrise. "Geez, what do they even make you guys do that's so top secret and all-consuming? Maybe I should start recruiting from your team," he said, knowing full well that training for the National team was just as hard, or possibly even worse than Auror training. At least the Corps didn't run their recruits into the ground every single weekday for years. The difference, of course, was that Quidditch players put all of their years of hard work into one big tournament, which to Harry seemed to justify all the effort of training years before the League or even the World Cup. Ginny had the perfect drive for it, he thought silently.
Draco looked at his wife but remained silent. He and Astoria had indeed been forced to reexamine their original marriage plan, since Narcissa had insisted. Indeed, everyone in the wizarding world knew that traditional Purebloods usually had their first children immediately after the marriage. It was the whole point of family alliances, to have the heirs to carry the bloodlines and last name. However, Astoria had never given the impression that she was ready, so Draco had felt no need to broach the subject.
Harry gave an angry huff. "Bring up the rest of the team. Be discreet. I want this case solved by the end of the week, or so help me, I will hunt down Howe myself if he harms the Malfoys in any way."
The joking tone and teasing smirk contrasted completely with the sudden and horrific shock to Draco's system. He was an intelligent lad. He knew to piece clues together, and‚Ä¶
It didn't help that the dining room had reminded Harry too much of 'that fight' in the tent, when their trio had suffered a major drawback and Ron had walked out in the middle of their Horcrux hunt.
"As Minister for Magic," he said, "the power is vested in me to decide whether or not to award Mr. Harry Potter the right to
"I honestly didn't think much of this when I got the summons," Draco admitted. "My curiosity was the only reason I even brought it up tonight."
"I think I may actually believe that," Harry said quietly. James was now struggling in his arms, babbling nonsense and trying to move away from his dad.
It was also a blessing that Potter didn't seem the kind of person to push for information. While Draco sat silently and sipped on his hot tea, the Auror merely leaned back into his chair and waited patiently. Perhaps all the time interrogating criminals gave him enough experience to know when someone didn't want to talk. He could probably wring it out of him, as Draco had already observed once before in the Ministry. He was grateful, therefore, for Potter's quiescence.
For the first time since the tense arrival of Andromeda, Potter gave out a brilliant smile. "Great. I'd be glad to regale you with everything you should be scared of in the next eight months. But-"
Sure enough, when Narcissa ended the spell, Astoria met his eye and motioned for him to finally approach her. She stretched out an arm towards her husband, and he grasped her hand firmly and allowed her to pull him closer.
Harry and Draco already knew that most Metamorphmagi didn't develop the skill to change the more fundamental aspects of their body until after puberty. Teddy, at eight, would be able to change his hair and eye color easily, and some softer parts such as ears and his nose, but it wouldn't be until he was of age for him to be able to change his weight, height or skeletal structure.
"Complain to me, why don't you?" Harry sighed. Hermione looked at him with just the right amount of guilt that he decided to let her off the hook.
Harry repeated to her what he had thought, about Ginny being much better when she was at training. Molly nodded meaningfully.
First of all, Potter had taken all the legal steps to ensure his complete privacy and independence from the Ministry. That had taken the whole wizarding world by storm, causing all sorts of wonder and outrage from all sides. Then there was his defense of Draco and Narcissa. What was that about? Draco thought angrily.
"Were you away all the time, then?" Draco asked. It was the only viable reason he could think of that would push Ron away.
"Well, then, how would you explain this entire affair?" Draco taunted. "I'm sure there was much preparation on your part. So much effort in the last few weeks. Months, even! My own family wouldn't go through so much trouble just to get my attention."
And it was the tone that had always, always, pushed him far beyond his limits to prove to himself that she was mistaken.
He went as far as to talk about the beginning of his engagement to Ginny, but he felt like it was too private to share any more about that, so he focused on the one thing that Malfoy most wanted to hear about: James.
"Of course, darling," Draco said, standing up to kiss his wife chastely. "Have a good weekend, then."
"I can't be sure," Narcissa pleaded. "I can attest to the strength and integrity of the wards, especially now that I have gone through the historical accounts. They're one of the most formidable defenses dating from the twelfth century, and are meant to be, well, impregnable. I know it seems a small detail, but I thought you ought to be informed."
Harry shook his head though. He had way too much to deal with at the moment. "I'm sorry, Teddy, but it's past your bedtime already! You can play with- you can play tomorrow, alright? Go up to your room first and I'll follow you soon enough."
"How could the threat break through the wards, then? They'd have to come from blood relations, or someone specifically keyed into the wards."
Carved into the highly complicated and dramatic life story of Harry Potter was a tiny little corner dedicated to a vain and pretentious blond, wherein he could feel comfortable enough to discuss his fears, insecurities and pretty much every other thing that could have been potentially embarrassing to mention to other people.
"I respect your privacy, Potter," Malfoy went on, "I just have to admit that I don't particularly appreciate being kept in the dark. It's just who I am. So I'd like you to know that yes, I've had an idea that you've kept your godson a big secret from the rest of the wizarding world. Despite your wards, I was able to figure that out on my own."
"That was hands down the cheesiest description of love." Draco closed his eyes. "But‚Ä¶ you sold it well."
Harry placed a hand on her knee and squeezed gently. "I'm glad you're here, and I'm sure our son is, too."
"Okay," Poter nodded. "I'd hate to be rude, but see, I am sort of expecting an important call, and you're blocking my Floo," he finished sheepishly.
"What of your responsibilities as a husband to Astoria? You still have to cater to her needs and whims."
Harry gave a shaky laugh. "I've been telling myself that for a while, Hermione... but I've come to realize that something's... it's just not right anymore."
Harry had no idea where the words had come from but he couldn't take them back. And now that he thought about it, he didn't want to take them back.
He had no idea why this was affecting him so much, but he felt as if the rug was roughly pulled from under his feet, and he had found out that he was fifty feet in the air. He had no idea what to even think. He could handle the Potter that he thought he used to know. He didn't know exactly how to handle this new person standing in front of him, calmly fixing up the table with three steaming cups of coffee.
"He's my godson," Harry supplied quietly. "He's a metamorphmagus, just like his mother. She was your cousin," he said pointedly to Malfoy, who merely nodded."
"She had come to take Ron home, but when she saw that he was alright, she invited herself over as well."
Draco wanted to point out that he hadn't had any noise-related troubles at all since he'd stayed over, but he didn't think it was worth mentioning. Neither did he mull over the fact that he was actually quite enjoying the extended visit. It was a far cry from the occasional drunken Floo cross overs, not to mention the hurried exits before breakfast-
Throughout their cool acquaintance for the first few years after the war, there was no reason whatsoever for either of them to stay updated about their respective relationships. Sure, Draco and Astoria had invited the Chosen couple to their wedding, but that was more for their own benefit and publicity. With the release of Potter's
Of course, he knew the possible repercussions of a successful blood ward because Harry had once told him about the one Dumbledore had invoked so many years ago. If Voldemort couldn't harm Harry back then because of the family blood ward, then Scorpius would be shielded from their as yet unknown enemy.
"In that case, I can understand why she might not prioritize the concept of running a family over her own ambitions. If she's spent most of her life trying to be more than the archetype of the 'Weasley Matriarch', then it's probably subconscious behavior by now," Hermione posited. "We were very close, but she was never outright or direct or aggressive about her desire to prioritize Quidditch over anything else. So I don't think her way of handling these issues are really a conscious decision."
Draco snorted. "Just a bit, wouldn't you say? Although I did appreciate hearing your rather violent rant. I've never felt more special to anyone before."
"It's not what you think," he finally said, taking a deep breath. "I mean, you were right about Teddy, but- but there's something else. I wasn't exactly prepared for this but..."
: Nah, I don't think so, not really. I mean, it's Hermione we're talking about. She wouldn't be herself if she didn't get all into her job. It's just like SPEW all over, it's just who she is, and that's what makes her amazing.
He was being honest with Draco anyway. He really did like the companionship the blond provided. It was a nice balance of carefree and snooty, of sincerity and smugness.
"What?" he asked, alarmed. She was scary when she scrutinized things like that and he had no idea what she was thinking. Especially now that she was scrutinizing
"About?" Ginny inquired, but Harry said nothing. He acted as though he hadn't heard the question. "Should I be concerned?"
There was a protracted silence, during which all Harry could hear was the rain shattering upon the windows.
He wanted to deny that he had ever been caught staring at Draco when the latter wasn't looking. He thought Draco stared back at him some of the time, too, but he didn't try reason why it made him flush with embarrassment and guilt when that happened.
"I forgot!" Harry cried. "C'mon, there's a cafe downstairs that I'm sure you'll love." He led her back into his flat, and after a quick look around his new place, Harry magically locked the front door behind them, feeling ecstatic that everything seemed to be falling into place.
Hermione went into her 'thoughtful' mode. "Hmmm, well I have read about a few masters who were really guarded about their own discoveries that they would use nicknames or abbreviations, or even obscure references. You're right though, using an actual code isn't practical even for the most secretive potioneer, because of the increased margin of error if even one letter were misinterpreted. I'm guessing that just the right amount of obscurity, like maybe using names from another language, would be enough to at least discourage even the nosiest of people."
To Harry's surprise, Malfoy actually laughed. He finally decided to pull down the covers to face his host as courageously as he could.
Astoria, who was already somewhat pale in complexion, was as white as a ghost. Draco even had the theory that she refused to hold Scorpius often so as not giveaway how badly she was shaking nowadays. He had never seen her lose composure before, and it worried him that this entire situation was affecting her in such a way.
"In our sixth and seventh year, Father was bordering on madness, and Mother was beginning to fear for our safety. It was around that time when she would tell me that she felt her husband had gone. I didn't understand what she meant back then, of course, but now I do. He had become a shadow of himself, and he was bringing me down with him.
Dinner had ended just fine after all, with no additional drama. Ron had Apparated Hermione to a flat she was renting, while Harry escorted Ginny to the Leaky Caulron's fireplace, where she promptly Flooed back to her training camp. He then went straight home and began on his study session. That was about four hours ago, and it was getting pretty late, but he insisted on being the best Auror he could be. He had to remind himself repeatedly in the last few months that these weren't just schoolwork, they meant the difference between being an Auror and actually being a good one.
Their testimonies were quite the same, both choosing to provide truths but not giving details when not prompted. This way, they were able to keep a semblance of privacy with the memories that they'd rather remain forgotten. At least that's what Draco thought his mother had done as well. He definitely didn't include everything in his story. If the Wizengamot didn't ask, then they didn't need to know.
"You seem to be more observant," Potter continued. "Or at least you've been sharper than most. You notice things that even I take for granted. You should look into a career in interrogation. You've only been over one night, and already you've gotten me to open up to you embarrassingly about things I don't even tell my best mates."
"Oh, right," Harry said, forcing himself to pay attention. He was being really rude. "No need today though, from what I know, Malfoy's been over already. So at least we know she gets company apart from us." He still thought it was amusing that Hermione and Malfoy had taken to each other quite well.
Well, to Astoria at least. Draco thought he had enjoyed the gala more because he had his little boy to provide ample distraction.
"What?!" Harry felt like he wanted to explode with all the questions now pounding in his head. "Don't you want to spend quality time with him? Don't you want to just hold him and nurse him and bundle him in your arms and have him with you all day and night?!"
"Yes, I did, actually," Harry said with pride, giving his guest a brilliant smile. "It took a bit of talk with Ginny, of course, but she agreed that James Sirius was a great way to honor my father and godfather."
Of course, neither Ron nor Hermione, or even Ginny actually knew about the Sorting Hat story, but it made him feel bad that he couldn't readily open up these small secrets to those who were closest to him.
"You can do that now," said Dream-Malfoy morosely. "I don't think I'll ever want to live through all this."
Astoria let out a quiet sob, perhaps unaware that she had made any noise at all. Draco smoothed his hand against hers, trying to find a way to alleviate her physical tension.
"You still want to go after your dreams, I know," Harry said quietly. "I understand that, Gin, I really do. Even at the worst times, when I miss you terribly, I try my best to understand. But I'm really starting to think that we're working too hard on this, and I don't believe we're working towards the same future anymore."
A Mediwitch appeared out of nowhere and brought the swaddled bundle, laying it lightly into Harry's arms.
"The translation of the translation, you idiot," Ron said, pointing at the words scribbled next to Malfoy's original transliteration.
"No offence, Malfoy, but you're not exactly someone I'd want to see me broken apart in uncontrollable tears."
"Is there no alternative ward, Narcissa?" Astoria asked, siphoning off the dust from the book she was reading using her wand. "Perhaps this one is too much trouble, we might be wasting precious time when there might be another, better one."
He gave a start when his fireplace roared, changed color and indicated that he had a Floo call. Waving his hand to allow it, he clambered closer to the hearth, and seeing his best mate's distraught face.
Signs? Draco was confused. As far as he knew, he and his wife had had a great relationship since they had begun courting. They were about to have their first child. Nothing was amiss, and everything was playing out to his ultimate designs. Well, except for the unlikely friendship with Potter. But that was neither here nor there.
Ron laughed, but grimly. "On the contrary, this stupid list just encouraged me to be more curious, so I guess whoever wrote it failed at that." He looked at Harry again. "So when are we meeting Malfoy? I mean, how is that even going to work?"
"Alright," he said. "D'you mind if I get back to you, then? I don't like leaving the kids for too long. I'll call you back," he promised.
She gave out a deep sigh. "Harry, I wanted to talk to you about something," she said, her tone oddly somber that it worried him a little.
"You're meant to be asleep by now, love," he said quietly, admonishing her as gently as he could. "You're too close to the day, and the Healer did say you'd have to get as much rest as you can."
"She's your sister!" Hermione cried, turning on her husband. "You know perfectly well that she's always wanted to be in the big leagues, how can you take it against her?"
"Fuck you, Ferret," he exclaimed, but without the expected vitriol. "Hah. Nothing like a good insult from you to start the day right, eh?"
"Harry I-" Ginny's wand made a shrilling sound, and she waved it to stop it. "I have to go, Harry, I'm sorry, I have to- I- I'll-"
It also meant that it was the easy way up, and Harry didn't want that. He wanted to work for it, and he wanted to see how far he could take himself without his Savior persona pulling the strings. He had enough pride in him to want to become an Auror in his own right.
"I feel terrible that you still haven't caught up, so why don't I help you a bit?" The kidnapper laughed darkly. "Anyway, it might make this more fun if you knew how long you've been playing the fool, eh? We've got some time alone to talk, you and I, before my partner gets here. Then we'll have some real fun."
Harry laughed. He checked on Ron first to make sure he was still breathing, then went to the kitchen to fetch glasses of water and potions for both him and Malfoy.
"Where's that cake, then?" Draco remembered, simultaneously stretching out the kinks his back had received from falling asleep on the couch. "Are we getting it somewhere, or do you conveniently have a secret stash of sweets somewhere?"
She lazily shrugged her shoulders. "I'm afraid this wasn't part of the plan, but it's a better guarantee, isn't it? He'll never let go now. He'll never find out. He'll never doubt us. There's no need for you to keep pressuring me anymore."
For some reason, Harry felt warmer. He adjusted his position and felt the need to change the subject. "So anyway, er‚Ä¶ with all the drama, have you been able to keep in contact with your friends?" he asked.
By their third event that week, word had already gotten around, and Astoria was joyful at the positive commentary they received for continuing to project a united front as a model pureblood family with a modernized approach to wizarding culture. Several traditionalist diplomats had already approached Draco several times to congratulate him on his success at reestablishing the Malfoy name, while Astoria was celebrated among the society's ladies for being the epitome of a perfect pureblood wife and mother. Local papers and gossip mongers latched onto the introduction of Scorpius to the public world, with nothing but praise for the gentle heir of the noble House of Malfoy.
"Of course not, Weasley!" the blonde exclaimed defensively. "I am merely guaranteeing that all of Astoria's needs and wants are met. After all, I would be highly disappointed in myself if I were unable to fulfill the most basic stipulations of our contract."
She winked slyly at him. "I have no idea what you mean, Harry. I won it fair and square and you know it."
"You forgot the tendency for detachment, isolation and being a hermit," Ginevra added, which made Potter scowl.
"Hermione did that for me," Harry said. Malfoy looked up from the carpet and they stared at each other in silent sympathy. "I mean, after the war. She and Ron stayed here for a bit to keep me company after all the... all the trauma. I couldn't really be left alone for a while."
"Well in that case, you know the drill," she said, handing him over a shrunken trunk filled with all the things Harry needed to care for Teddy. "I've packed more clothes for him, since he went through almost an entire wardrobe the last time he stayed here, all that chocolate syrup on the shirts..." She raised one eyebrow at Harry, and he realized she knew about his bribing him with ice cream. He smiled sheepishly, but Andromeda's smile seemed to hint that it was okay. " I've included some of his favorite books and toys, since he now loves being read to before bed..."
"Yes, we already know that," Hermione interrupted. "The bindings are focused on Harry's magical core but also feeds on those that he places the wards on. There are no practical limitations on the number of the individuals or the distance of these individuals from the focus. Meaning that Ron and I could go to Australia for a year and Harry's privacy wards on us would still be as strong as the first day."
"It's a fact that I can't exactly handle them when I'm by myself, at least not at this point. But I‚Ä¶ well, it's crossed my mind before‚Ä¶ erm‚Ä¶"
Potter's face darkened. "I swear, I don't know if I'm supposed to be happy that the Ministry officials now 'believe' in the MMI's mind mapping system, or insulted that they'd think of using it against us with such a blatant disregard for personal privacy."
"Does this name seem familiar to you?" Ron asked, breaking Harry's reverie. The brunet looked at the ingredient his deputy was indicating with the tip of a quill.
Potter laughed, surprising Draco. He seemed to struggle a bit with his arms, though it might have been because they must be tired from being held up for so long without support.
His wife suddenly turned to look at him, her eyes slightly dazed as if she weren't seeing him. "I'd like to say I'm very sorry, but it doesn't seem quite right if I don't mean it, does it?"
Mrs. Weasley definitely shared Harry's over-enthusiasm that morning, and their breakfast gave the impression that something was definitely being celebrated, albeit implicitly. Harry didn't mind. He was still on a high, and he went through his sausages still with a huge smile on his face.
"How do you even get that idea from such a stupid letter?" Astoria asked after she had read it. The words had sounded dissonant, as if they didn't even go together. Draco waved his hand impatiently.
: All I'll say is that we've been together a while, and we intend to stay together. That's all anyone really needs to know, anyway. Again, next question?
Seeing Astoria in her element, acting as the beautiful and witty diplomat in charge of liaising with the highest levels of wizarding politicians and celebrities, reminded Draco what had attracted him to her in the first place. In fact, Narcissa was right. Perhaps he had allowed himself too much time away from her, which had possibly made him forget that he also had to act the part of her husband. At his point, both sides of their original contracts had already been fulfilled satisfactorily, but he concluded to himself that it wasn't reason enough to stop doting upon her. Especially now that they were all in the shadow of a supposed foe, Draco decided that he needed to take more care of his family.
Draco considered his mother's idea. The Malfoy wards were formidable, but so were the Black Family wards. Maybe those two combined‚Ä¶
"Ginny's back in her element," Harry said matter-of-factly. "She was all out of sorts when she was here. She didn't complain about it in the few months she stayed home with me, but... she just wasn't herself."
"Anyway," Harry had explained, "Teddy will be meeting the Tonkses with Andy, so he'll be Flooing out after dinner. So at least it'll be quieter for you."
"Oh that's right," Weasley added. "I forgot Macmillan got you for that one. Bollocks, that means you still fall under the consultants who've come in within the last year."
"Thought you were Slytherin," the man huffed. "That sounded like an empty Gryffindor threat to me. Maybe that potion's already addled you too much."
Draco sighed. It was one of those times when he felt he was becoming more liberal-minded than he desired. Had he really been neglecting his duties as a husband while fulfilling those as a father?
The witch released him from her death grip and punched him on the arm. Ron walked into the kitchen, sniffing. "Is that Harry's Shepherd's Pie?" he asked enthusiastically.
It was about an hour later, when Hermione was with Teddy in his bedroom, Harry was in the middle of a heated discussion with Ron and Malfoy about the Pince case. All three men were startled from their serious conversation when the Floo suddenly roared to life, spitting out emerald embers in front of the hearth.
When Draco enlisted the help of Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley, he expected them to do their job as thoroughly as they always had.
There was a slight movement from out of the corner of his eye, which Harry instinctively knew to be Draco waving his wand. "What was that for?" he demanded suspiciously.
"I do not mean to speak ill of you nor insult you, Draco," she replied stonily. "I could not help but notice, months ago, that you were so fixated on Scorpius. But after a mere week in France, you have been closing off yourself once more to focus only on Astoria."
"It's hardly the same, Ron," Hermione interrupted. "I was overworking myself, and I realized later on that I wasn't going about my career the right way. Ginny-"
Ron looked flabbergasted, but obviously didn't want to fight with his wife. "It's true though, Herm, look at Harry. He's had to work from home and pass Jamie around my mum and Andromeda just because Ginny can't seem to find roots where her fianc√© is. That's a bit messed up, I tell you."
"Did you consider 'frantic and anxious and worried about stretchmarks and unimaginable pain' to that idea?"
"So, Ron and Hermione couldn't get here immediately... and they sent you to cover for them and keep me company?"
"She'll be away from you again," Hermione pretty much bawled out at this point. "It's sad! It's not meant to be like this!"
"Oh, it will be so odd not to have to fuss over our Harry when there's a particularly nasty crowd around, won't it?" gushed Mrs. Weasley, thinking of those countless times they were harassed for an interview or a photo.
"Are they here yet?" Ginny walked in from the kitchen holding a sleeping Albus. "Oh, hi, Draco!" she greeted warmly, moving closer to give him a peck on the cheek. "And you've brought Scorpius again! Perfect! The others will be here today, too, so be prepared for a full house."
"I'm sorry, Mother," he apologized, now realizing how foolish he must have sounded. "Where is Astoria? Has something happened to her?"
"Okay! Okay! I give up!" the little boy finally gasped, still giggling even though Harry had stopped his assault.
"Harry?" Ron's voice snapped him out of his darkening thoughts. When Harry looked at him, Ron gestured towards the other end of the sitting room, where James seemed to have woken up from a nap.
They had both experienced near-death first hand, so the two of them had the tendency to celebrate the simplest pleasures and find joy in the most ephemeral moments. That was how they were in sixth year, stealing away to snog in dark alcoves, or sitting by the lake and talking of their dreams, punctuating serious heart-to-hearts with a few jokes in between. They never felt the need to cling or nag, since they both had gotten used to the idea that there was so much more to take care of outside of their relationship. Even their breakup didn't bring up negative feelings, because it had been necessary at the time. One of the things he had loved about her was that there was never any regret after the fact, because they had broken up with the utmost understanding of what the other needed to accomplish. Harry was grateful that Ginny had fully supported him during the war, especially during the Horcrux hunt. He remembered how difficult it had been for him to be huddled in his bunk in the middle of the night, Ron and Hermione's steady breathing echoing in their tent. He remembered the ache in his gut while watching Ginny's dot in Hogwarts, he had been so happy just knowing she was still alive.
"I love you, too, Ginny," Harry said quietly. "I've always loved you, in so many more ways that anyone could possibly imagine. I just can't help thinking that we're doing something wrong, for us to have to go through this much..."
Draco wasn't expecting any call, but he couldn't say he was surprised by Potter's head appearing in his fire. It was fast becoming a habit for them to invade each other's privacy at around eleven on the oddest of nights.
To her credit, Hermione did not seem to think any less of him, but gently took the proffered sheets. Her eyes quickly scanned left and right, top to bottom, at a speed that was somewhat alarming to Draco. It was when her entire face turned white that he began to worry.
Narcissa's smile warmed even more, and she eagerly put down her watering can and pulled her son out of the room and towards her wing.
Despite being home for most of the pregnancy and after, Ginny seemed to have pushed herself to become a more present mother to James and Albus. It still wasn't a perfect family, but it was a good compromise that allowed both Harry and Ginny a balance between what they wanted and what they needed.
The Healer gave them a brilliant smile. "I appreciate the trust that you both grant me," she said humbly. "I assure you, Harry, that it's better to do this now that wait for further complications."
Narcissa cleared her throat a bit guiltily, he noticed. "I may have been slightly more persuasive when I spoke with her."
"This ‚Äòthing' that you speak of is my child," Draco said smugly, "future Malfoy heir and new Prince of Slytherin, so show him the respect he is due."
"Oh, he was, of course," Hermione held Hugo closer, moving his head so he could rest it on her shoulder more comfortably. "The thing is, Ron and I were sort of... dancing around some problems at the time." A faint blush washed over her cheeks, and she looked away from Draco. "Harry was the one who shook me up and made me rethink a lot of things then."
Harry knew he meant it as a joke, but he had seriously associated the blonde's calls with a fierce wave of protectiveness.
"Me, name my child?" The very idea was so ludicrous to Draco. "Oh, I see, you're not familiar with this particular tradition either, are you?"
Malfoy laughed. "I think most everyone did. The wizarding folk do not adapt so well or so quickly with any type of change, and apparently you and Weasley just turned everything upside down in the Auror Corps."
"This is a decent enough break," Potter said, shrugging. "It's a sight better than my situation before you got here, anyway."
"I happen to think you still need coffee," Draco countered. He didn't explain that it was he who really needed the kick of caffeine to make sure that none of this was a dream.
Harry shook his head. "I don‚Äôt really fancy any big parties, actually. I'm fucking relieved that Ron and Hermione and Ginny and everyone are away right now, which means I can spend the day how I want to, for a change," he said with a smile.
"I can't believe we're having this conversation," Draco finally said. He wasn't feeling so agitated anymore, just annoyed. "I don't like feeling like you are still trying to control my life."
"I've still got a copy of the files we haven't sent down to Archives," the redhead suggested. "That's really all we can work on. I mean, what were the
"The years I spent at Hogwarts had been a matter of public interest, and I'm sure that the writers over at the Daily Prophet can attest to that." He grinned pointedly at a flushing Rita Skeeter, who gave a shrug. "Everything I did, and didn't, were never mine to keep to myself or share only to those I cared about. Each triumph, humiliation, speculation and condemnation was free for all, and I would wish for all that to end."
The fond tone in Harry's voice made Ginny smile even more. She kissed his cheek and pulled him into a tight hug. "I want to be with you Harry. But the thing is, will you be able to stand having Ron as your brother?"
The week following Scorpius' birth found several changes in the Weasley and Potter households, or at least Harry thought so. Hermione and Ron seemed to have rediscovered something in their relationship and were now much more involved in tending to Rose and Hugo. Harry himself noticed that Ginny seemed to be putting more pressure on herself to play the part of mother to James. That part had affected him strangely, if he were being honest, and after a couple of day thinking about it, realized that it was because he didn't want Ginny keeping his hopes up until the other shoe dropped.
And Dream-Harry and Dream-Malfoy found themselves in an unlikely embrace that was full of forgiveness and acceptance, and Harry suddenly had an epiphany.
"Hey, mate," Harry said, trying to sound casual. "I'm feeling a bit knackered stuck in this office. It's almost 5 already anyway, we can literally just walk out already. In fact, I think I need a pint. Or six. Fancy coming with?"
Harry guffawed and shook his head, before spinning out and landing in his own hearth, feeling much better than he had in a long time.
: Yes, exactly. The previous system was seriously lacking. It all just focused on material evidence, and we all know how that can easily be tampered with. There was so much bias. I saw it happen many times when I was young. I-In my fourth year, the man who had Polyjuiced into Alastor Moody, he tricked me and almost got me killed. We heard his entire plan under Veritaserum, and there was so much information there. He'd had this entirely shocking history, he had so many plans going on that no one even knew about. He could have provided helpful info to the Ministry even in prison, we could have used it to fill in missing blanks about the rise of Voldemort, and the Death Eaters. But Fudge just brought in a Dementor, there wasn't even a trial, and he was Kissed. Just like that.
He walked slowly, as quietly as he could, ignoring the other Healers and Mediwitches who were moving around him. His breath hitched as the Healer pulled him closer to the bed where Ginny lay, holding a bundle of cloth in her arms with a weak smile on her pale face.
He frowned. All Potter's note had said was that they had to go to St. Mungo's, and that he would keep Draco posted, but there weren't any real details. Only now did he realize what Hermione's worried tone might mean.
Ron huffed as he took a bunch of crumpled parchment from his desk. "We've tailed him, used a remote searching charm in his flat for suspicious items, checked in with friends and acquaintances‚Ä¶ There's no discernible pattern. There's no evidence against him. It's odd."
Harry turned to her, recalling that it had been done in utmost secrecy. "It's one of the newer ones developed by the Unspeakables. I completely forgot because it wasn't routine; I don't even think it's
"That's all the evidence we're starting with?" Macmillan asked again. "Not saying it's nothing to go on, but that'll be inconclusive at best."
To be honest, Draco couldn't imagine Potter playing some sort of relationship expert. He had always had the impression that the Gryffindor was socially inept, at the very least. He wondered about what Potter might have said to Hermione to have changed her perspective so much.
The Weasleys were his family, even after his technical separation from Ginny. But he never could find a sense of solitude because he was almost always in the midst of some sort of family gathering.
it was a bloke, alright?" Ron insisted, though sounding sheepish. Harry couldn't help but burst out laughing. He still looked a little roughed up from last night, but the coffee (and potion) seemed to have countered his hangover.
Arthur gently patted him on the back. "They say that she and the baby are stable for now, they're sure of that, at least."
Harry nodded distractedly. Of course Hermione would have a clearcut career plan. He noticed, however, that she never did say 'no'. He pointed it out to Ron.
When Draco heard the doorknob click into place, he turned stiffly towards his remaining companion. The Auror was looking at him oddly, as if wondering what else they had to talk about.
Harry had learned early on to take each day as it came, so he didn't experience sudden life changes like everyone else. Growing up with Dursleys, who were quite quick to change moods for almost no reason at all, he had learned to deal with anything without question. When he learned he was a wizard, he was surprised but obediently followed a gigantic stranger to¬†unknown parts of¬†London. When he found out that some crazed criminal was his godfather, and not quite a crazy criminal after all, he had taken it in stride. When he found out he was a fucking Horcrux, well, he had willingly walked to his own death. Even when he found out about Ginny's pregnancy, he had seen it as just another surprise to accept into his life with open arms. On the contrary, he could see that Ginny dealt with change a little differently. She had barely spoken to him just because she found out he was the Boy Who Lived. It took her another three years just to get over that and finally become comfortable in Harry's presence.
Harry couldn't help but laugh hollowly. "No, it wasn't. But we can't exactly complain at this point."
Hermione took another deep breath, which Draco guessed meant she was having a hard time explaining this in simple terms.
"Of course. We had to wait for the Healers to give her the all-clear, but yes, she must attend an event at Belgium. I'm unable to accompany her because I've got several business meetings here. Whatever is the matter, Potter?"
"Wouldn't expect anything less from the wizarding world," Harry grinned. "At least it'll be something good this time. None of that shite Skeeter got from the Slytherins."
"We've more in common than anyone thinks," Harry answered, thinking back to that one long night he'd had with the blonde git.
"Yeah," Harry assured him. "I've just got a lot of things running through my mind at the moment, you know? But I'm better now, thanks."
Draco nodded. He appreciated that he at least didn't have to spell every single thing out for Hermione to understand.
"Ah, that's half the fun, Draco," Harry hinted mischievously. "Because we'll be making the cake from scratch."
At that very second, Molly met his gaze and started. She motioned for him to come closer, so he crossed the room and settled himself next to her.
The new Mrs. Malfoy was adamant on making their relationship very accessible to the public, and she may be somewhat credited with bringing Draco Malfoy into the spotlight after his low-key life post-war. During their courtship, we were all whisked on their romantic adventure around Europe, and we were privy to the littlest details of their lives. Throughout their long engagement, we observed the support they had for each other, as they pursued their respective ambitions. Now considered one of the most photographed witches in modern times, Astoria Malfoy has made it clear that she has her sights set on Continental Europe and wishes to establish better international relations with foreign societies in order to broaden the presence of the British community beyond our borders. She has already been successful in organizing the most ambitiously far-reaching galas the country has ever known, earning herself attention not only here but also abroad. Of course, her successes are nothing compared to those of her husband's.
- and seemed to think before speaking again. "We can have it sent at breakfast and you can make it a scene before storming out. I will have to follow as I will be dominant in the relationship and I will be forced to comfort you in your distress as it will state in the contract."
"Harry, hmmm, such a lovely name." Draco let his fangs graze against Harry's neck, causing the raven haired teen to shiver. "And you taste heavenly, you must have been made special for me."
There were screeching of the chairs as everyone stood to go out. People were excited... finally there will be some truth and they could choose whom to trust now. Except for six people.
Teddy offered to help them by a spell that was created in future and they radially agreed. He explained them that the spell was a version of Legilimency.
James and Remus were smiling at their friend. Not that they had expected something else, but this was so like Sirius- Always loving the ones that were close to him wholeheartedly. Lily, Hermione, Tonks, Ginny, and Minerva were seen dabbing their eyes to dry the tears and if one paid attention, you could see Narcissa doing the same while being inconspicuous. The elder Malfoy and Snape wore their usual masks of indifference but their eyes were also suspiciously bright.
I'm trying to reduce the mistakes but there will be some, I am sure. So, if you know please leave me the corrections.
Fudge blanched hearing this. Everyone else in the great hall was roaring with laughter. He turned to his side only to see Amelia Bones smirking in his face. Well no help from her he thought to himself. On the other side Weatherby was too busy arranging his parchments that he was unaware of anything. The minister just shook his head and continued to address the staff and the students.
When he stopped, Hermione stood up and held him in hug, Luna joining them. Soon Ginny was joining. Ron looked at them once,
"He's right you know," was heard from the door and everyone jumped but they soon relaxed seeing it was only the Remus and the twins. Remus being the one who talked and twins agreeing with him. "I don't know what Sirius is asking you Harry but we do love you and nothing's going to change that.‚Äù
‚ÄúOk folks, as you have realized, the convict is not guilty. No need to be scared, Chop chop, off to your dinners. That‚Äôs enough excitement for today‚Äù.
The said mad man was fully enjoying himself. He was sitting with his favourite godson (being the only one didn't count) and his best mates. Though one was supposed to be dead and one turned furry each month, he would not want to change them for the world.
Teddy, Rose, scorp, James, lily,Hugo and Albus stood in a circle waving their wands in a complex pattern. Soon there was a triangle formed between them completed a single line connecting James and Albus who were standing opposite to each other. Some people present realised the symbol of Deathly Hallows. Inside the circle which had started glowing as soon as the waving started appeared two figures appearing in their mid thirties. Lily and James Potter had come back to life.
Here Teddy had explained the current situation about why they were here and how to the newly reincarnated couple when James spotted Sirius and Remus. Without a word he went to them and hugged them tightly.
"Don't try, Sirius. I gave up in first year. Harry will always put others before himself, no matter the circumstances," Hermione said as she emerged from the corridor, Ron walking beside her.
"Oh, Harry I didn't even think about that. They'll know that we broke the law," Hermione told them biting her lips.
"Kreacher!" He shouted, and with a pop, there was an ugly looking elf in front of them. "Master called Kreacher. " Said the elf bowing to him so low that his nose was touching the floor.
Realizing that the questions that were supposed to be asked were finished, Kingsley Administereted the counter and released Sirius. As soon as he was relieved from the potion induced trance, Sirius found himself being hugged by a tearful teenager. He hugged him back, sending thanks to the young Metamorphmagus for clearing this with Harry. James and Lily also thanked Teddy silently receiving a smile in return, while Remus was looking proudly at his son.
Modified memories meant that the original were hidden somewhere in mind. So all he'd have to do was find those memories and unlock them.
" Ok. I'll go first. I'm Theodore Remus Lupin , son of Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks , godson of Harry potter, Ravenclaw. And no dad, I'm not a werewolf."
Inside the circle which had started glowing as soon as the waving started appeared two figures appearing in their mid thirties. Lily and James Potter had come back to life.
Mad-eye gave a signal to Amelia Bones, who was equally impressed as him, to take the matter into her hands making her nod. She took the charge by sending the Aurors to the front doors blocking the escape route. This helped to calm the students down.
Next day came too early for Harry and other six people in the ROR. When he came out of the Room he'd been given Sirius was already there. Last day had been a rollercoaster ride for him so when they all reached at ROR he had let Ginny to choose the place. Right now he had time so he started to look around.
He told them about being given a cupboard as room, his starvations, how they neglected him, him wishing for a relative to pick him from there, having no friends, all his chores, anything and everything he could talk about; of course Harry being Harry many of the things were underestimated or left unsaid.
Many said that Harry potter was unusual. Unusual for the wizards too who were not a common knowledge in muggles as they called them. No,being a wizard was different but Harry was something more. As if being the only one to ever have survived the killing curse, he was also a parselmouth and he had a mental connection with the most feared wizard Lord Voldemort.
Amelia Bones was starting to get a headache. At first, she had been skeptical of Ministers‚Äô actions since the Triwizard Tournament, then there were the slender campaigns that were being run against Dumbledore and Harry Potter, Doroles suddenly being appointed as the high inquisitor, the sudden letter that brought them into Hogwarts, some children from future and now this. She knew she couldn‚Äôt do anything with the previous issues, but she was entitled to handle this one. And she was going to do her job with her own method.
Sitting beside him was Harry who couldn‚Äôt be more excited. His Godfather was free and his parents were with him. His day had started bittersweet. Waking up with his family but then having to share the situation at the Dursley's... Oh, he knew, he had to go through it again and this time his parents would be there. Also, there was the addition of the Malfoy's and Snape. And then there was Draco. His family had said it was true, and how he hoped it was! If it were to be true, then he and Draco... Well, let‚Äôs not think about it, for now. But if you ask him, he'd not change this for World.
