"Yes I do. Think of it as an undercover mission. Are you up for the challenge?"
Hayden quickly shrugged off his hand before giving him a response.
"How would you feel about meeting your father today?" Hayden was surprised. He had wanted to go meet him, but technically he already had, and he was nervous. Which made sense considering Voldemort was his father.
"Hayden, I apologize for the way I sounded in the hall. I only want to make sure that you are safe. I know just how capable you are, and believe it or not, I admire you for that. In fact, I was probably a little jealous of that. I didn't mean to sound like I was belittling you in any way. I only wanted to offer you support. I still do, and I just wanted to say that if you ever need anything, I will do my very best to help" Draco apologized sincerely.
Of course Hayden would love to leave this situation and get back to Draco, but he didn’t necessarily want to accept  Viktor’s hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
He didn't realize that Draco had found and was watching him from the end of the book aisle.
Hayden sighed, he was too tired for this.
He hesitantly brought out dinner, knowing what was coming. As he set down the plate in front of Vernon, he tried not to flinch too hard as the man yelled, "WHAT IS THIS! ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US WITH YOUR ATROCIOUS COOKING SKILLS!"
Hayden couldn’t have been more thankfully for this intervention, but now he had one more person to deal with. At this rate, Draco was going to panic and come looking for him.
Harry laid in his bed for a couple minutes. He hadn't heard from any of his friends at all so far this summer. He knew that Ron and Hermione had gone traveling with their families out of the country, but that hasn't stopped them from sending at least one letter.
"Are you not excited?" Tom inquired.
Hayden felt his father's hand come to rest on his shoulder as Voldemort continued on with any other important business that needed to be attended to.
He wandered the store for a couple minutes, wondering what to do next. He was sure that this was the place and yet there was nothing there to confirm his thoughts.
Hayden gave him a weird look.
"What did you do?" Blaise asked Draco, a bit unnerved at the sight of tears streaming down the angry face of the new Slytherin boy.
Once Hayden was calm again, his wings began to dim as they folded themselves back into their hiding spot. Draco admired the faint glow of the tattoo, framing where his wings lay against his skin.
“Now is that any way to talk in front of your senior?” Cedric said, his eyes narrowing as he cornered Hayden against the bookshelves, trapping him there between his arms.
A few days later, during the next Death Eater meeting, Tom had a surprise for his followers, one that Nagini took great pleasure in.
Draco smiled, wishing he could just hug the other before squashing that desire and heading towards the dungeons.
Until next time...!
He would have to see if Hayden was interested in going. It might be nice for him to be able relax at an event that doesn't really hold any importance.
"Oh what do you know, absolutely nothing?" Granger said, her bushy shaking as she vibrated with poorly hidden rage.
As the goblin began the incantation, Harry started to feel a bit dizzy and unsteady on his feet. Suddenly a bolt of pain wracked through his body again and again until he finally passed out from the pain.
Draco didn't really know what to do, he had never had to deal with someone who had nightmares before.
"Can I come in?" Hayden asked as he lightly knocked on the door frame.
he guessed.
No answer.
Hayden groaned as he brought his hands to his face, covering the blush that once again threatened to engulf him.
“We’re going to have to get back up soon for dinner,” Draco mentioned after a couple more minutes of cuddling.
Suddenly, a big spiked something hurled into the rock beside him, causing him to tumble down the small rocky slope. He was quickly able to roll out of the way of the next hit, sitting up to look at the thing attacking him.
"I mean, not really. They've just, been kinda, ignoring me a lot lately. They've seemed to distance themselves from me the past year or so and they haven't written to me at all during the summer. I'm just not sure they still want to be friends with me is all. It's not like I blame them or anything, I have indirectly put them in a lot of danger" Hayden replied with.
"I'm just so happy right now" Hayden whispered, accepting the hug. He looked up at Theo and smiled brightly. His smile must have been contagious, because soon Theo was smiling as well.
"Alright, I guess? I could always be doing better, but, ya know" Hayden said, seemingly resigned to his fate.
"Severus. What brings you into my household. Last I remembered, you wanted nothing to do with me" the brown haired man said.
Deciding he looked fine, he turned back to the boy still sound asleep in their bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
As soon as Hayden reached the seventh floor, he heard someone call out his name. Snapping his head around, he could just see blonde hair dashing around the corner before he heard him call out again.
Soon enough, Hayden was packing up to go back to Hogwarts.
"Come on Sev, move back in, and we can all be a happy family again" Tom said, giving his husband puppy eyes in hopes to persuade the potion master into coming back to Riddle Manor.
want'?" Draco mocked, irritated that he has to deal with these two imbeciles. "Get out of my way"
we can talk and not be disturbed” the Hufflepuff said, glaring at the other boy.
"Would you like to have the block and whatnot removed?" the goblin asked. A teary eyed Harry looked at Severus once before turning back toward the goblin, (that they had forgotten he was there) and nodded.
Hayden was currently curled up on the couch, shivering ever so slightly. Tom was worried. He had a feeling that this reaction had something to do with the mate that his boy refused to name, but he didn't know what situation could warrant such a response.
"He has been going to Hogwarts and is going into his fourth year there. He had a glamor spell put on him and many others of the like. You know him well in fact" Severus gently said.
"We are going to Gringotts. You will see why tomorrow, now, back to bed" Severus said leading Harry back to his bed. He stayed with Harry until he fell asleep, then went back to own his room and got ready to go to bed himself.
"Sure, what is it"
"I was Harry Potter," Hayden repeated quietly, looking anywhere other than his supposed mate.
"It's okay, I'll keep your secret. I'm glad you finally seem happier! Good luck with Draco!" She said in her gentle voice before skipping away and out of the store.
Hayden soon deducted that his room was at the end of the hall, seeing as he hadn't come across his name yet. Soon enough, though, he found it but when he saw who he would be rooming with, he felt his face flush a slight pink colour.
Harry couldn't have asked for a better friend!
Tom reached out and brought Hayden into his side. Transfiguring a couch pillow into a thick blanket, he covered his shivering son. Before he knew it, Hayden had fallen asleep against his side.
“Fine I guess, why?” Hayden asked back with an air of caution, ever so slightly curious as to why she would care.
Harry smiled slightly when he saw his friend, probably his only real friend.
"Dragons!" Draco half yelled when it was announced what the champions would be facing.
His hair had grown an inch or two, hanging just above his shoulders and seemed to be even blacker than it was before, the shade a sharp contrast to the glow of his wings. His eyes had changed as well, instead of being an emerald green, they now shown gold. The only green left was the flecks that spotted his now gold irises.
After a minute, Hayden finally opened the door. When Draco walked in, the first thing he saw was sad Hayden wrapped up in blankets in a ball on his bed. Draco couldn't help but think he looked adorable!
Hayden was sitting at the breakfast table when Tom gave Hayden his first mission.
Draco was miserable and almost downright depressed. His Veela was tearing him up inside for practically crushing the one he loved and then never making up for it. It's not like he hasn't tried to mend things between them though, he just can’t find Hayden!
He didn't hear anything so he quietly opened his door all the way and silently made his way to the bathroom.
"Yes, he is my child" The man said.
Draco couldn't help the smirk that graced his features when he saw the new boy standing in the doorway. He looked like an adorable tomato.
After a couple minutes of struggling to climb out, he finally made it to the top where the egg was.
Draco sighed as he grumbled under his breath. Hayden gave him a sympathetic smile as the blonde gathered his things and moved tables.
Lucius couldn't help but feel like he knew this person.
"How could I forget?" he asked himself in exasperation.
The first task has begun.
"So, what happened then?" Hayden asked, a bit confused.
"I'm Hermione Granger, it's nice to meet you. We heard rumors that a new fourth year was on board and we wanted to meet you before you got sorted" the bushy haired girl greeted. She smiled at Hayden, who only raised an eyebrow in slight annoyment, before elbowing Weasley who stood a bit behind her.
"And where are you going?" Pansy, who was sitting next to him and Blaise, asked.
“Who did you tell?” The raven insisted.
A name flew out of the cup and landed into the Headmaster's hands. He mumbled the name to himself before saying it louder.
Hayden peeked out from behind the bush to try and find the other people. After a moment, he found the three people whispering in the other side of the room, slightly behind one of the two bookcases. Hayden briefly wondered how the three didn't notice him enter the room.
Hayden stayed quiet, not wanting the others in the room to be able to recognize any part of him, even his voice. He was glad that Tom hadn't revealed that he was a boy. He had a suspicion that everyone probably thought he was a girl by the way he was dressed, and he'd rather keep that illusion than tell them who he was. He'd rather not trust them with that type of information, yet anyway.
It was the warmest room he had ever been in, which was an amazing comfort! Ever since he was rejected, he's been growing colder and colder, and honestly he had been feeling rather lethargic for a couple days now, so the room was a godsend.
“As soon as you want, love” Draco said, giving his now happy mate a kiss on his forehead.
In the cell laid a man with scraggly, dirty brown hair and scrawny, thin arms holding his head up off the ground as he shivered in his sleep.
Once she walked out of the kitchen, Harry hobbled over to the list on the floor and slowly picked it up. Once he had the list in his hands he stuffed it into his pocket and headed out into the dinning room.
After hearing Vernon yelling, Harry quickly gathered the plates and brought them to the dinning room where his uncle Vernon, aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley were all sitting.
“The Weasel. Who Did He Tell?” The raven enunciated, his annoyance starting to shine through in the form of anger.
"No, nothing is wrong but we do have some people for you to meet" Severus told him.
After making sure that the man wouldn’t wake up prematurely, he levitated him out of the cell and up the stairs and through the mansion until they came to the guest room that Tom gave Hayden permission to use.
"Follow me" the Goblin said pointedly at Harry.
"Hello" Hayden said cautiously after a minute of silence, but as soon as the word left his mouth he was engulfed into a bone crushing hug from his father.
"Draco, i'm not,... We've k-known each f-for a couple years n-now" Hayden stuttered, hoping that this all turns out well.
He was looking forward to learning again, something not many people would agree with. Maybe Hermione, but he didn't really care. And that was what he wasn't looking forward to. Seeing people, especially the idiots in Gryffindor and Slytherin.
"Now, you've waited, you've wondered, and at last the moment has arrived. A moment only the four of you can appreciate! Barty, the bag"
"You were asleep for a little over two days" Draco told him, "It's the middle of the night now"
"What do you mean?" Draco asked, taking a wary step back from the other, so he could watch the bi-colored eyes.
Hayden hummed in acknowledgement as he looked through the barred window in the first door. After a couple rooms, he finally found a sign of possible life in the third door on the right.
The little room got crowded fast as more and more people showed, the only light in the room was blue from the magical cup.
Without further ado, please enjoy this extra long chapter, curtesy of the long wait!
Hayden watched the two Gryffindors go, some of the tension weighing him down lifted from his shoulders.
He had plenty of outfits to wear, both dresses and suits. He looked through the suits he had, but just wasn't in the mood to wear any of them so he turned to the other side of his closet where his dresses were.
"Mmm...'bout what?" Draco asked as he put an elbow on the edge of the tub in order to prop up his head easier.
But instead of the anger he was expecting, he found the man was also crying, but he looked at him with a loving smile on his face.
He took a step backwards, finding his chair again and sitting down.
"Come on Hermione. He's not worth our time" Weasley muttered before dragging Granger away with him.
I'm finally circling back to the flimsy plot line I introduced forever ago, lol!
"Alright. I'll be waiting in the common room for you" Draco said, feeling a bit rejected.
“Who else knows?” he demanded quietly.
Draco quickly got up from his bed and made his way over to his roommate to see what was wrong. When he saw that Hayden was still asleep, and by the obviously pained expression on his face, he was having a nightmare.
“It’s good to be back...” Draco murmured before leaving the bathroom with the rag still pressed against his cheek.  He walked to the Boy’s sleeping quarters. They were mostly empty as most of the Slytherins had either joined Voldemort, dropped out, or been killed. Only a few remained. Draco chose a bed and sat down on it.
Narcissa sighed, “it gets lonely you know? All alone in that manor.”
“You’re wondering why I’m here?” His mother guessed, and it was a bloody good guess because she was spot on. Draco response to the question was a short nod.
He went to the bathroom to do the same to his teeth. He cleaned them until they were pearly white. Brushing and brushing, flossing and flossing, until he spat blood from his gums.
A slight glimmer caught his eye and he looked towards it. There was the charm, still bright and shining. With a sigh he started towards it and bent over to pick it up. It felt cold in his hands, it was comforting against his bruises. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to remember the past.
The smell of flowery brews filled Draco’s nostrils and he sighed. It was comfortable behind the counter in his shop. He felt like he could truly be calm here. Even when people lined in front of the cash register. It was calming, he had something to focus on. Something other than the past.
Dear, Malfoy
Both of Harry’s friends looked at him as if they had just been kicked. Harry knew he shouldn’t have snapped but he couldn’t take it. He didn’t even talk to Draco and his friends were already upset.
Harry was always far too late or far too early… If only Draco had known that sooner. He wouldn’t be sitting in his flat throwing up with fear. He wouldn’t be haunted with visions of his past. Harry could’ve saved him. But it was too late for that. He just wished he’d come same him now. Because he definitely needed it.
It had been a week since Draco had gotten his first mystery letter. Since then there had been no other writings or trinkets. Just him, his boxes, and the odd charm in his pocket. The questions still rung in his mind. Who wrote the letter? Why did they write it? How long have they been waiting to contact him? Those questions were pushed down and far away.
“Your father has work. He’s trying to rebuild our name.”
He spent the rest of his morning curled over the toilet, throwing up. By time he was done his skin was pale and dehydrated. The sound of a letter being pushed under his door shook him from his worries. He quickly splashed water on his face and wandered out to the living room, this time eager to have something to do that reassembled routine.
“I wasn’t exactly looking for your forgiveness, Weasley.” Draco couldn’t help but let his voice slip at the end. Not dating? The golden couple had broken up, how was that his fault? “Seems like a personal matter to me, now please leave me alone. I don’t need to know who your snogging and who you’re not.”
“As much as I appreciate the gesture, Mother. I could not ask such things of you. I would prefer to stand on my own two feet and take care of myself.”
Harry crawled into one of the beds and pulled the blankets over him. He tried to fall asleep, hoping he wouldn’t wake up screaming as he did sometimes.
He shouldn’t have come back... but Hogwarts was his home. Even after all that’s happened, he couldn’t bring himself to just leave. So, he picked himself up and he marched through that door. And the moment his eyes met potter’s; he immediately regretted his decision.
But Draco shakes his head and starts collecting plates instead. They clear the table and clean up the kitchen together in companionable silence and despite not having been forgiven it is the best that Draco has felt in a while. It is okay not to be forgiven, he hasn’t forgiven himself yet, so why should anyone else? With Harry’s friends it felt exactly like Mrs Weasley has just said. They have been eager to forgive him, because they needed to leave the war behind. They aren’t really interested in him or his feelings, in how he is coping with all of this. And, of course, they don’t need to be, it’s okay if it makes them feel better. But with Mrs Weasley he feels taken seriously, like it matters what he did, what has been done to him, that he still hurts. Not forgiving him validates his pain. It makes him feel less of a nut job and more like someone legitimately suffering after going through something horrible.
Draco left the kitchen and walked quickly through the downstairs rooms, checking whether he had forgotten anything, but everything looked as if the invasion of toddlers had never hit. He smiled when his gaze fell upon the small mountain of presents that James had received. There were still some unopened presents in the hall closet, because James had been completely overwhelmed and Draco had had to stop the handing over of gifts at some point.
“I swear, Malfoy, I only brought him home,” Harry cries a little breathlessly, but Malfoy doesn’t listen.
“Mhh?”
“Harry,” he slurs as his cock gives a final twitch, gushing out more come between them, and it is all it takes to send Harry over the edge as well. He releases his lip, as his cock pulses violently inside Draco for what feels like minutes.
and just the thought of that word again makes him fume with rage. How dare he? Draco isn’t stupid, he knows that no member of the Wizengamot in his right mind would ever let Draco make any decisions of his own in the state he is in right now. For the whole time he has spent at JTW, he has known that he must have a legal guardian, but he has always figured that it would be his mother or his aunt Andromeda. Or some old sod from the Wizengamot or maybe even one of his former teachers. But Potter? How dare he apply for his guardianship without even talking to him about it. Or at him for that matter. Again, it hits him how inconvenient his silence is at times. How come it hadn’t occurred to him when he stopped speaking. And when he sees Potter’s stupid face he opens his mouth, about to shout obscenities at him, when he realizes that at this moment Potter certainly isn’t worth his words. So, he shuts his mouth with an audible klick and glares at him.
“No, Mr Potter,” he says in between fits of laughter, stumbling against one of the chairs that are grouped around a large dining table just next to an impressive kitchen island.
“You are,” Draco mumbles against Harry’s throat.
“Draco,” he breathes, Malfoy’s eyes fluttering closed at the sound of his name on Harry’s lips, letting it wash over him like a verbal caress. “Get up,” he commands and Malfoy complies almost instantly. “Show me your bedroom.” Malfoy just turns and walks toward a door on the right side of a small hallway. Harry can barely believe that this is happening. How is Malfoy just going along with this? Malfoy opens the door and enters the room, leaving it open for Harry to follow. Harry does, closes the door and throws up a quick silencing spell just to be on the save side.
“Do shut up and put that cock inside me,” Harry orders him. Draco increases the pressure on Harry’s hole and slips inside, both of them hiss at the sensation of being so intimately connected again. Harry is still loose from before, so he buries himself balls deep in one swift motion.
“What?” Draco asked, having lost his train of thought.
“We made him,” Draco breathed in wonder.
“You know, now that you have ruined me for other men, you might want to consider calling me Harry,” he says. Draco blushes an attractive shade of pink, but still refuses to meet his gaze.
It gets harder and harder to leave the Manor with every visit. Potter says that he wants to leave about twenty times, before Draco gets up from the sofa reluctantly and kisses his mother goodbye. When they are back at St. Mungo’s Draco feels down. He sits on his bed, head bend, looking at his hands. He feels the matrass dip beside him, when Potter sits down next to him.
Draco thinks viciously and keeps glaring at Potter.
“I don’t want any of us to die,” Harry replied quietly, his voice sounding haunted.
“I – you –
They start easily enough and he manages to keep his face impassive, even though he feels violated. What is your name? – Draco Lucius Malfoy. When were you born? – 5 June, 1980. Who are your parents? – Lucius Abraxas Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy, née Black. Where were you born? – At Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire, England. What is your favourite colour? – Green.
They stare each other down for a couple of moments, before Malfoy abruptly spins on his heal and walks towards a cupboard in the extensive living room. He gets out a bottle of doubtlessly very expensive firewhiskey and sits down on the large beige sofa, taking a sip.
“No,” Potter says, nearly tripping over his trousers when he tries to step towards Draco. He bends down and pulls his pants up roughly, wincing slightly as his boxers scratch over his still sensitive cock. Draco retreats even further, glaring at Potter.
“It makes it easier and it also gives you more control. This way you can pull away any time you want to, decide on how deep and in which angle I’m penetrating you,” he explains. This position also grants him the chance to hold Potter in his arms while he fucks into him. “It will also be more comfortable while we wait for my knot to go down.”
“She is going to be beautiful. I can’t wait to meet her.”
“It wasn’t like what we just did,” he says blushing deeply. “The gardener at the manor had hired a new help and he had struck my fancy and obviously noticed it himself. He came onto me one evening and I thought he wanted me, but in the end, he only wanted to get a leg over an ex-Death Eater.” Harry pulls him close, tucking his head beneath his chin.
“Shhh,” he soothes. But Harry tenses up again.
Harry has almost drifted off, when he hears Draco speak again. “I don’t want you to pity-bottom for me,” he says quietly.
“That bad, huh?” Harry asks and the concern has returned to his voice and this time it is real. Draco nods, leaning on Harry even more.
It is when his hands fly to the front of Potter’s jeans, rip them open and curl around his throbbing cock that he is suddenly shoved back. Hurt flashes across his face. Doesn’t Potter want this after all? His body certainly does. He looks disheveled, flushed, pupils dilated with desire, he is panting and his cock sticks hard and leaking out of his torn trousers. Draco stumbles back but Potter holds him at arm’s length, refusing him his retreat. His hurt and confusion turn into anger. How dare he refuse him? How dare this prat take this away from him? The only thing that has made him feel anything for the past months and the Prat decides to take it from him.
“I feel better, now,” Potter says shakily and they both know he is lying.
“Look how wet you are for me, Harry. Like the good little omega that you are.” Potter moans loudly at the praise, bucking his hips upwards towards Draco, ensuring that Draco’s fingers slip between his messy, wet cheeks on his way back down.
It is after the war that Draco stops speaking. It is not a conscious decision or something he notices right away. Because in the beginning no one really speaks. They don’t need to actually verbally communicate to know what they are all feeling. They are terrified. It is written into their faces so plainly that any contemplation becomes void. There are no words to describe what they have been through, so they stay close instead. They don’t hug, they don’t cry, they are Malfoys after all. They do, however, drink a lot of tea. Well, he and his mother do, his father drinks firewhiskey. Who can blame him?
“Was that five minutes?” he asked, exhaustion colouring his voice.
“You weren’t prepared for it, were you?” he asks and Potter nods again. “I’m sorry. It must be awful.” Potter buries his face back into his hands, sobbing freely now. He is miserable. From what he looks like, he has been in this room for a while. The cloak beneath him is soaked through with slick, the way his whole body is trembling tells Draco that he has been in heat for a while already. Has Potter been in class yesterday? He cannot remember. He grows impossibly harder at the thought of Potter hiding his heat alone in an abandoned classroom, hoping that nobody will find him and maybe also hoping, even if it’s just for the briefest moments, that someone will come and help him through it.
“That I have ruined you for other men.” He inhales sharply at the unexpected words and nearly chokes on his own saliva when he starts laughing at the same time. They joke around for some time, trading half-hearted insults and sloppy kisses before they fall asleep.
Harry chuckled quietly.
“What can I do?” Harry asked.
“Have you ever done this before with another man?” He is met with silence, Malfoy is holding his breath and waiting.
“Harry is not as strong as he may seem to you. He has been through so much. Has he told you about his family?” Draco nods. “Have you noticed how until this day, he isn’t really aware of how bad the abuse really was?” He nods again. “I hate these horrible people. They tried to beat the wizard out of him, so to speak. Then his only ever real father figure, his one shot at a real home, dies only two years after he has met him for the first time.” Draco looks at the floor, ashamed that it was his aunt who was responsible for the death of Harry’s godfather. “He has never had anyone for himself who really loved him.” And now he can hear her sniffling. His eyes sting as well. He has heard some of this from Potter by now and even though he has been furious at times about the way he has been treated, it is true that Potter himself doesn’t really have a grasp of how bad it was. And it sounds so much worse hearing it from Granger than hearing it from Potter who’s always seemed detached and unaffected to a certain degree.
“Hands and knees now, Potter,” Draco growled.
“Are you going to be sick?” Well, is he? Probably not, but in the end, who knows? He shakes his head. Harry tightens his hold on Draco. “Are you ready to apparate back?” Another nod and he his swept away. He doesn’t, however, handle the familiar sensation of apparition too well today. As soon as his feet touch solid ground again he stumbles a couple of steps out of Harry’s reach and braces himself with one hand against the dirty wall of the dingy alley that accommodates the St. Mungo’s Apparition Point. A fierce wave of nausea rolls through him, making saliva pool in his mouth. He heaves a couple of times, but thankfully the food stays where it is.
“I don’t know… I just… I don’t… I think you’re hot, okay?” Harry snaps after choking on his words for a couple of seconds.
“I love you, Draco,” he whispered again and again.
“He does?”
“You need to be knotted,” he states, but Potter shakes his head.
“I believe that when I see it. The healers say it’s only a thirty percent chance of the baby being a girl. I vote boy.” Draco expected Harry to keep bickering, but instead he said, “Can you believe it? We could be holding our daughter in our arms as soon as tomorrow.”
“It’s going to be a boy?” Draco said, voice slurring with fatigue.
“Merlin, Potter,
“No, I’m serious. I really am glad.” She falls silent for several moments before she speaks again. She looks into the distance as if she can still see it before her eyes. “It was bad after the war. He drifted. We worried about him a lot. He broke up with Ginny, quit the Aurors, didn’t talk, apparently didn’t sleep, because he looked like shit. Seriously. He was seriously depressed and sometimes he had these intense panic attacks. Don’t get me wrong he isn’t fine now, but I feel like he is getting there.” Well, good for Potter then, he thinks, but what’s he got to do with any of this.
“I don’t know, we might have to wait a few hours to find out,” he answers. Harry looks put out by Draco’s answer.
“Get those out of my sight, right this instant,” Draco snapped.
“Okay,” she said, rubbing her hands together, eyes twinkling like an evil mastermind. “What do you need me for?”
“The argument still stands,” Harry retorted and brought some space between himself and his husband, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
“Are you going to stop torturing me?” Again, a nod and a small smirk. Potter chuckles, pulls Draco into a weird side hug and kisses him on the side of his head roughly.
“I mean you’re a very attractive man, Mr Potter, sir, it’s just don’t you think I’m a little young for you?! And also, what would Albus say if he knew?” Scorpius rambles. Harry freezes on the spot, opening and closing his mouth a couple of times, like a fish out of water. The realisation of what Scorpius thinks this is hits him like a bucket of ice being dumped over his head.
“Who are you trying to kid here? I can see that you’re hard, I can see how turned on you are just by the thought of having him. Stop denying it and just admit that the Saviour is nothing but a creep, a pervert lusting after boys not even half his age. You are–“ But Harry doesn’t get to hear what Draco thinks of him, because before he even knows what he is doing he blurts out, “I thought he was you!” They fall into shocked silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Give me two days,” she said matter-of-factly.
“You’re full, aren’t you?” she asks softly and he shoots her a pathetic helpless glance before he nods hesitantly. “Well, you’ve packed it away like a prize eater so, there’s no need to be embarrassed. You can stop eating now.” He freezes, fork half-way to his mouth, looking at her uncertainly. Is she having him on? Or can he really and safely stop eating now? Maybe she is just searching for a reason to hate him. She probably already does and now wants to torture him. They stare at each other for a couple of moments while Draco further contemplates if he can really lower the fork now or if he would be committing a terrible faux-pas should he do so.
His hands fly to Potter’s shirt. A couple of buttons go flying as he yanks at it, desperate to get Potter naked as fast as he can. He moans into Potter’s mouth when he feels the feather light touch of his fingertips as they make their way beneath his shirt. He breaks their kiss, kissing along Potter’s jaw and down his throat instead and then kissing every inch of skin he can reach. All the while, Potter fumbles with his buttons, releasing one at a time and when he has reached the last one, his hands roam over Draco’s torso and then into his hair and he pulls Draco up, into another fierce kiss. For all his playing hard to get, he wants this just as much as Draco does and they both groan when their bare chests finally touch.
“Yes, thank you.” They are quiet for a few minutes, before Draco joins him at the table, placing a large mug of steaming coffee in front of Harry, purposely avoiding his eyes as he does so.
“Draco?” Scowl.
“Yes? Here,” came the answer from somewhere he couldn’t see.
“I know what it is like to face up to the high expectations of your family,” he says and gives Draco a sympathetic smile. “I’m not gonna lie, you were the absolute worst.” He winks at Draco and chuckles quietly. The days of the scared boy he once was are obviously over. “Only ever surpassed in assholedom by Snape, but I get it. I do. I would have done anything to please my grandma. I tried to prevent Harry and the others from getting the philosopher’s stone. Well, I didn’t actually, I tried to prevent them from sneaking out and cost Gryffindor more house points. I worked my butt off in Dumbledore’s army and went to the Ministry to fight to save Sirius Black. I fought the Death Eaters you let into the school. I let the Carrows and their cronies beat the living shit out of me for defying them again and again. And in the end, I chopped Voldemort’s fucking snake’s head off.” He counts off every deed on his fingers. “I didn’t do any of these things because I wanted to, but because I needed to. I had no regard for my safety or my life because that’s how much I fucking needed my grandma to see me. I wished for my parents to see me, but that was never going to happen. So, what I’m saying is, I do get it. Why you did what you did.” Draco nods, unable to even begin understanding why everyone is so keen on forgiving him. He can only imagine the kind of conversations Harry must have gone through to get his friends to come here. He cannot imagine, however, what he had to do to get them to be friendly.
On the other hand, what exactly is Malfoy doing here talking like that, does he
It’s another couple of weeks before everything turns to shit. During this time, they still visit different sights and Muggle attractions, they go to the Manor and to the cinema almost every week, but now Potter chooses the movies most of the time. Draco doesn’t try to get into Potter’s pants anymore, even though he still wants to. His recovery doesn’t make any progress, except that he still writes into his notebook. He puts it under his pillow at night, because he isn’t ready to share his thoughts with anyone. He thinks about talking a lot in these weeks. Twice he has opened his mouth and then closed it again during his therapy sessions changing his mind last minute. He still wants out of the Janus Thickey Ward, but he doesn’t feel ready. He is still too scared of the outside world and of what is buried deep inside himself, all those memories, thoughts and emotions that he has chosen to lock away. He still feels like he wouldn’t survive confronting all of that.
“In the kitchen,” she called and as soon as Scorpius had dusted of the soot from his impeccable shirt, he pulled him behind himself into the kitchen. Hermione was already busy making tea for them, three mugs lined up on the counter next to the kettle.
Granger talks at him the whole time, but fortunately she doesn’t ask any more about his and Harry’s fight. She sticks to the same inane stories that Harry used to tell him when he first started visiting.
His legal
He gets up from the bed and starts pacing through his room angrily.
“Oh, shitting fuck,” he groaned. “I hate my fucking life.”
so good. He explores Potter’s mouth with his tongue, committing every sensation to memory. His hands roam the other boy’s body, wanting to feel every inch of him. For this is pure perfection and also very much the only time he will ever experience it.
“You know why I love my job, Harry?” she had asked Harry, obviously not expecting a reply as she answered her question almost immediately. “Birthing is a natural process. Basically,
That was why today Harry really began to worry when Draco went quiet. Luna had been at their place for roughly two hours. When she arrived, Draco had still been ranting and cursing and being rightfully obnoxious. Harry granted him that. There was no way he could comprehend what Draco was going through, so he could take it.
“Oh God, Draco,” he sobs as waves of pleasure surge through his body, making his arms shake from the strain of holding his body up, as blackness threatens to take over from the edges. Finally, his arms give way and he ungracefully collapses on top of Draco, smearing his come between them, panting like he has just finished a marathon, overwhelmed by the fact that he has very nearly passed out from fucking Draco Malfoy.
“What was I supposed to do?” Potter repeats.
“I think that is dealt with,” Harry says thoughtfully, closing his eyes as if he is listening in on his body. When he opens his eyes again, he nods curtly, confirming that his heat has passed.
“Mr Potter, how nice to meet you here.” Even in his state of advanced inebriation he is the picture of perfect manners. His father must be so fucking proud.
“Perfect,” Draco answered. Harry stepped up behind him, rested his chin on Draco’s shoulder and slung his arms around him. Now that it had been roughly one and a half years since the twins’ birth, Draco wasn’t overly sensitive about his soft stomach anymore, but still Harry made no attempt to touch him there. Draco had been insufferable after both pregnancies, but Harry had borne it with the patience of a saint.
“It is. It’s way harder than anything I have ever done,” Harry replied, still kissing Draco gently.
“Okay,” Harry whispers, “I want you to knot me.” Draco pulls back, so that he can get a good look at Harry’s face. He brushes a few strands of his hair out of his face, where they had been plastered on his damp forehead.
“Do you want to?” he asks instead. The look that Potter gives him tells him that he has never anticipated to have a choice here.
“I could kill him for you.” Draco snorts.
“I haven’t figured out what I’m going to do next, really. I mean I could do anything, literally. No one would refuse the Golden Boy, would they?” he smirks again. Draco rolls his eyes and once he realizes what he has just done, he feels mortified. Potter the Prat has just drawn the first reaction to another human being in, well, however long it takes for his hair to grow this long, out of him. And he seems quite pleased with himself. Fucking Potter.
When he has finally gained composure the thought hits him that Schmendrick and Potter are talking about him. He most certainly can’t have that. He gets up from his chair and slowly walks out of the common room in search of them. He finds them in the hall, next to Therapist Schmendrick’s office. He ducks behind a corner and listens in on their conversation.
“I don’t know,” he says honestly. No one has been more surprised by his manifestation than he himself. He knows what a coward he is. He doesn’t fit the typical alpha physical traits either. He is still slim and fair and doesn’t compare to the brutish built he knows many alphas to have. Except maybe for his cock.
After about an hour the prat falls silent and then it takes about another half hour before he startles Draco by saying, “By the way, Theo turns out to be quite the softie.” He chuckles to himself and then continues, “He had the whole clan against himself, that is until they realized that he is basically a lovesick puppy.” He laughs again. “It was quite funny to see how one after the other started to accept him. It probably doesn’t hurt that he hasn’t fought in the war. He hasn’t done anything that can’t be forgiven.” Hurt flashes through Draco’s eyes.
Potter looks feverish with a light sheen of sweat covering his flushed skin. Parts of his hair stick up in every direction while other parts are pasted to the damp skin of his face, making it look even worse than usual. His eyes are red rimmed and tear tracks are running down his cheeks. He buries his face in his hands, shaking all over with sobs wrecking his body, before he looks back up at Draco.
“Hey Drake,” the Prat says and flings himself into the chair opposite of him. Draco scowls at him.
“Trust me,” he says when Draco raises a questioning eyebrow at him and then pulls out again so that only the tip of his cock remains inside and thrusts in with more vigour. When he hears Draco’s broken moan again, he knows that he is at the right angle, nailing his prostate at every upward stroke.
“Yes, very much so. During our therapy sessions he slips away completely. But when you talk to him he listens. And sometimes he reacts, if not verbally. I think, it might be beneficial to his recovery if you came around more often. Maybe once or twice a month. Or even more often if it suited you. Whenever you can make the time.” Oh, very nice, fucking theraprat. Now he is going to be stuck with Potter the Prat and his stupid Saving-People-Thing. He wonders if Schmendrick knows how Potter won’t be able to deny him if it means that he might be able to save Draco.
Draco is painting some obscene painting that leaves very little to the imagination, while Potter tries to tell him some story about his house elf which Draco doesn’t pay any attention to, because it is really hard to comprehend it, when his balls feel heavy and achy and that Potter keeps trailing off doesn’t help either. He cannot believe his luck, when Schmendrick peaks his head through the door asking to speak to Potter for a few minutes.
“Happy belated birthday, Dad,” he says and kisses Draco on the cheek. “I hope you like your present.” He looks up at Harry and winks. Draco splutters. Harry nearly chokes on his coffee.
this be real? Surely someone would have bothered to come here and inform him in person instead of letting him find out by himself. Has his mother been informed? Is she okay? Well, of course, she is, because this has not happened. His father isn’t dead, because he can’t be. This must be a mistake. Or… or a dream. Yes, that must be it. This is nothing but a nightmare and surely, he is going to wake up any second now.
No. He didn’t make it halfway through his dinner of meatloaf for one before he succumbed to his curiosity. With eager hands, he tore open the envelope, cracking the wax in the process. He pulled out the soft paper and looked it over. It was the same handwriting as last week.
He stepped up to the door and flipped the sign from Closed to Open. The crowd behind him seemed to shift eagerly, which made Draco feel all too nervous as he unlocked to door and stepped in. A horde of people followed behind him.
His dishes were washed and dried before being put away. He currently only had a few dishes out, most of his cabinets were empty due to the lack of unpacking. But today that changed, he set his mind to it.
Draco sat with his legs crossed, sipping on a mug of coffee as he flipped through the paper. He had been looking for jobs that pay well for a while. Seeing as he was a former death eater, not many would be willing to hire him.
It was easy to forget the past when he simply had no time to remember it. That all seemed to suddenly change though.
What Draco doesn’t yet know couldn’t possibly hurt him, right?
“If you’ve come to discuss father, you can leave.”
You had a choice sure, but It’d be wrong if I said it wasn’t heavily influenced. I would’ve followed my family to the ends of the earth too. I don’t blame you.
Draco had to admit, although his mother was sweet, she could be terrifying when she tried. He swallowed his pride and nodded, “Very well.”
Ginny bit her lip before speaking, “What he’s trying to say is he wants us to find a new Keeper.”
His mother was as kind as ever. Acting as if she loved him even after everything that had happened, everything she had let happen. Draco stared at the woman with cold eyes. Eyes easily recognized as inherited from his father. He shuddered at the thought, “well I haven’t had much of a bloody morning, seeing as I woke up 5 minutes ago.”
Once they were in and the coast was clear Ron grabbed Harry by the shoulders, “What the bloody hell was that?” He practically shouted the question.
You run so far from the past, while he’s stuck in it. I shouldn’t give away too much. Just read the clipping.
“Son, your hands are cold. They are always cold when you’re lonely.” Well how could she possibly know that? Draco looked down at his pale fingers. Traitors. He’d have to put them back in their place later.
The rain had stopped late last night. The sun now peaked from the tops of trees. Sunlight warmed Draco’s cold body, but not his cold heart. Living alone for so many years had made him freezing. His parents rarely qualified as company, as all they did was cause him pain.
Ginny slammed her hand on the table. Draco looked up to make eye contact with the petite girl. Despite her angry gesture she seemed to tremble with fear before him. It almost made him chuckle. Potter’s pathetic girlfriend came to get mad at him? How idiotic.
Harry shrugged off his friend's hands before responding, “Was I supposed to just let him sit alone?”
He nodded silently.
In which Draco gets a visit from an unwanted guest and a letter that leaves him enraged.
The three looked at each other quietly before Ron spoke again, “I put out an ad for a new keeper already... Lots have applied to audition. Many people would give the world to play with the world's best Seeker.” He was referring to Harry.
Harry felt worried, although he wasn’t sure if he was worried about himself or for Draco. Surely everyone would hate the boy. It seemed he was right when Draco made his way to the Slytherin table and the students picked up their things and moved. Draco seemed unphased by the action but Harry couldn’t help but feel bad. His family had been disgraced; his life had been shattered.
“The right thing? I think you gave everyone a heart attack, including Malfoy!” Ron shouted.
I did the same thing as you, and I was so angry for so long.
“The name he tarnished.” Draco hissed which received a glare from his mother. The harsh look caused Draco to stiffen once more and grow quiet.
He didn’t know whether to be more scared or relieved. Narcissa Malfoy stood outside the door, her hair neatly done and her hands gripping her purse. Draco’s eyes searched for his father. If Lucius was there, he would never open the door again. Luckily his mother seemed to have come alone.
The team landed their brooms and crowded around their injured friend, worried he could be paralyzed or worse. Dead. Harry gulped and pushed through the crowd. He held back tears as he looked down at his best friend. The other team bowed their head in condolences as the referee rushed to call a medic.
That brings me to your next memory. Year two, when you started seeking. How did it feel? Did you do it for fun or just to one up Harry? Was it for the feeling of flight or the thrill of the hunt? How much did it hurt to watch Harry win when all odds were against him?
Ron opened his mouth to speak but Hermione beat him to speaking, “Yeah Harry! We hate him remember? He always picked fights with us and he joined Voldemort!”
A Distant Memory.
“Ron, look out!” Ginny cried out a moment too late as the ball collided against Ron’s chest. A blood-curdling howl of pain froze everyone in their tracks as Ron plummeted 15 feet. It didn’t quite register to Harry what had just happened until Ron hit the ground without a cry of protest or pain.
It was the first game of the season. The referee held his wand in the air, and with a shout launched a bright flare into the sky, indicating the beginning of the match. The snitch had not yet been released and Harry was circling the arena.
One day when I’m ready.
Days have been difficult recently. I, like you, have found myself lost in the world. These letter to you are the only thing grounding my feet to the soil. My head floats higher and higher each day until the fog clogs my head. Anyway, I’ll stop being poetic and just get to the point of this letter.
Ron grabbed the cards and looked them over, laughing at the “Get well, Wanker” card just as Harry had hoped. The redhead sighed and looked over everyone in the room, “Yesterday the team came to see me, sad you couldn’t be there, Harry.”
Draco had decided today he would unpack. He awoke early in the morning to birds chirping and warm sunshine on his face. After rubbing his hands over his tired eyes and stretching he managed to pull himself out of bed. Once his sheets were thrown off and he stood, the cold air of his flat assaulted him. It made him want to crawl right back into his bed. He shook off the feeling and opened the sliding door of his closet.
“Yeah actually! Living  alone gets boring. I hate to say it but I almost miss the constant sight of people.” Harry’s voice was soft… warm. Draco’s cold hands grabbed at the cloth of his pants for warmth. Narcissa’s words floated back to his memory. Harry needed a roommate…
Despite the fear that swirled inside of him, Draco obeyed. He always obeyed. He had no free will. After a small walk he sat next to his mother, who gently took his hand and squeezed it.
Surely Sunday couldn’t be any worse.
When he finished his morning tea, he went back inside to wash the dishes. He could’ve spelled the teacup clean, but he wanted something to do. Something to keep his mind on the now. He took a wash cloth and gently scrubbed away any stains or remains of tea. He scrubbed until the cup was pearly white and shining. Then he set the cup on a towel to dry.
Draco shook his head as the burning engulfed his body. Those flames were caused by that bloody man. He quickly turned off the TV and groaned. His daily routine had officially been obliterated. His brain craved structure, the lack of such things made the sick in his stomach grow.
He stripped off his sleepwear and pulled on the outfit. Ever since Ron’s injury he hadn’t been looking after himself properly, Nismy decided to take matters into her own hands. He didn’t need her to pick his clothes, but she had insisted she would.
He had traitor hands. Bloody treason. Draco pulled back his hand from his mothers grasp and sighed, “I don’t need one. I’m doing just fine here alone.”
There was no use holding grudges over something Harry wanted so desperately to forget. So, he ate until his plate was empty, then he stood once again. This time Draco’s eyes followed him as Harry walked out the door followed by his friends. They walked slowly down the halls until they got to the Gryffindor house.
He couldn’t do this anymore. He couldn’t take the pain, or the loneliness. The letters were too much. They grew more painful by the day. His mother was a monster who loomed over him.
Draco swiveled towards the door and tilted his head. It was Sunday. There wasn’t post on Sundays. He rose slowly, carefully and approached the envelope. It was crisp white with a red wax seal. He wondered how it didn’t seem to have a single drop of rain on it.
“I would’ve taken Draco’s hand.”
It was when he recycled his last box that the letter slid under his door. Draco froze in his tracks, looking back at the white envelope sealed with red wax. So the mystery writer had struck again? He had no interest in reading it. He picked it up and set it on his kitchen counter before groaning and flopping down on his couch.
Sincerely, a distant memory.
It’s reassuring to see you finally leaving your manor behind. This letter has been collecting dust for far too long. It took a few days but as you can see, I found your address easily. Don’t be concerned, for I mean you no harm.
The letter came at noon and no later. It slid under his door and beckoned for the Malfoy boy to collect it. Draco was far too weak to resist its calling and scooped it up. The bracelet he wore with the charm still stayed on his wrist.
“I’m not sure-” he started, only to be cut off.
In the kitchen Draco grabbed down a bowl and began to make a fruit salad. He figured it would be enough to satisfy him without angering his stomach. He missed being a boy and not having to worry about what he ate… he shouldn’t think that.
Draco awoke to the most gentle of knocks on his front door. A small tapping that, if Draco had not been a light sleeper, would’ve gone unnoticed. The boy sat up in bed and rubbed his tired eyes. What time was it? His eyes flicked to his alarm to find it was 6am. He practically choked. Who in bloody hell could be at his door this early? He wasn’t expecting a letter for Sunday until noon. Draco moved in a rush, pulling on clothes and getting ready for the day. He’d much rather be sleeping until 10. Heaven knows he needed the sleep. He hardly ever got more than 5 hours a night. The slightest bump would wake him.
The first thing he did was set a kettle of tea on the stove top, then he slid two pieces of bread into the toaster. Nothing big, but tea helped him keep down his food. The last thing he needed was to get sick in the morning from eating toast.
He has worked on the same canvas for a couple of visits and it is only when Potter shows up one day looking even worse than usual that he cannot bring himself to touch his brush to the canvas. It is then that he realizes that Potter’s stories influence his work. The canvas before him consists of light colors, all of which have the same dull grey undertone that seems to cover Potter’s skin. A reflection of his affectedly cheerful stories. But today Potter doesn’t feel like light colors, he feels dark and brooding and Draco cannot bring himself to mix these new colors into the light blue and yellow and green that is currently covering the canvas. So, he takes the canvas down, fetches a new one from the storage room and starts painting in bolt dark colors.
“You have called me
“You’re buying,” he says and threads his fingers through the silky strands of white blond hair, before he leans in and kisses Draco, making it as filthy as he dares. When he pulls back, Draco is breathing heavily and his eyes are almost black with desire. “And who knows, I might even spread my legs for you afterwards,” he murmurs against Draco’s lips, capturing his answering groan in another kiss, before he makes his way to the door.
“Mmhhh,” Draco hummed as the tension in his back eased.
A small analytical part of himself immediately draws the conclusion that the paper has been planted at his table for a reason. That reason being, of course, to hurt him. Another small and also quite analytical part of himself concludes that that has worked out rather well. The rest, the biggest part of him roars.
Eventually, Harry gets up, leans in for another kiss and then slowly and carefully pulls his now soft cock from Draco’s body. They both hiss at the feel of their over sensitised skin brushing together. He flops down next to Draco waves his hand in a wandless cleaning charm, which earns him a muttered “Show-off!” and a playful elbow to the ribs. They both chuckle quietly as Harry pulls him in for another kiss and they lie together, legs entwined.
“Oh, poor baby,” he mocks, “Did you eat too much?” Draco is in too much pain to pay the mockery any mind and just sighs languishingly.
“Have I got you pregnant?” he says feigning shock. But then resolves into laughter when he receives what Draco hopes to be a painful elbow to the ribs.
“They want to question you? They know about your condition. How dare they?” he rants, “Don’t they have an ounce of common decency?” Draco merely rolls his eyes. Typical Potter to focus on the unimportant details. He knows he won’t talk, so he can only repeat, even if it is just to himself, let them ask. Let them waste their time. He snatches the parchment from Potters hand and flattens it on the nearest available surface, then he points to the offending lines. Potter has the decency to look flustered now. He scratches the back of his neck and drags the point of one foot across the floor, following it with his eyes. Draco crosses his arms in front of his chest and continues to glare at Potter. When he looks up again, his face is flushed.
“Turn that off,” Harry growls, “You’re going to wake up the whole neighbourhood.” Scorpius has the nerve to giggle.
“You okay?” he asks, “How does it feel?”
“Sure,” Harry answered, and then leant in to brush a quick scratchy kiss to Draco’s neck.
“I would charm the door locked and the room soundproof and then I could transfigure this desk into a bed, if you want,” he answers.
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered, tightening his hold on his husband, who promptly wriggled back against him. They lay in silence, Harry’s face buried in Draco’s neck, his breath hot and tingling, making Draco shiver with how every hair on his body stood on end. It was so comfortable, Draco felt so safe in Harry’s arms, that he dozed off for a while.
“But you just said…” He stopped speaking when Draco breathed a sigh of relief. “Contraction over?” he asked. Draco nodded, frowning. He sank deeper into the pillows he was propped up against, but he remained tense.
“Well it was a wanted ad. A very well-revered team has been in a rut lately, and with the injury of their Keeper... well they are looking for a new one.”
A small slip of paper caught Draco’s eyes and he plucked it up. On it read, “What if?” Draco dropped them all on the spot. The letter, the box, they both hit the ground. Draco most certainly did not want to remember. He didn’t want to ever think about his youth again.
Draco was shopping at a wizarding grocer. His hand skimmed a line of spices and herbs as he decided which one to buy. He was never truly into cooking, but there was always time to learn. He settled on a common magical spice known as dragon’s breath. His personal cooks used it often when they cooked for him. It was certainly spicy, but nothing Draco couldn’t handle.
Sincerely,
Who would want to reach out to him? How long had they waited? Why him of all people? He shoved the questions to the deepest part of his mind as he rose out of bed. He pulled on a clean white button up and black skinny jeans. Draco wore this outfit so often it was practically his uniform by now.
It was a interview with Harry Potter, of course it was. Today was going so bloody horrible. First his mother, then the letter, now this.
Not beta read.
Dammit Harry. This was too soon. It would always be too soon. Draco payed for his items and quickly left. He didn’t break down until he had safely apparated home and locked himself in his flat. His damn hand still burned, he ran it under the sink to no avail. Tears rolled down his cheeks making salty streaks. This was a kind of burn that no amount of water could cure. It was much stronger than any 3rd degree. It was the burning feeling of want. The want to touch Harry’s hand once more. He’d had that burning since his first year of hogwarts, and whenever he saw Harry in the paper, it flared up once again. Draco wiped the tears from his face and rubbed his puffy eyes.
The entire time they sat and ate was filled with uncomfortable silence. Draco didn’t know whether to speak, be angry, or thank Harry. Students' eyes burned holes in the back of Draco’s head and as much as he appreciated Potter’s gesture, he’d rather not have more attention than necessary. So, when the boy finished his food and left, followed by his friends, Draco let out a sigh of relief.
He was a lost cause. A broken boy. Joy seemed like a distant memory, always just out of his reach. At least his friends stuck with him. Through his vent sessions and complaints, through all the tears and fits of fear. They were there to remind him to eat when he was lost in thought and scratching his plate with his fork.
Harry felt a cold rush of energy as he splashed water on his face and looked up at the mirror. His hair frizzed and messy from sleep, his eyes wet with grief. He grabbed a brush and began to tackle the challenge of getting his hair to seem somewhat managed.
“Oh…” Narcissa looked down at her feet, but her eyes were quick to rise once more, “can I come in? I would like to see your place.”
“So what?” He spoke tiredly.
T/W mentions of self harm and abuse
Hermione shrieked from her spot on the bleachers and ran down the stairs and out onto the field. Tears streaked her face as she kneeled to her boyfriend's side, “Ron, get up! Get up!” She clasped his hand in hers.
Harry couldn’t believe Ron of all people had agreed to this.
“Mother?” He asked curiously as he watched her take the paper and fold in gently. She set it on the table before turning towards her son.
Draco sat on his back porch. The sky was cloudless and a soft blue. He admired it as he sipped on his tea and chewed on his toast. The strawberry jam was delicious. For once he was glad to be enjoying breakfast. Moving out had really been a wonderful idea.
If he wasn’t paying so much attention to the sounds, he wouldn’t have noticed the slight rap on his door that interrupted the soothing pattering on his windows. He wouldn’t have heard a small envelope slip under his door either.
“Finally, Harry decides to show up!” Ron announces with a smile. He goes to sit up but looks almost surprised when he is unable to move his waist and legs.
Draco’s eyes locked onto Harry’s. Harry hadn’t seen the boy since the trials. He had no idea he’d be back at Hogwarts... not so soon at least. His stomach lurched and he struggled to keep down his food. Hermione nudged him gently and he looked away from Malfoy. She rubbed his back gently, “It’ll be ok, Harry.”
“One month, Draco. I will return in a month.” She stood and slowly walked to the door, all while her son stared at her in a mixture of shock and anger. Narcissa sighed and looked back at Draco, “It’s for your own good.”
And then the doors swung open. Harry’s eyes darted up to the sight as a platinum blonde boy stepped into the hall. He seemed taller, and less pale than the last time Harry had seen him. His fork clattered onto his plate; he didn’t remember dropping it.
Harry never wanted to save him. It wasn’t true, it couldn’t be true. He refused to believe it was true for now and for forever he’d avoid the truth. He’d run from it just like he ran from the past. Draco’s burning feelings that he couldn’t describe were both the truth and the past.
Finally, he pulled on an overcoat and began to make his way outside. Yet, his eyes flicked to the trinket on the ground. It called out to him, and for a second, he almost bent over to pick it up. He slapped his own hand hard enough to leave a bruise before striding out the door and apparating to his small potion shop.
A clean pair of trousers and a sweater awaited him on his bed. His house-elf Nismy did her best to keep his flat in shape, even with Harry being as messy as he was. She was less of a house-elf and more of a friend, seeing as Harry offered her clothes and she had decided to stay and look after Harry. Like the sister he never had.
Of course, his mother had forgotten to mention one tiny fact. The team contained many of Hogwarts students Draco once knew. One of which includes Harry Potter.
Even with being cleared by trial, would a former death eater be allowed to play professional quidditch?
The last thing Draco wanted was to see Harry Potter again. It was always too soon or too late with him. He never showed up at quite the right time, and he always spun Draco’s world around. Sadly meeting Harry once more was exactly what happened Saturday.
Not beta-read I can only catch so much so I’m sorry if I missed some things.
“Where’s Lucius?” Draco’s voice was harsh. He refused to acknowledge that man as related to him. Not after all he did to him.
The interview was on Harry’s opinion of Draco. He was expecting a long essay of words on Draco’s horrible actions, but he read on and found the opposite. Short comments defending the Malfoy boy. His mouth fell open in shock as he desperately read on, gripping the clipping.
“Did he really have a choice? Besides, I wasn’t being friendly I was simply doing the right thing.”
“Nonsense. You at least try or I will move you back into the manor before you can blink, Draco.”
He set the rag aside and lied down on the bed. Not bothering to get changed or pull the covers over him. He was far too tired and too stressed for that. Classes would start up again tomorrow. He needed plenty of rest so he could annoy Potter fully and effortlessly.
Dear, Malfoy
After about 10 minutes of indecision, Draco was dressed in a loose black tee tucked into black skinny jeans. Nothing super classy, but he still looked presentable. His hair however, was currently not presentable. It took a lot less time to tackle that hurdle and wash his face.
He groaned. Why was he so worried about such a trinket anyway? It shouldn’t matter. Still he couldn’t seem to shake the fear of loosing it. With a sigh of defeat he walked out to his living room and pulled out a small sewing kit he’d stashed in one of his drawers. He looked through the yarn carefully. Nothing seemed to fit his needs so he pulled out a needle and began to sew his own small bracelet.
The boy who lived had been his enemy to the bitter end. The paper he had read last night invoked a thought in him. What if it had been different? What if Harry had taken his hand that day. He had no doubt his life would be much different. Draco rubbed his bruises and sighed. He was tired. Not just a bodily tired, his very soul ached for sleep.
Sincerely, a distant memory
There was already a line out to the street in front of it. Draco really did need to work on expanding his shop to fit more people, he was sick of seeing lines outside even when he was open.
Or he could open the letter.
Dear, Malfoy
Rain pattered on Draco’s windows. It was soothing, sitting on the floor and getting lost in the noises of the storm outside. It thundered violently, and if he closed his eyes, he’d find every few moments the bright flash of lightning would seep through his eyelids.
“Like bloody hell you are!” Draco looked at his mother in disbelief. He knew she was telling the truth though, Narcissa never bluffed.
He gulped and prayed he wouldn’t be recognized, but of course he would be. He was Draco bloody Malfoy. Harry tilted his head and gave him a concerned look, “Come on. I thought you’d be happy to see me.”
The exchange left Draco without an appetite and he pushed his plate to the center of the table before standing. He slowly walked off down into the hall, all while stroking his cheek in pain. She may have been small but damn, did she know how to really hurt when she slapped. It almost felt worse than when Granger had punched him square in the nose. He had deserved that one though.
The Great Hall felt empty with the lack of students. Even when every student showed up to eat it was barely half full. Looking over the empty seats made Harry’s fist tighten around his fork, which was once again picking at his food.
He placed it gently into his hand cart and continued along, Draco had already bought a plethora of cooking supplies. He hadn’t brought much to his flat when he had packed, so he had to buy them now. With the steady income from his shop, it wasn’t like he didn’t have the money.
Draco pocketed his wand and carefully finished  unbolting his door. He pulled it open and gulped at the sound of his mother gasping, “Oh Draco I didn’t know if you were awake! How is your morning?”
Draco set down the paper. He knew exactly what was going to be on that clipping. The last thing he wanted to do was read about Harry Potter. Yet, his burning hands still found a way to grab onto that clipping. They still brought it to his face for his eager eyes to read. They read over the page hungrily. It was an article on an interview with Harry Potter, accompanied with a moving picture of his bright smile and bubbly laugh.
He was so very wrong. Draco awoke with an ache in his back, and wandered to the kitchen for a soothing cup of tea. But as soon as it went down, he ran straight to the bathroom to throw it back up. Maybe he was sick? But he didn’t feel hot. This was a different sick.
There was no trinket today so he threw it all away and walked to his couch. He wasn’t hungry for lunch… maybe watching TV would give him an appetite. With the remote in hand he flicked it on and the screen turned bright.
The wax sealed letter was accompanied by a newspaper clipping. He lifted both and set the clipping on his kitchen counter before tearing open the letter. The wax cracked and gave way for a small paper to slip out. Draco plucked it up and scanned it over.
He didn’t miss his past, he missed what it could’ve been.
Narcissa looked at the paper before meeting Draco’s eyes, “If such is the case, I have a job to offer you.”
He grabbed a handful of Floo powder and raised his hand. Nismy looked up at Harry with a tilted head, her flowery dress swished tenderly, “I’m sorry Harry, but Nismy must inquire where you are going before breakfast?”
“So are you looking for a flat mate?” The interviewers voice Pericles through Draco’s thoughts.
The subtle thought caught him off guard and he sat upright. His hands searched for the small hand trinket only to find it wasn’t in his pocket. He furrowed his brows and stood up to look for it. Draco checked under his couches and chairs, by his sink and in his backyard. Only to find he hadn’t dropped it anywhere and he had in fact left it on his bedside table.
Harry had cried for nights but it had been for the best. Ginny wanted to move on from the War and Harry seemed to always dwell in the past. She had promised they could still be friends, but it was awkward. Harry’s heart still felt as if it had been torn from his chest and it had been months.
Auditioning couldn’t hurt could it?
He dried them before writing his letter to Harry.
She looked down almost saddened, “But I could help you pay for it, Draco... My money is your money.”
I think you’ll find the contents of the jewelry box to be a nice trip down memory lane. You shouldn’t forget who you were Draco. Don’t abandon him too. Not like everyone else did. I’ve learned to happily embrace the youth we shared. It’s not so bad once you remember it's all in the past. I promise.
“Mother, I haven’t played since Hogwarts.” He stated.
“Stop! Just... stop. I am not choosing Draco’s side over you guys! I don’t want to be his friend! I was doing the right thing because he looked scared. I’m done talking about it now let it go!” Harry cut Ron off harshly.
He was free from that silent torture. But what happened next made him wish Harry hadn’t left.
Chapter 1: Trinkets and Memories
Draco read the letter three times before it sunk in and he reached for the black box. He gently clicked it open and looked in. Inside was a small charm that depicted two hands shaking. Draco’s breath hitched as he picked up the charm and turned it around. On the back was an engraved quote, one he recognized.
“You don’t wanna go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.” He repeated the words he had once spoke as a boy.
Draco had never really been fond of the golden couple's relationship. He couldn’t quite understand why. Something about it just didn’t sit right with Draco, though he did nothing to sabotage them. Despite what some of his friends used to think, he wasn’t constantly obsessed with Potter and trying to ruin his life. He had better things to be doing sometimes.
Hayden sighed in relief before turning around. He started to slowly climb his way out the ditch he was in.
Strangely enough, the first night he had spent in the room, he had the strongest feeling to gather all the blankets and pillows and arrange them on the bed in a soft and warm nest.
What was supposed to be a short run to the library was turning out to be an unending and stressful encounter.
For some reason, it was now that Hayden realized what the blonde was wearing.
"I apologize for my sons behaviour" Lucius sighed, "Sometimes I forget how naive he can be"
"No, no! I refuse to let Hayden continue with this!" The blonde declared as he started away from where he was sitting.
"Now why is someone as beautiful as you walking all alone?" Viktor said looking down at him with a smile.
"As I was saying" Voldemort continued, already annoyed with the crazed woman. "My child has finally come back home and will be joining our ranks. Everyone this is my child, Hayden"
"Because I trust you and I would like to prepare you to take my place someday. Of course only if you want it, I would never force this on you" Tom added quickly at the end.
"Mum? Are you here?" he called once more, again no response. Hayden shrugged at the silence, walking over to the black leather couch that sat in front of a smaller fireplace than what the common room held. It was rather cozy.
"What do you mean they would do anything for me?"
He looked down to the shaking boy in his arms and hugged him tighter. He had finally found his son! After all this time of searching, he had been right under his nose for the past three years.
He was sad that Harry had to go this, at such a young age and all alone no doubt. Severus had made a decision, he was going to try and help the small boy before him by first healing him of his wounds. Severus gently picked him up and apperated  back at Spinner's End.
He never noticed the blonde sitting right outside in the corridor waiting for him till classes started. He would just have to try again.
He was angry towards the muggles Harry had to live with and angry at Dumbledore for subjecting the boy to this year after year! Surely he must've known that this was happening!
The blonde haired girl just smiled kindly at and handed him a bag.
"They would all love to meet you. I have no doubt in my mind about it, and if for some reason they have a problem, well they would have to answer to me!" Tom said, making Hayden laugh a little at the end.
Severus thought.
It was then that he noticed Harry's smell. It was so vaguely familiar to him. He knew it from somewhere but couldn't place it. Then it hit him.
"What!?" Draco exclaimed, yanking his arm away from the fifth year and sprinting all the way back to the Slytherin dorms.
Looking over to the other side of the room, he saw the Draco was still asleep, his blonde hair spilling over his black pillow like moonlight. Hayden started for a moment, he could feel a small smile slip over his features.
When the two were done, Hayden went to make his way outside to try and figure out where Draco wanted him to go.
He slowly sat up, letting himself wake back up before he started the strenuous task of trying to stand up.
Nobody particularly wants to go with her.
"I just don't trust those Beauxbaton girls, they just rub me the wrong way, I suppose" Draco said while putting down his book to look at Hayden. "And I don't like the Bulgarians either. They are far too smug for their own good" Draco said.
"Hayden, what's wrong?" Draco asked, his heart dropping as he saw Hayden's face morph from happiness to something else entirely.
"And to what do I owe this pleasant surprise?" Severus asked.
Suddenly the door to his compartment burst open and to loud Gryffindors walked in.
“I wasn’t hurt if that’s what you're asking. Calm down Draco, you sound like you plan on murdering someone!” Hayden said with a chuckle before realizing Draco was completely serious.
Soon enough classes were done for the day and the students were all back in the dorm after dinner. Not too long after, Severus came to talk with all the Slytherins about the dance.
Theo walked over a little table where a long box sat. Picking it up, he made his way back to where Hayden waited.
"Not much, really. Just hanging out" Draco responded, walking towards the raven.
Severus guided in a nervous Hayden until both he and Tom were standing in front of each other.
He sighed, resigning himself to the situation. I guess i'm not gonna be taking a nap.
Encasing the boy on the bed were two stunning gold and red wings that shone like firelight.
"We'll take the day off. It's not like we'll miss out on some important lesson. Besides how hard can sneaking off campus be?" Draco said confidently.
"What are you reading?" Draco asked after a moment.
"May I sit down?" Hayden nodded. "Tell me how you are doing?"
Hayden was weary of meeting these people. Not only had he already met these people, he had fought with them.
"Sit down, Draco. I'm sure that he will be just fine! He can handle himself" Pansy retorted.
They all came to a silent consecutive decision, someone needed to get Draco.
He jumped slightly, not expecting another person to be up, he guessed he was too loud and woke Draco.
“We were all beginning to wonder if you were ever going to come back” the man joked, continuing to walk further down the aisle of books to be closer to Hayden.
Walking over, Draco kneeled down beside the bed, looking at the calm look Hayden had on his face.
"It's alright, who was he?" Hayden asked Draco.
Once in the kitchen, he leaned up against one of the counters, trying to steady himself as he attempted to stand. After a few seconds of catching his breath, he grabbed a dish rag and hurried back out to where the mess was so he could clean it up.
"I don't need them anyway. There was always something off about them, I don't think they cared for me at all" Hayden said.
After a little while, Petunia barged into the kitchen.
Overall, Hayden enjoyed the meeting. It had felt like a weight off his shoulders that he didn't even know he was carrying.
Out of pure instinct, Draco gently sat down beside the sleeping boy on the bed. While running his fingers carefully through the soft, gold feathers, the blonde leaned down to kiss the top of Hayden's head and gently nuzzled the side of his face.
He was now a couple inches taller (which he was more than thankful for) and his hair had grown out another inch, now reaching just below his shoulders. It hung similarly to his mothers, but was wavy like his fathers.
"Hayden?" He whispered, looking around the dark room. Taking his wand out, he casted a weak Lumous just in case Hayden was sleeping. But the strange thing was, Hayden wasn't in his bed. He didn't seem to be anywhere in the room in fact.
Harry took a small step backwards, cowering away from the beating he knew was coming.
A knock coming from the portrait door of Severus' room startled him from out of his reading.
Turning on the lights, Draco frantically looked everywhere, in the closet, in the bathroom, even under the beds.
Draco looked at the other boy. Something about him seemed familiar, but he just could quite place him. He watched as the other leaned back and closed his eyes.
Draco was confused as well. He knew that it was planned to enter Harry Potter into the tournament from talking with his father, but he had been told that the plan was called off and that no such thing would happen. So then how did that happen, and with Hayden Snape no less?
When Draco was inches away from the other did he stop. The blonde took a moment to look into Hayden jewel toned eyes and was ever so slightly relieved that he didn't see any hesitation or rejection in them.
Hayden wasn't really paying attention to the speech, he did catch though something about a tournament and other schools coming? It didn't really matter.
"Did you just say,...that Hayden is your son? I thought he was your nephew?" Draco asked, trying to process the information he just learned.
The two had obviously formed some sort of bond, so it was a logical conclusion that Draco would know what to do.
Once he had finished packing all his clothes and school supplies, he strapped his trunk and made his way down to the dining hall for dinner.
In a way, Hayden was and was not looking forward to going to school, all at the same time.
When the doors to Great Hall opened, he walked with the first years to the front of the Hall where McGonagall was. Next to her was a stool and the beat up old sorting hat.
When he opened the door, he was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a cozy little bedroom with its own fireplace and a mountain of blankets on a circular bed.
A couple days before, Hayden was going over his strategy and making sure it was solidified as well as many other side plans in case something went wrong. He wasn't too worried though. At the moment, his main problem was trying to figure out what he was going to wear.
"Phoenix are similar in a way, but not closely. When we are courting, we tend to be rather physical, not so much in any sexual way but rather for comfort purposes. For Phoenix's, the submissive has more of a role, instead of just letting the dominant care for us, we tend to make them work for it. Phoenix's are strong willed creatures and we know what we want when we want it." Hayden laughed at this. He wondered how Draco would react to all this.
"Couldn't sleep," Hayden answered. "Just couldn't stop thinking"
He was absolutely shocked. He wasn't the son of Lily and James Potter? How did this happen, how was it true?
With that he walked straight through the portrait and into their dorm, locking it so Draco couldn't get in.
Hayden thought with a smile before making his way into the candy store.
Almost immediately after classes, Hayden rushed over to his mother's classroom, hoping that he hadn't given another student detention.
Fleur sat in a seat in the front while Hayden stood behind her. On either side of him stood both Cedric and Viktor, Cedric being a little closer than Viktor.
"And why not!" Draco asked, trying to get around the Italian.
"Would it be okay if I moved in here?" Harry wondered as all three of them were having lunch.
Hayden slowly woke up, yawing as he reluctantly sat up in his bed. .
The dragon didn't seem like it was about to move anytime soon, so Hayden took a chance and ran to where the golden egg was, almost tripping once or twice.
Hayden looked around for a moment, trying to find something he could potentially cover up with. After a minute and he still couldn't think of anything, he relented and admitted the blonde entrance, but only if he would look at anything he shouldn't.
“I mean, you could…” Hayden giggled back.
I have decided that I will be keeping the A/N because I don't want to delete all your uplifting comments, I hope you all don't mind!
"The Triwizard Tournament"
"Now, I'm sure you know you're here for a reason. Close your eyes" Pansy demanded, a hint of excitement in her voice.
Draco smiled.
Viktor leaned back a little, smiling. Hayden was blushing at his closeness, flustered at how the taller man was acting.
He should probably go and make sure it's alright with Sev to leave for a couple days.
"AWWWW!"Pansy cried, absolutely loving how adorable they were after reading the letter over Hayden's shoulder.
"I think what you need is a day off, and tomorrow will be the perfect day to do that. What do you say" Draco offered after a second, letting his free hand skim the water in the tub.
"Hayden, please! Wait!" Draco called again as Hayden booked it in the opposite direction, heading further down the corridor.
Harry quietly tried to get out of the bed without bothering the sleeping man, but failed as he was unused to the added weight on his back and fell to the floor with a thud.
"You are a disgrace! No wonder no cares for you, you freak! You're a burden!" Vernon yelled, as he undid his belt.
Hayden looked over to Draco to see that he was blushing out of embarrassment.
Before he took a step closer to the cozy looking seat, though, he heard voices.
His eyes widened in surprise when he saw two big gold feathered wings connected to his back. He stared in shock.
Ah, I was wondering if I would be looking through your mind again. I am pleased to see you have found who are. Now let's get you sorted into your proper house now, shall we!
A couple minutes later, Severus comes rushing into the room followed by Draco.
Taking out one of the bars of chocolate, he noticed a letter. He picked it up, opened it and began to read:
"I have learned, though, that there is much more to your life than I ever knew about, and as much as I am curious about it, I won't push you. But I do hope that one you can confide in me. I may not have always been the nicest person to be around-" Hayden scoffed "-alright, I was almost never nice, but I am trying to make up for it now. Hayden, call me crazy, but I feel a connection to you and that is why it would absolutely kill me to see you get hurt. Will you please accept my apology and understand that I will always do my best to make sure that nothing bad ever happens to you?"
"Of course I'm worried! Now send him in before I have second thoughts and tell you both to leave!" Tom said impatiently.
"Of course you can" Tom answered as he gestured for Hayden to come in and sit, "I'm glad to see you awake again. Did you need something?"
"I mean, I guess I could meet them, I don't think I'm all that comfortable with them seeing who I am though," the raven explained.
At this point Harry was on the verge of a breakdown and Severus was worrying about what on that paper could've upset him this much!
Hayden smiled proudly out at the audience watching as he stood up. As he walked to the table, Hayden looked over to where the professors were all sitting and saw his mother smiling proudly at him.
Once they left Gringotts, Hayden asked where they were going next.
"I'm just happy so far at the pleasant outcomes" Draco said, giving Hayden a small smirk.
His anger seemed to suddenly leave him with that realization, he loved the other boy, he really did. How did this even happen. Why was he so upset?
"What do you plan to do?" Hayden responded quietly, following Draco's lead by leaning forward a bit.
At first he was nervous to be going to the house of the people who had emotionally tormented him, but he felt slightly better behind the mask that Tom had given him.
Hope you all enjoyed this one!
Severus couldn't blame him. He remembered his inheritance quite clearly, it wasn't pleasant. He distantly wondered how much more pain Harry was going through considering he was going through a rather early inheritance.
Hayden left the shop after thanking Pansy and giving her a hug.
"Alright" Hayden conceded with a smile.
A voice called out to Hayden before he was able to grab the book he was looking for on the shelf in the library. As he turned to address the person talking to him, he felt immediately annoyed and regretted his decision of not ignoring the newcomer.
"Has everything you've told me then been a lie?" Draco asked, a pained sort of anger lacing his venomous tone. "Have you been glamouring yourself all this time? I bet you're not even a creature, you've just been playing me for a fool, well I hope you've had fun manipulating my emotions like this"
"Good night" Draco whispered into the dark, falling back into the comforting black of sleep.
Draco turned over to try and see what was wrong with the other, only to see Hayden tossing and turning in discomfort.
Unfortunately, this was not his day.
Sitting on a nearby bench, he opened the bag and looked at it's contents.
"Oh? And why might that be?" Sev deadpanned right back.
Hayden came out of the shower to find Draco already in bed, reading a book.
Their lips moved together like a practiced dance and not too long after, they broke away only to rest their foreheads against the others. Hayden's eyes stayed closed as he smiled, basking in the happy warmth he felt in his chest.
"Okay," Hayden says, smiling happily.
After a little while Hayden went back down to the dungeons to check on his new “friend”.
After a minute or two of walking, he made it to the little store.
"Thank you" Hayden smiled as he situated the mask onto his face.
"Oh hey, your back" Draco greeted sleepily. Hayden could help but think he looked cute.
"Yes please"
Something good that happened is that I just recently declared my major, but because I'm declaring it late into my college career, I'm having to deal with how I need to arrange my schedule for the next semester so that I can hopefully graduate on time. On top of that, I work as a teacher as a dance studio, also the subject of my minor, and there is a lot of tension between myself and the studio owner. So my life is split between drama and stress. Thankfully the end of this semester is a couple weeks so I will either be getting busier or things will start to slow down.
Luckily the path wasn't that long so he wasn't completely exhausted when he finally found Draco in front of a small pond surrounded by trees and wildflowers.
He closed the door to his room right as he heard the front door down stairs open. Thankfully, the Dursleys just ignored him for the rest of the night and was able to fall asleep peacefully.
Severus was closest to the two while Dumbledore was the farthest.
Tom smiled back at Hayden before running his hand through his son's hair
"You bastard" Draco snarled, he had no idea why he hadn't ripped out the red-heads throat yet. Little did he know that the answer was standing behind him.
Closing the window, he opened the letter to see it was an invitation.
He smiled when seeing Draco next to him.
Harry couldn't sleep that night, as exhausted as he was, it just wouldn't come.
"What are you growling like a wild animal for? Trying to hold back your killing urges?" Weasley snapped, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
Draco stood in shock, looking back at his white wings then to the boy still struggling to sleep.
I'll go first: I got a book on all of Hubble's (the space telescope) discoveries!
Harry was brought out of his thoughts by the sound of heavy footsteps climbing the stairs. He braced himself as the door to his room was slammed open and then immediately slammed shut again.
"Yeah, I just got back a minute ago" Hayden responded, folding the letter back up.
"Harry, would it be alright if I call you Hayden, or would you prefer to still be called Harry?" Severus questioned.
He set the plates down in front of them. "Go fetch us something to drink, freak!" Petunia screeched.
His eyes though, had seemed to be what changed the most. He now had one golden yellow eye on his left and a bright red on his right. Each eye had small intricate details in black around the outer edge of his eyes, making them look even brighter.
Once the hat was done greeting the students with his song, McGonagall began calling students up to be sorted, the first one of course being Hayden.
Severus was having trouble processing all this very sudden information. The unconscious boy before him was the same one he had bullied for practically no reason at all for three years? Severus was a mix of emotions that he admittedly didn't like feeling.
"Wait, how do you-"
Both Griphook and Harry went in, but as Severus was going to follow, the goblin stopped and asked him to wait outside.
"But whyyy?" Hayden whined, giving his mother puppy eyes in an attempt to persuade him.
"I'm Harry Potter" Hayden cut him off.
“I know it’s a book, silly” Cedric laughed, moving to put his hand on the other boy's shoulder.
A couple days later, it is finally time for Hayden to meet his father's Deatheaters and Hayden has been trying to pick out the perfect outfit for over an hour now with no success.
Hayden walked back down to his fathers about 15 minutes later, his new mask secured to the hip of his pants by magic in case he needed it.
"Very well, good luck champions. Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon you may-" but the old man was cut off by the very cannon he was referring to.
Draco walked back into the common room, not bothering to go to his next class, especially since it was charms and he was the best in the class.
"Shut it. The only way we would be found if it was one of you ratting us out" the third man said, Hayden decided that he was the leader of the other two.
He tried to catch the cups but missed and they shattered when they hit the floor.
"I brought you to my house I thought you would rather not go to St. Mungo's"
Harry had heard Hermione talk about creature inheritance once after reading a book about it. She had shared a pretty in depth summary of the whole book to both Harry and Ron once she was done with it. So he had an idea about what Severus was talking about when he said that he had gone through an inheritance.
They sat in an uncomfortable silence for a moment before Draco finally spoke up with his question.
Hayden confidently walked up to the stool and sat down. A second later, he felt the hat being placed on his head. The hat began to talk to Hayden.
“Cedric” He acknowledged before finishing his task of finding and grabbing the book he needed off the shelf.
Draco and Hayden entered the room where the cup was being held.
The apology fell on deaf ears though as Hayden continued to stare at Draco through his mask. He quickly regained his composure though once he realized he was staring.
Slowly, Draco began to wake up. A pair of beautiful silver eyes looking over to Hayden.
Hayden told his father all about his classes and about the Tournament and about his troubles with Dumbledore and the Ministry and of course, his problems with his soulmate.
"Come on, we should be getting to bed" Hayden continued, getting comfortable under his dark green and black covers.
Again the cup turned red, ready to give the last name. By this point Hayden was successfully distracted from his nerves.
"You are so insensitive you know that? He could be dead for all we know and all you care about is a false sense of superiority!" Granger said, false tears filling her eyes.
A tense silence hung over them like a wet blanket, neither one of them knew how to try and fix it, and Draco wasn't so sure he even wanted to.
“Thank you again, for the whole library thing. I appreciate your help with Cedric” Hayden thanked, feeling it appropriate to do so as they neared the entrance to Slytherin.
Tom wished this could last, but unfortunately it's not as simple.
Hayden followed the transfiguration teacher down a staircase and to a different hallway "Mr. Snape we are going to have you be sorted before the first years"
"They are already suspicious, how much longer can we wait!" another asked.
He had no idea why Hayden and stepped in with him and those two Gryffindorks.
“Hey there”
Hayden breathed deeply before saying the name of the boy who broke his heart.
He immediately went over to his closet and started rifling around until he found the perfect dress to wear.
Without any explanation, Severus quickly got up and exited the room and came back with a tray of food for Harry, knowing the boy must be hungry. Harry looked at the food, grateful yet unsure at the same time. Severus set the tray down in front Harry, who slowly began to eat. For a few moments, Severus watched.
"Hurry up with our breakfast, boy!" Vernon yelled, "You better not have burned anything this time!"
"That's alright Harry, would you like to see what you like?" Severus asked.
"Oh? And what might that entail?"
"Well, a mate is something that all those creature blood possesses. I have one, your father, and you will have one as well" the man explained.
After grabbing the box that Theo had generously shrunken for him, he ran out the door, not being able to wait any longer until he could see Draco.
When he walked into his dorm last night, he was completely entranced by watching his roommate. He had no idea why, but he just could take his eyes off him.
"I thought I had already told him that he needed to talk to you" Sev muttered under his breath in pure irritation.
Draco just stood there, appearing frozen as what Hayden said sunk in. It seemed like years had passed before Draco came back to the present.
The second Hayden lands his wings burst from his back, ripping a hole in the back of his uniform where his fiery wings were.
She stuck her hand, taking out a small dragon.
Hayden would be sorted during the Sorting Ceremony under the guise that he had been home school up until now.
Theo had half way made it to the class the fourth years where in when he realized they were in potions. He paled at the thought of interrupting Professor Snape's class.
Draco tilted his head, slotting their lips together to deepen their kiss before licking Hayden's lips like the raven had done earlier.
"I have found our son" Severus simply said.
Taking a seat on his bed, he opened the letter:
Not even half an hour later, Harry woke up with a searing pain rushing through his spine. He tried not to make any noise and yell out, but ultimately wasn't able to keep in the cries of pain that escaped his lips.
That evening at dinner, Hayden sat at the Slytherin table, coincidentally next to Draco, making polite conversation with the blonde. After a couple minutes, Dumbledore stood up and quieted the Great Hall.
"Don't think you can hide from me, boy!" Hayden heard his uncle yell from inside his old room. The door slammed open as the big walrus came storming into the room, Hayden trying his hardest to disappear as he kept shuffling back into the closet door.
, he probably didn’t have to worry about Luna at all, although it might be a good idea to at least talk with her. Viktor might be more of a problem though, one that would have to be felt with. Ron on the other hand, was definitely a problem. The man couldn’t learn to keep his trap shut if his life depended on it, which -coincidentally- it did.
As soon as Draco did so though, his own wings unfurled from his own shoulders.
A couple hours later found Hayden sitting in bed while holding the egg in his lap, just thinking and staring at it, trying to figure it out.
No response. He tried again.
Many miles away, a certain black haired man was getting ready to leave a cauldron to set over night when he heard a faint voice call for help.
"Just ignore the quill. Of course you're no ordinary boy of 12 are you?" She pressed on.
Harry wondered. Unexpectedly, the door opened and Harry dove back under the blankets, suddenly scared about who's house he might be in.
"Hmm" the raven hummed thoughtfully, pulling the covers of his bed back before slipping in.
Once he was done in the bathroom he walked back down the stairs and into the kitchen. He got out a pan and put a pad of butter in it, while turning on the burner the pan was on.
"I'm Theodore Nott, it's nice to meet you" he introduced, his hand out in front of him.
Once he had put it on he went to go meet Severus downstairs so they could floo to Riddle Manor.
going on haiatus, it’s just going to to take a little longer to get the next chapter out.
Draco smiled, cupping his face. "I should be the one thanking you" he said, wiping away the tears Hayden didn't know were even there.
Draco smiled, content to just lay with Hayden for a moment more before he made himself get back up, standing from where he laid.
Harry mentally cursed himself for being so clumsy. Suddenly he heard one of the chairs screech against the floor as his Uncle Vernon stood up from the table, seething with anger towards Harry.
When he did, he gasped at the crown she had placed on him.
"That's my son's mate? You really didn't listen to a word he had to say did you?" Severus accused.
"No, I didn't enter, an-"
First he had to tell father what he just heard.
"Mum?" Hayden asked, uncertainty in his voice.
He took a couple steps forward, stumbling, and the dragon surprisingly bowed its head.
"I'm only here to deliver the letter and to make sure that you eat breakfast since you undoubtedly did not eat before leaving Hogwarts" the Italian said right before their breakfast was brought to them to eat.
"It's you we don't know! Heh, you're the juicy news. What quarks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? What mysteries do those muscles mask? Does courage lie beneath those curls? In short what makes a Champion tick?" She asked as she walked around to Cedric and Hayden.
"Hey, please don't start crying" He tried in the most gentle voice he could. He tugged Hayden towards him and gave him a light hug, just in case Hayden wanted to back out of it.
For most of the reception nobody bothered him. Everyone was too worried about themselves and making sure they didn't mess up in front of the higher powered Death Eaters.
"Draco, do you really have no idea
Hayden thoroughly enjoyed doing work for his father. He loved the feeling of having a purpose that spanned to more than just being a pawn.
He quickly found the path and continued to run.
"Are you sure?" Dumbledore commented from the other side of the room.
Hayden couldn't care less for the new rule. He had no interest in the Tournament and was frankly quite glad he was not allowed to enter!
"Of course, I know royalty when I see" The replied with a smirk.
He suddenly felt his stomach drop at the sound of another whine from Hayden. He had completely forgotten that his mate was a nightmare, a bad enough one that he felt he needed the extra safety his wings would have provided.
After a minute of just breathing, Hayden went to grab the soap to wash his hair but was stopped when he heard a knock come from the closed door.
"I'm not emotionally stunted" Draco defended while Hayden laughed.
Hayden stood in front of the mirror in his room, making sure that everything was its place before he went down. The guests had started arriving about 15 minutes before and it is almost time for him to go down and join them.
“Why not? I would be fully within my rights to protect you!” Draco responded with a humph, burying his head into the crook of Hayden’s neck.
Draco gasped in surprise as he unceremoniously hit the mattress, but his surprise quickly turned to amusement once Hayden curled into him.
Hayden nodded his head. Tom gave a slight grin and handed Hayden a mask.
Hayden looked up from reading the letter to Blaise still sitting there.
He still needed to figure out how to deal with that as well. The death of Harry Potter. He should probably talk with his father about that sometime soon.
Maybe it would be good to just have a break for a couple of days, visit his father. Maybe he can help him figure out the next task. Being at the mansion would also probably be better to execute the plan he would have for Dumbledore.
"Do you think that I wouldn't be able to handle the different challenges! Draco I have gone up more than you know and believe me when I say I have seen more horrors than you can imagine. I think I can protect myself just fine!" Hayden gritted out angrily.
Harry was a bit nervous, though. Severus had told him that they were going to get an inheritance test, but Harry didn't quite know what that meant.
"Your attention, please!" Dumbledore called, effectively quieting the excited chatter of the Great Hall. "I'd like to say a few words"
"Does he want to see me?" Hayden asked, uncertain.
The next morning during breakfast, Dumbledore announced that the school would be hosting the Yule ball in a few weeks around mid-January. At the same time, the Headmaster also announced that each of the Heads of Houses will be meeting at separate times with their houses to go over rules for the dance: such as dress code, etiquette, and the teaching of the beginning waltz for the ball.
"Just come with me," Theo responded.
Severus was shocked. They had talked about this subject not too long ago and already his son had found his forever mate?
He was grateful though. He was glad that he is able to experience these normal family moments that he never knew of until his inheritance.
Hayden had always liked Hogsmede, Honeydukes included. The entire place just seemed to always have such an inviting and friendly atmosphere that he could enjoy being in.
"Malfoy is a Veela, correct? Well, Phoenix's and Veela have different courting methods and in this situation there are two ways this can go" Sev started to explain.
"Pity" the man hissed, his red eyes glowing with menace "you were never meant to be found, much less still be alive. What possessed you to think we would ever want filth like you back in out home"
The dragon studied him for a moment before subtly nodding its head.
"Yes, I am!"
"Shouldn't you sound happy to finally meet him?" Severus asked, not wanting to accidentally trigger another crying fest.
Once the butter was melted and distributed around the pan, he started to make the eggs and bacon that he would serve for breakfast.
“Nothing of your concern Krum,” Cedric replied defensively, glaring at the other.
Why should he knock, if his father didn't have to. The Malfoys were beneath him.
Severus was curious as to what was on the paper, but was hesitant to look. After deliberating with himself, he reached over and picked up the paper before starting to read it, all the while still hugging Harry.
Hayden took it as it was a letter. He opened it and saw it was from Draco:
"Why should I tell you?" Hayden asked back, not wanting to give them too much information about his new life.
Thankfully, the bell rang and Theo didn't have to make any decision.
"For a sense of safety or even anonymity. You don't have to wear it if you don't want to, but it's here if you need it" Tom explained.
"Hey, I know you two are awake in there. I can hear you shuffling around. Come on, you're gonna be late for breakfast if you dilly dally anymore than you already are" an amused voice called from the other side of their dorm room door.
"Here, I'll drain the tub for you, why don't you go and get dressed" the blonde chuckled, pressing a small kiss to the other boy's forehead.
He quickly found the blonde in the halls before he could get the Great Hall for lunch. Grabbing his arm, he began to lead him to the Slytherin common rooms.
The spiked dragon growled out in a rough manner.
The cup turned red again and their attention was drawn to it, listening for the next name to be called.
"For you" Theo said as he handed the box to Hayden.
He walked back to the dining room and started to hand out the glasses. He had already given his Aunt Petunia hers and as he walked around to give Dudley and his Uncle Vernon theirs, he tripped and the glasses flew out his hands, spilling their contents all over the people seated at the table.
"We didn't trust you not to drop him, besides, Cissa knew what she was doing" Tom drawled, not amused by the woman's antics.
"Your name must tell a story behind it. Let me guess, your family was lost to you at a young age but have recently found them due to the good will of others, and to prove your worth to them, you were set on entering such a dangerous tournament?"
"Something I hope you'll enjoy" Draco replied softly as he gently brought up a hand to tuck his hair behind his ear. Hayden leaned into the warm hand cupping the side of his face. He smiled as he relished in the feeling.
Blaise and Draco spent a few minutes more just talking about useless subjects. Soon Draco was able to escape his friend and went back to check on his hopefully soon to be boyfriend.
"Yes, you can move in here," Severus said. Hayden gave a happy smile.
"It's my birthday isn't it?" Harry smiled, knowing why Hedwig had given him a present. He has a little box full of the gifts that Hedwig has gotten over the time they've known each other.
No response.
"Hayden." Draco said softly while sitting on the edge of Hayden's bed. "I'm sorry for upsetting you"
With much reluctance the man agreed, and the door closed. The goblin had Harry walk to the center of the room.
Once classes were all done for the day, Hayden and Draco walked back to their room in Slytherin.
Hayden could hear the fireplace come to life and could only guess that his mother walked in the room. He felt the other end of the sofa dip and the other sat down.
Hayden shot up from the dream with tears in his eyes and whirlwind of different emotions.
Hayden quickly rushed to hide in the corner to try and escape his uncle's rage.
But he got up anyway, changed into some fresher clothes and quietly opened his bedroom door.
"Yes, I believe it is. I do have one question though before you go. Have you found the clue the egg hides yet?"
"Not really, there's not really anything for me to look forward to anymore" Hayden replied rather dully.
Smiling even brighter, Hayden once again leaned forward to kiss the other a second time, wrapping his semi-wet arms around Draco's neck. Draco, in turn, hesitantly brought one of his hands up to caress the back of Hayden's head.
"I'm a Veela"
Now it was Hayden's turn. He slowly and hesitantly lowered his hand into the velvety bag, flinching a bit when he felt little sharp claws dig into his skin. He pulled the reptile out to reveal his dragon.
"We leave this to you, Barty"
"Hayden?" Draco whispered into the dark, hoping that would wake the other boy.
Sorry for the chapter, but before I continue I have a question. In the next chapter, I'll be describing Hayden's outfit and there will be more outfits in the future. So, I've been wondering what you all prefer. Do you all like the dresses I've been using or should I start putting Hayden's in suits for special occasions? Any feedback you can give would be fantastic, thank you!
"I'm ready," Hayden said, and they flooed to Riddle Manor.
"Thank you for the warning, but i'm sure i'll be just fine. I have had to deal with the press before" Hayden informed the girl.
He knew that his son's life was practically hell when he was still Harry Potter. He wonders briefly how Malfoy will react if and when Hayden ever decides to tell him this truth.
He desperately wanted to see his son and get to know him, but at the same time, he feared that Hayden wouldn't want anything to do with him because of who he was.
For most of the meeting Lucius Malfoy couldn't seem to stop glancing over at the new addition to the Deatheater ranks and his Lord's son.
"He was Harry Potter"
Unfortunately he had to put it down as he went to his door to see Draco standing there. The man had to hold back a disappointed growl as he stared at the blonde Veela in front of him.
"Hmm" Severus hummed in thought.
Malfoy stayed silent and continued to watch Hayden, curiosity shining in his eyes.
"Mum?" Hayden asked.
He continued to walk further into the rocky terrain, stumbling on the loose bits of uneven rock below his feet.
The Phoenix sighed in resignation as he struggled to try and get to his feet. It took him a couple minutes, but he was finally able to stand. Now he just had to take a step forward.
"I'm fine, thank you" Hayden dismissed before going back to pacing.
"Oi, what are you doing blocking the hallway? Move it" A familiar voice demanded.
He tried to get up, but immediately found that he couldn't due to something weighing him down. He felt heavy.
“What do you mean trouble? Did someone touch you? Who was it?” Draco demanded, ready to kill whoever hurt his love.
"Well, I'll need a piece of parchment and a quill"
Hayden wasn't there.
“Uh, I guess, um” Draco stuttered, wishing he didn't need to ask this. “I was wondering if you knew where Hayden was?” Draco asked quickly. “I haven't been able to find him”
"Actually, yeah. I was wondering if you would be able to help me out with my plan for Harry Potter and Dumbledore"
He just found his mate.
“I am not responsible for your mistakes, Draco Malfoy” Severus stated coldly but calmly. “I will not help to fix what you have broken any more than I have already. If you have failed to talk to my son and mend his heart, then you will find no sympathy with me. Good day” The professor ended with finality, going back to the essay he was grading before.
Once he got up to their room, he paused, taking a breath, preparing himself for an argument that he hoped would not come.
"Do you know what a mate is?"
They mainly walked in silence. Every once in a while one would say something, but it was never anything important, just words to fill the space. Surprisingly enough, the walk wasn't all entirely awkward, it was strangely pleasant. The only thing that might have been awkward was the soft looks Victor would give him when the taller thought he wasn't looking.
"If I could take back every threat I have ever made on you, I would. I want you to be able to feel safe with me, and I will do everything I can to make sure you do!" Tom gave his son one last squeeze before pulling back.
"Harry I will be right back, I need to check on something for a moment" Snape said as he walked out of the room and into his potions lab where he tended to a potion that was in the process of being made.
"Who?"
"You'll know. Besides, what fun is there in telling you when it would be much more amusing to watch you and your mate flounder your way to a confession" Sev laughed as he answered, running a hand through his son's hair.
"You're welcome," Draco said, hugging him back, his blush burning even brighter.
Hayden bowed politely yet stayed quiet. He wasn't quite sure that he wanted to trust them yet.
"Hayden? Will you please open the door?" Draco tried.
He walked to stand beside his father and bowed slightly, tilting his head as he did so.
As Draco was trying to think of what to do next, Hayden gave a loud whine of pain, startling the blonde out of his thoughts. Not even a second later, a light emulated from the boy lying on the bed, enough for Draco to have to look away.
He looked around, noticing that he was laying on his stomach and in the same room he woke up in before.
He waited a couple minutes before leaving his hiding spot behind the bush, making sure that everyone had gone. He stretched for a minute before looking around the room.
He started to fill the bathtub with warm water before stripping out of his clothes and stepped in, letting himself finally completely relax after the stressful last couple days.
Hayden almost dropped his wand in shock, horrified at the thought she knew of something so personal to him.
he thought.
"Alright then, go upstairs and get changed into something nice and we'll floo over" Hayden quickly finished his breakfast then ran up to his room to get changed.
When breakfast was over, Hayden made his way over to the office room the interview was going to be in.
The train soon arrived and Hayden followed the rest of the fourth years into the Great Hall.
Severus looked at the pleading look on his son's face.
"Thank you" Hayden smiled. "Can you call Hedwig for me, please?"
Snape just sighed as he relaxed back into the sofa, wondering why on earth his Slytherins were like this.
"Hayden Snape!" Dumbledore yelled, sounding fed up.
"Hey, Hayden right?" A voice next to him said, startling him out of his thoughts.
"You prick! You know that Harry's been missing since the beginning of the year!" Weasley yelled, his face turning as red as his head.
"Now for those of you who do not know, the Triwizard Tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. For each school, a single student is selected to compete. Let me clear, if chosen, you stand alone, and trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint-hearted. But more of that later, for now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, the Headmistress, Madame Maxime!"
After arranging other details for the upcoming school year, Hayden finally went back up stairs to get ready for bed. Tomorrow he would be waking up early and apperating to Kings Cross with Snape.
Helping Hayden to sit up in bed, he gestured to the mirror on the wall beside the bed. Hayden shakily stood up and went to stand in front of the mirror.
"You know, Veela are more than just soft and loving. We're passionate too" the blonde whispered, the distance between the two become less and less.
“No, get it out,” Harry says, panic still evident in his voice.
“She!” Harry admonished softly.
Also, he is sure that nothing about his entrance has been accidental. Potter and the theraprat think that Draco only reacts towards him and he would bet his right nut that his entry was planned and Draco has tapped right into this carefully laid trap when he scowled at him. He could kick himself for his lack of self-control.
“I needed to get you out of here. I needed to show you that there is something out there that’s worth getting back to,” he cries and then tries to calm himself by breathing deeply a couple of times.
“My… my… WHAT?” Draco wheezes. Scorpius is already making his way towards his room again, when he turns around and looks at the two baffled men sitting around the dining table.
Harry shakes him gently, gripping both of his arms just above the elbow, urging him to focus his gaze on him. He hasn’t even noticed that his breathing has got out of control. It is only when Harry says, “Slow breaths, Draco. Slow breaths.” And he stands before him and breathes in deeply, showing Draco exactly what he wants to see from him. It is not as easy as Harry makes it seem to get his breathing under control when he feels like his windpipe is closing off, but eventually he manages.
He just needed to sleep. Today had been a shock to his system and his friends were right. He wasn’t acting as usual. Seeing Draco should’ve made him want to curl over and cry but it almost made him feel relieved. Like he wasn’t alone in the fear he felt. He couldn’t fully forgive Draco, and by no means did he want to befriend the boy... But doing the right thing had made him feel better.
He felt fresh and awake. Yet, a sad tired still lingered deep inside of him. He pinched his arm for being so dramatic and made his way to his kitchen.
Once the toast popped he gently plucked them out, managing to only burn himself a little bit. He dropped the toast on his plate and sucked on his index finger. It soothed the burn only slightly but it was better than nothing. He pulled his finger out so he could spread jam over his toast. The high pitched whistle of the kettle caught his attention. He poured some of the steaming chamomile into a teacup. After trial and error he had discovered chamomile helped his stomach the most. He never understood why his stomach hurt so bad in the morning… his mother always told him it was just the nervous jitters.
His food was finished without entertainment. He was bored, and in his boredom found his mind wandering to the small letter on his kitchen counter. Draco told himself it wasn’t worth it as he washed and dried his dishes.
Draco had always only been a Seeker. In fact, he wasn’t sure if he could be a Keeper. Sure, he’d seen his teammates do it. And while sitting in on many practices he knew the rules and strategies down to the last letter. However, to try out for a professional team was something Draco had never thought of.
Draco nodded. Sure, everything was going to change. Just like Harry had wanted it to change.
Okay this is it. The end. Or rather how I imagined the story to end.
“I’m sorry Mr Potter, but I think you will find that your opinion doesn’t count here,” the Head of the DMLE says calmly and then turns to Draco. “Mr Malfoy, you have the choice to either drink the potion willingly or have it administered by force.” He conjures a glass of water, then rummages through his pocket and produces a small vial, filled with a clear potion. He adds a couple of drops to the water and pushes the water over to Draco.
“I’ll be out of your hair. As long as there is no bleeding and the contractions are manageable, there really isn’t any reason for me to disturb you,” she had explained and made her way towards the hall.
“It is going to be okay. There are only people here who you have met before, except for Molly and Arthur. I have spoken to every person in attendance and they are all fine with you coming along today. So, focus on the food and it’s going to be okay,” he says and breathes in deeply in an attempt to urge Draco to imitate him again. Draco does and it really makes him feel better. “And now, please loosen your grip on my hand. I think my pinky is already starting to die off.” They both break out in quiet laughter and Draco has nearly forgotten where they are and what he is about to do, when suddenly the door is ripped open and everything comes crashing down on him again, making him flinch violently.
Even though it only takes Draco a couple of hours to think things over, as Potter has phrased it, Potter still doesn’t return for a week. One really long, dull week. Draco eats, paints, sits through his silent therapy sessions, wanks and sleeps. He uses his time to think about himself for the first time in what feels like forever. Potter is right, this isn’t how he has pictured his life to be. He does want to get out of here. He wants to see his mother when he pleases and not when Potter takes him. He wants to see Pansy and Blaise and Greg again. He wants to work and travel and, let’s face it, he wants to fuck Potter.
Draco finds himself in the foyer of Potter’s London house the next day. It’s confusing. Hasn’t Potter been the one to say that whatever they had been doing had to stop? Why would he bring him here if he didn’t want to fuck? Potter leads him into the sitting room where they sit down on a large, grey sofa. Draco looks about the room. It has been furnished without finesse, but it is homey and warm and exactly the way he would have pictured Potter’s home. Harry’s home.
After his breakdown Potter comes by more often, almost every day, except for Sundays because that is apparently when he has lunch with his family. He is also more open with Draco, telling him more of the truth instead of the censored bullshit he has been bothering Draco with for the last few weeks.
“Ah yes, the No-Talking-Bit still continues?” he says and smirks a little. No answer. Man, he is such a prat. And, of course, he doesn’t go away but keeps on talking instead.
When she tells him one day that this is going to be her last visit, he pulls her along to his painting. A small gasp escapes her when she realizes that he has been painting her portrait while she has been sitting in Potter’s armchair.
Over the next few weeks they pick up their former routine. They go out to eat every day in a different restaurant or take away places and afterwards they apparate all over the country to different sights. They sit together at Dunnet Head, the most northern point of mainland Britain, looking over the sea just able to catch a glimpse of the Orkneys, when Harry proposes to switch up their routine.
“Never have I ever been this embarrassed by my own offspring,” Draco mutters as he turns towards Harry.
“This was fun, Draco,” he says cheerfully and walks over to the door. Draco looks after him and sees how he hesitates with his hand on the door knob. “I will be over again next week,” he says before opening the door and stepping through it. Draco cannot help but feel that his last words have been a threat.
“I’ll be back in a second,” he whispers against Draco’s skin and before he has any chance to grab him, he is out of the room. But he is true to his word and returns only a few seconds later with a small vial in his hand. He holds it out to Draco and without a question he gulps the potion down. In part because he trusts Potter and in part because he’d welcome the poison. As soon as he tastes the sour potion, however, he knows it isn’t poison but Dreamless Sleep. The drowsiness comes instantly, but he fights it and grabs for Potter’s hand instead.
I'd love to hear what you think!
“Little?” Draco grumbled. “I have certain transformed body parts that can attest to the fact that he is anything but little.” He was exhausted; everything hurt. The fact that he had done it, that he had just given birth to their son, had not yet registered with him. Harry’s arms, which had been holding him for the crucial parts of the delivery, tightened around him.
Lovegood doesn’t start again on the topic, but gives him some time to collect his bearings. And when he finally pulls himself together, she changes the topic of conversation.
“You can say it now,” Draco says and again a smile is audible in his voice.
“What is it?” he repeats. “Don’t you want to take it off?” Draco shakes his head. “Why? You’re not cold, are you?” He shakes his head. “Is it about the withdrawal?” He rolls his eyes. “Sorry,” Potter snaps without heat, “This would be easier if you just answered me! Is it your hair?” Draco nods and drops his gaze, embarrassed. Potter takes a couple of steps towards Draco and reaches out, lifting his chin. “Is it too long?” he asks softly. Draco’s eyes brim with tears again and he gives the slightest nod. Potter drops his hand immediately and rummages through the side pockets of his shorts. He pulls out some kind of dark grey rag and holds it up.
“Me, too! Like, thank you for noticing, Draco, I very much love myself as well. It makes you sound just as big-headed–”
“I just… I thought… I thought that if I was still in heat,
“This might help,” he says triumphantly, beaming up at Draco. The rag turns out to be a thin beanie which Draco grabs without further hesitation and puts on his head.
A large family was a blessing in many respects, but the number of presents was simply too much for a three-year-old. He had been bouncing up and down, a little higher than should be possible just from his own strength. In anticipation of an eruption of James’s accidental magic, Draco had silently communicated the end of the gift opening part of the party, and Harry had quickly diverted James’s attention by announcing another party game. Draco had swiftly summoned all the unopened gifts and banished them to the closet.
Even though, of course, there isn’t a chance in hell that Potter would ever be able to land him. Come to think of it, he finds it quite offending that the assistant would think otherwise.
“Draco, it’s May! You don’t need a coat or a hat,” he chuckles. Draco glares at him and turns on his heel, Potter follows him, probably making sure that he picks something suitable to wear this time. He sheds the coat easily but is reluctant to part with the hat.
“Shhh,” Draco makes, “don’t be scared.” He lets his right hand wander over Potter’s body again, brushing it over his swollen cock, making it twitch and a small droplet of precome drip onto Potter’s stomach.
,” Harry mumbles, speaking the second part of his sentence so rapidly that Draco has trouble understanding him. It actually takes him a few seconds before he realises what Harry has just said.
“Trust me, it is going to be okay.” He shakes his head, because it probably isn’t. It is one thing to have Harry’s friends visit him individually, on their own, at the ward, but it is a whole other thing to see all of them at the same time and on their territory no less. It is literally like walking into the lion’s den. Because they are all Gryffindors. And don’t forget the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs who are bound to be there. So, there are going to be eagles and badgers as well. There’s no kidding around with eagles and probably not with badgers either. Especially if they are honey badgers. And Harry would be the kind of person to only choose the honey badgers out of the whole house of badgers that he could have chosen from. And isn’t the one Weasley married to that French girl, the half Veela? She’s bound to be fierce, French and Veela, that sounds like an explosive combination. So, no, he really doesn’t have any desire to go to the Burrow with Harry.
“How ever did we manage to make something this perfect?” Harry asked. They fell silent as they both drank in the sight of their new-born son with wide, shell-shocked eyes.
“I’m sorry this is happening to you,” Draco replies, “But it’s what you need. It’s going to make you feel better.” Potter breaks out into an incredulous laugh.
“Or our son,” Draco interjected stubbornly.
And then suddenly, “Hey Draco!” His head snaps up again. Potter the Prat has approached his table and has, devoid of any manners whatsoever, just like Draco remembers him, pulled out the opposite chair. He sits down and looks into Draco’s face, smiling. The images don’t stop flashing through his mind, but they change. Him stepping on Potter’s face brutally, cracking his nose, Potter looking up at him, face swollen, eyes pleading, him looking up at Potter, reaching out, panic in both their faces as the orange light of violent flames flickers around them.
“Draco,” he pleads and, of course, Draco knows that Potter is only trying to do the right thing, but he needs this. He needs the distraction and, damn it, he has wanted to do this with him for weeks. The prospect of being denied again together with everything else that has happened today lets the frustration rise inside of him. Why does everything always have to be so hard? Why does everything always have to be such a fucking struggle? Tears well in his eyes again, because how could his life be any more unfair, and he begins to struggle against Potter’s embrace again. Potter tries to keep him there, grabbing his arms, pulling him close, trying to somehow get Draco to calm down, but he won’t. He won’t because he can’t. For a moment it looks as if Potter is going to punch him but then he pulls Draco close with one big effort and kisses him.
The picture frames that lined the walls hadn’t been moved either. All of them had been neatly hung at the same height thus creating a border around the room. The pictures were from different trips that had taken Draco all around the world. He had needed to get out after the war. He had needed to see something else, something besides this fucked up, grieving excuse for a country.
Harry tightened his arms around his husband in a show of support, not because he was really scared that he might get up and leave.
“Do you want me to pull out?” he asks, because he needs to make sure that Harry wants this, while he is at the same time unsure if he could stop himself now.
“You are such a prat,” Harry says fondly.
“Well, that’s rude. Not offering your guest a drink as well,” Harry says when he is sure that Malfoy won’t hex him.
His hands are still wandering over Potter’s body, caressing and manipulating his flesh on their way, until his right hand reaches Potter’s cock. He wraps his fingers around the hard, heated flesh and begins to stroke the other boy in time with his thrusts. Potter’s cock feels velvety soft against his hand. It is quite a lot bigger than is usual for an omega penis, big enough to stretch a person’s rim painfully when he is fucking them. The thought of letting Potter, an omega, fuck him, makes his cock jump where it is buried in the other’s tight channel. Soon his thigh muscles begin to tremble from the exertion of keeping up the slow pace.
“How should I know? Weasley? Longbottom? Thomas? Or any of your little Gryffindor pals,” he snaps.
“Send the FUCKING PATRONUS,” he shouted back, and threw one of his potions at Harry’s head. Harry ducked and the potion whizzed by his head, hitting the carpet behind him and remaining thankfully intact.
“Oh Draco, I’m so sorry,” she calls out, when she sees that he is the only one whose plate is still empty. “Here, give me your plate.” And when Draco doesn’t move to comply, Harry takes his plate and hands it to her.
“No,” Draco shakes his head and reaches up to cup Harry’s face in his hand. “It’s just been a while.” Harry leans down and kisses him. He has promised Draco that he would come on his cock, so he will have to take this a little slower anyway, for as much as he would like to plough into Draco and lose himself in the search of his own pleasure right now, he also wants to feel him tighten around him.
Draco decides to take advantage of the situation and grabs the hair in the nape of Potter’s neck, yanking his head up and kisses him filthily, his tongue fucking into Potter’s mouth the way he had wished to be fucked by him. Potter nearly sobs into his mouth and when he feels Potter swaying slightly he changes the pace of his kiss and makes it languid and almost sweet. They break apart and Draco watches Potter’s eyes flutter open. For a few seconds his eyes are warm, calm, contented even, but then Potter shuts down and his eyes fill with regret. Draco’s heart sinks. So, Potter doesn’t want him after all. He must have misunderstood him, misinterpreted the signs. Maybe there haven’t been any signs at all and Draco has made them all up in his head. He
,” he growls, but Harry enjoys himself far too much to give in easily.
“Yeah. Well, first of all we would have to test that theory, of course, but then there are hand jobs, blow jobs, all sorts of jobs really. And then you could always try topping, if that would be something you would want to do,” he enumerates.
“No. I defeated Voldemort. An omega couldn’t have done that,” Potter retorts. He is grasping for straws now. Trying to will away his secondary gender, when it is so obviously presenting itself.
“I am not,” Draco replied instantly, not even needing to think about it.
“Are you alright?” he asks, sounding genuinely concerned. Draco nods and tries to give him a grateful smile. Potter’s reaction is to pull Draco’s hand towards his face and place a kiss on his palm. He isn’t in any way equipped to deal with what the gesture makes him feel, so he just closes his eyes and tries to think of nothing. It is a vain attempt because as soon as his eyes are closed images of his father flood his mind and the sobbing starts again.
“Do you want to steal her?” Harry asked, in a conspiring tone.
He gasps at the display before him, his mouth runs dry, his cock twitches painfully in his pants, suddenly growing fully erect. He is overcome with the overpowering need to mount and fuck and kiss and bite. So much so, that it is hard to breathe. He gasps again and again, while his heart hammers in his chest as if it wants to escape his ribcage.
“I can be here for your next heat if you want me to,” he replies somewhat reluctantly, because it isn’t really what he wants. He wants Harry for himself, for every day of the year not just the odd days that he is in heat. But if that’s what Harry is offering he is going to take it.
He shifts slightly, making himself comfortable between Draco’s thighs, lowering himself onto his elbows and kisses him again, more deeply this time, because he
“Fuck,” Potter moans, “I need…” But apparently, he isn’t sure what he needs exactly, because he trails off.
“Ouch! That was uncalled for,” Harry yelps and when they make eye contact again, they both resolve into laughter. But laughing hurts, so Draco snuggles back against him.
He pinches himself, but nothing happens. He doesn’t wake up, he just remains in the Janus Thickey common room. Does that mean that this isn’t a dream after all? NO! It can’t. This is not something Draco can live with. He stumbles backwards, nearly knocking over a chair and takes three unsteady steps to the side. His hand brushes his breakfast tray and before he even really notices it, he pushes the tray off the table. He sees it falling to the floor in slow motion and he is sure that it won’t hit the floor, because in dreams that isn’t what happens. He is sure it will reverse its fall and sit on the table again, just as if nothing has ever disturbed it. But then it hits the floor.
“Who would believe me?” he begins speaking, voice low, in an attempt to make it clear to the other boy that he means no harm. “As soon as your heat is over, you can go on telling the others that you’re an alpha. I can set you up with the scent suppressing potions you need for that.”
He rests his forehead against Harry’s, breathing him in, marvelling at the fact that he is allowed to touch the other boy like this. For the second time this evening, he can feel his orgasm approaching. He feels his balls drawing up, the muscles in his lower abdomen tense in preparation of what is to come. His cock doesn’t slide as easily into Harry’s body as it did a second ago, it catches on Harry’s rim, making the other boy gasp.
“Don’t be. You have accomplished so much more than this. And I’ll be here. I won’t let go off you,” Draco whispers back. Potter leans in to kiss Draco one last time before he does as he was told and turns around, presenting Draco with his arse.
Draco enjoys the trips they take and often wishes that he didn’t have to return to the Janus Thickey Ward afterwards. Only the other people bother him. Sometimes when there are too many people, Draco grabs Potter’s hand for safety, to anchor him. Sometimes when there aren’t a lot of people Potter grabs Draco’s hand and he lets him because it feels good to be touched.
“Good morning, young man,” Draco answers icily, apparently still angry at his behaviour last night. But Scorpius doesn’t seem to pick up on his mood. Instead he bangs about the kitchen, getting himself a cup of coffee, whistling to himself. When he walks out, towards them, Draco glares at him, but Scorpius ignores him, walks towards him and throws an arm around him.
They floo to St. Mungo’s and when they get there, Draco goes straight to his room. He thinks about changing into his night clothes and trying to sleep, but Potter is surely speaking to Schmendrick now. About him. He should be privy to that conversation. Just because he is going through a rough patch doesn’t mean that people are allowed to talk about him or decide things for him.
Sometimes the odd visitor leaves a Prophet behind and Draco usually keeps his distance. If he were ready to face the outside world he wouldn’t be in here, would he?
“No, but we could try for a girl of our own?” He didn’t really mean it as a question, but it sure came out as one.
Harry flat out laughed. “What are you going to say when this pregnancy is over and you’re just as scatterbrained?”
“You did so good, Draco,” Harry gushed. “Look at him, he’s perfect.”
“Fuck,” Potter groans again. His eyes are black and they flick between the point where Draco’s finger is disappearing into his body, up to his cock that is leaking in earnest now, up to his eyes and back down again. His mouth is hanging open slightly and his breathing is ragged.
“You so do!
“I’m scared, Harry,” Draco whispered, and when Harry looked down, his eyes were swimming with tears.
“Damn it,” he cursed as another wave of pain shot through his lower back and belly. He breathed, cursed and then finally relaxed again as the pain subsided.
“Oh,” is all Harry says to that. Draco can see his disappointment in his face and thinks that maybe, just maybe, he can be bold and daring for once too. Harry has already admitted to having a crush on him, to having asked for him and now that he thinks about it he really needs to do some more research on that particular topic. He has slipped, of course, calling Harry things that kind of gave him away, but he hasn’t outright admitted to anything. But Harry beats him to it.
“Okay. I think I would like to take a step back from work. I want to spend more time with my family,” he said. Draco had been anticipating something like this. In the last few months Harry had taken to coming home early a lot. He had rejected an offer for promotion and whenever he talked about work, Draco had heard his frustration. Still, it was nice to hear Harry finally say it out loud.
Before dinner he has another therapy session that mostly consists of himself and his therapist keeping silent. At first it is funny to see him squirm in his seat uncomfortably when Draco doesn’t speak. But after a while he grows tired of it. So does his therapist. He suggests art therapy. Draco doesn’t really have a choice but to go. In the beginning his paintings suck ass, but after a while he gets the hang of it and actually enjoys it.
It feels good to be back in his childhood home, despite all the bad memories he connects with certain parts of the house. Time passes without him really noticing it until Potter says around half past seven that they need to get going. He shakes his head frantically. He isn’t prepared to leave his mother behind again. Potter sends a sad smile towards him and says, “I’m sorry, Draco. I can’t break you out of St. Mungo’s. But we can come back next week, if you want to.” He rubs his hands across his face, but gets up reluctantly and hugs his mother goodbye.
“H-how does it feel?” Potter stutters, repeating his own question back to him.
“Let me pay quickly and then I will take you to the most expensive shop I know,” Potter says smirking. But Draco shoots out a hand and grabs Potter around the wrist, willing him to look at him. When their eyes lock, he gives a barely visible shake of his head.
“Well, now they are,” Harry retorted. For a while they stood quietly in the hall looking at the twins, both caught up in their own thoughts. When they spoke again, they did so at the same time.
They fall back onto the bed, Potter resting on his back and Draco on top of him. Their bodies slot together flawlessly, Draco’s narrow hips are settled between Potter’s spread thighs, their cocks sliding together with every movement and Draco would have been able to do this forever if it weren’t for so many layers of cloth in between them. The need for skin on skin contact increases in both of them and soon they are pulling and tearing at each other’s shirts and trousers, albeit with little success, while plundering each other’s mouths at the same time.
“Potter,” Malfoy growls, pulling his wand out of his dressing gown and pointing it at Harry. His eyes are blazing fire and Harry knows that he is itching to cast. He really shouldn’t be turned on now. He knows this, but apparently his body is mutinying as of now.
“Draco, no,” he says gently, but Draco only makes a whining sound in his throat and looks up at Harry with wide eyes. Draco grabs him by the collar and pulls him close. He kisses him again, but Potter still resists.
“Ewww, I meant you, you fucking prat,” Harry cries, shoving Draco almost off the bed. Draco throws his head back and laughs openly, from the belly and the sound is so addictive that Harry reaches out again and pulls him back underneath the covers. Without having breached the topic of Harry staying over, they curl up together and close their eyes.
“No, Mr Potter,” he repeats. “This apartment is absolutely sound proof. It will only alert –” But Harry never hears the end of that sentences for Scorpius stumbles again, nearly crashing to the floor. Harry manages to catch him. Scorpius grabs at his arms, pulling himself up, giggling all the way.
Granger leans back in her chair and whistles at everything she has had to take in in the last few minutes. “You have had sex with Harry,” she says, “And you spoke!” He shakes his head violently.
“This is going to be hell,” Harry whispered, wide-eyed.
“I can’t, Harry,” Draco sobbed. “I don’t want to do this anymore.”
“No,” he says, “No, Malfoy. Stop it. I never wanted to touch him.” But he knows that he is convincing exactly no one, because his breath comes in strained huffs and his trousers are growing tighter by the second. Because all of Malfoy’s talk has left him with one thought on his mind, to fuck Malfoy.
“So, I’m going to be the bigger man. I’m not going to make a fuss. When you actually decide to talk again, and Hermione says it’s bound to happen soon, I’m not going to ignore you, I’m going to talk to you. I’m going to be civil and what not. Maybe we’ll even end up friends.” This time he outright laughs, as if the notion of them being friends is the most ridiculous thing he has ever heard, which it is as far as Draco is concerned. “But I swear, if you mess with Harry, I’m going to mess with you. And I’m going to enjoy it!” Draco has never thought of Weasley as scary. Ridiculous, yes, but scary, not so much. Anyway, at this moment he is. Scary that is. Weasley glares at him for a few more moments and then says unexpectedly and totally out of the blue, “So, you up for a round of chess?”
“Are you sure, Draco?” Harry says, hesitating, looking at him with unsure eyes. He is flushed from what they have been doing, his eyes are almost black with lust, yet he is apparently still ready to stop at any moment. He doesn’t know how to show him that he really wants this. He knows why Harry says what he is saying. He knows that he is only trying to protect Draco, but it is also kind of infuriating. Especially when he says, “Draco, this isn’t a good idea. We should stop this!” He growls in frustration and directs Harry’s hand to where he wants to be touched.
“It was easy to get them to sign off on my guardianship. Only had to play the hero card twice,” he continues now smirking. Draco can feel a smile coming on, so he averts his gaze and then turns his back on Potter completely. He isn’t prepared to forgive him. He snatches the book he has been reading from his nightstand and goes over to the bathroom and locks himself in there. He slides to the floor with his back to the door and begins to read, ignoring all of Potter’s attempts to make him forgive him.
“Why didn’t you know the last time?” Draco pulls away and looks at him. Probably searching his face for a sign that he can trust Harry with this information.
“Come on, out with it,” Harry prompted. Draco groaned, this time not from arousal, but from embarrassment.
“I’m sorry, love. No, it wasn’t,” Harry replied quietly, taking a couple of steps back from the bed, heeding the explosion, but it didn’t come. He walked towards the bathroom quickly and when he came back he was holding the potions that Luna had left for Draco.
“Oh, nothing,” Draco deflected hastily and just passed Harry on his way to the bedroom. He quickly prepared for bed and when Harry came out of the bathroom a couple of minutes later, he had already switched off the lights. Harry made his way over to the bed and scooted in next to Draco, immediately reaching out and pulling him towards himself.
Longbottom doesn’t talk much, most of it is meaningless chit chat, but just as every visitor before him he, apparently, feels the strong urge to tell Draco exactly what he thinks about him. Just like Granger when she first visited him, just like Weasley and Lovegood in the previous two days.
“Tell me,” he repeats, “What’s wrong?” Harry avoids his gaze, casting his eyes down in embarrassment, but Draco doesn’t plan on letting him off the hook. He shoves him lightly in an attempt to get him talking.
