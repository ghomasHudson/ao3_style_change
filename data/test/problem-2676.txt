Malfoys tone was icy and he released Harry only to scan him as if in inspection,
He heard movement and the spellfire resume and decided now was better than ever to try to get the guy’s position, trusting Harry not the accidentally hex him in return. Dashing forward he found the older man’s back was to him. He didn’t seem to have heard Draco come around behind him. It was now or never.
“Look at me, Draco.” Harry’s voice was gentle despite their fight moments before and it hit worse than any spell. Potter had always been magnetic. But he’d always thought of them as opposite poles, ever pushing the other away. Now here they were four years after Hogwarts and everything that had happened and Potter was trying to pull him in. Wanted a connection rather than to keep pushing each other away. When Draco turned to look back at Potter he found it hard to breathe. There wasn’t a trace of anger left on his face. No animosity. Just concern and something like hope.
Yet, even as he thought that to himself he felt a twinge of something he didn’t want to name in his chest. Instead he schooled his expression into a smile and shrugged, “I fold, remind me never to play poker with you.”
“Because he’s smart.” Draco huffed, leaning back in his chair to stare at the ceiling, “Knows how to erase his tracks.”
Draco left quickly after the thought came. He was being overdramatic, even for him, to act this way. Potter had only done what he had to in the moment to create a distraction. It didn’t mean anything. It was just an act, to hide his spell and maintain their cover. It meant nothing to Potter. Draco would have done the same. Wouldn’t he? Suddenly he wasn’t so sure. The uncertainty felt like bile in his gut, an ache worse than any blow. He was deeply unsettled and clenched his eyes shut to steady his breaths.
Harry glared at the other nickname but nodded his head in agreement all the same. Resisting the urge to jinx Malfoy for smirking at him like that.
“Why?”
He thought again to how certain Beth seemed, how Harry had acted in private all those times when he could have simply ignored or turned away from him. All the times he beat him at chess, recited his takeout order from memory or chided Draco for staying up too late. Draco thought of the way he knew he looked at Harry and he reevaluated the way Harry looked at him.
“Well, darling,” He huffed out, “let’s talk history then.”
“Easy for you to say when you casually hog up so much space.”
Beth nodded as if in understanding, “And how’d that come about?”
His french was flawless and his smug grin meant he probably didn't think Harry understood a word he said. Not, that he did really. But one doesn't live with Hermione and not pick up a few things. Luckily for Harry that meant her interest in French after Bill and Fleur’s wedding had rubbed off on him. Somewhat.
Magical flower shops are much like muggle ones. Except it’s inadvisable to stop and smell the roses; something Harry had learned the hard way when Hermione and Ron had gotten married and Harry had tried to help. He’s still got the scar on his nose and so keeps a healthy distance between himself and the plants. In fact, Harry keeps his hand in Malfoys as they enter the warm building and catch the attention of the shopkeeper. The last thing he needed was for Malfoy to wander off and find trouble he’d likely blame on Harry. Malfoy gives him a little tug but Harry just repositions his hand to their fingers are intertwined and gives him a grin, knowing he’s definitely annoying the other man.
“Decided to come back did you? Find anything during your ‘recon’?” Malfoy said sharply, annoyed at his own annoyance. But it was reasonable when one’s partner, auror partner, disappeared for hours! Without saying where. Idiot reckless gryffindor.
“Look- I’m sorry okay? I know you’re pissed and you’ve every right to be. I overstepped a line. But you’ve made your feelings pretty clear so just- just get your anger out now because we have a case to finish. After that you can hex me or whatever revenge you want for the kiss.”
“Well, it’s something.” Potter agreed, still looking down at the photos lost in thought, “Killer’s occupation, maybe? Writer, scholar-”
The woman's face lit up in a lopsided grin, “Congratulations! I’ve just asked my Anne to marry me as well! Last week! Have you two been planning long or?”
“Are you afraid?” Draco surprised himself by asking, but found he genuinely did care. She seemed a good person. She’d been friendly to him so far at least.
“For you, darling. Could you place them on the table?” Potter was giving him a soft smile, eyes twinkling and for a moment Draco felt as if he’d had the wind knocked out of him.
Draco left for his morning patrol before Harry even woke, only pausing briefly as something in his chest clenched at leaving Harry fitfully sleeping on the sofa. He barely fit on the thing, legs curled up in what couldn’t have been a comfortable way as his face twisted in a frown. Even in sleep he was fighting something. Ever the hero. A quote came unbidden to him during that moment of hesitation by the door,
If you had told him years ago that he would be living with and settling into a routine with Draco Malfoy, teenage Harry would have been equal parts suspicious and horrified. Now however twenty two year old Harry unsure what to feel about it being as easy as it was odd. They avoided each other as much as one could in a one bedroom apartment; meaning they really couldn’t. And so developed a routine of dancing around each other on their off time; sharing meals out of necessity and discussing the case. Draco had taken to carrying a journal and scoping the local cafes and business under the guise of writing. Harry had begun his cover work with ollivander the day before and it had been… interesting to say the least.
Harry shook his head, “Nothing. Not a trace of anything unusual.”
“There has to be some way, some residual magic to trace him by-”
“Don’t you dare.” Harry narrowed his eyes at Draco who just raised a brow in question, “You’re far more comfortable than these hospital pillows.”
Damn Potter. Surprising him like that. Of course he’d blush from embarrassment! No one had ever- No, he was calm. Nonetheless, he couldn’t help admiring the arrangement as he placed it on the table. He could feel his blush deepening as he sat and was hit with Beth and Anne’s cheeky knowing looks. Potter, the git, acted like nothing was amiss as he served them. Draco finally found out what had smelled so delicious as he placed individual bowls of a soup he announced as “Massor Dal” and placed a long serving plate of Tarte flambée on the table. After assuring everyone had a drink Potter joined them and they sunk into conversation. Potter and Beth easily fell into a discussion of the ingredients he’d used and why he’d selected each dish. Draco felt his cheeks heating once again when Potter answered that he'd been attempting to find a complimentary blend of Indian and French dishes “to represent both Damien and my cultures” and placed a gentle hand atop his. Draco resolutely ignored the pounding of his heart. If this was what a dinner with him as a fiance was like, well- Draco cut off such unhelpful thoughts and went back to enjoying the meal. It was honestly well-prepared and the blend of flavors somehow worked. Clearly his cover story should have been a chef. Though, he wouldn’t be able to talk to people as much from a kitchen. Draco frowned as the image of Potter commanding a kitchen refused to leave his mind.
Draco nodded, swallowing before speaking, “Yes, I’m fine. It’s only that this-” He gestures between them with the hand Harry isn’t holding, “it has to wait. Figuring out what we are to each other and how this changes things between us, it has to wait. We have a case to solve.”
Draco nodded again, and found himself speaking, “I understand how you feel.”
“Tell me about her.”
Draco didn't know how to reply so he didn't. Potter took his silence as his que to leave but before he'd even made the choice to do so Draco had reached out to grab his hand. As if he were drawn to. As if taking Potter's hand in his own was the most natural thing in the world. Yet, the other man didn't pull away. Just spoke softly, "Draco?"
Draco makes a friend!
Malfoy’s unreadable eyes searched him in the dark and slowly, ever so slowly he relaxed and gave a nod. And if they fell asleep facing one another well, that was clearly because they couldn’t trust each other. Not because of anything else.
He was carrying a tray of coffees, wearing the same clothes he’d had on when they fought that madman and they were noticeably rumpled and stained at the end of the sleeves with what harry flinched to realize was probably his blood. His hair wasn’t it’s usual stylishly disheveled state but flat and looked as if he’d run his hands through it a hundred times. When his eyes found Harry’s he nearly dropped the tray, pausing only momentarily to set it on the counter before half running to Harry’s bedside and crushing him in a hug.
“Go home,” she tells him. “You’ve been here all afternoon.”
“Yeah, okay,” Draco says. “I’ll just be a few.” He slips into the bathroom and shuts the door while Potter’s still hunting for his pants. He stands dead-still and listens, hears the floorboards creak as Potter leaves the bedroom. He sighs and turns away from the door, and decides that the conversation he’s going to have with Potter will be hellishly awkward whether he spends the ten minutes prior to it worrying over it or not. He opts to enjoy his shower.
“You have quite an eye for valuables, I see,” Draco said.
“What…”
“I did think about asking you,” Malfoy said after a minute.
“Bloody hell,” Harry said, his hands stilling. “You’ve memorized the entire thing, haven’t you?”
“I could kill you,” Draco says. His heart is pounding and he wills his hands to not tremble.
“Precisely,” Draco said, and smiled. And he’d best end it there. He wouldn’t want to push too far too fast. “Come along. I’ll show you the chore list. Now, all of these have got to be done each day…”
“You’ve got your own wand, you know,” Harry said, but he cast another spell around Malfoy.
There are three crows out there, perched on the bare branches and silhouetted against the clear blue sky. They watch him with glittering black eyes. One of them hops and flutters to a lower branch for an easier view. Another ruffles its feathers, resettling its wings against its body, and caws again.
you’d come with me and I’m holding you to it.”
He whines even though Potter is shockingly gentle. His arse is too tender for this to be entirely pleasurable but the edge of pain to it isn’t enough to put him off, and he can feel himself getting hard again. He tilts his hips, lifting up on his knees to make it easier for Potter to press deeper. He whimpers as Potter pushes in up to his knuckles, and the slick sound of Potter’s fingers working in and out of him is deliciously obscene.
He could have gone to a less-crowded place, but Diagon Alley is the center of Wizarding Britain. Lots of Wizards, lots of homes and businesses, lots of Floos. He needs that congestion, that dense tangle of pipes and conduits, for this to work.
“I can’t,” he repeated. “Look, the bond’s not worn off completely yet. We’re stuck living together until then, and if he doesn’t feel the same then I don’t want to make things awkward.”
, then reaches up to scratch idly at an itch on his shoulder while he waits for the medicine to work on his thigh. His fingers find something there, something stuck to him. He picks a fingernail under it and peels it off, and can feel it unsticking all the way across his back in a thin shower of crusted blood flaking loose.
Dead silence.
“Malfoy,” Potter says again, helpless.
“He even had Malfoy fooled,” Ron went on, and Harry bit back a groan. “He managed to creep in and run a smuggling ring right under Malfoy’s pointy nose.”
“Just another day in the life of the Chosen One,” Harry said. Then, “What are you doing?”
They’re in Harry’s cupboard under the stairs. Harry knows objectively that it’d be a tight squeeze for two grown men to fit in here, but from this deep inside Harry’s memory it feels larger than it ought to, like he’s as small as a child again. It’s exactly the same, from the thin, lumpy pallet the Dursleys had crammed in here for him to sleep on, to the small stack of clothes folded into clumsy little squares and stacked as neatly as a small boy could manage, to the handful of broken toys he’d quietly rescued from the bin and stashed away in the deepest corner of his cupboard.
, that’s nice, that’s really very nice. He slides his hands around Malfoy’s hips to grope at his arse—these fucking trousers, Harry’s been dying to peel them off Malfoy all bloody day—and Malfoy rewards him by grinding up against Harry. Fuck, if Harry trusted the walls in this place at all, he’d have Malfoy pushed up against the nearest one in no time.
Upstairs, the front door slammed shut. Footsteps crossed overhead and then came thumping down the stairs.
“The pleasure’s all mine,” Harper replied, smiling, and gave Draco’s hand a firm shake. “When do I start?”
But they didn’t have any say in this, did they? This wasn’t their choice, and ultimately it didn’t matter what they thought. They’d all been through a war together; they’d still be his friends no matter who he stuck his dick in. Or who stuck their dick in him.
“Helped you,” she says immediately. “I would have helped you. The way people with lycanthropy are treated is despicable. If you’d contracted it, I would have helped cover up your absences. Mentioned to people that you were just in the back room, brewing something important and couldn’t be disturbed. Or that I’d just seen you that morning. Of course I would have helped. I’d have done everything I could to help you.”
Harry came first, making the most wonderful little gasps and moans against Draco’s mouth, and he was so fixated on the feel of it, how Harry went rigid in his arms and how his hips jerked. Draco slid his hand down, brushing over the phoenix tattoo on Harry’s side, down to his cock. He rubbed gently over it until he could feel the dampness of Harry’s come soaking through the fabric of his trousers, until Harry whined and pushed Draco’s hand away.
That’s enough to distract his mother from his well-being. And then instead of a thousand questions about how he’s eating and sleeping and taking care of himself, she has a lot of questions about Katie and what she’s been up to. She seems brighter when she asks them, though. It’s likely reassured her to know that he’s got plans that don’t involve his apothecary. His lack of a social life is another thing with which Narcissa is inordinately concerned.
“Come over next Tuesday and I’ll keep you from going off anywhere, and we’ll figure it out from there,” Potter says. “Sound okay?”
Draco’s not aware that his hands are shaking until Potter very carefully takes the nearer one and holds it still.
“They’re like children,” Granger says, and Draco nods, forcing down a wave of jealousy at their casual affection and how easy it looks. That’s something that’s been happening more and more often lately.
Potter shrugs. “You just look the type, I guess.” He frowns at the wine list, brows drawing together like he’s working a complex arithmancy equation. “Also, isn’t your name French?”
She reached farther back and plucked loose a flower and offered it to him. “It’s nice to surprise our loved ones with little things. You should take this to him.”
There was something sharp in his voice, tight and hurt and maybe a little angry, and Harry panicked.
“Good morning,” he calls out, and Mr Tillman waves.
“Draco Malfoy?” asks the Auror. “You’re listed as Harry Potter’s emergency contact.”
And then Potter punches him in the face. Draco throws himself behind the stack of boxes as curses come shooting at them. Potter wrests Filmore’s wand away from him and shouts, “
“Are you sure? There’s plenty,” Potter says. “It’s beef and veg.”
“—and that’s all the more reason why you ought to stay home, Zelda’s not there to help you and—”
And given Potter’s penchant for rule-breaking when he’s made up his mind he’s right about something, Draco decides he’s better off not knowing the particulars.
You can leave a comment here or on
“I think you need rest,” Draco says decisively. He needs out of this conversation. He needs to leave. His lungs have gone tight and he can feel his panic beginning to get the better of him.
“You do?”
Harry slaps him. He doesn’t stir. “Wake up, Malfoy!” He still doesn’t stir.
“Oh, I’m fine,” Zelda says. “I’ve brought my lunch in today, I’ll eat in a little while. You, on the other hand, need to get going if you’re going to meet Harry in time to have all your things moved in today.”
“Keys,” says Potter and walks into the living room. A moment later he exclaims, “Ah-ha!” and snatches up a ring of keys from the coffee table.
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry agreed. He’d have agreed to anything at this point.
“Careful, she…” Draco begins, and pauses as Potter gently strokes her feathers with no repercussions. “...bites,” he finishes lamely.
“Yeah,” Harry said. Honestly, he was feeling a little torn about it. On the one hand, he wouldn’t get to spend nearly as much time with Draco and they certainly wouldn’t be sharing a bed anymore. On the other hand, he would no longer be spending so much time with Draco, nor would he be sharing a bed with him, and if those things stopped happening, it’d probably do good things for his emotional well-being. This awful yearning and unrequited-whatever couldn’t be healthy for him long-term. Mostly it just ached constantly and Harry wanted it to stop.
Draco slams his locker shut.
“Yeah,” Draco manages, clears his throat. “Yeah, I am.”
“Thought that’d get your attention. Twenty minutes. Bring your file.”
“Mm. She’s studying infectious diseases, and she’ll go on about it nearly as much as Goldstein and his Arithmancy. I find her course of study significantly less fascinating than I do his, but once one of them starts talking about work, all bets are off with the other.” He rolled his eyes ceilingward. “Merlin help me if I ever have to hear a single word more about—No. I refuse to even speak the name aloud.” He shuddered.
“Ron must have missed that lesson, then,” Hermione said dryly. “Just the other week he let George goad him into a contest about who could stand to eat the spiciest curry, and then he was up sick half the night.”
He drew back and then snapped his hips forward, so hard that Draco swayed with the motion. He’d been holding himself back, making sure Draco was open enough to take him easily, but now the last threads of his restraint unraveled, and he set up a fast, relentless rhythm. Draco was so hot and wet, and the friction of his body around Harry’s was nearly enough to make Harry lose his mind entirely.
“Of course you would have,” Harry said. “You know, just once I’d love for someone to pay for my drinks for a change.”
Draco marks his page with a finger and lets the book fall shut as he glances over at Potter. “They’re investigating the murders, aren’t they? You told me last month they’ve started attributing some of them to the same person.”
“Exactly.”
“Unspeakable Malfoy, authorisation code 76-25T. Requesting private Floo connection to the Department of Mysteries, please.”
It’s sandwiches again for dinner, salami this time, with more crisps, and chocolate biscuits for dessert. Malfoy follows his up with a cigarette.
Potter shrugs and doesn’t look at Draco. His cheeks have gone a bit pink, but Draco can’t tell if he’s blushing or if it’s from the cold. “He claims it’s because you do such good work. Personally, I think he was trying to smooth the way for this. He figured out I wanted you before I did, you know. I mean, I knew I wanted to fuck you, but he figured out that I could have more than that with you. And he knows it’s important to me that his family accept anyone I’m with, so…” He shrugs again. “And, well, knitting things is sort of a point of pride with Molly.” He glances over his shoulder, aims a fond look at the warm light spilling from the kitchen window. “Keep it up and you’ll probably get a jumper next year.”
“And on that note, I’ll show you what needs doing round here. There’s plenty to keep busy with, but we’ll start with the register, I think.”
Draco had worried over his own gifts, but they go over well. Granger and George and Teddy are appreciative of their gifts, but Weasley is thrilled when he unwraps his new chess set, stands up right where he is and brandishes it at Potter.
. He wants to sink through the floor. He can only hope that Potter was too sleep-muddled to really notice.
Harry watched him for a long moment, but Draco continued to stare stubbornly at the kettle. And as the seconds ticked past, it became apparent that if Harry wanted this conversation to go anywhere useful, he’d have to start it off himself.
“Thanks,” Draco says as Weasley turns to leave.
Belatedly, the half-guilty, half-embarrassed look on her face lines up with her peaky appearance and the fact she had plans out last night. He stops her with a hand to her elbow. “Wait. Are you hungover?”
“Has the sand been properly seen to?” he couldn’t help but ask, but assumed that it had been. They’d have called him in on an emergency Portkey, otherwise.
Ron turned the suspicious look he’d been aiming at the pint onto Malfoy instead. “I didn’t think you had,” he said slowly, as if Malfoy had suggested something utterly absurd. “Because I watched you carry them over here.”
“Come on, Harry,” Hermione said, taking him by the elbow. “Let’s get you home.”
Harry didn’t look at all pleased to hear that. “And what’s that got to do with anything? Even if I really was as young as I look, that doesn't mean I can't be trusted to make my own choices. You do realize that I was
“Really?” Draco asked, keeping his eyes steadfastly on Harry’s face. “I would’ve guessed Granger was her favorite.”
Draco withdrew his hand from beneath the flimsy cover of Harry’s napkin, lower lip jutting out in a pout, and Harry sighed and spooned another bite of custard into his mouth. He’d actually made it himself, because custard wasn’t too hard, it was just mixing eggs and milk and sugar and vanilla together and sticking it in the oven. He’d made up two little ramekins of it, and garnished each one with a dab of whipped cream and half a strawberry.
“But it wouldn’t surprise me,” Ron said. “Lucius regularly threw gold around to get his way. Wouldn’t surprise me at all to find Draco Malfoy following right along in dear old Dad’s footsteps.”
Lucy cocks her head to the side and makes no move to come in, then continues to stare at him as he swears at her, and of course that’s when Potter knocks on his door.
“Not quite,” Draco said, arching up and rubbing his hard cock against Harry’s thigh. “We seem to have missed one.”
Harper waved his wand and Draco felt the cool sweep of a cleaning charm rush over him like a fresh breeze.
Lucius nods to him, and sweeps from the room. Narcissa watches him go, then reclaims her teacup and saucer with a murmured
And when he popped the next chouquette into his mouth, he made a show of sucking the sugar off his fingers.
“Merlin, you’re like children,” Draco said, coming down into the kitchen, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat.
She nods, glancing around the empty shop. “I think so?”
But go
And a cold wave of alarm sweeps through Draco.
“Wait,” Harry says. “That’s not… I was just thirty.”
The sharp sound reverberates through the empty street, and Draco takes a step back and waits. Then the lock rattles and the door swings open. Draco steps inside, followed closely by Potter, and then shuts and locks the door after them, then turns back to see Potter looking curiously around. There’s not much to see down here. There are several empty shelves sitting in the middle of the room, and several large crates stacked against the far wall. Remnants of whatever shop was here before Katie took over. Everything is dim and dusty, and a blaring wireless echoes down from above
“No, thank you,” Draco says, faintly confused why the announcement of something important to discuss seems to have set his father at ease. “I’ve already eaten, but I wouldn’t mind some tea.”
He can tell that Molly overheard him by the way she smiles, and then George and Ginny are shoving the big stack of presents over to Potter.
“You’re bloody lucky it worked,” Potter tells him. “Christ, Apparating to fucking London from here is mad enough, even without the tree branch.” He shakes his head a little, disbelieving, but he’s still got that faint grin on his face.
When their case finally broke, it wasn’t due to any bit of clever detective work. It wasn’t a result of the long hours they’d all put in, nor did it have anything to do with those countless stacks of records they’d sorted through and analyzed in painful detail.
“If by worst you mean best,” Ron said, still sounding far too amused about Harry’s discomfort.
Potter comes with him agreeably enough as they sign him out and walk outside. But he stops short when Draco opens the door of the cab he’d called for them, utterly baffled that Draco would know what to do with it. He looks even more baffled when the cab delivers them to their Muggle house. He greets Mrs Field, who’s out for a walk and thankfully doesn’t press for details about Potter.
But Draco doesn’t think so. The pieces line up far too neatly. The whole case so far has been too careful, too deliberate. It’s not as simple as a black market brewer trying to make money. It’s about something bigger, more complicated than a common criminal. There has to be a bigger plot behind it. In fact, the particulars, the relative unavailability of the potion, the way a few cases would crop up and then the formula would change before another few people were dosed with it, it feels almost like…
He took his time making his tea, lingering over it until the fluttering in his stomach slowly faded.
It was a while before Harry thought to check over his shoulder again, and when he did, he didn’t see any sign of the man who’d been eyeing up Malfoy. Harry looked right, then left, but couldn’t pick him out of the crowded bar.
Her smile this time is a bit more genuine. “Fluently.”
The other reason he wants it is a bit of taking the coward’s way out. Le Mur Bleu is popular enough that he and Potter are sure to be spotted. A part of Draco is hoping that if they show up to a restaurant that’s a popular destination for couples, they’ll make the papers tomorrow, and then he won’t have to break the news to his parents. Lucius and Narcissa can have all of their unseemly reactions out of Draco’s sight—apoplexy, aneurysm, swooning and fainting dead away from the shock of it, ironing their ears and closing their fingers in a drawer, whatever-—and then when he sees them for dinner later that evening, everyone will be calm and composed about the whole mess.
There’s another stretch of silence, and Draco frowns to himself and wonders what Pansy had been about to say.
“—especially after you warned me not to! Why didn’t I listen, because you are ever so wise—”
“Nah,” Potter says, opening the door and holding it for Draco. “Oh, one more thing.”
Harry leaves off Malfoy’s neck with a delighted little laugh. “I was just thinking the same thing.”
Potter finds the newest body and goes to take a look at it on Saturday while Draco is at work, for which Draco is tremendously grateful. He knows they have to go see them, knows that there might be a clue. And if not, well, doesn’t he owe it to these victims? They’ve all been Muggle so far, and it can’t be coincidence that Draco’s the lone wizard. He can’t help but feel as though he’s dragged them into this. He can’t shake the sick sense that he’s somehow responsible. The least he can do is see them.
The Healers and Mediwitches exchange apprehensive looks, and the Healer gives the other two a nod. “Bring him in.”
“You know how much saturated fat is in that? Everything in moderation, you idiot.”
“Ow, stop,” Harry scolded, because that’d actually hurt. He swatted at Draco and Draco hit him with the book again.
“Blaise?” Draco echoes, not sure why he’s surprised that Potter’s apparently friends with him too.
It’s Potter, he thinks, that has him feeling like this. Potter’s always been able to get under his skin, throw his entire world off-balance. Even though he’s doing exactly what Draco hoped he would do—listening to his explanations and helping him blow this case wide open and not killing him, especially the not killing him—he’s so
When he catches up, stepping into the entryway just a few seconds later, Malfoy’s back at the front door, hurling a steady stream of spells at it, barely looking at his wand as he casts. His gaze is pinned to the modified pocket watch he holds balanced on his palm, and his brow has begun to pinch, either in concentration or consternation.
While Harry was getting him ready, Malfoy had reached down and taken his cock in hand, and was wanking it slowly, his fist moving in time with the slow movements of Harry's finger inside him. Harry pulled nearly all the way out, then pushed back in with two.
“That’s why you’ve been so quiet tonight,” Harry said, then asked, “You take something for it?”
It wasn’t until Harry took Draco to a Quidditch game that it occurred to him to wonder why he and Draco were bothering to go on what felt an awful lot like
“Thanks, but I’ll be fine,” she says.
She’s still talking, but Draco can’t seem to focus on her words. His mind feels frozen, and he’s fighting the urge to look at Potter, because perhaps if he looks at Potter again, it won’t be true anymore. If he looks at Potter, perhaps he won’t want Potter to kiss him, and everything can go back to the way it was. And as long as he
“Yeah,” Draco said, looking quickly away from him.
He knows that the person in front of him isn’t really Hermione. It’s just a projection of Hermione cobbled together from details lifted right out of Harry’s own mind. He still doesn’t know how exactly it works. He still had his mental shields up when he went to sleep, when the house put him to sleep and took over his mind. He doesn’t know how it’s lifting details of his life out of his brain, how it’s adjusting around details he’s noticed but hasn’t said out loud. He doesn’t know how, if it’s lifting details straight out of his mind to create the perfect world to lure Harry into staying here forever, it’s managing to get so much wrong. He didn’t think to ask, and Malfoy didn’t exactly have time to explain.
“He had to go home early. Apparently Granger’s colleague fell ill a couple of days ago. Clarke, I believe? The bloke that came out with us last week?” Draco waits for Potter’s nod before he continues. “Anyhow, he’s still out sick and she had to cover his shift tonight, so Weasley had to stay home with the children.”
“None whatsoever,” Potter sighs. He takes his glasses off and rubs at his eyes, then cleans off the lenses with the hem of his jumper. “You?”
But Hermione only grumbled to herself, “I’ll hex the lot of you,” and picked up her pen again.
Potter takes another step back and Disapparates. A few moments later, Draco hears his motorcycle roar to life. He goes inside, locks up after himself, and makes it to the window just in time to see the twinkle of Potter’s taillights disappear around the next building over. It’s not until he’s turning away from the window that he realises he’s still wearing Potter’s scarf.
“A bit of time, my arse,” Potter says. “I know how complicated the spellwork on the motorcycle is. This must have taken you days to get done.”
“Yes,” Zelda says, rolling her eyes at him. She hops down off the stool. “Because that’s the most pressing point, not that you nearly burnt down your shop with you asleep upstairs.”
“I didn’t mean to imply that it hadn’t,” Granger tells him coolly. “All I meant was, I noticed the difference. The stuff I usually take tastes like mouldy oranges. Yours didn’t.”
“That only happened twice,” Harry said, making a face like he’d sucked on a lemon slice.
“Well, I just thought you might want it the other way. You said you were thinking about my arse earlier,” Malfoy says.
“I’m so sorry,” she says, and he can hear that she means it. “This has got to be so hard for both of you.”
The witch behind the desk arched an eyebrow. “That’s the only one I’ve got that’s any sort of portable,” she said. “Though if you’d like this instead…” Reaching down into the cupboard beside her she hauled out a flat iron with a scuffed wooden handle and dropped it on the desk with a loud
The rattling reached a crescendo and the jars and vials on the shelves exploded into a sparkling shower of glass. Harry cast a strong
had taken place in various semi-public locales.
“Pick out a good one, then,” Potter tells him and looks at his menu, and Draco huffs. As if he’d been planning to pick out a
“You hated Muggles when I last saw you,” Potter finally says, apropos of nothing.
Besides the bed, he’s got a wardrobe, sofa and chair and coffee table for the living room, two narrow bookshelves, a small round dining table and four wooden chairs, and his most prized piece, a vintage wizard’s wireless he’d scrounged from the attic at the Manor. It’s a hulking art deco monstrosity, all rich cherry wood and gleaming brass knobs with an enormous stylised dial and, best of all, it’s got a lid that flips up to reveal a phonograph built right into the top. Draco loves it.
There was a long moment where Harry marvelled at the fact that he could have such strong feelings for someone who could casually use the word
“You should go on and tell her,” Potter says to Draco, and for a moment, Draco has no idea what he’s on about. Potter nudges Draco with an elbow. “C’mon. We agreed we’re not going to keep it a secret any longer.”
“Oh, ah,” Draco turns and looks over his shoulder, but none of the bottles behind the bar look at all familiar. “Whatever you’re having, I suppose.”
He hadn’t. It had taken him all of ten minutes to cut triangle eyes and a grinning mouth from a piece of black felt and use Sticking Charms to secure them to an orange jumper. Hermione had knitted the lumpy wool hat he wore, orange with a green stem and little curly vines trailing down.
“It is horrifying how cute the two of you are,” Ginny said.
“Slytherin ambition?” Draco suggests, stepping into his lab with Potter close behind.
Draco stands and thanks her, then follows the memo as it zips along and comes to a stop before a cubicle. Draco takes a moment to smooth down the front of his robes, then steps into the doorway.
Perhaps next time. There would
“Give up, Malfoy!” he shouted from his temporary bunker. “You’re just making this harder on yourself.”
“What the—” She stares at him in shock, wide-eyed.
that makes it so bad.”
Flushing, Harry turned away and didn’t watch as Malfoy disappeared upstairs. He wished he could blame it on the potency of Hermione’s punch, but the truth was that these sorts of thoughts had been popping into his head, unbidden and only-partly-unwanted, for the past few weeks. As always, he thought very firmly to himself,
. Waiting a couple of weeks, never mind an entire month, would have unthinkable.
“Italian,” Draco countered, buttoning up his black wool jumper and debated whether he’d need a Warming Charm or not. Harry
This isn’t helping Draco’s cock, which has taken a definite interest in being so close to Potter’s backside. He tries to scoot back again to put at least a little bit of distance between them, but then Potter revs the engine again and they take off, the motorbike jouncing sharply over the uneven pavement, and then the ride goes suddenly smooth as Potter steers them up into the air. Draco’s hands scrabble at Potter’s jacket and he squeezes tight, feels Potter laugh against him, and then they’re soaring up and up, the houses falling away beneath them and growing smaller by the second. Potter levels off, and Draco lets go of him just long enough to tug the orange scarf up over his nose. It smells like Potter.
MacCrae chuckled at that. “Thought that’d get your attention.”
“Oh,” Harry said, surprised and more than a little disappointed. He’d honestly assumed they’d pick up where they left off, and he hadn’t quite realized how much he’d been looking forward to it until Draco said he didn’t want to. “Okay. Well. If you change your mind about it, let me know. I’d, erm. I’d like that.”
“You wouldn’t be able to arrest me,” Weasley says reasonably. “I’d have murdered you for cake.” He takes another bite of his sandwich, mumbles through his mouthful, “It’d be worth it, too. Nobody’s too good for cake.”
“How did you…?” Draco begins before he realises he’s as good as admitting to that being the cause of his ‘glow.’ Pansy always was far too perceptive for her own good.
“Oh,” Potter says. “Shit.”
“Oh, there’s Charlie, up from his nap,” she says, setting aside her watering can. “It was lovely to see you, Draco.”
“They didn’t. They
“Next time I’ll plan better,” Draco said, opening his eyes again. He gave Harry a slow smile. “Sneak off to the loo while you’re faffing about with dessert.”
“What?” Harry asks, still rolling his hips against Draco’s. He’s not really getting anywhere with this—he usually isn’t able to come from frotting alone, it just ratchets him up to an enormously frustrating sort of plateau without being enough to push him over—but they’ve been at it a short enough time that it still feels pretty fantastic. Everything with Draco feels pretty fantastic. “Right now?”
Easy enough, right?
“No, of course it wasn’t a date. I just let him think it was,” Harry said. He was very diligently not thinking about the fact that he’d kissed Desmond last night. He still hadn’t fully processed the fact that he had. “Look, I’m meant to be getting close to him, aren’t I? I’m doing my job. And I reported where I was going to my superiors, just like I was supposed to.” He huffed a sigh and went rooting through the drawer again in the hopes that some Hangover Tonic might’ve magically appeared in the last thirty seconds.
Weasley’s crack about his father has irritated Draco, but he embraces that irritation. Lets it remind him of the person he used to be. He needs that person right now.
“Oh!” she exclaims. Draco recognises it as one of the songs Pansy had been blasting in her flat earlier, something about
When the kettle is hot, Potter gets out their mugs and pours their tea, and Draco watches him. He’s unsure how to ask for the green one. Which is a bit ridiculous, isn’t it. Both mugs are the same. The green one won’t disappear if Potter drinks from it, and the yellow one is just as good. But the green one is
Still grumbling, Ron got a second knife from the drawer and came up next to Harry to help. They quickly fell into a rhythm, with Ron trimming the leaves from each berry before passing it to Harry, who cut it into neat slices.
for this,” he snapped. “Perfect Potter. Tell me, have they made you Head Auror yet?”
“Fuck no!” Draco says. “
And then Potter removes the arrow and the puncture starts gushing blood.
without lifting his mouth from Harry’s cock. The door slammed shut the bare inch it’d opened with a startlingly loud
“Wonderful,” Draco says, and is surprised by how bright he sounds. “How about this evening? Because I’ve already invited him.”
“Well, antiques aren’t always in the best shape. Some need a bit of sprucing up, or minor repairs. And of course everything needs to be thoroughly examined, to make certain that we know exactly what we’ve got and that we list it for a fair price.”
Things are a little awkward between them for the next few days, and Draco has no idea how much of it is coming from Zelda, and how much of it is from Zelda picking up on his own awkwardness and not knowing how to respond to it. But they fall easily back into their routine, and then everything is back to normal. Days pass into weeks. Summer withers away as the weather turns cool. The leaves burst into riotous colour, and things continue on.
. He doesn’t have to guess that she’s still deeply involved in the same case he is.
...and Draco decides he’d much rather watch. He’s hoping Potter will make a grab for Granger. Not that she’d let him get anywhere with it, she’s far too capable a witch for that, and anyhow even Draco’s not cruel enough to stand idly aside as Potter mauls her. But Potter would probably get just far enough to make a complete and utter fool of himself. It’s not quite the spectacle sicking up would be, but Draco will take it. Maybe Granger will even be forced to hex him. Draco smiles at the thought.
This wasn’t a bad end to his evening, he thought to himself. Standing at the counter in his kitchen, eating his reheated supper and perusing the gossip pages. Celestina Warbeck had just remarried again, and the Keeper for the Ballycastle Bats had been photographed outside a club with his hand down another bloke’s trousers. That made Draco think of Harry’s stupid Barney the Fruitbat shirt, which made him think of Harry, and Draco folded up the paper with a huff. He was being foolishly maudlin and he needed to stop, take some time to sober up and then go to bed.
“Hear, hear,” Draco sighed as he settled his reading glasses on the bridge of his nose, because
“Yes,” Harry said. “He was a known smuggler, and had been deliberately handed valuable ingredients so that the Ministry could track down his contacts and shut down the whole operation. He went to Malfoy’s shop, and then not only did he vanish, but suddenly no one involved with the case had any memory of it. We assumed that Malfoy had a hand in that, and I was assigned to go undercover in his shop.”
They tapped their glasses together, a clear and musical note ringing out between them. They drank. It tasted like red wine, but Harry supposed that it must be a nice one because Draco’s face did an approving sort of thing as he swallowed. Then Harry thought of Draco swallowing in other contexts and had to look away for a moment.
Then he turns on his heel, jerks the door open, and strides down the hall to the lifts.
“Peter Harper?” the man asked over his shoulder as he headed back to the counter, where he had the register’s contents half-organised into neat stacks. “Sorry, I’m running a bit behind this morning. I’m Desmond, I’ll be getting you acquainted with the shop today, just as soon as I finish up here. Do you prefer Peter?”
A giddy laugh escapes him. “I can’t believe how fucking lucky I am. A lost branch of my own family’s house. My god. The odds of it have got to be astronomical.”
“I will,” he says.
“I give a fuck about not getting caught with my tongue up your arse in a coat closet, which we certainly will be when you scream the house down,” Harry says, unscrewing the lid from the tin and clambering up to his feet.
Potter gives him a wry smile. “Don’t thank me yet, I haven’t done anything.”
But by the time they finish, it’s become too insistent to ignore any longer, unless he plans to transform right here at the dining table.
He still bites his nails, Draco notices.
“What’re you doing?” he asked as Harry shifted back down the mattress to his feet.
“I’m not that bad!” Potter protests.
“Am I going to Azkaban?” Leo asked, voice thick and wavering.
“Well, yeah,” Harry said. He undid the top few buttons of his heavy Auror robes. It didn’t help, so Harry undid a few more. “Of course I did. I was looking for you.”
When the five minutes are up, Draco spells the excess paste away, carefully pinches the gaping edges of the deepest wound together, and has Zelda seal it with a strong Sticking Charm, then repeats the process with the others. Zelda bandages his arm for him, inspects the cut on his head again, then steps back with her arms folded over her chest.
“What?”
* * * * *
—underage magic—
Draco had spoken to Dorothea early on in his research and arranged to rent an unused corner of her basement as a secondary potions lab with its own separate set of equipment, to eliminate any fear of cross-contamination. He’d walled it off into its own little room and connected it to his own lab with a set of magical doors so that he didn’t have to go out onto the street to move between them. He sells some of the kosher potions through his own shop, about as many as David sells through his own shop, and it’s quite convenient to always have each other’s apothecary to which they can direct customers if one of them is out of something. His working relationship with David continues to flourish, and as much as Draco has always loved experimenting with formulas, it’s even more enjoyable to have a partner to work with on it right alongside him, trade ideas and theories back and forth.
Harry slammed the dough against the counter again. “Well his best’s not good enough then, is it?”
,” Ron said decisively. He stood up and led the way out of the pub, and Hermione pushed Harry along behind him.
Harry faltered. “Wait. Did you really?”
“I know,” Harry sighed. “We should be so lucky.” He flipped open the wine list again, then looked around the room. Shouldn’t their waiter have come over by now?
* * * * *
The Goblin takes it back from him almost before Draco’s lifted his quill from the tail of his Y and rolls it up. “Is there anything else you needed today?” he asks, sounding very much like he hopes the answer is
,” Draco repeats, and Zelda looks reluctant, but she nods and goes back out into the shop
Draco awoke the next morning warm and snug beneath the sheet, half-tangled up with Harry, and happier than he could ever remember feeling in his life. In his weaker moments he’d fantasized about what this would feel like, to wake up next to Harry like this, but every fantasy he’d ever had paled in comparison to the real thing. It was early enough that the sun hadn’t begun to warm to gold yet, and everything was dim and quiet and peaceful, and Draco’s heart echoed that with every beat, quiet and calm and sharply grateful for every moment of his life that’d led to him reaching this very moment.
Draco jots down his observations, notes the time, and closes his notebook. Somehow he has the feeling that this was the most exciting thing he’ll see tonight. A wizard with bad fashion sense buying an illegal potion. Not the most helpful clue in this case.
“I don’t suppose you’re willing to go to St Mungo’s for this, are you?” Potter asks him, sounding as if he already knows the answer.
But Harper seemed as thrown off-balance as Draco felt. The conversation flowed awkwardly from there, in fits and starts about inconsequential things. It felt strange to be with Harper outside of the shop, in the same way that it’d felt strange to see Professor Snape turn up at the Manor back when Draco was in school. Draco drank his pint a little quicker than was probably advisable given the circumstances, but every time there was a lull in the conversation, he found himself picking up his glass for a drink. It was no small consolation that Harper was easily keeping up with him.
That would be useful to know, except Draco has no idea where the kitchen is, and everything is loud and he has no idea how he’s supposed to fit into this. He entertains the comforting fantasy of going back through the Floo and retreating to the quiet sanctity of his flat. The only thing that stops him is that sometimes it takes two or three tries to pronounce his vowel-less Floo address.
“No, I’m fine. Sorry, I’m fine.”
All this Muggle blood in his system is going to seriously dampen Malfoy’s magic for a while, Harry thinks. Malfoy will hate that. But at least he won’t—
Even though he’s been to Alyosha’s shop many times before, he nearly walks right past it. The heavy wood door is tucked in a little alcove half-hidden in the dark swell of shadow between two streetlamps. Draco glances up and down the street, ensuring that he’s alone out here.
“So that’s four, then,” Harry said, nodding a little to himself. “All right, back in a sec.”
, and—”
“What the fuck,” Draco says. “Are you twelve? Have you really not matured past your second year?”
Draco shrugged. “Smells like you,” he said.
Harry hadn’t really expected that Malfoy would be there on his first day, because training a new employee seemed like something that Malfoy would think was beneath him. Harry’d sort of thought it’d be Celene; from the way she’d bustled around the shop during Harry’s interview, he guessed that she’d been working there for a while. And besides, Malfoy had been almost polite to her, which likely meant he respected her to some degree, which meant that she was more than up to the task of seeing to a new employee.
* * * * *
She stiffens, then frowns and blinks at him. “You’re not serious.”
“We’ve got eleven people here, who’s going to sit out?” she asks.
“Fine,” he says. “But we’re not taking the motorcycle. I’m calling for a cab to drop us off at Diagon. I’ve got some things I need to take care of, so I’ll walk down with you before I go on.”
“Entirely worth the price of admission,” Pansy assures him. “Draco was spoiled rotten, don’t get me wrong. But he was sweet about it when he was a child.”
serious problem,” Harry told him.
He’s not stupid enough to try Apparating; a bad Splinching is probably the one thing that could make this hellish situation even worse. He’ll start with something easier. He tries out a few direction spells, trying to work out which way is London, then which way is Wiltshire, then, desperate, which way is Hogwarts. They all fizzle out in useless little puffs. Then he spends a while trying to Conjure a warm set of robes with increasing desperation, then a Warming Charm. He’s so cold that he has to clench his jaw to keep his teeth from chattering. He’s shivering so badly that he’s worried he’s not getting the motions right.
Torn between pressing up into Harper’s mouth and rolling his hips down against Harper’s fingers, he found himself trapped in place, nearly vibrating with tension as two opposites pulled at him. One finger became two, and fuck, that was brilliant. Draco rocked his hips down, pushing himself harder against Harper’s fingers, and Harper’s other hand came up to pin his hips to the bed.
Draco’s raising his wand to the door, and Harry snatches it right out of his hand and aims it at the wall adjacent. “
A moment ago Draco would have sworn she couldn’t possibly display any more cleavage, but somehow she manages, and the way she smirks at him afterward tells him she’s only doing it to make him uncomfortable. Apparently she hasn’t changed
- - - - -
“I’ll tell you you’re the Queen of France if that’s what you want to hear, so long as you keep doing that,” Draco says. Potter’s added a little twist to the end of each stroke and it’s driving Draco wild.
He can only see the top of Potter’s head over the arm of the sofa as he passes by on his way to the stairs, but when he starts to climb up, a glance over his shoulder shows Potter stretched out on his back, one hand holding the book propped open on his stomach, the other hand tucked behind his head. In another two steps, Draco is too high up and the ceiling blocks his view of the living room.
“Exactly,” Draco agreed, then closed his mouth and slanted a look at Harry. “It’s your birthday, so I won’t say what else I was about to say.”
Sometimes Harry loved living with his friends; sometimes Harry couldn’t wait for them to all move the fuck out of his house. Ron gave him a sympathetic grimace, and Harry sighed and crammed a slice of bacon into his mouth. Hermione opened her mouth to keep going, and Ron shook his head, and then the two of them proceeded to have a complicated conversation that consisted entirely of raised eyebrows and significant staring. Harry ignored them and turned back to his pan.
“Need to talk it through?” Ron offers easily, because he’s an Auror too and he understands how that happens sometimes, and how sometimes it helps to get it out. He sets one of the two pint glasses he’s holding on the scarred wooden tabletop before Harry, then takes a seat across from him.
Then Draco shifts against him, wordlessly asking Harry to get on with it. He spreads his legs wider, bracing his feet against the ground and settling Draco in the cradle between thighs and hips. Draco leans forward, redistributing his weight between Harry and the ground, and bracing his hands on Harry’s knees, fingers giving him a little squeeze to let him know he’s ready.
Celene shrugged again. “I wouldn’t know,” she said. “I only work here.”
In the end, the way Harry got Malfoy to go along with it was by Side-Alonging him to the alleyway and ushering him quickly in through the back door of the pub. Then, by the time Malfoy realized that Harry had brought him to a
Potter thinks for a long moment, then says, “No. But I think we’re getting there.”
,” Draco offers.
“That awful?” Harry asked, sliding the springform pan into the oven and closing the door. He grabbed his wand and set an alarm for ten minutes. “I thought you said the final exams went well.”
His arm is still around Draco, Potter’s elbow propped up atop the side of the bathtub, his hand loosely curled around Draco’s bicep in a way that feels both exhausted and strangely possessive.
Malfoy laughed, dry and helpless. “It would have made today easier, yes.”
It makes sense in his head, but it does sound rather silly when he says it aloud. Still, he can tell from the way that Potter’s eyes are shining that Draco’s chosen exactly right.
He trailed off, and Draco frowned. “Do you not want to do this while Polyjuiced?”
Draco sweeps by Potter and into the hall, and indulges in a quick rub of fingertips against where the cold metal of the gun’s silencer kissed his temple. He feels jittery and nauseated, sick with nerves, twitchy with the strain of keeping it all from showing. Potter had pressed the gun sharply to Draco’s skin; Draco wonders if it left a mark. He’s always bruised easily.
And there he is.
Draco slid away from him, breathing hard, and Harry flopped over onto his back next to him and stared up at the ceiling, trying to slow his pounding heart and heaving lungs as he thought dizzily to himself,
Thankfully, the others came back to the table then, arriving within seconds of each other. Harry distributed pint glasses all round and took his seat just as Park and Granger returned.
to lift it up to just over his head and a series of Sticking Charms to keep it in place. From the outside, it doesn’t look like anything more than a particularly uninteresting advertisement plastered over the brickwork. Weasley gives him a boost so he can reach into the flap and snag the end of the rope ladder, and then he climbs up.
repeats endlessly, getting smaller and smaller until it’s altogether illegible. Harry can’t look away, can’t see anything but the text on the back of Malfoy’s t-shirt, the screenprinted letters peeling at the edges, curling over Malfoy’s sharp shoulder blades and falling against his spine.
“Just one day to study?” Harry went on. “That’s rather ambitious.” He sipped more of Draco’s tea.
Draco hesitates, lingering at the edge of the clearing, bites his lip and rubs his hands together. This is mad, absolutely mad. He’ll be lucky if he doesn’t kill himself, because a wand has two parts for a bloody good reason. The wood channels the magic, but the core focuses it, and a proper wand needs both parts to function the way it’s meant to.
When the clock struck six and Ron still hadn’t come home yet, Harry gave up trying to wait patiently. He’d already made a huge pile of blueberry muffins to take off the worst edge of his anxiety, but he’d wasted the last half-hour pacing uselessly. He might as well do something productive with himself while he waited.
No, the trouble had begun when Malfoy had returned to England and taken up a position with the Ministry as Expert Consultant. Harry had worked several cases with him, and found himself increasingly helpless to resist Malfoy. Like a moth to a flame, and Harry too bloody stupid to resist being drawn in. They still bickered, and engaged in stupid childish staring contests, but there was a decided lack of animosoity behind it. And sometimes, well. Sometimes it felt almost teasing. And some of the looks he sometimes caught Malfoy sneaking at him were speculative. And almost fond?
He took a slow, deep breath, and let it out. Thought very seriously about pretending to need to toilet as an excuse to escape the room for a few minutes, but decided against it. No need to give Weasley anything else to use against him, and fleeing the room would only lead to more teasing.
, imagine! This arsehole actually believed they were
wire cutters,” Draco says, trying consciously to slow it down for Potter’s benefit.
Sighing a little, Harry carefully brushed a lock of Draco’s hair aside and then ghosted the lightest kiss against the top of his head. Two weeks was both too much and too little time left.
The lift arrives with a cheerful
Frowning, he presses his hand flat against it, the metal cold beneath his palm and splayed fingers, and there it is again, a crackle of magic that feels both intimidating and exhilarating all at once. He snatches his hand away.
Draco had no idea how badly he’d wanted a way out until Potter sat one right in front of him. But he can’t, he can’t just leave. His parents, his whole life. Everything.
.” He grabs Draco’s hands and presses them over the towel. Red is beginning to blossom through the soft white cloth. “Hold that there.”
“Of course it can,” Malfoy said, and he still had that infuriatingly superior tone to his voice. “If we went to St Mungo’s, they could have it undone in about five seconds.”
And it will get out. Harry has no delusions on the shelf-life of his soul. Not anymore, anyway. Not after seeing all of Malfoy’s collected evidence and hearing all of his conclusions. Harry’s done the calculations in his head and the chances of Malfoy being wrong are so low as to be negligible. There is an underground terrorist organisation; Harry’s known this for years. Most of his kills are people in it. What he hadn’t known was that at its head is someone in the Ministry, and that same person is playing both sides.
“Potter,” Draco cuts in. Otherwise they’ll be here all day, at the rate he’s going. “What I saw yesterday was none of my business. I didn’t mean to see it, you didn’t mean to show me, and as far as I’m concerned, that’s that.” He picks up his teacup just for something to do with his hands. “What time is everyone meeting up tonight?”
“In that case, I suppose I’ve really got no choice but to make it up to you…” Draco said, starting to slide down Harper’s body.
“Nah, I’m going to go over my notes again, see if something shakes loose this time.” He picks up his journal and gestures vaguely with it.
"More than," Malfoy said, rolling his hips so that the head of Harry's cock rubbed over his hole.
He risked a glance up at Harry, who was frowning a little in concentration as he scribbled down notes with one of those Muggle pens he seemed to prefer, and there was that longing again, the sharp yearning that even being this close to Harry wasn’t close enough. Draco looked back down to his own work, and set his mind to again losing himself in it.
“Oh, well
"If you don't mind," Ron said, glancing sidelong at Harry.

Victoire clearly knows that word, and lets out an enthusiastic shriek.
bad idea this would be if he went through with it. That he’d turn around and walk away. His mission was finished; Celene was dead, Pura knew that Ashby’s Antiques & Imports was a baited trap, and as of tomorrow, there was no longer any reason for Desmond Dwyer to exist.
“Oh Merlin, that’s unpleasant,” he groans, pressing a hand to his forehead.
“Yeah,” Harry said, unable to look away from Draco’s mouth. “Sounds good.”

“You don’t mind?” Malfoy asks after their mutual ceasefire.
got autographed copies, Gin,” Dean said, rolling his eyes.
“We can all be ‘in this together’ with separate showers,” Draco had muttered.
. When he’s finished, he marks his page, does the washing up, and puts everything back in their cupboards. He puts on his shoes and laces them tightly, and steps out onto the narrow landing just as his clock strikes 8:30.
On the one hand, Draco is glad that his parents still love each other after twenty-five years of marriage. But on the other, that doesn’t mean he wants to know about it in any sort of detail. Pansy’s parents hate each other, but they refuse to divorce because, according to Pansy, that’d be like admitting defeat. Blaise’s mother has a new husband every other year, it seems. Might have a new one now, in fact, though Draco hasn’t spoken to him in a while and can’t be certain. Tomorrow. He should do that tomorrow.
Sometimes it was annoying how well Malfoy knew Ron.
Satisfied that he’d not left anything incriminating in plain sight, he cast a spell to seal the drawer in which he’d stashed the probably-stolen locket, and went out into the shop to see who presumed upon his time.
It will all look better in the morning, he tells himself. He just needs a good night’s sleep and everything will look better when he wakes up. He’ll fall asleep and then everything will be better.
“Just going to the toilet,” Potter says. “Back in a minute.”
He works for the Muggles, too. He uses a wand for that. He’s untrackable. There are urban legends about him.
He let his head fall back against the door with a soft
“Been gone for about twenty minutes,” Hermione confirmed, taking a sip of her drink.
Potter seems entirely comfortable holding her, and Draco is impressed. He’s never been this close to a baby before, and it’s more terrifying than he thought it’d be. She’s clutching at the sleeve of Potter’s shirt with impossibly tiny fingers and staring at Draco over Potter’s shoulder with enormous blue eyes. And there’s Potter, laughing at something Weasley just said as if he’s not holding a tiny fragile helpless little person, and Draco looks at her hand again, with its wee little fingernails and tiny dimples where her knuckles ought to be, and how on earth can Potter be holding her so comfortably?
He still feels somewhat apprehensive about having an unknown person spending lots of time in his shop, but he doesn’t have the time or the energy to be involved in the process of interviewing applicants. Besides, he trusts Zelda. She wouldn’t hire someone with whom Draco won’t get along.
Draco shoved him and Harry laughed.
“That depends,” Draco says, and is pleased by how light and casual he sounds. “Did you check for fireworks tonight?”
- - -x- - -
Ron helped out by making the toast, and Hermione made them all tea, and by the time Harry finished up with the scrambled eggs, Seamus and Dean had joined them in the kitchen as well. Harry glanced at the doorway, wondering what was keeping Luna and Ginny, and right on cue, Luna swept into the room, barefoot even though the tile floor of the kitchen was always chilly this time of year. She had her long hair pulled back into a neat plait, and cheerful red flowers woven through it.
He made his slow and careful way across the crowded pub, and then down the narrow little hallway at the back. He pushed into the men’s room, the bright light briefly disorienting after the pleasant dimness of the pub’s main room. He did his business and washed his hands and was about to leave when the door opened and Draco walked in.
Potter rolls over and stretches out on his stomach, and Draco scoots down the bed and pushes his legs apart so he can lie between them. He runs his hands up the insides of Potter’s thighs, urging him to spread wider, watches him shiver. He does it again, and again, intending to draw this out as much as they can both stand. Potter’s got a gorgeous arse, and Draco is nearly faint with glee that he’s going to be the first person Potter allows to have him like this.
Draco’s eyebrows rose. “Really. I didn’t know they’d pulled anyone from Prophecy in on this.”
“That’s what Warming Charms are for, aren’t they?” Harry asks. He twirls Draco’s wand around his fingers.
There’s something about flying with Potter that’s always been better than flying by himself, be it on a broomstick or a motorcycle.
Draco, who sees absolutely nothing wrong with jam sandwiches, gives Potter a frown. “And why’s that?”
that it he had all sorts of good things to look forward to still felt like a bit of a novelty.
“Megan Jones,” Malfoy says, and Harry flinches because that name is familiar. He’s got a vague flash of dark brown hair and gappy teeth laughing at him panicking in third year Herbology when his Mandrake started wailing. “My partner,” Malfoy adds.
She does so well that two months after Zelda begins work, Draco goes with Lucius to the Quidditch International Finals. It’s held on a Monday so he doesn’t have to worry about the shop for most of the time he’ll be away, even though Zelda will be opening the apothecary on her own tomorrow morning.
With a small sigh, he turns back to stare out the window. It’s pointless to think about these things. This is the path his life has taken. It won’t do him any good to ponder what other paths he might have gone down.
. Like bait in a trap.”
Except… maybe not quite so ridiculous when he stopped and thought about it. After all, most of his previous interactions with Draco had involved quite a lot of touching. It would make sense that he’d have a bit of trouble transitioning from that to… well. To whatever this was. Friends, maybe? They’d be spending a lot of time together over the next couple of months, and even if they weren’t quite friends yet, there was a good chance they could get there by the time they faked their break up. Harry thought he’d rather like to end up with a friendship at the end of it.
“Fine, it’s fine,” Harry said. “I don’t care. I’ve had your come in worse places.”
, or whatever other reason you’ve come up with in that ridiculous brain of yours. This way we can fly to work if we feel like it. That’s all.”
Draco tucked his hands into the oven mitts and opened the oven. The butter knife went into the center of the cake and came out clean. Draco half-turned to give Harry a smirk as he took the cake out, and knocked the lip of the cake pan against the top of the oven. With his hands swaddled in the thick oven mitts, the pan slipped right out of his grasp, flipped neatly end over end, and clattered down onto the opened oven door.
Harry didn’t understand their friendship at all.
Harry laughed a little, and it came out high and a little bit nervous, and Draco laughed with him, sounding relieved, like he felt better to know Harry was nervous too. And just like that, the tension broke and Harry’s nerves settled. “C’mon,” he said, tugging Draco’s hand back to his hip. “I’m ready this time.”
Everything is clean, the tile floor sparkling and the bathmat clean and fluffy. Potter left Draco’s wand for him by the sink, along with set of pyjamas folded neatly on the vanity, and a jar of ointment for the blisters on Draco’s wrist. The handful of feathers Potter had peeled off Draco’s back are soaking in the sink, the water turned faintly pink as the dried blood begins to dissolve. The arrow’s in there, too, head down and hidden by the feathers. Draco touches the black feather fletching on it, then picks up the ointment and applies it to the irritated skin around his wrist. He casts several drying spells over himself, checks his bandages, then hangs his towel on its hook and dresses quickly.
“—for the murder of Celene Tipton—” Harper continued.
Harry was giving him a funny look, and Draco cleared his throat.
“FILTH! UNWORTHY PEASANTS! VILE INTERLOPERS AND PERVADERS OF THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT—” Her voice cuts off abruptly as Potter yanks the curtain back into place.
They stayed like that for a minute until Harry, still slumped against Draco, began to tremble. Draco’s heart skipped a beat, thinking something was wrong, before he worked out that Harry was laughing silently. He prodded two fingers into Harry’s side, and Harry laughed aloud.
—Draco shoved him out into the hall and slammed the door right in Harry’s face.
as pretence. “They’ll discharge you tomorrow morning, so only fifteen hours and twelve minutes more,” he said.
, and a gay man is a
“I guess that makes sense,” Harry said slowly, trying to imagine pretending to date Draco for that long. “And anyhow, the holidays are a stressful time, maybe the pressure of our first Christmas as a couple would push us to the breaking point.”
Then came Penelope, whom he’d briefly met a time or two through Theo Nott. Nothing was wrong with Penelope, but nothing about her felt especially right, either. And in any case, she didn’t seem especially interested in seeing him again. They parted ways on friendly terms.
“He sewed it himself!” Pansy crowed.
“I was just thinking,” he repeated, eyes dancing with amusement. "I just came in my trousers.” He laughed again, a ridiculous snorting sound, like he’d tried to muffle it and failed miserably. “Like a
Pansy flaps a dismissive hand, though he can tell she’s pleased with herself. “It was nothing. Percy’s wife, Audrey, is an estate agent and she was glad to help. It was rather fun, actually, looking at flats with her. We turned it into a bit of a girls’ afternoon.”
Potter sighs and stretches his arms over his head, and something in his back gives a loud crack. He sighs again and looks over his shoulder to Draco.
“Fine.”
, Harry thought,
Malfoy gets the bag and hands it to Harry, and Harry takes out the potions he’ll need. Malfoy watches critically as he lines them up on the bedside table.
“Welcome to London,” a young witch greets him from the doorway of the small room to which his International Portkey had brought him.
Draco huffs a small laugh. He understands all about humouring one’s mother. “Well, a little luck never hurt anyone,” he says, handing over the paper bag with the potions inside. “Thank you very much.”
“All right there, Potter?” he asked.
“For Merlin’s sake, George!” she huffs, turning. “I’M RIGHT HERE.”
“Well,” says Draco as a curious warmth spreads through him at Potter’s words. “I suppose that’s true.”
Harper opened it up and stared for a moment. “You remembered,” he said.
Draco shrugged. “Pans, for sure. Blaise and Theo. Millie’s bringing Anthony Goldstein, did you know they were dating now?”
Malfoy nodded once, jerky. “Yes. I thought… I was worried how you’d react when you found out, and I thought it best to get it over with as soon as I could.”
“Tired,” Draco said, then nodded to them as he pulled his jumper back over his head. “And we’ve got to work tomorrow.”
At the beginning of every semester, Harry and Draco sat down with their course schedules and their assigned work hours, and figured out where the little free time that each of them had would line up. Those times got marked on the calendar tacked to the wall of the kitchen that barely got used for anything more complicated than coffee and tea and toast. Mostly they managed breakfast or dinner together, and they had a lot of what Draco had termed “study dates” which were basically them sitting at their dining room table, ignoring each other in favor of their textbooks and practice tests and lecture notes. But they were together, and they took turns making each other tea, and every so often they’d take a little break for some snogging, and it was mostly pretty nice.

He can tell by her expression that she’s tempted—he knows for a fact that she’s been hooked on dark coffee sweetened with almond syrup ever since she accidentally took a sip from his cup instead of hers one day—but Zelda shakes her head. “No, thank you.”
“Erm,” said Harry, blinking.
- - - - -
“Do you remember when I said that birds behave oddly around me?” Draco says, then turns to walk backwards for a few steps. He gestures broadly at the peacocks, and two of them spread their wings in return. Well. That’s new.
He settles back into the rhythm of stirring.
They all
Draco thinks briefly of going to see his parents. He usually stops off at the Manor after work on Friday evenings. But Lucius made the front page of the paper again this morning when he slipped off to Diagon Alley and shouted at a Muggleborn witch with a small child.
Nothing. Potter doesn’t even stir.
He’s just taken a big bite of his cheese toastie when the door opens and Potter pokes his head in. “Hey.”
Harry nodded, swallowing hard. “I know. But I’m sure.”
“Very much so,” Harry said, and tried a smile. “I’m not in the habit of Apparating men into my bedroom for no reason.”
. Sometimes it still struck him as impossible that Draco loved him as much as he did. That Harry should be so lucky to have someone who loved him like this. Harry felt his control over his persona slip, the stern expression crowded out by a smile, Auror Potter fading away until he was just
that exhale.
“Ready?” Draco asks as he stands, carefully not looking at Potter and that fucking jacket of his.
with a colleague is far worse than anything in there.” He stretched out a foot and bumped the Handbook with his toes. “There probably wouldn’t be enough left of me for the Ministry to even bother disciplining afterward.”
“Because the lot of you are a bunch of incompetents?” Draco asked, mocking Harry’s professional tone. He lifted an eyebrow.
He honestly has no idea what he should do, whether he should take the escape Potter’s offered him. The teacup represents an unknown, and Draco’s never felt comfortable dealing with uncertainties. He needs facts and plans and the comforting rigidity of details. What Potter’s offered him is the equivalent of stepping blindfolded over a ledge and trusting that the ground will be there beneath his feet, that the drop won’t be enough to kill him. What’s here is familiar; what’s out there could be anything.
and that’s all Harry’d needed to spring into action. He’s never met this mysterious person who’s saved his arse three times in the last decade, doesn’t even know if they’re a man or a woman, magic or Muggle, though he suspects they must be at least a squib. He just knows that when Mouse texts him to go, he goes.  Mouse has been texting him a lot more frequently since this Malfoy shit started. He’d woken up from two after breaking his ankle in that gorge.
Harry scowled and threw a stack of bright yellow Posted Notes at him. Draco caught it and threw it back.
It’s enough of a distraction to keep Draco from being
?” He’s still trying to wrap his head around the fact that Pansy appears to have invited Potter here deliberately and Potter has agreed to it and shown up willingly and has everyone gone
In another life they’re in a happily-committed relationship, together forever, and Harry would get off on hearing tales from Malfoy’s self-proclaimed
Harry pauses beneath the boughs of an ancient yew tree, letting the shadows fall all over him like demiguises, wrapping him up tight and warm and invisible. He stands within it, a lethifold waiting.
“But I’m not trying to join them.”
“Oh,” Potter says. He leans against the Floo, cocks his hip to take the weight off his bad leg. “If you don’t mind a bit of waiting, you can come to my place with me and then we can Apparate together from there.”
“What?”
“Ugh,” said Draco, slamming the book closed and tossing it aside. It landed on the rug with a heavy
“What was that about?” Harper asked, looking after Celene’s rapidly retreating back.
But when he flipped it over, he saw that it wasn’t a picture frame; it was a shadow box. And carefully pinned to the plush blue velvet interior was a very familiar handfasting cord.
, Ronald. One thousand
Draco slapped his hand away, and for a split second he thought Harry was actually going to punch him. The way he stopped, startled, and flinched backward a moment later told Draco that yeah, he’d very nearly just got punched. For a long moment they just stared at each other, then Harry visibly deflated. Draco forced himself relax, taking a deep breath and willfully letting go of his anger.
“It’s brilliant,” he says, one hand wandering down to Draco’s trousers. “I now own the most brilliant scarf in the world.”
“Let me take you to dinner tonight,” Draco says. “As a thank you.”
“Not that much,” Draco grumbles. He’s only mentioned Potter a few times in their letters, and only because they’re living together. It’s been hard enough to avoid talking about his curse while owling back and forth with Katie, without also trying to avoid talking about the bloke he’s living with. And it would’ve seemed suspicious, besides; he and Potter have been in all the papers so Katie already knew they were together.
“All right, then,” Harry echoed, sitting back in his seat.
Malfoy frowns, thinking it through. “I don’t know. It’s not done anything to us since it trapped us in. I still can’t tell much about the magic in here, but it almost feels like it’s… waiting.”
“Well, isn’t she precious,” she says, glancing significantly back at the door to the shop. “She’s, what, Ravenclaw? They never could tell a lie to save their lives.”
A moment later Malfoy’s hand comes to rest between his shoulder blades, pressing firmly and rubbing in slow circles.
“So… what’s it mean?” Harry asked. “If you asked me if I knew, I’m assuming you know.”
“Was an ice princess in her time. I’ve seen her crystallised hair let down and fairies crawling up. When I—”
Hermione looked doubtful. “Did you give him a fair chance? You were only gone for twenty minutes.”
“Who exactly have you got in mind?” Hermione asked, not anywhere near as casual as she probably meant it.
“Potter,” Malfoy said when Harry and Hermione returned to their table. “Thank goodness you’re back. That Muggle over there keeps making eyes at me.”
Potter lapses mostly into silence for the rest of the meal, and Draco finishes off most of the wine by himself. He’s a little tipsy by the time they finish eating. Normally when they have wine with dinner, they pace themselves, and end up taking the remainder of the bottle out into the living room with them. So Draco’s feeling it a little more than he usually does when he stands up and picks up his plate, and reaches out to take Potter’s, too.
(Potter’s words, not Draco’s) and they continued to meet up in private to get to know each other better. Which brings them to where they are now.
“I’m hungry,” Malfoy says.
s he can feel but can’t hear.
And then the platform descends into cheerful chaos as the students begin to disembark, the shouts and laughter and greetings, all around them families reuniting for the holidays and friends calling out goodbyes and promises to owl. Potter’s up on his tip-toes, craning his neck and trying to look everywhere at once.
Potter nods without looking back. He opens the door and steps outside, and shuts it again behind him. He doesn’t bother to lock it—and why would he, he’s only going to be gone a few minutes—but the sound of it latching sounds tremendously final.
“What’s that?” Potter asks in lieu of a greeting because he’s a mannerless git. He gestures to the disassembled device as he steps fully into the room and lets the door fall shut behind him.
.” Harry tucked his book under his arm, took Draco by the hand, and began to lead him upstairs. “There’s a whole chapter on personal relationships between coworkers and inappropriate workplace behavior that I’m having trouble with in particular. I think some role play might help me remember it better.”
“Well, what does all your circumstantial evidence point to?”
But all he felt was a strange sort of lightness, a funny little thrill that shivered up from the very bottom of his lungs and reverberated through his chest.
Potter has him so rattled, so completely turned around, that he can’t even do the most basic of tasks properly. For a moment he’s tempted to throw things. His tendency to throw things when he’s in a pique made him something of a legend at his last job, but he hasn’t yet hired any minions for his subdepartment to clean up after him, and anyhow there’s no one to witness it.
…right up until Desmond had turned the tables on him and sucked sugar off his fingers while peering at Harry from beneath his lashes as he did so.
Potter takes it, Draco
With all the trips abroad, Harry would bet on smuggling. All he needed to do was
“Nice try, Potter, that’s still curry.”
Draco only shook his head. “I’m saving you from yourself,” he said without looking up. “That’s what I’m doing, I’m saving you from yourself.” He sighed and couldn’t quite suppress a fissure of genuine fear. “Miriam is actually going to murder me over this. Even if I change it back, she’ll know.”
“There’d be an interrogation, and they’d only try harder to set us up. They’d be convinced they’re right, that we’ve got
Draco hurries after her, and it takes less than a minute for them to reach their destination.
“Oh,” Potter says softly, tilts his head up a bit to brush his lips across Draco’s. It’s a distracted sort of kiss that feels a bit unintentional, and Draco loves that he can make Potter kiss him without meaning to. “I’m unconvinced. Perhaps you should show me in more detail.”
“Ready to go?” Draco asks.
Draco swished his wand and sent the torn-up bits of Posted Note fluttering over to Harry. One of them, one that’d come from the sticky strip, pasted itself to his glasses. “Couldn’t think of anything that began with K. We could go with Cruelty, if you’re willing to get a bit creative with the spelling.”
“No,” Harry said, his voice coming out croaky. He cleared his throat. “I’m quite happy with Draco, thanks.”
Turning, Harry left without looking back again.
He keeps the card in hand but stows the envelope in his suitcase before picking it and Lucy’s cage up again and making his way over to the bank of Floos lining the far wall. He waits his turn, then steps up to the next available one and takes a handful of Floo powder.
“Potter,” Draco warns.
“If she comes here I’ll tell her myself. And tell her to bring me a pain potion while she’s at it.” Merlin, his fucking head is pounding.
“Oh, but it’s true,” Draco says. “It’s very interesting, you see. He’s the Boy Who Lived, inspires courage and determination and whatnot in everyone around him, except for me. I only feel inspired to hit him. It’s really not fair.”
And Harry had to turn away to hide his smile.
Potter scowls. “He’s such an arse, I couldn’t even deal with it today. He was making fun of Stalton’s duelling again so I sent him the fuck home.”
“Okay,” Potter says. “Okay, I’m good now. You can move.”
“Pans tells me I’m being ridiculous. That I’ve already done more than enough and no one expects me to keep saving the world a little bit at a time. But sometimes I still feel…” He breaks off with an awkward laugh. “Sorry, I’ve no idea why I’m dumping this on you.”
“From the last case you worked,” Ron says. “The cursed house?”
“No. I’m staying on the sofa.”
“Thanks,” Harry said as the bartender set a fresh pint on the bar for him. Harry slid several coins over to him and waved off the change.
, wonderful enough that the rest of the world went a little blurry around the edges, warm in a way that made Harry want to sink deep into it and never come back up again. It felt captivating and compelling and a little bit dangerous, and even though it’d been happening for the better part of the last year, the thrill of it had never quite worn off.
“That’s not possible,” Harry says aloud, looking back and forth. “We didn’t have a second Snitch.”
“That won’t work, you know,” Draco said, nudging his hand away. “These are cheap glass, not crystal. And what lost opportunities?”
articles, the constant tedious trips abroad…
That perked Harry right up. “Brilliant,” he said. “I haven’t had Thai in ages.”
“Hold on,” he says, and Harry shuts his eyes, and holds on tight, and breathes.
Well. This recipe called for beating egg whites until stiff, and Harry fully intended to make up for is lack of an apple corer by doing that by hand.
“He did,” he says, wondering where she’s going with this.
“Harry,” Ron says, voice tight. “The fuck are you doing in the Ministry?”
in general, and not living with Malfoy specifically.
Really, he supposed he ought to be grateful that Draco had let them get through dinner before he started with the groping. He’d skipped lunch today, and when Draco was hungry he ate with a single-minded sort of focus. Harry had talked a little bit about his day, his classes, the little bits of Weasley family news he’d picked up from Ron, and Draco had made appropriate ‘mm-hm’ noises through his full mouth.
“No,” Harry said. “I don’t think I could wait that long.”
“You’re perfect,” Draco said, rolling his hips.
“Parkinson,” Harry muttered. He looked around for an empty chair he could steal, and caught sight of Draco across the pub. Draco smirked at him before looking away, and Harry turned back to his own table before remembering he still needed a chair.
Malfoy tipped his head at the door. “Shall we?” he asked.
Him, a Malfoy, getting that sort of reception on Knockturn. It was something of a marvel how little respect the family name garnered these days. Draco could remember coming here with his father when he was a child, and the sort of attention Lucius would draw. How passersby would watch with awe, how polite and deferential everyone would be. The way they would hasten to get out of his way.
He looks down to find that Malfoy’s managed to produce a handkerchief—monogrammed, of course—and caught Harry’s spend neatly.
“Hm,” Malfoy says, looking up at the mansion. “Well, I’m not surprised, considering.”
Draco can feel his cheeks going pink. “It was your idea,” he says, looking away, then again, softer, “It was all your idea.”
The weeks that follow are difficult as well, though in a different way. He and Potter avoid each other, though Draco’s caught Potter watching him in class or across the Great Hall. He looks tired, with dark circles beneath his eyes and his mouth perpetually pinched into a frown. Draco thinks he looks guilty, which is ridiculous. After studying the results of what Potter had accidentally brewed, there was no way either of them could have resisted it. Potter had swallowed some of it and Draco…
“He’s been cursed,” Draco says, stunned. “He was under the same curse I am.”
“Then go to sleep,” Draco said, reaching for his book and his glasses again. “We’ll work out the rest of it in the morning.”
Nine minutes later, he appeared down in the kitchen where he found Molly up to her elbows in soapy dishwater, dealing with the last of the breakfast dishes.
“Bloody hell,” he says, taking a drink for ‘filth.’ He sighs. “I really thought I had that one.”
on a fellow Auror and talented enough to have got away with it for this long.
They hold each other tight, and Teddy’s hair turns from bright turquoise to a wildly curling navy blue, almost exactly halfway between what it was and Potter’s. Draco looks him over. He’s not much impressed with the boy’s appearance: strange hair, torn jeans and a worn black coat over a black jumper, scuffed black boots flapping around his ankles with the laces undone, and Merlin this current fashion trend of new clothes that look old is absurd. But Teddy looks beyond happy to see his godfather, and Draco supposes the rest of it doesn’t really matter. Potter takes Teddy by the shoulders and pushes him back, makes a big show of looking him up and down.
Draco glances over at his bags, his whole life packed up small and crammed into canvas. He peers into the darkness of what he presumes is the living room. He listens, but can’t hear anything.
, so I think I’m still ahead. Has he ever told you about the time he jumped off the top of Tower Bridge in pursuit of a suspect?”
Draco laughed at him, and they crossed the street and passed back into shadow, and Draco’s hair returned to its usual pale gilt, and Harry finally looked away. His fingers had curled up in his pockets to keep from reaching out and touching, crumpling up the receipt into a tight ball. He opened his hand and fidgeted with it, then mashed it down into the corner of his pocket.
“And I shouldn’t be,” Harry went on after a long moment. “I’m not even—doing anything, I’m not—I’m not like you two, I’m not—”
“What?”
to know for sure.
“Well it sound stupid when you say it like that,” Potter says, and for Merlin’s sake, now he’s gone all sulky. This isn’t at all how Draco planned for this to go.
“C’mon,” Potter says to him, and loops his arm through Draco’s and tugs him flush against Potter’s side.
After a moment, he gathers his wits enough to think to check the cage. Did they eat something they shouldn’t have? Perhaps a poisoned mouse? It’s the only explanation Draco can think of to explain what’s just happened. But an inspection of the cage doesn’t provide any explanation. Aside from a scattering of feathers in the bottom, it’s clean.
Harry exhaled hard. “Thank god.”
Harry ignores him and goes to sit in the chair he’d occupied when the real Malfoy first walked in. He pulls his knees up onto the cushions and steadies his arm over one leg. He aims at the dead Malfoy.
After that, time stopped making sense.
* * * * *
They take their broomsticks up, and good Merlin, Weasley wasn’t exaggerating when he said that Granger could barely hold on. She’s wobbling alarmingly and is holding her broomstick in a deathgrip. Fleur and Angelina both Charm sparkling circles of light into the air for hoops, Percy keeps the hard rubber practise Bludger in a firm grip, and Ginny Levitates the Quaffle.
Potter gives him that crooked smile, the one that turns Draco’s insides to melted butter. “Yeah. I want to. Draco, will you marry me?” He glances down. “I’d get on the floor again but I’ve been pushing my leg today and I’m not sure I can get up a second time.”
One of the things that’s always impressed him most about Zelda is how clever she is, and he should have known she’d put together the very specific timing of his absences sooner rather than later.
“Impressive, isn’t it?” Draco says mildly. Inwardly, he’s a bit enchanted by Potter’s reaction. There are drawbacks to witches and wizards being raised as Muggles, but respect for magic is not one of them, and the sheer reverence in Potter’s voice brings a smile to Draco’s face. Despite living in the magical world for nearly two decades, there will always be a part of Potter that’s occasionally struck speechless by magic, able to find a joy and wonder in it that Draco, raised as a pureblood, will never match.
The first touch of Draco’s finger made Harry’s hips jerk, and he breathed deep and even as Draco pushed inside, slow and steady. It burned, being forced open like this even with a single finger. Harry hadn’t had anything inside him since the last time Draco had touched him like this. He liked it well enough, but it didn’t really do much for him when he did it to himself, so he never bothered.
“Not that I plan on us crashing,” Potter assures him. “But you never know what other people might do.” He jams his helmet onto his head.
“Ouch!”
Moving carefully, he turns over so he can see Potter. His hair’s grown back again—Draco didn’t notice last night—and falls over Potter’s forehead in an unruly tangle. Slowly, he reaches out and cards his fingers through it. It’s softer than it looks, thick and glossy, and utterly addicting. Draco’s always loved a man with touchable hair. It feels odd to be touching Potter like this, but bloody hell, Draco had Potter’s cock up his arse just a handful of hours ago. He thinks that entitles him to a bit of harmless hair-touching. He combs his fingers through it again, and again, before it really sinks in what the fuck he’s doing and who he’s doing it to.
Harry broke off when a soft tinkling of glass came from the bookcases. The empty vials stacked there were vibrating gently. One rolled slowly to the edge of the shelf and tipped over the edge, smashing across the floor. The empty jars stacked on the shelf above them began to vibrate as well, clattering together, and two more vials shattered against the floorboards. The worktable began to shake, and the crates in the corner shifted again, sending the topmost one tumbling to the ground.
He hands over the sheet of parchment and Draco reads. It’s meant to be a healing spell, cast on patients with severe cases of PTSD. It’s why so many of the Muggle victims were veterans, and once Potter dug into it, he found that all of the rest had a history of trauma. There’s a woman who’d been caught in a house fire and narrowly escaped with her life. One man was in a severe car accident. Two more were victims of assault.
Ron snorted. “That’s what Malfoy said about it.”
“So you discuss it at volume on Diagon Alley?” Park asked, laughing.
They’re sitting down to dinner in Grimmauld Place—
“I hope that you can get something useful out of him, because we certainly haven’t been able to find anything useful here at the Ministry,” Ron said, folding his arms over his chest and slouching lower in his chair.
“You would cause a mass panic,” Draco said. “Bring in that many people on a threat of this scale, and someone’s going to talk.”
It was the best blowjob of Harry’s life.
Something in Harper’s expression softened, and he held out his own wands. “Would you like to check mine?”
“Leaving already?” Granger asks, glancing at the door to Potter’s room.
“Again?” Harry echoes following her gaze up into the sky and nearly sagging with relief. Malfoy’s on a broomstick, guiding it rapidly closer. “He’s only ever beat me once.”
Harper looks at Draco. Sneers. “You’ve been in America, haven’t you? Can’t imagine you’ll be much of a challenge if you’ve been playing Quodpot for the last decade.”
“Hm.” Narcissa glances back to the door again. “Perhaps I also wanted to meet this young lady with whom you’ll be spending so much of your time.”
Potter’s staring down at the second half of his quail egg as if it’s issued him a personal challenge. He takes a quiet breath, pops it into his mouth and barely chews before he’s swallowing, his face a perfectly blank mask.
He looks back across the room at where Potter’s describing something to Ginny that involves lots of grand gesturing. It feels impossible that Potter wants Draco like Draco wants him. But still… what if?
“Malfoy,” Potter calls over the rumbling purr of the bike’s engine. “Are you coming?”
“Er, right,” Potter says. “That’s a good point. But, you know, I know we aren’t, and if you’re not comfortable…”
“Not for me, thanks,” said Draco, seizing the perfect opportunity to announce his escape. “I think I’m going to head off.”
Draco’s stomach flops in a way that’s, to his surprise, not altogether unpleasant. He can feel his cheeks going pink, and he does his best to school his expression into something that’s not annoyed or—even worse—eager. He’s not sure that he’s quite managed either.
Draco arches his eyebrows. “Didn’t you just say you wanted to meet up with Pansy?”
I got my subdepartment name approved.” He spreads his arms wide. “You’re looking at the new head of Magical Accessory Development.”
“Now,” Harry adds, and Malfoy rolls his eyes, but flicks the cigarette into the shrubs and follows Harry in.
“So dramatic,” Ginny said. She yanked the pillow away so Harry could see her roll her eyes. “And if that’s what’s got you worried, why not let someone else find someone for you?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “I beg your pardon, oh Saviour. I tend to save the champagne and caviar for the weekend.”
All too soon, Harry found himself standing outside the shop, a narrow stone building with a high, peaked roof. The wooden sign reading Ashby’s Imports & Antiques in fading black script creaked quietly on its hinges where it hung above the heavy iron-banded oak door. The shop’s single display window held a pleasing display of what Harry assumed were antiques, but just looked like junk to him: a battered brass cauldron etched with runes, a collection of stirring rods fanned out before it, a cluster of empty glass bottles, a stack of leatherbound books, two crystal candy dishes, several candlesticks of varying height, and a broad silver tray holding a full china tea service painted with tiny periwinkles. The sign propped in the corner of the display window still read Closed, but the door opened only seconds after Harry knocked on it.
“If it’s a coworker,” Draco said. “What about if it’s your superior?”
“Why?” Potter asks. He’s starting to look suspicious, like Draco’s trying to pull one over on him.
They walked out together, and Draco knocked his shoulder into Harry’s before they parted ways, Draco heading up Diagon to wherever he’d agreed to meet up with Pansy and Harry around the side of the coffee shop to a quiet place from which to Apparate.
Draco nods, frowning a little. “All right,” he says.
* * * * *
“I’m sorry,” he says, half a beat too late. One hand clutches the collar of his dressing gown closed at his throat and the other, the injured one, he keeps tucked behind him. He leans his shoulder against the edge of the door to hold it half-shut. “I didn’t mean to worry you.”
Draco tamps down the wave of irritation that rises up in him at that. He and Weasley had spent another two nights watching the shop, gathering information about how its customers behaved. They’d worked out the timing, the password, the secret knock. They’d been prepared for Draco to go in, and when they’d requested permission, they were denied. It seems the papers had finally got wind of Draco’s return. ‘Too risky,’ Robards had said. There was a good chance Draco would be made as an Auror.
“I’ll think on it,” Potter promises with a nod.
He retreats back into the forest and searches around. It takes him a little longer to find a couple of rocks, and he crouches in the pathetic shelter of some shrubbery and uses the rocks to scrape off the bark and smooth out some of the bumps.
“I was warning Draco about Agnes,” Potter protests. “And anyhow, should I have used a different example? I could have told him about Pantsy—”
“Come on, then,” Potter says, and his voice sounds as warm as his magic feels. “Let’s get you home.”
They finish the sandwiches, and Draco ends up sharing the cake just so he doesn’t have to put up with Weasley sulking and eyeing him like a crup begging for scraps.
He Disapparates without another word, leaving Draco alone in the forest. It should irritate him to see that Potter thinks so little of him, but at this point Draco really doesn’t give a fuck.
He was just in time.
“Enjoy your chat,” Zelda tells him, keeping her eye on the clock as she labels a crystal vial.
Ron’s footsteps went back up the stairs. Harry barely caught the murmur of voices, and then the Floo flared twice.
There was a moment of silence where Harry didn’t need to see them to know that Ron and Hermione had just exchanged A Look.
“Yes too much drunker,” Seamus said with a grin, and Harry walked away more quickly in an attempt to avoid hearing wahtever he was about to say next. He miscalculated; the distance between them only meant that Seamus raised his voice when he said, “I want to hear more about Malfoy’s cock!”
“You’re gonna need to drive,” Potter says. “Just get your leg over here, put your foot on the gas and I’ll—”
They stride across the lobby, past the empty front desk, then out and across the cracked pavement of the car park. Draco’s spine itches just between his shoulder blades, but the crawling anticipation of danger eases as they approach the car. They’re nearly there, they just have to get in and take off and then they’ll be safe.
Draco yawns as he decants the Scintillating Solution into a crystal jar, screws on the lid, and carefully labels it before setting it on the shelf he uses for finished mail orders. He’s got about a dozen more mail orders to see to before he makes his ninth transformation just three days from now, but it’s nearly midnight and he can barely keep his eyes open. He takes the cauldron over to the sink and rinses it before lathering up a stiff brush with the Cauldron Soap and beginning to scour the dregs of the potion.
Harry grunts again and disconnects. It’s late, but he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to sleep. He does well enough on an hour or two of sleep a night. With every year that passes, his requirement for human things becomes less and less. He’s sure one day he’ll wake up and never even need to piss again. For a long time, Harry sits out on Ron and Hermione’s holiday house porch and watches the waves come in over Tintagel.
“Ugh,” says Harry. “That’s what I was afraid of. You’re the worst.”
Harry pulls up a couple of bottles of soda—Coke for himself and an orange Fanta for Malfoy—that are properly icy beneath their Cooling Charms. Harry pries off the caps with his bottle opener, and makes a mental note to send Hermione yet another thank you note for this jacket. If he gave her a Galleon for every time it’s saved his arse so far, he might as well sign over his entire Gringotts vault.
“How do you know?”
that, but it still stings.
“Well,” Draco said, leaning back in his chair. Merlin, Harry was lucky that
-ed on the floor of his drawing room.
He was still trembling faintly with small aftershocks of pleasure when Draco pulled off and licked his lips again, made certain he caught Harry’s eyes before he visibly swallowed.
can be a bit unpredictable, and I’m going to be casting it strong.”
Michael was tall, dark, and handsome. He had a winning smile and a firm handshake and Harry thought the date was going well, at first. There was easy conversation which quickly became flirting, and then—
“No,” Harry insists. “It was just the once—”
Worried, thinking maybe it’s Potter’s ankle, Draco’s halfway out of his bed when the moan shapes itself into a word.
They work for a while longer. She fills up a watering can and goes around her garden, watering her plants, while Draco takes up the gardening shears and trims the shrubbery that’s planted along the side of the shed.
“I got myself clunked over the head and dosed with a potion.
headaches. Remember that campaign she ran in fourth year, trying to liberate all the Hogwarts house-elves whether they wanted to be liberated or not?”
The raid was organized not even six hours later. The Department for the Regulation and Control of Potions and Potion Ingredients got back to him quickly, saying that they didn’t have any licenses on file for a supplier at that location or by that name. The Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures also reported back quickly, saying they hadn’t issued any permits to raise or keep nogtails to anyone in that area. Mr Stuart was called back in and asked to submit a Pensieve memory of each incident in question. These were examined and verified, and a warrant was obtained. At the very least, they’d be able to arrest William and Eleanor Bailey for keeping magical creatures without the appropriate permits.
He pushed off the wall and tugged Draco forward, tipped his head up and kissed him almost chastely, a warm and lingering press of lips. He felt Draco melt against him, the way he always did when Harry kissed him gentle like this. His hands slid up Harry’s chest and over his shoulders to loosely cup the back of his head, fingers scratching lightly through the hair at the nape of Harry’s neck.
“More often than when I was at Hogwarts,” he points out.
And it’s ironic that if he’d joined in on the mayhem, he’d have been safe. Fire tends to corrupt a magical signature, but the very point of
“Sorry, sorry,” Draco murmured. He patted one hand against Harry’s hair. “Please.”
“Nice legs,” said Ginny.
“Okay,” Potter says as Draco turns over onto his side, facing away. “I’ll be here.”
They work comfortably together, and quickly fall into a rhythm.
Due to waking up later than usual, and then his shenanigans with Draco followed up by a long shower, Harry reached the kitchen much later than he normally did. He wasn’t even halfway down the stairs to the basement when the warm smells of baking told him that Kreacher’d got one up on him today. On the one hand, Harry hated to lose. On the other, Kreacher had made crepes and despite himself, Harry loved Kreacher’s crepes. Ginny and Ron and Hermione were already down there, Hermione working diligently at the daily crossword while Ron and Ginny bickered over god-knew-what.
He never thought he’d be in a kitchen, cooking dinner with Pansy Parkinson. It’s odd, but in a nice sort of way, how relaxed this feels. And the fact that he hasn’t yet seen Pansy wear anything but Muggle clothes, and Draco still hasn’t quite wrapped his head around the fact that she’s dating Luna Lovegood, of all people. But her happiness is a deep and steady thing, and Draco thinks that he’s probably all right with this being his new normal.
He waits until the door shuts behind Potter, then sorts through the potions Potter had lined up on the vanity. He takes a Blood Replenisher, and one that promotes faster healing. He’s tempted by a pain potion, but he’s not familiar with some of the spells Potter used on it and he’s wary of the magics interacting poorly with each other. He’ll get Potter to keep refreshing the Numbing Charm on it. It’s for the best he do it, anyhow, since he was the one who healed Draco. A spell from him will settle more readily, and be more effective.
“Bloody weird when you do that,” Weasley muttered as his partner, Junior Auror Park, bound up the other two wizards—John and Joseph Jenkins, who weren’t twins but looked so alike that Draco couldn’t quite tell them apart in the dim light—with heavy
Then barely a year later, Malfoy had returned home with as little warning as when he’d left, and effectively vanished from the public eye. Harry hadn’t been able to gather much information on this stretch of Malfoy’s timeline. There’d been no shortage of witnesses documented in the gossip pages of dozens of newspapers all across Europe, but here in the UK Harry found nothing but speculation. The
“Hey,” he says, smiling. His nose and cheeks are a little pink with cold, his hair windswept.
“Three olives,” Draco repeats.
pastry?” he repeated.
And it was, it truly was. Today was the best day Draco’s had recently. A Quidditch game, and spending the entire afternoon in Potter’s company, and Draco can’t think of anything else he’d have liked more.
Hanging his ridiculous hat on its peg by the door, he went into the small bathroom and turned on the lights.
He sighs again. Oh yes. This’ll be fun.
Please, Draco thinks, waiting for Potter to speak. If Potter doesn’t agree, Draco has one last plan. Potter owes Narcissa a Life Debt. It’s a complicated process to claim a Life Debt on behalf of another family member, but it can be done. Draco doesn’t want to force Potter like that, but if that’s the only choice left to him, so be it.
“Deal,” Zelda says. She rolls up her sleeves and slips her wand out of its holster, and takes Draco’s place at the worktable before the simmering cauldron. “Do I need to do anything with the others?”
Park scrunched up her nose at that. “Don’t remind me,” she said.
Draco takes off his jumper before going outside. It’s a very light grey wool, and he doesn’t want to get it dirty. He folds it and puts it back up in his room, then rolls up his shirtsleeves as he takes his Transfigured gardening tools outside. It’s a bit cooler than he anticipated, but he heads over to a sunny patch near the back corner and starts there.
“Then this is bad, isn’t it,” Harper said, expression drawing tight.
“Wha…?” Malfoy said blearily, picking himself up.
That got an unexpected laugh out of Harry. “Such an arse,” he said, shaking his head.
“Another few years and you won’t think kissing’s so bad anymore,” Potter tells him, and Teddy rolls his eyes.
Harry’s throat goes tight at the thought of Malfoy, and between one blink and the next he’s suddenly standing in the tiny Auror break room with a spoon in his hand, a soggy tea bag balanced on it.
“Unintentional?” Potter echoes.
Harry obligingly kissed his way up the side of his neck until he reached the hinge of Draco’s jaw. He sucked at the little indent right below his ear and listened to Draco gasp, felt him shudder with pleasure against Harry. He breathed deep, the warm smell of skin and soap, laced with a faded edge of worn-off cologne, and a sudden burst of longing detonated in the depths of Harry’s chest. He sucked again before kissing at Draco’s jaw, then ducked his head and nosed at Draco’s cheek to get him to put his head up for a proper kiss. Draco murmured something that might’ve been Harry’s name and then their lips met, Draco’s mouth so soft and pliant, fitting perfectly against Harry’s for a moment before it fell open. Harry licked into Draco’s mouth and got about two seconds of warmth and sleep-sour breath and the slick side of Draco’s tongue against his own, and then Draco jerked back.
“Right,” Harry said, fidgeting with the spatula in his hands. He knew Ron meant well, but this was a conversation he wanted to stop having as quickly as possible. “Thanks. I appreciate your concern. But, you know, every couple moves at their own pace, and. We’ll, you know. Get there when we get there.”
A bright flash lights the room starkly, and the loud crack of thunder that follows an instant later makes Harry startle. He whips his head around to look out the window.
Amusement, Draco decides. He’s definitely amused because he can’t handle the alternative. It’s been a tough couple of months since Megan’s death. Two months, two weeks, and three days since she died. And he’s been doing sweet fuck-all since then. It’s standard procedure to remove an Auror from field duty when he’s lost his partner. But Draco’s been stuck with nothing but deskwork for over ten weeks now. He’s attended all the mandatory grief counselling, passed all his psychological evaluations with flying colours, and still they won’t assign him a new partner. At this point he’s an Auror in name only, and he’s pretty sure they’re not going to send him back out in the field again anytime soon, possibly ever. For the last two and a half months he’s been a glorified filing clerk, and there’s only so much filing one man can handle before he goes entirely mad, and perhaps that’s how he’s ended up here.
“There isn’t!” When Potter opened his mouth to argue back Draco spat out, “Don’t. I’ve been working on this case for four months. Four. And I’m telling you, every spell, every potion and person I’ve looked into couldn’t find him that way! We aren’t going to find him through his magic!”
Malfoys expression for a moment was unreadable but a sneer quickly twisted his features, “No, they’re just asking us to pretend to be in love.”
Beth gave him a knowing look, “Ah, date night!”
Malfoy nodded stiffly, but wasn't quite satisfied yet, "And this glamour? How experienced are you with it? Will the spell need to be refreshed?"
But his words were spoken softly and he reached out to gently take the box and open it. Inside were two simple bands. Each made of intertwined silver and gold.
"Darling, pas en français." Harry smiled right back and Malfoy huffed, not needing to fake his annoyance. Harry only smiled back in response, taking a sip of his latte. The cafe was quite busy but their table at least had the view they'd come for; the bakery across the street. It was the last place the latest victim had stopped and they wanted to get an idea of the business before they approached.
It was so quiet Draco almost missed it when Potter muttered, “Thank you.”
“Where do y’think this should-'' Potter turned, saw the scowl on Draco’s face and sighed. Setting the flour down on the counter Potter crossed his arms and gave Draco that same exaggerated scowl that he’d seen a hundred times when they were in school, “What?”
Was all Potter said before his lips met Draco's.
Budget, theme, destination or location? Expected amount of attendees? Harry never realized how much work went into planning a wedding - even one that would never happen. They had scheduled to meet with two wedding planners that day and at first Harry had thought they should have scheduled more. But no, two appointments in one day it turns out were more than enough. He knew the questions to ask, to provoke a reaction, to judge the person's reaction. He knew how to subtly manipulate a conversation all the while giving the impression he was thick. He learned how to pick up on people’s bodily clues early on. How to gauge people's moods, what to ask and when to back off; though it was something he’d ever thank them for.
He watched Malfoy march out the door, flinching when it was closed with too much force. Hot shame and guilt washed over him. He really would have suspected Malfoy of foul play before. But now? Now that he’d seen how hard he worked, how dedicated he was to solving this case, seen him during the late nights and early mornings? Now that he’d lived with him and seen him sweet-talk shop keeps so Harry could slip away to discreetly scan the building, or the way he cherished the box of teas his mother had given him, or the way he called Harry out without fear or admiration of “the chosen one” to get in the way; only now did Harry realize how much his opinion on Malfoy had shifted. And he understood how even after they solved this case no one else at the ministry would see him differently. Would loathe to give him any credit. They still saw him as something he never really was even after all these years. And Harry was almost surprised to find how guilty he felt that he’d once seen him the same way.
Ollivander coughed, bringing him back to the present, and the old man’s pale eyes seemed to twinkle in understanding as he spoke,
Draco agreed and gathered his things up to leave, wondering if Potter would be back yet. He’d been odd after the appointment. Distracted. Draco just hoped it was something to do with the case and his gryffindor wasn’t off being too reckless.
He just narrowly escaped a nasty hex as he rounded the corner back onto the street panting and took off once again to find another alleyway he could take to get around and behind the man. He prayed to whatever gods would listen that he would make it in time. That this daft plan would actually work. That Harry would be okay.
"Voilà, ma chèrie," Malfoy set a steaming mug on the spiral Harry had been inspecting, "nos crêpes seront bientôt là."
“You. Are. Such. An. Idiot.”
“Me?” Draco scoffed, pulling back just enough to look Harry in the eyes,
Draco’s expression went from furious to confused to disbelieving as Harry spoke and before he could say anything else Draco let out a strained laugh. Harry furrowed his brows in confusion as Draco just laughed a way that could only be described as hysteric.
“I know  you do,” Draco replied, “and I know you want to catch this guy as badly as I do. So, for now we have to stay focused even if I’d love nothing more than a repeat of last night.”
Harry didn’t wait for Malfoys response before rushing off down the street. He didn’t see Malfoy’s quizzical expression as he watched him go.
“Fine!” He threw up his hands and turned his attention to Harry, “How you feeling mate?”
Malfoy shook his head and looked away from Harry’s piercing gaze, finally wrenching his arms free from Harry’s grip and turning to half sit half collapsed onto the bed. He balled his hands into the soft grey comforter and shook his head, refusing to acknowledge how damp his eyes had gotten. Harry dropped down onto the bed nest to him. Sitting with one leg crossed on the bed so he could face him, lowering his voice,
Potter scoffed but sat anyway, “I just can’t believe the bastard got away again! How could they not find some trace of him or his magic at the scene?”
Intrigued Harry moved to stand next to the other man, Draco moving his hand and wand once again to dispel whatever had created the green aura. On Malfoy’s cleared desk sat a simple wooden button. Harry frowned in confusion. Looking up into Draco’s grey eyes that danced with humor for the first time in- merlin how long had it been since he’d seen Malfoy smile like that? But what did a button have to do with anything? Harry was just about to ask the question when Malfoy began speaking again,
As if sensing Harry's eyes on him Malfoy looked up from the trunk he'd bend bent over and shifting through, turning slightly to raise a brow in question. Harry turned quickly back to his own trunk. Not that he was embarrassed to have been caught staring, only he really hadn't seen Malfoy up close in four years. Of course he'd changed. Grown into his sharp features and styled his pale blonde hair in a way that looked naturally tousled. Bastard. Harry'd given up taming his curls long ago, letting them grow out to where he could wrangle them out of his face and into a bun. It was just easier to manage and he envied Malfoy's ability to always look so put together is all.
Harry cleaned on impulse. He cleaned when he was anxious or angry or in this case; confused. Merlin was he at odds. His heart and his mind seemed to be having a duel and there was no amount of deep breathing or reading that could calm him. So he cleaned. He threw himself into dusting and decluttering and used his wand as little as possible because well he’d grown up cleaning this way and the habit had stuck.
Harry stepped up to her first, offering his arm which she took with a surprisingly firm grasp and preformed the charm. Malfoy held her hand with a blank expression on his foreign face. The witch nodded at them before picking up a shard of old wood that had been laying amongst other debris in the warehouse,
Potter arrived at their little apartment shortly after he did and they settled easily into their routine; call for take out, play chess till it arrived, argue over who had won more games over dinner (though neither had really kept count),when Draco irritably brought up that he should have been enjoying greek food with people who actually enjoyed his presence. At Potters confused expression Draco rolled his eyes and continued, “Beth’s fiancee Anne invited me to join them for dinner tonight.” Malfoy paused and looked at the suddenly interesting wood grain of the table, “Well invited us. And when I turned them down Anne insisted we have a double date sometime.”
“Pet names.” Harry wished he had something more intelligent to say but the idea of referring to Malfoy as anything but Malfoy was odd to say the least. They’d been Malfoy and Potter to each other for a decade.
The loud noise snapped him out of whatever that had been and Draco didn't have to fake the embarrassment and flush that must be covering his features. If his mind hadn't just short circuited perhaps he'd even be angry but all he could think about as he watched Harry speak to the venue's host was how right Harry's lips had felt on his own. How his jaw tingled with the phantom trace of his kisses.
“Well, do you want to move past it? I’m sure the two of you can find a way past it. I don’t know what stupid thing he did but I’ve seen the way he looks at you, I can’t doubt his devotion to you.”
Draco frowned harder if that was at all possible and said dryly,
“So, as you might have gathered, this is a thing,” He gestured between himself and Draco with his free hand, “It’s new and a lot happened while we were undercover.”
Harry shook his head, entranced.
Harry did not jump, he started a little maybe but totally knew the old man had walked up. Just how had he been so silent?
The patronus’s message ended suddenly and Draco leapt to his feet, rushing past a confused Beth still standing in the doorway. He cast his own patronus as he ran, repeating the address and directing the wispy pale fennec to deliver the message directly to Robards. That done he turned on the spot, concentrating on the road he knew adjoined Heritage and apparated.
Malfoy didn’t reply but his grip on Harry's shirt tightened and his shaking continued. So Harry held him. And eventually Malfoy’s shaking stopped. But they didn’t move. And eventually, they  fell asleep still entangled in the warm embrace.
Draco and Harry purchased a three bedroom cottage on several acres: room to expand should they ever choose to do so. Renovation of their little house was drawing to an end and Draco was currently occupied with making sure the house was tidy enough for guests. Beth and Anne were coming over for their first visit to the other couples new home. Draco couldn't help but smile at the thought of this, this cottage he and Harry put so much time into, being his home. For the first time in many years he felt absolutely at peace. This is where he belonged.
Draco was in fact a fan of greek food, which is why it almost pained him to say, “I’m afraid we can’t tonight. We’ve other plans already.” Like patrolling the area and sweeping the stores and surrounding areas with discrete spells for anything that might relate to their case for hours in the dark and ever colder weather.
Draco rounded one poorly lit alley into another, looking for all the world just another shopper who decided to take a risky detour. Or so he hoped as he kept his face a neutral mask of distraction and cast discreet spells to sense dark magic. They hadn’t been able to get a magical signature from the alley Anne was attacked in as once again the wizard had managed to erase it before he fled. Or simply left no trace somehow. Neither should have been possible in any case and so their best bet were the sweeping spells for general dark magic.
"Stay?"
So he let's go and says, "Good. Good, its policy after all. Can't make an arrest solo."
"Just a few," Potter's reply was cut short by the creak of the door opening. Draco glanced between the softly glowing charm potter had cast on the area and the way back. If the host turned around that stack of boxes they'd be entirely-
Potter just gave him the same unimpressed look from earlier as Draco sat up until a smile broke through and then he was outright laughing. The bastard. Drack scoffed,
"Nope. It's past three and you won't be able to get anything done if you can't keep your eyes open tomorrow. Not to mention you're going to be miserable on patrol in the morning. Or did you forget it's your turn?"
Potters laughing face morphed into his father's mirthless eyes. Lucius Malfoy strode up to him in the sitting room that only held fire in its proper place, granite mantle above that stared back at him with soulless eyes upon carved snakes. The impact of his father's glove against his cheek was nothing new. He'd braced for it. It still stung. Cursing him for being a failure, a stain on the family legacy, he lifted him by the collar saying were Draco not his only heir he would have- and the face wasn't his fathers anymore but Voldemort's. He held him off the tower at Hogwarts from where Dumbledore had fallen and he-
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. Hermione opened her mouth to add something but before she could the door to the room opened and in walked Draco Malfoy.
Their visit to the hospital had renewed his determination to solve this case; even if he had to search London brick by brick. Even Potter had been unusually quiet on their way back and as they returned to their investigation. Draco assumed Potter must be feeling much the same about the case. It had gotten personal. He hadn’t meant for it but it had. Meeting Beth and Anne, their targeting and attack, it all felt personal now.
Draco was straining to keep from smiling but Potter didn’t need to know that as he went on, “It’ll look better after we place and decorate it.”
“No! I mean yes! He is fine. It’s not that. I’m sorry, it’s rude of me to vent to you with everything you’ve just been through. I apologize.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, "Theres only one bed, Potter. And I am not sleeping on that loveseat."
Opening the door without further ado he put on his most charming smile, “Hello?”
He found Potter crouched by a back entrance in a storage room and sighed loudly. Startled green eyes met his and Draco was finding it increasingly hard as he moved closer to remain mad at the man when he looked like a deer caught in the headlights. Potter stood and they were close enough to whisper without being overheard, so Draco did,
Harry blinked awake and upon seeing their visitors nearly jumped up but Draco held him in place reminding him of his injury.
Draco looked at the hand on his shoulder and then up at his old school nemesis. His auror partner. Harry bloody potter. Who was looking at him in a way that made Draco feel for the second time that day, perhaps the second time ever, understood.
Malfoy huffed and wandlessly sent the book flying to land atop his magazine on the table. Mature. Harry raised a brow at this and Malfoy just sent him a look he’d learned in school meant, “Something to say, Potter?” Harry did not dignify it with a response, instead flicking the light off in the room. Malfoy shifted. He shifted again. They both shifted until Malfoy let out a frustrated groan and Harry couldn’t take it anymore, “For fuck sake, just spread out. You won’t die if you accidentally touch me.”
Instead of addressing the elephant in the room Malfoy had already gathered his pajamas and shut the bathroom door behind him. Harry sighed, gathering his own clothes and sitting on the bed to wait. When Malfoy finally exited the bathroom his hair was still wet but obviously brushed and his skin still a tinge pink from the hot shower, a soft contrast against the silvery grey button down pajamas he wore.
Draco could feel his face flush, “I do not gush!”
Draco was not impressed when Potter wandlessly summoned a quill and sheet of paper, the show off. He saw Potter write “rules” in bold messy letters at the top of the sheet. Then “hand holding is okay” in smaller lettering under it before looking at Draco, “What else do you think? A set date night?”
Damien and Henry visited the hospital two days after the incident as there was no way for them to know why the café had suddenly closed until they, now properly glamoured once more, “ran into” Beth in the market. Harry did not have to fake the mixture of anger and sympathy when she tearily relayed the news. She’d only left Anne’s side to retrieve changes of clothes. Now as Harry held open the door to Anne’s room at St.Mungos he wasn’t surprised to find Beth seated beside her. Allowing Draco in first he shut the door as the other man presented Anne the bouquet of colorful chrysanthemums and hyacinths he’d ever admit to spending so much time agonizing over selecting for her. Harry greeted Beth with his own gift: a humble loaf of banana bread.
Robards was firm in his decision that Harry take the case - the office was understaffed, the case was too big a priority for one agent to work alone, and most importantly: Harry was the only Auror not working an active case.
"Come on," Potter spoke quietly, "or do you need me to carry you to bed?"
Whatever he’d been about to say was cut off when Harry pulled him into a bone crushing embrace. He was okay. The bloody idiot. The brilliant reckless idiot.
It was insane, and Draco was likely going to regret it with his luck but he’d come to the conclusion that this thing he felt between them could go ignored no longer. Not if he was to retain any shred of sanity. So, he made his way to Ollivander’s and entered the ancient wand shop with a strength of will he didn’t even realize he possessed when he asked the older man where he might find, “Henry Varma.”
Instead he threw himself into the case, trying to see it from every possible angle and going over every thing they'd learned so far. There were a few suspected he could now cross off the list they'd compiled and now they could also get a description out to the public. People would know what kind of person to be wary of. Tips were already being sent their way via the one way apparition magic placed on their incoming tray. He assumed its duplicate resided with Robards or the unspeakable witch for security. Probably the latter.
Draco didn’t realise how long he and Beth chatted until customer’s started trickling in and she said, “Final rush! I’ll see you around yeah?”
Draco let out a short laugh, “Yes well I do appreciate it; where else would I go to pretend I’m getting any work done?”
Harry’s face scrunched in anger as he stopped his pacing to face the other man, his fists balled at his side. Of course Malfoy didn’t think they could have done anything, the pessimist. But Harry felt in his bones that he should- he could have done something. Must have. And so his clever retort was this,
“Does that clear some things up for you, Potter?”
Draco snorted gracelessly, “I was shocked of course that you’d suddenly kissed me - we’re even now. I am however livid that you can be so pig headed as to be gone an entire day without considering how it might cause others to worry!”
Judging by Malfoys smirk, those were not in fact terms of endearment. Harry just scowled back until Malfoy threw up his hand dramatically, “Mon cheri!” At Harry’s continued look of suspicion Malfoy rolled his eyes and explained, “It means ‘my dear’. Good enough for you oh chosen one?”
"It's nearly three in the morning."
“She’s okay. As well as can be expected at least. The healers aren’t entirely sure what he cast on her but the wounds are  healing even if it’s slower than normal. That has to be a good sign.” She let out a dry laugh but a genuine smile formed on her lips as she kept speaking, “Anne, the stubborn witch is already raring to get back to work. I know for a fact certain Healers are letting her read their patient reports and give feedback- despite those very healers prescribing her bed rest.”
Harry would have objected but Hermione was already pulling a still gaping Ron out of the room. When the door shut and silence filled the room he grinned tentatively up at Draco,
Yet he still had so little to go on and today hadn’t been the most encouraging start to their undercover operation. He put his head in his hands.
Beth and Anne shared a laugh but Harry just looked at him, that strange expression once again on his handsome face. But he snapped out of it so quickly that Draco wondered if he’d imagined it, dealing out slices of the still warm desert. They enjoyed the sweet treat in comfortable silence broken by the occasional contented comment. It wasn’t they said their farewells and led their guests down to the apartment’s entry room that they realized there might be a problem. Nearly two feet of a problem blocked up against the apartment’s posh glass doors. Even past the gathered snow, London was nothing but a blur of white and Draco recalled with a start that their building was warded against apparitions in and out going until you’d left the door. The very much not opening tonight door. Beth and Anne looked almost stricken, but Harry seemed to have recovered quickly, “Well, a sleepover it is!”
Even his sharp grey eyes seemed softer lately, though shadowed with dark lines indicating he probably slept just as well as Harry did even though he’d gotten the large comfortable bed. Malfoy was obviously committed to solving the case and had a work ethic Harry hadn’t expected from him but probably should have. Malfoy always had been extra in everything he did. Lost in thought he’d finished drying off and changing into a pair of joggers for bed. At least here he could dress as he normally would.
"Well, darling fiancé we have a lot of catching up to do."
Potter did not in fact put him down, carrying Draco in such an unseemly manner out of the office, though the apartment's little living area and into the bedroom. Where Draco found himself rather unceremoniously dumped on the bed, face red and protesting still,
Malfoy did not.
It was forceful but his lips were surprisingly gentle on Draco's as he moved a hand to entangle in his hair. Draco tipped his head back at the movement and felt Harry's lips trace his jaw, leaving a gentle trail of fire in each spot his lips touched Draco's skin.
His nightmare. He let out a huff of air and fell back into the pillows. It was just another nightmare: a tamer one at that. He shouldn't have forgotten his dose of dreamless sleep no matter how tired he'd been. The nightmares were the worse alternative to the risks of his continued use of the brew.
Draco blinked, he hadn’t even realized he’d ask the question aloud, “I- Well my mother taught me and we used to play together often. As for Hogwarts I mostly played with Blaise since Pansy never cared for the game; just watched and gave bad advice.”
"Sorry,"
Harry looks at him like-? He does not- They aren’t even-
“You’re awake!”
Draco nodded as Potter fixed his glasses back on his face and looked right at him,
When all he got in reply was Draco’s raised brow, Potter continued, reestablishing eye contact, “What I’m trying to say is we’re both being unprofessional. Our opinions on each other shouldn’t affect our work; and before you object, yes they are. We hardly speak enough to discuss the changes in the case let alone plan our next move.”
“Are you mad or hurt?”
Draco gets an interesting invitation...
And with that Draco stomped off to the bedroom; only to fall back on the closed door taking in shuddering breaths. He touched a shaking hand to his lips and cursed.
Harry just lay there trying to steady his ragged breaths. It had just been a dream. No one was in danger. They were safe. He clutched a shaking hand over one of Malfoy’s, needing to feel something solid. Something grounding and real. Malfoy went still for a moment, expression unreadable, before properly entwining their hands, his other hand still a comforting weight on Harry’s shoulder as he eased into laying on his side, leaned toward Harry. He stroked a gentle slightly calloused thumb over Harry’s hand where he held it.
Beth said it in a joking manner but nevertheless he felt the truth behind her statement. She had dark circles under her pale brown eyes and though she smiled at him it was weary. Draco made his best to return the smile but knew he’d been only as successful as she.
Malfoy stood suddenly from his desk and glared at him, face still twisted in emotion but voice cold and sharp, “Okay? What does it matter, Potter? She’s dead. I haven’t found the bastard yet. How would you be?”
Draco couldn’t help it. He laughed. Then Harry’s hurt and confused expression had him hurrying to explain,
“I don’t have a hero-complex.”
“My wife, Anise, was a spitfire. She wore her heart on her sleeve and there was never a moment to doubt her opinions as she'd make them well known. Now, she was someone who could take the measure of a person within moments of meeting them. But that wasn’t all she was; she was as complex a witch as anyone. There were sides to her no one could claim to know.
Harry turned to see her moving about Malfoy as she had just done to him, weaving her wand in intricate patterns and muttering the carmz incantations. Malfoy shifted into a stranger before his eyes and the witch once again stepped back with a satisfied grin before circling him and listing his new qualities,
When Potter came out of the bedroom some time later, damp hair already curling back into it’s natural mess he found Malfoy immersed in the magazine. Half empty tea forgotten. And if Harry’s heart stuttered at the sight of his school nemesis with the blanket Molly had given him draped over his shoulders casually reading the magazine his best friend had given him with a completely unguarded expression well he didn’t need to acknowledge it. Nor did Draco need to acknowledge the somersault his stomach did when Potter was suddenly right in front of him, tousled hair dripping and old band shirt riding up ever so slightly as he moved to make up his bed on the sofa.
Draco groaned. Morning patrol. He might have forgotten that small detail in his vigor to get back to work on the case. He found himself sitting back on the bed rubbing at his eyes once more in frustration. When the stars cleared from his vision Potter was still there. He'd moved from the doorway and was standing halfway between the door and the bed, just looking at him in concern. Maybe it was the exhaustion or some other malady had taken him but Draco didn't feel any pity from his look, just warmth. Genuine concern. And when had Potter decided he was someone worth getting concerned about instead of someone to hold in suspicion? Draco didn't know and so he shooed the other man out the door.
Potter was kind. He’d always known this; never doubted it even when the other man had left him with scars. Back then he was a lost teenager in the midst of a war and he had desperately wanted a way to end the horror. To stop before he did something he couldn’t come back from. He’d debated ending it himself. Then there was Potter and like everything else Potter beat him to that as well. Had Snape not interfered he’d have bleed out there. In Hogwarts, which had felt more like a home than the Manor had in recent years, staring up at the face of the one person he’d never been able to get off his mind. Back then, Draco wouldn’t have minded such a death. Now, he wasn’t so sure.
“This is the first time in months we’ve really had time to sit down like this,” Harry said. “Don’t you want to, I don’t know, tell me about your day or something?”
And then somewhere over the last year he’d stopped doing it so often, and then when Megan died he’d quit doing it altogether. Draco dumps the sliced mushrooms into the pan and gives them a stir. The sort of strain he was under towards the end of his Auror career—and on his own mental calendar he’s marked the end of his career at the precise moment Megan died and he’d been removed from active duty—wasn’t the kind that could be alleviated by something so mundane as chopping vegetables or stirring a pot. And maybe he’d have found other escapes, alcohol or drugs or meaningless sex, but he’d needed to keep his wits about him as he worked his way deeper and deeper into the conspiracy he’d spent the last decade unearthing. So he’d clung to his cigarettes and the occasional pint, and thrown himself into his work. He couldn’t find a way to escape the stress of working against the Ministry, of knowing that if he got caught he’d be sent to Azkaban—or worse. So he’d embraced it. Made it every moment of his life. Ate, slept and breathed it.
,” Harry whispered. Holding his breath, taking a moment to pinpoint where the sound had come from, he flung open the door—
Draco runs water into the sink so he doesn’t have to listen to the sound of Potter putting on his shoes and gathering his things.
Malfoy laughed a little breathlessly and kissed him. "That's the point, you do realise."
He’s not even looking, to Draco’s relief.
“Haven’t I just done that?” Potter points out, so fucking calm and reasonable that Draco wants to hex him for it.
Yeah, he really did. And isn’t that just some shit? Ten years he’s gone without touching another human being, at least seven or eight of those he hadn’t even been able to get an erection, so far from humanity was he by then. He’s a robot and robots don’t get fucking turned on, especially by other men and
“No, but I… You don’t understand. I wanted it, I wanted him to. And he wanted, but not really. He won’t when he realises he doesn’t. And I could have stopped him, I could have, but I didn’t…” He’s rambling, not making sense. Draco forces himself to stop and take a deep breath. He still feels uncomfortably warm, and tugs at his tie to loosen it. “I had my wand the whole time. I could have, I could’ve stopped him, I could have done… something.” Could have sealed the door again and had another go at Potter, he thinks. Another flare of arousal twists through him. Then he thinks of McGonagall’s shocked face and he feels sick all over again.
“I’d like you to focus on the case at hand, please, and not set off a curse because you’re too busy thinking about my dick to watch where you’re going.”
Draco blinks, because he’s still not entirely convinced this isn’t a strange fever dream. Honestly, it seems no less improbable than yanking a feather out from underneath his fingernail. “You’ve brought me soup?”
sign in the window and snuck off. Figured Malfoy would keep you long enough for me to get back before you finished up.” He scooted one of the paper coffee cups a little closer to Draco. “Thought you might need something nice after that. He seemed as though he was in a mood and looking to take it out on someone.”
Harry frowned at them. “What?”
“Finally,” Mr Stuart said, nodding to himself. He sounded pleased as punch. “It’s about time.”
Draco tugs his fingers free of Potter’s body, feels how his muscles tighten around Draco’s fingertips when he pulls them out. He crawls up the bed and lines up his cock, kisses the sharp curve of Potter’s shoulder blade as he pushes slowly inside.
They looked at each other for a long moment, and Draco wasn’t at all sure anymore whether they were just talking about pastry.
The grandfather clock downstairs strikes midnight, and Draco slows his touch as he counts the tones.
“And credibility in journalism is so very important, especially in this day and age when society’s most public figures go running about with all sorts of—”
Again. They do it again. And again. The corners of Harry’s eyes are starting to feel unusually wet. His breath is coming so fast he thinks he might hyperventilate, or maybe he’s already doing so.
“Of course,” he says, going over to her. He reaches out and takes the necklace from her.
, and Draco takes it just for something to do. It’s the financial section, and Draco would rather have the society section, but that’s folded neatly beside Narcissa’s plate, and Draco honestly doesn’t think he’ll be able to focus well enough to retain any of the stories, anyhow.
Draco’s good mood pops like a soap bubble “And what exactly is that supposed to mean?”
No, when their case broke the following week, it was a complete coincidence, and it was only by sheer luck that Draco was in the right place at the right time to catch it.
“Mm,” Harry said against Draco’s lips. “Hello.”
“Hi, Fleur. Yeah, I was busy with work stuff,” Potter says, barely glancing up at her. Victoire is clutching at his thumb with her whole hand, and Potter is making her arm dance.
“Wait. Put him back down and cancel your spell,” Draco says. He strips the spells from his hands while Potter gently lowers the body back to the table, and then he reaches out. He doesn’t quite touch the body, but he holds his hand so close to it that he can feel the chill wafting from its skin. He closes his eyes, breathing, and then… “Oh.” He opens his eyes and stares down. “He’s got a spell on him.”
It’s past eight o’clock and Draco’s exhausted, but he’s in a new place and in close quarters with Potter and doesn’t think he’ll be able to sleep. He thinks of the fingernail dream, and shudders. No, he’d best stay up a little while longer before he tries to sleep.
“That’s nice,” Draco says and Potter spins in a slow circle. “Are you quite all right?”
“There are spells to fix that,” Harry cuts him off, because not getting bruises on his knees is far more important than not crushing wrinkles into a stupid cloak, and before Draco can keep arguing with him, he leans in and sucks Draco’s cock into his mouth.
“Did you rat me out?” Harry called after him as he ducked away. “Ron! Did you tell him I’d started a file on Malfoy?”
Harry took a moment to picture that. “Did you touch your cock, too?”
Potter continues perusing the wine list like it’s got the answer to the meaning of life, and Draco tries to push aside his discomfort at the thought of how many more of these little details he’s going to get before all of this is over. Merlin, he and Potter are going to be
Then it passes and Malfoy’s head thuds against Harry’s shoulder. He breathes quietly, deeply. then presses a soft kiss to the nape of Harry’s neck.
“Is something wrong?” Potter asks, because of course he notices Draco’s sudden tension. How can he not, with Draco pressed right up against him like this? Merlin, how embarrassing.
“I guess,” Harry said, dumping the blueberries into his mixing bowl and gently folding them into the dough. He could feel his cheeks going inexplicably warm. “I mean, he fell through a staircase. Seems the least I can do to let him stay for breakfast. I mean. It’s no trouble. There’s going to be plenty.”
Potter nods, and then they get to work. They sort through the books of curses, organising them into several piles based on how promising they look, and Draco weeds out the copies of books he’s already looked through in his own efforts at research. Then Draco and Potter take two of the ones that look most promising and settle in to look through them.
He hopes it won’t have, because he certainly has no intention of calling it quits, and the only reason he can imagine Malfoy breaking things off is if he falls for someone else. Harry’s never seen Malfoy in a relationship, not since he sort-of dated Parkinson back at Hogwarts, and he has no desire whatsoever to see him in one now.
Harry bit down on his lip and shook his head; he hadn’t even realized he was making noise. Draco shifted in his lap, and Harry couldn’t hold back a whimper as Draco rolled his hips, again and again. He dropped his head to Draco’s shoulder, and Draco rubbed at the exposed back of his neck. Harry shivered.
in big letters, above a stylised illustration of an airship. It’s not exactly a broom, but they’re both things that fly so it’s close enough, as far as Draco’s concerned. “Did you buy this for me?”
This time an
Park’s mouth snapped shut with an audible click. Harry glanced up at her, frowning.
Potter’s smile edges toward something genuine. “Well, I’ll certainly try my best.”
“Would you mind?” Malfoy asked, looking expectantly at Harry.
Amid all the running around, Draco gets shuffled off to the side, and he ends up sitting in one of the hideously uncomfortable chairs in the little waiting area by the front desk. His hands won’t stop shaking, so he tucks them under his knees and watches everyone else scramble. He’s never felt so useless in his life and, Merlin, this is his fault. This is all his fault. After a while, Granger comes and sits down beside him.
“Phalanges,” he said quickly. “Distal, middle, proximal…”
“You’re such an arsehole,” Harry said, and by now he was laughing, half in disbelief, half at Malfoy’s sheer fucking nerve. “I can’t believe you stole this. If I were any sort of Auror, I’d arrest you for it right now.”
“Thanks,” Potter says, rolling to his feet. He grabs his own bag and goes into the bathroom, shutting the door behind himself.
“Oh?” Ingham says, looking Draco up and down. Honestly, the man is a powermad
or even just a simple,
“Do it,” Malfoy says. “Tell me.”
“Sure,” Potter says, leaning back in his chair.
A moment later, Harry heard the door to the bathroom click shut. Hurrying, he stripped off his clothes and tossed them in the general direction of the basket, then pulled on his pajamas, and could go no further until Draco came out of the bathroom. Harry plopped down onto the edge of the bed and awkwardly listened to the sound of the sink turning on and off, then on, then off again. He heard Draco pee, and the toilet flush. The pipes clanked softly, muffled in the walls, and then the door clicked open again and Draco returned.
He groaned a little when Malfoy’s fingers twisted in his hair and tugged, tipping his head back so that Malfoy could mouth his way down the exposed column of his throat, and there was a rush in this, too, in allowing Malfoy to get close to the tender, fragile parts of himself. Harry pushed his other hand up the back of Malfoy’s shirt to sweep up the warm smooth plane of his back, fingers spread wide to touch as much as he possibly could.
“Oh,” says Pansy cheerfully as she returns to the table, drinks in hand. “Are we discussing the Dark Days of Happy Pooter?”
There’s a long few seconds of silence.
He must have been giving Draco an odd look, because Draco slipped an arm over his shoulder and leaned in close to murmur in his ear, “You could try to look a little glad to be here.”
of his own. The two spells meet and explode in a shower of green sparks, and Clarke casts at Potter, and Filmore casts at Draco, and the duels go on. The third wizard, who’d previously been duelling Potter, takes the opportunity to make a run for it, goes dashing off across the basement and disappears up the stairs.
Potter gets that grin on his face that means he’s about to be sort of an arse, then catches Teddy in a loose headlock and gives him a loud smacking kiss to the top of his head while Teddy sputters with all the indignity a preteen boy can muster, which to be fair is quite a lot, and squirms away.
“You’re thinking it,” he says. He swishes his wand and sends his bag zooming off to deposit itself at the top of the stairs, waiting for him to come and empty it and put it properly away.
“Oh, I…” Draco blinks at him, the tea towel dangling limp from his fingers. “Are you sure you wouldn’t mind me coming along?”
Her voice comes through loud enough that Malfoy, standing several feet away, winces. Likely in sympathy for Harry’s poor eardrum.
Harry shrugs. “Didn’t really care. Knew I could always pick ‘em out if I had to, if we ever came in magical range of one another.”
“Because I need you,” he says quietly. “Please. I wouldn’t have brought him here if it wasn’t important. If this case wasn’t important.” He’s got no idea where the lie comes from, but it’s probably for the best he hadn’t known what he was about to say before he said it. The fact that he didn’t think before he said it is probably the only reason it’s believable. He can see she’s bought it in the way her anger simmers down. “Please,” he says again. “You could be an enormous help to him.”
he’d said of a suspect. At the time, he hadn’t realised how impossible it was to be able to sense magical signatures without a device or spell.
Harry laughs giddily, a little wildly. He’s just so fucking happy that Malfoy is here and he’s here with him and they’re both all right. “I don’t know why I can’t stop shaking.”
Draco gives him a smirk. “Of course. When I’m an arsehole, I like to be so deliberately. Surely you can understand that, Mr Terrible-Feeling-And-Really-Truly-Sorry.”
Draco sits up and blinks hard, trying to see across the room to the window. But his eyes haven’t adjusted to the darkness yet. The tapping comes again. Slowly, Draco pushes back the duvet and swings his feet out of bed. He takes a moment to grab his wand from the bedside table before he stands and moves carefully to the window, step by cautious step. He reaches the escritoire and leans across it, drawing back the curtains with the tip of his wand.
“Yeah, but it’s
And then they lie there in the dark.
- - - - -
Draco raises an eyebrow and casually tucks his left arm behind his back as Potter loops the strap around his head. “And you left them unsupervised?”
“Potter,” Draco calls from where he’s waiting beside the door. “We are going to be late.”
Draco’s guilty look intensified. “I… might’ve… possibly…” He mumbled something too low for Harry to catch.
“I don’t give a rat’s arse what you just said,” Potter snaps at him, and Draco rolls his eyes.
“Is it done?” he asked, tucking his face against Malfoy’s shoulder. He smelled like a wandfight, the faintly smoky smell of offensive magic clinging to his robes.
Harry took a few long moments to savor the image of Hermione bursting into the offices of the
Harry lets it go. “So, all we gotta do is find this ‘focal point’ and kill ‘em, and that’s it?”
Draco looked over at him just then as they came to the next intersection and stepped out of the shadows the row of buildings cast across the pavement, and for a moment Harry was so distracted by the way the setting sun made Draco’s hair glow rosegold that he nearly missed Draco asking, “I know what?”
“Charlie, this is my boyfriend, Draco,” Potter says.
“Of course you’re not looking at it from his point of view,” Malfoy said, and Hermione looked outraged for a split second before Malfoy finished, “To see anything from Babcock’s point of view, you’d have to stick your head entirely up his arse, and frankly I don’t see how there’d be room for you along with the enormous stick he’s got shoved up there, to say nothing of his overblown sense of self-importance and his delusions of grandeur.”
Yet, she trusted me with them. I was lucky. So lucky to be trusted by her in such a way. She showed me every side of her and let me learn every little secret gesture. After knowing her, I was able to see more in the actions of others. Yes, she was loud and assertive and confident. But she had worries. Had moments when that confidence fluttered. And she shared those things with me. She allowed me to see that side of her and so I learned to pick it up in her when no one else could. You know why?”
“Want me to set that on the table?”
Draco could just barely make out his own reflection in the transfigured frames Potter wore. He wondered if his own eyes were as deeply lined with shadows and fatigue. Probably.
Draco huffed, ready to continue their argument when Harry turned and began undressing, shucking off his shirt to reveal toned muscles and a few old scars lining his richly tanned skin. Draco’s mouth hung open in shock, obviously shock, shock at Potter’s rudeness and he did not run but turned and left at an appropriate pace when Potter began unbuttoning his trousers.
“But-”
“Er, yes. Of course sir.”
Before he could even finish the thought Potter had shoved him back, hands clasped on Dracos shoulders as his back made contact with another nearby pile of boxes. Just out of view of the charm.
Malfoy was full of surprises today it seemed as he suggested with a sigh, “I don’t know, pet names?”
“Okay.”
“Yes, well it’s our job. I’m sorry we had to lie to you.”
She gestured to the side to a simple full length mirror that hadn't been their moments before. Harry watched the man reflected there raise his brows in surprise as he did. He raised his hand and so did the reflex stranger. He moved closer to the mirror and squinted at his scarless forehead. It was certainly strange.
"Wha-" He swallowed a sudden lump of emotion in his throat, "What's this?"
“Okay, now that’s the third time your face has gone all sour at the mention of our partners. Spill, what’d you two get into a row?”
Something was off with Potter today, Draco noticed. They were touring venues and Potter had been distracted the first two places. When he didn't return from the "bathroom" Draco began to worry in earnest. "Bathroom" was their crude but effective code for Draco to distract the host while he scanned the place. It had been too long since Potter had left so Draco made his best attempt at charming the host before setting off to recover his wayward partner.
"Draco!"
“It’s just,” she shook her head, “I don’t want to have to live in fear anymore. I accepted who I am a long time ago; I just can’t understand how people can hate people like us so much. And over what? Love? So, yes I’m terrified. But it won’t stop me from loving her. From marrying her. She’d half of my heart and soul and no one can take that from us. It sucks how careful we  have to be in our planning and in public about our relationship. I don’t want to hide this. To hide her, you know?”
The resolution
“Is he alright?” Beth asked quietly and Draco nearly jumped in his seat at the question but rushed to reassure her,
"Yes."
“I get that.”
“Well we should know how to unerase them! The aurors should be more prepared, we should have better tracking spells, better-”
Harry cleared his throat and said, “Yeah, a list. That’s good.”
They were, needless to say, politely escorted out by the rather flustered host just minutes later. Even Potter flushed red at their host's parting joke of, "Save some for the wedding!"
Harry’s brows knitted together, “Sir?”
Potter finally set down the creamer and quirked a brow in response, “A rule list? Really?”
“Ink!” he muttered, puzzling it out. Victim 4 seemed to have never even gotten the chance to fight back as the first three had. No evidence of physical blows - only cursework. And victim 4 was the only one without ink smudged on their person. Sure, they were wizards and used ink but-
Harry tried to regain his composure, “Interview her? Already?”
Malfoy, though it was hard to put his name to his new face, moved to stand next to him at the mirror, gingerly touching his new golden curls. Although the narrow glare he gave Harry when he caught him looking was 100% Malfoy.
Potter let out a sigh that sounded like he'd been holding his breath and replied, "Alright. Just-" he hesitated, shifting where he sat, "you- if you want to talk, I'm here Draco."
Harry nodded and said his goodbyes a bit dazed, thinking on the older man’s words. That confirmed for him that there had to be some similarities in the cursework used on the victims. Pieces of spells. He’d known new spells could be made, of course; Harry recalled the “Half-Blood Prince’s” potions book, Snape had created new spells while a student even. Taking apart spells to rearrange them by pieces and create something altogether new.
He shouldn’t- couldn’t- be thinking so much about this. They have a killer to catch. Someone who had already hurt people Draco had come to care for even if just a bit. He’d messed up enough already. He couldn't afford to keep going down the path his thoughts and the ache in his chest tugged at him too take. It was inescapable, the feelings he’d carried for so long, but he hadn’t ever wished them away so much as he did now.
“I still can’t believe you’re calling Malfoy that.” Ron scoffed.
He could practically hear the eye roll in Potters voice despite his back being turned, “Oh don’t sound so pleased you might strain something.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was entering the cafe before he even made a decision to. The cafe’s warmth washed away the chill he’d begun to feel numb to outside, it covered him like a blanket and the scent of fresh baked goods had him relaxing for the first time since the day before. He approached the counter and ordered his usual from one of the local girls Beth had hired. The exchange was friendly and informal and Draco’s thoughts turned back to the cafe’s owners as he found a table. It had been a week since their visit to Anne’s hospital room and he debated stopping in for a visit instead of heading back to the apartment for lunch. But just as the thought formed a familiar voice interrupted his musings, followed shortly by the woman herself flopping down into the chair across from his,
The Unspeakable grinned at him before walking in a circle around him to check over his new appearance, speaking as she went,
Draco's voice brought Harry back down to earth. He was waiting for a reply. So Harry gave him one; dropping to his knees as well he cupped the other man's cheek in his free hand and simply said,
Harry opened his mouth to answer but didn’t really know what to say, yet malfoy cut him off again anyway,
“Ronan Carpenter,” Draco stated.
Draco didn’t know how to respond to that. To Potter laughing and smiling and it being directed at him. Then Potter just had to go and say, “Checkmate.”
Draco rolled his eyes and Harry pressed on, “So, what does this change? Er- What I mean is I know I want more than casual but I mean what you want is important too and I’m not really sure how this changes things between us and if you want to be exclusive and-”
Harry sighed and scratched the back of his neck, “Look, I’m a smart dressing apprentice wandmaker and you are a french novelist. We moved here for my new job. We’re old friends that fell in love. And we only have to be in love when people are watching, no one is asking us to do anything but work together and share this apartment without killing each other. I’m willing to try if you are. So,” Harry held out his hand, “agree not to kill each other in our sleep and act like a couple when we need to?”
Ollivander chuckled, “You seemed a bit lost. Take it from someone with a lifetime of experience - and a lifetime of regrets - whatever it is your pondering, we tend to regret most the actions not taken more so than even the ones that don’t end in our favor.”
“You okay?”
Draco was not blushing as he thanked her again and watched her and Potter exchange polite waves before she turned and began to hobble the short walk back to her own apartment. Closing the door softly he set the bag on the counter to finally get a look inside. Potter smiled at the contents, peering over Draco’s shoulder. He let out a warm laugh that tickled Draco’s neck in a way that definitely did not make him flush.
“So, hand holding and friday date nights. What else?”
Draco thinks it might be him.
Malfoy turned with a small start and glared at him, “Eavesdroping, Potter? You really have no manners.”
“Give him some space Ronald.”
Settling in for the long haul...
“I’ve got you.” Draco whispered in a voice heavy from sleep and perhaps something else, expression gentler than any Harry had ever seen on him before. Safe and warm. Comforted by the contact Harry drifted back to sleep.
And the sun has started to sink in the sky, along with the horrible feeling in Draco’s stomach.
“Harry,” Draco interrupted his blabbering, “I want all those things too.”
When he spoke again it was in his usual solemn rumble,
Potter’s eyes looked unimpressed and vivid green behind those not so ridiculous transfigured glasses, saying drily, “Yes, Malfoy. What about it though?”
“Look,” Potter cleared his throat and met Draco’s eyes with his own deep green, “I know you’re still mad. And believe me I’m still irritated with the way you’ve handled things-”
“Reservations?” Harry asked.
If Harry grinned any more his cheeks would start to ache, but just as the though crossed his mind Draco’s expression fell and in a worried rush Harry asked, “You okay?”
Two hour later they faced off on what had been declared the final deciding match of the evening. Potter, it turned out, was as infuriatingly capable at wizard chess as everything else. Draco only held the lead by one match. If potter won this they’d be even. Ridiculous, he’d asked every discreet inquiry he could to get the other man talking too and had little success information gathering. Honestly Draco didn’t even really care anymore if it wasn’t related to the case. Or winning this match. How did Potter get so good at chess!
Letting out an audible sigh but without a word to Potter he deftly avoided the mess of files on the floor and left the cabinet office to stalk toward his room. He needed a shower to gather his thoughts. Perhaps Potter would just go to sleep already and he’d be refreshed enough to work a little longer afterward. Yet, fifteen minutes later as he left the bedroom there was Potter - awake, half heartedly flipping through what looked like a quidditch magazine., “Shower free then?”
“Some other time then? We’ll have to have a double date.” Anne offered kindly and Draco nodded in agreement.
With nothing else to do and still slightly wary and confused by Potter’s non-reaction, he retreated into the cabinet office to start the short reports on each shop they’d investigated that day. Not that there was much to write, though he put the names of the two shops with rude employees up on the chalkboard. It was better than nothing. He looked over the area map they’d brought with them and marked tried to find connections between the places the three murders had taken place. And where the attempt on Reele had been made. But there were no connections he could see other than that it gave them the killer’s comfort zone. Draco didn’t have to look at the photos to recall the details anymore. He’d been at the last two scenes when the photos were taken. The blood on the walls reminiscent of what happened in his second year at Hogwarts, except instead of cryptic proclamations this psychos message was clear. The pureblood and homophobic messages written in the victims blood and the way he mangled the corpses made his skin crawl and his stomach roil even upon recollection. He never wanted to see that happen to another person again. He had to find out who was doing this.
Harry’s blood is boiling, which is funny since he’s not sure his heart ever started beating again. He can only look Malfoy over in fury, checking he wasn’t injured because Malfoy would lie about something like that and call it keeping it to himself. As if that's different. Malfoy protested when Harry moved around him to check him over like a healer, lifting his arms and circling him but Harry didn’t care. He had to be sure he wasn’t injured. That he was okay. Malfoy was sputtering in indignation when Harry face him again, “I’m not a child, I’d have said something if I needed healing. Which I don’t, so-”
"Sorry love, practice ran late," Harry gave him an apologetic smile. He'd joined a local quidditch team as well, nothing very competitive just the Hogsmeade local team. He seemed to enjoy it immensely which is the only reason Draco didn't scold him further as he shooed him into their bedroom and told him to shower quickly.
“Ow,” Harry replied yet when Draco made to pull away he just held the other man tighter despite the pain, breathing a sigh of relief,
“Just mind your own business and sod off.”
It was Harry’s turn to let out a breathless laugh, “Absolutely.”
It looked as if Malfoy had filled the journal with sketches, if one could call such beautifully detailed drawings such, and the one he had been so intently focused on was a sketch of Harry. From the glance Harry got before Malfoy realized his presence and jumped up, snapping the journal shut.
“Draco, please. We can’t waste anymore time.”
“Maybe I will. How do I know you haven’t hexed the middle of the bed?”
The witch nodded, red curls bobbing, “Of course. You two are still the primaries on the case; even if you are undercover. Still, It’s best you just get in and out, don’t need to risk anymore exposure than this already does.”
“Malfoy-” Harry began, unsure what he could say but wanting to do something for the other man, who promptly cut him off. His whole demeanor changed in a moment, expression going blank and standing straight backed, but all he said to Harry was, “No.”
If this is a dream he doesn’t ever want to wake. Harry Potter would be lying if he said he’d never considered what it would be like to wake up to Draco Malfoy. He would never have admitted it before but last night had changed things between them. Or he really hoped it had. Harry didn’t know what he’d do if it hadn’t meant as much to Draco as it had to him. He studied the other man now, the sun had barely risen but already morning light was filtering through the windows to cast shadows and sunlight across Draco’s tousled pale hair and creamy skin. His sharp features looked softer in his sleep, as if all pretense had fallen away and Draco could look as soft as Harry knew he truly was. His chest was partially exposed where the covers had ridden down and despite Draco’s reassurances the night before he still felt guilty for being the one to place scars on him. Harry promised himself then that he would do whatever it took to make up for his past actions, even if it took a lifetime.
Harry hands him his cup with a peck on the cheek before returning to the kitchen to put the finishing touches on the meal he'd prepared this morning for their guests arrival. As Draco took a sip of his perfectly made tea he felt again that immense sense of peace fall back over him like a warm blanket across his shoulders on a chilly day. He was happy. And watching Harry rummage through their cabinets, (theirs because this was their home they'd made together and isn't that a thought?) he was overcome with emotion.
“Good morning to you too.”
As they showered and changed, he and Malfoy cleaned up the dinner in silence. Harry was glad everyone had seemed to like it and eager to try the unique spice blend Beth suggested next time he made treacle tart. The women were quick and soon Harry found himself saying goodnight and shutting the bedroom door.
She scanned his face before a cheeky smile settled on her face, “So we’re still on for friday then? Anne and I are excited to finally meet your, Henry. Well that and try his cooking if it’s as good as you gushed about.”
A pie, apple from the smell with “Welcome!” written in crust. Potter turned back to the groceries he’d been unpacking, “We’ll have to get her something as thanks.”
He’s not sure how long it takes him to actually reach Harry’s side and he loses count of the number of healing spells he attempts. At some point the familiar robes of aurors fill his vision and Draco barely registers them. It isn’t until the now familiar voice of the unspeakable witch is  right beside him that he looks up from Harry,
Harry quirked an eyebrow at Malfoy’s hesitation, “What? I think we could manage to convince people we’re friends at least. Besides it’s Henry and Damien who met in Paris and became friends after all. We can’t act like us, the history is different. It’s not like anyone is asking you to actually be friends with me, Malfoy.”
“Truce, remember? Just trust me. For tonight.”
Malfoy had been avoiding him for days. Well, more than usual at least. He went out at odd hours. They only ever interacted for the briefest amounts of time and on Malfoy’s part with mostly one word answers. No longer did they share meals or engage in chess matches. Even when they did have to actually speak to each other to discuss the case Malfoy was tense and colder than ever. Harry was becoming beyond frustrated. He almost missed Malfoy’s snide comments on his wardrobe choices; Malfoy hadn’t even commented this morning when Harry’d come out wearing one polka dot snitch sock and another rainbow striped sock. This had gotten serious, then. Malfoy’s sudden reversal back into the days of ignoring him after they’d settled into a comfortable routine bugged him more than he wanted to admit, even to himself. The old coldshoulder now felt somehow worse. More personal.
This smile draco was able to return in amusement, “Sounds like someone can’t practice what she preaches.”
Breaking out of his dour thoughts Harry leans forward to place a gentle kiss on the other man’s forehead.
Beth gave her fiancee a playful smack and reprimand, “What are you doing here anyway, love?”
His mind ran over their every interaction the past few months. He dismissed the moments they spent undercover. It wasn’t so easy to discard the moments they didn’t have to pretend. All the times they’d reached out for one another in comfort. All the times Harry had brought him his tea, just the way he liked and teased him for his bitter taste. He re-evaluated every look he could remember Harry threw his way. Every way in which they’d grown closer. How he seemed to be able to tell from a nod or a tilt of his head what Draco was thinking. How he’d felt he had begun to understand those things from Harry as well.
