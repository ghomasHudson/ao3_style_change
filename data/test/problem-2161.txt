Malfoy took a step closer to him, then another. “I’ve never been anyone’s victim.”
It wasn’t rational, this nausea. Malfoy’s Patronus shouldn’t even matter. Why should it matter? Harry didn’t care, except he kept thinking of it. He kept thinking of it and then jerking back from the thought, like a curious finger from a hot cooker. Why did the thought of Malfoy’s Patronus make him feel hot and cold and like he wanted to hurry out of his own skin?
Taking out his wand again, Harry banished the broken dishes, then cleaned up the food with spells as best he could.  Then he went into the kitchen, made another sandwich, and poured another glass of milk.
“Yes.  I was.”
“But what if—”
“His feelings for you humiliate you?”
“At least my mother is alive,” Malfoy said, lifting his chin.
Draco raised a brow.  “Verbally spar?”
Harry nodded. This was something Harry rather liked about Yin—they didn’t really remember everything all the time. Talking to Yin was like talking to a friend who really wanted to keep up with you, but didn’t take notes on you or treat you like a pop quiz. “Higgledy Piggledy didn’t mind Mark—you could pass him off as magical, since he was just one bloke, but you get enough non-mags together . . . we didn’t want trouble.”
“Left where?” Harry asked, beginning to feel worried.
Harry paused, waiting to see if that meant no.
“What fell apart?”
Draco always did that, avoiding questions.  Harry stayed put.  “What’s a Death Eater?”
The door opened. Malfoy slipped inside, and the distraction was enough to cause Harry to glance at the clock. They had two minutes until end of class. “All right,” Harry said, “dismissed. This has been a good discussion; we’ll work on the practicum on Wednesday.”
that aspect of who I am. I didn’t choose it, so it didn’t feel like—it didn’t feel like that didn’t make him ‘the one.’”
Malfoy scowled, his hands down by his sides.  It made the robe—
“Correction,” Malfoy said, whipping a leather lace through its tiny grommet, then beginning on the next tie. “My father can cast an excellent Patronus. It’s a swan. A magnificent swan.”
an Auror?”
“Can I come in?”
“Why isn’t it working?  Malfoy Manor!”  Crawling out of the hearth, Draco grabbed the whole pot of Floo powder from the chimney piece.  His fistful lit up the whole lab this time, the green flames making a bursting sound before licking happily at the sides of the stone hearth.  Draco climbed in again.  “Malfoy Manor.  Where’s my house?  Malfoy Manor!  Goyle Park!”
“Right.” Yin was nodding. “I read about it in the papers.”
“I listen to Rose!”
“I don’t know!” Harry said, the words spilling out of him.  “I’m sorry!  I didn’t ask.  You were hurting, and I wanted—and after that, you wouldn’t . . . we didn’t . . . you didn’t want to talk to me about it.  You didn’t want to talk to me at all.”
Harry waited for Malfoy to realize he’d just called Lily stupid, but Malfoy didn’t seem to notice.
“But . . .
Pushing down his other emotions, Harry tried to keep his voice level.  “It’s close to supper-time.  You should eat something.”
“Why don’t you ask Malfoy?”
“Then don’t let me forget!”
Harry took a step away.  “You can do it, Malfoy,” he said.  “You always can.  You’re so good at this.”
“Is that right?” Robards asked Malfoy. “Are you his?”
Mister Malfoy looked annoyed again.  “Heavens, Potter, I’m not going to . . .”  The stick slid out and pointed at Harry.  “
Draco put his head over the side again.  “But what does it say?”
“I won’t do anything,” Draco said, detecting his advantage.  “I’ll be a bystander.  Bystanders are allowed.  I just want to see.  I promise.”
Then Draco was moving out from under him, and Harry felt the loss of him, but he had to keep sucking on the dildo. Be a good slut for it. Give it what it needs.
“Cool?  Potter, are you six?”
Leaning in, Draco kissed Harry’s forehead after all; then his lips moved to Harry’s ear.  “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
“I still think I would’ve talked to the alpaca,” said Ron.
“Mine changed to match yours.  Not the other way around.”
“Cake, Harry!” Mister Malfoy announced.  “It means cake.”
“I don’t know, Harry,” Draco said, seeming very interested in his scroll-thing all the sudden.  “Where were you going last night when I left the room to get that Cure-All?”
Harry waited to see what Draco would do, but Draco just stood up, using his wand to clear the lunch things.  “What do you think of that?” Draco asked as he began the washing up.  “Would you like to get outside for a bit?”
“Who says?” Malfoy demanded.
“Are you returning to the Auror Force?” asked one reporter.
“Right,” Harry agreed.  “But they seem to be moulding you into who they want you to be, rather than who you want to be.”
“Then what am I?” Malfoy asked.
“She told me Uncle Draco was eleven,” said Teddy.
“Tomorrow morning,” Draco said, “but take your gross salad with you.”
Harry glanced back at Ron, who had been apprised of everything—the meetings for Teddy’s Order, Savage’s distrust of the Order, voiced in the first faculty meeting of the year and reiterated at every opportunity. “I wouldn’t put it past members of the Board to disapprove of Teddy’s Order as well,” Harry said.
Heloise made a soft noise of contentment, and delighted, Draco glanced up at Harry to see whether he’d noticed Draco’s success.
“Of course,” Andromeda said, her tone cheerful.
pushed a little voice in Harry’s mind.
“I always thought that maybe if I could shag a bloke—just one; it didn’t matter whom—then maybe I could get it out of my system.”  Draco was speaking slowly, his words very measured.  “I wouldn’t want to do it any longer, and I could be what my parents wanted.  I think we both know it doesn’t work that way.”
“Too late! I’d already changed, when I joined the Academy! I’d already—I wanted to become an Auror so you would—I—I renounced my past; I defended Reveal; I thought it would be enough for you to—to—to
“Excellent,” said Greengrass. “Go on and dance with him, if you’re so interested, Potter. Smear your name with his.”
Harry read for a while, until Draco’s finger fell off the page, his head against Harry’s shoulder.  Careful not to wake Draco up, Harry pointed his wand, Levicorpus’ing Draco back up to the top bunk.
“Yes.  You—you’re still friends with them now.”
“Yes, you can,” Malfoy said quietly. “You’re Harry Potter. You could crush me under your big toe, and no one would care.”
25 years
Draco stared down at him.  After a long moment he spoke, his voice soft.  “I want you to remember.”
Another silence.
“I wasn’t sure if you’d remember.”
“Sorry,” Harry whispered, then applied the rest of the salve.  “Can I . . . ?” he began.  “I want to bandage you.”
“They’re fine,” Harry said quickly. “Pay attention.”
“Reveal is a risk,” Harry said. “We can all agree about that. But don’t give me this shite about pure-blood ‘way of life’. If you don’t think there are pure-bloods out there who want to destroy the current administration any way they can, you’re being wilfully ignorant.”
A hard shudder wracked through Harry at these words. No one had ever talked to him like this before, and the arousal in his groin throbbed without the magic of Draco’s wand, thick and pulsing in his hot cock, making him too aware of the wet emptiness of his arse. Draco was going to fuck it again. He’d just fucked it, and he was going to fuck it again. “Yeah,” Harry said. “Okay,” and he got on his hands and knees.
“About Astoria?” Harry scowled. “He thinks it’s
“Why not?” asked Astoria, with interest.
“Like what?”
“And how are you?” Kavika asked, once Harry was settled in his chair.
, Harry wanted to say. Malfoy had told him he wanted to be an Auror because his father didn’t want him to.
“No, Malfoy. What did you mean?”
more discreet?  About—about following the Dark Lord, about what he thinks about Mud—why couldn’t he have just . . . ?”
“Yes.”
“Shit,” said Ron.
“It’s the same old story,” said Povey, another instructor. “Over and over and over again. Do we have to have this argument every time?”
“I’m also mortal, difficult as that might be to believe. I can’t make pastry of gods.”
“We’re not talking about ancient history,” said Penelope, whose voice was always surprisingly strident coming from her slight frame. After having trained to become an Auror, she had been in the field ten years before deciding to become an instructor at the Academy. “We’re talking about Draco Malfoy’s application to the Academy. I think it’s absurd.”
“Today is Sunday,” Draco said.  “There will be fewer people there and so less of a chance of being questioned.  Besides,” he added, sounding a trifle defensive.  “I was hoping if I could narrow down the ingredients for the original potion, I wouldn’t have to find the brewer to make a cure.  But now we’re down to that last ingredient, and I’ve no idea what it is.  It’s got to be something I’ve never seen before, some kind of powerful magical substance . . .” He frowned, no longer worrying the placemat but looking so unhappy.  “I don’t think I can make the cure without it.”
“What?”
“But,” Harry said again.  “Isn’t—um.  Shagging blokes—part of what makes you comfortable?”
“I’d really like to say that Draco’s and my pure-blood upbringing was useful for something,” Nyala said, “but I don’t want to, because the pure-blood upbringing had aspirations of genocide. But he does dance really pretty.”
“I think that went rather well,” Malfoy said brightly, after the echo of Shacklebolt’s Apparition finally faded away. He was standing with his hands in his pockets, looking quite at ease, as though nothing significant had happened. “What’s a Ward Bore?”
“You’ve always hated me,” Harry reminded him.  “You wanted to turn me over to Voldemort.”
. For a while, Harry had thought he had understood. After all, he had Hermione and Ron.
Draco didn’t say anything.
“Sorry,” Harry said, stuffing the handkerchief into his pocket.
“You’re much younger, for one thing.”
“I told you.” Trying to be reassuring, Harry set the ledger down on the side table.  “You’re very clever.”
“Where are you going?” Draco demanded immediately, following him.
“I’ve been working on the de-ageing potion,” Draco said.
“Right, but we could. And for patients with certain kinds of conditions, I do. What do they think, then?” Yin leaned forward. Today they were wearing a very intense suit, made from perhaps fifty shades of velvet. At least three quills and a biro were sticking out of their messy bun. “About Reveal?”
Harry separated his hands. “Let me see your arm.”
Harry didn’t know why he couldn’t just ignore him. “I haven’t had time to weed.”
He could go to Ron and Hermione, obviously. They were getting precious little sleep these days, with Hermione in the Council, and Ron dealing with the pressure on the Force. He shouldn’t bother them—though he was allowed to bother them. They would want him to bother them. They had made that clear; they had given him the locket. Harry touched it. He didn’t want to bother them.
When Harry looked at the picture, however, he saw a dour old woman frowning mightily at the camera, then turning to snap at someone outside of the frame.  Swallowing hard, Harry tried to think of something nice to say.  “She looks . . . very nice.”
“I didn’t mean . . .”  Releasing a breath, Harry gave it up.  Malfoy had always been impossible.  “You know what?  Never mind.”
” Looking at Harry, Draco broke off, and turned an even deeper shade.  “I just meant . . . I was talking about people in our year.”
“For stress,” Harry said.
“Why are you always on about Malfoy?” Charlie had wanted to know. “Rune Photsi is
“Now?”  Harry yawned.
“Then can I do magic?”
Eager to get back to the papers, Harry eventually found a parchment about a case that seemed promising.  It involved a warehouse, and Cecil Vance was the Auror who had made the arrest described in the report.  All of it seemed fairly innocuous, which was probably why Draco hadn’t made note of it the first time they had visited Number Twelve and looked at all the files, but since Vance had attacked them, maybe Draco had thought the warehouse was worth checking out.
“Am I really a wizard?”
The second storey had some more musty bedrooms with a bathroom between them, and Draco stopped there to pick up some hairs from the drain of the sink.  “What are you doing?” Harry asked.
“Some of them,” Draco conceded.  “Have you ever played chess?  I believe I’ve heard of a Muggle variation.”
A Floo turned out to be the hearth, which served as a magical transportation device.  Draco said most wizards and witches kept Floo powder on their chimney pieces.  Finding old-Harry’s, Draco took a pinch from the pot and threw it in the fire, which turned green.  When they stepped inside it, it wasn’t hot at all, and Draco said, “Tailored Tinctures.”  This whooshed them from the hearth in Number Twelve to one of the hearths in Draco’s laboratory.
“Harry!”  Draco fell to his knees, and then he was touching Harry’s shoulders, his hair, his hands, his chest.  “Are you okay?”
Savage went pale.  “I shouldn’t be surprised,” she’d said, after a moment.  “Should have known all Vance’s sticking-to-protocol bullshit was just to cover something up.”
Harry laughed.
“I’ll tell you what,” Draco said.  “If when you grow up you’d still like to be friends with me, I’ll agree to it.”
“Get on the bed.”
Bennet argued Proudfoot had other solutions—a graduated unObliviate, so non-mags would slowly remember pieces of the Wizarding World they had already seen. Astoria said Proudfoot was a spineless worm who would never get them a Deal, and now they were back to the beginning, with some of the table saying change needed to come about through the Ministry, and others saying that change needed to happen in the streets.
“Agreed,” Malfoy said instantly. “In fact, you probably shouldn’t even be seen with me.”
me on the force so I can
“I might disrupt your class,” Malfoy went on. “I’m disruptive.”
“Really?”  Malfoy’s interest seemed perked.  “Who is it?”
The first time Harry saw Malfoy after the trials was two weeks after Harry became an Auror, and it happened because the Auror Department didn’t have a lab with people who did potions research.  Instead it had a little room called Records and Filing, where an old man called Kirkley Zidwidley would look up the origin of an old spell if you asked nicely (and loudly).
“Old hair, precisely.”  Draco’s lips twitched into a smile.  “These are hairs from your older self, which can help me determine how old to make you when we fix it.  Don’t worry, Harry,” Draco added, apparently seeing Harry’s disgusted expression.  “I’m just taking them as a precaution; we may not need them.”
“Right, of course,” Draco said quickly.  But then he looked into the fire and didn’t say anything at all.
“What?” Harry stopped. “No.”
“Are you going to tell me what we did?”  If Harry hadn’t been in Draco’s body, he would have pushed up his glasses again.
“Oh, not to worry.” Teddy quirked a brow. “You’re never awkward.”
“Yeah, well—send a postcard next time, will you?” Savage said, stomping off.
“What’s too much?” Harry asked, desperate to touch him.
“Am I a builder?”
“Thanks,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “What courses are you most interested in?”
Draco had said that same thing about the fox, but Harry didn’t see why it couldn’t be true.  Tentatively, he petted Heloise’s head again.  She closed her eyes, head pressing down into her neck.  Harry guessed that meant she liked getting petted.
His cock was growing thick. “Yes.”
“You don’t understand,” Draco said.  “You’re perfect.  Everything about you is perfect, and right, and just, and good, and I’m—”
Harry suddenly became aware of his hands. He wanted to fidget but resisted; Teddy knowing about the way that Malfoy felt shouldn’t be embarrassing.
“I don’t think you’re depraved,” Harry said. “I also don’t think porn is depraved.”
“He was afraid of his own Patronus.” Harry waved his hand. “It was a thing. But then he . . . changed, and got a boyfriend, and even if he still . . . I don’t know, thinks of me, I don’t think it’s—it’s not the same anymore.”
“Just a moment, Harry.” Draco let Harry have the beaker but withheld the hair.  “You . . . you’ll see a mark.  On my arm.  It’s—it’s an old tattoo.  Nothing to be concerned about—it won’t hurt you.”
been Imperiused!  It was him!”  Suddenly straightening up, Alby thrust out his hand, pointing at Draco.  “He must have put it in my cabinet when he was working here!  He’s been controlling me the whole time!  He’s nothing but a snivelling conniving—”
“That’s not exactly legal,” Teddy pointed out.
“Yes,” Harry gasped. “Yes, I’d—I’d like it.”
“You’re saying this area isn’t secure?”  Malfoy went a shade paler.  “There aren’t . . . Auror guards?”
“Yes,” said Rune. “I’m thinking about founding a similar company.”
“So, you don’t forbid it,” Harry said.  “You make him put the shelves in an arbitrary order, then claim he misunderstood you and make him do it again.”
Draco looked down at them, Harry’s thick dark cock against Draco’s. Draco’s eyes were huge, his hand moving in their direction almost as though unconsciously, as though helplessly drawn to them.
“The potions accident,” Harry said.  “The potion fell on me; I turned into a ten-year-old.  You told me those things because—you told me it was our in-between birthday, and you made me a cake.  I was the one indulged; I was the one cosseted, because I was alone and neglected, and you were kind.  You cared for me.  Your mum—don’t you know—don’t you know your mum does that because she cares for you?”
“Good,” said Harry.
The kid’s eyes went wide. “How do you know?”
“Potter.”  The man was still holding out the paper and quill.  “I know that you’ve disliked me from the beginning, and apparently that will never change, but I really do think it would be better if you listened to me for once.  That way, I can prove to you what happened to you, so if you would please just write the name of your cousin, we’ll be well on our way.”
“Slate is better,” said Harry.
“You have no idea what kind of situation you’d be putting him into,” Harry said.
At last Draco pulled off, giving Harry’s little kisses along his cock, nestling his nose against the root of him and kissing Harry’s balls, licking at them as they gradually became too sensitive, and then he stopped. He lay the side of his face against Harry’s groin. “Told you I was good.”
“Are you Dudley Dursley?” Mister Malfoy asked politely.
“Of course. If he returned as a trainee?”
—eager and hopeful and a little vulnerable.  Harry hadn’t heard him sound like that in weeks, which for Draco had been years.  This was what Draco sounded like with his defences down, when he was completely open—when he wasn’t hiding or blocking anything, when he was confident enough in what he was doing that he could be himself.
“Pretty sure you were,” Harry said, pulling a piece of parchment and quill towards him.  “I’ve just got to dash out a note.”
Draco shifted in Harry’s arms, nearly of a height with Harry now, turning so that they were face to face.  Draco’s breath was there on Harry’s beard, his big bright eyes looking into Harry’s glasses—and then Draco’s lips were there, clumsily closing over Harry’s.  “No,” Harry said, pushing him away.
Kavika laughed.
Draco glanced up hastily, momentary guilt painting his features. “Harry,” he said, kissing Harry in a rush, as if he knew he was meant to be kissing him and had forgot for a moment.
“Day and a half.”
They were at the desk the quill must have come from now, and Harry wanted to look at it, but he guessed with the woman there, it might look odd for Draco—who wasn’t Harry’s friend—to seem too interested.  The desk was pretty messy, with papers scattered on it, an old coffee cup, three balloons, a bucket labelled ‘kidneys,’ and what looked like a pile of dead moths.  Draco was looking through the papers while the woman stood there looking on.
you?”
“The Order burned to ash!” shouted Savage. “When the Dark Lord fell!”
The pub grew louder behind Harry, then softer, then footsteps. A voice. “You don’t know where he goes either, then.”
“Potter,” Draco said quietly.  “I meant it.  Let me do something on my own, for once.”
“—and Harry’s not going to give Malfoy any poison mead,” Hermione said. “Are you, Harry?”
and then continued the argument.
“That depends,” Mister Malfoy said.  They went through the short hall to the room at the bottom, and Mister Malfoy used his stick to light the lantern hanging from the ceiling.  “What’s a Frankenstein?”
“What do you think about the dream?” asked Yin, which was what Harry had been dreading.
“It’s still our in-between birthday.”
“Are there financial difficulties at the Academy?” asked Stone.
Malfoy went very still.  “Yes,” he hissed.  “That stupid kiss.”
asked, aflutter.
This story was written for buildyourwalls, who donated an incredible sum to charity for it to be written. This story would not exist without her. Buildyourwalls, I'm only sorry it's taken me over two years to complete this monstrosity. Thank you for your patience and your generosity.
“That surprises you?”
“Vinicius and I,” Harry said. “We broke up.”
“Yes.” Harry looked around and found Malfoy, who had lost his broom and was duelling a witch nearby. “Expelliarmus,” Harry told the witch, running toward Malfoy.
April also meant Andromeda’s birthday. Though they usually celebrated at Rombe Pickle, 2019 was Andromeda’s seventieth, and Nyala and Malfoy had conspired to throw her a surprise party. Possibly Teddy had conspired as well, though Teddy was so good at keeping secrets that he hid his contributions not only from Andromeda, but pretty much everyone except Nyala and Malfoy—who was hosting. Nyala had determined that Andromeda was far too keen not to suspect if the party was at Rombe Pickle, and so she had determined that the party should be held somewhere else—somewhere small, with someone close to them, so Andromeda would assume she was only going to a little dinner. Malfoy had volunteered his flat.
Second year.  Harry remembered fighting a basilisk, brewing Polyjuice, attending a party of ghosts.  He remembered meeting Dobby, Dumbledore getting kicked out, Colin Creevey turning to stone.  Harry tried to remember Draco.  There was a Quidditch match, trying to figure out whether Malfoy was Slytherin’s heir.  Draco calling Hermione a Mudblood.
“What happened to the—all the kids turning to stone?  Why—”  Draco turned blazing eyes on Harry.  “Why did
” as he did it.
“I draw my wand on the Hero of the Wizarding World?  That’s what they’re calling you, isn’t it?  Right.  I become daft, is what you’re saying.”
Malfoy put out his chin. “No.”
” Since the door hadn’t quite been closed, the spell banged the door open against the wall. “Yes, I was.”
Harry coughed again, but Vinicius said blithely, “Harry doesn’t think Malfoy’s got fitter since he got gayer. I beg to differ.”
“But why?”
“Er.”  Harry glanced down at the lab bench.  “Maybe we should get to work on this potion.”
her anymore, then maybe I could—then you could be the thing that I could
“I don’t know. I’m his instructor. I’m meant to keep him
“Thanks for coming,” Harry said. Having said what he wanted to say, Harry moved away, but the reporters—as usual—pressed in.
Malfoy had written. “
“But there was a war!” Draco said excitedly.  “People die in wars!  It’s not—it’s not as if it’s
“And I’m still discreet, aren’t I?” Draco breathed.  “No one ever knows.”
“We should drink it in front of a fire,” Harry said.
Harry put down his coffee. He thought he might sick up.
Disappointment curled through Harry, a sadness that settled behind his eyes and pricked at them.  He pulled away.  “Something is in the powder.”
“Why not?”
“You liked him. What did you like?”
“I’m saying—the wizarding world needs Aurors. My parents were Aurors.” Harry tried to think of a way to explain. “The Wizarding World doesn’t have a military. And it’s magic, Teddy. A wizard like Voldemort can find a way to live forever and kill a hundred non-mags instantly. Aurors are meant to stop that.”
“Aunt Petunia must think I’m a house-elf,” Harry said.
“What’s that?” said Savage.
“Draco Malfoy is a former Death Eater!” Alby said loudly, coming out from behind Malfoy.  “How dare you defend him against—”
had already reported on his lack of intention to be an Auror. Nyala and Malfoy advanced to Level Two with very little fanfare. Baggot had given Malfoy highest marks.
care about the war!”
Malfoy stopped in the dark foyer, his shoulders stiff.
Harry looked at his arm again.
“I’m . . .”
“More than you realized,” Harry said slowly.
“The wizard who killed your parents lived in that house for two years.  It became an—an evil place, and no one should ever want to go back to it.  For years, not even the grass would grow here.  The flowers are only just starting to return.”
“She points up to Polaris.”  Draco pointed his wand, making one of the stars glow larger for a moment.  “That’s the north star.”
“You can’t get it off?”
Harry realized suddenly.
Draco closed his eyes.  “I’m going to go to sleep now.”
“The human’s life magic would be trapped there. A tree doesn’t lose its mind. It may take on some characteristics of the human life magic it holds, but otherwise, it—”
“Asking for a friend,” Malfoy said, in his light, quick way. “Just for instance, if I bound a plant’s life magic to me, instead of a mark on me, then killed the plant—would that make me live just a little longer?”
“I’ve said I wanted you to call me Harry,” Harry said.  “I like calling you Draco.”
“Are you all right?” she asked.
Harry had cast the reading spell, and the author’s voice wasn’t that bad, but he was wondering if there could be a way to moderate the spell so that the text was read in someone else’s voice.  Harry didn’t have his favourite sofa, so he didn’t have anything better to do than invent a new spell.
painless.  Maybe we need a second opinion.  My mum says always get a second opinion.”
Malfoy hadn’t been talking about Harry holding him back. Not at all. “No,” Harry agreed. “You’re not.”
“Teddy.” Harry stood as well, but Teddy was already heading for the door.
Alby gulped.  “I—could let you in,” he said desperately.  “Auror Vance is involved in it.  All kinds of Aurors are involved!  I could get you a cut.  When they see my shipments come in—if they know it’s for me—they look the other way, and they get a cut!  It’s just the reagents; it’s not the brews—they still come for the brewers; it’s the brewers who are the real—”
31 years
Harry could feel tears pricking behind his eyes and didn’t know why.  He kept on shouting angrily.  “Do you think that nobody would care if
Taking the clothes, Harry went into the bedroom to change.  When he came back out, Draco was sat at the workbench, writing again.
“That’s good,” Harry said. “What memory with your mother?”
Wandering between the lab benches again, Malfoy went on, “I imagine I was drunk if I said anything like that.  I’m an adult, after all; I must drink alcohol.  I suppose that means we go out drinking together—are we very good friends, then?”
“Will you be spending Christmas with Andromeda?” Harry thought to ask, just as he was about to leave.  When Andromeda had mentioned Malfoy visiting, Harry had been thinking about how awkward it might be to have to see Malfoy there when Harry went to visit Teddy.
“I have a question,” Malfoy said, turning away slightly. He didn’t wait for Harry to prompt him. “If killing something can make an object last longer, could you theoretically kill something to make a life last longer?”
“He’s not failing Defensive Flying,” Harry said, hating this, hating every second of this. “Baggot said Malfoy was a fantastic student, and Malfoy’s always been excellent on a broom.”
“I’m . . .”  Harry swallowed again.  There seemed to be a lump in his throat.  “Are you really homeless?”
The next morning, they had cereal again for breakfast.  Harry tried to convey with his reaction to this that he was not nearly as impressed by Andromeda’s breakfasts as he was by Draco’s, but Harry didn’t actually want to be rude to Andromeda, so he wasn’t sure Draco got the message.  Afterwards Draco said they were going back to his shop.
“How so?” Harry demanded. “He stopped a known criminal from—”
Harry looked at Draco’s prone body, feeling for a pulse, putting a hand by Draco’s nose and mouth to try to feel whether he was still breathing.  The pulse was steady, and Harry could feel Draco’s soft breath.  Taking a deep breath of his own, Harry tried to calm himself down.
“And how are we?” she said brightly as Harry sat down in a very sleek chair in front of a very sleek desk, where Doctor Milligan was tapping her wand over again at a long paper on her desk.
“What?”
“But you don’t
“Do you want to discuss it again?”
“Very well.”  Draco was looking at the hills again.  “You always did the right thing, you know,” he said eventually.  “Whether you had an instruction guide or not.”
“Like,” Harry said, because he didn’t know how to win this argument with an eleven-year-old.  Hell, he wasn’t sure he could win it with an adult.  “Does it really matter if you get ahead, if you can’t be yourself?  If you can’t do what you want to do?”
Draco’s eyes shone silver in the dim light.  “We will see,” he said softly.
“I suppose so,” Harry said.  “I don’t know if it’s ever happened.”
Oh God. Warmth pooled in Harry’s gut. If he let himself keep looking, he was going to start thinking about how Malfoy had looked when they had sparred. He was going to start thinking about the warmth of Malfoy’s body as they had danced. He was going to start thinking about fucking him, and he wasn’t going to stop. He was going to kiss him.
“And, if you would care to look at the record, provided by Lee Jordan of RevealRadio, you would know that Draco Malfoy executed a
“Right,” Malfoy agreed. “Because I want to show you.”
Draco’s mouth fell open.  His silver eyes were very bright.
Afterwards, he felt better. It was just a dream. A weird sex dream. Nine months had passed, since Vinicius. Harry had gone plenty longer without. Maybe his body missed him.
He was still too thin, though—thinner than last time, and Harry remembered thinking Draco’s face had looked like a skull, when Harry had seen him at Slug and Jiggers.  Harry didn’t want Draco to look like a skull.  He wanted him to look like a gorgeous happy boy who always got enough to eat and wasn’t afraid to wear his hair down.  With ribbons in it.  Harry wondered if Draco ever did eyeliner.
“Give me my wand,” Draco said, blocking Harry’s way.
“What the outside world is doing?” Spragg turned on her. “It’s what the magical world has always done, isn’t it? Worry about ourselves.”
“It can be a veil,” Teddy was saying in his flat, toneless voice, putting the tulle on his head. “It can be shade. It can be a shroud.”
“I can
Tapping on the ledger with his wand, Harry cast the reading spell.  Draco’s adult voice read him the ingredients and notes all over again, though Harry had to recast it after the first page because he’d stopped listening to the content and had started just listening to the voice.  Draco’s child voice was high and sweet, but Draco’s adult-voice made Harry ache, like Harry was an instrument somehow tuned to respond to the same frequency as Draco’s tenor.  Harry loved it.  He was ashamed of how much he loved it; it was stupid.
“Malfoy?” Harry said, uncomprehendingly.
“It’s nothing!” Dudley called back.
Harry wasn’t sure what he was looking for—maybe cerulean paint.  Maybe cerulean paint disguised to look like indicator solution.  Maybe indicator solution not disguised to look like anything, so Harry could make himself believe that Ron wasn’t in on whatever Savage had been up to—because Ron wasn’t.  He couldn’t be.  Instead, Harry found a pair of diamond earrings.  Two seconds later, Ron found Harry.
“Don’t.”  Malfoy pulled away, his steps puffing up dust.  Drawing his hawthorn wand from his sleeve, he pointed at the broken bottle on the ground.   “
Draco gulped, his chest heaving for breath.  “I’d do it—I’d do it just so you’d know that disgusting as it is, depraved as it is, I’d rather do it with
“Potter,” Malfoy began, then stopped.  He picked up something on the tray.  “This is a topical analgesic.  I can rub it on your throat, so you can—”
“I wasn’t going to say that.”
The next morning, Harry woke in a bed again.  Blinking his eyes open, he reached for his glasses.  When he put them on, he saw a silver fox, which stood up, turned around, and trotted off through a wall.  This time Harry didn’t panic, finding his wand on the bedside table before he began to make the bed.  Perhaps he should ask Draco about that bed-making spell.  It was probably in that book Draco had given him, but Harry hadn’t read the book as he was meant to, and then Draco had made it disappear.  Harry wondered whether Draco would like it if Harry asked for it back.  Then again, he didn’t plan to keep sleeping in Draco’s bed.  He hadn’t meant to sleep on it again this time; he must have fallen asleep and Draco had magicked him into it, as well as into a pair of pyjamas.
“He won’t help you,” Harry said.  “You tormented him for two years.  He’s had seven to think about getting back at you.  You know how smart he is, how creative.  You know what he could do to you.”
The Tiffany lamp on the table cast a magic yellow glow over Kavika’s face, and Harry didn’t want to look at her, her wide mouth, her large, dark eyes. Outside the fire-orange of November leaves stuck to the windowpanes by means of steady rivulets of rain, slowly dripping down to the still. For a while, Harry watched drops trace each other over the glass, sliding like tears over the path of a glass cheek. “I know I’m allowed to be bothered. And angry. I know I’ve been hurt. I know it’s okay not to forgive those who did the hurting. But I just don’t . . . I don’t want to deal with it anymore. I want to move on.”
Malfoy’s eyes were very open, his expression blank. “When did you find out about this?” He hefted the little bottle.
The warm feeling abruptly vanished.  “Don’t use that word.”
“Why do I care about the Malfoy family name?” read the quote from Malfoy, lower on the page. “Anyway, I’m gay.”
“Please.” Malfoy gulped for air. His eyes were wet again. “You should . . . please stop.”
“No, don’t Vow about things like that.  Just—try to do your best.”  Harry looked down for a moment, trying to think about why, when they were children, Draco had seemed so truly awful.  Catching sight of the scar on his hand, Harry ran his thumb over it.
“You failed sigils,” Harry told him, then woke in a cold sweat.
Draco’s lips went even weirder.  “You can have green and silver if you like, Harry.”
“Of course,” the man said, sounding amused.  Harry knew what the man saw: a boy too small and thin for ten-years-old, with over-sized clothes, no shoes, messy hair, a lightning scar, and glasses—though now that Harry thought about it, he didn’t know what the glasses looked like.  Maybe they weren’t broken, for once, which changed the picture somewhat, but even though these clothes were bigger than most, Harry still knew what he probably looked like in them.  Dudley’s hand-me-downs were always way too big as well.  Before he had to start going to St Grogory’s, Harry often hadn’t owned shoes.
"I am NOT a pet," Skoll snapped, slapping the back of his brother's head, "Excuse my brother, he has no manners."
Sirius was at the alter setting everything up, he wanted everything to go right for Narcissa's and Draco's vows.
'Italics'=Parseltongue
“The picture,” Draco stated. He pulled it out of his pocket and held it out to LeFay. He still felt like he was being watched for weakness, stalked, as LeFay watched him and leaned forward to take it. As LeFay took it, inspecting it, Draco looked for any sign of emotion.
Draco squirmed a bit in his seat, he felt antsy for some reason. Maybe it was just being stuck here?
Draco watched him, moving to the side when LeFay got to the last step. He felt a lithe hand reach out pulling him close and holding his jaw close to LeFay’s face.
Harry frowned, his hand going to his head. "What? Father what is that?"
"It's hard to keep myself focused on work when you are around. That is why I didn't want you here. Even after putting the distance between us... I didn't want you to get hurt Draco, especially after what happened? I wasn't confident I wouldn't hurt you while piecing myself together." LeFay watched, hesitant about Draco's response.
LeFay spoke softly, his face placid, “Malfoy.”
Draco sprinted towards it his heart racing again. He started recognizing the song, it was the that poem for his book.
He looked up as Draco drew closer; his hand clenching the arm rest tighter and tighter with every step Draco took. After a moment he found himself looking down as Draco knelt in front of him.
It's just starting to get good. Everyone ready to see what is left of this wreckage?
“Yes, yes I think it will. Or at least help us reverse some of them and boost Draco’s own magical affinity for the moment,” Charlie stated excitedly. “I think it’s going to take all of us to put it on. Harry, get up on the back of his neck right behind his head, that looks like where it will fit best. Bill, Severus, help me lift it after it’s unshrunk.”
"What's happening?" he managed to say.
Sirius relaxed and smiled tentatively at Remus. “That doesn’t seem so bad,” he commented quietly as Dragoon handed him a copy of the results and family tree. “I’ll have to go back through my memories later to see what Albus tampered with, but for now it’s your turn Remus,” Sirius said, flexing his hand to the middle of the room.
Ammit pushed his head out from the blanket cocoon and blinked at him.
“Just don’t move,” Charlie stated. Harry nodded, he could do that, as him and Draco continued their staring contest.
I am the voice that always is calling you
“Kinks?” Harry looked confused.
“That’s not Harry!” she yelled at Sirius as her voice cracked. Theo pulled her into a tight hug, trying to calm her as she started to sob.
"You said-."
Draco nodded, too tired to argue with the Kitsune.
LeFay woke with an unfamiliar weight on his chest, a surge of fear sprinting through his body till he looked down at the other man's sleeping face. A small chuckled rose from his chest as he smiled down at Draco, shaking his head. He'd never thought this was how it was going to end up. He really hoped that Draco didn't end up taking back what he said.
he cried, howling his frustration and grief as his eyes slide from Severus' form to the bed.
"The care of?" Harry rolled his hands, trying to get Severus to finish. Was the old bat having a fit?
"Draco!" Severus yelled again.
Draco froze for a second, slipping on a rock as he was coming in for another attack, eyes wide as he saw Cadmael turn to face him. Claws ripped across his face and he felt a pang of deep pain across his chest as Cadmael fired a spell point blank into his chest. Draco flew back and landed in the dirt hard, crunching croming from his wings as he landed hard on them.
Je remue le ciel le jour, la nuit
The second spear of the day came out with another sickening pop and the black dragon winced. Growling quietly, but didn’t make a move towards Harry. He exhaled the breath he'd been holding and threw the spear to the ground, looking for the next one. The last spear was higher up, right on the dragon’s hip. He looked at the dragon’s face again, swallowing. Taking a deep breath and puffing his chest a little he climbed up the dragon’s back leg to the spear. Harry rubbed his hands together to warm them up before grabbing the spear and tugging. This time it really didn’t want to come out, and when it did it sounding like bones cracking. Harry fell to the ground with a thud as the spear came out and the dragon’s tail came down hard right beside him.
Remus quickly appeared behind Sirius, reaching a hand up to grab his shoulder. “Sirius wait-.”
Cadmael grinned, reaching down and grabbing Draco by his shirt collar and lifting him up off the ground. He sneered in Draco’s face before looking up at LeFay. “You hear that, he admitted all of it. And you’d still choose him over me?! This waste of space that is a smear on the magical creature community that did so much to bring you and our community into the fucking dirt!” Cadmael said hotly as his eyes met LeFay’s.
Harry watched Draco from Ammit’s glass tank, the familiar already wrapped around his shoulders.
"Yea, Neville told us that much before we got up here," Ron huffed, his eyes narrowing in on the creature as it passed by his bed and moved onto the next.
He started making out the words as he drew close; slowing down his pace so he could listen.
"Are you sure about that?" Hati's eyes shone gold for a moment before someone came jogging up to the balcony's entrance.
Draco started at the fox man in front of him in shock. Hearing him say his name had startled him out of his rage and he just sat there. The man hissed at the snake and it hissed back before lowering its body from its striking position. Draco was sure that if the snake had lunged he wouldn’t have been able to free himself. Then it finally clicked as he remembered the earlier conversation. His eyes narrowed. “Harry.”
Tom was going to have a fit.
"It is his choice," LeFay growled, "DO
LeFay stared at him, taking in the startled looking dragon man in front of him. Apparently he didn't know the extent of what his magic really did to Draco, and he felt the sudden pain of guilt when he caught the look of fear in Draco's eyes along with something else. "You do deserve a chance, especially if what you are trying to point out is true," LeFay stated quietly, slowly nodding. "If you really want to peruse this, I won't stop you. Now I need to tend to the other events of
"What, I'm hungry," he said through the mouthful of jello.
Charlie slowly stepped out from behind the rock, creeping around it followed by the rest of the group. The dragon didn’t make a move. Something caught Severus attention however and he stopped, squinting at a pile of rocks a few yards ahead of them.
“It’s a reversal for Draught of Living Death, hopefully it will work. I’m not sure what is causing Draco’s state but if anything, this should work,” Snape stated, scowling slightly. Bill took that as a sign he probably shouldn’t be talking so as not to distract the Potions Master. He turned then to Harry, watching the young lord attend to Draco.
“What exactly have you been doing these past six years. Everyone seems to think you are the new big bad now,” Draco huffed when he finally caught up with LeFay.
“He should have known.”
I wanted to get this up earlier today but here it is anyways!
“Most are from run ins with other creatures," he explained, "They need proof of a strong leader before following them. Of course, that usually only happens with the more feral of them.” LeFay tilted his head, resting his chin in the palm of his hand.
Harry turned and started walking backwards, watching his friends talking. It made him happy. Though, Theo wasn't really his friend, was he? Harry stumbled and then fell on his butt, drawing the attention of Hermione and Luna.
“Well then, I’ll take you to Draco.”
“Bloody hell, what it this collar meant to fit on!” he cried. It was massive, taking up the whole top of the desk with part of it even hanging off the side. There was a knock at the door that startled him and he hurriedly shrunk the collar back down to its original size. “One moment! I’m getting dressed!” he called.
This week had been hell.
Harry’s eyes went wide and he slumped onto the ground, his legs flopping to the sides of his thighs.
“The room is past those guards there. Just head inside and they’ll start. Everyone else is already inside," the goblin spoke and pointed a finger, "The inheritance test will be taken afterwards."
,” Harry spoke softly as he stroked along the spine of the snake. The snake lifted its head from Harry’s arm and faced him, flicking it’s tongue out at him.
Soon enough they were finished and Regulus, Harry, and Ghost made their way down Diagon Alley. They had already stopped at the tailor, and that been interesting to say the least. Regulus looked down at Harry, remembering just how nervous he had been while being measured. It also made him angry when Harry said he was fine in the clothes he had. The boy honestly felt like he didn't deserve them. It made him upset enough that Harry had thought he’d done something, and it took Regulus several minutes to convince him it wasn’t because of something he’d done, but what others had done to him. Ghost had helped by pulling Harry’s attention at the end, but he still couldn’t fathom what Harry had gone through to make him so fragile. If he ever had a chance to meet those muggles, he would destroy them himself. He was sure he wasn’t the only one that felt that way either.
“Did Minerva agree?” he asked as he started up the staircase, stopping on the step below Narcissa's.
They finished the transaction and Kristian gave him the estimated time for their completion before disappearing into the back room with another client. Harry made his way back out, only to run into Sirius.
"Goodnight Ghost," he muttered quietly.
LeFay sat at on the chair he'd been sitting on last night, finishing the breakfast brought to them by the house elves, sipping his tea quietly. Draco was across from him, smiling at something the slytherin had found hilarious apparently. LeFay rolled his eyes, looking back down into his empty tea cup. His eyes hardened in on the pattern in the tea leaves, a frown forming across his face. Sitting at the bottom of his cup was what looked like an owl, and it didn't look like a good one.
“If that were true, then what about all your followers? Are they not monsters?”
Severus looked back at his godson, and nodded his head slowly. "Nagini was in the room with us when you two came in. I didn't know at the time until she was posed to strike me down. You jumped in between and fought her off, however, you took so many bites," he paused to lick his lips, "It would have been impossible to bring you back. Even now you are limited to the form you have until your core fully regenerates."
Draco wakes up, still bound in his animagus body, yet, he doesn't remember how he got the wounds covering his body. Nor does he remember why he is so panicked when Harry is no where in sight.
“We should get him to bed. He’ll be confused when he wakes up, and we’ll need to explain everything to him when he wakes,” Draco said as he squeezed Harry’s shoulder.
"That thing is butt ugly! What's with the quills on it's back?" Ron asked.
When they got to Gringotts it was rather busy. Many stood around with very impatient expression. It would seem the Potter's and Black's weren't the only ones to get letters.

His hands slipped in between then green branches of the bushes as he walked through the maze, and as he drew closer to the end of it he could feel the power radiating from its center. He pulled the collar of the robe around him tighter as a breeze brushed past him, cutting through the thin fabric and onto his naked flesh. Draco understood what he was headed towards but was it really necessary to be dressed in basically nothing? He grumbled quietly before the first wave of magic hit him. He stumbled hard, falling to his knees just as he came to the center of the maze. The garden opened up in front of him in the darkness as wave after wave of uncontrolled magic hit him.
“The Harry we knew wasn’t Harry. It was a molded shell of a wizard Albus cultivated to his liking,” Draco sneered. It dawned on him that even the Harry he'd thought he'd gotten to known wasn't real. Not the golden child, not the happy go lucky one, not the one that had shared banter with him these last months.
LeFay's tails fanned out around him, "You know why you are hear?" Draco nodded slowly as he listened to the slick dark voice emanate from Harry's mouth. As he spoke another figure appeared over LeFay, green eyes filled most of the blackness as Tatsuya's distorted face and ugly maw appeared above Harry. Draco gulped as he looked between the two, both speaking as one, "Then you know what is going to happen."
Severus shook his head.
"You really should think through your questions before asking them. You might ask something you'll regret later," LeFay stated as he went through his wardrobe, browsing for a dress robe to wear to this morning's meeting. Hands snuck around LeFay's waist, and he smirked as his hand moved to the two firmly around his waist now. "You know, you really should get dressed, your clothes are over on the nightstand. I had one of the elves clean them," Harry said as he continued coming through his clothes. There was a firm pull and he sighed as he looked over his shoulder, his gaze meeting completely purple orbs.
Harry’s smile wavered but he nodded, “And I’ll have Ghost!” he said, patting the thick striped hyena’s side.
The voice scoffed at him in his head, and Harry could have sworn he felt it roll its eyes at him.
“You probably need more protection then I do,” he chuckled and then patted Harry’s shoulder. Harry nodded and watched Theo jog off to catch up with Hermione.
“Why?”
“My magic?” Harry asked, confused.
Tatsuya’s silhouette nodded and turned, inspecting the books among the shelves.
Draco stepped forward slowly, watching Harry’s every move, along with the large snake behind him on the bed. He sat down at the coffee table Harry used as a desk then pulled out the paper he had his chosen classes on. Harry seemed to be watching him more than the list of classes, causing Draco to fidget.
“Really Potter?” he growled, embarrassed at the fact he was startled by how close Harry'd gotten.
LeFay grunted and rolled his eyes as he finished organizing the pile he was focused on. "This isn't his business being stuck in this back and forth battle."
This truly was an amazing place, though, he had trouble believing it really existed in his mind. Maybe he could visit here again after he found kitsune. If he ever did find him this is.
LeFay nodded, “We are having a tough time. I feel it’s mostly on my end but, Tatsuya he, well,” LeFay grimaced.
Harry blushed a little before nodding and then took his place in the middle of the room. "Well here goes nothing," he stated.
Everything was silent for a moment as Cadmael got to his feet, his arm clutching his side again as he stepped up to Draco’s prone form on the ground. He spat just to the side of Draco, a small grin across his beast-cat face. It fell slightly, transforming into a look of utter disgust, “Even with how you treated him, he still couldn’t live without you. Do you know how hard it is to get someone with that much trauma to open up to you, only to have someone else shoved in your face day in and day out, just because he feels like he’s the one that abandoned you. LeFay gave you everything, and you gave him nothing,” Cadmael wiped his bloody arm across his face to wipe the sweat away from his eyes.
"Is that what you wish?" came the darkness.
“I’m quite alright. Though I’d advise you not to do it again,” he growled. Harry snickered at the back of the group along with Bill, both smiling like madmen. Remus rolled his eyes and then took in their surroundings.
Finally, he jumped towards the end of the tunnel and into the light, only to feel himself failing. He looked upwards, eyes wide as the light started to fade and everything turned black around him.

“Harry!”
Harry started walking backwards slowly, watching in fascination as the dragon’s wings acted as a third set of legs.
The silence was deafening for the next ten minutes or so as neither said anything to the other. "Well, this is awkward," Tom grunted.
Draco watched him for a long moment before gingerly handing the book over to him. Harry held it in his hands and looked over the cover. Strangely it felt both plush and soft like leather, but rougher.
Tatsuya suggested and smiled.
Tourner Dans Le Vide- Indila
“Yes.” Remus smiled, “For one, you didn’t think they’d let you bring in Ammit without some kind of agreement, did you? He’s far too large just to take him in as a normal pet for your classes. We have to get paper work for him.” Harry shifted in his seat. “Two, we need to get you set up with a private room, for your safety. Sirius, Narcissa, and I have talked it over and we think it would be best if you and Draco roomed together, separate from the normal houses. You would still go to all the classes you had with your respective houses, but it will be safer for you two to stay together,” Remus explained.
There was a low growl echoing in LeFay’s head before Tatsuya looked over his shoulder at the wizard.
Harry looked over the letters before standing up to follow; only to feel extremely light headed when he moved. His eyesight went fuzzy as he leaned on the table for support and waited for the spell to pass. It had been happening frequently lately, and Harry thought it had something to do with his restless sleep. If Dumbledore had lied about Sirius being able to claim the Lordship, then what else did he lie about? Harry frowned as he turned over the thought in his mind and headed to his room. To make up for the missed schooling during the war the Headmistress at Hogwarts was holding an eighth year class that was starting soon. He was nervous, and still trying to settle into living at Black Manor. He'd chosen the attic as his room do, mostly, to the view from the round window. Yet, there were also enchantments on the door and small living area already set up, conveniently for him. Though he didn’t really have anything to take up the vast space. Sirius had at first tried to get Harry to choose a different room but Harry had managed to convince him, with help from Remus, that I little space would be good for him.
“How much time do we have till the meeting with Hisashi?”
“I don’t know, I feel like that was my Dad though. I know you guys loved him, but I don’t want anything I do to affect that part of your memories of him,” Harry stated. Sirius nodded, reaching a hand out to ruffle Harry’s hair.
“Dinner is ready. Master LeFay asks you to come to his study for dinner. He will be there shortly after,” the house elf stood till Draco nodded and then bowed before apparating.
Hisashi looked impressed, “That was very good,” he said with a sly smile.
All Severus could get from Draco's mind where a chaos of images covered in blood, and a mass of arms, something screaming. It was Draco screaming Harry's name over and again. Draco had to find Harry. He didn't know why, he just knew he had to find Harry.
“You didn’t,” he growled.
Harry nodded, “Oh, yes. I have. His name is Ammit.” Ammit bobbed his head and flicked his tongue out on Harry’s cheek. He giggled and push the snake’s head away gently. “Don’t, that tickles,” he laughed. Sirius smirked at them before pulling them into a place they could floo home from. “Why don’t we just apparate?” Harry asked.
“Harry!” Draco yelled, trying to get his attention. His voice sounded so muffled, he could barely hear himself over the ringing in his hears.
“No,” Draco said, coming back up for air.  He sat up on the couch, twisting to face Harry.  “I shan’t ever grow it back, ever.  People like Theo—well, I’m not going to have big muscles; I’m scrawny, and I’m not ever going to tame dragons.  I’ve got to have short hair forever, and I’ve got to wear grey, and I’ve got to—to be
After a long pause, Malfoy’s voice was quick, the words rather sharp.  “Never mind.  I—forget I asked.”
“They don’t,” Harry said, trying to push his magic back.  Now was not the time to have the conversation about how none of the ideas that Dumbledore had were nasty.
He didn’t want to be seen, Harry guessed, and the door swung open.
The way Malfoy said it made Harry finally stop and take notice.  Malfoy was pale, trembling almost—with anger or something else, Harry wasn’t quite sure.  Malfoy’s eyes were bright.  “Malfoy,” Harry said, and stopped.  He had picked a fight, he realized, and it had never really been about Malfoy.
“Good,” Teddy said.  He didn’t tend to be particularly talkative, though Harry had had some experience to prepare him for Draco’s verbosity, since Harry knew Rose Granger-Weasley.
“What can I do?”
“I wasn’t aware you knew each other,” Harry said. “But I suppose Kingsley has friends all over.”
“Thank goodness.” Malfoy pretended to wipe his brow. “The Parkinson dignity is restored. Then again,” Malfoy went on, nicking Parkinson’s drink straight out of her hand, “why is he here?”
Apparently, Malfoy had done some interview in
“Well,
“Draco,” Harry said, putting his head over the side again.
Harry had changed the bunkbeds back into Draco’s original bed, mostly so Harry could see Draco more easily.  He’d also enlarged Draco’s pyjamas, because Draco was meant to be twelve after this first bit, and twelve was larger than eleven.  Harry didn’t know how much larger, because he’d been smaller then as well, so Harry had just guessed.  Draco had seemed to grow into the pyjamas without dying or suffering severe bodily harm, so that was good.  That was great.  Harry made himself breathe.
“Well, you did say that you know lots of things.”
Harry tried to say something, only he felt so miserable he couldn’t form any words.  His throat ached, his mouth tasting awful.  The cool porcelain of the toilet felt nice against his cheek, which he assumed was probably disgusting, but he rested his cheek against it anyway.
Over by the hearth, Mister Malfoy reached for something on the chimney piece, but stopped suddenly.  “Fuck,” he said, low enough that had Harry not been listening closely to everything Mister Malfoy was saying and doing, he might not have heard it.  Turning away, Mister Malfoy just stood there by the chimney piece for a long moment.  When he turned around, he looked awful.  Like Aunt Petunia in the morning before coffee, when she said the neighbours had kept her up all night.
“You said that when I quit the Aurors.” Harry wanted to touch his locket, but he didn’t do it.
“Potter,” Mister Malfoy said irritably.  “You don’t even remember being thirty-one.”
Thanks again to icmezzo and seraphcelene, who helped me get this written.
“So, Snape’s a murderer.”
Malfoy’s voice cut off, and the silver bumblebee disappeared. Standing, Harry grabbed his broom, zoomed out the window, and Apparated as soon as he was past the Pallas Arch.
“He’s okay. Fenrir is here.”
“Still hate me I see, Mister Weasley,” said Fudge, with his silly little ingratiating smile.
Malfoy looked away. “Yes, I’m excellent. I can tend everything myself.”
to sit with you,” Draco said.  “You don’t like me!  And I don’t like you.  I don’t understand why you keep pretending.”
A sound cracked through the room like a strike of lightening. Even the air always seemed to crackle a bit with the scent of electricity in the wake of Shacklebolt’s Apparition, and he always arrived standing ramrod straight, as though appearing in thin air never caused even the smallest jolt. He stood there now, surveying his surroundings with just the movement of his eyes—Robards, Harry, Malfoy, Ron, the other Aurors, standing as though in tableau. Finally, Shacklebolt spoke in the slow, measured boom of a voice. “What seems to be the problem?”
“Teddy was not my best trainee.”
“The shop will be fine,” Draco said.  “I’ll return once we get this sorted.”
“Yes, exactly,” Malfoy said, looking up from the rocks.  “You understand.”
“Yes, well—” Draco’s lips kept twisting.  “I was amusing myself.  But if you really prefer green—I can arrange it.”
“Jesus,” Harry said.  “Are you twelve?”
“Get the oat milk,” Malfoy said.
Then the next person must have stepped up, because the room was bright again, and a dozen or so rats were scurrying about the room.
me,” Draco said, incredulous.
“Spread your legs, Malfoy,” Harry reminded him.

about his mother’s house. “We have it from the
“If the Wizarding World had the will,” Fairchild was saying, “we could find the way.”
“Yeah.” Harry rubbed the back of his hand. “What I meant was—can I add you to the list? Of friends, I mean.”
“It’s just . . .” Alby wrung his hands together.  “Little lord Malfoy is very distracted from his work, you see; he doesn’t get things done—”
“Did you think we couldn’t handle it? Was it because I didn’t make full Auror?”
January term started on a grey and dismal day, and Harry longed for coffee. He had skipped La Reve in hope of arriving early enough to avoid chit-chat with the other instructors, but unfortunately, that meant he was probably also too early for a cup to be waiting on his desk. Harry didn’t like Malfoy doing it in the first place, and he didn’t like how his own expectation of it was becoming habit.
22 years
“What do you think, Instructor Potter?”
M-one.  You’re not going to be a coward about it, are you?  I thought you were in Gryffindor.”
Harry still couldn’t breathe.
Draco glanced at Andromeda.  “If you’re sure.”
“Not really.”
This time, Draco ignored them, sitting stone-faced on the couch.  The fox was sitting beside him on the cushions, looking at Draco intently.  Harry thought about whether he should leave Draco alone, then Draco spoke.  His voice was leaden.  “Who’s flat is this?”
“I want to duplicate the memory,” Draco said, moving Harry’s head with his hands, positioning it. “I want to sell it on Knockturn.” Draco’s cock was lying thickly against Harry’s cheek, now. “I want everyone to see their precious Hero of the Wizarding World, with cock on his face, taking it and loving it.” Draco began to thrust, rutting into his face just as he’d promised.
“And your calling me Harry,” Harry went on.  “I don’t want you to call me Potter if I get old.”
Draco sat across from him, barely making any noise.  When Harry glanced over, though, Draco had a scone for himself and some berries.  At least Draco was eating, even if he wasn’t sleeping.  Because he was trying to cure Harry.  Embarrassed and upset all over again, Harry took a swig of the orange juice, then tucked in to the bacon.
“You did make different choices,” Ron said. “You came out on the other side.”
“Here,” Harry said, turning from him to rummage on the desk. “I brought this for you.” Turning back to Malfoy, Harry held out a bottle of liquid.
“Oh.” Harry pointed his wand, directing the coffee pot over to the table, directing it to pour more coffee, then turning it toward Teddy.
a pure-blood party. He’s only here on some business of father’s.”
“It can be . . . a spider web!” shouted a kid.
Draco had put the glasses on and was using them to look at Harry’s dark-coloured wand, but at Harry’s question he quickly slipped it away into his sleeve.  “It should,” Draco seemed to hesitate again, then added, “You’ve used it before.”
“That’s pushing it.”
Malfoy flinched. “I’m sorry we can’t all master Dark Arts at young ages and faff about killing Dark Lords when we were seventeen.”
The indicator solution was in fact cerulean paint.  Nothing else about the paint other than the illusion was magical; it would not have any effect on anything, other than painting things cerulean.  But that meant that anyone being tested for Wood-Eye Lye could look as though they had tested positive, since their thumbs would definitely change colour in the paint.  That meant that countless true testimonies under Veritaserum could have been made to look like lies, and that meant Ludville had been telling the truth about Vance.  For some reason, Savage had used the paint to make it look like Ludville had been lying.
“This scar,” Draco said, bringing Harry’s hand up.  Draco looked down at the raised bumps for a moment, then back up at Harry.  “She gave it to you?”
“That powder is powerful.”  Malfoy looked down at the little bottle of pink.  “It’s powerful, and it’s dangerous.  In the wrong hands, it could make anyone do anything.  It could make them a slave.  We were lucky you got most the powder off you; only the molecular residue was affecting me.”  He looked up.  “I had no control over my actions.  You know I wouldn’t have done it otherwise.  It meant nothing.”
“I think I know what you’re going to say,” Malfoy went on.
, which was an absurdly slow-paced book about the intricate politics of fish-people, mermaids, and pirates.  There were lots of details and descriptions and names, such that even if Harry hadn’t had dyslexia he’d probably have trouble reading it, except Draco had whizzed through it at
to this institution.”
“I have to go, though,” Harry said. “Talk later, yeah?”
“What is it, Harry?” asked Kingsley Shacklebolt, his expression serious and warm.
“That wasn’t what I was going to say.”
bed, and—Harry looked furtively at the rumpled sheets.  He hadn’t really done a good job making it.  He hoped Draco didn’t notice.  “And . . . these?”  He plucked at the pyjamas.
Harry finally realized Draco was trying not to smile.  “What’s so funny?”
”  A little puddle of chocolate sucked up into his wand.
“Oh,” Draco said.  “Right.”
Malfoy did that less these days. He still did it. The coffee was always good, always hot, always how Harry liked it, even though sometimes Malfoy tried different things—a sprinkle of nutmeg, a little vanilla. Once, the distinct taste of chocolate. It was nice.
“Fine.” Picking up his wand again, Malfoy cast untying spells on the remaining laces, then finally hurried out of the wizard robe to shirtsleeves and trousers beneath. “Are you happy?”
Kavika smiled a little. “Well, it’s definitely true that no Malfoy wants to disappoint Malfoy Manor.”
“—if you have any question about him, or my time in school, you’re obviously more interested in becoming a historian than an Auror. I’ll talk to the Board and have you removed from my classes. You lot are onto Instructor Baggot, now,” Harry said, turning away. “Have a nice day.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said.
Harry gave them a rueful smile. “I always say it’s between me and my therapist.”
“I don’t suppose there is,” Draco said.  “Would you . . . ”  He trailed off.  “You’d cry a lot, I expect.”
“Draco,” Harry said, relieved.
“Here follows descriptions of each remedy:
“What’s accidental magic?” Harry asked, sitting down but not drinking the milk.
“Draco,” Harry began, but Draco was already climbing down the side of the bunk bed, which didn’t have a ladder.
“I see,” said Duggins, scribbling.
“Are you still okay?”
“What . . .”  Pity wasn’t quite right for what shone in Mister Malfoy’s eyes.  Maybe he thought it was funny.  “What did you want to build?”
Shacklebolt only gave Robards a slow blink, gaze slicing next to Harry.
“Oh,” Harry said, but then didn’t know what to call him.
Kavika was silent for a moment, in her still, steady way, and Harry found himself wanting reassurance, wanting someone who was not a friend from Hogwarts, not someone who had known Malfoy, to agree that this situation was unfair, that it was ridiculous. “I think that you have a kind heart,” Kavika said at last, “for pitying one who was so cruel to you.”
“Why do we always need to argue?” Povey asked. “Why can’t we just handle this like any other issue of discipline?”
“Which you’ll never see,” Harry continued for Adebayo, “because if you don’t pass boggarts, you won’t pass Level One.”
and—and I was a Zabini.”
Harry was careful not to change expressions.  “I think your hair would look very nice with ribbons,” was all he said.
“He didn’t actually . . .” Shifting his weight, Harry rubbed his hand some more.
“No.”
Ludville had been taken to Azkaban for holding to await her trial.  When Harry went to the prison, however, he found that Ludville had been transferred.  “Who signed the order?” Harry asked, afraid that he already knew.  Only a few people were authorized to transfer prisoners out of Azkaban.
“It’s different,” Harry said.  “It’s different when I know you’re teasing, when you never say things that will really hurt me.”
“—doesn’t mean I’m a little pure-blood puppet. Maybe, just
Draco rolled his eyes.  “I’m destitute, Potter, not craven.  The point is, I would.  Her safety and her comfort are more important than that she be proud of me.  Once I’ve got that sorted, though, she’ll want to think I’ve got a proper life—as much as I can as a shop-keep—so I’ll keep my hair cut and not fuck boys, and that will be that.”
“You didn’t try asking me.” Harry wrote down a few more notes—
“You don’t remember the things about you that I remember about you,” Harry said at last.  “We’re not—on the same footing.  It’s not right.”
Standing up, Harry picked up his shot of Firewhiskey and poured it down the sink.  Coming back to the table, he picked up the phial of the Wood-Eye Lye and drank the rest of it.
Draco hadn’t lied, not really.  He just hadn’t said everything, and Harry wondered how many things he was missing because Draco thought he wouldn’t understand.  “It’s okay,” Harry heard himself say.
.”  Turning back, Mister Malfoy waved his stick.
“I’m always open to talking about dead cats.” Teddy waited a while, and then without inflection, said, “I guess you meant the school.”
“I haven’t kept in touch,” Luna said.
“No,” Harry said.  “He isn’t.”
“That was a simple chokehold,” Harry told the class. “Thanks for helping demonstrate.” Harry turned to Achar and Fuentes, who were working near the front. “Achar, can you pair up with Malfoy? Fuentes, you can demo our next hold.”
“I made the books go off.”  Harry looked up at him.  “You said it was anxiety.”
“Harry.”  Andromeda started to come over to him, and Harry jerked away.
“But you didn’t,” Malfoy said. “They didn’t—I—you failed me.”
“What do you expect me to do?”
Blinking, Sibanyoni put down his Coke. “Tell you what,” he began, then picked up his Coke. He put it down again. “Tell you what,” he said again, “I’ve got the perfect exercise, can’t be beat. Absolutely your cuppa, just what you’re looking for. Her name is Marie Leblanc. Old colleague of mine, more your style.”
“But he hasn’t changed,” Harry said. “That’s the whole point.”
“No. Just, what’s the use of talking?”
a Death Eater, after all, and you know how devious they are.”
“I don’t have names.”
“Why didn’t the fox spell work?”
For a moment, Harry couldn’t even remember what he’d said. He’d thought he’d just agreed with Draco, but then he realized what it was. I grow quite weak for praise, Draco had said, just a few days ago. He’d been two years younger, then. “Do you want me to praise you, Draco?” Harry said, his lips moving against Draco’s neck.
“Congrats, Malfoy.” Ron put out his hand. “Only took you three years.”
Harry looked down at himself. “Well, if you’re going to take forever, I’ve places to be.”
“Right, but it . . . well.” Harry his fingers over the scar on his hand, wishing for the blocks again. “I, er. May have scared them a little.” He looked at her with chagrin. “Or a lot. They’re all—they hold their breaths whenever I call on Malfoy in class. Or when he says anything. Or if I say his name.”
when she loved you and was concerned about you and wanted reassurances that you were okay, but Harry wasn’t okay. He just wasn’t okay.
“How did this one end?”
Malfoy, the woman, and the army all decided, en masse, to swarm the table Harry sat at with Teddy and Nyala. “You made it,” Teddy said. He hadn’t cheered, but his mouth had ticked up when Malfoy had shown up at the door. From Teddy, this was practically a bear hug.
“Not always. Not always. Depths. They’re deep for a reason. The hidden part, the inner self. The sanctuary.” Sibanyoni took a sip of Diet Coke. “Do you protect it?”
“Your teeth were flashing different colours,” Harry said, because that had actually happened last year.
Malfoy scowled at him, looking spiky.  “I’m not allowed to use magic,” he bit out.  “All I have is potions.”  He seemed to be saying this to Harry more than Mrs. Mulpepper, but Mrs. Mulpepper was the one who responded.
“Do you need me there?” Harry asked.
“Saving the world and puppies,” Harry said, but Malfoy just looked confused, and Harry realized Malfoy hadn’t remembered that conversation from the alley outside Mr. Mulpepper’s.  Of course he hadn’t; it hadn’t been a special conversation, and Harry only remembered it because—“I’m sorry anyway,” Harry said, just to make himself stop thinking.  “You should eat more.”
The brilliant light spilling from the veranda only just illuminated the tightening muscle beside Travers’s mouth.
“I thought you weren’t a poof.”
As it turned out, Harry needn’t have been worried.
“I’ll tell you what.”  Mister Malfoy sounded more amused than ever.  “If I can’t fix the de-ageing potion, you can stay in the cupboard all you like.  How does that sound?”
Harry felt a little chagrined. “This is the part where I say I died, and I watched my friends get tortured, and I tracked criminals for years, and more than once witnessed a non-mag sacrifice because fringe-purists still think blood magic is a thing.”
“Well,” Draco said, sounding unsettled.  “Of course, she cares for me.  She’s my mum.  You turned ten?”
Even if it didn’t taste like a cake, Harry sort of wanted some.  He was pretty hungry, and he’d only had half of his hot chocolate.
“Is there anything I can do?” Teddy asked, and he was nineteen. Teddy was nineteen, and Kavika was in Beirut.
Harry looked around the room—at Savage, Spragg, and Penelope, who were all red-faced and furious, at Baggot, who looked like he wanted to be anywhere else, at Povey, who looked like he thought he was in charge. “I do have a position,” Harry said, his words coming slowly. “If this institution does anything to get in the way of Theodore Lupin’s Order, I quit.”
“And witches shall rule the world,” Kavika agreed.
Harry shrugged. “School friends can disagree.”
“No,” Harry said. “I meant—I meant that I don’t
“Want to look at the bookshelves and see if there’s something you like?”
Draco sucked in a breath. “Of course, Harry. Of course, I’ll fuck you. Poor darling. You just need cock, don’t you?”
“Will you come with me, Harry?”
“My mum defeated Voldemort.”
Kavika’s mouth twisted. “How ironic.”
, Harry thought, but he didn’t say it. “Trainee,” he said finally.
Harry rolled his eyes, and though Malfoy seemed suspicious, he gave it to him. “Nice jumper,” Harry commented, pushing up Malfoy’s sleeve.
Colour drained from Draco’s face.  His eyes were very bright, like shining silver in a porcelain mask.
“All right, Harry,” Draco said, his voice deflating the balloon in the gentlest way.  “That’s all right.  Would you like to sit with me?  We can put these papers in proper order.”  Sitting on the ground, Draco laid out the papers in piles.
but you don’t owl me?”
“But mine does.” Malfoy had moved to the laces at his wrists, now. “My parents’ Patronuses match, you see. It represents their love. Their devotion to one another. Devotion resulted in me. Magic is very strong in my family, you know. I think the Dark Lord must have done something to you.”
“If someone was killed for that tree,” Malfoy said, “I would rather not sympathize with it just now.”
Draco looked over at it, surprised, then took out one of the folders and began leafing through it.
“Then I don’t know how to explain it to you.”  Draco massaged his temples for a moment, as though his head ached.
series.  And it’s complete!  Well, of course it’s complete; it’s got to be . . . 2012.”  Draco turned to him eagerly.  “Did King Aegis ever defeat the warlocks?  And did Maid Faunla ever reveal she was part Veela?”
“Yes, I do!” Draco said.  “They’re not people!  If he was killing them—they—they—they probably deserved it! They’re—they’re—it’s like killing a house-elf!”
“How terrible,” Hermione breathed.
“Do you feel prepared to take this mission?” Shacklebolt asked him.
“And I don’t even get to have therapy.”
“Keep on it, Harry,” Draco whispered, letting go of the dildo. Harry had to grip it now, gripping it so he could suck and work it in his mouth.
“Er.”
, Kavika would say. Merlin, it was embarrassing; it was humiliating; Harry didn’t know why.
Malfoy looked away.
The words reminded Harry so much of something Draco had said when he was older, when Harry was trying to defend Draco against Alby, that Harry was startled.
Harry touched the smooth skin more gently now. “I think you’re brave,” he said, and Malfoy made a little noise, like a protest. “I know he hurt you,” Harry went on. “Not the same way that he hurt me, but he hurt you. In some ways worse. I want you to know—I never wanted him to. Not ever. I never wanted him to hurt anyone, but least of all children, and non-mags, and people who were alone, without anyone to help them. You didn’t deserve to be hurt, Malfoy. Not like that.”
, kept going through Harry’s head, because it was true.  Draco was warped; he had been warped by his parents.  Harry didn’t know how to reconcile the over-emotional child who apparently fell in love with a new boy every year with someone who would laugh at Cedric’s death.
were talking about . . .”  Draco looked so mortified, but he pressed on.  “It was about blokes
Malfoy had bragged.
“At Hogwarts,” Andromeda said.  Turning to the chest of drawers, she said, “I’ll transfigure you pyjamas.”
He never finished, cutting himself off to turn toward the pub, which had grown silent, except for the buzz of the wireless. “—it up,” came a voice from inside, and the volume increased. Slipping out his wand, Malfoy cast a spell, and the voice on the wireless suddenly become audible outside on the pavement.
“And how does that make you feel?”
“It leaves you open to suggestion,” Malfoy said, standing up from the microscope and giving Harry back the bottle of powder.  “It’s got scopolamine in it.”
The table began to dance.  Hot chocolate proceeded to spray everywhere.
Malfoy stomped over to the couch as though it was an extremely arduous journey, then flopped down into it as though exhausted.  “I don’t understand how I could be friends with a Gryffindor,” he said, so dramatically that Harry half expected him to throw a hand over his brow.  “Aren’t they all brutes?”
“We already reviewed the Mind Healers in the UK, early on,” said Kavika.
“Then what good are you?” But Draco didn’t sound as though he meant it.
“When Heloise returns, we’ll visit your cousin,” Mister Malfoy said.  “If you still insist on going home after that, I’ll take you.”
Greyback’s false flag operation. Greyback wanted to make it
“But why?” Harry asked, feeling so gutted.  “I know we have our history, but you know that I—”  He didn’t know how to even say it, the things he felt for Draco, so Harry didn’t try.  “Why can’t you just get over it?”
“Dumbledore was very . . . he didn’t fall in line.  Everyone else always did, around Father; you see, because my father was very important.”
Tailored Tinctures opened on the ground level, where Potage’s Cauldron Shop used to be.  Malfoy put his bedroom down there too, which made the sitting room upstairs twice as big, though Malfoy only seemed to fill it with more books.  Having the bedroom downstairs made sense, Harry supposed, as Malfoy practically lived in the lab that took up the main floor of the shop, but Harry found it inconvenient that the loo was upstairs.
“I’ll bet you do,” Harry said.  “You’re one of the most powerful wizards I know.”
“Potter, what are you talking about?”
“Thanks,” he said, then turned and walked away.
“Um.”  Harry swallowed hard.  “Everywhere.”
“I’m trying to make a conversation.” Harry’s voice was gentle.
“You wish what?” Harry asked, hoping maybe Draco would say something about not being cruel or not being a bigot.
” Harry shouted, tapping the door with his wand, which he had just slid out of his sleeve.  The door popped open, and the driver looked on in shock as Harry slid out of the taxi.  “Come on, you stupid deer!” he called after him.
Harry stopped, but Teddy just kept walking. He’d walk all the way to the village, if Harry let him, then sit on a stile and wait for hours because he assumed Harry just needed to catch up. “When?”
going to say anything or do anything—embarrassing—it would probably be tonight. Tonight was the only evening in which Harry was not an instructor to the trainees, putting them closer to peers.
“Yes. Thank you,” Malfoy said. “Very professorial. Very heroic. Very Potter.”
“I did have to.”
“Why are you still here?” Harry kept his back to him.
“First, stop losing it over Mum.  Second, stop losing it over Harry Potter.”  Draco twisted in his arms to look up at him.  “I was obsessed with you, you know.”
“Are you sure?” Draco wasn’t having any of the tart.  “We can spend more time flying, if you like.”
Harry didn’t know what to do.  When he had cried when he was ten, Draco had held Harry in his arms and made him feel that everything would be okay.  Awkwardly, Harry patted Draco on the back.  “It will grow back,” he offered finally.
“What?” Harry asked, still feeling exhausted.
“And leave him to his own devices?” Smiling, Kavika shook her head. “Disaster.”
“I’ll ask all my friends.” Rather forcefully, Malfoy had shoved a book into the knapsack.
“Oh, your other job.” Ron didn’t seem to think this funny. “Should I have saved you?”
Harry lunged toward it, only just making it to the toilet before he began to sick up.
“Ah.”  Draco set his cup down with a clatter.
Harry wiped his nose.  “How many things do you have on there?”
Unable to stand it any longer, Harry touched him—Teddy’s shoulder, his solid, unhurt shoulder, and then his back, and then Harry was embracing him.
“Oh.”  Harry flipped through the papers, reading the tops of them to try to determine whether they had anything useful.  Most of them seemed to be about spells people should not have done, for one reason or another—you weren’t supposed to do spells in front of Muggles, he gathered, and you weren’t supposed to do magic when you were young.  Harry wondered whether that was what the front of that book Draco had given him had been on about, when it mentioned a decree about underage magic.  None of the papers seemed to be about murders or fires or bombs, which were the sort of things police had to deal with.
“What?” Distracted, Harry turned back to Ron.
Harry swallowed, somehow more uncomfortable now. “I meant Rune Photsi.”
“—practical option for eradicating a purist culture,” Nyala finished saying, then paused, looking about. While Harry could still hear the people at the table, the background noise of the pub had dropped to a dull roar. “I can hear myself think.”
“They’re the people dropping the wards.” Teddy said, scanning the chaos—presumably looking for Fenrir, but people were everywhere, including zooming on brooms overhead. Someone had got into the store of firecrackers in Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, and people in the air and on the ground were narrowly avoiding explosions.
“You know I still have nightmares? About Death Eaters?” Harry said.
“I would’ve done it eighth year, if he’d asked,” Harry said. “I’d get rid of the Dark Mark for anyone who asked.”
“There isn’t a good spell for that,” Harry said, opening the salve and putting his fingers in.  When he reached out to touch one of Draco’s scabs, Draco flinched.  “I’m not going to hurt you.”
“I better come down there and help you.”
“It’s really good,” Draco said.
instructor.”
“Where?” said Mark, who often kept things practical. “I don’t think many people would appreciate having pamphlets flown into their window by owls.”
“Obviously, not everyone,” Hermione said hastily. “I meant—Revealers, anti-purists. My voters, essentially. How do I convince them we need all of it? We need the Ministry; we need the Aurors, and we need the activists on the outside who will always push us to be more, to be better.”
Knowing that didn’t change the fact that if Draco was just trying to do the right thing, that meant Harry at this age was the wrong thing.  Meanwhile Harry had never been so happy or felt so good, which made being the wrong thing that much more depressing.  And then he’d gone and yelled at Draco for it and ruined everything.
Draco was going on, “I always thought that—that I could stop.  But I never could.  And now . . . she’s in hospital, and I just . . . she’s not even going to know, if I’m careful, if people don’t find out.  I thought—if I was discreet enough—” Harry winced—“I could make her be happy, and I could have what I need as well.”
“I know that one,” Harry said.  “We learned about it in school.”
“I meant—besides that.”
“Just freshening spells.”  Draco took Harry’s glasses, focusing on folding them and putting them aside as he said.  “My mum used to do it for me.  As you can imagine, she had to do them—rather frequently.”
“No. I’m—” Harry felt his throat close. “I just wanted to make sure you’re all right.”
“Like my house?” Harry asked, feeling much better about the whole thing.
“Being who you are isn’t selfish.”
“Oh.” Harry swallowed.
Duggins scribbled notes on his pad, so Harry waited. The office was drab, like Robards office in the Auror Department, a non-descript room with a non-descript desk, non-descript chairs, non-descript degrees framed on the wall from non-descript magical universities, even though there were only sixteen in the whole world. There were no windows.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, trying to think of something to say.  “You’re an excellent potions consultant.”
“Oh, really?” Draco said, his voice dry.
Without hesitating, Malfoy took it, turning over the bottle in his hands.
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Sure,” Teddy said again. “Maybe I want to.”
“I have my own wand,” Harry pointed out.
“I didn’t do it,” Malfoy said quickly.
“I heard
“I’m not friends with anyone you’re friends with. Even Astoria’s sunk in everyone’s estimation, since she’s marrying you. I hope you know that.”
“Obviously not,” Harry said.
Rune’s expressive features melted into something soft. “This, I can understand.”
The fight at the Department of Mysteries.  Lucius Malfoy had just been sent to Azkaban.  Absolutely nothing Harry could say would make this any better.
“I’m saying, we need to be careful,” said Hermione. “If people break the Statute willy-nilly, it makes the Deal that much harder. It’s already hard enough as it is.”
“You said I could crush you,” Harry said, his voice still soft. “Last year, when we had this same conversation. You said I could crush you, and no one would care. Now you’re going on about all this power I have—”
; that was what was happening.
“How’s the Deal going?” Harry asked.
“No big deal.” Malfoy sniffed. “We don’t have to talk about it. Shall we throw ourselves on the mercy of the Force?”
Harry was getting angry, now.  “Aren’t you at least going to tell me where he went?”
“Yes,” Penelope said, then turned to Savage and Spragg, her voice growing louder. “The Board is meeting now. Can’t you two wait until we have a better understanding of the situation? We don’t even know exactly what
But Draco was already poring over a new book with wood etchings on the covers and did not respond.
“No,” Harry croaked.  “I’m sorry.  Draco—I’m so sorry.”
“Don’t tell me,” Malfoy said.  “I prefer not to know.”
“I promise I shan’t.”  Smiling drily, Draco took the cards and shuffled.
“Throwing a party at your flat,” Andromeda was telling him. “I would never have predicted! Why haven’t you invited us before?”
Harry thought about the Timothy Tree, its roots steeped deep in the wizarding world of blood hatred and purism. He thought of Draco Malfoy, who had sat under that tree, talked to it, come to know it, then destroyed it using the skills that he had learned, studying under its very leaves. The Academy was not a place where you learned the real history of the magical world, where you learned to protect not only your own worlds but the other worlds, the worlds that were not your own, the worlds that were different from you and frightening because they were unknown.
“Oh, no, I keep it on for fun. It’s excellent for parlour conversation.”
“That’s what I say,” Malfoy said warmly.
“I suppose I was rather advanced for my age.”
“Of what?” she wanted to know.
Malfoy’s boggart wasn’t Voldemort.
can feel however you want.  I expect—well.”  Looking considerably more satisfied with every moment that passed, he went on, “Well, I’m going to grow up to be discreet.  That’s what Father says.  Discreet means you never let anyone know what you’re thinking.”
“What happens to your soul, if you Apparate?” asked a tall woman, who had apparently read enough of the pamphlet to call Apparition by its name.
people hurting each other and killing each other over ideology that’s—over any ideology! I want to stop people killing each other, and hating each other, and—and being cruel! You think that’s what Death Eaters
This was not at all how this was meant to go. Malfoy was a
“Fuck,” Harry said, pulling away. His voice was ragged. “I like you. I like you so much.”
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Come off it, Malfoy.  You wouldn’t question me while I was on Veritaserum.”
“This will work better with someone of your own age.  Perhaps when we visit your cousin, if you’re still concerned about it, he can tell your uncle where you are.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “People are jealous of me. They can’t help it.
Without Ron and Hermione, Harry would not have been here to make any choices at all.
“I was trying,” Harry said. “You beat me fair and square.”
Malfoy blush. “Of course,” Harry said, turning away, despising himself just a little.
“But I’m going to disappoint
“Yes.”
“It’s understandable that you’re worried about him.”
Harry reached out his hand, and Draco flinched away.  “I’m not going to hurt you,” Harry said, then put his hand on Draco’s shoulder.  “Eat your breakfast,” Harry said, squeezing, then letting his hand fall away.  He moved to push past, but Draco caught Harry’s hand.
“I’m not sure that’s what it means.”
“Who?”
They sent the owl off, and Draco followed Harry back to the bench with the Life Water on it.  Thinking how terrible it would be if the bottle broke, Harry thought of something else for Draco to do.  “These are instructions your older self left for me,” Harry said, handing Draco the ledger.
“I’m, er . . .”  Harry grabbed the parchment the elder Draco had left on the table, desperately hoping it might tell him what to do.  Temporary—Draco had said this would be temporary; this was just like Malfoy, not telling him what would really happen.
Harry’s brows went up. “Is that why you’re doing it?”
“But I don’t want to talk about you
Malfoy turned away.  “Don’t bother me anymore.  I was remodelling.”
“The Ministry for Magic.”
Harry didn’t know what “ascribe motives” meant either.  “Anyway, when you said you thought the land would like it if people were here having fun on it, I’m not so sure the land would like it if one of them was having fun by cheating.”
“You’d better go first, Harry,” Draco said, letting go his hand.
“I’m not going to quit,” said Harry. “I’m staying, because I will fight you. I will fight you until I see every last one of you—Lionel, Pius, Bernard—removed from these seats and replaced by people with the dignity and decency these offices deserve.”
“He must be named,” said Baggot.
“Yes,” Harry said, letting go of Malfoy’s hand and moving back.  “You did.”
“Just sit down, Potter,” Malfoy said, sounding as annoyed as Harry felt.  “I’ll try to find out what’s wrong.”
“Oh.”  Harry thought about that.  “Because he was a very brave man?”
“I . . . don’t know exactly,” Draco said, frowning.  A frown on old-Harry’s face looked fierce, but it didn’t bother Harry as much anymore.  “I’ll have to go through those papers.  Would you like lunch?” he added, moving toward the stairs.
“Of course, you did,” Penelope said. “No one’s ever done as much as you. You saved the world.”
“You are!  I—you could
“That’s not . . .” Draco began, then waved away the cloud.  “It’s a very difficult spell,” he said.  “You have to be feeling just right for it to come out correctly.”
They used to do that, sort of.
“Charms are prohibited,” said the Bulstrode witch.
This explained the worried look on Ron’s face, so Harry turned back into the other direction, back toward the wall where the punch bowl was, where there was a better view of the whole room. Would Rune have told Malfoy he was coming? Running into exes unexpectedly was always awkward, but Malfoy would have had no way to prepare for it. He would have thought Rune still in Thailand. Wouldn’t he have? Had they remained in touch? How broken-hearted had Malfoy been, when Rune had broken up with him?
Dobby?”
Malfoy went, and Harry closed the door.  Jesus.  He was going to have such a fucking headache over this.
I want to move on,” Harry said, his voice suddenly louder. “I want to
Harry took his glasses off, and for the first time, he could see without them.  The palms of his hands were long and elegant, nothing at all like old-him’s square ones, and the fingers were tapered, nails well-trimmed.  Reaching his hand up, Harry checked his hair.  It was silky and fine, just like Draco’s hair looked, not at all coarse.  Harry ran his hand over his face just to make sure he was not wearing glasses, marvelling at how easy it was to see everything without them.
“Ooooh,” Mrs. Mulpepper said, beginning to look excited that Harry Potter was in her shop, now that she was done with crying.  “But don’t you need potions?  Plenty of potions for your Auror work?  A Confusing Concoction for your enemies!  A Sprinkle Spray to get away!”
“I seem to remember Slytherin losing several important Quidditch matches,” Greengrass mused.

meetings?” said Fudge.
The door opened, and someone came in.  Harry knew it was Mister Malfoy, but he felt too ill to look up, not to mentioned embarrassed.  Even if Mister Malfoy wasn’t angry at him for sicking up, he was going to think Harry was an idiot for having made himself ill, and he’d be right.  Harry didn’t even know why he’d done it, only the food had been so good, and no one had taken it away.
, Dumbledore had said on that Tower, but his was not the voice that Harry heard. Instead he heard Charity Burbage, because she was right above them, and her last words had been the same.
Andromeda, Harry, and Teddy always spent Christmas at Old Wob with the Granger-Weasleys, then New Years at the Burrow with everyone alive, and some people who were dead. After the hols, Teddy went back to Hogwarts, Hermione and Ron went back to work, and Harry had another week to kill before the term started at Academy. That left Harry alone in Pecket Well, just outside of Cambridge. The cottage was an old wizarding house in an old wizarding town, and he always thought he liked it until he had to stay in it.
this is a joke, right?  You’re playing jokes?  This is a joke,” Draco said frantically, beginning to pace about.  “It’s all a joke; you’re going to Pensieve it for all your friends; you’re going to laugh at me for believing that I would—well, I
“Seems like the least you could do,” Harry pointed out.  “You tried to kill my best friend, got two of my favourite professors killed, and always called my other best friend bigoted slurs.  And she got tortured at your house, so it seems like salad isn’t that big of a deal, in the scheme of things.”
Outside, the branches of the Timothy Tree could not be seen, so thick were they with green. Under it stood the stone bench, weathered and worn by students and time. Each autumn, its leaves fell. Each winter, it stood naked. Each spring, it began the process of growing new leaves again, and Harry wondered whether it was worth the effort. Beginning again, over and over, the same cycle year after year—did a tree ever grow tired? Did it ever simply want to stop?
Draco took the pillow off his face.  “Are you saying we still become friends?”
Harry put his hand on Heloise and Apparated.
had ever been an Auror of course, even though their whole purpose was to support the Academy, which trained Aurors. People who worked in law enforcement or for the Ministry could never make enough money to serve in such an illustrious body. Meanwhile, the pure-blood families who had so many Galleons that their professions didn’t matter would never busy themselves with such manual labour.
“Come see me after class,” Harry added. “Maybe you can help me when we get to April.”
“Fuck,” Harry muttered, making himself go back to Draco’s buttons. He had to get his shirt open. He had to see him, because Draco was so beautiful and Harry wanted to touch him; he wanted to touch him all over.
Harry didn’t know what to say.
“It’s not important right now, Potter.”
“Which begs the question,” Angelina had said, turning to face him, “why were
Harry huffed a laugh. “But
boy looking like a girl.
“We keep each other’s secrets.”  Draco nodded once, sharply.  “I thought as much.”
“Rune Photsi.” Nyala waved a hand vaguely. “Dancing with Vinicius.”
“This is just one ingredient,” Draco said, “and it’s one I thought was probably in it anyway.”
Harry frowned. “I didn’t mean I couldn’t do it without him. I was fine before he—” Harry didn’t quite know how to label what Malfoy had done, during last year’s orientation. “I was fine. The orientation was like . . . it was like it was before.”
“I said just lick,” Draco said. “Don’t suck it until I tell you too. Nice little pretty kitten licks, Harry, like it’s a nice lolly for you. Okay?”
“Well?” Malfoy said.
Draco pulled away.  “You see, Harry?”  Draco’s thigh was between Harry’s and Harry wasn’t even sure how it got that way.  Draco’s mouth nibbled up the length of Harry’s jaw, along his beard.  “I’m so good at snogging,” he whispered in Harry’s ear.  “You’ll never want anyone else again.  Isn’t that right?  Do you like it, Harry?”
It all went downhill from there.
Harry struggled for air but couldn’t think why.  They’d been pinched through that cold black three times already.  It had never hurt him before, but now he felt like his lungs were burning, because Dudley—
“No,” said Harry. “Death Eaters dropped the wards. Fenrir Greyback. You would know that if you had spoken to any Aurors at all before you called this meeting.”
Harry looked up from his schedule. “I should think making me fall off my broom third year gives you all the happy memories you need.”
“Is that—what you’re—doing? Making me—a—slut?” Harry spread his legs; the angle wasn’t as good with Draco leaning over him like this. When he was horizontal and someone was perpendicular they could really drill into his arse, really drill him like he needed to be drilled. Still, the way Draco was draped over him now made him feel pinned, which he also liked, and Harry almost felt as though he was there to get fucked, like Draco could do what he wanted to him, and Harry had to take it. It was a good feeling.
“Have you ever met her?” Harry asked curiously.
“Er.” Harry crossed his arms, then uncrossed them. When he started to rub his fingers over the scar on his hand, he stopped. “The same. It hasn’t changed.”
Harry didn’t particularly fancy getting hugged again, but Draco was really messed up or sad or whatever, and anyway Harry had meant what he had said.  He didn’t want Draco thinking he didn’t care, just because Draco had done something bad, or lots of bad things.  Whatever, it didn’t matter, because Draco was a good person.  The best person, really, and even though Harry was pretty certain Draco was crying on him, being hugged wasn’t the worst thing ever.
“LeFay? I thought that line died out decades ago?” Draco stated as the stopped by his mother’s room and dropped off her trunk.
he asked. Ammit flicked his tongue a few times and hummed.
“Please show Master Draco to the rooms he and his mother will be using.” Kreacher nodded.
“We miss him,” Harry stated softy. Tatsuya was quiet for a moment before nodding.
Harry bit his lip, thinking for a moment. He remembered the angry hissing and guessed that a dragon probably wouldn’t make that noise, so Parvati must be a snake of some sort. Sirius looked over at Harry for a moment before turning his attention back to Minerva. “Do to the fact that you and Remus are comfortable with the Forbidden Forest, you will help Charlie and Bill. Snape will provide any potions that the five of you will need, and accompany you in case you need any others,” Minerva paused to make sure everyone was following along, “I must also inform you all that you may find more than just a dragon out there. There have been reports as close as Hogsmead of former Death Eaters attacking people, and with the influx of creature inheritances there are also a number of bounty hunters that aren’t against killing to get there pay.”
“I’m here for my parents’ will reading. James and Lily Potter, as well as an inheritance test,” Harry told the goblin. The goblin was quiet for a moment as he shuffled through various papers and folder.
Harry felt really sick now and wrapped his arms around his stomach. Snape glared holes into Bill’s head. “What? It’s the truth. I don’t know why you two are so upset about it, I mean look at you two. You guys honestly couldn’t have scored anything better. Especially with the workmanship in that collar!” Bill continued. Charlie hit him over the head and berated him on his manners. Harry closed his eyes, breathing deep and slow as he felt his magic teetering on the edge of blowing.
Draco smirked to himself, it was as good as a time as ever to explore the Lord's private quarters. LeFay wasn't paying attention, and would probably be at it for a while.
Minerva sighed, “I honestly couldn’t tell you why. I would like to say it was because of the war, but he had changed them before you-know-who was even born.” She pinched the bridge of her nose. Minerva was absolutely exhausted, and in between hiring new teachers for the positions Albus had removed, reading over all of the Founders notes and rules, and then also having to deal with replacing all of the books Albus had declared too dark for anyone to read; she had no time to take care of the simple things. “I believed Albus was doing this all for the good of wizarding kind, but now…,” she shook her head. “Anyways, the two of you will need to send in you chosen classes asap.”
Draco wrapped his arms around LeFay's neck, kissing it gently as he felt Harry lift him off his feet.
Draco couldn’t help but stare at LeFay as the man smiled darkly.
Normally he felt claustrophobic in tight spaces, but somehow here he felt pleasantly at ease within the trees. It wasn’t as dark or as damp as the Dark Forest, and everywhere he looked there seemed to be green. He turned to look back the way he came, only to see trees behind him. Harry felt panic build a little before he closed his eyes to calm himself. “It wouldn’t matter if it was still there anyways,” he mumbled to himself before slicking back his hair. That’s when he noticed that he didn’t have his ears, and, eyes wide, he reached around to find his tails weren’t there either. “Strange,” he said as he looked down at his feet. He wiggled his toes, feeling the soft ground under them. If felt weird; he'd gotten so use to feeling everything through soft pads.
“I never said it was horrible,” Draco said sullenly, not quite looking at him.
to Academy. We already talked about you going, and you decided to go.”
Harry wasn’t sure he could take it—but Draco’s wand was pointed at his own cock, casting that slow stroking spell on himself.
Eyes widening, Harry followed Draco out the door.  The bedroom opened into the laboratory on the ground level, which Harry thought odd, with the kitchen upstairs, but then he thought about the multiple hearths on the ground level.  Maybe things were arranged differently because the flat had a laboratory.  Or maybe magic flats were different.  Going up the stairs, Harry could smell the scent of bacon wafting down, and he tried not to go so fast up the stairs that he bumped into Draco.
“That’s a bit of a long story,” Draco said, “and I’m sure Harry would like to know who you are.  Do you mind if . . . we stay for a while?”
In the evenings, Draco had Harry choose supper.  Harry only chose fish and chips once more.  After that he choose to have mini beef wellingtons like they had had for their first picnic, then curry like they had had for their second picnic.  Draco seemed amused by these choices but made them anyway, and Harry never ate until he got sick again.  Afterwards they did the washing up together.
“He’s a blood supremacist,” Harry said simply. “He won’t tell you he is, but that’s because he lies. He lies about everything. He lied to my face about why one of my trainees wasn’t advancing to Level Two last year, and he knows he can get away with it.”
Yin’s eyes grew even more sympathetic. “Why shouldn’t it? You were hurt. If you broke both your legs, would you blame them if they hurt years after the fact?”
The strange look on Malfoy’s face blossomed.  He lifted his chin a little.  “Well—yes.  I am.”
Harry looked at Malfoy, who was telling the others to get their robes on. Crabbe, Goyle, and Parkinson were all looking at Malfoy with a tinge of awe, and Malfoy looked like he relished the attention. “I think he wasn’t thinking about the reality of doing it,” Harry said. “I think he wanted to impress his friends.”
Harry glanced up at him quickly, but Mister Malfoy didn’t look like he was tricking him, even though Harry was still pretty sure the books had been a bad thing.  But Mister Malfoy didn’t look angry, still wearing that gentle expression.  Turning away, Mister Malfoy waved at a different cabinet. “
Harry heard himself moan.
“No.” Harry shook his head. “He
“Just,” Harry began again. “Whenever I think of . . . the dream, it’s not him I’m thinking of. It’s the person he
Harry lips felt dry.  His whole mouth suddenly felt dry, and he pulled his lower lip between his teeth to wet it.  “Uh,” he finally said, intelligently.  “Tops at potions?”
“But I thought—I thought you were
“Because that’s all I wanted to do—pass my classes. Become an Auror.” Looking thoughtful, Malfoy trailed off. He put his head to one side. “Have you ever wanted to do anything good before? Of course you have. Look at you. I never did,” Malfoy went on. “I wanted to be an Auror because my father didn’t want me to. And it sounded nice, you know. Being heroic. Proving that I was better than y—than they thought. Perhaps I had . . .” His gaze flicked over Harry. “Personal reasons. But it wasn’t because I wanted to be good. Not really.”
“Then when you said—uh.”  Harry had to stop, because now Draco’s was
“I know,” Harry said.  “We do.”
Draco’s head jerked up.  “We don’t?”
The other two didn’t work either.
Possibly Malfoy deserved to be embarrassed; he’d spent a decent percentage of his life trying to embarrass Harry. Harry still pitied him.
“Yes.” Harry writhed on the bed. “Yes, yes, do it. Do it.”
“I don’t think you were.”
In fact, dealing with Malfoy could be almost pleasant.  Without Alby or Mrs. Mulpepper to contend with, their meetings were quite efficient, as Malfoy was a stellar potions consultant.  Sometimes, Harry thought Malfoy was the only person he knew who worked as hard as he did.
Harry’s heart was still squeezing—except now, for some reason, it was also lifting in his chest.  Oh God.  There was no reason he should feel
other things. I just worry . . .”
Harry turned to him. “Teddy adores you.”
“I can forgive you. That’s not why I don’t love you.” Harry felt strangely calm. “You were my bully, Draco.”
communications with the Muggle Prime Minister—”
“Yes. I mean, I could never feel what he . . . Don’t you think it’s embarrassing?”
Still on his broom, Harry drew his wand.
“A drug from the flower of a Central American tree,” Malfoy said.
instructor.”
“Get away from me,” Draco said.  “You’re sick.”
“Would they really keep you from passing this year?” one of them asked.
Draco settled back into Harry’s arms.  “You’ve met me, haven’t you?”
Harry suddenly became aware that he had a cock, and Malfoy—flushed, triumphant—was straddling it.
“It doesn’t feel fine,” Harry said.
“Draco—is the name of a star?” Harry said, guessing what ‘celestial’ meant.
The clothes definitely weren’t his, however, and when Harry looked around he saw he was in a room with a table that had strange equipment on it.  Counters lined the walls, cabinets above them with glass doors.  Broken glass was on the floor in front of him, not far from a tall man with pale hair staring down at him.
“I don’t play fair,” Kavika said, waving her wand to grind the beans, then to move them to the copper pot and boil the water. “Does it surprise you I think he shouldn’t have been admitted? You know my political views.”
“Yes, I would,” Harry said.  “Remember that time he tripped me, and I couldn’t walk for a week?”
“What?” Harry refocused.
“Malfoy, you let that Dementor loose. It almost Kissed five trainees.”
“Malfoy—”
Harry wanted to snap, because he felt impatient. Malfoy had cut him in a thousand ways, when they were young, not to mention that he had been a blade who sliced through everyone else he touched as well—Hermione for her blood, Ron for his family, Hagrid for the sheer front of his existence. But sometimes, in moments like these, Malfoy acted as though forgiving such wounds and adoring the person who had given them were the same thing, and they weren’t. They weren’t. “Of course, I remember,” Harry said, very gently. “You also told me that you’re a knitter.”
“Ah,” Harry cried out, his mouth still stuffed with fake prick.
Malfoy’s primary concentration was for the crowd, and this aside was the light, flippant tone he used when he either didn’t care or wanted to pretend he didn’t care, or maybe was annoyed.
“Old-me told Draco he was the only one I could trust,” Harry piped up, because even if old-him was a prat, at least he’d said that one nice thing.
“You’re punishing Malfoy,” Harry said.
“And you know, they’ll need us more than ever with Reveal.”
“I said I’d tell you,” Harry said.
“That’s for
he had written.
“Are Diagon Business leaders calling for a second referendum?” one of the reporters called out.
“What?” Harry looked at him with a bit of mini-quiche hanging out of his mouth.
“Your mother and father tell you how to act a lot.”
,” Malfoy murmured.  “I would have thought that was a good thing.”
“No,” Draco said slowly.  “If I ever did, however, I am quite certain I would hex her.”
“Yeah, maybe. Maybe we should live in a world without Cornelius Fudge.”
“His Patronus changed. It used to match mine, but . . . and his Boggart changed.”
The problem was, Teddy kept disappearing, and not just to non-mag concerts with Malfoy. Harry didn’t know where Teddy wasn’t going, and he couldn’t conscience following his own godson. If there were people calling themselves Order of the Phoenix, and they were responsible for the ward-drops—Teddy wouldn’t join them. Would he?
Malfoy looked at Harry’s outstretched hand.  He licked his lips.
“Instructor Potter!” Povey called out. “You aren’t going to participate in the discussion?”
“Maybe not,” Draco said.  “But there was meant to be a high point in losing my father and my mother and my home and my friends and everything I ever cared about.  The high point was meant to be getting to snog whomever I want, only I’ve found that’s a bit hard to do when no one wants to snog you back.”
Had Malfoy talked to him? Of course, Harry had heard Malfoy’s voice; Malfoy occasionally spoke to the other trainees, but not very often, and—had Malfoy even addressed him once, since the start of term? He did his work in class. He appeared to pay attention to instruction. He turned in the few written assignments, but there had been nothing—no visits to Harry’s office, no comments after class, or even in it. There hadn’t even been those lingering gazes Malfoy used to give him, which in retrospect, Harry realized had been blatant assessments of his body.
, Draco had said.  Draco had neglected to mention he was one as well.  Harry thought of something then.  “If you don’t get me that number, I might have to do something funny.  Really funny.  To Dudley.”
“Not really,” Malfoy said, “but Teddy’s there.”
Rodolphus shook his head. “I sent him an owl, but somehow it was intercepted by that joke of a Force. They called your Father in for questioning . . . he disavowed me. I thought he might have told you . . . I thought perhaps that’s why you were training to become one of them . . .”
“Hmph,” Savage grunted, turning thoughtful.  “Did you use the indicator solution?  You know Wood-Eye Lye is making the rounds again.”
“Well, that’s bloody fine!” Tears sprang into Malfoy’s eyes, and Harry resisted going to him once again, still uncertain, still unsure. “That’s bloody fine for you!”
“Thanks. Give Teddy my love.” Harry moved away, waiting until Nyala was moving in the opposite direction before he Disapparated, slipping through the cold black of nothing, then appearing on the lawn outside the Pallas Arch.
Yin was focused on putting an entire banana in the blender. “Draco Malfoy? Former Death Eater Auror trainee?”
“What’s sanitized?”
They went downstairs to the lab to look at memories.
,” he said, and the stick rotated in his other hand.  “Stay by me,” he said, beginning to march in the direction the wand pointed and pulling Harry along.
“Do you know how long I’ve dreamed of seeing you like this?” Draco whispered.
“What about the testing?” Harry said, sliding off the stool.
“Thank you, sir.  I—I forgot it again.”
“But I hate salad.”  Draco’s voice was sour, but his eyes were cast down.  “I heard about Professor Lupin.  I—I really liked him.  As a professor.”
“Is that something . . . people can be into?”
“That was because I’d already been affected,” Malfoy said impatiently.  “Once it takes hold of your system, it doesn’t matter if the object of desire washes off the powder; they’ll continue to be an object of desire until the victim is cured.  Therefore, if someone sees a person wearing the powder, the cure has to be tailored to the victim, not to the individual wearing the powder, even after the powder itself is neutralized.”
“Now that part is alleged,” said Penelope.
“We went to school together, didn’t we?”  Malfoy didn’t even wait for an answer.  “Of course, we would know each other.  You’re famous, and I’m—well.  We were friends, then?  I always thought we would be.  Father must be so—well, but you’ll have met my father, wouldn’t you have?  You know how he is.  Anyway, he said I should get to know you.  Were we in the same House?  Did we play Quidditch?”
Draco spanked him again. “Harry.” Draco reached around Harry’s arse, pointing his wand again, drawing up Harry’s dick again, making him hotter and hotter. “Do you think I could make you come, just by spanking you? Do you want me to?”
“Don’t blame him, he swore an oath to protect me. That includes protecting me from people I didn’t know if I could trust,” LeFay said as glanced at Draco from the corner of his eye.
Tatsuya countered. Harry’s eyes brightened with an idea.
“Hey Harry,” came a soft voice. Two people plopped down on the other side of the table as Harry lifted his head. He smiled at both, his ears springing forward as he recognized Luna and Neville.
“Harry would never!” came Hermione’s voice through the crowd.
“Hey! Leave her alone!” Harry yelled as he came out from around the corner and pointed his wand at them. Seamus and Dean both turned around, looking stiff till they realized who it was and then relaxed. The unknown didn’t seem so relaxed and took a step back. Parvati peeked around the two males in front of her before calling out to him.
He made his way there, twisting through the out door paths till he could see the tall bushes peaking out. He was surprised to find the place pretty much abandoned. He’d thought that, with all the people at the LeFay castle, there would be at least a few people milling about here. Shrugging he entered the maze, reaching out his hands to stroke the bushes as he passed. Overall, finding his way to the middle was a pleasant experience, that was until he started to hear voices. He ducked behind the last thick parts of the bushes, crouching low and hoping he hadn’t been spotted at the opening.
“The man that left today. LeFay. He is the real one. I reckon he has a lot of grudges now from being held back all these years. All that he endured while being silenced,” Draco's face fell.
“No, it wasn’t Harry. Not the Harry you all know. That," he sighed, "That was the real Harry LeFay,” Remus said softly.
Harry and Draco both nodded before going to stand, bowing slightly before leaving with the rest of their ‘family.’
“Who are your siblings?”
"Like you said, I already have." Draco leaned in, his mouth finding Harry's as he was flooded with the taste of pine, maple, apple; the world of those that dwell with in the dark and damn space between the darkest of forests. His hand reached up to LeFay's face, sliding through his hair before hooking onto the massive set of antlers. His other hand hooked around LeFay's hips and pulled him tight. "Jariss, he's fighting to break free, would you do the honors?" Draco asked as he pulled away.
The water soaked his clothes chilled him to the bone as he made his way over to the dragon’s head. Harry stood in waist high water, looking over the calm dark scaly head in front of him. Sighing he set his hand next to its eye. “I’m sorry I got you into this mess,” Harry whispered. Stroking the brow ridge he could feel how cold the dragon’s scales where. “I’ll make sure you come back.” Harry nodded firmly, looking up at the sky for a moment.
Hate me
“So you’re having August rework the case?”
“Hey! Hey! Over here!” Harry yelled at it. The Nagas turned with an aggravated hiss before dropping back down onto its belly and making its way towards him. “Yea that’s it,” he mumbled.
Harry remembered when he'd first left and ended up smack dab in the middle of Slytherin Manor. Falling to his knees from the massive magic usage that day six years ago; Winky and Dinky didn’t even ask who he was and how he had gotten there. They just went to work helping him to a couch for rest and food for energy.
This was impossible, everything looked the same here.
“Where am I? Wha-wat happene-,” he cut himself off as he caught sight of something strange by the door. Looking back at him was a fox faced man, with emerald glowing orbs that mirrored his own expression. Both Sirius and Remus became quiet as Harry reached up to touch his face.  Long nails attached to delicate hands caressed the black fur before stroking up the outside of tall smooth fox ears. His ears. Looking down at his hands they looked almost normal, but his nails had grown long like talons and held a green hue.
“He’ll be back to his venomous self in no time. You’ll see,” Bill stated. Harry tried to smile, and nodded his head. Watching Draco like this made his chest hurt, and he couldn’t quite place why. In all honesty, he didn’t even know if they were friends or if Draco had just been acting the part.
Harry sighed as he moved his bag to his shoulder and twisted around on a single paw. “I’m used to it that’s why. I’m used to being targeted in school and outside of school. I thought it might change with Voldemort gone but it hasn’t,” he answered, staring defiantly at Draco now.
He stopped, shaking his head. No, now wasn’t the time for fantasizing, he needed to talk through everything with LeFay, if he could just get him in between tasks maybe.
Vide de sens
Harry sighed, looking down at the wild animal before him. What was he going to do with this thing, he couldn't control it without magic. Groaning Harry made his way over to his bed and flopped down on it face first. "I thought you weren't going to give me trouble," he mumbled into the bed. Draco merrily stopped chewing on the fruit bar and gave the face down wizard a look that said, 'you wish'. He then returned to the bar and continued eating. His ears swiveled like a cat's behind him as he heard Harry adjusting himself on the bed behind him. It didn't take him long to finish off the bar and start wandering around the dorm, sniffing around the other beds.
“N-Nothing, I’m guessing you’re ready to leave?” Sirius asked as he eyed the snake wrapping around his son. Harry nodded and then headed to the front of the store, stroking the snake’s back as Sirius paid for him. As they left the store Sirius looked over at the two, and seeing the affection between them blossoming already made him smile. He was glad Harry had found something that called to him. “Do you know the name of your familiar already by chance?” Sirius asked when he remembered the fact his son was a parselmouth.
“No,” Harry said quickly.  “The Dark Lord didn’t kill her.  She—it was . . .”  But then Harry didn’t know what to say, because the
“Proudfoot needs a revolution too!” the bald girl told Harry, when Malfoy was quite finished. Her voice was raised to be heard over the crowd, but when she went on, Harry still couldn’t hear her.
Colour blossomed again in Malfoy’s cheeks. “Why?”
“I can try.”
sad,” said Hermione.
Draco’s eyes darted to Alby, so Harry looked as well.  Alby’s face, which had been red, had lost its colour, slowly going grey.
“Aren’t you?”  But that was all Andromeda said.  They went on eating.  Afterwards, she had him help with the washing up, but then she allowed him to go back to Teddy’s room, the little fawn trotting dutifully behind him.  When Harry slammed the door on it, it walked through the wood, looking a bit miffed.  Miffed on the baby deer just made it look pitiful.
“Why Harry Potter,” said a voice Harry knew well. “How wonderful to see you again.”
“I haven’t done anything wrong!”  Alby wrung his hands.  “That’s not
Harry gave her his best glare.
Ron lowered his hand, as though he felt more comfortable with his hand by his side, but then remembered there was a sausage roll in it, and brought it back up. “Every time I’ve talked to you this evening, you’re always looking for someone.”
The vote of no confidence, however, failed, fifteen to fourteen—exactly the same margin by which Fudge had won, the Councillors voting along the same lines they had then.
“What else can you do?” Harry asked, feeling pretty excited about this.  Maybe when Mister Malfoy took Harry’s wand away, he could still do some things—not things like knocking books around, just small things.  Nice things that no one would see.
“But grown-up me is a—a—he’s
“Oh.  I see.” Draco sounded troubled.  “Is this . . . what Mother meant?  About people not liking me if . . . if I’m indecorous?”
Harry turned to Malfoy, but Malfoy was just glaring at the floor, his jaw set.
Then the tap came at the window, and Harry opened it.  When Heloise came in, Harry’s heart jumped into his throat and lodged there until he got the note unfolded.  The intervals between Draco’s age-jumps had not been increasing in a mathematically predictable way, not that Harry would be able to calculate it even if they were.  He hadn’t been much better at maths than he had at reading, and then Hogwarts hadn’t taught it anyway.  Draco could be twenty-eight by now, or he could be thirty-two and remember everything.
“George Weasley is good at naming things.”
Yin said it so simply, but Harry felt like a light suddenly turned on in his brain. He wasn’t worried about not taking care of Teddy; he was worried about Teddy not needing to be taken care of. He wanted to be a part of Teddy’s life, and he was. Harry had talked to everyone from Kingsley Shacklebolt to Viktor Krum to help with recruitment efforts, and he was usually at the meetings. Seeing Teddy lead them, however, made him feel just a little superfluous. “When I was at Hogwarts,” Harry said slowly, “no one seemed to be addressing things I thought were wrong. It’s why I started the DA. Er—that’s Dumbledore’s Army.”
“You need them,” said Teddy. “If there’s to be a party.”
“Go to sleep, Harry.  I’ll tell you in the morning.”
“That’s all right too.”
“I haven’t got a phone book at the moment,” Harry said.
you.”
Harry did want it.  He felt like he was gagging for it.  It was the powder.
“Spar Malfoy,” suggested one of the trainees. Harry would have suspected Finnigan, but his eyes were too large and luminous for his mouth to take up any space. It hadn’t been Nyala, but she was just looking at him with a quirked brow.
“Right,” said Harry. “There was that, too.”
“I’m sorry!”  Harry put up his hands.  “I just meant—you’re a different person than your father.  You can’t be him.  You have to be you.”
“I don’t think the cream worked,” Harry blurted, because he still didn’t feel any different.
bah is eating and the King’s just received a message from a crab.”
Finally, Draco turned around.  “Us.”
“Oh, Harry,” Draco breathed. “So big.”
Harry looked away until Malfoy was done. He was Malfoy’s
either, but Kavika had said it could be okay.
“Excellent. Do you think we can manage the whole term without ever speaking to each other at all? I think we can. It’ll be fantastic. I’ll pretend you don’t exist. Have a good day,” said Malfoy, spinning on a heel.
“No,” Harry said, because Malfoy seemed anxious to get away. “I can do it. You go on.”
Another three hours passed, during which Harry moved Draco back to the bed, enlarged Draco’s clothes, and tried not to worry.
“Harry.”  Hermione made a choked sound.
Harry closed his eyes.
Harry went over and sat, a little uncertain how people did things at picnics, but it was actually very much like eating in the flat above the shop—Draco spelled food onto Harry's plate, and when they started eating, it was delicious.  “I don’t believe you’re a regular cheater,” Harry said, after stuffing his face with some of the beef wellington.  It was beef covered with pastry, he had discovered, and it wasn’t bad at all.
Luna looked back up at the sky. “I could write them in a poem,” she said, “if you want it. So you remember.”
Licking his lips, Harry swallowed.
Harry finally lost his patience.  “Draco, not everything in the world is about how gay you are.”
“Which is why we have been seeking a way to control the Dementors,” said Parkinson. “And at long last, we’ve found one.”
Harry still felt gutted, as though Draco had taken all of his insides and put them into the future, where it seemed impossible that Draco could feel this way, leaving Harry in the present completely empty, scraped raw.  Then Harry opened his mouth and said the most incomprehensible thing he could have imagined saying.  “Can you take down your hair.”  His voice was so choked he didn’t even feel like he could make it sound like a question, at the end.
Harry’s eyes came open to watch it; he had to see it, Draco’s hand on his cock, Draco slowly jacking him—so slowly. Agonizingly slow. “Fuck.” Swallowing, Harry had to close his eyes again. His voice was strangled when he said, “Don’t tease me.”
They sat in Hermione and Ron’s kitchen, the kids asleep, surrounded by pictures the kids had made, Hermione’s frazzled notes to Ron on their message board, and the leftovers of Molly’s treacle tart on the table.  “Oh, the Ludville case,” Hermione said.  “Don’t worry about that.  Mysteries has it under control.  I’m sure it will all get cleared up in the end.”
Manoeuvring through the crowd, Harry swiftly made his way to the men’s. Then he was there, and just being there felt cooler. Tiles were always cold somehow, and it was quieter, and Harry could take off his coat. Loosen his tie. Unbutton his top buttons; breathe. The men’s had four stalls, one urinal, two sinks, mirrors above them. The mirrors looked cool too; Harry wanted to put his face against them, but he didn’t. He was already feeling much better. He just had to breathe.
Draco’s hand gripped Harry’s limp dick. “You want this to come while I fuck you?”
When Harry asked Robards—because Robards was Head Auror—why they didn’t have a lab, Robards frowned, stirred his tea, and said, “Did Savage put you up to this?”  Harry also hadn’t known at the time that Robards had it out for Savage.  In fact, Harry hadn’t known at the time that the entire Auror Department was a tangle of petty squabbles, one-upmanship, and red tape, but over the years Robards made it fairly clear with his frowns and his tea and his,
“I just thought you might not want to be cooped up all day.”
“You don’t mean that.”
Fairchild and Mark were part of the little army. Harry also recognized Bennet, Achar, Fuentes, Adebayo, and Wan, who had graduated last year. Fuentes was working the Mysteries, but the rest had become Aurors, which perhaps explained the cheering from the Aurors and instructors in the room. A few more Level Twos and another Level One streamed in, but Harry didn’t recognize the woman on Malfoy’s arm, who was dressed in the height of non-mag fashion and had a shaved head.
Fuck.
“Don’t summarize,” Draco said appearing over the side again.  “Read it.”
Harry read a sentence for him, following along with his finger so the letters wouldn’t jump, which was hard while holding the wand.
“I know,” Kavika said now, her rough voice its own version of gentle. “I’m sorry I couldn’t be there for you.”
Kavika tilted her head.
“Why would you say he is?  How could you say that?”
the next? I’m so interested to hear.”
, why—why would you—why would you choose to be—why . . .”  Draco’s face contorted.  “I thought you were like me!”
.  But of course, Draco never would have said such things about another child.  He never could have—not with the way he had treated Harry as a child.  He’d been so kind, so generous, so fiercely protective.  Now that Harry had grown up again and could see his own child-self through Draco’s grown-up eyes, Harry knew; he knew what it had looked like, that Draco had seen what Harry’s childhood had been.  Draco had seen it, and he’d done everything he could to make something safer and kinder, something loving for a child who had never had a glimpse of what real love could be.
Harry eyed the owl, then the man, then the owl again.  “I don’t particularly want to see my cousin,” Harry confessed.
“Oh.  Do you think you will?”
“Another kink of yours,” Draco said sardonically, but he let Harry help.  A combination of magic and walking with Harry’s arm around his shoulder got Draco through the kitchen and to the door, but there Draco said, “Let me do it.  You eviscerated me, at least let me piss in peace.”
“No, Harry,” said Draco.  “We’re not going to ruin Teddy’s furniture.”
“Love for your mother changed Snape.”
“You were made for me,” Draco said breathlessly, kissing him. “You’re mine. You’re mine. You belong to me. You’re perfect for me, Harry; you were meant for me. You’re meant for me.” Each of these things was said between kisses—not Draco’s teasing kisses; these were kisses dropped all over Harry’s face. They seemed to unlike Draco, messy and unplanned, as though Draco couldn’t help himself, and Harry couldn’t stand it.
Dumbledore's eyes twinkled for a moment as Harry adsorbed the information.
“I’m sure your guardian can help you set up the portkey once you get home,” he said with a smile. Harry nodded and then squatted down to show the collar to Ghost.
“Malfoy,” the black-haired man spoke. The power behind the voice alone caused Draco’s knees to feel weak.
"I'm sorry we can't do more, the poor boy."
"Where am I?" Harry asked as he started to sit up, wincing as he tried to move.
Harry didn't hesitate as he jumped into action, grabbing a bowl and filling it with water.
Wasn't this illegal?
Harry chuckled at Ammit, who sounded truly insulted. He patted his familiar's head as he turned from the window and Bubo flew past him.
“Elaborate,” Hisashi said, tails swaying back and forth as they sat, eyes gazing softly down at his pupil.
Harry sat on the bed facing the door, watching Draco pacing. It had been a week since classes had officially started, and everything had gone well until today. Well that and when Draco got over sleeping in the same bed. Harry snickered at the thought.
He could feel Tatsuya roll his eyes and ignore him.
Tom had been wary that the treatment Severus made with his potions wasn’t enough, so McGonagall chose to make a magical vow, binding her to the protection of Harry. Much like Severus had done so many years ago.
“What is it?” he asked.
“You’re going to miss breakfast and your chance to show McGonagall if you don’t hurry,” Hermione yelled through the door. She could hear Harry trying to go even faster then.
“So, you see, the collar was the best we could do. It helped repel the curses still clinging to you and boosted your own magic’s defenses. It may not be under the best circumstances but Lord LeFay’s magical core is keeping you in balance right now,” Professor Snape ended.
“It must be taking about Draco. It must think you two are bonded. I’ll talk to you about it after,” Remus croaked.
"Easy. You're perfectly save here Potter. Now answer the question," Snape said sternly. Harry relaxed tentatively. his eye glancing between his potions master and the door frequently as he sat back. Something Severus didn't miss.
“Do you remember anything that just happened?” Theo asked softly as he sat to one side of Harry with Neville in front of him. Harry shook his head slowly for a moment before stopping.
Harry laughed, "I don't know, I think it's kinda cute," he said as he looked over his shoulder in the hyena's direction.
“LeFay and Slytherin?” she said in surprise. Remus nodded slowly before tilting his head.
“He said my name. Well by one of the titles I have now. He called me LeFay in parsletongue before flipping out,” Harry explained as he stood beside the sleeping dragon and put his hand against the smooth scales.
“Nothing, Charlie is just surprised by the reaction Draco had,” Bill said, shaking his head at Severus. Snape seemed confused yet, returned to his normal blank face as Harry turned his attention from the group to the sleeping dragon.
Harry asked.
"Harry...," Lucius hung his head, as did the rest of the room. Even the house seemed to grieve.
Draco smiled a nervously and shuddered as a wave of raw magic crashed against him. When he opened them again he was startled by the look in LeFay’s eyes.
“Is something amusing?” LeFay asked.
Snape's head snapped almost painfully back to the child. "Aww, welcome back to the land of the living mister Potter," Severus sneered. He couldn't help the small smile that wanted to form at the corner of his mouth.
“Do you want us to walk with you back to your room. I mean since I’m guessing that’s where you were heading.”
"Um sure, how is...Ghost, going to help, he's just a-."
“I want to apologize-”
Tom Riddle's gaze rotated to Lucius, causing the man to swallow. "Lily Evans, is related to my late father distantly. I was her uncle of sorts. However I am also technically a distant cousin of the Potters through the Gaunt family branch. I would like to leave my family title as Harrison's great Uncle however, as not to confuse the child further when he wakes," he explained.
Draco lowered his wand as came face to face his with a rather goofy looking man.
Answer my call and I'll set you free'
“Thank you Severus, for your insight.” LeFay said as he stood, pulling his robes in around him a bit tighter. “You’ll get a pass for today, I needed to hear what I needed to hear,” he stopped, biting his lip, “If you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to go think on this, and I’m sure Draco will be happy to see you,” LeFay stated with a slight smile.
Jariss said, his purple eyes glowing behind Draco’s.
I am the force that in springtime will grow
Harry wrapped one arm around Ghost's neck, grateful for the warmth the albino creature provided. He was also grateful that the comfort the creature was offering felt true, not like when Hermione or Ron tried to comfort him. Though, he didn't blame them.
“How is he?”
LeFay groaned and squeezed one of his eyes shut for a moment.
Footsteps rushed towards him and the light turned on.
All was quiet.
Harry gritted his teeth and gripped Draco’s leg a bit tighter, “I hope so.”
“Nope, oh wait. Could you deliver a message to Luna and Neville? Oh! And, Theo and Hermione? Tell them I’ll be in my room for all of today and that I’ll see them after I finish,” he stated. Shibee nodded and with a pop was gone. Harry looked over his room and then went over to his flash fresh box. Opening it he pulled out a large rodent and set it into Ammit’s tank. Ammit struck it with his fangs and started eating it graciously, humming and coiling around his meal as he did. Harry sat down to eat his own food. He found it hard to concentrate, however, as he felt the kitsune moving around in his head.
Sirius scrambled over after the flood of wildlife passed and helped him sit up. “Are you okay?” He frowned, dusting Harry off and looking over him for any serious injuries.
Fifteen minutes had passed before the two settled on classes. The eight classes they would take together where Care of Magical Creatures, Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, Study of Ancient Runes, Herbology, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and the new Dark Arts class. For Harry’s ninth class he chose Alchemy, and Draco chose Astronomy. Both where respectively taking all N.E.W.T. level classes with help from Snape and Sirius who had acted as tutors. With five minutes left, Draco’s curiosity got the better of him.
"Of course, we won't need it after this, though. It is such a waste," LeFay smirked as his finger nail slid down the front of Draco's amethyst collar. With a resounding crack and an angry roar both Harry and Draco were on each other in an instant. As their mouths moved over each other they could feel their mentors circling each other, claws, teeth and horns classing as they fought for dominance, much the same as the couples tongues pushing again each other.
Draco's eyes narrowed slightly, something was starting to feel off.
"Well," Tom started as he moved to a more comfortable chair by the fire, "You already know about the horcruxes. How I split my soul into six pieces, technically seven."
Harry moved down the steps from his throne rapidly, followed closely by Draco as they moved to look over Cadmael. Cadmael coughed and Severus was busy feeding him another calming draught.
“Who’s this pipsqueak?” the man asked, stroking the short goatee on his chin. The three men shrugged and continued their conversation they'd been having when Draco walked in.
Bill’s eyes bulged, “And what if he doesn’t and decided to attack Harry?”
“People aren’t really going to use that horribly long title, are they?” Harry asked with a light laugh which caused Sirius and Remus to laugh.
Harry skipped through the hall, not a care in the world as Hermione and Luna talked behind him about famous animagi. Theo and Neville had struck up a conversation about the care of magical creatures class, and completely ignored the girls’ conversation.
“They haven’t done what I’ve done. They still feel something when they take a life, they take no pleasure in it!”
Harry slammed the table with his fist, splintering wood. "I asked if it would save him?!" he snapped.
Harry did take into consideration what his father had told him earlier, and turned away from the owl area. “Something I’m drawn to huh,” he mumbled to himself as he looked around the store. He continued to walk around before stopping in a rather shabby and abandoned looking area in the back of the shop. There was a shelf with a few cages, most of them seeming to be empty or full of crickets and mice to feed to other animals in the store.
“You’re just going to wear that to bed!”
Albus is pissed as the news unfolds once Harry is back at Hogwarts.
Big violet eyes narrowed at him before the dragon snorted. Harry smiled sheepishly and chanced a glance at Charlie only to have the dragon growl at him. He looked back at the dragon, still half smiling. “Charlie...,” Harry hissed quietly.
His eyes hesitantly met LeFay's, and within seconds he understood what was happening.
Harry sighed and then sat down on the ground, leaning against Draco’s tail since it still blocked his path. When Harry noticed the dragon was staring at him, he scrunched his nose and stuck his tongue out at the dragon. It tilted its head in response. “I can’t just stay here!” Harry shouted over his shoulder. Charlie had to agree. Severus came over from the fire to where Charlie and Bill stood, examining the pickle Potter seemed to be in.
"This is my brother Skoll," Hati grinned, introducing his packmate, "We are both part of Lord LeFay's werewolf faction. One of three packs living on the grounds," Hati boosted. "Skoll here is also one of the twelve LeFay keeps as his pets."
"Harry-."
“A dragon is nowhere near his power I know,” Harry stated. He sighed and then narrowed his eyes at the bramble that still had his pant leg. “Wish I still had fox legs, this stuff wouldn’t get stuck to me as easily,” he muttered. Bill laughed and leaned down to help him.
When they opened their eyes again all he saw was shadow covering the ground as the creature towered over them. It roared again, almost blowing out his hearing as he cringed.
“What is that supposed to mean?”
Bill rolled his eyes and then sat on the ground before taking out a book from his pocket and reading over some curses. Sirius and Remus started arguing in hushed whispers, leaving Harry to his own devices. He started wandering the perimeter of the clearing, looking over the ground curiously. He sniffed the air and then froze, his jaw tightening. It smelled like blood. There was a scream from the trees ahead of them just as a burst of wild life came crashing out of the bushes. Harry jumped back, turning to leap out of the way of a deer.
Harry shook his head as he stood and grabbed his books for class. First was Transfiguration, then Charms and Potions. He had an hour break in-between Potions and Ancient Runes which he decided he could use for animagas practice. Next was Herbology, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and the new Dark Arts class. He had another hour break for lunch before his Care of Magical Creatures class and then Astronomy. He thought about either going to the library for lunch and doing homework there, or in his room so he wasn’t disturbed. He didn’t think the people working at the library would be okay with him eating in there anyways.
Draco broke the angry hushed words he had been having with his godfather when he heard Harry speak.
"Well, I'm going to head back. The healers should be just about done now," Draco said as he got up from his seat. Tossing his glass into the sink as he passed by it. Voldemort watched him go, resting his chin in his hand. He was glad. Even with everything that happened, he was glad. This little blonde nit wit was a godsend. Without the little snake he honestly doubted Harrison would have made it this far. Even if they were enemies at least having Draco around had kept Dumbledore busy. To focused on keeping the boys from ripping out each other's throats to do more harm to Harry than he'd already done. Though, as he thought about it the one he really should be thanking is Severus. The man had done so much for his nephew without him ever knowing, and if he kept going down the list the real one he'd have to thank was Lily. If she hadn't captured Severus's heart none of this would have been possible. He sighed, if only he hadn't been so blind to what was happening around him, he could have stopped all this from happening.
“A man gave it to me,” Harry said.  “He can do a lot of weird stuff.”
“Could you?  When we meet again, is everything instantly forgiven?” Draco’s eyes slid over to him, gazing at him sideways around the long single curve of loose hair.  He looked away.  “I thought not.”
“Would he be an alpaca?”
Harry felt the brush of fabric and realized through his haze of lust that Draco still hadn’t taken off his clothes, only just opened his trousers, and for some reason the thought made Harry wild. He wanted to see himself: the red, aching arse, the thick, achingly erect prick, the naked, kneeling man, with the pale, slender and aristocratic figure of Draco in his posh clothes, absolutely destroying Harry’s arse with his pink cock.
After they were cleaned up and changed, Harry headed to the sitting room to talk to Sirius and Remus. He wanted to know who was dropping him off at the train before it left for Hogwarts in a few days. Instead he found Draco there, sitting on the love seat and drinking tea by the fire. The horns he had sported were gone, instead he held a book in his hands. One Harry hadn't seen before. He also noted that Draco’s nails where a bit like his own at the moment. Yet, Draco’s were curved like talons and almost completely black except for the tips. Against the white cover of the book Draco held, they were stunning. Harry wondered why he hadn’t noticed them before but decided it was probably do to Draco choice of outerwear.
Sirius was the first to speak. “Looks like they all took to you, and that LeFay one,” he let out a long whistle as he looked at the rings. “Looks like the magic embedded in the rings righted your creature inheritance. It was a good thing we did it then," he stopped to crack his fingers, "Well then, Lord Potter, Peverell, Gryffindor, Slytherin, LeFay. What else should we do today?” Sirius joked. Harry grinned and chuckled.
Draco finds all of this hilarious, he's rather enjoying himself.
“He did?” Bill and Severus said at the same time. Harry nodded, putting his hands in his pockets and rummaging through them for a moment before stopping when he hit the collar. He'd apparently forgotten about it's existence in all of the action from the day before. “If he did then his reaction could have been his magic and body trying to fight all the foreign magic in his system,” Bill thought out loud.
“Careful with that,” Harry croaked, his throat felt really sore. Like he had been screaming all day long.
With no one in sight and no roads nearby Draco let out a defeated sigh. He must have been thinking about the forest too much. He growned and started to prep himself to try again when something caught his attention in the trees.
"I'm sure that is true... I just, knew him, Fenrir, personally," Draco explained, "Draco Mafloy," Draco added as he extended his hand.
Hermione, along with the rest of the group, were pale. “Then, all these years…” Herm stopped, the thought was just too much. She wrapped her arms around herself as the weight of everything come down on her. “LeFay…” she whispered.
“It’s okay, just means we are going to be a bit longer than I’d hoped,” Sirius sighed, “Well come on let’s get going. Remus is going to have my head if I’m not there in time for our guests.”
"Yes...Even if that Harry wasn't really you, it wasn't that, that I was drawn to. Magic doesn't lie, and yours is...unique," Draco stated, trying to come up with the right words to use. LeFay seemed a bit lost for words as he just sat there staring at Draco. Then he started laughing. Draco frowned. "What is so funny?"
“I’m glad. Tatsuya give in a bit to Harry, you had your time to live. You are only his guide for the moment, remember that,” Hisashi warned.
Draco's eyes seemed to flash purple for a moment before his grey eyes returned, there was no sign of emotion on his face. "That's not entirely true, but it doesn't matter now. Even if it wasn't completely you that did it, you still had some control when Harry placed the collar on me," he stated.
“I think he and Ginny are still salty about you breaking up with her before summer started. Plus, the fact, we…,” she trailed off and bit her lip a little. Harry nodded in understanding and then looked over at Neville and Luna before glancing around more and frowning.
Harry woke up in his bed, covered by a large heavy creature.
He leaned forward, trying hard to figure out where it was coming from.
Harry stayed frozen to the spot as the dragon slowly stood, a bit wobbly, as a low rumble started in its throat. Almost as slowly as it stood, it dropped its head to Harry’s level. Its mouth and nose inches from Harry’s face.
