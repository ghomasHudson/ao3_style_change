“Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that,” said Malfoy, who suddenly looked a little sick to his stomach.
Figuring he should try to help, Draco started with the bookcase. It seemed as likely a hiding place as any; his father might have thought the other books would stash the diary in plain sight. Beginning from the left, Draco pulled out one volume at a time, glancing through each and shining his wand at the back of the bookcase, occasionally testing the backboard with his knuckles before shoving the books back in their places. Shelf by wide shelf Draco looked, dragging his father’s desk chair over so he could reach the topmost level, all with no results. Perhaps it was too obvious a hiding spot— it had, after all, been the first place Draco thought to check.
“Kneel down and feel the soil compress as you do so. Pick a large root and follow the winding path it makes across the grass, growing thinner and splitting off into other roots. When you spot a section you think you can lift, wrap your hands around the root and pull. Pay attention to the strain of your muscles, the way the bark turns sharp in your hands as it slides; the way the root snaps loose from the ground; the way the earth scatters and lands, in clumps, against you.
Potter was exciting to look at— there was so much contrast between his brown skin and black hair. In pictures of Draco, it always looked like he had already begun to fade— ghostly, indistinct. Potter’s features were bold and well defined. Pleasant. Attractive, even. His unruly hair, under a certain lens, wasn’t
He brought a hand to his mouth. All flowers had meanings attached, and his mother had taught him every single one when he was younger, as part of his studies. Up until that point, he had shrugged off the meanings of the flowers he grew accidentally, but now… Now it was impossible to ignore the significance of the tree standing before him.
“Sit, Draco,” Professor Snape instructed, gesturing vaguely toward the wooden chair in front of his office desk. It was the second day of the new term, during a break from classes he and Professor Snape shared.
“See? He’s fine. Now leave,” Pansy ordered. She didn’t face Harry until the door had been closed, and then Harry erupted into laughter.
“I haven’t—” Draco grabbed her shoulders when she tried to push past him— “I haven’t gotten you anything, okay? Why won’t you believe me?”
Draco reached for a peculiar glass eye, whose iris was orange, but before he could palm it, his father spoke. “Touch nothing, Draco.”
“I’ve been meaning to tell you something,” said Mrs Malfoy, accepting the cup Draco offered her. “I’ve…noticed you are spending more and more time shut up in our library. The books and newspapers you’ve selected have a common theme: Salazar Slytherin and his Chamber of Secrets.”
“Get the door,” Draco said, scanning the room to make sure it was truly as empty as it seemed. The morning light was growing stronger with each second, streaming in through the latticed windows and stretching to illuminate the first row of unoccupied desks.
This, finally, was enough to end Draco’s shock. “I need air,” he mumbled, and without sparing a glance at either of his parents, fled the room. The door slammed behind him, cutting off the remainder of his parents’ argument.
“There’s one final technique we could try, if you’re willing,” said Professor Snape. “It’s something that very few wizards, even those skilled in other areas of the field, have ever done: create false memories. Often it is very obvious to the Legilimens that the person is, in fact, tricking them. But with your success in everything we’ve practiced, I think you could do it.”
The corners of Professor Snape’s mouth slid upward again. “Patience, Draco,” he said, “there are several things I want to cover before we begin. Now. When I enter your mind, are you aware, then, that you’re not experiencing reality?”
He hadn’t been outside yet, but already Draco could feel the heat rolling toward him from where he stood behind the front doors. In the distance, the sky was dark, threatening rain. His father was anticipating guests. His mother had announced a splitting headache and had retired upstairs.
Draco clasped the back of his neck. All of a sudden, he didn’t know where to look. Potter’s smile was sure to disappear the moment Draco told him, he was convinced of it. “You're not going to like it…”
“However,” he added, turning towards Draco, “I do not wish for our holiday to interfere with your studies, so when we leave will depend on you.”
“I don’t—” Draco set his tea down carelessly on the table in front of him, startling Raziel. He tore from the room in a monochrome blur. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
The next time they met, a week later, Professor Snape told Draco he would not be quite as easy on him. He guided Draco through clearing his mind, and then Draco was immersed in his memories once more…
stop it, somehow. I’ll go write to a couple of friends over at St Mungo’s, see if anything like this has ever been reported.
“Yes, but how? He didn’t rip the bars away on his own, he must’ve gotten help from someone…” If the Ministry had taken him, they wouldn’t have been so careless with the house and the Statute of Secrecy. So if not them, who could have possibly…? “Oh!”
Mrs Malfoy’s smirk became a smile, though it was a small one. She clearly knew something of why Draco was in a bad mood. “Let’s go home,” she said, and held out her hand.
Draco started to cross the room under the guise of examining the cluttered shelves and cases. Really, he was hoping to get a peek into that big cabinet in the corner. Because Draco could have sworn that he had seen a Potter-shaped shadow leap into it before the door closed. No doubt it was wishful thinking — what reason would Potter have to be in a place like this? — but if Potter really was here…
“If you are indeed correct, Malfoy,” said Madam Pomfrey seriously, “you have a long night ahead of you. And if Potter’s…discomfort is anything like yours, a painful night.”
Draco took one last look at Potter before closing the photograph in a drawer on his desk. Then he reached for the newest letter for Potter.
Normalcy was shattered, however, when some new, startling information emerged. There was a plot to remove all the Muggle-borns from Hogwarts, which meant the Chamber of Secrets would be opened for the first time in fifty years.
Draco chuckled, then reached out to comb the final strands of Potter’s hair into place. “There,” he said when he was satisfied.
Draco barely had time to register what she said before the fire turned green and a pair of pointed black shoes popped through the flames. He leapt aside as the rest of Pansy materialised and she stepped out onto the hearthrug.
The back lawn of Number 4, Privet Drive was covered in dew and spare materials. A man stood on the highest rungs of a ladder, which was propped against the side of the house. The only noise was the loud roar of a drill as the man secured bars onto a window.
Draco’s body seized up and he fell toward Pansy. She lowered him to the floor. “It’s for your own good, darling,” she sang, patting his cheek before sliding the drawer open again, completely unimpeded.
“Disgusting. If I didn’t know better, I’d have thought rubbish came out of your mouth just then,” said Pansy sarcastically. She took her trunk from him. “Since when does Draco Malfoy get sentimental?”
“Blast it!” Draco yelled, and kicked his bed. “Blast it all! You saw the door, how many times d’you suspect they fed him, huh? Or let him out to use the toilet? Those disgusting harpies kept Potter in there like a caged animal!” He kicked the bed again.
Potter turned to admire the sides of his head. He brought a thumb to his jawline, seeming to test its sharpness before sliding it along the ridge to his chin.
There were some shrill screams of delight as Gilderoy Lockhart emerged from a back room. He was dressed in periwinkle blue robes that were as incandescent as his smile, which he directed at everything that moved (including, amusingly, several photographs of himself, which smiled back). A short, balding photographer scurried about with a large camera, taking pictures wildly. The bright flashes had a strange strobing effect against the purplish smoke his camera gave off.
“No,” Pansy agreed with a grin. “But it was fun. And anyway, the most important thing for you to get right is how often you talk about yourself.”
The letter wilted in Draco’s hands when he finished it. He touched the word “Love” and wondered if Granger had paused before writing it, or if it had flowed naturally from her quill. He then wondered if she ended letters to Weasley the same way. They had been so unkind to her for most of the year, everyone had. What had changed?
Draco left the flowers where they were. He gathered the pile of books he had finished reading and placed them on his desk. He had to figure out what he was going to wear today.
“But who’s going to protect you?” said Draco, covering her hand with his. “Aren’t you in danger too?”
. After a long train ride, the back was even worse than usual; it looked like Potter had spent the entire train ride doing headstands or Merlin knew what else. Sometimes, Draco swore Potter messed his hair up on purpose, that he somehow knew just how much it riled Draco up to see it like that.
Draco wasn’t quite sure how to interpret that. Despite his words, it looked as if Potter was enjoying this, but it was impossible to tell for sure. And Draco wasn’t about to ask, for fear of being accused of the same thing. He didn’t think he’d be able to lie convincingly.
Sleep that night, it turned out, did not come easily. There were about a million things tangling together in Draco's mind, especially after finding Potter at the Weasleys’. And lying in bed, wasting hours rumpling his sheets, wouldn’t do him any good. So Draco decided to get up and wander the silent manor. Following no particular path, he eventually found himself facing a familiar door. Tension twisted itself around his muscles. It had been almost a year since he last entered the piano room.
“No!” Draco interrupted, feeling his face and neck grow hotter. He didn’t need to see the next part of her scenario. “No, I- I- I can’t do that!”
Pansy crossed her legs. “To a degree, yes, I believe that. But there’s something else you’re not telling me, which is fine — we’re allowed to keep things from each other — but you’re hiding it from yourself too, which really isn’t healthy.”
Draco stole one final look at Potter before he left, clutching his arm where a particularly heavy tome had struck him. Hagrid moved, unknowingly, in front of Potter and Draco caught Granger’s eye instead; he scowled to cover for his lingering gaze.
Draco awoke breathless and confused. He surged forward and searched around himself, wondering what had woken him up, but his bedroom looked the same as it had several hours prior: dark and empty. So why did he feel like there was something he was meant to do?
“Lemon blossoms,” Pansy murmured. “They…symbolise discretion. But why…?” She glanced between the photograph and Draco, and her eyes widened as she came to a conclusion. From her expression, she had either discovered the truth or was very close to it. Pointing her wand at him again, she said, “
“Good. I’d give you something for your pain, but I’m not sure how that will react with whatever’s going on with you. I’m afraid all we can do right now is wait this out.” Her face softened. “I…realise that’s not the most encouraging thing, but we
Dobby snapped again. For a moment all was quiet, and then there was more thumping as students ran around the train, desperately trying to reclaim their diaries.
“Fine.” Draco took a breath, trying to calm himself. “Hermione,” he said, pleased when it came out cordially, “what are you saying for the second part of our Transfiguration homework? Since you’ve already finished.”
he wanted it was as of yet unclear. He held up the photo, frowning as Potter smiled at his friends over and over in the loop the camera had created.
“Oo, clever,” Potter said sarcastically. He stepped so close to Draco that he was forced backward. “Finally grown some brains, have you? Only took you six years.”
Not exactly for the first time, Draco found himself wishing he could have been in the photograph— not hiding behind a column, but standing in place of Granger and Weasley. In the loop, they looked at Potter like he was bordering on mad, then exchanged worried glances with each other. Draco folded the photo so they were hidden round back.
“I have no doubt. But that is my precise point. Those feelings hold great power over you, and your intense desire to keep them to yourself might be enough to find success at this stage. I have been very generous with your privacy — I have not pried into that which you clearly want to protect — but I’m afraid I can think of no other alternatives.”
“But it’s not as simple as doing a countercurse.” Potter frowned as he connected the few bits of information Draco had provided. “It’s something we have to do, then. Was Madam Pomfrey right? Does it involve…more contact?”
likely to just up and kiss Draco in the middle of the Great Hall, so that was definitely out. But knowing those things didn’t make the wait any easier.
“Doesn't mean I can't try it again.” Draco took a bite and tried to look like he didn’t enjoy the lemony flavour or the tenderness of the meat. The house elves had done an excellent job, as always. “Not bad, I guess,” he mustered.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Lockhart said, gesturing for the crowd to be silent, “what an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect time for me to make a little announcement I’ve been sitting on for some time!
,” she added, making Hermione and Ron’s smiles droop, “make your visit quick. I’m expecting the Headmaster and your heads of houses, and I won’t tolerate a crowded ward.”
What was more, Draco was increasingly convinced that his plan was far crueller than he thought— far crueller than he had ever intended to be. How could he take away Potter’s freedom, knowing what he did about the life Potter would escape by attending Hogwarts?
Professor Snape’s black eyes flashed with amusement. “I’m sure. Close your eyes, Draco, and humour me. I want to see what your baseline skills are.”
His bedroom doors had barely closed before Draco flung open the ones leading to his balcony. He bent over the stone balustrade, his knuckles turning white from how tightly he gripped it. He didn’t know whether to cry or laugh or scream. Before today, he had thought the Chamber of Secrets a myth — its existence had been contested since the moment Salazar Slytherin claimed its creation — but to find out that it was indeed real, and that a girl had died the last time it opened? That was incontestable.
“Okay…” Something quite evil drew Pansy’s lips upward. “Maybe you don’t have to tell him at all. Maybe you grab him next you see him—” she mimed taking hold of someone’s shoulders—  “and then—” she slammed the table, pinning the imaginary person beneath her.
In less than a second, Potter had whirled around and, kneeling, had begun attacking Draco’s hair. By the time Draco successfully detached himself from the other boy, the damage had been done.
“And of course,” said Madam Pomfrey, “without knowing how this came about, I can only predict how long this will last, how it can be fixed, or even
On the opposite end of the train, Draco found the compartment where Potter should have been. Inside, the Patil twins were talking animatedly with Ginny Weasley, while Granger looked out the window and worried her bottom lip.
Draco gathered the weave of his blanket and started working it between his fingers. “You’re talking like you think his anger is inevitable, Mother.”
“Do you think Father will fail?” Draco asked flatly, trying not to sound like he was making an accusation.
, Lucius, no matter how effective the school board’s efforts were to cover up the reason. If you intend to threaten Draco’s life—”
Hope y'all are staying safe in all aspects of the word (emotionally, physically, etc.); if safety's not something you can currently find, I hope your situation changes for the better very soon. Sending you my love <33
“Not yet,” Draco admitted. “Nothing more than, sometimes, a sort of…vague notion that I want to escape, or hide, or something— but that’s probably what I was feeling the first time I went through those things, not anything new I’m feeling there, in the moment.”
After passing over roughly ninety-five percent of his clothes, Draco ended up choosing one of his favourite sets of robes: light grey, well-fitting, and long enough that they swished dramatically when he walked. Minutes later, he descended the grand staircase, hand moving carelessly along the railing and robes sweeping behind him. He was several steps from the ground floor when his father turned at the noise.
Slumping to the ground, Draco looked out onto the colourful grounds of Malfoy Manor, feeling more useless than he ever had before. Usually, when he wasn’t sure of what to do, he would follow his father’s advice. He couldn’t do that now.
“You know,” said Potter, tilting his head back so Draco could start combing, “being rude to me won’t make me want to listen to you.”
Draco closed the door and when he turned, was surprised to find Potter smiling at him. “What is it?” Draco asked him.
Draco rubbed a hand over his cheek. “I don’t know. Like I’ve said, Father and I were separated for a while—”
“I’m worried about you, if you’ll believe it. You don’t laugh at my jokes nearly as often as you used to, and you’ve spent most of your time thinking about Potter. Watching him, too.”
“Very much so. Eventually, we will move on to keeping your mind sealed entirely, but we’ll work up to that. What I hope to accomplish next — forcing someone out of your head — involves two things: one, recognising that they’re there with you, and two, using that knowledge to ground yourself. And very often the first leads to the second. Awareness that you’re not alone can ground you, giving you the necessary desire and force to eject the intruder. Do you understand?”
The conversation Draco overhears in the train station is from pp. 308-9 in Sorcerer's Stone, from chapter seventeen, "The Man with Two Faces"
“Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” said Draco, hoping his affected drawl sounded normal to the pair. He tried not to look hurt when Potter frowned at him. “
The noise Draco let out was somewhere between a whimper and a sob. His father had ruined everything! How could Draco give Potter his letters now, when so much had changed? Potter would only be
Draco could have sworn the snow outside fell a bit heavier then. The room certainly felt cooler against the blush that flared over his cheeks. “I don’t know what you mean.”
follow them down to their very tips, far into the dark, then pick one root and follow that. Picture a seed at the very end, cracked wide open, and picture that root coiled tightly against the seed’s smooth inner wall.
Of course, with accomplishments such as these, no one would expect Mr Potter to be a model student — one might assume he had little time for academics, what with how busy he seems to have been — but despite all the excitement of his first year, Mr Potter managed to pass all his final exams, which is no less impressive than the adventures he had along the way. We at the
Class went more quickly after that, and soon enough they were all folded back into the crowded corridors. Draco and Weasley headed toward Divination, and Granger toward Arithmancy. But Draco only got halfway to his destination when a voice stopped him.
Mr Malfoy sighed. “I am only trying to keep you all apprised. I am not personally responsible for the creation of this Act, you understand, and there’s only so much influence I can use to prevent it.” He hesitated. “Does that satisfy you, McNair?”
I know that Snape has a conversation with Draco in book six, where Snape thinks Bellatrix taught Draco Occlumency, but honestly I think it’s more likely Narcissa did it in canon. I believe she’s an exceptional Occlumens (she really has to be), and this fic sorta builds on that a bit; she’s very skilled, but Snape is too. I have it where she thinks Snape’d be a better teacher than she might be (he regularly teaches other things, though of course she’d have no idea he was teaching Harry Occlumency) and thus trusts him to do a good job, which is why she sends Draco to learn from him in this fic. That’s all, thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
Potter sighed and stood, brushing himself off violently. “Fine.” He strode to his bed and jerked his sheets aside, crawled beneath them, then faced the opposite direction. “If you want to be childish about this, fine.”
He huffed. “You know, I can’t decide what’s worse about this: getting your woefully shameful vision, your complete disaster for hair, or the sheer agony of turning very slowly into you. And not just the physical pain. The
“Keep looking,” his mother urged him, “I’m sure something will turn up. We can buy more books when we go to London for your school things, too. And if, for some reason, we can’t find the diary before you leave for Hogwarts, you should be prepared. I doubt your father could be convinced to send you somewhere else for your second year; the whole reason he’s trying to get rid of the Muggle-borns is so you don’t have to go to school with them.”
“Good lord,” Draco breathed. “You weren’t kidding.” He couldn’t bring himself to look anywhere else but the window, not even when the wetness of the grass began to seep into his slippers. If he had thought the Dursleys bad before…
“Yes, very well,” said Yaxley, his voice chillingly familiar, “thank you, Lucius. Now, onto the next item of business. There has been a recent uptick in inquiries at Gringotts— people from the Ministry wanting to see what’s kept in some of the older vaults, which I presume is related to that Act you mentioned. However, none of the goblins are willing to let anyone down to examine the vaults, so it seems we’re safe for now…”
Draco did his best to remain silent during the spine shrinkage, but it was difficult. Potter’s whimpers and yelps were fairly loud too, despite being muffled by his pillow— Draco wondered if it was perhaps worse to feel yourself be stretched than shrunk. It certainly sounded that way.
He hadn’t even considered looking for the diary. Of course, now that his mother had suggested it, he was surprised that he hadn’t connected that himself. It was so obvious, of course they should try to find it! Somehow, that diary would set everything into motion, and if he and his mother could destroy it before the start of term, Potter wouldn’t need protection from whatever the monster was, because it wouldn’t be loose.
Draco cursed his pale complexion as he started to blush for the second time that morning. He had gone too far.
“Good,” said Professor Snape. “During our session today, pay attention to signals that someone else is there with you. These signals may present themselves in any number of ways. In my case, I most often feel what is akin to a cold hand on the back of my neck. Sometimes it is a more subtle feeling, and other times it feels like frostbite setting in. Have you noticed anything like that?”
“I'm so sorry, Draco,” she said, looking genuinely upset. “I wanted you to spend more time understanding Potter, rather than abusing him all the time. It’s quite taxing on us all. Me especially.”
“Close your eyes and picture several of those memories now…" said Professor Snape. "Live in each of them, briefly, and then move on. Tell me when you are ready.”
Blaise was the only reason Draco was dreaming about, thinking about, kissing Harry Potter. Draco’s mind had clearly latched on to Blaise’s words and turned insinuations into pictures.
“It is,” said Potter. “I brought it with me when I brought my toothbrush.” He unfolded the wispy fabric and gestured for Draco to step closer, then wrapped it round Draco’s shoulders, which instantly disappeared.
Despite his words, Pansy started across the room and opened his closet— “Does that mean there’s more than one?” —and slid his clothes aside, peering into the shadows beneath them.
Wand outstretched, she began to move methodically around the room, the hem of her blue dressing gown drifting behind her; she touched nothing, and whispered what Draco thought must be detection charms. He had never seen anyone perform this sort of magic before, but he was familiar with the theory. The process could not be rushed.
But like every other change, the pain down his back eventually stopped. When it did, Draco sat up and said, “This is ridiculous. We’re obviously not going to be able to sleep, might as well suffer together.”
“Of course not! I thought maybe Potter’s family were angry with him or something that day, or…well, maybe in a rush?” Exasperated, Draco’s hands flew up. “But they weren’t— they always treat him like that. Can you imagine treating
like that? Muggles are foul, stupid creatures, but surely they must have some appreciation for what he did. Why else would the Dursleys have taken him in?”
“Draco,” said Professor Snape, bending so that he could look directly at Draco, rather than down at him, as he had been. His black eyes were intense. “I understand your discomfort. I know, intimately, the secrecy you wish to preserve…I know, too, that that secrecy has largely revolved around Potter. Targeting that might give you enough cause to throw me from your mind.”
Neither boy got much sleep that night. As Madam Pomfrey had discerned, the transformations were oddly staggered. One moment Draco would be perfectly fine, and the next, one of his feet would start to feel like it was being shoved into a very small bottle. As Draco was somewhat taller than Potter, he had plenty of time to figure out the correct analogy for the sensation. The worst was arguably when his spine, and only his spine, constricted so violently he thought that every single vertebrae had been broken.
“You’ve been me for weeks now, you tell me— in your experience, how much do you think I’ve exaggerated there, exactly?”
“Yeah.” Draco was grateful Potter had gotten that far, but it didn’t make his next words easier… “According to the book the curse came from,” he said, pulling Pansy’s book out and motioning for Potter to take it, “we— We have to…kiss.”
“Fantasy?” Draco said, grasping onto any part of that sentence that he thought would keep them from talking more about Potter.
“And here I was thinking that we might move past all that,” Draco said, leaning forward to playfully pinch the other boy’s chin.

“No, not really,” said Potter, taking the cloak and stashing it in his old bag. “I thought you might have taken it as a hint that I was ready to, erm… Change back.”
“It seems the switching process has finished,” Madam Pomfrey announced after several long minutes. “Frankly, I’m not sure if that’s good or bad news.”
“Doesn’t matter, I want to see it,” she said, pulling her wand from nowhere and pointing it at him. “
“What, all your talent?” Draco shouted. Several of the students around them snickered, and Potter very obviously tried not to join them.
The entire room held its breath, waiting for something magical to happen. A light, maybe, or a sound, if not a complete reversion back into the proper bodies. Something to signify that what had happened last night, and what they were trying now, had a purpose.
, Weasley?” Malfoy snapped from the next bed, adjusting Harry’s round glasses angrily on his own face.
“Draco,” came his father’s voice, echoing off the buildings. He was standing about halfway to Borgin and Burkes, a pinched expression on his face.
Mr Malfoy’s mouth was small. “I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin.”
“You do realise, Draco, that this is not news to me? I am your teacher, and in many ways another caregiver for you. Do you truly believe that I haven’t seen the way you look at Potter? That I haven’t understood, very clearly, the content of what I've seen?”
motivation for hiding them…” Professor Snape stopped in front of Draco. “Does that sound any better?”
“I can’t listen to another minute of this buffoonery.” Draco held out his arm. “Let’s be off. Mother promised me Belgian waffles this morning, and you need to be back soon to cook them.”
Actually, Harry got used to a lot of things faster than he thought he would. Classes went about as normal, with two exceptions. The first was that he and Malfoy had to exchange notes regularly, especially with Malfoy in Arithmancy and Harry in Divination; the second was that Snape didn’t know how to treat them. He spent most of their Defense Against the Dark Arts classes ignoring both boys, instead taking his frustrations out on Neville. After the first time, Harry had told Neville about his and Malfoy’s switch, hoping that explanation would somehow make up for it. The brilliant smile Neville gave Harry at being included was worth something, anyway.
“I’ll do it then,” said Pansy. “I’m an excellent liar. And Draco… Here.” She gave him the book she’d shown him downstairs. “Good luck.”
, when he discovered Draco was finally starting to understand him. That Draco’s resentment was starting to fade.
go to a near-empty school, if the monster only leaves purebloods alive. The sacred twenty-eight don’t have many children our age, you know. It’d barely be ten of us.”
“Of course,” said Harry. “How’s this?” He strutted toward her, doing an exaggerated version of Pansy’s suggestions.
“What was different this time,” Professor Snape said delicately, changing tack, “that caused you to push against me, rather than give me another memory as you have done in the past?”
Something was off. Pansy seemed almost…distracted. Nervous. Draco leaned forward. “Do you, or do you not, know who’s cursed us?”
“There’s Quidditch tryouts coming up. You know how obvious it would be if Draco Malfoy suddenly started flying like Harry Potter?”
“Okay in there, Draco?” That was Crabbe, had to be. Goyle had a much deeper voice. “Pansy’s not…doing things to you again, is she?”
“No… No reason?” Draco asked, incredulous. “NO REASON?!” He pushed Professor Snape away from him. “You- you— I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE ASHAMED—”
As if they knew they were being mentioned, Harry’s squirmed. He hadn’t thought about his heart, or lungs, or blood type, or anything like that. All he knew was that he and Malfoy now looked like each other— he’d assumed last night that everything else had righted themselves. Or rather,
He reached for his wand to give the man a good hex, then cursed as he realised his pockets were empty. Stepping forward, he pushed up the sleeves of his dressing gown.
have that stupid school putting foolish ideas into your head. There are no ‘good’ Mudbloods. Those who believe otherwise are no better than them.

to save a fellow classmate from mortal peril, and that after learning the Philosopher’s Stone was in danger of falling into the wrong hands, Mr Potter himself went through all manner of obstacles to make sure the Stone was safe, in so doing revealing the evil intentions of former professor Quirinus Quirrell.
“Potter,” Draco said, putting his hands in his pockets to avoid the pull of comforting the other boy. He didn’t think that would help things right then. “So we’re clear, we don’t have to do anything about this right now. I’m merely…offering you the information.”
It took everything Draco had in him not to storm downstairs and attack the Dursleys for everything they had done. A lifetime of atrocities and still they found a way to be even worse to Potter. Shaking with barely-concealed rage, Draco moved to examine the window, but as he did so, he felt something crush beneath his foot. He froze, frightened for a moment that it might be flowers, but it was only a crumpled piece of parchment— the letter Potter must have gotten the night of his birthday. Potter hadn’t been expelled, after all. Which meant that everything Draco had done was even more useless than he’d thought.
Horrified, Draco buried his hands even further in his sleeves. “We aren’t talking about that right now.”
She nodded to the other occupants. “Crabbe, Goyle.” They grunted in reply, and she breezed out into the corridor.
Maybe today he would make Dobby return the stolen letters. It wasn’t like Draco had been planning to send Potter an
The room looked much as it normally did, dim and packed with extra bottles and vials of potion ingredients, but there was also now a shallow, very strange-looking basin on Professor Snape’s desk. It gave off a silvery light, and its surface rippled like that of a pond.
A long moment passed as Draco tried to figure out the best way to answer. He hadn’t said anything about how the Chamber of Secrets connected to Potter, and could feel Pansy’s eyes on him, expectant. Under different circumstances, Draco might have admired her shrewdness. “I’m not sure,” he said finally, directing the statement at his folded hands.
the school? That wasn’t public knowledge. Yes, there had been many speculations about how Potter had found the Philosopher’s Stone, but there had never been mention of the Dark Lord’s presence in the school. Surely if he had been there, Draco’s father would have said something.
“Subconscious choices are still choices,” Professor Snape said, sitting his wand on the desk behind himself. “You must remember that when your mind is under attack. What you have already shown me glimpses of, and tried to direct me away from— these are things the Dark Lord would want to investigate, if He had seen them. He would infiltrate even further into your mind, with even more purpose, and find whatever you are trying hardest to conceal from Him.”
Next week looks to be very busy for me, so since this chapter is already written and I wanted y'all to get some gay Draco, I'm posting this now too. Enjoy!
. The memory you chose was unremarkable, yes, but it quickly devolved into other, more incriminating ones, and even fantasies. Now, I gave you a good chance to take back control, but when it became clear to me that you would not, I had to end the spell. The Dark Lord would not do the same; He would press you harder for the information.
The best way to go about being around Potter would be going straight into detail mode. No reason to get caught up in small talk if they didn't have to.
“We also want to welcome our new professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor Dreada, and our new Transfigurations professor, Professor Niehaus.” Applause rang through again.
“Shove off.” Ron laughed, at least attempting to come to his best friends aid. “You can hold my hand if you get too lonely.” Ron whispered to Harry. It wasn’t Harry’s fault when a second later one of his toadstools ended up jumping down Ron’s back.
Draco closed the distance between them by bringing Harry's face to his. He had both hands cupping Harry's face now, and Harry let out a small surprised sound. Draco felt him smile into the kiss which prompted his own.
“Two weeks. It’s kind of an unspoken Pureblood rule that the less time you give in advance, and the more people who attend, the higher your status is.”
His heart was slowing back to normal but Harry still felt clammy. He had no good reason for reacting the way he did.
He maneuvered his way around the tables to get to the counter at the front of the store. He always found himself staring around the new products and tchotchkes around the Kettle. The tables were piled high with carefully placed merchandise, one group of tables specifically for Draco and Blaises’ potions.
Why would he still harbor some insane crush on the man six years after they left Hogwarts. Why else would he have been so careful as to not be around him? Making sure they were never alone together, never sat beside him. Kept conversations casual. Which, ok, Draco reasoned in his head, made it sound like
They walked a few steps into the alley behind the club before Draco offered his arm to Harry and the pair Apparated away.
“That’s only four months. Maybe May? That’s at least six months. And I’m confident in our ability to have kept quiet during that whole time. Not to mention, it’s not like we weren’t seen around each other the whole time.”
“No way!” Pansy said, “you Halfbloods and Muggle Borns will just put back all the bad ones for the people who don't know them.”
“Well, Nolan and I broke up two years ago around this time. I know he knows I was single for at least a few months after that.”
“Good morning all, I hope the first day of classes has treated you all well. Remember, do not hesitate to ask questions, we are all here to guide you through.” McGonagall looked around before continuing.
We did it!! I just want to thank everyone who has supported this fic, it's been so fun seeing your reactions to it <3
“We’re celebrating.” Theo announced to the three of them, flashing a smile that Harry could only describe as dazzling.
Harry let his gaze linger on the room for a moment longer. Students were still hanging about despite the late hour.
Malfoy gave him a curt nod as Harry sat down and before Harry could think of something to say, Dreada started talking.
It seemed stranger now, both he and Malfoy washing up together, as if it were a natural occurrence. Harry didn't look at Malfoy through the mirror again, and soon enough both of them were finishing up.
It seemed everyone had the same idea, since they were all lounging around the Common Room when the three of them got there. Harry took a seat on one of the big chairs while Ron and Hermione sat on the loveseat together. Seeing them cuddled up made Harry smile, he couldn’t think of better people the two of them could have ended up with.
"Number one," she said, raising a finger, "Potter hates being in the papers. Number two, Potter is single!"
To Harry's surprise, the man started talking to Draco. Harry watched as they went through some type of introduction. He saw Malfoy hide a laugh behind his hand as the man grinned. The bartender approached, taking his order and then the other man's. Harry had a funny feeling in his stomach as he watched them.
Harry led them up the front steps and into his house. The interior was just as Draco remembered. It was nice but lacked a sense of homelyness. Almost as if it were a show home.
Something changed between the two of them that night, though Harry couldn’t quite place it. Malfoy hadn’t said anything while Harry cried in his arms nor when he had calmed down and said his goodbyes. Malfoy had gently taken his hand and the pair apparrated right outside Hogwarts and walked silently as the snow fell softly over their shoulders. The whole time, Draco’s presence had felt like an anchor for Harry.
Harry looked to his own roommates then, to see they were already inside. He sighed but went into the room as well.
“Couldn’t tell you. Both times he was in the middle of saying something as Malfoy was leaving to change, and then he’d get hit.”
“Alright, we need to come up with a timeline. Everything about this has to be carefully planned out and decided before we go to the wedding.” Draco started.
“Ownes and Blanche were good, but Miller is what you want. Give her some more practice and she’ll be winning your games for you.”
Harry felt both surprise and...a pit in his stomach over the confession. Theodore Nott flashed into his brain instantly. He was unquestionably handsome. Quite slender, face pointed but not as severe as Draco's, quiet yet held an air of authority and respect around himself. Harry would have assumed Blaise before Theodore if he was being honest. Something about it being the unassuming boy made his heart twist.
Daphne, Sue, and Susan were refusing to leave one another's sides as the Powerpuff Girl trio helped the others with finishing touches.
Draco looked around the space before him. He didn’t want to exactly insult Harry, but this house didn’t feel remotely like a home.
Draco was stood at his own bed, across from Harry’s, silently unpacking his trunk. Harry started unpacking his own trunk and setting up his desk.
“Oh calm down, if we wanted to steal it, we wouldn't have told you we knew about it.” Millicent muttered, eyes narrowing.
And it was true. The first few days after they split were a little awkward but that didn't last long. They were back to their regular friendship quickly. Besides, the only difference between them dating and just being friends, as Ginny had put it, was “A little less snogging.”
Ron gave an understanding nod, “I’ll drink to that.” and a cheer went around the table as they each took a drink.
“No!” Harry yelled a little too loudly. Draco was standing too, looking nervous. Harry let out a breath and paused his slightly frantic motions.
Harry’s hand reached out instinctively and grabbed Draco’s waist. The three of them stilled, Harry’s hand keeping tight on the other boy's waist. Thankfully, only Peeves floated by. The three of them reached the rest of the group a moment later. Harry dropped his now slackened hand from Malfoy’s waist and dragged the Cloak off of them.
“We want all the Eighth Years to dress in muggle costumes and experience muggle nightlife. We think it’ll be really fun.”
“Blimey, ‘arry! Ron! ‘ermione! Jus’ the people I was lookin’ fer!” Hagrid yelled excitedly. He wrapped all three into a bone breaking hug.
“Off you go, Potter.” Draco said feigning nonchalance, but Harry could hear the slight tremor in his voice.
When he turned to face Malfoy for the first time since the trial began, Malfoy was staring at him with such an uncharacteristically vulnerable look that Harry had to hold onto the table to steady himself. It had only lasted a moment before Malfoy’s face drew neutral once again, but Harry had been unable to stop thinking about it.
“Really Draco, it has nothing to do with what we were talking about.” Harry found he couldn’t even say the words.
Harry smiled. That sounded wonderful if he was honest. "Do you think they'll be distracted having the Boy Who Lived watch their tryouts?"
I want to say the BIGGEST thank you to every person who commented and kudo'd and bookmarked this fic! I especially want to thank you guys who have been here with me basically this whole time, writing your thoughts and feelings about this fic. Reading all of your comments truly makes my heart happy and I can't thank you enough.
Draco gave him a stern look, effectively answering his question. Draco rolled his eyes then. Harry had definitely heard his fair share of horror stories about their relationship, some even from Draco himself.
Why Malfoy always changed in the bathroom, why he was always massaging his left side. Why Blaise gave him so much crap for not changing in front of Harry, and why he had made it so obvious that Malfoy would only
Once everyone was outside the castle they travelled down towards the Forbidden Forest. They reached the end of the grounds where Hermione and Justin had a portkey waiting for them.
The pain Harry had felt, the pain Harry had caused Malfoy by using that spell, he never knew it was so horrible. If Harry could go back in time and stop himself from using it, he would. Not even Malfoy deserved that kind of pain, and Harry had been so naive to think he should use it.  The book had said ‘to use on enemies’ not a childhood rival. At the time, it had seemed life or death, but now Harry knew better.
The group laughed and since no one objected to that either, Ron and Blaise were chosen as Keeper and Chaser respectively. A quick coin flip had Draco choosing first.
Draco's expression didn't change as he spoke, "Harry, don't ask questions you won't like the answer to."
"Oh look!" Daphne pointed excitedly. Just a few places ahead was a group of adults with three little children. The children were dressed the same as Daphne, Sue, and Susan.
“Just the lads.” Blaise said as he slung an arm around them both. Draco rolled his eyes and shrugged the arm off. A small residual hint of animosity from the potion. Blaise mostly took it in stride, giving Draco a small frown but saying nothing.
“Good afternoon. Before we begin Mr. Potter, due to the nature of this lesson, you'll be paired with Mr. Malfoy for the time being.”
Today was just what Harry needed. Time away from the- though well meaning -overbearing nature of Ron and Hermione. Ginny didn't keep giving him sympathetic looks or imply that he should talk about his feelings. She didn't tip toe around him even though the anniversary was just around the corner. He knew
They pulled apart briefly before both closed the gap again. Draco let his hands drift into Harry's hair, tangling into the curls. The kiss was slow, neither making any real moves, just holding onto one another.
“Yes well, I wanted something the complete opposite of the Manor. And this place is just that.” Draco said, looking at his home with fresh eyes.
Draco let out a small laugh too, despite his brain short circling on him. "I should probably get home."
His friends could tell something was wrong of course. Ron and Hermione did their best to distract him but also tried to coax him to talk about it if he wanted to, which he rarely did. Harry just didn't want to burden them with his depressing thoughts, a result of the months they spent hunting horcruxes. And their signature "we're worried about you Harry" faces had only become more frequent. He knew it wasn't a conscious thing on their end, but sometimes he felt like he was living under a microscope.
LOL literally smallest edit right here to say, can you tell how much I adore Pansy Parkinson?? This chapter is like my little ode to her. I love the way the Drarry Community has made her such a great, flawed, beautiful character. All the slytherins in this fic really, I love them all thanks to the work the fandom has put behind them. Anyway, see you next chapter!! Think there are just 2 left now!
“Don’t worry, I know. I barely spend any time here. I basically just sleep here. I knew I had to move out of the Burrow once Ron did, and Grimlaud isn’t exactly a place I want to be.”
Changing the subject, Harry asked about their roommate situations as they headed for the Great Hall.
Harry and Ron had led them to the Honeydukes secret passageway. After some minor complaints, mainly from Ron, the four climbed through carefully and arrived in the Honeydukes cellar.
Despite everything in Harry telling him to comfort Malfoy, he knew that would only lead to something terrible.
Harry nodded and the four walked to the Great Hall together in a content silence. When they walked in, a few heads turned and watched as they made their way to the Eight Year table. Pansy and Millicent went to the left, to sit next to Malfoy and Blaise, while Harry and Ron went to the right to sit with Hermione and Neville.
Harry nodded. He remembered Sixth Year when Malfoy would feign illness to get out of matches and then ultimately stopped being part of the team.
We're halfway through now, next chapter will be up Friday and it is quite the ride if I do so so myself ;)
Nobody answered as they gazed around the room. It seemed everyone was too scared to break whatever spell they were under. Harry too was in awe of the room. Large couches surrounded the fireplace, reminiscent of Gryffindor. There was a comfortable study nook in one of the high windows and a few high tables about for studying or hanging out. Plants of various nature hung about the space. Stools and pillows were scattered around the room and multiple rugs covered the stone floor.
“Excuse me, Potter. I’ve made the first move plenty of times. I’m the one who kissed Nolan on New Years, I asked him to be my boyfriend a few weeks later, I made the first move with Nott, technically I’m the reason Pansy and-”
in their lives”. That had made Draco scoff and down one of the shots that had been brought to the table.
His brain would not stop picturing Malfoy and Nott. Sitting in the Slytherin dorms. Snogging. Their bodies pressed together tightly, clothes beginning to peel away. Harry could feel his cock begin to swell.
They neared the grave, snow beginning to fall, and Harry felt his stomach fall at the sight. The tomb was covered in beautiful bouquets, letters, and small trinkets. Harry, their only son, had brought nothing.
Harry turned away from him, feeling utterly confused, and stripped into his pajamas. Blaise followed suit and after a few minutes, Malfoy walked back into the room, a hand massaging his heart over a silk pajama shirt. Harry scoffed to himself, of course Malfoy would have silk pajamas. Harry looked down at his own clothes, an old Chudley Cannons t-shirt and a pair of pants that were slightly too big on him. If you asked Harry, he was much more comfortable.
Blaise either didn't notice or didn't care. “Leaving just to change? Why not disrobe in front of us, I'm sure Potter wouldn't mind.”
Harry focused on his potion and didn't look up until he had finished. By that time, Slughorn called for everyone to stop, and he began grading everyone's potions.
Draco’s eyes locked onto his dark mark, still so prominent after all these years on his pale skin. Only now it was placed in between two other tattoos, the ancient runes carefully traced across his skin.
Of course, there were things they did learn. Harry preferred to shower at night, Draco in the morning. Draco had once wished to be Potions Master at Hogwarts and Harry thought about becoming an Auror. Neither of them actually enjoyed Pansy’s “signature” drink (quite literally just vodka, lemonade, and practically an entire salt lick on the rim) yet neither refuse when she brings one to the table.
Draco chuckled. “As if I could ever grow tired of you, Pansy,” he said, hugging her briefly before reaching for her trunk.
“Okay,” Draco breathed. He turned toward Potter, who had an almost fond expression on his face. “Thank you.”
The first Quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor came soon enough, and Draco wasn’t upset when Potter won, catching the Snitch right out from under Draco’s reaching hand as he always seemed to do.
Draco had heard enough. He didn’t much care for politics, and his mother was in need of a strong cup of tea.
“Dobby,” said Draco to the warm, mid-evening air of his bedroom. He had spent the last several hours locked inside, mentally writing and tweaking his instructions so they would be clear.
So Potter suddenly didn’t want the attention, did he? Showed what Granger knew. Potter practically begged people to stare at him, what with the way he hunched his shoulders to appear humble, or how he hardly ever made eye contact so that people talking to him would want to find his eyes, or how he made a show of dragging his hair over his forehead to hide his lightning bolt scar, or—
“Didn’t you notice?” said Draco, reclaiming his seat by the window. The train shuddered as it went around a bend. “Potter isn’t here.”
“I am, only…” Potter gave a breathy laugh, and a splotchy pink spread across his cheeks. “I came in here fully prepared to kiss Draco Malfoy, but somehow I keep forgetting you’re wearing my body. I look at you — or myself, really — and I see your smirk and the way you walk… Do you know how confusing it is to look at what’s essentially yourself and want that person anyway?”
“Yessir,” he said, sleepily opening his eyes. They widened as he started to slip off one of the fractured strips of flooring. He turned back to Draco, who winced.
. Not only because he had never gotten used to seeing another person’s reflection, but because he had never figured out how Potter got that levity in his eyes, or how he held himself: somehow shy and proud at the same time.
TLDR: abuse is never okay, in any form. Unfortunately, if we're trying to keep this relatively canon-compliant, Draco needs to have this nonreaction to Dobby's abuse, and even his own part in that. Doesn't mean that he can't change in the future, but this is how I think he'd behave at this time.
Crossing back into his bedroom, Draco grabbed some tissues and set about cleaning himself up. He breathed deeply, stared at himself in the mirror, watched the space around his irises turn slowly from red to pink to white. When he was satisfied he looked relatively normal, he crossed to the balcony and shut the doors, making sure to adjust the sheer curtains to block as much of the flowers from view as he could. Then he called for Dobby.
Draco shrugged. “Sounds good to me, sir.” At this point, he was confident he could distract Professor Snape from anything…unsavoury that might pop into his head.
Weasley dropped his stack into his sister’s cauldron, turning as red as she still was. He lunged toward Draco, but Potter and Granger held him back.
get the information he wanted. It was only a matter of time before Granger let something slip about Potter— something Draco didn’t already know…
Mr Malfoy’s eyes creased with a hidden smile, but he said nothing. Draco’s mother had a similar expression.
“We did,” Draco said roughly. His bread, too heavy with soup, broke off at the crust and plopped into his bowl. He jabbed at it with his spoon.
“I know,” Professor Snape said, his eyes softening. “I know you wanted those memories to work. Still, I must ask you to make a small sacrifice for the sake of the larger picture.”
“Do you have another suggestion?” Professor Snape said, his nostrils flaring. “Something you feel as strongly about keeping to yourself?”
Mr Malfoy’s smile remained, but it no longer reached his eyes. “I see.” He rested a hand on Draco’s shoulder and steered him in the direction of the staircase, away from the people clustered right at the entrance. “Do you have your booklist?”
“I suppose we could keep trying this, but I don’t want to make either of you uncomfortable,” said Madam Pomfrey. “I’ll keep you under observation for a day or so, but there’s nothing physically wrong with you, apart from…well.
“So,” she said softly. “What do you want to know about Draco? I assume he only gave you the most basic information about himself, but I’ve been there for the greatest hits— I can enlighten you.”
Dobby held out quelling hands. “You must exercise greater caution. In order for your plan to continue—”
“No. It was merely curiosity on my part. But it’s late,” Professor Snape announced, “and you are tired. As am I.”
A peculiar sensation began in Draco’s chest, like his ribs were vibrating against each other. Was he visible in the picture? He had been right there, after all. Draco scanned the station’s columns for a flash of an elbow, evidence of shuffling feet, shifting shadows, fingers that curled around the stone and into frame — anything that betrayed him as an eavesdropper —  and was pleased to note that the picture had been taken at just the right angle to obscure him from view. When Draco’s parents weren’t looking, he slid the entire page up his shirt.
“Didn't think you liked veal, Harry,” said Longbottom, after Draco had served himself a large helping of it.
Their friend group had been going to Cara’s for months now, and damn if he wasn’t hungry. They walked the few blocks in a mostly casual silence. Draco hoped Harry couldn’t see the tension in his body, hoped he was presenting as somewhat normal. In reality, he was freaking the fuck out.
“He loves me, he loves me not, he loves me, he loves me not…” Blaise called out with a smirk plastered on his face.
“Welcome back everyone to another year at Hogwarts.” she started, and the Hall erupted into cheers and claps of excitement.
“Mrs. Weasley, I checked all of our luggage twice. We're all set.” Hermione said confidently. Ron gave her a thankful smile as Mrs. Weasley finally let them board the train.
Ginny said her own goodbye and Draco waved. The day those two finally got together would be a blessing on everyone. But until then, lunch “not dates” would have to do.
“Very good! Well then, Mr. Zabini, congratulations! You've earned this potion.” Slughorn announced, and began clapping. Polite applause followed and then the class began packing their bags as Blaise transferred his potion into a vial.
A Stinging Hex had hit Blaise right on the corner of his mouth. Draco was standing in the doorway, eyes narrowed and his jaw clenched. He stared at Blaise as if he had just insulted Draco’s mother. Without sparing a glance at Harry, Draco turned away and slammed the door shut.
“Since this is your last year, and seeing as I would have been your teacher all seven years, I thought it would be only fitting to have me for one more class.” McGonagall said, rather matter of factly, but her eyes were shining.
He raised his eyebrows and continued, “I only meant so we felt more comfortable than if we kissed for the first time in front of people.”
He thought back to that day, all the emotions he felt creeping back in. The terror, the anger, despair. The true fear in Draco’s face as Lucius excitedly brought him closer to examine Harry’s distorted face. The sheer horror turned into total confusion when Draco didn’t identify him. When Draco claimed he
The more they talked the more both felt increasingly exposed. Draco was shocked at how much Harry knew about him just from observation alone. And he was surprised at how much he himself knew about the other man despite doing his best these past two years to distance them.
“Mum...Dad...” Harry started but couldn’t find the words. He closed his eyes and traced his hand over their names as his tears began to fall. He dropped his head to rest against the cold grave and shivered through his tears. The thin material of his costume clung to him as the snow fell on it, making Harry that much more cold.
He walked down a random aisle to try and compose himself. Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath in and a slow breath out. The memory of Malfoy clutching Harry’s sides filled his brain as the smoke seemed to engulf him once again. He could feel the fire licking at his face as they frantically flew forward. As bad as that was, the worst part of that memory was Malfoy’s terrified whisper as the fire came closer.
Millicent and Dean's matching pirate costumes were already a hit, everyone trying to steal their plastic swords and fight.
George was all too excited when the group showed up, albeit surprised to see Pansy and Millicent with them. Millicent explained their grand party ideas, and George was immediately put at ease.
Harry climbed into the other one and began washing his hair as he tried not to think about seeing Malfoy today. What was he supposed to do? He had spent the whole night listening to him cry, but he couldn’t act like he had. But everything in Harry was telling him to make sure Malfoy was alright, even if it was, well, Malfoy.
Harry's prediction on how the costume would look was right but amplified ten fold in person. The delicate nature of the costume softened Draco's usual sharp exterior. The long dress and flowy cape were delicately draped over him. His arms, molded by years of Quidditch, looked more defined when draped in thin golden chains. The golden laurel crown placed upon his head appeared almost as a halo.
Draco nodded, “Right, then Blaise and I opened our shop the following January, and Luna opened her shop that summer.”
"We love your costumes!" Susan said warmly. The three little girls giggled and their parents looked on happily.
him. Or more accurately, his emotions. A stream of nervousness that was not Harry’s own ran through his body.
The group followed behind. Everyone was looking about in excitement despite the park being just a regular park. As they got closer to the road people began popping up.
Getting back to his normal nightly routine, Harry woke up in a cold sweat, his nightmare already fading from his mind. However, it wasn’t one of his nightly horrors, instead the Hogwarts bathroom floated through his mind, with a specific Slytherin boy bleeding out on the ground.
. There was absolutely no lack of chemistry between the two of them in those moments. All of their frustrations with one another were let out in the most illicit ways.
“Class, quiet down, we can have fun after the brewing is done!” Slughorn reminded but he still had that cheery smile on his face.
"Piss off," Ginny laughed as she playfully pushed him, "Half of them have played on the team with you, remember?"
The Eighth Years were all looking around humbly, not knowing what to do. The only people not subtly basking in the attention were the Slytherins.
“I’m afraid I don’t have anything like that, Nott just keeps to himself when he’s in there. Not a bad bloke, just quiet. What about you, Harry?”
"We did." Harry answered with a smile. The bartender placed two drinks in front of Draco, who handed her a tenner and gratefully accepted his change.
“I'm sure you're all waiting to run to your dormitories, which is exactly why I'm here. This year, due to the fact each dormitory was only built to hold seven years of students, a new dormitory has been provided for all of you in the West Wing.”
Harry looked up at him, expecting to see a glare being thrown at him, but instead Malfoy had an almost smile? Harry responded with his own grin, and opened his mouth to respond but was cut off by Professor Deadra.
Draco tore his gaze away from Harry when Ginny spoke. His face changed from the unknown expression into a scowl instantly.
“I have actually. Hermione was around this morning and Pansy told her yesterday.” A pause, then Harry continued.
Ginny pursed her lips as to not smile but said, “That’s who I was leaning towards too. She’s almost as good as you.”
The two sat like that for a long time, snow settling around them, as Harry cried and Draco comforted him.
Harry woke up the next morning feeling dead. He didn’t even remember falling asleep, but he knew it couldn't have been very long. He had watched the sun come up, and Malfoy had gotten up then too.
“Oh, well, we've got to go. Ron said you two would go to Flourish and Blott’s with Dad while I get my robes. Hermione should be there by now too.”
Harry was sure he had never heard Theo speak so much. It was almost infuriating, he thought to himself as he laughed along to the story Daphne was recalling, how charming each of the Slytherins seemed to be. It really wasn’t fair but moreover it made Harry’s stomach twist at the thought that had things been different, they would have been friends long ago.
Harry raised his eyebrows, staring at Draco with slight confusion. Draco could feel his face beginning to heat up but he ignored it.
"Alright?" Harry asked, looking at Draco and not paying any mind to the man in front of him. He placed Draco's wreath back on his head.
"I was wondering, now that captains have been announced, if you would want to come to tryouts? I know it's not the same as actually being on the team, but I could really use your eye. We've gotta get a new seeker after all."
to see them. And not make a big deal out of it. To hold him while he cried, to bring flowers for them. Having Draco be the one to do all those things felt foreign in Harry’s mind, but he was grateful.
“Good morning class. I'm sure you were all expecting Professor Niehaus, but I spoke to her privately and she has agreed to allow me to teach you.”
“Tea?” Harry asked, not bothering to wait for a response and instead walking to the kitchen with Draco right behind him.
Harry stood at the appropriate distance, raised his wand and, after giving Malfoy a final look of confirmation, cast the spell and felt himself be sucked into Malfoy’s brain.
Harry couldn't help his face heating up. "We never had like, full on sex, but did a lot of the lead up? It's kind of awkward going down on your girlfriend when her mum, dad, and six brothers are in the next room."
“And make sure no one tries to buy it. I'll have Fenrir Greyback come by to ensure your cooperation.”
Despite Malfoy being excused by his trial and by Harry himself, Ron still held quite a bit of animosity towards him. Not that Harry blamed him, since Malfoy hadn't proved to be the most angelic over the years, but Harry was determined to give everyone a second chance.
Harry took in the sight of the Great Hall and smiled. He hadn't realised just how much he missed everything about Hogwarts, down to even the benches they sat on.
"Mum had me in lessons when I was younger," Draco added, "nothing like this though. It was all classical Pureblood ballroom shite."
Everyone continued talking over one another, trying to one up the last story with their own. It was quite something listening to their stories as they each tried to embarrass each other.
"He would never agree to it. And besides, I don't want to go with Potter. Who would even believe that?"
Draco rolled his eyes and lightly pushed him so he could draw his own name. Harry waited intently. Draco’s small smile turned into a frown as he read it.
The group sat around and drank, taking in the scene around them. A second round of drinks was brought soon after and a few of the Eighth Years took their drinks to the dance floor.
Draco nodded, “Kissing, hand holding, all that type of stuff. Since we are supposed to have been dating for the past six months, we have to seem comfortable with at least a basic level of intimacy. I’m not saying we need to snog in front of the entire wedding party, but perhaps holding hands wouldn’t be unheard of.”
One day as Harry was walking back to the Common Room after a quick library session, Ginny stopped him.
Harry ran in and down to his room, throwing the door open and running to his trunk. He rummaged around it, throwing his clothes left and right, galleons flying out of one of his robes. A Chudley Cannons jersey flew over to Blaise’s bed and his own old Quidditch jersey got tossed behind him.
“Sleep tight Harry, you’ll be looking at two winners tomorrow night.” Blaise said as they got into bed that night.
Remembering what Blaise had said to him earlier, Draco spoke again, “Actually there is one more thing we really need to talk about. How...intimate we want to get.”
A little shameless self promo if you want to read a more in depth version of Harry and Draco talking about his sectumsempra scars and Draco's parents, my fic "For every question why, you were my Because" has all of that goodness. I just couldn't fit it in organically to this one since they've already been friends for a bit.
He got out of bed an hour later, after watching the sunrise for the second day in a row. Quietly, he grabbed his clothes and toiletries before heading to the bathroom. As he got ready he could hear shuffling about as his roommates slowly got themselves dressed. Blaise walked in not soon after Harry finished brushing his teeth.
Ginny still hadn't returned when the train began moving but that wasn't uncommon. She was probably fending off all her adoring fans, Neville had said with a laugh. He had looked at Harry nervously after, but Harry was too busy laughing along to notice.
"We'll have to make a right team, I'm already thinking Dean, Susan, and Pavarti so far. Well rounded." Ron rattled on.
Wolf whistles died down as Blaise moved out of the way and Draco stepped forward. For all the camp and overly sexual nature of Blaise's costume, Draco's costume was the complete opposite.
“Please...take your seats.” Flitwick said and then resumed his introduction. Or well, tried to. The Eighth Years were all staring at the pair in the doorway.
In a flash, Draco slapped Blaise so hard he had fallen onto Ron and Pansy’s laps. It was the first thing Malfoy had done since they got there.
However when the three of them walked into class, Harry realised that wasn’t going to be the case. He had gone to sit next to Ron when Blaise swooped in beside him.
Finally Harry said, "Alright this is only going to be as awkward as we let it." and he rose from his chair.
“We took the liberty of getting photos of all the costumes for you all. Muggle pictures, so don’t be expecting them to twirl around for you.” Justin said. He and Hermione started passing out the photos to the correct groups, and everyone was giggling and laughing as they shared.
Draco let out a huff and rolled his eyes. He was an excellent kisser, Potter just mucked up their first go.
Harry paid and then they joined back up with Ron to walk over to Flourish and Blott’s, Harry clutching his purchase tightly.
“Justin and I were just talking, and we have an idea.” She said as she leaned over excitedly. Harry sat in the armchair beside them as Justin continued.
Harry rolled his eyes but got into bed anyway, closing his curtains slightly and placing his glasses on his nightstand.
“It’s getting pretty late now. Do you want to come over to my place tomorrow, we can go over some more things. Like things we should know about each other after six months of dating.” Harry said as he stood up and stretched.
“I’m not sure how familiar you are with Pureblood tradition, but weddings are usually a four day event. A lot of mingling with the other guests, which is why I’m sure you can tell I can’t just ask any one man to be my date. It needs to be logical, Purebloods are always waiting to catch someone in a lie.”
A few moments later Malfoy stilled, and Harry glanced at him through the mirror. Malfoy’s hand was still raised to his hair, but he was staring at Harry through his own mirror. When they made eye contact, Malfoy’s eyes widened for a millisecond before he schooled his features. He gave his hair one more flick before quickly gathering his brush and other items and leaving the bathroom.
And maybe, on nights when Draco allowed himself the thought, perhaps the reason he was so cautious was out of fear of the unknown. About his own feelings...but those nights were few and far in between.
At least Millie seemed to be over the hilarity of the situation, “Are you sure he’s the best choice? You know, considering...everything.”
“Gregory's Unctuous Unction causes the taker to believe the giver is their best friend. Depending on how well it is brewed, the potion can last almost 48 hours.” Padma answered.
"Just a reminder," the man who had been collecting the money earlier came up to the stage, "our annual costume contest will begin in an hour. If anyone still wants to sign up, last chance!"
He heard Millie sigh from beside him, “That’s what I’m worried about Draco. You were kind of...obsessed with Potter for like three years.”
"Regular House teams have already been sorted and so this match will not be played by individual members of each team. Instead, our Eighth Years will be competing!"
“And why, Blaise, are you boring him with those stories?” Malfoy’s voice held no emotion as he spoke, much to Blaise’s apparent glee.
That statement had left several shocked gasps in the room, and Harry felt like he was the one on trial.
The students dispersed and began looking. Michael called out to Anthony, and the two sat at their new desk. Millicent sat down and grabbed Neville's arm as he passed and pulled him into the seat next to her.
“That's pretty intense Harry.” Hermione said after Harry finished relaying Malfoy’s Battle of Hogwarts memory.
It was more than Harry expected. All the students from his year were offered apprenticeships from the Ministry, as well as in various Wizarding establishments around the world. Harry knew already that Lisa Turpin and Fay Dunbar were currently training in Romania under Charlie Weasley.
Throughout the Ceremony and Feast, Draco and Harry shared more secret glances. There was no hate behind them. There was
Hermione wrapped him into a hug and kissed his cheek. Harry kissed the top of her head and then they continued with the list.
Pansy had met up with Draco after also going to Madam Puddifoot’s with Padma and the pair had, as Pansy said, “had a long talk about various
Harry's eyes instantly locked with Malfoy's as Ron shook him in excitement. He and Draco stared at each other in disbelief before smiling widely.
“Muggle games, party games, call it what you will, they’re all basically the same. But yeah, we used to play all kinds of things. Spin the bottle, truth or dare, seven minutes in heaven. Of course we’d add some type of magic elements. Adds a bit more flare if you ask me.”
Seamus and Hannah looked beyond adorable in their Peter Pan and Tinkerbell looks. Dean kept peppering Seamus' face with kisses as they got ready. Harry wasn't sure whether to be surprised or not at all surprised when Pansy managed to make her Luke Skywalker costume sexy.
Now the fun begins!! As always, thanks for reading and please do leave a comment, they warm my heart like no other! Let me know what you think so far and what you think will happen next <3
Harry could only watch the two of them duel and silently plead to himself not to do it, but it was no use.
“Yeah, sorry. Back on track.” Harry was still grinning, “How about it was a mutual getting together. After a few months of...tenuous friendship we realized we had more in common than we ever let ourselves know. And slowly we crossed the line between friendship and relationship.”
The room was pretty dark, save flashing multicolored lights. The bar opposite the dance floor had a bit more lighting but the overall atmosphere was rather hard to see in.
Harry looked around the room at his classmates. Pansy and the Patil twins were doing homework at one of the tables. Or rather, the twins were doing homework while Pansy was staring at Padma with a soft smile. Daphne and Theo were laying down on one of the other couches, Theo running his hands softly through her hair while Daphne snuggled into his neck.
His favorite photo though, had been since the day he got it, was the one of all three of them. Harry being held by his mother as his father waved his little hand for the camera. All three had big smiles on their faces. When Harry was younger his parents had seemed so old. Looking at these photos now they seemed barely older than he was now.
Once they began, Harry took off to the skies. He had missed the feeling of flying and being up this high. Harry stayed above the players, getting a birds eye view of how they flew, interacted with one another, and overall placement on the Pitch. He and Ginny rotated spots multiple times throughout the four hour tryout. Harry called out a few helpful hints and tips but overall let Ginny take the lead.
That in itself brought even more despair to Harry. He had no memories of his own of them. All he had at this point were these photos and stories from Sirius and the Order.
Draco let out a small sound of approval as his dish was opened. A plate of roast chicken and vegetables, one of his favorite meals from Cara’s. He didn’t even have to look up to know what Harry had gotten. A chicken, rice, and bean wrap, hold the tomato.
Then there was Millicent Bulstrode. Her and Hermione had gotten into more than one altercation throughout the years. She was also a constant in the heckling and taunts thrown out by her best friend, Pansy.
Draco was able to move again, but he remained on the floor. He could not meet Pansy’s searching gaze.
invisibility cloak, then?” said Blaise, eyeing it with clear envy. “It looks different than the ones I’ve seen in the shops. Where did you get it? How long have you had it?”
Draco shook his head and lurched backward as if struck. “What are you doing with those?” he asked, almost accusing. “Did he not want them?”
They both froze at the sound of people entering the dormitory. Harry was suddenly reminded of where he was, and how dangerous it was for him to be there.
Draco looked up at the golden constellations painted on his dark ceiling. His father had commissioned them when Draco failed a primary school Astronomy test, to teach him the stars and planets he had missed. It had worked; Draco could now identify everything his father deemed most important to learn. And, like the Great Hall of Hogwarts, the painted stars on Draco’s ceiling were spelled to shift as real stars did, almost imperceptibly. Sometimes, when he couldn’t sleep, he would lie on his back and watch them twinkle. They were a pleasant reminder that the universe far exceeded his small bedroom, that his troubles were equally small.
Draco seized his water glass and took a large gulp, but he was shaking so much that he ended up spilling half of it onto himself. Cursing, he leapt out of bed to change.
Draco was glad to be so early. It gave him the opportunity to steady himself, which he did by watching students and their parents come through the stone barrier in small groups, and keeping an eye out for Potter. He didn’t look away once— not when Crabbe and Goyle ambled in and sat across from him, nor when Pansy arrived and started comparing the colour of all their arms, declaring it a good thing that Draco was by the window: “That way,” she said, “you’ll get some sun. You need to get out more, darling, you haven’t tanned at all over the summer.”
By the time Draco had given his father several old tomes to buy, the shop had filled almost to bursting. He was glad of his position on the balcony above everyone until he realised the exit would soon be completely blocked. Wizards were pushing each other and clamouring to enter the full shop; a harried-looking wizard was trying his best to control them, saying, “Yes, yes, form a queue… Calmly, please, gentlemen… Don’t push there…mind the books, now…”
Draco flinched, stopping with his fingers a breath away from the handle. He wished he'd had more time, he had been so close!
“Right.” Madam Pomfrey made a sweeping motion with her wand and curtains closed around their beds, isolating them from the rest of the hospital. “You two have been here enough times to know where my office is. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to come get me, or to shout.
“Oi! Potter!” Harry called. Malfoy stopped and turned to look at him. “How do you like my hair?” Harry ran a careful hand through his bangs, putting more focus on the act of touching it than messing up the style. He was pleased to see Malfoy’s lips purse in distaste.
For the first time since collecting Potter’s letters, Draco felt a strong compulsion to write one in response. He wouldn’t want to see Granger either, and felt the childish need to tell her that. Among other things. Like how boring she was, or that her intelligence really meant nothing if all she did was repeat things she read in books. True knowledge was incorporating your own views and ideas into what was given, and thus far, Draco hadn't seen any signs she was capable of doing that. No one liked a parrot.
Before Harry could respond, Madam Pomfrey opened her door. “Oh, good, you’re awake,” she said, bustling over. “How are you feeling?”
Mr Malfoy checked the time again. “Better be quick about it, wouldn’t want to be stuck in this infernal place for too long,” he said with a sneer, eyeing a nearby stack of mouldering papers with great disdain. “Give me your list, I’ll find those books while you look for the others.”
The anger dropped from her face. “He’s not? But how will he get to Hogwarts?” She inclined her head. “Have you, you know…done something?”
Only this time, Draco was more disturbed by it. This time, he had made the conscious — or at least, semi-conscious — choice to kiss Potter. Before, he had been able to excuse his actions as part of his dreams — they weren’t real and didn’t signify anything — but it was a lot harder to fall back on that explanation now.
“Now,” Madam Pomfrey said, turning around. She huffed. “Let’s see if I can’t stop this.” And she began examining the pair of them, every so often trying spells to stop the changes. It was only after their noses and chins had switched that she decided to call it a night.
Pansy shrugged, then leaned back in her armchair, turning to toss her legs carelessly over one side. Her dark nightgown fluttered through the air. “It’s the fastest way to turn back.”
was what he had been waiting for, he wanted to be able to defend himself more completely. Using distractions was well good, but Draco didn’t want to depend on someone else lifting the spell for it to end. He wanted to do that himself.
“I know. But Ron already knew, and of course he was going to tell me… And look,” said Hermione, holding up a set of robes, “we also came to give these to Harry. You’ll let us at least do that, won’t you?”
His face grew hotter as he crossed into the dormitory, where he was met with the conflicting sight of Potter, shirtless, bending down to rummage through Draco’s trunk. Immediately, Draco faced the wall and tried not to think about what it meant that he’d found that attractive— no matter that it had been Potter in that body, he still looked like Draco Malfoy.
“You tried very hard to protect that memory,” Professor Snape said, bringing Draco back to the present.
He hadn’t, actually — not explicitly — but Draco figured now wasn’t the time to bring that up. “What’s the good if I’m not on the House team?” he said with a glance at the cabinet on the far wall. “Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. He’s not even that good, it’s just because he’s
“Yes. Let’s try this a couple more times, favouring your tactile senses over the others, but we’ll let the spell last longer.”
“Well, you keep talking about him, is it really any wonder that my mind continues to go where it does?” Draco said.
A mustachioed man, joined by a tall woman and a blonde boy, appeared next to Potter. The man was frowning so fiercely it seemed to have turned his face purple from the effort. Gruffly, he asked, “Ready, are you?”
All the things Draco wanted to do — grab Potter’s thin hands, ask if he was okay, take him somewhere for a proper meal, take him home for the rest of the summer — were dismissed the second Draco thought of them. And any concern he might have been able to slip into his tone of voice, or his wording, was out of the question with Ginny there. She glared up at him with eyes full of privilege, like she knew Potter better than Draco ever would.
“Actually, I quite thought I pulled it off,” said Malfoy, pulling the curtains aside so they could see the rest of the hospital wing. “Harry Potter doesn’t look half bad in silk. Granted, you would need to get the proper size—”
The crowd below started whispering and looking around. Their movements created a clear view to Potter; he was near Lockhart’s table. Lockhart leapt forward and seized Potter’s arm, dragging him to the front. He murmured something to Potter and then, shaking his hand, posed for the photographer. So many pictures were taken in succession that Draco had to blink against the spots that appeared behind his eyes.
, because what use was complaining about his boundaries when the Dark Lord wouldn’t respect them? Wasn’t it worth giving up a tiny bit more of his privacy if it meant mastering Occlumency? Didn’t he owe it to his mother to try harder than this?
“Blasted elf,” said Mr Malfoy under his breath. He reached for the wine bottle. “I made it clear that Dobby was not to—” He shook his head, setting the bottle aside. “But that is an issue I will deal with later. We will be travelling to Burgundy.
Draco whirled around to examine his reflection. His dark hair was messy, but no more so than usual, and his glasses weren’t crooked on the bridge of his nose. He couldn’t see anything out of place with his robes or tie, either. “Why are you laughing?” he demanded.
“Oh, it’s you,” said Weasley, ruining the moment when he appeared suddenly from the throng with Granger, their arms laden with Lockhart’s books. “Bet you’re surprised to see Harry here, eh?”
Freezing with one foot above the next step, Draco looked down at himself. His excitement dulled. “Why, what’s wrong with this?”
“And why not, Father?” Draco pushed away a bottle of wine as it tried to pour itself into his glass. Offended, it flew out of reach. “Can’t I hum if I’m in a good mood?”
, and entered a fantasy he hadn’t let himself fully create: Potter’s winning smile being directed at him, instead of at unworthy
In the days leading up to the Malfoys’ trip to London, Draco spent even more time in their library. On the whole, the lack of concrete details authors could provide about the Chamber, and the use of the same sort of phrases over and over again, was frustrating. Aside from the suspicious death of a Hogwarts student in 1943, there was no real proof it existed, but if Draco’s father believed it was real, Draco thought he should assume the same.
“You don’t have it,” said Mrs Malfoy cooly. As she leaned forward, some of her blonde hair fell over one shoulder. “Eliminating Muggle-borns will not make your blood any purer.”
After dinner, Harry followed Pansy down to the Slytherin dorms. Or rather, she dragged him there by the arm. Someone up ahead of them said the password, and they entered into a surprisingly cozy room. The windows backed against the lake, which gave the space a warm, greenish glow; the floor was covered in black and silver rugs that Harry could tell would be quite pleasant to sit on; and there were plenty of dark green chairs and couches scattered about that reminded Harry of the ones in Gryffindor Tower. There was even a fireplace in the far corner.
“Why do you give a toss about Potter’s family?” Pansy asked. “Not so long ago, you might have said he deserved what he’s got.”
The elf appeared between them on the seat, looking concerned. “Master Draco. Have you forgotten something? Dobby can fetch it for you.”
Draco clutched the arms of his chair, breathing heavily. His pale hair clung to his paler forehead with sweat. “Why…do you keep going after my worst memories?”
Professor Snape’s nostrils widened and his thin mouth twitched. “Very funny. Luckily for you, I am determined to make some headway tonight. Go take a walk around the dungeons and come back when you've calmed down. We will try again, and I hope for your sake that you think of something different.
There was little progress to be had during that meeting, but that was okay. As Professor Snape said, before Draco left for the night, “There is every hope that using a different sense, like sound, might cause you to notice something you haven’t before. It does not matter that, for me, my signal for invaders is a cold hand on my neck. We will discover what your particular signal is; give it time.”
“Don’t say that. It makes me think you’ve stopped listening again.” Pansy nudged Draco with a brown sandal. “If you keep ignoring me like this, I’m going to start taking it personally. I’ll be forced towards the conclusion that you’d rather be friends with, imagine the horror,
“Madam Pomfrey,” Draco said, nodding to her. He went to stand on the other side of the bed and was unruffled to see Potter there, looking up at him with cold, grey eyes. His nose bore the pinkish marks of the nibs on his glasses, which he had in his fist.
“You can’t be serious, Lucius?” said a thin voice Draco didn’t recognise. “I don’t imagine a mere Act would allow them into our homes. They would need some indication, some tip-off, that we even have what they’re looking for, no?”
“Right,” Draco said quietly, turning back toward his plate. Very slowly, he cut a bite-sized piece of waffle and forced himself to chew. It was dry, and scraped unpleasantly when he swallowed it.
Harry snickered at the thought of Malfoy testing out different walks in front of the same mirror. “Were you coaching him, too?”
“So you have the means to control this monster’s every action, do you? Every breath it takes, every blink? Do you even know what it is? No one has ever confirmed what creature lives inside the Chamber— tell me that you, at least, have a better idea.”
Mrs Weasley glanced over. “You must be Harry’s family!” She made a motion as if she meant to shake his hand, but then, at the last second, thought better of it.
After he’d showered and changed, Draco waited for Potter outside the Gryffindor changing rooms. “Congratulations, Potter,” he said when he saw the boy. He stretched out a hand. “Another great save; you deserve the win.”
“Thank Merlin we don't have to switch pants,” Malfoy said suddenly, “I don't think I could handle you in mine.”
“Open it back up for me.” Draco did as he was told. Mrs Malfoy tapped the parchment three times with her wand. “
Draco leaned forward so fast he risked falling off the second level. Potter was here? Where? He hadn’t seen Potter come in…
The elf’s eyes narrowed with uncertainty. “Yes, sir,” he said, and then, after a pause, “Would you like Dobby to clear these too?”
“I’ll say it again,” Mr Malfoy said darkly, “the Weasleys are of the lowest possible class of wizard— far lower, in some ways, than even Mudbloods.
“You will be successful eventually. With more practice, you can use more substantial protections; there’s no reason to be ashamed—”
“Hm?” He opened his eyes against the brightness of the compartment. Pansy was staring at him. “What is it, Pansy?”
“Cheers,” Draco said, handing over his assignment. Maybe Granger wasn’t so bad. “What else do you do for him?”
that?” Potter countered, still kneeling at Draco’s bedside. “Why did it all suddenly get faster? Was it brought on by contact, or proximity, or—”
“—This plan the Dark Lord has entrusted to your father…” Mrs Malfoy was saying, “I have a plan in case He is unhappy with the results.”
Mrs Malfoy started up one of the staircases. “And you’re sure he didn’t leave Flourish and Blotts, or give the diary to someone there?”
“I’m sorry, sir,” Draco said, breathing heavily again. He felt very close to tears; he hadn’t had time to get over that last memory. “I thought I’d found a couple good ones then.”
She reclined and crossed her legs, turning serious. “Do you have a plan, then? To stop the Chamber from being opened?”
Draco folded his arms. “Great, now we’re using euphemisms. Look, Potter, I meant what I said earlier. I don’t want to pressure you, and I certainly didn’t want to assume your harassing me had anything to do with righting things.”
Professor Snape said something else after that, but Draco didn’t hear it. The darkness of his eyelids gave way to streaks of colour and light, which quickly turned into less abstract images…it was like slipping into a dream—
Pushing aside his covers, Draco padded over to his desk, where he spent the next hour carefully resealing each letter. He had never used a Re-Sealing Charm before and it was really quite tedious, drawing his wand steadily over the uneven paper, healing the rips. Ultimately though, Draco was proud of his work. The letters looked as if they had never been opened. Potter wouldn’t suspect a thing.
Defeated, Draco threw himself onto his bed. He wondered how Dobby was faring. He had been gone for ages…
Both bits of dialogue I used this chapter are from Chamber of Secrets. The Borgin and Bukes scene is from chapter 4, "Flourish and Blotts" pp. 51-53, and the infamous Flourish and Blotts scene dialogue comes from pp. 58, 60-63
Suddenly, Pansy went limp; Draco caught her. “You’re clearly hiding something,” she said, sliding out of his grasp, “and I’m going to find out what.”
“All right, all right, don’t get your knickers in a twist. Follow my lead.” He winked at Potter and then shoved him, hard, into a couple of the passing students. “Ugh, I don’t have time for this, Malfoy! I need to get to class.” Draco started down the corridor, hoping Potter would follow him.
After a quick breakfast, Draco and his father set down their long gravel drive. Due to the protection charms in place around the manor, they waited until they had gone through the wrought-iron gates to Disapparate. Usually, they’d have taken their black and gold stagecoach into London, but their trip to Knockturn Alley demanded discretion.
, he found the experience a lot less alien than he’d been expecting. He’d assumed Malfoy slept on sheets so expensive they were uncomfortable, but Harry had been pleasantly surprised to discover Malfoy used the ones Hogwarts provided, too. And in the darkness, it was impossible to tell whether the curtains round Malfoy’s four-poster were red or green, or whether the snores he heard came from Crabbe or Ron.
“Better than last night,” said Harry. He could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him, but he continued to look at Madam Pomfrey.
If anyone would like to translate this into another language, feel free! Just please let me know and credit me as the author of the original English version.
“No, you listen to me,” Pansy interrupted. “When you told me about your plan, I thought, ‘Okay, here’s something I think Draco can manage. Sure, he’s a little overly determined to get Potter out of Hogwarts, but I can understand that. He thinks Potter’s annoying. Fine.’ But now…” She frowned. “Now, you’ve either changed your plan completely or Potter’s distracted you from it, and I can’t help thinking it’s that second thing.”
As they reached their last destination, Draco felt less and less sure he’d run into Potter again, but seeing the lines of people funnelling into Flourish and Blotts gave him some semblance of hope. A large banner draped above the front entrance of the building announced:
“Come, Draco,” Mr Malfoy called. “Good day to you, Mr Borgin. I’ll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.”
But Potter didn’t come through the barrier, Draco was sure of it. When the Weasleys arrived, Potter was missing. Draco stared at the stone wall, feeling the impact of each second as it passed, but no one else came.
tool; it takes a highly skilled Occlumens to be able to achieve this. And as you have demonstrated a great deal of natural skill in distractions, I have no doubt you can find success in this new area as well.”
Draco froze, knife stopping mid-cut. He and Potter hadn’t discussed food preferences. Of course, now that seemed a rather large oversight.
“Well, anyhow,” said Pansy, “it must have been important, seeing as it somehow distracted you from my” she posed comically, crooking an arm carelessly over a bent knee, “charming conversation skills. What were you thinking about?”
“Oh… O- only when Harry Potter burns food, sir. Or misbehaves, or…” Dobby winced. “Actually, sir, Harry Potter does not eat very much, from what Dobby sees.”
Draco stopped himself there. He wasn’t thick enough to pretend, even within his own mind, that his explanations weren’t thin. Potter couldn’t possibly like attention if he tried so hard to be invisible. Or maybe Draco’s problem was that, in the act of trying to be invisible, Potter stood out. Or more generally, that Potter just stood out to Draco in a different way than he did to most people…
“Yes, sir,” Draco said, pulling out his own wand. He turned it nervously in his palm. He hoped the memories he’d picked would work the way Professor Snape intended them to. The man had been nothing but supportive, yet Draco knew he could do better. He needed to do better.
“I…thought this might bring the two of you closer,” she said. “You weren’t listening to me— you fancy him, and this was another way to get you to realise it. He likes you too, you know.”
Reaching up, Draco pulled a string of yellow flowers toward himself, marvelling at their beauty in spite of the reason they were there. The flowers were incredibly soft and spherical, and their petals gave way to his fingers, bowing when he squeezed them. He let the string go and it slid across his palm; it swung back into place amongst the others, knocking them briefly out of place. Silently, Draco watched them until they came to rest.
signifying Dobby’s departure, Draco closed his eyes. He had always thought Potter looked underfed — in fact, it was common speculation among his fellow Slytherins that Potter was a picky eater, that none of the Hogwarts meals were good enough for him — but to find out that wasn’t an illusion created by clothing far too large for him…it was completely different. It was
Draco dropped his notebook back into his bag. “With all due respect, sir, what is it we’ll be doing, then?”
your memories with a great deal of anxiety. Extend that natural boundary beyond that which you do not want others to see.”
“You tried to keep Miss Parkinson from speaking, but it was an incomplete action— I could see her mouth moving. I didn’t catch what she said, but I can surmise that based on the context.” Professor Snape considered Draco. “You risked detention to give Potter a message about your—?”
He faced Dobby, who looked equal parts worried and horrified. “Take me to Weasley’s house,” Draco said, “I need to know if Potter’s really there.”
Harry and Pansy proceeded to have a very long, very animated conversation about Malfoy. Harry never thought he’d ever get on so well with a Slytherin, but it made a nice change, not being cut off by Ron or Hermione, who typically never even wanted to hear Malfoy’s name. Interestingly enough, Pansy seemed as passionate, if not more so, as Harry was about the topic. And she proved to be very insightful about Malfoy’s personality and habits, which Harry knew would be far more useful than merely working off of what Malfoy had offered.
“I don’t know,” said Draco, dropping his bag next to Potter’s on the floor, “but that latter one tells me I’m right about you: you
Her mouth dropped progressively as she read. “Oh,” she said finally. “Yes, here it is.” She turned the book so Draco could read it, and pointed to a small section at the very bottom of the page. “That second footnote, just there. I guess I got so excited by the whole idea, I must have missed it. The author really should have made that bigger.
After deciding that her attempts to describe Malfoy’s walk were “useless without a good mirror,” Pansy had led Harry through Malfoy’s empty dormitory and into the bathroom attached to it. There, she coached him on the various characteristics of Malfoy’s gait.
“Mm. I wouldn’t trust them with that,” Malfoy said. “Your best bet would be if Snape’s told Blaise or Pansy to do it. But even then,” he continued, tilting his head, “they’re not always reliable, either.”
Draco gripped the wooden arms of his chair so tightly it hurt, then relaxed his hands. “But you don’t
“No. I’m sorry, sir, but no exceptions will be made. You’ll have to wait until 12:30 like the rest of these people.”
“There…was a- a presence there… A shadow without a person attached. I’ve seen it before, but I never paid much attention to it, not until today. It…” Draco sat in his chair again. “It mattered more today.”
think Harry’s going to turn into you?” said Weasley, who didn’t seem to have heard what Madam Pomfrey said.
Professor Snape nodded. “Things that I have thus far tried to avoid— in this case…things centred around Potter.”
“But I can’t—” Draco dragged the sleeves of his school robes down over his hands. “Who knows how he’d react?”
Out on the platform, the queue of students waiting to enter the train station was so thick that, no matter how small Draco tried to make his body, every few seconds someone would
“I do, but there were also some things I was hoping to find while we’re here. I don’t know the names of some of them…more the general type of information I’m looking for.”
appeared on the parchment.) Draco was furious. His father had forced him into a decision he wasn’t prepared to make. Because of his father, lives would be at risk.
Professor Snape considered him, making Draco feel even more self-conscious. “Was that wandless magic?” he asked Draco. “In the forest?”
Harry glanced over his shoulder to find Malfoy standing only in his pants and looking thoughtfully at Harry’s. Harry covered as much of himself as he could. “Turn your back!”
Draco scoffed. This was no great secret, the school board had been alerted the moment Lockhart accepted the position at Hogwarts. Draco had known months ago, thanks to his father, who was a governor on the board. None of them had been sworn to secrecy, yet all of Flourish and Blotts seemed to be shocked and excited at the news.
Draco puffed his cheeks angrily. There had to be something in here somewhere, some instructions or a scribbled incantation…but no amount of hoping could make the diary do what he wanted.
THIS IS A PART ONE OF (possibly) THREE because I don’t know when I’ll finish the whole rewrite, or how long this will end up being. Rest assured that I have plenty of ideas, I just need to find the time and motivation to get the chapters out and get to a point where I’m happy with that section.
.’” Draco whispered the words as Potter mouthed them. He had stared at the photograph so many times, he’d unintentionally memorised the fragment. Then, transfixed, Draco watched Potter’s mouth grow wider, his eyes crease and become smaller. Seeing Potter smile was no rare thing, but this one was special— this one belonged to Draco and Draco alone.
“Of- of course not,” said Draco. Then, more softly, he added, “I didn’t mean anything by it, it was just a question.”
Then shame crashed over him, fast and heavy, like walking under a waterfall. He had completely forgotten to tell Dobby about warning the Muggle-borns off Hogwarts. No, he had been too busy thinking about how
people couldn’t be Potter’s relatives? They were white, for starters. Draco hadn’t been expecting that; Potter was many shades darker, more brown. And on top of that, his family were incredibly ugly. Potter, though Draco would never admit it aloud, could not possibly be described the same way.
convinced to go to Hogwarts when he discovered his friends really did care about him! And there was no telling what the monster of the Chamber of Secrets would do to a Gryffindor brat with a bad habit of interfering. Potter would be walking right into danger!
— plenty of information to write a sufficient essay, as Draco had (though he supposed he had relied more on previous knowledge of Uric the Oddball, which Granger wouldn’t have had, but that was beside the point). And the essay was, after all, only meant to demonstrate how much they remembered from the past year. Granger was clearly trying to go beyond what was expected of them to show him up, like always.

“And,” said Draco, who couldn’t believe the words he was about to say, “it wasn’t an awful place to start. I’ll just—” He gestured for Pansy to scoot over. “Dobby?”
“But… There wasn't supposed to be—” She stood suddenly and raced out of the room. Just as Draco was deciding whether or not he should follow her, she came back with a thick purple book, which she slammed onto the table between them. She started rifling through the pages.
Draco turned so his back was against the hedge and closed his eyes, listening. Despite it all, Potter actually seemed to be having a good time. This was far from ideal, but maybe it was for the best…
“Then stop talking,” Draco said in Potter’s voice. He sounded less threatening that way. He didn’t care for it.
Draco looked hesitantly at Crabbe. He hadn’t shown any enthusiasm at keeping the Chamber closed…but then again, the only things the boy really expressed were puzzlement and a dull glint in his eyes that might have been satisfaction. It was possible he didn’t have the capacity to give Draco nonverbal confirmation.
“You misunderstand, McNair,” said Mr Malfoy, “I make no threat, this is merely…precautionary, in case I am unable to stop the Act from being passed. I presume none of us
didn’t hear any conversation,” Draco conspiratorially told his salad. When his father huffed, Draco smirked at the white tablecloth.
What did Weasley mean, “Are they feeding you?” What sort of question was that? Did the Dursleys really not feed Potter, on top of everything else? Dobby hadn’t mentioned— Of course, now Draco had to ask—
He was going to meet Potter today. One way or another, it was going to happen— Draco was going to arrange it himself if necessary. He hadn’t seen Potter in person since the day they had come back from Hogwarts. Sometimes it felt like fate stepping in to tell him he wasn’t even allowed to look. Yes, he had that picture of Potter, but it was inferior to the real thing. Potter was far less predictable than the camera’s loop made him out to be, and the picture was too small to make out the green of his eyes… Draco had nearly forgotten the exact shade…
Over the next week, Draco took note of the parts of his day that he thought would be most uninteresting to an observer, and things that didn’t normally include Potter— the route from the dungeons to Arithmancy, trying to fall asleep with Goyle foghorning it up in the next bed, opening packages of sweets from his mother, studying by the lake, listening to Blaise and Pansy prattle on about the latest gossip, sitting through History of Magic, looking over his notes from History of Magic… The list went on, though it was still a shockingly
Draco pulled gently on a couple strands to point out their disarray. “Under what circumstances would Draco Malfoy ever leave his room looking like this, hmm?”
“Ron! What are you doing?” Mr Weasley said, having fought his own way through the crowd. He was followed closely by the Weasley twins. “It’s mad in here, let’s go outside.”
Weasley’s house was exactly what Draco thought it would be. It looked as if it had started as a pigsty, and then was turned into a house by the mere addition of several unbalanced stories. Then, to top it all off, there was a crooked sign by the drive that read:
“I’m sorry,” Draco said sarcastically, “was I distracting you from something important? By all means, we can sit here in silence if that’s what you want.”
Harry snorted, and Pansy swiped a silencing hand back at him. Even from behind, it was easy to tell she was smiling.
Ron furrowed his eyebrows. “What, ‘literally?’ I can’t use it even though it’s correct there? What should I have said, then?”
This chapter's got Victorian flower language, babyyyy! :D Link in the endnotes for my resource, but I'll also tell you what each flower symbolises there too. Don't want to leave y'all guessing what they mean. And if you don't want to know, feel free to ignore this and the endnotes.
“Clearly,” said Mr Malfoy, looking askance at a couple who could only be Granger’s Muggle parents: the man had Granger’s long front teeth, and the woman had Granger’s bushy hair and dark skin. “The company you keep, Weasley…and I thought your family could sink no lower—”
“Don’t worry about it, Crabbe,” said Pansy, when the boy frowned at his wand. “We’re only in our second year, I’d have been shocked if that had done something.”
,” said Draco, barely keeping himself from accusing Weasley of the same thing, “I want to make sure I’ve touched on everything we need to.”
Draco pushed Blaise aside to stand directly in front of Potter. “Ignore Blaise, he thinks he’s being clever.”
Draco was humming when he entered the dining room that night, and bounced minutely as he plopped into his chair.
It was unfair that Potter could forge such strong bonds with people he’d barely known when Draco had to work so hard to keep the friendships he’d had since birth. Potter didn’t have to follow the same unwritten rules; he had Granger and Weasley. Potter, somehow, had “Love.”
His thoughts were interrupted when Madam Pomfrey prodded his arm with her wand. She had begun examining him. The process went on a great deal longer than Harry had been expecting, and was made far worse due to Malfoy’s terrible sense of humour. Every question Madam Pomfrey asked them was answered with a sarcastic or suggestive comment. If the situation had been different, Harry would have left. Or socked Malfoy. Weird as it would have been to punch himself.
“No.” Draco grabbed his wand. “I think someone’s cursed me, and—” he collapsed onto his knees, clutching his other eye, which had begun throbbing. He swore. “I need the hospital wing.”
In Diagon Alley, Draco and his father stopped in many of the shops to get Draco’s school supplies. All the while, Draco kept an eye on the windows for signs of Potter, who was not in Madam Malkin's when Draco was fitted for new, longer robes; he wasn’t in Eeylops Owl Emporium when Draco bought some food and treats for Talos; he wasn’t in Slug and Jigger’s Apothecary when Draco scoured the drawers and shelves for Potions ingredients; nor was he in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where Mr Malfoy not only paid for a new broom for Draco, but for the entire existing Slytherin team.
Pansy motioned for him to be quiet, and went to poke her head out of the bathroom. “Crabbe and Goyle,” she said to Harry, who relaxed instantly.
Then there was the way Potter smiled in the photo, clearly drawing on shared knowledge between him and Granger and Weasley, information Draco did not have. A smile that wouldn’t have existed had Draco gotten his last jibes in before the summer.
And Harry still got to see some of Hermione and Ron, too. They met up almost every day to comb through the library for a book that might give them more answers about what had happened to Harry and Malfoy. Even with Madam Pince’s recommendations (ignoring her brusqueness, of course), they didn’t have any luck.
“There’s one way we could figure it out, Malfoy,” said Potter. He said it softly, like he was afraid of upsetting Draco.
Also exceptional were Mr Potter’s actions inside Hogwarts: it is rumoured he defeated a fully grown mountain troll
Harry Potter, at the bright young age of eleven, has already accomplished a great deal. Our sources inform us of the shocking tale of Mr Potter’s busy first year at Hogwarts— a tale full of broken records, an encounter with a troll, and the recovery of a legendary artefact.
The look of surprise, and then embarrassment, on Potter’s face was worth it. Draco gave him an exaggerated simper before walking the correct way again. He spotted the door to an unused classroom and sped up.
“Master intends to use the diary to open the Chamber and control the monster, but Dobby isn’t sure how. He thinks Master may not know either because every time Dobby asks, Master’s only answer is to punish him,” said the elf, displaying bruises up and down his skinny arms.
He looked at himself in the mirror, one eyelid closed and (leaking, which was a whole other mess) the other open, grey, and frightened. He turned on the sink, still hoping it was only an eyelash, and splashed cold water onto his face.
A bell clanged as Draco and his father entered the shop. The dim room was filled with all sorts of dark artefacts: jewelry and precious gems, bones of indeterminate species, masks with changing faces, jars filled with suspicious liquids, metal hooks that threatened to fall from the ceiling, and a large black cabinet that swung shut right as they entered the building.
“Of course,” Draco said, his smile dropping. He sat, then started rummaging in his bag for a piece of parchment.
“Not everything is so dramatic, Pansy,” said Draco, a bit more harshly than he had intended. “Of course I still want him gone. I’ve just been…unsuccessful. Potter is annoyingly resilient. Like a weed in a garden.”
“Harry Potter is a Half-blood,” the elf said quietly, hunching down the way he did when he was expecting punishment. His next words peeled themselves unwillingly from his throat. “There are great hazards ahead for him. If- if Harry Potter…dies, the Wizarding world will lose the…only hope it has of defeating He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”
disagreeable; his scar was, in its own way, beautiful, thin pinkish lines arcing down his forehead like real lightning; his eyes were large, almond-shaped, and an unmistakable green; his round glasses, though somewhat big on his face, suited him; his top lip was slightly bigger than the bottom, and both curved naturally upward at the corners, like they were made for smiling.
“Ask no more,” said Mr Malfoy, and he began walking again, even faster than he had before. This time, Draco did not try so hard to catch up.
Up close, there were no signs the piano had ever been damaged: no grooves in the wood that didn’t belong, no dust when Draco ran a hand over it. It was as if no time had passed at all.
, what was that Cachoral fellow thinking, bringing an Antipodean Opaleye into the country? They’re not even native!”) that somehow turned into a rant about Draco’s inattention on the train ride to King’s Cross.
The greasy-haired shopkeeper had appeared behind the counter. Draco took the opportunity to regain some control over himself.
“No,” Draco said, flipping the pillows behind him so he was more comfortable. “I haven’t.” He pushed his (now black) hair aside, but it flopped back into his eyes. He tried again, only to get the same result. This was going to be deeply annoying, he could already tell.
Draco threw the napkin from his lap and tore from the room. He heard his parents tittering behind him, but he didn’t care. He had been begging for snapdragons for ages, and every time he asked he had been told
Draco gripped the sides of his desk to keep from rising. “And you didn’t think to tell me this sooner?”
Professor Snape stared at him for a long moment. “I don’t believe that interaction would go that way,” he said. “Frankly, that didn’t even sound like Potter.”
Pansy crossed her arms. “Are you just going to repeat my questions, or are you going to answer them?”
Draco thought for a moment. Now was his chance to make good on warning the others…but Potter hadn’t believed Dobby, and Draco wasn’t sure what else he could tell him… “Just- just keep checking on him. In secret, like you were before.”
Draco whirled around. “What do you expect me to do? I can’t leave him in there!” He made another attempt to look inside the window. “Not when I know
“Mm,” Pansy agreed from her massive wing chair. Her cat, Raziel, leapt off the back of it and slunk over toward Draco, looking very much like a black lion. He was large for a cat — around three feet long — and the grey fur on his neck was longer than the rest, giving the impression he had a mane.
“This is fine. That will be our goal for today. Your job will be to identify any signals that tell you that you’re not alone. We’ll go back to the way we first did things, with whatever memories of yours surface first, to get your baseline for this as well. As always, I give you permission to defend yourself in any way you can, using your wand or otherwise. Now.” Professor Snape pushed up his sleeves. “Are you ready?”
Draco didn’t want to open his eyes, despite the logical part of his brain telling him it wouldn’t be like that first time— that the reversal had worked. He rested his forehead against Potter’s, and noticed the sore spot where Potter’s scar used to be had vanished. He remembered the first night all too well, when the scar had seared itself onto his skin like a metal brand… How it had burned sometimes, randomly, often at night— a deep, pulsing ache that had woken him up suddenly, without explanation.
Merlin, but Draco wished he had gone with them. They might have taken him, had things worked out differently— had the Dark Lord not been on the way, had Draco been given longer to consider Dumbledore’s deal, had Draco for once said what he actually meant and told Potter everything before it was too late… But Draco knew enough and had practiced enough to keep those thoughts buried deeply in metaphysical dirt…
Harry was shocked. He thought Malfoy would have been much nastier about the request, that he would have stripped off his pants and paraded himself through the hospital wing or something. “Thank you,” he said, somewhat breathlessly.
The mattress shook as Potter nodded. “When I touched you, everything else that hadn’t transformed began to. That must mean we’re done, right?”
“Enough. And the feelings of shame, of regret, were more powerful than the images themselves. I do not need to see the full memories to understand how painful they are for you.”
Professor Snape regarded him; his face seemed to darken as he did so. “Yes, Draco, I want you to lie.”
“Selling?” Mr Borgin asked, looking rather put out. Draco wanted to laugh. It was the same exchange every time his father came to the shop. Mr Borgin had to be really dim to imagine they were there to buy anything, or maybe he was simply too optimistic.
Early the next morning, Draco went down to the Slytherin common room, alone. When he arrived in front of the entrance, he nearly spoke the password, forgetting for a moment that he didn’t have it. Feeling rather foolish, Draco knocked on the bare wall. A slot appeared between two stones, and Draco said, “Fetch me Pansy Parkinson. Tell her it’s urgent.”
“No, don’t,” Draco said, grabbing the elf’s arm as he reached towards the nightstand. “For Merlin’s sake, Dobby, don’t punish yourself! You’ve done nothing wrong. I just…” Draco released him. “Either way, I can’t win. I don’t know what to do now, is all.”
This time, when Potter laughed, the awkwardness had vanished entirely from his voice. “You won’t hear me say it again.”
“—unbelievable. Completely outrageous,” Draco told Pansy the next time he visited her. He was angry even now. How could the Dursleys possibly be allowed to carry on like that?
His father smirked. “You don’t need to be shy, Draco, it’s all right to be excited. Finally, you’ll be getting the education you deserve, after that
“Honestly, Malfoy, at this point, there’s very few things I wouldn't consider doing to get back to my own body. How bad could it be?”
Obviously. Draco sneered. It was easy to turn on her, to find the words that would deepen her scowl: “Potter, you’ve got yourself a
“I happen to be very proud of my job,” said Mr Weasley, raising his chin. His hands curled into fists at his side and his knuckles went white.
, I learned something about what’s happening this year…” and he told Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle about his father’s plan, keeping the story as objective as he could manage. He wanted to see how his friends would react.
Mercifully, Potter finished dressing quickly enough. He cleared his throat and held an expectant hand out to the air, about waist height. Draco took it and allowed Potter to lead him out of the Slytherin common room, which had filled somewhat since Draco had entered it. They, Blaise, Pansy, and a couple other Slytherins headed toward the Great Hall together for breakfast.
incorrect,” said Draco, not looking directly at him. “But this is the last place I wanted him to end up. Well, nearly, anyway. If Potter stays here, he won’t have anything preventing him from going back, and you know how bad that would be.”
“Then say nothing,” Mrs Malfoy hissed. She bent in front of Draco. “Whatever happens, I love you and I’m proud of you.”
“It’d be Harry, wouldn’t it?” said Longbottom. He had already filled his container with snapping leaves. “It’s his body, right?”
Draco cast the parchment aside to stare out of the window, his lip curling at the horribly intimate view of the neighbours Potter had been stuck with for the past four days.
It took several moments longer than usual for Dobby to arrive, and when he did, his eyes were closed and he swayed slightly.
TRIGGER WARNING: mention of canonical abuse of Dobby. It's not shown "on-screen," but Draco doesn't handle it very gracefully or thoughtfully. More discussion of this in the end notes, which is where I've also put my Victorian flower language info/resource.
Pansy sighed and resettled herself against the tree. In the distance, one of the peafowls cried. “I suppose that means you were thinking about him on the train, too?” she said.
“Here, Ron, let me help,” said Longbottom, who seemed worried about the way Weasley was approaching the Venomous Tentacula. He got off his stool and came to their side of the table.
Draco pulled the chain on the bedside lamp and blinked, both in the bright light and at the blurry sight of Potter squinting dramatically. No—
Professor Snape nodded as if he had been expecting the question. “It is the memories we are most anxious to protect that are easiest to find. That anxiety draws the attention of the seeker more than mundane memories ever would.”
And anyway, who was she to put words in Potter’s mouth? For all she knew, Potter missed their conversations. They had to be more enlightening than any with her or Weasley. At the very least, Draco was honest.
Pansy heaved a large sigh and came back inside. “You’re no fun,” she said, giving him a massive grin. “Where to?”
To Draco’s horror, when Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall stopped by a bit later, they agreed with Granger. According to Dumbledore, it was “better not to confuse or alarm the rest of the students by such a dramatic, and hopefully temporary, situation.” And then he’d twinkled at them like they were the punchline to a saucy joke.
them— you’ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes,” he heard Weasley say. Seconds later, he sent a screaming gnome flying over the hedge and into the field behind it.
“Good.” Professor Snape pointed his wand lazily at Draco. “Close your eyes and picture the same tree…”
And that’s what convinced him. Draco slid the metal frames off his face and everything came into focus. He tried very hard to control his breathing. Potter stood before him, looking more real as he put on his glasses than he had in the past three weeks. Every time Draco had looked into the mirror to see Harry Potter staring back, it had felt
The water seemed to help for a moment, but then the pain was back, and this time it felt as if the optic nerve had been severed and was thrashing around helplessly, looking for a connection that was no longer there. Draco knew no amount of water could fix a problem like that. He knew of no spells to fix it, either, and if he
The instant their lips touched, something incredible started to happen. It was like a breeze blowing over Draco’s body, disturbing not only his hair, but his skin and bones. Draco felt himself begin to grow taller; Potter shrank before him, and Draco tilted his head down to accommodate the change. He found the back of Potter’s neck, putting more pressure into the kiss because he didn’t dare separate now, not when the transformations were happening all at once and without the pain of the first time…no, he needed Potter to be closer, much closer, and Potter must have thought the same thing because he brought a hand up to Draco’s cheek, which was
“I shouldn’t like to be in the business of protecting Muggles, Weasley— oh, but then again, that’s your job, isn’t it?”
“Books by Mr Lockhart won’t be available until 12:30,” the shopkeeper announced as he stocked the two-to-three-book-deep shelves.
— chest, and instead kept his gaze on the white ceiling. But when he got to his trousers, Harry forgot himself somewhat. As he pushed them down, he noticed that Malfoy’s knees were significantly less knobby than his own, and that, while both of them were thin, Malfoy seemed less runty, more lean.
Draco reached into his cloak and handed his father the piece of parchment. “Most of them are by Lockhart, and you heard the shopkeeper, we have to wait until 12:30.”
“Stop that,” Draco said, feigning annoyance. “What were you thinking out there? You realise there could have been subtler ways to get my attention?”
He wanted to enjoy his time with Pansy, truly, but could not stop circling back to the interaction he had witnessed in the train station. It was bizarre enough, even, to distract him from his recent dreams, though it was a near thing. No matter which way Draco tried to explain it, he couldn’t understand the Dursleys’ behaviour. The way they had spoken to Potter… It wasn’t with the admiration Draco had been expecting, that was for sure. Surely the great Harry Potter had grown up as famous as he was in the Wizarding world? How else could he have turned out the way he had, expecting praise and affection from everyone who laid eyes on him?
Draco examined the photograph of Potter more closely. Someone had taken a candid shot of him smiling at Granger and Weasley in King’s Cross Station, right before he left with his family. Potter really needed to brush his hair, or cut it, or
“Hang on,” said Potter, dropping his school bag onto the floor with a thump. “I was just trying to do what
Mrs Malfoy’s dressing gown stirred around her ankles when he joined her. With a tap of her wand and a murmured “
From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter turn toward him. “Everything's always an insult with you, isn't it? Can’t you be normal, for once?”
“Don’t read too much into it, Potter, it’s a lot easier to listen to you like that. You sound so reasonable when you're wearing my face and speaking with my voice. And my arse,” said Malfoy, voice dipping into a strange octave, “well…I never realised it looked that good.”
The other boy obliged, nudging Harry’s back with the neatly folded garments. Harry handed his over in a loose ball.
you’ve taken his post. Fail to do so, and the consequences will be far more severe than your simply being late to a summons. Understand?”
“All right,” said Potter, calming somewhat, though there was still a very annoying, I-know-something-you-don’t smirk on his lips. “So, what’s so important that you risked coming here?”
Granger clarified: “Harry’s always going on about you, like, ‘Malfoy looks tired, do you think he’s sleeping enough? Should I ask him? I should ask him.’ ‘I think Malfoy’s plotting something; I’m going to follow him; why aren't you guys helping me watch him?’ ‘No, of course I’m not obsessed with Malfoy.’ That sort of thing.”
Draco and his friends howled with laughter as the owners scrambled to control their luggage, failing quite spectacularly to do so. One of the boys somehow ended up on top of his for a brief moment before getting bucked off; another tried to pull his back by the handle, which snapped cleanly, launching him back into his seat; yet another, who had been trying to push a book back into his open bag, was slammed bodily against the door.
“Ah,” said Mr Malfoy. He blotted his mouth with a napkin— unnecessarily, as there was nothing to blot. “Your mother recently reminded me of your request to expand the range of plants in our greenhouse.”
When Potter came back, Blaise and Pansy were at his elbows. They were staring at an object in his arms— a bundle of fabric that rippled like silk and shone like molten silver.
Harry faced the opposite direction and started unbuttoning his shirt. Out of politeness, he did not look down at Malfoy’s —
But that couldn’t be right. The Dursleys hadn’t seemed to care about Potter at all. It certainly hadn’t been love that Draco saw in their eyes. Picking Potter up seemed a chore to them. Taking
At 6:48 am, Draco Malfoy sat bolt upright in bed. He slapped a hand to his eye, where a deep, stabbing pain had begun out of nowhere. It felt as if his brain was trying to escape through the eye socket, armed with a sharp sabre.
care; don’t forget, I can easily make all your friends turn against you. This body,” he said, looking down at himself, “could do a lot of damage.”
There was a strange person-shaped shadow off in the far corner of the room, and it wasn’t attached to anyone…
“You’re sure you don’t remember him giving anything to Mr Borgin but a list?” Mrs Malfoy asked Draco for the third time, when they were combing through the library.
“Okay,” Draco said back, and ducked down the corridor to find a less crowded place to take off the invisibility cloak. He folded the material as neatly as he could, then tucked it into his bag.
Draco started a little at that. He hadn’t thought about it before, but surely it was exhausting to poke around in someone else’s mind… It looked like it had taken a lot out of Professor Snape: his eyes were drooping slightly, his wrinkles seemed deeper somehow, and he looked extraordinarily pale.
The elf smiled meekly and gave Draco the stack of envelopes, saying, “Is there anything else Dobby can do?”
Draco hated who his father was becoming. Had become? Had been all this time? It was impossible to tell.
“Actually,” said Potter, “I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that… When we go back to classes, you can't call people by their last names. I almost never do.”
Draco opened his eyes and Professor Snape’s sallow face came back into focus. The man’s lips ticked upward into a smile so slight, someone less familiar with him would not have described it as such. “A great first start, Draco,” he said.
“Of course I am. Obviously I want to figure out what’s going on, who’s cursed us and why, but right now I’m more concerned about whether we’re done.” Draco dropped his voice to a whisper. “What if we’re not?”
“I have been wondering about this too…” said Professor Snape. He brought a long, sallow hand up to his face and started absentmindedly rubbing his cheek, like he was feeling nonexistent stubble. “Perhaps if you prepare, in advance, several memories to use in defense — safe memories, that is — they might be enough to ground you, giving you more control. That is what’s currently missing from your attempts, which are, again, very good…”
“Look,” said Draco, pointing across the corridor, where many of the students’ bags had fallen off their shelves. They hovered briefly in the air and then started battering at the closed door.
“Right,” Draco said, pushing his hair off his forehead with a palm. “Well, with the way things are going, he wouldn’t have to push very hard… How- how do I stop making it worse for myself?”
fault that my thoughts keep going to Potter; by all means, please keep mentioning him. Hearing his name
“Give him some space, will you, Blaise?” Draco ordered, before admiring his reflection, or lack thereof, in the mirror. The only parts of himself he could see were his head and neck, which floated strangely above the floor.
Mild warning: there's some semi-hard-to-read bigotry in this chapter. It's not really worse than what's in canon, but I figured I'd warn y'all anyway. It was really difficult for me to put on the page, but Lucius Malfoy is a monster, so here we are.

“If you think we’re going to give you something to use against Harry, you’re mistaken,” said Weasley, eyes narrowing.
His hand hesitated briefly on the handle before he opened the door. In the night, the dark wooden floors reflected the light of the moon. The walls, covered in purple damask wallpaper, formed a circle around the piano, drawing the eye to where it sat dead centre. There was only one other piece of furniture in the room— a desk tucked right next to the door. Were Draco to open it, he was sure to find sheet music, inkwells, and Tuning Spell instructions, all the way he had left them.
“Hi,” Draco said simply, hoping to convey the jumble of emotions he felt through that single word. It came out as a half-whisper.
“I think practical experience will do you well. Magical theory can only get you so far. Now.” Professor Snape moved to stand in front of him. “I want you to understand what is about to happen before it does. I will utter a spell to enter your mind. There, I will be able to glimpse your memories and thoughts, and it is your job to…kick me out, as it were. Using your wand if you wish, but I do not want you using that as a crutch. You have the power to stop a mental invasion with just your thoughts, and it will be less suspicious if you do so when it becomes necessary.
On the surface, Potter seemed as plain and uninteresting as his friends. A Gryffindor in every possible way, and certainly not worth Draco’s time. Or friendship. And yet…there was undoubtedly something compelling about Potter, aside from his famed defeat of the Dark Lord. Potter was more than that. He was more than just a boy. He was more than just a Gryffindor. He was…indescribable.
“No,” Draco said, not aware that he was speaking out loud. He made no attempt to use his wand, which he held in a slack hand.
As his mother breezed over to scan the bookcase, Draco wandered about the rest of the room, peering into and behind his father’s possessions, growing more and more frantic the longer they went without finding anything. The large pots were only home to the plants that grew in them; the end tables contained much of the same rubbish as the desk; the filing cabinets had only boring paperwork in them; the floorboards seemed very well secured; the curtains expelled only dust when Draco shook them; the walls looked undisturbed; the pictures on the walls did not swing to the side to reveal extra storage. It seemed he and his mother would never find the diary, until—
“Then it gets worse,” said Madam Pomfrey. “But if there’s a chance we can fix all this, why not take it? I have yet to find a spell that did the job, but this is an unusual problem— perhaps it requires an unusual solution. Now,” she added, readying her wand, “if you’ll stand?”
“Brilliant!” Draco said. Heart thumping wildly, he sat up, pushed the covers off of himself, and threw his legs carelessly over the side of the bed. “Where is he now?”
“I suppose,” said Draco, not entirely sure about that. Before Hogwarts, he had done loads of research on the other boy… In any case, he closed his eyes and searched his mind for something he could use. Moments later, he was ready and they went again…
Draco sat up even straighter, so much so he nearly lifted himself out of the chair entirely. “I am not
As they entered the shop, Draco was reminded again of how much he liked Flourish and Blotts. It was one of the oldest buildings in Diagon Alley, and it showed. The ceilings sloped and none of the floors were entirely level. The whole place smelled of new and ancient books alike, which were shoved in every available slot on every shelf and piled upon every available surface, threatening to fall from their tippy stacks. Everything appeared as it always had, save for some photographs of Gilderoy Lockhart that were arranged on a table at the back of the shop.
Once they had swapped pyjamas, Malfoy gave Harry an appraising look, nodding. “That’s much better. You looked ridiculous before.”
As always, I don’t own any of these characters, nor the world they inhabit. Unfortunately, that right belongs to J.K. Rowling. I'll do some direct quoting of dialogue from the books in this fic, so if it’s important to you, see the end notes for my improper citations.
topic of conversation but somehow their discussion of which potion provided the best sleep aid had led them here.
Draco thought it over. May did make sense. It gave them half a year of dating, so they would have to know quite a bit of the more domestic side of one another, but this could actually work. It put more stake in it to say half a year rather than four months.
I hope you all enjoyed this fic and that it brought a little bit of joy to your world at the moment.
"Everyone get with your partner! We've got to sign up for the contest." Hermione said as they reached the club. Once they were partnered and grouped up they walked over. They made it in without difficulty and lined up.
The trio beamed as they boarded the rickety boat behind Hagrid’s. Together, the four led the First Years across the Lake and towards Hogwarts for the first time.
To Harry's relief, it was fun. He jumped around and danced about with everyone, throwing crazy shapes. With each new song came a new dance move and Harry was getting into it. Ron, Hermione and him sang their hearts out to one of the only songs they each knew, Queen's
