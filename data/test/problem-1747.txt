Harry was sitting in a field surrounded by a grey stone wall. beyond the wall were thousands of wispy memories. I sat down next to him.
" Professor potter? Did you really defeat a dragon?" A slytherin by the name of rogers asked.
Harry stared at us. The ravenclaw from the night before had come this morning with me to the hospital wing and we'd just told.him about the book, after explaining that he could keep the toys my mother had left.
" He can't get me? Really this time? he won't hurt other people" Harry barely breathed out the questions, his arms shaking with repressed hope.
" Son, remember the muggle we found attacking Harry Potter?" Draco nodded. " It was his uncle, as in his current guardian. The auors came to question Dumbledore, Hagrid and Mrs. McGonagall. They're talking negligence charges and endangerment of a minor for leaving him there without the even an interview or background check. They litteraly left him on the doorstep in the middle of the night. Nearly got frostbite. Something is very odd here Draco, stay close to Harry every time you can, he needs the protection. "
" But it was only a week after when I said dad would ask him and you weren't even close."
"I know you as 15 year old Harry, but something happened he is 5 year old harry, you. You are still you. It was you who did those things and a lot more but you're different from him. You don't have to be like him, he's ten years older than you and I certainly don't expect you to be the same after this either. Besides, i like the Harry you are right now." Harry held the frog with the reverence he gives to all presents he is given. He looked at her with tears in his eyes.
" Draco, maybe harry is hoot hooot hoot cooooo. what do you think? do you know whats happening with them? Has your father told you? oooh oooo hooot coooo hooooot?" Draco rubbed his eyes tiredly.
" It's got nothing to do with you scar-head. It seams Traitors are as high on the hit list as saviors." Wands out they entered the manor. It was as desolate and destroyed as the last time I had been here, but I wasn't taking chances.
" What is it harry?" She asked him. He shyly watched her for a moment.
He lit up again glowing pink and yellow. The griffendors have kept their distance though I could see most wanted to rush over and steal him away from me. Granger walked up to the table we occupied before class started and set a stack of books in front of him. He stared at them then looked at her in awe. He jumped at her and hugged her. I smirked at her.
" He,... He sounded very sad when he talked about his Aunt. Something happened but I don't think she died. " Neville went still for a moment.
Harry now visible didn't notice the stares he was gathering and sneezed a cloud of glitter. Draco sighed as he took the brunt of it, Harry just looked shocked.
" It seams I wasn't the only one who noticed what happened this morning. All day people have been giving him books. Your mu--- Mrs. Malfoy gave him a book bag, but said that you would know how to use it." She handed him a child sized, leather book bag, just barely managing to do it with the 30 odd books in her arms. Draco placed his hand on the bag and took out his wand.
" Hmm, yes Hedwig thinks,....." Luna turned to the infirmary door.
Apparently, Draco also felt dissmissed like a schoolboy, if the bashful look on his face was anything to go by. "Mothers," he muttered.
The Headmistress rose from her chair behind the desk as they entered. "Mr Malfoy, would you please sit down. Thank you, Horace, but I think I need a moment or two alone with Mr Malfoy. Would you be so kind as to wait outside?" She gestured to Slughorn, who gave Draco a glance, that Draco couldn't interpret and then he left.
To his astonishment the house-elf appeared with a distinct crack. "Master Draco called," the old elf croaked out. He could barely stand and trembled all over. It was clear to Draco that he was in no way able to help him with the child. But he must have decades of experience of childcare, and since he had taken a shine to Draco when he started to pay him visits at his den, maybe it could be worth a try to ask.
"Preferably Muggle, where no one knows me."
It wasn't his first blowjob, but he'd only been on the receiving end before. This was also one of the reasons he washed alone these days; the communal shower-stalls reminded him too much of his former self. Some of the younger boys had obliged eagerly, others...
"You all right there, Draco?" Harry's voice sounded a bit drowsy.
Ron turned to his fellow-Gryffindor. "He's got the map out. Who's the first one he always looks for on the map?"
"What about dinner?" Seamus asked baffled.
"Oh, you're so eager to please, aren't you? Maybe, you're ready for my cock. Do you want my cock up your arse?" Without waiting for Harry to respond he withdrew his fingers and hastily removed his dressing gown. Harry could feel the wet tip of Malfoy's cock nudge against his crack as Malfoy coated it with lube and began to press himself inside. One of his hands steered him while the other cirkled Harry's waist. Harry gasped and shuddered as the first inched penetrated. "It's all right, Harry, I've got you. Breathe."
Harry read it through one last time and resisted the urge to crumble it like the rest of the parchments on the floor. Instead he rolled it up and fastened it on the owl's leg before he changed his mind. The tawny owl hooted irritated at him and ruffled his feathers before he flew away.
"Well, how convenient for you, Potter, that you have such a weak memory. Then you never have to face what a bloody coward you really are."
Harry gave a releaved sigh and rolled up on his back on the bed. "Shall I put out the lights?" He could hear the nervous wavering in his voice.
"I wouldn't know, I only stayed for one song."
"Thirty-eight."
"Oh, sod it, Malfoy," Harry retorted. He was at the same time reluctant, embarrassed and a little aroused.
"Oh, she left hours ago. Totally exhausted, but happy. I don't believe I've seen her this happy in years." Draco put his chin close to Harry's ear. "It doesn't mean I've forgiven you, but thank you for that. Do you think anyone will notice if I slip away too?"
We all hugged her and assured her that we were perfectly all right with it. The Ravenclaw-girls welcomed her to their dorm and planned her move right away.
Harry looked over the small table and couldn't help an eyeroll as his gaze met Draco's. Typical pureblood thinking. Draco's mouth quirked in a little scew smile. "That's right, Mother, the lines won't die with me. Though, mixed with Potter's, they won't be pure anymore." His jaw clenched and his eyes got hard.
"You never asked. Of course, I see them. I decided to contact them right after the trials. Cissa's not been well and she's always been my favourite sister, after all. Not that she had that much of a competition," she chuckled dryly.
Harry sighed. "I don't, but it was a kind of emergency. Ginny demanded I get them out of the house for the night, and I couldn't really refuse since the kid's rooms are ready for them. You won't be able to work today, I'm afraid. I put the strongest silencing spells I could think of on Mrs Black, but they have to be renewed every other hour." He turned and begun to take things out of the larder to the workbench.
It got awkward sometimes even with that, but I suppose that's the whole point of the game. As the time when Michael's spin landed on a blushing Hermione, Ron didn't like that one bit, or when Seamus got to kiss Justin, which was just ridiculous since they're good friends and not at all attracted to oneanother. Then Luna was peppering everyone with kisses without even spinning, because, "I'm a very affectionate person and you're all such wonderful people." It got interesting, though, when Theo Nott played and kissed Teresa Boot, hot and eagerly, rendering her shy and breathless. Draco assures me that he's an okay bloke once you get passed that prickly quietness of his. I hope so, she looked so smitten.
"Why didn't you come yeasterday?" Potter's face was ridiculously transparant. Did he even
"Why not?" Malfoy rubbed his face with his hands and Harry waved the bartender over. "You might as well leave the bottle," Malfoy said as two new glasses were filled.
He stood and shrugged off his robes and rapidly opened the buttons of his shirt and pulled it off, revealing a crisscross of scarring, both on his back and chest. The ones on his front Harry identified as the faded marks of the
"Malfoy, what's wrong? What have I done?" Potter raised his voice a little.
"Shoo, now run along, there's a good boy," she called after him. He flashed her a wry grin.
Draco sighed, realizing that he was pathetically desperate. He couldn't even bring himself to talk to her, much less confess his undying love to her. He'd seen her so many times, all of which he used to gawk and stare as though she were going to disappear right in front of him.
"Hullo. What can I get for you?" A fair skin woman stood at the side of Harry's table, smiling at him. Charcoal black hair was pulled into a neat bun, which helped to show off her oddly childish face. Her golden plaque read Cho, likely because her name was Cho. What else would it stand for, Cho Chow Soup? Cho, despite her childishly youthful face, looked older than Harry- it also might have helped that her eyes didn't look quite so young.
Draco cleared his throat, his Adam's Apple bobbing. His gaze wandered over to where Harry was holding his hand before returning to his father's face. "No Father, I'm not joking."
"No foolish. Our parents taught us better than that. We are meant to carry on our bloodline, it's as simple as that." Pansy nodded proudly. "We should have as many kids as we can provide for."
It just doesn't work like that. Instead, I'm stuck on an awful, piss poor train that smells like sweat and old food, headed to Hogwarts for my eighth year- that's what the high-ups are calling the redo of the previous year. The seat as scratchy as hell. And I'm all alone, although I don't exactly mind- the people were too loud. To clarify, everything stinks, and everyone absolutely sucks.
There would a large funeral, which a variety of uniquely colored flowers for his grave. A speech composed of many fancy words would be read by either an overly emotional person or a person with no emotion whatsoever. People would mourn him and cry for their dead savior, whether they knew him or not, as they had to face a war without their main soldier who would willingly do anything to protect those said people. They would then take his corpse and bury him in the Earth's surface, alongside his mother and father.
He hurried along, before flooing to his parents' manor. He held Esmeralda, while Harry flooed to his parents with Rosetta- he was only allowed to after he mastered the Floo network.
"What the actual hell?" asked Blaise with a disturbed look. "That's just sick. I'm gonna go hang out with Millie."
Harry's flat was nothing like Draco imagined, which was strange considering how many scenarios Draco created. A beautiful garden, full of flowers of all color varieties,  bloomed perfectly without so much as a single spot. The red shutters, which had been freshly painted last week, matched the grey siding of the house. His shiny black car sat in the small driveway, glimmering under the slowly setting sun.
"Potter, are you crying?" The voice that asked the question was very nasally and bitter sounding, as though the person who was asking had a terrible cold and was rather pissy about that fact. Unfortunately for Harry, it was just the perfect little prefect, Draco Malfoy, who looked way too smug to be ill.
Upon closer inspection, Draco realized that Harry's arms were filled with the most beautiful tattoos. The tan skin of his arms was nearly completely hidden by the sleeves of tattoos. A beautiful red lily was the first tattoo that Draco noticed, every line and fine detail implanting itself into Draco's mind. A wispy blue stag moved slightly on his arm, likely because it was a wizard's tattoo- muggles saw the same tattoo, except it wasn't moving. A bubblegum pink and sky blue butterfly was placed right above his wrist, on the veins that could determine the life or death of a person.
The party life was often one of the most disapproved lifestyles. There were several reasons as to why, most of them revolving around of the idea of wasting away life, drinking way too much, having sex with people you wouldn't remember, and leading yourself down a path where just partying wasn't enough.
"See, we both have valid point," said Blaise, nudging Draco's side playfully. "And I know you haven't got laid since your breakup with Pansy. I got a little something so you could have a bit of fun." Blaise winked at her.
Pansy wrapped her arms around Draco's neck, tilting her head to the side. Draco's eyelid fluttered, during which his hands possessively wrapped around Pansy's waist. Pansy leaned into Draco, placing her lips on his. Her lipstick smudged against Draco's lips, imprinting proof of her kiss upon him for everyone to see- save for the blind gentleman with a walking stick.
"I..." Pansy swore under her breathe, cursing out both Harry and his parents existence. She even used a new word that Harry had never heard before, but from Blaise's reaction, he gathered all he needed to about that particular word. "Run along, you inbred creature. Go cry on your inbred bitch of a mother's grave, Potty."
Those people would move on- get married, have a couple kids, almost get a divorce, and die in the war before they could do anything else. It wasn't a life Harry wanted, but it was still more promising than the life he was currently leading. They might even survive the said war and have a couple more kids. They could live and see their children go to Hogwarts and cry while reading their child's first letter home. Maybe that fate wasn't so terrible, having kids and settling down somewhere warm with someone you love.
Romeo, out of what he believed was love, killed Tybalt, Juliet's uncle. Before Tybalt went down, he stabbed Romeo's best friend, Mercutio, who bleed to death while dramatically making jokes. For murdering Tybalt, Romeo was banished, as both the Montagues and the Capulets received warnings about fighting with each other.
"One root beer," said Cho flatly, placing Harry's drink down on the checker drink coaster. "Your dinner will be done soon."
Hermione sighed, pinching her nose. This was the last conversation she had in mind when Harry said he needed to talk to her, especially considering she didn't really know what to do. He was her best friend, and he deserved to be loved by someone. But yet, he'd fallen head-over-heels for Ginny, which resulted with him distrusting people. Sure, it was only one relationship, but the damage was there. She stepped all over him, absolutely crushing him. Harry already had self-esteem issues, and the whole relationship between Harry and Ginny only brought out more issues than what it was worth- more self-esteem issues, more anxiety, self-doubt, lack of faith in people, and a phobia of trusting people.
References to explicit sexual content.
And so, Draco continued to party.
"Ugh. Snape sucks," said Ginny, throwing herself across a chair in the Gryffindor common room. Her dark red hair was neatly braided, likely with help from Lavender. Her freckled face was pale, her warm eyes filled with a bitter malice.
"No kidding," said Draco, a disgusted look on his face. He looked as though he'd bitten into a lemon- with his nose scrunched up and his eyes holding a harsh look, it was hard to say that's not what he looked like.
The entire situation felt wrong, as if his brain were twisting the situation to some sort of nightmarish reality. Harry had always suffered- well, more like since he turned thirteen- with vivid hallucinations. That must have been what was going on currently, he decided. None of this was real, he chose, but rather a twisted hallucination.
Filipino Noun- a man who is desperately in love with a woman, but cannot admit his feelings or approach her.
Rosetta was one of the cutest children Draco had ever seen, which was rather strange, considering that he didn't like children. They'd adopted her when she was around two years old, which had only been a year ago. With big chocolate eyes and curly brown hair, she was able to pout, and she even got Lucius to give into her antics- a man of no emotions.
Adjective- emotionally confused or uncertain.
Draco, meanwhile, continued to daydream of a life where it was his choice if and when he got married. In these daydreams, his father was supportive of the fact that Draco didn't want to get married, and Narcissa continued to teach him about gardening. Reality was a slap in the face, considering that his parents wouldn't support their son remaining single, much less a gardening habit.
"Overgrown bat who likes to hide in the dungeon. He enjoys tormenting students that attend his class, save for the Slytherins. He's the Head if Slytherin house and a potions teacher at Hogwarts. From the state of his hair, one could infer that he takes showers once a year, if that. He likes to dress in all black and sneer at people. It's completely possible that he has a vampire kink. Preferred gender is unknown. If interested, please contact any student that isn't a Slytherin, and they'll be more than pleased to help him pack his bags. Any inquires can be sent directly to Ginny Weasley." Ginny smiled proudly.
But mainly, thanks for reading.
Katelynn Avery- Not compatible, marriage contract with Annabeth Westfrost.
Draco found Harry most attractive when he smiled, although he wasn't ever unattractive. With the jet black hair and big emerald green eyes, he looked much like what Draco subconsciously wished for in a partner. His tan skin bore a few harsh scars, obviously from a while back, but he simply never mentioned them, pretending as if they never existed. While he was rather skinny, he had a moderate amount of muscle- not too much though, he didn't look like on of those beefed up men on the front of a magazine. He was simply attractive, utterly alluring.
Although he was physically attractive, he had a rather attractive personality as well. When Draco had first met him, he thought Harry an ordinary businessman that only cared about money, his girlfriend, and sex. On the contrary, he seemed to care more about his relationships with others than anything else, even more so than his paycheck. It'd been Harry's quiet, serene characteristics that had first lured Draco in. And Draco couldn't get out of his mind that Harry was everything he desired in a partner. Draco was nearly positive that Harry was his soulmate, and he wouldn't be sure unless he answered the beautiful man.
Smiling is considered a sign of joy and happiness by many people. A smile is a sign that one is in a good mood or that something really amazing has happened to a person. A smile could also be friendly or welcoming, like one would give a person they've never met before. Smiling people are seemingly deemed as much prettier than those that don't smile— it seemed society had a thing for smiling people.
The man in general managed to remind Draco of a the type of partner referred to as 'the dog partner'. The meaning was rather simple, despite the confusion that Draco first felt at hearing the term. This term simply meant that one's partner acted like a dog more than a cat or any other particular pet. A 'dog partner' was the type of partner that openly displayed love and affection, one that was nearly overwhelmed with joy when they heard one unlocking the door. Harry was also rather open with falling asleep with (or next to) Draco, snuggling right up next to him.
"ENOUGH!" snapped Lucius, sneering at his son. "I'm arranging you a marriage contract with one of the Greengrass ladies."
"Oh honey~" purred Draco, turning around in a spinning chair that Voldemort had bought for the event. "You couldn't possibly believe that I'd love you. I wouldn't ever be that desperate, and even if I was, I think I'd go without. But thank you for teaching me to be a good kisser, I'm sure the woman will be all over me."
"Why's it any of your concern?" Draco turned away from her, looking interestedly at his calendar. The picture of a dog in scuba wear wasn't as interesting as it usually was, Draco noted immediately.
His left arm was filled with different tattoos. The most beautiful phoenix flew around on his arm, looking as free as a bird tattoo could be. There was a large black dog and a werewolf, situated next to each other, both of which could also moved slightly. Above his wrist was another tattoo, although it wasn't a picture. It was a name, written in cursive: Teddy Lupin.
"Y'know, maybe you should pull that stick out of your damn arse and just chill for five seconds. I'll leave you and your precious hair gel alone on your date," said Harry in a snappy.
Magazines issued from sex industries are no different. They glamour up their workers, putting them in overly sexualized outfits and lingerie. Those workers are ordered to pose in a variety of sexual poses, all to keep the industry's fan base now. The props used are too glamours, too ridiculous, but it's all for the same exact reason- to feed the sexual desire and want of their customers. Some industries even made videos or allowed the rich customers to have intimate cessions with their most fresh, pinned after individuals.
Millicent smirked. "Oh pretty boy, I can't tell you everything."
"What?" asked Blaise confusedly, cocking his head to the side like a lost little puppy.
"Mhm," grunted Draco.
Genderbent!Drarry.
"Ugh, not everything's about you," said Pansy in a fake whiny tone. "You won't even let me have my diva moments. You're a terrible friend!"
"I mean, the guy dressed up extra special just in hopes of impressing you, like you did with Ginny. Interestingly, many bird species try to impress their future mate by brightening up their appearance. Anyways, it seems that he simply wanted to impress you.
"Of course not," said Draco disgustedly. "I'm bitchaphobic, which means that I dislike bitches. Remind me to give Lavender an award later, would you? I don't hate anyone because of their sexual preference, you useless stack of parchment! I know you do, but I don't!"
"Mister and Mister Potter, please, allow me to get the door," said the aging limo driver- Dobby, if Draco's memory was correct. His tan skin was wrinkled, more so than Draco ever remembered- given, it'd been a while since he'd last seen the kind man.
"I love you Draco. I love you so much. I always loved you, and I always will," said Harry finally. And those were, truly, Harry's last words.
Verb- to leave without saying goodbye.
"Of course," said Voldemort darkly. "After all, a few more dead bodies are always nice. Would you like to buried with Potty or no?"
Luna shook her head, a sad smile resting upon her face. Even though she was normally pale, she looked much paler today. Although, it might not have helped that she was dressed in a dark midnight blue shirt with a matching skirt that had golden stars on it. "No. I think you should give up."
Pets were just something else to take care of, another bill to add to the pile, and another mouth to feed. It wasn't as though they could have a cup of tea with one at three in the morning when one felt down, they simply weren't that classy. They couldn't comfort one after a terrible nightmare, if they even noticed that one was having a nightmare in the first place- Draco wasn't sure if pets had the mental compatibility to do such human things. Pets chewed things because they were bored, whether it was one of their toys or a piece of furniture. It was simple, pets just weren't humans, and Draco rather disliked them.
"Pansy," said Draco with wide eyes, "that's horrifying. I mean, really? Why would you want that? Wouldn't you want to live a little first, before you have kids and get married?"
Rachelle Derocit- Not compatible, only speaks French.
Everything was just so... wrong, and it wasn't helping that all of her thoughts eventually bounced back to a certain emerald eyed woman. None of this seemed right. Absolutely none of it.
And tonight, Draco was expected to go to Harry's flat for a simple date, as Harry put it.
"Get away from me," spat Draco. "I want nothing to do with any of that. I refuse to be part of that. If you want to participate in the high Pureblood values and morals, I suggest you go to the school in Asia! They are the only remaining school where people would agree! I'm sure all the guys would be drooling over you."
Draco just shrugged off Harry's warnings and continued to go out and party. He'd drink too much, stumble around, and wake up in someone's bed without any clothes on. He'd allow himself to sober up, go home, try to recall what happened the night previous, and call Harry to ask if he'd like to eat dinner at a fancy restaurant.
"Hey Draco. How'd flirting with Harry go?" Ginny's lips, which were coated in cheap scarlet lipstick, were pulled into a hateful smirk. Her eyes, a chocolate brown color, held the most smug, hateful look that Draco had ever seen. The ruby red shirt that she was wearing was simply scandalous, low enough to look like clothing Draco had seen at the strip club once- long story short, it had simply been Blaise's fault. A black skirt rose up every time she moved, which Draco didn't even notice.
"Oh honey," crooned Ginny sweetly, "I can't believe you. You really thought that Harry would be into you? Why would he downgrade from me to you?"
Draco bit back the bitter remark that was on his tongue- I'd do the same thing if you took a great fall of a building, you useless pug. The bitter, vile words were scalding his tongue, like tea, and he wanted nothing more than to repeat those hateful words to her. It took all of his self-restraint not to scream at her; his entire body itching out to push her somewhere and keep moving, almost like what serial killers did to their victims.
Harry was a very intricate, beautiful person. Harry wasn't a possession to be owned, he'd made that clear upon Lucius's comment about being Draco's consort. He was very intelligent, but at the same time, he was also incredibly stupid- for example, he knew all about the solar system, but he couldn't tell when Draco was flirting with him. At times, he could come across as rather flirty, but he only did such when in private with Draco. He was just interesting, so much more than anyone his parents had tried to set him up with.
Noun- act of mentally undressing someone.
Pansy shifted next to him, her charcoal colored skirt moving as she did such. An emerald green shirt fit her upper body rather snuggly, but not snug enough that she had wrinkles or anything. A golden necklace with a daisy dangled around her throat, which was somehow fitting, despite how it shouldn't have went with her outfit whatsoever. Her dark hair was cut into a bob, which hadn't changed from when they went to Hogwarts together. She'd become so beautiful, almost to the point that she didn't look anything like the girl he'd known years ago.
"Of course people are hungry for a good snack," said Pansy, shoving Draco's shoulder playfully. "It's just that you haven't meet the right one yet. Not everyone likes their snacks to be males. Take me for example."
"Your father's went feral," said Harry softly, looking at Draco with reassuring eyes. His eyes said something along the lines of, I'm sorry this is happening to you darling. Later, we can go home and cuddle. If you need to, you can cry in my chest while I hold you close to me and whisper comforting words in your ear.
"Any last words, Boy-Who-Wouldn't- Die?" crooned Voldemort, staring at Harry with his hollow eyes. He continued with his pacing, seeming not to care that it irritated Draco greatly- that was exactly why he was doing it.
And so, there are two lessons to be learned.
-Draco Malfoy.
Harry smirked, which was one of the first times he did such. It felt foreign on his face, instead of the usual smile that he forced on his face. "You wish darling."
Harry only ever heard the first version of the story, of course. If Draco were to tell him what really happened, Harry would be gone in an instant. So Draco made sure to carefully conceal his party clothes and hickeys left by someone equally as drunk as Draco had been at the party, as to never let Harry know what really happened.
In a similar sense, everyone is flawed. People just seem to be unable to help it, unable to find a way to not be flawed. There are liars, of course, that look you in the eyes and say, without wavering, that they are flawless. This is untrue, of course. Some flaws are more drastic than others, but that doesn't necessarily make a person evil or unworthy of gentle, soft hugs filled with love. No persons' flaws are exactly the same- they can be very similar, but not exactly the same. And people usually have multiple flaws, flaws that they don't even realize that they have.
"I'm thinking, and I think saying Draco Malfoy is my boyfriend sounds nice." Harry smiled at Draco. "I like the way your name rolls off my tongue."
Some people consider skin blemishes a flaw, although it's more a physical flaw than one that leaves a mark upon the soul. Scarring, some people say, is another physical flaw- that doesn't make you good or bad, the scarring is just there, reminding you that you're not perfect. All the little imperfections that litters one's skin could be considered a flaw, but that doesn't hinder one's beauty, nor their ability to love another.
Pansy Parkinson, Astoria Greengrass, Daphne Greengrass,  and Janet Parkinson (a cousin of Pansy's) were just a few of the many people his people introduced as potential spouses. And yet, none of them held any appeal to Draco. All of them were beautiful, but they just weren't for him. No matter what they said or did, he just wasn't attracted.
People are extremely gullible. Some people think that they're incredibly clever and perhaps they are. However, if one smiles at another individual, they're seen as happy and joyous. As long as one gives a seemingly real smile, everyone just writes that person off as happy.
Draco's fingers gripped the magazine, surprised to find that anything more than a name and a scanning label. She flipped to the first page, finding the words Harriet Potter written again. She was getting aggravated. If Blaise wanted to annoy her, he could have just stayed. What was the purpose of buying an annoying gift? And then she flipped to the second page.
"I'd love to believe that he wouldn't hurt me. But 'Mione, it is not that simple." Harry looked up at his best friend, feeling her comfortingly rubbing his shoulder. "I just don't trust new people. Ginny told me that she loved me, and that she'd never let me down. Look at where that got me."
He had none of the supplies to do that, as he was only allowed so much money. Art supplies weren't necessary for school, and Harry was much to shy to give a list of gifts he wanted to anyone. The Dursley's never even gave him gifts, so he had to appreciate the few gifts that kind individuals that pitied he gifted him. But he'd love some nice oil paints with a some unused canvas, but he simply had none.
Number Two: The best way to start dating your future husband is to have your best friend proclaim your unending love for him after you get rid of someone they don't like by suggesting they attend schooling in China.
His knuckles were unusually pale, gripping the railing ridiculously tight. He also realized that his body was trembling, his breathing was shaky at best- he was no where near being at a point one would consider 'best'. He didn't remember how exactly he'd ended up where he was standing. Was this his subconscious once again giving him the message that he shouldn't be alive?
"And you're a horny bastard," murmured Draco loudly enough that Blaise heard her. Draco took a seat on the pure white couch, sighing as she did such.
And suddenly, once again, Draco was stunned by Harry's beauty. Lucious, pale pink lips were practically begging for Draco's kiss, which Draco would gladly do if Harry gave him permission. He gently bit his lip, which was apparently one of his nervous ticks, seemingly not noticing the fact that he was doing it. The rosy color that filled his cheeks reminded Draco of one of his mother's most beautiful porcelain dolls with a blush painted on their childish face- Harry was clearly the more beautiful of the two.
Both were unrelated, but equally important.
"Perhaps I do," Draco whispered back harshly.
Harry had never realized how many strange, odd looks he received when he went to dinner alone. Perhaps maybe it was because it'd been, well, years since he'd ever been on a dinner date alone. The last time he'd went to a restaurant alone had been when Ginny went out of town for a meeting- somewhere in Brazil, she'd simply left it at that.
"Pretty good actually," said Pansy with a small smile. "I'm engaged right now, set to get married in October. How about you?"
Draco wouldn't consider the stories he told Harry as lies, but rather what happened in his mind, where everything was perfect. "Of course I went to Pansy's house. We shared a bottle of wine, talked about our days at Hogwarts Academy, had a splendid dinner over another bottle of wine, and sat on her patio. And then, I left."
A flash of bright, neon green light hit Harry straight in the chest. He fell to the floor, like an Angel falling from the Heavens. His body made a loud thudding noise, and he didn't so much as twitch. And a few seconds later, another wave of the neon green light hit his body.
Hey, if you'd like, I'm more than willing to give you people lessons. I'll leave my number, and we'll see where it leads. ;)
"Answer me," seethed Voldemort.
"Uhm... I'm very busy." Harry continued going about organizing the files, ignoring the paper cut that he just received. His tan cheeks were filled with a rosy color, making him look so much more ethereal. With beautiful emerald green eyes,  the ebony black hair, almost as dark as the night sky, was all he needed to make himself even more attractive. With dark, long eyelashes that nearly touched his cheek, he was what many individuals that desired men would want. In a white dress shirt that was fairly tight fitting, with a pair of black trousers that hugged his body properly, it was a wonder how Harry continued to remain single.
"Please make yourself at home," said Harry, gesturing around with his arm. The smile he gave Draco was bright and adoring, laced with love.
"Of course you are," growled Lucius in a threatening manner. His eyes took on a warning look. "Moral corruption doesn't exist in the Malfoys."
Ginny wants to get Severus Snape a date, and Draco had flirting problems.
"It was a joke," said Pansy.
Every dull moment of the boy's life was filled with daydreams, filled with things that couldn't never- should never- happen. While his father tried to teach him the importance of lordships and his duty as a future lord, he just daydreamed of a world where he could simply run freely through sunflower fields and smell the flowers. He even daydreamed that his father would take him into a muggle town and let him pick cherries, something he'd heard Blaise talk about when their parents were having balls and the children were forced to attend. Simple things like that filled Draco with a sense of longing, longing that he never got to participate in such mundane activities.
And Draco knew it was wrong, but she pictured the woman completely naked, which wasn't exactly hard considering how little clothing she did have on. Draco imagined unclasping Harriet's bra, letting it hit the floor. She imagined Harriet's thongs hitting the floor.
His face was seemingly youthful, almost babyish in some manners. At some point, his olive skin had been perfect, tainted only by unusual tan lines. But now, it was almost impossible to imagine him like that, without the many scars that tainted his once perfect skin. Deep blue eyes seemed distant, even as he continued to give her a dark look. Dressed in the usual Hogwarts getup, she could tell he was a Ravenclaw- she was rather curious as to why he was already in his outfit.
Noun- someone who hides pain behind a smile.
"No, this isn't right," said Harry breathlessly. He couldn't- didn't want- to believe this was possible. Everything felt so off, this simply wasn't possible. He must have been dreaming, because this wasn't possible. It wasn't, right?
"Hey, you dropped this." Harry gave Blaise a bright smile, showing off his slightly crooked teeth. Dressed in his regular school clothing, he looked like he did every other day. Dark charcoal colored hair fell over his scar and the tan skin of his forehead, which Blaise thought could have used a bit of fixing. With his big smile and slightly ruffled clothing, Blaise thought Harry was actually pretty attractive.
Harry opened the book, slightly surprised to see a personal note on the receipt.
Noun- a joke so unfunny and poorly told that you can't help but laugh.
Harry just smiled at her. "Don't worry. I bought one today when I found out I was coming here." Harry opened the trunk, pulling out a red carpet.
"That's lovely Milly," said Draco with a kind smile. "I know I act like a jerk most of the time, but if you really love that annoying Hufflepuff, I'll let him in the common room instead of locking him out. Also, how does he get in the girls' dormitory?"
Harry was standing there, a tear falling down his tan face. He had the most troubled look, almost as if he'd known but didn't want to believe it. His hands were trembling, causing him to almost drop the box of chocolates he was holding. Dressed in a beautiful black suit, he looked devilishly handsome, even if he was beginning to cry.
His father would have a fit if he even mentioned the possibility of Harriet being a large part of his future. His father wanted his son to marry a woman who had the perfect family, with a large fortune. It seemed almost impossible for Draco to mention his love for the beautiful lady without getting disowned.
I think you're attractive too. If you'd like, perhaps we could go to dinner some night? I'll leave you my number.
"Perhaps the best way to get to her is to get her girlfriend in trouble," suggested Draco reasonably.
Ginny frowned, sneering at him. "Oi! Screw off."
"Have either of you seen Draco?" Harry's appearance was a disaster. Ebony black hair stood in every direction, partially due to the harsh winds that caused his face to take on a pinkish hue. Smears of depressing grey, along with muddy browns, covered Harry's tan skin. His emerald green eyes looked distant, as if he was with Draco, wherever he was.
He dreamed of worlds where he was simply an ordinary boy, a boy who'd never be mentioned twice. Instead of lordships and scandalous gossip that would destroy of the lives of those involved, he could have pets and a rather ordinary life. Although, in Draco's case, getting married to a fertile, beautiful, rich young woman was the most ordinary thing he could do- well, aside from having a heir with that woman. That life was simply not meant for him, the one that he was expected to lead.
"Maybe, b-but... but you should kiss me. Kissssss me good, w-would you? My... my lips are sooooo lonely," said Draco, unable to help the fact that his language was slightly slurred. He could handle his alcohol well, but even Draco had his limit- which he'd definitely pushed too far.
Anastasia Romiano-Not compatible, only speaks Romanian.
He knew where he'd go: the girl lavatory. Why? It was simply because it was the only place that one could be truly alone- save for Myrtle.
"I want to get rid of him!" Ginny exclaimed. "I hate him. He's such a boring troll, I can't even stand him!"
"Thank you," said Harry in a stiff tone, trying to gage the man.
Draco Potter smiled softly at Harry's antics, clearly pleased. Draco loved him, with all of his nerdy theories about Doctor Who- "he's in love with him you know. Also, I think he's going to die in the next episode." Some were way more complex, to the point Draco zoned out, staring at the beautiful man that he was lucky to call his. He was so kind, and that was one of the few things that Draco loved about him. Harry treated Draco like he was a celebrity, and while Draco pretended not to enjoy it, he surely did. "Thank you Harbear."
In which Draco has a beautiful dream that can never happen.
"Thanks Potty." Pansy gave Harry a pouty look, her eyes holding a hateful glare. Her lips them curled in a hateful snarl, making her face look more pug-like than usual. "Next time, I can get it for my little Blaise baby. We don't want your filthy germs on anything! Go pick up something else, like your mother's dead corpse or some ugly roses to place on the mudblood's grave."
"Just fantastic," spat Draco bitterly, before giving Pansy a smile. He could not be rude to her because his life was falling apart, that wasn't her fault. "Uhm... I'm still single."
Harry had just recently began to home a fascination for Astronomy. Before, he could have cared less about the sky, the moon, the sun, or the different galaxies although. He just never really cared for the topic much, believing his time would be better spent practicing defensive spells or something equally as important- not something as useless as studying the stars.
And Voldemort killed him too.
Until next time,
Pansy Parkinson- Possibly compatible.
And that had been enough for Harry to up and leave the dormitory. He ignored Hermione's frantic whispering about dangers lurking in the dark, choosing that her words would be encouragement to pick up his pace. He'd walked far away from them, as though they carried the plague. He'd just wandered slightly off course, and when he looked around, he was shocked to see he was standing in the Astronomy tower.
How did one go about even commenting on that? Ah yes, you're right. Let's have some pastries and sip some honey tea while laughing about Potter's death. It was pointless to ponder over, but it caused Draco's mood to darken, like the sky did before a northern downpour appeared.
Also Genderbent!Drarry. I was on a roll when I wrote this last year.
Floris Derocit- Not compatible, only speaks French.
Alexander Romiano- Not compatible, only speaks Romanian.
Molten silver eyes searched intensely in the mirror, almost like the mirror held the answers to everything. All of her snowy blonde hair was pulled into a very neat, fancy bun that her mother had given her merely hours earlier. Very faintly, Draco could see the highlighter that rested upon her sharp cheekbones. Lucious, pale bubblegum lips were coated in a thin layer of lipgloss, courtesy of Narcissa- she believed her daughter should look beyond perfect for her first day of her 'last' year at Hogwarts. Although Draco did notice that she was rather attractive, she couldn't help but feel that this just wasn't her.
"I mean, he's so extra. Like, really?" Pansy rolled her eyes. "He's a damn brat, that's all. He could fall down the stairs, and literally no one would care. I'd probably laugh and throw a party."
Instead, she wore a pair of black skinny jeans- she was allowed to, considering that it was the weekend, and one could wear whatever they desired on the weekend. A grey wool sweater with pink, yellow, and blue lines replaced the normally baggy shirts she wore. Harriet wasn't exactly very busty, but Draco did notice that she had nice thighs.
Voldemort studied the list long and hard. There were limited possibilities, especially considering that there were around three compatible teenagers. He wasn't surprised, considering how young Pureblood children were forced into an arranged marriage. There was also the fact that many Pureblood families married their own cousins in hopes of keeping the line pure and free of tainting, which worked out terribly considering that the children turned out to be insane or a squib.
Katherine Avery- Not compatible, marriage contract with Andrew Franklin.
"No problem," said Draco, sniffing around distastefully. "Let me know if you need anything else."
"It's not father," said Draco, before turning to Harry. "Are you ready to go?"
Daydreams, each and every one of them, varied from person to person. Some daydreams oozed with happiness, while others were just random, funny things that weren't even possible. Daydreams weren't confined to a single space, they could occur anywhere, at any time. They were truly strange, a phenomenon that Draco couldn't truly pinpoint.
Harry hummed. "Then be glad you're not me. My breathing annoys him. I think that if he could, he'd strangle me and hang me by my toes."
Out of character? Yes!
"Okay," said Voldemort. "I'll bury you with him. I can't risk it. No one talks about someone they hate like you. You loved him, and I can't risk you trying to get revenge."
Harry wasn't an exception to those harsh glares. The elderly couple across from him gave him dirty looks when he looked away from them, despite them not knowing him at all. A little child pointed at him with a trembling finger, asking if he was okay, because people don't eat alone at restaurants- at least, not the normal ones. He could just feel all of the judgmental looks being sent his way from the other diners.
Every date so far had been at Draco's place, well, mansion really. Wrought iron gates with the sprawling green grass made the place look so much more... luxurious. The beige siding had buckled on the side, due to the sun's heat- Draco was getting it fixed, but everyone was seemingly busy. The windows glistened under the sun's rays, making them look as though they were portal to another dimension. A rather simple crème white door with a wreath on it was the entrance to one of the simple most divine houses in the town.
The woman in the mirror was stunning, absolutely flawless. She was a regal noblewoman, capable of damaging the reputation of men that acted like scoundrels. Purely flawless was the woman in the mirror, a woman that earned respect because she was strong and independent. That woman wasn't her.
Noun- a profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe that triggers a deep emotional response.
Draco thought long and hard for a few seconds. Lucy wasn't such a terrible fiend, maybe the other dogs wouldn't be either. There wasn't hair all over the place, despite what Draco had originally believed there was going to be- he was glad for that, he didn't want to get dog hair on his rather expensive clothes. And seeing Harry smile brightly while talking about the little beasts made the idea of living with the little monsters tolerable.
Draco just rolled his eyes, smiling. His husband was the best.
Perhaps maybe Draco could overlook the dog thing. Maybe they weren't such terrible creatures after all.
"Yup. Great job," said Pansy flatly. She could have cared less, and her face showed such. She continued to finger a lock of her hair, trying her hardest not to frown. "But, you need to get those pesky Gryffindor runts in trouble. Big deal, you caught a Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw making out! We need to get that pesky Lavender girl, she called me a bitch earlier this week. And I don't know why!"
Now, the industry will seemingly never end. It seems as though there will always be people on display on magazines fronts, just waiting to be picked up and obsessed over. It seems as though there will always be these magazines, with their main stars being called whores by society- a fact that will be seemingly forgotten when people are getting off to their photos.
"He does seemed like the type to be a serial killer. Perhaps I should include that too! He also could be a serial killer and or has a serial killer kink. Thanks Harry!" Ginny smiled and stood up. "Maybe Luna will publish it in the Quibbler. Well, her father, but whatever."
It was almost like a Romeo and Juliet situation, but it was so much more complicated. At least Juliet knew Romeo existed.
"And now, all the women will love me. And I'll have a place in society," said Draco cheerfully.
Blaise grabbed his coat off the golden coatrack Draco had bought a while back and put it on before putting on his black dress shoes. "You're going to have a fun night too! Although, with those nails, maybe not."
And Draco saw the famous Harry Potter, one of the most beautiful people he'd ever seen, curled up against the sink, crying. He had his knees pulled to his chest, and his arms were pulled to around his legs, as if he were afraid of being ripped apart.
A beautiful woman was sitting on the white and black tiled floor. Her raven black hair was pulled into a ponytail by a bright blue ribbon, which looked ridiculous childish on her. Her eyes were the most bright, beautiful shade of emerald green that Draco had ever seen. A skimpy, lace white bra barely covered her breasts, which looked way too large to be real. Her stomach was much too thin, almost to the point that Draco would have been afraid to touch her had she been present. Tight white lace thongs barely covered her womanhood, but Draco guessed that was the purpose. The tan skin of her thighs had but a stretch mark, not even so much as an uneven tan. Her feet were angled away from the camera, hiding the soft skin of her foot.
"Are you just realizing this or...?" Harry was seated across from her, a thick book on Astronomy settled on his lap.
Hotel? Trivago.
Lucius got more irritable every time Draco failed to meet a girl that interested him. It was his son's job to produce at least one heir with a Pureblood lady, which was the least he could do, considering that everything was going to Draco. He was beginning to suspect that his son loved someone else, which would explain his son's odd behavior. Lucius could only hope that it wasn't the dumb Mudblood Granger or another useless Mudblood. All Lucius needed was for Draco to marry a useless Mudblood tramp, to disgrace the Malfoy name so greatly.
"My, my, a little bird's tells me you like guys with tattoos," whispered Pansy, nudging Draco.
"Mmm, I'm not surprised," said Harry nonchalantly. "I tend to do that to people. Perhaps I should work on my people skills."
"Hello," said Hermione politely. "Have either of you seen Harry? He said he was going to get a new jacket, but you know how he is."
"Hey honey," said Harry, opening the front door. "I'm glad to see you."
"Ahahaha!" Lucius threw his head back. "Hahaha! Now, that's absolutely hilarious. And here I was, thinking one couldn't get a good joke in Azkaban."
"What is it?" Draco questioned in a snotty tone, cocking one of her perfectly waxed blonde eyebrows. "What the hell did you buy me?"
@Sassyandsarcastic15
He was a pathetic excuse of a man, that was for sure.
Ever been interested in dating a man who doesn't bathe regularly, might be a vampire or a serial killer, hates every house except for Slytherin, teaches potions, has a potential vampire kink, dressed in all black, enjoys sneering at people, and hides in the dungeon like an overgrown bat? Well, you just might be in luck. Please meet the newest eligible bachelor, Mister Severus Snape of Hogwarts! All inquiries may be sent to students other than those in Slytherin.
"Hello sweetie," said another familiar voice. Dressed in a tan tee-shirt with a pair of black shorts, stood a smiling woman. Tuffs of brown hair stood in every direction, looking like a q-tip that had been in the wind. Around her neck was a silver necklace, with a beautiful blue elephant on it. She'd changed a little bit, but not enough that she wasn't unrecognizable.
In a matter of moments, both Draco and Harry were in the backseat of the limo. The windows, tinted incredibly dark, helped to keep out the sun's bright rays, which Draco was grateful for- he'd forgotten his sunglasses. Rich fabrics and countless hours of needlework, created the luxurious seats, which his father had handmade to please his every desire. The velvet material had but a stain, which wasn't a shock, considering that only the Malfoys were allowed to use the vehicle- exceptions included Draco Potter and the drivers that they Malfoys generously paid. Harry may have called a limo, but Lucius simply refused to have his son riding to a formal dance in a 'commoners' limo.
But you, I know you'll never leave. You were a special gift, as a matter of fact. Severus gave this to me, when I turned eleven. You were a birthday gift, wrapped in a simple black wrapping paper with a silk and green bow. You were a beautiful leather bound book, with an endless amount of pages due to a charm placed on you. My mother gave me a new quill-set, and I began writing in you. I never stopped.
And Draco realized he'd never be able to tell Harriet he loved her.
"Fifteen points from Gryffindor," said Malfoy in a snarky tone, giving Harry a wicked smile. "And another five for every minute that you aren't back in your common room."
"Perhaps you should, sir." Draco gave him a small nod, his Adam's Apple bobbing slightly. "Do you need anything else, sir?"
Harry opened the small, black leather bound book that Draco handed him. He scanned the receipt, cocking an eyebrow when he reads the price: £12.26. Although, he couldn't complain, considering that his taxes and drink were included. He pulled out his Hogwarts credit card, slipping it in the tab meant for checks.
His father just wanted everything to be normal- well, as normal as they could be. He wanted his family to fit this perfect image that he created, and he tried his hardest to mold his family into that image. He didn't care that he hurt his family in doing such, only caring that the public saw him smiling with the perfectly pure family. It didn't matter that Narcissa almost died giving birth to Draco, it only mattered that she wouldn't be able to have another child- Lucius always imagined having at least two children, preferably one girl and one boy. It didn't matter that Draco wanted to learn how to play the violin, it only mattered that his son could fly and perform spells at a young age. His family didn't matter.
"Did I forget to mention that your father is throwing a ball that he expects us to attend?" Harry smirked at the woman who'd said something rather... hateful, seeing her gasp. "I really do think Lucius likes me."
Love,
What if he died tomorrow?
"I know the description I'd put," Ginny said, smiling proudly. She'd clearly been thinking about it for a while, if the smile on her lips was anything to go by.
It was then that Voldemort realized that he should look through the Death Eater's children. After all, many of them had children or grandchildren that could be a compatible love interest for Harry. And if those children knew what was good for them, they'd play along in loving Harry- even if they detested him greatly. Voldemort made a list and checked off reasons they weren't compatible or why they were.
"How dare you assume I've went feral?" snarled Lucius, breathing heavily. He reached out again, trying once again to scratch Harry's face.
I think the train is starting to slow. I have to be done writing for right now. Wish me luck!
Ginny laughed, twirling a strand of her strawberry colored hair. "We simply had the most amazing, passionate, sensual relationship. We had the most blissful, pleasuring sex. Why the hell we he stoop to your level? You think you could ever give him what I could?"
Do I care? Maybe.
Alicia Carrow- Not compatible, insane.
It confused the hell out of her. She just didn't know who she really was, what she was supposed to do with herself, or even how she was supposed to feel. It almost felt that the girl- no, young woman- in the mirror wasn't her but a different woman entirely.
She had such smooth looking tan skin, almost as smooth as a babies- given, it could have been photoshop, but still. Draco could only imagine how- no, it was time to stop write there.
"I did a brilliant job Pansy. I caught Lynn and Emily getting a little to comfortable in the hallway nearest the kitchen." Draco puffed out his chest, smiling at Pansy. He fluttered his long snowy eyelashes at her, his bright silver eyes glimmering with pride. He wiped off his Prefects badge proudly, despite there being no reason for him to need to do such.
This wasn't possible, it just didn't make sense. Draco would never do any of this, he just would. Why would he? He had no family that would support him, and even if he did, he'd never go back to them after the stuff they did.
But as a preteen, he met a friend who loved him deeply. He'd introduced himself Ronald Weasley, a poor redhead with too many siblings to count. Ron changed the way Harry's heart work, imprinting himself upon Harry's heart permanently. It was truly overwhelming for Harry at first, all of the sweet gestures that Ron did to show Harry how much he loved him. It was almost like their souls had been designed for each other, to become each other's best friends. It was a permanent friendship, one that would run deeper than anyone thought it would.
"Hedwig is a rescue dog. She came with her name, so I never found a reason to change it. As for Dobby, I asked my friend Ron for some names. I thought he said 'Dobby' rather than 'Bobby', and I just chose to roll with it. I was watching Doctor Who, and there was a character called Lucy Saxon. I thought about naming her River Song, but she seemed like a Lucy." Harry smiled amusedly up at Draco.
"Yes, you filthy halfbreed creature," said Pansy in a rude tone. She continued to give him the most withering look, as if she kept looking at him like that for long enough that he'd drop on the floor.
"Oh," said Draco. "Well, if it comforts you, I like guys."
Harry Potter
"Of course I'm a real treat," said Draco, holding a hand to his chest as if he were offend. "It is just that no one's hungry for a good snack."
Harry had never tried to hide what he thought of those who committed adultery.Harry knew that it was more than just kissing, simply because he'd been standing there long enough to have heard majority of their conversation. Harry was going to leave, for good. He thought that adulterers were the worst, considering that Harry's first ex was also a cheater. He thought that they were dirty and vile, never thinking about those that they hurt.  It stood against everything that Harry stood for.
"Can I ask where you came up with the ideas for these names?" Draco gently rubbed Lucy's head from where she was in Harry's arms, which caused her tail to wag.
Turkish Noun- a daydream that brings happiness.
Their lips collided, their arms moving to pull each other closer in a desperate attempt for more friction between the two. Their tongues continued to collide, crashing against each other like the waves. It was a frantic, desperate kiss that was filled with need and longing, perhaps for each other or a loving, romantic partner.
Benjamin Franklin Clairston-Lestrange- Not compatible, blood traitor.
And then, they get tossed aside like trash from a fast moving vehicle on the interstate. Once they gain a visible stretch mark or some other sort of visible flaw, they're immediately discarded, replaced by a younger, new person. If they don't fade away from the attention of the media, they're fat-shamed, with the most cruel and vile nicknames to accompany that. So many negative articles come out that one feels as though they shouldn't pay any attention to the old model, but rather to the heavily breasted new girl who has the most beautiful smile or the even more muscled man with better hair. In a couple months, the new model will begin to fade, their beauty tainted in some way.
Twenty five years ago, James Potter, was driving home with Lily and their one year old son- Harry James Potter. Darkness enveloped them, fought off only by the bright headlights of James's car. The narrow road that led to the smaller groups of backroads, which eventually led the Potter Cottage was always dangerous to drive on- especially during the night. A shrill scream from Lily came too late, too late for James to pull out of the way of a drunk driver. Both Lily and James died, while their son Harry survived only with a lightening shaped scar.
Noun- going out alone to a movie or restaurant.
"I won't," said Draco, nearly sobbing.
Harry gave Luna a dark look, his nose scrunching. "That's mean. I loved Draco, I'm going to marry him."
"No problem," said Cho, her voice holding a tone of disappointment. She was a simple waitress lady, in a restaurant in the middle of the mall. It figured that the one relatively attractive man that came to the place sorted her into the boring category before she even got to make an actual impression. Chances were that he was a psychopath anyways, considering the fact that he was eating alone- it was strange, no thirty year old in this town partook in dinner alone.
Draco groaned. "I was just curious. Wasn't like I was going to go blab to Snape."
In the story, Romeo had noticed the beauty of the thirteen year old virgin and fallen into what he believed was love. And Juliet, the thirteen year old virgin, had returned feelings for Romeo which she proclaimed was love- perhaps it might have had something to do with the fact she didn't love Paris, the elderly suitor her mother picked out for her.
"Hi," said Draco, cautiously stepping into Harry's flat.
The perfect middle class family's underage son threw a party while his parents were away, inviting over all of his underage buddies. Alcohol was passed around like a collection bucket was at church. Teenagers gave into the desires of their lust, ignoring the morals that their parents tried to instill in them. Time passed in blurs, everything overlapping. By the morning, not a soul could remember what happened the night previous. It wasn't only the middle class family's son that threw parties, any teenager could throw a party when their parents went out of town.
The people at the party were rich, wild and unpredictable. A lady in a frilly dress leaned against the hallway outside the hallway, while a man in a shiny mask continued to rake his hands farther up his thighs. A businessman in a black suit had fallen over in the middle of the dance floor, while his wife continued to drink her champagne. A lady dressed in a beautiful tan dress continued to dance with her wife, who was dressed in a beautiful crimson cocktail dress. The politician's husband performed some rather devious things with two of the party guests in the back of his husband's limo, while his said husband ate a couple snacks and continued to search for his husband in the crowd of people. A woman and her husbands chatted in the corner of the room, judging people silently. Everyone was every different, especially in the party scene.
His eyes, which were bright with curiosity, moved towards the sky. It was so beautiful that he also didn't know what to do. Glowing a beautiful, pure white were some of the most brightest stars in the sky. The crescent moon glowed bright in the darkness of the galaxy, almost as if beckoning Harry towards the sky. The darkness, the space between where the stars danced and glimmered, almost seemed to spark. It was overly beautiful, Harry realized.
"She requested to be moved to a different table," said Draco indifferently, as if he could have cared less. "So I was asking to take care of you."
"Thanks sweetie." Draco smiled at him, accepting the warm cup of tea offered to him. Cautiously, he wrapped his fingers around the blue tea cup. He took a sip, wincing when the burning hot liquid began to slid down his throat. "Are Rosetta and Esmeralda ready to go to their grandparents' house?"
Blaise Zabini was harder to place. His mother remained neutral, unless her lover at the time picked a side. Their loyalty bounced all over the place, and Lord Voldemort couldn't risk something this important. This was especially true, considering that he could make sure everything would work out perfectly.
Harry has multiple dogs, which is expected since he’s a dog lover. Draco, well, hates dogs.
Azkaban was so dark and gloomy that Lucius almost forgot the concept of happiness altogether. Everyone was grey and black in color, white an ounce of a bright color. The sun's bright rays never touched the island that Azkaban was on, much less entered the cell that Lucius was staying in. Everything was covered in a dark colored substance, which only gave the place more gloomy feels, although he was sure that the floor wouldn't be neon pink if it was properly cleaned.
"Mr.Potter, I thought we settled everything last Friday," said Draco, his tone neutral. Despite wanting to move on and pretend that Harry didn't cause his pupils to dilate or his pulse to quicken, Draco simply couldn't do it. His fairly muscled chest was hidden by a royal purple color shirt, with white buttons that looked ready to be unbuttoned. The black trousers he wore gently hugged his lean legs, and Draco was trying not to let his eyes wander too far. Harry Potter was beautiful, and he was going to be the death of Draco if he kept it up.
Harry Potter was the 'Impossible Boy,' sort of. He should be dead, but he just didn't die- at least not permanently. He seemed to be able to do things that he definitely shouldn't be able to, such as being seventeen and defeating a Dark Lord that had tormented hundreds of adults. He was also ridiculously attractive, so there was that. Honestly, it wouldn't surprise Draco to learn that Potter managed to bless the rains of Africa from a mall in the United Kingdom. Harry was strange in many ways, almost to the point of being eccentric.
Smiling has somehow become associated with innocence. And for that, humanity tricked itself greatly.
"As if I'm the one with the over inflated ego," cooed Harry. That statement was simply hilarious, considering that the Malfoy lineage was known for being cocky, arrogant, snobby, and having over inflated egos. Although Draco had become less arrogant and snobby (considering he married a tattoo artist that his parents weren't fond of- at first), he still had the over inflated ego problem. In Draco's eyes, he was simply the most stunning bloke that God ever made, with Harry coming in second place- Harry agreed with that statement.
And so the industry thrives.
"Oh darling, you're telling me what I already know." Blaise shifted on the couch. "I'm gonna take my leave. I bought me one too. I'm going to have a good, good night."
"We're dating now Father," said Draco Malfoy. He looked rather pissy, as if he'd rather be anywhere but where he was. His voice was strained, as if every word that tumbled out pained him greatly.
Both of his parents smiled proudly at him, their eyes gleaming with pride.
Everyone, in some way, shape, or form, has a weak spot. For some people, it is their family, the thought of losing their entire family enough to get them to back down. For others, it was losing their identity, to not know who they really are. Some individuals' weak spots are having a powerful, dark secret revealed, which could cause their world to spiral downwards. Of course, those are just a couple of the more generic, basic weak spots. But no matter how hard you try, you'll always have an Achilles's heel.
Draco wasn't a flawless, stunning woman. She was the disgraceful Pureblood daughter of a Death Eater. She ruined her own reputation and the reputation of her mother, simply by running around with a Dark Mark on her arm- although, Draco wasn't responsible for that cursed tattoo being there. Draco was a flawed, cold woman that only gained respect because people feared her father and his rather large fortune- one word in his ear from his daughter was enough to ruin anyone's reputation. Draco wasn't really strong, considering that she wanted to run and snuggle with someone during a thunderstorm because she was scared.
Harry turned and left on the spot. He got in his car and drove far away.
Even once Draco grew closer to the age where he was expecting to be married off, he still felt nothing for any of the females his parents introduced him to. All of them were boring and seemed to possess no personality whatsoever. All of them were stuck-up twits that were only interested in Draco for the Malfoy fortune or for the idea of the gaining more leverage and power. Simply none of them possessed a bone in their body that actually cared the slightest hint about him,   except for potentially in a sexual aspect.
"Right. I remember what happened between the two of you now!" Draco smiled at her, which made her lose the smile. "You hurt him. Of course, I know! You had the most scandalous affair with best friend's boyfriend."
Draco sighed, realizing that he simply wasn't designed to be a part of Harry's life. That was rather apparently, considering that he had an evil ex, and he wasn't interested in Draco. Instead of showing how disappointed he was, he instead allowed his work to swallow him whole again.
It wasn't only because Draco had the largest crush on Potter; it was living, undeniable humanity and softness that flowed throughout Draco's mind like his blood did that caused that reaction. Draco might have pushed and shoved, but he never wanted things to go to the extent they did- before long, it was all unstoppable. It was like a snowball, with each little thing making the first problem this monster that no one wanted to face. And it was all too much for Draco to handle alone.
And there's that damn Potter.
Draco cursed, ignoring the withering look sent her way by the man next to her. It was apparent that he was disapproved of her cursing, although she wasn't really in the mood to care what he thought- she never really cared what anyone thought anyways. As far as she was concerned, he could shove his problem with her cursing right up his arse. Although, knowing her luck, he'd probably turn out to be some important figure in her life- that was how her life seemed to work.
"Hmm... a root beer with a Scrandy's Special Salad," said Harry, not bothering to look up from his menu. The glossy pages, filled with bright pictures of food that never came out that way and unique fonts meant to catch the eye, was a good place for Harry to stare as to avoid dealing with a waitress that would likely hit on him upon seeing his face. "Thanks."
"Oh, I forgot to introduce you. That's Lucy. Hedwig is in the living room, she's a poodle. And then Dobby's in the living room too!" Harry smiled proudly at Lucy, picking her up and kissing her head.
Noun- a flaw that causes the downfall of a hero.
"Hey," said Draco awkwardly, scratching the back of his neck. So that wasn't in the speech Draco's mind created.
It was scandalous enough that Harriet Potter was raised by two men, two men who were married to each other- it didn't matter that they were in love or anything like that. Although, that simply wasn't the most scandalous part. It was believed that Harriet's father, James Potter, had a criminal record, although no one knew what he did.
"Well, if it isn't my dearest friend," said a familiar voice.
Astronomy was something Harry was starting to find interesting. It wasn't something he'd ever pursue a career in, but he did find the Greek mythological stories about the stars beautiful. They were tragically beautiful, each story seemingly sadder than the last. The stars were so beautiful, each glowing brightly in the sky- Harry would sneak up to the Astronomy tower late at night to see them sometimes- more specifically every Friday at one in the morning.
"Hello Potter. Good to see you've changed!" exclaimed Draco hurriedly.
"Go away," snapped Draco irritably. He brushed her arm off, walking far away her. Draco just continued to walk far away, smiling as he did such.
"Don't fret darling, I'll get the door for you." Harry Potter was quick to get the door for his soulmate, ignoring the strange looks that he received. With his messy raven colored hair in a ponytail, he looked like what some would consider 'a troublesome punk'. The leather jacket and ripped black skinny jeans surely didn't help, although half of the mall shoppers were just bitchy Karens- they really didn't count.
The feelings was so powerful that it swept Harry off his feet. It caused the Savior of the Wizarding World to question what he thought was love, to question the treatment of the muggles that raised him. The feeling was so powerful, so deeply amazing that it seemed to rewrite his soul.
"Oh dear, you can't be serious!" Pansy gave Draco a scandalized look. "Oh, you are. That's absolutely terrible. I know plenty of single people that'd think you're a really treat!"
"I'll keep that in mind." Harry gave her a smile.
His gaze moved to the sky, almost as if expecting to see his parents' Angels descend from the Heavens and give him some one-on-one. That would be very helpful, considering that they might have some sort of advice that would set Harry back on the right path. They could give him a goodnight kiss like he wished he received as a small child, before floating back towards the Heavens.
"Mmm, sure," said Harry. "You have protection or...?"
Huge mansions, owned by rich businessmen and political figures, were home to some of the largest parties. No one knew of the scandalous parties, the ones where the underage kids drank until they collapsed. No party guest could remember the name of the person they had shared an intimate night with, nor could they remember the amount of drinks they had. And in the end, they did it again.
"Hello 'Mione," said Harry sweetly, smiling innocently at her. "Hello Pansy... and Draco Malfoy."
Given, this was very true. He hated his father with every once of his being, just because his father was an enormous arse. A gigantic prick, if Draco was blunt. It was common knowledge that his father hated Half-bloods and muggleborns, probably more than hated the average muggle. His father made his views very obvious- they were printed on the front of magazines, written in countless books, carved into his arm in the shape of a tattoo that meant much more, and various other things.
Draco had known that Harry loved dogs, he knew this before their first date. It was very easy to tell, considering that Harry frequently mentioned his love for dogs, it wasn't a dark, hidden secret of his. Although, Draco would feel a lot more at ease if a love for dogs was his dark secret, rather than whatever secrets he did manage to hide.
What this story failed to mention was practically everything that happened that wasn't perfect. It was a well crafted lie, leaving everything negative that happened out. "Of course I went to Pansy's house, she was having a party! We shared a bottle of beer while playing strip poker, talked about the sexually scandalous stuff we got up to in Hogwarts Academy, had more beer while we nibbled on snacks, and we went to her bedroom to finish what we started back in the Academy. And then, I passed out in her bed, naked next to her."
"And it's your choice Harry. It's entirely up to you, whether you give him a chance or whether you think he's not worth your time. And I know that you won't trust him right off, and I understand that. But you need to know that not every person is out to screw you over. Not everyone wants to hurt you.
Instead, it was expected of him to continue the Malfoy lineage once he turned of age- underage pregnancies were simply scandalous, even in the Wizarding World. Instead of picking cherries and smelling the flowers, he was instead expected to pick out a wife, or at least narrow down his options. Instead of running through flower fields, he was expected to take on the role of a stuck-up young Lord, one whom would one day have enough power to flip around the way the Ministry was run.
"Does he really say that?" Harry Potter asked with a smug grin.
Outside, the streets were filled with cabs and other cars speeding by. Sidewalks were filled with pedestrians walking about, headed to and from different compartment stores. Above head, the sky filled with dark clouds, so dark that they almost looked more black than grey, that promised to downpour on London later in the day. Billboards were filled with bright words and colorful photos, each carefully modified to attract certain types of buyers.
And Harry just kept running.
After the war was done, he up and left. No one knew where, nor were they sure why he left. Before he did up and disappear, he broke up with Ginny Weasley. Of course, there was an uproar after he left, most fearing that he'd turn dark or that he'd been forced into leaving. And Draco, despite his seemingly careless exterior, was slightly worried about the Gryffindor.
Draco was strongly ignoring his urges to run over to her and confess the fact that he was simply in love with her. Nevertheless, he simply couldn't do such a thing, something so... ridiculous. Something so mundane would earn him heaps of trouble, especially when considering Potter's rather... questionable reputation. Rumors, though most were simply the work of dramatic people, were enough to earn one the hatred of Lucius Malfoy.
"Very good," said Narcissa Malfoy, the dance teacher- she was also Draco's mother. Underneath of her expensive dress, which was silver in color, was a corset- she was a noblewoman after all. Her face was extremely beautiful, the thin bit of makeup that coated her face helping to hide the fact that she was slowly starting to age. Her snowy blonde hair was pulled into a neat bun, making her look even more noble. Her  lips, coated in a raspberry red color, were pressed in a thin line. "Run along, Miss Potter."
Eating alone was almost like wearing a shiny badge that said, 'I'm the psychopath that murdered both of your parents'. It simply wasn't normal, at least not in the tiny town where everyone knew each other's darkest secrets. It was frowned upon, simply because it was abnormal.
"Hmm... you're right!" Harry gave Lucius a smile that off threw Lucius greatly. "Trying to scratch out a person's eyes or their face is one hundred percent normal. Just another reminder of how perfectly ordinary you are, Mister."
Harry had left without so much as a goodbye.
"Oh, there he is," said Hermione, waving and summoning him from where she was standing.
And Draco laughed, while Lucius Malfoy began to scream at the top of his lungs about disgraceful sons and having that disgraceful son come and take him far from Azkaban.
"I'll find a seat elsewhere," said the Ravenclaw student, standing up slowly. His fingers wrapped around the plastic hand on his suitcase, which he then began to lightly tug on. "I'm sure that Harriet Potter doesn't curse this much."
Draco looked at Pansy curiously. "You like females?"
"Oh... err, okay," said Draco. He slowly walked down to his desk and put his head in his hands. Strands of his perfectly styled snowy blond colored hair fell into his face, which he didn't bother moving. His molten silver eyes stared aimlessly around the office, seeing Pansy and Ginny walking. No longer did it matter that he dressed extra perfect for the day, with a nice green and grey tie, with a pressed new white shirt and tan trousers, for it had not worked to persuade the beauteous Harry Potter to even give him more than two minutes of his precious time.
They'd been dating for a three years, after Draco chose to rebel against his family. He'd changed so much that Harry couldn't help but fall head over heals in love, it was impossible to avoid. After all, Harry wasn't able to help his attraction to other seekers- he had a type.
Harry smirked. "And here I was, thinking the same thing about you."
As to avoid a marriage to a man she disliked, Juliet faked her own death. The priest was unable to get word to Romeo, and after hearing Juliet was dead through his messenger, Romeo returned to Verona. He went to Juliet's grave, killed Paris, and upon seeing Juliet's dead body, committed suicide.
Noun- a person who loves tattoos and/or piercings.
"He gave me a detention because he caught me kissing Luna in the hallway! The overgrown dungeon bat needs to get a damn social life or a romantic partner," said Ginny irritably. "Do you know if they have a column in the newspaper to advertise single people?"
"Oi! Mind having some manners?" His voice was unusually thick, almost like he had an accent that wasn't one hundred percent 'the standard English accent'. It was very likely that he was Scottish, considering that he hadn't pulled out a Bible like the Irish were said to do.
"I know you wouldn't," said Millicent earnestly. "You come to me for dating advice, because you're awful at flirting. 'Oh Saint Potter, please notice me and kiss me. Oh Potter, come over here and tell me I'm pretty'."
However, anyone can smile. Smiles don't have the ability to keep themselves off the faces of dangerous or sad people. Murderers can still smile at the girl boarding the train, even if they just slaughtered a man in cold blood the previous night. The man who lied to the detectives investigating the disappearance of a small child gave them a warm smile as they left his house, despite him knowing fully well where that little child is. The lady who won't wake up tomorrow smiled at the butcher, seemingly fine. People don't even care, as long as the other individual smiles.
Janet Carrow- Not compatible, only speaks Italian.
The salad was made beautifully, Harry realized with a hint of satisfaction. A raspberry colored dressing was drizzled neatly over the perfect colored lettuce. Sprinkled with a few croutons and little red cherry tomatoes, it looked appetizing, considering that Harry wasn't extremely hungry. Very few onions were sprinkled as well, adding a nice amount of crunch to the salad, along with a distinct taste that Harry appreciated.
Harry's smile only grew. "You know Miss Parkinson, I think that's a brilliant idea. I'll buy roses." Harry turned to walk away. "Oh, and Miss Parkinson?"
Draco didn't know what to expect, nor was he sure that he wanted to know. The flat was likely overrun by dogs, considering that Harry was the sort of person that would say "no, bad dog". And the worse part was the inevitable amount of dog fur, which was likely to cover all of the surfaces. It was be gross and disgusting, to the point that Draco would have to leave and breakup with the man- he wasn't dealing with all of the fur.
"I... I am," said Harry in a dumbfounded voice. He didn't even care that he had just given Malfoy blackmail information, it just felt good to be a little truthful about something. Maybe he didn't know why he was crying, but that didn't matter to him.
"No," answered Ginny quickly, ducking a spell sent her way. Quickly, she sent back a spell of her own and heard the person on the receiving end yowling. "I haven't seen him. Sorry."
"Get the hell out of my home," said Draco, nearly kicking Blaise as he got off the couch. "You disgusting, horny bastard."
Harriet Potter simply infuriated Draco Malfoy to no end. Although, sometimes, frustrate was the more proper word, and it didn't always mean in an annoying sense. Draco found herself rather... flustered by the girl, more so than she'd like to admit. It confused and irritated Draco beyond belief, almost driving her insane at times. Draco realized that Potter very well could have been her breaking point.
She stood, looking flabbergasted. A pinkish hue filled her cheeks, which then turned into an ugly shade of cherry red. "Screw you Potter."
Harry looked up from where he'd been staring, she was already gone. She didn't give him time to thank her, but it might have been because she was on edge with him. He supposed it was reasonable, considering that he was eating alone, and he did look fairly intimidating.
"Let me know if you need another drink," said Draco in an equally stiff tone.
And Draco loved things that captivated him, that managed to hold his interest. He'd been brought up to have anything he wanted, simply by mentioning it to his parents. If he wanted it, he got it on a silver platter the next morning. But Harry wasn't a simple plaything.
"I think they've lost one of their patients," said Harry, wrapping his arms around Draco's waist as they left.
"Sorry 'bout that. Wrong cabin," said a boy, closing the door with a gentle click. Draco watched the chocolate haired boy skip away, realizing that she'd once again zoned out- that shouldn't have surprised her as much as it did. She really needed to stop zoning out, considering that she couldn't afford to let her grades slip.
No, this isn’t sexual. No, there’s not smut.
Draco gave him one of her sweetest smiles, telling him exactly where he could shove his manners. None of these things were exactly appropriate for a Pureblood, especially a female, to say, but Draco vaguely said something along the lines of, "Screw that. I'll do whatever I please." Besides, it wasn't like any man would be turned off because off her swearing, considering that no man was interested in her. It seemed that the Dark Mark was a very effective method of keeping men away, no matter how faded it got.
"Oh please," said Pansy with a wink. "It'll give my husband more chances to cherish me."
"Absolutely." Harry had no idea where this would led. But regardless, he had to have faith in the fact that Draco turned out to be as kind as he seemed. And trying to trust someone new was the only way to find out.
Adam Carrow- Not compatible, insane.
Sincerely,
Harry had already run away from her, headed towards where he believed the Dark Lord would be. He nearly tripped on his own feet and somebody's body- this war wasn't going that superb, despite the useless encouragement that the teachers yelled.
Draco lazily fingered her skirt, toying with the short emerald green fabric. Out of pure boredom, she stood up and grabbed her suitcase off of the luggage rack. She searched her bag until she found her mirror, which she immediately grabbed before sipping her bag.
It was December twenty-third, and Draco was having a party at his mansion. Large chandeliers hung from the ceiling, the champagne of the guests sparkling under the lighting. The previously well scrubbed floors, which almost seemed to shine under the lights, were now filled with footprints and spilled champagne. The ballroom walls, painted a gentle lilac color, were now hidden behind several individuals who were leaning against the wall.
Kevin Avery- Not compatible, insane.
"What?" cried Draco. "I've served you loyally for all this time! I still serve you, my Lord. Please, I'm still your servant."
"Oi Malfoy!" Draco could have fainted at seeing Harry standing there. His frame was leaning on the outer wall that formed the cubical Draco sat in. Emerald green eyes stared intensely into the molten silver eyes that were filled with unspoken questions.
"A gift," said Blaise in an innocent tone. Dark coffee colored eyes stared intensely at Draco, as if he'd be able to read her reaction like one reads a book. His tone was rather prideful, as if he knew that she was going to like the gift he'd gotten her.
"Gladly," said Harry with a smirk.
Number One: Never mess with Ginny Weasley, or else you'll be stuck getting letters asking about free times to go on dates in the middle of your potion's class.
With dark emerald green eyes, filled with a darkness that had formed due to the harsh environment he'd grown up in, most people chose that was enough to turn him away. If that didn't turn them away, the dark stubble on his tan face did true miracles. The scars that littered his arms, all of different shapes and origins, tended to send people fleeing in the other direction- and those weren't even all the scars that littered his lithe frame. It took very close inspection to notice all of these things, so most people never noticed it- they only got creeped out by his intense stare.
"Pansy, shut the hell up," said Draco with a sneer. "I'm leaving. Go act like that with someone else."
"Sounds fair," said Harry. "Is that the Quibbler?"
"This is exactly why dad left you," said a girl that appeared to be her daughter. "And why I live with him."
"Y'know, calling Ginny and congratulating her on her engagement, making sure that our kitten Snowball didn't break anything, and stop by the store. And possibly, if you're willing, you." Harry's arm snaked around Draco's waist, pulling him closer. "Come along dear, I called a limo."
"No," said Harry gently, picking up his fork. He ignored the water spots on it. "Thank you for asking."
"Hmm..." pondered Harry aloud, "Then who are you? Lucius Grey? Lucius Smith?"
Hailey Avery- ? No one knows?
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course I would darling. Will dinner tonight at The Three Broomsticks at around five o'clock work?" Draco was pleasantly surprised to see Harry's blush deepen.
Lucius began to laugh again, harder than he planned on laughing. "This is so ridiculous that it's funny. Not really, but it definitely is, considering that I know this is a terrible joke."
Inside, everything looked rich, almost to the point that it felt foreign and wrong to so much as graze it. Everything was dust free, courtesy of Draco's maids- Pansy, Millicent, Daphne, and Astoria. Golden chandeliers, each costing anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars, illuminated the clean furniture. The fine furniture was dark in color, without so much as a dent or scratch upon the surface. But most importantly, there was no room for a dog or any other sort of pet upon the expensive leather couch.
But Voldemort knew Harry didn't love Ron Weasley in a romantic way. That would not stop Harry from sacrificing himself for the said redhead, but Lord Voldemort decided early on that it would be much easier to get Harry to sacrifice himself for his romantic partner. There was always a chance that Ron could get a romantic partner that was willing to sacrifice themselves for him.
Raven black hair stuck up messily in every direction, which wasn't anywhere's near a cute messy. With thin rimmed black glasses, which looked well in need of replacement, she looked kind of nerdy- still not in an attractive manner. Her tan skin was a bit tanner, likely from the amount of Quidditch practice she'd fit in her schedule. A thin layer of black eyeliner framed her emerald green eyes, which made her eyes stand out- even with the glasses. Her frame was usually hidden by baggy clothing that looked like third generation hand-me-downs, which very well could have been the reason Draco hadn't really noticed her.
Draco Malfoy looked beautiful. Dressed in a grey suit with a silver and green tie, he looked similar to how he did back at the Academy. Platinum blond hair was jelled back, not so much as a strand out of the way. The lighting only seemed to make his cheekbones more sharp than usual, which very well could have been partially due to the fact he was wearing highlighter. His normally pale face was flushed, likely because of how drunk he was- the fact that Pansy wasn't trying to hide the fact that she wanted to have sex with him truly wasn't helping. Topped off with a beautiful golden watch that Harry had bought him, Draco looked rather ravishing. Standing in the middle of the ballroom floor, he seemed to fit in perfectly.
"Shut up halfbreed," snarled Lucius, throwing himself into the bars of his prison cell. He reached his arm out, his dirty nails nearly scratching Harry's face.
The first night that he truly realized how truly beautiful the galaxy had been a Friday night. Early in the week, he'd grown extremely aggravated with both Hermione and Ron. They were lying to him, and it appeared that they had been doing such for quite some time. And that particular Friday, Ron gained enough nerve to call Harry a 'poor excuse of a friend'.
Harriet Potter was simply stunning, her beauty enough to freeze him in his tracks. Her emerald green eyes, which were framed by black eyeliner, were the most beautiful shade of green that Draco had ever seen. She was cursed with the gift of curves, which wasn't at all the reason that Draco was simply intrigued by her- in love with her to be rather honest. Her tan skin glimmered with sweat, which wasn't surprising, considering the fact that she'd been dancing for over three hours roughly. A pitch black one-piece bodysuit was tightly fit to her frame, the same item she'd wear to the dance recital next Friday. Ebony black hair was pulled into a neat bun, a few strands out of place.
"You deserve someone that loves you, regardless of who they are. I don't care if you marry a plumber, a singer, a mechanic, an actor, an office worker, a doctor, or any other sort of profession. I just want to see you be happy, to see you smile again. It's been so long since I've seen you smile.
Voldemort didn't trust the Parkinson spawn not to screw up. She was much too arrogant and self-centered for someone like Harry Potter to love. The man doubted that Harry wanted to hear gossip about his other best friends- Hermione, Neville, Luna, and Ginny- that was truly hateful. He also doubted that Potter wanted to hear about skirts, makeup, the latest fashion trends, who was marrying who, and the other things that Pansy was obsessed with. It wasn't that Pansy was particularly terrible, but she would be terrible for Harry.
"- gotta go. Bye everyone." Harry waved goodbye to the group. He walked over to Draco and handed him a small, folded up note before continuing to walk off.
"Hey love. I made you a cuppa tea." Raven black hair stood in every direction, revealing a scar that looked like a lighting bolt on his forehead. His tan skin seemed to gleam under the light, making him look almost ethereal, like what Draco imagined an angel to look like. The heavenly white shirt he wore was tight enough to show all of his muscle, which made Draco stiffen a bit. Otherwise, he only wore a pair of flannel boxer shorts, which only added to the problem Draco had to face. Harry Potter was beautifully handsome, and he knew it.
It was then Draco realized what needed to be done. Draco Malfoy neared his crush and wrapped his arms around him.
Harry shrugged. "No idea."
Lucius Malfoy maintained his rather distant, cold look, his eyes conveying his emotions instead. While his lips continued to remain in a frown, his eyes held a warmth that was unusual for him- a look that was used more frequently with his wife and son (well, occasionally with his son's husband). Dressed in a white tuxedo, his eyes scanned over his son and his son's husband, immediately tutting over Harry's clothing choices. "Pity. Here I was, thinking that perhaps you finally got a fashion sense."
Harry wanted to paint it out, so that he'd never forget. It was so beautiful, simply breathtaking, to be forgotten just because. Water paints would do alright, but he almost thought that he'd prefer acrylic paint, if only so that he had slightly more control with how the painting turned out. He thought that would be wonderfully stress relieving, as soon as he tuned out the voice that screamed out that he was doing it all wrong.
Sometimes, you're my only confident. Talking to another person makes me feel... strange, like they're only listening so they can judge me or have good blackmail on me. Hell, I hope no one ever finds this, considering the amount of sensitive information I've written in here. All I need is for someone to find this, much less tell everyone what they read in the diary of 'lonely, confused, misunderstood' Draco Malfoy. I don't need that attention.
Draco stared at the doorway, unable to help the tears that ran down his face. He ignored the lady and her husbands whispering in the corner. He ignored the ladies that stopped dancing on the dance floor, heading out for the night to never return to Draco's mansion. He even ignored Pansy, who was looking as if the angel Gabriel had come down and told her she was pregnant with the next Savior. Draco just continued to stare numbly at the door, unable to believe it.
Blaise Zabini-Possibly compatible.
"They can't be brothers, unless the mother cheated. Can't you tell, one's white and the other's tan?" A woman stalked by, her hair cut into a bob. Dressed in a red polka dot shirt and shorts, she looked to be around roughly forty years old. The meanest scowl was resting on her face, which didn't make her look very attractive.
"Oh Saint Potter," said Draco in a mocking tone, "Please stay and pleasure me."
People piss me the hell off. They're loud, irritating, hateful- and worse, usually breathing. All I want is to be left alone, but they come over and bother you with stupidness. And then, they had the audacity to get all pissy when you tell them to go screw themselves. Like, if you don't want to be told off, you shouldn't bother me. People are also so damn fake that you can't tell what's real and fake with them.
Draco Malfoy- Possibly compatible.
Black wrought iron gates, spiraling high above the limo, was the first sign that they were at the Malfoys' Manor. Moments later, servants were opening the gates, smiling at the group inside the limo.
"Yes, my dragon, I have never been more ready to go," said Harry in a gentle tone, before shooting Lucius a dark, withering look. "By the way, we might want to call the mental hospital."
The answer was simple of course.
Harriet turned around, smiling softly at Draco. "Hi."
He loved the partying, the way the alcohol burned the back of his throat. He loved waking up in another person's bed, regardless of whether it was that of a male or female- he never remembered waking up in the bed of someone who identified as neither. He loved the loud thrum of the music played by the DJ, given that he was sober- loud noises hurt when he was hungover. He was simply addicted to the party life.
"Why's that?" asked Draco in a curious tone.
"Good job Draco. You did very good," said the Dark Lord blankly. It was rather obvious that he could have cared less, but Draco didn't seem to notice.
Noun- fear of trusting people due to past experiences with relationships gone bad.
Harry stared into Lucius's eyes, his hard gaze never wavering. His emerald green eyes were so dark that they almost looked black- that would have been very bad for several reasons. Harry's light pink lips were pursed into a thin, disapproving frown. It was obvious what Harry thought of the entire situation, and it was clear that he didn't care if everyone knew how he felt. He was hardly blinking at all, as if he were afraid that he wouldn't catch on of Lucius's sly movements.
wish you all the best,
" What?" I whispered " They said it was tonight.
" we're trying to help Harry." Jessica said cheerfully. A ravenclaw named Annella pointed to the books in turn.
"What are you doing?" Harry watched Draco suspiciously and Draco had to push his frustration down. he brought his (slightly more than normal) wonderfully chaotic fiance a mug and sat down in the other chair across from him, not wanting the desk to separate them. Harry just stared at the cup in his hands for a moment before sitting down. He didn't drink until Draco had taken a sip. comically Harry's eyes widened and he looked down at the drink in awe. Draco smiled into his own mug, remembering when he had first introduced Harry and his children to the sweet drink.
" Hazel."
" come on then, tell us the story." Mardan said. all the students leaned in. Hermione closed the book she was looking through and sighed.
"I won the bet fair and square James!" Lilly crossed her arms.
The lighting light up the sky as a torrent of rain crashed over us. I looked over to Draco and he had the same determination I did. Wands out we advanced on the old riddle manor. I couldn't suppress the shiver that went through me as we approached. Memories I kept safely behind layers of occlomancy pushed forward but I forced them back.
" Maybe he dropped them?" Neville said.
" Familiars? As in more than one?" Neville asked.
" no, Harry. He can't hurt you anymore. " Harry stopped muttering at looked up at Draco. " The Aur- police took him away where he can never hurt you anymore. or anyone. And even if he got away from them there are hundreds of people in this school that would stand between you and him. All those people in the great hall would stand in his way. and any wizard who saw him would turn him in to protect you. He will never touch you again. Ever. " Draco very carefully held the tiny child while he took in the information. After what seamed like hours harry finally spoke.
wish you all the best,
Draco stopped pacing and and sat down by Harry. "yes father."  he promised.
"Dad, froze up. Mum had a potion that made him wake up but it must've ran out, we can't find any. Please, you've gotta help, uncle Draco!" I grabbed some spare potions i had on hand not sure what I would find.
" A bet? what bet?" George slung his arm around his niece.
Luna and Neville had an easier time occupying Harry,( Draco couldn't even try to call him just Potter anymore) as Luna was apparently good with children, but Harry had refused to leave Draco. Harry was currently sitting in draco's lap as neville was telling him all about different plants while Luna created images of them with magic.
"The kids are safe!?" He asked when we stopped casting. My head was spinning like a top I couldn't sort through anything so I just shoved everything behind my occlomancy shields and straightened, empty.
Draco cut him off with a laugh.
Draco was confused he'd never seen his father like this his father had never talked like this.
"I'll talk to Severus and Narcissa about that, they knew her better than I did. Maybe we can put a book together for him so he can have it for when he reverts again too. "
" He can't get you, He can't hurt other people." Harry let go of the air he had been holding and buried his face in Draco's arms, shaking with relief and crying his eyes out silently, containing the sounds of his sobs. Draco held him and ran a soothing hand down Harry's back. Neville, Luna and later Hermione joined the hug and surrounded the boy with love and promises. Draco was just tucking Harry back into the hospital bed when his mother walked in. she didn't say a word a simple helped Draco put the boy to bed, careful of the wings he had let become visible again. Draco was just smoothing the blankets when narcissa placed a small plushy nifler and a small plushy dragon both plushies cuddled in close to their new owner.
" We need someone to gain custody rights, someone who can protect him. From both Dumbledore and Voldemort. Someone who can get the boy to trust them."
Harry of the potion.
Everyone, except professor Snape and professor wittengale  , (the emergency defense against the dark arts teacher.)  was laughing at everybody else and before Harry could even open his mouth, the twins were standing up and declaring themselves the reason  for the yellow powder as some elaborate prank, taking bows and recommending more and more ridiculous ways to use the powder and remove it. Harry found himself laughing after the attention was pulled away from him, when one of the twins began to faint then was revived by the powder being thrown at his face.
" I won because Draco asked dad!"
“It’s a long story. I’m not sure it would be all that helpful right now.” Draco glanced at the clock on the wall and paled. “ oh, Merlin the children. Harry darling, I didn't realize how late it was but I have to go. Actually, maybe you should come too.” he quickly finished off the mug of chocolate, and practically flew from the room stopping only to grab Harry’s arm and a slytherin scarf.
I ran to Pansy as she was closest to me, while Draco checked on my wife. I trusted Draco with my life even though my heart lay a few feet away I tended to Pansy. She woke and weakly gripped my hand, before the light of life left her eyes. The healing spells I had cast stopped functioning as there was no one left to save. Tears already falling down my face I rushed to Draco and Ginny sorrow eating my chest. Please, please Merlin let Ginny be okay. I fell to my knees beside them and Draco looked up at me desperate.
"As I have expert experience in these sorts of matters," George smiled but held a sadness in his eyes, " The purpose of the bet was when they would get together, than Lillikins is the winner."
" I can really keep it? Like... Always?" Harry asked.
Luna was not surprised when Harry turned invisible as a kinda filtpixie had told her to expect it. She made her way over to the ravenclaw table and sat down.
“ just, stop for a minute. “ Harry leaned forward and put his head in his hands. He just wanted to go to sleep and wake up with this as a dream tomorrow, even though the thought of dreaming he was Dra-
" Naraissa. I need to thank her." He hugged the book. " For the book." He looked down at his shoes like he was expecting me to refuse or something. I smiled at him.
" We believe he was rerouted to the steps because there was a muggle who had portkeyed with him. " Lucius interupted her. " The muggle was attacking him so we quickly aprehanded and arested the muggle. And brought the healers to Harry."
! Fiance was disturbing.
" Draco I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have...."
"Don't change the subject, soooooo" He smirked and I didn't know whether I wanted to snog him or slap him for being such a jerk.
“How did this even happen!?” Draco looked at him concerned. “Potion accident…..”
(See the end of the chapter for
" For what it's worth, don't think your fat or a coward or stupid." Draco said quietly as he picked up the owl Cage and one end of the trunk.
" Harry and Draco are fine!" Teddy shouted back as he walked towards us. He grabbed my arm, but I could barely feel it.
Immediately he froze. Madam pomfrey took a step  towards him, and Harry pulled the covers over himself. She turned to is and ushered us a little further from the bed. She sighed before speaking.
.............meanwhile inside the infirmary
Harry, Hermione, and several fifth year ravenclaws were sitting at one of the larger tables in the back of the library. Hermione had been kicked out by madame Prince, before she had made much progress the night before. sh did have a chance to narrow down some of her choices. Harry's familiar was probably not in the arachnid family or a a fairy or pixie as they didn't get along with fox like creatures. Though not knowing precisely what type of creatures Harry is put a problem on things. There was a big difference in the type of creatures high elves bonded with and royal elves. And Harry's scaled wing could be an indication of a drake, draconi, or komos and the even more rare dravir. While their other features would be more telling there simply went enough books that described the differences in related inheritances and she didn't have all that much to go on. A handful of traits from different creatures that may be altered by other aspects as well.
" Sooner is better than later. " Said Luna. " The temyzeps say if we hurry you can watch the show" Luna wispered to Harry.
" No, no ,no,no th- Ahha bad m-m-ah-n i- is gonna hmmm take me a- waaaay. " Harry started crying in earnest now. " ah- ha-and He'll t a-a-ake m-e ba-ack a- and i'll wake up I-ha- ah don't w-w-w-w-want the d-dream to end. I-I like I-aahhhh he-ere" they were almost to the hospital wing but nothing Hermione said could console him. " don wan go back pleea-" his cries evolved into hysterics. Several of the group from the library had run ahead. " I- be good I-I be good I- be good please, don-on don- Le-ave. D-Draco, Draco! DRACO!" Madame Pomfrey came with a calming drought but he fought both of them when he say her. " No, no, no,no, Ple-eeeeaase! Draco! DRACO!"
