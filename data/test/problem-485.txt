“Okay,” Draco replied, leaning into the touch. He reached into his trouser pocket and pulled out the box. “Molly gave this to me. I don’t feel right having it.”
“It’s alright, Potter,” she said gruffly. “Professor Hagrid is inside with a snack and some cocoa. He’ll watch them. You,” she said more quietly as the students filtered past her, “have a personal matter to attend to that arrived in my office an hour ago and would
. So, he sauntered into the city, hit Soho, and realised how much had changed in a year. Normally, wandering the neighbourhood would normally have been dangerous for his pocketbook. It was hard, however, to spend zero pounds on useless things and expensive coffee.
"Sorry," he mumbled. "Old habits and such. Do you though? Want a drink. I… But no, it's a weeknight. You won't."
“Louisa?” Draco asked nonchalantly, puttering to his coffee cart and turning on the fancy machine. He put the lid on a covered tray, knowing the elves would soon provide them with pastries and scones, possibly even bacon if there had been some left over at breakfast. This tray, coaxed out of a former house-elf, had saved his life last winter, when the burden of planning lessons or watching potions meant he hadn’t eaten anything all day.
“If you don’t take the cloak off right now, Potter,” he threatened, his tone bordering on violent, “I’ll start shooting hexes at these very old and no doubt priceless tapestries. I’m sure
it's awful,” he argued. “You hate me, remember? Besides. How do you even…you don't even know that I…"
Draco nodded, still looking decidedly at the table rather than his co-workers. Kingsley handed out tasks to a few more people then dismissed them. Draco seemed to vanish the second the meeting ended. Harry just caught sight of him ducking out of the room, and immediately screamed internally at himself for noticing.
, but then, I told you about the whole ‘I’m bi’ thing, and you came down to tell me that Hannah and I were a good decision regardless, but the spores had already attuned to me. When you breathed them in that day last month, you...well, regardless, you don’t actually want me.”
he hated it here. It would be more satisfying when he found himself in the middle of these creative blocks if he was also miserable in his surroundings.
Draco’s mouth fell open as his eyes landed on an elegant, older, and thoroughly delighted looking, Pansy Parkinson. His gaze flicked first to Diego, then to Harry, as he tried to calculate his move. Even as he did, Harry had subtly shifted to stand in front of Diego; ever the saviour. At this moment, Draco was endlessly thankful. Behind Pansy, Theodore Nott stood stoically, looking bored as he studied the random posters on the walls.
“I’m just saying...I’m surprised you’ve just...avoided him,” Draco smirked, returning the cloth to the sink.
Draco looked down at his arm and found an intricate, beautifully stylized peacock. It was simple, really just a multitude of intersecting lines and swirls, but it was proud and graceful. It’s head ended in a point, connected to its wing. Its body and tail were created using swirled, swooping lines. He studied it appreciatively, reaching down to trace the dried ink.
“Draco,” Hermione murmured when he had finished, quietly covering her face where he knew she was crying. “I want to say, why didn’t you tell us, but then— you couldn’t have, could you?”
When they eventually had children, they would argue for many months about names, only to realise when they’re daughter arrived that they’d both been entirely wrong.
Slowly, the students figured it out anyway. But in the end, it didn’t matter. The students in these walls were unaware, for the most part, why Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter should definitely
figures something out, I’ve known about it for weeks and have already tried about seven different solutions.”
“It’s alright, Harry,” she said gently. “It’s not been lost on me that something is weighing on your soul these past few weeks. The school will continue to function in your absence, I assure you.”
The first thing Harry noticed was the laughing; he was laughing that lighthearted laugh that made Harry's heart leap appreciatively despite the many months of distance, despite the pain and fear. The laugh was accompanied by the touching. He his hand on the arm of a very tall, relatively handsome bloke, who was smiling and teasing, continuing a story he was obviously midway through.
"No, I know. But I don't know what to say about that question. It doesn't seem helpful to explain that I love you as much as always have. That if you wanted to, I'd marry you tomorrow. But that at the same time, I still get a whole fuzzy shock if I see Carl. It's…how can we just go backwards?"
Draco smiled a small, tentative smile. "I'm going to anyway,” he shrugged. “I'm a worrier. Besides, I didn't mean
It was a testament to how much he loved Diego that he spent any time in this place, especially after he’d discovered how small London really was.
“Show off,” Harry laughed, stepping forward slowly. Draco waited. He always waited. He had learned this lesson in a complicated mix of embarrassment and injury at thirteen, and he always let Harry go first.
Malfoy studied him for a long moment, long enough that Harry—who did not generally enjoy close examination—squirmed. Then he nodded a small, resigned nod. A gentle shift occurred before Harry’s eyes; Malfoy stopped looking like a challenge. He seemed, in that moment, far smaller. Far more human.
"It’s not a problem,” the man replied, standing up and holding up the leash. “We had a lovely chat. He’s very friendly.”
Draco knew at least half of the things people were shouting. He had a fairly decent memory and Pansy had made him study before coming so he didn’t make a complete fool of himself. He probably would have been doing better at the remembering if Harry weren’t glued to him like a strange, extra-sticky magnet. Even when he wasn’t looking straight at him — rare, if the number of side glances he’d managed was any indication — Harry’s body seemed to be connected to him. Draco could have been imagining it, of course, but it was very difficult to ignore either way.
“I have a plan,” the man — presumably Harry— replied angrily. “My plan is to take this key, and the name 'Owen Travers', and demand entry.”
Paper was scattered all over the floor, bookshelves overturned, and his desk — once a large, beautiful oak piece he’d had commissioned because he felt like it — was splintered and screws were strewn everywhere.
“Audrey,” Abe called from the side room. “Have you seen the box of oboe reeds that came in on Wednesday?”
Draco laughed and sat coffee in front of them both, settling into his chair and gesturing for Harry to pass over his bag. “I will if you will.”
have been better: for himself, for Ron, for Draco. But he wasn't. He wasn't better. He was scared and alone, and all the time he spent trying to figure out why, all the time he had spent fighting against evil, it didn't seem to matter. It hadn't made any bloody difference. The bad was still free in the world, free to destroy good.
"What are you doing, Potter? What have I done to warrant observation?" Malfoy snapped as Harry approached the lift. He grabbed Harry by the arm and whirled him around. "It's been six months, and you've managed to ignore me until now. What is this about? Was I just stupid to believe we were going to put childish schemes behind us now that we were both Ministry employees?”
“Draco, no offence, but what is any of this telling me? I knew all of this,” he declared. He sounded annoyed. Draco was gleeful. He wanted Harry angry. He wanted him furious. It was the only way he was going to feel better.
“Did she give you the ‘allies in times of peace’ speech?” Malfoy quipped, arms crossing over his chest and eyebrow sneaking up past his hairline in a stance that was far too familiar to be neutral. “Or was it the one about letting the past stay that way for the sake of the small minds? I’ve had both.”
The baby had scared him originally. When Hermione and Ron had decided it was time, he had just moved to Hogwarts again, and his life was an utter disaster. He had nothing settled and nothing permanent, and here were his best friends making a life-changing decision and asking him to guard over it should anything happen to them. It should have helped that he had been Teddy’s god-father for nearly six years.
“You just,” Potter muttered, averting his gaze, showing his discomfort for the first time. “You know...add a horn.”
Now, the three of them walked unhindered down the cobbled street until the reached the familiar striped awning of the robe shop. Harry paused and took a deep breath, studying the elaborate display. He pulled the black box from his rucksack, opened the lid, and gazed inside with bated breath. He wasn’t waiting for something to happen.
“Fuck, sorry,” Carl called as Draco came bolting from his room. “Sorry, I was trying to be quiet, I promise.”
, Draco? If not, let me know. Because it won’t matter how much everyone else tells you they’ve moved on if you don't.”
“Still stuck?” a voice above him said, setting a mug down on the table. It was late afternoon; Draco knew he shouldn’t really keep drinking coffee, and Diego knew he shouldn’t really keep bringing him coffee. And yet, here they were.
"Potter,” he declared. “Not surprised you don’t recognise me. We weren’t even really acquaintances. In fact, I think we may have been enemies, even if you didn’t know it.”
He was holding two crates at once, trying to get done in time for lunch, when the greenhouse door opened.
“I’ll tell you one thing, though. You keep holding my baby like that, you have a pretty good chance bringing both me
An eerie sort of silence fell around them as they marched up. When they entered the dusty apartment, Potter dropped his ridiculously worn out and too-small duffle bag to the ground right in the entryway and then crossed his arms and looked around, routed to the spot.
They sat down and for the next ten minutes of intro music, said nothing and refused to look at each other.
In a way, Gerard was what he needed, too, except that the level of need had quickly run through its usefulness. And now, Draco was apparently stuck with him for years.
Harry laughed. “Well, obviously. But. I mean. Ginny had James, and then Ron got promoted. We sold the house. The timing was never right.”
“But not Theo?” Draco snapped. It was uncharitable and he felt petty before he was even finished the sentence. Old arguments were hard to displace. Harry’s face turned dark for a fraction of a second and then he shook his head and sighed.
Draco things. He must be shown. Made to think it was own idea. Romanced away from a plan. And—forgive me for being blunt—but you are as gorgeous as the day you were when you walked in here as an unknown hobo. If Draco saw you last night, you’d better believe he is currently paying attention. Since you, Mr Blushy McBlusherson, quite clearly feel the same way, I am perfectly willing to be the one who points out the obvious. You still like him. He still likes you. Go save him from himself.”
Eventually, though, these things turned into a routine. He would work forever during the week, only leaving early when he had dinner plans with Nev and Luna, or when Hermione insisted he come over for movie nights with the kids. On the weekends, Ginny would fill his time; he wasn't sure how she was convincing her relatively new boyfriend that this was okay, but Ginny wasn't generally one to be trifled with once she had decided on something.
The defensiveness gave Harry pause. Of course, Malfoy would think that he was trying to catch him out at something; that had always been the nature of their relationship. He frowned. This really was a colossally bad idea, whatever this was.
Draco, despite the almost constant threats to do just that. He was afraid, most of the time, that Lucius Malfoy would finally lose what was left of his sanity and either do it anyway or have him killed. Pansy liked to insist that this worry was just Draco being melodramatic. Draco wasn’t so sure.
Now, though, the sitting and the waiting were starting to get to him. He was always restless, and the fact that his body wasn't physically exhausted at the end of each day meant that the nightmares were back in full force. Nightly, Voldemort killed Dumbledore, only to turn around and kill everyone Harry had ever known in one, sweeping, deadly green arc. He'd wake up screaming in a cold sweat, alone in the darkness and unable to get back to sleep.
as soon as Molly had finished snapping photos of he and Ron with every combination of Weasley possible. The people and the pomp were all too much, bringing back memories of the months right after the battle.
“What am I supposed to do with him? Shag him before I marry my wife, get it out of my system?” he replied angrily.
"Not that you have to tell me," Harry added hastily. "Hermione doesn't exactly let just anyone into the house, so I'm sure you have a good reason, I was just—"
“Also, you should call me Harry, or at least try. It’s getting weird,” he shrugged and went back to work, heedless to the fact that he had just shattered everything Draco comprehended about their connection.
Draco froze. He knew what Harry meant, but the implication sparked a thing inside of him that he’d long ago gotten under control. Either something on Draco’s face, or else the realisation of the words he’d spoken had Harry blushing and backpedalling.
’ to a unicorn? A unicorn is a fucking unicorn. White. Horn. Rainbow tail, which is utterly ridiculous, let me tell you. But children know what they like, and they like rainbow tails.”
Knocking wasn’t actually that hard. Draco, after all, liked Harry. Against all odds. He wasn’t actually a shrinking violet. It was just…. strange.
Draco sighed and pushed the wrapping off the box. He levelled the smaller box inside onto his palm and glared at Harry.
"Oh I dunno, I was thinking of just tackling you to the floor of the museum and casting the first spell that came to kind," Harry teased, his eyes alight with humour.
“I don’t care either way if I’m honest.” Punctuating her point, Pansy stuck a lifesaver in her mouth and held out Draco’s trench coat. “You’re going to be late.”
Harry closed his eyes for a second and charged bravely into the conversation he’d wanted to have when he’d grabbed Malfoy’s dog that day in the park.
“That’s certainly what they are all going to tell us. I suspect even McGonagall will have something to say about it.”
Setting a timer and picking up his own mug, Ron sat heavily across from Draco and reached behind to a drawer, pulling out a pad of paper and a pen.
“He comes back from his leave Monday, right?” Potter nodded. “And I assume you haven’t told him about what happened?”
“Here’s the thing,” Potter said, whirling around suddenly and standing in front of him. “At first, I was really angry about the Incident, but whatever. They haven’t been back, and it’s not like I’m unable to take care of myself.”
“Right. I’ll make sure I put that in the report. Absolutely relevant. Tea, I assume?” Ron asked, standing to get down Harry’s polka-dot mug as he nodded.
Harry grinned and followed Abe, endured a ten-minute lecture of the benefits of coated strings versus uncoated, and let the bubble of contentment wiggle back into his brain.
As they approached the end of the day, and customers dwindled, Draco gave up on trying to sort out what he was feeling and started to pack up. Diego was up on a ladder, Potter was flitting about with closing procedure, and the day had a satisfying finished feeling to it. Despite his earlier emotional rattling, Draco felt accomplished and happy. He smiled up at his boyfriend when he noticed he was being watched.
Carl had happened two weeks before the wedding. Two weeks. Had he managed to avoid the situation for two weeks, they may have all been fine. He would be married to Harry right now, curled into this bed with him before his best friends’ Christmas celebration, working at the store at ungodly hours but heading home to Scotland to live in Harry’s quarters with him. Hell, maybe he’d even have gone crazy and quit the store job before this holiday season.
They were made of fire, both of them. There were arguments over how and when money should be spent. They had different views on what city and jobs one could live in comfortably, and how long a Floo to work was what you could consider acceptable.
“It’s half-eleven,” she replied, quirking a very Slytherin eyebrow at him. Harry just stared back. “Fine, lead the way.”
“I’m not even going to ask,” Harry said, chuckling again as he manoeuvred the pram out of Draco’s way. “I...tell Pansy I said hi.”
But now, in the hope in Harry’s eyes, the embarrassment in his face, the fluster in his fidgeting fingers, Draco knew he had been right all along. And he was unable to contain his glee.
He strode forward with more conviction than he felt, pushed open the door, and let the tiny tinkling bells above his head chime as loudly as he could without slamming the door behind him.
"Ah, I see. Well, it just so happens that I anticipated this. So, here." She pulled a bunch of pages from her bag and shoved them at him. Information pamphlets on night school courses, day school short-term classes. “You can learn. This was not going to be without obstacles, Harry."
“Guess we did lose an hour,” Draco teased with a smirk. He sobered when Potter’s expression sharpened and honed in on him. It sent him on high alert. “No, sorry, it’s overwhelming. New city. New job. You’re allowed to take a minute to readjust.”
Draco turned back around with another grin, his long blonde bangs flopping forward into his eyes. “I told you, Harry,” he quipped. “I don’t normally sell
He’d told McGonagall at the funeral that he needed a leave. He’d left out how long the leave might be. He’d finally spat the words onto her shoulder as she gave him a rare hug. He’d been unable to send the letter he’d written three days earlier because it was going to make everything real. When she’d stood in front of him, however, in black robes but wearing a bright purple cape that Draco would have loved, he’d found the words he needed to speak. She’d offered to have him come live at the school even if he decided not to teach at all. He’d refused.
He dragged Harry into the break room early one morning and held him hostage. "Harry, mate,” he mumbled into his folded arms. “What's up? You seem… ill. D'you need that number of the doctor at Mungo's I go to? He's excellent. Maybe he can sort some… dunno, vitamins, or something."
So here he stood, wincing and waiting for Potter to out him, or mock him, or worst of all, tell Diego who he really was.
“Yes,” Harry replied firmly. “It was never my plan. It was fun for a bit. Maybe even great. But I don’t want to be like...some forty-year-old ex-rock star playing casinos.”
“I’ve been trying to tell you for weeks. They’re...addicting. Or at least, they have some sort of… lust property. You and I, we were never meant to actually
Draco finishes the book on a Tuesday night, a glass of scotch in his hand. It's the third, or possibly fourth. He doesn't care that he is drunk, even though that is why the quote breaks him in half.
At the slight, dignified nod that Draco gave him, telling him to go on, Harry wanted to scream. Instead, he made himself stay calm. He inhaled deeply. Closed his eyes a moment.
that might have been lemon if you turned the right way, but was probably more like cedar or ash or smoke. Fresh and suffocating at the same time. Frightening and comforting. Like a thunderstorm.
The system did not extend to the rest of the house. Draco’s shoes would end up in every corner of his closet, waking Harry with his curses as he tried to find a matching pair every morning. Their spices were haphazardly thrown on a shelf in the cupboard, and no matter how hard Harry tried to create a clear array, they’d end up muddled, cinnamon beside oregano. Harry loved the messy side of Draco most. No one ever got to see it.
When Ron returned each night, Harry would drag him to the fields to fly. During the day, he slept too much and tried to meet Hermione’s ever-present demand that he write a book by sitting with a blank notebook. He bounced Rose in his lap and fed scraps of turkey to Crookshanks, who was even grumpier than he’d been in August. The dinners at the cacophonous table that week brought Harry more joy than normal, the bickering and the noise welcome shifts in his routine silence. And yet, when he went to bed each night, he found himself dreaming of a parapet. Of blond hair and silvery eyes. Of moments of quiet that meant more than any words he had ever spoken to anyone.
Not even the walk through the twinkle lights to the flat helped distract him, and so when he saw Carl lingering against the door jamb in the corridor, he didn't bother disguising his sigh of frustration.
“You’re forgiven if that’s what you need to hear.” Abe wandered out of the back room and gave Harry a gentle tap on the shoulder. Which, for him, might as well have been a bear hug. “Come over here. I’ve got these new coated steel you’ll like.”
Harry sighed and looked at the ceiling, resting his sweaty hair on the back of the chair. “No, and I’ve been beating myself up about it for the last forty minutes.”
“Mr Potter,” she intoned, looking up at him finally. “I have been at Hogwarts for a very long time. I was your
"Draco," Malfoy said after a beat, offering his own hand hesitatingly. "We should…I mean, we could. If you want. Dinner, another time maybe?"
Lifting Draco into his arms deftly, hands hooked beneath his bottom, pressing bare chest to bare chest, Harry took him to the bed. He drew the curtains around them, closing out the world and creating the fuzzy bubble where everything made sense.
He’d been crying, recently, Harry could see. He was silent now, but his hand fidgeted constantly with the goblet he wasn’t drinking from, and he’d barely eaten anything off his nevertheless full plate. Harry
The phone call woke him at 3:45 the next morning. He was conscious, but not actually awake. The smell of the inn he was in had kept him awake, which was ridiculous in retrospect. But he couldn’t get it out of his mind that it smelt of death and mildew, and even when he’d fallen asleep, his dreams had been controlled by images of disaster.
"I'll give you 30 seconds to retract that last question," he scowled, holding out his hand. "I need your extra antlers, Mandy."
"No, no. I just. Think you're lucky. The colour suits you," Harry admitted. He pushed off the counter and walked as calmly as he could back to the table, where Ron was pretending not to watch. He felt, rather than heard, the shocked sputter from Malfoy, but when he turned to look, the blonde was gone.
Welcome to my completely erratic posting schedule. I'm sorry but I give you terrible, tame smut as recompense?
They spun North, climbing in a gentle spiral, and when Draco looked out, he saw that they were already over the ocean. If ever he were frightened, this would be the moment; instead, he just felt alive and free.
Rather than invoking anger as Draco had been hoping, Carl's face fell even further; suddenly Draco was horrified he was going to cry. He wasn't sure his convictions could take that tonight.
Stalling for his own sake, Draco looked down at the pram and found a small, smiling little girl in it. “Shouldn’t you...uh,” he began.
The train station looked like it belonged in a Victorian movie, but he marched up to the open counter and demanded a ticket to Digone Alley in the most authoritative voice he could muster, considering his ears were still ringing slightly.
The kettle was new. He’d had to throw out the red one the week before; not because it was broken, but because he’d grown tired of it causing him to break.
cafes,” he said, putting his hands flat on the counter as though defending a court case. “They use bottled syrup, and heat the milk too fast, and so, of course, it tastes wrong. It
"I love you too, you great bumble,” Draco replied with a chuckle. “Although, we really must work on you sounding less terrified every time you say it."
“One moment, sir,” she said, prim and professional even as she stood up to whisper to a manager. He exhaled hard. He didn’t need to wait for her to come back to know it had happened again.
, before he nonchalantly withdrew his arm as though it wasn't far too late for that action. He didn't speak directly to Harry. He nodded at him vaguely but didn't look him in the eye as he turned to the tall man.
“What?” Malfoy teased, misreading Harry’s silence as disbelief. “Did you expect me to maintain my proud family name? Didn’t mean to disappoint.”
There was the subsequent evening where he stopped being able to talk to Harry, instead appearing at Theo’s door and getting very
He felt bereft. He wasn't ready, he argued. He wanted to stay here, keep learning, keep working out what to fix. But Collette would hear none of it.
“Look, I know how I sound, okay? Why do you think I haven’t talked to you until now. I’m...embarrassed isn’t even the beginning of what I feel. But more importantly, I am furious. My fucking father, from beyond the fucking
from the side of the circle silenced them, though they continued to glare at each other, hands hovering over wand pockets and daggers in their eyes.
"Don't. Don't you dare do that. We only get so many great loves in our lives. You know that. Draco was—no, is, apparently—
out of me. You and your dumb hair and your fancy clothes and your ability to make women fall at your feet with that ridiculous wink of yours. Those things annoy me. To no end.”
between here and there. So much left unsaid, so much broken, so many places where the cracks were showing.
“Love me a themed cocktail,” Harry replied, sipping from the dainty straw with a smirk. Draco looked away again, and Harry’s stomach swooped just slightly.
With a focus on what was happening finally in front of him, Draco saw the small, whirling green dive-bombing pixies clearly.
He left the house with 4500 pounds in Muggle coin, no wand, and absolutely no idea how to live in their world.
Harry Appararenting into his bedroom, however, was an entirely different thrill. The second Draco’s feet were under him, Harry had him pinned to the door, warm hands lifting his t-shirt over his head without a moment’s hesitation. As much as he hated to admit it, they were well practised at this by now. They knew all the steps.
Draco snorted. “Seriously? You don’t? You’re thirty and starting a new career. I know you’re mental, but even you must know it’s okay to be a little trepidatious about it.”
“It was a terrible lamp,” Draco said for the tenth time that day. He looked at the lights that Harry had magically stuck in an arc around the makeshift sofa. “Fine. It’s nice.”
Abe, predictably, stood up and clapped his hands together. “Knew it!” he declared. “Strings my ass. Well, and?”
Draco hadn’t been anywhere near Ron and Hermione’s London flat since that last day in July, where Carl had picked him up in an obnoxious limousine and swept him off to Kent for the weekend. The neat white fence and garden boxes that concealed their bins made him inhale sharply. He really wasn’t sure he was ready to do this. He trudged forward, wincing as the cab drove away and stranded him from changing his mind, but he rapped loudly at the door before he could lose his bravery.
“No worries,” he replied to Harry’s implied question. “I’m excited. I don’t get to dress up often enough.”
Draco’s hands were very full; he was holding three folders and a bag of trash he’d meant to put in the bin at least five minutes ago. If his hands had not been so full—well, he’s not sure what he would have done, but it certainly would not have been standing passively while Harry Potter reached out and tucked his hair gently behind his ear. It certainly would not have been letting Potter spin on his heel and waltz very far away.
When the front doorbell rang out in the large hall, everyone jumped, but Draco hid his jolt by standing and carefully placing his glass.
“Yes, well, Auror Weasley,” Draco interrupted. “We are more than happy to comply. But I suspect Harry’s protests here are more related to the fact that we are not
True to his word, Draco’s face and senses were enveloped by a kiss that was not the swift peck of a man headed off to work. The type of kiss that made his head go fuzzy and his heart go soft and his senses disappear in the wake of his affection. Harry began to retreat, and Draco found himself flinging a hand out to hold his forearm and stall him.
“Harry, this is a disaster. I don’t think you understand how much I am hating everything right now.”
Draco smiled again, scrubbed his face, and then let himself look at Harry in the dim streetlight. The expression had the desired effect. Harry beamed, let go of Draco, and spun away, disappearing with a crack that left a ring in Draco’s ears that was completely unrelated to the club beats.
Until one day, when Harry thought he might explode, about five adventures into their weird changing, blossoming friendship.
“Sorry,” he muttered. “That was uncalled for. It’s just… Potter. This is what he does to my life. I feel like an idiot child.”
,” Harry admitted to Hermione, tracing a finger along a knot in the wooden table. “More like, what I said.”
Even more ridiculous was the fact that he really wasn't that uncomfortable. Despite the fact that they hadn’t had even the semblance of a conversation about their history or the war, Potter seemed to be content to treat Draco with bland indifference. Which was fine by him, since he felt like otherwise, things would very quickly come to blows, making the explanation of
“Look,” Owen said, making his voice as calm and reasonable as he could muster, drawing on years of experience negotiating for hostages. “What do you need me to do? Go up there, into the bank, right? I think we can all handle that. I won’t even make a fuss. I don’t want to be mixed up in this any more than—”
When he returned to the school to take up his temporary post of Alchemy Professor, Draco was warned by every member of the junior staff to never, ever bring up the story.
The flyer was graceful and precise, skilled with their turns and fast. Clearly they were an experienced player. Harry was puzzled since something about the way the person before him adjusted themselves at every throw was very familiar and disquieting. When the Quaffle went a bit wide, Harry suddenly realised why.
Draco said this last sentence all in a rush, as though he had been avoiding it. Harry laughed; he was rested and happy and so the entire conversation only resonated in Harry's brain as excessively adorable worry from his ever-concerned boyfriend. He kissed Draco's forehead, promised he would tell him if things got worse, and then dragged him bodily, kicking and screaming, into the surf. They finished their week gloriously, Draco shoving too many souvenirs for Hermione and Ron and their kids into his carry-on.
“He said something about using up his leave days just in case they decide to pull his seniority,” Ron chuckled. He straightened up a bit as though an idea had struck him. “Hey, Malfoy. You have any extra leave days.”
He trailed his hands down the boning in Harry’s ribs, tugging the bottom edge of the corset as he went. “Or is it for this?” he asked, stroking his fingers over the pearl beads and therefore brushing Harry’s clavicle. “Or is it for that?” he said gesturing vaguely. “Because I’ll tell you what. I’m here. I don’t have much beyond that. I’m here and I don’t know why, and if you don’t kiss me soon, I might lose my nerve.”
anything from you. Before you, I was an independent human being. I was actually pretty happy, frankly. I didn't need anyone. I didn't need anything.”
“What’s so funny?” Malfoy said from where he was tending the fire. His tone was intentionally cautious, innocent to the point of study, and it sent a comforting quirk of irritation through Harry that was almost welcome. They were back on familiar ground.
“I had top set maths with him. He didn't… Well, I mean, you remember how your lot treated the scholarship kids. When I saw him in the shop that day, I couldn't quite place him. I figured it out later, of course, but…”
“Oh,” Harry muttered.. “No. I mean, yes, I did. But. It didn’t… continue. I didn’t realise I’d never told you. I don’t let you dig into relationship stuff very often. When we were talking about Ginny, it was all… war stuff. But yeah, it did confirm the, uh, thing. That I'm… not straight."
Finally, Harry laughs a small laugh; it's a new sound to Draco, light and carefree. He's instantly addicted. He needs more of that sound.
“I don’t think so, not really,” Draco said, staring Harry dead in the eye. “I’m sorry I didn’t come talk to you sooner… that wasn’t fair. I think maybe we are friends, Harry. Only I didn’t really act that way.”
Abe shrugged. “Don’t think it was really your fault, was it? Besides, it all worked out fine. Draco dealt with it.”
"I kept just waiting, you know?” he said, one hand still on Draco’s arm. “Because I didn't really think it mattered. A lot of people get so caught up in their past and can't live in the present. And I watched you try and heal from whatever was haunting you, so I didn’t want to make it worse. Once you were… you know, better, it didn’t seem to matter as much,” he paused, as though trying to decide how to continue. Draco took a breath to interject.
The next morning dawned bright and frigid, making Draco smile and shiver simultaneously. He tiptoed out of the house the minute he was dressed, deciding to walk through the icy early morning and get some fresh air before he was doomed to an eight-hour shift surrounded by ‘
Kingsley gazed down at him appraisingly but nodded shortly before replying, "Yes, I've been expecting that. I can move you, obviously, but the field?” he asked, sceptical. “Really? I seem to recall a desperate plea to have a desk job just one year ago. I could put you in a different office, perhaps?"
He meandered slowly down the busy street, stopping at many of the Christmastime vendors that always ended up popping up out of nowhere around December 1st. He knew many people despised these tinkers and traders, whose bizarre wears were not usually genuine or particularly useful, but Harry happened to love them. They highlighted the season for him, their carts full to bursting and decorated with tiny lights, occasionally containing real faeries that had been bribed into providing their light for an evening. The general hubbub of Diagon was increased threefold by their presence, and Harry felt lightened by the general atmosphere.
“Yeah. It was a start,” Harry admitted, letting the conversation of the past go. “It would probably be enough to protect you from a dementor for a minute. Now you just practice.”
He leapt back up and ran all the way down the stairs, finding the box still lit with bright blue flames that did not seem to consume the things it surrounded. Harry smiled. The flames were quite beautiful. He approached carefully and whispered the words to himself. When nothing happened, he spoke up.
He’d turned a corner instead of waiting for her; waiting for Ginny to choose a brand of crumpet was an exhausting process. He was looking back at her to say he’d be near the eggs, meaning he ran straight into them.
Regardless, by the end of the day, he had a new assignment. He had also inherited a new partner — a young recruit whose voice reminded him unpleasantly of Winky's, but who was otherwise tolerable — and a rotation of surveillance in Hogsmeade. He hadn't lied to Kingsley, not really. He
she’s going out with Granger tonight, isn’t she? Alright, alright. Calm down. You’re coming back to the office with me this afternoon. I have a bespectacled git to intercept on the way home.”
For all these changes, however, Harry had still not actually completed his task; he still had not slept with Draco Malfoy. The goal had silently changed, sure, but Harry was no less convinced that he wanted Malfoy. He hadn’t failed for want of trying; Harry, he had to credit himself, knew how to pull. Malfoy was an enigma.
Draco froze and spun around. “Look, I don’t know what’s going on with you, but we aren’t friends. Have you forgotten that? We aren’t friends and you don’t owe me anything.”
“Thank god,” she replied. “I was worried about you yesterday. It’s okay, I can get George to come in. Be better soon please. I can’t do this month without you.”
“No,” she interjected harshly. “Stop. I will not let you ignore all the hard work you have done by blaming a place for your downfall. Besides, they aren't suggesting you hold meetings in the basement of the Ministry. We can find a completely neutral place, a place where none of the memories lie. I will remind you, in case I haven't gotten high and mighty enough already, that Mortecue isn't actually neutral, all things considered.”
“Hm,” Draco said, trying to keep his tone disinterested. Flitwick looked at him and smiled. “Well, I just wonder if I should pay him a visit. Mock him a little… or offer some help. I did that my first term, too.”
Harry looked at the papers, and back at Collette, before muttering, "So, you actually think I can do this?"
“Just don’t let Al into the guitar room and you’ll be fine. Draco?” Abe muttered gently. “I really am sorry.”
"Must be annoying," he had said. "Being constantly reminded of that day, people treating you like a hero."
Harry collapsed into his frame a little bit. “I’m not expecting anything, Gin. Don’t worry. I just want this last puzzle of his concluded. Then I can leave the house. Go back to...whatever my life is now. Move...forward.”
They play a friendly game, Mora calling for a quick, mid-air colour change. But Potter gets his transformation done first, donning the green jersey they use when they practice. The colour sets Draco off even more as they shake hands at centre pitch and wait for the release of the quaffle.
He marched to the room and raised a hand to knock, just as Potter whipped his door open looking utterly disoriented and out of sorts.
He hadn’t gone home for many years, trying to avoid the awkward conversations about when he would get married or when he would move back home. This year, he felt very tempted to go back just so he could stand in the wine cellar and remember what parts of him he was letting fall away, remember who he was before he fell apart. Luckily, Dr Stenhouse was able to talk him out of that particular destructive decision, sending him home with new breathing exercises and absolutely no answers as to what was making him feel so discombobulated.
“Can...can you help me move the last of these crates?” he replied without preamble. “My head is killing me and I’d love to go into lunch.”
He took his hodgepodge tea and cuddled into his bed, settling in to watch a movie and stop thinking about anything at all for the rest of the day.
“Well, would you like me to innumerate with my Muggle boyfriend ten feet away?” Draco shot back, his own eyebrow hitting a familiar height as he crossed his arms to glare at Potter.
“I’ll tell Lily you got called into work. It’s fine. They’re here for the next couple of days anyway.”
When he got home, he did better for the summer. He saw his therapist three times a week, stopped the sleeping draughts. He was trying very hard to see all the lights at the ends of all the tunnels, and Draco was back to his former self. For those warm, sunny months, life seemed brighter. Lighter. Almost perfect.
When the pain began in Lucius’ lower back less than an hour later, he never once considered that he should have read the contract with slightly more care.
Draco latched onto the lifeline that Harry had offered him. They’d hit shaky ground and Draco wasn’t enough of a fool not to realise it. The heat in his cheeks was evidence if the look on Harry’s face hadn’t been enough. He gazed around the room looking for Astoria in her matching emerald gown. He found her with the Minister’s wife under the Chilean Wine Palm, hair in a complicated knot at the base of her neck and a plate of
While teasing on these tiny scraps of paper, he spent as little time as possible thinking about the end game he wanted. Flirting had to lead somewhere, and where the fuck did this lead? To sex? To a relationship? There was no way Potter let this go that far.
“Spell?” Owen muttered, sounding very much like he was just starting to figure out how dangerous Harry could be.
On weekends, he went and saw properties. He hired a letting agent, a Muggle one who was endlessly confused by his non-specific purpose.
“Yeah, look, I know, okay? You said it was too complicated, too much paperwork with the Ministry. We don’t have to do it officially if you don’t want to, but like—I’m done, Draco. I don’t want to be with anyone else. So just...marry me? Okay? We can work out the rest.”
not heard me? Merlin, you're really not doing well… Ron said, but then he always exaggerates everything, especially when it comes to you or Hermione, or the kids."
Draco rolled his eyes so hard that it gave him a sharp pain in the back of his temple. "Do you think that's
He sounded so sad that Harry’s shoulders snuck up to his shoulders as he hugged his knees to his chest in the effort to not stand up and comfort him.
Harry had lifted his sleeve to wipe his forehead, lifted his glasses to his head to remove the grime from his eyes. When he put them back, Draco’s face was only an inch or so from his own. Quick as breathing, Draco’s mouth found his and kissed him firmly, a small breath releasing from both of them before he was gone.
Truthfully, he would be just as comfortable working in some trendy-but-still-a-chain cafe, where cheap prints were the only pieces of art, and the music was soothing mainstream indie-pop with songs that were just similar enough to be indistinguishable. The type of place where boys wore beanies in July with glasses they didn’t need, and writing screenplays on computers that mummy and daddy had bought them for Uni. The type of place where the coffee was always burnt, the baked goods were bland, and the staff all looked identically intimidating.
Harry briefly winced, catching sight of Draco again and backing into a wall. “You have the baby,” he replied, remembering that this was
Draco quickly became fascinated with the rhythm of the place; the regulars, whose drinks the boys knew without having to ask. The chores and stocking that just seemed to mysteriously happen. The endless flurry of activity. Potter sometimes sang to himself, bopping to the music he’d clearly chosen to suit his mood. Diego was obsessive about keeping the cups at the same heights. He would listen in fascination as Potter seamlessly discussed everything from politics to stocks to pop culture.
Draco spun back to face him with a mocking look of shock. “Every self-respecting Slytherin knows about the tunnels by second year,” he said ominously. “The question is… how do
"It's all going to change now, you realize," Draco said gravely to the wider room. "Are you all ready? Montgomery is disturbingly predictable for a Head Auror. One year is all you get to be babysat. The real cases will start pouring in now.” He pointed at Ron meaningfully. “No more
“Draco Abraxas,” his father hissed by way of greeting. “Would you care to explain to me why I just received a Certificate of Amendment from that bloody little music shop of yours?”
“They’re all here, free standing. If you want to play some, you can pull them down and put them on the stands in there,” Draco was explaining.
“Neville, I have a favour,” Harry said, jumping off his bed the second Neville unsuspectingly entered the dorm.
The snippets of memory that interrupted his sleep were always the same: a persistent reel of happy moments, clouded by sudden fights, misplaced anger, and true fear. But to explain, to tell anyone what happened, he had to go back. Right back. All the way to the beginning. Before everything. Three years ago seemed like a lifetime when he tried to sum it up.
Draco’s face turned murderous, but he took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and concentrated for a moment until his face was serene again. Harry watched his hand stretch out in front of him, his wand gripped tightly. His hair whipped back from his face, the sun glinting off it’s silver strands. The serenity was startling. Harry had never actually seen him look so calm. He had to look away, eventually. The few seconds he’d been watching had felt intrusive, too private.
“What, do you think I just attack anyone who has ever taught me a spell?” Draco continued, now whispering. “Because I don’t, you know.”
For the rest of the morning, they sat at the desk, marking paper after paper. The only time they spoke was to share ridiculous tidbits from student writing, replying with a small laugh or a groan. The warmth from the fire and the light from the lanterns left a companionable fuzziness that lulled Draco into complete comfort. He stretched his feet out under the desk until they rested on the chair beside Harry, which made him start. Draco, laughing at the small jump, earned a tiny glare that sent electricity down his spine and made him snap back to the paper in front of him. A moment later, when Harry silently poked the arch of his socked foot making Draco jump in return, he looked up to find an adorable smile on his face.
Nothing happened. Nothing, except that Draco, sour-faced and bedraggled, had bumped his arm as he set up a station in front of Harry’s own bubbling caldron.
“That’s just what I was going to ask,” Draco said gruffly as he approached from the other direction. He gestured for them to follow as he walked into the gate of a small parkette. He turned them into a small green space with a hideous fountain that was empty for the winter and sat on the edge. Harry stood over him as Pansy began to pace.
Harry stood up too, brushing himself off and shaking his hair to release some of the grass that had settled there. When he stopped, Draco was surveying him closely.
“Professor,” he began through gritted teeth. “I just… encountered one of my fellow professors. On the
Harry actually looked quite angry, which was confusing and at the same time, comforting. “This is daft, trust me, I know,” he went on. “But I am really angry at you. I was confused, at first, about why I was so sad. Until I took some time to think about it. And I've realised that I’m mad because you didn’t come talk to me yourself. Which is just– that’s fucked up, isn’t it? You’re still
Harry squirmed in his seat again, earning him a glare from Hermione from across the aisle where she sat with the Weasleys, and an elbow from Ron who had stolen the seat of
"Worse," Harry finished with a small sigh. He instinctively moved closer to Draco, wrapping him in his arms, slotting hands into the back of his loose linen trousers. He had been waiting for this conversation, yet he still didn’t have an answer. Not a good one. "I'm fine, Draco. It's just a bit stressful, this job, and I'm still learning. It's going to be okay."
They flew for ages, dipping in and out of mountains and islands, tiny dots of towns and villages stark against the hillsides. Draco’s face was numb in no time, his hands losing grip on Buckbeak as he got more comfortable, as he unconsciously leaned back into Harry.
He was angry and short-tempered, especially with Draco. Their fights began a few weeks after Spain; the more violent they grew, the quieter Harry got, until eventually, he was silent for days. Draco, immediately guilty, would spend inordinate amounts of time trying to make it up to him, which was ridiculous since Harry almost always
“That’s the laziest mocking of my hair I've ever heard,” Malfoy shot back gloomily, not lifting his head.
Draco rolled his eyes at the ceiling but schooled his emotions as he calmly replied, “Well, I have confirmed new ownership of the shop, and as head of the board, you receive notification
“Shh,” Harry mumbled, reaching further around Draco’s back and nuzzling his face into his chest. “Sleeping.”
Madam Malkin eyed him carefully, as though looking for subterfuge in their words. “Well,” she concluded. “That’s going to be quite a problem. You’ll never get into the vault without Travers. Still. My part was just to give you the key. Don’t suppose I have any reason not to follow through. Best of luck, Mr Potter. You send him to me for a good smacking upside the head, will you?”
“I know, I know. That’s why we’re here, Harry. That’s your first answer. I was…I was such a mess in first year, Potter. I barely remembered that day until I saw you in the park. Until Barkley…”
Draco’s face lit up and it punched Harry in the stomach. “Oh my goodness, that’s right. You haven’t met her. Come with me.”
It was then that the bank account problem had begun; he’d taken most of his identity papers with him when he’d left the Manor. Money, in those early days, in the hands of the right Goblin, had secured him Muggle documents. Opening the account was easy.
them to. Because this whole thing was getting ridiculous. He’d already done all the hard parts, for Merlin’s sake; he’d closed accounts and informed distant relatives, cleaned out the wardrobe, sent the clothes to the Oxfam shop. This shouldn’t be the part that was tripping him up.
“Sorry, Professor Potter?” Malfoy asked, a hint of annoyance just touching the edge of his gentle hum.
"I like your robes," Harry muttered eventually, taking a careful, calculated sip, but not breaking eye contact with the man who was now staring him down.
“Three Sickles he says ‘honour’ again before the end of this speech,” Ron whispered loudly, making the people around them giggle.
Pansy held up a hand. “Potter, don’t you dare interrupt me again. This story is going to take hours if you don’t just wait.”

is not always a good thing in a green officer. Here,” he said, stretching out a piece of paper to him. “This is your counsellor.”
Unfortunately, the wonderful sensation of his dog-hating people in general disappeared entirely when the dog broke free. Draco was always a little terrified of the day he just wouldn’t come back.
Still, he sat through the board meeting and the shareholder’s session at the bank, survived a stuffy lunch at his great aunt’s club, and made it all the way through the library tour where the new wing would be dedicated the following month. He saved up all his quips and jabs, kept his mouth shut and didn’t ruffle feathers.
Coffee obtained, he began to languidly walk to the Northern entrance of the road. He’d just Apparate into the park, rather than go through the polava of tapping the bricks and then walking all the way around the block. He was trying, as Pansy had demanded, to remember he was a wizard.
"You're looking at it all wrong," Draco insisted. "This is where your life starts. No more lies. No more hold over you. Carl, they can't keep you chained up anymore."
Harry rubbed his eyes, pushing his glasses onto the top of his head and exhaling. Draco—new Draco, adult Draco—had always been very paranoid about keeping money out of their lives. Even as their relationship had grown more intense, more solid, he’d never let anything go out of balance; he insisted on paying his own way, always split everything. He was frugal to a point of it annoying Harry, who’d always just assumed he was reading into things because of his own upbringing.
After the first step had been taken, their friendship stabilized before they ever worked out how to be lovers; it was months before Draco would admit that he loved Harry, even though it had likely been true since he’d written that letter. The real nature of the changes between them remained unknown to all but McGonagall, whom they told on their six month anniversary. She had merely smirked, nodded, and warned them not to tell the students, a knowing gaze behind her glasses that made them both squirm.
Harry interrupted Draco now, holding up a hand and muttering. The first sound he’d made in many minutes.
Ginny snorted meanly. "Well, that is truly the stupidest thing I have ever heard you say. I have known you how long? Don't you think that if this depression, this anxiety, were actually 'you', we'd have told you by now?”
off to get just an ounce of respect and trust around here. A month in and he’s taken that away. Doesn’t even matter what the review says. Everyone always believes him first.”
“Forgot how much I hate you,” Draco whispered fondly, his cheeks getting a little brighter as he watched Harry smoosh his face into the face of his very picky dog.
oversight,” Harry growled. “Of the sort that has paused Ministry transfer requests and halted budgets, warrants a full investigation, Minister Crowly.” The small man nodded vigorously. “I also expect
Five minutes passed before a zipper screech dipped into the heady silence all around him, and a blanket was proffered peacefully. Draco took it, a sickening orange plaid thing that could
Malfoy laughed. "All the first-years say that,” he explained. “I've seen five groups of you go through, remember? And you're all the same. ‘it's boring, we want action, why did they train us if we were just going to sit’. And I don’t get it. You all seem to think they were going to let you handle serial killers on your first day. Seriously?”
“He’s having a hard time with unicorns,” Diego teased, making Draco wince. Diego, of course, had no idea that bringing up unicorns in the present company wasn’t a great plan.
Draco considered for a second, thought about how much he could give away, how much he needed to say before he broke everything anyway. But before he could answer, Diego had sat up.
Harry laughed again and reached across the table to pry Draco’s hand away from his wine glass. In an unusual display of public affection, he held the hand he released on top of the table. He didn’t say anything else to Draco’s sudden gushing, and since he was grateful, Draco didn’t push the topic further.
through the too-thin walls and pretending every day that he was looking for work. They were being patient with him, but the fact remained that their newly formed, adult lives were being cramped by his presence in a way that had never happened at school. No one needed to say it to make it true.
The bank account closures he normally missed completely had been immediately noticed; they may not be doing anything fancy, but weddings were expensive. He’d wanted to surprise Harry with a Wizarding Photographer, a thing he’d insisted they didn’t need but that he secretly wanted to have. He’d gone to the machine to take out the deposit in pounds, to take to Diagon and convert. His card had spat itself right back out at him. Naively assuming foolishness or ignorance because he wasn’t at his own branch, he’d stormed angrily inside.
“I get cold easily,” Harry said by way of explanation. “Louisa says it will likely never go away. Symptom of PTSD.”
“I can’t believe you’re angry about it,” Harry teased. “I’m the one who screwed up my final mark. She’s being really kind letting me redo it.”
Harry laughed, a reserved and cautious sound. “You always say that,” he said, looking at his mittens, where a drop of his own tea had fallen. “And then he
Draco ground his teeth together. That one tiny pronoun was why this place sucked so much, despite not sucking at all.
Theo, wisely, winced. His full name was her last straw, the moment before she flew off the handle. He sighed and put down the last plate, gesturing to the kitchen table. She sat calmly and he began to pace.
“Well, that’s a deja vu if I’ve ever seen one,” Hermione announced. Rose was toddling in behind her on unsteady legs, already gurgling.  “He’s been back for all of one evening, and you two already have him with his head in his hands. It’s okay, Malfoy. I’m here to defend you now.”
The happiness wasn’t uncomplicated. It also, however, wasn’t delicate or fragile. It developed roots that sunk into the Earth, one tendril for every wrong ever committed toward the other; it found its leaves reaching toward the sun, a future that was growing more beautiful each day, providing light and simplicity to all that rested near it.
"I'll only send you home with a small amount this time, so we can see if it works on those nightmares," the doctor continued, heedless to Harry’s silence. “Rest. Rest is all you need, young man. Pure exhaustion, that's what's wrong with you; and who could blame you? Working hard as you have for so many years.”
It was nice, being up here with them, but it was not helping his complete lack of inspiration. Getting very close to despair as his deadline loomed, he'd started sketching random objects just to stop the feeling that he was being mocked by the heavy paper.
In retrospect, that bitter elixir that never did anyone any good, Draco had realised that something was wrong. He
. Anyone he’d ever talked to had been in danger, this whole time. And now, he’d dragged Harry back into the mess of Pureblood politics
you people are. You have to admit, you need me for something. If I raise the alarm, whatever you are trying to steal is as good as gone. Fucking names, at least.”
When he found the room, he was unsurprised to find a nameplate outside; Potter would be fine with everyone knowing where his private quarters were. Draco knocked as loudly as he could before he lost his nerve and was therefore underprepared for the dishevelled Potter who opened the door; he was wearing striped pyjamas that looked about fifteen years old, a fluffy housecoat that had definitely been a gift, his hair was dishevelled beyond recognition, with a quill stuck behind his ear, and he looked exhausted.
Draco pulled down the paper on the large box he'd been handed and found his own very fancy muggle coffee machine.
Draco is distracted, so Harry finds the snitch quickly and easily. Thursday practices are short. Mora calls it moments later. He suspects she's a bit hungover.
Draco got progressively more sullen and cantankerous; the reality that it was because Harry was home all the time was not lost on him. Harry wanted to be angry in return, wanted to be so angry that he smashed things. The fact that he was there was Draco's fault, for
of dark wood, except that it had been exorbitantly expensive, custom built, and had come out of a conversation about its design and construction which had bored Harry so much that he’d accidentally created small whirlpools at the feet of the designer, earning him a stern glare from Draco and banishment from the room.
“It happened because you still haven’t had a conversation with Harry Potter about what actually happened during the battle. Or about any of it,” she answered patiently.
turn down Knockturn, Harry almost dropped the phone as Ron continued to sputter. “Got to go,” he hissed.
Draco was absolutely sick to the back teeth of being agreed with all the time; it made it very difficult to have a debate, impossible to make a tough decision when no one would weigh the pros and cons with you. Draco enjoyed the challenge, and fire. He had grown up in the Slytherin dorms, where wit and guile were the tools of the trade, where you learned to survive in the heat of verbal battle. He had needed kid gloves while he healed, but now he wasn’t so sure he could handle much more softness.
"There… there's nothing really wrong. Well, I mean. There’s always something wrong, Lou,” he announced, unsure where the words had come from. Knowing the direction his well-meaning therapist would take with that, he backpedalled. “No, wait. I'm fine. I'm excellent, actually. Except. Well, I'm having weird dreams again."
The man stepped forward, his stick raised in front of him. He was already muttering a word when the room went black.
He came out for the first time to one of these innocuous strangers who he knew three things about. Genevieve. Blonde. Micro-herbology. She’d been yammering on the day they had scheduled for their club crawl adventure, two weeks into their first term. She was, if he recalled correctly, complaining about her boyfriend, describing all the ways she was going to ‘get back at him’ for his nonsense. Draco, whose morals were quite solid no matter what anyone told you, was embarrassed by her attempts to get him to flirt back. So instead, he'd blurted 'I'm gay' into the room.
Behind the counter, the girl blushed so hard that Harry was concerned for her safety. He tried desperately to rescue her.
Harry had laughed, and Ron seemed relieved. He realised with a start that six months ago, he likely would have snapped at Ron for a comment like that, and then gone into a sullen retreat for days.
There was a moment, a split second of time, standing in the motes, when Harry felt the dam break, when the distance between their friendship closed. There was a moment when Harry knew things were irreparable, and yet perfect. When three years of being coworkers, sharing meals and laughing, drunken nights of confession and apology, when the fact that there was just sheer mutual attraction took over and broke through the mess they’d both created.
The pitch was exactly the same, as though it hadn’t been destroyed and rebuilt at least three times. He wandered down to the Gryffindor entrance and snuck through the waving tapestries. On the third level, he moved out to the bleachers and was startled to find someone out in the field, flying and throwing a charmed Quaffle that returned to them like a boomerang. Harry watched hesitantly for a moment, feeling ludicrously like he was intruding.
Finally, it was—unexpectedly—Penelope who broke the tension. “Well, I’m glad one of us has realised that there are more important things in this world than a family name and an appropriate match. Draco, if you are looking for a flatmate, I think I’m going to be needing one in London.  When I move there. Next month. To finish my art course.”
"Harry," she said firmly the third time he brought it up. "You need to go back out. You need to be tested. We've finally got your meds sorted, and it's been four months. You need to go and see if you can do it even when the world knocks you down. I am still going to be there, but it's time. You are ready. Next month, we'll start working on your centre. You've already given notice with the Ministry. The new house is all set up. Mr Potter, it's just… time.”
There were many more moments of drama. There was the afternoon where Draco sat in the office of the Head Examiner of the Auror Department for the British Ministry for Magic, and was berated and implicated for several hours.
When he closed the door, it felt like it was the end. For the first time in weeks, something felt completed and almost okay.
Draco bit back the retort he wanted to use again; he didn’t actually know why that kept happening. He cleared his throat.
But Harry had already hung up. He was jogging out into the street to get back to an Apparition point. He needed to get himself to High Wycombe.
“And now?” Draco pushed, leaping off the desk and offering Harry the empty box that had been by his elbow the whole time. “What am I now?” he murmured, crouching down beside Harry to help him lift the pile of books into the box.
Still, Draco felt he deserved the argument that magic made things just a little bit messier and more painful.
Travers sighed dramatically. “Unfortunately, he does. It’s exhausting. Who would have thought that going abroad for school would lead to me
"Right. Okay. So not yet,” Ginny conceded with a small smile. “Well, fine, but I'm not going to sit around and watch you become some sort of strung out potion addict because you’re sad about a boy. You'd never allow it of
"Yes, but that is the difference between you and I. I exude hope. I live on last chances and desperate causes. You should try it."
His students seemed to like him; they would often turn up at Harry’s office hours gushing about him or walked into his classes full of new potions information they were dying to share. He was helpful to the other professors, with no request treated as unreasonable. Yet he was moody, prone to disappearing. Still, it was clear he was making some sort of effort. Malfoy was tersely polite at meals and staff meetings. He stopped going out of his way to avoid Harry on the grounds. He once even said hello and asked how Harry was when they passed each other on the stairs of the owlery. Harry tried to be pleasant back and felt the ice and mistrust start to thaw just enough for him to notice how hard Malfoy was trying to avoid angering anyone at all. It seemed sort of exhausting; a small spark inside of him wanted Harry to push some sort of reaction out of Malfoy again, as he had at the forest that first day. This newer version, the one who made himself smaller in the presence of others, was disconcerting and sad.
He made his way to the refreshment table and, with a glass of champagne in hand, he followed the shadows behind the pennants trying to escape the noise. He quickly discovered a corridor he’d never been down and snuck away from prying eyes, hoping to catch his breath. Unfortunately, a sudden voice and echoing footsteps forced him to duck into a crevice as silently as he could only a moment later.
“Get a grip, Potter,” he told the mirror. “You like this thing. You don’t care one way or another if he shows up. You look good. Get going.”
“Never leave me,” she replied, fishing out a tenner and shooing him away. “Get André something too. He was so early.”
He understood why she was hesitant to believe him. He had taken on far too many new careers in the past five years, and even though other twenty-somethings were often forgiven for these moments of flighty change, he knew he was different. He was
He had never lived in a wizarding community; it was a little bit shocking. It was strange to see people Apparate out on the street, or watch children play with magical toys. The way he had to use wizarding money more often than Muggle money. It was all a nice change of pace, freeing somehow. It helped that at its core, Mortecue was a sleepy little hamlet. The people there quickly stopped caring that he was Harry Potter, especially when he was as boring as he was, buying pints of milk and ordering chips at the deli counter. Reading one book a week, and occasionally entertaining very small groups of red-headed strangers. They mostly ignored him after the first month, even if the rumours about his time in treatment took a bit longer to fade.
“He’s not supposed to be because of the whole honeymoon thing but he’s in the back. I’m not supposed to tell anyone that.”
Draco looked at his feet, embarrassed. “I think I’m doing a pretty good job of not using anything against anyone... these days.”
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was very far north, nestled in the foothills of Scotland, utterly unreachable to Muggles. It was difficult to get into without being invited, and truthfully, it didn’t get many unexpected visitors regardless. The castle was hidden from prying eyes, secure for its students, full of magical lessons, community, adventure, and happiness.
When he woke up in the middle of the night, there was an imprint of a peacock on his face. He scrubbed it in the bathroom mirror, his stomach lurching uncomfortably. He’d woken with Diego’s arm slung possessively across his hips, and it had dragged the entire list into the foreground so that he couldn’t ignore the problem. It was easy in the light of day, with Diego smiling at him, making him feel important and protected.
So what if he didn’t manage more than a few hours of sleep both those nights? Work was stressful, he had a lot on his mind. And yes, fine, he was avoiding the park. But that didn’t mean anything, necessarily. The park was busy and noisy and Draco just found it easier to walk Barkley down by the high street or through the gardens.
Harry looked at the garter clip one more time, adjusted his necklace, and convinced himself that he looked good. Good enough that he’d get away without full makeup. He was working his way up to that, but for now, the fishnets were enough to deal with.
Draco didn’t hear from Pansy for three days. Other people may have worried about this, agonised, even. Not Draco. Draco Malfoy was not one to agonise over a boy, nor was he worried about his friend. If she wasn’t calling him, it was just because she was busy. Or finding his number. Or…something.
She dropped her arms and looped her arm through his as they walked to the door. When she spoke again, her voice had dropped to a near whisper.
,” she growled, ignoring Theo’s comment. “He wrote to me and I decided that I should tell him the real story, since I,
“He called me Potter. He looked... not quite right, now that I know it wasn’t you. He looked like old you. Sixth year you.”
And at the same time, with his wand raised defensively, Harry's heart stopped beating at the muttering of one, particularly recognisable word.
Upon arrival, he made a hasty decision and grabbed a room at the Leaky instead of continuing on to Ron and Hermione’s. Something felt fragile and desperate about the fact that he was in London at all. He wasn’t keen to bring them into it quite yet; they’d be comforting and understanding. It was possible they’d even be encouraging, but he couldn’t risk the alternative coming true. Not when he was just starting to let the fact that he still loved Draco wiggle it’s way back into his consciousness.
She smiled at him so warmly that he felt like hugging her. She moved her hands from behind her back and handed him an apron, antlers, and a freshly minted name tag.
,” Draco drawled. “That manager found a way to get stuck on the Isle of Wight over the weekend. In the middle of the winter. And you just so
But George just waved him off and picked up a large box wrapped in purple-and-orange. “Nonsense. You always help everyone else. You’d have ended up in here anyway, and you’re busy. It’s not a big deal. I don’t know if you’ve heard, but I spend too much time here.”
“I know you don’t trust me,” Draco said after a beat, looking at the ground and playing the very convincing role of ‘contrite human’. “I apologise, though it isn’t worth much, I know. That kid that I was? He was an arse. A bastard. A fucking
More importantly, though, Draco knew that Potter had never been cut out for Auror life. He could have told anyone that; if he’d been given the chance, he might have been able to convince
“No,” she said firmly. “You’re supposed to shag him before you marry your wife, then fall in love with him, realise that marrying Astoria is a terrible decision, and finally throw off this ridiculous sense of
Fifteen excruciating minutes later, they were finally released to the Atrium in crisp purple robes still creased from cellophane bags. Molly was ready with a camera and rib-crushing hugs, and Harry was already tired. He excused himself to go find a glass of something,
laugh, and Poppy flashed him a wink and a smile that immediately endeared her to him. She offered both her arms.
Simple. Direct. Threatening in a mysterious way that may or may not act as a deterrent. In other words, very Draco. He tore open the document and found a single sheet of paper inside.
Draco could hardly believe that when he woke up Monday morning, he was tucked into Harry's embrace. And he had to go to work.
“Malfoy!?” he shouted out into the echoing grounds. Malfoy, clearly having seen Harry first only a moment before, was already headed towards the ground. Harry turned immediately and rushed down the stairs and out onto the pitch, where Malfoy was quickly walking towards the dressing rooms.
“I’m no good for you. I mean, I’m happy, or whatever, that you… that you know what you want now, but it shouldn’t be…I shouldn’t be. Fuck. Just,
The cat had been in Draco’s care for only two weeks, but already, she seemed three times larger than she had. She was sweet and attentive, and Draco, in small increments, was seeming lighter. It had taken way too much effort on Harry’s part to get the kitten to Draco in a way that was neither suspicious nor conspicuous, and he now owed at least three first years favours that he would one day have to trade in on. The thirteenth plan had been the one to work, placing the kitten in a cardboard box, leaving it in the owlery in the space reserved for Draco’s preferred school owl, with a note that said ‘Can you give me a new home?’.
me. I had to listen to many hours of your crush on this Potter bloke, and now he’s back and hot and wants you, and I will not stand idly by when you are still available.”
“But of course, Ms Granger,” the creature said, bowing lowly. “Does Mr Travers have his key? Not that he’d need it, of course. Not technically, given that you're asking. It's just...tends to make things easier.”
"We don't know if that's what he wants. He hasn't said anything. He could just be trying to get it all off his chest."
“Your house is gorgeous,” Harry stated reverently. Draco’s face warmed with happy pride. He loved his house. It was his pet project.
to go look for a job. He just didn’t want to. Every day was the same story; get up, hand out resumes, eat a chicken sandwich in a cafe, hand out more resumes, go home to make dinner. He had to find something soon, or he’d go insane.
They were six months out of Auror training. Babies. Brand new and way too fresh in the field. To save them from themselves, they had not been given anything more taxing than Secrecy Act infractions since leaving day, and the job was quickly proving almost boring; sitting in an on-call room, shooting the shit and drinking way too much coffee with their fellow first-year officers. At twenty-three, it probably should have been fun, but instead, it was driving Harry mental.
“Your smoking has saved the Ministry,” Draco teased, ducking again as another Pixie attempted to pull his hair. Harry laughed and reached out to grab the one beside him. Draco rolled his eyes and pulled out his wand.
Hogwarts school, when they both arrived for the second time, turned out to be the perfect place for Harry Potter to fall in love with Draco Malfoy; here, they easily hid from the world and redeemed themselves to each other. In the safety of the ancient walls, they let their magnetism and easy intimacy blossom into an unshakable relationship; here, they approached each other with an innocence and forgiveness they had never once granted each other in their childhood. They discovered all that they had in common, all the places their differences made them stronger together.
“Harry and I want you to come to dinner with us. At the Hog’s Head. Tonight,” Draco insisted, his tone shifting so subtly that Neville would later be convinced he’d been imagining it.
Suddenly, a kiss was placed gently on his nose. “Technically it was a door,” Harry whispered. “I am a thirty-one-year-old divorced dad of three. Do you really think I want casual?”
“Tell me,” Draco pushed. “We have time, and if you don’t tell me shit it’s going to be a very long month.”
?" Ginny held her head in her hands, their mugs both empty, their chairs pushed out for comfort. They had been at this cafe for hours.
“Cinnamon latte,” Potter shrugged, crouching down again, continuing with whatever he was doing with the large, glass-front display case.
“Oh, I can do you one better,” Harry said, paused at the door. “Think about it, Draco. Is Neville currently married?”
“It’s also very simple, though, isn’t it?” he muttered, taking another step. “Since that’s what you want too.”
Since everyone was here now, the attendants were relaxed and in a corner, chatting. One looked up at him as though he was going to stand, but Draco sternly waved him off. The young man, though confused, obviously recognised money or possibly posh snootiness when he saw it and sat back down. He led Harry further into the cramped room until they were in the back corner of the room between coat racks and a door for a staff loo.
"Darling, stop this. It's just a tad… pathetic? You obviously like him. I have a feeling it started to be obvious to you around Halloween? I know it's messy and stuff but honestly. What the hell is the point of living through what we did if we aren't going to get a little messy?"
They sat beside each other in the picture of perfect happiness. Both wore banal smiles, suffused with warmth and comfort. Harry had his hand loosely wrapped around Draco’s, resting haphazardly on the table between them as his mouth moved, telling some sort of story that was making Draco chuckle. He wore a dark blue henley, the top button undone, and his curls ran wild around his face.
snowing, in that this was still London and it was technically still warm enough for rain. But, the sky was blue, the air was clear for the first time in weeks, and as the sun rose, there was a distinct sense of promise that surrounded him. Draco felt hope as a nearly painful clenching in the back of his teeth. Unfamiliar contentment settled around him as he reemerged from the cafe round the corner with a flat white and a pasty; for the first time in a long time, it didn't feel fragile or fleeting. Hope, perhaps, was returning to the marrow of his soul.
“I told you, I’m not going,” he said, turning to look at her, grinning to find her decked out in her black party dress, turquoise jewelry that stood out gorgeously on her skin.
Harry smiled, a strange and alien expression from where Draco was resting; he shut his eyes against the pain the expression caused.
“Neville,” Harry laughed. “Mate. I grew up in a dorm with you. I know exactly how much pain this is causing you. I’m just also finding it hilarious.”
I promise this gets happier, and pretty soon. But please, PLEASE take care of yourselves my loves. This time of year can be tough. The fic will be here when it isn't Christmas too, and also never necessary for you to read if it's hurting you. Please mind the tags.
Near the end of their trip, they had been walking one cool, breezy evening down the beach. Mid-laugh, Draco had stopped dead and turned to face Harry.
The goblin looked very affronted, said something under his breath that Harry supposed was not words of praise, but then leapt from his stool and shuffled away. Clearly, he hadn’t been that committed to his role of gatekeeper of the Gringotts front foyer today. Harry glanced around as he moved toward the cold stone benches and out of the way. He remembered only then how very close to Christmas it was. He really needed to get shopping. The floating giant Christmas baubles, red and green candles in the braziers, and the approximately seventeen-foot lit-and-decorated Christmas tree in the middle of the room had not been at the forefront of his mind when he’d entered, and now they flashed in his face like a silent taunt. Christmas at the burrow was definitely coming, regardless of how much he willed it not to.
"Yes, well, I already told you. It's going to be stronger for you. Without magic, you can't feel where it was intruding. It's going to take some time to sift through what was real for you. Which is why," Draco reiterated. "You. Can't. Be. Here. You're making this really hard. For both of us."
Potter, unwilling to give up that easily, stepped two steps closer and wrenched the sleeve of his robes up, revealing a deep, angry slash that was shiny with stasis bandage.
He did look up, but he wasn’t angry as Harry had hoped, or proud, as he had always been before. His eyes were wide, dark circles crowding out the lids and worry lines etched into his forehead. “I meant it, Potter,” he said gently. “I’m sorry. It was an accident.”
The castle loomed at the top of the hill in the same way that it always did. Harry beamed as joy shot through him, making his fingertips tingle and his stomach turn pleasantly. He was home. With his trunk floating behind him, he headed towards the front door and a jovially waving Professor Flitwick.
Mid-way through sweeping the floor of the kitchen, the charm he’d placed on the lights to alert him that Rose was making noise started flickering and he sighed. He put the broom down and held out his wand to stop the spell. Sure enough, when he pulled his headphones off he heard the baby, not crying, but babbling happily in her crib. When he went to pick her up, she beamed, stood up to reach out to him, and his heart clenched a little painfully.
“I meant what I said, in my text. I’m fine. I lasted longer in the Ministry than anyone thought I was going to. Now I have time to pursue other...things. Do I know what those things are? No. But...I’ll figure it out. I’m resourceful.”
“Draco,” he muttered, going as close as he dared to Draco’s ear. “See how many people are gawking at you right now? I promise you, it’s not because you look ‘ridiculous’. You’re fucking perfect. I could put you on stage if I was willing to share. Trust me. You look amazing.”
It's what he had always wanted; but now, as he spent long hours bored out of his mind, he couldn't really remember why. He hadn't been interested in other things in school, but he had been seventeen, and there had been no war yet. Had he underestimated how much of a toll that year had taken? Perhaps he should not have followed Ron into training simply because it had always been their plan. Maybe he should have taken some time to re-evaluate. Perhaps he wasn’t actually meant to be here at all.
The empty space was one thing, but it felt like such a small part of the opening. He knew he needed to advertise. So he put posters about the opening day in every place he could think of, up to and including a poster in each of the common rooms at Hogwarts. McGonagall seemed pleased enough to help him. Eventually, after several shots of whisky, he even called
“Mhmm,” Diego grinned. “Have I ever mentioned that it is a very good thing that you are never expected to go to the book release events for the stuff you draw? Actually, it is a very good thing that you are
The door at the end of the hall was propped open and the loud crashing and cursing were much more evident as a result.
“Immobulus!” he cried, stalling the pixie beside him in mid-air. Harry grabbed it in the net that now contained a dozen or so groggy imps and suddenly, the room was silent again.
Owen stumbled when they got inside. Something about this place was making his head swim with familiarity. But that couldn’t be right. He’d never been in a place building that was so resplendent, so full of grandeur. Of that, he was sure. Not to mention that he’d
of a Muggle flat, with a Muggle job and Muggle friends. Admittedly, it wasn’t a Muggle boyfriend, but his promise to his father held firm.
It didn’t matter that they had only written stupid, scrappy letters for a month and not figured out a damn thing in all that time.
"You’re right, Malfoy. I should stop with the schemes,” he reassured. “If you must know, I've been trying to come up with any excuse to talk to you."
“Non-optional if you want to keep your frontline position,” he declared unapologetically, wiggling the paper until Harry took it. “And Potter?”
She glared at him and readjusted the baby. He knew that was the way to get her; Hermione, without information, was like a rabid dog. Unable to let it lie. She nodded once and stepped back, leaving a small gap for him to step into the entryway.
By the middle of the next week, Draco started leaving his mobile at home; not for any particular reason, and certainly not because Joseph had finally told him he was going to need to keep it in a desk drawer because he was falling behind in the filing. This meant that when he went home for lunch and found the blasted thing flashing, Draco’s heart didn’t have time to drop to the floor and his stomach didn’t flop unpleasantly. Not at all.
What mattered was that night. Across a crowded room. Across a world and a decade and a history and a whole entire universe.
“Well, okay. I’ve been debating how far back I need to go for this all to be explained. I think it’s far. You remember the trials I assume?"
Ron sighed and stood up. “Okay, enough, Malfoy,” he complained. “Here’s what you’re going to do. He likes the museum. The big Muggle one, in the city.. It’s a bit ridiculous, actually. He looks like a little kid. Just ask him out. It’s Friday. You can handle this.”
to. Potter was hardly incapable of sorting out his own problems; his name alone would grant him entry to any field he desired. Yet, there was a small voice in the back of his mind telling Draco that Potter had no idea
“So, not my fault at all, then?” Pansy laughed. “Wait, are you ever so subtly asking if I told him about Astoria? Because yes. Yes, I did.”
That got Malfoy; his hands left his pockets to rifle his hair. He let out an embarrassed and exasperated sigh, shaking his head vigorously and stepping off the wall.
As the rest of the staff turned gratefully back to the lecture, Malfoy grabbed him by the arm and spun him away from the crowd. “Are we going to do this all year?”
Harry threw his hands up in the air and shouted incoherently. “I am not here to save people from sham marriages!”
She shrugged at him, winked, and threw down a dusty case of frilly red panties, embellished with the words
Instead, they went on like this for a month. Their replies kept getting more complex. The invitations were more obvious. And even though Draco had wanted to say ‘come over. Now’ for the better part of that time, he held himself carefully at arm’s length. He was not the one who got to call the shots here. He was sure about that.
since they owned their home, both made salary, and both had more money in the inheritance than a childless couple was going to need.
On Christmas day that year, they told Molly. Well, told would be an oversimplification. At Ron’s insistence, they instead simply turned up at the Burrow with Draco in tow. He’d tried his best to look presentable. Trimmed hair, oiled wingtip shoes, a suit jacket and a deep-green knitted vest that she’d made him with a tiny
Draco smiled a small, private smile. “I know. Sorry. It’s just. I don’t know. You’re surprising, Potter.”
“Do you want a drink?” Draco blurted. “I’ve just remembered that I was on a mission to the bar for Astoria and should probably continue in that direction before she finds me here distracted.”
Harry surprised himself by laughing; something about this man, obviously completely out of his element and thrown off by his day, soothed his nerves. He took in the small silver earring that was peeking out from the man’s cartilage, embraced the white t-shirt beneath a tight blazer, and enjoyed the bright teal of the man’s trousers.
“Three years longer than either of us ever expected, Draco,” Theo said seriously, gesturing with his knife and grinning. He turned back to the stove and dumped the onion he'd been chopping into a pot. He put down the supplies and marched over to where Draco was already peeling a potato. He reached out and grabbed Draco by the shoulder, spinning him around to face him, potato in hand. “Say it.”
He let Draco persuade him to go out to dinner and a movie, his favourite 'Muggle' date and something they had not done for months. Harry even laughed right along with Draco at the stupid comedy they ended up seeing and a small amount of the humour seeped just past the fog.
pretty smart,” Harry replied nonchalantly. Draco ignored him and put the next mug beneath the coffee maker’s nozzle.
“Harry, relax. I was in your shoes last year. This job can be hard. Don’t hide when it is. Ask for help.”
She gestured over her cup of tea, begging him to go on, explain the rest. The things she actually wanted to hear. She was, just as most people would be, waiting for the ship to sink. Waiting for the sound of the explosion.
Inexplicably, the name made his smile turn sour, sad. For the first time in his life, Harry waited patiently. It felt like there was something going unsaid, something he should wait for.
“Pansy,” he whimpered, ignoring her. “What have I done? I don’t want to ‘run the household’, and I just gave up the only job I was at all qualified for.”
He would never stop cursing Pansy for dragging him along to that shelter fundraiser. She’d just been trying to scope out eligible bachelors, and instead, he’d been the one to walk out with an anxious, traumatized Shiba Inu with a giant nick in one ear and separation anxiety.
Harry laughed again and jumped down. “What? Do you think Neville Longbottom is the sort to sleep with someone when they believe they’ve been coerced? Yeah, you really don’t know him.”
He waltzed into the central wing, where the Houseelf that had taken his umbrella had directed him. Which made sense, since that’s where all the largest paintings were. It was the part of the Manor that had been least used by the Voldemort Vanguard, and therefore, had been the least touched by his father’s attempts to pay off their reparation debts through selling heirlooms and relics. He found his father already settled into a high backed chair, some sort of amber liquid in a glass before him — cognac, it seemed, if Lucius had actually bothered with the correct glassware for once.
“And help me run the duelling club,” Harry added. Malfoy nodded slowly, seeming as convinced as Harry was that this idea would end well. “I’m sorry for the Ministry, too, by the way. There’s no excuse for…what I did.”
As he settled at the table with Harry, Draco pushed the small paper out toward the middle of the table. "What's this, Hare? Are you going to go see someone?" he asked casually.
“Potter and Prose,” Draco smirked. Harry flinched slightly, and Draco felt a tiny thrill of success. He didn’t mean to be like this, callous and a little bit cold, but it came so naturally and brought him so much joy.
make simple mistakes. The rest of the day went similarly, with everything slowly spiralling out of control. By the time the 4-6 evening rush began, Draco had been relegated to the backroom to sort through boxes of mittens because no one really trusted him to do his job anymore. He’d gotten a curry and eaten it in the middle of the small shop, not wanting to spend enough time in the kitchen at home to eat takeaway. After, he threw himself to the cinema and watched a terrible holiday remake that he barely remembered, before going home and beelining to his bedroom before Carl could hear him.
Harry laughed. “I think I’m doing that to myself. It’s hard, isn’t it? When an old crush pops up out of nowhere. I’ll pay more attention though, I promise. I’m sorry, for what it’s—”
He gently closed the door and stood with his arms at his side until she gestured for him to continue.
By the time he actually made it to the bright purple-and-orange corner of number 93, Harry had acquired not only his toastie and his mulled wine, but also had three new pocket broomstick care kits for Ginny, a strange little antique swiss army knife decorated with real fish scales for Arthur, and a feathered hat that was mostly a joke for Ron. He was also significantly happier.
“You can be mad at me in the morning,” Harry whispered, attaching himself to Draco’s neck. “But for now, admit how happy you are that I’m going to be in your bed all night long. I won’t disappear because you made me.”
“Hm, guess that’s true. Stealing spotlights and everything.” Abe studied him while leaning on the counter. Audrey packed up the strings and handed him the stamped paper bag they’d been using at the shop since he’d worked there. “Draco isn’t supposed to be in today, but I could call him.”
It was easy enough to say, especially when your entire school knew that you were the miraculous survivor of a wartime tragic love tale that had been splashed around the papers. It sold better than being the gangly, unwanted baby of a couple that was too young and then died. Discovering that he had not been unloved had changed the trajectory of his life. The letter to Hogwarts Academy all those years ago had been the rather a shock; a full scholarship, set up in the name of his parents, and a full ride to attend a preeminent private school where they had both gone. His name was on wings in the library, his father had a plaque in the upper halls, and his mother’s face smiled out at him from the common room in his dormitory. The parents who had loved him so much were heroes, both within the school and within the families who had been going there for generations.
He curses and cleans and eats too much cheese on Wednesday. It's a strange response, he agrees. But the book is clutched in his hand all morning Thursday as he gets ready to go back to the field. He doesn't have a plan. Shoves it in his bag as he takes up his broomstick, and quite honestly forgets all about it as they fly. The only thing stopping him from ramming Potter off his broom when he appears, twenty minutes late and pinch-faced, is that he is on thin ice with the league as it is.
Travers may have been relatively calm to most people, but to Draco, who knew Pureblood masques better than most, he might as well have been wringing his hands and pacing.
Draco resisted his quip, about how if he hadn't missed it, Draco wouldn't have played. He murmured what he hoped sounded like a grateful mumble. He stood. Slowly, he put his bag on his shoulder, turned and put the book on the bench beside Harry's toweled form. He let his eyes linger on his chest, let himself imagine a thousand more locker room fantasies that would never be enough.
He just didn’t know how to mesh that information with who he was, what his responsibilities to the New World Order were. He didn’t know how to match himself to that; how did he explain to other people that he was fixated on a former master of the death at Hogwarts. How did he explain this to
His mother found a way to give him his inheritance and it had barely changed his life; he bought The Kitchen and endowed them for fifty years, then went back to living mostly on his Muggle income.
“What?” Draco sputtered, confused as to how he had lost this conversation so completely, and in such a short amount of time. He'd been ready to tear a strip off of Potter for messing with his coffee, but instead, he was just frazzled and confused.
There was a hitch in Draco’s chest when he shrugged as nonchalantly as he could. “You’ve nothing to apologise for,” he insisted. “It’s not like we had a date.”
“When he showed up yesterday with that story, I was expecting it to be impossible to do it a second time. But it wasn’t,” she insisted. “I believe him. He’s worked so hard to be someone he wasn’t raised to be, and you’re my family. If you need
“He’s going to meet us at the park. Something about the fresh air,” she waved, slipping her feet into boots that had appeared from out of nowhere. Harry nodded and followed her out the door again.
Draco lifted his head a little to look at her. “Oh no, you aren’t. You’ll definitely be on their side. They’re trying to make me report this all to the Aurors.”
The dampness sent him back to that summer. Out the window of his tower office, the snow was gently filling in the space between the castle and the lake, erasing the footprints of many students trampling down the ground on the way to the pitch. In the moonlight, he could almost feel the silence, and as though with his permission, the wallowing fully took hold. The pit of his stomach, the pain in his chest. All of it felt fresh, as though it hadn’t been almost a year, almost six months, almost three days since Draco had stood in front of him last. The memory was hard to let in. He almost never let it happen.
He started sketching, and immediately, the scene began to take shape. Sticking a horn on a mooncalf was, in fact, adorable.
“Bloody hypocrite,” Draco said, looking down at Barkley who was yipping at his feet and spinning in a circle to go out. “Tells me not to get obsessed, but you fucking
Harry leaned in, testing a boundary that Draco had already decided no longer needed to exist. Draco finished moving for him until their lips met once more. Harry’s face flushed very beautifully when he was embarrassed and happy, and Draco knew, even now, he’d never grow tired of causing it.
With that, he turned and walked away without another word. Draco would later insist that he’d had no choice but to follow him; the first rule of journalism, he would argue, is always following your source.
“Usually,” Harry said with a shrug. He laughed at the look of irritation that crossed his face. “Okay, well, first thing’s first. You’re not using a strong enough memory. Were you remembering a time when you were happy?”
Draco swallowed. Harry had a large, fake pearl necklace peeking out of the collar of his coat. His collarbone was bare and jutting out. There was little doubt in his mind who Harry had come dressed as. He’d only watched this bizarre movie for the first time an hour ago, he knew a sweet transvestite when he saw one.
Suddenly, Draco found his Last Straw. He was a student in last straws; the moments where a Malfoy finally gave up and gave in were rare and eclectic. He liked to search through the history of his family to find them. In fact, survival in his early teens had been completely predicated on the fact that there were far more damnable Last Straws in the generations that came before his than being openly gay.
contain his apron or his name tag or his antlers. She looked at him for a moment, cocked her head, and laughed a quick, adorable laugh.
As always, he was struck with the beauty of this place. It’s rugged hills, normally harsh and brown, were blanketed with a layer of icy snow; it was too cold to snow most days, and the scrub brush still peeked through, but it was enough to turn the sky a purple hue that reflected beautifully on the crystalline lake, too deep to freeze but also not interrupted by the wind. They were high enough up to see the ocean in the distance, a black and unfriendly colour that somehow still managed to calm him.
He could work on ignoring the fact that he thought Draco was possibly the most beautiful human he had ever seen. In the deepest, most private place he understood about himself, he’d thought this since school. Draco had been untouchable then, even more than now. The elite of the heritage kids, cold and aloof until the day he mysteriously disappeared. Harry was embarrassed to admit that the aristocratic features, the feather-light hair, the delicate line and curve of every part of Draco really did it for him. Blondes were, after all, his type.
When the piece came out, he winced at the photo. He supposed he was looking healthier—if a bit paler than normal; he had, after all, been running endlessly to try and keep the anxiety at bay. As promised, eating and sleeping had made him look less corpse-like. But there was something etched on his face that he hadn't realised had crept in. He didn't dislike the lines on his face or the darkness under his eyes. They were now from hard work rather than self-inflicted torture, but they shocked him nonetheless. There was a deep, dark part of him that knew why. He hadn’t ever really thought about what he would look like getting older.
Draco felt the words like a slap, and was walking toward Potter before he even noticed his feet moving. “Excuse me?” he hissed.
Draco took her hand from his shoulder and stood up straighter, refusing to meet her eye. It was possible that she had figured it out, since she was his best friend. But it was equally possible that she had no idea what she was on about and was trying to trick him into admitting something.
"Well," began Harry, weighing the possible consequences of his next sentence. "Draco…you do look very good in those ministry robes."
“Or that you were going to be expected to approach all lessons without prejudice or personal judgement?” The tone of warning she was now using was unmistakable.
went to shit. London had very little to do with it. You would have eventually collapsed no matter where you were because you had dealt with exactly none of your issues.”
Still. Today, Harry agreed. Since Draco knew that today was more important than he could ever explain to Harry, he took it as a win and ordered a semi-expensive merlot before Harry could arrive and admonish him. Half-way through their meal, though, Draco was face-to-face with a suspicious Harry Potter. Which had never gone well for him in the past.
“Fine,” Harry replied a moment later, frustration and exhaustion fighting for a place in his voice as he dragged himself out of the covers.
When he looked back down, Draco was beaming. “Pretty good, eh?” he stated, his tone quiet and proud, unlike Harry had ever heard it.
To be fair, that was Malfoy’s fault; he was sitting behind the big counter of the lab in a red satin button up, the top two buttons loose and his blonde hair wild from being hunched over a cauldron all morning. He looked so very much like Riff in this moment that the idea was organic and feeing.
