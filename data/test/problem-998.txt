“Listen to your uncle,” Sirius said. “Right, everyone ready? Let’s go.” He took Niall as Remus took Harry. The twins held onto their uncles tightly and the family apparated. Chilling winds greeted them as they stood at a port where a large and beautiful wooden ship was waiting for them. The ship had large sails with the coat of arms of their school, a double-headed eagle with the school’s name in both Latin and Cyrillic script. Families were already gathered around the ship, hugging their children goodbye, and all surprisingly talking English but there were some families speaking in tongues that Harry and Niall didn’t know.
“Why?” she demanded.
“Sorry I yelled at you,” Harry sighed. The two gave each other an awkward hug and Harry rested against Niall’s chest. “I suppose we should stop doing this, huh? Especially with Neville in your picture.”
Krum smirked, “Of course, no one here smells as beautiful or flowery as you.” Niall glared at the older boy, but he ignored it. “Do you play Quidditch?” he asked instead and the three quickly delved into a long talk about Quidditch plays and teams. Harry and Niall taught Viktor about the English teams as he taught them about the Northern Europe league. Three others joined them in Volkovio, two girls and a very tall and lanky boy. Harry smiled and waved at the three of them, only to receive cold glares. Harry’s heart sank, for some reason, he felt that Viktor would be the only friend they would make at Durmstrang.
“Blaise, son of Satan, Lord of Darkness and Inferno,” Mr. Riddle said, using his titles, “the similarities between you and your father are plentiful, and I believe that you will lead not only this coven, but all covens into a new era of worship and respect for your Father. With your power, I believe His influence will spread further than ever before and together, you, and your father,” and he looked at Satan, “if I can be most humble to say this, my Lord, will bring down the False God and rule supreme over all…” The most devout cheered and clapped at this while Harry grew extremely cold, shivering at the thought of Satan ruling over the world.
“She’s also Sirius’ cousin,” Harry said, the memory suddenly popping in. “But I don’t think he’ll care about her death.”
Draco nodded.
“Potter!” Malfoy growled out. Harry could feel the young Alpha’s anger and irritation towards him coming in powerful waves. He stood his ground, however, ignoring his Omega’s need to cower and show submission. “What are you doing here?”
“But how?”
“Yeah, I hated them,” he admitted. “However, over the break... something happened.”
“Disgusting—how dare that lowly amateur Beta do that!” Draco raved, “you are the best member on that team, and everybody knows it—it is a wonder that you are not the captain!”
“Looks like we are,” Harry nodded. “But… I don’t think it’ll be a while; we still don’t have everything planned.”
Hermione looked at the two of them. “I mean, it’s rare but… I’ve read stories about an Alpha finding their Omega by smell,” she said in a hopeful tone.
“Good evening, Mr. Potters,” Umbridge said.
“Thirty grams each,” Draco said. The man nodded and started to measure out the ingredients as Draco went to the venoms, Yaxley following him. “And how exactly does belladonna, helleborne, hemlock, blood lilies and snake venom supposed to bring Potter pleasure, exactly?” he asked.
“Oh, okay,” Ron shrugged although both he and Hermione gave Draco a strange, hard look. Draco returned them but said nothing. Instead, he just shrugged and pulled Harry gently. “Come on boywife, let’s go see if we can’t find a private place to relax,” he winked.
Draco and Theo watched Harry leave before turning to each other. “Well, that was interesting,” Theo said, leaning in his chair. “Do you think Potter would do it?”
Hermione gave a disapproving look but continued, “Your situation is different from normal—well normal for a werewolf. Your first full moon is coming up, don’t you want to make sure to know that you are absolutely safe?”
“Oh… so I know something that Malfoy doesn’t know?” Ron asked, a satisfactory grin forming. “Good.”
“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia whispered. “The—the pepper floated to his hand.”
“You need to come closer,” Blaise said, glancing around cautiously the clearing at the heavy mist of essence. “You never know who might be listening in and my words are for you alone.” Blaise beckoned them to step closer. Harry and Draco looked at each other hesitantly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Huh?”
With this in mind, Harry found himself standing in Professor McGonagall’s office on Saturday morning, waiting for his father to appear through the fireplace. The clock struck ten exactly and the fireplace flared with green fire, and Harry’s father stepped through standing just as tall and handsome as Harry remembered. “Good morning, Professor McGonagall, hello Harrison.”
. He looked around Gryffindor Table and he could feel everyone’s glares and heated glances. His stomach boiled with an angry shame and he felt like a barrier was being built around him that separated the Omega from everyone else. Next to him, Hermione scoffed, looking on the verge of ripping the paper up, “What a load of rubbish!” she said, throwing it down. “Harry, are you okay?”
“It’ll be fine, I don’t care,” Harry shrugged. “Besides, I want to get Draco a matching set of pink robes,” he grinned.
“It’s so nice to see my boys playing with each other,” a voice said.
“Of course!” Uncle Remus said.
“That’s good at least,” Uncle Remus nodded. “So… today is the big day, huh? The wedding is scheduled to start at sundown, I’ve watched the news and the weatherman says that that would be at four-thirty this afternoon. The morning is yours to relax and prepare boys, Sa—gods know we need it.” The three nodded.
“Why is that?” Harry asked.
“What! No!” Ron said quickly, his cheeks going red. “I mean no—he’s my friend.”
In the darkness, Harry took out his wand and walked until he stepped out of the shadows and into the reading room where Lord Voldemort was waiting. The Dark Lord smirked at Harry, and stood up from the armchair he was sitting in. “Hello, my son,” he said, “welcome to our home, Riddle Manor.”
Back in the manor, Lord Voldemort watched from a window as his son and the Malfoy heir strolled around. “Of course,” he muttered. “I find my son only for him to find another.” He shook his head and turned to face the men in the room. “Either way, we have business to attend to.” Voldemort had his glamour on, looking as the monstrous dark lord that the world knew him as. His inner circle was in the room, watching their Lord carefully as the Dark Lord walked from the window. He looked around carefully, his eyes meeting each of the men as the combed through their thoughts. He stopped at Severus Snape, feeling his Occlumency barrier. He raised an eyebrow at that but said nothing. “Gentlemen, I have wonderful news today,” he announced. “Something I thought long since gone has been found once more. This week is a week of celebration, for I have found my son.”
“Shut up!” Harry roared. Beside him, Ron looked at the two awkwardly, but his expression hardened whenever he gazed at Krum. “You have no idea what I went through! My heat stopped coming because of you! People believed that I was a whore because of you!”
Harry’s tears were drying. His face was red and his eyes puffy. He nodded and Draco helped him down, “Sorry,” he muttered. “I shouldn’t have cried.”
“I know that, I’m just telling you,” Hermione said.
“Boywife?” Harry chuckled, “stealing nicknames?”
Harry found himself not in the basement, but in a small room. The curtains were drawn over the windows, and the only light available was coming from a large fireplace, whose light shone on dilapidated furniture. Dusty tables and sofas whose ornate designs were eaten away by time and poor care. There was one chair situated directly in front of the fireplace, and Harry could see the outlines of a person sitting in it. “Why are you here, Potter?” Voldemort asked, “I did not summon you.”
Draco bit his lower lip. “Was the feeling mutual?” he asked awkwardly, taking Harry’s hand in his.
Dumbledore was interrupted.
“Then I suggest you keep doing that,” Dumbledore said. “Practice on being separated. See if the headaches dull or worsen. Which reminds me, Harry, both Professor McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey have been informed on your situation. We have agreed to use our dear old Whomping Willow to bring you to the Shrieking Shack during the full moons.”
“Is it not in an Alpha’s nature to comfort an Omega in need?” Voldemort asked. “I am not here to be creepy or cross any boundaries, however, I just could not help but follow this saddening scent.” He looked around for a moment before looking at Lupin. “If you are uncomfortable about talking here, perhaps we can move someplace more inclusively secretive?”
“Who?”
“Then you should do it,” Mr. Krum said.
He wanted to feel sick, he wanted to feel revolted and throw his wand down, screaming that he will never hurt a man. But instead, Harry found himself raising his wand, aiming it at the man and from his lips spilled out, “
“Umm… can I ask what for?” Harry asked.
Harry did not answer back. He just held Sirius, and Sirius held him. It surprised the boy that he did not break down in tears, but he knew that he had to be stronger than that. Instead the two just stood in the stairway, holding each other, their warmth spreading to the other. Harry started to feel calm, safe and secure. His body relaxed, he never noticed how rigid he was when he visited Voldemort. He did not know how long they stood there, but eventually Harry looked up, his voice dry as he said, “I know.”
“Ron is my friend—”
“Sex,” Draco said, Harry nodded. “Well… we can try again when we have a real wedding that we plan, in our twenties of course.”
“They did indeed,” Blaise said with pride. He looked at Harry and Draco, “You two have finally reached your magic, congratulations, my mages.”
“My Lord!” the woman gasped. “Could it be…” She rushed from her corner to the cell door, getting on her knees. Voldemort stretched his hand through the bars, and she kissed it with revere. Voldemort smirked at the display of deep respect.
Mr. Riddle concerned Harry’s answer as he leaned back. “I see,” he said. “Nevertheless, you will not be learning Demon Summoning for quite some time. First, you must go through the basics like all other students. Demonology will be included in the basics, as well as theory of levitation and conjuring. Projection and the like can be advance courses that you can choose, however you will take Herbology with Mrs. Treadwell for your full duration. Potions with Mr. Snape will also always be on your schedule, even if you do not have the talent for it, however I hope that you do. For it will make your education much smoother. Mr. Snape dislikes idiot students.
A beautiful boy.
The old man stuttered. He stared at the two, as if waiting for one to smile in a joking way. Yet they kept serious. He continued to stare. Harry stared back before asking, “Will you help us with this or not, sir?”
“I’m sorry?” Harry said, confused, “I thought you were hurt—”
The ice and creature broke apart. No blood spilled; all they could hear were the breaking of ice as the completely frozen creature broke off into hundred of pieces. Blaise, Draco, and Mr. Riddle stared at the boy, impressed and scared. They all stared at the frozen remains. Blaise took a step forward and hesitated, looking at Harry before swiping his hand slowly, the remains burning up and disappearing in black soot.
“But how can you be sure?” Ron asked.
Harry thought. He knelt fully in front of Lord Voldemort; his head slightly downcast.
“Yes, of course,” Uncle Remus said. He snapped his fingers and a tray full of different assortments of liquor, a bowl of ice, and tumblers floated in from the kitchen, stopping in front of Mr. Malfoy. “We serve ourselves in this household, unless you are a guest of honor,” Uncle Remus said, “Mr. and Mrs. Riddle, what would you like?”
“Okay, then I will see you later, Harry,” Fleur said, and she turned to leave, tossing her hair over her shoulder as she did so.
“Manipulating Harrison? Don’t you dare begin to talk about manipulation, Albus Dumbledore! You have had a hand in Harrison’s development ever since you kidnapped him!” Mr. Riddle yelled. “From when he arrived to the Potters to when he was given to the Dursleys instead of his godparents and now here, you are trying to use my son as a shield so you can play the victim!”
Draco smiled and with a wave of his wand, Harry was freshly cleaned, and dressed a moment later. They held hands and Harry made sure that his collar was on full display as they walked. “I have an idea,” he grinned. “Let’s go check on the others! I want to see how their dates are going.”
Remus chuckled and shook his head, “Come on Niall, like I said, Harry needs to sleep. Harry, as soon as you’re done, try and take a nap in your nest. We’ll talk about what’s happening and what Niall talked about with us tomorrow.”
“What? He knows about Gin and I?” Daphne asked. “I wasn’t expecting it either myself, but man you have to feel the way she kisses!”
Voldemort frowned. He turned around and showed Snape his displeasure. “Surely that cannot be all,” he said. “You are not lying to me, are you Severus?”
“I am happy you call me Sir,” Voldemort said, slowly unbuttoning his vest. “I love an Omega who knows his place.” Remus mewled and moaned as Voldemort saddled his waist, grinding against his body as he took off his vest and shirt revealing his massive muscled body. “Worship your Alpha, puppy, and I might give you what you want,” Voldemort breathed, already grabbing for his pants. Remus whined and moaned. He pushed against Remus and moaned. Suddenly a hand shot at him, and Remus’s face was fully red. “You should—there’s something I need to tell you,” he stuttered.
The others followed, and Draco led them towards the carriages pulled by thestrals. Harry was amazed that they were able to pile in, him and Theo sitting on Draco and Blaise’s lap respectfully. “When are you going to collar Potter?” Goyle asked Draco, glancing at Harry as though he was just a pet or puppy.
“The fuck is that?” Ron asked.
The Slytherin just shook his head and took a step back, “If you want to know, those lyrics was more of a collaborations,” he drawled, “Pansy, Greengrass, and a couple others made it.”
he snarled.
But what can he do? Dumbledore gave a long sigh and sat down in his chair. He cannot continue the lessons, obviously, Harry Potter, he refuses to call him by his father’s name, would be much too suspicious and cautious to even be in the same room with Dumbledore alone. No, if he cannot influence Harry directly, he can still keep an eye on Harry. Watch the boy from a distance, as well as keep an eye on his mail. He figured that it was Potter who brought the Alpha Protein to his father. He would not allow the boy to give more evidence to his father. He will not let Voldemort win.
“What I want done to my boy will be done by me, and only with his consent,” Blaise said.
“Transfiguration is absolutely the most boring and non-necessary class of them all,” Draco said, “as well as this game we are playing—where is that damn elf with our food anyway?” he grumbled.
“Monday.”
“I’m sorry… I just seem incredibly busy,” Harry blushed. “With Quidditch and, well, other stuff…”
Harry breathed in an old scent as he and Draco walked into the Academy’s library. A large, overwhelming room, the walls were not walls at all, but shelving upon shelving with windows in-between. The shelves were all full of books upon books, tomes of every subject imaginable. Harry’s eyes were drawn upward where, painted in extreme detail, a documentary portrait of their Dark Lord’s fall in infamy and rise to Power. In the beginning, their lord was depicted as a beautiful man yet, for some reason Harry could not fathom, their lord’s body changed, gaining the goat-like features his coven and others recognize with him. For some reason that made Harry frown as he stared at the half-goat half-man depiction of his Dark Lord. He didn’t stare long, however, as Draco pulled his hand softly and they walked further into the library and towards the maze of shelves and reading tables that made up the room.
No ma'am I did not forget that I was supposed to update yesterday that was another idiot boy.
“Lucius, sit,” Mr. Riddle said, indicating to a free couch. The Malfoys all moved in, but Draco moved to sit next to Harry instead of with his parents. Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy stared at Draco, as though he had done something very indecent or scandalous, but Mr. Riddle ignored them, instead looking at Uncle Sirius, who was glaring in an annoyed matter at the Malfoys.
“He is indeed.” Blaise smiled.
Kneeling, Harry looked up and kept eye contact as he spoke about what happened in the graveyard, about his rush of feelings, of hatred, fear, and a bloodthirsty need to see Wormtail dead. “He must have saw something in me,” Harry concluded, “something that even I couldn’t sense. I’ve studied the Dark Arts before. I know how to give myself a womb, how make it so that I can give milk… and I have enough anger in me that my Killing Curse kills. However, Draco, that is all I know but for some reason that was enough for our Lord. He’ll be in your manor during the summer… that is why I know that we’ll see each other again. And… I think it would be easier to meet as friends rather than enemies.” He kept his eye contact for awhile after he was finish talking before hanging his head down and closing his eyes. Harry’s heart was beating at a ridiculous speed. His face was entirely blushed, and his fingers trembled with nervousness.
“Yeah,” Ron nodded.
“Pet, one thing I should mention about my preparation,” Blaise chuckled. He pulled his finger out for one moment and the next Harry felt as though his pussy was being forcefully pulled apart as Blaise shoved four fingers in. “I’m far from gentle.” He pushed his fingers in until his hand was practically resting against the cheeks of his ass, Blaise’s thumb caressing the outside. He twisted and stretched his fingers, slowly drilling out Harry’s hole. The pleasure was unbelievable for Harry. Screaming and moaning, the vibrations set Draco off as with a pulse, Draco cursed, “Fuck!” and came inside Harry’s mouth.
“You’ve been dating for a while now, right? The whole summer,” Blaise said. “He should have collared you by now!”
“My training?” Harry asked.
“Well the last time we tried you bailed on me,” Draco said.
“Oh? And how do you know this, Potter?” Yaxley asked.
Chapter 4
“Wait, really?” Seamus asked, “Dean and I went as a couple no problem.”
Harry met with his brother in front of Umbridge’s office. They shared a silent reserved look and went inside for what they hoped would be the final time. The blank parchment lay ready for them on the lace-covered table, the pointed black quills beside them.
Harry just smiled innocently at that. The bell for lunch rang and the two brothers walked together before being forced to separate when they reached the Great Hall. Niall’s words kept swimming through Harry’s head, and he couldn’t help but feel a little heartbroken when all he could think about was Viktor Krum.
“Y-Yes my Lord—thank you my lord,” Rabastan stuttered. He crawled up to Harry’s throne and kissed his feet before crawling back.
“Blaise!” Harry shrieked. He began to run for him, only to feel a slimy tentacle shoot out and wrap around his legs. Harry yelped as he fell, and he was dragged across the floor towards the demon before being hanged upside down.
“So are you at times,” Harry muttered. “I’m not happy too, you know, I want to talk with her but she keeps avoiding me.” He thought for a moment, “Is it because I’m gay?” he asked in a soft voice.
The point penetrated the crook of his right arm and blood seeped down the sleeve of his torn robes. Wormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry’s cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it.
“What was that?” Ron sneered, stopping to turn at the woman.
Time did not exist to Harry as he steeled himself. He just stood there, leaning against the wall with Ron as he cried, Ron rubbing Harry’s back and shoulders in an attempt to comfort him.
“So what brings Draco’s lovely cub over here?” Blaise smiled.
It took longer than usual for Draco to withdraw money. The security in the bank tighten immensely, the goblins doubted him at every turn. It took him a full hour longer than usual to get his money, and he left the bank incredibly soured.
“How did you get here anyway?” Draco asked. “You drove?”
New Lives
Harry had no time to respond, no time to say goodbye to Draco or process what happened. For the next thing he knew, he was falling in darkness. He did not know how long he was falling. Harry just felt numb, the cold despair of his actions overtaking him. His sleeve fell, thankfully, hiding his mark but he did not notice. He did not notice his surroundings at all, until he was on top of the kitchen table at Grimmauld Place, falling with a crash that shook the table violent, breaking its legs.
“Of course, you can Draco,” Blaise smiled. “I’m not like my father who thinks he’s so mighty that he can’t be questioned at all.”
“Draco! There you are, how are you feeling?” she grinned, hugging Draco.
“Yes… milord,” Harry said.
“You know you could have helped instead of staring at me,” he said.
“Harry… who is this?” Blaise asked.
Greyback did not look angry, instead he just gave a satisfactory chuckle as he got back on his feet. “Worked better than I hoped for,” he said, “now I just need to make more for myself. I’ll be honest Malfoy, I thought you were dead.”
“They got together during the summer,” Theo said, “right in front of my eyes. It was a thing of beauty really,” he smirked. “of course, I think that Harry would look better kneeling in front of me, but that’s neither here or there.”
“But that makes no sense Harry,” Hermione said, “Dumbledore would never do that.”
“Yes,” Harry said. “I just want to know if Snape is in it.”
“What am I going to do? What does she expect me to do? Am I supposed to hold her or something—what if I drop her! Or worse what if she tries to kiss me and I pull out her tongue and—”
“Terrible,” Voldemort sighed. He shook his head, “This must be a horrible ordeal for an Omega to go through alone.” He turned and looked at Lupin.
were more damn accepting of our situation than Gryffindors!?”
“Dumbledore spiked Harry’s food,” Ron said heatedly. “Alpha Protein is in Harry’s food.”
“Black, who is this short and red-faced man?” Mr. Krum demanded.
“Oh, and where are you going now?” Ron asked.
“I am not lying!” Harry yelled out. “There are other gods—the trickster god is buried in our very own forest!”
“Y-Yeah,” Neville muttered, blushing, and Niall smirked as he stood to get his stuff. He couldn’t wait for Hogsmeade, there he will show Neville how beautiful and perfect the Omega was. But he still had a couple of weeks until then, a perfect amount of time for Niall to plan on how he will steal Neville’s heart.
“Is that a jab against my sexuality, old man?” Draco asked, “At least I am married, and one day will have heirs, unlike yourself. You should hear how my mother speaks of you, poor Yaxley always a suitor…” Draco smirked when he saw a flash of anger appear on the old man’s face. He turned around and shrugged, “Besides, what I am buying matters not to you, it’s for the complete and utter
Harry, Blaise, and Draco all shared concerned looks, “He’s a bit… mad,” Draco said.
“Did you know what you just did?” Draco asked. “You’re making my other cheek jealous.” He took a step towards Harry and hooked his arms around the omega. “You don’t want to do that, do you?”
“It’s not that,” Hermione said, momentarily taking over. “It is just that due to our second genders, when in an argument or presenting facts, the Omega would normally step down to try and calm the Alpha down, or that they would allow the Alpha to be right—”
“Lucius,” Mr. Riddle said, his voice low and icy. “I refrain you from making such comments in the presence of their surviving child. You are here to give consul when asked for and observed when I do not want to listen to you prattle. Understand?”
Draco smiled and took out his wand. He pressed it against Harry’s hand and whispered under his breath. There was a soft green glow and the scar on Harry’s hand faded only slightly but the pain went away. “That’s the best I can do, I’m sorry,” Draco said.
“Fair enough,” Ron shrugged. They found an empty compartment close near the end of the train and took it for their own. As soon as they all their luggage in the compartment, Hermione stood up to excuse herself. As soon as she came in, both Fred and George barged in looking rather mad. “Ron!” George yelled out, and the two grabbed the youngest male Weasley and pulled him out. And just like that, Harry found him strangely, coincidentally, alone. Then he felt something by his foot. He looked down and let out a scream.
When their period was over, the two quickly made their way out of he library and Draco led the way to Mr. Riddle’s classroom.
“Dr-Draco… we just met,” Harry blushed.
Niall just rolled his eyes and crossed his arms as he watched Harry. The young Omega focused entirely on the stick.
“I don’t know,” Bellatrix said, “I am clearly not stopping the wedding and I am useless here,” she looked depressed yet determined. “You sure I’ve played my part?”
He didn’t know how long he was picking through the pile, looking desperately for familiar words. He picked up a rather small piece and turned it over, seeing one word in a familiar scrawl.
“We are going, from this point forward, into the unknown. We shall be journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into the thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.”
“Well there’s a way for you to find out Malfoy, and you can decide for yourself,” Harry purred.
“Ah, thanks,” Harry said, yawning. “Sorry Ron, but I’m exhausted, I’m heading to bed now.”
“I am not scared you—Harry!” Uncle Sirius gasped, finally noticing Harry and Blaise.
“So what? You don’t care that she’s carving into my hand?”
“Draco Malfoy,” Harry answered. “He helped me figure out that the Ministry was blocking communication between me and Viktor. Please, where is he? Is he okay?” Tears started to brim in Harry’s eyes once more. Mr. Krum just stared at the two while Mrs. Krum stood up, looking just as teary-eyed. Without a word, she pulled Harry into a hug which the omega reciprocated.
“Good, now how about we help my poor husband in the kitchen, and then you and I can bring Harry breakfast?” Remus smiled.
Harry gave Draco a look but relented. He went to the bookshelf Draco pointed him to and was amazed to see that the vast bookshelf had editions and copies of books in various languages. He could not remember seeing any book in Spanish or French or even Japanese in Flourish and Blotts in Diagon Alley. Without any real plan of organization, Harry browsed the bookshelf while Draco talked with the shop owner. Harry pulled out books every now and again, leafing through the contents but never finding a potion or poison that he liked. He did not know how lone he was looking through when Draco approached him.
“Why are you up?” Harry asked, “it’s way past midnight.”
“Naturally, I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being—forgive me—rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.”
“The attack has been very violent,” Kingsley began. “Since he was a muggle, it is a miracle in itself that he survived. We can thank Greyback for that, as sick as that is. Greyback bit him while he was human, he did not change yet even though it was the full moon. Because of that, Connor did not turn into a werewolf… however he was conscious during your and his… encounter. He heard about the Dark Lord and magic so… we had to wipe his memory. This included his memory of you as well.”
“Excellent, then let us away,” Dumbledore said, “I’m afraid we will have to walk some distance before we can Apparate. Since you are still underage, you will be holding onto me.” He stood up, “Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, have a wonderful summer,” he said, “Harry here will come back before long.” He walked away, Harry following him.
Harry moaned as his body pressed against Draco, his hands clawing at Draco’s shirt. “Alpha,” he breathed, “shirt.”
“Last night?” Harry repeated. “It was… it was different, like I told Ron and Hermione. Different from Professor Lupin’s transformation, yeah—”
“I see that you are avoiding the
Remus frowned. “What do you mean?”
Harry looked over at the other side of the clearing where. sitting alone, was Professor Umbridge. She was dressed in her usual pink cardigan and looked alarmingly calm as she looked up at the members of the Wizengamot. It looked like the full assembly would judge in this trial, even the Minister of Magic was there, sitting in his seat and looking down at Umbridge grimly. If it was because of her actions or that they were caught, Harry didn’t know.
“Harry, we wanted—”
“I know, however, unfortunately, your husband has been incarcerated, and due to your unfortunate condition, you are not fit to raise them,” Dumbledore said. “As sad to say, we must face the facts, Remus. A werewolf with a lost husband is not a safe space for any child to live in, especially these two. Harry and Niall are safe where they are, and most importantly they are happy.”
“Sirius—”
“It’s been thirteen years, he won’t recognize us,” Harry said. “Come on Niall, I want to see our friend again! Please? We don’t want to disappoint him.”
“So why can’t they see it?” Harry demanded.
Harry’s grin stretched his face and he hugged Hermione, not caring that the others were watching. Hermione hugged back, and both were on the verge of tears.
Harry did not believe him; however, he knew that him filling the small bottle himself is much better than Voldemort doing it. The Omega inhaled deeply and closed his eyes as he cut his hand. “Ahhh!” He gasped in pain, dropping the knife, and immediately taking the bottle. Blood streamed down his hand and gathered at the bottle’s rim. Some spilled over down the side while others poured inside. Harry gasped and moved his hand, so all the blood fell into the tiny glass vial. He grimaced in pain, and closed his eyes, not wanting to watch his blood pool in the bottle. Harry stayed still, the blood pouring in as the wound bled faster than usual. Harry wondered if the knife was enchanted or if he just struck a major vein or artery. Before he knew it, the vial was snatched from his hands, and a wand was pressed against his hand.
“Sounds like a good idea,” Draco muttered, “and I feel that I cannot leave you, pet. You are my Omega, Potter.”
“Exactly,” Uncle Sirius nodded. Harry felt a strange heaviness he couldn’t explain. He stood up and hugged his uncles.
He appeared on the outskirts of a manor. He pulled his wand out and pressed it against his throat as he started to walk down the path until he felt the wards. The werewolf was surprised to see that he passed them easily, and he continued on, looking at the vast gardens with flamingos. “It is me,” he announced himself. “I’m here to call in that favor.” He continued to walk and reached two grand front doors. He knocked and waited.
“That’s great,” Niall smiled, “I’ll make sure to save you a seat.” Harry nodded in agreement and Harry said, “Oh! You have to meet Theo, he’s like one of the only two people I find reasonable there. He’s an Omega like me and really nice. We, we actually shared plushies last night,” Harry’s cheeks started to blush. “He has an Alpha named Blaise Zabini and they’re both very helpful.”
“Is Mr. Weasley still at work?”

Chapter 11
“I—” Uncle Remus looked as though he was going to protest but swallowed it, instead just nodding in agreement.
Ownership
Draco smirked and with a flick of his wand, Harry was completely naked and the curtains around his bed were closed. “Then I should do my duty as an Alpha and bring my boywife pleasure,” he purred. Harry moaned and nodded. He gave a scream as Draco suddenly lifted his lower body, Harry’s legs dangling over his head as his ass rested against Draco’s chest. His cock started to harden as his hole got wet. Draco spread Harry’s cheeks and grinned, “I think I’ll start with a little tongue play, be a good boywife, Harry, and scream.”
“No, that’s what we got you for,” Ron said cheekily. “Ow!” he flinched when she reached over to hit him. Harry shook his head, happy that the tension between his friends seemed to be over. His stomach growled and reminded him how hungry he was. He hasn’t eaten since breakfast, skipping on anything passed to him in Slughorn’s compartment. He was happy that his plate was already filled and began to eat.
“What Weasley? That I was be humble enough to actually sleep in this tower?” Draco interrupted. “Relax, we’ve shared a summer together. If I wanted to do anything to you I would have done it.”
“Thank you sir, but” Harry glanced at Draco. “During the full moon, as I told you, I remember everything. I’m still myself. And Draco was with me during the last times, and both of us were fine.”
“Yeah,” Harry said automatically, “it’s just rubbish. But…”
He envisioned a table, one side was shaded in black while the other was white. In between was just a mess, a pile of everything Harry cared about and everyone he loved or known. It was a beast of a pile, a collection of odds and ends and connections that made Harry feel scared whenever he thought about it. Harry wanted to sort it out, try to make some sense of the life he’s in but he couldn’t. He felt trapped by the mountain, even when he did his best to lift up one aspect of his life that he wanted to keep, he knew that somewhere in that mountain of connections were three others that conflicted it. He wanted to be with Draco, but that would mean he would have to jump through the hoops of Pureblood society and maybe ultimately giving up his friends. When he was alone, Harry never thought of it, he just thought of being Draco’s, having the blonde as his boyfriend. And now that he has… Harry felt something tighten inside him as the consequences seemed to be slowly closing in.
“Lucius,” Voldemort said in a purring tone, “Do not worry yourselves over my appearance, for today is a day of celebration.”
“One by one, my father deceived and tricked the old gods, angry and jealous of their powers. They were all of my grandfather’s siblings and children, however they are gods while my father was just an angel. It was his rebellion that triggered his fall and his conquer of magic and the gods. The one known to the Norse as Loki was the last to fall to my father, as he was the slyest and slipperiest of all. However, my father did trap Loki as a snake and buried him deep in a twisting cave that was grave to ghosts and lost souls. This cave was forgotten in time, earth laying over it, turning into a forest and a town nearby. It is said that a stump, wider than a human, is Loki’s tombstone, lost in the forest except for those who know the way.”
Inside the owlery, Draco called his owl and gave it the letter, instructing it to fly to his father as quickly as possible. The eagle owl soared off, and just as it did Harry saw a blur of white followed by a thud. Harry gasped and quickly knelt down. Hedwig was lying on the ground, her feathers all ruffled roughly and her wings bending at an odd angle. “Hedwig!” he cried. The owl was quivering. When Harry made to touch the wing, she gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself, and gazed at him reproachfully.
“Don’t say it like that!”
He expected the reaction as his Death Eaters all shifted, fearful to mutter or even question him. “No applause? No congratulations? Is there no happiness in my followers that their Lord’s family is reunited?”
“My glasses…” he said, his voice hoarse.
Luck shone on Draco a few minutes later when he saw a banner that was deep red with a golden lion hanging from a building that read
“She is,” Draco said.
Submission to Darkness
The last letter was from the night before the trial. “NO!” Harry screamed, he was fully crying by now. “I—I have to write back! I have to do something! Draco please!” He was fully sobbing into Draco’s chest. The Alpha wrapped his arms around Harry, shushing him.
“Tut, tut,” Professor Umbridge said, “That won’t do, now, will it? I should like you, please, to reply, ‘Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge.’ One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!”
Harry shook his head. “No, I don’t,” he said sadly.
“Oh,” Harry blushed. “I… I forgotten about that.” He bit his bottom lip, “I’ll think of something. I’m good at that. Lying on the spot.”
“I know, and because of your loyalty, I am here to free you all,” Voldemort said. He turned to Harry. “You will free them, Harry.”
“That medieval thing! Mrs. Weasley scoffed. “Half the time it gets the right results and the other half it just detects your dinner. Ahh, here we are…” Carrying an armful of containers, she gave Harry a little smile and said, “I’ll be back with a nice drink for you, calm down a bit until I return.”
“That’s a lie.”
“I know these potions, if you mix them just right, you can make a cloud that will have the best of both effects. The next task is me outrunning the imps, right? Well, with this all I need to do is throw it in the air and the potion cloud will stun them and give them horrible acne, as well as whooping cough! Maybe even some vomiting if it gets into their stomach.” Harry finished his concoction and moved to the next task. The imps chased him, and Harry threw the potion, and just as he described the vial exploded into a giant green cloud that enveloped the imps. They immediately began to cough as huge boils popped all over their bodies, one even started to vomit. Harry smiled and calmly moved onto the next task, which was getting past a group of snakes. Niall ran forward and jumped around them, using his wand to make small blasts with a Flipendo spell that Sirius taught them over the summer. Harry just smiled and walked towards the snakes.
“For a month—we’ll tell you later Harry,” Uncle Remus said.
“I know but…” Harry lifted his hand to hold the mark towards them, “my mark it feels warm… friendly even. Doesn’t yours?”
to dance the opening and walk in with a date. I so much wanted that to be Draco, but I didn’t know how to approach him. I simply couldn’t walk up to the prat and declare my love to him! That would be too embarrassing… and too much for both of us. And I was scared, you know. I mean what would happen if he was straight? Would his bullying increase? Would he spread the news that I’m gay? At that moment, the risks just were too much for me to take a chance. So, finding no one else, I’ve brought Parvati Patil… and that was a complete disaster. I mean, Ron and I were forced to watch others dance because I was too scared to ask Draco… and Ron’s too pigheaded at times. We left after our dates ditched us and went outside for a walk. Where we overheard Professor Snape and Karkaroff talking about something coming back… thinking back on it, I think I know what they were talking about, however I don’t want to tell you yet, Cedric. Anyway, on Christmas the next day, Fred and George demanded an update report on what happened the night before. They were a little frustrated that I didn’t tell Draco, or go to him, or even try… however I yelled back at how afraid I was of the consequences if he said no. That was when George told me something, I still don’t really understand. ‘Harry,’ he said, ‘in a Dominant/submissive relationship, you, the submissive, hold all the power. You are the one to call the shots, who decides how far to take it, and who decides when it ends. If you really want this relationship with Malfoy, go and create it. Don’t wait for him to come to you, it just doesn’t work that way.’ I mean, I get the obvious parts, you know like going after Draco, and not waiting for a relationship to happen. What I don’t get is the submissive having the real power, not that it matters much, I suppose.
“Yes, my lord,” Yaxley said. He stood up and bowed before leaving.
“Wait, Weasley’s an Alpha?”
“You actually believed me,” Ron said, “You didn’t give Harry a lap dance, he offered and your face just like turned into a tomato and you ran to the bathroom. But you did down fifteen shots in ten seconds.”
Remus frowned as he looked down at Harry. He sighed, “I do not know how but you mastered James’s pout,” he muttered. “Fine.” He took Harry’s offered hand and the two walked to follow Mr. Riddle.
“Just as you want to kill me,” Voldemort finished for him. “But would you risk everything we have been working towards?”
“Alright mate, say, when will you tell us?” Ron asked.
Harry stared at the board in slight horror. “This is shit,” he whispered under the scratching of quills on parchment. “She can’t be serious, can she?”
“What happened?” Draco asked.
“Liar, you’re just trying to dupe us,” Pansy said, “Watch! Tonight Potter’s going to do nothing but ride all the sixth year boys’ cocks! Even disgusting Crabbe and Goyle!”
Ron looked up and gave an empty look at Theo. “What do you want?” he muttered.
“Yes, as a new member you are required to attend to the Church every Saturday at the Witching Hour,” Mr. Riddle said. “There we have a choir of students who sings songs of praises to our Lord Lucifer and his demons. … I believe it would be good for you to join it as well.”
“So, will you go to the Burrow with me?” Harry asked.
“Oh my,” Mrs. Weasley said. “That really is strange. Well, the month is over either ways, and now we best stuff you with food. Would you mind helping a bit?”
He quickly shoved the ring onto Blaise’s finger, “With this ring I thee wed, I offer my heart, body and soul in everlasting love for thee,” he said a little too quickly. Satan was still sitting and Blaise was still standing where he was.
“Oh? And what’s that?” Draco asked.
Daphne’s voice was loud and clear as she said, “Is everything okay Ginny?”
“His godfather,” Neville answered seriously. “But uhh, maybe after dinner, unless food will mess something up.”
“Yes,” Harry moaned. Draco smacked the side of his head harshly with his cock.
He heard his uncle walk away and walked around his room, looking for a pair of shoes. Once found, he stood in front of his mirror, and made sure his make-up was still perfect. Around his eyes was a black eyeliner, subtle yet it drew attention to his emerald eyes. And a dark-pink lip liner just to give his lips an extra bit of detail. Simple, quick, but it worked for the boy.
Ch. 5
“It was nauseating, I thought I was going to throw up at any moment, and I felt like I had a high fever,” Draco said, Harry nodding in agreement. “We shouldn’t stay still, couldn’t breathe at some points. It felt like pins and needles were constantly being driven into us.”
“I don’t need a chaperone,” Harry muttered which caused Blaise to laugh.
“Ha! He’s still better than those Cannons that Weasel fancies! Honestly, Pot—Riddle, you think that any team favored by
“Um yes,” Draco said, glancing fearfully at Fenrir.
The Dark Lord moved on, Travers reaching out and begging for him to return. Harry gave the man one last glance before following him. They moved down a couple cells before stopping in front of another man. He looked similar to the first, but his eyes looked different. They looked angry instead of Travers’ glossy hopelessness. He recognized the Dark Lord immediately. “My Lord,” he said, getting to this hands and knees, bowing.
“What!?”
He’s a werewolf. Every month for the rest of his life he will turn into a monster, a half human half wolf creature hated by witches and wizards, and for the rest of time, he will always be shunned by the community. If they learn of his problem… Harry could see every door close to him. His face fell as did his heart. Because of Greyback, Harry’s life has already been decided. He will have little to no opportunities. Even if he wins the war, he will be forever hated just because of what that man did to him. He felt violated. He pulled his knees up to him as Lupin let go of him. Wrapping his arms around his knees, Harry just stared. He could feel his eyes start to well out and forced himself to calm down. He didn’t want to cry, to appear weak in front of them. Instead he just forced a smile. “I’ll be fine,” he said. “I’ll be fine.”
“From a guess, a creature of shadows,” Dumbledore said. “It seems to prefer the dark, moving in it easily but, as you can see, it is motionless in light. At least that is what I am theorizing.” He moved the cage from the light to a nearby shadowed dresser. He placed it on top and watched as the creature started to move, groggily as if it woke up. Dumbledore took the cage away from the shadows and the creature again laid limp in the light. “Fascinating… it can only move in shadows,” Dumbledore said. “Hand me that candle—we must keep this creature in light at all times.”
“Then we better draw up wedding plans,” Uncle Remus said in a half-serious manner. “But first, finish your breakfast Harry, I’m going to go telephone Molly and tell her we’re coming.”
“Fuck,” Harry muttered and glanced at Nagini who was still sleeping. He was still hard, very hard, and moved as quietly as he could to the bathroom where he took care of himself, reaching the climax that the dream denied him. He licked himself clean, liking the taste, and moved to the sink to wash up. “Day three,” He told himself as he stared in the mirror. “It’s all over.” He stared at he mirror and forced himself to push down his emotions until he smiled like the perfect son of Lord Voldemort. He showered, dressed in his school robes once more, and laughed at Nagini. “You are a lazy snake,” he smiled, moving to the bed. He sat down as his hand moved to his pocket. “Come on Nagini,” he said, patting his lap with his free hand.
“Do-not-make-this-situation-worse-for-yourself-Mr.-Potter!” Professor Umbridge said in one breath. “The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any dark wizards. If you are still worried, by all means, come and see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page five, ‘Basics for Beginners.’”
“It is not!” Niall defended. “We have to explain in detail the spells we use and why it is we used them! It helps us understand both the spells we learn and the spells we learn to defend against.”
Harry’s cheeks blushed and he licked his lips as he said, “I like it… when you call me pet and one more thing.”
“Harry, stop!” Viktor yelled and Harry felt a strong presence that emitted from Viktor. The omega inside him whined and begged for Harry to submit. He fought against it but found himself whining audibly, turning his neck a little to bare it for Viktor. The Alpha sighed and looked at Ron. “Leave us,” he commanded.
On the fourth floor, he stopped at the landing and moved to a nearby closed door that opened slightly at his will. He moved inside, the door fully closing once his whole body was in. The room was simple with just a large bed and two bedside drawers, a wide dresser opposite it with a window, and another tall wardrobe. The two Weasleys in the bed were snoring loudly, deep asleep. Voldemort slithered his way to the bed, moving underneath it. Perfectly hidden, he coiled underneath where Mrs. Weasley was sleeping and began to concentrate once more.
“Someone needs to fill in your father’s slot of being an influential,” Harry muttered before he could think. That earned him a sharp glare and a pinch on his thigh.
“No fucking!” Uncle Sirius yelled out.
Chapter 3
“Granger,” the beta said, “Surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
A Strained Burrow
“What did you and Ginny yell about?” Harry asked.
“Your dad’s place,” Sirius said. “Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad’s during the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold—he’s been wiped off here, too, that’s possibly why—anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potter’s for Sunday lunch, though.”
“It’s okay,” Hermione whispered. She hugged George, who squeezed her tightly, before moving to Ron and Ginny, hugging them as well. Harry hugged them as well and he and Hermione stood close to one another, Hermione’s hand finding Harry’s, and they watched as the Weasleys followed Professor Umbridge outside. They returned to their armchairs and sat silently.
“Oh really?” Ron drawled.
“No, Malfoy, this is not a joke!” Voldemort said. “Ask your son who he has been… fraternizing with.”
“Better, thank you,” Cedric said. He gave a sigh and looked around, “that was something in the hospital wing, ehh? You and the Minister yelling at each other?”
THE END
“Nothing,” Harry finally said. “Just thought of something funny, that’s all.”
Harry did not realize that the rope tying him to the tombstone was done, nor that he was now standing in front of the Dark Lord. All that mattered was the hazy feeling inside his head, mixed with thoughts of the boy he loved. Nothing else mattered, nothing else existed. He wanted him, wanted to submit to him… he was scared of losing him… even if the boy Harry loved did not know his attraction. There was also the power behind the Dark Arts, the sense of thrill Harry felt when he casted the Killing Curse, and the morbid fascination that that spell was his first choice out of instinct.
“A SLYTHERIN CANNOT SPIKE MY FOOD!” Harry screamed, slamming his fist on the table out of frustration. “Hermione how can you not see this?”
“Actually sir, about that,” Harry blushed, but Draco interrupted him.
Cedric chuckled, “Blunt like your brothers,” he said, “I like it. Well… to be honest I had a feeling I liked both for a while but it wasn’t until your brothers actually that I sort of confirmed it.”
Deathly Research
Predictably enough, Neville was behind the counter as the two entered the café, talking with a pretty boy with black hair that looked around their age. He looked at them and smiled, “Draco, Harry, it’s good to see you! Can I get you anything?”
“Do you have your eyes on a certain Alpha?”
“Honestly, a little,” Cedric said. “But I know you’re a good man Harry,” he continued. “You know what you’re doing.”
“What? Can’t I just fantasize about you waiting for me at home?” Draco asked innocently. “You’ll wear a nice dress, kiss me when I get home and then I’ll pamper your every need while dinner is cooking. I’ll even let you wear those pink robes! Hell, I’ll wear a pink suit every now and again! I thought that’s what all Omegas want, right Theo? Daphne?” He looked at his two friends for help.
“I don’t know Draco,” Harry said. “I can’t bring myself to hate him either… I feel sorry for him in fact.”
He thought.
“I think I do,” Harry said softly, “you think that the society you grew up in is wrong, in this regard. That there is no real superiority… it’s just old men and women being scared of change.”
Smiling to himself, he finally released the two boys, his third arm disappearing as he took a step back. “I think I may have an idea of what is going on here, my sweet mages,” he purred.
At the Gryffindor table, Harry found Ron and Hermione and sat down silently between them. “Harry! There you are mate,” Ron said, “we couldn’t find you at the carraiges!”
“You know him?” Draco asked, looking at Ron, who shrugged.
“Yes Harry,” Draco said.
Both boys frowned. “How do you know our parents?” Niall demanded.
Remus reached for the stack of letters and looked at his boys. “What do you want to do with these?” he asked them.
“It’s not an accident,” Ron interrupted. “She knew what it was, Fred and George tried to use it on themselves years ago. Believe me when I found out I wanted to yell at my mum, but Harry stopped me.”
He felt an icy feeling, like freezing ooze slowly sliding down his land and letter, the ooze both pricking and slurping at his hand and the letter being pulled away before he felt nothing. “Umm… thank you,” he said uncertainly and then stood up a moment later. Not sure what to do next, Harry just sat and waited for Ron and Hermione to return.
“Well, Fudge’s been storming around the Ministry checking that nobody’s having any contact with Dumbledore,” George said. “Anyone who does get fired. Dad thought that Percy only got promoted because Fudge wanted him to spy on us and Dumbledore, Percy did not like that and he went completely berserk. He said a load of things, terrible stuff, he said he’s been having to struggle against Dad’s lousy reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no ambition and that’s why we’ve always been—you know—not had a lot of money, I mean—”
“Yeah, I’m an Alpha,” Hermione nodded. “I came into it a couple of days ago. I’m surprised that you’re an Alpha too Ron, I thought that you would be a Beta for sure! With your family history into consideration.”
Harry frowned, confused. “What do you mean?” he asked. “You said it yourself, I’m the best Seeker we had since Charlie Weasley!”
“I was going to say basil!”
news my dear Nagini shared my way.”
“He was younger, the older muggle could handle it,” Harry said. Voldemort did not comment. He just stare at his son as the boy went back to reading. It was almost midnight and Voldemort retired for the night, leaving Harry in the care of Nagini. Harry looked up momentarily to see that his father left. He looked down at Nagini and smiled.
“Because I trust them more than I trust Dumbledore,” Harry said. “Look, can you just come with me and Ron? I want to talk with you.”
In Hogwarts, Remus became the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, wanting to be closer to Harry and Niall. On his first day in Hogwarts, Niall and Harry sat with him in his office as he talked with them. “I want to be with you two,” he explained. “And Sirius and I talked that this would be the best thing for all of us.”
The door to the common room opened ten minutes later and Draco took a breath and looked up to see Harry walking slowly in. The omega saw him and blinked confused. “Malfoy? Why are you up?” he asked.
“Neither boys will answer any of your questions,” Mr. Riddle yelled once more. “I will gladly answer any and all questions at my home in an hour’s time—until then I only want to bring my Omega and son home! Now please, move out of the way.”
Harry and Draco shared a sad look. They lifted up their hands to show Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus the two new marks that just recently made their home there. The men examined the sharp spirals and looked towards Blaise. “You marked my nephew!” Uncle Sirius said angrily.
“No,” Harry said too quickly, “he can’t do that.”
Giving his massive cock a couple strokes, it was already leaking as he stepped up to his boys. He pushed his cock gently against their lips, “That’s it boys, kiss around my cock,” he moaned. The two moaned in response, their mouths opening and lips spreading as they kissed over the musky cock, their senses being overloaded with it’s smell and heavy taste that went straight to their brains.
Draco Malfoy was with his grunts in a compartment near the back end of school, along with a few other Slytherins that Harry always had the displeasure of seeing. There was, obviously, Pansy Parkinson, and Daphne Greengrass, as well as Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini. Harry found the compartment easily and did not bother knocking as he opened it.
Harry bit his lower lip. “I don’t have it,” he said. “I don’t have any of my things on me. Every summer, Uncle Vernon locks everything I own in the cupboard where I used to sleep.” Harry should have known better, but still, when the Dark Lord exploded in anger, Harry flinched. The Alpha’s anger radiated the room, and the Omega did his best to make himself as small as possible in his undefendable state. Voldemort saw this, but his anger did not diminish. Instead, he growled out, “I am not angry at you, my son, but at those disgusting muggles you were forced to call ‘family.’ When Dumbledore takes you, I will kill them all.”
“Well, let’s go then,” Blaise shrugged and stood up. “Come along Harry,” he led the way. Harry stayed in his seat for a second before moving to follow Blaise. The corridors were packed with students waiting for the lunch trolley. Harry worked to stay close to Blaise as they made their way to compartment C.
“Mother knows best,” Lilith said, and she disappeared through the doorway.
“I had my suspicions at first,” Remus said. “Sirius and I always knew that Harry was adopted. Lily and James told us the news the day after they got Harry. Dumbledore told them that his parents tragically died and, well, they’ve been trying since they got married. That, as well as the fact that I never had a Harrison as a student, not in any of my years and the way you describe him and Harry’s reactions, they both added up.”
“I just got here today,” Draco said, immediately.
“Look I don’t like that Harry’s dating him either but I’m open for giving him a chance,” Ron shrugged. “After everything Harry told me, I can understand why he is doing what he’s doing.”
“Unacceptable—”
“You’re not mad?” Harry asked.
“What do you want? Who are you?” Niall demanded.
They looked up to see Albus Dumbledore standing in the entrance hall, smiling at them. “I thought you would be with the other new students, coming to Hogwarts via the small boats sailing across the lake.”
Several loud bangs like loud gunshots rang through the air, and there was finally silence. “Order!” Scrimgeour yelled once more. “Dumbledore explain yourself! What do you mean Mr. Riddle is You-Know-Who? And Mr. Riddle why are you laughing!?”
Draco was suddenly the center of attention. Usually, he would love this. He would bask in everyone looking at him, both in awe and interest, but then things… happened. And now, Draco felt his face reddened and he tried to hide behind his drink, muttering a hello. Harry took a step forward and gave Draco a wide grin, their eyes connecting. Draco’s face reddened even further as Harry smoothly put his hands over Draco’s and tipping the cup so he sipped Draco’s drink. “Hello Draco, my name’s Harry Potter, it’s a
“Good boys… now Draco, return the favor,” Blaise said. “I want to see your pretty lips full of cum too. Harry, you’re ready? I’m going to put it in.”
Harry chuckled.
Halloween day was cloudy, threatening to rain all day. Harry and Draco sneaked away to an empty room for some snogging right before the Halloween feast. Harry was naked, kneeling in front of Draco as he deepthroated his cock, moaning around the thick member as he fisted his own cock. “Fuck Harry, yeah swallow my cock,” Draco groaned, pushing his cock deeper in Harry’s throat. Harry moaned, quickly reaching his orgasm. He came on Draco’s shoes just as Draco grabbed his head and pushed roughly against his head, Draco’s balls smashed against Harry’s chin as he came inside, the omega swallowing greedily.
Draco frowned, but both Harry and Blaise squeezed his hands supportively. “It’s not just a trifle manner, father,” he said hesitantly, growing a little stronger as he went on. “I love Harry with all my heart. This wedding may just be a ploy to beat Blaise’s father, but that doesn’t mean my feelings are fake. Father, I am going to marry Harry and Blaise. If not soon, then later after Satan is dealt with.”
“What d’you—”
“Since there’s three of us… who does the proposing?” Draco asked curiously.
“… are absolutely stupid to think they would win! Have you seen their seeker? He’s broader than a barn and stupider than a pigeon!” Harry said.
“Certainly not,” Voldemort said. “You will be eating it with me, in the dining room with our hosts.” He took out his wand and stepped away. He pressed his wand to himself and waited. Harry watched as Voldemort’s appearance changed. His skin grew healthy, while his face turned handsome, hair sprouting and growing until it was a neatly kept mixture of raven hair. His eyes turned brown, and his body seemed to fill out more, looking more physically stronger than the skeletal monster that stood in front of him. “Better,” Voldemort said, pocketing his wand. He saw Harry staring and chuckled, “Surprised?”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded softly. “Could he get us at Hogwarts?” he asked.
his parents are followers of Voldemort!” That shocked Ron out of his stupor as he jumped at Voldemort’s name. He looked between Harry and Hermione but said nothing.
“I’m not lying, and I’m not mad!” Harry told her, his voice rising to a shout. “I tell you, I saw it happen!”
Harry frowned, “What’s wrong?” he asked, sitting down across Dumbledore. Dumbledore looked at Harry for a long time, as though debating on how to tell Harry. The Omega felt a prick in his mind and was thankful for his father’s shield.
Draco didn’t know how long he sat there staring at space before his senses took control again. Blushing mildly, he stood up and made sure both his suitcases were intact before walking into the dormitory. A very grumpy woman behind a security desk helped him get his key, find his dormitory, and after twenty minutes to take his photo ID taken. Draco thanked her but she just glared at him and muttered under her breath about buying toilet paper before looking back at whatever she was reading.
Harry frowned at that and huffed. He looked up at the staff table and found himself tapping his fingers against the table as he waited. Nobody talked to him, certainly not Draco, and finally, after what felt like an eternity, Dumbledore stood up to dismiss them. Harry was the first to stand, even though he had no idea where he was going. The Omega suddenly felt very alone in the crowd and started to look around for his brother out of habit. He found Niall looking equally as lost on the other side of the room and they both noticed that their groups were all heading the same way. The twins kept an eye on each other as they walked down the room and reunited just outside the Great Hall, hugging each other fiercely.
“Me neither,” Sirius sighed. “Anyway, how about we go to bed?” He looked at his Omega with a smirk and wiggled his eyebrows, “Come on love, we need practice on keeping you quiet.”
“Thank you, I think we get the picture,” Blaise interrupted. “So we simply have to put our magic into it and say my father’s name?”
“Take your pants off then,” Connor commanded. “Got a special treat for you.” Harry smiled and separated from his summer fling. He shoved his pants off, kicking off his shoes and socks, until he stood naked in front of Connor. “Good boy,” Connor said. “Get on your back and show me how much you can stretch,” he winked.
Thank you for your continued support! Your comments really make my day <3
Lucifer turned, shocked, to see Mrs. Malfoy was standing. She looked at her husband, “Our son is in trouble Lucius! We have to help!” She outstretched her hand and joined in the chant. “Lucifer Morningstar! Light-Bringer! I bind you! Get
“Perfect!” Loki smiled. He slipped away from them and sat on the stone table. He suddenly had clothes, wearing a white robe with black spots, it was a size too small for him, hugging his boobs and bulge. “So,” he said, “I’m guessing that this Harry here is the blushing bride? What will he be wearing? Normally I would have a beautiful dress made of itchy cloth that will give you these awful rashes—but that is just child’s play—why don’t we ask my sister?”
Potter Twins Outed!
“Yeah,” Harry nodded. He took a hold of Blaise’s hand, “We both have feelings for you Blaise… romantic feelings. And, well, we both want you to be our boyfriend.”
Lilith rolled her eyes and turned to look at Bellatrix, still leaning against the banister. “You are so boring like that,” she said, “Did you know that? I gave you an egg that contained all of your hard work to manifest into a monster capable of killing Potter, and what do you have for it? An old woman eaten in half. Honestly Bella, I feel you’ve used all your energy and creativity in Greendale, and even then, you were wrong.” Lilith shook her head. She glanced over her shoulder, as if staring at something, before looking back at Bellatrix, “I don’t know what to do with you, woman,” she said.
“Good. Now if there are anymore questions, Harry,” Lord Voldemort said, switching tones quickly as he turned his attention to Harry, “I will be on my way.”
There was a soft rapping sound against his window. Sitting straighter, Harry waved his hand and the music stopped as he moved to the window with the tapping sound. Pulling open a curtain, he smiled brightly when he saw Draco Malfoy crouching in front of the window, standing on the slanted part of the roof that covered the first floor. Harry quickly opened the window and helped Draco inside, the blonde pulling Harry into a tight hug. “Missed you boyfriend,” Draco purred.
“Ginny and I went shopping for a little bit, I uh… talked with her, and I think she’s starting to get around the idea of you and Malfoy, Harry,” Hermione said. “That and everything that is coming out about Professor Dumbledore.” She looked nervous, as though she was stepping on eggshells.
“Are you suggesting, Minister, that these boys are lying about being abused?” Mr. Malfoy asked.
“Yeah, sure,” Harry said.
“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,” George said.
“Who is a blood purist! Honestly Draco, are you one as well?” Harry demanded. “Do you really think that purebloods are superior to half-bloods? To muggleborns?”
“How smooth, Malfoy,” Harry chuckled.
“No, I didn’t,” Harry said. “I uhh didn’t get the chance.”
“No sir,” Harry said, eyeing the potions with disdain. “Sir, if I can ask, is it normal for professors to accept such rancid results?” he asked pointing to the two potions in particular. “In Durmstrang, you see, if a student tried to hand in something like this,” he picked up the vial with the tar-like substance, “they would have failed the semester.”
“I KNOW YOU’RE GAY YOU DON’T HAVE TO BLOODY REPEAT IT!” Ginny screamed. Her nostrils flared angrily, tears gathered around her eyes and her face was just as red as her hair. She breathed heavily before taking a step back, blinking. “Sorry,” she said.
Like ripping off a band-aid, Harry winced as he said, “Voldemort is actually my father.”
“Yes,” a female voice said from the robes. “I was wondering what you were planning.”
“So nothing really changes on that end, eh?” Ron said, giving him a supportive smile. Harry blinked at that.
“It must have been a shock though, right?” Neville asked.
Mr. Riddle’s face darkened. He stepped forward and looked between the two of them, “That is the point, Mr. Potter,” he said grimly. “Now, you may think an unholy matrimony between the two of you and that demon might stop our Lord Lucifer, but you are wrong. Mr. Malfoy has informed me of your plans, Harry Potter. You have been chosen, Harry, to become our Dark Lord’s wife. It is your duty then to become it and perform all womanly duties that comes with the honor.”
A sleepy, hazy, lazy relaxation fell on the three of them as before they knew it, a full month and a half passed by with not plotting, no mysteries, or any real development. It was December, snow was starting to fall gently from the sky, and that was when Harry’s skill was tested, and his life almost stolen. An unfortunate harshness that begin, quite simply and uneventfully, with the dull electronic chime of a doorbell.
He pressed his nose to the ground and continued to smell. He was away from London, away from Diagon Alley, but he knew that he was heading towards his bitch. It was weak, and for some reason weaker, but Fenrir could still feel a line between him and his bitch, a line that was created when he turned the boy. He followed it, speeding through the woods before stopping suddenly.

Harry looked around, then down at himself, realizing that he was still in his wedding suit. “Yeah,” he said, “But I doubt you have clothes here that’ll fit me.”
“You don’t need to apologize to me,” Harry said.
“I used to be there,” Sirius said, pointing at a small, round charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. “My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home—Kreacher’s quite fond of muttering the story under his breath.”
“Where I go?” Harry frowned. “I still don’t’ see the problem,” he shrugged.
“Yes sir,” Harry whispered. He started to take off his robe.
Harry did not know how long he was standing there before he snapped out of his thoughts and got out of the closet. The Hogwarts Express would leave soon, and Harry definitely did not want to miss it. He rushed out of the castle, quickly mixing with the large group of students who were traveling down to Hogsmeade Station. On the way, he found Ron and Hermione and they joined the long, slow task of boarding the Express for the summer holidays.
Harry looked up at Voldemort. “Would that amuse you?” he asked. “Would it make you happy knowing that I’m beaten daily at the place I’m forced to call home? That every day I live in fear, not of you, but whether or not this will be the day that Uncle Vernon goes too far. That even now, I probably have broken bones and scarred skin not because of you and your followers, but because my Uncle decided to use the belt or the cane instead of his fists. Does that amuse you, Lord Voldemort?”
“Hermione, please, just stop,” Harry said. “Draco won’t bring me to Voldemort. Look—there are things I talked about that Ron already knows and I want to tell you too, but not here. Not now.”
“I know,” Harry agreed. “Draco and I agreed when we are older, we’re doing it again, a proper wedding, where it’s more than just Death Eaters.”
“He said that he’s bound to us, well more precisely Harry, but me too,” Draco said. “These marks prove it.”
Draco was livid when he walked into the Slytherin Common Room that night. Harry was with his friends in Gryffindor Tower, probably nursing his pride and wound that Goyle caused. Draco wanted to go after Goyle immediately, but Harry distracted him from reminding him of their bet… and Harry’s reward, which, Draco admitted, was fun for both of them. As Draco walked in, all he heard was laughter.
Shocking Sorting
Chapter 8
“We will see,” Snape said, and he gave Blaise his schedule with a bit too much force as he walked away. Harry opened his schedule to see that he still had all the same classes he had at Durmstrang, just replacing Dark Arts with Defense Against the Dark Arts. That day, he had History of Magic, double Potions, Ancient Runes, and Double Defense, with Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts with the Gryffindors, and Ancient Runes for all fifth years who took it.
“Well, at least that’s one good thing,” He sighed, “Maybe this will stop Granger’s disappointment.”
“Very good,” Mr. Riddle said. “And if I ask you, say, who Abaddon is?”
“You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please.”
The two looked at each other, “I mean, there’s a lot,” Daphne started.
Harry laughed, “Of course not,” he smiled. “Look, I’m our Captain, and Draco is still Slytherin’s Seeker. Yeah I can see how some people might find that problematic, but honestly if Draco tries to use his Alpha-charms or whatever to make me tell him stuff about our team, I’ll punch him.” Ron snickered loudly while Hermione just rolled her eyes. “Besides Ron,” Harry continued, “We have all of October to practice—the first match isn’t until the second week of November!”
“I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I’ve decided that I do not want to become an Auror based on valid reasons, this has nothing to do with what is going on,” Harry said. “As you have told me before, it is a rather dangerous profession, and honestly I’m done with danger. I want to go into something that seems more beneficial and worthwhile than basically the wizarding version of a muggle cop.”
“Uh-huh,” Harry nodded and the two moved to Draco, pinning him down and lapping at his face like puppies until he was perfectly clean from cum, but still wet from their tongues.
The others stared in anticipation and small fear at Harry. They were all silent, not one wanting to speak, all eyes on Harry, only to glance at one another every now and again. Harry slept for ten minutes before waking up, he felt drained, extremely moody, and tired. His eyes were still heavy, and his head still pulsed madly, but that slowly went away as he regained more and more consciousness. “Ouch,” He groaned.
“Not that type of carrying, oh bugger,” Sirius groaned. “Pregnant. Harry’s body is changing so that he can get pregnant. All Omegas can carry children. Well…” he glanced at Remus hesitantly, who smiled softly.
“Be in my room,” Harry said. “Dumbledore is getting a supply of the Wolfsbane Potion. I guess I should expect him today. I remember Lupin talking about having to take the Potion daily a few days before the actual moon but still… like I said, I don’t feel anything.”
“That does not matter,” Dumbledore said, “You both should not have even step foot into Durmstrang.”
Draco left Yaxley where he was standing, and went into Dystyl Phaelanges, a shop that sells bones exclusively. The Strangler requires flesh, muscle, and bones to make it so hands were strangler its victim. Without Yaxley hounding him, Draco was able to get the bones, freshly crushed into fine sands, easily and swiftly. With his shopping for the potion done, Draco thought for a moment before shrugging to himself. He heard of a sex shop nearby, and just to back up his lie, he went and spent half an hour in it. He found a couple of fun toys and clothes he wants to see Harry try, including a very fun pair of leather panties.
“Are you staying?” Harry asked hopefully.
“Even if that’s true, Potter’s still a whore,” Pansy said victoriously, “a loose cheap whore who’ll do anything for cock.”
“Good boy,” Harry said, as though talking to a dog. He grinned widely at the glare Niall gave him and slipped away. “Anyway, I’ll see you at dinner,” he said.
“Sure, why not,” Draco shrugged. “Singing’s fun.”
“Who is this?” Viktor demanded.
Ron laughed, “Sorry,” he snorted, “it’s just—wait hang on did you tell her yet that you’re gay?”
“Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” George groaned, throwing the prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.
“I do not know, but we can go outside and speak about it, this castle is beautiful,” Viktor said.
Harry smiled at that and watched as Neville walked away. Hermione still looked unconvinced about the whole ordeal, however, thankfully she did not bring the matter up at all during the day. However, his day did not go smoothly. The harassment seemed to only increase as time went on, people hissed and jeered at him when Professors were not looking or weren’t around. Ron and Hermione chased them off, even took off points, but that only seemed to encourage the braver ones to laugh at Harry. Draco was entirely busy with his classes, and the two only had a ten minute in between to hug and stay with each other. He told Draco his plans, and the Alpha kissed him good luck before having to run for class.
“To think that the dog and beast can raise an omega with morals,” Mr. Malfoy sneered. “Do you know, Mr. Potter, that the last time I had to deal with you, it was with setting your deadbeat uncle out of Azkaban as well as expediting your and your brother’s adoption papers to transfer your guardianship from your muggle relatives to Black? I was under the impression that this would be the last I would have to deal with your family.”
“She has good taste,” Ron hummed. “Come on, let’s find Harry and the others!” He took Draco’s arm once more, and Draco only had enough time to grab his drink and take a sip as Ron pulled him out of the kitchen. Ron waved and yelled out to people he knew, but he did not stop as he continued to search for this Harry. Draco kept his eyes open too, wondering what this Harry looked like.
“Like what?” Harry asked.
“Indeed, we are not. So you are not pregnant, and I can smell that you are unmated—as well as see that your neck is completely bare. So, Potter, why is it that you are here, and what exactly is your relationship with my son?” Mr. Malfoy asked.
“I—well, no, but you see,” Ron sputtered, “it’s different!”
“Uncle Sirius—”
“That is why I am here, but why are you here, oh great ‘Chosen One’?” Draco asked with his usual dry sarcasm.
“Very well,” Professor McGonagall nodded. She riffled through Harry’s folder before finding a sheet of paper. Using her wand, she erased some lines before looking up at him. “Do you have any interests or ideas on what you would rather do?”
“Harry, we’re really sorry!” Hermione said desperately, her eyes now sparkling with tears. “You’re absolutely right, Harry—I’d be furious if it was me!”
Draco entered the compartment, followed by a smug looking Pansy Parkinson. “Harry, you’re here,” Draco smiled and immediately moved to sit down next to his boyfriend, taking his head softly and bringing him in for a kiss. “I hope the others weren’t rude.”
“What?” Harry demanded. The demon turned to stare at him.
Voldemort gave the man a sharp look, growling slightly. “You will provide my son with clothing without your comments or else we will take our money elsewhere.”
“Alright… however since I’m rubbish at chess, I think I’ll need someone to help me with,” Harry said. He looked at Draco with a small, shy smile, “can you help me Draco?” he asked, his voice changing slightly. The blonde’s cheeks tinted red.
“That traitor!” Travers snarled. “My lord, please, if you will let me out and I will help you—I have only done all to please your will.”
Harry turned to see Ron and the Weasley family, looking at him with concern. It was only them and him. “Harry… are you okay?” Ron asked.
“However if you continue this jealous streak, I have no problem with staying my November heat alone as I did with October’s,” Harry said. Draco gasped as though the thought was impossible.
Potter moved to Theo and the two boys swapped plushies, rubbing them on their scent glands before giving them to the other to add to their nest. It was adorable, it was endearing, and it made Draco’s heart throb. He wanted to grab Potter and watch him scent something to give to him, anything, even if it was a pair of rolled-up socks! He wanted to see that innocence again. But Potter closed his curtains and Draco was forced to go to sleep with Potter in his mind and a hardness in his pants.
“Good. Now, the day is over, and I believe you have homework to do. Best go home and do it Mr. Potter,” Mr. Riddle said. Harry nodded and moved quickly to leave the classroom. Draco was waiting on the stairs and Harry grabbed his hand to pull him down.
Next time sexy time! Along with some plot.... just a little.
“Then why don’t you show me Dumbledore’s receipts?” Voldemort asked. “It is your civil duty, after all, the man has been feeding them to my son, an Omega, without anyone knowing.”
the voice chuckled.
—I think the potion is working,” he muttered. “Look Ron, Hermione, what I’m about to say is going to stay between us, is that understood? Nobody will find out, they can’t. There will be times where I’m going to be unavailable, I’ll won’t be in here, no matter how long you look. I’ll be gone from ten to four mostly and I need you two to cover for me, say I’m cleaning elsewhere, distract people, do whatever you need to do, understood?” Both his friends nodded.
“You’re going to make me that potion, now,” Harry snapped, “fucked me seven times—I can’t believe it! We’ve only been dating for a week!”
the snake said. It continued its approach towards Harry. Harry waited until the snake was directly in front of him to answer.
“I’m am not your love!” Harry screamed. “You have no right to call me that—”
“Half a liter,” Harry groaned in pain, his eyes were wet with tears. “That’ll kill me!”
Harry nodded and looked around the room. It was exactly as he left it. Nothing out of place, nothing moved or even bothered with. He was surprised at how much he did not care that the Dursleys didn’t seemed bothered by his absence. He had a new family now with Voldemort, his real family. That thought tugged at his brain as he tried to rationalize why the old grandfatherly man he knew would do this. “Father,” he said, “I don’t know how to begin to ask Dumbledore about why he did what he did.”
“What is going on?” Hermione demanded. “What secret are you two keeping from me that is so important?”
The Killing Curse shot from Harry’s wand like a bullet leaving its chamber. Whizzing through the air, the silent killer missed its mark, instead the curse exploded into a tombstone near the hooded figure, shattering it to pieces. His head burning too much to take another shot, Harry fell next to Cedric. Through the pain, harry felt himself being pulled to his feet.
“Yeah but err… we’re also um dating Blaise now…” Harry slowly, “Ever since the attack we uhh talked about it …”
and my parents that I am currently busy, and so, I will not be joining him. And as a married man, I will not allow nor accept any demands from my in-law.”
“That’s good,” Draco nodded. “Harry… I didn’t know that your birthday is today.”
Harry returned to the Slytherin common room to find Draco waiting there with his parfait and two cups of tea. Draco stood up as Harry walked towards him and his eyes immediately went to Harry’s hand. “Would you mind if I?” he asked softly.
Nott did not look convinced, but he leaned back.
“I love you too Tom,” Remus said. Those five words both soothed and hurt Voldemort. Here was a man who loved him, a man who adored him and was having his child… and yet Voldemort had a chilling realization that he was lying to him.
Harry thought he would be scared, but instead he asked calmly, “Do you know it?”
Dark Lord Harry
“Move,” Draco ordered. He turned to Theo, Blaise, and Daphne and raised a hand in goodbye. Harry frowned but moved out of the compartment.
the latest of which had a full-blown picture of him from Fourth Year and the caption,
“Me? No, no, I don’t know anything about Harry,” Fletcher said.
Draco glared at Harry. With a huff, he moved into the kitchen and grabbed a towel. “You wash, I will dry,” he said in a commanding tone. Harry returned the glare, but silently went to the sink and started to scrub a little aggressively at the plates in the sink. “How many?” Draco asked.
“Harry—”
“Ron you know that isn’t what I meant,” Hermione said. “Look, they’re still dragging Harry’s name through the mud still and—”
Harry moved into the kitchen and smiled at Ginny, waving at her. Ginny, however, did not wave back to him. Harry sat down as Mrs. Weasley placed a plate of hot scrambled eggs with bacon in front of him. “Eat up dearie—oh, both of you should be happy to hear this, Hermione just arrived this morning.”
“Okay,” Harry shrugged. He wasn’t going to bother with her at all, or most of them really. Instead, his mind went to more important matters as he gathered food on his plate. “When do we get our schedules?” he asked. “Do we make them ourselves or are they made for us?”
Hermione nodded along while Ron just stared at him. “Flying?” he asked. “Were you on the Quidditch team?”
“What’s the Order of the—”
“Of course, I hope that I did not give you too much to worry about,” Dumbledore said. Harry shook his head.
Then, with a deep, demonic roar, Blaise came deep in Harry’s ass, filling the pussy to the brim with his seed. His cock kept pulsing, and Harry moaned as he felt himself being filled more and more, the thick jizz leaking out of his hole. Draco pushed himself up and started licking the cum trailing down Harry’s taint. Blaise kept cumming for a minute straight, fucking Harry throughout his orgasm until, finally, with a sloppy wet sound, he pulled out and Draco got between them, licking Harry’s ass and taint clean of cum. He looked up at Blaise, who snickered.
“Oh… right,” Neville said. “Uh, I’m sorry, it’s just hard to wrap my head around sometimes. I believe you, Harry, I do, but… it’s Dumbledore!”
Harry glanced at Draco. The taller teen quickly got to Harry’s side and grabbed his free hand. Feeling is boyfriend’s heat gave Harry the courage to speak freely without any hesitation to the demon.
“It’s fine,” Harry said a bit too short.
He stretched his right hand out in front of him—the hand with the missing finger. He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward. Harry watched with great intensity, his anger making him stoic as Wormtail brought the knife down. His scream pierced the night as the hand fell to the ground. Wormtail had to pick it up through anguished panting and dropped it into the cauldron. “I hope that hurts,” Harry snarled. “Every bit of pain you feel will be nothing compared to when I get free.”
Draco shrugged, however, he frowned slightly at the memory. His parents hated the idea. Completely so that Mr. Malfoy had the gull to slap Draco right in front of his grandparents, snarling angrily about how a Malfoy would never defile themselves and go so low to do “such a pathetic activity.” He shook his head to clear the memory and looked at Ron, “Just didn’t work out,” he said.
“It will my friend, it will indeed,” the very handsome Mr. Garrison said. “Now, gentlemen, please lead me to where we can be alone, and we can begin right away.”
He forced Vernon to the couch, the man struggling against an invisible force as Aunt Petunia floated into the air and hovered into the kitchen, directed by Voldemort’s wand. The Dark Lord followed her and turned on all the burners on the stove. A drawer opened and sharp knives flew out, landing on the stove.
“Actually Weasley, yes I am,” Draco said, “Since apparently I’m one of the few
“Do you swear to pledge yourself wholly and fully to the Dark Lord now and forever?” Voldemort asked.
“Well you have an excuse, it was only inevitable for you and Viktor to get together,” Niall chuckled. “I’m the one who sucks. But come on, we should probably head back.”
“Wait… you mean that the Dark Lord’s soul is inside you—like right now?” Draco asked.
“Sorry,” Hermione said, her cheeks turning pink.
“What are you doing?” He demanded.
Harry eyed Zabini suspiciously. “I just don’t know how to feel is all,” he said cautiously. “I feel like one moment I’m pulled one way, the next I’m pulled another, sooner or later I feel like I’ll have to choose, or just split apart.”
“On the other hand, if you would like to impress a person, boys, you would put them near the aisle and front, so as they have perfect view of both Harry’s walk up and the wedding itself,” Mr. Malfoy continued. “We want to honor the Dark Lord, making it so he comes, while I tell Mr. Riddle that his days as High Priest are, thankfully, numbered as your marriage will serve as a way for the Malfoy family to raise higher.”
“Well, did you want to kiss her back?” Harry asked.
“God I hope so,” Draco said, holding Harry even tighter now. It was deathly, hearing the claws so close attacking the wall, knowing that all that stood between you and whatever was outside was a single layer of wood. Draco had his wand trained on the spot and for the first time wished that he could turn as well. That was he could claw out whoever thought to scare his Omega.
“Oh, you won’t need ink,” Professor Umbridge said with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice.
“Still in trouble, major trouble,” Harry panted, “but don’t you dare stop.”
Harry stayed curled on his bed, angry tears falling from his eyes and stinging his bruised cheeks. His body jittered with pain, he felt as though he was having aftershocks from a Cruciatus Curse. His bones ached horribly and for a moment he thought that they were broken as he forced himself to stand. His stomach and chest felt as though they were on fire, burning heavily. He took off his shirt and looked down at his body. Thankfully, nothing was sticking out. There were many, many blows, yes, and cuts from where the harder parts of the cane smacked him, but there was nothing major.
Ron jumped at the voice and looked, “Oh! Harry, how’d it go?” he asked.
“Strange, when we checked, Harry seemed normal, testosterone levels wise,” Dumbledore muttered, “unless you are just commenting on his looks.”
“Of course,” Mr. Malfoy whispered, and he bowed before saying that he will be back. Left alone with the house-elves, Harry returned to the kitchen and rummaged through his father’s pockets, pulling out his wand along with Voldemort’s, along with a scroll that had a list of names. “Peverell?” he muttered, reading the first name that had a question mark.
“I know,” Niall said. “You’ll find someone, I know you will. Even if he’s a British Alpha,” he gave his little brother a smirk.
“I know,” she groaned. “Hermione told me a week ago. Can you just leave me alone Harry? You’re making me feel stupider.” She looked downfallen. Harry didn’t know what to say.
“Erm, yes, sir,” Harry said. He stepped forward only for Umbridge to say, “As High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, I request to sit in this meeting. If the matters involve the school, it is my duty to address it.”
Voldemort looked at Remus expectantly, but Remus shook his head. “Inside,” he said and pulled his lover in. He did not let go until they were in their living room, both sitting down. Remus took a deep breath and stared at Voldemort. “Your Harrison,” he began. “He’s Harry Potter? Isn’t he?”
“Have you tried on dresses?”
“What’s the matter Potter? Finally realized you’re a better dog than wizard?” a cocky voice snarled. Harry looked up to see the compartment door was opened and Draco Malfoy was standing over him, his arms crossed and looking down at Harry with a sense of snobbish superiority. With him, as always, were Crabbe and Goyle, who laugh dumbly.
The piece of Voldemort’s soul laughed as both of them became entangled by dark tendrils. The tendrils connected them and pulsed. Harry felt power flowing into him, power he had never thought of, never felt before. Along with memories, skills, magic that he never deemed possible. Memories of learning how to shield his mind, of how to read others thoughts, and of killing. Countless killings. Harry screamed as every poured into him, filling him with greater magic and years’ worth of practice. His body pulsed with the tendrils, and he lurched forward, giving one final scream—
Moody grunted, both his eyes, magical and regular, staring at Harry. “Could be useful,” he said, “getting rid of his followers, eh?”
“I didn’t mean it like that, Niall,” Harry repeated but Niall just shook his head.
“Relax boy, I’m doing it slowly,” Draco said. He added a second finger and continued to twist and pump inside Harry, a wet slick noise coming from his hole. The weirdness continued on and on, but before Harry could protest, Draco’s fingers were removed, and something bigger, colder, replaced it. “Perfect fit,” Draco said, “It slid right in.”
They left and Harry gave a sigh of relief.
Life moved on, and after a couple more heats, both Harry and Niall found themselves as eleven years old with two letters congratulating them on being accepted to Durmstrang Institute.
“Badges? What do you mean?” Harry asked.
“Right,” Harry said, he looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puffing smoke and whirling; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore’s magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice.
The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began to file past Harry toward the door that Mrs. Weasley just came out of. Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs. Weasley stopped him.
“Yeah, you like?” Harry grinned. “My godfather gave it to me for my birthday last year. Gave my mom a heart attack. Come on, there’s plenty of room for both of us.” He winked at Draco and let go of his hand only for him to hand Draco a helmet. Harry stared at Draco as the blond put the helmet on before shrugging off his leather jacket, revealing his nicely muscled arms. “Here, wear this too, it can get cold as we ride,” Harry said, handing Draco the jacket.
“Remus it’s not like that,” Harry said quickly, not wanting them both to leave. “My father doesn’t want any of this—he hates what the Death Eaters turned his research into!”
The Trial
“Got it,” Niall nodded. The two practiced setting sticks on fire for the rest of the afternoon. Harry kept the book with him, and he curled against his brother in their cupboard to read it whenever he could. They tried everything they could think of from summoning things that were around the house when the Dursleys weren’t looking to setting more sticks on fire, and even summoning food for them to sneak into the cupboard for when they were locked up. The boys quickly became proficient at the small bits of magic they could do out of necessity, and Harry found himself feeling strangely happy over it all.
“Isn’t it a little early boys, to be in the library?” a voice said. They turned to see Mrs. Lestrange, looking down at them. “Shouldn’t you boys be in the cafeteria eating breakfast if you are so early?”
“Fine, but I’ll listen to everything,” Uncle Sirius said warningly as he stood up, giving Draco a glare.
“Why’s that?” Uncle Sirius asked, “isn’t he in the clouds?”
“Come ignore them,” Harry said, opening his arms for a hug. “They’ll go away.”
At detention, Niall refused to let out a moan of pain, pushing his feet against Harry’s under the table as the twins work their lines, etching the letters into their skin over and over. It passed as the previous two have, however after two hours of writing the words
Draco nodded, looking curious, “I did,” he said. “What exactly was that, Blaise?”
“Ron!”
“You should imagine my surprise when I walked in to see a cute little boy in bed,” the redhead grinned, “Uh—you are my roommate right? Not just a random high school freshmen who came in here for a nap?”
“Do you have any suitors?” Mrs. Malfoy asked. “Since the emergence of your second gender, has any Alpha approached you for mating?”
The train leaves in half an hour. But they had time. There were always the last-minute families running for the train, this was normal.
“Very well,” Scrimgeour said grimly. “Though I still have doubt that Harry Potter can simply stumble his way onto Malfoy’s property, as well as being kidnapped and placed into the Potter’s care.”
“Excuse me!”
“It means we’re different!” Harry grinned. “We’re wizards!”
Harry smiled in response. Draco’s hand drifted from his, and Harry watched as Draco turned and ran after in the direction the mist went. From behind him, however, he heard a crow’s caw and saw a second gathering of mist edging around the clearing. “Look at that! The witch-warlock is in love!”
“What does all this have to do with what the papers say?” Parvati asked.
Harry met with Draco outside of Professor McGonagall’s office. They smiled as a greeting and Harry knocked on the office door as Draco wrapped an arm loosely around his shoulders. “Come in,” Professor McGonagall called out, the door opening by itself.
“Ohh,” Harry said, starting to completely understand his situation. “But why do Betas try to use it? Ron told me his brothers tried to use the potion.”
“Yes ma’am,” Harry said as he followed Madam Pomfrey. She led him away from the seventh floor towards the marble staircase where they climbed down towards the fifth floor. On the landing, she opened a door to their left and walked in. “Now, you will eat what you can during, but do not force yourself. There are some Omegas who cannot stand even the sight of food during their heat and eat vigorously afterward. So if you feel you are not hungry at all, just leave the plate where it is, and it will vanish in an hour.”
Harry smiled, and he gave Voldemort back his wand. “Father, would you prefer tea or coffee today?” he asked.
“Yup! He came to me last night,” Harry smiled.
“Blaise!” Harry gasped. “You’re ok!”
“Ahh,” the shopkeeper smirked, “I know just what you need. Human?”
“Do that and I’ll throw you out of my nest,” Harry warned. Niall opened his mouth to respond but had nothing to say. He just took the dragon and scented it with his wrists and neck and gave it back to Harry. The omega snuggled with it and smiled, “Thank you for being a useful Alpha, Niall,” he said sticking out his tongue. Niall just crossed his arms and grumbled.
Another signal, and they were off!
Mrs. Riddle silently stepped towards Mr. Riddle and the two began dancing, moving in a circle motion, their bodies pressed hotly close together. Mr. Riddle led as they twirled and spun, stepped one side than the next, Mrs. Riddle lowered herself onto Mr. Riddle before sliding back up, in each move that was possible, Mrs. Riddle somehow shown her submission to Mr. Riddle that made Harry feel uneasy. There was something quite unnatural about the way they moved. When the couple was done, Mr. Riddle went over the steps again before the teens tried it for themselves.
“Then how are we supposed to explain it? I don’t think the ‘we’ll tell you when you’re older’ trick is going to work,” Sirius muttered. “Besides, he already knows that Harry will be able to get pregnant when he’s older.”
and Theo’s body started to slowly rise, his arms and legs hanging down. “Damn it,” Draco whispered. He moved his wand, and with it, Theo’s sleeping body, upwards towards the pillows. When he was in place, Draco slowly moved his wand down, stepping towards Theo so he can hold his arms out of the way, so he did not land on them.
“Food is no problem! Mrs. Weasley taught me a spell that can easily restock pantries. That is, if I can have my wand back for a moment, please,” Harry said.
Sirius stood awkwardly. “That is partially my fault,” he muttered. “When your parents died, I was sent to Azkaban—a prison—for a crime I did not commit. I only gotten released last year and… it took a while to rehabilitate.”
“You shouldn’t have said that,” Ron frowned and left it at that.
“Oh, no worries,” Harry smiled, “you didn’t need to get me anything…”
he added mentally.
“Yes, the shemale.”
“We can fight back,” Niall yelled. “We can fight against her! Hex that bitch until she’s no more than a puddle of miserable, muttering goo!”
Decide
Divination
“Good weird,” Harry said.
“I do indeed,” Draco chuckled. He moved his hand to grab Harry’s neck gently and he pulled him in for a long, slow kiss, their lips and tongues dancing together as their faces are pressed, eyes closed and both boys forgotten to the rest of the world. There were soft moans that only made Blaise and Daphne glance at each other. Blaise cleared his throat loudly, getting the gays’ attention. Harry blushed while Draco just sat smugly, his arms wrapped possessively around Harry.
Niall clicked his tongue lightly and sighed, saying in Bulgarian,
“She’s actually on a good mood today,” Draco whispered back. Harry chuckled. Out of the corner of his eye he could see girls glaring at him, but he did his best to ignore it.
Harry opened the door for them when they reached the compartment and walked in only to feel a sour tension in the air. Draco followed in while Blaise stayed by the door. Everyone was silent, glaring at one person who was currently sitting in Harry’s seat. It was a girl with a piggish nose and long hair with split ends. She looked up to see them. “Potter! What the hell are you doing here?” she demanded.
“Certainly not all the coven,” Draco frowned, “Satan knows that there are those who hates our relationship—mostly because they’re blind hatred of Harry.”
“Hmm, as if I’d listen to a disgusting low—“ Mr. Malfoy’s words were cut off as Uncle Remus punched him with his free hand. Harry stared in pure shock, he had never seen his uncle act out like this.
Daphne moved closer to Harry and smiled, “So, tell me about it, how did you and Draco start dating?”
“Can I… can I ask you something?” Draco asked after five minutes of silent walking.
The coven stared at Harry, afraid of what happened. Snapping out of his daze, Lord Voldemort turned from the tree to Harry. “Your hand,” he said in a snappish voice. Harry slowly lifted it up and Voldemort examined it in the firelight. He looked at the goat and his eyes widened. Harry turned towards the goat as well and gasped to see that the black goat’s horns were gone! “This can’t be… it’s impossible,” Voldemort whispered. He looked at the goat’s hornless body then back at Harry’s hand. His own fingers brushed against Harry’s hand, slowly, methodically, as if he was trying to rub off the ink that made the two horns. But it was impossible, it was as though the tattoo of the two horns were part of Harry’s skin itself.
Draco’s cheeks turned rosy and he glanced down at his lap. Was everyone in New York so brash about their sexuality? He knew from experience in L.A. that California was pretty open and progressive, hell people would sometimes date or kiss the same gender just to look good to any camera that looked their way, but still, Draco found it hard to be totally open. Especially after Theo—no, no don’t think of that. This is a new day! A new life for Draco Malfoy! And he was determined to not let his past hold him back!
“It’s urgent, apparently,” the stone gargoyle said snidely.
“I’m sorry Ron,” he laughed, “but as much as I like Charlie, I’m dating Draco.”
Forced Transfers
“Oh, well in that case why not come out with me tonight?” Ron asked. Draco stared at him, shocked at the question. Ron just grinned and said, “There’s a party being thrown by the athletes, and my friends are going to be there! Come on, it’ll be fun!”
“I’m sure you did not,” Mrs. Malfoy smiled. She looked around for a second, “From the sounds of it, you must be very knowledgeable with flowers.”
“Tom? Are you okay?” Remus asked, obviously worried. “What are you talking about?”
“We’ve done everything—everything! I fricking bled for the summoning!” Harry cried out. “And we didn’t even get Lucifer!”
Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy were silent. “Good,” Blaise said. “Now…” he walked back towards them, Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy sinking further into their chairs as Blaise turned back into his regular form, still in his leather straps. “My father chose Harry to become his wife. That is something that is obviously we do not want, so myself, Draco, and Harry plan to marry instead, using our wedding as a trap to trick and subdue my father.”
“Is that so?” Lilith said slowly, “My… to think so many of our kind wishes to go against our Lord’s wishes… why it sounds almost as though you are all planning a coup.”
Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and threw it over him. He left the room carefully and made sure the door was closed just as it was before with the quill holding it barely open. He looked around, seeing no one else, and snuck out. Using secret passageways, Harry quickly made it to the seventh floor and when he reached the Room of Requirement’s corridor, he ran through three times before walking into the door.
“Fred!” Mrs. Weasley yelled, giving him a sharp glare.
the snake hissed.
“Out,” Harry said. “I need to be alone—to think.” Ron too looked as though he wanted to say something but remained silent. Looking like a hurt puppy, the Weasley left the bedroom, closing the door behind him.
“Honestly both of you need to stop,” Hermione hissed at them. “She’s wrong and evil but—we can’t get into more trouble than we already are!”
“Hey mate, that’s great,” he smiled. “And congratulations again, really.”
He led Harry into a long room where an old tapestry was hung on the wall. “We tried taking it off, figures the old bat placed a Permanent Sticking Charm on it too,” Sirius said. “Kreacher tries at every turn to keep us from throwing the bloody thing out, even when I tried giving it a knife it wouldn’t budge.”
“The Minister will give you those letters by the end of the week,” Mr. Malfoy said loudly, earning him applause. He raised his hand lazily in acknowledgment. “I will help you myself, Minister if you will?” he gestured for the Minister to exit, and he left the table, his lawyers following after.
Ron’s face went red and he immediately glared at Draco as he became lost for words. Hermione huffed and crossed her arms while Harry glanced around awkwardly. Draco saw their faces and smirked, “Did she leave you after five minutes, Weasley?” he chuckled.
“With no help from Dumbledore,” Remus muttered.
This is
“Okay but nervous,” Harry answered honestly. “Um, Remus… how are you?”
“In their rooms,” Mrs. Weasley said, “this isn’t something they really should hear about.”
“Good, then come here,” Draco said. He opened the collar and slowly put the collar on Harry’s neck. It fitted perfectly. The leather hugged Harry’s neck cozily, sitting directly in the middle of his neck with the buckle facing Draco. Draco examined Harry’s neck slowly, gazing at it from every angle. “Pull your collars up,” he said. Harry did so, barely covering the collar. Draco nodded as this and stepped closer, pulling Harry’s shirt down until he could see his full collar and nape, licking at his scar. He rested his head on Harry’s shoulder and stared at the collar. A slight frown forming. “No, no, no this won’t do,” he muttered.
They moved to Harry’s bed so that the boy can be on all fours. Still sucking Blaise’s cock, his ass was up and available for Draco as he spread the cheeks to reveal a pink tight hole. Without even thinking, he leaned down and gave a long lick across the hole before burying his face, licking and biting at the hole like the novice he is. Still, it gave Harry pleasure and he moaned along Blaise’s cock. The demon grabbed Harry’s head and kept it still as he took control, thrusting his cock in and out slowly, going deeper each time until Harry gagged and sputtered.
The sun rose hazily onto the Burrow. Harry woke up with a yawn, his body back to its new normal. There was no fur, no claws. Only his pale skin and developed toned muscles. It was just like any other morning. He got out of his bed, dressed, brushed his teeth in the bathroom and made his way down to the kitchen where Mrs. Weasley was already up cooking. “Harry! I didn’t expect you to be up so early,” she said. “How are you feeling?”
Voldemort patted Harry’s shoulder, and they left. It was late, Harry realized they practiced through lunch, and after a short dinner the House-elves made them, Voldemort led Harry once more to the reading room where Harry first entered. “Here,” Voldemort handed Harry a book titled
The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry …and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snake’s with slits for nostrils…
“Home, so we can go see your old Alpha,” Draco said. He tapped his finger against the portkey around their neck, and they both disappeared.
“Getting my collar doesn’t count,” Theo pouted. “Nor does us raiding the Hogwarts kitchen!” Harry chuckled and shook his head as the two bickered. He felt something near him and turned to see his Alpha walking towards them.
Outside, everything was ready. By the knotted tree, a veil had formed, separating it and the rest of the world. The chairs set outside were wooden and old looking, as though they have grown out of the ground itself, vines and leaves decorating the trim and arms. About half the town filled the place, which surprised Harry as he never thought anybody would show. He never attended anyone’s Initiation, so why would they?
The Slytherins around them nodded, while Pansy continued to glare. Harry returned the glare then looked at his Alpha, an idea forming. “You know Alpha, my father gave me a very interesting task,” he purred. “Can I please sleep with you tonight so I can do it?” Pansy made a disgusted noise and stood up, moving down the table. Her spot was quickly taken by Daphne.
“He said it was for the best,” Remus muttered. He took another large gulp and refilled his cup. “When the papers came out, he called us all together—and told us it would be best if we don’t get involved.”
“Such a vulgar, disrespectful child,” Yaxley said. Draco ignored him and continued his way. He heard footsteps following him and did not even need to look back to know that Yaxley was following him. He continued to ignore Yaxley as he went into the first shop, Mr. Mulpepper’s Apothecary.
Nobody waited for him as he stepped out, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley only a second behind him. She had him sort out the schoolbooks as she immediately began cooking dinner. When he was done, Harry took his, Ron’s, and Hermione’s schoolbooks and looked for his friends. He found them outside and still felt that awkward tension between them. Ron sniffed and gave Harry a cheeky smile, “You reek of Malfoy even more now, mate,” he said.
“No, I haven’t,” Harry said, “Dad and I spent the summer at the Malfoys.”
“Yeah, I rather not let that out,” Harry nodded. “And this changes nothing between us?” he asked.
“I can—”
Harry nodded and went to the same seat he collapsed in an hour earlier, which now had a bundle of robes folded onto it. He took it and placed it on his lap. “And you—get out you idiot!” Voldemort spat at the house elf who whimpered and scurried away.
Near the end of November, Uncle Sirius and Mr. Malfoy sat with the boys to start to go over seating arrangement both during the ceremony and afterwards. “Now, I believe we should leave a space for the Dark Lord up front obviously,” Uncle Sirius said, “however I do not know whom he should sit with.”
“Course not, I was taught otherwise, and I eat in front of Draco Malfoy! You imagine how much of a priss he’ll be if he actually sees me enjoying food?” Daphne laughed. “He’s my friend, and I get that he’s an Alpha but I rather he spends all that manners energy on Harry while I’m trying to just enjoy my damn breakfast.” Ron laughed loudly as he grinned.
“This is way more than I thought you would make, Malfoy, damn!” Ron grinned. “What’s this?” he pointed to a loaf of bread.
“Your dad!” He’s been bitten, it’s serious, there was blood everywhere…”
He was starting to feel tense. He squeezed Blaise’s hand reflexively, and Blaise squeezed back, offering some relief as Harry turned back to Mr. Riddle.
“I don’t want them,” Harry laughed.
“I need to see what exactly happened to me,” he muttered, and with that thought in mind, he dressed in his clothes, which felt constricting, and his robe. “But first I need new clothes.” With his objectives in mind, Draco left his room and left the Leaky Cauldron into Diagon Alley.
“Mr. Riddle actually approves all subjects we learn in the Academy,” Draco said.
“Do you like this, Harry?” Draco teased.
“It’s not your fault,” he said.
His cheeks immediately began to grow red as he followed Ron towards the back of the class. Harry was in the corner, so there was one seat next to him available. He gave a thankful sigh when he saw Ron automatically going for it. Harry looked up immediately and looked past Ron to Draco. He gave an impish smile and said, “Draco! Sit next to me, there’s a spot open.”
“I don’t like her,” Harry whispered to Blaise and Draco.
He followed the couple downstairs where his mother shrieked and hugged him tightly, “My Viktor!” she shrieked before babbling in Bulgarian.
“Who’s your boyfriend?” Ron asked, “Why haven’t you told Hermione and me about him? I mean… we’re not judgey… are we?” he said, looking at Hermione hesitantly, “I’m not,” he added.
“What I mean is that while the girls all have some dignity with the dresses… mine seems to bring thoughts of, uhh, sex, sir. Seduction,” Harry explained, his face heating up.
“I’m good at nothing!” Ron burst out. “I’m not even good at bloody Quidditch when everyone in my family is!”
Voldemort thought for a moment. “Today is the seventh of September,” he said, talking aloud as he thought through the timeline. “I had wanted to step into the light about our relationship and Dumbledore’s wrongdoings in October after I’ve collected enough evidence, however from what I have right now, it should be enough just to get people suspicious of the old man. Draco, your father still has his connections in the Daily Prophet, I assume?”
“And?”
The class was quiet as it entered the room and as Harry said, he dragged Niall to two seats in the back corner with Harry by the window. Draco Malfoy moved to intercept, but Harry saw Blaise sat down next to Niall and smiled, offering his hand. Niall glanced at Harry, who gave a small shrug, and Niall shook it. Malfoy instead moved to sit right in front of Harry so that the boy was forced to look at him.
“And take another Blood-Replenishing Potion, I took more than half a liter,” Voldemort said. Harry stumbled when he stood and took cautious steps towards the cabinet full of Blood-Replenishing Potions. He took one and left, and his feet took him automatically around Malfoy Manor. He found stairs and before he realized it, he was once again in Draco’s room.
“Please,” Neville whined. “C-Can you kiss me again?”
“H-Harrison? But Dumbledore said that it’s for Harry—”
Harry blinked, “My dad brought you?” he whispered.
Harry frowned. He did not like being dismissed so emotionlessly. He moved away from his father and the wedding plans, when an idea move into his head. His father and Mrs. Malfoy were planning a wedding ceremony full of people Harry hated, and as he and his father just talked about, wanted to kill. No, will kill Harry reminded himself, the grim reality of his words not yet setting into him. So, why not hold a ceremony just for him and Draco? Where the people he wanted to be there would be there, and those who don’t will not?
His eyes darted to the corner where he saw pairs of red eyes. “Let’s hope Moody can’t see you,” he muttered. “You have my lord’s response?”
They reached the Whomping Willow and Harry automatically went to pick up a long stick, jabbing it at the root that will cause the tree to still. Madam Pomfrey stared at him for a moment before shaking her head, forgetting who she was dealing with. “Professor Dumbledore will be back for you by morning,” she said.
“Well us, of course, along with Ron, Hermione, and Daphne,” Blaise shrugged.
“Hermione told me that too,” Ginny said. Harry shuffled awkwardly.
“Oh god, that’s horrible,” Theo said, scrunching his nose. “But it’s just lines… right?”
Harry thought as Draco’s eyes glanced from him to Voldemort. Harry turned as well,
Harry flinched at the accusation. He looked at Krum’s parents and said desperately,
“I did! But your letters never mentioned or replied, and then they stopped,” Viktor said. “You never replied.” Harry blinked, what was he talking about? He never got any letters from Viktor.
His hair was a darker blond than Harry remembered. It was neatly styled reaching his ears. It was Draco’s eyes, however, that caused Harry to become speechless. Pure silver interrupted only by the black iris in his eyes. They stared at Harry not out of hatred, but curiosity.
“What—what lesson was that, my lord?” Rabastan Lestrange asked fearfully. Voldemort stared at the man, his nose sniffing under his glamour.
Harry leaned over towards Draco and sighed, “I never realized how misogynistic our coven is.”
“Even so, after I helped you with your clothes, you did not change,” Kingsley said. “We don’t know why.”
A man of pure beauty with ebony skin and fire-like eyes. Harry could not describe him physically. Only that he knew who the man was in an instant, and the man’s handsomeness and beauty had no comparison or parallel. Harry’s heart felt corrupted and smitten for all but a second until the man, his Dark Lord, disappeared from view, but his presence was felt by Harry. Shaking, he looked at the others, to see that they only were staring at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” Draco nodded, he stopped and frowned, “You know, I never really learned the name of the café.”
“Absolutely not!”
The matter was quickly brushed aside, and breakfast continued on. When the three were done, Ron and Hermione waited outside in the entrance hall as Harry goes to the Slytherin Table to get his Alpha. “Good morning, my pretty boywife, shall we go?” Draco chuckled.
“Ohh,” Hermione said.
“Yeah, but he’s skinny, attractive,” Neville muttered. “I’m not.”
he said.
Harry thought to himself. He and Blaise looked at each other, smiling softly. They began to lean forward and, like for every kiss in his life, Harry’s eyes slowly closed, wanting to fully embrace every sensation Blaise’s lips can offer. They were centimeters away when he felt it. It was subtle, so soft that it could be mistaken for a breath, however Harry still felt it. A breeze pushing pass, just as their lips were about to touch. Harry opened his eyes.
Umbridge started to deflate. Her skin returned to her normal color, and she no longer croaked. However, she still glared angrily at Harry and immediately raised her hand, slapping the omega. Her ring dug into his skin, causing a little cut on his cheek. Harry stood his ground and gave her a cold look. “Detention, with me, for a month, Mr. Potter,” she seethed. “You will not act like a savage in front of me, I will show you respect.”
“Oh,” Harry said. Draco pushed the book towards him, and Harry felt the book in his hands. It felt heavy, Harry found his hands trembling slightly. Not from fear, but from a sick excitement. He opened the cover slowly, doing his best to hide his smile. The pages felt good, they were old, yellowish, but still the words printed were in perfect condition. He was quickly absorbed in the book, leafing through the pages and skimming its contents. There were so many different potions and poisons. Poisons that killed instantly, that given various deadly illnesses, freezes the heart, fill the lungs with toxic… so many deadly poisons and each with a detailed picture description. Harry looked through them all, his excitement mixing with disgust. At some point a drink appeared next to Harry, which turned out to be hot chocolate.
Oblivious to misty eyes watching him, Harry gave the twisted, perverted tree that will be the sight of his Dark Initiation one last look, before turning back and walking to his home.
a small voice in the back of Harry’s mind said. He nodded but something felt off, “Why Charlie?” he asked, “Couldn’t Percy do that?”
“Then why did you take me to the Yule Ball instead of him?” Parvati asked.
“My husband is very lucky to have such a handsome man like me,” Draco proclaimed. “And I know that if he was here now, he would punch you for daring to suggest that I am nothing but perfect.”
“What is it?” Draco asked as Harry opened the letter, reading it.
“No matter, you will do,” Voldemort said. “Come.” Harry did not know how to feel, he had just gotten use to the idea of Voldemort being his father but seeing him so casually… and doing something normal humans do, it the scariest thing Harry has ever witness in his life. He walked slowly, not even saying hello to Mrs. Malfoy until he was right against them, and even then it was curt as he had no past experience with the woman.
Voldemort smirked down at the man. “Yes, Travers, it is me,” the Dark Lord said. He looked back at Harry, “Do you know who this man is?”
“Harry! Harry!”
“You... you love me?” Ron asked blankly, staring at Theo with a strange look.
“Hmm… men is it, powerful men… even though you have power that you are too scared to use… power that…” Voldemort’s lips curled and Harry felt a hateful shiver go down his back. “Harry Potter… you do not have to die here, tied to my father’s grave. I can see your darkness, boy. I can see your willingness to submit… and your hunger to learn. I can help you there, Harry. I can show you the beauty in the shadows… the power in the darkness. Follow Dumbledore’s path, and you will never have
“Where are we going?” Harry asked, his voice strained from crying.
Sirius hummed and thought for a moment. “As much as I hate it, the Black name has some sway in Durmstrang, that will most likely be the easier school to get the boys into.”
“Yes ma’am,” Harry nodded.
“Yes and if you do not mind, Fleur, I need to talk to Harry about his bite,” Mrs. Weasley said. Fleur and her shared a strange look.
“Which is what?” Harry asked.
Yaxley went silent. “I figured that I would be more useful... for our Lord... if I remained outside of prison cells,” he said after a long tense moment, which he filled by drinking from his teacup and refilling it twice.
“No,” Harry said, “I will take up my father’s duty, and become the Dark Lord. However, I think I’ll try a different method from yours.”
“Not me, Harry,” Theo shrugged, pointing to Harry. “Now either get in and shut up or walk away angrily like those two. I’m sure there’s still a compartment left, but it’ll smell bad with them.”
“IF YOU TELL ME TO KEEP BREATHING ONE MORE TIME I’M GOING TO TAKE YOUR BALLS AND AHHHHH!” Lily screamed.
“Yeah,” Draco nodded.
“You know what to do, Mr. Potters,” Umbridge said, smiling sweetly over at them.
Cedric looked between the two twins, “I am bisexual,” he said. The twins smiled at this, “and single,” he added. “Cho and I… we just didn’t work out.”
Every part of his instinct yelled at him to protect Harry. To coddle him and heal his wounds before running off to making Umbridge’s life extremely miserable. But he knew in the back of his mind that he had to wait. If he were to act now, it would only drive Harry away. So he waited. He was there. He gave Harry tea and parfaits and subtly a napkin to help with his hand. He did not mention the hand nor the blood, he did not stare at it, and he did not draw attention or ask Harry what was happening in the detentions. Harry will tell him when he was ready. Draco had to believe that, and so a week passed.
