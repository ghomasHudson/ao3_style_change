"Are you all right?" Potter reached for Draco hesitantly. When Draco let him approach, Potter sat beside him. Draco was staring forward with empty eyes. He wanted his mother. As he felt Potter's left arm timidly wrap itself around his shoulders and pull him close, Draco didn't resist the urge to drop his head onto the Gryffindor's shoulder.
. But that wasn't counted. They were common students, expected to be slow at casting such a high enchantment. But he was Draco Malfoy, always the best and fastest of all. They'd been through half the class period and Draco still couldn't conjure anything. Sweat trailed down his face. He started to panic, but he wouldn't show it on his face. What if he couldn't cast the charm? In frustration, Draco threw his wand hand down to his side, clenching his jaw and looking down with cold eyes.
Should he give up his life dream just because of the fact that he possibly wouldn't ever have a wand to use again.? No wand masters wanted to give him wand. Malfoy's name was banned from wand shops of the Wizarding world.
"Just, let me try, Potter. Please." Draco stared at Potter's emerald eyes. A Malfoy never said please and Potter knew it. He hoped Potter could see his desperation and would give him a chance to try it.
At dinnertime that night, Draco got a letter from his parents, updating him about the captured ex-Death Eaters. Draco still felt uneasy with all this, but he reassured himself with the fact that her mother had her wand back and that he had ordered the manor's house-elves to paid attention to his parents' safety. Draco looked up from his letter and saw Potter was saying something to Granger. The bushy haired girl looked at him oddly.
"Oh, no. She's fine. We just talked about…stuff. About Hogwarts, Grimmauld Place." Then Potter added in a very low voice, "Me, you."
Draco's proposal was followed by a horror scream from Lucius who was just stepped into the Receiving Room. Harry turned his head toward the senior Malfoy and Draco was so shocked by the sudden and unnoticed visit that he froze in their inappropriate pose. Narcissa appeared beside her husband and glanced at him amusingly.
"The ward let you in because of the ring!" Draco hissed and let go of Potter. "What I do with you now?"
"Draco…oh gods…nnnhhhh…I…I…oh gods, Draco! Ahhh!" Harry tensed and then he came, pouring his honey to their flushed skins. Muscle clenched tightly as he climaxed, bringing Draco to the edge and came almost simultaneously.
"Looking for this, Malfoy?" A seventh year boy stood in front of the class, holding his bag. Behind him were two others. Slytherins.
"Bloody hell!" Draco turned his head toward the Gryffindor table and his eyes met Potter's. He walked quickly back to the doors.
Great. Now he was locked in the class, totally petrified. The class would be in use again Thursday noon. That meant he had to wait for two days until someone freed him. Unless his junior's spell wasn't strong enough would he be freed of the spell's effect in an hour.
"You did it again. So, can you, Potter, fix my wand? Are you positive my mother's wand can be fixed?" Draco asked. "Look, Potter, I know this isn't your fault at all. But I just…" Draco bit his bottom lip, staring at Potter's emerald eyes, pleading him. And then Draco's eyes fell down below Potter's face. A green cashmere scarf was wrapped loosely around Potter's neck, covering the Gryffindor's chin. Potter followed his gaze and when his eyes fell to the blond's scarf, he gasped.
Draco followed behind, still confused as to what in Merlin's name he thought he'd been doing just now.
"Well, Mr. Harper. I suggest you master the charm first before taunting others. And I suggest you clear off your cruddy mind before casting the spell. A dull light is not good, Harper. Continue, class!" Dakarrt clapped his hands and the class soon resumed the lesson. Some mocking giggles from other houses were heard around the class, causing Harper to turn as red as a tomato.
The next morning Draco woke up facing the wall. When he tried to stretch, his back touched something solid and warm. Draco snapped his head to see what was behind him, and found Potter's back.
"Oh, right." Draco remembered the distrust of the Malfoy name still instilled in the Wizarding Britain.
"Fuck the wait! I've been waiting for too long. So I won't pass this chance to have you. Draco, I. Want. You."
They both had talked about Quidditch, Muggle football, potions; Draco had even updated Potter with all the gossips around Hogwarts he got from Peeves the Poltergeist. They were quite tired now. Two boxes of assortments had been consumed within those hours.
"Hi, Malfoy. Um, can I come in?" Potter looked to his side, looking very ready to step into Draco's room.
"It's all right. You're awake now." Draco held the boy, trying to comfort him. He didn't tell Potter that it was just a dream again, because Draco knew it wasn't. From the boy's state, the nightmare seemed more like a memory, or a reflection of the loneliness that was Harry Potter.
"This morning Shacklebolt sent me Auror application form to Grimauld Place. He sent one to Ron, too. He said we don't have to take the test and are welcomed to join the Auror training straight." Harry said below Draco, buried his face into Draco's neck.
It was about an hour past bed time and Potter hadn't joint him in his bed yet. Draco stood up and entered the White Room. Potter was lying in the bed.
"Being trapped in the Manor for a year has definitely corrupted your mind, mother, if you're befriending Potter now." Draco saw his father smirk at his words.
This Friday, though, Harper once again contributed to Draco's stress. In class the professor had decided to see the students' progression on the charm. Draco wasn't in a good enough mood to do the charm, so he decided to lean against the wall and just watch other students struggle. He tried to be make himself invisible, but of course, Harper easily spotted him.
After a brief talk with his father about the vanished Dark Mark on his arm, Draco and his parents enjoyed their dinner in the master dining room. When the desserts were laid out on the dining table, they felt the Manor's ward vibrate.
Draco could feel the tense in Potter's hand. Whether because he was afraid Draco would be angry and would deny his relationship with him, or because he was scared that his friends wouldn't approve of them, he wasn't sure. Draco decided to relieve Potter from his fears by asking Granger and Weasel about it. Not that he needed their approval.
"Malfoy! Merlin, don't surprise people inside the castle!" Potter put his hand against his chest. This side of Hogwarts castle was novel for him. Who knew what kind of trick the castle had for students.
"Here is the letter, Master Draco. Is master Draco needs anything else from Tippy?" The house-elf goggled him.
Draco opened his eyes and jolted up. The sudden movement was paused mid air when Draco noticed something beside him. The blond turned his head to his right side. Harry Potter was lying on the bed, sleeping. The Gryffindor's hand was gripping Draco's right arm tight and his leg was thrown over Draco's thigh.
, leave the detention and transfer eighty points from Gryffindor to Slytherin." Draco heard protests from the Gryffindors, especially from the Weasleys. None came from Potter.
"All right." Draco released his grip on Potter. Once again, he caught Potter flushing and biting his lip.
Right as Draco's lips left Potter's skin, a knock on the door was heard. The next sound was Granger's voice called out. The two boys stared at each other.
"Mr. Malfoy, hold your step!" McGonagall called him from the staff's table. Draco turned to see the headmistress walking toward him. "Follow me, Mr. Malfoy." McGonagall walked out of the Great Hall, Draco following closely. When they were outside the Great Hall, the headmistress stopped and turned to talk to him.
Salazar! Harry Potter had been a constant presence in Draco's thoughts – for the last seven and a half years.
Draco loved numbers. They were absolute truth in the universe. Despite his sadness for the broken wand, he enjoyed the Advanced Arithmancy class very much that day.
He wrote to his father asking about the progress of his planning and plotting in taking over the Malfoy estate from the Ministry. His father had transferred all of his assets to Draco's name during the war so the Ministry couldn't seize them. But the Ministry hadn't given up in seeking a way to take control of the Malfoys' funds yet, and were using his father's condition as an open opportunity. And as he was of legal age now, Draco had full possession of the Malfoys' power to save their belongings from the corrupted Ministry staffs. And now he had to struggle alone, making correspondence with his solicitors to make sure his plans worked as he wanted.
"Dunno. Never saw it like that before. There, Tenebrus, we have to go now." Potter patted the beast but it wouldn't go away. "Uh, I think it likes you."
The dark wizard with his wand on Draco grabbed him and then the four intruders began to Apparate, with Draco siding-along. But they couldn't Apparate because of the manor's wards.
"Er…guess I fell asleep when I waited for you to wake…Ah! What time is it now?" Potter jumped out of Draco's bed and took his wand from beneath another bed's pillow.
"Mm…no. I didn't bring one to Grimmauld Place. Have plenty enough clothes there." Potter purred at the stroking on his hair.
"I can borrow my father's wand." Draco stared down at the emerald eyes. He noticed that they were only several inches below his. So the dark-haired boy had grown now. Potter's view line which had been on his pointy chin was now level with Draco's mouth.
"Let go!" Draco tried to free his arm from the dark wizard's grip. At that moment, the spell binding the petrified house-elf broke, overridden by the elf's powerful magic.
"But it happened to Hermione and Ron. They couldn't have been pretending that I hurt them." Potter lifted his head abruptly. "I'm…damn it! I can't control my magic when I'm mad. It's leaking out from me. I hate this stupid magic! No matter what, I always cause harm to everyone around me. Why does this all have to happen to me? I just want to be normal! I'm tired, Malfoy. I've had enough." Tears were threatening to fall from Potter's emerald eyes again.
"Fine!" And Potter waited until Draco dropped all the three pieces of his broken wand from the pouch to the ground. "
Both boys entwined together. Bodies were dancing like snakes, bending against each other. Moans and gasps echoed alternatively between kisses and frictions. Naturally, in brief moment the acts built physical reactions; a result of pent-up emotions they'd repressed for too long. Draco manoeuvred their bodies so he was now hovering Harry.
Potter avoided Draco's eyes by running his own emerald gaze along the gloomy corridor. Studying the new side of Hogwarts castle where they – the Eighth years – were provided with living quarters.
"W-what…? Are you afraid?" Draco fell to his knees. "Oh poor you, don't worry I'm not leaving you. Just fetching Hagrid for you, all right?" Draco stroked the Unicorn's body.
"Tenebrus, will you get your head off of me? I need to go to the castle." Draco patted the Thestral's head from below hesitantly.
Draco sighed and walked into the Secretus Prisma, where the sixteen students of the Eighth year lived. He couldn't talk to Potter about it in their common room without risking being heard by the rest of the Eighth-years.
Potter was still looking into Draco's eyes with his frightened ones. Draco wasn't sure if the boy was fully conscious and aware that he had awoken, or if his mind still lingered in the nightmare. Oh, bugger the animosity, Draco pulled the trembling boy into his embrace. Instantly Potter encircled Draco's neck and buried his face deeply into it, still sobbing with labored breaths.
It was the second week of the Easter holidays in April of the year. Draco was burning a book in his room's fireplace. During the first day of the holiday, Draco had written letters to Blaise and Pansy about Hogwarts and his progression on his potions formula. Draco also wrote them complaints about how insufferable Potter was during their Eight year. Instead of telling him about Durmstrang and Beauxbatons, in return Blaise and Pansy Owled him a copy of the Male Lovers Guide and told him to practice the book with Potter. At first Draco had wanted to throw the book straight to the fire, but curiosity could kill the dragon, too, as Pansy had said once. So he'd kept the book and this afternoon he had just finished reading it, his face burning. He hoped his face would have returned to its usual paleness when he attended dinner with his parents that night. He made a mental note to give his two friends filthy retribution someday.
The gleam on Potter's eyes soon faded as Draco opened the box. Draco didn't like that look on Potter's face. He didn't want to disappoint him.
"Um, sleeping?" Potter opened his eyes, staring back at Draco who was holding himself back trying not to hit the boy in the head.
"Nothing. Just said ex-Death Eaters attacked the manor. That's all." Potter averted his eyes. "And, er, a bit about the house-elves."
"Of course it can't. Don't want a chance of him losing it. Now, if that's all, I have something important to do." Draco left the common room toward the Quidditch pitch, and figured that he didn't need Peeves' help anymore.
"What? No. No, Ron decided to join Hermione in her room." Potter tilted his head, watching the blond cautiously. There was some sort of emptiness in Potter's voice.
"You're not alone, Harry. Well, not anymore now." Draco kissed the boy sweetly. "I know you live alone at Grimauld Place. Look, Harry, I have the whole left wing of the manor to my own. And after living for seven years at Hogwarts dorm with loads of annoying companion every single day, I kind of…feel…it's uh…" Draco was well trained in diplomacy and negotiation. Why the bloody hell was it so difficult for him to tell Harry what he wanted?
"Try again." Potter walked behind him and put his hands on Draco's shoulders gently. "Relax. Concentrate. Think about a happy memory. Let it fill your mind first."
Draco liked the feeling of kissing Potter. He could say that he was addicted to Potter. There was this funny but pleasant sensation flowing through his body when his lips touched Potter's. And then when Potter slipped his arm around his neck and the other hand through his hair, like now, Draco's mind was focused on those seductive touches. Also when he explored Potter's mouth and sucked his tongue, it felt like he was drinking Superior Red wine. He could have done this forever if he hadn't remembered that they were supposed to be returning to Hogwarts. Reluctantly Draco broke the kiss. He looked deep into the emerald eyes before giving Potter one last brief kiss and then released him.
"Good. No Thestral or Unicorn." Draco pulled out his wand from beneath his sleeve. Gathered all his concentration and required memories, Draco began to practice the Patronus Charm. He wouldn't stop until he succeeded to cast an incorporeal
"This, your stare, your question, your frantic actions. The…magic." Draco spoke the last word cautiously. A long pause, and then Potter spoke.
"P-Potter! Why does it keep doing that to me? Get it off of me!" Draco stuttered. He didn't want the same thing that had involved a hippogriff in his third year to repeat here.
"Oh Draco, I'm sure we will be all right. I have my wand now." Her mother held his arm. "Will you be back here before you return to Hogwarts?"
It was four sharp and the class was over. Draco tidied his parchments, quill, ink and the book then reached down for his dragon leather bag, only to find nothing. He looked down, searching for his bag. He was sure he'd put it just beside his bench. He looked around his desk but couldn't find it.
"Um…" And finally Draco realized that his arms had been holding Potter the whole time. He hadn't mean to and hadn't actually realized it. Draco detached himself from Potter, arms dropping to his sides.
"Yeah. Of course you are." Potter laughed. Damn Merlin if that didn't make Draco relieved and warm inside. Draco cleared his throat. He hoped he didn't blush.
"They're here!" Draco pulled out his mother's wand and ran into the wide driveway. He stopped and turned back when he heard Potter's yell.
"I thought you shared a room with Weasley?" Draco had noted it the day they were attributed the chambers; Potter had been paired with Weasel. Draco gratefully enjoyed his room alone, with no male student left for a roommate.
As he arrived at Hogwarts, Draco walked straight to the headmistress' office and told her about his activity of the day, and of the next. Though he had been checked up by the Head of Aurors and the Unspeakables and was protected against the effects of the dark artefacts, he wanted to make sure he didn't bring any harm to Hogwarts and asked the headmistress to check him again. After they were both certain he was clear from any dark magic, Draco visited the Great Hall for dinner. He was glad to find the students were so busy talking about their visit to Hogsmeade that yesterday's issue didn't arise. He spotted Potter at the Gryffindor table, looking agitated. What now, Draco asked himself mentally. Returning to his plate, Draco ate his dinner with intent; he'd spent so much energy at the manor without break that now he was starving.
Potter replied to Draco's words with a rustle of parchment. Draco looked to his right and saw Potter was preparing a parchment and a quill.
Draco was between wanting to kiss Potter because the boy seemed to treasure his scarf, and at the same time, wanting to break down in fury and run to the Gryffindor Tower and throw a nasty hex on the Weaselette. But his focus was on Potter. He had to calm him down again.
"Wear it. At least your neck won't get chilled out." Draco walked pass the still boy. Without looking back, he called, "Come on, Potter. I'm starving!" The blond heard a shuffling movement behind. He pulled a smirk as Potter appeared beside him. His soft scarf was twisted around Potter's neck.
Potter didn't say anything about it. Instead he asked for Draco's mother's wand. Draco handed Potter his wand back and he pulled out the wand from his pocket and gave it to Potter.
Draco didn't know what that was, but it felt really good. And he wanted to feel the sensation. He moved experimentally above Potter, but when he didn't get the effect he expected, Draco moved his body forward a bit until their hips were positioned at the same level, and then he tried to move again. This time he felt that pleasant sensation again. He heard Potter gasp. Draco looked down. What he saw added to his pleasure and to his desire for the boy beneath him. Potter was moaning, eyes closed, mouth open, face flushed. Draco lowered his head and planted a kiss to Potter's parted lips. The Gryffindor opened his eyes and stared up at Draco. Potter's hands stopped their movements and grabbed Draco's shoulders, pulling him down. When Draco had fully lain back against Potter, the dark-haired boy kissed him slowly and gently.
Saturday morning came and Draco forgot all about Hogsmeade. But that didn't matter anyway. He had planned to practice the Patronus Charm. He had to master it today! Or tomorrow at the latest. He had a lot of good childhood memories. Like, their parents reading him books before bed when he was toddler. Or when he got his first cauldron, a birthday gift from his father when he was seven. Or when he got his first broomstick and his father installed a Quidditch field at the back of the manor for him.
The whole day, Draco and Potter tried hard not to see each other. Everyone who saw them would think that they were having a second Cold War. Ignoring each other, just like the old days. Only the Draco and Potter themselves knew that the real reason they were avoiding each other was none other than the awkwardness they felt involving that morning's event in a bed.
They spent another few seconds blinking stupidly at each other. Then Potter's face lit up, and he cupped Draco's face and brought it down against his own and claimed Draco's lips in a quick hard press.
"What what, Harry? We're not that clueless, you know. What with you sneaking into his room all the time." Weasel rolled his eyes.
"But, mother…" Draco reflexively hid his right hand behind him. He couldn't give it to Potter – it was meant for his intended.
The Eighth years were parked at the Secretus Prisma chambers on the West wing, halfway to the side of the fifth floor, near the staircase leading up to the Ravenclaw common room. The chambers consisted of twelve rooms with double four-poster beds with a personal bathroom each. Separated by a long cozy common room, the left side were the boys' chamber and the right side was the girls'.
Potter obediently slid the platinum ring back down. He studied Draco's face before saying, "Merlin, Draco. For a moment there I thought you looked panicked. What's wrong with having a wife in the future?"
When they arrived, the Ministry group was already gathered outside the gates and judging from the taps of feet, they'd been waiting since eight o'clock.
Passing the courtyard, he spotted Potter. The boy was talking with Ginny Weasley –whom Draco preferred to call Weaselette – and Potter looked annoyed. Maybe they were having a row. Draco continued his walk toward the chambers.
Draco woke up feeling sticky and exhausted, but it was all forgotten as he felt contentment. He opened his eyes and smiled. He lay on top of sleeping Harry, sticky with the boy's cum on his stomach and chest. The boy wrapped his arms around Draco. He nuzzled into Harry's neck and breathed Harry's scent and slowly Draco raised his pliable upper body up gracefully, using his right elbow as leverage. He looked down at sleeping Harry, bringing his hand up and caressing the boy's face in the most possibly tender fashion he could do. The tip of his index finger trailed on the line of Harry's face, through the eyebrows, down to nose, and then lingered on the red lips. That lips which had just been officially his new addiction over sweets. Harry's lips were the sweetest thing Draco had ever devoured. A wet tip of tongue lapped his finger and then pulled it into the hot cavern. Draco smiled at the mouth.
"Oh, Merlin, sorry! I was in hurry, I thought everybody has already left." Potter corrected his spectacles position and looked up.
"Out." Draco repeated, then walked to the door. Before he opened it, he called over his shoudler, "In case you want to go back to your room, I've charmed the door to let you in if you ever wanted to hide in here again." And Draco left his room to head toward the forest.
"No, I'm fine. But thank you, Malfoy. Um, see you tomorrow then?" Potter looked like he was considering Draco's offer at first.
When Draco invited Potter for breakfast, they were both sporting blushes on their faces. After breakfast, Draco gave the other boy a clean shirt because his mother wanted to meet them this morning. With the help of Tippy's tailoring spell, Draco's black shirt easily fit Potter's smaller body. They went to the Receiving Room where Draco's mother awaited.
"What the hell!" Draco pulled his arm away harshly. He saw the Weaselette's face turn red as she stood, stunned in place. Potter dragged her away from Draco and then walked back and stood beside him.
"Just go! Hurry, before the headmistress puts the castle on quarantine!" Potter encircled Draco's waist with his arms.
Draco sighed. New trouble. As if his problems with the ministry weren't enough. Ah, to think of it, he still hadn't touched the Malfoy Apothecary papers. They consumed a lot of time to study. But Draco didn't mind because he liked the apothecary.
"She refused to leave. Kept banging her head on my potions cabinet, broke some rare ingredient jars. Before she caused any more damage, I allowed her to stay at the manor and serve me." Draco left out the part where his father punished him because of that and he didn't get ingredient supply for a month.
"Potter, let me in." Draco called out to Potter. "Potter, if you want to get free from the unconsciousness, you have to let me in." The door opened and revealed Potter who was sitting with his knees folded against his chest. The cupboard was so small that Draco wouldn't fit inside, so he knelt outside.
"Oh, this is Tenebrus. The best trained Thestral in Great Britain!" Potter proclaimed proudly. "Come on, we're gonna ride it."
Potter bit his bottom lip. His eyes were inspecting the corridor and its stony walls and refused to look near Draco.
They were in their fifth month now. And Draco was getting frustrated by his mother's wand. It seemed the wand wouldn't cooperate well with him. Sometimes, when he casted a complex spell, the effect wasn't at its optimum result and sometimes the spell hit the wrong target.
Scratch that! Why in Salazar's name would he even consider to kiss back in the first thought?! Oh Merlin. Did that mean he liked Potter? What?! But he was a boy. They were both boys! Should he kiss Potter back? Why had Potter kissed him? Did Potter like him? Was he allowed to kiss Potter back? He was not a girl, so it would be okay to kiss him, right? He wouldn't demand marriage and take over Malfoy's fortune in the future, right? Of course he wouldn't. Potter was a boy so he wouldn't force him into intercourse and then get pregnant and demand marriage, right? There was no potion for same sex couples to acquire a baby. But there might have been a Dark spell for that… Oh Merlin, what should he do?
"Very well. You better start it now. I want all this to end as soon as possible." Narcissa stepped back a few steps to make room for her son.
"Eighty points, Mr. Malfoy?" Professor Dakarrt took Draco's proposal into consideration. He seemed to be reluctant to agree.
"Tomorrow, eight o'clock sharp outside the Manor, Harry," Draco said and bid the boy goodbye at the train Station. And then he got inside his car and drove home. He couldn't wait for tomorrow. When Draco arrived at the Manor, his parents welcomed and congratulated him for his perfect N.E.W.T.s score.
"Mother!" Draco whined. "If I give it to him and he wears it, it means I'll be bonded with bloody Potter!"
"Of course he is. Your mother interrogated him the whole day." Lucius said and choked around a mouthful of food as his wife stomped hard on his foot.
"I just what, Potter?" Draco spun to face Potter. He hoped he hadn't done something bad or stupid. Oh Merlin, was his
They took the stairs toward Headmistress McGonagall's office. When they arrived at the gargoyle, Draco and Potter stared at each other.
"Ready?" Draco had Harry nodded firmly. He bit his bottom lip, unsure if he'd do it right without hurting Harry.
"Uh, shall we go then?" Draco took the green pouch from his trunk and slipped it safely into his pocket.
At first Potter seemed surprised by the act, but then he quickly recovered from the shock and kissed back. He slipped his hands around Draco's neck, and slyly one of his hands moved up and buried itself in Draco's silky blond hair. Draco never let anyone but his mother touch his perfect hair; he would normally hex anyone who dared to do so, but when he felt Potter's hand on his hair, Draco found that he liked it. It sent tingling sensations through his body. His stomach fluttered and some other foreign pleasant feelings rushed down his every cell. He pushed Potter until the boy was laying on the bed, Draco on top of him, kissing breathlessly.
It only took milliseconds for Draco to process what was happening. Potter thought he hadn't wanted it and was angry at him for it.
"Do you think it refused to repair my wand because the wand saw it as its rival?" Draco asked Potter.
. If the boy was having a nightmare and he intruded on his head, it could turn out a mess. So Draco returned to his room.
Draco was really confused with the Boy Who Lived Twice in his arms. Though he didn't know all about the Gryffindor, he had started to understand a little more every day about him. From the outside, it looked as though Potter was a bad omen. Wherever he went, big problems always occurred. People around him would get into trouble and end up hurt, and then the whole Wizarding World would demand that responsibility fall on him to fix all the damage and make everything better again. Did they, even once, think that the truth was they were dropping the entire Wizarding World's burden onto a boy's shoulders, only using his name as the Boy Who Someday Must Defeat the Dark Lord? They were practically abusing him! He was just a boy, and he was alone! They never cared nor were aware of his wellbeing and fear.
"That's not it! I just don't want to have an…argument with her. She- she's Ron's sister." Potter added softly, "Her family been nice to me."
"It's for your own good, Harry." Draco brushed Harry's bottom lip. It had been two weeks since the last time they'd kissed, and Draco believed that what he had just given to Harry had motivated the boy strongly, for instantly, his nose was buried into his Potions book. Tonight, though, as Draco looked over Harry's study, the dark-haired boy could only answer five questions. Draco patted Harry's shoulder and gave him a look of mock-sadness.
. It was twenty to eight and he jumped from the bed, awakening Potter in the process. Draco dashed for a hasty shower and dressed. Five minutes before eight, he walked out of his room and got stopped by Potter at the common room.
"You like me calling you Harry, Harry?" Draco whispered into Potter's ear. Potter jumped and gasped in surprise. When he turned his head to look at him, the blond captured his lips.
They were in the courtyard now, leaning against the big pillar in the farthest corner from the doors to the entrance hall. Draco was hiding in the shadow as best as he could. Since the DADA class ended, words about its events had spread around Hogwarts. It had even reached the ears of the professors – and all thanks to the boy before him. Draco had lectured Potter about it, plus about his utter lack of self-control, emotional control, anger management and tact. Being Potter, of course he'd apologized the whole time. Draco wasn't sure if the younger boy had even listened to him at all.
"Morning was so hours ago. My stomach informs me that it's lunch time." Harry spoke without releasing the finger from his mouth. Draco chuckled at the act and looked at Harry in adoration.
Draco did as Potter said. Took a quick shower and then dressed warm for the trip. He was wondering whether he should tell his father about his arm or not. A Unicorn was involved here. He should be careful with this information.
It was freezing cold outside, especially in the flat, empty spaces, where winter winds could have frozen an owl. Draco wrapped his dark green robe tighter about his body, his eighteenth's birthday present from his parents.
"I am so a hundred and seven percent sure and ready. I want you, Draco." Harry held the boy above him tight.
"What the hell! You!" The Auror pointed at Tippy, "You disobey your master's order to stay still! Lucius, you can't even teach your house-elf to obey you? You're a disgrace to Death Eaters!"
"Why, young Malfoy, of course we need you for the ritual to work. We need the chosen one to be host for the Dark Lord's soul." The Auror moved his wand toward Lucius.
He opened his mother's letter and read it. Draco read it twice before he rolled the letter and put it inside the drawer.
"Better go now." Draco said huskily and when he turned around he was so surprised by what he saw that he very nearly choked on a lungful of air. There before him was his mother standing impassively, staring straight at him. "Mother!" Draco shrilled.
Only half the seventh year students of his year had returned to Hogwarts to repeat their term and have a proper graduation. Draco had returned with his two other fellow Slytherins; Millicent Bulstrode and Daphne Greengrass. Too bad Pansy transferred to Beauxbatons and Blaise and Theodore transferred to Durmstrang. If not, they could've ruled the Slytherin House this year.
After a moment far too brief, Potter removed his lips from Draco's. The blond gasped softly. His pupils were dilated, until there were only thin silver circles in his eyes. Draco stared at Potter who was staring back at him, hands on the blond's shoulders.
With a deep sigh, Draco took off Potter's shoes and robe magically. He removed the round spectacles from Potter's face and put them on the nightstand. Feeling that there was nothing left to do, Draco proceeded to undress himself and then followed Potter to enter the dream world.
"Um, thank you, Malfoy, for the...dinner." They both laughed mildly. "Well, I guess I'll go back to my room, then." Potter stood up from the bed and touched the door's handle.
"What has all this to do with me?" Draco pulled their attention toward him again. Trust Potter to cause a scene at the worse of times.
Saving the Gryffindor any discomfort, Draco pulled himself backward. He flung the strap of his bag on his left shoulder.
"I wasn't even aware that he'd moved from his place, mother." Draco stood beside the sleeping Potter.
From the corner of his eye Draco could see Potter tilting his head. Apparently the other boy was also bewildered by their
Draco hesitated, but decided to stay – mostly because he was attracted to Potter's magic. He hadn't known that magic had a scent and a taste. He'd never noticed any before. Draco only sensed people's magical signature, his own magic signature – up until now. He had never found anything to indicate that magic had a taste and scent. So why he could taste Potter's magic?
Draco must have forgotten to set the alarm because when he woke up, the sun's rays were piercing through his royal-green curtains. He also noticed his arms were full of Potter's body. He didn't remember having him in his arms last night.
"Yes… Professor, can I ask you something? Does Unicorn's blood have negative effect if it makes contact with human's skin?" Draco hoped nobody would hear their conversation. He could see from the corner of his eye that everybody in the Great Hall was watching him.
Draco looked up to the sky and noticed it must be past lunch and he'd missed the beginning of his Advanced Arithmancy class this noon. Checking his pocket watch, it turned out that he still had a chance to attend what was left of the class. It was nearly one. Rolling his sleeves back down to the wrists, Draco sighed and walked back to the edge of the forest. Draco brushed any dirt on his robe and tailored trousers off before setting out back to the castle.
At the mention of relatives, Draco reminded of the cruel muggles that had violated his Harry in his childhood. He would search information about the muggles and make a malicious visit in the future.
"Draco, it's only for a moment. As soon as all the work in the dungeon finished, you'll get it back again." Narcissa waved her hand. She was really starting to feel uncomfortable with all these outsiders inside the Manor.
"Mr. Malfoy, I understand your concern over your parents' safety. But your safety is also my concern as your headmistress. You should have informed me before you made the decision to leave Hogwarts without my knowledge. And you too, Mr. Potter." McGonagall looked at them behind her spectacles.
The twilight beautifully painted the Hogwarts' sky. The winter air breezed frigidly. The boy beside him flushed in the cold wind, hugging himself tightly, and leant into Draco's space.
A cry deafened Draco's ears. He looked down at the Unicorn's wounded leg and saw the impaled branch prodded the flesh deeper, silver blood flowing even faster now. Without a thought, Draco whisked down and stroked the crying Unicorn, hoping to calm the magical creature. He heard a whiff behind. Oh no, was the beast planning to eat the Unicorn? It looked like a kind of carnivorous beast. And because the Unicorn was wounded, perhaps the horse-like skeleton beast smelled its flesh and blood.
Draco saw Potter standing near the hall's doors, just staring at him. Holding himself upright, Draco returned to the Great Hall and Potter dutifully accompanied him to the breakfast table.
As soon as Draco stepped inside his room, he pulled out the letter and the soothing vial from his robe.
"Come for me, Harry." Draco whispered over Harry's bottom lip and nibbled on it. A big moan answered him. Harry opened his eyes and staring at Draco intensely that it almost broke Draco's control.
"I was joking, mother. I'll free him as soon as the work at the dungeon is finished. Just so he won't do anything fool again."
Draco awakened with something tickling his neck. His eyes snapped open when he felt something nuzzling against his chest. His whole body was warmer than usual. He looked down and had messy dark hair on his nose. Draco smiled and buried his nose into the hair. It smelt of apple and fresh meadow.
Suddenly he heard a harsh whizz behind him. He turned his head to find a huge bat-winged horse-like thing with a skeletal body and a face with reptilian features. Its empty white eyes stared down at him, ten feet away.
"Potter," Draco said, but he couldn't make any more words. He wanted to assure Potter that it was all right, that it was a normal thing. But it wasn't normal, and at the same time it wasn't something bad either. It was…special.
It was a sweet addiction, forbidden pleasure, feeling Harry inside, connected as one. As Draco's movement accelerated in its speed, pressure and depth, their bodies danced together, forgetting the world and only them were exist. Paradise sensation in every sensory promised them that it wouldn't be their once nor last time to do such intimate act together.
"Oh. I'm sorry I didn't know… Oh Merlin, does she know? Is she mad at you?" Potter resumed taking the ring off of his finger and Draco had to grab his left hand to stop him.
"I'm coming! You left me alone yesterday! I'm coming with you whether you like it or not!" Potter grabbed Draco's arm tightly. Draco didn't have time to argue so he took Potter to Side-Along and Disapparated straight to the Manor's gates.
They Apparated back outside Malfoy manor to ride Tenebrus after they'd deposited the ex-Death Eaters and the spy, and flew back to Hogwarts' forest. Thankfully, the Hogwarts' ward acknowledged them so that they could land in the forest. They arrived at the Hogwarts entrance hall at noon. The four ex-Death Eaters had been handled by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the Ministry had reunited all Aurors to interrogate them before they were sent back to catch other ex-Death Eaters.
Draco glanced at Potter, waited until Potter glanced back at him and then Draco walked toward his room.
Unlike the ground floor, the transparent glass wall on the first floor was covering the front part only. The other three sides along with the floor were fully decorated with mosaic. There was a pair of glass doors on the glass wall to reach the balcony outside which was decorated with blossom ivy. The interior was combination of pastel colours of white, grey and green. It was more luxurious than the ground floor and more personal because the whole first floor was the master suite. On the back side was a pair of grey-wooden doors that connect the room with the exclusive en suite bathroom. It was designed with outdoor concept where two sides of the walls and the roof were glasses. You could see the backyard from there. And the backyard itself was as breathtaking as the whole house. Various flowers were planted in a unique pattern and in the centre ground was a pond aside the green apple tree.
"Mr. Malfoy, I had not expected the Daily Prophet to have such information. But I talked with and assured both professors and students before you came in that you are not guilty of the charges pressed against you, and that you are faithful to the light." said McGonagall. "And for your safety, Malfoy, from now on you are not allowed to leave Hogwarts at least until all the remaining Death Eaters are captured."
"Potter your neck is cold. Why are you not wearing the scarf?" Draco frowned at Potter. At those words, Potter clenched his jaw. "Potter? What- where's my scarf?" Draco knew the difference between Potter's annoyed frown and confused frown, and that had just been anger. Potter averted his eyes from Draco's and the blond sensed magic beginning to bubble from Potter's body.
By the morning, Draco was grateful for waking up, as it meant some time last night the pain had abated so he fell asleep. It still hurt though, but Draco was able to bear such pain.
Without another word, Potter climbed into Draco's bed, laying on his side at the very edge of the mattress. The two closed their eyes, and not five minutes later Draco's snapped back open to take in the sight of Potter clutching himself tightly. Dealing with this boy was turning out to be incredibly tiring.
"I don't want to ask why you're here, Potter." Draco walked toward the other boy. "What are you doing?"
"Try again!" When Potter saw the confusion in Draco's face, he positioned himself back behind Draco, and put a hand on Draco's hip while the other raised Draco's wand-hand. "Try it again! This time, try harder!"
"Oh, Draco. It's nothing. We were just chatting. He's a nice young man and very entertaining. Come visit us again this summer, Potter. I enjoyed your company." Narcissa smiled at Potter, and, once again stomped on her husband's foot when Lucius attempted to disapprove.
"Don't leave. Please. Just…" Potter whispered into Draco's neck. That pleading voice was broken and heart clenching. It made Draco extremely uncomfortable, he was watery-eyed.
"It's not! I saw Granger's also had the same color as ours. Let it proceed to that color and be patient!"
"You're making this a habit, Potter, sleeping in my arms." Draco joked when they had settled to a comfortable position in bed. He heard Potter chuckle weakly against his chest and that was enough to warm Draco's heart. "Good night, Potter."
"Finally, young Malfoy. We've been waiting for you. Didn't expect you this soon however. Tch, pity, the fun should end so quickly." The Auror gave Lucius Malfoy a distasteful look.
so well that Potter hadn't felt him penetrating his memories. After some minutes, Draco was finally able to hold his guts back. Though images of frightened beaten little Potter with broken bones and ribs still flashed in his eyes, Draco stood up, balancing his posture.
" Merlin, I don't know how I'll cope with your slow brain." Draco sighed dramatically. He stepped forward until there was no more space between them and then put his arm around Harry's waist and his right hand holding Harry's face. Harry blinked, finding himself a moment later drowning into Draco's infatuation kiss. A hard press on his lips and a blink later, Harry set his hands to the place where it belong on Draco and kissing back in equal passion.
"No." Draco grabbed the letter and walked to his parents. "Mother, father, I'll send them to the Ministry with Potter. Snippy! Loopy!"
They sat at Draco's usual place and began to fill their plates with lamb chops. Millicent stood, walked up to shoo away a sixth year girl who had been sitting beside him, and sat in her spot.
They arrived at the manor at three o'clock in the afternoon and headed straight to Draco's dining room to have their very late lunch.
"And how is this matter of Saint Potter any concern of mine, Granger?" Draco raised his head, looking at the Gryffindor girl from the tip of his nose.
"Yes, it's time. We've been doing some research and been prepared for this." Another dark wizard showed a hostile face. "To, once again, resurrect the Dark Lord!"
"Well, Harry? What do you think? I promised you something nice and I just fulfill it; a tour of my grandeur cottage." Draco wriggled his eyebrows to the stunned Harry.
"Well, I'm all right, aren't I? They're just weak and they overreacted. Daft people," Draco scorned. He hoped Potter hadn't noticed his previous shiver when the boy's magic had touched him.
More than ten minutes passed with Potter trembling in Draco's arms. The dark-haired boy seemed calmed down now. Draco tried to release his hold on the boy but Potter tightened his grip on Draco.
"You're so wrong by saying those words now." Harry leaned into Draco's hand as his tears were brushed off by Draco's thumb. "You should say it so long ago so I wouldn't have to feel alone and hurt."
As Draco stepped inside, stopping one foot from the threshold of Potter's room, he noticed there was only one occupied side of the room.
When Draco lay in his bed that night, he heard Harry grumbling in the other bed and then the curtain around the bed closed. Draco prayed that tomorrow Harry was in a good mood and had a sharp memory because he wanted to kiss the boy so bad!
"W-what matter, Malfoy? Can we talk later? We're about to miss breakfast." Potter tried again to reach the door.
Hesitantly Draco raised his left hand and touched Potter's hair. He couldn't stop thinking about how that messy hair could be so soft to his touch. Slowly, Draco started to stroke the hair that was nearly as smooth as his. When the boy woke up later, he had to ask him what hair product he used to tame that wild hair. If there was that good a shampoo sold out there, then he wouldn't have to brew his own shampoo formula again to make his hair silk-smooth and shiny. Feeling drowsy, Draco slipped his right arm beneath Potter and the left one around Potter's waist. It was Sunday after all, so he had the right to fall back into the world of dreams.
This time, their kisses were full of desire and intense emotions. The kisses were so full of want yet lingered in a string of connection to each other. They took their time exploring their true emotions and feelings and transmitted them within kisses. Kisses that were all and everything in eyes closed, because they felt them by heart.
After what seemed like an hour practicing to no avail, Draco was starting to give up. He didn't know what was wrong. He had thought hard about all his Quidditch memories but still it didn't affect the charm. Draco was lowering his wand, feeling defeated, when he felt a warm body press lightly against his back and hands on his hips.
"Er…right. I guess I'll take a training program to be a healer." Harry turned his head back and stared up to the canopy.
Potter released Draco's hand and replaced it to Draco's right hip, clutching his jumper hard, showing his excitement.
Immediately, Draco's wand was in his hand as he found they weren't expecting any guests and Disapparated to the wrought-iron gates on the driveway. Outside the gates, he saw the familiar silhouette of a wizard approaching. When the wizard had finally arrived before the gates, Draco's jaw dropped to the ground.
When they returned to Draco's wing, the blond yanked Potter into his room and threw the boy against the doors.
"Oh, my uncle never gave me food unless I'd done everything they'd ordered right. If I got lucky, sometimes I'd get a meal in a day. Oh, hey, are they really peacocks?" Potter was now looking at the albino peacocks in the yard outside the window.
"Do you have treacle tart in the bless box, Malfoy?" Potter asked while lifting a fork of the dessert toward his mouth.
"Oh please, don't deny what is obvious, Harry. And yes, Malfoy, we know you two shared your room too many times to count. Besides, Harry wearing your significant ring is a huge giveaway, Malfoy." Granger looked at Draco and Potter as if they were children caught with their hands in a cookie jar.
"No, there… Here," Potter leant forward and then gently brushed the sugar powder just below Draco's bottom lip, swept from the corner of Draco's mouth with Potter's thumb.
Draco casted Tempus, and saw that there were still twenty-five minutes left before the Advanced Potions class began. He was leaning against the wall of the Quidditch pitch, chewing a sweet n' sour green apple he'd picked from the fruit bowl on the common room. He didn't really feel like attending class. One skip would be fine. He'd already mastered all the potions of the advanced potions book anyway. Besides, it would only cause him harm if he tried to do today's potion with his mother's wand. The potion they would brew today needed wand work and he doubted the wand would collaborate long enough for him not to kill anyone before the end of the class.
"I think helping me fix my wand isn't something against the law, Potter." Draco quirked his eyebrow Malfoyishly. "And Potter, as far as I know, you, as in general, can't fix a broken wand."
Were they having a staring contest now? Because Draco didn't know what he should do or say next. He hoped Potter would initiate an action first. As if reading Draco's mind, Potter moved. He pressed his lips again against Draco's and this time, Potter teased the other's lips with his tongue. Draco gasped at that and Potter used the opportunity to slither his tongue into Draco's mouth. Draco let the other boy explore him. Being a fast learner, a moment later Draco mimicked the gesture. He brushed Potter's bottom lip with his tongue, eliciting a small gasp from the younger boy. Then Draco slipped his tongue into Potter's mouth, stroking the boy's tongue, teeth and the ticklish palate. A moan of pleasure came from Potter. That did something to Draco's lower body parts. Afraid that Potter would notice the excitement of a certain organ, Draco broke the kiss and separated their bodies. His hand on Potter's hair slipped down to his neck. Potter's cold neck. Draco glanced at Potter's neck, and then pulled the boy's jacket open a bit.
At eight o'clock sharp Draco left Hogwarts and walked a few feet from the gates, away from the crowd of students, and then with a soft whoosh he Disapparated to the manor. His mother had waited for him in their entrance hall and accompanied Draco for breakfast. His father was already in the dungeon, waiting for the Ministry team.
"Of course." McGonagall turned her head to her right and looked at the portrait on the wall. "Albus?"
Draco jolted backward. He had never gotten an erection from touching someone before. But then again, he'd never actually touched anyone like this before. Draco panicked, and he excused himself to take a cold shower and told Potter to do the same because they had breakfast waiting. When Draco finished dressing, it was nine o'clock already. He summoned Tippy and asked if his parents had been upset by his absence at the breakfast table. Tippy told him that his father demanded his presence but his mother told him to leave Draco alone. After that, Draco asked Tippy to serve him and Potter breakfast in his private dining room.
Had he done something bad to Potter in the common room? What if Potter hadn't wanted his friends to know his true feelings? Draco mentally slapped himself. Maybe he should apologize to Potter.
Draco put his bag on the desk and freed himself from his robe. His attempt to lie on bed was interrupted by another sharp pain in his arm. Draco rolled his left sleeve up and the skin glared deep red as if it was burnt. Draco was holding back not to scream. It was so painful and hot. He darted toward the bathroom and ran cold water on it. The cold from the water didn't soothe the burning mark, but the cool sensation on the skin around it helped distract Draco from the pain slightly until it subsided. It took him about ten minutes in the bathroom. He dried his arm and rolled down his sleeve back down.
Draco blinked, turned his head to Potter then to his arm then to Potter again and the act went on and on.
"I was so worried, Harry… Why didn't you tell us? We could have gone with you." Granger put her hands over her heart, as if showing Potter how much she had been worried and hurt that her friend was keeping things from her. Draco felt his nausea rising at the show.
"Not the way I thought you'd wake me up." Potter mumbled against Draco's chest. Draco loosened his arms and leaned backward to look at Potter.
Draco straightened and then put his hands on the Elder Wand, ready to snap the wand in two pieces. Or maybe into more than two.
, and sighed at the time. It was fifteen to nine. Draco glanced at Potter and saw the boy staring at the time.
"Look!" Potter showed Draco his left arm. His flawless, smooth left forearm. Without the scar of Death Eater mark and its toxicant dark magic.
A-ha! Now is a good time to confront the dark haired boy, Draco thought. So when he noticed Potter's hand was trying to reach the door handle, Draco corrected his posture and stepped to the spot before Potter, blocking him from the exit.
"Now, Potter. I need you to stay sit in this sofa until I'm back here this afternoon." Draco watched Potter for any sign of obedience, but the boy's face remained completely slack.
Draco blinked. Had Potter really done that for him? The boy had even waited for him to come take his lunch. Nobody had ever done that for him before! Hiding his astonishment, Draco pulled a face at him.
"Yeah. Me neither." Potter hunched, burying his face into Draco's scarf. Draco found the gesture adorable.
"That's the only way to get you free from the curse of the necklace. By submitting to me, I will own you." Draco understood Potter's frown at once again having to be under someone else's control. So Draco talked to him again and convinced him that he wouldn't do or ask Potter to do anything, and that he would free him after he woke up. With a hesitant nod, Potter stepped out of the cupboard and they both pulled out back to reality again. When they were back to the Receiving room, Draco ordered Potter to put on the necklace, and then it disappeared from view.
When Draco arrived at the Thestral clearing, he didn't see Tenebrus. Only young and smaller Thestrals that were lying on the ground and playing with snow. He didn't know if the smaller Thestrals could be ridden or were even trained like Tenebrus.
"Harry, I think you're mistaken your nightmares with terror of the past." Draco reached out to caress Harry's arms, "Remember when the ex-Death Eaters visited the manor? You were so eagerly wanted to go with me and when we arrived, you showed natural respond of firm readiness and determination to enter a battlefield. So those dreams, love, I think they were telling you that you missed the battle." Draco had Harry turned to his side and was facing him. He stroked Harry's hair tenderly, comforting. The dark hair boy staring at Draco, and then he closed his eyes, feeling the alluring touch on his hair. Draco gathered the boy into his embrace and soon following him chasing dreamless slumber.
"Oh, it's nothing, Darling. We just chatted." Narcissa smiled innocently. "He's a good boy, Draco dear."
"Wow, Draco. This place is absolutely brilliant! I've never seen something beautiful like this…" Harry with glassy eyes thanked Draco by a big nod.
"But…I don't understand. I mean, this ring. Isn't it a ring of…of…" Harry tilted his head up more and furrowed, thinking hard of something.
Draco swallowed. Uh oh, this wasn't good. He glanced at Potter's hand as it tugged at his messy dark hair. Merlin, he knew that gesture well. The obvious behavior which he knew well possessed Potter when the boy was nervous. Nervous Potter meant not good.
Draco stood without saying anything. He didn't want to speak and nor did he know what to say to his former enemy. Potter looked uncomfortable and uneasy. Draco was just staring at him. Not glaring, just staring, as if he stared at the empty air.
Draco presumed two hours had passed since he'd been petrified. He'd heard no noise outside the door. The tower was completely deserted, which meant it was dinnertime.
"She was very annoying. Always popped up loudly in my potions lab. She made me ruin the brewing so I tricked her to have my gloves." Draco stared at the emerald eyes intently.
He sighed. How would he brew potions without his own wand? After he graduated, he planned to be a potions master. It was more of a dream actually. His passion toward potions had been nestled in his mind since the first time his father took him to the Malfoy Apothecary headquarters when he was seven. And then he'd found his father's alchemy book on his father's table at the library after they returned to the manor.
"Tempting, Potter. Very tempting." Draco sat beside him, pointed his wand at the boy's forehead, and casted
"Are you kidding me, Potter? How can I come out there and show to the world that I have the Elder Wand in my hand? It's like 'Hey look, I own the Elder Wand. So come and kill me if you want it!', you daft git!" Draco pressed his fingertips to Potter's forehead. Potter grabbed Draco's wrist and lowered it from his face.
Draco sighed and without waiting for Potter's reply, asked Lucius' permission to return to Hogwarts if he wasn't needed anymore at the Manor. Grabbing Potter's arm roughly, he Apparated them back outside of Hogwarts' gates, surprising Filch who was waiting for students to return from Hogsmeade. Draco left Potter alone and dashed toward his room.
"What? When did he move here?" Slowly so as to not waking the dark-haired boy, Draco turned his body fully on his right side. He eyed the messy dark hair before his face. Thinking about it now, Draco knew the boy must have moved to his bed sometime in mid-night, most likely because of a nightmare.
Potter didn't comment, because they were now only inches apart from each other's face. The Gryffindor looked like he was having trouble breathing. Draco looked down at the dark-haired boy, and Potter looked up at the blond. Draco remembered that he had something else to say to Potter but he couldn't think straight at the moment to recall what it was. For a second, Draco asked himself what was he at, but the question was forgotten the next second. All his attention was on the emerald eyes he was staring at. Having a chance to see them this close, Draco admitted to himself how beautiful those eyes were. Though now they were just green rings around the black, dilated pupils. So green, like his favorite color. So Slytherin.
"I promised you something if you pass the NEWT. The ring is what you deserve for that." And for everything, Draco added in his head.
The situation repeated on Friday. The pain on Draco's arm became harder to bear. Potter joined him at mealtime and was apparently still avoiding his friends.
"Tempus," Draco whispered. He smiled at the conjured time. He wiped his smile from his face as he thought about how to explain this to his parents. "Ah! Of course." Draco tsk-ed. His parents didn't know that his Hawthorn wand was broken. So all he had to say when he returned his mother's wand was that Potter gave it back to him. Yeah, as simple as that would do.
As Draco finally arrived in his room, he stared at the pouch in his hands. He kept staring at it motionless. And then he moved toward his trunk and put the pouch in it with care.
"Potter, I don't understand why you didn't correct your eyesight. Those spectacles are so annoying!" Draco eyed the round spectacles in distaste.
"Potter," Draco greeted. He hoped he wasn't blushing, remembering their previous encounter in the forest.
Without stopping their kisses, Draco felt Potter loop his waist with his strong legs. Potter pushed Draco down harder with his legs, his hand roaming onto the other's body. Draco was starting to feel numb from his arms beneath Potter; he moved slightly to allow the blood to rush back into his arms, and, when he did so, created a pleasurable friction between his body and Potter's. More specifically, where their southern body parts brushed against each other. Both of them gasped aloud at the sensation.
Refreshed and feeling better, Draco sat on the unoccupied bed. His scarf was on it. He grabbed it and brought it to his face. It had a faint smell that was Potter; fresh meadow and a hint of Potter's scent of magic. Ah! He remembered. He wanted to know how magic had smelled. But even thinking about it again now, that had been the first time he had found a magic that could create a scent. If a wizard or a witch with very strong magic like Potter had their own magic scents, how come he had never been able to smell the Dark Lord's or Dumbledore's? Or, was it only Potter who had a scent to his magic? If so, why was he only noticing it now? Unless…he had always sensed it but hadn't been aware of it? He did smell spring around sometimes. That's why he liked Hogwarts, because it had a spring scent which he'd thought was the product of a charm that altered the Hogwarts atmosphere. Just like the ceiling's charm in the Great Hall.
The only option to know what was happening was by going to library and looking up a book about Unicorns. No way was Draco going to go to the infirmary and let others see the scar of the Dark Mark on his skin. So he took a quick shower, got dressed and grabbed the robe folded on the chair. He searched for his scarf but then remembered where it was. Draco smiled.
"Is that a map?" Draco peered into the parchment. "Merlin, it's a map of Hogwarts! And what are those moving labels?" Draco leant closer.
"Um, two called you Master Malfoy and, um, you have a free house-elf." Potter stuttered suddenly. "W-why did they call you Master Malfoy and not Master Draco?"
Thursday morning came and that day Draco had planned to work with his potions formula. He let Potter sleep the whole day and ordered Tippy to provide anything the boy needed, and to inform Potter that he was working with his potions and didn't want to be disturbed. The whole day Draco worked in his potions lab on the ground floor of his wing. At dinner he decided to stop his experiments, returned to his room, took a shower, then joined his parents in the master dining room.
Taking a big breath, Draco raised his wand. He began to make spiral movement with his wand right above the cauldron. Vaguely he heard the class hold their breath as he did so. Draco whispered the incantation word while moving his wand.
"Tch, I would have said that in our fourth year if I could." It was Draco's turn to blush and averted his eyes away.
A moment later two plates of delicious finger sandwiches and vanilla glazed apple cinnamon muffins were served before the two boys. They ate merrily.
"No. It's just that, he's been gone since last night. He wasn't in the Great Hall at breakfast, so we visited his room but his cold bed told us that it wasn't used last night. And, um, since he walked out of the Great Hall right behind you last night, we thought maybe you noticed where he was going after dinner?" Granger bit her bottom lip, obviously worried.
"Good luck with your NEWTs, dear." Narcissa hugged Draco and then kissed his forehead. And then she walked up to Potter and hugged him briefly, "You, too, Potter. Now, off you go."
Draco didn't like his mother's smile and her words. She had to be on to something. He looked at his father and Lucius gave him a pitying look with a touch of resignation and a bit of horror. Draco swallowed his meal with effort. His mother was definitely on to something. Had she threatened Potter? Anything? What?
He took a deep breath once, and exhaled. Eyes staring through to the darker side of the forest. Slowly his body glided down until he landed on the damp ground, legs folded against his chest. His arms embraced his knees and Draco dropped his head on them, broken and crying.
"Now, Harry, I want to show you something." Draco nodded to the flower field and Harry tilted his head, puzzled of where and why were they here. Draco watched Harry deeply inhaled the fresh air and pleasant fragrance from the flower field. And then Draco reached up and put his right palm flat in the air.
"So? He's a Slytherin. Of course Filch would find him in the dungeon!" one of the boy's friends commented dryly.
"He's not a Death Eater!" And of course, all eyes went straight to Potter at that. "He can produce a
Draco made a face, but soon enough he too was laughing freely. He would have gotten punished if his mother had heard the word come out from his mouth.
"Um…you've been missing for two hours since the class ended." Potter scratched the back of his neck.
"Ah, Mr. Malfoy. I believe you came to consult about the recent issue. Come up. Scottish Fold," the headmistress told the gargoyle and the spiral staircase toward her office arose.
"After Malfoy disarmed you, I took Malfoy's wand at the Malfoy manor. So the Elder Wand's ownership fell to me. Then Voldemort took it from your grave and he used it to AK me, but the spell counterattacked him and he died." Potter explained shortly but accurately.
"Night, Malfoy." Potter bid softly. He took off his shoes and put his spectacles and Draco's scarf beside the pillow, and then slipped under the covers.
"What?" And then Draco felt a push on his body. Next, the door shut. Draco thought it was Peeves, so he called out to the poltergeist. But when he turned his body, he choked at the appearance of Harry Potter in his room. "Potter!"
"Potter, you don't sound convincing." Draco stomped the snow. He was started to get tired of walking.
Draco looked deep into Harry's eyes and waited for few seconds. He lowered his head and kissed Harry in tender gesture. He let his lips lingered against Harry's until the boy began to kiss him back passionately. Slowly Draco began to move once; drew out few inches and then pushed back in. The motion was rewarded by a low moan. Draco repeated the movement and each time the speed accelerated. Low moans soon began to change to throaty moans of high pleasure. Impatience calls for his name between gasps and moans grew as Draco released his mouth from Harry and planted it to every inch of Harry's writhing body.
"Uh, yes." Potter grabbed two Death Eaters. Draco followed, grabbing the other two for a side-along Apparition.
Bless Merlin, as soon as he sat in the Great Hall at dinner that day, Icarus came with a letter and a small package. Draco gave his eagle owl a treat after he secured the letter and package into his robe pocket.
"Holy Merlin! You have a Quidditch pitch!" Potter stared in disbelief at the green field before him.
Draco gave Potter's door a soft knock, and he didn't have to wait long before the door opened and Potter stood in front of him.
He kept walking deeper into the forest until he'd reached the permitted boundary line. This was as far as he'd ever explored the Forbidden Forest. As he found "his" tree, he threw his back against the big trunk.
He checked that the color was a perfect aquamarine like it was supposed to be. The next thirteen minutes he waited, leaning against the stone wall. His hands slipped inside his trousers' pockets. Draco took the spare moment as an opportunity to observe the class. Some pairs were still struggling with the bluegrass, some others looked confused by the directions in the book. He even noticed Granger's frustration and complaints to her partner about the right color of the liquid. And then his eyes fell to Potter. It looked like the boy had trouble with the brewing as he was tugging his hair every few seconds. Sweat drops trailed down from his face. Potter was checking the formula on the book while nibbling his bottom lip. Once in a while he had a debate with Thomas with his hand pulling his already messy hair. Draco's hand itched to bat the abusing hand.
"Potter, I'm already late. It's not a vacation or a play. We're dealing with dark artefacts." Draco moved toward a safe area to Disapparate.
On the way to Wiltshire, where Malfoy Manor was, Draco's mind was split between his parents and Potter. The manor's ward was strong enough that it hadn't been cracked by the Dark Lord in the past. So there was a sure guarantee that his parents would be safe in the manor. But Potter, Draco didn't know what to think about this boy. What was his intention in coming to help him? Another hero-complex act? Another show off to the Wizarding World? Or was he trying to prove that he was still needed? What was it?
"Potter," Narcissa greeted him, inviting him to sit. Draco sat on the same sofa. "So, how did you stray here?" she asked, to the point.
"Um, why would you want it back?" Potter asked, though both of them knew it was a stupid question. Potter's back hunched protectively.
"All right, mate?" Weasel patted Potter's shoulder when he returned. "It's okay. I'll tell Bill about it. He'll be very mad at Ginny I'm sure."
"There's the cave! Come on!" Potter ran inside the dark cave. Draco followed behind, entering the damp and now dim cave. Potter had casted
"I was waiting for you until two in your room, but you didn't show up. And you didn't take your lunch at the Great Hall." Potter waved the map again. "So, I was looking for you with this and found you in the forest."
"Why? What would possibly hurt me?" Draco looked around and saw nothing but Potter. Ah! Understanding came to him; Potter was warning him from his own wild magic. From the state the dark-haired boy was in, Draco could tell that Potter was losing control over his powers. Why? How? Potter started to walk away, startling him.
"Draco?" Harry called against Draco's bare chest an hour later after they made another brilliant love.
Draco exhaled a big sigh. He grabbed his green cashmere scarf from the bed and draped it to Potter's neck.
"I believe the Minister has sent you his words about it." Draco lifted his chin. He didn't want to explain it all again to the headmistress.
"I set her free when I was seven." Draco raised his eyebrows, watching the uncomfortable Gryffindor.
As they arrived at the Grand Staircase Tower entrance, Draco smacked the back of Potter's head and walked inside.
with wide eyes. "In a single week, Malfoy! And I've never found this creature in corporeal form before!"
"Harry," Draco stroked Harry's hair tenderly, comforting him, "Relax…Take your time. I'll wait for you."
"Hush you two, go back to your cauldron now. And no, Mr. Wallader, Miss Granger, it's supposed to be marigold before it changes into aquamarine. Not muddy blue." Slughorn moved to check other cauldrons.
"Potter, you didn't bring your trunk with you?" Draco asked as his hand kept stroking Potter's hair.
"What?" Draco flushed red. He'd been watching the Gryffindor the whole time. He hoped Potter hadn't noticed.
"She only listens to Bill. Her obsession to you has reached an unhealthy level, mate. She should be stopped before it makes her crazy. Sorry about that, Harry." Weasel patted Potter again.
Potter was gazing into the air. Draco let some time pass in silence, and when he felt it was enough, he put his hands on Potter's shoulders and squeezed, saying his name softly. The boy averted his eyes. Draco sighed.
The tip of the Elder Wand sparked flames and then his left arm was tugged as if the wand itself were pulling it. Draco released his grip on the wand and it fell down to the ground. But it wasn't over yet. When the wand hit the ground, precisely three inches from Draco's broken wand, the flame sparkle shot toward the pieces and before Draco and Potter could blink, pieces of Draco's wand burnt into ashes.
"M-Malfoy?" Potter's voice was so small. His hands loosened and slipped from Draco. Draco wanted them to keep touching his skin and hair.
and searched the boy's childhood memories. When he pulled out of Potter's head some moments later, Draco felt highly nauseated and wanted nothing more than to empty all the contents of his stomach out onto the floor. He fell onto one knee, suddenly fighting it hard to keep his balance.
"Yes, Master Malfoy, Sir. Loopy will punish himself for hiding." A second later Loopy was banging his head on the hard wall.
. To create even an incorporeal one is generally considered a sign of great magical power. Now, let's see your
Draco estimated that the area where Potter was headed was not far from the Thestral clearing. Draco had never visited the place before. This particular area of the forest was quite dark and bit wild. Plants and bushes were scattered around in disarray. Wand in hand, Draco entered the forest. He couldn't spot the Gryffindor anywhere. He opened his mouth, ready to call out for the other boy. But as his mouth opened, the scent of spring and fallen rain was drawn into Draco's mouth.
"What is going on here? Harry?" Weasel walked toward the centre of the crowd. At the mention of Potter, Draco spun around and walked to the crowd.
"Are you always this lazy, Harry Potter?" Draco tilted his head backward. "Well, fix yourself. I'm taking a shower."
"Well, what with you stupidly entered the Triwizard Tournament. I literally panicked and almost ran to you when I heard father talking about the plan of bringing you to the resurrection of the Dark Lord. But mother knew and she held me from running to you." Draco scrunched his nose. He raised his eyebrows when he saw Harry made a big O with his mouth.
"The Patronus Charm is an immensely complicated, very difficult spell. To successfully cast the spell, you're not only summoning the happiest memory you can think of, but you are also balancing your mental state and centering all your concentration on your magic." Professor Dakarrt looked at Harper from below his lashes. "The vast majority of witches and wizards are unable to produce any form of
"I don't know. He didn't have the time, maybe?" Harry shrugged, "But, I think I have a better idea."
Draco tried again. This time he closed his eyes as he thought, letting images come and go through his mind at a speed that made them all blur into one. Potter smiling. Potter laughing. He didn't know why it had to be Potter, but Draco didn't care. As long as it brought him a corporeal
"Potter, you DO have my wand, don't you?" After disarming Draco at the Malfoy Manor, Potter had mastered the blond's wand and used it during the Battle of Hogwarts. Since then, Draco had found that Potter was quite fond of his own wand, and he must be keeping Draco's wand somewhere in his trunk.
"You're still here, Potter," Lucius said as they ate the main course. "And still wearing your ring, Draco."
Silver blood rushed out of the flesh, running down the earth. Some of the silver liquid covered Draco's left arm, the one that was holding the wounded leg. Draco hissed. The silver blood felt hot on his skin, nearly burning by the blood's contact. He recalled the lesson about Unicorns and found nothing about the effect of Unicorn's blood when it made contact with human's skin. Draco looked at his arm. The blood was now covering all the surface of his left forearm. It felt so hot. He released his grip on the Unicorn's leg and watched as the furry white open flesh magically closed.
Morning came and Draco found the Gryffindor boy was still sleeping peacefully. He had noticed lately that Potter's nights contained a distinct lack of any nightmares. Good for the both of them then.
Draco leant forward a bit. He checked Potter's neck which was hidden underneath the Hogwarts robe. There was a hint of green inside. Draco didn't know where the feeling came from, but he was pleased by it.
"That was amazing, Malfoy! I had to try several times before I could conjure even a non-corporeal form! And you just—you just—" Potter stuttered behind Draco.
" Were you following me? How did you find me?" Potter asked her back. He looked displeased with her.
"Hm? Why would I do that to my own son? And why are you asking? Is there something you're hiding from me, Draco?" Narcissa raised her eyebrows.
"Master Draco needs Tippy. Tippy is honoured to do Master Draco's order." Tippy chirped, bowing deeply.
They both arrived ten minutes late and graciously Professor Slughorn allowed them to enter the class.
Draco was once again alone in his room. Potter had gone back to his own room with Draco's favorite scarf. The blond didn't ask the boy to give it back.
Draco averted his eyes from her and finished his breakfast in record time before excusing himself and running out.
"Oh, Merlin, I'm sorry! Malfoy, I'm so sorry I didn't meant to—" Potter released Draco's shoulders and stepped backward. He looked completely panicked and was staring at Draco in horror. With a deep crimson face, Potter ran away from Draco.
Imito Respiciofors: made up transfiguration spell. To transfigure object into something the caster thinks in their mind.
Draco ran toward the forest as quickly as he could, before the Headmistress ordered Filch to close all the entrance doors and sealed Hogwarts.
"Seriously, Harry?" Draco heard the Weasel asked Potter in disbelief as they continued walking away.
"I— what?" Draco honestly didn't understand. He hadn't seen anything even close to an animal form in the
Draco opened the door wider and let Potter walk into his room and take the empty bed. When Draco climbed back to his bed, he heard a heavy breath. He turned his head and saw Potter was curled into a fetal position, facing Draco. With a soft sigh, Draco dismissed himself from his bed and slipped into Potter's bed. Draco slipped his arms around the trembling boy and in auto motion Potter anchored his body onto Draco, embraced him tightly. Mentally Draco cursed the boy Weasel for leaving Potter alone with his nightmares. Draco was almost certain now that the boy had nightmares more than often.
"But, Draco, you know what artefact that is." Narcissa looked up at her son, her brows drawing together, and said, "You have to own Potter to be able to take the necklace back."
The magical creature spread its big bat wings and then lowered itself to the ground. Draco took it as his cue to climb up the Thestral. The Thestral rose and Draco almost lost his balance. The skin of the Thestral was bit slippery. He understood now why Potter had to hold its mane when they rode it yesterday. When the Thestral was about to flap its wings, Draco heard someone shout. He looked forward and saw a dark-haired boy running towards him.
Draco stared at his mother in disbelief. Why had she hugged Potter? She never hugged other people. Draco shuddered. He glanced at Potter who was doing the same to him.
"It's mid January, Potter, if you forgot. Of course it's cold. Especially when you're not wearing any outers." Draco blinked. It was as if he'd only just realized the dark-haired boy's condition. Draco studied the Gryffindor, checking him up and down. Potter wore only a brown T-shirt with green patterned flannel and a pair of black jeans. Nothing more. But Draco had to approve that the clothes complimented the dark hair's emerald eyes and his unruly dark hair.
"Fix yourself, Potter." Draco gave the example by pulling out a box of truffles from the box. Opening the lid of the assortment box, Draco enjoyed his favorite assortment while watching the dark-haired boy eyeing the box's contents.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry…!" Potter kept shaking his head. It seemed that the boy wasn't listening to Draco's words.
"How can it be? What kind of wand is that?" Draco stared at his mother's wand. Looked as good as before it was broken.
The four of them jolted at the new voice. They looked behind Draco and found that Harry Potter was standing ten feet away from them.
"What, Harry?" Ron Weasley came into view, with his girlfriend Granger, "You keep avoiding us, rarely join with us, but you have time with the ferret? What the hell is wrong with you, Harry?"
He walked out the green house with the rest of the seventh and eighth years. He rushed down the corridor, passing other students on the way.
There was nothing Draco could do as he arrived at the pitch. The Ravenclaw team was in the middle of practice that morning. Draco watched them for two hours and then it was the Gryffindors' turn to practice. Draco didn't want to see them, so he walked back to his common room and found the room was empty. It seemed the eight-year students were all in Hogsmeade. It was starting to bother Draco, being here without a friend and having nothing to do to pass the time. He decided to end the day locked inside his room.
It was really good luck that there were only nine students in the returned seventh-year boys. Not to mention he was the only Slytherin boy to return to Hogwarts that year.
"Wait, Potter, is that…isn't that Ginerva Weasley label on your door? What is she doing there?" Draco looked up at Potter.
"I…I…I was in Grimmauld Place and suddenly it went chaotic so I went back to Hogwarts but no one opened the gate for me. I didn't know where else to go so I uh, somehow Apparated outside the Manor and when I tried to open the gate, it let me in." Potter shrunk under Draco's stare.
"I'll ask you once more, Potter, and I swear I'll enter your mind if you don't tell me right now what my mother asked you!" Draco put his hands on either side of Potter's head and looked down at him.
"Yes, you see…it's not that easy." Potter scratched his head. "Saturday. I can only do it Saturday. We'll talk about it on Saturday."
"Oh, oh, I mean we're friends now… Something like that. Now I'm going to sleep. Night, Malfoy." Potter pulled the cover and got back to sleep.
"What was your happy memory?" Potter asked in a husky voice. Their lips touched feathery-light as the dark-haired boy spoke.
He arrived at the class just as Professor Slughorn entered the room. Today they would work in pairs. He saw all the Eighth years and Seventh years were already self-paired. This meant he would work alone. Which was fine by him. Actually, it was better, because then he could concentrate on brewing without the disturbance of an incapable partner. Like Potter. He checked who the dark haired boy's partner was and found himself smirking when he saw Thomas was the partner. They both sucked in Advanced Potions.
"You look pathetic yourself, Harper. How long did you have to wait for this opportunity? Only dare to confront someone when you are positive they can't defend themselves?" Draco stood fearless.
"Potter, you are avoiding you friends." Draco saw the other boy flinch and lower his head. "I know it's not my business, but after the battle, I noticed that you were retreating from everyone, from the world, Potter." Draco saw Potter lift his face and look at him from behind his spectacles. "You don't have to answer. But you look unhappy and it…bothers me…" Draco looked away. He could feel his pale face flushing irresistibly.
"I was practicing the Patronus Charm." Draco bit his tongue. Why on Merlin's name had he told Potter the truth?
"Malfoy!" He heard someone called him. But, of course Draco knew whose voice it was. He stopped and looked back.
The now-perfectly-healed Unicorn was staring back at him. Once again it brushed its face to Draco's body and then hopped into the forest within.
Feeling fear for the Unicorn, and somehow a little pity, Draco made a risky decision. Unicorns were able to heal themselves naturally, thanks to their extremely powerful regeneration ability. The sooner the wound healed, the sooner the Unicorn could save itself from the predator. Strengthening his resolve, Draco took the wounded leg into his left hand, held it tightly, and with a brief warning to the Unicorn, Draco pulled the branch out of the leg and threw it far inside the forest, hoping the beast behind him would run off chasing the bloody branch. Well, it wasn't a dog, but worth the try.
Instantly Draco released his grip on Potter as Potter simultaneously pulled his arm away. Draco looked down at Potter. What he saw made him flinch. Potter was staring at him, pure fear in his eyes. "Potter? Are you all right?" Draco asked again. He reached out to touch Potter's shoulder, but the boy jumped backward with a gasp of shock. And then, making Draco wish he hadn't seen it, a tear slipped out of Potter's eye and trailed down his cheek, his chin, threatening to fall to the ground.
"You better hold me tight, Malfoy. That is, if you don't want to fall from above in the air." Potter laughed when Draco clutched onto Potter as if his life depended on it.
"Go on, take some. You haven't gotten your dinner, have you? There…" Draco put the truffles box on his lap and pulling out the rest of the wooden box contents.
They arrived in the forest in a clearing where a group of Hogwarts' magical creatures were lying around. Draco gasped when he saw the beasts. They were the same as the one Draco had met the day he'd saved the Unicorn. That creepy skeletal horse-like beast.
"She only kissed me twice. It was a mistake, really. I shouldn't have carried on. I thought that was what I wanted. That she was the right…" Potter finished his sentence with a dismissive shrug of his shoulders. "What about yourself, Malfoy? Oh, right, I forgot. You're the Ice Prince of Slytherin. Of course you had more than enough experience with…with…these things."
This Thursday passed without any incident for Draco. At mealtime, Potter joined him again. It seemed the dark-haired boy was still avoiding his Gryffindor friends.
When Draco finished his box, he unwillingly took out the apothecary papers and read them for two hours. A knock on the door took off his focus on the papers. He stood up and opened it but found no one.
Draco walked grimly to his quarters. He was sure that by lunch today, word would have spread Hogwarts-wide. As he arrived on the ground floor, Draco decided being alone was all he needed now. So instead of walking back to his room, Draco wandered toward the forest, his favorite escapade place. Somehow, it was secluded from the outside elements, even from extreme weather. When rain poured on Hogwarts badly, it only drizzled here. And when Hogwarts was veiled in white snow, it was a mere light snow beyond the trees. All in all, the hidden spot was cozy despite the winter.
Draco grabbed his bag on the ground and started to pick its contents which were scattered all over the floor. Potter handed him the last item of his possessions. Draco stared at the dark-haired boy. He wanted to say mind your own business, I don't need your help, or maybe thank you, but honestly he didn't know how he felt about all that.
"I'm sorry for the delay." Draco detached himself from Potter and then opened the gates' ward and let the group walk in.
"Come here, Potter." Draco turned to his side and put his arms around Potter, who had already wrapped himself around Draco the second the words had left the blond's mouth.
Draco gave the Ministry's owl a treat while he wrote a short reply, explaining that they could only transfer the artefacts from the Manor under his supervision. Therefore, it would be done on Saturday, when Draco was free. After the owl left the Great Hall to deliver his reply to the Ministry, Draco caught Potter giving him a questioning look. Draco lifted an eyebrow and gave the other boy a "not telling" face with a little smile. He broke eye-contact on hearing some squeals from his table. He looked down to the sixth year girls sitting at the other side of the Slytherin table. He rolled his eyes and sighed before standing up, and left the hall for the Charm class. What was wrong with the girls – especially the Slytherins – these days? Whenever he was around, they kept doing those stupid girl-things like gasping, squealing, blushing, stuttering, and Merlin knew what else. He knew he was awesome and perfect. But honestly, was he that irresistible that the girls had to gasp like they had asphyxia? It was getting worse this year than it had been before.
"Huh? Pull out? Wh—Oh!" Draco blushed in deep crimson as he realised that he was still inside Harry. Carefully he pulled out and disconnected with Harry. Harry pulled him down and kissed him then.
Canon: Draco was a talented wizard from a young age and possessed several impressive magical abilities.
Draco felt a strange feeling bubble up inside him. The gentle treatment Potter was giving him, and that soft expression on his face, made Draco want to forget about everything and focus his mind and body only to the boy beneath him. He wanted to get rid of everything that could take that look on Potter's face away from him. Unable to take in this new and intense feeling, Draco broke the kiss and buried his face into Potter's neck. He rubbed his nose into the warm neck, and then placed his lips against it. He trailed open-mouthed kisses on Potter's neck, up to the jaw line, then to the flushed cheek, then broke apart and stared down at Potter. Draco gazed in adoration at him; the person who had melted his cold heart. He wanted to know what the other boy was thinking right now. But he guessed Potter wouldn't appreciate it if he tried to pry inside his mind, so he kissed Potter's forehead instead.
"Not you, Potter. You are…" Draco shivered in full excitement and bewilderment. His eyes flickered as he continued and said, "An exception." Draco didn't give Potter any chance to speak. Soon as he finished his sentence, he pushed his tongue passed Potter's teeth and into that hot cavern; proceeded to stroke that addicting tongue of his.
"How long have you been standing there? And how did you find this place?" Draco pointed his wand at Potter. Salazar, he swore he would hex Potter if the boy had followed him here and had been watching him the whole time. But when Potter grinned and waved the Marauders' Map, Draco rolled his eyes and lowered his wand.
"That's enough!" Professor Dakarrt barked. "This is a class and you must behave yourself, Harper! Let what happened in the past stay in the past. Ten points from Slytherin for impoliteness in my class and for hostility to a fellow student! Class, continue your practice!" Dakarrt gave Draco a consoling look before returning to assist his students.
"What now?" Draco looked down at his wand. "Oh, it must be because you're here, Potter! You're distracting me!"
"So, Potter. How are you going to fix my mother's wand?" Draco turned his body so he was facing Potter properly.
When morning came, and both boys were awakened from their sleep, they didn't panic in each other's arms. Potter's face was hidden against Draco's neck. They let some minutes pass without motion, enjoying their warmth against the cold air of the winter morning. Draco didn't want to move from his current position, but eventually they had to get up. Detaching himself – though reluctantly – from Potter, Draco slipped out of the bed and grabbed his wand below his pillow. He casted
"…Potter? Please tell me you're trying to make a joke? Surely you know that won't happen, Potter! The wand chooses its master. Even if I force it to submit to me, it will never work properly." Draco looked at the younger boy in disbelief.
"I need it back. My mother's wand isn't really…compliant to me. It doesn't give the desired result when I use it to cast complex spells."
"I say you have the right to do so, Potter. I think you need some time alone now. I'll see you…tomorrow then?" Draco hesitated to ask next, but he thought it was the right thing to do right now. "Or, er…if you need company, I…"
"The Elder Wand is unique. Unlike common wands, it has its own mind. Sometimes I myself couldn't understand it. It acted of its own accord. Such a naughty wand, don't you think?" Dumbledore portrait chuckled and then returned to his slumber.
"Turn around this instance and get your arse in this bed, Potter!" Draco ordered Potter when the boy started towards the White Room.
"Wow, Potter, for a second I thought it looked like the remnants of my wand." Draco's voice was very flat.
Apparently Draco didn't need to ask his parents' approval for Harry because their indirect verbal and nonverbal gestures had shown him that they accepted Draco's choice open arms.
Draco took the hand without hesitation and pushed himself up on his feet. He checked his robe and made little gestures to brush any existent or imaginary dust. He saw Potter take his bag from the cold floor and handed it to Draco.
"All right. Let's go then. It's so cold here!" Potter rubbed his upper arms up and down in a quick motion.
Dinner at the Great Hall was as usual – noisy, owls flying in and out delivering letters and packages to their owners. That night Draco saw Potter take a seat at the Ravenclaw table beside Luna Lovegood. Draco himself sat near Millicent, trying to dig information about "interesting" events at Hogsmeade; specifically about the Potter-and-Weaselette incident. It turned out that the Weaselette had caught on that Potter was wearing a scarf that wasn't his nor his friends'. The Weaselette had pulled it off of Potter and smelt foreign fragrances from it. She'd asked Potter whose scarf was it but instead of giving her an answer, Potter had asked her to give it back to him. Suspecting it was from another girl, the Weaselette threw it to the ground and then stomped on it hard. Potter got mad and grabbed the sca-
"If you really cared about him, he wouldn't be hiding from you now, would he?" And with that, Draco closed his door, ignoring whatever Granger and Weasel were about to say in their defense. Draco casted Tempus and was surprised at the time shown.
"What's wrong Malfoy? Can't get your dark mind off right?" Harper shouted from one corner of the class. Silence came and all eyes fell on Draco. Draco looked up at the seventh year Slytherin. He glared at the wizard with his cold silvery eyes. Everyone who saw the glare shuddered. The tension was broken by the professor.
Draco had to close his eyes. The high speed caused the wind to deafen his ears and forced him to close his eyes. Draco tightened his arms around Potter's waist as it was pretty difficult to keep balance on the beast's slick back. He couldn't see where they were flying to.
"T-thanks." Potter didn't remove his hand from the scarf, nor asked Draco to take his hand off of him.
As they entered the Great Hall, words about Potter wearing a Malfoy ring were resonating throughout the hall, but it went silent as soon as he and Potter came in. Potter must feel uncomfortable with everybody looking at them like that, Draco thought. So he released Potter- no, Harry, because it was Harry now, slowly. However, a second later Draco smiled smugly and walked to the Slytherin table with Potter gripping his hand firmly.
A moment of silence passed before Draco stood up and walked toward the desk. He opened the drawer and pulled out the new edition of Quidditch and Potions magazines and walked back to the bed.
The incantation was called out and then from the tip of Draco's wand a mist of silvery light whipped out. After the silvery mist had disappeared, Potter spoke again, not moving from behind him.
Curious, or maybe he was losing his sanity at the lack of breakfast and lunch, Draco turned back his body facing the plaintive sound. Trying to stroll stealthily, Draco moved his feet to the deeper forest, the trees thickening as he moved inward. The air around him felt cold and heavy. He clutched to his bag, walking deeper into the tall woods. And then he saw it.
"You have plans today, Draco," Narcissa said, more a statement than a question, as she buttered her bread.
Soon the two of them left the cave and Potter summoned Tenebrus, then they left the freezing rocky mountain. The Elder Wand was nestled peacefully in Draco's pocket.
"It's been acting weird. When I tried to break it, it didn't crack even a bit. And then this morning I used it to repair Mrs. Malfoy's broken wand with it. It worked. And then when Malfoy tried to break the Elder Wand, it went berserk. It stung my hand when I held it, and it reduced Malfoy's broken wand to ashes. It kept shaking then. And then Malfoy took it and it stopped. We don't know what to do with it, Professor. I was afraid it would do damage if I just left it. So, we brought it here," Potter explained to Dumbledore's portrait.
Draco and Potter arrived at the Thestrals' clearing in the forest at noon. As they climbed off of the Thestral, the creature tucked its head against Draco's silver-blond one.
"Ahh!" Suddenly Draco felt a great pain on his left forearm. It felt like a thousand needles thrusting inside his skin. He clutched his left wrist hard.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw the Hogwarts staffs were beginning to leave their seats. Draco rose to his feet and walked to the front of the hall.
"Did this happen when you tried to break it?" Draco whispered back and saw Potter shake his head. "Hurry, put it back into the wall!"
Draco threw his bag and robe to the desk and then lay down on the unoccupied bed. His mind was wandering from the Daily Prophet to Potter. Today's events with Potter were a big confusing to Draco. He thought about his attraction toward the dark-haired boy in the past seven years studiously.
Draco hoped the ex-Death Eaters weren't making their way toward the Manor. What if they planned to attack his parents? He still had his mother's wand on him! Forgetting his breakfast, Draco dashed out to the castle's gates. But wait. If the ex-Death Eaters were invading Hogsmeade, the gate must be closed and guarded and he wouldn't be able to Disapparate to the manor.
Draco had lunch with Potter and his parents before they had to return to Hogwarts at four. After lunch, the two of them went back to the left wing and chatted leisurely. When afternoon came, Draco walked to his room for his trunk. He didn't ask Tippy to take it because he didn't like anyone, even house-elves, entering his room. After he'd shrunken his trunk and pocketed it, Draco walked to the entrance hall of the left wing where Potter stood and was looking outside the window. Draco smirked and approached the younger boy stealthily. He stood behind Potter and then slipped his arms around Potter's waist.
"How is that…Wait. Potter, are you saying that there's a wand master who can fix broken wands out there? If that's true, Potter, in case you're completely ignorant about your surroundings, no wand masters accept Malfoys in their shop now. Our name is ostracized from their shops."
After brewing for sixty-six minutes and six second, it was time to stir the potion with wand movement. Hopefully his wand would cooperate with him. For once, it did, and Draco was unbelievably relieved. When he looked around, he caught Potter's eyes. The said boy averted his eyes swiftly to his own cauldron when Draco caught him staring. Draco raised his eyebrow. How long the boy had been staring at him, was the first question to come to Draco's mind. His eyes lingered on the dark haired boy for a few seconds before he returned his gaze to his own cauldron.
After the seventh movement, he turned the movement counter clockwise and began to chant the incantation for the second time.
Harper marched past him, brushing Draco's shoulder with a force that caused Draco to trip and bump into the window glass with a hard thud.
"Nonsense! Need I remind you, Potter, that you are different—I mean you are a special case. You've been under the Dark Lord's control for almost your whole lifetime, but you killed him. Now you should have the right to lose control and do whatever you want. So bollocks everyone else!" Draco hissed. Draco thought that the other boy would get mad or deny everything he had said, but instead Potter giggled. Giggles that then morphed into full-blown laughter.
years house was plain without any of the Hogwarts Houses' attributes. The only entertaining decoration was the clear glass prisms, in the common room and the hallway, that refracted and dispersed natural light into waves of crystal-clear illumination. Exactly the lighting concept Draco fitted to his private cottage. Draco wondered if this floor had been used to keep Hogwarts guests. The elegant prisms decoration really was an impressive sight.
"Yeah. I think I've lost my mind. That's what everybody always says to me. So, sit down, Malfoy, and eat. That, or would you prefer to eat standing?" Potter looked up at Draco, lifting his eyebrows while biting his sandwich.
Draco returned to his walk and, Salazar, for the third time, he encountered Harper and his two minions on his way to the chambers. With a nasty touch of a jinx, Draco's bag flipped upside down and the contents fell down to the ground.
"Potter, can you hear me?" Draco saw Potter nod. "Good. Now listen to me. Because of your stupidity, you've made yourself fall into an eternal sleep. I can free you from this, if you are willing to submit to me. As soon as you awake, I will free you. Understand?"
"Er…accompanying Draco…?" Potter directed his words toward Draco, and Draco knew that the boy wanted approval from him but he would keep quiet.
"Oh, I do mind." Harper laughed, and it sounded ugly. The other two joined in bad synchronization. "Think we fear you, eh, Malfoy." The younger Slytherin spat at his name. "Tch, look at you now. No one's on your side. No more minions, Malfoy? Poor Malfoy. You're just nothing but a defenseless traitor. Traitor of the Dark Lord and the Wizarding World. No one wants you here, Malfoy. You're pathetic!"
"This is where we're gonna fix your mother's wand. Now, get down and start searching the cave." Potter climbed off the Thestral and told the beast to wait.
Knotting his tie, he still had half an hour before breakfast ended. As he walked out of the room, he noticed the place was deserted. It seemed that all other Eighth years had gone to the Great Hall. When he was about to open the entrance door, he heard a rustling sound and the next thing he knew the door flew open and slammed into him, pushed by a male student.
Draco was about to free himself from Potter when he felt the said boy stretch against his body and yawn. The arms encircling Draco's body were tightened. A second later, the boy went still. Draco counted until eleven before Potter raised his head up, very slowly. And then their eyes met.
At midnight that day, Draco was awakened by another sharp pain on his forearm. He hadn't tried the soothing vial his father had sent him. Draco took the vial out from his trunk and popped the lid. He poured the blue liquid three drops as his father had directed on his note and then smeared it on the red skin. Draco waited for some time.
"Alright?" Draco paused as the boy beneath him squeezing his eyes shot. Harry bit his plump bottom lip, whimpering in uncomfortable fashion. "Harry, this is your first this way?" Draco stopped and carefully tried to retrieve his finger back out. Mentally Draco slapped himself for asking such stupid question. Of
"I don't know where else I should go, Draco. I don't have any other relatives," Harry said in husky voice.
"Well, um…I really don't want to see Ginny and I think she was on her way here so please can you let me in?" Potter said in a rush.
The boy straddled the bench beside his two friends who had been busy eating since Draco came. They sat at the bench opposite Draco's.
"What, Potter! Don't try and stop me. I don't care if you tell McGonagall, I'm still leaving. The ex-Death Eaters are probably on their way to the manor right now. So go away and let me leave. Go, Tenebrus!" Draco cried.
As Draco heard the whispered charm, warmth immediately embraced him. He gasped in appreciation. He saw Potter's face turned red. Draco wondered if the charm was so strong that its effect radiated out of his body, causing the dark-haired boy to have a touch of the warmth that tinted Potter's rosy cheeks to red.
The sound of the scratch of the quill on parchment was lulling to Draco's ears. He didn't realize it until sometime later when he'd fallen asleep by it. Draco opened his eyes hours later, possibly in the middle of the night. He must have fallen asleep while he read the boring papers. He thought the sitting position against the wall, wearing his body out, might have woken him up. But as his awareness returned, he realized that that wasn't the cause of his awaking. It was a cry in his room. Then he remembered Potter. Draco grabbed his wand and lightened the room. What he saw and heard before him broke his heart.
"Yes." Potter stopped. "Right, I forgot. I don't know if this will work for you, but just trust me okay?"
Draco released Potter's wrist and then cancelled the silencing bubble secretly. Draco scoffed at Granger, and when he heard Weasel ask him why he'd been gripping Potter's hand, Draco gave him another scoff.
All of them were speechless. No one dared to chase Potter. Draco grabbed the parchment from the ground and came after Potter.
Potter's hand slipped through Draco's hair; his other hand planted on Draco's neck. Draco himself tightened his arms around the other boy. If they kept doing this, in no time Draco would master the art of kissing. And as if reading his mind, Potter murmured how good Draco was at this. Draco broke their kiss and looked at Potter, scrutinizing him carefully.
"You're going to the manor again?" Potter asked, and added immediately as Draco stopped walking, "Hermione told me."
In times like that, when he saw the peacefulness on the boy's face, or when the boy smiled and laughed merrily, Draco would do anything to make sure that that happiness never left the boy. Until now, Draco still got shocked and confused whenever he'd feel that way toward Potter. Ever since he'd heard the Dark Lord's blabber about Potter when the man slipped into his mind, pity, turned into remorse and then anger, arose within Draco.
No, wait. Why did Potter look so happy lately? Had he and the Weaselette settled their differences and got together? Now that disturbed Draco. He should go and find Peeves immediately.
"Malfoy, can you hold my wand for a moment?" Potter stopped at the cave's stony wall. Draco took the shining wand, watching Potter slip his hand to a small but wide crack on the stone wall. A moment later Potter's hand reappeared and was now holding a wand.
A sudden silence took Draco's attention from his plate. He looked up and saw the cause was none other than Potter walking toward Slytherin table. More specifically, toward where he was seated.
"Do you really like it?" Draco asked when Potter rolled the ring around his finger. He watched the ring be slowly pulled to the tip of the finger and felt a pang at Potter's sadness. "I didn't ask you to give me the ring, Potter. Yet." Draco said quickly before the ring had slipped entirely from Potter's middle finger.
"Potter, you can take your robe off. It's not cold here," Draco told the dark-haired boy as he wrote something on a small piece of parchment and then put it inside the box before he closed it again.
"What do you mean can I see them? Of course I can see them! You don't have to use spectacles to see the…the what, anyway?" Draco said, agitated by the question.
The next morning Draco woke up before Potter, the latter still sleeping in his arms. And on waking up, he was finally clear-headed enough to process the big revelation about the Boy Who Lived last night, which had surely changed Draco's view of Harry Potter. Draco recalled all the taunting he'd thrown toward Potter in the past seven years and he felt sick with himself. He couldn't imagine being in Potter's place. Being alone, neglected and abused since he was a baby. Oh Merlin, he felt a sudden rush of great affection toward his parents and – finally Draco accepted the feeling – toward Potter. He tightened his grip around the other boy protectively.
Draco was corpse pale. Potter was ready with his wand in case he needed to cast a Levicorpus for the taller boy if the blond fainted in shock. Draco felt his legs had very much turned into jelly. But, no, he could control himself. He would stand straight, no panic, no scream, no tears. He took a hold on the door frame, steadying his heartbeat and voice.
"Tippy!" Draco shouted, summoning his personal house-elf. A loud pop echoed around the room and the house-elf appeared before Draco.
Prince, Potter," Draco snapped, emphasizing the word 'ice' as he narrowed his eyes. "I have no interest in any form of romantic acts or relationships. I'm a pure blood, a Malfoy. We don't play around. We don't kiss and sleep around before marriage. Merlin knows what they want from me, a Malfoy; prime status and good fortune." Even just thinking about touching someone made Draco want to empty his stomach.
Oh Merlin! Centaur? But centaurs didn't have that kind of voice, did they? Draco swallowed. What if it was…a Hippogriff? Nah, those were further away to the east side, near Hagrid's hut. So was it just a normal horse then? But Draco never saw normal horses in the forest.
"Relax, Malfoy. It won't bite. Go try ask it yourself." Potter sounded like he was enjoying the scene, which was upsetting Draco even more.
Potter cast a silencing spell on the door. Then the Gryffindor threw himself and his bag to the unoccupied bed as though he owned the room. Or the bed. Draco felt his jaw had dropped, so he quickly schooled his face again.
"Freezing hell! Potter, where are we?" Draco unconsciously stuck his body from head to toe against Potter, seeking warmth. His heart was beating fast; must be because of the highness.
"Shut up, Weasley." Draco pulled Potter closer. "Come on, Po- Harry. I'm starving." And Draco dragged the other boy to the Great Hall along with him.
"It's fine. You're cold." Draco put his hand gently on Potter's to stop him from disengaging the scarf from his neck. Draco's hand lingered far too long for appropriateness.
"Merlin, that's awesome! No wonder you were missing a lot at meal times! If I had one, I wouldn't want to get out of my room unless for classes! I'd be quite content with this box in my room." Potter swallowed another piece of the sweets and gazed at the wooden box dreamily.
Hasty steps echoed through the corridor. A familiar sigh caught Draco's ears and he stepped out of the darkened alcove before the entrance door of their new chambers.
The next morning Draco woke up in a foul mood. The bed sheets were the trigger. He craved for the premium quality of silky sheets of his bed at the manor. It upset him. His father should hear about-
"Oh, come on, Potter. You had treacle tart two days ago." Draco smirked when he saw Potter surprised that he knew exactly his thoughts.
The former headmaster's portrait was asleep in his armchair. He opened his eyes after McGonagall called him.
"Potter, we'll bring them to the Ministry." Draco told Potter, and then ordered Tippy to bring him the aforementioned letter.
A knock on his door brought him to awareness. He opened the door and saw Potter fidgeting on his feet.
Draco returned to his room when dinner was eaten. He'd just wait for Potter to join him there and then he'd ask him what had happened today.
"Honestly, Harry, you don't know him? He's the greatest potions master ever live in England!" Draco's eyes popped up.
"We're gonna ride this Thestral to reach the place where we'll fix your mother's wand." Potter then said something into the Thestral's ear and climbed up. "Come on, Malfoy."
At six o'clock they had dinner in the master dining room with Draco's parents. The whole time Lucius gave annoying stare at the ring on Harry's finger. Narcissa and Draco ignored him though and they talked conversationally about Draco's and Harry's training programs. When the dinner ended, Narcissa took Draco and Harry to the Receiving Room and talked about the Grimauld Place.
So he just sighed instead. He decided to take a long bath in the en suite small bathroom of his room. Oh the joy of not having a roommate. He could stay in the bathroom as long as he wanted.
"Bloody hell! Potter, you'll pay for this!" Draco reluctantly removed his platinum ring and whispered the Latin incantation that parted it into two. He put back on the ring with the Malfoy crest and slipped the other one around Potter's middle finger. After he saw swirl of magic from the ring seeped into Potter and a faint of magic spark around Potter's neck, Draco repeated his earlier command and when Potter nodded, Draco returned to the dungeon and got back to work.
"Haven't finished yet, you two? Anyway, guess what, Filch found Harper in the dungeon," said the boy.
"Yeah. After hearing from you, I think I'll give it a try." Harry trailed Draco's neck with his fingertips. He added, "And don't say that you are right."
"Oh, that's all right, dear. You better go now, then." Narcissa gave Draco a motherly hug. "And thank you, Mr. Potter."
"What happened actually, Malfoy?" Potter was staring at Draco's arm. They were now sat on Draco's bed facing each other.
"Expecting you will stand on the aisle and take their daughter's hand seems to me more like a demand than a simple wish, Potter." Draco tilted his head to him.
. A dizzy spin later, he was inside Potter's mind. Draco blocked himself from the floods of memories inside the other's head and focused to find a particular spot where Potter might be hiding away. It didn't take Draco long to find the place. At first, he was ignoring it, thinking that it was just a memory having slipped into his block. But the place appeared again and again everywhere Draco searched, and eventually Draco found himself standing before a cupboard below stairs. What an odd place to choose as a shelter.
Time went by fast in the freezing air, and finally they landed before the manor's gates. Draco jumped off from the beast and ran toward the gates. He stopped two feet from the gate and closed his eyes. He reached forward and felt the ward vibrating, telling him that the manor had visitors. Draco's eyes snapped open.
"I'll ask Aunt Andromeda to move there with Teddy." Harry saw Draco's furrow at the mention of Teddy, "Teddy is my godson and he's your cousin's son, Draco."
"Ginny pulled it off me and then threw it and…" And then she stomped her big foot on it. That was what Potter's magic was saying as it swirled around them restlessly.
Draco scowled, but in truth he was very impressed by Potter's perceptiveness. He had only just figured it out after Potter had asked him the question.
It was too late for Draco to be surprised at the memories his mind had pulled up, and when he casted the incantation, a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the tip of his wand. Astounded, Draco stepped backward, only to have his body held by Potter behind him. The shadow disappeared as suddenly as it had come, his concentration broken.
Draco took the basket cover made from cloth material, put it down in front of him and then resized it enough for them to sit on it. He grabbed the basket, placed it on the wide cloth layer then sat beside it to have his lunch. Potter grinned and sat on the cloth, facing Draco.
To stop the annoying boy from repeating himself, Draco concentrated hard on the memory of when he had pulled out his Render box and Potter had gasped at it. Successfully showing off and amazing the Gryffindor never failed to make Draco smug and happy.
"Potter, I will keep waiting here until you give me back my wand." Draco crossed his arms before his chest.
Tractura Vesania: made up potion. Draught of Insanity. Causes the drinker temporally lose their memory before memories mixed creating completely false memories, thus falls to insanity. The cure is three-fourth-time brewed Elixir of Life simultaneously mixed with Peace.
Thinking that he didn't want to lose what was probably his only chance to fly out of Hogwarts' grounds, Draco signaled for the Thestral to take off. A second later, the beast kicked off the ground and diligently carried them to the manor.
"Oh, one more thing, Draco. Try not to vanish too much of the manor's plates and glasses. They're my favorite." Narcissa smiled at her son.
Draco felt there was something he had to do after returning from the Manor, but waved it away. Maybe it was only the urge to murder Potter for troubling him at the Manor.
"Wow. Where did you get this? Wait, is that…" Draco leant closer to the map. "Merlin! Potter, the moving labels are – it's our names!" Draco pointed at the left side of the Hogwarts map. More specifically at Draco's room in their chambers. The map was showing the fifth floor of the West wing.
"Tomorrow, Saturday, are you going to Hogsmeade? The headmistress has allowed us all to visit again." Draco turned his head and watched Potter who was lying on the other bed. The boy definitely looked sleepy.
Draco waited as Harry pretended to think hard. He narrowed his eyes however, when Harry mentioned the Weasel family. He knew that the boy was teasing him. But to just think that Harry would live under the same roof as the Weaselette, it made Draco's stomach fluttering in panic. He grabbed Harry's hair and pulled down, brought the boy's face upward and hissed against Harry's lips.
"It's all right. You were dreaming, Potter. You're awake now. It's all right." Draco put his hands on Potter's body. The boy was trembling.
"Potter, if I could share the small bed at Hogwarts with you, surely there's a lot more room for you in this massive bed!" Draco stared at Potter wide-eyed in disbelief.
"You're welcome." Potter plucked his favorite dessert with the fork and put the big chunk to his mouth. "Mm, so good, Malfoy."
"Potter, you sound very insistent to fix my wand." Draco saw Potter flush. "Oh, I see. Guilty feeling of a hero complex of yours."
"The person who hexed him took Harper's robe! The guy was as white as sheet! You know how cold it is in the dungeon in winter," the boy told them and the three shuddered.
"There will be no next time for this, understood? Now get back to your chambers." McGonagall shook her head. "Oh, Mr. Malfoy," Draco turned back to look at the headmistress. "Do you have your own wand now?" McGonagall asked.
"Come in, Potter." Draco opened his room's door for the bewildered boy standing before him. Hesitantly Potter came inside the room. Draco threw his bag to the desk. It landed with a mild thud. He proceeded to free himself from his robe and then opened his trunk and pulled out a box the size of a Care of Magical Creatures book. He hopped onto the unoccupied bed, which was near the desk and the door. He put the dark wooden box on the bed in front of him where he sat with his legs tucked in.
"What? I am capable of showing emotion, Potter. Malfoys are able to feel emotions, too." Draco furrowed his brow in mock affront at being insulted by a stupid Gryffindor.
"Shut up, Malfoy!" Potter blushed and started to write. Draco shook his head. He took his own papers and stood up.
"Oh, please, Potter. I didn't kill the white horse, if that's what you are thinking." Draco rolled his eyes. "I was in the forest on Tuesday. And then I saw the Unicorn. A branch jabbed into its leg. So, I helped a bit and when I pulled out the branch, the blood poured onto my arm."
At first Draco didn't like the idea of hanging around with Harry's friends – Granger said it was to make Harry study for his N.E.W.T.s – but it was better than holing himself up in his room alone, he supposed. If he was given the option, Draco preferred to be with Harry and tutor him alone in his room; Granger insisted they didn't, saying that the two of them would occupy their time with snogging rather than studying. However, and surprisingly enough, times with Harry's friends were almost bearable, because Draco could talk about lessons with Granger while Harry and Weasel played or debated over something completely silly and useless. Granger also gave Draco very good advice as to how to motivate Harry effectively to study for his N.E.W.T.s.
"Seriously! Who would be that stupid enough to hex Harper? He's nasty and everyone knows that!" the other boy's friend asked.
What was that! Draco had never seen anything like it before! Not even in the Care for Magical Creatures class. Hippogriff? No, it wasn't. Though, it had the same pointy beak. Oh Merlin was the thing going to eat him alive? Thinking quick, Draco did what he hoped was the right thing to do. He lowered his torso and gave the beast a respectful bow, while keeping eye contact. The beast cocked its head and then looked away.
and the room was illuminated brightly, Draco's heart almost jumped out of his mouth. He calmed down as he stared at the emerald eyes and recognised them quickly as Potter's. Draco inhaled deeply and exhaled hard a few times until he was completely calm, though his body was still shaking.
"Don't spoil your night with this git, father. I'll take him to my wing and…take care of him." Draco bid his parents goodnight and dragged Potter from the entrance hall to the left wing of the Manor.
"Yeah, mate, but you don't have to do a favor for the ferret. Come on." Weasel pulled Potter by the wrist.
"Ah! Now, Draco, cast the same spell with the wand." Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. Draco took the wand from Potter and as soon as he gripped it, the light beam shone from its tip.
!" Harper shouted, and Draco fell to the floor. He threw Draco's bag hard to the petrified Draco. He kicked his senior and then the three seventh year Slytherins stomped out of the class.
As he arrived in the Great Hall, the big room was in a ruckus. He walked toward the Slytherin table and took a seat in his favorite spot. He turned to his left and watched the fifth year girls talk over an article of the Daily Prophet they were holding.
"Oh." Draco remembered his mother told him about the late Nymphadora Tonk last year. "And you, Harry, where will you stay?"
"Don't forget to wear your warmest outfit tomorrow," Potter told the blond. Draco raised his eyebrow, but Potter gave no elaboration to his words. Potter put his glass on the desk, beside Draco's. The Gryffindor touched the parchment with his wand. "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," Potter whispered. At once, thin ink lines began to spread from the point Potter's wand had touched. Then the empty parchment showed them their chambers. Potter sighed at the map.
Perhaps due to the kiss and Potter's dazzling smile, and with the addition of his recalled memories, Draco's head felt light. A moment later Draco found his hand carded through Potter's hair, and he was kissing the other boy deeply. In response, Potter wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and pulled him closer so that they were connected from head to toe. Then Draco wrapped his right arm around Potter's waist, his hand still holding his wand. Their kiss was deep and slow and it sent an electric wave down Draco's spine. Stroking Potter's upper lip with his tongue, Draco separated their mouths carefully. With his face hovering Potter's, the Slytherin's eyes bore into emerald orbs.
"C-can I sleep here?" Potter's eyes were on Draco's lips. He was trembling and sweating. His voice was that of scared little boy who had woken up from a bad dream. Potter had had a nightmare.
Draco turned in his mother's direction. A wizard with an Auror robe wrapped around his body. The Auror pointed his wand to Draco's mother.
His senses returned full on when he heard something from afar. He rose up abruptly in alert. He was in the Forbidden Forest, possibly noon at its peak, alone, and without a wand. He gulped. He better- No, he had to leave the forest now!
"Oh God, yes! Yes, Draco I want it! Oh God I love you!" And then Harry froze for his slip tongue. "I mean, I— I'm so happy it's just an expression—"
"Oh." Potter relaxed. "I slept there until I was eleven. Malfoy are you really all right? You look like you've just seen a Dementor."
"I thought you said to prepare with the warmest outfit for today. Why are you only wearing…is that jean jacket, Potter?" Draco narrowed his eyes. He walked approaching Potter.
, Potter." Harper sneered. He smirked widely when the class murmured about the validity of the information, some accusing Draco of being a Death Eater.
"As long as you're happy, mate." Weasel looked at Potter. "But, really, Harry, does it have to be Malfoy?"
"Hmm, maybe I should read the new edition of Hogwarts: A History. Who knows what else lurks along with the newly-revealed hidden chambers in Hogwarts." He proceeded to the bathroom.
"I didn't bring food here, Harry. So if you're hungry we must go back to the manor." Draco told the boy sat beside him who put his head on Draco's shoulder and playing with his ring. Draco himself was stroking Harry's hair. He liked putting his hand through the smooth dark hair.
"Makes it easier, father. Can find him and smack his head spot on if he wanders around the Manor." Draco glanced at Potter who was sitting uncomfortably beside him.
since his third year. The Gryffindor boy was looking back at him. Draco looked away with his wand hand dangling at his side.
His skin wasn't as hurt as this afternoon. Since Tuesday, the great pains lasted only about a minute before subsiding to a bearable, constant state.
Draco was about to throw the seventh year Slytherin a painful curse, but stopped mid-raising of his wand when Potter shouted from another corner of the class.
Now, where did that thought come from? Draco pinched himself mentally. Slowly, he removed his hand from Potter's lap, brushing his warm legs in process. Draco's hand stopped on the Elder Wand. Draco grabbed it without breaking eye contact with Potter. He raised the wand and pointed it to his trunk.
to the object. The shrunken object returned to its original size and Draco stared at his green cashmere scarf. There was the clear dirty imprint of a foot on it.
"Show it!" Weaselette barked at the centre of the class. Potter's jaw dropped, and he looked at her with a horrified look on his face. "If you were not a Death Eater, show us your left arm!" Weaselette walked quickly toward Draco and without a word she grabbed Draco's left wrist and yanked up his sleeve, exposing his flawless pale skin. The whole class gasped at the revealing.
When kisses broken by the falling Harry to the deluxe bed because of Draco's eagerness to the body-connection, they didn't stop for long before Draco flung onto Harry and repeating the previous act in their new position. Slowly, Draco felt one of Harry's hands moved to his front and touching his buttons and because he couldn't and didn't want to think, he let Harry unbutton his shirt and took it off of him. Draco felt Harry's hands on his bare skin and he wanted to touch Harry's skin, too. Unceremoniously Draco took off Harry's flannel and T-shirt and threw them somewhere to the floor. Shoes were magically taken off of their feet. Their hands were roaming each other's body. Mouth creatively exploring other's body. Kissing, biting and licking every inches of the skin. And when it was Harry's turn to be on top of Draco, the silver-blond hair boy gasped and raised his upper body as he felt a touch of wet tongue on his bare thigh.
"Harry! Ahh!" Draco buried deep inside Harry and the wondrous feeling and acknowledgment of claiming Harry completely brought Draco beyond to the white world and he collapsed on top of Harry.
"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you! I'm sorry!" Potter shook his head; tears were now falling freely from his eyes.
Potter was his rival, check. Potter was his…enemy? Okay, check on that because of his father. Potter was an insufferable git, check. Potter was stupid, check. Potter was naturally charming, check. Potter had beautiful eyes, check. Potter with his rosy cheeks and red lips. Potter with his attractive shaggy, messy dark hair. Potter WAIT A MINUTE!
Draco stared at Potter, considering the idea. Though he wanted so much to stay at the manor a little longer, Draco's logic won over it.
"Potter, are you so ignorant of this thing's use?" Draco snatched Potter's wand from its master's grip and pointed it to the startled boy. "
"I'm fine. Just tired." Draco took a step back. "Right. Let's call it a night. To your room, Potter."
"Oh this is ridiculous! I'm calling Hagrid!" Draco reached for his bag on the ground and he startled by a weak cry as he was about to walk away.
!" A silvery mist-like light whipped out of the end of Draco's wand. Draco gasped, blinking several times until the silvery mist disappeared.
Potter lay on his side with his back facing Draco. Draco walked toward the sleeping boy, attempting to intrude in his mind again, wanting to dig up other memories. Suddenly he wanted to know everything about the boy. But seeing sweat pouring off Potter's forehead, he cut short on the
!" Potter shouted angrily. He clenched his fists and stared sharply at Draco. Granger and Weasel gave the boy questioning looks, and Draco saw the Weaselette throw Potter a disapproving glare. Whether Potter saw and noticed them or not, his eyes were locked on Draco. Even when Granger approached him and pulled his sleeve, Potter gave her no heed.
"I know what you're thinking, Malfoy. So let me make this easier for us. We can walk together, Harper would think twice to hex you again, and nobody gets near me if I'm with you. It's a win-win solution," Potter said firmly.
"Potter," Draco spat the name, "How you managed to not see me ever with your glasses is beyond my logic."
"Cool." Potter smiled wide at Draco and wiggled his eyebrows up and down. Draco laughed at the implication.
Once they'd arrived at their common room, Draco took a seat on an armchair in the corner of the room. Potter took the other armchair beside him, their seats separated with a coffee table. Mandy Brocklehurst and Lisa Turpin sat on the rug in front of the fireplace. At first they sat staring at Draco and Potter, judging how bizarre it was that the once-rivals could sit together in peace. Draco summoned a silencing bubble around him and Potter.
Potter knocked on the door. A moment later it opened itself and the both of them stepped inside. They saw no one there.
Three hours passed and Draco still couldn't sleep. His mind kept replaying Potter's horrible memories. Why had Potter never reported the abuse? Did his friends know about it? Did Dumbledore know about it? Mr. Hero, always keeping everything to himself, didn't he? Draco remembered when Potter said that he liked being in Draco's arms. Now he understood that it wasn't a playful statement. Potter never had someone to comfort and protect him ever since he'd been left with his Uncle and Aunt. It was always the other way around for the boy; he was always the one to protect and save others. Other people's wellbeing were his priority.
A magical string whirled from the wand's tip and twisted around the broken wand, wrapped the split point and then the broken wand was straightened, repaired. Draco dropped his jaw.
A second later Potter casted a warmer charm to the room. Draco pulled out his pocket watch from his pocket and checked the time.
Anger reflected in his silver eyes, hard and cold as steel. He wanted nothing more than to destroy that futile facade of a boy Harper. No one was allowed to undermine a Malfoy!
"W-what? I haven't even said the incantation!" Draco's brow furrowed, looking at the Elder Wand as if it had done something wrong.
around them before he asked the dark-haired boy's permission to tell McGonagall about his plan to fix Draco's wand.
Draco frowned. It was very unusual for Potter to let him enter his room. Why would he have to follow Potter for his wand? Potter could fetch it for him.
"Hey. Um, you're going back to the chambers, right? Better walk then. It's really cold outside." Potter initiated the walk by moving first, followed Draco.
"I see you have your point, Malfoy. Well, in your condition, I know it will be difficult to find you a wand. Have you talked to your Head of House?" McGonagall asked. She gazed to the sleeping ex-headmaster portrait, Albus Dumbledore.
"Feeling better?" Draco whispered softly into Potter's ear. The boy against his body nodded weakly. Draco loosened his arms to see him. He unlocked one of his arms from Potter and raised his hand. He grabbed Potter's chin and forced the boy's face up to look at him. His thumb brushed off a trail of tears from Potter's red cheek. For a moment, they stood staring at each other. Their faces were too close to each other's; Draco could feel hot air from Potter's breathing. Potter was blinking at Draco, holding his breath. At the many blinks he got, Draco lifted his eyebrows in question.
"Watch your step." Draco laughed heartily when he saw Harry jumped backward after he looked down. The floor was made by thick glasses. Below the thick glasses was a foot depth pool. The glasses were reflecting lights into the water, playing waves of lights dancing around inside the house. "Let's go upstairs."
After countless time, because Draco couldn't presume the time – the speed caused him to lose his sense of time – Draco felt the speed decrease sharply and then he felt a landing. As Draco opened his eyes, the landscape before his eyes was one he'd never seen before. They were in rocky mountains. High mountains. All veiled in the pureness of white snow. And it was freezing cold!
Draco woke up two hours later feeling so revived and content. He stretched his body, pressed him even closer against Harry. Hand that was nested beneath his shirt scratched his back with its nails.
On Saturday morning, Draco intended to visit the Trophy Hall where Peeves the Poltergeist was usually around. He walked out of his room at eight, when most of the students were just deserting Hogwarts for Hogsmeade. As he closed his door and walked toward the common room, he saw Granger sitting on the armchair.
Draco was panicking inside. Potter was kissing him! It made his body hot! Blood pumping through his vein with blinding speed! He couldn't breathe! His mind was closing down! Sweet Merlin!
"Now, gentlemen, you know ex-Death Eaters are out there. I didn't allow any students to leave Hogwarts this morning. How are you going to explain yourselves?" McGonagall sat on her chair before the standing Draco and Potter.
Draco thought about his childhood's happy memories. Slowly he felt the tense in his shoulders loosen.
The last thing he heard vaguely before Draco slipped into slumber was Harry saying the three words to him.
Draco raised his brows and the Gryffindor took it as a yes. Potter slipped on Draco's left side. Since Draco sat at the very edge of the seat and the other Slytherins always made a space with him, Potter squeezed between Draco and a fourth year Slytherin boy. A plate popped before Potter and the boy proceeded to serve himself a dinner.
"Malfoy…can I…can I stay in your room? This place reminds me of the…" Potter looked as though he were struggling to say the words. What had happened at the Manor last year, yes, Draco got it.
He let out a scream and bolted. The black horse-like beast was now face to face with him. From the corner of his eye, Draco noticed the Unicorn had risen up from the ground and was now standing firm. The Unicorn ducked the side of its head against Draco's cheek.
"Good night, Potter." Draco slipped beneath his covers and turned to his side, facing the wall. Didn't bother to close his curtain manually.
"Don't say sorry for what you didn't do, Potter!" Draco snapped. He often heard Potter apologize to people whose damages weren't even caused by any of Potter's actions. Draco felt disturbed by it somehow.
"Take a seat, Malfoy." McGonagall nodded to the armchair before her table as they arrived in her office.
"Think the Dark Lord would be stupid enough to mark his spy in the Ministry, Draco?" the Auror said in angst.
Draco tried his best to make his question sound light. He knew it was a sensitive topic for Potter. Potter's expression darkened. He looked away. Knowing that Draco wouldn't let it go until he got an answer, he gave a big sigh and bowed his head.
Draco stepped forward and took the three pieces of his wand and the velvet green pouch. He put the pieces into the emerald green pouch and left in silence. Potter saw him walk back to his room, which was at the far end of the boys' side of the chambers.
Harper raised his chin, forcing himself to look down at Draco from the tip of his nose. If this were any other situation, Draco would have laughed at how Harper tried to out-height him. A moment later Harper and his minions were gone.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes, but they were stuck onto that emerald gaze. Those green eyes were staring at him in awe and admiration. Draco tilted his head, searching for the meaning of those expressions. What made the other boy looking at him with such obvious emotions?
To entertain himself, Draco decided to enjoy the light reflections on the chambers' windows by sitting in a black armchair in the corner of the common room, observing the inhabitants. When he entered the common room, it fell silent. Eight students currently occupying the common room stopped their activities and turned their heads toward Draco. He raised his eyebrow elegantly in return and the group returned to their own activities.
"Of course it's my concern, Malfoy! You are my student!" McGonagall seemed shocked. "How about your parents? Have you told them yet?"
"I don't swing around and offer myself to random people, Potter! I have no desire to get involved with such animalistic activity. There's a reason they call me the
"Bloody Merlin!" Draco cursed himself mentally. How could he have forgotten about it at all! Now, how to explain it to Granger without giving away his forgetfulness? Wait. Was that why Potter had been acting weirdly these days? Did the boy think Draco gave it to him?
"How long has she been standing there?" Draco whispered to Potter as they walked toward the manor's entrance hall behind Narcissa.
"I can't believe it! Don't tell me that's your potions essay parchment, Potter!" Draco stared at the parchment laid on the bed in disbelief.
." The pieces rattled for a few second and then they went still on the ground. Nothing followed. Draco sighed grimly. He stared down at the wand in his grip.
"Did you not learn from school to not touch dark artefacts with your bare hands, Potter?" Lucius mocked.
"Mischief managed." Potter touched the map with the tip of his wand, and a moment later, the map became a blank parchment.
When they had entered their chambers, Potter was welcomed by Granger in the common room. Draco didn't stop to watch their reunion and walked straight to his room. He thought Potter would come to his room afterward, but he waited until dinner time and no one had knocked. So Draco left his room for the Great Hall for dinner. When he walked out of his room, Ron Weasley was coming out of his own room. Draco gave him a brief glance and he saw the other boy looking at him with the same flat expression as his. Draco moved a bit faster to out walk him and he noticed Weasel slowing down so they wouldn't meet on the way to dinner. When Draco arrived outside the Great Hall, he saw students gathered at a corner. He intended to ignore them and enter the Great Hall but stopped when he heard Weasel's yell.
The Patil sisters and Hannah Abbott sat on the fluffy rug before the fireplace, obviously gossiping about something. Neville Longbottom and Susan Bones were talking about Herbology. Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan and Michael Corner were discussing something that didn't sound interesting. He noticed the Golden Trio weren't around.
Draco took Potter to the White Room, which was located right beside his own room. The White Room was supposed for his intended but Draco didn't give a damn at this point for he was still in shock. After bidding the other boy good night, Draco entered his own room and got ready for the night.
Slowly but surely, Draco maneuvered their bodies so that he was now laid on top of Potter. The act caused Potter to kiss him aggressively. A hand was grabbing at Draco's hair hard. Another hand ran from his neck down to his back and stroking Draco's spine. And when the hand arrived on his lower back, it pressed hard, and both boys moaned at the sensation of Draco's hips pressed to Potter's thighs and his stomach to Potter's pelvis.
"No. Potter, you have avoided this before and I am hazarding an accurate guess that you will avoid me again later. So, now, Potter, for the last time, I ask you to give me back my wand." Draco was now staring the shorter boy sharp into his eyes. Potter swallowed.
Render Box." Draco said softly. A moment later the trunk opened and the bless box floating toward them and landed on the empty bed between Draco and Potter.
As the lesson began, Draco delicately brewed the Tractura Vesania, a N.E.W.T. level potion. If he might say, the potion should be classed as a potions master level as it was one of the few sophisticated potion ever invented in the Wizarding World. Well, so far. When he became a potions master, someday he would create potions that were so much more complex.
Draco made an inexplicable face, and told Potter to sleep because they had to wake up early for the train to Hogwarts.
"I haven't talk to Professor Slughorn. I don't think that it's his concern… And maybe it's not yours either, professor." Draco's face twitched.
"I won't leave you. Please, stop crying." Draco stroked the boy's back. He laid the boy back down in the bed and positioned himself beside him, still holding him in his arms. One of Draco's hand caressed Potter's damp hair. He kept caressing the boy, his head buried beneath Draco's chin, right up until he felt Potter's breaths slow down.
"Suit yourself, Potter. I'm going to take a shower." Draco then left the boy to have his shower. When he was finished and returned to the bedroom, he offered Potter to use his bathroom.
"Oh, don't worry. Thestral is fast. I've rode once to the Ministry Department in no time. Up!" Potter waved his hand toward Draco.
"Thank you. Professor, you've heard about my mother's wand. I can't find any substitute wand at the moment, professor. Attending wand-work classes in this situation seems…non-productive if I may say so, " Draco said to the point.
. He had to succeed today, because he was sure that Monday the DADA class would be at it again, and he didn't want to be humiliated again by Harper if he still wasn't able to cast the protection charm. But although he had practiced hours and focused his mind, he still couldn't make a string of light come out of his wand. He didn't understand why he couldn't do it. Was he picking the wrong memories? Could it be that all the things that were happy for him weren't actually categorized as happiness? Thinking about it now, he had always lived kept in darkness at the manor. Not to mention that he had been Marked there. Was that the cause? What if he took other memories outside the manor that categorized as happy? But what?
"Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, I hope you have a good explanation for this." The headmistress stepped on the stairs toward her office, followed by the two boys.
"Um…I don't know. They're completely random. But I guess…yeah, it's not specifically them. Just me fighting bad wizards and sometimes…I dreamed that I was left alone by everyone…" Harry looked down.
"Ginny, stop it!" Weasel moved toward his sister and yanked her hand from Potter. "That's enough, Ginny! Go to your room, now!" Weasel pulled her forcefully outside the corridor.
Potter then pulled out a velvet green pouch. He walked closer to Draco. When they were two feet apart, Potter withdrew the content from the pouch.
"What's wrong, Malfoy? Giving up already?" Harper's voice echoed loudly, stopping the entire class in whatever they were doing. When Draco gave him his trademark annoyed sneer, Harper opened his ugly mouth again; "Can't make it, eh, Malfoy? That's because you've been marked! A dark wizard is what you are." Harper snorted.
Draco noted that the first floor was also in perfect condition; just like the last time he made a visit. He walked and stood in the centre of the floor with Harry trailed behind.
curse hit him, Draco was shaking in agony in his dream, and the world seemed to vibrate along with his vision. The shaking intensified and cold sweat trailed from his forehead; Draco bolted up and awake with a silent cry.
"What made you think that I'm not happy? And why does it bother you?" Potter turned fully to him. The blond could feel the boy's eyes boring into his head. From the shuffle sound beside him, Draco could guess that Potter was leaning toward him and would remain in that position until Draco deigned to look back at him. Giving up his cowardice, Draco finally faced the other boy.
Anger, at himself because he pitied the boy, because he had caused the boy affliction, because that old Dumbledore knew about yet let the Muggles' torture go on – whatever the torture was –, and because the boy kept it to himself. He wondered if the Weasel and Granger knew about it. Now he really understood why purebloods despised and lowered Muggles. Muggles were worse than Death Eaters. And as if all that wasn't enough already, the discovery that Harry Potter was a Horcrux, that he was actually the Boy-Who-Lived-to-Die, somehow made Draco's heart stop beating. Was that what guilt felt like? Yes, he thought so. That's why he decided to return to Hogwarts and didn't join Blaise and Theo in Durmstrang. It was all because of this boy. Draco had determined to make it up, all his guilty feeling toward Potter, by staying in Hogwarts.
"Why did you hide it here? Why didn't you keep and use it?" Draco lifted his head slowly to see Potter.
. Ah, whatever, Draco thought. He'd finally managed to conjure a cloudy silver light anyway, which was much better than all the students in class the previous Friday who were only able to produce silvery strings. Minus some ex-members of the silly Dumbledore's Army, of course.
"At one point we would say it to each other eventually and until then I know it would get us sore and dying. So I'm making it easy for us and save a great time by saying it now. And when I say it, I mean it." Draco looked deep into Harry with his piercing eyes. Harry looked as if he wanted to say something but he couldn't manage to form any words from his mouth as a tear gathered in one corner of his eye and then it fell down on his rosy cheek. Before Draco's brain processed a reaction to take, his arms were full of the Gryffindor boy, sobbing into his warm neck.
"I don't know, Draco. I'm still haunted by the war. Maybe I get traumatized, so better avoid anything involving fight." Harry removed his folded arms from under his head and put them around his torso.
"Oh this is very good, Mr. Malfoy! So far, it seems like you'll be the only student to successfully brew this potion. Oh, such a lovely color."
"And what did you tell them about the house-elves?" Draco stood before Potter, only a foot away now.
"Well, like Mother said, let's enjoy the holiday." Draco stood up and walked to the backyard. He took a Firebolt and a Nimbus 2001 from the broomsticks room and handed the latter to Potter. "I like the sky in spring."
"Oh, did you see his gob smacked face when he saw your wand?" Potter giggled into Draco's ear as they took the same desk. Draco flushed. Not because of anger, but because Potter had spoken so close to his ear. Draco almost shivered.
He casted Tempus to see the time, and reasoned that he would owl the letter tomorrow, as his room didn't have a window to call his eagle owl, Icarus. He secured the letter into the drawer and decided to read the new released book of Advanced Level Alchemy before sleep.
"Well well, if it's not the mighty Malfoy. Not gonna fight back, are you? Oh, yeah, I forgot. He has no wand," Harper sniggered to his minions. The three of them laughed.
"They said we are all grown up now. I understand that they need more time alone. I don't mind at all. I've told them. But Ron keeps saying that I was selfish because he said I got spoiled and got too much attention from people around me my whole life. He said I couldn't expect them to always be by my side to look after me all the time. I didn't want any attention, Malfoy. I don't want it at all. I never demand anything from other people. I hate that people thought I was fragile. I hate all their fake admiration and care. I'm not that stupid and that blind that I'm not able to see that they only see me as a tool to keep their Wizarding World safe, Malfoy, I don't understand…I…" And Potter broke into tears.
Draco concentrated again on the Quidditch memories he had, and then said the incantation. Nothing happened. He tried again, but still his wand deceived him.
Draco checked his pocket watch. Thirteen minutes had passed. He looked inside his cauldron. The color was now silver. All right, this was it. One movement from his wand and the color would turn into transparent silver and then he was done with the potion.
When he was back to the bedroom, he heard a soft knock on the door. Draco opened his door but saw no one. Then something pushed him backward and it shut the door.
A third year Slytherin boy walked into the Great Hall and approached closer to his side of the table.
"Right, whatever. Now we better get back to the castle. Seriously, it's getting dark. I'm positive when we arrive, it'll be dinner time." His scarf now secured around the Gryffindor's neck, Draco let go of it and turned to head for the castle.
in amazement and from the corner of his eye he saw Potter stick out his tongue at Harper and grin at him. Draco held back the urge to roll his eyes and smack Potter's head simultaneously.
At one point during the trip toward their chambers, Draco confused himself by thinking, what on Merlin's name was he doing, acting friendly to Harry Potter? His ex-archrival! The boy who annoyed him to hell! The Gryffindor who always haunted his head! Merlin, he must be desperately alone that he talked with Potter now!
"Potter, wait! Don't be so hasty! One of them is an Auror. What makes you think that if the Minister sends Aurors here, there won't be other Death Eaters among them?" Draco hissed. He walked toward his father and handed his wand back to him. He then released his mother from the spell and handed his mother her wand.
"Potter, I'm sorry if I caused you trouble with what I said in the common room. But surely your friends took it wisely, didn't they?" Draco cupped Potter's cheek and turned the boy's face to his.
He must have fallen asleep. The light around him was brighter and warmer than before he'd arrived. What time was it now? He still had Advanced Arithmancy classes today.
"If anyone tries to cause harm to Master Lucius and Mistress Narcissa, you help Master Lucius and Mistress Narcissa to stop them." Draco commanded the house elves.
From the beginning of their Hogwarts year, all this time, he and Potter had always been sitting facing each other in the Great Hall. It was a purely innocent act, because he never noticed it nor intended to do it before. Had Potter noticed about this, too? Then Draco had a second realization. This whole time, in his Hogwarts years, never had in his mind, even for a second, strayed from Harry Potter. He had always compared anything and everything around him with Potter. He had always thought, 'what would Potter do if,' 'what would Potter think if Draco did something?'
"How did…When…" Draco looked down at his leg and his tailored trousers were none to be found. He noticed Harry had also lost his jeans.
"I thought I already told you to watch your step, Harper." Potter walked closer. "And the way I see it, you're on his way." Potter was now standing beside Draco.
"You said that as if you have enough experience to compare. Who was it? That Weaselette?" Draco scowled as he watched Potter's face scrunch up when he said the girl's nickname. That pleased Draco somehow, despite the nausea that the thought of Potter kissing Weaselette brought him.
Draco and his father began to rip the wards from the artefacts to release their family's claim over them, and then handed them to the Ministry group. Several long and tiring hours later, one of the Unspeakables told them to stop working. When he got the attention of everyone, the Unspeakable pointed his wand at Potter. All heads turned toward him; the boy was holding a necklace, sleeping on his feet.
"Anyway where did you get this box? I didn't know there were any in Diagon Alley." Potter bowed his head, studying the Delight on his lap. Draco suspected the boy's face had gone red.
Draco disagreed with the statement because the burnt on his arm said the opposite. But wait. Pure…. Of course! Fool of him! Draco cursed mentally. Such a pure thing as Unicorn blood would have a negative reaction to the dark magic attached to his skin! Draco grimaced.
Draco's eyes snapped open. Had he just heard Potter whisper his first name? And had the boy even been aware of it?
So after he changed into his clothes, he put his mother's wand into his pocked and walked out to the Great Hall. After breakfast, he intended to go to Hogsmeade, and from there, he would Disapparate to the manor to hand his mother's wand to her himself.
Professor McGonagall had officially become Draco's favorite teacher that night. Though, Draco felt annoyed by the glare Weaselette directed at Potter for the whole dinner. But that wasn't important and definitely not worth his time. Instead he watched the dark-haired boy eating treacle tart eagerly.
Draco sipped his tea while Potter enjoying his dinner. Draco always found Potter eating like a starving man. It really was starting to annoy him. He should teach Potter table manners someday. So when Potter finished his dinner, Draco took the chance to ask.
Potter lowered his body and grabbed the Elder Wand from the ground, only to have his hand get an electric shock.
"Not specifically about the Dark Lord or the Death Eaters?" Draco turned Harry's face to look at him.
"Woh! That felt good!" Potter stretched his body then took a seat beside Draco on bed. Draco eyed him.
Draco awakened in the middle of the night and whimpering in pain. His left forearm felt as if it was being burnt by a Fiendfyre flame. It hurt so much that Draco couldn't hold the pain in. He bolted up and screamed in his bed.
"There aren't. It's the Malfoys' heritage," Draco explained shortly. "Oh, and Potter, tell anyone about the box and you're history."
"You must attach to him an object of your personal belonging to complete the ownership, and I believe your scarf won't do." And though Narcissa demanded no explanation as to Potter wearing her son's scarf, she raised a meaningful eyebrow at him.
Draco walked into the Great Hall. It was eight thirty so the hall was half emptied now. He took a seat at the empty space at the Slytherin table, as near to the Hogwarts Staff table as possible. He took a chocolate pudding dessert as he looked around. Potter wasn't to be found anywhere in the Gryffindor side. Draco frowned as he saw Granger and the Weasels were there. It was a very unusual sight. Thinking about it, he rarely saw Potter with his friends since they returned to Hogwarts. Draco also noticed that Potter wasn't often seen around at meal times in the Great Hall.
"Don't you dare!" Draco looked at Harry threateningly and the brat grinning widely. He felt Harry looping his arms around his neck.
Before she noticed the absence of his favorite scarf that was always on his neck on cold days, Draco excused himself and walked out of the Great Hall. When he was back in his room, shortly after he'd closed his door, he heard a knock on the door. Draco opened the door and saw Potter standing before him, his breath short.
Arrived at his quarters, Draco locked himself in his room. He pulled out his mother's wand and put it on the desk before he sat on the chair. Should he write a letter to his mother immediately, or should he report this to the headmistress first?
, informing him that it was two in the morning. Draco got out from his bed and opened his door with some resentment at the interruption. Resentment turned into concern when he saw Potter.
"Potter, that sounds suspiciously like you'll involve something unavailable in Hogwarts." Draco saw a little shock in Potter's eyes. "Fine. I'll wait for Saturday. Until then, guess I'll have to watch my back."
After dinner, a warm relaxing shower had awaited Draco in his rooms. And when his body touched his bed, it was an auto-call to the land of dreams. Exhaustion was supposed to bring him no dreams, or at least random meaningless dreams. Apparently it didn't work with this mix of exhaustion and contact with dark artefacts at the Manor. After a long time devoid nightmares, finally they decided to visit Draco that night. Killing acts, curses, tortures, the spine-chilling act of the Dark Lord toward him; they were terrorizing Draco in his sleep. When the
"I…I took it from the floor when it slipped off from a jug and fell…" Potter mumbled, tugging sheepishly at his hair.
"T-the ex-Death Eaters. The ex-Death Eaters who were hiding since last year came out last night. The Aurors couldn't catch any of them yet. The Daily Prophet says they were tracked in Hogsmeade and could be wandering to Hogwarts," a blushing fifth year girl said. Her eyes reminded Draco of Daphne Greengrass'. Draco shuddered.
"Now now, behave young Malfoy." The Auror swung his wand above Draco's mother. "Doesn't matter who I am. What's important is that you're here. Now we can start the ritual." Then the Auror freed the three petrified dark wizards. One of the dark wizards snatched their stolen wands back from Draco and Potter, taking the two boys' wands in the process.
As they finished their breakfast, Draco put on his warmest outer. He eyed Potter taking his spectacles beside the pillow he'd used to sleep last night.
When they came back to their common room after that day's classes, Draco saw Ginny Weasley sitting on the couch.
Draco and Potter walked toward the Great Hall leisurely. In Draco's case, he felt reluctant to gather with the whole body of Hogwarts. He always took a seat at the edge of the table, near the entrance doors. Coming in first and escaping just at the right moment to avoid unwanted attention. And when he could, he would skip meal times. Chocolates and sweets from his mother were enough to keep his form and remain nutrient-fulfilled. What about Potter? Draco knew the Boy Who Lived Twice didn't like the attention the world gave him. He could see all those gestures of discomfort in Potter when crowds were fussing over him.
And then Draco realized something. Why was he kissing Potter? Why was he kissing a boy? He'd never been interested in girls nor boys before, so why now, and why Potter of all people? This was so strange. His heart was beating too quickly. His body was warm and tingling. His focus was only on the softness of Potter's lips, on Potter's warmth, on everything that was so completely Potter.
"Patronuses are magical guardians, remember? Generally, they take the shape of the animal with whom you share the deepest affinity. So, in my case, my family protects me. I'm a Malfoy, and-"
"Potter, look at me. Potter!" Draco replaced his hands to Potter's head and forced the boy to look at him. "Potter, tell me." When Potter tried to look away again, Draco gripped his hair and the boy's eyes were back on his. He inhaled a faint scent of spring.
Draco counted minutes as the boy in his arms kept crying, fighting and struggling to get himself free and Merlin only knew what the boy would do next. Meanwhile, Draco had to suppress the biting sensation on his skin as Potter's magic swirled and crawled around them.
"Your own fool choice. Anyway, what did you tell your friends last night about me?" Draco stepped closer.
"Concentrate hard on one happy memory." Potter whispered into Draco's ear. Draco shivered. If Potter kept doing that, Draco wouldn't be able to concentrate at all. "Concentrate!" he whispered again.
"Oh, Harry, stop looking at us like that. We're fine with you two together." Granger squeezed Potter's arm. Of course, both Draco and Potter were shocked by her statement.
"It means, Harry, that from the moment Draco disarmed me, he possessed the mastery of the Elder Wand and has not lost the claim since then." The portrait moved his eyes to Draco.
Draco clenched his jaw. Gently, he cradled the crying boy into his arms. Draco let the smaller boy cry mutely, as hard and long as he needed to.
"Let me see you hold it, Harry." Dumbledore's portrait ordered. Potter reached for the wand in Draco's hand. The wand stilled in Potter's grip.
"Croque Monsieur." Draco frowned. He wondered why the house elf had given him two slices of those messy sandwiches.
"How come you haven't—Merlin!" Draco opened his eyes so wide they hurt. "You haven't started it yet? Potter, the work was given last week. Seven days ago!"
Draco checked his pocket watch. He'd been buried in that book for hours. Turning his head to look to his right, he saw that Potter had fallen asleep against the headboard. The book had slipped from his hands and fallen on the bed beside him. Draco considered waking him up and telling him to reposition his body and lie on bed properly, but when he saw Potter's face, sleeping in such peace, Draco couldn't wake him.
"How is it, then?" Potter looked at Draco. Of course, Draco turned his head away. There was no way he was going to tell Potter he'd failed to cast a
The Thestral nudged Draco and in one swift motion Draco climbed up and straddled the beast behind Potter, afraid of the beast's pointed beak.
"You know," Draco walked closer, making the Gryffindor pause in his act. "I never really hated you, Potter."
The bright white, translucent form of an animal erupted from the tip of Draco's wand. And as it disconnected from Draco's wand, the bright shadow transformed into a fully formed – thing.
"I see. Very well, Malfoy. Go owl your parents and until we find a solution, I'll inform your professors that you are dismissed from any wand classes. But I suggest you attend the classes for the theoretical lessons, if not to participate in the wand practices. Now, out you go."
"No. Better not worry the Headmistress. They probably know we're not in Hogwarts. We should go back soon, after we hand these rats over to the Ministry." Draco looked back to his mother.
"Don't want to cause any more trouble for it. It has taken more than enough lives. Besides, I'm quite content with mine." Potter tipped his wand.
"Harry," Draco whispered into Potter's ear, and instantly the Gryffindor looked up at him with wide eyes. "Good. You're awake. Now get up!"
As Draco threw himself toward Potter, the dark-haired boy bolted up and gripped Draco's arms so tightly that it cut the flow of blood there. Potter was looking at Draco's eyes with his own wide orbs. Breaths short and fast, his heart was beating at a too rapid tempo.
"But—" Potter moved one step backward, only slightly separating from Draco, since the Slytherin's arms were still anchored around Potter. Potter blinked. "You're…okay. Really, really okay! I don't understand. Why…How?"
!" Slughorn pointed his wand to the liquid. The liquid was gone in instant. Draco's wand fell down the floor, cracked through the middle. Unconsciously he looked at Potter and their eyes met.
"All right. What did my mother do to you today?" Draco leaned over Potter so the boy wouldn't turn away.
Generously, Draco walked Harry to his bathroom and compliantly accompanying him in taking leisure shower and made them experiencing their first art of fellatio toward each other in the large Jacuzzi. After they got dressed, they walked downstairs and sat on the living room, enjoying the sea far across.
"It's been hurting as hell since Tuesday. And then last night was the climax." Draco stared at his arm.
. Before the ex-Death Eaters could shake off the surprise of the two boys' appearance, Draco disarmed the dark wizard who was casting the unforgivable curse to his father. Potter did the same to the other two dark wizards.
"Potter, we're Malfoys. We do show off." Draco smirked at the gaping Potter. "Besides, it's enchanted so it can only carry sustenance-related things here."
"And he will stay here with Draco until they return to Hogwarts, Lucius." Narcissa told her husband calmly, and shushed him when Lucius protested. Draco didn't understand how his once arrogant father could submit so easily to his wife now.
"Come on, Harry." Draco walked toward the house. He saw the other boy was following him behind, wide eyed and looked speechless. As they approached the house, the transparent wall exposed the living room on the right side, kitchen and the dining room on the left side, and a space with a grand piano in between. When they arrived at the entrance house, Draco opened a pair of glass doors and invited Harry in. Transparent glass walls were installed from the face of the house to the left side of the house, while the right side and the backside of the house were covered with blurry glasses walls. The whole impressive ground floor interior was designed in white with prisms installed around for the lights. Draco saw thin green rings of iris on Harry's eyes.
"Should I use you? I don't know if I'll get a new wand in the future. The possibility is… Should I really use you?" Draco stared blankly at the wand. Contemplating the nearly non-existent chance of having a new wand in the future, Draco took his mother's wand and pointed it to the Elder Wand.
A loud ring echoed inside Draco's head. It stopped when he awoke and opened his eyes. Five thirty, the alarm he'd set told him. He inhaled deep. Potter was still sleeping. Draco had to return to his room right now before other students got out of their rooms and caught him walking out from Potter's room. He shook Potter gently to wake him up, and five minutes later the boy was finally awake enough to reluctantly release the blond from his embrace. It was adorable; Draco had to admit it. He dropped a kiss on Potter's head and then walked out to his own room.
"Miss Weasley!" shouted Professor Dakarrt. "What exactly did you think you were doing to another student! Detention tonight, Miss Weasley! And if I catch any of you having any act of impoliteness to others, the Headmistress will hold the responsibility of your detention!"
"Guess we skipped breakfast again," Draco said to the boy who was still lying in bed. Potter said nothing, only stared at Draco's eyes. Only after Draco told him that they would be late for the first class at nine did Potter sit up and walk back to his own room.
"Well, I didn't think you'd want your wand back. Besides, its damage is…bad enough. I didn't think it could be fixed in any way. But your mother's wand is broken just the same as mine once…"
"Seriously, Potter, why are we doing this? Is what we are searching for a wizard's place?" Draco started to feel numb. "This is ridiculous! How could you not know where the-"
"He's faster than broomsticks, and I can't take any chances of being tracked by Apparating," Potter said patiently. "So, hurry up, Malfoy. We're gonna be making a long journey."
The blond gasped. Once again the scent of spring and fallen rain filled his lungs, the scent he recognised now as the scent of Potter's magic. Gravel on the ground and bushes and leaves rattled wildly, manifestations of the visual magic swirling around Potter. When Draco made a soft noise, the dark-haired boy turned around. His eyes were red, and his expression was one of pure anger.
Potter snapped his head from the ring and looked at Draco in deep disappointment. But, Draco thought, it was more of a sad face than a disappointed one after all. Merlin, his suspicions had been right. Potter thought it had been a gift to him. It was a priceless ring, yes, Draco knew that. But Potter didn't have to be that sad to not have it. He must have been offered much expensive stuff by his friends and relatives before, right? So why should he act as if he had lost a valuable thing?
"You can have one of my other beautiful rings, Potter, if you want. But not that one. It's…ah, supposed to be for my…uh…intended one." Draco scratched an imaginary itch on his forehead to hide his blushing face from Potter.
"Ah, did the Dark Lord not tell you? He had planned to make you his apprentice. Such a talented wizard you are, could be powerful if you wanted to work your magic. What a shame, wasting such a potential, Draco. Not good for the Dark Lord when he possesses you later." The Auror eyed Draco.
A magical string once again whirled out from the wand's tip and twisted each of the pieces, trying to unite all pieces into one stick of a wand. The magic string, however, soon dimmed out and was gone. Pieces of the wand lay motionless on the ground.
A moment later, the house-elf reappeared in front of him and gave him the book. Draco dismissed her, then took the thick book to his desk and opened it at the page he had previously bookmarked. At first, he read the book angrily, but as time went by Draco's foul mood diminished and he ended up enjoying his read. By the time he'd finished the Heart chapter, it was over dinnertime. With a sated sigh, Draco put the book away and took a shower. After he got dressed, Draco demanded an Apple pie to the Render box for his dinner. Done with his pie, he lay down on his bed, and, staring up at the canopy, folded his arms underneath his head.
"Meet your father at the library tomorrow to discuss about the Apothecary, Draco. Now, get back to your wing, boys! No more compromising situations of yours beyond your wing in the future." Narcissa gave the boys scrutinising glare before she left the room without waiting their replies.
