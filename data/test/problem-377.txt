“One,” Rosaline Snape began, counting on her fingers. “My favorite food is pasta with vodka sauce with cheese from the Robin Hood's Bay farmers market. Two,” she paused, considering. Harry watched as she finally made eye contact with her father, who was beginning to look murderous, but instead of crying and running for her life, as Harry was almost wont to do, even after all these years, the damn girl only grinned more widely as she cheekily continued.
TW: Implications of abuse
“I’ll miss this,” she decided, as she glanced over at Draco’s wide grin. “Seeing as I somehow doubt this behavior being deemed acceptable at Hogwarts.”
Harry and Ron were sprawled together on the sofa, taking a well deserved nap during the weekly Order meeting when the fireplace roared to life, startling them both into falling off the couch and onto the floor with a flurry of groggy curses and moans. A girl with dark hair rushed out, nearly tripping over her own feet in her rush to get to the kitchen, though it was clear she had only the vaguest idea of where the room was. Blearily, Harry watched as she struggled with indecision before her eyes lit up and she turned down the correct corridor, satisfaction lighting up her delicate features.
“I didn’t give permission!” Sirius roared, interrupting the older man. Harry flinched. Sirius’ mood swings had been, well,
. It was an old favorite of his. Rose liked the story, too, of course, but she’d rather he’d chosen something like
“How did you know it was Kreacher?”
Sirius couldn’t think of anything to say to that, it was obvious. Harry was going to go back upstairs (after a quick prayer for his godfather’s soul) when Kreacher appeared right next to him and scared him out of his wits.
The pain in Harry’s ankle began to subside and he breathed a sigh of relief. But Snape continued.
“Since I needed a reminder of your undying love, you utter prick. And those insults were dreadfully weak, honestly.”
After motioning for Draco to sit in the chair in front of the desk, Lucius began. “Something rather exciting is happening, son,” Lucius’ voice was intense, and his eyes were alight with a kind of passion Draco had never seen before. “A new golden age is fast approaching in our world, and our family will serve as its bannermen.”
(The problem with Rose was that she knew that Draco loved her more than life, but in her arrogance she often vastly underestimated how willing he was to overlook his adoration for her in pursuit of sweet, sweet revenge.)
“One day, I pray,” Narcissa sighed morosely. “I will say something critical and you will not turn around and prove the point.”
They were sitting in their living room when the Floo roared to life, Rose’s dad’s long legs spread out on their raggedy sofa and Rose laying on her stomach, tracing patterns on their hardwood floor as he read aloud from
upon her father in an ill attempt at charity in order to eat! Good day, Mrs. Weasley.”
Severus almost dropped the baby in shock. Near his son’s temple, still raw and bleeding, was a lightning-shaped scar, one that reeked of magic so dark, Severus’ mark flared to life. He muttered a Summoning Spell to procure the wand he had let fall to the floor thoughtlessly when he had first seen the ruined nursery.
--- upside down textbook. "As disappointing as always, I assume."
“Severus is right,” Draco sighed, ignoring both his mother’s indignant scoffing and his godfather’s self-satisfied smirk. “Jews don’t have godparents, so Mum can’t be Rose’s godmother. But there’s no reason that she can’t be referred to as Rose’s aunt or something because we are family, blood or no, and if Severus’ only argument is that the name
Draco left five minutes later, shooting Rose a grin before stepping into the fireplace. After he was gone, Rose turned towards her dad.
“And yet I can’t see a damn thing,” Her father smirked, bending over to press a kiss to the top of Rose’s head. “Be home before midnight. Try not to kill anyone.”
Draco huffed and stole her teacup in retaliation, taking a long drink.
“She looks fine, Severus,” Minerva said, laying a hand on his shoulder. “Perhaps--”
They'd been betrayed.
“Stand aside you silly girl,” Voldemort said impatiently, the cold high voice of her nightmares washing over her, chilling her more than Jonny’s screams. “Stand aside now.”

Muggleborns were. Even though Draco had
“You were… empaths, right?”
“Well, that’s understandable,” Remus said, a pensive look on his face. “He’s probably the most at risk out of the whole Order, being our only spy and all.”
“Yes, yes, you’ve all sorts of accolades, Dad, and dueling awards galore,” Rosaline waved her hand distractedly as she nabbed her father’s chair out from under him and stretched out her legs. “But I do actually have some news for the Order, you know.”

(BONUS ROUND: What did Rose whisper in Severus' ear?)
“Don’t you worry, Jonathan,” Severus told his son moments later, reassuring himself more than his son, who was as unconcerned as all hell having discovered the utter joy of yanking at Severus’ hair. Severus smiled softly. “We’ll get you checked up. You’ll be okay.”
“How bad are you?” Rose asked hesitantly. “At Hogwarts, I mean. What should I be expecting?”
“No,” he declared, his heart leaping to his throat as he tried to keep his eyes from watering. He bumped his forehead against Narcissa's. “I’m lucky to be

before closing her eyes and leaning back against his mum’s legs. Draco huffed out a quiet laugh, propping his head up on his knee to watch the show. The two of them had had this argument at least a dozen times, and while Draco was usually annoyed by it (especially when it happened during dinner, because Narcissa Malfoy had a bad habit of throwing things at Severus’ head when she was pissed, and when not using a wand, her aim was
Rose gasped at her father's retort, placing a hand to her chest dramatically in mock alarm, inwardly cackling at all the shocked looks thrown their way.
Remus opened his mouth to protest, but seemingly thought better of rehashing the same old quarrel and shook his head before turning to Harry. “Minerva seems to think she’s a good kid. So try not to give her too hard a time, alright Harry?”
Until he could implement his exit strategy, Draco had a role to play, and he knew it. He mostly managed by limiting his most distasteful behavior to people he actually disliked for reasons other than blood-status-- the Weasleys and Granger and Longbottom and, of course,
“Potter,” he spat out, venom laced in his words. Harry turned to look right into the man’s dark eyes, not allowing himself to be cowed. “Do tell your beloved

Rose’s jaw dropped. The look in her dad’s eyes told her that this was it. The moment had finally come, and Rose couldn’t care less about the situation that had caused it. Did that make her an insensitive person? Probably. But Snapes were hardly known for their altruism. She grabbed her dad’s hand and squeezed.
A cacophony a sound erupted at George's earnest proclamation.

“He doesn’t drink,” Draco replied, shrugging. “And he normally has alcohol banned from the Cottage entirely. You’re lucky he let you drink your own wine. I would’ve expected him to bin the entire bottle.”
And afterward? Even if he was acquitted, who in their right mind would entrust the care of the baby who somehow defeated the most powerful Dark wizard of their time to a former Death Eater?

“I’m sorry, Mrs. Weasley,” Rose said to the woman apologetically, taking a cue from Lupin and her bright red hair to surmise the woman’s name. “I hope I didn’t insult you. I was just surprised. Dad doesn’t really keep anything from me, so I just assumed… Well it won’t happen again.”
“Not him! Please, no, take me--- kill me instead---"
“Draco
, Severus, I won’t have it!”
Blocking out the flurry of mutters that erupted after she mentioned her rather infamous grandmother, Rose snuck a look at Jonathan again, pleased to see that he looked more interested than he had before, but that was probably only because his friend was whispering rapidly in his ear. The two taller boys, however, were still looking at her. The one who had stopped her before, the one with the tiny scar on his eyebrow (the only difference she could spot between the two) gave her a discreet thumbs up. With that Rose rallied, finally turning to look at Black. For a moment, Rose was terrified. The man had clearly aged, but he looked similar enough to the man in her father’s Pensieve that Rose felt an intrinsic urge to run. It took her a second or two to swallow her fear, but when she did, her voice came out clear and true, and she felt her father’s quiet pride like a warm blanket covering her.

To be fair, he never was. But whenever Draco came back from the Snapes’ Cottage, he found himself brooding for hours afterwards. His godfather’s family was small and the cottage was the opposite of luxurious--- but to Draco, who had grown up surrounded in stark white wealth and dozens of tight-lipped relatives, it was surprisingly close to heaven. Severus and Rose made Draco feel like he was better, like he had something inside him worth loving.
NOTE: Due to my inability to write Severus as a goy, I have been forced to edit Chapter 6:
“Her name’s Rosaline and she’s almost fifteen,” Remus was saying while Harry and Sirius played cards. Remus himself was flipping through one of Ron's magazines half-heartedly, clearly not registering a word of it. “But that’s about all Albus told us.”
told you then,” Harry bit out, hatred making his green eyes spark dangerously. Rose barely managed to conceal her flinch. “You treated Sirius and Remus like scum in the meeting, and if you think I’m going to let you do the same to Hermione--”
Rose shrugged good-naturedly and dragged Minerva over to one of the two armchairs in the living room, grinning at her father as he snapped his book shut while glaring at their guest. She herself plunked down at Minerva’s feet with crossed legs before leaning back against her legs.
Yet, in all her imaginings, Rose had somehow never considered Jonathan looking at her without any hint of recognition, had never thought to contemplate what it would mean to look at her brother and feel like they were strangers. They’d shared a womb, for Merlin’s sake, and yet she only knew the bits and pieces she could glean from her heart-sick father and the nonsensical ramblings of her notably biased best friend. Rose wanted to scream, to rage, to throw things. But her father was all but quivering with unease as she told the Order that she’d had a vision, and she knew that this wasn’t the time for a tantrum-- no matter how cathartic and deserved it might be.
“Yeah, I’m Rose Snape,” she told him, setting her jaw stubbornly. “And if you expect me to apologize for being Severus Snape’s daughter, you’ve got another thing coming. I don’t really care whether or not you like him. I don’t really care whether or not he likes

Severus was supposedly a Death Eater, one who boasted a fearsome reputation. The Dark Lord was dead. The Ministry would undoubtedly hold trials against Riddle’s followers. Albus had promised that he would testify for Severus, but Merlin knew how long the hearings would take.
“The Royal Sight is a family Gift,” Lupin argued, his amber eyes looking Rose up and down. She pushed down her urge to fidget and raised her eyebrow in challenge as he did, staring him down in a way that was sure to have made Narcissa Black proud had she been there to see. The werewolf swallowed and looked back to the headmaster. “And Rosaline isn’t a Prince.”
Her child was going to die crying.
Rose let out a shaky breath.
“Hush, dear,” his mum interrupted briskly, dividing her hair into six sections. “You just sit there and let me fix this mess. Besides, this is hardly about you anyways.”

“My mouth is patently normal-sized, thank-you-very-much!”
Lily gazed, frozen, at the door to the nursery. She had bolted it shut, but any idiot could tell it would only buy her a few seconds once Voldemort climbed the stairway. But when she looked at her baby, her beautiful boy, Lily realized that’s all she really needed. Just another moment. Just another breath.
“What ever happened to relaxing summer holidays?” Harry muttered as he slipped out of the room. Ron still hadn’t stirred. Good.
Rose knew her father was the bravest, cleverest, most capable man alive. She knew this like she knew the sky was blue and that Narcissa loved her like a daughter. She knew that he loved with everything he had and never went down without a fight. But until this very moment, she had never truly realized how
“The game was fixed,” he informed her sternly, slapping his cards down on the table and leaning forward on his elbows. “You should be ashamed of yourself, Lady Malfoy. A woman of your station resorting to such dastardly measures in a friendly game with your only son and heir.”
Harry didn’t think Sirius was in much of a position to be criticizing Harry’s sleeping habits, but he let it slide, seeing as Azkaban prisoners probably operated under different schedules than normal wizards. Instead Harry shrugged.
James is betrayed— in more ways than one. Lily shares her secret. Severus has to make the hardest choice of his life.
Harry sighed. He was a mess, covered in sweat and shaking like crazy. Grabbing his robe and putting on his slippers, he padded over to where Mrs. Weasley had left a few folded towels. Maybe a shower would calm him down. He needed the sleep--- the whole townhouse was a sty, and Mrs. Weasley seemed hard pressed to let that stand.
6) Severus is a deeply complex person, but every choice he's made leading up to Chapter One has been for his children. Remember that, even if it doesn't seem obvious.

“Alright,” one of the boys, the one who had defended her Sight, took her hand and shook it. “I’m Ron Weasley. Welcome to Grimmauld Place.”
Her baby clung to her, but the sounds and the mutterings about power and prophecies were coming closer. She lowered him into his bassinet for what she knew would be the final time, trying to soothe him as he screamed.

I’m a member, of course, but I’d never been to a meeting before, so it was more of an
I UPDATED TWICE IN A MONTH WOW THIS IS NEW AND DIFFERENT
With a curt nod to Harry, Snape left him and Sirius for the living room, once more calling out “Snape Cottage” before disappearing into the fireplace.
Draco shot up out of his seat, forgetting for a moment how rude it was. His mind was reeling. “Next year?” He asked hotly, inwardly flinching at Lucius’ glare. “But--- I won’t be of age. Surely---”
It was one thing to know that his father hated Muggleborns and thought they were gaining too much power in society. It was another to know that he was willing to let a diary possess an eleven-year-old girl and risk his own son’s life just to unleash a monster to petrify them. What happened to Ginny Weasley had been a wake-up call in more ways than one, showing Draco not only how cold-blooded his beloved father could be but how
Draco sighed dramatically and proceeded to heave himself on the cushion next to Rose, who tried very hard not to look at him. He was making the kicked kitten face and Rose could never stay annoyed when he pulled the kicked kitten face. Draco, of course, knew this all too well, the manipulative menace that he was.
“Father,” Draco tried to keep his voice level and polite. “I do not want to risk embarrassing you or dishonoring our good name. Should my magical knowledge be incomplete, I would shame you.”
Ron snickered, but Jonathan (Harry, Harry, Harry, his name was

“So, I’ve only heard bits and pieces, mind, but it paints a pretty interesting picture,” Sirius began, lacing his fingers together on top of his crossed legs. “Moony’s right-- she’s just about your age, Harry. Snape calls her Rose instead of Rosaline, but he’s called her his punishment from God more than once-- not too sure if the bloke was joking. Minerva knows her, clearly, since she’s always asking after her. She’s apparently very close with Snivelly’s godson, is wasting her Potions potential, and can make a mean pasta, but that’s all the fun stuff I’ve been able to glean. Mostly the git just worries. Incessantly.”
Every step to the crib felt like dying. Severus had just gotten Jonathan back, had just ran his hands through his boy’s hair for the first time in over a year. But Severus was a Slytherin, and that meant doing what was necessary, no matter the personal cost.
His mother’s answering grin lit up the whole room.
like the back of his hand. Soon, Jonny was sleeping soundly.
But his mum didn’t know everything that there was under the sun, despite her own protestations of the fact, so she didn’t understand that he’d needed the conversation about fathers to end where she’s started it.
Severus rose. As he dematerialized, a half-giant readied to enter the ruined Potter house. Severus’ last view of the nursery, his son sleeping soundly and Lily, a hero until the end, was burning in his mind as he made his final vow to the woman he loved.

But dislike me on my own merit-- don’t rewrite history to justify it, okay? I mean, I stuck up for you in the Order meeting and I’ve been kindly ignoring how you’ve been glaring daggers into my forehead since we all sat down, so I don’t really see what your problem is besides my surname. Whatever’s going on between you and my dad, leave me out of it. And that goes for all of you too--” she turned to the rest of the group, “--I stayed away from Hogwarts for four years because my father was convinced that I’d be targeted for things I didn’t even do. Still is, really. So if you guys actually hate him, maybe don’t try and prove him right? Is that okay with everyone?”

He readied to Disapparate, but thought better of it. Kneeling again, he caressed Lily’s face, lips that had always entranced him, eyes that had once been full of laughter. Severus kissed her forehead and eased her eyelids closed, before brushing his lips over those, too.
He’d managed to delay the inevitable for two more years. He’d be able to stave off running for two more years. Until then, Draco would parade as the model son. A son Lucius Malfoy could be proud of.
She silently sprinkled a bit of cheese into her bowl before passing the chipped ceramic cup back to her Dad, but he didn’t partake. Spinning his fork through the long strands of pasta, her dad opened his mouth to apologize for his temper, but for once, Rose beat him to it.
Rose let her shoulders drop a little as she slowly relaxed and leaned back against the couch cushions.
I am SO SO SORRY for the late update. I have had a lot on my plate recently (including way too many WIPs) so this fic hasn't been updated in months. I am finally figuring out a better schedule for my writing, so hopefully I will become a more consistent updater in the future. Thank you so much for your patience. Lots of love!
Sirius laughed, but this time it seemed a little forced. “James and I used to eavesdrop all the time. Found out half of the information we needed for the map that way. Your father’s son, you are.”
“What you should do is take your seat back and let me give the bloody vision before I have to hex you,” Rose cut him off. Her dad glared at her, but took his seat back with surprisingly good grace as she stood back up, only jostling a still groggy Fletcher a little. Taking pity on him, she sighed.
The second she had entered the kitchen, she’d begun speaking, her voice cutting through whatever argument the Order had been in the midst of loudly and clearly.

“Well you nixed Aunt Cissa for being too soppy,” she complained, tutting over the state of Rose’s braids and taking out the hair bobbles so that she could redo them.

Rosaline’s brow furrowed as she surveyed the room. Eventually, her gaze landed on Harry, and a jolt of electricity ran down Harry’s spine as they looked at one another properly for the first time. Her eyes were bright green, with thick lashes, and while they had been bright and laughing mere moments ago, when Rosaline looked at Harry, her gaze was sad, almost desperate. Her throat bobbed as she swallowed hard. Harry found himself unable to look away, caught up in the oddest sense of deja vu, and she was the one to break eye contact as she turned back to address the rest of the Order.
Harry couldn’t help but grin. “Attempted?”
There was a long, heavy pause where all the Gryffindors exchanged loaded glances and Rose tried very hard not to scream.
“Like hell are we letting you in,” George snorted, arms crossed. “Fred and I are seventeen, and

“Counted cards. It’s a way of keeping track of what card is where using memorization and logic. Very difficult to master, of course. I’m only a novice. But Severus learned from watching his father lose to a visitor at the local pub. And he taught himself.”
“Jonathan Alexander,” she whispered in her son’s ear, biting back a delirious giggle as he wrapped her hair in his sweet, chubby fists, smiling despite the horror around him. Steps were sounding on the stairs. “Jonathan Alexander, I love you.”

need an entire casserole.”
And wasn’t Jonny a miracle? He’d survived a Killing Curse, for Merlin’s sake. He was going to be a legend, a hero. That thought made Severus clutch his son tighter as the ramifications of this realization sunk in.
“What does that mean for him?”
“Bloody hell!” Harry gasped, tears threatening to form in his eyes.
“That last one was always one of her favorites,” Severus murmured after Draco put the sheet music away. “She never loved the musical, but she adored that song.”
Snape didn’t even bother to hear Mrs. Weasley’s retort before he made to stalk out of the room. Harry hurriedly stepped out of the entryway to let him by, hoping that the professor wouldn’t notice him. But Harry should have known better. Snape never missed an opportunity to be vile.

“Can we hear the bloody vision, now?” An Auror on the other side of the table complained.
Harry laughed and tucked a pillow underneath his head before settling down to listen. What Sirius said next was sure to be interesting.
“It’s not broken,” Snape cut them both off, studying Harry’s ankle carefully. “Badly sprained, but we are wizards for a reason.
“Mama,” his son murmured, looking at Severus with eyes wise beyond their years. “Mama go.”
Severus held his son to his chest, running his shaking hand over the boy’s shaggy black mop of hair, as he stared at Lily’s body, willing her to get up. Willing her to come home.
Draco snorted, eyes gleaming, and Rose knew that the joke had been the right move. “All’s well, my lady,” he replied in mock-graveness. “I have vanquished the Black King, as the prophecy had foreseen.”
“And?” She asked, gesturing to the two taller boys. “These two, at least, look older than me, and I’ve been formerly inducted into the Order.

“I could scarcely believe it when it first happened,” her voice had taken on an almost hypnotic tone, as if this was a sort of bedtime story Narcissa concocted to cheer him up and Draco was six again, crying into his pillow because Daddy had missed another family dinner. “This little first year won all of Lucius’ allowance in one night of poker after having gone through the entire House. It was madness–– no one could believe it. They all thought he was cheating–– he must have been, Lucius and Bast were the best card players in the House. But the anti-cheating charms didn’t detect a thing, so by two in the morning he’d very happily marched up to the Owlery and sent the 500 Galleons he’d won to his mum. But here’s the problem,” she lowered her voice. “Everyone expected him to be using magic to cheat. But Severus was much too clever. He knew magic would get him caught, and besides he was only eleven–– what magic did he know? He counted cards.”
The green light raced towards her and the world melted away. She was dimly aware of a high pitched laugh, of her body recoiling in fear. But all she heard was Jonny’s delighted babbling, Rosie’s quiet sounds of contentment as she nursed, Sev’s voice saying her name.

Snape didn’t respond to this, and that’s how Harry knew Sirius was dead meat. Everyone at Hogwarts knew that a silent Snape was one to be avoided. If he was talking, Snape wasn’t devoting
“Love you too, Snappy,” Draco smiled, burrowing under the covers so he could press his cold feet onto Rose’s ankles, making her squeal and flick his ear with her free hand. Laughing, he turned so he was laying on his back, eyes on the ceiling, and within moments Rose followed suit.

without loosing a part of himself each time?
Tonight was a celebration, though, so Draco ignored all but one of his mother’s song requests, limiting them to only one aria before diving into some musical theater pieces, grinning as Rose jumped right into songs from
“I’ll try to do it when you’re out of earshot,” Draco promised. “I know it really upsets you to hear the sorts of things I’ll have to say. I don’t want to be the reason you’re sad, not when this year is already going to be so stressful.”
Her dad breathed deeply through his nose before taking the seat next to her, passing her some grated cheese from Mrs. Willow’s cart. That alone made Rose’s chest ache. That cheese was bloody expensive–– Dad had clearly been expecting her to be upset, must’ve been beyond stressed. And now Rose felt guilty, and she
“Declaring myself as Rosaline C. Snape,” she called out, skipping into the room, gleefully ignoring the sharp gasps and questioning looks that were immediately thrown her way. Her father stood up suddenly, jostling a snoozing Mundungus Fletcher. Fletcher made some indignant noise of displeasure, but no one paid him any mind, least of all Snape. “To verify my identity, I will share two things with the Order that only I and my close family would know.”
“Rosie,” he murmured, squeezing her hand in return and brushing a strand of hair out of her face. “I think it’s time you met your brother.”

“Yes, of course,” Rose said, careful to remember what Jonathan still didn’t know. It wouldn’t do to make an enemy of a woman who was probably very important to her brother. “Basically, I Saw a few lines of text juxtaposed against… well, against the place everyone has been guarding. The text was moving pretty quickly through timelines, so I wasn’t sure at first if it was ours, but I was able to determine that this information is for
"No promises."
Right now she was smirking at him, having just won the first game with Draco’s new deck of cards. Draco idly wondered if this is how she looked when she was young, when she was the youngest of three sisters who loved each other fiercely. He’d only seen a few old photographs of her then, but while her hair had been shorter and her face a bit rounder, the mischievous glint in her blue eyes was the same. Draco loved it, and he loved her.
timestream, so whatever this means can and should inform our choices going forward. The text can be translated a variety of ways, but what I got was this.
He bit his lip to keep himself from telling her everything. She didn’t know. That was the entire point–– she loved his father fiercely, and Lucius was all she had left in the world with her sisters estranged and in Azkaban. And Lucius was good to her. Draco wanted to tell her, of course. Desperately. His father had been hurting Draco for his entire life, and he wasn’t deluded enough to believe Lucius when his father said Draco deserved it. Because Narcissa loved him, and Severus loved him, and Rose loved him, so he
? When?
“Now, Sirius,” the headmaster reprimanded Harry’s godfather. “There’s no need to---”
-- and Rosaline fought a smile as she pretended to consider the matter, her forehead wrinkling exaggeratedly as her green eyes sparked with laughter.
Harry rolled his eyes and turned back to go upstairs, ignoring Sirius whispering for him to come back. He grabbed his towel from the top landing where he’d left it, and headed to finally take that shower. As he undressed, he looked at his ankle, which was as good as new. No swelling at all. Harry thought again about the red mark on Snape’s face and winced.
to focus on your studies. Yes, Draco, I mean you as well. Don’t give me that look.”
She muffled a shriek as she heard doors slamming downstairs, Voldemort searching the kitchen and guest rooms. Fat, hot tears ran down her cheeks, causing her son to whimper as she pressed his face against hers. She kissed his forehead, his little button nose, and his fluttering eyelids, breathing in his perfect softness.
), the way Rose’s mouth twitched as it continued made him think that there might be some new developments this time around.
But that did not change the fact that his mother was a dirty cheat.
How did her father do this? How did he manage to look at Harry without falling to pieces, to taunt him and disparage him without bursting into tears? How did he swallow down each

Severus looked down at Lily’s body once more.
“Did you?” his mother asked, raising one perfectly manicured eyebrow and pursed her lips. “Are you sure you didn’t have Mindy keep an eye on me while we played?”
He walked closer, telling her again to stand down, as if it was an option. As if she wasn’t a mother. As if she hadn’t sworn to all the gods in every pantheon that she would protect the dear little bundle she had held to her breast that first night to her last breath. Lily would gladly forfeit her life if doing so granted Jonathan even five more heartbeats.
Not that she was unaware of what an arse he was at school. Even Dad sometimes got put out from Draco’s comments, and he had a rather high tolerance for bullshit. Rose was too intelligent to ignore the possibility of how utterly bigoted those comments probably were. Never mind that they had drunk Muggle soda and played Muggle board games all summer. Never mind that they had listened to every Eternal album on repeat and could recite all the words to any Disney movie ever made. That was Cottage-Draco, and even though Cottage-Draco was the
Thank you all for the lovely comments! Please keep them coming :)
She paused, smiling softly as she pointed her wand at both twins lazily.
I KNOW THIS IS LATE I KNOW I'M SO SO SORRY I WISH I HAD AN EXCUSE BUT I DO NOT
“I don’t know what to say to that,” the professor finally said stonily, but much more levelly than Harry had anticipated. “Other than this. Rose is a good girl with her head on straight. She likes crappy music and cooking breakfast at ungodly hours of the night and she has more raw power in her little finger than you and I have combined. You do a disservice to yourself and to everyone here to bar her from coming to visit. But it’s your house, Black. Your house, indeed.”
“Harry,” Mrs. Weasley sighed, looking into Harry's eyes tiredly. “You don’t know everything about Severus. I doubt you know much at all.”
“May I interject?” Rose raised a hand hesitantly. All heads turned towards her. There was a nice stretch of silence before she continued, if by
“I’ll be sure to tell my dad.”
“There’s never a welcome wagon waiting for me anywhere, Dad,” Rose snorted, flicking a small piece of broccoli at him and giggling at his glare. “Your blessed surname makes sure of that.”
Rose closed her eyes and thought back to her vision.
and reveal every truth that had been kept hidden, every lie that had needed to be told, wanted to throw her arms around her brother and hold on tight, wanted to have family dinners and joint birthday parties and inside jokes. Rose wanted her family back, wanted it so badly she thought she might choke on it.
,” Snape snarled icily, causing even Harry, who was not yet fully in the room, to flinch at his tone. All semblance of patience was gone as Snape continued furiously, his eyes narrow and dangerous. “Insinuate that Rose is uncared for. She is given
Rose shifted her body so that she was facing Harry, tilting her chin up to look at him more closely. God, he looked so much like James Potter. She’d known that, intellectually, known that her mother had placed a charm on him at birth, knew that the ability for the charm to be lifted died with her that terrible Halloween. Rose hadn’t thought it would matter-- she loved her brother, no matter what he looked like, of course she did. But it wasn’t Harry’s hair or stature or even his glasses that made him look so much like a Potter, not really.
Draco watched in a kind of morbid fascination as Lucius nodded. This man was his father, the man who had been his hero not too long ago. He had been Draco's everything, and now? Now he was simply an obstacle to be surmounted.
“Rose,” Draco’s urgent voice startled her out of her reverie. “I just heard Severus open the front door.”
“You’ve come all this way, Ms. Snape, it seems a shame that your father looks ready to whisk you away so soon,” he said mildly. “Perhaps you should stay a bit and meet your new schoolmates. I’m sure that Severus can see himself home.”

“Who do you think taught me?” his mother grinned, standing and coming to sit next to him on the loveseat and running her long fingers through his hair.
Draco hummed and leaned his head on his mother’s shoulder, breathing deeply. She was wearing a new perfume, he noted, as he closed his eyes. She smelled like jasmine and vanilla and chamomile tea, and Draco felt at peace for the first time that day. When his mum was with him, Draco could pretend for a little while. He could pretend that he was in a normal family; that Draco and Narcissa were just waiting for his nice, normal father to come home from work and take them out to eat.
Rose laughed and pushed him of her lap, Draco landing on the floor with a loud
So so sorry for the late update!! I had a bit of a creative block going, and I'm still not entirely happy with this specific chapter, but I thought it best to post it. I might go back and edit it later, but we'll see.
type thing, and I know that some people might be loath to accept my information-- not only because, you know, it came from ephemeral magic, which is somehow not a reliable source of magic according to more and more wizards which-- which is a whole other story, I guess, but also because I’m a Snape and I just had to present really important information to people who think that makes me inherently untrustworthy so--”
“I don’t know, Headmaster,” Rose grinned. “I’m afraid my dear old dad is quite lost without me.”
His father’s eyes remained steely. Time for the grand finale, then.
“Draco,” Lucius greeted him cordially, pushing his pocket watch shut. “Right on time.”
She’d thought that the end of it, but then he silently spelled the rest of her food bright pink. Rose swore loudly, but smiled inwardly as he smirked, satisfied with his revenge. They’d have to keep talking about the situation, of course. But he was so clearly worried and so obviously stressed that she turned the conversation towards the merits of eating Transfigured food happily.
, to say the least, but he’d never stooped so low as to lash out at Headmaster Dumbledore. “
Her dad poked her in the back at her insult, but the rest of the Order laughed a bit, so Rose decided that the broken ice was worth her father’s huffines. She smiled and started to explain in earnest.
He brandished his wand and time seemed meaningless, lights too bright and sounds too loud as she began to grovel, shielding her son with her arms, hoping that mercy was possible, that somehow her perfect boy would live. Lily’s blood roared in her ears.
“You’d best be careful of that Kreacher, Potter,” he said smoothly, standing back up in one fluid motion and pocketing his wand. Harry scrambled to get up too, using Sirius’ proffered hand as leverage. “He likes to patrol the stairs at night. Something about keeping filth out of dear Walburga’s kitchen. A
“We lost ours in 1642,” Ron said mournfully. “Bartholomew Thelonious Weasley tried to claim it for himself and ended up burning through the Gift and his own magical core in one fell swoop. And ours was wicked, too.”
Rose snorted (somewhere in Wiltshire, Rose guessed, Narcissa winced, sensing that a young lady was acting distinctly unladylike-- poor lamb). One of the twins, the one sitting on the floor at Ron’s feet with a small scar bisecting his right eyebrow, grinned up at her in response.
“I assure you, Mrs. Weasley, I am perfectly healthy,” Snape was grumbling peevishly, running a hand through his greasy hair. His relative calm made Harry think that the man was thoroughly exhausted. “I do
She needed to let the truth pass her lips before there wasn’t a chance. She had kept too much from the people who loved her. Good Lord, James had died for a son who wasn’t his, a wife who had never loved him the way he had thought.
“Jonny, Mummy has to tell you something,” she tried to comfort him, sounding less and less like herself as she frantically tried to explain. Tried to make something right. “Papa wasn’t here. Papa left with Rosie to keep us safe. Papa loves you. Oh, God, honey, Papa loves you. And Rosie misses you. It’s my fault, baby. I couldn’t leave. I wasn't brave enough. I’m so sorry we couldn’t be a family. I’m so, so sorry, lovey.”
, so she had absolutely
Once Sirius regained control of his faculties, he said what was on everyone’s minds.
“For one thing, underage wizards have the Trace. If I went out with a task force on a mission, that fool Fudge would be all over the group in seconds. Not to mention that I’d know loads more magic by then.”
Sirius snorted before turning away from his hand and looking at Harry, his eyes dancing. “If Moony ever stopped being a boring old swot he’d know more,” he confided. “I’ve been listening to Snape’s conversations with Minerva and the like---”
His mother’s eyes flashed again, and that’s when Draco knew that if he wanted to avoid having to help the woman hide a body instead of being able to go to Hogwarts tomorrow, he’d have to step in.
“Thank Merlin, it’s just you,” he laughed and Harry smiled back weakly, despite the pain in his ankle.
“That I’m unwelcome--”
Ron shook his head.

His mother laughed loudly and leaned forward conspiratorially, her eyes bright. “It’s not cheating if you don’t get caught.”

“Good. I don’t want to know that tosser.”

miniscule skill set.”
Harry bolted upright, breathing heavily. Sweat poured off of him as he ran a hand through his hair and tried to slow down his heart rate. Ron was still fast asleep, if the soft snoring under the mountain of quilts on the other side of the bedroom was any indication, but Harry didn’t think he’d be able to do the same for the rest of the night.
Snape still hadn’t put down his wand, but Harry saw that his dark eyes were scanning the stairs, not him, so he relaxed a bit.
“I was reading,” he accused Minerva, tapping his long fingers loudly on the cover of the book.

“And Emmeline,” Harry prompted softly, his eyes scanning his godfather once more. He was hiding something. And Harry was sick of adults hiding things. So he gave Sirius all he got. “And Hestia Jones. And Podmore.”
“Your brother had an…” her dad trailed off and sighed, eyes murky. “Incident, let’s say. He used some underage magic to repel some Dementors who just so happened to be drifting around Privet Drive.”
“Sure,” Harry replied, trying very hard to ignore how dreadfully scary Mrs. Weasley was at the moment. “He’s a spy.”

“What do you
Rose had spent years imagining what it would be like to finally meet her brother. In her daydreams, he was smiling, wet-eyed, as they clung to each other for dear life and their dad wiped away their happy tears with the pads of his thumbs. In her nightmares, Jonathan screamed at her, red-faced and furious, calling her a liar and a traitor and rejecting their father with pure hatred coloring his voice.
“Draco?” Rose whispered from the other side of the mattress, her voice tense. “Are you awake?’
, Rose meant Harry, of course she did, because
Draco, only Rose and her Dad had ever seen him.
Rose snorted and turned back to the Order, all of whom were still studying her as if she was a new exotic animal. The ginger from before and his twin both looked like Christmas had come early, and the boy next to Jonathan (she assumed he was Ron Weasley based on her father's information and Draco's long-winded rants, but she couldn't be completely sure) was looking at
“I knew you’d worry,” she confessed, blushing a little as she bit her lip. “And that you’d do something stupid like try to stop me.”

Sirius and Remus exchanged a glance and Sirius sighed loudly, derision coming off him in waves.
The girl-- no, Rosaline Snape-- left the door open wide as she sauntered into the kitchen, shooting a wink in George’s direction as she did so, giving Harry and his friends full access to the meeting. Fred shrugged good-naturedly, and his answering smile seemed to indicate that he thought it right decent of her. Harry couldn’t bring himself to agree. The girl had just pulled a wand on George (not that he looked too put out, mind, but the point stood), and Harry had learned a long time ago that Snapes never did something nice just for the sake of it.

“You could never make me sad, Draco,” Rose countered gently, squeezing his hand. “You’re my best friend.”
Rose made the mistake of finding this witty. She tried to keep the giggles threatening to spill out of her between her lips, but it was like she hadn’t even bothered. Soon, the two of them were laughing like mad, Draco’s head falling into her lap and her hand finding his hair.
“The Gifts aren’t just myths,” Rose cut her off impatiently. “As I said, I have one. I’m the current wielder of the Royal Sight. I literally just had a vision thirty minutes ago. I know that Rutger is considered by some to be a great political historian, but believe me, she way missed the mark in that sixth chapter. There’s a reason why
“Just like your sister, huh?” Severus smiled once more, before turning back to Lily.
(Not that he really had any choice.)
“Fred and I are taking that too,” The-Twin-Who-By-Process-Of-Elimination-Must-Be-George told her, grinning even wider. “Have you thought at all about the topic of your final project?”

Snape’s face darkened considerably as he clenched his fists, but it was McGonagall who answered the unspoken challenge.
“Minerva!” She crowed, scrambling out of her seated position to embrace the older woman. She smiled into Minerva’s robes as the woman huffed with mock indignation at the sudden welcome.
The key word, of course, being
“No,” she finally admitted. “And that’s why I’m unsure of what to make of it. I mean, how can Darkness falling be a bad thing? Unless it means that the fall itself is done badly? Like, we kill You-Know-Who, but too late? Or we defeat him, but his militia remains?”
“That’s what you said yesterday, Rose.”

Rose gaped as her dad actually looked abashed, his pale skin actually taking on a pinkish tinge. Sometimes it was easy to forget her dad was only in his thirties, very young in comparison to Minerva and the Headmaster.

“That’s just it,” Rosaline told them, and while she was no longer looking at Harry, he had the strangest feeling that she was talking directly to him. “I’m not sure.”
“It’s not great,” Draco told Rose honestly. “I-- I don’t like the person I have to be in public, Rose, and I don’t believe that sort of thing anymore, I promise. But it’s-- you’re going to be cross at me and I won’t be able to avoid it.”
That was, until Snape decided to kneel down and take a strong hold of his ankle.

That was all it took for her father, Severus bloody Snape, the man who struck fear in the hearts of Ministry workers, Death Eaters, and eleven-year-olds alike, to morph into the most irritating mother hen on the face of the earth.
Dumbledore made a quiet noise of approval, and Rose’s dad leaned back into his chair, so Rose thought that would be the end of it, but apparently the Marauders had other ideas.
“So, as some of you may know, visions aren’t always perfectly clear, but I’ve gotten pretty good at dissecting them. This one is confusing, but I’ve been able to glean enough that it should be useful in amending the Order’s strategy.”
Rose, but this knee-jerk distaste, this instinctive callousness was all too reminiscent of the many memories her father thought he’d hidden from her. Rose’s stomach twisted painfully, and she felt wretched in her unhappiness. She wanted to let it all pour out of her, wanted to say
“When are you not?” Minerva shot back, an amused spark in her sharp eyes. Rose’s dad rolled his eyes but placed the book down next to him, not bothering to mark the page they were reading. He sat up with a groan, stretching his long arms over his head before responding.
Rose was so caught up in the whirlwind of yelling, the smile Fred was shooting her, the way George’s hair curled at the base of his neck, and how utterly
“We’re fortunate, my love,” his mum murmured, wrapping a thin arm around his shoulders and pressing a kiss on his head. “Your father loves you and I so very much. You’re lucky to be his son.”
In the corner of the kitchen, Harry thought he saw McGonagall smile triumphantly, but that was probably a trick of the light. Snape, on the other hand, looked incredibly concerned.
“I know you were just worried about me,” she leaned over to kiss his cheek again as his jaw twitched. “But I’m okay. Promise.”
“Your idiot father decided it would be a good idea to contact the actual Black heir,” Minerva told Rose, absent-mindedly smoothing Rose’s hair out of her face. “He wrote his old friend Narcissa Malfoy and very innocently asked about the state of Grimmauld Place. Which got Narcissa to ask a few pointed questions to the Ministry’s Inheritance Office about procuring it, which in turn spooked the Order’s liaison and forced Albus to run damage control. The official story is now that Number 12 was destroyed in a fight between the two Black brothers and was made Unplottable because of the amount of Dark Magic still in the foundations of the house. Very helpful for Order security, actually, which is the reason your father will give at the next meeting, but also very worrying for a one Sirius Black.”
“Damn you, Dragon,” Rose groaned as she lost her rook to her god-brother's knight. “I told you to go easy on me, you prat.” She glared at him, but her awful excuse for a best mate didn’t react in the slightest.
“Spawn?” Snape hissed, his voice slick with hatred. “Is that what you call a normal fifteen-year-old girl, Black? Spawn?”
Hermione raised one dark eyebrow incredulously.

like they were both mad. Jonathan was looking over at Black who Rose was studiously avoiding acknowledging. The rest of the adults looked to her expectantly, and Dumbledore waved for her to elaborate on what she’d seen.
“Stop!” Rose shot up from her chair, her face burning. Usually, this sort of behavior from her dad was almost adorable, but the fit ginger who had been standing at the door since she’d entered was smirking something fierce, and Rose would

Sirius snorted. “Wanted to discuss something with me. Could only make this time and Albus made me agree. Waste of time though.”
“But I’m the light of your life!” Rose exclaimed, unable to keep a grin from overtaking her face.
“Well, I caught you.”
“What’s going on?” Rose finally asked, sick of being left out. She tilted her head up to look at Minerva and narrowed her eyes. “What did my idiot father do this time?”
Draco snorted at the last line of the letter. Lucius was such a fucking liar--- if the ache in Draco’s neck was any indication of his father’s hatred of doling out punishments. But Lucius did know how long it took Winny to get a letter to this side of the manor, so Draco dragged himself out of bed. After pulling on a casual robe and combing a hand through his hair, he walked quickly to his father’s wing, only stopping to bid his mum good evening.
He ended up falling down the last few stairs rather spectacularly, much to his embarrassment. His ankle immediately began to throb. Sirius and Snape both simultaneously drew their wands at the sound and rushed over. At seeing him, Sirius sighed and pocketed his wand once more.

“I’ll make a note of it,” Rose promised impishly. “Not to worry.”
“Then please, O Glorious One, share your wisdom,” Remus drawled as he chucked the magazine at Harry’s godfather’s head. “Leave not a word unspoken.”
Rose hated Tuesdays. They were smack dab in between Mondays, which were awful, but at least offered a weekly clean slate, and Wednesdays, which at least gave a girl some hope that the week might end. But Tuesday was a useless, terrible day when nothing interesting happened and the weekend was a distant dream. This Tuesday was especially horrid, if not the most awful Rose had ever had. She’d gotten gum stuck in her hair, Draco had had to cancel their plans,
The mood shifted in the room so quickly that Harry got whiplash.
Richard, who needed that lying prick when there was George Weasley to hopelessly pine over.
McGonagall shrugged.
“Delegating tasks that you cannot hope to accomplish on your own is a pragmatic way to tackle problems, Mother!” Draco cried, glaring good-naturedly at the old elf who shrugged his shoulders by way of apology. “Mindy is a much more effective spy than I could ever be.”
too much fun with this. “And Dad thinks everything is too soppy, so he’s hardly an unbiased source.”
“I’ll have another, extremely valid and helpful reason to share,” her father finished succinctly, smiling at her deduction. But then his face clouded, and he leaned back into the sofa, its springs creaking loudly. “But it was for nothing, I suppose. That was my trump card, and he still won’t let you visit once.”
Rose relented with a snicker and rolled over so that she was lying down on the soft carpet next to him.
“Nightmare,” he replied nonchalantly. “Why was Snape here?”
Strangely, saying that didn’t help.
Rose’s dad huffed and nodded. “While I wish taking such lengths was not necessary in order to get two teenagers to do their summer work, we’ll nonetheless follow that plan.”
“Wow, you
- Yes the Weasleys were firebenders, what of it?
“It was just a dream,” he told himself, swinging his legs over so they dangled off the twin bed. “Just a horrible, terrifying, awful dream.”
“If you don’t mind, Mr. Black,” Rose kept her voice polite and cheerful, though she wanted to strangle the man. “I really should give this vision now, if I can. It might be urgent.”
Harry sighed and nodded as the two of them ran after the girl, bumping into each other all the way. Regardless of their rather clumsy and expletive-ridden chase, Ron and Harry managed to catch up to whoever she was just in time to see her in an argument with Fred and George. The twins had only been listening at the door last time Harry checked, but now they stood like sentries, their backs to the kitchen door.
But it would break his mother’s heart to learn the truth, Draco knew that deep in his once-broken bones. And Draco refused to be the cause of his mother’s pain. Narcissa was clever and sharp and loved with her whole heart and Draco would not ruin the few bits of happiness she held so closely to her chest. So he took another deep breath and smiled even more widely.
“No, but my grandmother was,” she replied, shrugging. “Eileen Prince.”
It wasn’t supposed to end this way.
This whole installment will be in the editing stages by the end of this year. I was going to keep this chapter in my pocket for a little longer, but I thought we could all use a boost.
Harry nodded. “Why wouldn’t you let his daughter come visit?”
Granger back then, he’d never actually wanted her to be seriously hurt.
“I’m sorry I haven’t visited more often, luv.”
“Hello, Father,” Draco replied, carefully assessing the man in front of him. Lucius looked to be in a good mood, but that could mean a multitude of things, given his current loyalties. But Draco, not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, relaxed slightly. “What can I do for you?”

“Yes, Jonny,” Severus replied brokenly. “Your mama’s gone. But I’m here, son. I’m here now. I’m not leaving you.” He gave Jonathan a soft kiss on the forehead, almost fainting when the child smiled at him, his few white teeth pearly and wonderful and miraculous. Severus’ dark eyes drank in every piece of his son, ignoring for a moment that he still happened to look like Potter. He was so delicate, his eyelashes thick and dark, his cheeks full and rosy. Severus pushed Jon’s hair to the side.
“Always will.”
“You had a vision?” He demanded, quickly kneeling down so that he was eye-level with his daughter. Dumbledore suddenly looked more alert as he focused his gaze on the Snape girl, his blue eyes sharp, while McGonagall began to look grave. “What of?”
Rose didn’t have a response to that, but her god-brother did.
Ginny: “She rendered Mum
“I just don’t want you to die if you can avoid it,” her dad complained. “You know we can’t afford a funeral.”
“It would be a bad influence. We don’t need any more Slytherins lurking about. Bad enough we have Snivelly.”
In which Draco angsts, Narcissa and Severus make a nuisance of themselves, and Rose is a little shit.

up his Death Easter arse before the man was sweeping out of the room. Snape shouted “Snape Cottage!” as he Flooed away, and Harry failed to suppress a shiver at the thought of Snape’s home. Somehow, the prick even made the idea of a cottage sound dark and terrible.

“I love you, Lily Marie Evans,” he murmured hoarsely, tears threatening to fall despite his shields. “Always have.”

Silence. In Mrs. Weasley’s case, scandalized silence. Sirius looked like he was about to die. Snape was the one to break it as he huffed and ran a hand through his hair. Harry expected him to rage, but instead the man only looked petulant.

“You’re brill,” Rose told him seriously, once she’d gotten her thoughts in order. “I really needed to just… sit for a moment. Thank you.”
“Of course I do, Draco,” she responded firmly. He did this often nowadays--- made sure that she knew he loved her. Rose tried not to jump to conclusions because of his new need to articulate her importance to him, but she couldn’t help but worry about what was going on in the Manor. Rose sighed and traced the lines on his forehead. She was so terribly worried, but still tried for levity, dusting off an old nickname from, God, nineteen-eighty something. “You alright, Sir Malfoy?”
Rosaline instantly tensed at the sound of the nickname, and a part Harry couldn’t help but sympathize. Snape was her
Minerva laughed again, her harsh face alighting with it while Rose’s father sputtered.
Narcissa Black Malfoy was a proud woman, and Draco couldn’t think of a time when she’d had a single hair out of place. Her clothes were immaculate, her manners were cool and confident, and she was still as pretty as she had been on her wedding day about 18 years prior.

“C’mon, Rosie,” he whined, laying his forehead on her shoulder. “You have many other talents. Singing. Charms. I’ve heard you even managed to hang the moon.”
Ron smiled crookedly. “Not a big fan of public speaking?”
Shaking himself, Draco stood up to help his mother gather her things. He was spending the night at the Cottage so that he could go with Rose to the train station, since it was her first time, but his mother had to get back to the Manor before it got too late.
“I would've liked to see him try,” his mum retorted archly and Draco laughed before his mother sobered. “It’s probably because of his father. The man was a scoundrel, and drank far too much and too often. I don’t blame him for being worried, even if I know he’d never turn out that way.”
“Simple,” Snape replied haughtily, flicking a microscopic piece of lint off of his coat. “He attempted to frighten me.”
Draco huffed and sunk into his armchair, looking so very put out that Rose had to choke back a snigger.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Lucius warned, his voice laced with danger as his hand moved slowly downwards to his desk drawers. “I will not ask again.”
“You’ll do no such thing,” she snapped, breezing over to the Snapes from the corner of the room. She placed a thin hand on Rosaline’s shoulder. “Neither Rose or Severus did anything wrong. I invited her.”
