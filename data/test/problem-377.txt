“Hermione is overreacting. She is making a big deal out of nothing. Occasional use of potions to make up is a normal thing in the magical world. She is only upset because she isn’t aware of magical culture and traditions.” Molly sneered at her tea. “Ronniekins would never hurt her, he loves her. She is blowing things out of proportion. He’s told me, you know, that he listened to Arthur’s advice and only used the potions as he was told. He is a good boy and she is making him out to be a… a… a monster. A brute.”
“You can’t be seriously considering us three going. Can you?” Draco tightened his grip on Hermione, “I understand that the Weasley Family Brunch is a tradition, and that you are considered their honorary son, but it would-” A hand on his stopped him mid-sentence. He looked down at Hermione and she smiled.
Harry flipped through the paperwork and leaned back in his chair. He took his time perusing all of the details his best pair put into their file. The silence stretched beyond comfort and well into awkward by the time he snapped the file closed. “If you feel strongly enough that there was foul play involved, open a new file, but know that it may not actually lead us anywhere. I agree that this is all just a bit too tidily wrapped up. Did it seem like the Patils accepted her story?” Hermione nodded in response while Draco scoffed. “Of course. You said they seemed so distraught when she was gone. This must have been a great relief to them to have her returned unharmed. I would believe her as well.”
For the first time in a while, he now had time to sit and think. He was hardly surprised that his thoughts took a dark turn they could hardly do otherwise. The fragility of the child lying on the bed brought home just how large his hubris had been.
Author crosses finger that hopefully this means they can stop running for their lives from the pack of rabid readers they somehow have collected.
Harry peeked between the wooden board of the banister and saw that Snape had handed Voldemort a potion vial.
“Your mother came to me one night out of the blue and informed me that her husband was stricken with the common Pureblood curse that left males sterile. She was desperate for a child, and didn’t want to bring any shame upon her marriage.” Severus paused and looked away trying desperately to not think about that night. He made sure his occlumency shield were firmly in place before attempting to continue. “Long story short she asked me to help her out and she was pregnant with you by the time she left.”
“Shut up, shut up, shut up. If you can’t stop making so much noise then I'm going to muzzle you.” He then dropped Harry who collapsed like a puppet with its strings cut.
“Just say it, Severus, we have been friends long enough that I won’t take offence at your bluntness,” Narcissa said.
“Sir, please don’t send me back there. I can stay with Sirius in Grimmauld place or the Weasley’s or anywhere else. I'll won’t be a bother I promise just please don’t make me go home.”
Harry paused as silently sat down on the top stair. He had spotted Voldemort heading towards Snape on the bottom floor and knew that the banister would keep him out of sight whilst still being able to hear their conversation. He knew that it wasn’t at all polite or nice to spy on people like this but as far as Harry was concerned this didn’t count.
“Ah,” Severus paused, he wanted to say he didn’t need his nails done but he could see that Draco had metallic silver on his nails and glancing out the window showed him the Grimm’s nails badly painted in red and gold. Harry must have done Sirius, as the Grimm was most reluctant to have anyone else touch him. Thankfully, an escape hatch occurred to him.
“You are. You are a little fairy faggot and I think you should make up for all the sleep I've lost because of you.”
“James,” Sirius moaned. Harry beamed internally. Not only was he making Sirius feel good and getting head pats, but he had somehow brought up a wonderful memory of his adoptive father for them to share. A moment later Sirius took a deep breath and woke up. He looked down then blanched
Severus looked over his notes once he was done, he then spelled the ink dry. This was a very important conversation they were going to have and Severus felt better having made sure he had done all his prep work beforehand. The discussion of one’s unknown change of parenthood shouldn’t be one that people just stumble through. It was a delicate situation and needed to be handle with care. Especially since he didn’t want Harry to know about Lily’s sins. He didn’t want Harry to feel in any way responsible for what his mother had done.
Harry took a deep breath holding it for a long moment then let it out and began to talk. He stumbled and stammered at certain parts but managed to get through the retelling.
Both the times he got to spend with his son, even if Harry was dancing around the subject at the moment, and unlooked-for the time spent with the Dark Lord. Tom, his mind whispered rebelliously. No, no, he had no right to address his Lord with his first name, not even in the depths of his mind. He needed to remember his place. It wasn’t helped with the way the Dark Lord was treating him like he was a valued acquaintance or even dare he say it, friend. He went out of his way to help Severus come to terms with what Lily had done, and engaging him in multiple fascinating talks, and had even on two occasions come with Severus on his potion gathering walks. But Severus knew better, he was a loyal servant and nothing more. He needed to stop the foolish notion of rising above his station and not encourage it so it did not take root and grow in his mind.
Tom stood up when Severus entered the room and wrapped his arms around him, greeting him with a chase kiss. Severus cheeks pinked, and he ducked his head, still not used to the easy affection that Tom gave him. But he made no more to leave the embrace nor refuse the attention.
Sirius gave a single wag of his tail then disappeared into a swirl of black cloud that shot across the grounds, heading to the floor to ceiling windows of the blue sunroom.
"I know, I know, look I tried alright. I used the strongest super glue there was and the only bits of lightness or fluff I could get to attach was the roof quidditch and kissing scene."
Hogwarts had gone through a huge transformation after Dumbledore’s trail and he could hear the older kids talking excitedly, wondering what the new classes and teachers would be like. Harry had to admit there was a large part of him that was just as curious. He was looking forward to this year. Helped no doubt, but the knowledge that there was no one out to get him. His two main protagonists had either been given the Dementors kiss or they were currently teaching him to become their heir. Then there was the fact he had gotten a special dispensation that said Harry was not to be parted from Draco. They would have the same classes and sleep in the same dorm.
“I can teach you the basics and we could play while we chat. It gives our hands something to do so they are not lying idle.”
Tom went back to his paperwork leaving his Serpent to think in peace. He had heard it said that most people abhorred doing paperwork but it appealed to him. He had always loved the subtle movement and how a slight change or adding a simple punctuation mark could completely change the meaning of a document. Strategy games had always had a siren call to him. Right from his boyhood. He was unsure when he changed from moving from the shadows and working the long game, to the brutish blunt force monstrosity he was before his downfall. But he believed it had something to do with the number of Horcruxes he had foolishly created. For once in his life incompetence had benefited him. Somehow Wormtail had screwed up the resurrection potion just enough to give him his sanity back without making it impossible for him to rise at all.
“I’ll kill em, the stupid fucking wankers, pisspots’ the lot of them. They all need their bollocks ripped off and shoved down their throats.”
Severus had already lowered his occlumency barriers and was helpfully thinking of the time period in question. Tom had to do several passes before he found the spot where Severus mind had buried a memory. Carefully he nudged it out and together they watch what happened.
Harry gritted his teeth in frustration. Ever since he had returned Narcissa had been hovering over him due no doubt to the fact she missed her mate. But Lucius was still in Azkaban, as per Tom’s plan. Now in theory Harry had no problem with two Eros wanting to pamper and spoil him. Unfortunately, what happens, is one starts, and the other come to join in. Then their territorial Eros instincts kick in. And it ends up being a verbal battle where they were viciously polite to one another, hiding their barbs in well-bred conversation. And Harry would end up with no pampering, just two people sniping at each other over his head. Draco had his wings out constantly. Most of the time they were folded down his back, they would puff up and spread a little every time Narcissa got too close to Harry. She was in the same boat, except that her wings were constantly agitated without Lucius being present. It was only that they loved each other that Draco and Narcissa hadn’t ended up in a territorial battle.
Hindsight is one of the clearest forms of vison he could now point out multiple points where Harry had shown signs and yet it seemed no one was paying attention to the boy. It was not in any way soothing to know that he was not the only one to miss them. But the role of Boy-Who-Lived shone so brightly that it seemed not on bothered to look beneath to see Harry as himself. That Voldemort his prophesied emery was the first to notice said a lot about the state of the wizarding world and those who live in it.
“I promise you, Severus, I have not and will not forget about Harry. The second Lucius is safe in my protection, I will rain fire down on the Order like they have never seen and bring your son back to you.”
“I have never desired to be a teacher, and now that I am free of it, I am most disinclined to return. I have left a list of possible replacement for you to go over. I wouldn’t get Slughorn out of retirement. That man is a menace to teaching.“
“If you guys were friends, then you must know so much about her. What's her favourite colour? Did she like school? What was her favourite subject? Did she like animals? Am I anything like her?” Harry shot questions out rapid-fire.
Harry was confused, why couldn’t they talk now? He physically couldn’t go anywhere and the chances of someone finding out where they are were pretty slim at the moment.
“I screwed up,” Harry agreed. “I thought Severus was trying to say it was ok between people who love each other. But I’m so stupid. I’m too thick to understand what he was saying.” Harry raised his fist and banged it against the side of his head again and again.
Harry reached up and gently tapped against the golden torc around his neck. A habit he had gotten into whenever he was slightly unsure. Draco had given him it on their three-month anniversary. It was just as finely engraved as Lucius wrist bands. Once Draco had placed it around his neck, he had spoken a single word of power that had sent out invisible shock waves. The magic had closed the torc so people could never remove it. Harry had asked what language the word came from, as it was not one that he had ever heard of before. Draco had replied that it was Enochian, a language native to winged humans. Seeing Harry's fascination with the language Draco had from then on said a couple of words to him every day.
“Cup was a portkey, took us to a graveyard, Wormtail killed Cedric. a potion brought Voldemort back to life. Voldemort let me go free.” Harry said.
Nearly everyone in the order was in the kitchen. Although both Severus and Professor McGonagall were missing. No doubt they were still with the rest of the staff at Hogwarts. Although it looked like both Ron and Hermione were here. Harry had to bit his lip to stop from smiling when he saw six of the adults getting treated for wounds. Half of which Harry had dealt out to them. He also took pride in the sight of Dumbledore’s bandaged arm. Because he was a Wizard that made it a bite from a magical creature, and they could not heal straight away.
The man had been acting unusual ever since Harry got here. Unusual but not bad. He had apologised for his behaviour something Harry would have bet on never happening. And had been honest with him. Telling him straight up if he couldn’t answer a question instead of giving him vague replies like the rest of the adults did. Harry could see that Snape struggled to talk to Harry and seemed to be annoyed at himself for it. But truthfully Harry preferred Snape's straight to the point version. It was better than someone like Lockhart. Those sorts Harry found filled their chatter with lies and misdirection.
“Would the word slave suit you better, madam?” Severus replied coldly. Minerva looked like she was going to continue arguing before she took a deep breath and looked away.
He could feel his thoughts become foggy and he was shivering harder now. Nothing seemed quite real. He vaguely noticed Dumbledore snapping out orders and adults running to obey but none of the words were making any sense. Someone tried to take Cedric but Harry’s hands automatically clenched down as he held on, terrified if he let go something worse would happen. It took two adults to pry his fingers off one by one before they could get Harry to release him. Someone else put their hand under Harrys arm and pulling him to his feet, they dragged him off. They were halfway to the castle before Harry managed to look across and see Mad eye Moody. He thought the professor was saying something to him but his hearing still wasn’t working right and everything was muffled like they were talking underwater.
“Oh,” Severus shifted from foot to foot. Tom wasn’t holding on too tight, Severus could easily pull free at any moment, nor was Tom trying to move or position his hand. He was just holding it. Nothing else. It was surprisingly pleasant. Severus found it quite enjoyable.
“Pretend that you’re my mum? Just for a little while? I don’t remember what is like to have a mother, I just wanted to experience what it could have been like. Do you think that’s ok?”
“Next time, Sirius, it would be helpful if you ask before casting unknown spells,” Dumbledore scolded. “Alright, all into the kitchen please we need to get the meeting on the way.”
Harry couldn’t help his look of blatant disbelief. Why the hell would he ever go to this crazy murderer?
Severus sat back straight and still as stone keeping a bedside vigil. Dark eyes surveyed the skeletal chest as it shakily rose and fell. In truth, Severus was relieved for the opportunity to not move and gather his energy and magic. The last twenty-four hours had been overflowing with frantic movements and emotional blows. After a month of not finding even the faintest hint about the Dark Lord, he was awoken to his Mark summoning him to Voldemort's side.
This wasn’t anything like before, Severus had been right! Harry continued trying to do whatever he could to get more happy sighs from his Godfather.
“Would you look at this?” He said to Draco, reaching to run his hand over Draco’s chest. A stinging hex hit his fingers before he could make contact.
Harry listen to the pair of footsteps fade away but didn’t bother moving from his spot. He was surprised to hear Snape didn’t think their talk went well. From Harry’s point of view, it was fine, well as fine as these awkward talks could go. Snape neither dithered around not saying anything nor did he try and baby thing or make them too complicated.
Severus had been thoroughly enjoying being the recipient of Tom’s kisses and had for some time now wished that his Lord would take it further and bed him. He knew Tom was interested in progressing as he had felt the proof pressed against him hot and hard on many occasions. He had been wondering what was holding his Lord back and had to curse himself for a fool once he took the time to come out of his lovesick haze and looking back over their interactions realised Tom had never even kissed him until Severus initiated the first one. Which meant that Tom had been waiting for Severus.
“So how to figure out if they want it. The best way is to straight-up fucking ask them. ‘hi, I wanna share my firewhiskey with you, what do you say?’ and if they say yes, brilliant you can share the hell out of the firewhiskey. If they say no, then you gotta fucking man up and accept that not everyone wants to drink with you. But and here’s the thing Pup, you can’t just assume they want your firewhiskey. Like if someone is sleeping you wouldn’t pour firewhiskey down their throat, right?”
“Your clothes, they could have spells attached to them, and since they came from Malfoy, they are going to have to be destroyed. “
Harry’s breath hitch, he loosened his hold on Padfoot in shock, the words Dumbledore had spoken wouldn’t leave his head growing in power the longer they lingered. They dripped like acid searing through his veins.
Harry found that no matter how much he told himself to release Sirius and go with Dumbledore, he couldn’t. His body refused to let go. Now that the time had come Harry discovered that even with his mind figuring out it wasn’t as bad as he made it out to be. His body had different ideas and refused to go back to his abusers. Sirius was also not budging an inch. There was a sigh and a cluck of annoyance before powerful hands were tearing him out of Sirius embrace.
Draco couldn’t articulate just how pleased he was. He sat in the bed with Harry’s head in his lap as he slowly stroking his hand through Harrys hair. As far back as he could remember Draco had wanted someone to belong to him completely. He wanted them to give every aspect of themselves to him and him alone. He had dreams of this fable person who was Draco’s. One who he could show off to others and have them look upon him with envy. And they would be right to be envious for Draco would give them the best of everything and in return, they would choose Draco over everyone else.
But Harry had been throwing his normal spot on predictions out the window right from the time he was one year old and he wasn’t stopping now.
Author looks around themselves bewildered. This was it. They were done. They rock back and forward on the feet swinging their arms aimlessly. They are not sure what to do now.  They get a crooked little grin as they realise despite all their tricks and hiding and misdirection, they will miss having such a loyal bunch of readers following their every move.
“Fudge, please let's adjourn to my office for these are troubling times and we have much to discuss.”
“You can’t just ask him that!” Hermione said. “It doesn’t work that way, if he has it he could not realise it or they might have condition him to not tell us.”
“Forgive me, Severus, I am still coming to terms with the fact the man I thought I knew never existed.”
To the stage that he was waking up the whole house with his unnatural racket. Uncle Vernon in particular was most displeased. And an Uncle Vernon who had not gotten a good night sleep was an Uncle three times as bad as one who had. This fact had surprised Harry who originally thought that he couldn’t get any worse. He now knew there was always worse and to count his blessing that things were not going any further.
“lift your hips for me, Darling.” Severus did as he was asked and Tom placed a pillow under him tilting them. He then lay down between Severus’ legs. Their body’s flush against each other. Tom was keeping most of his weight off Severus, making sure that he wasn’t too heavy.
“These are what I was talking about,” Sirius said, twisting his arm to tap against two scars. One on either shoulder blade. Harry reached up and gently traced them. They were plucked and raised, but faded white with age. Whatever happened, it was a long time since then.
Harry rolled to his side struggling to breathe. He could feel his lungs expanded but they were not able to draw any air in through the blood. Panicking Harry could see black spots dancing before his eyes before he managed to draw back his lips and suck in a tiny amount of air through his clenched teeth. Keeping himself as still as possible Harry put all his focus into inhaling and exhaling through the tiny gaps.
Harry rose and walked over to Lucius side, drawing his wand. Lucius gave him a brief look of startlement before nodding his head. This was where he belonged. Protecting their Eros.
Severus had reeled back in shock. This could not be! He was incredulous that what he was seeing was real. But all questions of how the Dark Lord had gotten hold of him or why the saviour of the wizarding world was in such a state had to be put on hold. Potter’s life was hanging in the balance and until they could stabilise him nothing else mattered.
“Because of his kidnapping, he didn’t spend enough time with his relatives in the summer and the time needs to be made up.”
Harry took a deep breath; he would get nowhere by caring on like a kid chucking a tantrum. Severus had told him multiple times that all he needed to do was speak to an adult and help would be on hand. Harry had been highly doubtful of this, but circumstances being what they were, he was rapidly running out of choice. He took another breath and wrapped his arms around his middle fingers clenching around the opposite wrist. Merlin this was tough. He knew he needed to say it but it was so hard, his inside was twisting with anxiety. He opened his mouth, then closed it again when his throat closed up. Closing his eyes, he gathered together his courage and placed his shaky trust in the adults.
“Fuck this, I'm going home to get out of this heat. Going to play my x-box for a while. Wanta meet up once it cools down?” One of the boys said wiping his forehead. There was a murmur of agreeance and the gang split up leaving until only Dudley was left. He still had hold of Harrys arm keeping him in place. Harry was sitting on the ground the hand in Dudley meaty grip held above his head.
Dumbledore swept out of the room leaving Harry all alone. He lay down on the bed curling up into a little ball sheets pulled over his head. Screwing his eyes closed he concentrated on his breathing trying to slow it down while the Words slowly cemented themselves into his every bone.
It had been a secret pleasure of his, a way of holding himself above his colleges, his ability to spot abuse in the students. There hadn’t been a single case in Slytherin that he didn’t know about by the second week of the school year. And he was activity work on lessening the effects by the third week. There had been multiple times when he had seen signs in students from other House and he had promptly pointed them out to the other Heads. He never wanted a single child to suffer any longer than they already had and as such would never hold back from bringing it to light. The fact that deep within his crooked heart a tiny ball of smugness lit up every time this happened was something Severus had deem irrelevant. So long as the child received prompt help that was the important thing.
Severus frowned at Harry unsure whether that was an insult but his son was looking back at him thoughtfully so he let it go for the moment.
“You are mine now, and I will never let you go,” Tom whispered reverently to Severus who wrapped his arms around Tom holding him tight.
“Had enough you fucking sick perverts,” Sirius ranted. “Have you all got your jollies staring at a child? Got enough material for your fucking wank bank? Good, then piss off out of here.”
That night Harry woke the house as he screeched in fear. Vernon pounded to his room and pulling open the door grabbed Harry pulling him from the bed waking him up. He then began to belt Harrys cheeks and mouth bellowing
“I’m not abused,” came automatically out of Harry mouth but Severus ignored it for the moment. He knew most abused kids protested it out of habit.
Since Harry had heard Sirius say the same thing about a pigeon that had crapped on him, he didn’t worry that his godfather was about to go on a murder spree. Harry was extremely grateful for the cloak, however. Even though a bunch of responsible adults had been there and not raised an objection, he was glad that it was over. He hated it and it felt wrong, Severus had been encouraging him to listen to his feelings, and they had been screaming that what had just happened was not ok. But apparently, he was still screwed up, because not even Mrs Weasley hadn’t seemed to mind it. So, Harry was just going to chalk this one down in his book as another example of him being stupid and not knowing what was normal and ok.
“I’m following your wish. I’m doing what I want to do. Currently, I want to pamper my lover, and I am going to start by brushing his hair until I completely relax him. Then I am going to get him to lie down on the couch with his head in my lap, and I will be idly playing with his hair as I go over my correspondence. Having a lover sprawled in my lap is the best remedy to keeping me relaxed and helps me respond to the crisis that comes up in a thoughtful cleaver manor. Once I have finished all my paperwork, I will want to reward myself, so I will indulge my desires to see if I can kiss my lover in all the different ways I know how. I want to see if I can get my lover to come from my kisses alone. It will be difficult to achieve, but that is what I want.”
A desire for Draco to be here sprang up. Draco had always drawn people's attention off Harry and onto himself. Despite how selfish it was, Harry would have loved to have Draco come swooping in and strut himself around until everyone was looking at him and Harry could slink off to the shadows.
They were the only one's present, once Pomfrey had stuck her head out and seeing who it was waved them over before disappearing once more into her office. None the less Hermione cast a silencing charm and Harry dully recounted what had happened. Not looking at either of them keeping his face pressed up against the window.
Severus watched the breakfast crowd with mild interest, making sure his scowl didn’t shift from his face. When Hogwarts had restarted, it had been an awkward opening feast. Between the ministry toad, no boy hero, and the number of students not re-enrolling had been higher than estimated. All four houses had lost a quarter of their students. Severus knew that Minerva and Albus had expected some loss, but there had been a lot of parents who hadn’t bothered to inform the school of their decision. He had never been more thankful that he wasn’t in a higher position of power as the two of them had been in constant meetings.
“The Wizarding world is superb at seeing what they want to see and not what is really there, as you full well know. James Potter became their hero, and so they wanted to see him in you. ”
Slowly Severus reached into his pocket and withdrew an apple. Hiding his wand down in the grass from the sharp-eyed Grimm, he wordless cast a levitation charm and floated the apple over to Harry. His son watched the fruit come towards him with his head tilted. Once Severus had it hover in place Harry reached out with his free hand and poked the apple. When it didn’t disappear, a grin broke out on Harry’s face and he grabbed it eagerly, taking a huge bite then offering the apple to Sirius. Who sniffed it then also took a bite. Harry brought the apple back up and took another mouthful, munching happily. Sharing the fruit between them, they quickly consumed it. Severus internally wincing every time Harry took a bite after Sirius did. The drool shared between them was extremely off-putting.
Harry would normally come out about an hour later and Severus would spend the next few hours hand feeding his son. Whose attention span was worse than a gnat’s every gust of breeze or slightest movement from an insect distracted Harry. It had surprised Severus how patience he was as he would gently coax Harry to continue to eat.
Petunia shooed him all the way until he was outside then she closed the door. Harry sat down on the step wincing in the glare from the sun and reluctantly shoved his feet into the sneakers. He hated wearing them, especially during summer as his feet always feel like they were cooking in mini ovens. It wasn't helped that the shoes were more duct tape than any other material. Still, it was better than burring his feet on the hot tarmac when he was fleeing Dudley and his gang. Speaking of which he had best be on his way before he was caught.
“As if! Why would I talk to you? You murdered my parents!” Harry yelled the hot flush of anger shooting up him.
The next second a massive black dog appeared. Teeth gleaming as it let out a furious snarl. It leapt at Vernon knocking him to the floor and snapping its head down tore out his throat. Screams bounced off the walls. And there was a mad scramble of movement. Harry was kicked and trotted on as everyone tried to evade the snarling black mass of madness in their midst. Someone accidentally kicked him in the head, forcing him unconscious.
Perhaps I deserve it? The thought drifted quietly through Harry’s head as he tapped continually on the torc. That was a room full of goodies, and the only one to object was the crazy one. Maybe I am making it out to be a bigger thing than it is. It’s probably not as bad as I think it is. Harry lay there and the idea slowly cemented itself to his brain. I’m being a sook. There are others out there who have it so much worse off than I do. I have no right to complain or make a fuss.
Narcissa and Lucius had been watching the going on’s but now that everyone was settled, they went back to the long hair care session that had been interrupted. Severus sighed sadly. Now that both Eros and their mates were distracted Tom had no reason to continue to brush Severus’ hair and he would stop any second now. And yet Tom did not stop he continued taking a small section and brushing it until it gleamed then moving on to the next section.
“Come, Severus, let's leave the two of them to get acquainted. I’ll let out Lord know of this new development while you go and catch up on your sleep.” Seeing Severus about to refuse she over road him. “Don’t worry Draco will keep a close eye on Harry, and I will even get a house-elf to watch over them as well if you want.”
There were cries of wounded pride from the group and even Dumbledore reprimanded but Sirius wasn’t having any of it. He continued to cuss and curse as he led Harry out of the room and up the stairs.
Dumbledore stopped them just outside the front door. He turned and Harry could see his mouth moving but couldn’t hear a single thing over the sound of his heart galloping in his chest. Dumbledore continued to talk as Harry's panting increased and his eyes widened, his entire body flooded with fear and taught with tension, ready to flee at a moment’s notice.
“I should let you know I hoped to be the one receiving, the thought of penetrating anyone,” Severus had to pause for a moment and swallow harshly before continuing, “does not sit well with me,”
Harry’s eyes thank merlin were not as bad as Sirius, but they too were clouded with delirium. It would take time but Lady luck once more smiled on Harry, he will recover from this. Or he would recover from it, assuming that Severus could get him somewhere safe out of the reach of the rest of the world.
Of course, had they captured the actual moment Lucius reunited with Narcissa, they would have been in for a surprise. There was no well breed housewife embracing her husband with the hint of tears in her eyes there. Instead, it had been an all but feral creature who had been driven out of her mind with worry. After snarling everyone out of the room Narcissa had dived on him desperate to re-establish her claim and convince herself that he was really here back in her arms.
He had to be so careful with Harry. He had been horrified when his mother told him that Harry couldn’t afford to miss a single meal. He had thought he was doing the right thing by giving his mate what he wanted when he had allowed Harry to say no to the extra bowls.
“Harry, why don’t you go have a shower, we brought you some clothes and we can talk after alright?” Hermione said kindly.
Harry didn’t look convinced; Hell, Blaise wasn’t convinced, and he had been buddies with Draco since First year. The smug tosser could make more of an effort to convince the hero of the light before Blaise found himself splattered all over this courtyard.
“I have various members of the order out looking for him. Those who I can count on being discrete. I also have Miss Granger and Mr Weasley writing to him. I need you to check with others that have the Dark mark to see if they have heard of any whispers.”
“Ok, but not every black hair man wearing glasses is going to have hair like this,” Harry said, pointing to his head.
He hadn’t seen Harry so far this morning, but that wasn’t an unusual thing. Sirius came out to snarl at him as soon as he apparated as per their normal morning tradition. Once he saw it was Severus, he had stopped making noise but had huffed in annoyance and returned to the tent.
Sirius gave a sigh and Harry felt him relax, glad he had been right that this would help he continued and a moment later he felt a hand stroking his hair. Harry gave a please hum, he loved having someone run a hand through his hair. He didn’t think he would get any pleasure out of this besides being happy to make Sirius feel better, but the hand didn’t stop its clumsy stroking, sending pleasant tingles down his spine.
Tom quickly went over the starting rules and they began to play. The first couple of games were over ridiculously quickly as Tom had predicted, but he was pleased to see Harry learning from the game and improving his moves as time went on.
“Yes, alright you can groom my wings.” He stood up and guided Harry until he was sitting in seat Draco had just vacated. Draco spread Harry’s legs and knelt in-between them, resting on the cushion Harry had brought over. Harry eagerly opened the jar of oil and getting a small amount onto his fingers preened Draco’s pure white wings. Taking his time to make sure each feather got individual attention and care. Draco had his arms wrapped around Harry’s hips and was crooning happily, giving his mate a long hug in return.
Author would under different circumstances be very impressed with the readers creative skills, they had seen a bookmark being re shaped into a pitchfork. And the torches were lit with angry flaming comments.  But since such skill was being put in place to hunt the Author down, they would much prefer that their readers were a bunch of dumb rocks instead.
“Yes. Please,” Severus begged. Tom entered him in slow, gentle thrusts. Once he was buried to the hilt, he paused letting Severus acclimatise to him. Once they were ready, he became to move.
Narcissa was summoned. She was one of the rare fully qualified dark healers and her help was vital. She had taken a long look examining him before telling them the bad news. Healing Spells both Light and Dark worked by using the person own magic and body resources to power them. While Harry probably had enough magic to a least get him out of the critical stage, because of how malnourished he was there was no way that his body would be able to handle even the simplest healing spell. She had laminated that there were no more Cughtagh’s left as they could sing spells into a healing web. Something that provided all the energy and magic that the body could not.
A leaf sat in the palm of one of his hands and half-delirious he shredded it. Not a moment later he felt a hooking sensation behind his navel and the smallest bedroom of 4 Privet drive disappeared in a swirl of colour.
“Merlin’s saggy balls” He cried out in shock as Draco sauntered towards him. He was in nothing but some pants. His chest bare to accompany the magnificent white wings that flowed out from his shoulders. With all that flesh on sight, Blaise could see the wings were not the only thing to change. Draco’s body had transformed from a slim teenager into that of a mans. He was incredibly fit, and Blaise felt the first hints of arousal stirring within.
The uproar reaction to this statement meant that no one could understand a single thing that was said as the shouts echoed and bounced off the walls. Dumbledore held up and hand and slowly to noise faded away.
By the time they apparated outside of Privet Drive Harry had stopped himself from making noise but was now panting in fear. Everything was far too bright to look at and all sound was muffed, like he was listing from underwater. Dumbledore had been talking to him to the whole time since they left Grimmauld place, but Harry had not heard a single word.
Still, He didn’t know how he felt about Snape being his dad. On the one hand, going from having no parents to having a father sound awesome. But and it was a big but, while Harry like this new version of Snape he had only been like this for a couple of days and there was four years of Snape being a complete dick to Harry.
Harry wanted every bit of the intensity and possessive Draco offered, he seemed to soak up every bit of attention that Draco poured onto him and still ask for more. It looked like Draco had finally found the one person who could handle his version of dating. It wasn’t just Harry getting all he needed either. Blaise had never known Draco as settled and confident in his skin as he was now. Gone was the posturing and bragging trying to get everyone's attention and prove how important he was. Now that he had Harry's attention, Draco didn’t care what anyone else thought. Ironically, his indifference had only made him more interesting.
“I won’t make the choice for him, but he can’t make the choice for me either. I might not want a father.”
Harry stared at the creature in awe. He couldn’t name what sort it was with its feline body reptilian head and huge bat-like wings, but he felt such a strong sense of connection and familiarity. The creature had its wings spread open sheltering the angel that stood at its side. With teeth and claws bared ready to leap into action at any second. The angel was androgynous, Harry couldn’t tell if they were meant to be female or male or not. But what he did notice was they had one hand lightly laying on the neck of the creature. Restraining them.
“The combination of somewhere safe and surround by only those who love him is providing with Harry the best opportunity to heal from the damage his Obsciual form caused,” Narcissa said with calm, certainly her Dark healer knowledge coming in handy. She was leading Lucius into the room. He had a short gold chain running from one wrist band to the other. It was only a couple of links long, effectively stopping Lucius from being able to use either hand for anything. She sat down on the other armchair and removing her wand, she made a giant cushion appear at her feet.
“Mr Potter,” Dumbledore snapped. “That kind of behaviour is unacceptable, I had thought you would be the bigger person here and not hold the fact that your relatives are muggles against them. I am severely disappointed to see this is not true.”
Yet he was also the man who had been the first to spot that Harry wasn’t treated well. He had the chance to keep Harry as a prisoner but had let him go. And given him a way to free himself from the Dursley’s clutches. He had also helped heal Harry and got his followers to offer him shelter and dare he say it safety. He was even now taking time out of each day to spend it with Harry. Answering Harry’s questions and playing games with him.
Tom took pity on him, and after giving his hand a friendly squeeze, let go. Severus looked at his hand perplexed it now felt bereft, like it was missing something important.
“Great,” Sirius peeled the shirt the rest of the way off and stood in front of Harry, arms wide in a ta-da motion. Harry peered, fascinated. He stopped after a second to check Sirius face to see if he minded but he was grinning amused and gestured back to his torso. It was covered in blue and black marks and symbols.
Severus glanced back at the Grimm then flinched with shock. Sirius was staring directly at him, his silver eyes burning brightly and lips pulled back over wickedly sharp teeth in a silent snarl. Heart rabbiting it took a long moment for Severus to calm himself to see that Sirius had come no closer. Had not moved at all. Due no doubt to the hand still holding on to his ruff. Harry had his head tilted back looking at the sky humming tunelessly and swaying in the non-existent wind. Slowly his head lowered, and he stared aimlessly in Severus’ direction. After a moment, his eyes focused on Severus form. He looked at him with no recognition and mild curiosity.
Severus strode determinedly towards Tom’s bedroom. He knocked on the door, then entered with Tom’s permission.
“Oh,” Harry felt such a deep residence within him. That, that sounded perfect. Harry had always been a fighter and he knew he always would be. But to have someone else deal with his hated fame and leave him with only the concern that they were safe. Harry couldn’t think of anything he wanted more. It was exactly what he was looking for without even knowing it.
“Given the information, we have on hand, do you really think the memory is not going to be traumatic?” He asked gently. Severus flushed slightly and looked away. Tom allowed him to gather his composer and went back to his paperwork. A short time later Severus stood and stiffy asked
“OOO, he needs some fattening up. I cook him something special.” Molly said. There were other mutters and remarks about his body he heard stuff like
“If the Dark Lord was really back, someone here would have known about it. I think you’re full of shite old man.”
Harry nodded. He looked away and silence slowly settled over the room. Shifting slightly Draco looked to see what had so captivated Harry’s attention. He was gazing at the muscle on the arm Draco had been feeding him with. Draco couldn’t help puffing up pleased. He subtly flexed his forearm as Harry watched.
“I promise a hug from you always makes me feel so much fucking better, no matter what is going on. So how bout it?” Sirius asked opened his arms “Can I have one?”
Harry felt the slap of ice-cold rejection. This was something that was so hard for him to do, and he had gathered up his shaky courage, pushing himself to work through it. Only to have it backfire on him majorly. His breath came out in pants and his body trembled. Shock was protecting him from the negative emotions, but it was a flimsy wall that would hold up for long. He had once again fucked thing up. Here was more proof that he couldn’t do anything right. He had been trying to make Sirius feel better, but going by the horrified expression he had made things so much worse. The hot prickling sensation of tears began to build and Harry scrambled from the bed, not want Sirius to see his blubbering away.
“Yeah, Big fucking mistake. Couldn’t fix it once it was done. But the whole point of this shitty convo is to let you know I recognise an Eros’s claim when I fucking see one. Now please for the love of mercy tell me it’s not Lucius bloody Malfoy’s.”
Harry wiggled feeling the cold stone scrape across his back and the rough fibres of the robe burn his naked skin where it wasn’t protected with clothes. Still, the sensations didn’t make him cease his movement. He knew worse was coming. He would be thankful for these tiny annoyances soon and wishing that this was the only problem he had.
“Unfortunately, all tracking charms we had on him are no longer working. I can say with confidence that he is still alive, but beyond that, I can only guess.” Dumbledore frown and stroke his beard as he thought. “It is imperative for the War effort that we get Harry back alive as soon as possible.”
Severus bowed his head obediently, waiting for Tom to get up and move away. Instead, he felt the comb running through his hair again.
His mother had then said that as Harry wasn’t interested in sexual activity neither was Draco. She had then held his hand and said there was a chance that Harry might never be interested. Draco struggled to understand her concern. He knew logically that had he been told this a few days ago he would have been devastated at the thought of not ever feeling sexual arousal again. But that was before Harry become his mate. He couldn’t explain it, the words just would come to him to properly describe how having Harry in his life and the gift of Harry’s submission was worth so much more than sex. It was such a non-issue with him now that he would be completely fine for Harry and him to carry on the way they were for the rest of their lives.
The exclamations came from everyone still in the hallway. Dumbledore poked his head out of the kitchen.
Severus bit his lip in frustration. This was why he never wanted to be a teacher, or work with children. His people skill was dismal. He had never managed to convey with any decorum what was on his mind. It somehow became terrible muddled between his brain and his mouth. Ask him about potions and he could give a lecture on the subject for hours on end. But ask him to talk about anything else and his elegance and wit left him. There was a very good reason why he came across as a grumpy abrasive personality. It didn’t encourage people to hang around and talk with him.
Severus walked along the moor, his eyes searching for another clue as his heart slowly continued to break. Dumbledore had given him the heads up, there was an incidence at the Dursley residence. Severus arrived quick enough that he examined what was left of the house before the Auror’s arrived and warded the site. Severus saw Aurors making the sign to ward off evil when they thought no one was looking. There was no way to mistake the destruction as anything else than the work of an Obscurus.
Harry made an unsure noise and for the first time, Draco dropped his attitude, focusing completely on Potter.
While Severus slept protected in Tom’s lap. Tom continued to work on his multi-pronged plan to take over the Ministry. Dumbledore as ever was his biggest roadblock, but unlike when he was younger and started down this path, the power they controlled had changed. He was no longer a newly graduated youngster with pureblood heirs backing him. He was in the height of his maturity and had the backing of generations of rich, powerful families. And Dumbledore’s social power was waning. Helped along by Dumbledore crying wolf and Tom not rising to the bait but lying in wait. The public didn’t believe Dumbledore when he tried to claim that Tom has arisen once more. Who could blame them there was no proof being offered, and no one wanted to go back to those terrible times. Not even Tom. He did everything in his power to make sure the public never knew he had come back. As far as he was concerned Voldemort died that night in Halloween his ghost just took longer to get the message.
Alarmed Padfoot let out a loud bark drawing Madam Pomfrey from her office. She took one look at Harry and withdrew a calming draft. She didn’t bother trying to get him to drink it instead she vanished it straight into his stomach. Thankfully it didn’t take that long to kick in and Harrys tears slow down as the unnatural calm pressed down on his turbulent emotions. She held out a box of tissues and Harry took one blowing his nose which helped him to be able to take a proper breath. He still hadn’t let go of his death grip on Padfoot yet. She frowned at the dog but didn’t speak her objections as she could see that it was bringing comfort to him.
“They hold our leashes,” Lucius said reverently. “We are there to fight for them. To enter into battle in their stead. We give ourselves to them completely And In return, they love, cherish, worship and treasure us. They let us know when to fight and when to relax. We can put all our worries and fears into their hands and let them take care of us.”
Harry’s legs cut out, and he fell back into his seat. His stomach rolling as his inner fears were proven right. Here was a room full of adults fighting for justice and protecting the innocent, and the only one kicking up a fuss was Sirius. Who was yelling at Dumbledore, saying he won’t allow it and offering Harry protection. But Sirius was still recovering from the actions of the dementors, Harry had heard multiple members whisper about Sirius crazy behaviour.
Harry opened his eyes and was relieved to see the Malfoy’s guest bedroom walls. He had had another nightmare and thought for a moment that everything that had happened had been a dream. Turning his head, he could see the blurry shape in the bed next to his that he knew was Professor Snape. He had been there every time Harry cried out during the night, offering him either a soothing warm drink or reassuring him that all was well. That Harry was safe.
The information didn’t really register. Severus had looked over both results and confirmed they said the same thing that Harry was biological his. Then Narcissa had entered with the healing web still in its frame. They had hung it over the bed Harry was on, then got everything in place. The next lot of actions happened rapidly as there was no a second to waste. Voldemort dropped the Stasis spell, Narcissa instantly put Harry into a healing sleep and linked the web to him. Then Severus began to sing. There were no words involved just cascading notes. He was relieved to find out the knowledge that he would instinctively know which note to sing next was indeed correct. While he sang both the Dark Lord and Narcissa cast healing spell after healing spell. With each spell part of the web would shrivel up turn black and fall off as it transferred the healing into Harry using the magic Severus was singing.
Mortified, Harry prayed for it to end soon. He knew his body was beyond abhorrent, so why the hell was so many people still staring at it. Surely all they need was one look to see how disgusting it was. And yet everyone was still examining him.
“Brewing helps me centre myself, my Lord. And experimental brews are the best for getting my mind back to where it needs to be.”
“What’s that smell?” Ron asked scrunching his nose up in disgust. Harry could smell it too the sharp acidy sent. A second later it clicked what the warm wetness around his groin area and the smell meant and Harry face burned.
“Um... no?” Harry replied, surprised that Severus did, in fact, wash his hair and that it was only oily because he covered it in hair product.
“Shh, you know now. You’re mine.” Draco crooned as he swept up onto the bed laying Harry’s head down in his lap and curled his arms and legs around him.
Once the ex Aurors were taken away the next lot was a bunch of civilians. Their charges included vigilante, stalking, kidnapping, abuse of a minor, failing to report the abuse of a minor, aiding and abetting abuse of a minor and causing a magical child to become an Obscurial. The crowd was a lot more vengeful when these were read. When it came time for the accused to offer their defence Tom couldn’t help his eyebrow raising at the sheer amount of lunacy that came pouring out. He hated to say it, but he was reluctantly impressed with Dumbledore achieving the amount he had with such stupidity in his followers. They were sentenced to two years in Azkaban and could not be in the presence of minors for the rest of their life. The last part seemed to be the worse punishment for Molly Weasley. Her youngest two children were taken from her care and would be placed with foster families. She had tried to have them placed with their older siblings but was rebuffed as all her children were members of the illegal Order of the phoenix. She wouldn’t see either of them again until they reach their maturity. The same rule would apply to any grandchildren born into the family.
Lucius would walk away from this a Hero. The public would be clamming to give Lucius an Order of Merlin first-class medal. He would be held up as an example to others of what they should strive for. The Malfoy name would be more powerful and desired than before. Then when Tom slowly leaked the love story between Draco and Harry, well, they wouldn’t be able to do wrong in the public’s eye.
Seeing that they accepted the apple. Severus took off his wizarding gown and casting a warming charm on it once again floated it over to Harry. There was still snow lying about in patched with another storm heading their direction. Severus did not understand how Harry didn’t have a server case of frostbite he could only chalk it up to his magic. Even so, he could see the goose pimples covering Harry’s skin from the other side of the plateau.
“What just happened?” Severus bewilderedly asked the air as he gazed at the pair of teenagers one clinging desperately while the other stroked and petted soothingly.
As for his fame, yes, it had grown with his statues as the second person to ever live through becoming an Obsurical. But Harry wasn’t worried. Draco had a good handle on it. He had proven himself to be extremely apt at manipulating the fame to Harry's best interest. Between that and the star-crossed lover’s thing, Tom had leaked to the public the worse Harry had to suffer was some sappy looks thrown in his direction from mostly the female population. Nobody felt like they had the right to come up and disturb Harry any more. Which pleased him immensely.
Severus knew things would have to change. Starting with him. No matter how much justification he added to it the taste of humble pie was always one that stuck in his throat and was extremely hard to swallow. But he would do so none the less. Starting with apologising to Harry once he woke up.
Then there was the whole Potters thing to deal with. The fact his mum had hurt Snape was weighing on his mind, he wanted to fill guilty about, no he did feel guilty about it. But his talk with Voldemort was echoing loudly in his head and combatting the guilt. Could there be the chance he didn’t have to feel guilty about it? It's not like he had any say or control over what his mum did before he was even born, right?
It was interesting watching the two of them together, Blaise thought a couple of hours later. He had fooled around with Draco for a short time last year but had found him to be far too intense for his taste. What Draco wanted out of a relationship and what Blaise wanted were two completely different things. Using the skills, he had learnt from his mother Blaise broke off the relationship in such a way that they got to keep their friendship.
Harry slid down the door, horror filling him, and tears began to fall. He knew it; he knew that act was perverted and wrong. His instincts had been screaming at him, but like the foolish brain-dead idiot he was, he went ahead and did it, anyway. He must have completely misunderstood what Severus was trying to teach him. Fuck, he shouldn’t be allowed around people. He should be locked up, so he didn’t attack someone else. The fact it was done in his misguided attempt to show affection was no excuse.
“cause your family and family don’t...” He squirmed then went with the analogy they had been using “don’t drink firewhiskey together?”
Harry gave a weak smile then settled down to watch the clouds float by while half-listening to his best mates friendly bickering. His fingers tracing subconsciously over the leaf that had remained unspoken and unnoticed by all.
And while Dumbledore scrambled to maintain his position. Tom would work on Lucius release. He had smuggled in an anti-Dementor ward the second week of Lucius’ imprisonment. It was the same one they gave to all the guards to wear. It would keep the worse from him, but he would still feel some aspect of the Dementor’s aurora. It was enough to help Lucius keep his sanity, but he would still live in absolute misery.
Harry stepped out of the shower and looked at his body critically. The care, special feeding schedule, and exercise plan he had been following for the last four and a bit months were paying off. He no longer looked like a walking skeleton. You could no longer see every one of his ribs and his arms and legs no longer looked like bones covered with skin. He was still an ugly stick figure, but better than before. He would not force Draco to touch his disgusting body, even if it had improved. There was a long way to go before he would be worthy of having Draco touch his bare hand against Harry’s skin.
The Author hopes that they managed to entertain their readers even if they did shove cliff hangers at them and have random surprises pop out of them. If the readers walk way saying they enjoyed it then the Author will be satisfied that all their hard work and effort didn’t go to waste.
He planned to make precise lucid and comprehensible notes for the conversation about being Harry’s father before bringing it up. In the vague hope that it doesn't turn out such a mishmash disentanglement that his apology ended up as. The only saving grace was Harry was far too weak to move and so couldn’t go running for the hills.
“Six people have breached the gate and are on their way here. They are too close now for me to raise the Malfoy wards,” Lucius informed the room as he rose from the table. “Narcissa inform the Dark Lord what is happing then Ward yourself and the children in the ritual room. You should be able to cast some dark spells to help without being detected.”
“Ah yes, he has been sending troubled boys back to their ‘homes’ for a lack of a better word since the 1940s,” Voldemort sneered. “It seems he still hasn’t learnt that lesson. Such a shame.”
“I’m not surprised, even I have only witnessed the sight once. If you grow your hair out some more the weight will help bring some control to the lot.”
“They must be freezing, here let me help,” Draco summoned a hand towel and the slippers Blaise had given him one Christmas. Harry made a questioning hum as Draco knelt, ignoring that his pyjama pants became instantly soaked with icy water at the knees. Moving slowly and telegraphing what he was planning, Draco lifted one foot. Harry’s arms shot out and held onto Draco’s shoulders for balance. Draco thoroughly dried the foot, then slid it into the slipper. It was a white fluffy monstrosity that rose past the ankles. Draco had never worn them as Blaise had given them to him as a prank, but they were super warm and soft. Perfect for Harry. He repeated the process with the other foot, then stood up. He received uncertain looks from both Harry and Sirius, but promisingly in Draco’s eyes was the wisps slowly fading away.
Now that he finally understood and even better Harry was his. Draco felt the never-ending tension relax within him. He was going to show Harry why this was the best decision he ever made. And help him to never regret it.
Not wanting to make this second conversation between them to awkward Tom placed the Go board down on the table that was placed between the two armchairs and began to set out the pieces. The sight of which had intrigued Harry enough that he had lost the tense frame he was in and was now watching him with mild curiosity.
“With me,” he hurriedly added, then felt like a fool for doing so. Yet he didn’t want there to be any miscommunication about this. Severus had no desire to see or truthfully even think about Tom performing his sexual favours on anybody else.
And yet before him lay the evidence that his pride in his abilities was folly. The level of malnutrition Harry suffered from was not something that could be achieved in a single month. The amount time of which he had been with the muggles. It was systematic abuse years in the making. Which meant for years and quite possible right from the moment he set eyes on Harry he had been showing signs and Severus had let his schoolboy grudges and hatred blind him from the truth. This was another crippling blow for Severus had thought that he was always clear-sighted and saw the truth others hid from. Yet it seemed he was just a fallible as the rest of his colleagues.
The crowd puffed up pleased and nodded to one another. And reassuring their neighbours they had quite the eye for this or that curse.
Mr Malfoy sighed. “There are those who believe this and unfortunately it has become the accepted view by the public, but it couldn’t be further from the truth.”
Tries to scowl threateningly but it is very hard to look scary when you are shimmering with sparkles like a twilight vampire.
The sight of a muzzle full of teeth sticking out of a giant gown on a young boy was absurd. Yet Severus didn’t even crack a smile. He took it for the warning it was. He inclined his head in acknowledgement, then stood up and backed away. Once he was far enough away, he apparated out. He had a tracking charm in his gown so wasn’t afraid of not being able to find Harry again.
Harry looked at Mr Malfoy unsure. It sounded so much better than what he had been envisioning but he was hesitant to believe it could be true.
“Harry doesn’t normally spend Christmas holidays there. And it’s a week before school goes back why now?” Ron asked.
“He is in his own world. I noticed he is interacting with his surrounding a lot better than he has been when he is not currently present.”
Harry managed to avoid them for over an hour but then his luck ran out. One of Dudley's gang spotted him and the chase was on. Now if had just been Dudley then Harry would have been able to outrun him with no issues, but Dudley had gotten the bright idea to have some people in his gang whose sole purpose was to run whoever Dudley decide to terrorize to ground. Harry while he was fast didn’t have much stamina due to his poor eating habits.
Harry let out a happy sigh. He could feel his mind beginning to wander again and didn’t stop it. Severus and Narcissa as a Dark healer said it was both completely normal and acceptable for his mind to be fully present one moment then off with the pixies the next. The more he healed, the less it would happen. Severus had also told him there was only one other documented Obscurial that survived to return to a human, they didn’t know if Harry’s mind would recover completely or if he would spend the of his life with his mind occasional going elsewhere. They just didn’t know one way or the other. But they planned to take it one day at a time not worry about the future. Since both Severus and Draco had assured him it didn’t make one ounce of a difference to them, Harry was content to let it go.
“The Society for the Promotion of Evlish Welfare, yes.” She muttered as she thought. “Though, that was before I knew that it was a symbiotic relationship. Though some people don’t take that bond as the treasured gift it is.”  Her face twisted in a thoughtful frown.
“Mione, I’m just worried about you. I heard that there was an attack and I went by yours to see if you were alright and it was all boarded off and you were gone.” He loosened his grip slightly and pulled her to face him fully, resting his free hand on her shoulder. “I was so worried about you, I came here first thing. I’m so glad that you’re alright. You should come back home until your place is available again.” His deep blue eyes were pleading and he was rubbing his thumb across her wrist.
Hermione drew in a deep breath and steeled herself for her first official meeting with Narcissa Malfoy since the end of the war nearly ten years ago. She had so fully thrown herself into her career and into her failed relationship with Ronald that their social obligations never overlapped, until today. Draco and Harry had insisted that she come with them to their weekly tea with Narcissa, and plied her with promises of intelligent conversation, pleasant company, and a surprise they had refused to tell her.
“Ginny, of course, needed to be taught all of the domestic spells and skills she would need to catch a man and keep him.” Molly smiled and sipped her tea. “I tried teaching Hermione at the same time but you know how independent she is. Never wanted to be a bother.”
Just as she was about to speak, the door from the garden burst inward, “Sorry I’m late mum, but George had me ordering all sorts of supplies and this was the earliest I could sneak away.” The familiar lilt sank like a stone into the pit of Hermione’s stomach. No. Arthur had promised he would be distracted. He hadn’t seen her yet, she was certain. Hermione began scanning the room for exits, he was blocking the easiest route so it would have to be further into the burrow she decided, through the living room. The floo could be used if she was fast enough, but he had never given up on his quidditch and would likely be as fast as her, perhaps the front door, if she used her wand to open it as she ran. A quick twist once she reached the front gate and she would be home. It wasn’t ideal but it would have to do. She released Draco’s hand and went for her wand.
“My sincere apologies Potter had I known I swear I would have been far more respectful to you both.” Harry was losing the murder look, so Blaise continued. “It’s exactly as Draco said, I meant no harm, I was just roughhousing.”
Severus pushed out of the memory and leaned over the chair, throwing his guts up. His whole body broke out in shivers. Once he finished heaving, he collapsed back in the chair and closed his eyes concentrating on just breathing. Slowly his sense expanded and he realised the smell of the vomit was gone, someone must have banished the mess he made. He also had a cool cloth on the back of his neck and his hair was pulled back away from his face. Something was slowly stroking through it and the repetitive motions help settle him. Blinking open his eyes he was met with the sight of the Dark Lord calmly combing his hair. Seeing that Severus was aware once more Tom tied his hair back into a low tail then walked back to his seat.
And now somehow, he had a kid, a son who had been abused that he had to look after without hopefully adding more trauma to his shoulders. He lent back in his chair and pinched the bridge of his nose. He was doing a terrible job of reassuring the boy. It seemed his bedside manners were just as bad if you were family then if you weren’t.
Speaking of benefits the bedroom door creaked open and a slivery blond head poke in. Harry still had no idea how the hell it was that Draco was his mate. Having being raised muggle he was still a little hazy on the whole Mate concept. The Malfoy’s had been very understanding and had even lent Harry a couple of books on the subject. Two of them were just general overtures but the last book was on what it was like to be a Mate of an Eros. As Harry had read it a lot of it had sounded well kind of demeaning, like Harry’s position was nothing more than a doormat. A weak will idiot who was led around by the hand. He wanted to talk to someone about it but he was too afraid to bring it up to Draco or his parents. He didn’t want to turn Draco away from him. He might have only had Draco’s attention for the last three days but Harry was already well and truly addicted. He would do anything, be anything to make sure he got to keep it. Including being a doormat if that was what Draco wanted.
“Ah, I wondered if you would spot these.” Mr Malfoy said. He gave an elegant flicking motion baring both his wrist, each of them had a golden cuff on them. Harry got up and crept closer. Mr Malfoy didn’t seem to mind and held out one hand allowing Harry to examine the intricate details engraved on the cuff.
Smoke rose out of the cauldron so thick and dark that the figure that ascended was all but hidden from sight. They were nothing more than a vague shape towering over them.
Perhaps he has not realised Severus though, it is my duty to inform my Lord that he is free to desist.
Severus swirled out of the office and out of Hogwarts before going back to his home. He hadn’t been back since the Dark Lord had called him to help with Harry’s healing. A few quick cleaning charms and the house was as presentable as it ever was. There was not a lot waiting for him here, but his paranoia that someone from the order would check up on him made him reluctant to lead them back to the Malfoy’s. Instead, he made himself a cup of tea and idly flicked through the teacher’s newsletter. He had already corresponded with Minerva letting her know what he required for the next school year.
Author runs around furiously. The order of glitter had still not arrived and the bits of old fluff they had shoved in the story refused to stick to the last part of this chapter.
Harry figured he was in the hospital wing it smelt like it and he was pretty sure he recognised Madam Pomfrey voice. It was enough to assure him that he was safe for the moment and he fell asleep.
“And you’re my idiot.” Draco cooed. Harry made some grumbling noises, but Blaise noticed didn’t object past that.
Harry boggled at him, what? What the hell did that mean? Why wasn’t Voldemort attacking him, and what exactly did he expect?
So it wasn’t the amount, and Harry admitted to himself, that by the time came for his next little bowl of food his stomach was empty and ready for it. But his mind was struggling with it. Which would result in Harry even though he was feeling a bit hungry refusing to eat the food. He had gotten away with it for the first two days before Narcissa had caught on. She, in turn, had said something to Draco who had stopped allowing Harry to not eat and instead had spent the whole of yesterday figuring out different ways to coaxed Harry into eating. Harry had a feeling that Draco was going to be the same today.
Pomona drew out a parchment and scribbled the ideas down on it. Filius and Minerva leant over her, adding their thoughts.
And yet here was Harry. Severus observed his son breathing slowly. It was an exquisite form of torture to be made to watch a child you never knew you had as they lay recovering in a healing bed. And yet Severus would not want to be anywhere else. As painful as this was, he knew it would be so much worse to be parted from the boy’s side and not know whether he continued to draw in breaths. Or if his chest stilled and his heart cease to move and Severus wasn’t on hand to give him life once more. Severus roughly told himself to snap out of it. Focus on the now, Harry was safely tucked into bed and He was permitted to kept bedside vigil over his son.
Degradation for his appearance once again make its presence known overriding his fear. Bitterly he spat out the truth.
Severus nodded then walked out the door leaving the oblivious teenagers behind. He shifted wondering the best way to bring up his concern.
Tom paused and disappointment settled heavy in Severus stomach as Tom removed the comb from his hair. Fingers under his chin made him rase his face, so he was looking at Tom.
Tom led Severus over to the chairs and got him to sit down. He then sat across from him and raising his wand gave Severus the curtsy of speaking the spell out loud.
“Do you want me to brush your hair too, Harry?” Draco offered. Harry looked at him unsure and hummed non-committedly, tapping his torc. He then spun around and walked out of the room determinedly.
Harry hadn’t brought up the fact Severus was his father, but they had been having daily talks about his abuse. Not that he admitted it. Still, they had been making progress Severus had been surprised to find that even with his lack of grandiloquent skill he had been able to reach Harry and help him understand what was and was not appropriate behaviour. In the process of which had left Severus with enough tales that in a moment of insanity he had gotten drunk burst into the Dark Lord bedroom in the middle of the night and demanded that the filthy Muggles be slaughtered with extreme prejudices. He still wasn’t sure how that night ended, vague flashed of being held in a warm embrace, a voice whispering assurances, and being tucked into bed with a body wrapped around his were products of his drunken imagination. At least he was all but sure that’s all they were. Those people who dared to call themselves Harry’s family were the worst muggles.
“Good boy,” Draco praised. He slowly repeated the action whispering praises as Harry kept his eyes closes and let Draco fed him. Once the bowl was finished Draco rewarded Harry with a strawberry. He smiled as his mate gobbled it down then opened his mouth demanded for another which Draco indulged him. Draco found himself whispering praises and sweet encouragement down on Harry who soaked it up greedily.
“Open your mouth Potter” Dudley crowed. Harry looked at the fat penis flapping in his face then up at his obese cousin. With the threat of future violence held over his head like the sword of Damocles Harry opened his mouth.
Severus squirmed slightly, warmth and embarrassment flowing through him as he dared to utter his Lord’s name.
“The Boy-who-lived,” Voldemort stepped forward out of the smoke and Harry could see him clearly for the first time. Heart jack rabbited in his chest, pounded away Harry froze in fear. The pale sickly skin gleamed in the moonlight. Harry found it impossible to look away from the red eyes like a mouse frozen beneath a snake hypnotized gaze. The only part of him that was moving was his heart as it galloped.
Harry flushed at the slightly sarcastic tone Tom had used. He peeked at the older man but saw that Tom was happy to continue with this line of questions.
Severus was most reluctant to pause the saga once they had finished the first part of it, but his throat was becoming quite swollen and he knew he was done for the day. He explained that to Harry who looked mightily disappointed but let him leave without any hassle. Severus walked away concluding that though he completely bollocks up the conversation even with all his notes and prep work. He at least could draw the smallest amount of comfort in the knowledge that his storytelling skills were still up to par.
Knowing that no one could see his face Tom allowed himself to grin savagely pleased. All the hurt and torment that he and other children had suffered under Dumbledore rein was finally being paid for. The Dementor retreated, leaving behind the still living but soulless corpse. The crowd broke into a discussion on what to do with the living body. After much toing and froing three quick brawls and a debate, they agreed they would place the body in Knockturn’s duelling hall for people to practice their spellwork on until it lived no more.
Harry had never had anyone own up to their past mistakes and wasn’t sure what it meant that Voldemort was doing so now to him.
“Right, I’m off, I’ll see the pair of you on Monday. Count with me only a week to go till the Christmas holiday.”
“Voldemort has returned!” Dumbledore yelled. The whole pub fell silent at this. Seeing this, Dumbledore rose to his feet, desperate as he had no other support to plead his case. “Voldemort has arisen and is raining chaos and destruction down upon Brittan. You must stand up and fight against him.” There was a long moment where no one spoke, then a rose rang out.
“Yeah, I’m cool. I don’t care if other people want to walk around without clothes just so long as they don’t make me do the same.”
Lucius walked through the door and was immediately engulfed by his Mate and wife’s embrace. The flashes of multiple camera’s temporarily blinded him as the media scrambled to capture the moment the new hero reunited with his wife.
“Yes, there is,” Severus took a deep breath and reminded himself that not only Gryffindors could be brave. “I want you to engage in sexual intercourse,” He ignored the knowledge that he was flushing as he talked.
None of his reading however had prepared him for the way he would feel as Tom slowly undressed him. The sensation of his broad hands doing a long sweeping glide over each bit of skin as it was revealed. To say nothing of the way his heart fluttered as Tom asked permission before each new piece of clothing. When Tom wasn’t whispering “May I?” he was drugging Severus with deep kisses.
Harry nodded his head. He hadn’t said the word abuse because it wasn’t true and even if it was, he didn’t want people to get stuck on that point there were much more important things to worry about.
“There doesn't need to be a trial, it's obvious what happened, Black must have been working in cahoots with Pettigrew and the two of them tried to finish the job they started in Halloween. They killed one boy but missed the second.”
His heart gave a little forlorn twitch. the months they had spent together had shown Harry just who Severus was and had this been a perfect world, Harry would have loved to have Severus as his father. He couldn’t think of anyone better. But only good boy’s got Father’s like Severus. And Harry, well Harry was the furthest thing from a good boy.
“Everyone take their seat,” Dumbledore cried out, stopping the two Gryffindors from any further remarks.
Harry nodded looking down at his blanket miserably. “They want the boy-who-lived, their fairy-tale hero not me.”
Draco sat down on the bed in front of him and it was only now that Harry saw that he was carrying a covered tray. He had been far too busy gazing at all the skin available trying to categorise what had changed overnight and what was still the same.
His serpent opened the door and gave him a brief bow. Tom had asked both him and the Malfoy’s not to bother with the subjugation but understood that it would take time for his loyal followers to comply. He had done far too good a job of training them in the first place. Like all things he had done while under the influence of his Horcruxes it made a lot of mess for him to come back and fix.
“Harry is not a possession to claim. You can’t just come storming in here and declare that he is yours without a bye your leave. He will not be the latest in a long list of items that you have stamped your foot and demanded to have only to discard when something new catches your eye.”
“I see, this is most troubling,” Dumbledore mussed, “You said Voldemort didn’t attack you because you were too skinny? And he wants to talk with you?”
“Don’t worry Harry, we are here for you and the adults will make sure you-know-who doesn't trick you into a trap,” Hermione offered and Ron nodded.
Tom knew it would shock the public of just how many children Dumbledore had sent back to their abusers. He had a feeling it would be more than just him, Severus and Harry.
“But even if you or any kid actual said yes, it doesn’t count. You don’t offer firewhiskey to kids, cause they’re too young to drink it.”
Vernon let out a wordless bellow of rage and grabbed Harry by the hair on his crown, lifting him into the air. Harrys feet flailed around wildly. Both his hands grabbing hold of Vernon’s wrist, trying to take some pressure off his scalp.
“Which in the case of my son and yourself, would mean that you would protect him from all harm and he would deal with all the issues and hassle of being the Boy-Who-Lived.”
He put his glasses on and sat up, trying to move quietly so as not to bother Snape. He had to keep checking on Harry’s health during the night which was why they were sharing a bedroom. Surprisingly Harry had yet to object to this. He kept waiting for his mind to react negatively to this whole thing. Merlin knew had this happened the summer before last he would have been screaming bloody murder and trying to escape, but the last school year had been a huge drain on him, and not to mention the end of the torment. Then this summer had been the worse by far. So pretty much he had had a year of the so call light treating him with suspicion, calling him a liar and cheat letting three whole school turn on him. Then abandoning him to the muggles. In this twisted version, he guessed it made sense that the Dark were the ones to care for him and look after him.
Tom wrote out another quick message placed it with the rest to be sent off later that day. He planned to help whip up the fires of outrage for what happened to Harry. It would not only help get Dumbledore out of the picture but open up doors for Tom to put measures in place so that another young magical child would not suffer what Severus, Harry and himself to name a few had gone through.
He turned the water on as hot as it could go then stepped under fully clothed. He aggressively pulled off his top and pants and threw them into the corner then scrubbed his skin with soap until it was red raw. He stepped out and roughly dried himself ignoring the painful sensation of the cores towel against his sensitive skin. With practised motions, he got dressed and headed back out.
Severus looked a bit stunned at the fact Tom was giving him so much free rein in this. Tom hated that look but once again had no one but himself to blame for it. He wanted intelligent people to surround him who weren’t afraid to think for themselves. In the Malfoy’s and Severus, he had the intelligence he just had to work on encouraging them to use it in his presence.
Harry stared at him, astonished. How on earth did he guess that? Sirius laughed at the stupefied look on Harry's face, then started to pull his shirt off. He paused halfway with his arms stuck in the air and his face half-covered.
“Dumbledore won’t let me see him. Every excuse I come up with he has a corresponding rebuttal for.” He pulled his hair, frustrated. “I can’t push for more because I never want Dumbledore to get his hands on the information about Harry’s true parenthood. He would instantly twist and use it for the greater good. And I will not have Harry chained to slavery the way he has me. I know it’s not logical but I feel like I’m being torn apart, the thought of my child in their clutches and out of my reach is highly distressing. I’m finding it increasingly difficult to live with this decision. Fatherhood has made me lose what tiny grasp and pride I had on my self-control. Any yet I cannot shake the feeling he is in danger and I am not on hand to help him.”
Besides from comments on the game neither of them had said anything else to each other but that suited Tom fine. All he was hoping to achieve today was getting Harry use to his presence. He planed to slowly get Harry to be comfortable enough to allow Tom to ask him some questions. But that wouldn’t happen for quite some time yet.
Slightly concerned he had checked with his Mother worried that because he had come into his inheritance early, he had broken something important. Narcissa had sat him done and explained that that wasn’t the case at all. There had been another case documented of an Eros who came early in their teens and that Eros and mate had become parents nine months later.
Tom folded up the paper, amazed that Dumbledore had kept it quiet as long as he had. He read just enough to know now was the perfect time to whisper in the right ears about Dumbledore rein at Hogwarts. If he so badly failed the boy hero, had he failed in other area unseen behind school walls?
“That will be one of the first things I will recommend that they change,” Filius stated firmly. “More teachers on hand will only help.”
“To prove my good intentions and that I mean you no harm, I'm giving you your freedom. The cup is still a portkey, all you need do it touch it and it will return you to Hogwarts.”
Tom finally releasing Severus and seating them both on the opposite couch. “How is Harry today?” He directed at Draco.
“Have you ever seen Severus’ hair just after he has showered but before he coats it in Potion retardant?”
His mind had decided that small dark spaces were the best to hide in. His childhood conditioning coming back to him. If he was in his cupboard, then he was safe from harm. Once settled back into his spot Harry shoved one pair of socks into his mouth and unrolling the other pair he knotted one end together then tied it around his mouth keeping the socks in place. Harry prayed that his makeshift gag would work and muffle any noise he made during the night. He knew better than to think he wouldn’t make a sound.
The court session opened with three Aurors being escorted in by their colleges. Amelia Bones stood up and began to talk. The beginning of it was political waffling that every court opened with Tom didn’t bother to pay attention to it. The charges were read, the most interest been entry without a warrant, false imprisonment, and aiding and abetting abuse of a minor. The crowd muttering darkly before it came time for the accused to defend themselves.
Severus was about to tell Harry that he was currently in Malfoy Manor when a possessive snarl broke out.
“Cause sometimes they don’t have a choice, like if someone was under the imperius curse, or some dickward said if you don’t drink my firewhiskey I’m going to hurt you.”
Harry found that when he was with Ron and Hermione, he could no longer connect with them. He had, had so much happen to him that they hadn’t been there for that and had changed so much that he couldn’t find much in common with them anymore. They would always be his childhood friends, but they were heading in one direction and Harry was going in another. He didn’t hate them or anything like that he just grew apart from them. The Golden trio had their moment in the spotlight, but now listing to them complain about school work and mean teachers, or plot how to fight Voldemort, Harry knew that they were no longer seeing eye to eye on so many fundamental ideas. So he would use every excuse to leave the two of them and go hunt out his Godfather. Who was always so very pleased whenever Harry wanted to spend time with him. The two of them would wander through the house and then once they had found each other they would disappear from the rest of the Order’s sight. Neither one had any interest in being ordered to either clean or listen to plans they could not partake in.
Hermione got Harry to sit in-between herself and Ron and she loaded a plate full of food and place it before him.
Yes everyone wanted to know how Severus was Harry's father but is feeling pretty confident this want what they were hoping for.
Author checks on their Glitter and butterfly stock. They are running very low. Author bits lips nervously then check on where they are in the story.
“I think not Headmaster,” Fudge drew himself up. “I have much to do and no time to listen to an old man's waffling on.” He placed his bowler hat on his head and stalked out of the room in wounded dignity.
“However, none of that changes the fact that I would like to talk to you. So far, we have only communicated through intermediates and things can get lost in translation. Unfortunately, we can’t talk now.”
His poor little boy had been so abused that he turned into an Obscurial. Severus didn’t bothered to report back to Albus. He reached his limit. He knew that Albus would get the information some other way,would receive it a lot sooner than the public. There would be a mad scramble to cover their asses, once the public found out that their hero the boy-who-lived under the care of the light and its Leader Dumbledore had become an Obscurial they would be howling for Albus blood.
“Madam Pomfrey said you can go down to breakfast with us but then you are to come back and she will be keeping you for half the day before she decided whether to let you go or not,” Hermione said.
“It was a pleasure having you work as our colleague and I hope life outside of Hogwarts treats you well.” Severus stood as the rest of them got up and allowed each of them to embrace him. He stiffly patted their backs and was pleased that none of them drew it out. As he was exiting the door Minerva called out.
When he went home, it was with the information that he would not be going back to Hogwarts and neither was Draco. He kept the information about Harry to himself. His mother nodded and penned a note to Narcissa to see if she would be interested in combining lessons for their sons so they wouldn’t be fighting over the best tutors.
Harry was getting desperate for some water by now his room was a heat box with the sun shining down on it and no air coming through the window that had been glued shut. His mouth and cheeks were still sore from the hits from his uncle. But Harry’s mouth was as dry as a desert He could barley unstick his tongue from the roof and he had stopped swallowing a while ago as there was nothing for him to swallow. His lips were cracked and even though it was baking in his room Harry was no longer sweating. He knew he needed to get some water into him and this was probably one of the quickest ways to go about it. So he got to his knees obediently.
Harry threw himself into his Godfathers warm embrace. Sirius arms holding him tight and he had to admit that Sirius was right. This was much nicer than the blow job. Sirius stood up and carried Harry back over to the bed. Once there, he got them so they were laying down but still hugging each other.
“Now, Minerva, don’t be too hard on the Lad,” Filius interrupted. “There is a reason Severus is not under suspicion like the three of us.”
“Yes, you do, your gay, you love it,” Dudley said dismissively. He looked at Piers and said, “Go on then.”
Something rushed past him and Severus found himself looking at his godson who was hovering in front of Harry’s bed, blocking Severus view.
Tom spent the next half an hour leisurely sipping from his drink and watching Dumbledore. He was not the only one. Most of the pub was watching, interested. Some enterprising soul had a book-running with people placing bets on how long he would survive.
By the time he walked out of the office, Severus’ lips were throbbing with the amount of attention they had received and his hair was completely mused. He walked absentminded back to his room and collapsed on his bed. His worry for Harry had not gone away, but now he had something pleasant to dwell on before he fell asleep.
And Harry found himself swept off his feet as his godfather clutched him tight. There were ugly mutters as people squeezed past, but Sirius paid them no mind. When he released Harry his eyes flickered down and caught sight of the torc. Instantly Sirius placed his hands either side of Harry’s neck and barked out a word the Harry recognised was Enochian. The backlash of the spell threw everyone but Harry and Sirius off their feet.
Sirius ducked his head and muttered with petulance. “I just frigging wanted to make sure it really was Harry and not some bloody trick.”
He surfaced again to heated whispers. His body felt like it weighed a ton and there was no way that he could control even the smallest part. It also felt like his eyes were glued closed. Unable to move he listen as the words faded in and out to the argument.
“Like, like if a boy tells you to suck his cock or he’ll get an adult to hurt you, and you do it without fighting, then you weren’t really saying yes?” Harry asked shyly.
“Not yet, but he is in the process. Hopefully, now he had Harry in his arms and can see that he is no longer in any danger Draco will slow down otherwise he is in for a painful night. Growing wings and opening the emphatic sense is better done over a week then all at once.”
Harry Potter stalked towards him; his green eyes blazed with power. His glasses amplified the feral look being shot his way. Blaise backed up even more. He was Slytherin, there was no way he was taking on someone who could outwit a dragon. Not even for someone pretty as Draco. Yes, Draco was his friend, but Blaise knew his strengths it was every man for himself. Harry Potter spent the whole of last year proving he could take on people three years his senior and beat them all. No way was Blaise going to challenge him for anything. For a midget, Harry had some balls and skills on him.
Harry didn’t bother pointing out that he didn’t want to do this either, just it was better than the alternative.
“You hid it? Wow, thanks. No really thanks, you do not understand how much this means to me.” Harry said.
“Yes, well if they don’t want the whole topic to end in total disarray, intelligent people come prepared.”
Tom looked at him then he joined Severus on the day bed stretching out and slotting Severus alongside him. He cupped Severus face and placed tender kisses on his eyelids, then cheekbone, then the corner of his jaw, then coming back up to his chin before finally his lips. In what was becoming his trademark move, Tom slowly and thoroughly kissed him. Dominating and claiming every tiny bit. When he slowly drew back Severus was completely boneless in his arms.
“Yeah, we do. You can actually get some really fucking awesome shite. Ones that move or change colour. But what you are currently feasting your eyes on my young Progslett are bloody awesome prison tats.”
The reporters surged up at this once more, shouting their questions. Both Malfoys ignored them, and with the help of some Aurors who escorted them out of the ministry. Once free Narcissa apparated them both to the safe house. They wouldn’t open up Malfoy manor until the trials for both Lucius and the Order were all officially done.
This was his son, Merlin dammit, and he would no longer let others control how either of them lived. They had their chance, and they blew it. It was time Severus took his rightful place and raise his son as his own.
“Alright Pup, let’s see if you understood my fucking rambling explanation. Why was what happened between us not cool?”
Lucius had not said a single thing but had a completely relaxed expression. He was tilting his head a fraction leaning into the grip Narcissa had on him and baring his throat. That told Severus more than he wanted to know about his friends love lives so he looked away.
“He had artificially messy hairstyle that no doubt cost quite a few gallons at the barbers to maintain. I have been informed it was quite the rage.”
The eldest of the lot ranted and raved, muttering about boogie men hiding in the shadow, ready to stab people and constant vigilance. They sentenced him to a lifetime sentence. The second one was wiser and besides from admitting to all wrongdoing and offering his apology said nothing else. Shackbolt was his name. He was stripped of his rank and shield and sentenced to fifteen years with a review possible in ten. The youngest was still a trainee and since she had been following both her trainer and a senior Aurors lead. Combined with the fact she had not been present for most of the atrocities meant the court was lenient with her. She would have to start her complete training from the beginning again after she completed her two years of house arrest.
This was the last straw for Harry’s magic, which finally snapped and burst out of him, fuelled by years of pain and terror it manifested as a black fluid like cloud that expanded rapidly. It lashed out, destroying everything it touched. Leaving nothing but broken splitters in its wake. Growing bigger powered by the mass amount of magic and pain it consumed Harry completely, a moment later it swallowed the Grimm then seemed to take obscene pleasure in destroying everything it could, leaving nothing but splinters and body pieces in its wake.
Harry bit his lip and looked down at the floor. He knew he was inadequate, that his performance was sub-par. Foolishly he had hoped his godfather wouldn’t hold that against him, but it was not to be. Even those who loved him had issues with his actions. And how could they not? Harry knew that he was dirty and unclean. It didn’t matter how often he washed; he was stained right down to the very bone. He would give anything not to have to listen to his last remaining family tell him just how wrong he was. He didn’t want to hear Sirius yell at him. He had never heard such a serious tone come from his Godfather before. But he knew that he deserved it. He had made things so much worse and he knew it was just because Sirius had a good heart and would always do the right thing even if it was distasteful that Sirius was even bothering to waste his time on telling Harry that he had fucked up instead of dismissing him completely.
“No. I’m not going to brunch with your family looking debauched. They already tease me mercilessly about the last time.” Draco crossed his arms and pouted.
“Amuse me? Mm, I suppose.” She smiled and cast her eyes down in a false show of modesty. “It has been a while since I last dressed like this, especially for myself.” her voice came out in a murmur as she laid her head on his shoulder. “It’s refreshing, and a bit exciting really, to see that I can have that effect on people.”
“Harry, was that… Did you… Was that an unforgivable?” Susan whispered incredulously. A smile was barely contained behind her stern look at Harry.
“Right. I’ll keep that in mind next time I ask an immortal being to teach me something they could have used words to convey but chose to foist the memories upon me instead.” Harry straightened up and glared at the spectre before him. Trust Death to try and annoy him after being ignored all these years. If he had known that being Master of Death would saddle him with this immortal git he would have taken his chances with Riddle without the Elder Wand.
“George! You have company. Stop being a hermit in that lab of yours.” With a flick of her wand she locked the doors and flipped the sign to indicate their closure.
“Now mum, you know Hermione likes her job almost as much as she likes Crookshanks. There’s no sense trying to change that.” Percy jumped to her defense and waved a sausage speared on his fork in emphasis.
The elf threw the French doors wide and ushered Hermione into the gardens where a dining table had been placed amidst a courtyard surrounded by a riot of colorful flowers and shrubbery. Narcissa sat at the head of the table, set for nine with gilt edged china, sipping her tea.
“She’s right, dear. If you don’t have control over yourself it can leave lasting damage behind. I would recommend you put a very mild compulsion on it that if it is something the person is inclined to share, or do, then it makes it easier for them to say or do those things. If they are unwilling it must not force them. A bit like the way alcohol loosens the inhibitions.” Narcissa’s steely eyes froze George to the spot, the color rising on his cheeks as he realized what kind of things could come of the product as it was. He nodded quickly and dropped the subject. A silence falling over the table.
“That IS what partners do, isn’t it Granger? Have each other’s backs when they need it?” Draco realized his mis-step a moment too late and attempted to steer back to a safer tactic. “Harry and I want to support you as best we can.” He grimaced as she pulled her hands away and stood, staring down at him.
At her words Draco ground his growing erection into her bum and bit down on her bare shoulder in earnest, sucking gently to leave a small mouth-shaped bruise behind. He raised up on his knees, pushing Hermione up to hers, pinning her tight between the two of them. He released her shoulder and pulled Harry in for a kiss. “Potter. Make her ours. Make her understand.” His voice was growing desperate as his love swelled within him at her declaration.
His laugh sent chills down her spine, she noticed his pupils dilating. He was enjoying their banter. Good. She had missed being able to be open with others without thinking what Ronald would say. She had missed being able to flirt with others. If she had given any kind of positive attention to another in front of him it would always end up in one of their blow outs. Her smile faded.
“On to happier topics. Mister Potter, just when do you plan on making an honest man out of my dragon?” Narcissa smirked as the boys squirmed under her scrutiny.
Suddenly there was a blossom of warmth in her chest. A pair of familiar grey eyes were suddenly in her vision, taking up most of what was left that wasn’t blackened around the edges. Warmth landed on her shoulders and she was vaguely aware of words breaking through the humming. Then suddenly her thoughts stilled and she could feel him there, in her mind. A cascade of warmth and light chasing back the negativity.
“Closed another one, my dream team?” Harry grinned at them, but it faded when he caught Hermione’s scowl. “Oh, no, what’s gone wrong this time?” He asked as he pinched the bridge of his nose, pushing his glasses askew.
“I know, Harry, but she has to know that we care enough about her to protect her from harm.” Draco frowned down at his tea as he spoke. “We can make her see the sense in staying here, where it’s safe, while we investigate. Especially since neither she nor I will be on this case. You will have to be the one funneling us, her, information about it.” Their eyes met and Harry nodded slightly.
Once the antidotes had been labelled, in Severus’s tight spiked hand, he packed them into a segmented satchel that was padded. “I’ve already finished the other antidote. This one, however, was being a pain in my arse.” He grumbled as he slung the bag over his shoulder and straightened his robes which had been skewed in the brewing process.
Narcissa’s teacup failed to hide her smile directed toward the pair. “Thank you, Alice. Please bring the others when they arrive. Hermione and I are going to have a short chat while we wait.” She tipped a slight nod toward the elf and gestured for Hermione to take the seat at her left.
Family. Hermione glanced around, her heart aching with the love she felt, her gaze passing over Bill, Percy, George, and falling to Arthur sitting at Narcissa’s right hand. These people were her family and had chosen to keep her.
Hermione had sequestered herself in Harry’s library after she finished her meal. The color in her cheeks at Draco’s threat had taken far too long to abate. The dryest book in the library did little to distract her from the heat between her legs. Since being released from the potion induced subservience her libido had been in overdrive over the smallest things. Apparently suppressing your instincts and desires tended to result in an overactive response when the right stimulus was applied. Apparently, for her, that stimulus was her very otherwise involved partner making threats to redden her arse with his bare hands.
“Oh, just the one for George, he asked for one featuring a broom, a quaffle, and a beater’s bat. I think he had mentioned a special event for Angelina coming up. I was happy to do so, of course. Oh I hope he’s planning to propose.” Molly beamed happily at him. Clearly at ease in his presence.
Hermione laughed at the girl’s enthusiasm and shook her head. “I’m surprised they still talk about that. Come on, let’s go let Kensington down easy, yeah?” She tilted her head toward the door and they made their way down to the training rooms. Hermione would have to give Kensington a hard ‘no’ on helping with the trainees. Every new class it never failed he would ask and refuse to take her no as final.
An owl, carrying a lavender colored envelope, swooped into the room and alighted on the high back of a chair, sticking its leg out for him to take the letter. He absently thanked the bird and petted its feathers, turning the envelope over to reveal his mother’s familiar cursive that read ‘my dragon’. He broke the wax seal and read the missive inviting him, his betrothed, and their partner in crime solving to an early evening tea with her. Noticing the owl awaiting his response he quickly penned a note that the next evening would be preferable as he would also like to arrange for the Weasleys to join them, briefly explaining the row at the family brunch. He folded the reply, stuffed it into a small leather tube, and tied it around the owl’s leg.
Harry pried Hermione from Arthur and took her through the floo, leaving Draco to say their goodbyes.
Draco stepped up beside her to peruse the information. “The Patils take the bond seriously, you know. I know you had a thing for freeing house elves when we were younger. SPEW, wasn’t it?” A flick of his wand brought a family photo of the Patils and their ten house elves forward to float in front of them.
“Alright Archimedes, I know she’s waiting. Get home.” He stroked a finger one last time down the owl’s feathers and went back to his task of setting the table for their romantic dinner date. Though Granger would never call it that. It most certainly was a date to him. He wanted to impress her with his thoughtfulness and charms skills. He had just set the wine glasses out as laughter filled the room. Harry and Hermione bursting into the room, arms linked, laughing like they were back in Hogwarts. Draco’s heart ached at the sight.
“Master Harry, you are still mortal. You ought to remember to breathe. We can’t have you joining me sooner than you are expected, after all.” Death let out a chuckle, obviously he thought he was funny.
Draco scoffed at her and smirked, “Never would have guessed.” He reached down and patted her knee gently. The intimate contact, innocent as it was, caused a small gasp to be drawn from her.
Thank you everyone who has commented and left kudos and bookmarked the story. Sometimes I let my Depression make me feel like I am not enough but knowing that there are people out there enjoying my writing and willing to put up with an irregular upload schedule to read this story helps me chase the Depression beast back. So thank you everyone for your continued support of this story and I truly hope that it's an enjoyable experience.
“Oh of course dear. It’s no trouble. I heard about what happened to Dean Thomas. He was such a sweet boy. I’m so glad he pulled through.” Molly gazed sadly into her cup.
The pair snuggled tight under the blankets, Harry resting in the crook of Draco’s shoulder, and they drifted off to sleep secure in the knowledge that come what may that they would work toward Hermione’s happiness, along with their own, no matter the shape it took.
“It’s Fred. Gred is what George always called his twin brother Fred.” Hermione whispered as she stared morosely into the fire, lost in thought her hands resumed carding through his hair.
Harry reached over and pulled her into his arms, swaying gently in place. “Oh Hermes, you really just noticed that you do that to men and women?
