” he hissed furiously.  “Don’t you dare!  Not in my house!”
“Potter, let me interrupt you there. Do you have any idea how much sway you hold over the wizarding world?”  McGonagall peered at him over her glasses.
The truth dawned on his face slowly, like a sun rising over the horizon and pouring light across the landscape.  Potter looked petrified.  It was spectacular.  “Oh Merlin, I didn’t realize – how can I – is there anything I can — ”
“Nothing, Potter,” Draco replied breezily.  “Just some Shakespeare to lighten the mood.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, smirking bemusedly.  “What do you mean?”
who you are now.”  Harry bit his tongue when Draco’s eyes widened.  “I mean,” he amended hastily, “you’re more yourself now.  War makes people act different than they really are, and now that it’s over, I feel like I’m meeting the real you for the first time.”
“Alright there, Potter?” Draco cut through his reverie with a sharp tone.  “Don’t let me bore you.”
“It’s the right thing to do!” Harry insisted as he flicked his wand to set the dishes scrubbing.  His friends looked unconvinced.  “And what do you mean by healthy, anyway?  What’s wrong with apologizing?  I would think that’s a good thing.”
The auror paused.  “I only meant,” he backtracked, “is that a coincidence?”

The fear that flashed across his uncle’s face was priceless, his eyes twitching and mouth trembling like a buffoon.  Even if it made something in Harry’s gut twist to semi-threaten muggles with magic, he knew it was the only way to keep his uncle from treating him too poorly.
Grinding his teeth, Draco bit out, “What sort of book?”
“Her father worked at the ministry. He was promoted during Pius Thicknesse’s reign. His job was to sniff out muggleborns and halfbloods.”
Harry felt suddenly nervous, like he was a student again getting scolded by his teacher.  “Er, I – I know I’m a bit of a…symbol, but I don’t think – ”
“Merlin,” Draco swore under his breath, then pointed to the left.  “It’s just a few blocks that way, you dolt.”
“Like…a jerk,” Draco explained.  “But, well, he’s kind of a really good person, too?”  Images of Potter in school came to mind, when he’d defended Neville Longbottom and his other friends in first year, when he’d saved that Delacour girl from the lake in fourth year.  Emerging soaking wet from the grimy lake.  Water dripping down his lithe body.
“Why are you smiling, Potter?” Draco grumbled, staring him down.  If Draco was uncomfortable being around this man then damn him if he wasn’t going to try to make Potter uncomfortable too.
“I’m leaving now, Potter, and I don’t want you coming around my work anymore,” Draco heard himself saying, as if from a great distance.  “I’ve moved on, the past is the past, I’m done with it.”  A pause followed, filled with so many possibilities, so many opportunities, so much nothing.  “I’m done with
“What are you on about?” Harry asked him, befuddled at all the glances they were exchanging.
could do that,” he sighed, then let out an airy chuckle.  “Who would’ve thought,” he said wryly to the stone, “I’m jealous of Vincent Crabbe.”
Something about Draco had changed, a release of tension somewhere, a loss of aggression making him look more vulnerable.  Whatever it was, Harry loved it.
No, Draco wasn’t going to waste his time thinking about Potter.  He was going to have a nice, quiet day in the bookstore, organizing the philosophy section and seeking out the next fascinating muggle text to read.  It was a drizzly day out so the bookstore would feel especially cozy.
“Yes, there is something you could do,” Draco interrupted coldly.  “You can leave me alone and never bother me again and live with the knowledge that I will never forgive you.”
“Adventure?” Draco suggested as he halted before the classics section.  “Historical?  Science fiction?  Romance?”
“Lucky,” Draco muttered, turning away to stare at the far wall.  He really hoped his ears weren’t bright red, but after Harry’s sudden arrival Draco couldn’t quite chase the blush off his cheeks.  The loss of composure was unsettling for Draco.
“What?” she’d demanded hotly, looking between the two of them.  Draco gave Harry a little shove forward, as if to say “don’t look at me” and Harry spared him a betrayed glance before meeting Bulstrode’s fiery gaze with a more amiable one.
“I – I
“Alright,” Harry told him, “we can go.”
Potter chuckled at that.  “No, to that last bit,” he said, sounding slightly nervous.
When he reached the door — Vernon had closed it on their visitor, forcing him to wait out in the rain — Harry swung it open, his mouth forming an apology and a greeting at once, but all sound vanished from his throat as he took in the person standing before him.
“Back in a moment,” Draco growled, grabbing the map and pushing Potter in front of him to the door.  Once they were outside again, in the freezing cold, Draco glanced up, expecting to see Potter’s stupid smirk, but instead the other man was frowning at him with — Merlin, was that
“Lair, yes,” Draco snapped irritably.  “Very funny, Potter.”
“Yes you are.”
“Honestly Harry,” Hermione pressed, leaning her elbows on the table.  “We’re worried about you.”
Daphne was gaping at him.  So was Draco.  Did Harry Potter just defend him?
side now?”
“Are you mad?” Draco exploded.  “Potter, I don’t think we’ve ever had a one-on-one conversation — excluding brief exchanges during fights — before you popped up last month.”
“No, I know,” Potter amended hastily.  “I just… don’t get why he can be forgiven but I can’t.”
And yet… he kept agreeing to see Harry.  He came on this last minute date with him — well, not a date, just a… truce.  He could’ve stormed out the minute things got heated.  Why didn’t he?
Harry turned to look at the man beside him, but Draco’s expression was closed off as usual, and he stared straight at Nott, ignoring Harry’s questioning eyes.  Was he trying to make Harry feel guilty for not doing more, for not helping more people?  But there was no way Harry could have defended everyone, no one would listen if he’d shown up at every trial.  He’d had to chose.  And he’d chosen Draco.  Was Draco angry about that?  If he was, Harry was baffled about how to fix it.  Even if he’d known this was how Draco felt, he never would have let him be sent to Azkaban with the other Death Eaters.  Or have his wand confiscated like Nott.  Draco didn’t deserve that fate; he was different.
“I mean,” Hermione said suddenly, and Harry looked up to see her worried expression was back in place, “it really isn’t that funny.  If you say he’s changed, Harry, we believe you.”
Nothing was wrong.  He had no idea what his best friends were talking about.  Everything would go on like normal.
“No,” she declared, but her voice was even and she didn’t seem particularly upset.  “Go on,” she urged when he didn’t immediately continue.
Harry shook his head, as if that would make everything clear.  “Wait,” he said distractedly, “come in.  I have to….”
Harry snapped back into himself, and took a step nearer to the other man.  “Can I…speak with you?” he asked, not entirely sure where he was going with this.
“What?” he shouted back, not interested in getting up just to endure his uncle’s accusations or admonishments or whatever it was that warranted him speaking to Harry at all.
Draco felt somewhat offended for a moment, until Connor waggled his eyebrows comically.  “Of course he is, what do you take me for?” Draco said, acting appalled.  But then he felt like he was coming off wrong.  “But really, that’s not why I… like him.”  It was too weird to say the word ‘love’ out loud.  Even to this guy who Draco would never talk to again.
“Good, you seem to be more emotionally invested than that,” she said, getting to her feet with the silent grace of a cat.
Harry smiled dopily, and Draco sipped at his firewhiskey to test its potency.  The liquid burned all the way down his throat, and the feeling didn’t abate after he’d swallowed.  Already, he felt rather lightheaded.  Perhaps Potter really was half-drunk from just a glass.
“Fine,” Draco growled, and Harry let him shove him toward the empty fireplace.  “Potter, you first.”
The woman smiled back.  “Precisely.”  She then stood, taking out a keychain, and Draco felt rather cold with the thought of having to leave the quaint bookstore.
“What I
Harry’s brows raised. He thought he’d known everyone in his year. “She was?”
It had been stupid really, leading Potter along a path in the opposite direction from his flat.  It wasn’t as if Potter was going to stalk him or something equally as ridiculous.  In fact, there was no reason at all to be thinking about Potter now.  Or wondering if he should walk along that path to make sure Potter wasn’t about to show up there and get lost again….
, and how would Malfoy’s hair look then, as wildly unkempt as Harry’s and incredibly sexy —
What a fool he’d made of himself.  He desperately hoped Potter would call it quits so he would never have to face him again.  And yet, the thought made him oddly cold.
Draco gave him a sidelong glance, but otherwise didn’t react.  Harry began worrying his lip.  It somehow felt like he had limited time to get Draco to say something, or to smile, or laugh, or bloody well react to something.  There were more Slytherins, this wasn’t the last time he’d see Draco.  So why did it feel like an end?
?” Greg demanded bluntly without preamble, and Draco had to hide his smirk.
After a moment, she sighed and nodded, patting his hand before they both leaned back in their seats to continue their dinner.
.  Draco cleared his throat awkwardly, standing up straight.  “Fictional character,” he fibbed hastily.  “Shall we?” he asked, already walking away to the front.
Draco was too startled to stop him.  Daphne put her hand to her chest, like she was terribly offended, even though Harry hadn’t even insulted her.
Hermione rolled her eyes.  “We’re your best friends, Harry.  You can tell us anything.”
“Same,” said the rudest wizard who ever lived, dropping her hand.
Draco nudged him, and Harry looked up to see that Draco was making an impatient gesture towards the other side of the shop.  Sure enough, Theodore Nott was there, sweeping up loose hairs into small piles.  The more he swept, the more dirt and hair he seemed to find.  Not to mention that Mr. Batworthy’s current client was shedding copiously — and yet still so ensconced in the wiry hair that Harry would be shocked if it was human.  Even as Mr. Batworthy cut off locks of the stuff, it seemed to grow back instantly to the same length.  The two seemed unperturbed by this detail, as Batworthy continued trimming and the creature continued burbling away in his melodic tongue.  Harry briefly wondered if Batworthy could understand the odd language — it was definitely not a human one — but then Draco nudged him again, and Harry refocused on the task at hand.
Connor turned his gaze to the cover, before looking appraisingly at Draco again.  “Is this your favorite?”
“Yes,” Harry assured, grasping onto that thread of hope.  “Now tell me,” he added with a hint of playfulness.  “Who
“I’m afraid,” she said kindly, patting his hand, “I can’t afford to take anyone on, dear.”
“It’s not a crime to be afraid.”
The hope that broke over Harry’s face was worth any amount of groveling, money, humiliation, in the world.  It was like watching a sunrise over a wide, gentle ocean.  “Alright?” he repeated, and his voice was worse, like a man who’d lost his will to live being offered a second chance.
,” Malfoy emphasized, teeth grinding, “it’s cute that you barge into people’s lives expecting them to fawn all over you for existing, but I am not one of your fanatical groupies.”
Footsteps picked up behind him, and before he knew it, a breathless Harry was blocking his path.  “Malfoy,” he gasped, “Draco.  I’m
Harry bit his lip.  He hated making Draco upset.  He just wanted to have a nice conversation with him.  And then maybe kiss him.  “You’re probably right,” he sighed, not sure if he completely agreed, but needing to show Draco he was on his side.  “They’re always trying to get me to give a speech too, and I’ve never wanted to.  It always felt like it was for the wrong reasons.  Maybe this year I’ll ask someone else to fill in for me.”
Malfoy waited, not moving; Harry couldn’t even see if he was breathing.
“He’s
“But at least they
“Hey, Malfoy,” Potter said merrily.
“Holding grudges is for children, Mr. Potter,” Ros stated firmly.  “I hope you’ll learn that one day.”
me?” Harry growled, glaring at the blonde witch.
Draco tried to scowl back, but it came out as a smile.  This was turning out to be a pretty amusing use of his time.  “Then where to next?”
Harry raised his eyebrows.  “It’s not anti-Slytherin.  It’s about house unity.”
“In what ways?” she queried, her blank mask restored.
“We better,” Lavender warned, and she leaned over to nip at Pansy’s ear.
Draco just glared at him.  “The countryside is hardly ever monitored.”
Harry crossed his arms.  “I wasn’t the nicest to him in school.”
“Alright,” Harry relented, holding up his arms in surrender, then added, “I’ll take that as a yes.”
Connor grinned, and — Merlin’s
Shaking his head to clear it of those unhelpful thoughts, Draco pulled Harry into his usual side alley, and disapparated them without giving Potter a word of warning.  It was only fair that Potter felt as unbalanced as Draco did, after all.
There was no denying it – Harry was completely besotted.  He’d spent the morning humming to himself and imagining Draco’s smirk, and his grey-blue eyes twinkling with mischief, and how his perfectly coiffed platinum hair would shift like waves when he turned his head….  Needless to say, Harry got little actual work done.
“I’m not scared.”
,” Draco said incredulously.  “He’s
“Is that all you’ve come to say?” Draco spat.  For a moment, he thought a fog had descended, but when he blinked he realized it was just the moisture in his eyes.  He scowled, hating the tears that threatened to fall.  “That everything that happened to me was my own fault?”
Harry —
, stupidly in love, because there was no grey area when it came to Harry Potter.  There were only good guys or bad guys, heroes or villains.  Love or hate.  Or both at the same time.  But Draco could never merely
a magical supremacist.  He was one of the main believers apart from the Dark Lord himself.”
Dr. Finch smiled warmly at him.  “Get home safe.”
“Nothing!” Harry cried, flabbergasted by the whole ordeal.  “Why does everyone assume I did something wrong?”
Draco’s throat had dried up once more, words caught somewhere behind his tongue.  The man before him looked half-crazed, panting with emotion, and just watching him made Draco’s breathing speed up too.
Draco gave him a disbelieving look.  “It’s the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts.  It celebrates the bravery of Gryffindors, Ravenclaws, and Hufflepuffs, and how the big bad Slytherins were locked in the dungeons for all of it.”  Draco’s tone was scathing.
thinking about Malfoy and what if they
“Stupid Potter,” Stupid Potter said ruefully.  “That’s the saying, right?”
Hermione snorted.
Harry frowned at him.  “What’s wrong with Nott?”
Draco groaned inwardly.  He had even
“Hey,” Draco continued as Greg let him go.  “I have bad news.”
“I’ll keep you safe,” he promised in a whisper as he leaned into the broom to urge it faster.  “I won’t let them take you.”
“Sod off, Flints,” Draco’s voice snarled from beside him, and for the second time that day, Harry felt Draco tug on his arm, silently prompting him to go.  This time he obeyed, and Draco disapparated them back to England, into the alley by The Dragon’s Lair.  Harry didn’t even bother to berate him about his lawbreaking this time.  It wouldn’t help.
Snape raised an eyebrow. It was so similar to Draco’s icy controlled looks that Harry felt disoriented for a moment. “Well, you could always ask me,” the former professor proffered with an air of boredom that Harry was fairly sure was feigned.
Rosmerta finally turned her assessing gaze on Harry, making him squirm as he stood there sheepishly.  “It’s good to see you again, Madam Rosmerta,” he muttered, barely meeting her eyes.
Draco looked at him curiously.  “You will?” he asked; his voice sounded strangely hopeful.
Harry blinked.  “Who else?” he said, gaping.  “
But Draco didn’t chose to live with muggles simply because he wanted to.  He had worked for that genocidal maniac, and every witch and wizard knew it.  In the muggle world, he was just another person on the street.  Not that he had broken off all ties with the wizarding world.  He still stayed in touch with his mother, and Pansy, and Greg, and Blaise.  And of course sometimes a bespectacled war hero would pop in on him uninvited.
Dr. Finch let out a snort.  “Only for a little while,” she told him, eyes twinkling.  “I fell in love after that, never felt the same about a girl again.”
Snape rolled his eyes, somehow still effortlessly elegant. “Obviously.”
“One minute!” he hissed, cutting off Malfoy’s protest and leaving him by the door as he barged into the kitchen.
“Oh, come on, Draco,” Parkinson drawled.  “There’s plenty of room.”  She seemed to be gesturing towards the seat Harry was currently on, a chair with decidedly no room for more than one person, unless Draco were to sit on Harry’s lap.  The thought was hurriedly dismissed, but not before Harry considered what Draco’s face might look like if he unexpectedly yanked him down onto his lap right then.  And how it would feel to support Draco’s lean frame, Harry’s arms wrapped securely around Draco’s narrow hips.
“So,” Connor said, “that’s why you won’t date him?”
name, and his friends’.  It wasn’t about right or wrong, it was about who won.  And that didn’t say anything about the individuals.  Harry only ever knew one side of them, the side that was ruthless and hellbent on killing him.  But he knew they couldn’t have all been purely evil.  They stuck together, were loyal to their families and friends.  They loved, and were loved.  Didn’t that mean something?
“Mr. Potter, you can’t seriously be as thick as you look,” Snape retorted sharply. “You and Mr. Malfoy have been obsessed with each other for years – I daresay since the first moment you met. Please tell me Ms. Granger at least noticed.”
No.  No, he didn’t.  Everything would be better if Potter never showed his face here again.
Harry frowned as Draco picked up his pace.  “No,” he said.
McGonagall noticed his eyes sliding toward Dumbledore’s empty portrait. “He should be back soon. Feel free to stay and chat while I deal with this.” And with that she was gone, the spiral doorway grinding shut behind her.
Draco whipped his head around to see a grumpy-looking barn owl pecking furiously at the window.  Attached to its leg was a tiny scroll.
“No – I mean, yes – I mean,” Harry stuttered hopelessly, “Not like you do.”
“Potter,” she replied smoothly, eyes cutting.  Was she annoyed?  Pissed off?  Pleased?  Smug?  Her face gave nothing away.  She didn’t speak or do anything further though, and it seemed as if she was waiting for him to spit out his reason for being here.
,” he spat.  But he couldn’t manage his usual disgust when Malfoy was looking at him with those wide, fearful eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry’s behaviour.  “Daphne, it’s a pleasure as always,” Draco said, forcing Daphne to return her gaze to him.  It was uncomfortable to have her look at him like that, with those hungry eyes, but it was better him than Potter.  “I must apologize for my companion, he’s quite dense when it comes to the obvious.”
“I’d never,” Draco promised solemnly, then nodded to Potter who was standing awkwardly at his side.  “But
Before Draco could continue towards the door or think of anything else to say, Harry whirled around to face her, his sleeve falling from Draco’s grasp.  “
The portrait had stared back at them in silence, eyes searching.  None of the paintings in the Zabini household spoke.  Draco wondered if Ms. Zabini had spelled them that way so they couldn’t accuse her of foul play or if something about this place made them want to keep their voices down.  Draco could understand that compulsion; the Mansion echoed in a way that shamed you into staying quiet.  It felt like a place of worship, though it was far from it.
Rolling his eyes, Draco tried not to think about the look Potter would give him if he did ask.  Probably utter bewilderment — though that was his usual expression.  Or maybe one of his beaming smiles.  The thought made Draco feel oddly warm.  “That would only encourage him,” Draco denied.
“I’ll stop smiling if you let me apologize,” Potter countered smugly, and Draco gritted his teeth.
?” Draco demanded with a suspicious frown.  Surely Potter could use his auror status to find out where Greg lived.  In fact, he could probably find out where Draco lived as well.  The thought made Draco nervous.  There were plenty of people who still wanted Draco dead for his part in the war, and if Potter could find him out then it wouldn’t be hard for others to do the same.
Pansy rolled her eyes as she pulled Lavender back down to her side.  “You’re such a princess.”  Pansy pressed her lips to Lavender’s cheek, where the worst of her scarring was.  “We’ll get it later.”
Harry smiled to himself as he heard Dudley groan.  Aunt Petunia had her moments.
“Bloody hell, Malfoy,” Potter gasped as they appeared on a crowded street in Hogsmeade, and Draco was stupidly pleased that he’d startled Potter into both swearing and using his last name again.  (He briefly wondered what other ways he could startle Potter but cut short that train of thought as it inevitably lead to snogging and more enthusiastic activities.)
Malfoy cocked his head to the side curiously before giving a brief nod and striding off down the street.  Harry took that as a cue to follow him, and he jogged to catch up.  Soon they were walking side by side down Norwood Road in silence.  Eventually, Malfoy turned off down another street.  Harry began to wonder if Malfoy was taking him back to his flat, or mansion — wherever he lived.
, Potter,” Draco sighed again, and before they could even knock, the door swung inward as if they were expected.
Harry grimaced at his friend.  “Yes, Malfoy was a git, but I was too, okay?”
*    	*    	*
It took several moments for Draco’s mouth to remember how to form words, but he was finally able to say, “Alright.”
But even on those miserable days, Malfoy’s hair never seemed to be affected by wind — the most it ever did was appear stylishly mussed.  His white-blonde hair was like a beacon on dreary days, like a lighthouse leading lost ships to safety.  And on sunny days it rivaled the sun itself, a glow forming around his head like a halo.  But Malfoy’s face, contrary to his perpetual glow, was almost always drawn, and tired, and sad.  And maybe that was why Harry kept going back, thinking of ways to apologize, because he couldn’t stand to see that look on Malfoy’s face.
,” Harry said, trying to lighten the mood, but that just caused all three of the others to give him disappointed looks.
Draco tried not to feel too pleased at Harry’s reaction, but there it was in his chest, like a smug cat, only rivaled by the horror that Harry might think Draco agreed with her twisted views.
“Is that all?” Draco asked coolly.
“It’d pass the time,” Snape sighed out, almost nonchalant. If Harry wasn’t mistaken, the Slytherin was actually interested.
.  And then he’d said Harry’s name, his
“How?” Draco interrupted his babbling; his voice came out pricklier than he expected.  “How is it different?”
Draco snorted in spite of himself.  What a dunce Harry was.  A gorgeous, funny —
of the Slytherins, Harry?”
Ron at least had the decency to look sheepish, but Hermione just raised her eyebrows unapologetically.  “It’s…not like that,” Harry protested at last.
Draco stared at him in disbelief.  “Potter, are you absolutely mad?  You apparated here.”
“Tatiana,” Dr. Finch sighed, looking into the distance.  “She was the most incredible woman I’d ever met.”
Giving Dr. Finch a withering look, Draco turned and stomped over to the second row of shelves, Potter following along behind him.  “This is the section on health.  I trust you can browse on your own.”  Draco made to leave, but Potter blocked his path.
Neither of them tried to stop him as he went out the front door.
“Potter,” Draco breathed in shock, because what else could he say?
girlfriends?”
Blaise, chivalrous as he was, didn’t argue with Harry’s assessment.  “It’s very kind of you to go out of your way to tell me all that,” he commended.  “I appreciate your time.”  Blaise always was the most diplomatic of Draco’s friends.
“I’m helping with the Hogwarts Unity event this year,” he said, trying to mask his besotted tone.  “I think you’d be a great speaker there.”
, really.  Kindly take yourself and your hero complex out of my life.”
“Er,” Harry said, confused at the change in topic. “No?”
Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair.  This conversation was giving him a headache.  “I’m pretty sure I’d only stress him out more.  He’s not exactly fond of me.”
And then Harry Potter had come back and saved him.  He could still feel Harry’s back against his own heaving chest, Draco’s thighs pressed tight to Harry’s own, the warm skin of Harry’s neck as Draco hid his face in it, thinking any second would be their last.
“I hope so,” Harry said, and with that he pushed past his uncle and slid his wand back into his pocket.  Behind him, he could hear the huffing of his uncle as he returned to the living room.  He couldn’t be bothered by his extended family however, not when Ron was at the door waiting to take him back to the wizarding world, hopefully for good.
“Maybe,” Hermione began in a tone that suggested she was about to provide an obvious and fool-proof solution to all their problems, “you should owl him, Harry, and ask him if he wants to meet you?”
“What is it this time, Potter?” Draco said coolly, noting how Harry startled out of his trance.  “Is there something on my face?”
“So what
“Alright,” Hermione agreed hastily, giving him a nervous smile in return.
“Where to?” Potter prompted as Draco simply frowned in Potter’s direction.
Harry blushed bright red. “N-no, it’s not that, professor – and…I will – but, it’s this House Unity event. I want to make sure the Slytherins aren’t represented poorly. But I don’t know…I’m not great at speeches.”
for?” Ron asked in bewilderment, like he couldn’t imagine doing anything to Malfoy except punching him in the face.
Harry felt an uncomfortable weight settle in his chest.  “That’s awful,” he breathed, thinking of the only other person he knew to receive that punishment.  And Hagrid hadn’t even deserved it.
No.  No more thinking about Potter.  It was a waste of Draco’s time.
“Why do you need
Ron flinched infinitesimally.  “Well, only the one time,” he said.
“Well,” Potter said, ducking his head a bit and running a hand through his incurably disheveled hair, “I was hoping you could introduce me to Goyle — Gregory Goyle, that is.”
“Shut up, Potter,” the other man growled, taking a menacing step towards him.  “You show up at my work — in a muggle area, which you know means I’m trying to
Draco frowned at him, in a very mature, not-petulant way.  “Why are you still pestering
“Gregory,” Potter said, ignoring Draco, “I want to apologize to you.”
They were both staring at him determinedly and Harry frowned.  “You two aren’t going to let this go, are you?”
Harry worked his jaw.  “How long will it take him to find you?” he demanded, refusing to move toward the door.
“Isn’t it?” Hermione challenged.  “Harry, you were fixated on him all through school.  Half the time you were off stalking him!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ros began wiping at the counter with a rag that looked like it was dirtier than what it was supposed to be cleaning.  “That’s because you don’t usually look quite so murderous.”
Malfoy rounded a corner, and Harry was left standing alone in the middle of the street.
“Of course it wasn’t, Harry,” Hermione assured him quickly.  “What happened?”
Ron grunted, acknowledging her point.
,” she gasped between giggles.
Feeling mischievous, Harry went on with an innocent expression, “Pansy Parkinson?  Don’t you know her?”
“She was brilliant,” Dr. Finch went on, ignoring Draco’s comment.  “And gorgeous, of course.  She had this insanely curly black hair that she wore in dreadlocks, and black-framed glasses.  Her eyes were the color of coffee — not quite black, but almost there.”  Dr. Finch sighed dreamily, and it was a side of her that Draco had never seen before.  “She had a PhD in astrophysics.  She had to work so much harder than any white man to get it, too.  Moved to the U.S. to work for NASA.”
Draco blushed, and desperately tried to hide that fact by drinking more tea, forgetting how much he disliked the taste.  “I don’t know what you mean,” Draco replied curtly as he set his cup down.
“You’re taking him home with you?” Lavender giggled, her and Parkinson smirking at each other.  Harry made a valiant effort to remain unfazed.
The bell on the door of The Dragon’s Lair rang to announce a customer, and Draco immediately stiffened.  Was it Harry?  So soon?  Didn’t he have a
Draco flipped the card over.  It was presumably Connor’s number, and Draco blushed thinking how a few years ago he wouldn’t have known how to operate a telephone.  “I’ll check my schedule,” Draco replied, giving Connor a wink of his own.
“Up yours,” was all Nott said in reply.  The words were laced with venom, and Nott’s movements were stiff, but he didn’t seem to be overly aggressive.  Harry’s mischievous side was starting to show.
“I’m going to drop you off first so you don’t keep pestering me at the bookstore,” Draco informed him curtly, apparently explaining the arm situation.  “Where do you want to go?”
“Then I don’t see why I should,” Draco declared.
There was that phrase again, Potter’s new motto:
Harry stopped with the aimless twirling and gripped the handle, pointing it in his uncle’s ugly mug.  “I think I’ll say what I want.  Wouldn’t you agree?”
Draco bit his lip. “I’m not good enough for him,” he whispered, feeling shame creep through him at the admission. “I did bad things.”
Hermione raised her eyebrows at him.  “Harry, is this about Malfoy?”
Draco nodded, both exasperated and in awe of his friend’s suave evasiveness, and stood to give Blaise a quick embrace.
Norwood Road was home to a number of quaint shops and restaurants, and Harry idly wondered which ones, if any, Malfoy visited.  If he squinted into all the windows, would he see that white-blonde hair peeking over a shelf or from behind a menu?
don’t take that class by the way; other students do.”
“Doing?” Harry parroted, forcing his eyes back up to Draco’s face.
“Excuse me for a moment,” Draco muttered, slipping off the barstool.  Connor raised his eyebrows, but didn’t protest as his hand slid off Draco’s leg.  Draco tried not to seem too eager to get away.  The owl watched Draco shrewdly as he made his way toward the door, all while those muggle girls were snapping pictures of it with their phones.  This would be so much simpler if he had his wand with him; as it was, he’d left the thing in his bedside drawer, like he did most days when he was spending time with muggles.
on him.  The scars crisscrossing his torso tingled uncomfortably where his shirt brushed against them.  Potter just had to bring that up, didn’t he?  He had to bring it up, because he only ever thought about himself and never once about how Draco felt.  It meant nothing to Potter, but everything to Draco.  And the bastard thought he had the right to make Draco relive those memories?  A shudder rippled through him as he remembered Snape’s face hovering over him, the usually blank features twisted with concern, muttering a song-like counter-spell as Draco’s blood fought to leave his body.  And the
“I could do with a romance,” Connor said quietly, then stepped back to give Draco space.  “What’s your pick?”
Draco gave her a dark look.  “You underestimate his stupidity.”
“Thank you,” Draco said politely.  He glanced around the tiny shop, and chose an aisle at random, walking down it in wonder.  There were so many books, old books, just sitting there around him — so many words, so much knowledge — and the realization of that filled him with awe.  He could learn so much, about muggle culture, muggle religion, muggle everything, and it could push out all the unwanted thoughts, the dark memories that he tried so hard to suppress.  Draco walked back to the woman’s desk, knowing he would have to leave soon anyway.  She was still there, inspecting a giant encyclopedia from the 1800s.  It was in French.
does!  Sometimes I wonder how he’s even a wizard — he looks at maps instead of casting directional spells, and makes promises the muggle way that aren’t magically binding so he can go and break them without a second thought!  He makes you think you mean something to him for some reason, but then once you let your guard down for a
“Great, let’s go,” Connor said, turning toward the door.
thing,” she commented unapologetically.
to apologize again, so I was –
Harry leant forward, resting his arms on the table between them, not breaking his staring match with the blonde.  “What
Draco suddenly thought of Severus Snape, and his patronus, how it changed to a doe to reflect the woman he loved, how he made a mistake — many mistakes — and it led to that woman’s death, and how he spent the rest of his life trying to make things right because of her.  How Potter was now on a mission to make things right.  If only Draco would let him.
Hermione returned it with a startled but pleased smile.
Parkinson’s eyebrows shot up as she eyed Harry.  “He’s
, Draco thought.
Harry wished he could keep his face as expressionless as she could, but as it was, Harry was sure he was practically gaping.  She’d said aloud — well, she’d implied — that Draco was gay, right?  He hadn’t misheard that?
…unlike Draco’s platinum blonde, that caught in the light like reflections in the water. Or like the shimmer of a snitch, but more silver. Harry briefly thought of Fleur’s flowing hair and charm and wandered if Draco had some Veela in him.
Draco wasn’t here to see this.  He would never know Harry had come to this grave.
“Why would you
Rosmerta’s laugh was breathier this time, like she was caught between mirth and horror, and Draco supposed it was still too soon to joke about the darkest wizard to ever live.  The door to the pub swung open, letting in a burst of cool air, and Draco figured Ros would be leaving to serve whoever it was, but to his surprise, she continued their conversation unhurriedly.  “Merlin, Draco, tell me what you really think,” she said, sounding pleased, and Draco decided that yes, he
“I knew it!” Ron crowed, earning some stares from the other customers.  “That slimy git, what did he say — ow!”  He abruptly turned to Hermione to give her a sour look and it was clear that Hermione had kicked him under the table.
Harry opened his mouth, intending to introduce the two parties, but Parkinson was already berating him.
Ron grabbed his plate, shoving past Harry on his way to the sink.  Once the plate was added to the set of self-washing dishes, he turned back to face Harry, slightly more composed.  “You’re better than him, Harry,” he said, sounding disappointed.  “You don’t have to apologize to him for anything.”
Potter continued to look perplexed, but smiled like he understood.
“But,” Potter was saying in a whisper, “he…
Harry, who had been gaping at the vaulted glass ceiling where the sun was glancing off every surface and creating rainbows and shimmering images of animals that danced around in the light, now looked back at Daphne Greengrass in awe.  “I’m sorry, Daphne,” he began, with a guilty expression, “I have to admit I don’t really remember you from school.”
with the owner’s ridiculously over-recycled name printed on top.  “Is it the owner you’re worried about?  Podric Batworthy XXIII?”  He idly wondered how twenty-three generations hadn’t been able to come up with a more original name, or if they somehow thought adding numbers amounted to prestige.
“Get down here!” Uncle Vernon insisted, voice as bristly as his triple-chin.
graves.
“He’s calling me,” Draco groaned.  “It – ahh – it burns!”
Connor grinned, letting one of his hands drop onto Draco’s knee, but before either of them could say or do anything more, one of the girls a few tables over gave a little shriek of excitement, and said, “Look!  There’s an owl at the window!”
uncouth in your opinion.”
Draco frowned at him, trying to regain his composure.  The stinging memory of pain was still present in the forefront of Draco’s mind, but it was fading.  “You don’t,” Draco repeated.
There was literally no response Harry could think to give to that, so he settled with a desperate, “Did you just threaten me?”
Draco frowned, because of
The other man looked impatient with Harry’s slow response.  “First Greg, now Pansy?” he clarified grumpily.  “What’s going on here?”
Malfoy’s hand shot out and grabbed Harry’s arm.  “There’s no time, Harry!”
Potter glanced his way with a frown.  “You shouldn’t underestimate Hufflepuffs,” he started defensively.
“What sort of funny business?” Harry asked innocently, plucking his wand from his back pocket and twirling it between his fingers.  “Magic?”
“Which is why, Potter,” Parkinson went on, looking thoroughly unimpressed with his lack of a poker face, “I have to ask: what are your intentions with my dear Draco?”
“Potter,” she snarled, leaning on the table with both hands and crowding into Hermione, who leaned as far as she could into Ron’s side.
“Actually no, we’re done discussing that prat,” Draco said sulkily, as Lavender carded her fingers through Pansy’s long black hair.  Potter’s hair was just as dark but far more messy.  Draco wondered how it might feel to card his fingers through it.  “He’s just a momentary nuisance, and I’m wasting no more time on him.”
Harry, never simply fancy him.  Of course he had to be horribly in love with him.  It was dreadful.
And that was how Harry got doused with alcohol for a second time that day, and Draco got banned from the Greengrass Estate forever.
warned him.  “All the same,” Harry forged on, turning back to Nott, “I am sorry for how us Gryffindors treated you lot in school.”  These apologies were getting quite succinct, but since Harry had hardly interacted with many of the Slytherins outside Draco’s immediate friend group, it was difficult to be specific.
Draco scoffed, not letting himself think too hard about Potter liking him back.  “That’s not a real term.”
“It was racial.  The police said it was suicide.  They did nothing.”
“What did you do?” she demanded.  “After I clearly threatened you!”
To his surprise, Connor barked out a laugh — and Merlin, if that wasn’t the most beautiful sound in the world.  “You really
“I’m sorry,” Draco sputtered in surprise, glancing at Dr. Finch who was pretending not to listen, “right now?”
For a moment, nothing came to mind — except for a harrowing image of Potter and Greg snogging passionately, which was hurriedly dismissed — and then Draco remembered Potter’s whole
Malfoy swallowed.  “Harry, please,” he said, dropping all pretenses.  He was terrified.  “You need to go.”  His right hand came up and pushed at Harry gently.  “Please.”
Connor raised his eyebrows at him.  “Yeah,” he said, as if it were obvious.
All three of them jumped, Ron letting out a startled “Merlin!” before turning to gape at Parkinson.  The woman in question was glaring right at Harry.
Malfoy pursed his lips, but merely said, “You can take mine then.”  He nodded to the side, and Harry noticed a Nimbus 2000 leaning against the wall for the first time.  “Now go!”
“I think he was my father,” Blaise had said once when they were younger, eleven or twelve, one summer, as he stood in front of the portrait of Ms. Zabini’s third husband.  He had the same sharp features as Blaise, but his eyes were blue and pouchy, making him look weak and helpless.  Blaise was fiercer than anyone else Draco knew, even at that age.
Malfoy snorted, still managing to appear suave.  “For what, stealing my £5?”
And he could —
not apologizing,” Greg said defensively, and Draco snorted before Potter could respond.
Didn’t that mean anything?
Malfoy stared at him, unreadable.  It was making Harry nervous.
“Honestly, Draco, I don’t think I ever met the Greengrasses,” Harry hedged as they appeared in front of the Greengrass gate.  Little metal songbirds were flitting about the bars, chirping in their tinny voices.  The Greengrasses were all quite adept in charms and their estate was the most flamboyant of all the old families — and definitely the most pleasant.  It almost made up for the Greengrasses themselves.
and it’s rubbish!”
“Pansy, let me in,” Draco’s voice filtered in through the door, but he didn’t sound too hopeful, and Parkinson ignored him, turning instead to usher Harry further into the flat.  Being alone with Parkinson was suddenly making Harry much more anxious than when he knew Draco was there next to him.
Harry blushed slightly under her dazzling smile.  Draco knew how intoxicating the Greengrasses could be; he couldn’t blame Harry for acting so starstruck.  Besides, Draco had picked this place to lift Harry’s spirits.  If Draco were to interrupt now it would accomplish the opposite of that.
Parkinson blinked at him like he was an idiot, which was entirely unfair considering the stressful interrogation she had just put him through.  “Of course, darling,” she said, and she began to walk away, but then turned to face him when she reached the doorway.  “I’m sorry too, for trying to give you up to the Dark Lord,” she added, sounding positively disinterested with the whole conversation.
“Connor,” he stuttered, a blush rising in his cheeks, “I apologize.  I’ve been busy.”
company.”
Swallowing, Draco struggled to find his voice.  “But not Blaise’s?” he asked.  He sounded rough and scratchy, and he willed his voice to be stronger.  “He doesn’t matter?”  That was better, more authority.
Connor’s worry morphed into a wry grin, though his eyes held some regret.  Draco didn’t have the energy to feel sorry for leading him on.  “The one you’re in love with?” he asked amiably.
“Yes, Potter,” the boy said, exasperation seeping into his panicked voice, “it’s me, Draco Malfoy — now, really, we must go.”
Potter raised his eyebrows stupidly.  “Really?”
“Draco,” Daphne greeted, standing in the doorway with a full champagne glass and her usual smile.  On anyone else it would look kind and friendly, but Draco knew Daphne too well.  Her long blonde hair fluttered prettily in the breeze.  “And Harry,” she added graciously, unfazed by Draco’s unusual choice of companion.  “Please, come in.”
“Zabini Mansion, that’s the Floo name,” Parkinson dismissed them.  “He won’t mind.”
“Er, are you sure?” Harry asked dubiously. Snape wasn’t exactly one to listen to student problems before, though Harry supposed he must’ve had plenty of practice with Draco.
Draco would never understand this madman.
Parkinson’s eyes were becoming less and less friendly with each passing second, and Harry got to his feet, feeling increasingly out of place.  “You’re sure?” he asked, taking a step toward the fireplace.
Not the least of which with Draco himself, who seemed to be getting colder by the minute, his frown cutting into that seraphic face of his.  Harry desperately wanted to smooth it out with his fingers.  He didn’t dare.
“I’ll see you two later,” Harry said, giving Ron a clap on the back.  “I have an idea.”
“All of these books here,” she went on, “contain so much knowledge that most people are unaware of.  To so many people, these books are uncharted territory.  So until you open a book and read it, it could be anything.”
Connor glanced pointedly around the empty bookstore, but made no comment.
“Yes,” Draco answered, though it pained him to say such easily deduced facts aloud.  “Greg lives and works in the Three Broomsticks.”
Draco whimpered in response, hugging Harry tighter with his right arm and nestling his face into the crook of Harry’s neck.  It made Harry so scared.  He would give anything for a biting remark or recycled insult.  Anything to prove Draco was alright, that he was back to his old self.  Suddenly, Draco’s right arm loosened, his body going slack, and Harry could feel him sliding sideways off the broom.  Before he could fall completely, Harry twisted around and clutched the front of Draco’s robes in his fist, yanking him around to the front of Harry’s body.  Wrapping an arm around Draco’s limp form, he steadied the broom with the other.
Harry took a step back, seemingly speechless at this turn of events, and he finally glanced over at Draco.  Taking that as his cue, and eager to prove his distaste for Daphne’s philosophy, Draco stepped forward into the line of fire.  Daphne’s eyes settled on his.  “Daphne,” he said haltingly, trying to ignore Harry’s inscrutable gaze, “I’ve just remembered, I have an appointment.  I’m afraid we can’t stay.”
Harry blanched. “What?! What do you mean, you
,” Draco snapped huffily, and made his way to the front door.
After a moment of scrutinizing him, Petunia gave a curt nod.  Grabbing her purse on her way into the living room, she called out, “Vernon, I’m going to the sports store.  There’s a limited-time sale on those golf clubs you were interested in.  You’ll need to show me which ones you want.”
“What are you talking about, Malfoy?” he asked warily, not moving from his spot in the doorway.  Malfoy had minimal cover from the rain under the awning, but Harry wasn’t about to invite him inside.  Petunia would start shrieking about the water warping her hardwood floors, for one thing, and Harry really didn’t need to involve the Dursleys right now.
Draco lifted his hand and let his fingers slowly drift through the light. He let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. Warmth rushed into him, his muscles unclenching one by one.
“What if I –”
Where would he even
Harry reached out and snagged a lock of Draco’s hair. “Thinking about me, then?” he asked smugly, twirling the fine blond strands around his finger.
Draco blinked, seemingly taken aback by Harry’s enthusiastic chatter.
Harry rolled his eyes and nudged Draco with his shoulder. “How did you guess, then?”
Flustered, Draco threw up his hands and glowered at Maeve.
Draco gave him a puzzled look. “And they didn’t interfere with your spells?”
It should have come as a shock, the things he had just learned. Except Harry wasn’t actually surprised.
“And you’re sure you did the spell right?” Harry prodded. Maybe the implied insult would get Malfoy to at least look at him.
“Heart-breaking, truly,” Blaise said.
“No.” Draco’s voice was hard as he cut Hermione off. It felt like a window had come crashing down, shutting out the smell of flowers and sunshine, leaving the air tepid and stale.
I love you.”
“Did you sleep at all last night?” Harry asked softly.
There was a buzzing in his ears and his vision threatened to white out.
Harry wrinkled his brow. “And that’s…
“You were so relieved –” Harry trailed off, worried he was about to force Draco to relive something painful.
“Yes?”
“Well, the dessert could use some adjustments,” Draco said, frowning slightly, “but I’m glad you enjoyed it.”
“Malfoy!” Potter cried, leaping up after him. “I’m so sorry – I –”
“I know,” Harry said, holding her gaze. “It’s alright.”
, not even glancing down at the words. He would never admit it, but the book was nothing more than a convenient prop. What Harry was actually doing was staring across the room at Draco Malfoy, and he didn’t want his friends to notice.
Draco fumbled blindly at his own trousers, finally popping the button and slipping a hand inside his pants.
Draco nodded. “About the Dar –
Draco closed his eyes and ran his fingers over his wand. The grain of the wood was tantalizing, the sensation both novel and heartbreakingly familiar. He breathed deep, imagining something at the center of him loosening.
“George will set it right,” Draco parroted condescendingly.
“Maeve,” Draco said finally, looking up from where he had been admiring the work tables. One hand still rested on the marbled surface. “What… what is this?”
Draco followed, propping himself beside Harry. His eyes were hooded, expression grave, and Harry felt a flicker of apprehension.
It was very similar, now that Harry thought about it, to the way Draco had reacted when Harry told him about the research institute. With a quiet yearning, like these were things he wanted desperately, even if he wasn’t quite ready to jump.
“Choose again,” Harry repeated, a bit awe-struck by how simple Draco made it sound. “Choose again.” The words were sweet on his tongue. Unconsciously, he pressed his shoulder into Draco’s.
Harry’s eyes flew open.
“No, Draco, listen –” he tugged on Draco’s arm until he huffed slightly and swung his feet up onto the bed. He shuffled closer and sat cross-legged, fully facing Harry.
She used to think it would break
Harry’s head snapped up. “That’s what the fight was about. George was angry you stole an unfinished product, that you used it on us.”
Finding Lavender such an enthusiastic dueling partner had surprised Harry at first, but the shock had quickly faded. She had fought in the war too, after all, and she seemed to need the dueling club for the same reasons Harry did. Dueling was an outlet; it swallowed the aggressions and quicksilver reflexes the war had bred in them, the thirst for action that had not been quenched with Voldemort’s defeat. For an hour every morning they could lash out, fight and strike and stumble and curse, all without the world being at stake.
Harry made a mild sound of protest at the word
Harry let go of his mug, which continued to hover in the air above the hammock, and ran a fingertip over the label. In Draco’s neatest script, it read
The fire crackled, its shadows dancing across Harry’s cheekbones. Draco wanted to touch him, longed to trace that dazzling smile with the tip of his finger, capturing the feel of it to keep safe inside his own beating heart.
The anniversary of his parents’ deaths had felt different somehow, this first year after the war. The grief was inexplicably sharper, as if the struggle against Voldemort had been insulating Harry against the true extent of the loss. Without the looming threat of battle, without a villain to defy, Harry suddenly didn’t know where to channel his pain.
Malfoy bit his lip and looked away. His fingers tightened on his elbows. “And it took you five days to come to this conclusion?” His voice cracked on the number.
No, a foot soldier of the Dark Lord had no place in the Savior’s bedroom.
“For giving those kids a chance.” The words came out thick, emotion welling up again in Harry’s throat. “It’s more than I ever had.”
“I’m happy to,” Hermione said breezily. “These kinds of magical problems are fascinating, aren’t they?”
Harry realized, as he tried to shift carefully away.
He ached to tell Draco that it was ok, that the Dark Mark was just another scar, that it didn’t define him, that there was no part of Draco that repulsed Harry, no part of him that Harry could ever hate.
Harry darted a glance at Draco, hoping he’d be distracted by the mystery of it and forget his fear of this place. But Draco just shook his head, fingers trembling.
Without waiting for a response, Harry had kissed Draco on the temple and climbed out of bed. He pulled on trousers and a cloak before heading out to the Great Hall.
But Harry had another reason for coming to Hogwarts today, one that Draco couldn’t yet know about. And the walk would just have made Harry jittery, a needless burden on his already fraying nerves.
Harry blushed and stepped back, dropping his hand from Draco’s shoulder. Draco felt a flash of guilt for worrying him.
Harry stared at him challengingly, and Malfoy flinched away.
Draco went on as if he hadn’t heard. “I know I only met her a little over a year ago, but sometimes it feels like she’s all I have. She’s been so good to me, and I – I –” He broke off, lost for words.
When the sun went down, they went their separate ways, Draco back to his flat and Harry to have supper with Andromeda and Teddy. Harry spent one or two evenings a week with them, wanting to be there for his godson. Recently, he had started asking Draco to join him, and Draco thought that eventually he would.
“They immobilized me and put it on me screaming. Then Voldemort cast
The words were like a hook in Draco’s ribcage. The blood pounded in his temples as the air cinched tight. Harry tilted his head forward, his hair falling into rapidly darkening eyes.
Harry swallowed hard and scuffed one of his new dress shoes against the ground. When Malfoy didn’t so much as glance at him, Harry finally broke the silence. “What spell was that?”
Potter cut off abruptly and raised a hand to Draco’s cheek, fingers trailing lightly along the bone. “Your eye –”
Draco shot Harry a curious look. McGonagall just shook her head.
“Harry,” Draco gasped, “do you mean –”
But Draco needed one more thing, one last thing before he could let himself come apart. He seized his wand again, waving it above him before tossing it to the floor.
Catching Harry’s thoughtful look, Draco brightened and his words spilled out with even more enthusiasm. “They could have strengthened it, or even designed spells that purposely leaked dangerous residue! If they tampered with it, that would explain why it does not function in the ways we expect.”
Draco accepted the bag silently, before standing to stroll along the edge of the garden. Every so often, he’d pause and delicately collect a few buds or leaves. Harry did not follow, sensing that Draco needed a moment to gather himself. And when Draco returned to the blanket a short time later, new cloth pouch bulging with flowers, he was much more composed.
“Draco, Draco, Draco,” Blaise chided teasingly. “What have you not been telling me? Perhaps you’ve had some
Draco gawked at him.  “Do you hear yourself, Potter?” he asked incredulously.  “That’s precisely what you did to me!”
Harry visibly looked around in disbelief, taking in the two customers present.  “I’ll try not to, Madam Rosmerta.”
“Well, I’m – I’m sorry for all the animosity between our Houses,” Harry managed to stutter out.  “I hope there’s no bad blood between us.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, which looked at odds with his stiff demeanor.  “He can find me through this,” he spat, gesturing to his now-covered left forearm.
“Or you could stay and chat with
“Professor…I wanted to ask you something,” Harry hedged.
“What does that mean?” Harry asked, bewildered.  “I’m an auror, I know there are still dark wizards, but – ”
“You are far more than a mere symbol, Potter,” McGonagall cut in impatiently. “You are considered the saviour of the wizarding world. Your words hold weight; as do your actions. What do you think it looks like when you refuse to support the Hogwarts Unity event?”
Mock-pouting, Lavender obliged, and left them to themselves as she went off to the kitchen.  Parkinson gestured to a comfortable-looking chair across from a couch, and he gladly took a seat.  It was cozy and the flat was wonderfully warm, so Harry gratefully shucked his coat.
“And I hope we can be friends,” Harry went on, wondering how far he could push his luck.
— and here Draco’s stomach dropped; Harry didn’t like him after all, he didn’t want to spend time with him, it all meant nothing —
“Potter, you idiot,” Draco hissed, dragging him by the lapels into a side alley.  “You just apparated onto a muggle street!”
There was a moment where no one spoke and Harry felt desperately uncomfortable.  He definitely was
“You should!” Davis urged, still in stitches.
“I’m… not sure I have the time,” Draco hedged, hoping Connor would leave it at that.  As appealing as he was, with his surfer’s drawl and toned muscles and tanned skin, he wasn’t Potter, and that was his biggest flaw.  Because apparently Draco had terrible taste in men.
When they reached the door, Harry leaned forward and opened it before Draco could, which was a bit odd since Draco was in front, and gestured for Draco to go through with a short “after you.”  Draco couldn’t tell if he was imagining the feeling of Harry’s warmth behind him, seeping into the skin of his back.
Connor, bless him, let that slide, and having paid for his book, brushed past Potter without looking at him.  “See you later, Draco,” he farewelled, shooting Draco his famous grin before exiting the shop.
Uncle Vernon’s face turned the color of puce.  “
Lavender rolled her eyes playfully, but Harry couldn’t determine why.  “Of course,” she muttered.
“Harry Potter is here to see you,” Draco hastened to say, not wanting Greg to unduly worry.
Potter had promised to come back and see him — and had promised to give it a few days because he was so damn considerate all of a sudden — and then
“Just hear me out, Malfoy,” Harry plowed on, trying not to be intimidated by Malfoy’s silence.  “I’ve been thinking about how I behaved and I regret not, you know, being nicer.  I know I should’ve stopped you from making dark choices.”
Harry blinked, retreating his hand abruptly, like a spell had been broken.  “Sorry?” he asked, all traces of cordiality gone.
here to apologize to you.”
“I hardly yelled,” Draco scoffed, but she continued as if he hadn’t spoken.
, we don’t have time for this.  They’re coming.”  The blonde was frantic, eyes flitting around like he expected someone to apparate here and grab him.  Now that Harry got a good look at him, he could see that Malfoy’s skin was paler than normal, a sort of sickly green hue tinting his face.  His hands were quaking at his sides.  And his eyes.  Those silvery eyes were so afraid.  Malfoy had never been a good actor.  He couldn’t fake that.
Harry shook his head slightly, trying to deduce Draco’s motives.  He must have some other reason for wanting to help Harry.  Right?
Draco blushed, though he really shouldn’t have.  “One of them.”
The gravestones here were small and unobtrusive, and it made Harry feel horribly guilty walking through them with his infamous lightning scar and unwanted stardom.  Amongst these bones, he wasn’t a hero, he wasn’t a savior.  He wasn’t welcome.
Draco returned his attention to the book he was reading.  It was a fascinating read about shamans in different parts of Asia, and Draco wondered if anyone knew they were just wizards.  How many witches and wizards shared their gifts with muggles and lived among them without contact with the wizarding world?  Were they all like Draco, running away from the horrors of their pasts?  Or did they simply prefer the company of muggles?  Before the war, Draco would have scoffed at the possibility of preferring muggle company, but now he could understand the appeal.  They were just people after all, just like witches and wizards but without magic.  They were prejudiced about different things in its stead, like skin color and gender and sexuality, but at least they didn’t have insane nearly-immortal tyrants rise up every fifty years to try to take over the world.
“Before we begin, I want to thank you all, sincerely, for returning for this, your final year at Hogwarts. Hogwarts is more than a school, and far too much of your time here was taken away from you. You know better than anyone how much we have lost –”
Draco tensed, then scrambled to his knees.
Draco shifted to face Harry fully, resting their foreheads together. He closed his eyes and said simply, “You.”
“Brilliant,” Blaise mumbled, eyes dancing with reflected firelight. “Thanks.” His gaze went distant as he dug a small notebook out of his back pocket.
“No, hang on,” Harry interrupted. “I wasn’t hurt the night Draco popped into my bedroom. I just had a bad dream.”
For several long minutes, Draco hesitated by the door.
George made a confused noise at the compliment. “Actually, I’m pretty sure my plan failed.”
“Yes,” Draco said, as he took out the tea tin and pressed it into Harry’s free hand.
Draco looked so earnest that Harry couldn’t stand it.
“No,” Harry said carefully, “I noticed. I figured it had to do with your tea making process, keeping it pure, like.”
“Yes,” Hermione said with a decisive nod, “that’s what I thought too.”
Harry fell into Draco then, and for a time, they lost themselves in each other.
In front of Malfoy stood a plain wooden door, unremarkable in every way, except for the riot of color exploding through its frame. Dozens of wild, gorgeous flowers were forcing their way through every gap of the closed door, growing through the hinges and lock, spilling over the threshold. Harry could only stare as he breathed in the same crisp, sobering scent from last night.
Draco interrupted, grabbing Harry’s wrist. “What if you –”
Harry huffed grumpily. “It’s not working.”
“Oh,” Blaise said in a strangled little voice. “Oh
Halfway to the sofa, Harry froze and spun around.
Harry scrubbed a tired hand across his brow, but his resistance was flagging. He had never been good at fighting the inevitable leap into action. He looked up at Draco and grinned. “Right. Ok. This is probably a terrible idea! But I’m in. Let’s do it.”
Harry groaned, tearing off his own jeans and pants before collapsing onto the bed beside him.
“No one is being weird, Harry,” said Hermione.
“Maeve?” he asked, suddenly feeling brave. “Do you think it would be alright if I used some floo powder? There’s a call I should have made days ago.”
“Destroyed? I don’t –” Harry trailed off, shaking his head.
was, had to stop.
“Yeah,” Harry said, then paused until Draco managed to breathe his tension out. “She was worried about potions being made from the turtles’ shells. I told her my boyfriend was working on different kinds of potions, ones that won’t need to kill animals and insects.”
Eventually, Blaise ran out of things to talk about and looked at Draco expectantly.
“Are you busy?” Harry asked. “Hermione has some information for us. She’s going to call between meetings this afternoon.”
Draco opened his eyes and studied Harry’s face, brow furrowed in thought.
Draco could only hope that Harry understood.
A loud crack rang through the kitchen, and then,
But then Harry noticed Luna sitting quietly by the fire, and he had an idea. Other than a few Ravenclaws studying in a far corner, no one else was around. It was still rather early for a Sunday.
Draco’s eyes snapped open, and he and Harry watched as the strange picture shimmered and pulsed. It was fuzzy and indistinct, an abstract art piece, until abruptly and all at once, it was
Hermione Granger was sitting on the sofa, a tea tray competing for space with all the parchment she had spread across the table in front of her. She was dressed in jeans and a silky purple blouse, her hair a wild mess of curls cascading over her shoulders.
“I’m fine, Professor,” he said. “Check me if you need to.”
“Oh hello,” Arthur added, turning to Draco and holding out a hand. “Draco, is it? Harry tells me you’re interested in Muggle science. Do you know anything about water pressure?”
Giving her a casual wave, Harry said, “See you around, Pansy.”
The word seemed to break the spell over both of them. Draco jumped back a step and averted his eyes, while Harry yanked the blankets from beneath him and threw them over his lap. He pushed himself upright and leaned against the headboard, dropping his head into his hands.
right now) drifted out from an ancient radio in the corner of the room.  A room which was filled to the brim with stylish witches and wizards of all ages.  Several seemed quite appalled by their entrance, including an astoundingly tall woman wearing a color-changing feather boa who gasped audibly at their appearance, but a few others began applauding softly, as if Draco and Harry had just performed a stunt for their amusement.  Beside him, Potter almost bowed but Draco managed to grab his arm to stop them from further embarrassment.
“Fuck off, Potter,” Nott snapped, not even looking up from the floor.
Harry was just about to turn around and give up on the whole endeavor when the blonde himself stepped out of the bookstore, poised as usual.  Malfoy nearly tripped over his feet however when he spotted Harry standing just a few meters away.
Hermione glanced at Parkinson knowingly.  “When?”
Ron looked decidedly uncomfortable, but Hermione just rolled her eyes.  “If it’s to do with Draco, I’m sure you did
Draco let out a chuckle, imagining how Mill would take it if Harry apologized to her while seemingly drunk.  She’d probably break the bottle over his head.
“And I’m sure you’re not daydreaming about him right now, are you?” Lavender teased lightly.
Harry strode in first, looking much more confident than when they’d first arrived (maybe it’d been the crowds that had bothered him; Draco could relate to that), and Draco followed after, with Blaise bringing up the rear and closing the door behind the three of them.  Harry lingered in the middle of the room, looking unsure what to do with himself, so Draco set the example by sitting on one side of the couch, and Harry gratefully followed his lead, plopping down next to him.  Blaise filled three glasses with the aforementioned firewhiskey, and handed them off, sipping at his own tactfully as he took a seat in an adjacent chair.
Millicent Bulstrode hadn’t been in very high spirits when Harry had ambushed her at her job in an unassuming muggle pub.  “Do all your mates work at pubs?” Harry had asked Draco, who had scoffed but not bothered to answer.  He’d almost asked if all Draco’s mates liked muggles now, but the question seemed insensitive, so he kept his mouth shut.  He didn’t fancy Draco storming off on him again.  It’d been hard enough to get him to tolerate Harry for
“So,” Har–Potter ventured, “will you introduce us?”
Harry let out a huff of frustration.  “No!” he hissed.  “It’s at the Burrow.”
really,” Harry babbled on, trying not to fidget.  “It’s just, I realize that I wasn’t, er, making the best the choices either, when it came to you and the other Slytherins.  So I just – I want to make things right, because….”
“Just a drink, then.”  Connor was still eyeing Draco flirtatiously.  “You owe me.”
Draco refused to look as off-balance as he felt, but it was difficult with those entrancing brown eyes staring at him like nothing else existed in the world.  “That depends if you want a happy or sad ending.”
.  Whatever it was, Harry found he didn’t really care either way.  As long as Draco came with him.
Parkinson snorted.  “I was a lousy friend,” she told him casually.  “I threw a fit whenever Draco wouldn’t snog me.  I thought I was in love with him, you see,” she admitted, looking more smug than embarrassed.  “But that was when I was still convinced we were both straight.”
might.”
Draco glared at the cheerfulness of it all, sitting on his usual park bench.
Harry, who had just downed his glass like a shot and was swaying slightly as he set the empty glass on the side table, blinked a few times to get his bearings.  Blaise’s eyes followed his unsteady movements with a critical eye, but he made no comment.  “Er, yes, brief…as a button,” he said with renewed valor, and Draco blushed on his behalf.
“How about,” Pansy countered slyly, “you invite him for drinks?”
“Are you kidding?” he said in astonishment, “Harry fancying
“No,” Harry blurted, seizing the opportunity, “I don’t!”
“I’m finished,” Draco snapped, pulling Harry from his thoughts once more.  Merlin, he had never been this bad at school, even in Professor Binns’ class.
Harry just looked up at him challengingly.  He might be trying to get on Draco’s good side, but he wasn’t about to be pushed around by an insufferable brat.
“That’s bullocks,” Draco snapped, smile vanishing.  “Pansy loves you now, and Blaise is even asking when you’ll be visiting again.  Even Greg has expressed concern over your mental state, without prompting.”
Draco’s gaze slid back to his, and Harry had to repress a shiver.  His sneer was back in place.  “I’m not interested in discussing the mental capacity of your… best mate.”
Rolling his eyes again, Draco made to leave, but Potter reached out and grabbed his arm.  “Malfoy,” he said, sounding embarrassed — as he should be.
– but you could say, er,
“So I guess you’re blameless then?” Draco cut in flatly.  His menacing tone rivaled that of Professor Snape’s.
Harry looked around the empty store pointedly.  “Are you busy?”
“Do you accept my apology then?” Harry asked, still smiling like he expected a positive response.
Harry’s feet began moving without him deciding to and he found himself leaving the Leaky Cauldron as fast as he could.  He couldn’t figure out what he was feeling, but his stomach felt tight, and his lungs felt smaller than usual, and his head felt like it was spinning.
“So what is it this time, Potter?” Draco interrogated once they were out of earshot of the nearest dog-walker.  “Not another apology, I hope.  Or are you trying to alert the wizarding world to where I live so I can be exploited by paparazzi?”
Harry Potter was going to be the death of him.
Bloody Potter.  With his stupid bloody scar, and his ridiculously unkempt hair, and his bloody awful glasses.  What a prat.  Always expecting everything in life to be handed to him, even forgiveness.  It was such bullocks.
, said a small voice in Harry’s head,
Potter quickened his pace so that he was walking beside Draco.  “Why?” he asked, scrunching up his face like he was trying to figure out the meaning of life.
“There’s no bad blood where there’s pure blood,” she told Harry in her most magnanimous voice, the sunlight illuminating her blonde hair like an angel’s halo, and Draco winced.  He’d been hoping they wouldn’t stumble onto this topic.
.”  One of his hands reached up to pull at his own hair, a look of torment on his features.  Draco wanted to smooth that look away.  “I fucked up, I know,” Harry went on, his other hand dragging over his face roughly.  His legs couldn’t stay still, shifting back and forth, trying to find a comfortable spot.  “I’ve done it again, and again, and
startled Harry enough to respond.  “Are you mad?  Those are the places that
The blonde didn’t turn or acknowledge him in any way.
“And you as well,” Potter replied cheerfully.  He then turned to Draco with a determined expression.  “Malfoy,” he started, “I need your help.”
“Correct,” Draco agreed brusquely.  “Now, for the most part — excepting the Lovegoods probably — no one considers animals to be on the same level as humans.  The same sort of ideology exists when we study muggles.  It’s all about how much
Draco made a contemptuous face.  “I would never attend something that grossly anti-Slytherin.”
“What a gentleman you are, Potter,” Draco found himself saying.  Harry’s responding laugh made Draco’s pulse double its tempo, and his palms became instantly sweaty.
“I know it’s too little, too late,” he added, staring at the cup-like curve of the tulip petals, pale against the dirt.  “But I think, if things had been different… very different… maybe you and I could have been friends.”  Harry grimaced, remembering a particular incident when Crabbe had taunted Susan Bones in fifth year.  “Or maybe not friends,” he amended.  “But maybe not enemies either.  You could have been a good man, with the right influences.”  Harry shook his head, realizing he was just criticizing Crabbe again, rather than taking responsibility for his own behavior.  “Regardless,” Harry forged on, “I know you did what you did to make your family and friends proud.  And that
“Is he hot?”
has changed,” Harry insisted, wishing he could say the right thing to make Draco less defensive, the magic words to make him understand.
Draco narrowed his eyes at the offending man.  “And
“Marcus,” Harry said, a bit stiffly, “hello.”
Harry frowned at her.  “What?”
Harry took the seat next to him as casually as if they were old friends, and politely asked Rosmerta if he could have a butterbeer as well.  “I’ve been looking for you,” Harry went on conversationally.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Hermione sighed, hiding her face in her hands.
Draco stopped in his tracks to face Potter, crossing his arms again.  “How dare you assume I’m insulting my friend,” he snapped, as Potter stared at him in bewilderment.  “I say he should’ve been in Hufflepuff because he’s as loyal as they come, and he isn’t opposed to hard work.  Slytherin is for those ambitious and cunning enough to avoid ever working harder than absolutely necessary.  Even in our friendships.”  Draco shifted on his feet, suddenly uneasy with Potter’s all-too-knowing gaze.  “And he deserved better than us.”
Bore him?  Harry straightened up hastily, realizing he’d been slumping slightly, and scrambled for words.  “No – I – er – continue what you were saying,” he stuttered so very casually, endeavoring to listen intently to whatever Draco was saying.  Unfortunately, this meant his eyes kept sliding down to Draco’s lips.  He forced himself to look into Draco’s steely grey eyes instead, which wasn’t too hard once he got there.  There was just a hint of blue in those smoky depths, and Harry chased after it with his eyes.  If he stared long enough, he was sure he could evoke the exact color.
Harry frowned.  “If the Ministry comes, we’re safe.”
“Why doesn’t he use magic?” Harry asked under his breath, as he watched Nott labour away.
Parkinson sat back in consideration, popping the chip into her mouth.  “You really don’t know, do you?” she said thoughtfully as she chewed.
Draco huffed at the very true remark, and finally grabbed Harry’s arm again.  “Fine,” he relented.
By the time Draco finished his rant, he was panting slightly, and he had to take another sip of his butterbeer to hide his loss of composure.
“Alright,” Draco muttered, thinking they had probably labeled the maps correctly.
Sorry, not the ships you signed up for - don't worry, it's still drarry!  Next chapter is all drarry ;)
Hermione blushed, as she always did when someone had charmed her.  Even Ron looked impressed as he watched Parkinson leave.  “I like her,” Hermione declared, facing them again.
“Well – I mean – it’s obviously supposed to,” Harry hurriedly added, “but overall I do worry it – just a bit – might actually be demonising the Slytherins. You know, since they didn’t fight.”
“Because,” Parkinson snapped, waving another of Harry’s chips in his face, “Draco has been sulking for the past five days after your little excursion and I want to know why.”
Draco frowned at him, trying to pretend he hadn’t just been imagining Harry drenched in butterbeer.  Mill was an odd choice.  It wasn’t like Potter had ever really interacted with her.  What was he going to apologize for?  As ridiculous as Potter’s decision was, Draco stood to imply he was ready to go.  He left his butterbeer on the counter, not wanting the rest, and Harry looked sadly at his own barely touched butterbeer before sighing and standing as well.
Draco turned his head, hiding against his own shoulder. “Yes,” he muttered. Harry had to strain to hear. “But they had done worse before. That – that wasn’t why.”
The Hall suddenly seemed very crowded, oppressive even, but the only way out was through. Harry squared his shoulders and set his path toward those open doors. Predictably, each body he passed reached out to him. Harry shook hands absently, nodding and smiling vaguely when a response seemed required, but did not linger. In that moment, he was immune to small talk.
Draco undressed him slowly, baring Harry’s skin inch by inch as he pressed chaste kisses over Harry’s entire body.
Mind going pleasantly fuzzy, Draco gasped. He needed more. More skin, more heat, more
And so, on the night when Blaise Zabini
Malfoy’s face hardened. “It’s called research, Potter,” he snapped. “Which you would know if you ever bothered to pick up a book.”
“Nonsense, Draco,” Maeve said, interrupting his spirited defense of pencils and log books. “The inventory spells are self-sustaining. I designed them myself, and I won’t hear any more about it!”
Draco cocked his head, eyes darting erratically around the garden as he considered that. “So your kickboxing – stance? The way you move your body, I mean – it made your spells more effective?”
With an appreciative hum, Draco glanced over his shoulder at Harry before stepping into the bath. He submerged himself slowly, and the candlelight played over his skin, blanketing him in shifting planes of mystery and shadow.
“Yeah, alright,” Harry said agreeably. He caught Draco by the chin and brushed their lips together. “I feel it, ok? Intuitively. I know this is real. But that’s not how your brain works. So I thought it through, the way you would, to help me explain to you what I already understood.”
What Draco felt when he first kicked off the ground defied description. It was a nameless, rushing joy that cut to the bone as surely as did the wind.
And then his hand was in Draco’s pants, calloused and rough and entirely perfect, squeezing Draco with just the right amount of pressure.
“Nothing,” Hermione said flippantly, as if that should be obvious.
When they got into bed, Draco lay flat on his back, staring blankly up at the ceiling. Harry settled on his side. He braced his elbow against the mattress and propped his head in hand, gazing down at Draco.
Harry reached up to tug the pillow into a better position before hugging Draco to him more firmly, one hand rubbing up and down Draco’s back.
They didn’t quite make it to the table.
Harry kissed him, sucking teasingly on his bottom lip. Draco gasped, and brought his hands up to clutch at Harry’s shoulders.
, Malfoy,” Harry whispered.
that he couldn’t help starting to giggle. Draco moaned once in frustration, then dropped his head onto Harry’s shoulder, smothering his own giggles.
Malfoy was standing rigidly above, demanding to know where Harry had been since he had rushed out of the classroom earlier. Apparently, Malfoy had been looking for him, and Harry almost had to lie back down when he processed that, dizzy with a sudden rush of warmth.
When Potter hadn’t reappeared at the teashop, Draco had assumed the two apparition incidents had been a fluke. Some odd magical flare-up, perhaps, like the physical manifestation of a headache or a sneeze. Potter hadn’t looked well, after all, and two weeks was certainly long enough for the problem to have passed.
“You could bring it with you,” Draco suggested at the disheartened expression on Harry’s face.
Draco swallowed.  “But I could’ve done the right thing.  I was too afraid.”
Draco wondered if she thought that would really persuade him, because in actuality it was only making him more desperate to leave.  Astoria wasn’t Daphne, but she still wasn’t exactly tolerant.  “As much as I’d love to chat with Astoria, we really must run,” Draco insisted, turning towards the door and reaching out to snag Harry’s sleeve.  Harry wasn’t speaking up yet, and Draco worried coming here hadn’t been a good idea after all.  Maybe Harry would be mad at
“No,” Harry rushed, “no, of course not.”  He frowned again, which then somehow morphed into a smile.  “It’s just, you act different around him.  Like the Malfoys I remember.”
Harry sighed.  “Maybe you’re right.  They don’t want to see me.  I’m not fixing anything like this.”
Apparently that was enough to make Draco give in, because he sighed and muttered, “Suit yourself,” and led the way to the door.
Draco grimaced, crossing his arms.  “What are you doing, Potter?”  His jacket sleeves pulled up a little at the wrists, and for some reason the pale skin there was monopolizing Harry’s thoughts.
Draco met her earnest eyes. “It doesn’t erase my past.  I…was like those people…those people who believed they were better than others.  Superior.”  The confession was more difficult than he’d imagined.  His vision seemed to swim and crossfade to the face of the muggle studies teacher that the Dark Lord had tortured and killed in his own dining room, and the way Nagini had swallowed her body whole as she struggled and begged.  Harry wouldn’t have sat there petrified and done nothing.  He would’ve saved her, the great big hero that he was.
“Of course it’s about you,” Harry muttered to the empty air, and then shook his head like that would rid his brain of stupidity.  He hadn’t even apologized for the
Draco bristled at the idea.  A Malfoy never begged, even the pathetic last heir.  Mother would be appalled.
Beyond the gate was a mile-long dirt driveway that led up to a mansion which, if possible for a mansion, looked rather quaint.  The mansion was a soft cream-yellow color, like diffused sunlight, with sky blue highlights along the edges that wavered like a mirage.  It made the whole building appear to shimmer like an illusion on the perfectly manicured grass.  The sun was quite warm here, with no clouds in sight, and the entire estate was exceedingly welcoming.  Without them even having to knock or otherwise announce their presence, the gates parted to let them in.  Draco wasn’t sure if they’d been manually allowed in by the sisters, or if the wards were set to always let him in.  Astoria could be sweet, and luckily much less exuberant when it came to Daphne’s ideals, but both sisters put Draco on edge.  Possibly because they were constantly trying to seduce him.
“You’re a doctor?” Malfoy asked, feeling thrown.
“All the time?” he repeated in a strained whisper.  “Draco, you could face Azkaban for that!”
There was a moment of silence as Flint stared at Harry, open-mouthed.  His teeth looked like they were trying to jump out.  Then, without warning, he busted out laughing, a raucous, hacking laugh that made Harry want to cover his ears.  “Tracey!” he bellowed, still cackling, his eyes watering in his mirth.  “Get out here, this is priceless!”
you interested in, then?”
He glanced at the clock again – fifteen minutes left. He sighed, and tried to return to the task at hand.
Draco shook his head adamantly.  “No, I’m coming back, I most certainly am not wasting my day with that abominable wiz—
“Potter?” Malfoy questioned perplexedly.  He brought a hand to smooth over his hair, as if a strand were out of place, and then elegantly placed both hands into his pockets.  “Whatever are you doing here?”
“Your presence is a curse, Pansy,” Draco informed her with a long sigh.  “We all just suffer through it.”
Harry frowned at him.  “Are you trying to encourage me?” he asked, perplexed.  Since when did Draco actually want him to succeed?
Harry frowned.  “Er, well….”
“Yes,” Draco rushed to say before Harry could respond, “and you’re an elitist snob with no friends.”  Arguably not the best comeback for a twenty-one year old, but at least Harry would know where he stood.
“Give me a happy ending,” Connor said seductively, and Draco almost stumbled over his words as he agreed.
, Potter,” Draco grumbled after his scowls and eye rolls didn’t do the trick.  “You asked to come here, don’t blame me.”
Draco barked a laugh in surprise, and of course that was all Potter needed to go back to grinning overzealously again.
?  That’s the funniest thing I’ve ever heard!”
“And besides,” Hermione went on, “it’s not up to us who Harry likes.  He’s doesn’t even realize it yet himself.”
? I didn’t even know until – until yesterday!”
“One minute,” Harry insisted, clutching onto Malfoy’s cloak in turn and dragging him into the house, Aunt Petunia’s hardwood floors be damned.
Harry crossed his arms.  “How?”
“He’s — ” Harry spluttered helplessly, “He’s changed now, Ron, I know he has.”
To prevent further rudeness, Draco opted to speak for him.  “Do we have any maps, Doctor?  Potter has somehow lost his way.”
“Romance, huh?” Connor murmured from right behind Draco, and Draco spun around to be face to face with the dashing Californian.
“Because,” he finished valiantly, “it’s the right thing to do.”
“What else?” Pansy muttered.  She laid her head on Lavender’s shoulder adoringly.
Heaving a great sigh, Draco turned to the entrance of the shop and braced himself to deal with Harry Potter.  The drizzle had petered out, to Draco’s relief, but the air was still chilly, and Draco crossed his arms to keep warm.  Potter was standing to the side of the door, and he grinned at Draco as he stepped up beside him.
McGonagall stood with a huff.  “The same students?”
Daphne laughed that tinkling laugh again, ambling over and placing her free hand on Harry’s arm.  Her fingers were so delicate, resting just above his elbow; Draco could almost feel the uptick in Harry’s heartbeat.  For the briefest of moments, Draco imagined
in his eyes?  Draco felt anger boiling up inside him as he ripped the map open and jabbed his finger at a spot on Norwood Road.  “We’re here,” he forced out through gritted teeth, and jabbed his finger at a different spot.  “This is the closest entrance to the Ministry.  Now go.”
Harry licked his lips nervously, and Draco glanced down at them so quickly Harry wasn’t sure if he imagined it or not.  “Ron says the Chudley Cannons are going to win this season.”
Draco leaned back, crossing his arms.  “Of course he does.  Weasley’s an imbecile.”  Draco turned his gaze to the rest of the pub, as if looking for a way out of this non-date with Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No buts,” she snapped, “bring your gameboy with you in the car.  We’re leaving right now.”
“Because it’s the right thing to do,” Draco finished, raising his eyebrows in a challenge.  Potter opened and closed his mouth a few times, apparently stumped.  He rather resembled a gasping fish.  His eyes were smoldering with anger however, and Draco felt rather accomplished at having finally wiped that cheerful expression off his face.  Potter’s green eyes were magnetizing this close up, and Draco suddenly registered how close they really were, only about a foot apart, gazing into each other’s eyes.  Greg apparently noticed this too, as he cleared his throat pointedly, causing Draco to hastily turn back to his friend as if nothing had happened.
Harry’s fists clenched of their own volition.  Anger was rising up in him like it had all fifth year.  “Like hell you can’t,” he growled.  “We go together or not at all.”
And Draco strode away, gratified that those were the last words he was ever going to say to Harry James Potter.
Draco raised his eyebrows at him.  “You don’t know how to get home from here?” he asked dubiously.
“Malfoy?” Harry asked again; maybe it was a practical joke.  Maybe Ron was pulling his leg.  Maybe he had to come in disguise.
“I’m really bad at apologizing,” he mumbled.
“A good classic, I guess,” Connor said with a shrug.  His voice was low and smooth, and it was doing things to Draco’s stomach.  “I’m open to suggestions,” he added, with a grin at Draco.
Several witches at a nearby table glanced over with shocked expressions and then burst into giggles.  Harry blushed terribly, and lowered his voice to a strained whisper.  “What on earth made you think that?”
,” she spat as she recovered her composure.  “Are you trying to kill me now?”
“And it matters,” Harry said quietly, almost pleading.  There was only a couple feet between them.  “Your forgiveness, it matters to me.”
“Why does everyone keep saying that?” Draco grumbled, more annoyed that she was right.  Pansy had tried to force him into discussing Harry every time he saw her after the apology mission.  It was why he’d come here today instead.
He wanted to obey that voice.  He wanted to do whatever it asked.  “Not without you,” he said, catching Malfoy’s wrist in his hand.  “Draco.”
They passed that portrait of Blaise’s maybe-father now, and those lost blue eyes followed them as they went.  If he could speak, Draco wondered what he would say.
“I’m not sure if that went well or not, honestly,” Harry interrupted as they strode down the street.
— he had dimples.  “California, born and bred.”
“I’m glad we could help, Harry. We’ll be here,” Dumbledore added cheekily, “if you need us. Now go, I believe you have plans to make.”
Stupid bloody Potter with his stupid bloody promises and his big green eyes and his dumb messy hair.  Argh, Draco was going crazy!
“Thanks for the warning,” Potter grumbled, but when Draco glanced over he was smiling again.
“I am,” Harry replied honestly, “but I haven’t gotten Malfoy to accept my apology yet.”
Ron snorted again, reminding everyone of his presence, and muttered, “I’d say he’s more than fond of you, mate,” before Hermione elbowed him harshly in the side.  Ron exclaimed in pain as Parkinson looked on with a faintly amused smile.
“And you’re cold,” Harry said pointedly, not bothering to argue.  Draco’s coat was thinner than Harry’s, and he desperately wanted to drape his around the other’s shoulders, but no-doubt that would be taken as an attack of some sort.
“A fucking apology!” Flint reiterated gleefully.  “I could kick his arse!”
Malfoy strode forward, breezing past Harry as he continued on his way.
“I still wish Harry had chosen someone other than Malfoy,” Ron was saying, presumably around a bite of food due to the muffling of his words.
I'm so sorry for the wait! School is killing me, lol I actually have a test in 10 minutes
Greg’s eyebrows shot up so high they nearly disappeared into his hairline.  “To see
“Well,” Hermione went on carefully like she was trying not to startle him, “maybe he’s been waiting for you to contact him.”
“This is about Harry Potter, isn’t it?” Ros guessed, interrupting his musings and giving him a sly smile.
“Why then?” Connor asked, taking a pull of his beer.
Ron had begun desperately scraping at his plate with his fork so as not to let any food go to waste, and the scratching was getting on Harry’s nerves.  Hermione waved her wand without looking away from Harry, and the sound was instantly muted.
But how could he focus when he didn’t know when he’d be seeing Draco again, or what they would talk about when they did, or if he could ever kiss those inviting lips in anything other than his imagination….
Lavender came in through the other doorway as Parkinson pulled open the front door to let Draco in.  He was currently leaned against the opposite wall of the hallway, visible through the door, with his coat slung over his arm and an unhappy expression on his pointed face.
Draco stared at the man next to him, feeling halfway between panicked and hopeful.  Everything about him was golden-brown, from his eyes, to his skin, to his hair.  He looked like the definition of ‘sun-kissed.’  And it didn’t matter that every time Draco didn’t see green eyes or black hair or a stupid lightning scar on his forehead he felt a twinge of disappointment.  It was about time Harry Potter stopped ruling his life.
Draco looked back at the other man; his hair had somehow become more disheveled than before.  “But he didn’t accept your apology,” Draco pointed out, wondering how Harry had forgotten that so quickly.
Draco stared intently into his glass; he didn’t want to see Connor’s reaction.
Draco looked into his drink before Connor could catch him staring.  He couldn’t do it.  Not with Harry’s face burned into his retinas.
“No,” he said quickly, the guilt still gnawing at his stomach, “I’m not, but – ”
“But I do regret it, Rosmerta,” Harry stressed, sounding almost desperate.
He slowed as he reached the intricate green sign announcing The Dragon’s Lair, wondering how he should broach the subject with Malfoy.  Should he just go up to him and start apologizing?  Should he preface with an explanation or a joke?  Harry examined the tiny dragons decorating the shop front’s sign.  Maybe this wasn’t a great idea, after all.
Harry looked up at him with tired green eyes, and it was very hard to think anything at all while he was doing that.  Draco looked away.
Draco Malfoy?  What should I know about my ex-nemesis?”
He had been so close.  Draco could’ve touched him.  How could Harry go from setting Draco’s teeth on edge to making him feel like the most important person in the world?  That was how Harry looked at him sometimes, like nothing else mattered, like nothing else
“Thanks,” Harry said slowly, starting to doubt their sanity.
Draco snapped his book shut, startling a few nearby pigeons, and got to his feet.  All he wanted to do was find Potter and strangle him.  Curse him for getting himself stuck in Draco’s head all week.  He’d survived for three years Potter-free and now suddenly he’d encountered the man twice in less than a week.  At least he wouldn’t be coming back, Draco had been quite clear about that.  And yet, every time Draco’s thoughts drifted they landed on Harry bloody Potter!
Draco glowered back.  “It’s not, and you know it.”  He sat back, arms crossed calmly, contorting his expression into one of haughtiness.  “And if you don’t, you really are brainwashed.”
“Sorry?” The-Imbecile-Who-Lived asked, tilting his head to the side.
This evening was no exception.  When Draco stumbled from the Zabini fireplace — right into Potter who hadn’t bothered to make space for him, forcing Draco to steady himself by clutching onto Harry’s shoulders — the smooth notes of a muggle jazz band (muggle music was
Harry’s mirth vanished rather abruptly but he forced himself to keep laughing until his friends were catching their breaths.  There was no reason to be upset.  He wasn’t upset.
“What was her name?”
“Well,” Ron said hesitantly.  “Is it?”
Harry felt his lips curling up at the corners, beyond his control. Draco liked him. His own Godfather had spoken to it. Draco Malfoy
Harry looked between the two, frustration welling in his gut.  “I haven’t even seen him in three years.  Does that sound like stalking to you?”  They remained silent, but exchanged a loaded glance.  “We’re all adults now,” Harry added.  “And I never once reached out to try to make things right.  It’s passed time I did that.”
Malfoy’s head snapped up, surprise written across his features, but he didn’t question Harry’s decision.  “Less than fifteen minutes, I’d wager,” he breathed.
Ron nodded, though he seemed surprised by his own agreement.  “She’s not as horrible as I remember,” he said thoughtfully.
“Yeah, but,” Ron replied, sounding resigned but woeful, “there’s loads of blokes who’d be into Harry.  Charlie’s gay, what about him?”
Draco groaned.  It was Harry, it had to be.  No one else would be so stupid as to send Draco letters via owl when he lived in a muggle area.  And no one else would have the timing Harry did.  Draco was caught between irritation, amusement, and relief.  The spot on his knee where Connor was touching him felt uncomfortable all of a sudden.
Harry rolled his eyes, not letting Draco’s lack of enthusiasm diminish his good mood.  “I survived Flint,” he said dismissively.  “I’m sure I can handle a bit of foul language.”
Draco watched Connor’s lips as he smiled cordially at the bartender serving them.  They looked soft.  And Connor was clearly interested.  All Draco had to do was lean over….
Dr. Finch glanced up at him in amusement, but made no comment at the quote from his favorite muggle play.
Suddenly, finally, the clock struck noon and Harry was up out of his seat ready to apparate to the Dragon’s Lair, abandoning his reports on his desk. Kingsley wouldn’t be pleased but Harry couldn’t be bothered.
“I, er,” Harry stuttered, “got turned around.  Which way is Diagon Alley?”
This chapter is like ten times longer than I intended oops enjoy
Hermione looked mortified, though considering what had just transpired Harry felt he was the only one there who should be feeling that way.  “But you said,” she began timidly, “you were…
, Draco knew.  He’d seen Harry enough times with his friends, and his girlfriends in the past, to know that he didn’t look at anyone like that.  Only Draco.
“See you around, mate!” Harry called out as he skittered back to Draco’s side.
“Um, I like anything,” he answered casually.  Draco glanced over his shoulder to see Connor running his fingers over the spines of the books, just as Draco loved to do.  It made him smile fondly.
“We’re not in school anymore, Ronald,” Hermione scolded lightly.  “I’m sure he’s not so bad.”
He flew up until the clouds began to obscure his view, determined to put as much distance as possible between them before dropping down to navigate.  They’d only been flying a few minutes when Draco gasped in Harry’s ear and let go with one arm.
“If we don’t catch this sale, we won’t be getting them for another month at least,” Petunia warned.
But now was not the time to dwell on that.  He took off as fast as the broom would allow, gaining altitude until the houses looked like lego blocks below, and he could just barely make out the Dursleys driving away in their car.  And even as Harry and Draco flew away, he could still hear the loud bang of apparition from below as Death Eaters appeared and swarmed number four, Privet Drive.  Harry hoped they wouldn’t pursue the Dursleys in an attempt to find him.  Maybe they’d just wait, thinking they’d gone out to the pictures or something.
Harry rolled his eyes, but he was grinning. Draco smirked and tucked into his own plate.
Draco huffed out a frustrated breath. “I told you ‘clean up’ is not the proper –”
Harry nodded, still cradling Draco’s head in his hands. “Promise.”
When Harry came to a minute later, he found that his head was nestled in Draco’s lap. He smiled up at him. “Hello, darling.”
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco panted, biting his way down Harry’s neck. “Bloody indecent.” He pulled back, eyes glued to the hard planes of Harry’s chest as his hands smoothed over the sinfully tight emerald fabric.
Harry beamed at him.
Draco led Harry inside. “Make yourself comfortable. I just need to change, and then I’ll start your potion.”
After a tour, Harry had met with Blooms’ Headmistress, Cynthia Vandersprite. Her office was comfortable and inviting, and she had made Harry feel right at home. No star-struck wonder, no invasive questions, no probing comments. Cynthia had treated Harry like a normal volunteer, offering him tea, showing off some endearingly hideous art projects, and listening attentively to his thoughts about how he would like to get involved.
It was impossibly tight, warm and wet and –
“You should rest,” he whispered.
“I know it’s hard for you,” Draco said, “but we can work on it together. I promise, Harry. We’ll figure it out.” He stroked a thumb over Harry’s cheek. “I always want to help you.”
“Mmm, of course.” Harry teased the spot just below Draco’s ear with his tongue. “And I needed to kiss you first because…”
“What kind of cake?” Ginny asked, sounding delighted.
Just as Harry was about to thank McGonagall, Draco had spoken up, asking to travel to Azkaban in the Headmistress’ stead.
Harry shook his head.
to the Headmistress?” Draco hissed.
It was a relatively small space, painted a vibrant turquoise. White shelves were scattered erratically over the walls, cluttered with decorative teapots and vases. Each was filled to bursting with bright pink and orange flowers. Clustered around the room were numerous small wooden tables and cozy looking armchairs. It should have been overwhelming, but there was something about the place that put Harry immediately at ease.
Harry gasped. He clutched at Draco’s hips and dragged him closer. Draco came willingly, straddling Harry’s thighs and winding his fingers into the hair at Harry’s nape. He tugged slightly and Harry’s brain went fuzzy. His entire body fizzled, like he was being cocooned in Draco’s magic.
Harry dug his fingers into the rocky soil in an attempt to ground himself. An explosion of temper would not help Draco.
“Wh-what?” Hermione stammered.
“Did that seem –” Draco hesitated, not wanting to seem judgmental – “strange to you?”
Harry breathed.
With a smirk of satisfaction, Draco settled back into his chair and gestured for Harry to eat. The meat was glistening, wrapped in slow-cooked bacon that had moistened the loaf with every drip of its fat. And the glaze he used added a smoky sweetness, tying all the flavors together.
Draco blinked down at Harry’s untidy scrawl. The ink was faded, but not enough to obscure the message.
for me, though. Only a groom.”
“He asked me about my favorite type of clues,” Harry said, raising his eyebrows questioningly at Ginny.
Draco rolled his shoulders until he found a comfortable position. Watching, Harry shivered, desperate to cover Draco’s body with his own.
“Do you want to go home?” Harry asked, eyeing the open door.
“Can I –” Harry asked, voice shaking. “Can I move?”
“Speak for yourself,” Harry muttered under his breath, because he
“Thank Merlin,” Draco said. “I thought the stillness of this place would kill me.” He inhaled deeply and closed his eyes, chin still raised like he was searching for the sun.
The thought of flying was like a blade flaying Draco’s skin. He swallowed hard and ignored the feeling, returning his focus to the match. After an interminable time of flailing limbs, the instructor held up the arm of the winning child and consoled the other with a proud smile and pat on the back. Both children were beaming as a new pair replaced them on the mat.
Draco reached out a hand to steady himself against a chair, and Harry couldn’t stand it a second longer. He strode forward and pulled Draco into a fierce hug.
Ron grinned cheekily. “There’s a reason we never let you play chaser, mate.” He laughed and scored another direct hit.
Harry drew in a breath, but his chest felt hollow. He tugged at the hem of his t-shirt and turned his head away.
Draco’s fingers twitched, finding their way to that silver ring of his. He twirled it once, then stilled and lifted his eyes back to Harry’s. “Yes, alright.”
“Good.” Harry rubbed the nape of his neck, still looking sheepish. “What do you need then?” He glanced around the room curiously, taking in the cluttered counter and the dishes overflowing the sink.
Hermione gave him a meaningful look and nodded her head toward the garden. “Go lean into the
He lunged forward and kissed Draco violently. They collapsed back onto the bed, where Harry struggled to kiss Draco breathless, stave off his impending orgasm, and watch Draco’s fingers disappear inside his own arse, all at the same time.
Not that Draco had said anything of the sort. He hadn’t even argued when Harry asked him if he’d come to Sunday lunch. No excuses, no snarky remarks to mask his fear. Just a simple
“The residue,” Harry interrupted, “it’s always around people. I told you that, remember? There are always at least a few hooks clinging to people, waiting for a spell.”
“It’s not a book club, Ron,” Hermione corrected.
There was a rustle in the underbrush behind them and they both jumped. A small animal darted across the shore of the lake. An owl glided silently after it, a graceful grey ghost on the hunt.
“Are you sure?” Potter’s eyes flickered toward Draco and away again. “You were shaking really badly.”
“I do,” Draco said. “It’s past time.”
Draco nodded. “Be grateful I spared you the passage about actual infidelity. It is
Harry looked down at his hands. “You have to hate the person you’re casting at, or

, in sheer relief this time), Harry tried to interrupt, but Draco continued to ramble right over him.
“You know nothing is going to change, right?” Harry said, looking up at him.
But what had he done, exactly?
It would start with an offhand remark, a casual mention of running into Malfoy at the shops. And then there’d be a gleam and a sudden distance in Harry’s eyes, and Ginny would know she’d lost him.
“She always does.” Harry blew out an annoyed breath. “Well, whatever she’s not telling us, it’s not dangerous. She’d never take a risk like that, not if it could hurt me.”
Harry moaned. “Fuck. Draco.” His eyes were locked on Draco, his own movements beginning to slow as he watched Draco wank himself.
Was spontaneous, accidental apparition a thing? Harry had been working up the courage to ask Hermione.
“Potter?” Draco dropped his hands to his lap, the unbandaged one tightening on his knee.
“Am I?” Draco sighed.
But then Malfoy lowered his head, presumably for a closer look at the flower buds he was examining, and a few strands of that white gold hair fell into his eyes. The rest of it was pulled back in the most un-Malfoy-like hairstyle Harry could possibly imagine – a messy bun at the nape of his neck. His hair was slightly too short for it; errant locks fell around his ears and sharp jawline. Harry watched as Malfoy’s slender fingers impatiently brushed the hair away from his face – and Harry stopped thinking about it. It was as good as done already. He simply had to know.
“Where is this place?” Harry wondered in an awestruck voice as they walked down the lane.
The walk was short and pleasant enough, though he could do without being almost run over by unapologetic cyclists.  The moment the storefront’s sign came into view, Draco let the corners of his lips quirk up in a soft smile.  He loved the the little green dragons decorating the sides, and the elegant curling font of the words.  It always filled him with a sense of contentment and calm.  It was turning out to be a fairly good day after all.
“Er, Parkinson, nice to see you again,” Harry greeted her, swallowing his previous bite of food nervously.
“Hoping to speak with Albus, I take it,” Snape guessed before Harry could come up with anything decent.
“I,” said Harry feeling far more flustered than he’d ever felt in his life, “am not
After a moment, Draco huffed, leaning back into his seat with finality.  “I’m not very interesting,” he said.
“Er, are you having a fight?” Harry ventured, shoving his hands in his pockets.
“I wasn’t very nice to you or your friends in school, and I underestimated you.”  Potter pushed his glasses back up his nose, even though they hadn’t fallen in the first place.  “I was hoping to make things right with you.”
It was dim and dusty inside the shop, and there was a single customer in the back corner being tended to by the presumable Mr. Batworthy.  Harry couldn’t tell if the customer was even human or not; there was so much thick black hair coming out of its head, it was impossible to see if the thing had limbs or humanoid body parts at all.  For all he could tell, the creature was all hair.  The only way he could surmise it was actually a customer, and not some creepy wig statue, was the fact that it was swaying back and forth and babbling on in some lyrical foreign language.
With a parting grin, Connor left the shop, the bell on the door ringing behind him as it closed.  Draco smiled after him, feeling lighter for having unloaded his boy troubles onto the surprisingly understanding American, and especially after that night at the bar with Harry.  As disastrous as it had seemed, he hadn’t wanted to go home at the end of the night.  At least not without Harry coming with him.
And when did this apology mission become only about Draco?
That earned a glare from Harry as he clamped his mouth shut over any more embarrassing babbling.
The door flung open, and Harry spun around to see Marcus Flint standing in the doorway, looking wary.  He didn’t appear much different from how Harry remembered him.  He still had large, crooked teeth that made him look faintly trollish, though he’d let his coarse black hair grow out to his shoulders, and it suited him better than the short-haired look.  “Harry Potter?” the man said cautiously.  His nose looked like it had been broken more than once; it had so many twists and turns it was hard to tell if had ever been straight.
On the third floor, they exited into a much brighter hallway, and Harry followed Draco to a door labeled 309.  With a last exasperated look at Harry, Draco rapped his knuckles twice against the wood.  “Pansy, I’m sorry,” he called through the door in way of greeting, “but I’ve got a terribly stubborn Gryffindor here and he won’t leave until he speaks with you.”
“Hello, professor,” he said politely.
“And would you stop smiling?” Draco demanded, annoyed when Potter just smiled wider.  “It’s creepy.”
“Yes,” Draco said ruefully, ducking his head, “I am sorry about that.”
When they entered, Rosmerta was behind the counter, serving a very old man in bedraggled clothing.  Draco went up to greet her, and Rosmerta beamed as she caught sight of him.
“Yes, it was,” Harry whispered, feeling the shame wash over him.  He forced himself to stand up straighter and look at Hermione.  “And I need to apologize for that.”
Malfoy let out a growl of frustration, and for a moment, Harry thought Malfoy had lost all patience — he was going to punch him, or drag him outside,
“Oh hello dear,” she said in a squeaky voice that sounded as unused as the books around her.  “I’m closing up in a minute, but please look around if you like.”
Draco rolled his eyes, and Harry realized it was an action he found endearing on the other man.  “Who’s next?”
“Well, I know you better than Goy – Gregory,” Potter reasoned.  “We’ve talked.”
Hermione’s eyes went wide.  “No, Harry, it doesn’t matter, we don’t care that you’re dating Draco, we’re still your friends!”

The Headmistress was looking over some papers behind her desk (much more productively than Harry had been just minutes ago) and didn’t even glance up when he came in

Before he could reach the bottom step however, Vernon Dursley was there blocking his path, his lumpy face set in its usual grimace.
Malfoy was still glaring.  “Not long,” he ground out.
“Are you rude?” Connor asked, winking subtly again.
“Daphne Greengrass,” Draco announced decisively when Harry took too long to answer, and grabbed Potter’s arm to apparate them.  Draco wasn’t exactly thrilled to see the Greengrasses again, but they were surprisingly nice and welcoming to their guests, and from the look on Harry’s face after their encounter with the Flints, Draco decided he needed that.
“It’s not
Rosmerta strolled over to the other end of the bar to clean some glasses, waiting for the late afternoon crowd to filter in, and leaving Draco alone with a very awkward Harry Potter.  The silence felt like an itch at the back of Draco’s throat, but before he could think of anything to say, Greg came ambling over to them, and Harry turned his disconcerting grin on the unsuspecting Greg.
Scoffing at the implication, but looking entirely unaffected, Draco instead squeezed onto the couch next to Parkinson and Lavender.  The two girls seemed to be gradually twining most of their limbs together, an impressive feat, and it felt oddly intimate to watch, so Harry settled his gaze on Draco, who happened to be staring back at him.  Draco quickly averted his eyes, a hint of pink creeping onto his cheeks.  Harry felt a rush of pride at having put it there.
There wasn’t a headstone for Tom Riddle.  Perhaps if Dumbledore had still been alive, there would’ve been, but out of the few people who still remembered the boy separate from the monster he had become, none had asked for a gravestone.  Voldemort would be remembered in the pages of history, but he no longer had a place on this earth.
