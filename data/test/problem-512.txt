There were pride flags hung above the bar, not so many that you were overwhelmed by them, but enough to make it clear that this establishment was friendly to the alphabet.
Draco headed down to the potions lab and showed Harry around.  He began to help Merchant weigh out ingredients for the day’s potions while they waited for Piston to show.
There were several restaurants, Pansy’s clothing boutique, and a few other shops residing in the old warehouse.  Their club was far and away the largest and the most popular.  From the time they opened around noon, until the time they closed, they picked up traffic of all kinds.
Harry could do nothing but sit there for a moment.  All of his pain was gone but he was still baffled by Draco.  At some point, the blonde had taken self defense?
“Oh Draco, who bloody cares what other people have to say about it?”  Narcissa shook her head.  “I’d say that if you're falling in love with that boy then tell him about it.  He’s been through a lot, the poor thing.  It’s tragic really.  So if he gives you any notion that he returns your feelings then bloody well grab the bull by the horns and go for it.”  She shrugged, giving in and laughing at his absurd uncomfort at the idea of being gay.
Harry was momentarily shocked at Draco’s admission but he schooled his features and stood, walking towards the clearly embarrassed blond.  He put his hands on Draco’s desk and leaned over so their faces were close.  “Then why don’t you?” he whispered, then pressed his mouth to Draco’s.
“Pansy?  Me and Pansy?   You’re not serious!  My Merlin no!  She’s fancied Hermione since what was it year 3 when Granger sucker punched me in the face?  It takes a lot to impress Parkinson.   No.  Pug and I have been friends since childhood.  I’ve known I was gay since year six.”   Draco shook his head, still chuckling softly.
“Like hell!” Ron shouted right back.  However before he could do anything, two more members of the team grabbed him from behind and held him so he couldn’t get away.  Ron was a decent sized bloke, but he was no match for the brutes holding him.
He remembered the funny feeling in the pit of his stomach at seeing Draco's morning erection. It made him wonder what the man would have looked like if there were no clothes covering him. Just thinking about it now had Harry feeling rather warm.
“Yes Sir.  Of course, and I am honoured that you think so highly of my skills.”  Draco nodded unsure what to do with the praise.
“Nah, mum said 20 minutes.”  Draco shrugged, shuffling from one foot to another.  Now that he was standing here, he had no idea what he wanted to say or do.
“Well Potter I am the epitome of discretion when I want to be.  First of all, there was my asshole father and his bullshit expectations to deal with, second there was Voldermort to deal with.  No I'm not afraid to say it anymore.  I’m not afraid anymore.  Back then, he’d have turned me into a plaything for fenrir grayback so fast there’d have been nothing left.  Pansy and I pretended to have a relationship with each other, only to stay safe.  My father carried out marital contract negotiations with Astoria Greengrass’s parents in order to keep us all out of the darklords sights for his twisted entertainment in the evenings.”  Draco sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face and then shook his head much like Harry had, clearing away the ghosts of the past.
“Yes, Draco definitely got his head for numbers and business investments from Lucious but very little else.  By design.  All of us have sought to distance ourselves from our parents and have tried to bridge the division they caused.”  Pansy supplied squeezing Draco’s hand.  Just then there was a commotion over by the bar.  Draco glanced back and saw none other than Harry Potter and Ron Weasley being beat up by six very large and angry quidditch players.
"You know I love you like a sister," Harry said, "but why the hell did you feel the need to barge in here?"
“You don’t... what do you mean you don’t intend to do anything about it?” She spluttered nearly choking on her tea. She set the cup down and stood, hands on her hips.
The two men bid goodbye to Piston and headed upstairs. After Harry knocked on the door and heard Hermione tell them to go in, Harry opened the door and was absolutely gobsmacked to see none other than Severus Snape standing next to his friend.
“Ok cool, because this grand reopening thing is tomorrow night. So make sure Hermione gives herself the next morning off at least.” Harry called after him.
Harry's breath caught in his throat and he felt a rush of heat in his stomach. What the hell? He was ogling Draco nearly naked? What was that about?
“I’ll clean up darling.  You two better get ahead on to the Ministry.”  Narcissa stood and began clearing plates and heading into the kitchen.  “This was delightful, really Harry.  You come by anytime.”  Narcissa called.  Draco stood and smiled to himself.
"You're the only one for me, Draco Malfoy," he said then smiled. "There will be no need to go anywhere near New Mexico. I'd hate to have to curse Diggory so badly no one in the Ministry could fix him." He leaned down and brushed a soft kiss against Draco's mouth.
“I like this side of you, the jealous possessive gryffindor.  Will you spank me if I proposition your ex wife again?”  Draco asked coyly wiggling his arse against Harry in their tight embrace.
"Hmm, you naughty Slytherin," Harry murmured, turning them so Draco was on his back with Harry leaning over him. "I might. But then again, I might just on principle." He leaned down to kiss Draco again, shifting so that he fit between the blonde's legs.
"No," Harry countered. "Why don't I walk ahead so you can appreciate the view.".He stood and started walking toward the door.
“We’d best head up to see the minister, she said she wanted to see us earlier right?”  Draco asked Harry, blinking to clear his thoughts that had strayed.  Mechant had gone and Piston was cleaning her coffee pot.
“Is that so?”  Draco asked as his breath caught in his chest.  ‘Did Harry just admit to fancying him?’  He wondered to himself.  He wasn’t prepared for this turn of events.  He had been expecting rejection.  He certainly hadn’t expected to be told how handsome he was.  He shifted in his seat slightly as his eyes grew slightly wider.  Then he focused on the second half of the statement and laughed.
He’d been doing this sort of thing for the last 5 years while they got their business degrees and gathered the initial investment funds for the club space.   Blaise had selected some of the best photos from his portfolio to display around various areas of the club.  Though Draco discouraged it, he didn’t really like having his face plastered all over the place.  It made him uncomfortable.  There were plenty of more artistic shots too.  One’s that he’d done for an Lgbtq magazine in America, a copy of the article and an interview accompanying it.  And some things like that about the place as well.
“Of course, which room is your’s?  The one at the top of the stairs?  Well I’ll just call for you.”  Draco laughed and headed into the kitchen with his mother.  “Wonder if we’ll be able to find anything around here?”  He asked looking around the huge old kitchen.
“Harry…”  Draco breathed softly as his eyes fluttered open.  He ran a hand down along the brunette’s cheek and smiled, his eye’s sparkling.  He felt a strong sensation in the pit of his stomach.  Almost as though there was a line connecting him and Harry.  He blinked.  “Harry, do you see that?”  He asked softly.
Noise from the kitchen along with a rather nice smell alerted Harry that Draco was still there. Knowing he was still embarrassed, he couldn't help but tease him a bit.
Draco wasn’t.  He didn’t give a rat’s arse about having a good name or good social standing.  He proved it to himself by not socialising or associating with the old pureblood families.  He trusted Blaise to guide him in which ones were vital to have around, and whom it was safe to blow off.  Even the ones they did associate with, they did so sparingly and only in professional settings.
“I’m sorry to say so but that is definitely the real deal and not just a fake.   We need to figure out who it was and how they found you.  Harry, do you have wards against the death eaters in your house?  We should probably alert your flatmate as well.  She may want to go home to the burrow for a bit.  That place is like a fortress rumor has it.”  Draco mussed staying on the floor and looking into Harry’s eyes.  He told himself it was to keep his friend calm and didn’t think beyond that.  His brain was trying to figure out who the death eater was.
“Firewhisky it is, then.” Harry grinned, pushed Draco down into his chair, and sat on his lap.  He then proceeded to engage the blond in a deep, soul stealing kiss. Neither of them noticed Pansy who had walked up and was watching through the office door window, and they also didn’t see the smirk on her face.
Closing his eyes briefly, Harry prayed he wouldn't come too quickly. He then lined himself up and carefully pushed into his lover until he was buried to the hilt. He had to take a few breaths so he didn't lose his shit right then.
“Bet Christmas at their house this year is going to be fun.” Draco laughed to himself. He strode over to the fireplace with a cup of earl gray ready for Pansy in his hand.
“Most people are like you, they don’t realize the things they say, or the way that they say them can be harmful and derogatory.  Look at us,  we were at each other’s throats, all through school and why?  Because of my father’s bigotry, that I willingly parrotted until I learned to think for myself and felt safe enough to stand up to him.  We might have been friends otherwise.”
It had been an instant hit.  Draco went off and focused on the modeling.  Taking stock of the types of clothes each wanted shown off and animating his face and body to portray whatever emotion and mood would sell it for them.  This was old hand for him.
"Harry, I can't stop thinking about her," Ginny said miserably. "I can't eat or sleep and I almost fell off my broom in practice."
“He’s gay. The object of your obsessions since we were eleven years old has decided that he’s into guy’s and you are the most eligible bachelor around. So. What are you going to do about it?” Pansy asked again. Draco sighed.
Pansy turned to grin at Ron, Hermione, and Blaise. “See, what did I tell you? Those two are the next big power couple in the wizarding world.”
“You hurt our best player on the team!” One of the bullies shouted,  “and we are not going down this season just because you’re a fucking ponce.”  He kicked Harry in the side, eliciting an ‘oof’ sound from the brunette.
“Of course.”  Harry whispered, tilting his head for easier access.  “Although, I didn’t know I was gonna hit the fucking jackpot. Now be still.”  Draco smirked and kept silent as one of his fantasy’s ’s came true.
Harry looked around the room, memories of being there with so many lost loved ones flooding his head and tearing at his heart. He wasn't prepared for the rush of emotions and he had to will himself not to get upset or let anything show on his face.
Draco tossed the paper in the bin. The golden boy had broken up with the weaslette. She wasn’t taking it well either. She was on the cover of the last three issues ranting about homosexuals and their perversions corrupting people. So the lgbtq community in the wizarding world had clapped back at her hard. She lost her position on the holyhead harpies as lead chaser and had been relegated to warming the bench. She was seen silently fuming at every game this season.
“Blimey.” Ron chuckled as they took their place in line.  “I’ve never seen the Broomsticks with this many people waiting to get in.  Whoever owns it is gonna make a fortune.”
"Alright. Rest on the sofa and have a cup of tea while I finish my conversation with Draco about his new position. I've talked to Ginny and she's heading to the Burrow now."
“Bloody Hell Potter, why didn’t we do this before now?”  The blonde sighed happily fulfilled for the moment.  “If I’d know that it was going to be this good, I’d have propositioned you instead of Diggory.”
“Come up here, this way.  Let me have a look at you.  The lighting is better in the vip lounge upstairs.”  Blaise said as Hermione came running over.
“Yes Master Piston, Harry has a bit of a situation and he’ll be stuck with me for the foreseeable future.”  Draco explained.
Gathering himself, he cleared his throat and knocked on the edge of the door frame. "Er...Draco? It's morning."  Draco sat up blinking groggily.
Harry's breath hitched at the sight and he quickly looked away. When he dared a glance out of the corner of his eye, his cheeks heated. Draco was walking toward him with a satisfied smirk.
"For fuck sake, Potter," the blond said, nuzzling into Harry's neck. "She's got a thing for Lovegood and wants your advice."
“We’re fine mate, it’s not like that. She just thought it might be fun if we explored a little with other people, but not individually. Together. Like a third wheel or whatever. She explains it better. Sounds like fun though so I’m all for it. If it happens just once in a while after all. Hermione loves me, and I trust her. So, if she says this will be good for us, then it probably will.” Ron got back to his feet.
"Thank Merlin. I can't speak long but since you firecalled I want to tell you and Draco to come to my office after work. I believe I have a safe place for you two."
“Bloody hell Malfoy!  Kick his arse!  Ruddy Homophobes.”  Ron yelled out as he spat some blood onto the floor.  Draco dropped the fourth bloke onto the floor with his comrades and the other two held up their hands in surrender, ceasing their struggling with the bouncers restraining them.  Draco smiled.  No magic necessary.
Pulling down the front of Draco’s pants, he freed the blond’s erection then licked his lips. The skin was just as pale as the rest of Draco’s body, all except for the tip, which was flushed a pretty pink.
“That’s it,” Hermione told him. “That envelope was not a prank, and now you need to be protected, whether you like it or not.”  Hermione was saying to Harry.
“Yes, quite right.  I’ve been keeping tabs on you young man and I can honestly say that I am both pleasantly surprised and impressed.  However did you manage this level of success?”
The rest of the afternoon went by quickly. They stayed busy and only had to deal with a little light teasing from Merchant and Piston about their little display earlier. Harry took it in stride. Even though this new threat loomed over him, he was surprisingly in a good mood.
“I mean just that. I do not intend to do anything about it. It’s none of my business if Potter wants to get his arse stuffed. I’ve moved on from that. You should too. Besides. I’m quite certain that I’m the last person he’d want to see right now.”
Both Muggle and Wizarding press were invited.  Draco wasn’t too sure how that would go down.  As the wizarding press would go gaga for people that the muggle press had no clue about and vise versa.  The blonde sat down on a leather couch that ran along the wall opposite the large desk.  It looked exactly the same as Draco’s office.  They’d gotten a discount on buying in bulk.  So there were leather couches strewn all around the various levels of the club.  It was an old warehouse that had been carved up into commercial real estate space.
“Sweet! I’ll tell Hermione, she’s been dying to check that place out! She’s the one who granted their permits. It’s all on the up and up she says. Wouldn’t tell me who owns the place though.” Ron shrugged.
“That sounds great.  I don't usually drink, it tends to bloat me.  So as long as I don’t have any shoots the next couple days, I can definitely imbibe a little firewhisky.  I love the way it burns.”  Draco murmured as he tucked himself away and smoothed his shirt and vest back into his trousers.
"Yes, it's hard, but I'm coping," Harry said with a soft smile. "It's been a strange couple of days, way out of my normal routine, but I do my best to adapt and deal with it the best I can. Today has been one of the best days I've had in a long time and I've come to realize a few things about myself I never knew before." He paused, letting go of Draco's hands, and took a deep breath.
“Yes.  I was referring to my relatives.  They starved me and kept me in the cupboard under the stairs.  They used me as their slave, practically.  Until I went to Hogwarts. When they found out I knew magic, they were still strict but not quite as bad.  They were terrified of Hagrid and Dumbledore. Anyway, I don’t think I need to elaborate.” He shook his head, as if trying to shake off the bad memories.
He headed downstairs to head off with Ron and Hermione. They were dressed nicely and seemed excited to see what the new place had in store. The Three Broomsticks was well and good, but Dragon Heart seemed to have an air of mystery about it. Just the name itself was intriguing. After the normal pleasantries were exchanged, they headed out.
“And I promise never to tell what that is.”  She winked.  “Draco this is Helga Hawthorn from Witch Weekly.  This is Sylvester Penoir who owns the Daily Prophet.”  Draco shook hands with them.
“I’ll say.”  Harry agreed.  “It’s probably some old rich wizard with too much time on his hands.”  The two friends snickered and were instantly hushed by Hermione with just a look. They behaved the rest of the time they were in line.
It had been a hellish few years for him.  Though he kept those donations anonymous.  The charities had reached out trying to figure out who was responsible so they could properly thank him.  Draco refused.  The last thing he wanted or needed was any more civil service awards cluttering up the palace.  He already had scads of those from the muggle charities.  The wizarding world would just construe it and malign his intentions as trying to buy off his fathers name and reestablish himself in society.
"Er...yes… I mean NO! Bollocks!" Ginny stammered. "I mean… I'm off to Luna's...er...bye!" She left the room as fast as she could, slamming the door behind her. Draco burst into laughter.
“Excellent thinking my boy.  I always knew you had better instincts than your father.”  Narcissa smiled wryly and glanced at the stairs.
The next Saturday morning, Harry and Draco were having a nice lie in, happy they didn't have to go into work. After the commotion of the past week, things had finally calmed a bit so the two men were enjoying the down time.
“Just auror training.” The redhead shrugged. “Kingsley was wondering if you were gonna come back? He doesn’t care if you're bent. You certainly aren't’ the first in the auror corp.”
"Yes, now that you three have opened it up, it will remain open until the high king closes it.  Come on, there's much to discuss."  Sirius reiterated.   Draco shared a look with Harry and Severus.
“Excellent. So, are you still doing that backroom special?” Pansy asked pointedly. Draco narrowed his eyes.
“Good. I expect free pass’s when you decide to move forward with this. Six will do, since it was my idea after all.”
With the same slow movement, Harry leaned his head toward Draco's, tilting it and closing his eyes. Gently, Harry pressed his lips to Draco's and warmth like he'd never felt before bloomed in his chest and stomach.
Doing what he did best, Harry steeled his nerves and got out of bed. He really wanted a shower but had nothing to change into. Figuring he'd ask Draco about it, he pulled on his shoes and tiptoed across the hall. Draco's door was open and the sight that greeted Harry surprised him. He knew he needed to look away and knock but he couldn't.
Heat exploded in Harry’s gut as Draco opened his mouth to receive his questing tongue.  Yes!  This was what he’d been needing and wanting for so long.  He tried to be gentle, to savor the moment, but he just couldn’t.  He held the blond’s face in his hands and kissed and explored every inch of that hot, sweet mouth.
In one swift move, Harry switched their positions and sucked in Draco's cock as far as he could then pulled back off. " We can talk about this later, " he said. "Right now, in this moment," he licked the reddened head of Draco's prick, " I want hard and muscle and to have you come so much in my mouth that I can't hold it all." He went back to work, sucking fast and hard, his hand finding the soft bollocks below.
“Did you ever think we’d be doing this? Having an actual conversation without fighting?”  Harry asked, amused.
“I am a ponce who makes his living based on his good looks.  Of course I know how to defend myself.  I’m a black belt.  Now this kind of attitude is exactly what caused your chaser to get herself benched.  You should think long and hard about that.  How far did this sort of bigotry get Voldemort?   Not bloody far did it?  You’re no better than him spewing that shit.  Now get out of here and if I ever see your faces in here again I won’t just knock your friends out if you provoke me.”  Draco sneered as the aurors under the guise of cops escorted the troublemakers out.  Blaise was there in a flash picking Ron up from the floor.
"I'll contact Ginny," Hermione said, standing and going to the fire. She didn't want to send an owl just in case Harry's flat was being watched.
“You feel so good around me.”  Draco murmured.  His lips sought Harry’s as he leaned over the brunette and kissed him with every ounce of heat and passion he felt at that moment.  Draco fell silent as he slammed into Harry repeatedly.  Papers and folders and books went flying everywhere as the desk rocked with the force of the activity of the two men.
They kept walking toward the bar at the back of the club and, the further they went, the more risque the photos of Draco were. As a matter of fact, behind the bar itself was a large, black and white photo of Draco against a black background, fully nude with only his hands covering his bits. Ron gasped and clapped a hand over his eyes.
“Come on, we better head to the lunchroom or the lines will be murder.”  Draco stated smirking at the other man.  “I’ll be sure to walk ahead so you can appreciate the view.”  He tossed casually over his shoulder.  He headed for the door as the two old women snickered in the corner.
Harry, stunned at witnessing Draco kick some serious ass, held his ribs as he struggled to his feet.  His cheek was bruising, he had a busted lip, and he was sure there was some damage to his ribs, but all of that didn’t matter at the moment.  All he could register was that Draco Malfoy probably just saved his life.
“Fuck I’m never gonna last.  This is too good, too much of a dream come true.”  The blonde murmured as his thrusts became less paced and more erratic.  After just a few more minutes, he tensed up and filled Harry with his seed.
"No," Ginny pouted. "I'm afraid to. What if she laughs in my face or something?" She seemed oblivious to Draco's activities.
Draco slowly stilled his movements and collapsed against Harry, letting the shorter man hold him for a moment.
“Ah that’s cool mate.” Ron finished his breakfast and stood to head to the floo when an unfamiliar brown owl flew in the window. Ron paused after putting on his red auror training robes and came to see what it was about. Harry took the thick envelope from the bird who pecked his finger as he dropped some treats for it.
Draco, breathing hard, wiggled his ass to try to get Harry to move. After just a moment, the dark haired man began a slow rhythm, trying to make the sensations last as long as he could. It was bliss. Draco was hot and tight, everything Harry imagined he would be.
“Yes that’s correct.  The other potions assistant doesn’t have the necessary skill unfortunately.  However, there is a substantial increase not just in salary but in the amount of paperwork and budgeting that is required.  You’re expected to try and attract new potions accounts, track down ingredients supplies and maintain the current potions accounts.  The ministry relies heavily on those potions.  If this goes well, we may be able to assign another student assistant to help.”  Hermione explained the details clearly and concisely as Draco had come to expect.  He nodded and sipped the tea that Hermione had given him before Harry had burst in.
“No not much.  They’re not allowed to make a person's life more difficult because of it.  For instance, they’re not legally allowed to deny a person a job, place of residence, or target people based on their sexual preferences.  However, there’s no law stopping people from beating up every nancy boy they come across who is foolish enough to be out alone.  There’s no law preventing employers from creating a hostile work environment to get you to quit because they know you’re a ponce and don't want you there." Draco paused, lost in his thoughts for a moment.
"Don't you worry about this nasty business with the dark lord.   There's nothing the stragglers can throw at us that my Draco can't handle."  She stated with a certainty as she smiled at Harry sipping his tea.
Plus, if they could help to bring some unity to the community, by way of trying to make up for the division and devastation that their fathers had caused, then all the better.  Draco privately had donated a large portion of his earnings to several charities, two muggle organizations for at risk youth, and one for lgbtq rights and litigation that worked both in muggle and the wizarding world.  Then he donated to two more wizarding charities to make up his own peace of mind about the dark mark.  Even though he hadn’t really done anything as a death eater.  He'd only taken the mark months before the end, thanks to the lose-lose situation that Potter had created for him by getting his father arrested at the ministry of magic over that whole prophecy fiasco.  It hadn’t taken the dark lord long to want Draco to suffer in his fathers place.
Admittedly, Harry thought Draco was good looking. And this morning, when he saw Draco in his boxers and sleeping, he wanted to stand there and stare until Draco woke up on his own.
“Ah that’s an easy one.  I owe it mostly to a desire to understand the things that had been kept from me by my father, and the two best friends a bloke could ask for.   Pansy is beautiful, that much is without question but don't let her pretty face fool you.  She's a shrewd business woman.  Anyone would be lucky to find her in their corner.”  Draco gestured around to the club and the elevator that led to the upper floors.
Harry drew in a sharp breath as Draco found what he was reaching for and started teasing lightly with a fingertip.
“Draco darling!”  She exclaimed, surprised.  “What are you doing?  You should be asleep.”  She said. Draco just nodded and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Potions is a delicate art that requires much patience.  You were a receptive student.”  Snape shrugged stating what he believed was an obvious fact and sounding bored at having to point out the obvious.
Howdy! We're back again! Hope ya'll liked the first chapter. I'm gonna do my best to post every day :)
“Of course.  The child should not have had to suffer undeservedly.  He’s quite intelectual your son.”  The somber man stated and turned towards the stairs.  “Mr. Potter, might you have Kreacher bring the books to my room?”  He asked looking up the stairs towards the second floor landing.
Kreacher nodded, his eyes huge. The last thing he wanted was to be freed. Grimmauld was the only place he'd ever known.
“Draco, you can’t be serious! This is Potter we’re talking about. If you don’t snap him up, then someone else will. Forgive me for wanting my best friend to have the best.” Pansy huffed then sat back down and resumed sipping her tea in silent fury. The blonde slytherin just rolled his eyes and shook his head.
“You alright there Potter?”  Draco asked nonchalantly with a knowing grin as he headed into the cafeteria.
"I had Ginny pack your things, Harry, and bring them here. I had Narcissa do the same for you, Draco, and then sent her along with everyone's belongings to Grimmauld," Hermione continued. The fire in Grimmauld's sitting room is warded so you can only floo into the Ministry through my fire. Same with firecalling. Now, Harry, do you have an answer for Severus?"
Both men were still sleeping when, with a loud bang, the door opened. Ginny walked right in and plopped down on the edge of the bed next to Harry. She shook his arm.
“It’s always so much harder to hurt them when they tell me I’m pretty.”  Draco shook his head as he pulled his hands into the monkey fist pose and took a haiko daiji stance.  He swiped one bloke across the face and spun around in a back kick and used the momentum of his body to carry his weight through to land a kick to the other dudes face.  Both hit the ground and Draco ducked and landed two quick blows to the throat and chest of the third guy that had broken loose from one of the bouncers.
Draco shined his shoes and buttoned his cufflinks and floo’d to his office, he opened his door and walked across the hall to Blaise’s office.  Opening the door he poked his head in.  Blaise waved him in, but held up a hand for quiet as he was on the phone with the press arranging for the last minute publicity of tonight's event.
“A lovely young man was sucking my cock.  A handsome brunette on his knees worshiping me.”  Draco murmured against Harry’s ear.  He nipped at the soft flesh lightly and pulled away exiting the lift as though nothing at all had occurred.
"I know you're wondering why Draco and I are so amiable. He apologized for his wrongdoings in school and I've forgiven him."
“Harry Potter has been attacked, actually he’s being stalked and harassed for weeks now and the git didn’t bother telling anyone.”  Draco shook his head looking frustrated.  Narcissa sank into a chair across from him looking pale and her forehead creased with worry.
“Don’t worry Harry.  We were stupid kids.  You’re mine now and you’d better not be planning on ditching me anytime soon.  I’ll have to go see if Diggory really is a vampire in new mexico.  I’ll sick him on you for breaking my heart.”  The blonde giggled.
“You’re right.  This was not your fault.  This was them, and their bigotry, taking a cheap shot at an easy target.  We’re trying to educate people.  I started to do interviews and the activist stuff,  just trying to let people see that we’re just like them.  We’re not any different.  I mean, we all bleed red and piss yellow.”  Draco shrugged.  Hermione smiled.
“Have you eaten?  I could fix us sandwiches.”  Draco offered stifling a yawn.  Narcissa shook her head.
“You may be the only friend who counts darling but I do have a plethora of contacts. I’m trying to make a good impression on the editor of witch weekly so she’ll feature my clothing line in her magazine and I have a few other elbows to grease. Your club would be the exact right place for it.” She shrugged. The blonde grinned then pulled an envelope out of the breast pocket of his suit coat and handed it to her. She squealed with delight then kissed him on the cheek.
“There isn’t much known about such things however your godfather Mr. Black was in possession of a very rare set of three books that detailed everything that is known about the fae realm.  I do hope given the present circumstances that you will allow me to come to Grimmauld place and read through them.”  He stated in his bored tone.
"I mean yeah, if you can prove that’s what’s happened, then they can prosecute wrongful termination and wages but you have to be able to prove it and most of the time they’re very careful not to leave evidence.  There’s no way to force people to be decent to each other, unfortunately.”  Draco sighed and went to the small well stocked sidebar and poured two fingers of Firewhisky into two tumblers.  A third he fixed as a vodka cranberry and levitated the whiskeys to Harry and Ron while Hermione gratefully accepted the vodka cranberry.  Draco got himself a bottle of water and sat at his desk after taking a single shot of whisky.
“I’m really proud of you Draco.  You’ve really come a long way since Hogwarts.”  Hermione said warmly.  “Thank you for saving these two for me.”  She added.
At first, his friends couldn’t understand why he’d want to mark himself, but he explained to them how each one held meaning and helped him to heal. Then they understood.  Ron had even gone and gotten a magical portrait of Fred.  The tattoo Fred ever as mischievous as the real Fred had been was often seen peeking out of the collar of Ron’s shirts, pinching his brother in the neck whenever he had something to say, or whispering in his ear.
"All I really know about this thing is that Sirius showed it to me right before fifth year," Harry told Snape. "There wasn't much time for him to go into detail because of the Order meetings. Then, later that year…" he trailed off, not wanting to relive seeing his godfather pass through the veil again.
He unbuttoned the vest and let it flutter to the ground next as his mouth returned to capture Harry’s.  Draco’s hand deftly worked open the leather belt and black slacks the other man was wearing.  He grinned when he realized Harry wasn’t wearing any pants.
“One other thing you should know, mother, I brought Harry here.”  Draco added, embarrassed for some reason.  “It’s the last place on earth they’ll think to look for him.”  He rushed on by way of explanation.
Harry moved Draco's hand, which was inching slowly downwards under the blankets, and gave his friend a confused look.
“You’re fucking sexy.”  The blonde groaned thrusting his hips into Harry’s mouth a tiny bit.  He did that twice before he pulled the brunette to his feet and picked him up.  Harry’s legs automatically wrapped around his hips as Draco slammed him down onto the desk on his back.  Staring into the bottomless pools of harlequin green that were Harry’s eyes.  He reached one hand between them and groaned as he felt the plug Harry was wearing.
“Her timing is impeccable.  I half wonder if she has a sixth sense about when I’m about to get my jolly’s?”  He grumbled sitting up to wrap his arms around Harry’s neck.  “Hold that thought, love.  You know she’ll just barge in here if we ignore her.”  Draco sighed.
“This isn’t any of your concern.  We don’t have any quarrel with you yah fancy ponce!  I’d hate to mess up that pretty face of yours.”
"Good morning Harry dear.  I do hope you slept well after your ordeal."  She said as she offered Harry a cup of coffee or tea.  Draco came into the room then and kissed his mother on the cheek.
The trio apparated just around the corner from Dragon Heart, and when the entrance came into view, they were surprised to see just how many people were lined up to enter, excitedly chattering while waiting for their turn to gain entrance.
"Yes, you should," Harry said quickly, trying to ignore how fucking fantastic Draco's mouth felt on him.
Draco was having none of that slow shit. He wanted hard and fast. He pulled himself forward and pushed himself back, hard. Harry groaned loudly and finally took the hint. Grabbing Draco's hips, he picked up the pace, fucking his lover as hard as he dared.
Some of the other patrons realized there was a fight going on and they gathered around to watch. The words ‘Potter’ and ‘Weasley’ and ‘Harpies’ could be picked out of the excited chatter going on.
“Mmm.” Draco pulled his mouth off of Harry with a little pop sound.  “I know this is all new and exciting and wonderful to you right now, but Harry.  You’re bisexual.  At some point, you’ll miss burying yourself in a woman, playing with their soft bits.  I’m just letting you know that it’s fine with me if you want to add a woman every once in a while.  I don’t mind it myself though, I obviously prefer roosters to hens.”  He explained as he resumed his attention to the stiff prick in his face.
“Nah mate. You know I haven’t had time. What with Ginny not taking it very well and all, I’ve been laying pretty low.” Harry supplied. “Why would they be contacting me for anything?” He wondered aloud.
“Course I did.  You don’t really think it was voldemort and my father’s abuse that had me crying to Myrtle do you?”  Draco snuggled into Harry’s embrace.
Hermione and Ron got to their feet as Pansy herself appeared in the doorway to Draco’s office.  She tossed a jacket to Draco who caught it with one hand.
If people understood muggles better, then it’d be much harder to look down on them.  After all, the muggles had to work much harder to achieve some of the same things that were easy for the wizarding world.  Which meant, they were twice as industrious as most wizards.  Hardly something to look down on.  And so.  The plan was launched, enacted and had netted great success.  Much more so than the three of them had ever planned for but Blaise was excellent at thinking on his feet and had really stepped up to lead them to where they now stood.  Draco had no idea how the man kept everything straight but he did.  Draco kept the books, and inventory, Blaise handled everything else.  Pansy handled her fashion business and dressed Blaise and him whenever they were going to be in front of the press.
Draco ran a brush through his medium length blonde locks, He ran just a touch of mouse into it, enough to keep it out of his eyes but not enough to keep it solid and crunchy or make it look greasy.  He pulled on the sleek black suit coat that pansy had sent over to him that morning.  It had a bow on it that read ‘for you darling.  The owner must look his best at his grand reopening.’  He’d rolled his eyes but had set it out on his dressing rack to be pressed and steamed and made ready for the evening.
Harry didn't need to be told twice. He moved behind his lover, took his prick in hand, and tapped it against the hole already stretched and waiting for him.
“Listen to this Ron. Mr. Potter, we are very sorry to hear about the unfortunate split with your school sweetheart. Please accept these passes to our grand reopening of Dragon Heart, the all inclusive club with the new alphabet mafia vip club upstairs. Now expanded to include all of the letters in the lgbtq. In these times of confusion and division, all of us in the alphabet mafia, be they l or g or t or any of the other letters, should stick together and pave the way to a better, more unified wizarding world. Don’t you agree? Please bring whoever you like and enjoy a fun night out and meet some new interesting people, and enjoy yourself and our services.” Harry read off the note. He flashed three vip passes to the trendy new club.
They hurriedly dressed and headed down to eat the meal knowing there was no way out of it.  Snape had a few questions about Sirius’s records and the tapestry.  He’d found several references to it in the books.  Grudgingly the two men followed Snape into Sirius' old den and starred at the Black family tapestry.
Hey y'all! There's a couple more chapters ready to post, so I'll be quicker. Hope you're enjoying our little fic :)
Draco sat in his study reading through his father's old logs until he was bleary eyed.  He hadn’t seen anything unusual or useful yet.  He was determined to get to the bottom of it.  Something in his gut told him that he absolutely had to protect Harry Potter.  The blonde couldn’t make sense of it, but if it put an end to all this, he’d do anything.  Just then the floo flared and his mother stepped out.
A few days passed quietly as Harry spent his free time writing whenever he wasn’t at work in the potions lab with Draco.  Draco and Harry had moved Draco’s stuff into Harry’s room as the two had no interest in sleeping separately.
"Although," Harry mumbled only for Draco to hear, "after what I saw this morning, I would be the one choking."
“Hey Harry, any plans today?” Ron asked as he came down to the dining room and poured himself a cup of coffee.
“I think that I have a crush on Harry Potter.”  Draco frowned severely, hacking at the skin of the potato trying to work out his nerves.
“I knew you’d come around when I suggested it last month.” She laughed getting to her feet. “Ta darling. I’ll see you there.” She grinned and disappeared into the fireplace to her office. Draco shook his head and called Blaise to go over business.
Their work was so efficient that by lunchtime, enough ingredients had been prepared to start on enough potions to last almost a week.
“Have you heard from Andromeda at all?  I… we were talking about my family the other day, we wondered if she’d like to come visit my parent’s graves.  They’re buried in the distant back corner of the yard.  This was their house. I suppose she might still be upset with me, for choosing Bella over her in this whole fiasco.”  Narcissa shook her head looking somewhat distant. “I can’t excuse my actions, being so shortsighted, but Bellatrix was so young you know, I felt responsible for her.  Though, I’m not sure what that says about me given how she turned out.”  Narcissa stated and looked truly worn.  She sipped her tea quietly lost in thought.
They’d been right of course, and just like that, Pansy had weaseled her way into every muggle high fashion magazine. Simply by dressing Draco for his private functions.  That 9 out of 10 times,  Blaise arranged, organized and catered.  Paving the way for them to build their bar.
Seating himself in a rather comfortable chair at the kitchen table, Harry waited for the rest of the house to rise.  Narcissa came downstairs and smiled warmly at Harry.
He and Blaise together had gotten all the necessary permits and licensing required to own and operate a nightclub in both muggle and wizarding laws.  They were covered and up to regulation on both accounts.  There were a couple wizards only areas, the entrance to one was in what would appear to muggles as a simple cloak room.  Another entry from what looked to a muggle like a bathroom.
“So wait, someone just sent you vip passes for tonight?  Did it say who?”  Draco asked looking at Harry as the wheels clicked in his head.
“Yeah, this isn’t too bad.  I can heal this no problem.”  Draco went to his desk and pulled out his wand from a lock box in the top drawer.  Hermione stood to the side as Draco scanned and diagnosed, then healed Ron and Harry.
"I have wards on the flat and Grimmauld Place," Harry told Draco then dropped his face into his hands. He couldn't believe this shit was happening to him again. Draco nodded and narrowed his eyes deep in thought.
Harry sucked and licked, letting Draco take what he needed. He brought a finger up to his mouth, getting it nice and wet, then reached down to stroke Draco's hole.
“Ginny’ll get the hell over herself. Just give her some time. The rest of us love you anyways. You’re still family bro. Charlie is gay and we didn’t kick him out. We’re definitely keeping you. Like it or not. They probably read about your preferences in the paper like everyone else and figured they’d make a good impression. Perks of being famous Harry. Take the good along with the bad.” Ron shrugged sitting back down.
True to his word, Draco had clothes waiting for Harry when he returned to the borrowed room. Dressing quickly, Harry slipped his shoes on and wandered downstairs. All of the rooms had only the furniture necessary to be functional, nothing like Harry thought there would be. However, it looked homey to him.
“Well I just think it’s sexist is all. If you’re going to have a members only sex club you could at least open it up to women as well. Lesbians like to party too you know. We deserve a place to play just like the boys do. With the bigger portion of the wizarding world thinking like the weaselette, we ought to stick together, hold each other up. Otherwise we’ll all go down.” Pansy shrugged. Draco was silent mulling it over. He’d been thinking about it himself recently.
The four men continued to take turns hitting and kicking Harry, all the while spitting insults and slurs at him.  Ron continued to struggle against the two holding him but to no avail, so he did the next best thing: he started calling for help.
“Who hasn’t?” He laughed as she took the offered cup of tea and sat herself down kicking her shoes off and stretching her feet up onto the footstool near her favorite chair.
Hal shrugged. “I suppose it wasn’t a coincidence that he was possessed by Voldemort, who already failed to kill me once. Not that this particular event has been clarified.”
“He hates all Gryffindors.” Hal insisted. “And me in particular. I told you how he picked on me all of our first lesson. I’m not crazy, right?” He turned to Ron and Hermione for back up, and they both nodded and gave other examples.
“Severus, what have you been teaching them?” Lockhart said contritely, turning to Snape, who admirably kept his face neutral and did nothing in way of murdering his colleague. “You don’t discuss a duel! You act!”
Marge’s eyes went wide, but he added with determination. “Leave my brother alone. And just, like, leave.”
Ley whooped, slapping him on the back proudly – it was sports, he didn’t care what the game was or if he understood it at all, being part of the team was enough to be one of the popular kids in any school, magical or not – and his aunt smiled.
Ron grabbed him in an awkward one-arm hug. “She’ll be okay.” He said in a tone that clearly told he was also trying to convince himself. “She’ll be okay.”
He wouldn’t have thought much of it, if that had been the end of it. But similar occurrences seemed to keep happening from that point. Draco would find things not where he’d left them – and call him slightly compulsive, but he tended to be careful and know exactly where he left things – and he started feeling like there was gaps in his days where he couldn’t remember what he’d been doing.
“It’s just a cruel prank.” Neville reasoned. “Even if Filch thinks you might have done it, it doesn’t mean he thinks you’re a killer.”
Hal did just that for a long few minutes. Neville angled his head to look out the window, giving him time and space. Eventually Hal felt himself calm down, and as he let out a big sigh, the other boy turned back to him.
“Yeah.” Ron snorted. “You were too busy lecturing Parvati about how nobody knows what a Boggart looks like when they’re alone.”
“Meanwhile.” Draco carried on. “There is a large three-headed dog in our school, so unless they take it out as entertainment for the Halloween feast, we have a mystery to solve, don’t we?
When Draco came to, he thought he was still asleep for a moment, dreaming no doubt. His mother was sitting by his bedside, having a chat and
“Alright, how about this.” Pan grinned. “If Hal catches the Snitch, you have to tell him how you feel.”
“He won’t be happy here.” Hal delivered the final blow. “Think how much happier he would be running and flying free with some friends.”
“Hey, by the way.” Anthony intervened. “We figured out the Basilisk based on how you freaked out about snakes. But how did you guess the entrance was there? Was it the inscription? I thought that was a bit on the nose to leave it there, actually.”
Hal turned around, coming face to face with two older Hufflepuff boys – seventh year, he’d say, though he wouldn’t have put money on it. He certainly did not know their names.
“Problem, Potter?” He scorned. “Something that didn’t get through that thick skull of yours properly, earlier?”
“Honestly, for a would-be Death Eater, he’s really a rubbish one.” Ron had confessed to him, his face twisted like he almost wanted to laugh about it, but it was a bit too soon to move past the discomfort yet.
“Ninety-six.” Anthony shrugged. “Don’t let that fool you, he’s as sharp as a hippogriff’s beak. Anyway, we asked him what creature he thought could petrify people, animals and ghosts, but he’d never heard of anything like that. He thought maybe something related to a Gorgon, but he didn’t think it fit the profile. Then there’s animals with venoms with a paralytic effect, but he said they wouldn’t be rigid like that, nor, well, alive.” He winced. “If it was something like that, the heart muscles would have been reached eventually too, and they’d be dead. Unless it’s combined with a stasis spell or something like that, but then we’re back to why we ruled out curses and potions in the first place: Dumbledore or Snape would have found an antidote by now.”
In the end, Ron’s dad managed to extract him – and the rest of his charges – from the shop, and ushered them to a quieter spot (all relatively, because the entire Alley was bustling). He announced they’d come back for their books when the signing was over, for those who didn’t have everything yet, that maybe then they’d be able to see where they were walking.
“Harry Potter.” The flat face spoke in that same hissing voice that has sounded before, and ew, gross, gross, gross, was all Hal could think, because it truly was even worse when that thing moved.
“Got kicked out of home earlier.” Pan announced right away. “Found out you lived nearby so I thought I’d… say hi.” He finished, not gathering the courage to admit the next words should have been
Petunia firmly refused to let him miss transport to school a second time, and even Hal had to admit it was wise not to skip the first day of classes, so he obediently prepared to get on a train at the crack of dawn. They’d booked him a connection for Charing Cross station, so he only had a short walk from there. His aunt still wasn’t very happy about it, leaving a 12 year-old make a two-hour journey into London on his own with a large trunk and a cat, but she had to go to work and take care of Ley, and Hal had promised her he’d be careful, and stay safe and not speak to strangers and all that, he’d just sit on the train and go straight to the pub, and he’d be alright and ring when he got there.
But he’d thought that was it – obviously, he hadn’t known his parents were part of two different worlds. He’d also never thought of the other bank account as
to sign something, take his picture and ask if he was excited to have Lockhart as a teach next year.
“He’s my mother’s cousin.” He informed him. “Sirius Black. Actually, I mentioned him before, he’s the one who got burnt off the tapestry for being a Gryffindor. He was best friends with James, I think he actually spent the summers at the Potters since his own parents didn’t want anything to do with him anymore.”
Notwithstanding the dark cold spell the Dementor’s presence had provoked, it had been a pleasantly warm day, and when they were told they would be a slight delay with the first years (two entire boats had toppled, apparently, following a too enthusiastic girl wanting to show off a spell she’d just learnt on her brand new wand, and sending seven students into the lake), a lot of the older years decided to hang outside, enjoying the last few rays of sunshine before heading into the Great Hall for the Sorting and the feast.
“He’s always a bit cosy with this other guy on the team.” Hal explained. “I think it’s only because he knows Oliver likes him, but it doesn’t seem to bother him either, so I was just wondering.”
September had flown by, and had been thoroughly exhausting. Hal was having to contend with the facts that he had fans now, not just people excited to see him in the street, but proper
The pain did fade after a couple of minutes, though he was left feeling nauseous. And a little paranoid – after Snape, it was a bit much to think
, mighty Morgana. He was several inches taller, maybe even taller than Draco now, and he was all tanned from playing outdoors (no doubt a lot more than Draco had, but then with his skin, it was ill-advised. He just
It was broken off by Professor Flitwick when Oliver and Marcus Flint, somehow, came to physical blows, by which time Douglas had quit the team and announced he hoped they would all burn in hell. Both Snape and McGonagall swooped in, took off house points where deserved, and Snape shepherded the Slytherins away.
“It’s not.” Draco countered. “I-” He took a breath, and released it with his next words. “I like boys.”
They were lounging in the Goldsteins’ back garden, enjoying the August sun – it had been raining for the past few days, and now was finally nice and warm for a change – and watching over Esther playing with all sorts of colourful contraptions (Muggle toys, and perfectly harmless, Anthony had insisted).
“We think she is.” Gabriel smiled fondly at his little daughter. “There’s been a few occurrences of what may or may not have been accidental magic, but it’s still hard to tell. We’ve put her in Wizarding daycare, just to be on the safe side.”
The same thing happened again, and Draco found himself holding his breath as he waited for the response to appear.
“He thinks I did it.” Hal insisted, because the bottom line was the same. “He’s convinced- how would I even- fuck,
“Dumbledore is away.” Hal lifted his fingers to count off what he clearly didn’t think were coincidences. “Snape can’t be found. And he just tried to murder me again.”
With that he artfully managed to take both sides and neither, Hal noticed. There was something very aristocratic about that – then again, he supposed the Malfoys
“I didn’t write a book, though.” Hal added to defuse the situation. “I’m obviously not nearly as cool as Newt Scamander.”
“You’re not asking, we are.” Gabriel’s voice intervened behind them, before Anthony could do more than open his mouth (presumably to react to the fact that
“Am I?” Hal wasn’t sure how to take the compliment – Draco had been flying shoulder to shoulder with him a lot of the time as they searched for the snitch, so he hadn’t thought much of it, and he didn’t have much more of a point of comparison.
Hal knew he had a fund that had been set up when he was born, that some of that money was going to his aunt for bringing him up, and that he had a sum waiting for him when he came of age. He didn’t know how much, just that his parents had been good at managing money and planning for the future, as it had turned out.
“That hair.” Hal's aunt whispered with a little laugh, though it was one tainted with sadness. “It was always so beautiful. I was rather jealous of it.”
, Hermione. I want to play Quidditch and be a dick with my cousin and my friends, I don’t want to be expected to save the world.”
I was one of the realisations he had come to when speaking to Tom – the boy in the diary, as it had turned out to be. He had been right about that, it was a bit like a portrait. Tom had lived a long time ago, long enough that the name Harry Potter, when Draco had mentioned it, hadn’t seemed to ring a bell.
“Well, Lucius Malfoy is dead.” Hal said. Sirius showed no sign that he had or hadn’t already known. “And Draco is really great. And his mom is nice, so maybe give her another chance. She’s friends with my aunt.”
Draco couldn’t believe Hal had actually made the Quidditch team. Ron had warned them his brothers could be very persuasive, but there had not been a first-year student playing in a house team for over a hundred years, not since one apparently died (though Draco was pretty sure this was a school legend).
So he made it his strategy to approach the Slytherins first years every now and again in the following couple of days. His friends found it odd, but it would look less suspicious this way than if he simply started following Pansy and the others around during the holiday. He just shrugged it off and argued he’d known them for years, and there was no reason he shouldn’t stay friendly.
As the rest of the Hall erupted in various degrees of panic and bewilderment – how had the beast been able to get in? – Hal and his friends turned to each other in immediate understanding. Lupin. Whatever he usually did to get himself out of the way during the full moon, clearly this time something hadn’t gone to plan.
“So what exactly happened before?” Anthony asked, in spite of himself interested in the story even though Blaise was telling it. “I mean, obviously they sorted it out at the time, right?”
“Hooch is good at first aid.” Ron tried to sound reassuring. “She’ll know what to do while waiting for Pomfrey, and she’ll set him right. He’ll be alright.”
-	Endgame is Drarry, so I tagged it + they do have a relationship as friends, but in this first book, well, they’re 11-12 years old, so not much slash will be happening. Other relationships will be tagged as they develop in the next parts.
“Right.” Ron cleared his throat. “No. Of course. You’re right. Sorry, big family, I’m used to the squabbling.”
On top of everything, with Quidditch practice kicking in and the arrangement of their classes this year, Hal barely got a chance to spend time with Anthony and Draco, and he missed his friends and the easy dynamics they’d had the previous year. Those dynamics had changed a bit anyway with the addition of Pansy, though Hal didn’t mind her. She was mean, but quite funny a lot of the time, and Hal thought she was using insults to cover up some serious insecurities, so he was willing to let her protect herself that way until she felt more confident and trustful around them.
Thanks to Ron, Hal went into the game feeling rather confident, and the match started great – the weather was fair, the team was pumped up, the crowd going mad for Hal whizzing about on his fancy broomstick. Within fifteen minutes, Gryffindor was already in the lead by three goals.
After fifteen minutes or so, their gawpers were joined by a man and a boy maybe a couple years younger than Hal and Ley were.
, what the hell, and put a hand in his pocket. Mirror-Hal pulled out a blood red stone, rubbed his thumb against it, put it back. Real-Hal then felt the small weight and bulge of it in his pocket, and realised he now had what the other wanted.
“My parents have stopped sending Howlers, if that’s what you mean.” Pan answered. “I think they’ve given up on me.”
work collection, signed!” Lockhart finished with a flourish, dumping a huge pile of books into Hal’s arms (whose legs nearly buckled under the sudden weight) and grabbing his shoulders again to angle him towards the photographer.
“Keep him away from Scabbers.” Ron eyed him suspiciously. “He’s lame enough without risking to die of a heart attack or something.”
In spite of how drained he had felt, Hal had had a fretful night, and he felt like he’d only finally gotten off to sleep when it was already getting light outside. By the time he woke up again, it was the middle of the day – going by the sunlight through the windows – and his aunt was by his bedside. She lit up when he stirred.
“You’re related to Newt Scamander.” Hermione actually jumped up and down. “Not by blood, I know, but your second cousin is his actual grandson. This is so cool.”
This time there was a longer pause. Draco hadn’t meant to sound accusatory, but he didn’t understand why Tom hadn’t said anything.
What followed was deafening chaos, as all of Gryffindor realised the new point distribution meant they’d won the cup, beating Slytherin for the first time in years. The banners changed colour as Dumbledore clapped his hand, and everyone was still cheering as the food appeared on the tables – but the delicious offerings were enough to soon distract everyone, disappointed Slytherins included, in favour of stuffing their faces.
“Sleekeazy was invented by your father’s father.” Draco informed him. “It’s really popular. Made him a fortune, and he had only one child, who had only one child, so… That’s a lot of your money, right there.”
“You have a fever.” She sighed. “I have potions brewing right now, but in the meantime, you need water, and rest.
They spent the next two hours of their Sunday afternoon trying out the cloak in turn, and reached the conclusion it really worked, because nobody had been able to see them or even suspect they were there in their trips across the courtyard – apart from when Anthony collided with a group of Hufflepuff and Hal and Neville had to quickly create a diversion, in order to keep the cloak a secret. Draco had suggested that they did – he thought it was too good an asset to let the entire school know he had it.
He didn’t want to think about Nils – or his sister. The whole thing still made him extremely uncomfortable, and while he’d not told anyone, he’d even had a nightmare about it. One, a few days after it had happened – it had started out as one of the nightmares with Lockhart attacking him, but then Lockhart in the dream at morphed into Nils, who instead of pointing a wand at his face, had advanced on him and started touching him. Hal had woken up before anything else had happened, but it had made him feel sick, and he’d thought about it several times over the rest of the summer, wondering what would have happened if the black dog hadn’t fortuitously rescued him, how far the older boy would have taken it.
The floor was slippery, and he skidded to his knees next to Draco, keeping his eyes downcast and carefully away from the reflective surface of the water puddles, as his first thought was that Draco had been petrified. But his skin was soft and his hand limp when Hal grabbed his arm. But he was so cold, and for a terrifying second, Hal thought he might be dead, until he felt a pulse. It was slow, however, and his breathing shallow, and Hal couldn’t help but feel the pinprick of tears at the back of his eyes.
It hadn’t bothered him since the end of the game. Dumbledore had spouted some cryptic shit about that too, but nothing constructive.
“Wandless magic is extremely difficult, Mister Potter.” The man pointed out. “And for a wizard your age especially. Do you expect us to believe you achieved this?”
Hal felt a bit stupid for not having thought of that before, considering how he’d wanted to find someone with a video camera the year before. But wizard photos were almost as good as film, in that they moved. If Colin agreed to document something a tad more interesting than him walking down the corridor, maybe Hal could show is aunt and Ley a game of Quidditch, a few spells, how the castle looked.
He was almost thinking it might be a risk worth taking to just let go, but then it stopped as suddenly as it had started, and he had full control back. With an instinct and single-mindedness he wasn’t sure where he was drawing from, he didn’t even take a second to catch his breath, and instead sliced right through the air going straight for the Snitch.
He caught Hal into a headlock and they wrestled for a few minutes, Petunia looking on fondly, until she told them: “Alright, you both win.”
The room was spotless – the elves would keep it so – but it was musty from disuse. Draco had been in awe, almost afraid of the room for several years, but he cast a look on it now and realised it didn’t feel so sacred anymore. The shadow of his father was mostly gone, and it no longer felt like he’d anger anyone or be disrespectful if he, say, opened a window.
It seems to surprise Hal, and maybe softened his stance, just a bit, but enough to give Draco hope that he could accept his apology. Once again, Hal spoke before he could.
. He hadn’t known, and it wasn’t his fault. He always thought it was weird that people said sorry. He knew it was the done thing, but what came out of his mouth was: “Thank you.”
Lockhart had a great hearty laugh. “He’s modest.” He told the rest of the class with a wink. “You can embrace your fame, Harry!”
After a couple of minutes of this, the other players, Lee Jordan who was commentating, and the audience started noticing. Hal could hear Fred and George shout something at him, though he couldn’t make out the words. The commentary changed tone too, and cheers turned to screams when a particularly violent shake had Hal slip halfway to the tip of his broomstick, dangerously close to falling off.
“Oh, alright.” Hal tried to sound casual, but he actually felt like a big weight was lifted off his chest, and that made him realise he’d been more anxious, afraid even, than he’d thought he was. “That’s good. Didn’t really fancy another rodeo in this rain.”
“I don’t know.” He admitted eventually. “Part of me feels like I’m betraying my heritage, my father’s memory, and losing the right to be the Malfoy heir. Part of me… doesn’t want to be the Malfoy heir. My father was
“I’d gone down into the Chamber of Secrets after my friend, Draco.” He summarised. “When we came back up, Professor Lockhart was there, and he suggested he was going to Obliviate the both of us so he could say he’d found the Chamber himself and beat the monster.”
“But he’s good.” Oliver carried on, oblivious of Hal’s discomfort at the memory. “So you watch out, alright?”
They both became something like her big brothers after that. She was still left to her own devices a lot, because she loved to go explore the outdoors and indoors alike looking for odd (and potentially non-existent) creatures, but she sat with them in the common room and in the Great Hall. Ginny joined them sometimes, the two girls becoming good friends, although the Weasley siblings did they best to pretend they only tolerated each other’s company.
“But.” Hal grinned, shoving his cousin so he’d look up at him again. “I brought you some chocolate frogs.”
He’d made that decision a little while back, in fact he hadn’t opened the diary since his confession to his friends and his fallout with Hal. A big part of him had wanted to, he had felt the urge to turn to Tom and pour out his grief and his worries to him, but it had felt like he’d be letting Hal down even more.
Ron laughed as he got not one, but two portable wizard chess sets, one from Anthony and one from Hal, though the latter was made of chocolate. Hermione got him
On the morning of Hal’s birthday, while the boys were still sleeping, Petunia went up in the loft to recover a biscuit tin she had not thought about in a very long time. She had, in fact, only remembered it existed when seeing the Hogwarts letter come through the post. Considering it had been given to her by her sister’s worthless husband, or so did she think of him at the time, it was a miracle she had disdainfully stashed it in old belongings rather than putting it straight in the bin. But she remembered his words as he’d urged her to take the tin. “When they turn eleven.”
“Well, maybe it would explain this.” She finished with a slight blush creeping up her cheeks, pointing at Hal’s head.
“Oh, this boy has a newt! See, our supply list said owl, cat or toad if we wanted to bring a pet, but I’ve read that it was more of a guideline, intended for first years mostly, and later on you can bring any pet you want as long as they are sensible. Do you have a pet? My parents didn’t want me to get one, they said maybe when I’m older. I think I’d want a cat, they seem to be the most traditional familiars, right? Not that they seemed to be called familiars anymore, I think they’re just pets.”
He’d never liked that part of Halloween night, the part that came after the fun and games, the costumes and treats; the part that was just night, leading up to the next day where, inevitably, Petunia would look a bit sad, and Hal would not be able to not be reminded that he was an orphan, and had never properly known his parents. But it had never been unbearable – because after all, he had a parent. His aunt was raising him as her own, he was loved and taken care of. He had a brother – he had never been lonely.
He also realised he felt incredibly sluggish, his head spinning as he moved. Whatever she had dosed him with the night before, it hadn’t left his system yet – or she’d drugged him again during the night. At least he was still dressed in his own clothes, so whatever her deal was, she wasn’t interested in anything like
He shoved him again, and he and his mates left, trampling all over Draco’s stuff along the way. Draco closed his eyes for a few seconds, sighed, and went to pick it all up.
Well then, it looked like he hadn’t screwed this up yet, that Harry hadn’t made up his mind, and that maybe, he’d get a second chance at getting to know someone new.
No thanks to Ley, but rather in spite of his best efforts, they had managed to get the kitten onto a warm makeshift bed made of a baking tray and old tea towels, and Hal was feeding him some milk using the tip of his finger, when Draco and his mom Apparated in the front room.
“That’s because maybe I’m not a witch, like dad.” Louise said. It didn’t seem to bother her that much.
He didn’t know if they would remain friends, there would still be the house problem after all – he wasn’t sure about Hermione, though he’d be ready to put money on Ravenclaw with what he’d seen of her, but Weasley was a safe bet for Gryffindor. But it felt like a good start, to have established with someone that the Malfoy heir was not just a posh git – he’d heard those words whispered around him down the train, among other things, so he knew that was the expectation of at least part of the student body.
“I thought of coming to you.” She continued. “Because… Because I’d like to change it. And I know there’s potions and I thought you might know something about that.”
One of the first things Hal noticed, walking through the station and boarding the train, greeting mates from his year, was that most of them had transformed from children into teenagers over the summer. Girls and boys no longer sat together; instead, girls gathered in giggling gaggles (a fantastic alliteration he was totally stealing from Fred and George) and boys, forced to do the same (not giggle, but group with other boys), did they best to look absolutely cool about it, when really they were eyeing the girls worriedly, convinced they were whispering about them. Hal caught a few bits of conversation here and there, and it seemed to be more likely they were comparing cosmetic
Maybe he could drop him off with the others, pretend to go off to the toilet and then conveniently not manage to find his way back to their carriage. Motivated by this half-baked plan, he turned to say goodbye to his mother – a touch of the cheek, and she petted his hair and told him to write, then went back to her conversation quite untroubled – and headed for the train, expecting the other boy to follow. They usually did. Draco suspected none of the kids particularly liked him or wanted his approval, but that their parents had told them to stay on his good side. Lucius Malfoy might have been dead for five years, still their wealth, nobility and influence hadn’t changed and their name continued to bear its historical weight.
And that's a wrap! Thank you for your support through comments and kudos, I hope this had made people happy. This is the longest fic I've ever written/posted, and that's without considering there's meant to be 6 more of it!
He was, too. A number of alarm bells were still ringing, telling him not to be naive, to not trust a word out of the man’s mouth, but they were growing faint. Black was either telling the truth, or he was an excellent actor, and Hal thought the former more likely the more he listened to him. His aunt had once told him he was intuitive – maybe it was true. He felt like he would know if the man was lying to his face. He also felt he would already be dead if that really was what Black’s intent was.
Sev nodded, like he’d never expected her to say yes. “I understand this can be difficult to talk about.” He said. “I know this is still considered taboo, especially in Pureblood circles.”
While Quirrell panicked, Hal pressed his advantage, and palms up, pushed the man’s face right out of his way. Quirrell screamed, blisters erupting all over his face, and Hal wasted no time scrambling to his feet. But another, higher and shriller sound joined the screams – the small part of Hal’s brain that wasn’t in fight or flight mode was reminded of the Ringwraiths from the
“A giant bloody spider, that’s what.” Ron said, looking like he was going to be sick. “Tell me it was killed when they found it?”
Blaise decided it was just exhausting to be friends with them, if they couldn’t go two months without one of them ending up in some dire straits, and please could Draco just add that he said ‘Take care’ at the end of his letter. Draco rolled his eyes, but disappeared into his room to write. Anthony though he’d probably want some privacy for that, and he headed out to the library with Pan.
Although even Anthony, scatter-brained as he could be, couldn’t miss the bruises as he walked in on Draco getting ready for bed in their room that night.
On one such occasion, Hal actually met the man’s eyes just as he was looking his way, and a blinding burst of pain shot through his head – through his scar, more specifically. He gasped and clutched the side of his head, squeezing his eyes shut as if that would help it go away. It didn’t.
He spotted Pansy when they arrived, trying to look older than she was in a long green dress, high heels and careful makeup. She wasn’t entirely succeeding, but she looked nice. She was flanked by Daphné and Gregory – who had taken to following them like a guard dog in the past couple of months – and clearly basking in the slightly envious looks they were getting from Astoria, Daphné’s younger sister, and the Carrow twins who were the same age.
Hal looked down, burying his fingers in his cat’s fur for a minute, trying to cling to something normal.
Hal came to a stop, out of breath, and extended one arm from his chest. Wrapped around his other hand, holding on for dear life as he gently cradled it with his thumb, was a tiny silver tabby kitten, looking a little worse for wear.
“Oh.” Hal frowned, surprised. “Really? I mean, I didn’t want them anyway, and I figured Ron’s brothers and sister would need them.”
It took several more minutes and a lot of barking (both from Marge and her dog) to see them both out of the house, and by the time Petunia went upstairs, Ley was coming out of Hal’s room, looking worried and sad.
“I’ve just-” He started, but was interrupted as Ron and Anthony emerged from the trap door on the broom, and he simply pointed at them. “Yeah, that.”
His feet took him to his father’s old study – he spent time in there sometimes, sitting on the large chair, his feet only just, this year, brushing the floor. Imagined himself writing important letters, signing important documents, owling important people. Imagined being a little bit like his father, only the part he could be proud of – Lucius’ dedication to his work, to a job well done.
“L’autre c’est Draco Malfoy. Le plus blond. T’sais, il était dans le magazine aussi, sur la liste des meilleurs partis.”
Hal’s stomach was hurting and his hands shaking from refrained laughter, so he had to stop and do a few normal, boring ones, taking Lockhart’s dictation to calm himself down.
Draco realised he was still wearing the blanket, and hurried to unwrap it from his shoulders and leave it on the back of a chair, making sure to leave the common room and run back to his own quarters before Flint changed his mind about being civil (that had weirdly sounded more like a compliment than a jab, even though it had made Draco’s skin crawl).
Sadly, it didn’t take. The woman pulled a chair up to his side, picked up a bowl and spoon and set out to feed him. Hal turned his head like a reluctant toddler.
everything had been coming nearer and nearer and the next moment, the troll emerged at the end of the hall. The three of them froze, eyes fixed on the beast blocking out almost the entire height and width of the corridor, a large club its hand.
When all was said and done, Neville was a little nervous about how he’d managed, Hal was fairly sure it had gone a lot better in the practical parts than in the essays, Ron didn’t really care, Anthony and Draco had been confident enough that they’d played games in some of them (“I dare you to place the word
“Sure.” She said, even as she checked her watch. “Not too long, maybe. Your godfather is coming tomorrow.”
Draco did not have a chance to argue, before he and the others were pushed out of the room, as Severus disappeared inside the trap door.
Hal sighed, didn’t say anything for a bit, but surprisingly didn’t try to say it was nothing, as Draco had seen him do to Ron and Hermione.
“Snape, Professor Snape, explained about the… Parsley thing.” He added, so as not to appear completely ungrateful.
than it had been the first time. Definitely not as bad as during the party. Anthony opened his mouth again, but Draco stopped him before he could speak.
He didn’t let it spoil the mood as they joined the others. Ensued the most hilarious and chaotic game of Quidditch – if it could even still be called that by the end of it – that Hal had ever played. It ended in a water fight, though Hal thought it was much too cold for that, and didn’t really fancy getting ill again this year; but that was counting without Mrs Weasley casting a spell that felt like she’d turned a giant hair dryer on the lot of them, efficiently drying and warming them up when she called them in for cake.
He was still hazy about what was and wasn’t possible in terms of magic, but it seemed one of the only limits was your own skill and creativity. It wasn’t uncommon for wizards to just go and invent spells (to varying degrees of success), magical items (case in point right there) or potions (Hal’s grandfather being a solid proof of that and, from what Draco had told him, Snape too, though less commercial about it).
Hal of all people realised that life didn’t give you a warning before putting you in situations where you’d need more than
Draco’s lips were pursed in a thin line, and Hal regretted asking, but before he could tell him to forget about it, Draco shrugged.
, taking care of him, while Ley had been left with the neighbours, so if that was still the case of his birthdays on all days...
“Thank you.” He told Draco. “For always explaining things, and not making me feel like an idiot about it. For telling me what I was never told, and everyone else seems to assume I must know already.”
And with that, he left the room himself, going after Hal, giving his aunt a last spiteful look that oddly made pride swell in Petunia’s chest.
“Yes!” Hermione confirmed enthusiastically. “I have read that nowadays 34% of wizards are born to Muggle families, and 58% to at least one Muggleborn parent. Studies have shown that it is in no way related to individual magical strength or ability.”
“He’s an entitled little brat.” He assessed. “Just like his father was. They’re the kind who just take, and take, with no considerations for others.”
There was a silence, and Draco whispered his name carefully, and Hal realised he’d lied back down and closed his eyes. Draco’s voice was soothing, and while the words weren’t altogether reaching his brain, the elegant accent was nice to listen to.
“We should head out, really.” She argued. “I have an appointment with the tailor and I am sure the boys are eager to get to the shops.”
“With our luck.” Anthony commented wryly. “There is probably a three-headed dog on the other side of that wall.”
He wasn’t so sure. But he could tell this logic would reassure her – and it would have been sound, if he’d felt like the old wizard applied any logic at all.
As Hal had expected, Ley also got on with Fred and George like a house on fire. Hal carefully pretended he wasn’t aware of anything they were discussing when they started talking about testing magical sweets on Muggles (Ley
Unfortunately, the element of surprise and Hal’s speed wasn’t enough for him to cover enough distance before Quirrell’s longer legs gave him back the advantage, and although he escaped his grasp the first time he tried to grab him, he tripped and fell on his face on the steps leading back up to the way out, and the older man was on him immediately.
That was so much worse. Draco couldn’t completely grasp what had just happened, but he thought the word was
Draco hadn’t seen Hal since the end of June, and he could feel his mouth hanging slightly open at the sight of him. He had
They’d made it – just – and endured double potions with Slytherin. Hal tried to see Snape in a different light knowing he was Draco’s godfather, he really did, but it was very hard when the man sneered at him whenever he looked in his general direction, belittled Neville constantly and almost rolled his eyes every time Hermione gave a right answer. He wondered if whatever Draco could say to him would really make a difference, but it could hardly be much worse anyway. Which was a shame, because Hal actually quite liked potions, in theory.
She barely seemed to hear it – Draco did not expect her to be amazed by the feat, she didn’t seem to care enough about the rules and running of a Quidditch game for that, but he thought at least she’d be happy Gryffindor had won, if only for Hal. But she clearly had other things on her mind, and was practically vibrating with it.
But that thing didn’t have hands, let alone a wand, and in the meantime, Quirrell’s back was turned, so it took something out of the whole threatening situation, and Hal couldn’t quite think straight as his mind was reeling to grasp the surreal turn of events that was somehow reality.
Given the decoration in the room, it didn’t surprise Hal that she knew his name, but it still unsettled him to hear it.
Making sure things were not cursed or poisoned before he touched or even approached them had been part of his education, so before he picked it up, he made sure to cast the spell his mother had taught him the minute he’d come home with a wand. It could detect immediate danger, Narcissa had designed it herself and it was linked to the wards and blood bonds of the Malfoy household; as such, it only worked for the Malfoys and within the Manor, but given the number of dodgy artefacts bequeathed, stored or hidden between its walls by generations of Blacks and Malfoys over the years, it did come in handy. A lot.
“When you said you were famous and shit…” Ley shrugged. “I just didn’t realise it was like that. It was weird.”
“But tomorrow is a Hogsmead weekend.” Fred, or George, continued. “We’re not going, but the rest of the team will be gallivanting away. Do you guys want to fill in?”
“I want to be a man.” She said quickly. “For real. Permanently. When I grow up, I mean. I think I want… You know how there’s spells and potions to…” She stopped, a blush creeping up her cheeks. “It’s stupid.” She muttered.
“No.” Lupin admitted nervously. “Boggarts do retain some of the abilities of the form they adopt, so a Dementor would still have affected you, and everyone else. If you still would like to have a go…”
“Mine aren’t dead.” Neville clarified. “They’re in St Mungo’s Hospital. They don’t… know me. Or anyone. They don’t know who they are, who my grandma is, they don’t know about the war, or that they have a son.” His voice cracked and he wiped his eyes again. “They don’t know anything. They just exist.”
This fic has grown another chapter oh my god. The last one just doesn't want to end so I had to split it again.
Such as: Dumbledore had been away when they were down in the Chamber, called to the Ministry following complaints from the school governors, to reassess if he should remain in his position as Headmaster of the school in view of the disturbing events. The fact that Fawkes had come to Hal was… well, magical? The bird’s abilities remained undetermined. It seemed that Hal showing loyalty to Dumbledore (he didn’t attempt to correct people on the assumption, even if he’d been riling up Tom Riddle at the time more than pledging his faith in the old wizard) had been the trick.
Also, this comes up in this chapter and I made a note about it in Book 1 already but just as a reminder, I know in cannon James’ parents are still around to see him get married, but I’ve got my own headcannon timeline that they died in his seventh year which partly accounted for his personality change, and made Lily see there was more to him than an obnoxious brat.
. His sense of danger, from a dull rumbling he’d always felt when Flint and his cronies approached him, was now screaming at him to never, ever find himself alone with him again.
Hal took her hand, because he didn’t have to say he felt the same, for her to know it. He did, and it pained him a little, too, that Ley and his aunt would always be slightly on the sidelines of this new world of his. He wouldn’t give up Hogwarts, his friends there, magic, the memory of his parents, for anything in the world – but a part of him resented to have to leave them behind for this.
He sat down right beside Hal and put an arm around him. Draco stood stiffly, quite sure his own attempts at comfort would not be welcomed at all. He felt Dora walk their way and hover behind him, but mercifully, she didn’t say anything. Ley was talking quietly to Hal, Draco didn’t try to hear it. He felt nauseous, guilty for causing his friend distress – but at the same time, he didn’t regret doing it. He hadn’t exactly sugar-coated it for him, but if Hal had heard it from even less sensitive parties, it could have been worse.
Timid footsteps seemed to come near, then hover behind the curtains surrounding the bed, which Petunia pushed aside. Draco was on the other side, Little John Silver cradled in his arms. The young cat tried to jump off as soon as it saw Hal.
Hal spotted a number of ginger heads; Fred and George who seemed to be playing catch with garden gnomes with the rest of the Quidditch team and Lee, two older boys he assumed were Bill and Charlie, from Ron’s accounts, Ron’s little sister screaming encouragements (or maybe abuse) at the lot of them, and Percy trying to look cool reading a book straddling a windowsill higher up.
The jaws of the entire family watching them dropped, a shine in their eyes like this was the best thing they had ever seen in their life to date. Self-conscious, Hal brushed his hair back over it, but he carried on walking up to them anyway.
“Worry not, Harry!” Lockhart told him as he threw a handful of Floo powder in the flames. “Your first class is with me.”
“It’s getting dark, we should get going.” He concluded, apparently pleased with his handiwork. “Hagrid, think of what’s best for… Norbert.”
He tried to ignore all of it and focus on Quidditch, because their first game was coming up, and Hal realised that if he’d thought Oliver had been intense the year before, it was nothing compared to his attitude when the team was playing Slytherin. This year, he seemed particularly incensed, for reasons that Hal came to understand had nothing to do with Quidditch.
Hal hummed. “My uncle died when we were four. I only have a few memories of him, I think Ley has a bit more.” He shrugged. “I don’t really care. He wasn’t very nice.”
Absent-mindedly, he picked up a quill (enchanted to always be wet with ink when used) and flipped the notebook open again.
It had been Anthony’s idea, having their own little party and exchanging gifts after they were all back, to give themselves the time to get things that weren’t owl-order Honeydukes boxes.
He did not expect the man to sigh, pinch the bridge of his nose, and speak in calm, clearly carefully controlled words.
