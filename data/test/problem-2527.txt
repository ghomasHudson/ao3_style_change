Draco’s first instinct was to look at his inner left forearm, hoping that the Dark Mark had disappeared, but it was the same as ever. Now that the Dark Lord was gone, perhaps it would fade over time… And at least it would never burn again.
“He… he…” As an experiment, Draco tried pressing his lips together to stop himself from talking. It wasn’t going to work - it was like physically resisting someone much stronger pushing against his mind. “He tried to rape me.”
He felt his breath begin to speed up and closed his eyes. No, no, he needed to calm down. He needed to not be a wreck when Potter came back. He took slow, deep breaths and tried to come up with any sort of positive angle on the situation. Well, that was easy, he could be dead. He could have been maimed somewhere more visible and lost his excellent Malfoy good looks.
Draco raised one eyebrow.
. Thank Merlin the spell didn’t care about him telling the truth to McGonagall. “I heard Peeves got told what for, so it’s all completely sorted out now, isn’t it.” Sweet, sweet sarcasm.
“I was bluffing, Potter. I just used your low opinion of me to my advantage.”
Neither of them spoke as they took this in. This was much more serious than Draco had realised at first. He’d been so smug that he’d tricked Potter into giving him a task, and a non-life-threatening one at that. Now Draco wanted to curl up into himself, hug his knees to his chest so he could keep some sort of barrier between them. He had never been at someone’s mercy quite like this before - even with the Dark Lord he’d had Occlumency. Potter could ask him anything, and then do whatever he wanted with the knowledge. And what was a Malfoy without his secrets?
Draco nodded as he got his breath back, and felt another surge of gratitude that he had somehow found such an astute muggle with whom to converse. First the kindness of the man in the taxi, and now this doctor’s no-nonsense compassion; talking to muggles was truly going better than he would have dared hope.
wand. It didn’t thrum in his grip like his own wand, but Draco could already tell it would work for him just as well as his mother’s. For a moment, the mad desire seized him to apparate straight out of there. But where would he go? The best thing he had going for him these days was currently sitting right in front of him, looking sorry for himself.
“Prudy, I order you to cut my palm.”
“Er - can I have my wand back?”
friends, Myrtle. I’m sorry I haven’t been to see you lately - after the Easter holidays, I… well… it was just safer to spend most of the time down in Slytherin.”
“I was there. I was under my invisibility cloak. We had just landed, and when we heard you coming up the stairs Dumbledore immobilised me. That’s how you could disarm him, there was only a second and he didn’t have time to deal with both me and you.”
Potter laughed, a trace of bitterness in his tone. “I don’t really either. And I’ve been thinking about it for most of this year.”
“Dobby - Dobby raised me. He cared for me from when I was a baby and all through my childhood. He, I think maybe he - loved me.” Draco felt the burn in his eyes spill over, but he ignored it. “And I, I just - I never - father always - oh, Gods. I treated him so badly, Winky.”
,” with a brisk flick upwards, and Potter winced as he found himself fully sober once again. “
“Okay, okay, I know, all the history between us, there was a war, I understand.”
“What do you mean?” Then Draco remembered. “She said you owed her a life-debt, but… I can’t imagine how she would have…”
“All right, where’s a glass? You need whiskey, now.”
, Malfoy.”
Some of the habitual hardness returned to McGonagall’s face. Good. “Believe me, Malfoy, if we could evict Peeves it would have been done about eight hundred years ago. After Potter and I had our little chat with him, though, I think he does understand that he’s crossed a line. Still, we cannot rely on it. I’m afraid you must leave the school for a while for your own safety, Malfoy. In a few months Peeves will have forgotten his crusade, especially when the school gets back to normal. He is the kind of creature who lives in the moment. So, I am confident that you will be able to return and complete your NEWTs.”
His friends… Parkinson? Zabini? Nott? They would all have their own problems happening around now, and Draco doubted they’d be interested in having anything to do with him in the current post-war political climate. He didn’t blame them.
Potter skidded to a halt, wand pointed directly at Draco’s head. He could clearly see Potter debating whether it was worth trying to aim a stunning spell past Prudy. Draco staggered to his feet, wrapping one hand lightly around Prudy’s neck and trying to look menacing.
“But.” His voice came out wrong, too strangled. He swallowed and tried again. “But how can I do that? I’m a Death Eater, too.”
Draco huffed a slightly louder gasp, the shadow of a laugh.
Dobby’s sister.” The pain in his chest was back, a totally different kind from the ache in his lung. He allowed himself to clench his hands together so he could keep his face impassive.
“See, that is instantly about ten times less hideous, even if it is a shapeless sack.”
. George - no-one could even
while breaking into Gringott’s.”
“Shut it, Potter. I know I’m a pureblood, but even I can have too much tradition.”
Draco felt as though he had just been punched in the stomach.
Potter let go of his arm, hissed “Follow me,” and took off in the opposite direction. Draco turned and saw a particularly large boulder - Draco thought the correct word might be a tor - a handful of yards away, looming darkly in the sunlight.
“I know. As for the tradition side of it, it’s strange in a way, but there are some parts of magic which are so ancient they don’t really require any special ritual or ceremony. When my father passed on the inheritance to me, for instance, all it needed was a mingling of our blood and for us both to state our intention. Some of the old magic is even more elemental than that - the kind that came from your death, or your mother’s, for instance. It’s a type of magic that flows directly from people’s actions, or who they are.”
He gingerly pulled back the tent flap and ducked his head as he hopped through.
you. You need to get a bit of perspective, Malfoy. You’re only human, and you were in an impossible position.”
Draco stifled a sigh of relief.
“Okay. Well, if you wouldn’t mind trying to stand on that leg? You can hold on to the desk so you can stay upright and I’ll be able to watch the muscle from here.”
they wanted him to have proper medical care.
“Don’t even, Potter. You do
, Potter, no need for rough handling, I’m coming - but I still think this is a bad idea - ”
Another nod.
Potter untucked a hideous pouch from under his t-shirt where it hung around his neck, and reached inside it. He pulled out Draco’s wand.
Peeves flew down to the pile of rubble, effortlessly hoisted a piece of stone the size of a cauldron up to his shoulder, and threw it at Draco.
“What if I order you?”
Potter’s frown was now one of confusion rather than anger.
They didn’t speak all the way down the driveway to the gates. Just before he stepped out of them, Draco turned back and looked at the castle. He sucked in a breath. Hogwarts was visibly wrecked. The Great Hall and Entrance hall had already been repaired, and the grounds cleared of the most obvious debris, so he had actually forgotten that this was what he would see. The walls were blackened, pock-marked with impact craters, gaping open in places. Whole towers were missing. He had wanted to take one last look in case he could never return, but this wasn’t how he wanted to remember Hogwarts.
“No need to get huffy, Potter.”
Draco wondered how Potter’s wand had been broken in the first place. He shrugged.
Draco took the piece of muggle parchment that she held out, holding it awkwardly in front of his face without moving his head. It was too smooth and the letters on it were unnaturally even, not hand-written. It informed him that this muggle Healer was called Dr. Anne Liston and worked in a place called Harley Street, in London.
Draco stared. It felt like every part of himself was being pulled towards that length of hawthorn. He had to fight to hold himself still. Gods. His
Draco smirked. “Yeah, well, I think she felt pretty justified.”
“It is certainly a bit of a kick in the teeth.”
Draco was already over halfway to Hagrid. He wished he could move slower, wished the Hollow was larger… There were only two more levels of people below him. The spell was driving him forwards to a spot just at the edge of the basin, roughly midway between Hagrid, Granger, Longbottom, and Weasley, where they would all see him, and where he could face them all. Behind him, he could hear Andromeda continuing with the next part of the ceremony.
“We are come,” the crowd intoned softly. Draco moved his lips soundlessly over the response, recalling them from funerals years ago - a grandmother here, a great-aunt there. He noted with surprise that Potter also knew the response, when he never seemed to know anything about wizarding culture. How many funerals had Potter already been to over the last week?
Once the crutches fit him, Draco swung himself upright. It felt brilliant to be fully mobile again.
“I… don’t see a way. I think I might be the Malfoy who breaks the line.”
Patronus. An otter patronus was pacing back and forth through the air above Potter’s sprawled form, looking highly agitated. Potter was dead to the world, his jaw slack and his limbs tangled in the blankets.
Draco eyed Potter, too exhausted from the previous panic to feel appropriately alarmed.
“Yep. This is only the British takeaway version of Indian food, though; I expect it’s a bit different in India itself. One thing I do know is that it’s supposed to be really spicy…”
Potter sat back with a sigh. “You know, I really thought I wasn’t hungry, but that was great. Again.”
“You’re saying… that you’ve done bad things, too, and that I’m being too hard on myself?”
“You’re the third muggle I’ve ever spoken to.”
The memories kept replaying in his mind; the images were so fresh and recent they didn’t even feel like memories yet. This morning, just a few hours ago, Harry Potter had stood
“What? Oh… because of your leg?”
Draco negotiated the tufts of moor grass as best as he could without snagging the damn cloak under his crutches. Potter was well in the lead in a few short moments. Looking ahead, Draco saw Potter skid to a halt in front of a tall woman stood in the shadow of the tor. As Draco got closer, he saw that the huge granite formation was actually made up of two boulders, with a small gap in between them.
“Oh, man.” Potter wiped at his eyes. “I needed that. I haven’t laughed like that in - I can’t remember when I last laughed like that.”
And then Lestrange had swung one leg over him, was straddling him, pinning him down, grinding their groins together. Lestrange’s hand had moved up to Draco’s hair, yanking his head backwards, jamming a wand into his exposed neck. Draco whimpered, hating himself for his weakness. Helplessness coiled with disgust in his stomach, curdling into despair, but he still didn’t want to let this brute know how scared he was.
“Oh, Prudy. I’m so, so sorry. I wish - I wish I could have died instead of him - ”
Draco took a breath. The thought of being able to see Hogwarts again was surprisingly soothing. But… He looked into McGonagall’s worn face. “You’d let a - a Death Eater come back to school?”
And now he had no choice. He had to explain himself.
He turned back to look further into the wood. He had been told that he would see this, of course, but knowing the wood was here and being inside it were two different things. No wonder his father had loved coming down here. Above him, through the thick leaves, he could see hints of a darkening blue sky, lighter over towards the west. Looking as far as he could through the trunks, he could see no sign of the walls. The ground was mossy, springy earth, but as he limped forwards to the nearest tree, a tall half-grown sapling, he could still see the mosaic of his own face framed in its tiled circle on the ground in front of it.
“No way. Head hurts. Can’t think about new spells. Here.” Potter thrust his grubby, grey-white holly wand towards Draco.
“My what, sorry?” Draco was proud he had managed to speak, although he would admit his voice sounded breathy.
Draco couldn’t stand it. She just looked so sad. He rubbed her back in small circles and met her pleading gaze, unable to speak, and he watched as she read the truth in his eyes. He watched her hope disappear.
“That was rude, Potter.”
Draco found the strap and wrestled it over himself, although it kept jarring when he yanked on it.
Potter’s eyes widened in understanding. William Weasley, however, raised an eyebrow, looking amused. “Oh, please, don’t let me stop you, Malfoy. I’ll treasure the memory. It’ll be a story to tell the grandkids, a Malfoy actually apologising.”
Potter was now bringing out little flat boxes from the bag with a rustle. Draco struggled out from his nest and hopped over to a seat, cracking the lid off one of the boxes curiously.
The only thing he could think of was Potter - if Potter demanded an explanation from him, he suspected that would override the compulsion towards Hagrid. But he was invisible, with every muscle locked against the pull to move. Potter had no reason right now to give him a second thought.
The stone melted away and he all but fell through, whipping his right arm inside and turning in time to see the stone close again on the outraged Auror.
with you?”
movement of the neck, you must lie absolutely still! Do you think it might be possible to apply the restraints now that you are awake and able to consent to it?”
must not. I put us all on the losing side of this war, and I will not have you paying for my mistakes. You are the future of the house of Malfoy. We all must do whatever it takes to reduce your punishment and have you reestablished into society. You must find a way for the family to recover from this disgrace.”
better than what you have now. You will have most of the function of your leg. You will not suffer from debilitating and painful muscle seizures. You will be able to live a much less restricted life.”
Potter came to with a start and a snort, eyes widening in instant panic. In two seconds, he was on his feet with his wand drawn and pointed at Draco. Merlin, Draco was an idiot - what had he been thinking, waking Potter like that a week after a war?
Draco clenched his fists. “
was an accident.”
The door closed, and after a few seconds, Potter reappeared, looking confused. “I thought you were following me? Do I need to hold the door for you?”
“Nice try, Malfoy. You won’t, as it happens. You just need to do your little Death Eater salute and then you can walk through the door easy as platform nine and three-quarters.”
“Begging your pardon, oh most Potterful one. I was just doing what any decent soul would do, your Chosen-ness, sir!”
“No. I need you to go, Potter. I can’t take this anymore.”
Draco sat shoulder to shoulder between his parents on the familiar bench, looking out over the Great Hall. Under the cover of the long dining table in front of them, Draco held tightly to his father’s hand on his right, and his mother’s on his left. They were not a touchy family as a rule, but this was definitely time for an exception. Since they had found each other at the end of the battle all three of them had kept as close together as possible. The firm press of his parents’ shoulders against his own felt like the only thing keeping him upright at the moment.
Potter came back to where Draco could see him, waiting for him to continue. Draco quailed, but now the Path spell had kicked in, and he could almost let it do the talking for him. “What you said. About it being your fault. You know that was bullshit, right? You didn’t get yourself imprisoned on purpose, and it was Dobby’s choice to rescue you. I was - I was the one who stood by and did
For a moment they both stayed still and looked at each other. Then Potter stepped forward, his movements slightly jerky, and put the bag of takeaway down on the small table.
“Ha. Sure. Only a Malfoy would use their
Potter aimed his wand at a heap of stuffing and kindling and said, “
Madam Pomfrey winced. Draco felt a strange stab of anger and sympathy. He couldn’t decide if Potter had insulted him.
Draco heard the toilet flush. He checked his pocket watch again. Eleven twenty-two.
“Is the tree giving Master what is needed?”
Draco took it, mouth agape. Merlin. He was holding a wand again. He was holding
“Pass me the crutches, son, that’ll make it a bit easier.”
“No-one but me will know you’re there, so that should work out nicely.”
“There we go, nothing to it.” The man was beaming at him from a bare metre away in the sunlight. Draco couldn’t help but give him a small smile in return, which seemed to please the man immensely. Draco realised how lucky he’d been to get such a nice muggle as his driver. Just as the man turned to go, Draco managed to get his voice to work.
“Yes, I know - ”
He sat up and checked himself over carefully. His right palm, where he had cut it with the silver knife, now bore a small white straight scar. He touched it for a moment, feeling the slightly raised skin, but it didn’t hurt at all.
Draco let his left hand rest on Prudy’s narrow back. He hated to see her upset, and he hadn’t even told her yet.
Weasley nodded impatiently. “That’s the idea, Malfoy. Then I’ll disable the spell from the inside.”
Draco nodded. It was so strange that this muggle
A moment later, Prudy clambered up and over the edge of the mattress. She settled herself almost primly on the bed to the left of Draco’s chest, tucking her pillow-case and purple waist-coat down around her crossed knees. Draco scanned her all over.
wouldn’t have done it, Potter.”
Draco whipped his head up. Potter was drawing his wand, and he looked serious. He stood up and extended his empty hand towards Draco, eyebrows raised in challenge.
“Wait - Grimmauld Place? The Black town-house?”
“Hang on, you want the Ministry to control what tasks people give him?” said Harry. “Shouldn’t that be between him and them?”
This time, Potter did wait long enough to hold the door open for him, which saved him having to open it using his shoulder. Potter had been telling the truth. The Aurors - one of them the woman who had stood guard over him down in the dungeon cell - looked over, and frowned, but didn’t say anything. Potter levitated Draco’s trunk again from where he’d left it by the Staff Table, and Draco followed him quickly through the Great Hall, the Entrance Hall, and out onto the grounds.
“Oh - put your seatbelt on, yeah? Only it’s my responsibility if you don’t, see.”
They were all silent for a minute. This was bleak. Potter may be sickeningly noble, but there was a difference between spur-of-the-moment heroics to prevent Draco’s fiery death and preventing Draco from going to prison. Potter would want to see all the Death Eaters brought to justice. He’d lock Draco away forever and throw away the key, and probably enjoy it.
Potter was shaking his head slightly.
, Potter? You can’t just
Couldn’t Potter see how wrecked he was? He couldn’t do it, he wouldn’t be able to do it, the tent was so far away…
“I still should be getting punished worse than I am, though. I’ve got out of having a proper trial, of serving time in Azkaban. I - I would have faced it, Potter, I
“Okay, let’s get this broom in the air. You can’t just down a whole bottle at once you know, you have to pace yourself, so we need to get started if you want to pass out before midnight.”
“I want you to explain yourself, Malfoy! What’s going
“Anyway. Malfoy, what the fuck is going on? What was that spell you did? We analysed the remains in the cup, but it just seemed to be some kind of tree bark…”
“Is that so?”
“Ready?” Potter demanded.
your fault, but I can still kind of see how, if I’d been brainwashed into feeling superior, it might have been easy to act like an entitled little git.”
“I can, and I will.
He swung his crutches and ventured forth through the shimmer of the wards, imagining he could feel a slight comforting tingle as he passed through them. He fixed his eyes on the sad-looking beech tree at the corner of the grass square and made his way over to it, breathing a sigh of relief when he was safely underneath. Then he remembered that Potter had erected a Notice-Me-Not charm here, and reluctantly left its shade to linger on the ugly pavement instead. Why muggles insisted on building all their roads and pavements from this awful tarmac stuff, he would never understand. Give him some paving slabs or cobble stones any day, at least they had personality…
“I see. Magic, I always forget. So the skin itself looks to be well-healed, although scarred. I presume it’s the loss of muscle which is causing problems?”
Potter squirmed. “Well. That’s understandable.” He rubbed his nose for a moment. “Sorry. I have to remember not to ask so many questions…”
himself without hesitation. He tried to get himself to turn round, to walk back up the spiral path and out of the Hollow, but his legs absolutely refused to take him further away from Hagrid. The best he could do was to hold himself still, and not even that for much longer.
“Oh no!” Prudy squeaked. Her tiny fists covered her mouth and her ears quivered. “Oh no, oh no…”
Potter drew up another chair and sat opposite him, cradling his own tea. For a while, they sat in silence, letting it cool. Potter took a sip and then looked over at Draco.
“Th-thank you.”
She stepped down from her stool and moved it up until it was next to Draco’s head. Then she hopped onto it again.
Draco reached for his glass of water, which was still a third full. He passed his palm over the top of the glass and then turned his hand upwards and closed his fingers, as if he had taken a handful of air. He pulled upwards and the water rose obediently out of the glass, floating in a loose ball. Draco opened his hand and began to circle the water with a finger. The water started turning, getting faster and faster until it had formed into a tiny miniature whirlpool, spinning like a top.
“Yes, but - ”
“Which is a form of ancient elf magic. It works for me because my family are descended from wood-elves.” Draco stopped. Once again, he hadn’t meant to say that last part. Apparently the magic had decided that ‘explain yourself’ meant revealing family secrets. Shit.
“Then you’re an idiot.”
Draco understood immediately. “Do you know when the new moon - ?” He stopped. He already knew. The knowledge arose instantly, and Draco’s stomach lurched as he realised this was an effect of the old magic. “Three weeks.” Three weeks and a day, to be precise. And the full moon started a week from now.
He sucked in a shuddering breath as he was finally permitted to fall silent. He kept his eyes closed and wiped the tears away angrily. With an enormous effort, he forced himself to calm his breathing and open his eyes. He would
He scooted over to the armchair on his bum. He remembered the tray being delivered yesterday, but it was as if through a haze. When the house-elf came he had pulled himself tighter into a foetal position on the sofa and held his breath until they were gone, so that they wouldn’t hear him hyperventilating.
“You had it all along? Then why were you using mine?”
“God… Isn’t he your uncle?”
Draco was surprised to see Shacklebolt look awkward for a moment. “I thought it may make it easier to have a Ministry intermediary to approach these people and explain the situation for you. It would also help in keeping this contained. I am keen to make sure that the existence of this Path of the Penitent stays somewhat of a secret. I don’t fancy having others trying this same option to evade the regular system of justice.”
“I also feel worse though. Gods. I am so stupid. This keeps getting more humiliating.”
Draco shuddered. All at once, he remembered visiting his father in Azkaban. The awful, clammy cold of it, the sunken despair from the dementors.
“Yes, I’m fine,” Draco said, acting on pure social reflex, before he even registered that these would be the first words he had ever spoken to a muggle.
The Minister walked back to the bed with a raised eyebrow.
ed me, and them, on and off for a few hours, until I tried to do it, just to stop them being tortured any more. But I couldn’t. I said the words but it had no effect. I couldn’t - couldn’t mean it enough. I was too weak.”
“You can’t know that, Malfoy! You’re not s’posed to - not s’posed to lie to me.”
“The Ministry are nearly finished with rounding up the others. They will remember us soon. We must prepare for our arrests.”
Draco kept his posture straight even as he wanted to shrink back against the wall. Every sensation felt raw and his heart pounded and he felt a bit nauseous.
“Pity.” The spell made him continue. “Although I suppose it’s nice to still be a person who hasn’t killed anyone.”
Potter’s face hardened, which was much better. But the words he said were still far too kind. “Malfoy, no-one deserves or doesn’t deserve a life-changing injury. It’s just a thing that happens, that has to be dealt with.”
The driver had mercifully pulled the car to a stop just before they rolled right out into the oncoming traffic, and was looking over at Draco.
Draco managed to draw level with them, but before he could register more than that his estranged aunt looked unnervingly like his dead one, they both turned and walked through the gap between the two granite boulders. The path was dusty but quite level, and easier to navigate than the grass. Draco managed to keep up, making an invisible third in line as the path narrowed.
The stairs were a new challenge with the crutches, but they weren’t too hard. He was breathing hard by the time he reached the top, though.
Draco swallowed, thinking of Dobby. “Well, to be precise, the seven people I have most wronged who are still alive, sir. And if any of the tasks are incomplete after seven lunar cycles, I have one final lunar cycle to finish them, while getting increasingly ill.”
“Yes.
After an hour or two he fell into a light doze. He jolted awake when something icy passed through his hand, and he almost screamed at the translucent figure looming over him.
without any mischief in his eyes.
be my ally. Just the tacit approval of hosting me would go a long way towards counteracting the hatred I will receive as a Death Eater walking free. It should help to prevent another vigilante assassination attempt at least.”
Draco felt himself being lowered gently onto some kind of surface - an upturned part of the branch lattice.
“I used the
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Using magic again felt amazing, but it was also tiring to do so many spells at once while still suffering from his own hangover.
Potter emerged from the bathroom and sank into one of the mismatched armchairs, looking quite grey in the face.
Draco wished he knew what else to say. He could go off on a rant about the Weaselette, but he didn’t know how much leeway Potter would feel comfortable giving him. Potter’s stupid sense of nobility would probably force him to speak up in her defence. And Potter needed the space to vent about her if he wanted, not defend her.
He swirled the wand horizontally in a gentle figure of eight, murmured “
Potter looked up from the armchair and glared at him.
need to apologise. No!” Potter’s mouth had opened in protest but Draco barrelled on. “I don’t
“Anyway. I think he cared about you too, but, well, if I was you, I would be livid. He used you, Malfoy. He knew damn well what you were up to that year, Snape must have told him straight away. He could’ve offered you and your mother a way out right back in the summer, the Order could’ve hidden you, but it was all too perfect an opportunity for him to stage his own death in a way that let Snape stay at Hogwarts. So he let you suffer, and stumble along, and nearly kill Katie and Ron. And he let me stumble around after you until I nearly killed
The elf looked at him, her big brown eyes hooded by sagging eyelids. Her tanned skin was as wrinkly as a walnut, and her remaining hair was just wisps of white sticking straight up from her head. She wore a tiny version of what was unmistakably simple black wizarding robes; she was a free elf.
“No problem, Potter.”
Draco fought the urge to squirm under her gaze. He had a nasty feeling he had just made a serious faux-pas.
, somehow suddenly alive again, and the Dark Lord had stood
think I was going to die when the taxi started moving. Would it hurt the other drivers to keep their cars just a little further away? I swear there was barely a foot between the cars on the left side and the right side of the road!”
Potter grinned. “Yep. Can you do yourself too?”
“I pass the mantle down, from father to son,” Lucius said, eyes locked with Draco’s.
“Winky - do you work with Dobby here at Hogwarts?”
“Yes, yes, I am held back by my leg, and, I know you’re thinking it, by having never actually set a table before - ”
so that he could cast his usual hair-styling charms, but he’d just have to let it dry wavy.
“Do stop apologising, I’m sure you needed the sleep. Come on, you’re the last here, we’re ready to start.”
“It has certainly contained a few firsts.”
right behind him nearly made Draco fall over again. He forced himself to remember his leg and managed to spin round relatively deftly, to see a tall male Weasley standing under the tree, arms crossed.
The granite of the basin was rough on his skin as he dragged himself along the edge of it, and then he was where the spell demanded him to be. People must have noticed him by now, but he could not hear them beyond the rushing in his ears.
“How are you going to
The man tugged on a grey strap that was running across his chest, and Draco followed it down to where it seemed to be lodged securely in some kind of latch mechanism with a bright red button. Draco looked around, but couldn’t see where his was meant to come from.
Frona nodded, satisfied. “Frona is doing what Frona can for your other wounds, but they is being cursed, Master Draco.”
People stood silent and staggered up every side of the amphitheatre, with enough space between each person to make it seem as though everyone stood alone. The effect was striking, and eerie. Draco followed Potter and Andromeda as they started down the granite spiral path that wound down into the centre, and then he understood how everyone had arranged themselves into such a perfectly spaced pattern; the path widened every three yards or so into natural, circular plinths, designed for standing on.
“Oh, well, thank fuck for that. One Malfoy at a time seems like plenty to me.” Potter looked over quickly, as if he expected Draco to be offended, but Draco only snorted.
Draco blinked and saw - yes - the same Hogwarts’ cell.
Madam Pomfrey’s affront melted into a frown at his obvious terror, and she turned, being far too obvious as she did so, to see what he was looking at.
His father had deliberately misled him; he had softened the likely consequences when he explained the plan. Azkaban hadn’t had dementors since their defection two years ago, but now that the Dark Lord was gone the Ministry would get them back under control. Fucking hell, Draco couldn’t do it. He couldn’t risk that happening. If his father was Kissed - Merlin, no, no - then his soul would be gone. He’d never join his ancestors in the grove, even when his husk of a body eventually died. Draco would truly never see his father again.
“The Potter boy also owes you a life-debt,” his father said. “You did not identify him when he was at the Manor.”
to your doctor’s appointment? What, you - you actually tied it to your jeans?”
The Bloody Baron was still near the ceiling, staring down at Myrtle with obvious disapproval.
Draco threw his left arm up, using his right crutch and leg to desperately fling himself out of the way, but it was point-blank range and Peeves, like his aunt Bella, had excellent aim. The stone crashed into his left shoulder and chest, crushing his arm in between them, and Draco’s feet left the ground with the impact. He fell back and kept falling past the level of the ground, and after a long moment his back crunched into the stairs, the boulder landing on top of him. It bounced off, avoiding his face by less than an inch, and Draco rolled brokenly down the rest of the stairs, landing in a heap on his side at the bottom.
Probably not reassuring at all, actually. If this woman had been involved in the war in even a marginal way, it wouldn’t have been on his side. “How much - er, how much do you know about the war?”
He really didn’t want to go out there. There was no-one in the castle who would be pleased to see him. At least no-one would be able to capture him. He set his jaw, straightened his back as much as he could with the crutches and swung himself through the arch in the stone and into the corridor, which was mercifully empty.
. I killed him. I - I - he’s dead, because I - ”
“We’ll, er - we’ll leave. Um, for now. I’ll tell the others you’re staying put in Slytherin tonight, right? You’ll stay here?”
Draco pressed his lips together. His whole torso flared with shame and anger. It was hard to look at this man’s maimed face, harder still not to snap back as a desperate deflection, but he knew it was the very, very least he could do. It didn’t feel possible to do anything more, though.
“Mr Malfoy -!”
“Here we are. That’ll be eight pounds fifty, lad.”
. And for an attack to happen
“He did mention it, yeah. Gods only know why you’re taking him in, Harry. Mum and dad are going to flip their lids. I remember picking up the pieces after your recent experience of the Malfoys’
“She’s - she was your cousin, Draco. Family. You should get the chance to say goodbye. And you did say you’d come.”
He topped up the ink in his quill and began.
Madam Pomfrey turned to look at him. “Yes. It was a near thing too, Mr Malfoy. Your injuries were catastrophic. But I have not lost my touch yet.”
. They had all signed a statement at the bottom which read:
“Ha ha. I suppose you think you’re very amusing. Actually, and please do bear in mind I’m being forced to tell you this and I don’t want to and I don’t want you to make anything of it, right now I am both jealous of your ability to use sarcasm and rather glad you’re being a bit of a prat, because it’s familiar and I find it comforting, and I’m getting quite uneasy thinking about how many muggles there are within a mile radius of me. Also, I feel disgusting having to tell you all this.”
“Pretty much.” Potter smiled fondly.
The lattice lifted him up off the ground, and Draco was dimly aware of Potter racing up the same stairs he had just fallen down. His eyes blurred, but he felt them turn left instead of right, to cross the Great Hall.
Draco’s breath caught. It was very rare for his father to say he was proud of him. And never in Draco’s
Draco wanted to say something cutting to show Lestrange that he wasn’t intimidated, but he could barely even breathe. He felt light-headed.
” He turned on his chair and leaned over to pull the sheet of parchment from under his pillow. He thrust it into Potter’s face.
“I - I appreciate the offer, Prudy, but I’m not sure it would be wise to just leave. The Aurors would be quite annoyed to have to come and get me again.”
Winky took a deep breath. “If you is happy to lie down, sir…”
“Don’t look at me like that. I don’t want you to feel
“I’m seventeen.”
Potter brought his wand out and flicked it a few times, spelling the plates clean and then back into the cupboard, and vanishing the empty takeaway boxes. There was, once again, enough rice left over for Draco to eat it in the morning.
“Not for… probably not for a few years, at least. It will be better to give the appearance that you no longer wish to be associated with me.”
to him, in a way that was indirect but really very thoughtful. And also quite stupid.
“We wondered where you’d gone in the battle,
“Yes, I will. Thank you, Potter. And I’ll even put my money in the pocket of these jeans rather than in my money pouch. It’s a lot less secure when it isn’t underneath a layer of robes, anyway.” He deposited a handful of mixed cutlery on the table and eased himself back down onto the opposite bench to Potter, before reaching into the bag and beginning to sort out the little plistac and foil boxes.
Nothing happened, of course. Draco hadn’t even thought to look for Lestrange’s wand on his way over to Prudy.
Eventually, he roused himself, glad no-one was here to see him drag himself along the floor on his backside. He laid down on his back on the sofa and contemplated the gothic arches of the ceiling, holding the parchment against his chest and letting the remnants of terror from his dream fade.
Draco was trying to catch his breath. His chest seemed to be full of shards and something was bubbling in his throat.
“I’ll find her, Malfoy.”
Draco shook his head, a little shocked. He’d had no idea about any of that. He had never thought to think about how any part of his body actually worked. He supposed that if he’d thought about it, he would have said it was magic. But that was idiotic; muggles existed, and
No, Gods, no, he couldn’t do that, not here. With a huge effort, he prevented himself from moving any further forward. It felt a bit like the times when he had tried not to say what the spell wanted him to explain to Potter - like a pressure, building behind his eyes and tongue, and he knew that in moments it wouldn’t be possible to resist -
They re-materialised on a small hill of tufty grass in the middle of rolling moor-land, dotted with boulders of granite. This moor must normally be wind-swept, but today the blue sky remained serene and huge above them. About a mile away, Draco could make out a quaint little village, tucked in the lee of the hill on the opposite side of the valley, at the edge of the moor. Nothing looked familiar.
“He’s the one who Greyback injured, when I - when I - when I let the other Death Eaters into the castle. I… don’t know why I’m not kneeling on the ground right now begging for forgiveness.”
the castle. That was the only way Draco could truly be safe, he realised - he had to leave Hogwarts. It was only now that he was facing the prospect of permanent exile that he realised how much he would miss it.
“Well then, I think I’ve just had an unbelievably shitty day.”
“Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!”
Peeves appeared at the top of the stairs, holding another big chunk of stone. Draco cried out, or tried to, and his right hand planted his crutch against the floor. The Old Magic made his shattered bones grate together as it thrummed through him at top speed. In the time it took Peeves to soar down the stairs, the crutch had burst into a network of branches, forming a protective cage over Draco’s body.
Potter ignored him, instead half-turning to give the Aurors another nod. The male Auror held back, keeping his wand pointed straight at Draco, while Potter and the female Auror stowed their wands up their sleeves and started moving around Draco’s bed.
“Malfoy!”
The trouble was that the opening was so
“Sorry, Potter. You’re not an idiot. You’re just unbelievably -
“You’re not even drunk yet, Potter.”
Potter checked his watch. “Let’s go. Bill’s going to be meeting us there in half an hour.” He swirled his wand and levitated Draco’s trunk in front of him. “We just need to get down to the gates and then I’ll apparate us there.”
The Auror stopped a few steps away from him, obviously wary. Her eyes flickered to his hand, still resting against the wood of the door, and Draco knew she was wondering how much Draco had to do with Lestrange’s injuries.
The water, both the blob in front of his face and the small model in front of Potter’s, fell and splashed on the surface of the table.
“The - heroics! I bet even the bloody basilisk is true, right?”
“All right. So what’s the deal, how does the Path itself work? You said something about tasks?”
Okay. What about the way they’d handled this back when his father had been imprisoned? He remembered the monthly visits to Azkaban over that miserable year. His mother had smuggled in the silver knife, and his father’s dripping blood always seemed far too loud as he slowly filled a glass phial. Prudy could be Draco’s visitor, and hide the knife… But Prudy wouldn’t be able to use the blood afterwards. It had only worked because Draco was a Malfoy.
However, three weeks was a paltry amount of time. He couldn’t just wait for the hearings to come along. He’d had some half-formed idea of pleading to the court, of weaving a piteous tale of a terrified and coerced child, all while being a model convict, meekness personified. But he didn’t have time for any of that. He’d have to throw his political weight around - ha, what political weight? No. He’d have to do as his father had suggested. He’d have to sell everyone else out, as quickly and thoroughly as possible, even though he would most certainly be making his father’s situation significantly worse. Draco swallowed, feeling ill. Then he took a deep breath and forced himself to accept his father’s logic. His father was already going to Azkaban for decades at least - what was the difference, really, between thirty years and life without parole?
The sun shining strongly down from the enchanted ceiling confirmed that it was already well into mid-morning. They had sat there for hours, and apart from accepting some water and sandwiches from a tray carried by a house-elf, they had interacted with no-one else in the room.
The Auror kept pace a few steps behind. Draco watched her out of the corner of his eye as he continued his slow progress. The stretch of wall that marked the entrance to the Slytherin common room was coming up, but the Auror didn’t change her attitude. Not a Slytherin, then.
“You want me to trigger it? Deliberately?”
“When I whispered yes, she told everyone I was dead. And so that was when they all paraded back again. She knew it was the only way she’d be able to get back to the castle to get to you.”
“And not here. Common room.”
Draco appreciated his effort, but unfortunately it didn’t make a difference. The spell seemed to interpret Potter’s facial expression as being a question. He sighed. “It pisses me off because it puts me in a very weak position. Malfoys aren’t supposed to be indebted, we’re supposed to be the ones who are owed. But actually it makes little difference right now, since I’m in pretty much the most vulnerable position possible in any case. You can take any information you want from me, and tell anyone, and use it all against me.”
Draco sat, purely because Potter was in a frantic hurry and he didn’t want to slow him down. Potter ran up to him, dropped the shoes, and ran back into the bedroom, shouting, “Get those on - I’ll get you a jumper - ” Draco obediently started lacing as quickly as he could, gingerly easing his foot into the left shoe without putting pressure on his leg, but his foggy mind had finally caught up enough to protest.
Draco opened his eyes. The muggle had leant over and somehow caused the window to open, and Draco could see a man’s wrinkled face, his features somehow akin to Potter’s in the shade of his skin and the black of his hair, with a hint of concern in his dark eyes.
He kept almost doing a double-take at the sight of Potter. He’d been gone for so long, become a myth. Having Harry Potter sitting in front of him - on a green velvet armchair in the middle of the Slytherin common room, no less - was surreal.
No sooner had Draco done this when he heard the kitchen door bang into the wall again. With a wrenching sense of
want him to go to Azkaban…
too close to the parked cars beside them - and then the car turned the corner of the square and picked up speed, heading straight towards a road with lots and lots of
“Oh, right.” Potter walked away, and came back shortly with Madam Pomfrey, who was holding a pair of wooden crutches much like the ones Draco had made for himself. She measured them against him and cast a quick Elongation Charm to make them the right size.
“I know you would have done. That’s why I had to get rid of it. It’s too dangerous.”
The drawing room barely resembled the elegant room Draco had grown up with. The Death Eaters had found many ways to entertain themselves during their residence here and one involved destroying and defacing the Malfoys’ property with impunity. Deep gouges scarred the surface of the long table, there was rubble in the fireplace, and the mirror above the mantelpiece was cracked clear from one edge to the other. The portraits here had all been abandoned by their occupants months ago; they were still hiding in the relative safety of the upper floors.
Draco smirked. “Scared, Potter?”
had his father apologised to him. He dropped his gaze to the table and gave his father a brief nod of acknowledgement, not trusting himself to speak.
“Sorry - sorry, Malfoy - we have to get you to Madam Pomfrey, come on.”
“My grand-daughter was hoping that young Master Malfoy would take Prudy back into service,” Frona said.
A few minutes later, Potter was standing in front of him, holding out the cup of tea. Draco cautiously unwrapped his arms from his chest and didn’t feel at immediate risk of falling apart. He took the tea - it was in the Chudley Cannons mug - and let the warmth seep into his hands and comfort him.
Draco sighed. He knew what he had to do next, and he didn’t want to do it. But Potter,
Potter looked down at the firewhiskey in his hand as if a bit surprised to see it there. “I guess that kind of is my intention. I’ve never actually done it before, though.”
Draco nodded slowly. It made sense. Just - Merlin - eight hours ago he had been clutching Goyle, sure he was going to die, and now he was about to become head of the family? He wanted to say he was too young for this, far too young for the responsibility, but he stopped himself. He had to do this.
“I get it, I get it, Tom was there and it was horrible and dangerous.”
No medical care for him, of course. They were all busy attending to the survivors from the winning side of the war.
The Auror glared. “
Draco’s mouth twisted.
“Yes. Yes, he is, Harry Potter killed him on Saturday. Um, who is Hitler?”
. So, now you’re well enough, you’ll have lunch and then there are some people who want to talk to you.”
That wasn’t the important thing right now, though. He had to find Potter.
She passed her hand over his and the cut vanished.
.” Nothing. “
place in his heart for his pubescent nephew. Most teenage boys actually, I think, but I was the only one around most of the time.”
Draco hurried to speak before Potter did something stupid, like offer to go away again. “I don’t mind in the slightest, Potter. In fact, I’m glad to see you. And if your intention is to get black-out drunk, you’ve come to the right person.”
“Come on, come on… it’s a bit of a squeeze, really, but I like having it on me… there!”
He gasped as the water stopped falling abruptly at his hand, and started filling the space in the air above his palm. It looked almost as if he was holding a large, invisible bowl, except that the water became a pulsating sphere, like a dew drop as big as a quaffle, growing every moment as more water poured in from above. He pulled it gently out of the way of the shower’s stream, and turned it this way and that, admiring the way the light refracted. Then he imagined what he wanted again and laughed as the globe of water immediately twisted upwards, lengthening and spiralling until it took the shape of a cobra, rearing and displaying and spitting in his face.
Great. Yeah. He already knew he was pathetic, thanks.
Draco didn’t look. He watched as Potter pulled that cloak over himself and disappeared.
“What? Oh, come on, Potter - it’s just a little cut and a few drops of blood, once a month. That’s all I have to do, and all I’m asking my descendants to do. Is that so much, for a chance at eternal life?”
His father lifted his chin, and for a moment looked as regal as he once had. “You have already made me proud, Draco. And I am sorry for - for all the ways I have failed you. I know you will be a better man than me.”
This woman truly did have a natural air of authority. For a strange moment, Draco felt as if he was in the presence of his mother. To his surprise, he discovered that he would rather lie down on the bed than humiliate himself with a silly tantrum. So, with a heave and a hop that was becoming more practised every time, he got up onto his crutches and followed her across the room.
“The wood-elf thing?”
. Here he had been so caught up in how far away he was from the Wizarding world and the war had made it here too, into the heart of muggle London. He couldn’t decide if that was reassuring or not.
Every move cautious and calculated, Draco successfully negotiated the shower rim and getting towelled off. He wished he had his wand for a quick drying charm. He contemplated his stinking clothes and curled his lip. He wished for his wand again so that he could banish the ruined clothes, but instead he just left them where they were and grabbed his shoes, swinging himself naked along the corridor, into his room, and over to his trunk on one crutch.
“Are you not worried about apparating right in front of about three hundred muggle windows?”
Draco nodded without thinking.
Potter nodded, clearly still uncomfortable. “I’ll, er - I just need to show Malfoy the tent and then we can get started.”
“Oh - right - yes, here - ”
The stiff black fabric of the chair creaked as he sat down. His cloak made it a little slippery to sit on. He sat with rigid posture, unable to relax. He thought about picking up the top magazine, but it didn’t look at all appealing and anyway, his breath was beginning to come short again. He worked to keep it silent in this quiet room so that the rude receptionist woman wouldn’t notice. He didn’t dare look directly at her, but he thought that he wasn’t imagining the glances she was giving him out of the corner of her eye. What did she think of him? He knew his discomfort must be obvious and he wanted to cringe.
Potter laughed briefly.
Anne Liston seemed to be able to read a lot of what he was feeling on his face, which was embarrassing. He wasn’t acting like a Malfoy at all, today.
“In the Manor - I have a stash of healing potions, and sleeping draughts. A large stash, over a hundred bottles.” Draco could see Pomfrey light up in his peripheral vision. “There’s nothing fancy, but there’s an array of basic pain-relief and blood-renewing potions, as well as a lot of Dreamless Sleep. I brewed them myself. I’m no Sn - no Potions Master, but Potter can attest that I’m a competent brewer. They’re hidden under the floor in my private study on the second floor of the East Wing.”
“Prudy, I - I want you to go and stay with your grandmother for a while, okay? Frona needs to know what happened, and she can look after you better than I can right now.”
Potter actually giggled. “I gotta say, it’s weird, but I’m beginning to like it.” He rolled his eyes at Draco’s expression. “Oh, come on. You’ve got to admit it’s sort of funny.”
“Pretty bad. It’s no
Draco knew he needed to lunge at his uncle, do
Shacklebolt brought his hands together.
His parents shared a glance over his head. He could sense their worry.
and Draco had been crushed in the corner near the door to the Entrance Hall, holding his breath with the rest of them as he attempted to follow each revelation.
you, and all you’d done was catch me crying.”
Potter backed away as if he could hear Draco’s internal chanting.
“No! No, I never - ”
“Master - Prudy is wanting to stay with you…”
“Maybe I’m a sweary drunk.”
That sounded like his cue to get moving. He turned his back on the Auror and started off down the corridor, keeping his left hand against the stone to help him as he hopped along. He couldn’t go fast and he knew this hopping looked ridiculous, but at this point, he was grateful for any cooperation his body could give him.
“Excellent. I can have my cauldrons brought over from the Manor.”
“Just swing your legs out first and then get your crutches ready.”
The tray held a simple meal of soup and bread rolls with a glass of water, and the plain heartiness was just what his tender stomach needed. A stasis charm had kept it all warm. Tucked under the soup bowl was a piece of parchment, and after Draco had finished half the soup - he wanted more but his stomach felt tight, like a warning - he read it.
, then, with the murderous tree growing in the middle of your kitchen? I thought that didn’t fit with the rest of the decor…”
“Yeah, of course, Harry. Give me twenty minutes and I’ll have this ward down and you’ll be able to get back in.”
“My driver in the taxi, and your Welcome Witch - your receptionist.”
Winky’s gaze flew to his, and she stood stricken on her stool as her eyes began to fill with tears.
Potter smiled again. “So you’ll wear it next time?”
“I see.” Like the Manor gate. He straightened his back as much as he could while using the crutches to balance on the top step. “Then if you each put a hand on one of my shoulders, I should be able to take you in with me.”
Draco stopped at a green-and-silver sofa, and lowered himself awkwardly onto it. He didn’t think he’d been asleep long. From the lake-light coming in from the windows, he’d guess it was still before midday. He arranged the crutches on the sofa next to him and tried not to shiver as he waited. It was damp and cold without any fires lit down here, but at least half of his shakiness came from the adrenaline still coursing through his system.
“Hello,
“Oh, I’m sorry. Well, you’re a little early, so if you’d like to take a seat in the waiting area, the doctor will come out and call for you when she’s ready.”
Potter laughed. Draco could feel himself blushing and he glared at the ceiling. He had thought the task ‘Explain yourself’ was non-lethal, but he’d likely die of embarrassment well before it was over.
Draco stuffed all the muggle money back into his pouch, not even bothering to try and count his change.
Draco almost wanted to smile at her. “I’m glad you were here.” Then he felt awkward. This was getting far too Hufflepuff. “So. What you’re saying is that the only punishment Peeves will be receiving is a strict telling-off.”
Although, of course, in Draco’s case, it didn’t matter how much warning he had about the topics, he would still have to tell Potter anything he asked. Draco’s chest tightened at the prospect of more of those forced confessions. Perhaps Potter was just messing him around with a bizarre double-bluff.
Just then, a loud
Potter frowned as he read, his lips pressed tight together. Draco felt himself deflate a bit as he waited, and he fidgeted with his shirt cuff. He hadn’t meant to show that list to anyone, least of all Potter, and he fought the impulse to snatch it back.
) just as she bent down, twisting a memory off her wand and into the channel at her feet. The memory poured down smoothly towards the natural pensieve - until Draco had to crawl over that same channel, the cloak dragging through the silver liquid, and McGonagall stood abruptly. Draco’s shaking hand landed right in it, and he felt the slippery, sacred memory coating his fingers and had to stifle a panted sob, and McGonagall turned her head sharply towards where the cloak was probably no longer fully concealing him -
By some miracle, or some hasty castle repairs, the showers still had running water. It was even warm. Draco laughed and praised the Gods for the fantastic sensation of sloughing off all the dirt of the past few days. The water winding towards the drain was grey with ash. As Draco reached for Goyle’s hair potion (his own phial was always in the prefect’s bathroom) it could have been a normal school day, except that a mess of bruises were blooming across his body and his right leg felt wobbly from the strain of keeping him upright on the treacherous, slippery tiles.
“Excellent. I am glad that is sorted out. Now, I have some questions regarding this spell you are currently under, Lord Malfoy. Harry tells me that it is called the Path of the Penitent? I confess, I had never even heard of it, and my assistants have been unable to find mention of it.”
“Oh - thanks - but there are loads of other things you’re needed for…”
At that, Potter tipped his head back and lost himself in proper laughter. The sound was too infectious to withstand. Draco felt an unwilling grin creep onto his face.
“And is young Master Malfoy
Before Draco could even reply, Potter had pulled him into the tight squeeze of apparition.
“He didn’t kill me, Myrtle,” Draco said quietly. “And you know he was the one who saved me this time.”
Draco had just registered the shape of a dim hallway as some gas-lights flickered into life, when an angry and vaguely familiar voice growled, “Severus Snape?”
“You’re comparing me to the sodding Dark Lord now, Potter? I’ll say it again: I haven’t killed anyone.”
“Potter. Please. Say something. I…”
for Gods’ sake! A couple of charms and no-one will have any idea you’ve been drinking all night, trust me.”
“I invoke the Path of the Penitent,” he gasped.
“I know enough, Mr Malfoy. I know this You-Know-Who fellow is essentially your standard wizard Hitler. I suppose he’s dead now?”
They sat in silence for a moment. Despite the vulnerability making his skin feel itchy, Draco was surprised to find that sitting here talking with Potter was a lot easier than he would have expected. He didn’t think Potter was going to call the Aurors over, and Draco was almost sure that Potter had decided this consciously and not just failed to realise the implications of Draco’s disadvantage.
One last desperate sweep with his eyes - they had to know he was speaking to
Draco gaped at him.
Draco grinned. It had worked! One simple question and Potter had given him a task.
Now then. The door in front of him was one huge slab of thick, heavy wood, and Draco felt the old magic stirring as he laid a hand against it. He was pretty sure he could transform it as he had the cane, but if the Path of the Penitent worked in the way that Frona said it would, he wouldn’t even need to do that.
“Why?”
“Look, I had some time to think it over, Malfoy, and I don’t want to use this enforced honesty thing against you. It wouldn’t be fair.”
Potter put his wand away, and saw Draco’s expression.
are the Lord, they will have a harder time justifying that. Even if you can find no way to get a more lenient sentence, they still have less to convict you with and so cannot take as much.”
“Headmistress. Minister.” He was surprised when they both gave him a polite nod.
“I don’t think I can take going to another funeral, Malfoy. But I can’t not go. I can’t. Maybe for some of them I could - but I have to be there, what the fuck am I thinking? They fought for
“Malfoy, can you hear me?”
“That’s fine, Winky, I know it’s a curse wound.”
“Yeah, I have - but I thought we were trying to get drunk here?”
Lestrange leered at him, his yellow face framed by his lank dark hair. He looked even taller from Draco’s position on the floor.
Draco sighed in relief as the urge to talk left him. “Thanks. Yeah, that’s a fair summary, Potter. Anyway, I’m starving, I skipped lunch - let’s eat.”
“You could stay at my house.”
So they both sat in silence for a good while, making it through another couple of fingers each. They appeared quite well-matched in drinking speed, although judging by the flush beginning to rise up Potter’s face, Draco easily took the lead in holding his alcohol.
They walked together to the edge of the road on one side of the square.
“Oh - Malfoy - my house is at twelve, Grimmauld Place, all right?”
Good.
Draco waited to see if Potter would go off on one about blood magic and old magic and how evil it all was, but his thoughts seemed to be going down a different track.
Draco nodded, and she stepped down from her stool, picked it up, and vanished with a crack.
He stumbled through making himself breakfast (another first). There wasn’t much to eat, since Potter had never actually done any food shopping last night, so Draco was reduced to eating some left-over plain rice from the curry. However, there were a few tea bags still left in the cupboard, and at least Potter had shown him how to use the kettle.
Potter reached for his right arm as the female Auror reached for his left. And once again, their hands couldn’t get within a foot of him.
Potter ran his hand through his hair. “Well, you know, Malfoy, you’ve always been a nasty git, but that doesn’t mean you deserved what Tom did to you. And Dumbledore. You were in an impossible position, and I don’t know if I’d have done any better in your place.”
The last time Draco had been in here, he had seen a low-ceilinged, dark room with a tiled floor. The tiles, in fact, were the room’s main and only feature. The entire floor was made from a detailed mosaic, showing static pictures of the Malfoy family tree going back seventy generations.
“It isn’t.” Draco could feel himself go pink at his clumsy interruption of the Minister, but he needed to set this straight. “I am now Lord of the Manor, and as I am not in the Ministry’s custody, the Manor and all the assets of the estate are under my ownership.”
Potter shrugged. “Damned if I know. It was probably really posh about two hundred years ago.”
Draco’s stomach twisted in disgust. He was no stranger to saving his own skin, but turning on his own father?
“I’ll just move the seat back a bit further, hold on…”
don’t even know what I was thinking wearing my cloak, apart from being constitutionally unable to stand the thought of wearing that Cannons sweater.”
Draco huffed a laugh, even though he felt dreadfully shaky. Gryffindors were so naive.
No house-elf had ever looked at Draco the way Frona was doing now: direct, calm, and cooly appraising. His instinct was to reprimand her for her forwardness, but he stifled it. She was free, ancient and powerful, and Draco couldn’t force her to do anything. It wasn’t the first time that his only hope depended on a house-elf, and no matter how demeaning it might be, he would willingly beg her to help him if necessary.
Madam Pomfrey crossed her arms. “Well, first of all, as I keep saying, the Baron is protecting you.” She nodded up at the ghost, who became more visible for a moment. Draco met his eyes. The grim Slytherin ghost never talked to any of the students and he didn’t talk now, but his haunted gaze met Draco’s and he gave him a short nod, before turning back to face the rest of the ward.
Lestrange knelt down over him, and Draco felt spittle land on his face as his uncle continued in a much angrier tone. “Well, it’s all gone to
Draco jerked his head round, ignoring Madam Pomfrey’s admonition at the movement. Potter’s light brown cheeks were flushing darker. McGonagall was also looking at him with raised eyebrows.
Pity flickered in her eyes again for a moment before being hidden under her ever-present practicality. “Right. I believe that, while the missing muscle can never be restored, the remaining muscle can be strengthened. It cannot be strengthened directly with magic, so it will involve a muggle technique called physiotherapy, which consists of several types of guided exercises - ”
Potter scowled.
“Wow,” said Potter hoarsely. “They weren’t kidding…”
“So do you have the Elder wand in that pouch too, then? Actually, why aren’t you using it?”
Potter gave him a relieved smile as he jumped out of his seat. “Okay. I’ll be back to tidy up - like I said - er, yeah.” He was already backing out of the tent as he spoke, and stumbled as he turned away.
Lestrange was grunting with each downward thrust of his hips. Draco gagged as he felt his uncle stiffening through their robes. Lestrange moved his wand arm across Draco’s throat, leaning his weight on his forearm so that Draco couldn’t breathe. This left Lestrange’s other arm free to release Draco’s hair and reach down between them, fumbling to push aside the folds of Draco’s robes, and with a sick lurch of fear Draco felt rough fingers find the top button of his trousers…
Anne Liston sat back in her chair, and gave him a long, level look. “Ah. I see.”
Myrtle sniffed and blew her nose loudly on a large, ghostly handkerchief. Still not appeased, then.
“About the size of it, yeah.”
“Doesn’t seem like much of a difference, Malfoy.”
“How much of this stuff do you have to drink before it all goes away?”
“What the hell did he do to you?”
“I know the spells. I’ll teach them to you.”
Madam Pomfrey sniffed. “No. It was badly hurt - I mean, it sustained severe structural damage in the battle. We lost our entire supply of healing potions, I have had to borrow from the emergency store at St Mungo’s. So unfortunately, I haven’t been able to be of much use, at a time when I am needed the most.” Draco could see that her eyes had started to shimmer with tears of frustration.
“Right. Um. I’m sorry, Malfoy.” Potter spoke softly.
“Well, it’s my leg. It - it’s probably easier to show you.”
Prudy followed him as he worked his way through the trees. She had summoned a small orb of light in front of herself, since for her this place was still a dark cellar. Draco watched bemused as she walked straight through one of the oak trees, but when Draco checked, it was solid and real beneath his hands.
“Malfoy - do you know what your mother did?”
Draco looked sideways at Potter, but he ignored Draco’s unspoken question. What a luxury. Potter was moving stiffly, not looking at him; Bill’s words had definitely had an impact. Draco wanted to say that he could just go find a hotel, but he couldn’t get the words unstuck from his throat. Potter swung round to face him at the entrance to the tent, his arms crossed tightly.
“Get moving, Malfoy, or I’ll make you move.”
“Coming up on twenty past, Potter.”
. He thought of Potter, and whether he would really keep the Malfoy family secrets, and what his new powers over wood and water could do. For a while he pondered on who else might be on the list of seven for the Path of the Penitent, but a thick swirl of guilt made his chest tight, and he wrenched his mind away before he could give himself a panic attack.
“It is a
Potter rubbed at the back of his neck with one hand, looking miserable. “Sorry, Bill, I - I want to, but - I, I can’t right now. I just can’t.”
Potter looked at him for a moment. “Right. I’m making you a cup of tea.” He turned around to the ruined kitchenette and sighed. “This may take a little longer than normal.”
He absently massaged the dip in his leg with one hand while he looked around the room. The windows were just openings into blackness, and shadows flickered across the armchairs and tables. He spotted a tray of food on Potter’s armchair. He suddenly realised how hollow he felt. He hadn’t eaten in days.
“Potter.”
“It will never be as strong as it was when it was whole. However, I am confident we can achieve meaningful rehabilitation here. If you work hard, you’ll be able to walk again without crutches, although there will still be some level of limp, and you will probably still use a cane for support. I doubt you’ll be able to run much, but a lot of other forms of exercise will be open to you.”
Prudy gaped at her grandmother. Then she started twisting her right ear painfully in her hand, her eyes darting to Draco, clearly torn between disappointing him and defying Frona.
Draco’s left fore-arm itched. He couldn’t keep it hidden under the covers forever. He wished he had his wand to cast a glamour over the Mark. He really didn’t want to draw Madam Pomfrey’s attention to it, but he had to do something about it before the bloody Minister of Magic got here. He withdrew his arm from the covers, wrapping his right hand over as much of the Mark as he could.
“Stop!” Draco cried, and the tree froze, as if it had grown naturally in this position. Lestrange went limp, unconscious. Draco’s breath grated in his throat, his mind wiped blank.
Didn’t see you doing much fighting. Typical Malfoy, always ready to let others do the real work, eh?”
“Mr Potter, the Headmistress, and the Minister.”
“Master is hurting himself… Master should take better care of himself…”
His chest seemed much the same, nothing new amongst the mess of old Sectumsempra scars. He drew his knees up, and suddenly hissed in pain as the muscles of his left calf spasmed.
Very deliberately - it almost seemed slightly reluctantly - Potter drew his wand too, and now Draco had three wands pointed at him.
Draco nodded his approval, and they both reached for a glass at the same time. They lifted the tumblers and clinked them together, and then Draco took a sip and Potter attempted to drain his whole measure in one go. He cut himself off, spluttering, after only one gulp.
“Absolutely. Alcohol made life worth living for a while there.”
“And the effects, in summary - correct me if I’m wrong - are to prevent you from being locked up, to clear you of all crimes in the eyes of the law, and to require you, under pain of death, to complete by the end of seven lunar cycles an act of penance for each of the seven people you have most wronged?”
Oh, right, the Dark Lord. Potter had called him ’Tom Riddle’ back in the Great Hall.
Shacklebolt began to move away, but Draco looked at the phial by his bedside and suddenly remembered something. “Wait!”
“Yes.”
“Harry, it is the least I can do. I am sure you could do with a place where you are guaranteed some privacy nowadays.”
, which is unheard of, Potter - but my mother. I knew already, but now I know for certain: she will
. Peeves was a permanent fixture. At least he couldn’t
“Oh God,” Potter said. His voice was thick but understandable. “It was - fucking
, dear,
“As I thought. Okay.” She span around in her chair and indicated a poster up on the wall behind her, showing various grisly medical diagrams of what parts of a person might look like without any skin. “So, muscles are formed from thousands of these long, rope-like bundles of muscle cells, and
Draco breathed a sigh of relief. No-one was injured, no-one new was dead. Potter looked frantic, however.
Potter was frowning, and was about to say something, but just then the door opened and the other two visitors arrived. Potter hastily stood up from where he’d been sitting on the mattress.
Potter chuckled and stood up, going to the bedroom to collect the blankets from all four bunks. He threw them over towards the fireplace. “You take this pretty seriously, don’t you?”
“Yes, Potter, he is. Dear old uncle Rodolfus. He’s always had a
“Ah. Right. That’s - ”
Draco nodded, and turned to Madam Pomfrey.
“Father - we must flee, now, before they come for you - ”
“Thought so.”
It helped a little. Draco kept his mask in place, kept glaring.
Draco chose the chair that kept his back to the wall so he could keep an eye on the receptionist. He noticed a stack of magazines (why was everything so shiny around here?), with strange, stationary photos plastered across the cover.
I never noticed that.”
Potter actually giggled. “You wore a cloak and a
“It was in the forest. After I - after Tom hit me with the Killing Curse. He made her come over to check on me. She could feel my pulse, but she bent over me and whispered - well - she asked if you were alive, and in the castle.”
Potter stared at him, and then actually covered his face and groaned.
“Oh that’s funny, cauldron, I didn’t know you knew my good friend kettle?”
He froze.
“A lot of the magical world does, Potter. Diagon Alley?”
She placed the stool by the sofa and hopped onto it, which gave her just enough height to be able to reach out her hands and hold them above Draco’s body. She closed her eyes and concentrated, a small frown-line forming between her brows. Draco noticed that her hands were shaking with a very slight, constant tremor.
Madam Pomfrey nodded, lips pursed. “Well, as you have probably deduced, I’m afraid that as it is an injury inflicted by the darkest kind of curse magic, there are no spells or potions which can heal it - ”
“Yes. I am all the Malfoy you could handle, Potter.”
Where had Potter got
He gripped his crutches tighter. Was he or was he not a Malfoy? Did he or did he not own Malfoy Manor? And he thought
Once the pain had faded back to the normal background ache he finally looked up. Potter looked slightly concerned, and the spell immediately demanded he explain. “Leg, Potter. It has a hole in it. Remember? Not enough muscle left, so it cramps up, leading to embarrassing lapses in my ability to remain upright.”
Potter caught sight of the clean white bandage around his left forearm and frowned. “Are you hurt? I thought Madam Pomfrey had fixed your wrist - ”
Potter rolled his eyes. “You wish, Malfoy. On three?”
“Mm-hmm.”
“Oh - it’s over. The war. It finished last week.”
. A note beside her name said that Greyback had got her.
“Potter. I can’t fly anymore.”
Draco snorted. “Yes. My mother was a Black, Potter. As the last remaining male of the Black line, if my cousin had died without a will,
“Oh, for goodness’ sake, Harry, didn’t you set a wand alarm?”
They walked along just below the grassy rim of the bowl until they were nearly directly opposite where they’d entered. Draco cringed at the sound of his crutches on the stone, but although plenty of people looked up to watch Potter go past, the cloak seemed to be mercifully effective. When they came to where the last person in line stood - it was someone Draco vaguely recognised from a couple of years ahead of him at Hogwarts, possibly a Ravenclaw - Andromeda took up the next available circle, Potter the one behind her, and Draco the one after that.
hadn’t explained enough to satisfy the spell. “I-I wouldn’t do it. So he
You’re not the only one who’s ever wronged someone, for God’s sake!”
“Oi! Hey! They’re doing blood magic!” The someone from the other table had started to shout. Draco registered a flurry of movement as people stood up from the benches around them.
“Sir is happy to let Winky touch sir?”
Potter laughed. “Why am I not surprised? Look, I’m not much better, to be honest - I have a tiny bit of an idea, but I’ve never eaten Indian food either and I
He began struggling madly, writhing against the ropes, trying to find some leverage with which to push up off the floor. But there was none. Lestrange growled and pressed down even harder on Draco’s windpipe, and Draco’s panic reached new heights as his vision began to blur from lack of oxygen. In desperation, his right hand tightened around the cane down by his thigh, and he wished it was his wand. The rough wood of the cane felt friendly, almost comforting, and Draco thought wildly of the ancient tree down in the cellar, and wished it was here to reach down with strong branches and knock Lestrange out of the way, shield Draco, encircle him in safety -
Draco was still facing her when he heard the door bang open and a man behind him starting to shout a spell. He whipped round, cursing his lapse of attention, but his left leg cramped at the sudden movement, and he crashed down onto his knees. The fall saved him, as a bolt of green light flew close over the top of his head and exploded against the far wall.
“Madam Pomfrey - please… could you help me cover this up?” He kept his gaze trained on a vaulted corner of the ceiling.
The rest of the food turned out to be just as unfamiliar and delicious, but far more sensibly spiced. There were triangular packages of pea and potato called samosas, a large and rather shapeless type of doughy flat-bread, called naan, and another curry called a chicken tikka masala. Draco regarded this one with utmost suspicion, but after watching Potter eat a few mouthfuls with evident enjoyment and without reaching for his water, he had a taste and found it just on the right side of bearable.
Draco nodded. He already knew that, from when he’d read
He stepped forward, only to have his hand grabbed again by a muttering house-elf.
It was about seven in the evening when Potter came bursting into the tent. Draco was sitting in the chair trying to count the remaining muggle money; he was getting his nerve up to go and buy some food from somewhere, but his hunger had not yet got worse than his reluctance to face the muggle world twice in one day.
“Yes. I have to atone to the seven people who I’ve most badly wronged. Each of those people need to set me a task, and I have seven cycles of the moon to make sure they’re all done. If I fail to complete all the tasks by then, I will start to get sick. If I’ve not completed the tasks by the end of the next full moon, then I will die, and then return as a ghost.”
And then Potter had said that someone had taken the Elder Wand from Dumbledore before he died, and the shock of realisation had hit him like a fist to the gut moments before Potter said it:
“This is so weird, Malfoy. Anyway, why wouldn’t I be nice to you?”
Potter started tugging at a string around his neck, extracting a pouch from under his robes - the pouch that held Draco’s wand. For one wild moment Draco thought that Potter might be about to give it back, but instead Potter started pulling what seemed like acres of silvery material from out of the small pouch.
Draco felt a shudder grip his chest for a moment.
get to tell you what to do, no matter who you were. And she certainly seemed to know a fair amount about the human body. If she said he would be disabled for life, then he probably would be.
Draco grabbed one of the crutches off the floor, and with that under one arm and his other hand against the desk, he got enough leverage to hop up onto his right foot. He turned towards the desk and the doctor rolled herself behind him, where she could finally get a clear view of the hole in his leg.
“Anyway.” Potter looked awkward. “I thought the Path of the Penitent thing stopped people from hurting you?”
“And you couldn’t have just asked her?”
“No, I forgot, I’m sorry - ”
“Are there no other options, Madam Pomfrey?”
was a bitch.”
“Leave him alone, Myrtle. He’s not a murderer, despite his best efforts.”
Potter barked a laugh as he flopped down onto the bench, and Draco felt a small flare of victory in his chest, and had to suppress a smile. He hopped up onto his crutches and swung himself into the tiny kitchenette as he kept talking.
“Hey. Hey. Malfoy. It’s all right.”
He collapsed on a different sofa, since he couldn’t use a cleaning charm on the one where he’d slept and there were grimy smudges of ash on the silk. It was only after he sat down that he realised he was breathing hard. He didn’t feel exhausted, but certainly a lot more tired than he should have been given that all he’d done was have a shower and got dressed. Judging by the strength of the light now coming through the lake, it had also taken a lot longer than it normally did.
“I care a fair amount, actually. Prudy is my friend.”
After the post had delivered the second crutch, it twisted itself back into its old carved spiral shape, looking almost smug. The only difference now was that it had lost its dark varnish, and two knot marks indicated where it had grown the crutches.
Draco’s heart sank.
consider still talking to you.”
give the suspect a heads-up about what’s going to be discussed.
“Apparently not. I must say, though, that I
“Hey, look, I’m sorry, Potter. I would if I could. I just don’t think it’d be very respectful.”
Draco scooped a hand under the tiny whirlpool and raised it up to hover closer in front of his face. He imagined what he wanted, putting as much detail into the image as he could manage. It seemed a little more difficult than when he’d formed the cobra, possibly because he didn’t have much water to work with, but still the water immediately stopped spinning and reshaped into the shape of a broomstick - with a tiny Potter riding on top of it. You couldn’t really tell it was Potter, of course, the face was too smooth, but there was an indication of quidditch robes.
He turned and swung himself towards the door, where Potter was waiting. As Potter went through ahead of him, he saw where they were going. It was the Great Hall - the temporary hospital wing had been set up in the room behind the Staff Table.
“Right. I’ll see you soon.”
Anne Liston’s voice was stern, and Draco felt sufficiently rebuked.
Prudy’s eyes suddenly filled with tears. “Oh - well - Prudy was hoping… b-but Prudy understands if - ”
“Yes, of course.”
“No, the door’s fine. I… I’m scared, Potter, all right? Of going through the Hall, having people see me. I don’t want to be attacked. By them or by Peeves.”
Peeves had stopped above the pile of rubble. His face looked
Draco had a moment’s blurred insight into how much Potter’s parents could have added to his life, and how much was missing. But Potter looked more excited than wistful. He was busy levitating the table to the centre of the tent and bringing out a couple of plates and cheap cutlery.
“You better believe it. And I’m sure you weren’t swearing quite as much a moment ago.”
The woman was too rude to break the silence and do her job, so Draco would have to do it for her. He moved forwards towards her desk and said, “My name is Draco Malfoy, I have an appointment with healer - er, with Anne Liston?”
If this was Pansy, or even Blaise, Draco would have already moved to wrap his arm around them, let their head fall down onto his shoulder. It would have surprised his parents to know how touchy-feely he was with his close friends, although never Crabbe or Goyle. He half-wished he could muster the courage to do it now, simply because Potter so clearly needed a hug. But it wasn’t Draco’s place to assume such a role.
Draco wondered if he’d ever get used to hearing himself addressed by his father’s title. “I am glad to be of help, Minister.”
“Goyle? I didn’t see his name on the list of…”
“Yes.
There wasn’t chance for any of the pomp and ceremony that would normally go along with this. But luckily, at heart, the magic was very simple, and ancient. It didn’t even require any specific words, or a wand.
He only realised that he had distracted himself quite nicely with his internal ranting when the taxi drew up right in front of him. It was large and shiny-black and conveniently had ‘taxi’ written in a small glowing orange sign at the front of the roof. He had never been so close to a moving car and he nearly lost his balance as he jumped backwards, triggering a spasm in his leg when he landed awkwardly. He hissed and squeezed his eyes shut as he waited for the pain to pass.
“I got us Indian again, hope that’s okay,” said Potter, his voice scratchy.
Risking a quick glance, Draco saw Potter looking down into his lap where he held the whiskey tumbler. It was pretty clear that he was trying not to cry.
Draco squeezed back and took a couple of deep breaths.
“Harry, if you would be willing to confirm that with Lord Malfoy yourself, then that would certainly satisfy me.”
For a moment it struck him that, however uncertain his future was, he was most likely stuck as a cripple for life. Every stupid little task was going to be that much more difficult. He would have to be constantly guarding his movements to prevent his calf muscle from searing with pain.
The red light shot directly towards him and Draco flinched - but the spell never hit him. Potter stared at him, looking stunned himself. Draco carefully laid Prudy on the table and used one hand on the table’s surface to support him as he limped around it until he was facing the three people under the tree. Distantly, he knew that the compulsion driving him forwards was the tea doing its work. He fell to his knees in front of a nonplussed Potter, bowed his head, and said, “I have wronged you. I beg your forgiveness.”
