Draco's emotions flutter between anger and humiliation. "Sod off!" He manages to snarl. "Filthy Mu-" This time it isn't his breathing that cuts him off. He presses his lips together, eyes clenching shut and flinching at the word he was about to say. "Just- Sod off," He pants weakly. He isn't entirely sure why he didn't say it, internally he frowns at himself. It had been like that since some point during his Sixth year. After the summer and the things he'd witnessed, the word felt heavier on his tongue and the sound of it made his stomach turn. Draco had forced himself to say it, sneering the word even as he began not to believe it. He’d thought it might be easier that way, that listening to their screams might be easier to hear if he thought of them solely as Mudbloods instead of actual humans. After all, it had worked so well for the Death Eaters causing the screams.
The closer he gets the less he can breathe and Draco slashes his wand, drawing a burning line on the floor between them. It glows like heated coal before cooling but the Order members look down at it as if it'll strike them. He can't fathom why they're being so gentle with him. The Death Eaters would had cursed him by now. He'd be writhing under a Crucio, not for information, but for their amusement.
"Fin-" He whispers, voice shaking and barely audible. His wand wavers where it's pointed at Sirius. "
Potter ducks and the spell hits the Centaur's arm, sending it spinning through the air before it lands by the handsome wizard's head. Draco's head lolls slightly. With the sudden break he'd given himself his adrenaline had burnt through, and he's left feeling sluggish. The pain of his injuries sting now, and he feels exhausted and over extended.
"Y'know Bella" A voice yells and they both whirl to the source. Sirius Black stands atop the dais, eyes sharp but grin lazy as he stares down his cousin. "I always did like Andy more."
before ducking an off fired curse and making his way to Tonks to do the same. His Aunt is mere feet away, cackling manically as she fires one vicious spell after another. Despite her speed, Draco is quicker. Her spells bounce off of his shield charms, each popping up at random in front of her targets until she snarls, turning and baring her teeth. He thinks bitterly that she should be proud at him for so easily getting under an opponent's skin. She had been his teacher after all.
"He was there!" A wizard cries, in blood red robes. He babbles about the Dark Lord to a paling Cornelius Fudge and Draco wonders how he's made such an arse of this already. He isn't sure how he's meant to get the two of them out of the Ministry. Draco watches with dazed eyes as officials bustle around them, Aurors marching in a steady line to the lifts, ready to take the Death Eater's into custody. The Death Eaters. His Father. Draco has to stifle his delirious laugh. The Order members and The D.A. slowly move into the Atrium, each injured or dirtied in some way.
Draco scoffs. "Well my role isn't to be stood in the dirt chattering with you." Firenze's voice stops him as he turns to leave.
"The shields." Kingsley clarifies. "They were protecting us." Tonks had been unconscious from her fall off the steps during the skirmish before he'd woken her. It was unsurprising that she was unaware. Kingsley takes a step closer, shoulders lowered in an attempt to make his imposing figure seem more friendly. It's unsuccessful. "Weren't you?"
It's the same demanding tone she'd used in his lessons. This time Draco feels brave enough to ignore her. The first spell to leave his wand is a flash of green light that she blocks. They grow from there, each one faster, each one more vicious than before. He uses every spell in his arsenal, every spell she'd ever taught him and unleashes it all in a barrage of light and colour, the magic making his wand hiss and thrum. At first Bellatrix whirls wildly with unrestrained rage before her eyes land on the blood dripping from his arm. She cackles victoriously.
"Which is why you need to." Granger says. "Copy me." He listens to the exaggerated inhale and exhales of her breathing. He struggles to mirror them and closes his eyes until he slips easier into the pattern. "There we go," she encourages. His cheeks burn from the vulnerability of the situation. She stays there until his breathing is shaky but regular and Draco grows tenser, pulling his knees to his chest and staring at her from lowered lids. Granger stares back at him. She looks as she always has, dark skin only a few shades lighter than her eyes, the curls that halo her face are as untamed as always, but her expression is different. It's not full of contempt or pity, it's open and curious, as though he's the cover of new book she's discovered. His stare turns into a glare and she huffs, standing and smoothing her hands over her robes as if it can neaten the wrinkles from where she'd been knelt beside him. "You should see Madam Pomfrey." Granger says before arching a brow at his blank expression. "For your arm," she clarifies before tacking on, "and also for a calming draught." The Witch turns to leave.
"One of you is hurt." He says, with a frown, having scented the iron in the air, he takes in the blood on the floor but doesn't comment further. They're making no effort to forcibly reveal him but Draco still remains wary. "Are you the ones that helped us earlier?"
"Come on!" Sirius jeers, "you can do better than that!" Bellatrix cries out in rage. Her next spell flies over his head in a blur of red light. The second finds purchase in his chest. The laughter hasn't fully died on his lips even as his eyes widen in shock. It seems like an age as the spell hits them, and then he falls, body curved in a graceful arc as he sags backwards towards the archway. Draco is there to catch him. The room is silent save for the thundering crack of his Apparation. He lands quickly, a body blockade between the Heir of The House of Black and impending death. There's a ghostly feeling at his back, the whispering beckoning him, tendrils of mist leaning towards him as if seeking an embrace. He grips Sirius tight and spins so quickly his entire presence lasts no less than a second. They land in the Atrium, a mess of tangled limbs. Draco turns, laying Sirius on the cold floor, his chest rises shallowly, face shining with sweat. Unconscious, but alive.
Draco feels as though he may be hinting at something more than the Thestral and the thought makes his skin prickle uncomfortably.
"You and Dumbledick-" The class cries out, both offence and encouragement. He talks over the noise. "You and Dumbledick don't give a Troll's arse about any of us unless we're wearing red."
"Department of Mysteries." The cool voice of the Ministry says and Draco keeps his wand in his hand as he walks forward, past the protection of the lift's golden gates. The corridor is so dark his pale skin seems to glow, and the flickering torches mounted on the wall are the only source of light. He'd been here before; once as a child and several times when he'd felt older than his bones. The only noise is his footsteps as he approaches the black door. They echo uncomfortably in the quiet and Draco takes slow breaths to steady himself. He's buzzing with energy, adrenaline rushing in preparation of what he'll face, and magical core insistent on any type of release. It's swollen, feeling far too big for his skinny form and he hopes he'll be able to cope with his fully matured magic in an immature body.
"I'll fetch a teacher!" She proclaims suddenly. Draco can't tell if it's out of concern or a want to get a student out of her usually empty bathroom.
A familiar jangling noise comes from his right and Draco's head jerks up, pulling Sirius' body backwards and disillusioning him too. He can feel his own flickering before he reinforces it, placing himself defensively between Sirius and whoever is coming their way. He isn't expecting it when his Aunt rushes from the lift, grin unhinged as she rushes towards the telephone lift. Another creaking noise and a second lift arrives. Potter runs out before the golden gates are fully opened, and Draco watches his Aunt turn, firing a spell in Potter's direction. The boy hero ducks, diving behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren. The golden gates ring like a bell as the spell hits them instead of it's intended target. Bellatrix stops running, instead she turns, hip cocked and head tilted as she stares at the Fountain.
He stumbles when he lands, his usual grace foreign to limbs he's yet to grow into. His arrival is almost silent, and he lands in a shadowy patch of the room. Draco still takes care to disillusion himself non verbally as he takes stock of the room. There are ten Death Eaters, all of them with their gazes fixed firmly on the Boy Who Lived. Potter stands on the raised dais, in front of a whispering arch. Clutched firmly in his hand is a glass prophecy, in the other his wand, warily raised. His dark complexion is the palest Draco has ever seen, his eyes tight and the turn of his lips painfully desperate. It takes a moment for Draco to realise why. Longbottom lays at his Aunt's feet in a pile of sweat and tears. The remnants of the Cruciatus curse lingers heavily in the air like a sour smell.
"Bella," he says, voice cold and high. "My faithful servant." His wand lifts towards her, and her eyes light, ready to receive his merciful help. "You have disappointed me." The Dark Lord says. "
The Wizard's chest seizes. He'd just killed his Aunt, surely it wouldn't be too much to kill his Professor. He'd only
"Fin-" He whispers, voice shaking and barely audible. His wand wavers where it's pointed at Sirius. "Finite Incantatum." Sirius flicks into existence and there are startled exclamations echoing in the Atrium. Lupin's wand almost cracks beneath his grip and he all but falls at Sirius' side. His hands go to his cheeks, disbelieving and grey eyes matching Draco's flick open.
"Yes." The Wolf says simply, ignoring Tonks' hiss of protest. There's moments of nothing but silence and Draco watches the Order members shift restlessly. His goal had been to save Sirius and he'd done that.
It doesn't. Instead Draco is spat into his body, slamming into it with such awareness that his conscious breaks through the stunning spell that his past self had fell victim to. The Bat Bogey Hex has subsided and Draco sits up slowly, stomach rolling and green around the gills. He takes in the room around him with trepidation. Scattered around the room are his fellow Slytherins, all younger than he remembers. Their faces are flushed with life, clear of the haggard expressions that had followed them around. Relief blooms in his chest. It's smothered by fear.
There's a shift of wind and a soft pop, much softer than what accompanies Apparation and Draco relaxes somewhat, realising Potter and his posse have gone.
Instead he finds the statue shielding Potter, Dumbledore sweeping into the room, face filled with righteous fury. Draco's breath sounds more like a startled sob of relief. No-one hears him, everything falls on deaf ears and he's fine with that. Instead he focuses on patting the ground in front of him, desperate frustration building as he tries to find Sirius. There's a crash and spells whirling behind him ad he watches as the statue protecting Potter suddenly thrusts him in their direction. It's at that moment that his hand brushes Sirius' chest. Draco sags, exhausted and finds himself leaning against him, slouching over his cousin's body, anchoring himself to the feel of the rising and falling chest. The world passes by him in a dull roar and he feels the full effects of what he's done. The time travel had been bad enough, wild magic utilised to send him years back was a draining feat. Accompanied by the apparations and the duels... it's a miracle he hasn't passed out. A lesser Wizard would have.
Her face appears suddenly in front of his, ghostly form leaning through the wall of pipes beneath the sinks. He'd spent enough time with her antics in Sixth year, so Draco doesn't so much as blink.  Myrtle seems both curious and disappointed in his lack of reaction.
Potter's spell bounces off a silent shield and Voldemort turns, shoulders heaving as if he's a tired and disappointed parent berating his child. "Did you parents not teach you to wait your turn, Harry Potter?" He asks lightly and Draco can picture the smile on his face as he says; "Oh, I suppose they never got the chance. Such a shame." Potter's features twist with fear and rage but Draco staggers away as silently as he can, stomach rolling and desperate to leave. "You have irked me far too often, for far too long" Voldemort says as Draco drops to his knees where he'd laid Sirius. "
The blonde is deaf to the word that leaves the Saviour's lips but he's not numb to the pain. Magic slices through his skin, but it's not like a knife through butter. Instead it's like a pinprick, before the gap widens and the skin pulls itself apart. There's tension in the act, like pulling damp clothes from your skin, but it persists and each cut opens with overwhelming agony. He can feel the tears on his skin again and sobs openly, breaths wet and ragged. It's too much for his body to bear and his eyes close.
"Mas-ter-" Bellatrix gurgles wetly, iron fills the air as blood leaves her body. There's no Snape with his singing hymn this time, the spell's victim lays on the cold hard ground, with no warmth to keep her company.
"Stop!" Sirius and Lupin say but the others don't hear them over their spell casting. It's harder to dodge the spells now that Moody's fake eye seems to be able to see his silhouette and his steps turn into a manic and desperate dash.
Myrtle's bathroom is as he remembers it from before the war. The large mirror is still spotted and cracked, the sinks riddled with various chips. The floor is damp beneath his knees as he sinks to it, and he's thankful that in the dim light he can't fully see his reflection. Draco always struggled to look at it after his marking. He never looked different, not at first, but he could feel it. His magic felt tainted,
the letters spell. The Werewolf looks surprised and the letters flicker slightly with Draco's waning energy. After sending a look to the others, the man steps forward, one cautious step after another until he reaches the line. It shifts suddenly, slithering over the floor like the snake he'd conjured in second year. It settles behind Lupin, encompassing him into Draco's side of the line whilst shutting the others out. Tonks and Kingsley start forward, both reluctant and concerned whilst Moody watches on with a glint in both eyes that makes Draco shiver. Lupin makes no move forward and Draco takes an audible breath, pointing his wand to his own temple and casting the spell that makes lucidity wash over him. It has less effect on him than it had before but he's thankful for the clarity nonetheless.
"I know." He says blankly. The voice is referring to the bathroom, Draco is referring to so much more. He shouldn't be in this time, in this alternate life he's just created. He shouldn't be in Hogwart's after all he's done,
"No favouritism among the houses?" He tips his head back, laugh incredulous, when it lowers his lips are turned down into bitter grin. "Look me in the eye and tell me that anyone else would've received the same treatment. That any Slytherins would've received the same treatment-"
He can't cast a shield fast enough, but nothing stops him from turning. The crack echoes in the air and as Draco appears behind her. She turns, face written with anger and horror and Draco smiles, feeling something vicious and victorious as he presses his wand to her throat.
"You're asking me?" She says, bewildered and Draco remembers just how little kindness she'd received before their first meeting.
"That is true," Firenze says with a low hum. "Everything has it's time... But, you could change that. You could save it."
"I'm not going anywhere." She snaps after a moment of nothing but his frightened breaths. "Are you going to stop acting like a spoilt child and let me help you? Or shall I leave you here for someone else to find?"
Draco flinches and turns, heart in his throat and expecting to see Potter's body laid lifeless on the floor.
Draco's summon is silent but it's strong and the Prophecy comes towards him with speed that rivals a Snitch. Heads jerk towards it as it moves, but no-one has time to follow it's path completely as two doors open high above them. Five figures sprint into the room and Draco shrinks the prophecy to the size of a marble, tucking it into his breast pocket. There's a quietly whispered spell to prevent anyone Accioing it from him and he watches as Nymphadora Tonks sends a stunning spell towards his Father. It misses but Draco compensates by sending his own. He's torn between hurt and relief as it hits it's mark. The spells rain down, a cacophony of magic as the Order members work their way to the sunken floor. The spells stream by in bursts of light and Draco sticks close to the edge of the room, fingers tight around his wand. A flash of red light works it's way towards Potter, too preoccupied crawling to Longbottom to notice and Draco meets it with his own spell, sending it wildly off course. It veers left and hits a Death Eater, sending him crashing into the wall with such a force that the crack of his head meeting stone is loud in the room. As Dolohov goes down, Kingsley Shacklebolt looks around with furrowing brows before settling into a duelling stance and facing his next opponent. Draco is so focused firing spells and erecting hastily cast
They stare at each other in a silent stalemate and Draco looks away tiredly, head hanging as he tries to come up with a plan. He hears a huff and the shuffle of robes moving towards the lift as Fudge leaves.
She bristles. "I have better things to do than gossip about you." As her hand slips over the door and she pulls it open, Draco lowers his head and swallows thickly.
The days he spent casting it on others under threat of his own torture. The way she'd forced him to kill, to torture to tear lives apart and laughed every time. Righteous anger could not hurt her for long.
to kill a teacher before, this time he saw no way he wouldn't succeed. "I'd ask why you're talking in riddles, but it's no surprise that only nonsense leaves your lips. I doubt you have the capability for much else." His wand spins idly in his hand, typical Malfoy disinterest painted on his face. Firenze can't know. There's nothing for Firenze
The curse fires instinctively. It's an automatic response, a muscle memory born from months with Death Eaters for company. At first he doesn't even see the Gryffindor. His spell is aimed at the snarling fangs of Fenrir. At the sadistic Carrows. At Aunt Bella. It takes two more spells for him to remember he's at Hogwarts not the manor, and it's Potter that his duelling. His eyes sting as much as the mark on his arm.
- righteous anger won't hurt me for long." Her wand raises. "I'll show you how it's done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson - " Potter edges around the side of the fountain as she screams; "
. Draco closes his eyes and when he opens them again, green eyes stare back at him. They're too identical in shade to the Killing Curse and his chest tightens further.
"Go-" He tries to say through hitching breaths. His skin feels like a tight cage around his bones. "-Away."
"You fought with us too, didn't you?" Lupin cuts in, clearly remembering the cutting curse that had felled one of the Death Eaters. The letters appear again.
"No!" His protest is soft but strong and he can sense the vague chill of her presence beside him. "I jus'...need to...rest." Draco tries to assure her. "Can I...res' here?"
I don't know whether I like this chapter or not, but I'll let you know that I happen to love the next one.
. It's weak and dull, packed with enough force to knock her off her feet with a pained cry, but not enough hatred to inflict the true unbearable pain. Draco thinks of the time he's tried to
"This is my bathroom." Myrtle says petulantly. "Everything was ruined in my life, now you come ruining my death!" She huffs.
"You're asking me?" She says, bewildered and Draco remembers just how little kindness she'd received before their first meeting.
"Granger," he calls and she pauses in the doorway. The Gryffindor turns her head to face him, eyes narrowed and nostrils flaring, clearly expecting an insult. "Thank you." Draco says quietly, and he's surprised by how much he means it. The shock of his thanks seems to fry the few brain cells she has and Granger stares at him, mouth slightly agape before she nods slowly and walks through the door.
Potter in Myrtle's bathroom. It had been desperation and rage, much like Potter's now. Bellatrix's shock gives way to bubbling laughter and she climbs to her feet.
There's a shift of wind and a soft pop, much softer than what accompanies Apparation and Draco relaxes somewhat, realising Potter and his posse have gone.
felt tainted after the Dark Lord's brand had sunken into his skin. He crawls towards the sinks, pulling himself up and running one of the taps. It squeaks beneath his hand and his fingers catch on an odd engraving on it's side. He pays no attention to it, instead he groans in frustration as no water meets him and grabs the next one, turning it quickly and almost crying as cool water rushes from it. Draco sticks his head under it, inside his mind he can hear his Father's echoing voice berating him for doing something so muggle and improper. Except his father wouldn't be berating him. Not any longer. Not now Draco had ensured his captivity in Azkaban. Eventually he slumps to the side, leaving the tap running as he presses his forehead to the chipped sink in front of him.
"You should ignore them," He tells her, eyes fluttering. "You don't deserve it, Myrtle." She never had. It was part of why he had connected with her so heavily in the past- the future. She had been misunderstood and alone, unable to do anything about her circumstances. Draco had been put in a far too similar predicament. Myrtle stares at him from behind her round glasses and Draco struggles to keep his eyes on her. Bile rises suddenly in his throat and he turns to the side, retching onto the cold floor. Myrtle shrieks at the mess whilst he heaves. It's his own fault. It's the fallback of magical exhaustion; a consequence of all he's done in the space of a few hours. He presses his back against the sinks, pushing himself away from the pile of vomit, not having the strength to so much as raise his wand, let alone spell it away. His head droops, chin touching his chest.
Draco sits beside him, ears ringing and chest heaving. He's aware then, of the ache in his ribs and dampness of his cheek and arm. He looks down, detached and suddenly exhausted as he takes into the account the vicious cut on his arm. The rush of the fight had left him unaware, but he watches the blood drip down in rivulets, soaking his fingers and staining the wood of his wand. He needs to go. He knows that, from what he remembers, Dumbledore would be here soon, then Voldemort himself and then the Aurors. Draco doesn't want to risk being caught by them, nor did he want to risk Sirius being sent back to Azkaban.
his eye, dropping it in disgust as it hits his hand and leaves it by Moody's side. It spins in it's socket, and Draco gets the feeling it can see him. The thought makes his shudder so he hurriedly casts an
" - See here Dumbledore! You haven't got authorisation for that Portkey!" Draco doesn't lift his eyes from where they're staring blankly at the floor, but he can imagine the redness of Fudge's face. "You can't do things like that right in front of the Minister for Magic, you - you - " His voice falters and Dumbledore's voice drops to something low. Draco doesn't care enough to listen in. The presence in the Atrium is quickly dwindling and the Slytherin hopes if he waits long enough he can get them both into a floo discretely enough.
Her laugh is the only answer he receives and Draco watches with rapt attention and growing dread as Potter casts a
"It's no surprise you're so bitter and immature." Firenze replies, petting the head of the Thestral fondly. "Children don't have the capability for much else."
"Hey, Moony." He rasps, trying to raise his head before letting it thunk back on the floor. "Why the long face? Did someone eat your kibble?" The others try to crowd in suddenly and Draco jerks away as if burned only for a hand to latch onto his arm. His sleeve is slick with blood but Sirius doesn't seem to care and his head turns up, looking for Draco yet still unable to see him. The blonde realises then that Sirius has been awake for far longer than he thought. "Wh-" Sirius' fingers edge too close to Draco's gaping cut and he cries out in pain, shoving him away with enough force that he's pushed into Lupin's side. It seems to have been the cue the others were waiting for and Draco deflects Tonks' spell before narrowly ducking Moody's.
She launches herself at him, and both of their wands are furious and incredible. If Draco wasn't terrified he'd be in awe. He should be helping the others, doing anything he can. He can see Tonks staggering weakly, disorientated from her fall and Moody, firing spells even from his position slouched on the ground. But Draco's view narrows, his focus only on the two in front of him. He's waiting for it. Waiting for the exact moment. It comes too soon.
Draco decides then that he hates her no less than he did before. He grits his teeth, opening his eyes to say something but all he sees is the blood and the water and then Potter is there and he can't breathe.
Draco's teeth grind. "Consequences? Like the ones issued to the Golden Boy? Do remind me, Professor: What were his consequences for chasing a troll in first year? For almost setting a snake on a student in second year? And lets not forget his attempt at fame and fortune last year. What were the consequences for entering the Tournament again? What are the consequences for any of your precious Gryffindors?"
"As your Headmaster, I must insist against such reckless action." Dumbledore says. "However," He adds, voice gentle. "I do commend your courage and your loyalty. Now, take hold of this Portkey. Madam Pomfrey will see to your injuries. One...Two...Three..."
"The journey must have been hard." The Professor says, cutting him off. "What you did is no easy feat. Nor is what you're going to do."
"Protect him." Lupin reads. "Protect who?" Draco pushes himself backwards, one hand lingering on Sirius' chest before he withdraws.
over Order members too idiotic to remember to protect their blind spots that he misses the Death Eater that works his way towards Potter. He turns at the man's enraged yell, seeing him stumble away from Potter and Longbottom, one hand raised protectively over his eye.
Draco is spat into Umbridge's office, thankful of the fireplace being unmonitered and stares up at the spinning ceiling. It seems to be as pink as everything else in the room. Draco wants to throw up but he fears that may be pink too. The Slytherins surrounding him are still asleep, and the door is still locked, there's a hissing at the fireplace and as the flames tinge green he arcs his wand in a panic and locks that too. Draco pants heavily, vision spinning and sits up, shakily pointing his wand at his arm. It takes three tries before bandages wrap around it, they're still loose and crooked but they do the job.
" Draco yells. Potter's Stupefy dies, half formed on his lips as he watches the man fall and he turns quickly, looking for the root of the spell. Draco darts away, still disillusioned and dodging green light. The move forces him further into the fray. He works his way towards Lupin, the ex-Professor firing spells so quickly that his wand is nought but a blur to Draco's eyes. A particularly sharp cutting curse catches one of the Death Eater's the man had been duelling and once he
Draco's eyes darted upwards, face to face (more like face to chest) with a familiar person. Draco gasped. "Mr. Nott!" The man had been dressed in his usual militia regalia, but no mask to obscure his face this time. Draco felt his chest constrict slightly as the man smiled down at him fondly.
Draco deemed it. He apparated the suitcase to Grimmauld Place, not wanting to be bothered to drag it all the way there.
"Here, take the remote and try changing the channel." Harry handed the remote to Draco, watching as the blonde began clicking through the buttons with childlike amusement. Harry could stay there and watch Draco figure out the television all night, but the sudden ring of the grandfather clock on the wall made him flinch and join reality once more. He looked down at his watch and cursed, "I gotta go, Malfoy. I'm going to be late for work. I'll be done later in the night." He called back as he rushed towards the door. Draco gave no response back, simply too transfixed by his shiny new toy. Harry smiled, finding he didn't really mind.
Currently, Draco was trying to hide his embarrassment as his great uncle ranted to Harry and him about how the Dark Lord was going to return once more and those who have betrayed him would once again feel his wrath. Harry simply nodded and smiled nervously while Draco tried his best to hide his pink cheeks. It was only natural that some rather devoted followers of the Dark Lord would remain, even 15 years after Voldemort's supposed death. Draco bit his tongue in order to not burst out in anger at his drunken family member, but he's heard this speech before. Ever since he was a child, Draco had been hearing the rumbles and rambling of Voldemort sympathizers. He's had them at his dinner table as guests, friends of his parents back when they were part of the clan. And Draco isn't foolish enough to not know that his parents weren't loyal supporters of the cause at one point. But how does one simply say no to the Dark Lord when everything they have is at stake. But now, Draco can see how they hide their Dark Marks in shame. How his mother covers it with the thickest tinctures and potions she can find and how his father rarely wears anything but long sleeved robes.
"Pretty little thing aren't ya?" Thomas purred into Draco's ear. Hands rubbing Draco's waist and hips, slowly digging and dipping down and into Draco's sweater. The sudden touch of cold hands made Draco flinch back.
"Planning to knock me up so soon, Potter?" Draco scoffed, "How charming," he drawled, rolling his eyes in the bratty manner that Harry loved so much.
"What are you doing here, Potter?" Draco muttered, eyes averting towards the ground and Harry had never realized how small the blonde was before.
"Oh Dimitri, you wound me! How dare you assume I have an ulterior motive! Perhaps I would just like to visit my favorite person?" Draco preened like Cheshire cat, draping himself against the wall, one leg delicately brought up and showing off.
"Well...perhaps we should all begin to settle down for the night." Ron turned to Hermione and smiled, "Allow me to take you to your room tonight?"
Upon climbing back up to his room, Draco made sure to place his new present safely tucked away in his drawer, hidden behind a particularly strong charm that even tricked Lucius when he almost found Draco's diary. It turned the stone invisible to everyone except Draco and Draco was planning to keep it that way. It was the end of the day, the sun setting and sweeping over the lush forests surrounding Hogwarts. Draco sat on his windowsill, curled around much like Lizzie was, sleeping on his bed. He stared out of the window, watching it get darker and darker outside, dusky greys and swirling purples. Draco felt sad. He felt sad a lot of the time nowadays. It was the type of sad that you didn't cry over, it just ate away at you and kept you awake. It was the type of sadness that constantly is slipping in and out of the back of your mind, constantly reminding you at the most inconvenient times that you don't belong here, that you're alone. Draco supposed he's felt this way for a couple of years. He's tried anything to fill the gnawing hole that lets the sadness creep into the back of his mind, but nothing seems to work long enough.
The minute class was over, Severus made sure Draco stayed back so that he may speak with him. It broke his heart to see the blond child hold back angry tears. "Draco-"
Draco felt himself being pinned against the wall, hands sliding and tongue, wet and cold, shoved into his mouth. Little whines and whimpers began to peep out of his mouth. With as much strength as he could muster, Draco pushed the body off of him, deep breaths wrecking his body. Thomas staggered off. "What the fuck Draco!"
"Always a daddy's boy, hm?" Harry began unscrewing the container opening and Draco finally understood that it was a flask that Harry had pulled out from the drawer. He watched as the boy brought the flask to his lips and tossed his head back. Draco's eyes followed the sharp lines of Harry's extended neck, the bobbing of his adam's apple, the way liquid began dripping down slowly. Harry pulled back and wiped his lips, noticing Draco's uneasy staring. "Too much for you, princess?"
He had gotten used to his daily routine alone: come home, undress, grab a beer or two or three from his fridge, and drink the night away until he was too drunk to make sense of Kreacher's scoldings. That was the best type of drunk, wasn't it? When words felt like they were underwater and his head was swimming. Then, the process would repeat. And he's ok with that. Ron and Hermione are happy and yeah, he's happy too with Ginny he guesses. This is fine and everything was fine and it would all work out and Ginny and him would be fine and-
Draco's pupils widened slightly, Harry wondered what he had triggered in the blonde's thoughts because the next thing he knew, Draco was strolling up towards him, lithe arms wrapping around Harry's neck and Draco's small chest pushed up against his own. "Draco what are you-" Harry's hands rushed up to Draco's shoulders, hazel green eyes widening in shock as Draco nearly purred in his ear.
"Harry. It's ok. I understand, the teasing, flirting. It's ok." Draco's words felt heavy against Harry's chest. "How about we call it a truce? I don't think my heart can take anymore of this, I'll go crazy. I don't know what we are, Harry. I don't know if you even like me, in fact, I think you absolutely hate me."
"How about... masquerade? It's all the rage in France. Quite romantic, don't you think, Mr. Potter?" Hermione asked, smiling teasingly at the serious man who turned a certain paleness. Harry nodded curtly, avoiding Draco's gaze.
"You left yourself vulnerable to all the men in this room! By ostracizing yourself, you've given the signal that you're- you're some promiscuous waif!" Mr. Potter's tone rose, more agitated, more frustrated. Draco didn't notice that the two of them were slowly gravitating towards each other, almost chest to chest.
Draco whined and trailed behind his father as his mother joined them. They piled into their carriage and the three of them drove off to town.
The dinner continued with only the clanking of silverware and the pummeling of rain to fill the room. Hermione cleared her throat slightly, dabbing her lips with her handkerchief. "Doesn't Draco look lovely tonight, Harry?"
"Does Minerva know about this?" The Fat Lady whispered back, her eyes shifting back and forth as if she was scared the head mistress of Gryffindor would suddenly aparate in front of them.
"Y-yeah you poof!" Harry scoffed. "Of course I do!" He said with renewed vigor, attempting to stay steady for the both of them. "I have since I first saw your bratty ass in the bookstore," he laughed. He had to admit it felt nice to have his pretty Draco dangling on him like this, finally able to hold him how he wanted, touch him as he pleased. Harry's hands wrapped tighter around Draco's waist.
"Mr. Potter! I didn't get to speak to you much at the party, what brings you to England? I hear that you lived in the South of France for a year or two," Hermione inquired as she ate a small sandwich.
Dimitri simply scoffed, "I suppose you say that to all your customers," he huffed as he turned to put away barrels of flour.
The blonde blinked rapidly, turning towards the sound of his name. Ah, right. He was in front of Grimmauld Place now. And there was Harry, like a ghost from his memories, staring at him once again with his wide hazel eyes . He looked… confused and slightly concerned, perhaps because he had been calling Draco's name for the last minute and the blonde stood as still as a statue, frozen in place.
Hogsmeade was bustling with Hogwarts students, running around and laughing. It was happy, a pretty Christmas picture of smiling children playing in the snow and looking at the shining trinkets in store windows. Blaise handed the two a cup of steamy warm pumpkin juice and the three of them began to walk around the center of town. McGonagall was keeping a watchful eye as usual, making sure the children didn't get into any precarious trouble, but even her attitude was lightened by the Christmas scene. As Pansy and Blaise chatted, Draco's attentions were everywhere, eyes darting from one store to the next. He was excited for this little shopping excursion. His parents had sent him a monthly allowance and the money was burning in his pockets. Draco spotted his godfather in the corner, unamused as always but just as attentive as his colleagues. Severus had always detested chaperoning school trips such as this, but as the Slytherin headmaster, it was required of him to be present on such occasions. Draco told Blaise and Pansy to go off without him, only to talk to his godfather for a minute, and that he would reunite with them soon. The two understood and with minimal whining, they pranced off to the next attraction that Hogsmeade had to offer.
Draco chuckled bitterly and sighed, his legs kicking up onto the couch and curling under his legs, much like a content cat. "Oh, I don't know. I guess not. But I suppose that'll probably happen. My parents will arrange something I'm sure." It was common for purebloods to have arranged marriages in order to secure the safety of the bloodline. Draco, being the only son of Lucius and Narcissa, was definitely going to be married off to some rich suitor one day. What happens then, Draco couldn't really tell.
"Oh? Is my pretty Draco home so soon?" Lucius came around the corner, glasses in hand. Draco soon straightened his back, smiling up at his father. He was enveloped in a large hug, one that he openly nuzzled into. Once the hug broke, Lucius guided Draco into the drawing room.
It was common knowledge amongst wizards that all Death Eaters were to be killed with no hesitation. This was the only justice for the damage and calamity they've caused. How Draco survived, he still doesn't know. He was apparently too young, in Minerva McGonagall's eyes, to die. She had been kind to him, reminding Draco of little Ms. Shrew. She had always been immensely kind with him and Draco had felt the whips of guilt and shame as he thought back to everything he's done, how he's lived his life and how he's acted. Draco wanted to cry out, "Why?? Why am I suddenly too young?? Why am I too young to die with my parents? The only people in my life I had left in the world! I wasn't too young when I was given the dark mark at age ten, I wasn't too young when Fenrir Greyback had whispered crude words into my ear, and stroked a hand down my back at age thirteen. I wasn't too young when rumors of my binding to the Dark Lord had fluttered around the Death Eater circles, supposedly claiming that I would be betrothed to the overlord himself at only fifteen, a pretty thing for the king of darkness. Why am I suddenly too young to be given the only thing I've ever wanted in my life?? My parents!"
"Well...uh, he's-" Draco stammered, his eyes darting around the room and also stepping back as he watched Fenrir coming closer and closer.
Harry swallowed down his anger, leaving veins in his neck to bulge and his scar to burn. Harry had wanted nothing more than to hex the man next to him; to curse him with all that he has. How could he dare to let such filth spew out from his mouth? And how dare he tell it to Harry, himself. The boy who had come to play victim to Voldemort, the boy whose parents had fallen to him and the boy who had always pined for the Malfoy child from the moment he had first seen him. It was as if Rodolphus was especially trying to get a rise out of him. As if to show the Malfoys, to show Draco, that Harry didn't belong in this world. But it wasn't as if Harry thought Draco belonged here either. The blonde wasn't anything like any of his supposed family members. If Harry had his way, he'd tell all these people to fuck off and take Draco home with him, back to the Burrow. Ron would surely have a fit and Draco would probably hiss like a scorned kitten, but at least he'd be somewhere that was devoid of miscreants such as these.
"Oh come now, Draco. How could you be so pessimistic?" Hermione whined, "With your good looks, any man would be lucky to have you, arrogant or not"
The song ended and the two broke apart reluctantly. Draco's blush roamed from his cheeks to his ears to his chest, strawberry pink like the desserts being served. Draco found himself hot, too hot and almost gasping for air. He began to scurry away from Harry, away from the dancing and the flurry of people to go to the balcony overlooking the gardens. The fresh wind felt cool on his skin and Draco took large gasps of air. He pulled off his mask in a hurry, cheeks too hot for a feathered cover. Harry had followed him outside, pulling off his own mask as well, holding a glass of water for Draco. Draco accepted it without words and downed the glass.
Draco's little bubble burst at hearing Harry's last remark. He turned to the boy next to him only to see he was already staring back. Malfoys and Potters? Yes it was definitely a century old feud between them. Death Eaters Vs. The Light. It wasn't as if Draco's parents had a choice in the matter. When Voldemort asks you to do something, you simply don't say no. It's in the past, their hands were tied. Can you truly punish the apple for coming from a rotten bunch? It's not as if his parents are bad people. They're kind and smart and funny and loving and goddammit he's tired of all these assumptions. It doesn't even matter now. Voldemort is dead. As dead as a doornail….Draco supposed he has Harry's parents to thank for that. "I guess that means we were destined to hate each other too," Draco mused with a small, sad smirk.
But looking at him now: this skinny, pale, gangly little thing...it was hard to justify such a cruel thing. Like he had always said, what was the point of digging up the past, when they were buried under layers and layers of resentment and denial. Harry sighed, pushing up his glasses from the bridge of his nose and running his hand through his now loose hair. "Listen, you don't have to do anything you don't want to, alright? Just… I'll send you my address via owl. You can floo to Grimmauld if you'd like." Harry was about to turn around, about to go back to his work and pretend like he had never seen the blonde wisp of a boy because it was likely that he would never hear from Draco again anyways. He would turn away, go back to work, then go home and drown his embarrassment and sorrows like he always did: in a bottle of scotch and a pack of cigarettes.
"What, am I your therapist now, Potter?" Draco scoffed back, starting to get more comfortable and recline more into the couch cushions. Draco hadn't meant to be so rude. It just kinda spilled out, word vomited. It was a sensitive topic and like all Malfoys, he was uncomfortable with sensitive topics. Centuries of social training had made it so whenever something or someone was making a Malfoy uncomfortable, they'd probably be greeted with a swift insult or rude remark. Draco sometimes wishes he wasn't a Malfoy.
Harry grabbed Draco's wrist, yanking him back into his arms and holding him down. "I think you don't actually loathe me, I think you tease me on purpose, little minx. Perhaps you intend to seduce a wealthy husband and have yourself comfortable for the rest of your life."
Draco bit his bottom lip and followed Harry inside the school, which was now more or less silent except for the occasional mutterings of a painting or ghost. He doesn't know why he's so blindly following the brunette, it's not like they were friends now. It's not like one night would change anything. But hey, now that he's here, might as well see what the fuss was about that made Potter apparate them all the way here. They finally stopped in front of the Gryffindor Commons room entrance once more. This time, the Fat Lady was lounging against her chaise, feeding herself grapes and other fruits. She was startled to see the two students, her body jolting up from his position quite animatedly.
"Oh? And what did it say?" He muttered in disinterest as he slowly chewed on his jam and toast, replaying the scene over and over in his head.
Harry quickly shot up from his seat, nearly knocking over plates and silverware to the ground as he raced towards Draco. The two stood side by side as they walked down the winding hallways. Harry glanced over at Draco, and yet the boy would still not meet his gaze. Harry's body began to grow tight and anxious, his palms sweating and his collar tight.
"No, of course not. You just skulk off with upperclassmen and snog them in the corridors of the school in the middle of the night." Harry shrugged, his smirk growing more and more to the point he looked like the Chesire Cat.
Draco gulped slightly. "I don't work as of now, but I do enjoy reading and poetry. I garden sometimes and embroider small pieces. My parents would prefer I not work, they would rather I learn trades of the home."
"Oh come on, I've seen with my very eyes the longing stares he gives you, and you him. Hermione pulled away the material from Draco, forcing the boy to look towards her. "You're absolutely smitten!"
"Well, If we had it your way, I'd be confined in your bed already, never to see the light of day again," Draco muttered sheepishly as Harry and him began to head back to the Manor.
In his 25 years of life, Harry's never felt so unhinged, so shaken up and rambunctious. He worries if he falls asleep, he'll dream of a certain silver-haired vixen. And that would be awful, would it not? Harry isn't entirely sure what transpired that night. The four or five or six or seven flutes of champagne he had consumed made sure he was left with a hazy memory of the party's events. He does remember certain snippets though; remembers Draco talking to Mr. Nott, the disgusting cad. Harry was unsure why this interaction had fueled a fire in him so hot that it forced his legs to transverse the dance floor, tap on Mr. Notts shoulder, and effectively break the two up. He knew what the man wanted, he knew what he was thinking. Seizing up Draco from across the floor, Theodore Nott wanted nothing but a subservient wife to pump into and pop out kids. A disgusting man, absolutely irreprehensible.
How exactly was Harry supposed to explain to his best friend and work partner that he was currently harboring an ex-death eater in his home and to top it off, this particular ex-death eater was none other than Draco Malfoy, the bane of their childhood existence and Oh! Let's not forget that Harry was also trying to protect him from a fucking prostitute murder with a penchant for little blondes like him? The entire ordeal was too exhausting to deal with, knowing that Ron would absolutely throw a fit. Harry looked down at his watch, 8:14 pm, and sighed, "Nothing, Ron, I'm just tired, ok? I haven't been sleeping well."
Draco sighed and whined, "You know I can't say no when you beg like so, fine, I shall join you. But I cannot promise I will play nice with Mr. Potter, for I truly find no good qualities in the man except his overfilled pocketbook."
"Sorry mummy, got to go!" Draco rambled as he scurried past her, no time for explanation as he jetted through the door and let it swing closed with a thud. Lucius simply chuckled again from his seat.
Kreacher narrowed his beady eyes, but eventually nodded. "Kreacher will allow Master Draco to unpack his belongings. Kreacher will be back with tea for the young master." And with a poof, the house elf disappeared.
"Hello, my name is Hermione Granger. And you are…?" Her tone came out brash, harsher than Draco had ever heard he speak before. He raised an eyebrow as Hermione introduced herself to Theodore, bowing curtly. "How do you know Draco? You two seem awfully well acquainted" She asked, which earned her a small shove from the boy in question.
"Uncle you don't have to for Harry's sake-" Draco laughed, but the man had already disappeared in a swath of black fabric, making a beeline back to the alcohol bar. Draco sighed and shook his head, "That's Uncle Severus for you, more repressed and tight than a knot." He turned up to Harry, snaking his arms into the brunette's. "Now come on, let's slip out for a bit." Harry was then whisked away from the crowd, away from the golden yellow candle lights that illuminated the rest of the Malfoy home and into the dark and cold hallways nearby.
"You're right, I should treat you as you are, an insipid and infuriating little child," he sing-songed as he walked inside, ignoring Draco's little gasp and 'hey!'
The walk was silent and the two men kept a moderate distance from each other. Harry didn't fail to notice Draco's slight stumbling, his heels must have made it difficult to walk on the grass, still wet from the previous night's rain.
"And where would I ever wear something like this?" He asked, looking at himself in the mirror and adjusting his own hair.
The War had just ended and Harry found himself hopped up on a mix of adrenaline and utter loneliness. Ginny had just seemed to be the best choice and somewhere along the way, they had paired off. And it was good...for a while. At first, it had begun like any new relationship: words of endearment, constant letters back and forth, stolen kisses in the streets, and enough sex to last a man a life time. Ginny had always had a crush on him, Harry knows that. But as time marched on in it's steady pace, he's come to realize that she perhaps loved him for what she knows about him: The Chosen One, The Boy who Lived. It was easy to fall in love with someone that seemed larger than life itself and Ginny was more than happy to live in the grandeur of it all. But like all things, the War has come to an end and Harry is no longer the Golden Boy of Hogwarts. He's simply a man and Ginny found herself becoming less and less attracted to the Harry that was underneath that Golden plating. It was reasonable, Harry thought. After all, she hadn't asked to be in a relationship with an overly pessimistic and mostly bitter Harry Potter. But then was then and this was now and now Harry's found himself a shell of his former self. He's not sure if he still loved Ginny, perhaps a strong fondness, but fondness isn't love and Harry had been feeling fondness for the past year or so. So, when Ginny had revealed her plans to leave the country, Harry was ashamed to admit he was just a little relieved. She had said the distance would be good for them. You know what they say:
"The Lake." Harry responded in a cool manner, leaning up against one of the large boulders that surrounded the area. Draco finally had a chance to look at his surroundings and indeed confirm that they were back at school. The Lake area was well used during the spring and summer, when the weather was warmer and a dip in the cool water was well appreciated, but during the winter months, it was nearly deserted. The water never seemed to freeze entirely over, probably hexed by Dumbledore in case any wiley students decided to test the ice and accidentally plunge to their frozen deaths. The water was black, dark and riotous as it swayed back in forth from the wind. It was so opaque, it was impossible to see through it and Draco began to imagine what it was like sinking to the bottom, how long it would really take. The entire landscape looked frozen in place, dead and morose and black.
The brunette stuttered slightly, hands feeling heavy on Draco's petite waist. What was Draco talking about? Reputation? Fantasy? Harry's glasses began to fog up as Draco's hands began to stroke up Harry's neck softly. "It's 50 for a blow, double for a romp." Draco's gentle and sweet words felt like a stinging curse to Harry's ears and the brunette nearly flung him out of his arms at the proposition. Draco looked bewildered as Harry panted lightly, staring back at him like the blonde had grown a second head.
? Cute was never a word he thought he would associate with Draco. It was reserved for sweet things like...like children's dolls and woodland creatures. Harry doesn't even think he's called Ginny cute before (she would probably hit him on the chest and insist that she wasn't cute, but sexy instead.) But now that he thinks back, Draco had always been just a little bit cute. He's always been just slightly coy, even if he was a bit of a tosser. And his 'princess brat' attitude had been annoying, but also rather charming (when he wasn't being a giant git). But this Draco… this stain covered, pink cheeked, nervous smile and tied up hair Draco…
"I couldn't help but see an angel has fallen from heaven," he drawled. Draco could only make out the bottom portion of his face but from what he saw, he concluded this man must be adequately handsome with a strong jaw and light stubble. With a renewed confidence fueled by alcohol, Draco's lips curled into a smile.
Harry blinked and looked away, his own skin beginning to heat up. "You're welcome," he said back gruffly, walking back into the kitchen. While the brunette fiddled around with the kettle once more, pouring himself another cup, Draco found his way to the couch, sitting down carefully. He curled up and tucked his legs under him, trying to take up as little space as possible.
"Well don't you look like an angel! Absolutely heavenly!" Ron drawled, kissing Draco's knuckles with an obnoxious smack of his lips. The man was obviously tipsy. "And you look quite dashing," Draco smiled back. In the corner of his eye, he could tell someone was watching him. He could feel the familiar deep burn in the pit of his stomach that flushed to his chest. In the corner of his eye he could see a dark figure, nestled away amongst the crowd. Draco was snapped back to attention when he was being whisked away once again.
The weight upon him suddenly lifted and Draco's face snapped forwards. There, in front of him, was Mr. Potter with the pervert in an arm hold, hurriedly whispering in his ear which made the man's face drop in shock and fear. He suddenly ran off through the crowd, leaving Mr. Potter and a startled Draco. Draco felt a weight lift off of him as he chuckled slightly. "Oh, thank you sir. I honestly didn't know what would get him off-"
"One dress, for me, please! I'll even let you borrow one of mine," Narcissa begged. "I'm not getting any younger and I wish to see my only child married before then!"
"That's not fair!" One boy whined from his seat. "He gets preferential treatment. Not only is he the princess of Slytherin, he's also Snape's fucking godson." He turned to his friend and attempted to lower his tone, whispering,"Snape probably gave him the answers anyway," the boy continued, "I heard that he hangs out with the older boys, the little slut." The boy wasn't expecting to find Snape looming over his head, staring straight down as if he were a shark looking at prey. Draco's cheeks were bright red and his lip was tightly pursed in order not to show his embarrassment. He felt annoyed and frustrated that people thought the only reason he could answer such a question was because he was somehow related to Severus. Just another reason for people to think he was some blond bimbo.
Harry winced at such a thing. He was right, after all. He had used the Half-Blood Prince's curse on Draco, back when Harry was sure that Draco had been the enemy, the evil thing in the shadows. And he still was, wasn't he? Nothing had changed between them. They were still just Potter and Malfoy and weren't they supposed to hate each other's guts? So why was Harry so concerned anyways? Who cared if the dirty traitor got jumped in some alley way? Who cared if Draco Malfoy was a hooker and who cared if there was some lunatic out there murdering hookers like him? Isn't that what he deserved? To die like he lived-- a little weasel in the dark?
"I'm not a fucking alcoholic!" Harry exclaimed with a sort of frantic laugh, "I've barely even touched this thing. But during the winter… during Christmas time… I'm not so sure. It's difficult."
"Goodnight, Mr. Potter" Draco said softly as he stood from his seat and began padding over to the staircase.
"Nothing, absolutely nothing at all." Draco muttered in annoyance, the lilt in his voice was unconvincing to Hermione, who pressed on.
He clutched onto Draco's hand and relished in its warmth as they climbed up the winding staircases towards the second floor, into the darkness and away from the joyous noise. Soon, the two found themselves alone and in silence, rows of doors lined the walls and Draco smiled back at Harry so brightly it seemed to be the only light source nearby. He was led to the last door at the end of the hall, a grand white double door with golden knobs. A swish of Draco's pretty hand and suddenly the door unlocked and opened, the blond walking confidently through them. "Welcome to Chez Draco," he giggled, another swish of the fingers and the lights turned on to a beautiful warm glow. Draco's room was exactly what Harry would have imagined it to be: white, grand, and princessy. The bed had a lace canopy shrouding it with a matching white dresser to the side, a plush couch and coffee table in the middle, and a grand balcony that led to an open veranda. Truly a bedroom fit for the blonde. Harry walked around the room in curiosity, taking every little detail in, wiping his fingertips across each piece.
"Good morning, father." Draco smiled up at the man nervously, attempting to slyly take out the pin from his hair and tuck it safely into the pocket of his robe. Lucius walked over to his son and kissed his head in passing, then kissing his wife's cheek next. He took his seat at the head of the table, the patriarch of the Malfoy clan. His food was quickly placed in front of him and Lucius began to eat.
"No!" Draco squeaked, his fingers gripped the duvet. He bit his bottom lip and cleared his throat. "No, Kreacher, thank you. That's quite alright." The pink of his cheeks was slowly creeping down to his neck and Kreacher wondered if the young master was ill and if perhaps he'd like a cup of tea.
"Well, Ronald, since I could actually AFFORD my own room here, I suppose a rumor would spread like that. Unlike you and your pack of mutts." Draco huffed, nose turned up. Ron turned as red as his hair, blabbering on about how he wanted to hex the living daylights out of Draco, but all Draco could notice was that Harry was once again just staring.
"Oh please daddy~" Draco whined teasingly. He knew how men worked and he knew their weaknesses and men apparently couldn't resist to feel powerful over another, "I can be a good little boy for you. Maybe I could even work here, just let me…-" Draco's soft little hand worked its way down Dimitri's broad chest, timid touches that trailed down to the edge of Dimitri's pants.
"And therefore they won't refuse," Ronald smiled, his eyes widening as the two leaned in closer and closer as their excitement built.
"Ronald and your beloved Mr. Potter are currently outside in the yard, acting like children and racing each other." Hermione drawled on as she resumed her activity and took a dainty bite of her roll. She took a small sniff from her nose and her eyes narrowed slightly, her head turning towards Draco who was sipping his tea. She came closer to Draco, sniffing down his neck and leaning in even closer when Draco attempted to pull away. "Are you wearing perfume? You never wear perf-"
"And were you one of his followers, Professor?" Harry asked bitterly, adjusting his slipping glasses. Snape remained silent next to him, a stoic statue in all black robes.
Draco rolled his eyes at the obvious attempt at a guilt-trip. "Fine mother, I will do as you wish. I will not, however, have this dress be wild and opulent. I don't wish to stand out as much as I need to."
"Well, if they like drama so much, perhaps a soap-opera could be made of my family tree. There are some rather sordid details that I'm sure would titillate any muggle. For example, my cousin-" Draco stopped mid-word. Perhaps Harry wouldn't cherish hearing about Draco's family, considering they had once conspired to murder him. The blonde simply shut his pink lips and refocused on the tv screen, his grip tight on the remote.
Harry pretended as if he hadn't noticed Draco's hesitation. He shouldn't push him, he knows. Draco probably had dealt with a lot and Harry wasn't going to be the one to make him face unpleasant memories. He entered the kitchen and was greeted by what seemed like a hurricane. All around him were dirty utensils, vegetable scraps, crumbled up napkins. And on the stove was a single bubbling pot, the metal lid clamoring as it steamed and spat. Harry was quick to turn off the fire, nervous that the entire house would burn down with how high it was. "What the-" he muttered, fishing around for a cloth to use to lift the scorching hot lid. The steam hit his face immediately, making his glasses fog up. Harry put down the lid and took off his glasses, wiping them down on his shirt, and then placing them back on. He waved away some of the steam and peered inside curiously.
"Really? I heard some noises from across the hall that I could only assume was you and Mr. Potter here."
Draco's hands immediately came up to cross over his chest, holding onto his own arms in a defensive stance. Harry took in every inch of Draco Malfoy: his porcelain alabaster skin that looked sickly pale under the street lamps of Knockturn, his snowy hair that had grown out into a tangled mess, his slim waist that looked like it would topple over if hit by a gust of wind…
"I had gotten lost inside. No worries." Draco's cheeks were tomato red, much like the setting sun that was draping its arms upon Derbyshire. Harry had stumbled out of the estate and into the garden after Draco, slightly panting and disheveled. Hermione's eyebrows raised and a small smile grew on her lips. Draco whined slightly and pulled Hermione closer.
"Let it be known that Grimmauld Place belongs to me more than it belongs to you," Draco spat out, "And besides, don't you have better things to do than to chase me? I didn't realize you had such a thing for me~ lovely to see what the Ministry of Magic uses their funds on." he sneered, sharp tongue like always and Harry found his stomach warming at the notion that maybe not everything about Draco had changed. Not his wit and certainly not his beauty, even if it was hidden under dinn.
"Are you telling me I'm not allowed to take a moment to myself? As if I'm the one who asked that disgusting man to drape himself upon me?" Draco huffed, crossing his arms.
Draco's cheeks turned red and hot as he noticed Harry's sudden cold behavior towards him. The two seemed dejected and this caused Ron and Hermione to gulp and fidget in their seats. Hermione turned to Draco and attempted to pull her best smile. "Draco, come with me for a second. Excuse us boys, we are going to go powder our noses," she dragged Draco away with her to the bathroom, pushing him inside.
It's hard to sleep when a figure haunts your dreams and leaves you in a hot and mangled mess in your sheets. Harry didn't understand his feelings towards a certain snow-haired boy. Draco Malfoy was infuriating, conceited and terribly unpolished. He was arrogant, childish, and crude. And yet...Harry couldn't help but feel magnetized towards the boy, the beautiful boy with soft white skin and lovely pink cheeks and clouded grey, slate eyes. Harry couldn't help but seek out the witty, playful, teasing, adorable, flustered….
"If one day, God bestowed upon me a man who is worthy of me, then perhaps I would marry." Draco sighed. "But from what I have seen, all men are pigs who wallow in their own muck. Good riddance, I say," Draco huffed, crossing his arms.
"Yeah yeah, I know already. It's fine, really." The boy wiped his eyes, still attempting to be strong. The silence that was left was deafening as Snape went to his desk and pulled out a small box. He turned to face Draco, who was still trying to put on a brave face.
"I'm not! Seriously, I can't cook at all so this is...this is good." Harry insisted, looking back down at the broth.
"How's business today, my fine mustachioed friend?" Draco mused, leaning comfortably against the wooden counter.
Draco's pale white cheeks turned pink as he nodded and averted his gaze, "I don't know if you're just fooling around or if you're serious but marriage is a really big deal in the Malfoy family and I don't even know if my parents would let me marry you I mean you're not affiliated with the family and I don't want to waste my time with someone who isn't serious and you just say it all the time and-" Draco's rambling was cut off when he noticed Harry had crossed the floor towards him. He took the blonde's hands in his, then lifting his chin up to stare into his own green hazel eyes. Draco bit his bottom lip, wanting to look away, but knowing he should stare straight on.
The trial was held in the Ministry, Draco and his mother locked in cages like animals. Narcissa had been sobbing, but her tears were drowned out in Draco's ears by the incessant chattering of the Ministry that surrounded them on all sides. They had all been there, when Narcissa was sentenced to death. Draco remembered it so vividly, he could repeat his mother's final words from rote memory. And he was there too… Harry Potter. He had been there, hidden in the crowd with his rowdy band of misfits. He remembers Ron Weasley's smile: cruel and toothy. He remembers Hermione Granger cowering behind the Ginger cad, not bearing to watch. In that moment, Draco felt most apologitory towards her.
Draco's lips curled slightly as he placed his bookmarker back in between the pages. "I suppose so," he drawled. Harry instantly stuck out a hand for Draco to take, in order to help him off the ground. Draco took it without a word, allowing the man to bring him up to him, face to face. Draco began to dust himself off slightly, walking off before Harry and hoping to God that his cheeks weren't as hot and pink as they felt. Due to this, Draco couldn't see the small smirk that curled around Harry's lips and the fondness that began to creep onto his face.
"Sounds splendid!" Hermione giggled, clapping her hands together. "Doesn't that sound wonderful, Draco?" She turned to Draco, taking his arm, realizing the gaze he held with Harry had still not yet broken. Draco was startled by the sudden action and turned to Hermione"
"I thought you hated me, wasn't it you who said I was despicable, horrible, and cruel?" Harry teased, "If I knew any better, I would say you quite like my insults, Draco." His eyes glanced down, mischievous and playful. The boy scoffed and tsked.
"Whoever the killer is...he's looking for someone," Harry cut-off, "Someone in particular. All of these people aren't them." Harry's eyes scanned the body, weary and full of sadness for the poor girl. What a grisly way to go, a slow and painful death.
"Perhaps they've runaway in a passionate affair," Draco joked, "Perhaps they've already boarded a ship to Paris this very second."
"I'm sorry for my uncle, he's quite the drunkard," Draco muttered sheepishly as Harry's hands trailed down towards Draco's hips, rubbing lightly at the fabric of his dress with rough thumbs.
"No no, not at all. In fact I rather think you'd take plenty of time in the mirror to ensure that you're absolutely spotless, huh?" Harry had a half smile on his face and Draco felt like half laughing.
"Oh nothing, father. I-I was just telling mother how I was going to wear the locket you gave me for my birthday to the party. And the dress I was given as well! It was going to be a surprise. You know how I do love to wear the things you get me~" Draco then turned to Narcissa expectantly, as if to motion for her to continue their little ruse.
"Let's just say his companion is the type of man I detest," Draco grit his teeth. "He's absolutely terrible! A real piece of work, that one!" Draco glanced over to Hermione, who was staring back at him with a dopey look on her face. "What?"
Hermione's cheeks grew into a pale blush as she attempted to bite back a smirk. "It's about time to recognize my excellence."
"Promiscuous waif?! My God sir, you don't even know me and yet you make me out to be some kind of...of harlot??"
Getting dressed in his robes, Draco powdered a little blush on his cheeks and nose and spritzed himself with a small vial of perfume he had snuck from his mother's boudior.  The blond made his way down to the dining hall, which was already bustling with cheerful energy as other students attempted to get their daily fill. Some kids from the Slytherin table beckoned Draco over, kind smiles and warm eyes. Draco doesn't even know if he remembers their names. The boy sat down gingerly, picking up a muffin and picking at it. He watched the scene before him from the lense of an outsider. Periodically, someone would include him in the conversation, but soon be bored of his answer and move onto the next topic. Draco didn't mind, he was used to such conversation. As most people know, Slytherin students were mostly the sons and daughters of politicians, actors and actresses, and other high officials. They were all poised and cunning and snooty and rich. Future entrepreneurs, politicians, doctors and professors. Draco, perhaps to them, was just a pretty little air-headed heir. They were curt and perhaps even slightly rude, but Draco grew to not mind. After all, these were his...friends? Companions? Even if they didn't remember his birthday.
"Never a lack of insults from you, right, Mr. Potter?" Draco purred, finally wrapping his arms around Harry's bicep, holding on as the wind picked up. He could hear the only man chuckle slightly, feel the rumble in his chest as it vibrates against Draco's skin.
"Quite! It's such a lovely day, I recommend we go for a stroll, a picnic! Going to town! Anything that involves us being outside!" Ronald smiled widely, "I'll have my cooks make us a basket and we can all go down to the river and eat lunch!"
"Oh please, as if Lucius ever could win against me in a wand duel." Severus looked out in front of him, watching as the hoards of children around them frolicked in the snow. A few seconds passed between the two before Severus spoke again. "How are you anyways," he asked gruffly, not sparing a glance down at Draco. Although family, it was better for them not to share too much affection during the school day. It wasn't as if Severus was never accused of casual nepotism.
The morning before the first day of school was one that Draco would remember for the rest of his life. They were going to the market, Diagon Alley, to pick up supplies for school. Lucius had called ahead in order to assure Draco would get first pick of all the scrolls and quills as well as texts necessary. He even assured that Draco received duplicates, in case he lost one. Nothing was too good for his Draco, Lucius assured as he allowed Narcissa to fuss over the boy. As all Malfoys were expected to be, Draco was pampered and plush, his hair soft and flowing down his face. Soft blush was placed on doll-like cheeks and robes were freshly pressed and hung up. Narcissa insisted on tying a ribbon around Draco's neck, but Lucius refused, insisting that Draco's first impression should be as proper as possible, in order to ensure that the Malfoy name was protected. Lucius watched as Draco's face crumpled, baby soft lips curving inwards but not uttering a peep.
"I'm not sure, probably shaking hands with important guests. Being a socialite and a proper gentleman." Draco drawled on.
"Oh, lovely! You two are just in time for dinner," Ron smiled, wrapping an arm around Harry's shoulders.
The silence that fell between them lasted what felt like forever. Draco attempted to keep occupied by having his eyes scan the room, take in every detail of his new home, but what else could he do? How exactly does one strike up conversation with a man he had sworn to hate with his life? If Lucius was alive, he'd throw a fit knowing that his son was conversing with Harry Potter, let alone becoming his flatmate. Harry seemed to also notice the tension, refusing to meet eyes with Draco, even as he sat down on the loveseat across from him.
Draco and Hermione had found themselves seated in front of the dancing, tucked away from sight lest they be asked to dance. Joined together by a few others they had become acquainted with, the small group found themselves enjoying the ornate cups of wine and swapping gossip.
Hermione smiled and nodded, taking Ron's arm and getting up from the table and up the stairs. Once again, Harry and Draco were alone. The silence between them was deafening and Harry wished, silently implored Draco to look up at him, to snap back at him with a witty and stinging retort. Draco remained silent.
"Perhaps Mr. Malfoy would be more suited in a dress as well," Harry muttered under his breath, rolling his eyes at the scalding look Draco whipped in his direction.
Draco turned his head when he heard his name and his entire body froze up as he saw the figure approach him. "O-oh. Mr. Greyback, how are you?" Draco asked with a polite smile, his hand moving to rub as his own arm, crossing them in front of his chest. Fenrir Greyback was an associate of the once powerful Dark Lord, as well as an old acquaintance of Draco's father. He had been invited to many Malfoy family dinners and Draco distinctly remembered the werewolf's beaty yellow eyes following his every movement. The way Greyback had watched Draco as if he were prey on the run had always caused goosebumps to raise on his skin. There were rumors of Greyback's less than polite behavior with his companions and he was often the center of crude stories. But from the first time Draco had met the werewolf, only 8 years old and holding Lucius's hand, Draco had known that the creature had certain insidious and lewd intentions when it came to him.
"Play nice, Potter. My family is around, remember?" Draco purred back, slipping out from Harry's grasp. The brunette watched as the snowy-haired boy sauntered off, his hips swaying enticingly and Harry couldn't help but follow. He would follow Draco to the ends of the earth if it meant he could stay with him. Even if that meant enduring his family members and acquaintances. They all seemed to be amazed at the sight of him, gawking openly and whispering behind their glasses as they watched the Malfoy heir being escorted by the Boy Who Lived. Harry had enjoyed making them squirm in discomfort whenever he would pull Draco into his embrace. It was as if Harry was attempting to display a warning: 'this one is mine'. It was something worth repeating, he's found, since it seems that Draco is quite the eligible bachelor in Pureblood society. All night, Harry was forced to listen to either the forlorn longings of past Voldemort supporters or the constant badgering of men who attempt to steal Draco away, if only for a drink or a dance. While Harry would like nothing more than to lock Draco away from public view, he knew he would have to play the polite guest. Therefore, he allowed Draco to go and do his obligatory socializing considering he was the host of the party after all.
Lucius glanced up from his book, his eyes scanning Draco. With a warm smile, he nodded and set down the book he was reading. "My Draco has always been the prettiest," Lucius sighed, standing up to grab his coat and cane.
"I hope you keep your word, Potter. Lucius shall not be as kind as I would to simply petrify you." Harry could see the smallest semblance of a smirk beginning to curl on the corner of Snape's lips.
"Yes, well...Uncle...uh...Snape will get upset if I'm not in bed, so perhaps I should just..leave." Draco began creeping slowly towards the entrance, his back against the brunette.
"You know the rules! No Slytherins or any other house in the Gryffindor Common Room!" She roared, this time, less inclined to keep quiet in case she roused the attention of any faculty.
Draco nodded, bouncing on his heels. "Right. You're an Auror now, aren't you? I saw it in the papers." He looked anywhere but the man in front of him.
Draco's thoughts once again wandered to an image of himself, walking down the street with a stroller in hand, pushing it down through the farmer's market. A child, huh? The idea wasn't ...entirely repulsive.
"Oh, there you are, love. I have been looking for you all night." An arm slinked around the blonde's waist and pulled him tight against a strong and firm chest. Draco looked up and his pretty slate eyes widened at the miraculous sight of Harry who was hugging Draco tightly into his side as well as staring Fenrir down with sharp and piercing eyes.
Harry's cigarette hung on his lips, barely teetering and the brunette couldn't bother to take it out of his mouth, too stunned to bother. Draco Malfoy looks as if he hadn't aged a day. And yet, he looked older, more worn down. It all flooded back to Harry in that moment and the brunette found himself at a loss for words.
"Well, if you must know, the trip was quite long and tedious. I came in around 10 minutes ago, but I think I scared the valet when I flew in on BuckBeak. Next Christmas, darling, your parents are coming to us," Harry huffed as he stopped a servant with a tray of whiskey glasses filled with amber liquid. Harry took one sip and slightly cringed, only to down the rest of it. "Well that definitely tastes better than the stuff in my flask, but it still tastes like metal and rubbing alcohol. Who knew, fancy whiskey is just as shitty as regular cheap ones."
Although Draco was rather popular in Hogwarts, he can't help but feel he's not very well liked. The so-called "Princess of Slytherin" had been deemed his nickname by a certain redheaded cad. Sure, Draco had his handful of admirers and followers, but he wasn't sure they qualified as "friends" the way that Harry, Ron, and Hermione were "friends". At 15 years old, Draco has definitely grown out of his sweet looks into something more... mature. He's blossomed in more ways than one and Draco can't help but notice the changes in the looks he's gotten. From sweet adoration to something sinister. Draco was beginning to  feel that this was a factor in his non-friendship with others. He often passed time with the older Slytherin kids in the common rooms, all 17, 18 years old and making Draco feel as if he belonged there, as if he belonged to this crowd. But once the festivities were over, once the fire died down, Draco was alone again. The thought of this made Draco very...very lonely.
Draco bought four little chocolate frogs and two honeycomb lollies, one that he currently had in his mouth that was making his lips sweet and sticky. His head turned to talk to his friends, he didn't notice that he was about to walk straight into a person as he walked through the door. Draco bounced back with a little "oof" and groaned, looking up to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
"Oh fuck off." Draco cooed, a little chuckle rumbling in his chest but not daring to escape. "And you're a pretty shitty hero!"
"As if! Don't even joke about it, Pansy!" Draco stomped off towards Honeydukes candy store. The other two trailed off next to him, hurrying to keep up with the now embarrassed Draco.
"He always has been beautiful. We had always known he'd be. Even the Dark Lord had known." Rodolphus smirked, leaning in closer to Harry as if they were pals exchanging secrets.
"Oh, Draco…" he muttered, gazing upon his son's outfit. "You look lovely. I assume your mother did your hair?" Draco nodded, hand reaching back to playing with the ends of it. Lucius nodded and straightened himself out. "Come now, I won't have us be late."
Draco simply rolled his eyes in return and slouched against the couch, finding himself getting more and more comfortable on it. "When I'm older, I'm going to host a grand Christmas party at my house, just like my mother did. And I assure you, we will not be serving whatever poison is in that flask," Draco said smugly, smiling back at Harry who began to get as comfortable as he was.
"What? Do I have something on my face?" Draco snapped at him and Harry simply adjusted his glasses and tilted his head.
By the time of the party, the Malfoy home was converted into a winter wonderland for the festivities of the night. Lucius had charmed the room to have a swirling display of snowflakes that never melted, one to delight his guests and dazzle them with their wealth and status. The manor was decorated in swaths of silvery garlands and lush green drapes, warm red fireplaces lit and flutes of glittering champagne were passed around the room. It was the event of the season and only the best of the best were invited to the Malfoy home. They had hired a string band to play lovely assortments of classical pieces as hors d'oeurves were brought out on beautifully crafted plates.
"He came up to me, I couldn't shake him off." Harry muttered back, standing now rigidly next to Snape.
"Mr. Malfoy and I met so briefly at the party, I wished to discuss with you more," Ron smiled, nodding his head. "Please, tell me, what do you do."
"I suppose we would," Draco cooed softly. He watched as Harry rummaged through the pockets of his coat, "But sadly, impossible. If my father has anything to do with it, he'd have me married off by the time I'm 18. My future husband will probably be old, and ugly, and balding, but devastatingly rich. And then we'll live a happy life together until he inevitably dies and I take all his money, not that I need it." Draco spoke in a deflated and sarcastic tone that made Harry chuckle sardonically.
Draco braced the frigid winter air once more and clenched his fists as he ripped off a piece of the baguette and shoving it into his mouth. It was times like this that Draco missed his cushy little life back in Hogwarts. Warm and dry and full and far away from the scum of real life. But alas, real life does go on and men want a warm body to fuck into and Draco supposed someone has to do it. And he supposed a no-good, dirty, ex-death eater was exactly the right person to do it. What good was he if he couldn't use his magic, anyways? Sometimes, Draco wondered if this was what Professor Mcgonagall had originally planned for him. If this was his specific punishment. She had done well, if it was her intention. The bread filled Draco's hunger, if only for a little bit. He would come back to Dimitri's bakery later in the night, when it was closing time and the older man was getting the store ready for the next day. Dimitri always let the boy chose from the unsold pastries and Draco in return would offer a blowjob or a quick fuck. Dimitri wasn't a bad man. He was simply what he was. A man who was lonely and wanted a young, pretty thing on his lap. And Draco guessed he was a little lonely as well. They suited each other, in a way.
Draco's feet seemed to move by themselves as he trotted along behind Harry. He didn't exactly know where the brunette was taking him and he wasn't sure why he was following him anyways. The castle was eerily quiet in a way that Draco wasn't particularly fond of. The floors creaked and walls dripped and the whispers of ghosts and paintings buzzed in Draco's ears. It was a little unnerving, Draco could admit. Slytherin common room was in the dungeons of Hogwarts, so one would think he was used to the gloomy and morose surroundings, but if it were up to Draco he'd fashion it exactly the way his powder room looked back at home. It would definitely clash with the typical "down and dour slytherin" stereotype.
attitude that she so loved to parade and as much as Harry loved his dear friend, he couldn't stand the way Hermione sniffed the air with her nose up high, commenting on the smoke smell in the furniture, and grimaced as she swiped her finger against dusty cupboards. With a snap of his fingers, the end of cigarette glowed bright red between his lips. Harry leaned against the cold, wet stone of the wall that separated Knockturn Alley and Diagon Alley, taking slow pulls and letting the smoke curl from his lips in contemplation as he watched school children run to the shops to get their last minute goods. Oh, how he wished to be a child again sometimes. Running around with his best friends and visiting Hagrid in his cottage. Now, his days are lined with gruesome murders and empty cigarette cartons and Harry couldn't help but picture that poor girl on the ground, her mascara running down her face and sparkling blue eyeliner smudged.
Draco avoided Derbyshire like the plague for the past week. Much to his mother's chagrin, the snow haired boy couldn't bear the embarrassment that would be coming face to face with a certain dark-haired individual. It was as if Harry was possessed, speaking in tongues and chanting velvet temptations into Draco's ear, grip hot and heavy on fragile wrists. Fire lit up every nerve and vein through Draco's body and goosebumps erupted through porcelain skin. Draco remembers those wild eyes, how intensely they burned into his skin and froze Draco against that marble veranda banister. Draco could remember his lips, his wild hair and the veins bulging in his neck and the way his eyes roamed Draco's body as if he were prey. The silver-haired boy could feel electricity roaming up and down his body from head to toes and he remembers how badly he wished to reach out and grab the man by his lapels and-
"Oh yeah! I love it, I'm quite the little slut you know. No more hiding it now, daddy's little whore huh?" Draco snapped back, his eyes beginning to sharpen in the sunlight, no longer sweet doe eyes but the snake-like pupils Harry had known. It made Harry recoil slightly, hearing such abrasive and crude language come from the mouth of the boy who once told everyone in school that he took etiquette classes as a child.
"Well, a pair of cool, mysterious men just purchased estates near your home and you seem to be staring at one of them."
The issue with dictation spells was that it wrote exactly what the user says and if Draco were to spend anytime reading back his letter, he may not even have the guts to send it. He doesn't know why he's asking, considering Harry was most likely at the Weasley house for Christmas and detests grand parties such as this. But maybe...just maybe… Draco gulped and pushed on.
"Not when it's an excursion day." Harry smirked, grabbing Draco's hand and running, dragging the boy towards the school. "It's empty, I assure you. And if not, we can just get my father's cloak again."
Seeing Harry James Potter surrounded by ex-death eaters felt like somewhat of a fever dream, Draco thought as he brought his flute of champagne up to his lips. The Golden Boy of Hogwarts looked out of place in the Malfoy Manor, simply too shiny for the rest of the denizens of the dark corners of England. And while Harry remained a perfectly polite guest, Draco could tell that being surrounded by his supposedly familial sworn enemies was taking a toll on him. Every so often, Draco would catch the boy rubbing his forehead, along his infamous lightning bolt scar. It was a permanent reminder that Harry would always be different than Draco and his family. Different then all the Slytherin alumni and Pureblood heirs. But Draco was flattered nonetheless by the way that Harry would snake his arm around Draco's waist and rest his hand on his hip. The way Harry laughed along with well-known criminals and rubbed shoulders with once Dark Lord cronies. He's discussed it with Harry before, how he didn't mind Draco's family's lineage. How he was only one years old when his parents had disposed of the scourge that was Voldemort. How Harry was not the grand chosen one that everyone had thought he was. Draco didn't know if he really believed him.
"Perfect! I shall plan a party at once! I'll invite the entire town, perhaps even the sentinels!" Ron smiled, "I can't wait to see you in a lovely dress, Ms. Granger."
"Well...perhaps at the town hall tonight? I did hear a certain pair of men are moving into the neighborhood and perhaps they'll be at this certain soiree."
"So, what else will be included in our future Christmas? Children running around?" Harry had a bit of a sheepish smile on his lips as he turned back to Draco.
Harry nodded, coming closer to the boy and pulling out his wand from its harness. With a flick of the wrist, a paper appeared with Grimmauld Place's address, the ink fresh and still dripping. "Here," Harry said as she passed the paper to Draco, watching as the boy caressed the paper with his thumb for a second before folding it and shoving it in his back pocket. Harry nodded, "Well..alright then. I guess I'll..." He muttered
Draco's mouth opened, perhaps he'd comment on the architecture? Or the bedroom again? But Harry beat him to the punch and started up, "Listen...I have to go into work soon."
The banquet hall had been filled with the cheers of drunken gentlemen and the laughter of ladies being swept away into dances. A warm and golden yellow glow from candles and only slightly more neon chandeliers casted an inviting and intimate aura upon the party. The music from the orchestra had been playing nonstop and the dancing had only followed; men lifting women high in the air and women twirling around like an intricate courting dance done by birds covered in frills and pearls. One could easily get lost in the pandemonium, passed along bumbling guests all who had found their own personal niches within the festivities.
"Sorry sorry, you just.." Harry began to calm down, giggles subsiding. "You just remind me of my Aunt Petunia's grumpy old cat. A real feral little thing."
Harry still refused to tell Draco what this was all about, why he was so intent on moving the blonde. One would think he'd be less than pleased to see Draco alive. Afterall, he was his childhood bully and actively tried to conspire against Dumbledore himself. McGonagall had begged the Ministry for mercy.
"You opened yourself up to intimidation this way. Why did you leave your friends?" Mr. Potter's veins throbbed in his neck as he attempted to remain calm.
"I do believe that Mr. Nott is searching for you, Rodolphus." And there was Professor Severus Snape. With his pale white and spindly fingers, he was grasping Rodolphus's shoulder in a tight hold. Rodolphus growled a sound of displeasure as he shot his final dirty glare towards Harry before leaving entirely. Harry had never been fond of Snape, considering he was less than kind to him at school. They held a disregard for each other during school hours, while attempting to avoid each other as much as possible all other times. But for right now, Harry wanted to thank Snape and whatever else higher power there was that caused Rodolphus to leave him alone.
Draco frowned and shoved the glass back into Harry's hands. "I in no way attempt to be cute for your sake, Mr. Potter. Do realise that you come off as a perverted old lech when you tease me so."
"I-I didn't mean it as a bad thing, ya know?" Harry muttered, rubbing the back of his neck. "I rather like that you're posh… it's...it's cute."
"Would anyone care for a drink? We have wine, sweetened Brandy, iced tea, coffee?" Ronald asked as he gestured for a butler to come over with the brightly colored array of sweets and drinks. Draco reached out for a tea cup, eyes flashing slightly forwards. Expectedly, Harry was staring back at him, dagger-like intensity following his eyes as he watched Draco's plush pink lips curl around the rim of the cup, taking small sips. Harry's eyes followed the graceful slope of his neck with each swallow, only to look back at the mouth in question.
"Yes?" Draco asked, eyes wide and full of hope that made Harry's words feel even more heavy in his mouth.
"I could tell, you see, I saw an aura around you. As if you had a halo," the man smirked, toothy, Draco noted as hot breath hit his neck.
Hi everyone! Sorry about the hiatus on this story. I promise I didn't abandon it! Chapter updates will be a bit sporadic but I don't want you guys to lose faith! Please comment if you liked this new chapter! Thank you!!
Draco could see the red blood pooling in Harry's cheeks, his face and ears turning pinky. It made the blonde smile slightly, his eyes turning down at his lap as he takes a piece of his hair from his shoulder, playing with it and flicking it between his fingers. He couldn't bother to look at Harry knowing if he did, he'd probably wouldn't be able to contain his smile.
"Why yes, of course!" Hermione jolted up and the two of them scurried to the kitchen, tittering to themselves and trying to contain their laughter.
"Only the one next to me," he mused back, shooting a teasing glance at Draco and turning back when he heard the little joking gasp.
"It's the estate that's down the road from your home. Perhaps you'll be neighbors with a cool, mysterious gentlemen who'll sweep you off your feet~" Hermione smirked like a cat, mischievous and teasing.
"Well, I've never exactly cooked before. Never needed to before this. And I couldn't exactly conjure up a meal anymore," Draco lamented, picking up the ladle and dumping it in the sink with frustration.
"I suppose not, but God knows that you yearn for me," Harry smirks, his lips curling wickedly as Draco's eyes widened and his lips began to shiver slightly. "But alas, you are simply too infuriating for me, I weep for the man who is unfortunate enough to call you his wife." Harry dropped Draco's hands, walking back to the table to take his drink. Harry chuckled at the sound of Draco's frustrated growl, turning back around and opening his mouth to add to the fire, only to be interrupted by Hermione and Ron popping their heads out of the kitchen.
Harry glanced over at the boy and tsked, rolling his eyes impertinently and began to shrug off his overcoat, setting it heavily upon Draco's fragile shoulders. Before Draco could react or respond, Harry was already wrapping an arm around the younger boy's waist, bringing him closer. The grip was unsure and cautious, but Draco couldn't help but hide his face into the collar of the coat to hide the giddy smile growing on his lips. The scent of Harry lingered on the fabric of the coat and Draco nuzzled into it.
Draco stopped in his tracks and whipped around to his friend. "That's why you object him?? Because you're infatuated with the idea of my and Mr. Potter's relationship. I assure you, 'Mione, Mr. Potter and I are nothing but cordial."
"Well don't you two look lovely," Mr. Weasley smiled, sitting back down on the sofa. "As pretty as two pictures."
The wind blew fiercely along the grassy fields of Derbyshire, making the trees sway and whip into a frenzy. Draco's dress wrapped around his legs and waist as he was helped out of the carriage, trailing behind him was Hermione in her pretty cream colored dress. Ron and Harry were already there, sitting idly at the gazebo set up for their outting, smoking cigars and drinking scotch. At the notice of Draco and Hermione, both men stood and bowed, Draco's eyes never left the man who hadn't talked to him the entire day.
"Because it's better than being on the fucking streets isn't it?" Harry barked out, his tone surprising himself. It seemed to surprise Draco as well and the boy began to curl into himself even more than before.
Draco's face fell at the question, eyes scanning Mr. Potter's face to find nothing but frustration. As if this were Draco's fault!? "Excuse me?"
"You'll have a Spring wedding! Oh, you'll be the prettiest bride, Draco!" Hermione teased, twirling Draco around as they exited the shoppe. The boy whined, demanding Hermione stop as he felt his footing tangle and soon enough, Draco found himself falling backwards. The panic and fear lodged itself in Draco's throat as he braced himself to fall onto the cold, hard ground. No such pain came. In fact, Draco fell against a solid and warm structure, two arms suddenly snaking their way around his lithe waist. Draco stumbled back to his feet, dusting off and fixing his clothes as he apologized profusely, eyes drawn downwards.
Draco stepped closer which made Harry's mouth close shut abruptly. Draco looked up at the painting with a charming smile and his eyes like a doe. Even Harry was stuck staring at him. "Won't you let me in, once more? Please?" Draco begged, peering through darling eyelashes up at the Fat Lady. His pretty pink lips pouted and Harry found himself unable to look away.
A small clearing of the throat alerted the two. They turned their heads to find Hermione staring at them, hands on her hips and cocked head.
"Hey! Harry, where did you go?!" Ron came barging in the common room, shopping bags in hand and Hermione not far behind him. Harry and Draco pulled apart as quickly as possible, their faces as bright red as the Gryffindor red.
Draco groaned and began to run off towards his home, Hermione running after him with giggles filling the air.  Draco yelled a quick hello and goodbye to his parents as he ran up to his room and closed the door behind them, both him and Hermione falling onto the bed.
"Kreacher, please," He whined, temper ticking away as Kreacher continued to refuse and insist that Harry wasn't worthy of Grimmauld Place's hallowed halls. Before Harry could continue this excruciating back and forth, Draco stepped up before Harry, slip and pale fingers coming up to shush Harry's mouth. The blonde pulled the sweetest smile he could, tucking a hair behind his ear as he peered down at the elf.
Draco's cheeks grew hot as he rolled his eyes. "Unlike you, I don't waste my time reading tawdry and lust filled novels that I steal from my maids!" Draco stuck out his tongue as Hermione gasped.
"Oh, you wound me," Harry feigned pain as he clutched his heart dramatically. "What would your future spouse say if they heard that you swear like a sailor?"
Draco's cheeks turned bright red and he scoffed, pulling away from Harry's grasp. "Don't think I've fallen so easily, Mr. Potter. I assure you, you'll have to try much harder to win my affections before I could ever agree to marry you. I'll have you know, I have multiple suitors in line!"
At 18 years old, Draco was neither engaged, nor married. Much to his mother's disdain, Draco had never found himself drawn to romantic affairs like the girls in his classes, or the women his mother would bring home for tea and gossip. Narcissa often joked that Draco's dispassionate for romance was the bane of her existence. Her pretty child, as beautiful as fresh fallen snow on vibrant green English countryside, would rather bury his head in books and poetry than socialize and would rather dirty his hands and clothes with soil from gardening, than wear crisp white linens and lace. Narcissa often blamed her husband for Draco's rather independent and headstrong behavior. He was not docile and giddy like the other girls his age had been, but instead he was sharp tongued, rather crass at times and otherwise blunt. Although Draco's sarcastic comments often brought a smile and chuckle to his father's face, his mother abhorred this personality characteristic of her son. Draco, at times, could be rather charming and witty. In fact, he felt rather comfortable when confronted with a battle of wits. But, his mother feared that his slightly boorish behavior would scare away potential partners who would much rather prefer a bubbly airhead than a brooding scholar. Draco never really minded this fact and often told his mother he wouldn't mind never getting married (at this comment, Narcissa gasped and held her heart, telling Draco to not say such things).
"I see.. I'm glad those two have become such close friends. I secretly pray for their happiness," Draco smiled softly, his heart swelling at the thought of his friend happy and in love. Harry remained silent.
Their heavy breathes fell onto each other's skin, their eyes never broke contact. Draco felt the heat of Harry's stare on him and like always it burned, burned him from his core and made his skin itch and crawl. The fading sunlight flooded the room and casted a shadow upon Draco's face, illuminating his sharp features and showing the sparkle in his eyes.  Draco watched as Harry's hand raised up from his side and found its way to Draco's cheek. With the lightest of touches, he brushed away a lock of icy blonde hair that had fallen. Draco couldn't help but slightly, ever so slightly lean into the touch-
Fenrir Greyback's eyes narrowed as he took Harry's hand in his and shook it firmly. "My name is Fenrir Greyback. I wasn't aware the Chosen One would be here of all places, especially escorting the son of a former Death Eater."
In the corner, two large boxes, neatly wrapped in pretty satin bows, were brought up by a house elf. The sight of the elf was a bit conflicting for Draco, who had grown up in the care of many house elves, but after hanging around Hermione for long enough (not intentionally, but she was the most tolerable of the three), Draco's opinions on House Elf Labor Rights had made him feel slightly guilty. He thanked the elf profusely, bringing the blankets slightly closer to himself in an attempt to cover his silky nightie, one of the few pleasures he granted himself in exchange for itchy school robes. Once the elf had left with a small nod and a smile, Draco crawled out of the bed. He dragged the two boxes to his bed, flopping back down and reaching over to his nightstand to get his wand. With a flick of his hand, the two boxes opened and showed the things inside. One gift was from his mother, a pretty new dress she had found in the streets of Milan, one that she promised would look gorgeous on Draco's lithe form. A smile as bright as the glow of his wand grew on Draco's lips as he clutched the material in his hands. It was a beautiful velvet forest green, soft and plush to the touch. Open backed and spaghetti strapped, it would look lovely with a pair of black heels. Draco whipped out his wand and the dress was apparated into his closet. The next box was from Lucius and was smaller than the one from his mother. A little note was inside from Draco's father "To his darling child". Inside, a beautiful gold locket engraved with a rose and snake on the outside and Draco's initials on the back. It was dainty and fragile and Draco immediately slipped it around his neck. The cold metal clinked as he closed the clasp and small fingers played with it gleefully. It was gorgeous, surely antique. It would be easy to hide under his robes, Draco assured himself. Clutching it tightly brought a pang of sadness to Draco's heart, remembering that he would be celebrating his birthday alone.
The tea was shit, watery and bland. Everything was shit in Knockturn Alley. But Draco felt that he belonged here now, amongst the dirt and scum. Diagon Alley was only a few steps north and yet there was a line that Draco couldn't cross. He was dirty, he was cursed and he was not fit to join the denizens of the other world. But that was fine, Draco mused as he sipped his tea, he didn't need anything to tie him down in one place for too long. His shorts left his bruised legs vulnerable to the cold and his skin prickled with goosebumps. It was a far cry from the clothing he used to wear. The latest fashions from Paris, Milan, New York. They were soft and warm and luxurious. They were opulent and flamboyant and pretty. And what was wrong with being pretty? What was wrong with wishing to be a pretty boy? It had certainly been no surprise to Lucius and Narcissa when their little boy proclaimed that he had liked girly things and he had enjoyed boys more than girls (at the time, he had only meant holding hands. Not what he does on the daily now.) His parents hadn't minded. Lucius didn't treat him any differently, still solemn and yet fond and affectionate. Narcissa found this as an excuse to dress Draco like a doll, use him as a mannequin to sew new inventions of her own. His parents were good parents, Draco had confirmed. They had spoiled him rotten. He didn't ever see them as traitors to their own or cowards. They were affectionate and loving and Draco wasn't ashamed to say that sometimes he purposely sought out men who reminded him of his father. For no reason other than missing him dearly. The fact that they looked like his father was usually the last thing he thought about as they pinned him down and-
"Harry James Potter, how are you?" He asked with a smile that didn't meet his eyes. He ignored Draco's confused and surprised expression, simply continuing with steely resolve to stare the werewolf down.
"Hermione!" Draco whined, shaking the girl slightly in a feeble attempt to have her shush up. Draco turned to Theodore, unsure if he was about to deny the statement entirely or apologize with enthusiasm. Theodore simply smiled politely. "Yes, I know Mr. Potter. He and I were old school mates, you know it is." The brass church bells rang out at the stroke of the hour and Theodore sighed with disappointment. "Well, I suppose that's my cue to rejoin my troops." He turned to Hermione and bowed, "A pleasure to meet you, Ms. Granger." He then turned to Draco, taking his delicate hand in his and kissed the back of it with a mischievous smirk on his lips. "And it was an immense pleasure to see you again, Mr. Malfoy."
Harry's lips tweaked into a small smile, only to fall once again. "Remember when we talked last time...what we talked about?" Draco nodded. "Well...this kinda, I don't know, helps slightly? Makes the questions and the worries kinda dull for a few minutes."
"I know, I know." Harry patted down his pockets and scoffed, "I'm out of cigarettes, I'm going to take a walk and get some. I can't look at this shit anymore," he grumbled, waving back at Ron as he walked down the cobblestone streets, passing the other Aurors that came to investigate the body. Harry didn't come to Knockturn Alley often. He found himself unable to cross the line into the other side of town, the side that lurked in the shadows and filled Harry's mind with inky memories of the past. Hermione insisted Harry had trauma; every time she visited Harry at Grimmauld Place, she mentioned that he should talk to a professional about his recurring nightmares, the sweats he would break into in the middle of the night, and his moments of paranoia and anxiety. Harry scoffed at the idea. The past was the past and what was the point of digging up old bones? It had been a few years since Harry returned to Knockturn Alley and now that he was here, he remembered why he didn't bother to come by anymore. The sight was depressing, grey and murky with sewage seeming down the broken pipes and into the street. Harry made no eye contact as he walked towards the corner store, paid the 10 galleons for a carton of cigarettes, and made his way back to his work.
"I care not for the eligibility of pig-headed men. They'll drool over anything that walks," Draco muttered bitterly as a servant girl dabbed light pink rouge onto his cheeks. His comment had made the girl giggle, to which Draco smiled fondly.
The man was well aware of his son's affinity for sweet things: dolls and rouge on his cheeks, ribbons and lace. He knew this and it was fine, Draco will not be the patriarchy that Lucius was, perhaps he never will be. That was all fine. At first, disappointment had rattled through him as he watched his child on the floor, as he used to play with conjured up dolls, his mother's porcelain poppets. Lucius had imagined Draco to be like him, walking in his footsteps. But that dream was quickly shattered. His son, sweet and naive, was shy. He was easily frustrated and all too gullible. He was coddled, he was too...soft. So the minute Draco turned 10, one year before his admittance to Hogwarts, Lucius banned Narcissa from dressing Draco in anything too feminine, just so that he was not made to be a weak opponent. Draco may not strike fear in the hearts of others, but at least he will be a proper gentleman. If Narcissa had her way, the boy would be dressed in a new frock everyday, wrapped in satin and lace and wearing a face full of makeup. Lucius suspected that Draco perhaps wouldn't mind that necessarily, and perhaps if they were in a different situation, he would have let him. It's not the middle ages anymore, Lucius reminds himself. Children wish to explore themselves and Lucius never would want to be the type of father his only son resented.
Draco could see himself being comfortable in Hogwarts. It wasn't Beauxbaton, but it was charming and beautiful in it's own old and antique way. The paintings on the walls all tittered upon seeing him and the ghosts that lurked in the halls all bowed their heads, old italian men who wished to kiss his hands and call him "Bella". It was definitely a boost to his ego, knowing that he was gracing the Halls of Hogwarts with his beauty. His mood was high, his head swollen with compliments. That was until he heard…
Draco peered over to Harry and then back at the TV, "I got hungry and I wasn't about to wait for you to get home. You don't have to look so suspicious. It's not poisoned or anything." He spat back.
"Should I be expecting a future son-in-law?" Lucius asked with a teasing smirk, chuckling at the way Draco fumed and spat out a breathless 'No!'
Mr. Potter was only slightly shorter than Mr. Weasley, but still stood taller than Draco. With wild dark black hair that curled in every which way, and hazel eyes that seemed darker in the golden lighting, Mr. Potter was a stoic and serious man, one of few words and fewer emotions. With a tight jaw, he gave small nods to passing guests, nothing more than a hello and goodbye. He was darker skinned, only slightly tanner than Hermione, which made Draco believe he lived in a sunny area, perhaps even outside of England. The longer Draco stared at the pair of men, Hermione's smile grew.
Draco hid his face into the pillows, kicking his legs like a petulant child. Hermione dug him out, "I'm right, aren't I?"
Draco glanced over his shoulder and noticed a boy staring back at him, brown wild hair and big green eyes. Glasses that sat awkwardly on his face and baggy clothes that don't exactly fit on his scrawny body. But he was cute. Draco could admit that. The boy was cute with the way he stared back at Draco, his floppy hair covering his eyes and the way he brushed it back to gaze longer at Draco. Draco's eyes scanned the boy, much like Lucius does when appraising a piece of art for the foyer or examining the outfits Narcissa dressed Draco in for their nightly dinners. As Draco waited by Lucius' side, his father chatting with the cashier who, upon seeing Lord Malfoy and his son, scurried to the back to get his things.
Draco had gotten up to his bedroom when he noticed the tapping at his window, a little beak pecking and the scratching of talons. Lizzie followed closely and hopped onto the bed, watching with curious eyes as Draco opened his window.
Draco's Great Uncle turned towards a passing waiter in order to refill his emptied cup of wine, which allowed Harry to quickly snag Draco by the arm and yank him away, causing the blonde to giggle as the two of them ran off like school children. The brunette brought them over to a secluded corner of the ballroom. With Draco leaning against the wall and Harry draped over him, it was difficult to distinguish who they were to prying eyes. The warmth of the room from the roaring fireplaces made Draco's body tingle and their breaths came out in pants. Harry's lips curled sweetly into a teasing smile which made Draco's skin prickle into goosebumps. It reminded him of that one winter night, the night when they first snuck into the Gryffindor Common Room and the first time they truly looked into each other's eyes. Harry peered down at the blonde in his arms, his smile wide and eyes squinted happily as he brought a hand up to brush back a loose strand  of hair from Draco's cheek. Draco bit his lip and slightly curled into Harry's touch.
"Yeah, he's… beautiful," Harry murdered back, eyes never leaving the blonde vixen that lit up the room like a ball of lightning.
Draco growled and rolled his eyes, "I don't need this, I don't wish to waste a lovely party." He was about to stop off before he was pulled back in by the arm. Draco whipped around to scowl once more.
So here Draco was, one year later and Draco finds himself seeking Thomas out when he's at his lowest, when the sadness is creeping up his throat and threatens to spill ink in his brain. Draco wrapped himself up in a wool sweater and parka, creeping outside the best he can. Thomas was already outside, standing cooly against the stone corridor wall.
Hermione squealed and Draco instantly regretted his decision. "I knew it! I knew you thought he was handsome! Oh please can I plan your wedding!! It can be in the gardens or- oh!! It could be at Derbyshire! That would be so grand! And we could hire a lovely orchestra and Ronald will hold a party and it'll be so lovely-" Hermione was cut off by Draco smacking her lightly with a pillow, causing the girl to fall back onto the bed.
"He's right, Pans. He doesn't need any Amortentia~ don't you see how Potter is absolutely obsessed over him already?" Blaise cooed, pinching Draco's pink cheek teasingly. Draco huffed and pushed his hand away. "Aww, look, our little boy, all grown up and already has a stalker!" Blaise clasped his hands together and pouted. The image of a proud parent.
Harry hadn't really thought this out. He had asked Draco to come in as his housekeeper, but in all honesty, did he really expect the blonde to be on his hands and knees, scrubbing the floor? (Although, the sight might not be that terrible). "Um...just...get comfortable, I suppose. There is a television if you'd like to watch something. And Kreacher will be here if you need anything."
"Yeah, if I was a 12 year old girl," Draco couldn't help but mumble bitterly. He doesn't know why he was so taken aback by the room, it wasn't as if he disliked it. It was….charming and pretty and it reminded Draco of the doll house his cousins used to play with. But the idea that Harry had purposely chosen it for him made Draco's insides bubble.
Draco gasped, setting down his tea cup with a loud clunk that rang and echoed throughout the room, "Oh, what ancient thinking you have, Mr. Potter. And here I was to believe money and class was to make a man above petty beliefs, but it seems that it only causes a man to become ignorant and crass!"
Draco's lips shut abruptly. "Y-yeah that makes sense," he stammered as Harry went up the staircase, leaving the blonde alone once more. By the time he had finished changing into his work attire, Harry had noticed that Draco didn't move an inch from his seat-- tightly wound and skittish it seemed.
Draco made himself quite comfortable in his new room, a double made single specifically for him. He knew it was extravagant and lavish, but his father insisted that he be given his own accommodations. After all, Draco's never needed to share a room before, he might get overwhelmed. He knew that this would probably irritate his fellow Slytherin students who were forced to share rooms of two or more, but then again, he was a Malfoy and Malfoys deserved the best. Elizabeth was perched on Draco's bed, covered with a fine down duvet and satin blanket. She had been given a gold locket collar, and even Draco could say that was beyond extravagant. But like himself, his cat seemed to enjoy the finer things in life and absolutely refused to wear anything else.
Ron nodded, "Right. That makes sense. I mean, Ginny has been gone a while now, so it must be difficult." He didn't notice as Harry tensed up in his spot at the Floo, suddenly looking as if death itself had gone through him. "Well it's a good thing she's coming home in a few days right?" Ron continued, taking out his wand. "I'll see you tomorrow man," he said as he swished his wand and disappeared in an instant, no doubt eager to scurry home to Hermione.
Dinner was a silent affair. No one dared to break the silence that had formed around them except for the clattering of heavy rain against the windows. Ron and Hermione glanced over to each other with worried eyes, noticing that both their guests had turned into a sour mood.
Lucius glanced back over, only to do what could be considered a "double take". "By Merlin's Beard.. that's...that's Harry Potter!"
Harry simply laughed against, a deep billowing chuckle from his chest which made Draco feel younger than he had before, slightly embarrassed but also keeping his resolve. Harry nodded, bringing Draco back into his arms and running his hands through soft blonde hair. "Of course. I will court you properly, if you wish."
"I trust you boys had a grand time running around like wild dogs." Hermione teased, eyes drifting back and forth between Draco and Harry.
Draco stopped dead in his tracks. With a growl that could only remind Harry of an angry kitten, he watched the blonde stomp towards him with fiery passion in his eyes and a scowl on his lips. Harry began backing up until his back was pressed against a wall and Draco was staring up at him, jaw clenched.
"Why did you even bring me here? I doubt it's because you cherish seeing my face everyday." Draco retorted with his hands on his waist and his hip cocked. He broke his eye contact with Harry, no longer able to stare too long at the man before him. For some reason, Draco's cheeks became hot every time he stared into those forest green eyes. A cold, perhaps? Or perhaps it was the blind hatred that he had once felt for the man, curling its way back up Draco's spine.
"And why would you even do that?! We aren't pals!" Draco said exasperatedly, nearly throwing his hands in the air. "In fact, if you do recall, you almost FUCKING KILLED ME IN THE DORMITORY BATHROOMS!"
"Oh?" Narcissa smugly smirked. "Just...a classmate?" She asked and Draco hissed out a 'mother!', which made the older woman chuckle at the sight of her flustered little boy. "Well, it's rather fetching. Must have cost a pretty penny, about… 200 galleons?"
After a swipe of chapstick on his lips and a small dose of perfume Narcissa had sneaked onto her child, Lucius and Draco were off through the Floo.
In the beginning, Draco had been angry. Angrier than he had ever been in his life. He cursed Albus Dumbledore, he cursed Minerva McGonagall, he cursed Voldemort and he cursed his parents for forcing him to join such a wicked and evil group. He was only a child at the time, impressionable and naive and willing to follow his parents' footsteps through thick and thin. They had wanted him to be the proud Malfoy pureblood heir and that's what he was. He was a cruel child, Draco realizes that now, but he couldn't help but feel cajoled into the role of tormentor. He was angry, viciously so. Why was he being punished for their misdoings? He was being dumped back into the world; penniless, alone, and without any substantial magic. Wasn't that a punishment worse than death itself? How was this supposed to be benevolence? The first winter on the streets had been difficult. Draco had nearly been on the brink of death, huddled in the corner with the other degenerates that littered the streets. He had felt his fingers beginning to numb and his once pink lips cracking and Draco knew in that moment that he would die. And yet, he still had been able to pick out Draco's shivering blonde head out of the masses. 100 galleons and a warm shower for a quick fuck. Draco looked up at the man with his desperate grey doe eyes and nodded. That man, face long forgotten, had been Draco's first customer.
In the few hours Draco was able to sleep, he dreamt of the fire. The burning room in which his friends screamed was a familiar setting for his nightmares, but this time he did not dream of the terror on Crabbe’s face as the flames engulfed him or the scorch of ash in his throat as he realized he was about to die. Instead, he dreamt of a hand reaching through the shimmering heat, promising Draco safety.
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy, I do believe you should,” he finally answered, voice firm. “As a precaution against irresponsible experimenting, you need a qualified sponsor in order to enter the competition. I am willing to help you put your names and project forward for consideration, but only if you both agree.”
“But you said yourself, you don’t hate him anymore,” she pointed out. “Which, by the way, when did you stop hating Potter?”
By a combination of sheer luck and some desperate clutching at the banister, he managed to stay upright, barely regaining his footing before he was off again. He could hear Blaise’s footsteps pounding behind him but he didn’t bother to pause and let the other boy catch up.
” another voice insisted. “Just yesterday he took a turn down a staircase that I happen to know leads to a dead end, just to avoid me!”
Weasley seemed on the brink of a retort but was interrupted by the loud bang of the dungeon door hitting the wall. An irate-looking Slughorn appeared, his voice forcedly cheerful as he ushered his students inside. Apparently, everyone had been too focused on Draco and Potter’s confrontation to heed the bell signalling the start of class.
Draco had hoped that, after a while, he might get used to Potter’s uncanny stare. But the weight of the green eyes was heavy as ever, seeming to follow him even after they parted ways each evening. Some nights, it would trail Draco all the way back to his dormitory where he would lie awake, wrapped up in green. More than once, looking up at the emerald fabric of his canopy, he found his hands slipping under his pyjama bottoms, stroking himself with an unexplained desperation until the green exploded into stars. He found he slept much better those nights.
He glanced over his shoulder, wondering if Potter had grown bored of this yet. They had both gravitated slowly towards the back of the shop and were now much closer than Draco had expected, only a couple of the larger barrels of ingredients between them. Potter was staring curiously down into one of the containers, hand on the rim of it, his fingers only centimetres away from the greenish, fungus-like contents.
Blaise prodded at the flames beneath his cauldron with his wand until they reached the low, steady level that Draco had already achieved.
Draco’s eyes flickered to the infamous scar on Potter’s forehead, wondering what other injuries had left permanent marks on his body.
“I think…” He hesitated just a moment longer. He knew the words were true, but that didn’t do anything to alleviate their heavy weight on his tongue. They sat at the back of his throat, leaden, and since he could no longer swallow them, the only option left was to spit them out. “I think I’m gay.”
The words sprang into his mind unbidden, the phrase he had repeated over and over in his dream. He flushed as the images he had tried to suppress returned, all of which involved the black-haired boy currently sitting beside him, albeit in much more compromising positions. As much as he wanted to tear his gaze away, he could not help but stare at the breadth of Potter’s shoulders, the exposed skin of his neck, the curve of his mouth…
“Er.” Weasley and Granger both looked over at Potter, who was still busy staring at Draco, a silent question in his eyes that Draco knew he wouldn’t be able to answer in front of their friends. When Potter gave no response, Granger turned back to Pansy and Draco. Draco hoped wildly that one of them would just say no, the seats were actually taken, and there was no way they could possibly sit there.
Somehow, she managed to fit one book into her bag, but when she continued to struggle with the others, Draco gave in and went to take back the remaining books from her arms.
Draco glanced down, realizing for the first time that half his chest was still exposed. Somewhere along the line, he had completely forgotten to finish buttoning up his shirt.
Potter paused at that, considering. The uncertainty in his expression shifted in a way that was all too familiar, and all too concerning. There was challenge written in the line of his mouth and the glint of his eyes as he turned, a contained fire. Draco wondered if anyone else could feel it burn as he did.
“Back to the drawing board, I guess.” Draco smoothed out a fresh sheaf of parchment in front of him, tapping it thoughtfully with his quill. “Starting from scratch will take too long. I think our best bet is to try and find a way to make the potion penetrate more quickly.”
Draco didn’t turn as he spoke. “What do you care? Like I said before, you don’t need to worry about doing any of the work. I’ve got it covered.”
This… well. Draco didn’t know what this was. It was still clumsy at times, frantic at others. They were teenagers still, but adults too. The facts of it were perhaps not so different, but somehow it was a world apart, incomparable in every way. Draco suspected that Potter was not nearly as inexperienced, so he knew it probably wasn’t the same for him, not quite so breathtaking in every sense of the word.
This was not the answer Draco had expected. “Your potions skills improved because you had help from Snape’s old textbook?” he scoffed. “Potter, you do realize that you had Snape actually teaching you for five years before that, right?”
And if the constant physical pain, crushing boredom, and unspeakable vulnerability of having to depend on other people were not enough, Draco was also forced to deal with the mental torment induced by his last encounter with Potter. Memories of what could only be described as their almost-kiss plagued his every waking thought. Sleep, unfortunately, was no safer: his brain seemed determined to cast Potter as the leading role in every one of his fantasies, no matter how much Draco wished otherwise.
But no, that wasn’t right. He took a shallow breath. The room was dark, familiar, silent. This wasn’t the manor. There was no one sobbing, no one begging for mercy. He could hear Goyle snoring, just to his left. He was at Hogwarts, in his dormitory. The war was over. He was safe.
“Are these seats taken?” Pansy asked, gesturing at the open end of the sofa and the empty armchair beside them.
Potter had grown bored with pretending to listen to Slughorn’s story, or perhaps he sensed that he was being watched, because just then he turned his head. As he caught Draco in his stare, the blonde became acutely aware that he hadn’t just been looking at Potter—he had been
“Nonsense! It’s not an exam, no need for perfection,” Professor Hayward chirped. “Would you like to help me give just a quick demonstration? It’s your choice, of course.”
It was as Potter tilted his head, the tip of his tongue brushing entreatingly against the seam of Draco’s lips, that Draco became aware of just how intimate their position really was. As they both angled into the kiss, Potter’s hips slid further against the sensitive skin on the inside of Draco’s thighs, their bodies slotting dangerously together. Any closer and it would become all too excruciatingly apparent just how much Draco liked the texture of Potter’s mouth, and how much every part of him ached for more.
Draco flipped back through his journal, searching for the list that he had made last week of possible potion additives. “Yes?”
Draco found this to be a very odd response. “Potter? Why would I be talking to Potter half-dressed?”
“I’m just… trying to figure out what in the bloody hell you think you’re doing,” Draco said, trying to regain even a shred of his previous composure which seemed to have disappeared quicker than Potter’s clothes. He ignored the sounds of a zipper –
“It was a mistake,” Potter whispered, voice cracking. Draco had the absurd urge to hold him, to cradle that fragile glass sound as if it were something precious.
Surely Potter, more than anyone, knew the burden that a scar could be; surely he must understand the weight of being forever marked with a relic of misfortune and suffering, the pain of being permanently branded with a reminder of the past. What kind of person wouldn’t want to be free of that?
Professor Hayward, misinterpreting the glance, offered, “If you would prefer, you could do the demonstration with another student – Miss Granger or Mr. Weasley, perhaps?”
“Still?” Draco reached for the letter Pansy had tossed aside onto a plate of bacon, quickly scanning its contents. “Merlin’s balls, you would think she’d have run out of options by now. How many eligible pureblood bachelors in Britain can there be?”
"You know," Draco drawled, "I had never really thought much about Muggles. I thought they were all unfortunate degenerates." Harry couldn't help but roll his eyes, but Draco continued. "But I was wrong. They really are fascinating. I mean, I've been watching this….tellie-vision all day and I've learned many things about the Muggle World."
"Sorry princess, but your dormitory isn't exactly the prime example of cozy comfy living," Harry said as he finally fished out the object he was looking for. In this regard, Draco could say Harry was right. Although the color combinations of greens and silvers were Draco's favorite, he preferred them in a lighter setting, much like his own bedroom back home. While his bedroom was airy and light and reminiscent of the Roccoco French period, the Slytherin Common Rooms were simply dour, old and macabre.
"No, none of that. I hate grand parties, always feel like I don't fit in." Harry scrunched up his nose in distaste. "Pick something else."
On his 11th birthday, like most little boys before him, Draco received his invitation to Hogwarts academy for promising young wizards and witches. It was inevitable, after all. His family was entirely made up of purebloods and distinguished donors to the school for many centuries. His father had gone to the school, his father's father, his father's father's father and so on. It was no surprise then, really, when the little white envelope came fluttering through his window and landing directly on his bed, all wrapped up in a pretty red wax seal. Lucius, his father, grand patriarchy of the Malfoys, had been beyond proud of his child. Beyond his tough exterior and marble stone features, was a warm man and a warmer father. He scooped Draco up off his feet in an embrace, cooing into his ear of how proud he was and how Draco would honor them all, how he would bring pride to the Malfoy name. The thought of his father being proud of him had pulsed jolts of satisfaction up Draco's little body, and his smile widened as wide as it could. His mother, Narcissa, although proud, had lamented greatly that her little fleur would not be attending the distinguished Beauxbaton school in France, the one she had attended in her girlhood. (Draco would never admit it, but he had secretly wished for his enrollment there. He adored the light blue uniform and the beautiful aesthetics of Paris. It was magical, after all. The city of love! It reminded Draco of all the stories his mother had told him, recanting her time in Paris with such passion and a twinkle in her eye.) Narcissa was proud nevertheless.
