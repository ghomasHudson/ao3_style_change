"No no, not at all. In fact I rather think you'd take plenty of time in the mirror to ensure that you're absolutely spotless, huh?" Harry had a half smile on his face and Draco felt like half laughing.
"What are we not telling me?" Lucius strolled into the room, ever the lordly lion he was. He walked with the grace and poise that any distinguished gentleman would be expected to have. To others, Lucius came off as a fearsome and solemn man who was not to be trifled with. But for the likes of Draco, he was a kind and loving father. Once the accusations of being cronies with the Dark One had subsided, the Malfoy name was vindicated, if only to be rumored about in the back alleys and corners of different walks of life.
"Y-yes, of course." Draco stammered, remembering proper pureblood manners. He straightened his back and finished the rest of his champagne, leaving the glass on the banister. "Come now, it's only proper that we introduce ourselves to every guest here. Being the host and the host's date and all."
"Yeah, like...you're a right daddy's boy but it's sweet...it suits you."
was his second thought as the flashes of cameras went off around him. It's been two years since he was hired to be an Auror and although Harry swears up and down that
Draco gingerly sat down on the couch; the couch that he once had sat down upon that fateful night. It felt odd doing this in the daytime, as if their entire routine was off. But Draco found he didn't mind, now that he could see Harry's face in full view. Harry Potter, now 15...maybe even 16 years old. His skin was a finely tanned color, going well with his emerald green eyes. Dark brown, wild hair that seemed to fall in all the right places, strong hands and a strong jaw. Draco hadn't realized he was openly gawking until Harry turned back around and let out a little chuckle. The sound snapped Draco out of his gaze and made his cheeks fluster. "H-how come we never go to the Slytherin Common Rooms??" He huffed in attempt to change the subject.
Harry pretended as if he hadn't noticed Draco's hesitation. He shouldn't push him, he knows. Draco probably had dealt with a lot and Harry wasn't going to be the one to make him face unpleasant memories. He entered the kitchen and was greeted by what seemed like a hurricane. All around him were dirty utensils, vegetable scraps, crumbled up napkins. And on the stove was a single bubbling pot, the metal lid clamoring as it steamed and spat. Harry was quick to turn off the fire, nervous that the entire house would burn down with how high it was. "What the-" he muttered, fishing around for a cloth to use to lift the scorching hot lid. The steam hit his face immediately, making his glasses fog up. Harry put down the lid and took off his glasses, wiping them down on his shirt, and then placing them back on. He waved away some of the steam and peered inside curiously.
"I assure you, I have no idea what you're talking about," Draco huffed, sauntering off to the next aisle. Hermione trailed behind, arms behind her back and teasing grin on her thin pink lips.
Harry scoffed, letting a snide chuckle out from under his breath. "Yes, well. I should have expected a brat like you to not be capable in housework." The comment slithered out like a snake from Harry's lips, wrapping around the blonde's neck and making his cheeks burn. Draco couldn't blame Harry for his sour attitude towards him. He deserved it after all these years, but the remark still did leave Draco's mouth dry. He had endured his own comments from others: princess, brat, dumb blonde, snake, traitor-- and while Draco's responses back usually involved a hex or a spell, he found himself defenseless now and like a angered child backed into a wall, all he could do was spit back.
"Yes...er..where's…" Draco sat down gingerly and accepted the cup.
As the trio came closer, Draco rolled his eyes, but tried his best to be cordial, something his father insisted he do no matter who it was he was addressing. "Weasley, Potter…" he nodded towards them, suddenly standing up straighter, legs together, fists curled in his sleeves.
Hi everyone! Please comment if you liked this new chapter and if you'd like to perhaps see more of this story with Harry and Draco grown up? Married life? Children? Anyways, thank you! :)
It's hard to sleep when a figure haunts your dreams and leaves you in a hot and mangled mess in your sheets. Harry didn't understand his feelings towards a certain snow-haired boy. Draco Malfoy was infuriating, conceited and terribly unpolished. He was arrogant, childish, and crude. And yet...Harry couldn't help but feel magnetized towards the boy, the beautiful boy with soft white skin and lovely pink cheeks and clouded grey, slate eyes. Harry couldn't help but seek out the witty, playful, teasing, adorable, flustered….
"Mother...don't you think this is a bit-"
Christmas in the Malfoy house was always a lively event. Draco had woken up that morning to the sound of his mother's voice, shouting out different commands to the staff. The window glass was frosted over with the fresh snow that had fallen the night before, still soft and white and surreal. They were in their winter home in the french countryside, one that Draco had fond memories of as a child. Draco quickly shimmied out of bed and wrapped a fluffy blue robe around himself to cover his silky periwinkle nightgown slip. He strolled sleepily over to the window and gently put his fingertips against the glass, watching as the frost disappeared and the heat of his breath made a clear spot. A clattering sound of broken dishes from downstairs and a string of curses from his mother caused Draco to wake from his exhausted trance and walk to his dresser, grabbing his silver hairbrush. He meticulously combed equally as silvery locks, finally tying off a braid with a ribbon bow at the ends. Draco's eyes looked back at his reflection in his mirror. Even in the morning did he look like an absolute vixen. With a little twitch of his lips up into a smile, Draco hummed as he began to apply creams, serums, and small tubs of potions. Before finally standing up, Draco glanced over to the glittering hairpin on his dresser, next to the rest of his accessories. The sight of it reminded Draco of that day in the Commons and the memory of almost kissing Harry Potter made his cheeks burn up more than the winter chilly air did. Draco took the clip in his hand and quickly slid it into his hair, just near his ear. It sparkled when it caught the light of the early winter sun and shone bright white like the rest of the dazzling snow outside. Draco thought of the snow that surrounded The Lake near school, the one that Harry had taken him to. He pushed the memory to the back of his head and set off for breakfast.
"I'm done!" He exclaimed hurriedly and pushed out his chair with a loud screech, watching as the owl took off from it's branch in one powerful swoop.
As the carriage waited outside the manor, Ronald and Harry walked their two guests outside, taking their hands to help them into the compartment. Draco took one hand and one foot, tempted to simply haul himself inside, but soon an open hand was presented to him to take. Draco's eyes never left Harry's as he took his open palm and climbed inside the carriage. The man soon turned around and left, without a word being spoken. The carriage drove off and Draco was now too far away from the Manor to see Harry curl his fingers into a fist and then stretch them out again.
"God help us all," Draco sighed, feeling the unnerving stare of a certain older man on him. And this time, he smiled slightly at the thought.
It wasn't a surprise when Draco was sorted into Slytherin. Historically, his family had always been Slytherin. His godfather, after all, was a Slytherin headmaster. Draco had always been fond of his Uncle Snape. Like his father, Severus Snape has always been a solemn man of little words. He showed his affection through actions instead of words. So upon greeting Draco during his arrival, he gave the boy a quick hug and tossel of his hair, then disappeared once more to attend to teaching duties.
Harry nodded hurriedly, his gelled back hair beginning to fall out of place and he knew that Ron would be wondering what had happened to him back at the crime scene. But he didn't really care. In this moment, he could only really focus on Draco before him and the idea of his little body on the snowy ground, vulnerable and lifeless.
"I suppose we would," Draco cooed softly. He watched as Harry rummaged through the pockets of his coat, "But sadly, impossible. If my father has anything to do with it, he'd have me married off by the time I'm 18. My future husband will probably be old, and ugly, and balding, but devastatingly rich. And then we'll live a happy life together until he inevitably dies and I take all his money, not that I need it." Draco spoke in a deflated and sarcastic tone that made Harry chuckle sardonically.
"Please darling, you'd look so pretty! Besides, there will be hundreds of handsome eligible bachelors at the party," Narcissa huffed as she began curling Draco's locks, holding them together and pinning them in place. Draco's hair had been put in small curlers to create loose and wavy ringlets. Narcissa called it 'enchanting' while Draco called it 'ridiculous'.
"A shame, really. I was hoping to see the rest of the house," Draco drawled on, his fingers shifting and twirling down drapery and statues.
Harry's eyes skipped over to Draco's. It made both boys freeze slightly.  Draco didn't exactly know what they were. They didn't exactly talk to each other, but they weren't very rude to each other either. Sometimes they'd exchange short quips before being pulled away by their respective parties. Draco had noticed that Harry wasn't like the boy he was the first time they'd met. He'd rather filled into his clothes, becoming stronger and more built (perhaps it was all the quidditch). As much as Draco enjoyed the boys in Slytherin, he finds himself having a preference of the boyishly charming Gryffindor men who look as though they're dumber than hammers but good Lord could they probably lift Draco up like a feather. Harry's lips slightly curled at the corners and Draco's powder blush wasn't very necessary now was it? His cheeks were already turning cherry red.
"Did not!"
"Is that what you want?"
Please comment :) ❤️ I've been recently informed that Draco has grey eyes, not green so please forgive that little oopsie. If you see that in previous chapters, I'm sorry lol from now on I'll try to fix that
"Perhaps Mr. Malfoy would be more suited in a dress as well," Harry muttered under his breath, rolling his eyes at the scalding look Draco whipped in his direction.
"Does Minerva know about this?" The Fat Lady whispered back, her eyes shifting back and forth as if she was scared the head mistress of Gryffindor would suddenly aparate in front of them.
Draco rolled his eyes at the term of endearment. "I suppose we should keep our intentions a secret for now?"
Harry's eyes peered over his shoulder, his body pivoting on his heel. In front of him was a face from schooltime past. It was a face that Harry could never forget, it stared back at him with the same coy smirk that was always plastered on pink lips. Standing in front of him was Draco Malfoy and Harry hadn't seen him since his trial, almost four years ago. It would seem that Draco was just as surprised to see Harry, his eyes widening and wispy eyelashes blinking once-twice-
"Oh? Is my pretty Draco home so soon?" Lucius came around the corner, glasses in hand. Draco soon straightened his back, smiling up at his father. He was enveloped in a large hug, one that he openly nuzzled into. Once the hug broke, Lucius guided Draco into the drawing room.
"No worries," Harry said back quickly. "I suppose it would look bad for nasty old Filtch to catch the Slytherin princess out past curfew, snogging with an upperclassman," Harry scoffed back with a smug grin on his face, brimming with glee as Draco's cheeks turned redder than they were from the frigid air.
Draco's mouth opened, perhaps he'd comment on the architecture? Or the bedroom again? But Harry beat him to the punch and started up, "Listen...I have to go into work soon."
Well, Harry doesn't know how much more fondness he could take. He took out his wand from its holster, a flick and a spell and he was being wooshed away.
Draco turned his head slightly to the Gryffindor table. It was loud and rowdy and improper and yet Draco couldn't help but feel drawn to it slightly. The Trio was seated promptly there, Hermione's nose in a book and Ron and Harry messing around. Draco couldn't help but feel a little jealous of the skinship between everyone in Gryffindor. They all seemed so chummy and comfortable with each other and Draco has never really known friendship like that.
"I'll warn you now, Potter. Draco Malfoy is the closest thing I have akin to a son," Snape muttered candidly, his honest tone causing Harry to snap his neck towards the man and stare. "If I find that he has been….hurt in any way. I will not even put up a fight as I am removed from Hogwarts when they find your petrified body outside in the courtyard."
"Yeah… I am an idiot," Harry sighed, allowing Draco to further dig into his chest. He closed his eyes, attempting to stay in the moment. "We'll get married at 18, have kids at 20. We could live in Grimmauld Place, I inherited it from my Uncle..or-or we could live here. Or anywhere you want, Draco." Harry mused, reveling in the soft humming against his neck. "You'll be mine...and-and I'll be yours."
"You don't have to fake kindness, Potter. I'm not that precious." Draco leaned against the cabinets and Harry watched as he fiddled with the kitchen dish cloth. His shirt was slightly dirty, a pale yellow spot staining it's white fabric. Draco had tied up his now shoulder length hair, the loose strands around his ears flying every which way, no doubt from toiling over the bubbling soup. It was evident that he had worked hard on his project and the fact made Harry's stomach bubble warm and it wasn't just from the soup.
"Found any thugs and miscreants, Uncle?" Draco mused, smug little smile on his lips that made Severus roll his eyes fondly.
Draco's hands immediately came up to cross over his chest, holding onto his own arms in a defensive stance. Harry took in every inch of Draco Malfoy: his porcelain alabaster skin that looked sickly pale under the street lamps of Knockturn, his snowy hair that had grown out into a tangled mess, his slim waist that looked like it would topple over if hit by a gust of wind…
"Now now, don't treat me any differently," Draco said as he pushed the man away, ignoring the sad whine from Harry's chest. "Go back to your rude, bitter, and sardonic ways. And I hope you won't treat me like such a precious glass figurine when we are in private, it's quite infuriating actually." They rounded the Manor entrance and Harry smiled and shrugged.
"That unsightly little miscreant is Ronald Weasley," Lucius tutted. "His father and I worked together at the Ministry of Magic. The entire family is a mismatched group." Lucius gripped the books from the counter and turned around in order to leave with his son.
Harry blinked, standing in the Floo portal of his home. Draco was laying on the couch, sprawled across like a particularly pampered cat, head in his palm. Harry walked inside the living room, beginning to undo his scarf and jacket. "Have you been watching TV all day?"
"It reminded me of your eyes. I thought you'd like it."
Currently, Draco was trying to hide his embarrassment as his great uncle ranted to Harry and him about how the Dark Lord was going to return once more and those who have betrayed him would once again feel his wrath. Harry simply nodded and smiled nervously while Draco tried his best to hide his pink cheeks. It was only natural that some rather devoted followers of the Dark Lord would remain, even 15 years after Voldemort's supposed death. Draco bit his tongue in order to not burst out in anger at his drunken family member, but he's heard this speech before. Ever since he was a child, Draco had been hearing the rumbles and rambling of Voldemort sympathizers. He's had them at his dinner table as guests, friends of his parents back when they were part of the clan. And Draco isn't foolish enough to not know that his parents weren't loyal supporters of the cause at one point. But how does one simply say no to the Dark Lord when everything they have is at stake. But now, Draco can see how they hide their Dark Marks in shame. How his mother covers it with the thickest tinctures and potions she can find and how his father rarely wears anything but long sleeved robes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Mr. Malfoy and I met so briefly at the party, I wished to discuss with you more," Ron smiled, nodding his head. "Please, tell me, what do you do."
Draco sighed dramatically, "Fine! Alright! I will admit, he is handsome." He said through gritted teeth, yanking out his ribbon from his hair and letting it flow loosely and freely down his torso.
"Hm? Oh! No, n-no of course not! I was just wondering as to why you have that in the first place."
Draco could do nothing but gawk. "How dare you, sir! Disgusting man! I assure you I will never marry! Marriage is a certain death!" he pushed past Harry to the party, wishing not to let the older man see his trembling lips or shaking hands. Draco wished to go home, he wished to never see Harry Potter again, the man who has confused him and the man he hated and the man who made him feel a fire in his stomach and the man who sounded like deep molasses dripping on Draco's lips. Draco could only reach so far before he was once again pulled back, back onto the balcony and fixed between Harry's arms. Pinned down by two hands on either side of him, Draco could see what could only be described as pain on Harry's face. They remained silent for a few seconds. Harry spoke up first.
"Such lewd thoughts Hermione? Does your mother know you think of such filth?" Draco teased. "I believe that's 20 Hail Mary's for you."
Stormy grey eyes snapped up and met warm hazel. Hermione stared Draco down, worry etched on her face. Draco looked down at the fabric clutched tightly in his fingers, so harshly that his knuckles turned pink and white. He let go of it suddenly, letting Hermione pluck it from his grip. Right, they were in town, picking fabrics. It must have slipped Draco's mind.
"If you expect me to clean this entire house by myself, you're sorely mistaken," Draco scoffed, turning on his heel to stare at Harry straight on. These years have treated Harry well, Draco thought as his eyes scanned the brunette's face. While Draco himself had stayed more or less the same in terms of appearance, it seems that Harry had taken on a new sense of style. A fine beard had begun to sprout on Harry's cheeks and chin and Draco wondered if it was intentional or if the man couldn't find the time to shave his morning shadow. His cheeks, no longer soft with childhood tenderness, have hardened and have become concave shallow pools on his face. His jaw has sharpened to a deadly point, strong and sturdy and making Draco's own stomach warm deep down.
"In no way am I ever going to marry if marrying means being tied down to a man who is anything like you," Draco spat like a kitten hissing.
Harry opened his mouth to respond, but like that, Draco was gone.
"I think I'll take a walk," he muttered, only receiving half hearted 'hms' in response. Harry walked towards the boy, who's pretty grey eyes glanced upwards from his book to look back at him. "Would you care to accompany me, Mr. Malfoy?"
"I have no problems believing it to be tedious work, Mr. Malfoy, but I believe as a male, you have a responsibility to work in the laborious fashion instead of at home," Mr. Potter's eyes traveled up and down Draco, finally his eyes falling upon his delicate frame and long hair. "But perhaps women's work is more suited to your tastes."
"What if they're positively hideous underneath those masks?" Draco teased.
"Draco, are you alright?'
"I present, Ms. Granger and Mr. Malfoy"
"I had gotten lost inside. No worries." Draco's cheeks were tomato red, much like the setting sun that was draping its arms upon Derbyshire. Harry had stumbled out of the estate and into the garden after Draco, slightly panting and disheveled. Hermione's eyebrows raised and a small smile grew on her lips. Draco whined slightly and pulled Hermione closer.
"Oh please daddy~" Draco whined teasingly. He knew how men worked and he knew their weaknesses and men apparently couldn't resist to feel powerful over another, "I can be a good little boy for you. Maybe I could even work here, just let me…-" Draco's soft little hand worked its way down Dimitri's broad chest, timid touches that trailed down to the edge of Dimitri's pants.
"Fuck, well if any more bodies turn up like this, we'll have to put a statement out in the news," Ron cursed, "I'll have to tell the higher-up's about this, you know."
Harry peered his head slightly to the side of Draco, grimaced, and looked back to Draco. "L-listen," Harry stuttered. "I think you should come with me…"
Draco smiled gleefully as he reached out to rub the chin of the cat staring back at him. Apprehensive, she pulled back from his touch, careful eyes staring back at him. Draco began to pull his hand back, not wishing to upset her. "I suppose you're a fickle little thing, hm?" Draco asked softly as she licked her paw, only stopping to "mrr" cautiously as Draco attempted his luck again, this time, stopping to let her sniff his hand.
"What are you doing here?" Harry asked gruffly, "You look…." His lips pursed. It was odd to see Draco Malfoy in such a state. Back in their childhood, he had been something of a spoiled brat, boasting about his designer clothing and his expensive cosmetics. The terror he used to be, Harry mused. He looked like a scared kitten now, a far cry from the boy Harry had once known.
"Thank you," he muttered back softly, not daring to look Harry in the eyes. He hadn't denied the first comment and Harry found it odd he didn't have his usual witty retorts armed.
"Yes Draco, let's go now, we shall get you the cat. Now let's hurry along, we have other things to get." Lucius was already one foot ahead, aiming for the cashier.
"I received a letter in the mail," Hermione glowed. It was the day after the party and Draco was still in a sour mood from his confrontation with a certain arrogant man and from the loss of his mother's ribbon.
"Let's just say his companion is the type of man I detest," Draco grit his teeth. "He's absolutely terrible! A real piece of work, that one!" Draco glanced over to Hermione, who was staring back at him with a dopey look on her face. "What?"
"Potter?"
"Draco-"
"Well…" Draco sat up, "I would like to keep the Malfoy tradition of a Holiday party. With music and dancing and games and-"
"No! They're just friends! Geez Potter, obsessed with me much? Bored with your tragic little life?" Draco sneered, his nose turned up higher and arms crossed defensively. He doesn't know why he's being so rude anyways. He doesn't want to be rude to Harry. He wants to go back to that time, feel the heat of the fireplace on his face and stare into warm hazel eyes. But of course, all was fair in love and war and right now, on the outside, Draco and Harry were supposed to be at war. He doesn't know what it was about Harry that made Draco feel…. Small. Weak… childish and embarrassed. It was an unpleasant feeling and it made Draco want to lash out. It wasn't very "Malfoy-esque" of him, and he's sure his father would disapprove of such a tantrum, but the words spewed out like oil, slippery and wet.
"Coming!" Draco smiled, picking up the crate and moving to the exit. "Don't worry, I won't keep you in here for too long! I promise! You'll live like royalty….what should I even name you? You look like royalty…" Draco knew that his new pet would not be able to understand him, but he suspected that she didn't necessarily mind his chatter as she laid down on the floor of her crate and closed her eyes. "Perhaps I should name you after the Queen? She's rather stylish. Elizabeth? Mmm...that's rather formal. Perhaps that'll be your full name. I could call you Lizzie for short!"
"Wh-what? Why aren't you in bed, young man? And who's this?? He isn't a gryff-"
"Why did you invite me on this stroll, Mr. Potter?" Draco asked with a slight bite to his inner cheek. He glanced over to the man, his face as neutral and stoic as always.
Harry stared at Draco, long and hard. His eyes were soft as he roamed Draco's face, his hair, the clip that dazzled and reflected the sunlight coming through the windows. It was beautiful. Draco was beautiful. The staring made Draco blush, made him look down timidly. Harry took Draco's chin and tilted it up so they were face to face, eyes gazing deeply into each other. Their breaths were hot as they wafted over each other's faces. Practically panting as they leaned in closer to each other, mouths parting and inching towards each other. Harry's eyes moved up and down from Draco's lips to his eyes and back up-
"It was fine, daddy," Draco muttered. "Where's mum?" He asked, searching the area slightly.
Harry turned back to face Draco, pausing to take in the moonlight reflecting off of silvery hair and pale skin. The glow of the fire was bouncing off of Harry's tanner skin, wild black hair and slight glimmers of burnt orange in his eyes that if Draco looked close enough, would turn gold. Harry shrugged and turned back to gaze into the flames. "I don't know. Thought you looked cold."
"So, how was the dinner party, love?" Lucius asked as he took his seat in his usual arm chair.
"Just like you!" Hermione teased. "I just want to see you happy, Draco." Hermione's fingers threaded through Draco's hair, combing through the mess of bedhead. "You two would make a handsome couple, indeed."
"If you wish," Harry kissed the back of Draco's hand.
"What am I doing here, Potter?"
"Draco, I-"
"What a foul mouth for one so young. If I had known any better, I would say I'm standing with a sailor." Harry smirked, causing Draco to shy away.
"Oh, Draco…" he muttered, gazing upon his son's outfit. "You look lovely. I assume your mother did your hair?" Draco nodded, hand reaching back to playing with the ends of it. Lucius nodded and straightened himself out. "Come now, I won't have us be late."
"Oh fuck off," Draco whined. This time, it was playful and a bit bashful, not like the usual venom filled rhetoric that Harry was used to from the blonde. It was the first time that Harry had truly thought Draco was
He remembers Draco was dressed like a bride.
"Draconius Lucien Malfoy, but you can call me Draco." His smile was dazzling, Draco was sure and his hand was stretched out all inviting. He was certain that Harry would fall in love with him just as everyone else would, just like all other boys and men did.
"Yeah."
Harry simply laughed against, a deep billowing chuckle from his chest which made Draco feel younger than he had before, slightly embarrassed but also keeping his resolve. Harry nodded, bringing Draco back into his arms and running his hands through soft blonde hair. "Of course. I will court you properly, if you wish."
"I believe a certain Mr. Potter will be there," Lucius smirked from behind his papers as he heard his wife gasp and begin to rejoice.
"Are you fucking telling me you prefer to let fucking random blokes pay for you like you're cattle and then fuck you in the alleyways?" Harry growled back, getting more and more frustrated.
? Isn't it a bit too…"
Draco rolled his eyes at the obvious attempt at a guilt-trip. "Fine mother, I will do as you wish. I will not, however, have this dress be wild and opulent. I don't wish to stand out as much as I need to."
After that night, Draco began accruing quite the reputation in Knockturn alley. 30 galleons for a handjob, 50 for a blow, 100 for a quick fuck, and 300 for a night with the prettiest boy you would ever see in your life. Draco hadn't been on the streets since then and with every man, Draco's anger began to disappear like a flickering flame in a downpour. All that was left was the curling smoke of a once lit fire and all the sadness a boy could hold. Such a life had given Draco time for contemplation and he found that he had no one to be angry with but himself. He wasn't the victim. He was the bloody problem. The boy had chosen to wear his dark mark with pride, all those years ago. He had chosen to treat others like scum, like rats scattering at his feet. He had chosen to fill his life with luxuries and riches, only to not truly appreciate them in the end. Draco was ashamed to admit that at one point in his life, a sickening and low point of his life, he had once been proud to be considered a future bride for the Dark Lord. It was considered an honor, after all. Now, the reminder of his behavior makes his stomach curl and the tea that warmed him and the bread that sustained him suddenly felt like ash in his mouth.
Draco and Hermione had found themselves seated in front of the dancing, tucked away from sight lest they be asked to dance. Joined together by a few others they had become acquainted with, the small group found themselves enjoying the ornate cups of wine and swapping gossip.
"Let us in, Quid Agis." Harry murmured in a hushed tone, his wand held up steadily and Draco sort of hiding behind his broad back.
"Darling, let's go now, your mother will be fuming if we're not in time for supper," Lucius calls out, already at the door. Mr. Weasley came up behind Ronald, putting two broad hands on his shoulders. "Hello Draco," he said as nicely as possible, obviously pissed off from a rather lively conversation with Draco's father.
"Well, Ronald, since I could actually AFFORD my own room here, I suppose a rumor would spread like that. Unlike you and your pack of mutts." Draco huffed, nose turned up. Ron turned as red as his hair, blabbering on about how he wanted to hex the living daylights out of Draco, but all Draco could notice was that Harry was once again just staring.
"Yeah yeah, I know already. It's fine, really." The boy wiped his eyes, still attempting to be strong. The silence that was left was deafening as Snape went to his desk and pulled out a small box. He turned to face Draco, who was still trying to put on a brave face.

"Oh?" Fenrir went one step closer as Draco took one step back. "And where is this date?" He asked with a sneer.
The blonde blinked rapidly, turning towards the sound of his name. Ah, right. He was in front of Grimmauld Place now. And there was Harry, like a ghost from his memories, staring at him once again with his wide hazel eyes . He looked… confused and slightly concerned, perhaps because he had been calling Draco's name for the last minute and the blonde stood as still as a statue, frozen in place.
"Let's pretend then." Harry shrugged.
Flourish and Blotts booksellers was the only place to find Hogwarts' extensive reading list. Therefore, Lucius made sure to call them the minute they opened to reserve fresh copies. The pair strode into the shop and all eyes fell onto them. The attention on him made Draco's cheeks curl pinker than the blush his mother brushed onto him. Draco reveled in it slightly; he knew he was probably the prettiest thing most people have seen, thanks to his mother and father. Draco wasn't unfamiliar with the compliments people would give him, the pinching of his cheeks or the cooing and petting. He also noticed the look men would give him. Draco liked those the most. He didn't exactly know why, nor what it meant, but he had always noticed that he gained the attention of men and he knew that it made his stomach flutter and he wanted more of it. (As Draco grows older, he'll come to be repulsed by those gazes, making his skin crawl and stomach churn.)
Draco's cheeks turned from pink to red as he whipped his head away. "Don't be ridiculous, 'Mione" he muttered, taking a sip from his glass. Hermione simply rolled her eyes with a cheeky smirk. Draco's eyes once again wandered to the gentlemen. Vermillion eyes met hazel. Quickly both averted their gaze. Had Mr. Potter been staring at him the entire time? Draco felt his entire body growing hot. He turned to Hermione and told her that he needed to get to a less crowded area, just to be able to cool off a little. Draco pushed and shoved through the group of men and women to find a small corner of the hall that was unoccupied. He took a deep breath and sighed, leaning against the wooden column and taking sips of his drink. Draco was so preoccupied with his drink, he didn't notice a figure approaching him.
"And what if I said I did?"
"You indulge in women's work?" Mr. Potter abruptly asked. Draco's head whipped around towards the man, eyes narrowed.
? Cute was never a word he thought he would associate with Draco. It was reserved for sweet things like...like children's dolls and woodland creatures. Harry doesn't even think he's called Ginny cute before (she would probably hit him on the chest and insist that she wasn't cute, but sexy instead.) But now that he thinks back, Draco had always been just a little bit cute. He's always been just slightly coy, even if he was a bit of a tosser. And his 'princess brat' attitude had been annoying, but also rather charming (when he wasn't being a giant git). But this Draco… this stain covered, pink cheeked, nervous smile and tied up hair Draco…
"Ron, please just shut up. I don't wanna talk about this anymore," Harry barked as he rushed towards the Floo station.
"Yes, well...Uncle...uh...Snape will get upset if I'm not in bed, so perhaps I should just..leave." Draco began creeping slowly towards the entrance, his back against the brunette.
Draco's rosy cheeks turned bright red as he pulled his arm away in a perhaps too violent nature. "I'm fine, Uncle! I promise! Nothing to discuss!"
Draco gasped, setting down his tea cup with a loud clunk that rang and echoed throughout the room, "Oh, what ancient thinking you have, Mr. Potter. And here I was to believe money and class was to make a man above petty beliefs, but it seems that it only causes a man to become ignorant and crass!"
"Well, since your hair has been growing longer, I thought it would be quite pretty all tied up," she smiled, sitting Draco down and gathering his long, silken hair up into a bunch. Draco had been growing out his hair since he was a child, having it a little bit past his shoulders. Narcissa began to hum as she ran her fingers through his blonde locks, tying the ribbon into a bow in Draco's hair. "There! Nice and pretty~" she beamed as she dragged Draco to a mirror. The ribbon was in fact pretty, bringing Draco's hair upwards and showing off his features. The ribbon was, in fact, quite delicate and made of expensive materials, far too grand for anything in Draco's daily wardrobe.
"Kreacher," he sing-songed. "Would you be so kind to show me to my room?" Pretty slate eyes were wide like a doe's and long blonde eyelashes blinked with innocence laced intention. Harry watched from behind the smaller man, amazed as Kreacher's straight deadpanned lips began to curl into a smile of too many sharp teeth.
"Yes my little doe," Lucius responded tursely, fixing his cufflinks as they reached their landing point. Diagon Alley was all aflutter with other children and their parents, all picking up the newest books and supplies, cauldrons and robes, and in Draco's case, reserved goods. They passed by Ollivander's, not needing to visit the wand-maker. Draco had inherited his grandfather's wand, 10" Hawthorn wood, unicorn hair. A rather plain wand, Draco whined as he received the magical item, but his father was quick to remind him that unicorns were some of the rarest creatures of all, that their hair was as fine and silver as Draco's. He was quick to remind Draco that being a Malfoy meant being rare and elusive, being above them all. For an 11 year old, Draco didn't exactly understand what his father meant, but knew he didn't want to disappoint.
"I hope this tells you exactly what we are," Harry purred, his thumb rubbing circles into Draco's cheek. With tingling lips, Draco was soon left alone in his bedroom, Harry had left to his own. The boy wordlessly moved to the bed, still in a state of shock. He laid down, staring up at the ceiling before him. Slowly, he moved his fingers to his lips, brushing against them lightly as if he could still feel Harry's lips on his own. Draco smiled sheepishly, got under the covers of the bed, and blew out the candle.
"It would be my honor to show you the rest of the estate."
"I think we must be going now-" Draco stuttered, eyes never leaving Harry.
"Perhaps it would be best if you two stayed the night. After all, it's raining quite harshly." Ron suggested in a lighthearted tone.
"He has to look absolutely fetching for tonight, Lucius, please do not ruin his hair! I assure that he'll catch the eye of many tonight, hopefully Mr. Weasley~" Narcissa hinted, wagging her eyebrow.
Draco felt himself being pinned against the wall, hands sliding and tongue, wet and cold, shoved into his mouth. Little whines and whimpers began to peep out of his mouth. With as much strength as he could muster, Draco pushed the body off of him, deep breaths wrecking his body. Thomas staggered off. "What the fuck Draco!"
Draco is at home for the holidays, but he can't help but think of one certain brunette.
"I'm going now!!" Draco huffed, stomping up the stairs with a pink tint on his cheeks. His father simply chuckled to himself and sighed, picking up the daily newspaper next to him.
Draco scoffed and lightly pushed the man away. "What an egomaniac you are, Mr. Potter. I pity the person you call your future wife." With agility, Draco scooted out from Harry's grasp, slightly airing his face to hide his ever growing blush. "Where is Hermione and Ron?!" Draco whined, not noticing Harry following him from behind.
"Wait, Thomas I don't really-"
Draco had gotten up to his bedroom when he noticed the tapping at his window, a little beak pecking and the scratching of talons. Lizzie followed closely and hopped onto the bed, watching with curious eyes as Draco opened his window.
"Uh, here. I'll show you." Harry scurried over towards the large box tucked away in the corner. He wheeled it out to the front of the living room, feeling a rush run down his spine as he watched Draco's confusion turn into interest. The blonde scooted closer to the edging of his seat, blinking in surprise as Harry fished out another, smaller black rectangle from the drawer. He sat down gingerly next to Draco, making the boy scoot in slightly to watch Harry's actions. "Look, this is the remote," he began, "And you press these buttons to control it." Harry pushed the 'on' button which made the TV come to life and shock Draco entirely. "See, you can change the channels with the buttons as well," he demonstrated for the blonde, who watched with wide doe eyes and keen interest.
"You already told me you think he's handsome."
"Not when it's an excursion day." Harry smirked, grabbing Draco's hand and running, dragging the boy towards the school. "It's empty, I assure you. And if not, we can just get my father's cloak again."
Harry held it to his chest, curled up in his tight fist, and slept.
. Completely and unadulterated. Draco Malfoy was a cute boy. He had always known Draco was attractive; after all, he's heard his fair share of girls at Hogwarts drool and pant over the blonde boy. Harry was always surprised that Draco never chose to date any of his many admirers since he surely had the pick of the bunch. But Harry had never really thought Draco to be cute. Handsome, sure. Reasonably attractive, yeah. But
The silence between Harry and Draco was thick with tension, both of them simply staring at different things, avoiding each other's eyes.
"Draco, I'm...my little flower, I'm sorry." Harry leaned forwards and pulled Draco into his arms, letting him burrow into his chest and neck. Harry held Draco against him, letting little sobs wrack through his body and shake. "Sweet boy," Harry sighed, petting Draco's hair.
"Please do try to look nice, Draco! There will be a multitude of eligible bachelors and I hope you catch the eye of more than one of them!" Narcissa yelled through the closed door, turning on her heel and leaving. When Draco heard the soft clattering of heels disappear, he tiredly threw himself onto his bed, whining into a pillow. It's not like he particularly wanted to go to the party. The only thing that would make it the least bit tolerable was the accompaniment of Hermione. Sure, Draco would not be opposed to the merriment of dancing and drinking libations, but he absolutely knows that his enjoyment will dissipate the minute his mother urges him to dance with random strangers.
Hogsmeade was bustling with Hogwarts students, running around and laughing. It was happy, a pretty Christmas picture of smiling children playing in the snow and looking at the shining trinkets in store windows. Blaise handed the two a cup of steamy warm pumpkin juice and the three of them began to walk around the center of town. McGonagall was keeping a watchful eye as usual, making sure the children didn't get into any precarious trouble, but even her attitude was lightened by the Christmas scene. As Pansy and Blaise chatted, Draco's attentions were everywhere, eyes darting from one store to the next. He was excited for this little shopping excursion. His parents had sent him a monthly allowance and the money was burning in his pockets. Draco spotted his godfather in the corner, unamused as always but just as attentive as his colleagues. Severus had always detested chaperoning school trips such as this, but as the Slytherin headmaster, it was required of him to be present on such occasions. Draco told Blaise and Pansy to go off without him, only to talk to his godfather for a minute, and that he would reunite with them soon. The two understood and with minimal whining, they pranced off to the next attraction that Hogsmeade had to offer.
"What? Do I have something on my face?" Draco snapped at him and Harry simply adjusted his glasses and tilted his head.
Draco didn't say a word as McGonagall had declared that he would be spared, that he would be able to see another day. In some ways, it was worse than death, what McGonagall proposed. Perhaps she hadn't seen it that way, but what life was there for a former Death Eater? What else could be worth living now that everyone he's ever loved is dead?
Draco stood up and began walking to the exit. Before he could reach to push open the door, he paused and turned back to Harry. "This was...ok. I liked it."
"Not at all, now that I've seen your posh little face, it's quite an exciting day, don't ya think?" Harry smiled, head tilting ever so slightly to the side. Draco tsked and rolled his eyes. The way Harry was staring at him, staring THROUGH him, made Draco feel nervous.
Draco scoffed at the remark, had Harry completely forgotten about their shared tears, secret and shushed endearments and their passionate embrace, as quick and sweet as it was? Or perhaps he remembered and regretted it, regretted the entire event and decided to forget about it. Ronald and Hermione noticed Draco's angry picking at his plate of food, sharing concern glances and noticing that Harry was frustratedly puffing his cigar, the smoke curling around then in a hazy trance. The two of them raised their eyebrows in intrigue, shrugging slightly and turning back to their own devices.
"I doubt I'd ever see him again"
"Not at all, I must be getting back to my companions anyways." Mr. Nott turned to Draco and took him by the hand, kissing it softly. "Until we meet again, Angel." He turned on his heel and sauntered off back to his friends.
"Hey, sorry I had to get dre-" Draco couldn't even finish his thought before Thomas was pulling him in by the waist, chapped lips on Draco's neck and jaw and cheeks and lips. They were harsh, fast and teeth clanking against each other. Thomas's harsh breathing and the sound of blood rushing in Draco's ears made him close his eyes as they kissed. It was typical for them to not really talk, just do. Sometimes Thomas would mutter to himself and Draco would nod along, but usually it was silent.
"Are you alright?" Harry asked, tightening his cardigan around him. Draco blinked once more, his head swimming as he tried to make sense of the words before him. The blonde simply nodded his head in wide swoops. Harry seemed unconvinced by Draco's response, furrowing his brows but sighing all the while. "Well...alright, come in then. It's bloody freezing." He stepped aside to let Draco inside, closing the door with a heavy thud behind them. Grimmauld Place was exactly as Draco had imagined it to be. He had only seen photos of the famed Black Ancestral home and he had always thought the place to be dingy and dark. Turns out, Draco had been correct. The entire home, three floors in total, looked as if it had been left in the 1800s. The original wood flooring had been kept, making it creak and groan with every step across it's paneling. The walls were stained, wallpaper peeling in some corners as spiderwebs grew in others. The furniture, although lovely, was antique and dusted settled off it every time Harry would touch it. A rather macabre house, in Draco's opinion. The family portraits on the walls all perked up at the sight of the strange blonde child, peering in closer through their frames and muttering between themselves (isn't that Bellatrix's nephew?) And then it dawned upon Draco one single fact.
"Don't cry, Draco. Please don't cry. You're so young to be so worried, my love," Hermione cooed, cradling the boys face in her palms. "You must tell him, Draco. You must tell him of your true feelings or you'll never know what could be."
As the carriage pulled into the cobblestone, Draco's eyebrows furrowed in confusion. There were two carts in the middle of the entrance instead of one. Hadn't the invitation mentioned only Hermione's presence as well? Draco's mind raced to search for the mystery guest as he was helped out of the carriage and up the stairs to the front door. Could it be-- no, it couldn't. It was probably one of Ronald's siblings or-or-
Why did this boy make him want to fall onto his knees in front of a church and plead his sins to God?
Days in Nice, France were idyllic and quaint and Draco found that he rather enjoyed the countryside life. It was only a few days until Christmas, only a few days until their grand celebration, and Draco found himself wondering about a certain brunette. What was Harry doing by now, Draco wondered. Draco stayed up in his bedroom, reaching out for his wand and charming a piece of parchment on his desk. He had planned to write a letter to Harry. He would like to hand deliver it himself, but Floor Powder was notorious for its rather shoddy results when traveling long distances. Once the paper was properly charmed, Draco began to speak into the tip of his wand. His words were then prettily transcribed onto the parchment.
Draco woke up with unfortunate bags under his eyes from his insomnia and his hair tangled and flying every which way. He slowly sat up in his bed, reveling in the feeling of his bones and joints cracking and stretching under the new pressure. The sunlight was seeping through into the room and little birds birds chirped outside merrily. Draco reached for his sterling silver hairbrush and began working on his bird nest of hair, carefully combing through it. He had decided to dress slightly more casual, form fitting trousers with a clean white button down blouse, a loose black ribbon tied around his neck. It was lovely, Draco mused. It would surely make Mr. Potter tongue-tied. Before leaving his bedroom, Draco's fingers reached out for a small vial of perfume, dripping some of the soft oil into his neck and down his chest.
"Like an absolute snow siren, now come on, I want to see the new brooms on sale!" Pansy said, interlocking her arm with Draco's and practically dragging him away. Laughing behind them was Blaise, who looked on with a fond smile. If Draco were to have to list two people that he could consider friends, he supposed it would have to be Pansy and Blaise. The two had been the first to walk up and actually have a conversation with Draco, other than the obvious "your parents are former Deatheaters?" conversation. The trio skipped off towards Hogsmeade, Pansy chatting their ears off the entire way and Blaise having to make sure she doesn't get too riled up. Draco's eyes would sometimes glance over to spot them looking at each other in a funny way and Draco knows exactly what those looks mean. He has often read about them in the tawdry and scandalous romance novels his mother keeps in her bedside drawer. Draco can't exactly deny that seeing the pictures of scantily-clad and beautiful men from a young age weren't a factor in his sexuality. He's happy for them, in a corny and sweet way.
"No, you idiot! I'm quite the capable cook, if you could believe it!" Draco huffed, crossing his arms angrily. "I'm not as prim and prissy as I come off as, you know. I would hope that you of all people could understand that."
"If Master Draco wishes to change rooms, Kreacher would be happy to-"
"None of his cronies could give him the notes?" Ron asked as he rummaged through a bag of candy, kicking his legs up onto the small coffee table in front of them.
Draco growled and rolled his eyes, "I don't need this, I don't wish to waste a lovely party." He was about to stop off before he was pulled back in by the arm. Draco whipped around to scowl once more.
"Well," Draco rubbed his neck sheepishly, "I may have thrown a particularly annoying tantrum until he became exhausted enough to say yes."
"Yes, mother." Draco said dejectedly. He rested his cheek against his fist, looking down at his plate.
Harry still refused to tell Draco what this was all about, why he was so intent on moving the blonde. One would think he'd be less than pleased to see Draco alive. Afterall, he was his childhood bully and actively tried to conspire against Dumbledore himself. McGonagall had begged the Ministry for mercy.
"You left yourself vulnerable to all the men in this room! By ostracizing yourself, you've given the signal that you're- you're some promiscuous waif!" Mr. Potter's tone rose, more agitated, more frustrated. Draco didn't notice that the two of them were slowly gravitating towards each other, almost chest to chest.
Draco's Great Uncle turned towards a passing waiter in order to refill his emptied cup of wine, which allowed Harry to quickly snag Draco by the arm and yank him away, causing the blonde to giggle as the two of them ran off like school children. The brunette brought them over to a secluded corner of the ballroom. With Draco leaning against the wall and Harry draped over him, it was difficult to distinguish who they were to prying eyes. The warmth of the room from the roaring fireplaces made Draco's body tingle and their breaths came out in pants. Harry's lips curled sweetly into a teasing smile which made Draco's skin prickle into goosebumps. It reminded him of that one winter night, the night when they first snuck into the Gryffindor Common Room and the first time they truly looked into each other's eyes. Harry peered down at the blonde in his arms, his smile wide and eyes squinted happily as he brought a hand up to brush back a loose strand  of hair from Draco's cheek. Draco bit his lip and slightly curled into Harry's touch.
Draco figured it was too early in their relationship to tell him about how he pined for him while walking up and down the corridor dreaming of their perfect room, so he just said “It’s a long story. Anyways, it’s private.”
Draco pointed his wand at the door. “Alohomora!”, he said, and the door opened. Carefully, they snuck inside. Now, they just needed to find the Gillyweed.
Draco was going to ask Harry to be his date for the Yule Ball.
“Yes.” Harry didn’t seem too happy with his date. He was quite an ungrateful bastard, but this did spark some hope in Draco.
After what felt only like seconds later, Draco was cold, wet, and swimming in the Great Lake. Harry was next to him, visibly gasping for air.
From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry leaving the Great Hall and rushed after him, bumping into several disgruntled students. Some Hufflepuff spilled his drink on Angelina Johnson’s dress because of him, and Draco prayed she didn’t see him, she would totally kick his ass.
Midnight approached and Draco got more and more nervous. He reviewed the dance steps he wanted to teach Harry again and again. The opening would be a simple waltz, anybody could learn it instantly; a few basic steps and simple aerials. Harry was small, but surely strong enough to lift him, well, the girl he was taking to the dance. It wouldn’t matter if Harry couldn’t lift him.
“Parkinson? Alright, yeah you two always got along well with each other, didn’t you?  I can only tell you get on with it. I tried asking Cho Chang, but she is already going with Diggory.”
And to recover what we took,
“Goodbye” whispered Harry with a rough voice and kissed Draco on the cheek.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to sound insensitive. So, your father is… like that at home as well?”
Great, now you let Potter get in between you and Slytherin’s success, if father knew about this!
Then they both tried to talk at the same time.
“Yes, for eternity”
Suddenly, Draco stood next to a door. It definitely wasn’t there earlier. He took a few steps back. It was still there
Finally, Harry’s hand brushed over Draco’s junk. Draco felt another wave of pleasure wash over him, even though Harry had barely touched him. Harry now took Draco’s penis that had been erect since they started kissing into his hand and tenderly massaged it. It was all Draco had longed for. He felt every tiny movement of Harry’s hand. The up and down strokes drove him absolutely mad. He could no longer contain himself and let out a loud moan. Then a louder one. Another one, even louder. Until he orgasmed with a scream. The world was spinning around Draco, he felt like he was feeling every emotion all at once. Slowly, the whirlwind lifted from him, and a soothing satisfaction set in.
“Yeah, it was.” Awkward silence. They both had so much to say, but somehow couldn’t.
“I heard that at least five Hufflepuff girls asked Harry Potter out, and he said no to all of them”
Cedric laughed in that ‘I know I’m better than everybody else but I’m gonna pretend I don’t’-way. “Oh, well, I just try my best”
It was the most wonderful afternoon in Draco’s life. He had never before been allowed to just be close to a person without having to either dominate the conversation or being dominated. Draco and Harry were equals, both had their baggage, both feared what the future would bring, both had been longing for a relationship like this for the longest time. But most of all, both had been longing for each other.
When Harry returned, Draco managed to make a disappointed face and he didn’t spare on comments about how the pathetic little Potter should have been eaten, even if he was honestly glad that the boy who lived was still alive and more or less fine.
Draco comforted Harry with his hands “Shh.. It’s okay. It will be fine”, he whispered repeatedly into Harry’s ear.
“Wow, I didn’t know that. The Dursleys wouldn’t care, they hate me anyway.”
Harry looked at him a long time. It was obvious that his mind was racing through a million possible replies. “Fine!” he sighed in a defeated voice. “Fine! But only because I couldn’t stand you ever being away from me again”
“It’s okay, I’m also glad we can finally move on. Just one thing, could you please stop picking on Hermione?”
“So, what is it you wanted to do?” Harry looked at Draco. His green eyes shone brighter than all the candles in the room.
“Okay”, Harry sighed. “I’ll just have to hope it’s actually Gillyweed”
“I can assure you that there is no one here to infringe on our privacy, Draco”. Draco could see Dumbledore lose the tiniest bit of composure, just for a moment, but that moment was answer enough for him. Harry was here. Harry would witness him killing Dumbledore. That couldn’t be. He could never do it with him watching. It was impossible.
While he was aimlessly walking around Hogwarts, trying to pass time until he could finally talk to Harry again, he came past Cedric Diggory surrounded by a bunch of giggling girls.
Harry slowly unbuttoned Draco’s pants. Then he ever so slightly brushed over his briefs with the back of his hand. A wave of desire washed over Draco at the delicate touch. But Harry’s hand didn’t touch him where he wanted it, instead, it travelled to Draco’s back.
“Those were the most heart-filled words I have ever said to anybody.”
Draco and Harry go on a series of dates in the magic room.
Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father, would yell at him if he saw him like this.
“Thank you, Harry, thank you, that was everything.”, he whimpered. He leaned back in the loveseat to catch his breath.
“Fleur didn’t turn up, I couldn’t leave her,”, Harry panted.
“Alright, this was fun, Draco, but I’m tired and I have to do some nasty Potions homework for tomorrow, so goodnight” An irritated Harry stormed off before his fears could become true.
Harry blushed. “Yes, a bit. That step-stuff’s kind of hard, but now I think I get it.”
A few seconds passed. Then Harry opened the door. “If you must.”
Draco and Harry made brief eye contact; Draco mouthed “Good Luck”. Harry smiled and did a quick upwards nod in acknowledgement.
“What does this Gillyweed-stuff look like again?” Harry asked.
“So ahm, do you want to take a walk or something? The Scottish Highlands are absolutely beautiful, I heard.”
Draco choked. Had he heard correctly? No, it couldn’t be.
Draco had forgotten how to breathe while reading the note. He would get to teach Harry how to dance!
Cho was very pretty, and, as far as Draco could judge, quite smart. Also, she was no mudblood, like that darn Granger girl – wait, Draco reminded himself, he had promised to not use that word anymore. He had given Harry his word he would work on leaving this prejudice behind him. Frankly, his dislike of Hermione was just based on jealousy, since she was another pretty girl Harry liked. And she spent more time with him than anybody else, apart from Ron Weasley. Draco didn’t think that, objectively, there was anything more between those two than a deep friendship forged by trauma and defeating the Dark Lord together several times.
The weekend came quicker than expected. Draco didn’t get the chance to talk to Harry before the students left for Hogsmeade which was probably for the best since both boys needed to mentally prepare for the meeting.
“Oh shit sorry, I’ll get it for you, hang on a second.” He dived down with open eyes trying to locate the egg on the ground. The screeching had stopped, no, not just that, now Draco could hear actual eerie voices.
“Please”, he whispered breathlessly between kisses “Please, just a little more”
“Okay, ahm, the choreography is pretty simple. Let’s first look at the basic step of a waltz. It’s like this - one, two, three! One, two, three!” He demonstrated the steps on his own. “Just like, try doing the exact same thing.” He stood next to Harry and took his hand. “One step forwards, then two little steps sideways. Yes, really good. But-” He turned around and put his left hand on Harry’s shoulder. “You need to do this vis-à-vis another person, without stepping on their feet. Put your right hand on my waist. Also, the waltz is a traditionally close dance” With his right hand, he took Harry’s left shoulder and pulled him towards his body. “It was almost scandalous, back in the day, because young men and women were touching” He leaned even closer to his dance partner and whispered in his ear “Nowadays, of course, we would have to go a lot further to provoke outrage”
Harry’s hand slowly travelled down to his butt. “You’re supposed to hold me by the waist, not any lower!” Draco pointed out. Harry blushed under his pale skin.
“Don’t humble yourself, haven’t you already figured out everything about the next task?”
“Thanks. Good night, Draco” Harry rushed out of the room. He hadn’t intended to come over this cold, but he was too confused and exhausted from the late night exercise that the only thing he wanted was to curl up in bed and fall asleep as quickly as possible, preferably without being tormented by thoughts and desires and memories and wishes that would surely never come to pass. Naturally, only the first part was fulfilled a few minutes later.
“Aww, is it hard for you to be so far away from your boyfriend?” Blaise Zabini stretched the last word mockingly.
“Definitely.”
“So we will stay together for eternity now?”, Draco asked.
There was a comfortable calmness in the room, the only noise was the music and their heartbeat.
“And uhm”, Harry looked around in amazement. “The decorations are certainly something…”
Draco chuckled bitterly and sighed, his legs kicking up onto the couch and curling under his legs, much like a content cat. "Oh, I don't know. I guess not. But I suppose that'll probably happen. My parents will arrange something I'm sure." It was common for purebloods to have arranged marriages in order to secure the safety of the bloodline. Draco, being the only son of Lucius and Narcissa, was definitely going to be married off to some rich suitor one day. What happens then, Draco couldn't really tell.
Draco turned to Harry with a scowl on his face.
"Do you mean that?" The blonde blurted out, too embarrassed to look at the boy.
"Draco?"
Harry Potter.
The walk was silent and the two men kept a moderate distance from each other. Harry didn't fail to notice Draco's slight stumbling, his heels must have made it difficult to walk on the grass, still wet from the previous night's rain.
"Well...perhaps we should all begin to settle down for the night." Ron turned to Hermione and smiled, "Allow me to take you to your room tonight?"
Lucius glanced back over, only to do what could be considered a "double take". "By Merlin's Beard.. that's...that's Harry Potter!"
Harry grabbed Draco's wrist, yanking him back into his arms and holding him down. "I think you don't actually loathe me, I think you tease me on purpose, little minx. Perhaps you intend to seduce a wealthy husband and have yourself comfortable for the rest of your life."
"Promiscuous waif?! My God sir, you don't even know me and yet you make me out to be some kind of...of harlot??"
Narcissa gasped in glee and kissed Draco's cheek, staining his creamy skin with a faint pink tint. "Lovely! Come along," she smiled as she dragged Draco to her room, rummaging through her closet while Draco undoes the curlers in his hair and takes out the pins. His snowy locks fell down in waves like the ocean on the shore, loose and beautiful. He watched as his mother search, finally finding the dress she was looking for. "Here we are!" She said as she pulled out a white gown, straight in shape and form-hugging at the top. With lace embroidery woven into the fabric, the dress looked absolutely angelic. "I wore this dress when I first met your father, I was around your age you know. I assure you that it will bring you good luck tonight," she said as she helped Draco into it, tying off the bow in the back. Draco looked at himself in the mirror once it was dawned on him. He looked like something out of a fairytale, a fair maiden. Virginal, pure, untouched and perfect. Draco was absolutely embarrassed by it. He couldn't help but feel like he was dressed as a blushing bride. Perhaps this was his mother's intentions all along, dressing him for the part. Before Draco could protest, Narcissa swooned, cooing over him and smoothing out the dress.
Draco watched on with curious eyes as Harry tucked into his serving. After five minutes with no comment, Draco got up from the couch and stretched his limbs above his head and walked towards the kitchen. Harry listened as Draco poured himself a bowl as well, little feet pattering upon the floor and finally settling down in the seat across from him. Harry glanced up at him, watching from his periphery as Draco took a small sip of the soup, wrinkling his pert nose, and then putting the spoon back down with a groan. "This tastes awful! Why didn't you say anything?" He whined, pouring the soup back into the pot with a huff.
"Harry. It's ok. I understand, the teasing, flirting. It's ok." Draco's words felt heavy against Harry's chest. "How about we call it a truce? I don't think my heart can take anymore of this, I'll go crazy. I don't know what we are, Harry. I don't know if you even like me, in fact, I think you absolutely hate me."
Draco's entire body turned hot. "What??" He hissed, his fists clenching.
Draco changed into a baby pink sundress, one that flowed easily in the wind and accentuated his light curves. His hair was kept loose, except for the ribbon that was woven in and tied off into a bow. Draco packed a few novels he would like to read, as well as a hat incase the sun was too abrasive. The boy heard the carriage stroll up to his entrance and he was soon skittering down the stairs, heels clacking against the wood.
"Oh nothing, father. I-I was just telling mother how I was going to wear the locket you gave me for my birthday to the party. And the dress I was given as well! It was going to be a surprise. You know how I do love to wear the things you get me~" Draco then turned to Narcissa expectantly, as if to motion for her to continue their little ruse.
Draco deemed it. He apparated the suitcase to Grimmauld Place, not wanting to be bothered to drag it all the way there.
Harry's eyes darted over to his drawer. He rolled himself over, sheets wrapping around his naked torso and shifting down his body. With an outstretched arm, he clumsily opened his side table drawer, trying his best to remain quiet. His fingers scoured the inside until he felt a soft and silken material. With a satisfied feeling in his stomach, Harry pulled out the item. Draco's pretty white ribbon, lacey and dainty and preserved so delicately. Harry rubbed his fingers against the material, then bringing it up to his nose and inhaling the lingering scent of Draco's hair. Harry had kept it, not being able to bring himself to part with the ribbon. It was a memento of the first night they met. It was ridiculous, the thought of even keeping such a thing. Borderline obsessive.
Ron nodded, "Right. That makes sense. I mean, Ginny has been gone a while now, so it must be difficult." He didn't notice as Harry tensed up in his spot at the Floo, suddenly looking as if death itself had gone through him. "Well it's a good thing she's coming home in a few days right?" Ron continued, taking out his wand. "I'll see you tomorrow man," he said as he swished his wand and disappeared in an instant, no doubt eager to scurry home to Hermione.
Sometimes, Draco wished he had died in that Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts. Perhaps then, he wouldn't be here, laying on a stained mattress, next to a man who he's forgotten the name of. Death sounded just as pleasant as dreaming endlessly, Draco mused, as he attempted to drown out the sound of heavy snoring next to him. Draco shifted onto his side, facing away from, what was his name for God's sake? David? Jonah? It doesn't matter really, they all meshed together at some point. Draco's eyes focused on the worn, leather wallet on the nightstand next to him. It would be easy to just take the wallet and pocket the money he was owed. Then, quickly and quietly gather his belongings off the floor and skulk off into the night. But he wouldn't, not after last time he was caught attempting to skip out with a customer's wallet (Draco still had a scar on the back of his head from how hard he was pushed down onto the floor, an audible crack that made his stomach jolt and bubble, little blue and purple circles beginning to cloud his vision as he felt his pants being tugged off.) And yet, laying here next to whatshisname was a little bit of a death itself, as Draco was forced to be reminded over and over and over of what he is and what he's done. The shifting of a body, the moistness of the mattress, the crinkle of a condom wrapper, thrown somewhere without regard. Draco sometimes wished he died in that Astronomy Tower. It would have meant more than what he is now.
"Perfect! I shall plan a party at once! I'll invite the entire town, perhaps even the sentinels!" Ron smiled, "I can't wait to see you in a lovely dress, Ms. Granger."
Draco's delicate features contorted into one like a scorn feline, eyes widening and metaphorical ears pushed down against his head. He yanked his hands back and huffed, "Fuck you, Dimitri!"

"An outing with whom?"
Draco's face burned at the words he read. Harry was teasing him, that was for sure. If anyone else were to read this letter, it would sound as if Harry was writing to his fiancé. He was keeping up their little game of House just to get a kick out of the blonde. He could practically see Harry's smug little face as he read the letter, hands creasing the paper at each side. But if Draco read the letter right, and he was sure he did since he read it over ten more times, this meant that Harry was going to come after all. Draco imagined what Harry would be like at a party like this. Probably awkward and reserved in a brooding and dashingly handsome sort of way. No doubt all the ladies and gentlemen of the room will want to try their chances at seducing him. But Draco's heart fluttered at the reminder that Harry was his companion for the evening, no one else's. He tucked the letter away in his dresser drawer and with a flick of the wand, he turned out the lights of his room. Sleeping that night would be a troubling thing for all he could think of was the party and what Harry would look like and how he should dress and what to say and what to do and how he would introduce Harry to others. He tossed and turned in his bed, unable to succumb to sleep. He most likely won't be able to until Harry arrives anyway.
Draco peered over to Harry and then back at the TV, "I got hungry and I wasn't about to wait for you to get home. You don't have to look so suspicious. It's not poisoned or anything." He spat back.
"Draco, I know you snuck out from the dorms the other night… if you'd like to talk you can always come to my chambers-"
"Have you heard about the men who have purchased the estates down in Derbyshire?" Hermione asked as she ran her hands down the piles of fruits that were for sale, picking some up and bringing them to her nose to smell and then placing down again.
"I shall begin preparations at once, I expect you two to help me with the themes?" Ron asked.
As the evening went on and the sky went from robin egg blue to a mix of burnt orange and raspberry pinks, Hermione and Ron found themselves invested in a particularly intense game of Bridge. Harry watched on from his seat, burning through another cigar. His eyes sometimes fluttered between the card game and the young boy seated under a grand Willow tree, completely enthralled in a novel he had brought with him (except for the times Draco glanced back at Harry when the older man wasn't looking). After about an hour of content quiet, Harry began to take a stand, stretching his legs and arms and neck.
"You'd be advised," Snape began in his usual rolling drawl, "To avoid anyone of the Lestrange family, Potter."
"I'm 18, I'm not so young."
At 18 years old, Draco was neither engaged, nor married. Much to his mother's disdain, Draco had never found himself drawn to romantic affairs like the girls in his classes, or the women his mother would bring home for tea and gossip. Narcissa often joked that Draco's dispassionate for romance was the bane of her existence. Her pretty child, as beautiful as fresh fallen snow on vibrant green English countryside, would rather bury his head in books and poetry than socialize and would rather dirty his hands and clothes with soil from gardening, than wear crisp white linens and lace. Narcissa often blamed her husband for Draco's rather independent and headstrong behavior. He was not docile and giddy like the other girls his age had been, but instead he was sharp tongued, rather crass at times and otherwise blunt. Although Draco's sarcastic comments often brought a smile and chuckle to his father's face, his mother abhorred this personality characteristic of her son. Draco, at times, could be rather charming and witty. In fact, he felt rather comfortable when confronted with a battle of wits. But, his mother feared that his slightly boorish behavior would scare away potential partners who would much rather prefer a bubbly airhead than a brooding scholar. Draco never really minded this fact and often told his mother he wouldn't mind never getting married (at this comment, Narcissa gasped and held her heart, telling Draco to not say such things).
"Good morning, Mother," he yawned as he sat down at the dining table, breakfast already being brought in front of him by one of their chefs. A plate of poached eggs, two slices of toast, and a cup of tea. Narcissa had always insisted Draco eat slimming and simple meals (The boy had a tendency to gain weight and it tended to go straight to his hips. While Narcissa called them "child-bearing hips", Draco called them "nuisances".)
In his 25 years of life, Harry's never felt so unhinged, so shaken up and rambunctious. He worries if he falls asleep, he'll dream of a certain silver-haired vixen. And that would be awful, would it not? Harry isn't entirely sure what transpired that night. The four or five or six or seven flutes of champagne he had consumed made sure he was left with a hazy memory of the party's events. He does remember certain snippets though; remembers Draco talking to Mr. Nott, the disgusting cad. Harry was unsure why this interaction had fueled a fire in him so hot that it forced his legs to transverse the dance floor, tap on Mr. Notts shoulder, and effectively break the two up. He knew what the man wanted, he knew what he was thinking. Seizing up Draco from across the floor, Theodore Nott wanted nothing but a subservient wife to pump into and pop out kids. A disgusting man, absolutely irreprehensible.
"Mm.. quite the uh...seamstress," Draco mused nervously, curling white puffs of breath surrounding them as he spoke. This was perhaps the most he had talked to Harry in the last couple of years and definitely the closest he's been in proximity to him. It was awkward and Draco wasn't sure what to do or say as he watched Harry fiddle with the cloak. "Um.. thanks for... back there."
"Really?" Draco asked, not entirely looking at Harry. He would rather fuss with his cuticles, perhaps too embarrassed to look at the brunette in the eyes.
"Well, well. Draco Malfoy. You look quite beautiful tonight, my dear."
"Come on now, no cold feet," Harry tutted as he grabbed Draco by the arm. Suddenly, in a flash of light, the two apparatted away.
Draco looked up from his punch and there he was. Thomas Nott. 17 years old, green eyes, dark hair, broad chest. Draco smiled and nodded.
"..."
The cat's elegant neck scooped down to sniff lightly, and finally, she nudged her head against Draco's hand, eyes closing in content as Draco excitedly began to scratch.
Harry quickly shot up from his seat, nearly knocking over plates and silverware to the ground as he raced towards Draco. The two stood side by side as they walked down the winding hallways. Harry glanced over at Draco, and yet the boy would still not meet his gaze. Harry's body began to grow tight and anxious, his palms sweating and his collar tight.
"He's a phony, Draco! He's too perfect. I assure you, he's no match against Mr. Potter."
The question had Draco stop dead in his tracks. His hand, outstretched to push open the entrance, began to slowly retract and curl at his side. When he turned back to Harry, he saw how Harry wasn't facing him but gazing into the fire, deep in thought. Draco wondered if he did this often.
As the two chattered on about the hair pin, Draco turned towards his right and saw Potter and his ragtag duo. They were entering the pub, no doubt for a bubbly and creamy butterbeer. Harry noticed Draco across the road and smiled slightly, a little wink aimed towards the blond. Draco blushed and the bright pink burned against his milky skin in a way that caught the attention of his two companions.
"So, what did you two talk about once we all retired to bed?" Hermione asked with a mischievous smile on her lips, picking at the fruit placed in front of her.
Draco's eyes refocused and noticed his friend staring at him, cheeky smirk plastered on her face.
"Daddy..."
Harry Potter had never been a religious man. Although most of his childhood had consisted of his mother and father dragging him to Sunday masses and whispering fake confessions to a priest, Harry had never considered himself pious or holy. He had mostly slept through masses, being nudged awake by his mother with a tsk. He almost never prayed, feeling that it was silly and borderline ridiculous to speak to an entity he didn't believe in. Harry scoffed at the preaching zealots on the streets, regarding them as fools who devoted their lives to a nothing god. A man of practicality and material, Harry couldn't find the merit in believing something that he couldn't prove or see with his own two eyes. Consider him a robust man of industry, but if Harry couldn't have it tangibly, he didn't want it.
A nice moment between Harry and Draco
"Mother, please," he whined, sitting down on his bed as his mother sifted through his closet and pulled out various garments for Draco to try on. "I was a child, after all."
"You're right," Harry shrugged, taking Draco's hand in his as they walked down the stairs, "Children can wait, but maybe we could run away together, get married now. There are some places that do that you know? We could elope."
"I could say you have damn right bad taste in men."
"And what, may I ask, is that for?"
"Mother! Father! I'm home," Draco called as he entered through the door, untying his coat and setting down his basket. He heard the bustling of maids and cooks in the back kitchen and his mother's heels clicking down on mahogany floors.
"When little Draco was born, the Dark Lord was elated. He had been blessed by his Excellency upon his birth. Rumor had it that he was to be the chosen one, the bride for our master."
"I DON'T!"
Hello everyone! Please comment with suggestions or if you simply enjoyed this chapter. It really encourages me to continue writing! Thank you!
"Draco...I'm...I'm…"
Draco turned his head when he heard his name and his entire body froze up as he saw the figure approach him. "O-oh. Mr. Greyback, how are you?" Draco asked with a polite smile, his hand moving to rub as his own arm, crossing them in front of his chest. Fenrir Greyback was an associate of the once powerful Dark Lord, as well as an old acquaintance of Draco's father. He had been invited to many Malfoy family dinners and Draco distinctly remembered the werewolf's beaty yellow eyes following his every movement. The way Greyback had watched Draco as if he were prey on the run had always caused goosebumps to raise on his skin. There were rumors of Greyback's less than polite behavior with his companions and he was often the center of crude stories. But from the first time Draco had met the werewolf, only 8 years old and holding Lucius's hand, Draco had known that the creature had certain insidious and lewd intentions when it came to him.
"Now, now, Hermione, we shouldn't interfere with their lives." Ron tutted, pouring amber tea into porcelain teacups. He set one cup down on the saucer, handing it to Hermione.
"What are you doing here, Potter?" Draco muttered, eyes averting towards the ground and Harry had never realized how small the blonde was before.
"Welcome home darling," she smiled, taking the basket from the table and handing it off to one of the servants. "Look at what I found up in the attic!" She pulled from behind her a white Chantilly lace ribbon. Draco's eyebrows raised as he cocked his hips.
Harry's shirt was completely unbuttoned, showing off his broad and tanned chest, what looked like it was sculpted by the hands of the great artists themselves. Draco's eyes never left Harry's chest, untamed black chest hair covered the expanse of skin, leading down further and further and further, down to the edge of his pants-
Draco bought four little chocolate frogs and two honeycomb lollies, one that he currently had in his mouth that was making his lips sweet and sticky. His head turned to talk to his friends, he didn't notice that he was about to walk straight into a person as he walked through the door. Draco bounced back with a little "oof" and groaned, looking up to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
"Oh? And what did it say?" He muttered in disinterest as he slowly chewed on his jam and toast, replaying the scene over and over in his head.
Draco stomped his way back to his room, flinging his door open and shutting it closed with a loud clamber that alarmed Lizzie, who was sleeping soundly on his bed. Draco practically threw himself onto it as well, whining into his silk pillows. Who do they think they are?! How could they be so rude to someone they don't even know?? Draco's ears burned from how red his blush was, flustered and warm. He decided from there on that he hated Ronald Weasley, he hated Gryffindors and he hated the boy who made him feel silly, childish and bratty. He hated Harry Potter!
"Our little Draco refuses to become slave to love, it seems," Hermione attempted to speak over the sound of the entire hall and smiled, ignoring Draco's whining.
"I assure you mother, my financials will not be an issue. I shall go to London and open my own shoppe. Perhaps a flower store or maybe a seamstress? Or a bakery! Either way, I'll be fine."
"Come, my little pearl, we must get back to the Manor before our disappearance rouses suspicion."
"Hm? Oh..yes that sounds great. Perhaps...Mione and I should go home for a bit, just so we can gather our belongings and change into picnic ready attire."
"Then I would say that you're in love with Mr. Potter and wish to carry his children, but it's pointless isn't it? You'd just deny it." Hermione said matter-of-factly, hugging an embroidered pillow to her chest.
"Oh? No brazen insults this time?"
The wind blew fiercely along the grassy fields of Derbyshire, making the trees sway and whip into a frenzy. Draco's dress wrapped around his legs and waist as he was helped out of the carriage, trailing behind him was Hermione in her pretty cream colored dress. Ron and Harry were already there, sitting idly at the gazebo set up for their outting, smoking cigars and drinking scotch. At the notice of Draco and Hermione, both men stood and bowed, Draco's eyes never left the man who hadn't talked to him the entire day.
Once Draco had gotten a good look at Harry, he couldn't help but feel his legs turn to jelly and his heart thump like a rabbit. Harry was wearing a tuxedo that was perfectly tailored to his body. The shirt he wore perfectly highlighted the toned and firm crevices of his chest as well as the elegant slope down to his waist. His slacks were practically painted onto him with how perfect they looked on strong and long legs. Harry's caramel tan skin glowed warm in the candlelight that was scattered around the manor and the moonlight bounced off ebony black curls. His lightning shaped scar stood out as if a proud medal and Draco could imagine he purposefully put it on display, as if to give a warning to all the former Death Eaters. Draco felt his own cheeks heat up at the sight and it definitely wasn't from the champagne he had been drinking. "I'm not some trollop that fools around with men," Draco muttered, his cheeks turning even more pink than the rouge he was wearing.
None of them had caused Draco to melt the way Harry had.
The comment made the brunette's eyebrow twinge upwards, his lips turndown in displeasure.
"And how will we ever do that, darling dearest?" Ron smirked, bringing the sandwich to his mouth and taking a large bite, getting cream cheese on the corners of his lips. Hermione rolled her eyes with a small curling smile at the corners of her mouth.
Harry hadn't really thought this out. He had asked Draco to come in as his housekeeper, but in all honesty, did he really expect the blonde to be on his hands and knees, scrubbing the floor? (Although, the sight might not be that terrible). "Um...just...get comfortable, I suppose. There is a television if you'd like to watch something. And Kreacher will be here if you need anything."
"Come on Draco! We must go!" Lucius called ahead, already moving out of the store.
Draco peered over at Harry shyly, "Yeah?"
Hermione shifted slightly in her seat. "W-well, this food is delicious. Did you know that Draco is an excellent cook? He's a gifted baker as well. In fact, he was thinking about going to see a culinary tutor in France!"
"And Harry would never admit that he craves affection and attention. His rough exterior drives away any potential suitor that dares to attempt to woo him." Ron sat back down on the couch across from Hermione, picking up a small finger sandwich.
Inspiration for Draco's room
"So…" Draco began, unsure where to even start with conversation. "Do you live here alone?"
"So we have ourselves a regular Jack the Ripper, eh?" Ron sighed, "This is the third one this month! They're all the same too- blonde, small, prostitutes…"
"Well, at least you admitted it!" Harry teased back, absolutely enjoying the way Draco's scrunched up in unamusement. The blond recoiled slightly, attempting to keep himself calm. His parents did always say he had a little bit of a temper when it came to arguing, but Draco didn't want to argue right now. It didn't feel like all of those other times in the hallways or in class, it wasn't someone making a rude comment about Draco's lineage or his intelligence, not insinuating anything. Harry wasn't exactly insulting him. This confused Draco most of all.
"Do you like it?" Draco blushed, rocking on his toes and heels as he watched the brunette wander.
Draco gripped the paper in his fingers tighter as he walked through the stone arches that separated Knockturn Alley from Diagon Alley. The idea of actually going to Grimmauld Place filled him with dread and Draco had spent over an hour trying to decide what to bring with him to his new home. Draco contemplated in front of the mirror that morning: what does one wear to see his once enemy turned housemate employer? He doesn't remember his mother ever teaching him about this type of situation and therefore, Draco was left grasping for straws trying to figure it out. But, he knew that Narcissa Malfoy, god rest her soul, would be aghast to see her son wearing anything but the best clothing to see one's companions, let alone the boy he had once swore to destroy. Therefore, Draco had scavenged through his wardrobe, deep inside the back, to find the clothing he had been able to salvage from his estate before he was rather violently evicted. As it turns out, association with Death Eaters
"Oh fine, thank you Hermione. It's been a lovely day out I think, until I ran into your little mangy mutt duo." Draco huffed, crossing his arms. He glanced over at Potter who simply smiled wider. "You better keep them on a leash." He added and Hermione laughed and nodded.
But if it wasn't these things that surprised Draco first, then the bed had definitely taken the cake. The bed was something straight out of a child's fairytale. White painted wood (covering the chips and dents) made way to a light blue and white duvet that was decorated with flowers and butterflies and other woodland creatures. The headboard was carved with swirling patterns and the entire ghastly thing was covered by a sheer sheet of dainty white mesh: a canopy bed.
Draco gulped slightly. "I don't work as of now, but I do enjoy reading and poetry. I garden sometimes and embroider small pieces. My parents would prefer I not work, they would rather I learn trades of the home."
Draco nodded, bouncing on his heels. "Right. You're an Auror now, aren't you? I saw it in the papers." He looked anywhere but the man in front of him.
It was bland. Lacked salt. And the vegetables were borderline mush. And yet, Harry poured himself an entire bowl and brought it to the dining room table.
"Should I be expecting a future son-in-law?" Lucius asked with a teasing smirk, chuckling at the way Draco fumed and spat out a breathless 'No!'
"Perhaps they've runaway in a passionate affair," Draco joked, "Perhaps they've already boarded a ship to Paris this very second."
Draco sniffled and nodded, hot tears rushing down his cheeks to his neck.
Draco hid his face into the pillows, kicking his legs like a petulant child. Hermione dug him out, "I'm right, aren't I?"
"And why would you even do that?! We aren't pals!" Draco said exasperatedly, nearly throwing his hands in the air. "In fact, if you do recall, you almost FUCKING KILLED ME IN THE DORMITORY BATHROOMS!"
"Hush you! I would rather die than allow that man to touch me in any capacity," Draco declared, puffing out his chest and rolling his eyes. "I swear, you're just as bad as my mother. If it were up to you two, I'd have been married off at the tender age of 16!"
Draco avoided Derbyshire like the plague for the past week. Much to his mother's chagrin, the snow haired boy couldn't bear the embarrassment that would be coming face to face with a certain dark-haired individual. It was as if Harry was possessed, speaking in tongues and chanting velvet temptations into Draco's ear, grip hot and heavy on fragile wrists. Fire lit up every nerve and vein through Draco's body and goosebumps erupted through porcelain skin. Draco remembers those wild eyes, how intensely they burned into his skin and froze Draco against that marble veranda banister. Draco could remember his lips, his wild hair and the veins bulging in his neck and the way his eyes roamed Draco's body as if he were prey. The silver-haired boy could feel electricity roaming up and down his body from head to toes and he remembers how badly he wished to reach out and grab the man by his lapels and-
It was common knowledge amongst wizards that all Death Eaters were to be killed with no hesitation. This was the only justice for the damage and calamity they've caused. How Draco survived, he still doesn't know. He was apparently too young, in Minerva McGonagall's eyes, to die. She had been kind to him, reminding Draco of little Ms. Shrew. She had always been immensely kind with him and Draco had felt the whips of guilt and shame as he thought back to everything he's done, how he's lived his life and how he's acted. Draco wanted to cry out, "Why?? Why am I suddenly too young?? Why am I too young to die with my parents? The only people in my life I had left in the world! I wasn't too young when I was given the dark mark at age ten, I wasn't too young when Fenrir Greyback had whispered crude words into my ear, and stroked a hand down my back at age thirteen. I wasn't too young when rumors of my binding to the Dark Lord had fluttered around the Death Eater circles, supposedly claiming that I would be betrothed to the overlord himself at only fifteen, a pretty thing for the king of darkness. Why am I suddenly too young to be given the only thing I've ever wanted in my life?? My parents!"
It was a small reward though, Harry thought, as he watched Draco flutter back and forth between conversations. He's a gifted little host, the way he dazzles and lights up whenever he talks to someone new. It was all very endearing to Harry, who chose instead to stick to the walls until his date had returned. No bother, he mused, sipping from his flute of champagne. Perhaps one day, Draco will play host at one of their own dinner parties.
"And what, may I ask, is so undesirable about Mr. Nott? You seem to know him well."
Their conversation came to a resounding halt when the music abruptly stopped and all that was left was the scattering of feet to make a small hall in between. Draco and Hermione stood up quickly, smoothing out their clothing and Draco on his tiptoes attempting to see what the commotion was about. A red-faced, pudgey and stumpy man came forth from the main entrance and cleared his throat. In a booming voice, he announced. "Please welcome our esteemed guests, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Potter!"
"Way too expensive," Blaise murmurs, nodding his head to the price tag next to it. The amount of zeros made their heads spin a little. "It's worth enough to buy a small island, I imagine."
"I find myself rather good at keeping up, Potter."
"No imposition at all, Draco. It would be an honor."
"Draco! Come on!" Pansy, always pulling Draco away.
Draco's cheeks turned red and hot as he noticed Harry's sudden cold behavior towards him. The two seemed dejected and this caused Ron and Hermione to gulp and fidget in their seats. Hermione turned to Draco and attempted to pull her best smile. "Draco, come with me for a second. Excuse us boys, we are going to go powder our noses," she dragged Draco away with her to the bathroom, pushing him inside.
"O-oh, Theodore. What brings you to town?" Draco asked, twirling his locks of hair nervously, suddenly more school girl than a grown man. Theodore took off his army hat, holding it to his chest.
"Then perhaps you should marry him if you think him so!"
Before he could close the door entirely, Harry shoved out a hand and pushed it open. With a renewed energy and intensity, Harry pulled Draco closer and suddenly, their lips met. Draco's eyes shut closed, the air knocked from his lungs as Harry took his face into his hands, deepening the kiss and pulling Draco closer into his arms. Draco's lips were plush against Harry's and Draco could feel heat fall from his chest to his stomach, erupting into fluttering waves. Like a hummingbird, Draco's heart thrummed in his chest.
"The school is n-never empty, you idiot! There is always some kind of teacher or prefect or-"
Draco sat up off the bed, wrinkled bed sheets twisted around his torso and slipping off his skinny hips. He had been losing weight rapidly, something that the John's loved and yet scared Draco to no end when he could feel the chill of Knockturn Alley in his bones. He used to be soft and pink all around, Draco mused as he stared in the dingy mirror. Now all he saw was sunken in cheeks and sickly pale skin. And yet, Draco knew he was still pretty. He had always been pretty. The pretty son of Lucius and Narcissa, dressed in only the finest silks, doused in sweet oils and perfumes, taught French and Italian and Spanish and Russian from the age of three. Draco was even pretty enough to gain the attention of certain Death Eaters, ones that stole sly smirks towards him or roaming eyes as Draco cowarded behind Lucius' leg. It was tradition, after all, for any Death Eater to join in on meetings after they turn ten, brought in by their parents to initiate them into the order. That, as well as the dark mark inked into their skin, into their soul, into every fiber of their being. Sometimes, Draco wished to cut off his arm.
"And where would I ever wear something like this?" He asked, looking at himself in the mirror and adjusting his own hair.
"Hello?? No students are allowed out after curfew!" It was Argus Filtch, the school security guard. He was known for prowling the school grounds at night, looking for any kids, like Draco, who had disobeyed curfew. Draco cursed under his breath and began to sneak out. He had half the mind to just let himself get caught and he saw the light of Filth's lantern coming closer and closer. About a second before Draco would've been found, he was suddenly pulled to the corner corridor. Draco's eyes shut as he felt himself be pressed against a warm body, solid and broad and smelt of tea and cedar pine. Hot breath fanned against Draco's face and neck, broad hands holding tightly onto his waist. It felt as if there was a large cloth or cloak surrounding him, heavy and thick and kept the cold away. Draco kept his eyes shut, trying to ignore the cold shiver of nerves that ran down his back as he heard Filth's steps pass right by them. How did he not see them? Draco wondered. After all, they were pretty out in the open.
"A-actually, I have a date for tonight. Also, my friends from school will arrive shortly," Draco said as he backed up from the man. His polite smile struggled to stay on his lips as he lied through his teeth.
"Got an entourage, huh princess?" Harry asked, making Draco turn bloody red. He could hear Ron and Hermione snickering behind Harry and the sound of their laughter made Draco's skin crawl.
"I suppose so, but if patience is a virtue, perhaps I'm not as angelic as I seem." Draco's lips ghosted over the mystery man's only to be pulled away at the sound of a booming voice.
"I'm only 25 years old and yet you insist I am already elderly? Then perhaps it would be correct of me to call you an impertinent little child," Harry snapped back, lips curling with satisfaction at the sight of Draco biting his bottom lip. The younger huffed and twirled on his heel, stomping away. "And may I ask, is your fashion popular with boys? Or in fact, ladies, perhaps?" Harry added, his words digging and digging and digging into Draco's skin until he finally-
"Well I'm quite fine now, aren't I?" He smirked and showed off yellowing mangled teeth, taking a sip of his whiskey. Draco had to stop himself from gagging at the sight of such disgusting fangs. "And are you alone tonight? Perhaps you could be my date for the time being," Fenrir purred, a dirty clawed finger coming up to brush a loose strand of hair from Draco's face. The boy recoiled at the sensation.
"Your luggage appeared here," Harry muttered, his hands tightly wound behind his back as Draco looked around the home. "I had it placed in your room." He added, watching with uneasy interest as the blonde dragged his fingers across the mantle of the fireplace, cringing at the dust that was collected on his fingers.
"I'm not sure," Draco lied, shoving his toast into his mouth to avoid any more questions. "I have many admirers, don't you know." He added with a huff, his nose turned in true pompous Malfoy manor.
"Yes, I spent two years living in Nice, I own a winery and vineyard down there." The answer was curt and concise, much like the man who gave it. The conversation ended as soon as it began and everyone began to feel uncomfortable with the silence.
"He pushes me away!" Draco growls, hands gripping the vanity in a white-knuckled clutch. "He's rude and arrogant and positively barbaric."
"Wouldn't that ruin the fun? The curiosity is delicious, isn't it?"
"We should have a turn about the room, shouldn't we? Make sure everyone sees us in all our glory?" Harry asked as he took up Draco's waist once more. Draco blushed deeply and the warmth of Harry's hand on his hip travelled up his spine like waves of electricity.
Draco bit his bottom lip and a gentle 'wait' made Harry stop in his tracks and whip around. The boy hadn't moved an inch from his place in the road, looking down at his scuffed up shoes and red rubbed knees. Harry gulped as he watched Draco brush the hair from his eyes and sigh. "I can't...use the Floo. I'm not allowed."
"Y-yeah you poof!" Harry scoffed. "Of course I do!" He said with renewed vigor, attempting to stay steady for the both of them. "I have since I first saw your bratty ass in the bookstore," he laughed. He had to admit it felt nice to have his pretty Draco dangling on him like this, finally able to hold him how he wanted, touch him as he pleased. Harry's hands wrapped tighter around Draco's waist.
The trial was held in the Ministry, Draco and his mother locked in cages like animals. Narcissa had been sobbing, but her tears were drowned out in Draco's ears by the incessant chattering of the Ministry that surrounded them on all sides. They had all been there, when Narcissa was sentenced to death. Draco remembered it so vividly, he could repeat his mother's final words from rote memory. And he was there too… Harry Potter. He had been there, hidden in the crowd with his rowdy band of misfits. He remembers Ron Weasley's smile: cruel and toothy. He remembers Hermione Granger cowering behind the Ginger cad, not bearing to watch. In that moment, Draco felt most apologitory towards her.
"Mother I won't, will not, wear a dress!" Draco growled, eliciting a little yelp as Narcissa yanked his long hair with the brush, his scalp stinging from the harsh treatment.
Rodolphus grit his teeth together, face contorting into something inhumane. "Why you little-"
The owl took off soon after and Draco plopped down onto his bed excitedly, pulling Lizzie up to his lap and petting her softly as he wiggled open the wax seal that kept the envelope shut. Lizzie made herself comfortable on Draco's lap, stretching out and yawning before finally laying down to sleep.
"Well I'm not old, fat, or balding, but I have a bit of money saved from my parents." Harry sat back down next to Draco. He held out his palm, showing a small object wrapped in brown paper and string. It was crudely done, but Draco couldn't help but be fascinated.
Draco turned once more towards the man and finally Harry cleared his throat and spoke, "I wonder what's taking those two so long in the kitchen?"
they had described it.
"And were you one of his followers, Professor?" Harry asked bitterly, adjusting his slipping glasses. Snape remained silent next to him, a stoic statue in all black robes.
Draco could see himself being comfortable in Hogwarts. It wasn't Beauxbaton, but it was charming and beautiful in it's own old and antique way. The paintings on the walls all tittered upon seeing him and the ghosts that lurked in the halls all bowed their heads, old italian men who wished to kiss his hands and call him "Bella". It was definitely a boost to his ego, knowing that he was gracing the Halls of Hogwarts with his beauty. His mood was high, his head swollen with compliments. That was until he heard…
"I assure you old man, at my age my clothes are popular amongst the youth. The height of fashion back in London." Draco smirked, taunting the man in front of him. Draco was at least 7 years Harry's junior and the gap had made it all the more fun to tease.
"Hello snowpetal," he said back, words curling off his tongue in a thick Slavic accent. He was a man of his time, showing Draco the affection and care he would a young lady, and that included a multitude of nicknames and pet names. It amused Draco, and he wasn't opposed to being treated like a fragile porcelain doll once in a while, especially when his other clients opted to toss him around like a ragdoll. No, Dimitri was a kind man and a kind lover. Draco was more than grateful for it.
"Grimmauld Place is huge! You'd have your own privacy!"
"So what is it that is being kept secret from your old man, Draco?" He asked curiously, eyebrow raised as a servant poured his cup of tea out. Draco had never been able to lie effectively to his father, for those snake like eyes had always had a grip on it's beholder, but Draco had learned to soften the man with sweet words and pretty doe eyes.
"O-oh, uh…" Draco stammered slightly, taking the lollipop out from his mouth. Before he could speak again, Blaise and Pansy stepped in front of him.
Draco waited anxiously the entire day, often staying close to windows and doors, for Harry's response. He sat on the windowsill with his book, flipping through the pages distractedly as he glanced back and forth between the glass and the words. By the time the sun had set and casted a bright orangey rosy glow on the land, Draco had decidedly given up on ever receiving a letter in return. Perhaps he misread their fragile friendship. Maybe Harry simply didn't like the thought of rubbing elbows with the people who conspired to bring down his family. It was understandable, after all. By dinner, Lucius and Narcissa had noticed their son's rather dour mood as he pushed his food around his plate.
"Harry where have you-" Draco was cut off by Harry's hand gripping tighter around his waist to the point that Draco worried that Harry's fingerprints would bruise the soft and milky skin on his hip. A glaring contrast of a blackberry colored bruise against alabaster skin. Harry stuck out his free hand to hold in front of Fenrir.
"And what's wrong with him? He was perfectly polite." Draco scoffed, strolling along the dirt path back towards his home. Hermione ran after him, trying to keep up with Draco's accelerating pace.
"Harry! You're such an idiot. Why did you wait so long to tell me??" Draco whined as he buried his face into the brunette's neck. Harry simply nodded and pet the blonde's hair back.
