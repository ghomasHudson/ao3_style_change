“Harry?” Draco said, more to himself than to Hermione. He sounded plaintive, like someone lost calling for help.
would come. I must have a hundred.”
Draco bit back a smile. When he could speak without giggling, he asked, “How many?”
Because half the battle was showing up, right? And if they could live through this, they could do anything.
But in his mind, he kept replacing the brown eyes with green, the crooked smile with Harry’s.
My voice bounces off the walls in this squalid hovel, but it works. Oh god, it worked.
“The easiest way to keep myself safe at the Manor,” I blurt out before I can stop myself, “Was to be nice to them. To make them laugh. They’d give me extra food. And—stay away from me.” I don’t have to say who; he knows. “Sometimes the Dark Lord would even almost smile. But there’s not a lot of money in Wizard comedy is there?”
Harry rolled his eyes.
He doesn’t answer. His lips blend in with his chalky face.
Draco’s eyes blinked open slowly. “You like-like me?”
When he could breathe, Draco said, “Thanks, Pot—Harry. For what you said to Blaise this morning. That was—”
He signed it and sent his owl on its way.
Papa?”
Harry studied Malfoy as they shook hands—the thin creases at the corner of his eyes as he grinned and the way he grasped Harry’s hand so warmly. Harry thought he might actually

What they don’t realize is, I’ve already fallen.
“Harry, right? Red and yellow scarf and curly hair?” Chad sounds unsure now, and as he backs away, I hold onto his upper arm. It feels hard through his thin coat, like he works out when he’s not surfing.
“I’m going to try something,” Draco said to Harry, who became increasingly edgier the longer they worked in the study. “But you can’t laugh.”
“Potter?” Scorpius’ eyes were wide between each slow blink. “Doctor Harry is Harry Potter?”
Draco leaned against the railing on the concourse, watching the stands fill. Harry stood next to him, their sides pressed together and tried to focus on the patches of orange in the stands. But he could only think about Draco—the places their bodies touched now and had touched all week. That Draco was warm when he slept, and when Harry curled up behind him to leech some of his heat, he had to be careful not to tickle Draco.

Blaise grinned (the one that he used to win his way into a lot of trousers, Draco’s included). “We have a generous producer who’s committed to the success of the show. Knows the right strings to pull. We’ll start with old homes that have a history of Dark magic. They’ll eat that up, what with how Wizards are accepting the past but want a change.”
Granger was chatting with Healer Jenkins. Sohrob from the fourth floor stood awkwardly at Granger’s elbow; she’d probably dragged him along, on a mission to set him up with someone.
“So? Hollywood Studios then?”
With his eyes still closed, he patted the mattress next to him, looking for a knee or a hand, but the space is empty. The only thing that remains is an impression in the pillow and the tumbled blankets next to Draco. His heart broke, but he willed himself to hold the shards together.
“I’ve always hated living at the Manor,” I offer. “The best day of my life was when I left for Hogwarts when I was 11. But everyone expected I’d be friends with Crabbe and Goyle, because our families were friends. By hanging out with them, I made myself just like my father.”
On cue, Draco’s stomach rumbled. “I didn’t eat today. I was too nervous,” he said, with a lopsided smile.
last night, but by the time I got to your end of the bar, you’d already gone.”
“Brilliant. You’re going to love this!” Ginny grinned, and for a sliver of a second, Harry felt his heart warm, plonk out one extra beat in tepid interest. Ginny turned toward the Leaky, her hair catching the noon sun’s rays, and it reminded Harry of bonfires at the Burrow and kissing her when no one was watching.
Not “Oh, Merlin, what have we done.”
“Are you trying to be an arse?” Harry asked, not looking at Malfoy because he was focusing every ounce of energy on
But the alternative was being alone and lonely. Or worse, with someone who made him feel alone and lonely.
“You two. Stop filming. Go make coffee or something,” Draco said and dashed back up the stairs.
Not the Chudley Cannons.
“Remember your letter to me?” Harry whispered. “When I get out—"
“My schemes don’t mean anything if the seats are empty and the team is rubbish.”
Blaise ruffled Draco’s hair. “This is good for today. Besides, we want to give you and Harry time to get to know each other.”
With a sigh, Draco finished cleaning and sanitized his clothes from the day before.
I’ve never been so happy to see the peeling wallpaper of Grimmauld Place in my life. I strengthen the wards, then strengthen them again.
“A nanny?” Potter teased as he sat at the table. He cleared the piles of day-old post and newspapers and made a spot for his plate. “Of course you had a nanny. But she read you Muggle books?”
Potter’s smile faltered for a moment as confusion shaded his face, but Pansy interrupted them.
Potter’s breathing slowly evened out, and Draco knew he’d fallen asleep. He should get up and clean them off, or at least perform a cleansing spell. But his wand was on the floor and the loo was even further away. And maybe, in the morning, they could just clean up in the shower before getting dirty again.
Mr. Dimplethwait shrugged his shoulders and reached for a folder on his desk, careful not to nudge any of the blooms. “Staying static is bad for business, and business is bad.” He handed the paperwork to Harry. “It’s costing a fortune to run this, and the players insist on higher salaries, better brooms, newer uniforms. When I offered a change, they not so politely declined.”
Draco stepped back and rolled his eyes so hard that Harry was worried he might hurt himself. When Draco spoke again, he was serious, thoughtful. “You know. I worked for Dimplethwait for years. Hated him and his sweaty, disgusting body and the stench of his stupid flowers. But I’m so damn grateful to him right now.”
blame you.” Her voice cracked as she spoke. She took his hand in hers and squeezed it.
And now Draco sat next to him at the dinner table, humming along to the Muggle Christmas song on the wireless, tapping the quill against his chin as he thought. His fringe was in his eyes again, and Harry ran his fingers through the fringe, pushing it out of the way, but it fell right back. Harry knew he was supposed to be listening, but he was foggy, imagining slowly removing Draco’s t-shirt, kissing the length of his collarbone, maybe only stopping to leave marks.
Draco Malfoy is Harry's patient, or at least is the one who called for the doctor.
They finished filming well into the evening. The house allowed changes easily, moving walls, expanding rooms, even adding a loo on the first floor and en suite bathrooms on the second floor.
Draco mumbled louder.
Harry pulls Draco aside. “God, I can’t stand it in here any more. Do you know why it’s not getting better?”
“A decision? Already?” Draco stared as if he were afraid to touch it.
And Ginny, intelligent, kind, lovely Ginny, wasn’t it.
“Yeah, well--thanks,” Harry said, not knowing what to say and just remembering he was pissed off at Malfoy.
Potter pulled back slowly, and Draco felt dazed, like the world was in slow motion around him.
sounded like some gnarly surfer dude Spicoli wanna be.

“Why’d you help me find a boyfriend, which you sucked at, by the way?”
was living inside them. If they were lucky, it was just doxies. Given the general lack of repair of the entire house, it could just as easily be rats. Squirrels. Racoons. Possums?!
Harry scanned Scorpius, moving his wand deliberately from left to right from head to sole.
a little angry and a lot aroused. “Now tell me what the hell is going on,” Draco said.
They stood together long enough for her to compose herself, and when she sat down in her chair, Draco turned to Blaise.
“I’m sorry, Papa.” Scorpius’ eyes were still closed, but Harry thought he saw tears at the long white lashes. “I didn’t mean to get you sick, too.”
“What about you?” Harry asks.
Harry jumped, his heart pounding from shock, and his foot knocked into the bucket. The mop in his hand clattered to the floor. Soapy water sloshed over his trainers and his jeans, but all he saw was Draco Malfoy.
“This is the worst fucking date,” Chad says as he crawls off the ice. “All I really wanted was a blowie. I figured, if I was all nice, maybe you’d blow me or let me blow you.”
“What the—Is this another one of your schemes?”
“The three bedroom doors up here—they slammed shut. I think—”
A sharp tapping at the window shattered the mood, and Draco leapt off Harry’s lap.
scheme I like.”
“You know, it’s really rude to—” Harry crossed his arms over his chest so he wouldn’t reach out to wipe the smudge of soot from Draco’s cheek.
Potter’s shoulders relaxed, as if he’d been holding himself rigid waiting for a fight. He hesitated, seemed to measure his words. “You’re, uh, yeah, sure. Anything for Narcissa.” Potter pulled off his cap and dragged his fingers through his hair, obviously uncomfortable.
“A guy from the Catapults stopped by to say hi.”
The door opened and two thoughts collided in Harry’s mind.
“Are you coming to the Holiday party tonight?” Hermione asks as she hangs her robe in her locker. “It’s not going to do you any good to sit home and mope. Besides, we’re all supposed to be there.”
The Chosen One’s chosen one. It has a nice ring.
motion. “I need to make a bag to contain these things.”
“Eggs,” Draco blurted. “Green eggs.”
Thank you a billion times for hanging with this fic. I finished it on the 24th. Just  y'know. March 24.
Auror?”
I’m desperate enough to break the Statute of Secrecy if any Muggles are somewhere in this building. I have to get word to the Aurors, and my only chance to save Harry is by Patronus message. I’ve never successfully conjured one, but I have to try. Nothing matters but this. Not the cold, not the bile rising up my throat from panic. Not the pain.
“Oh, for fuck’s--”  Malfoy took one look at Harry and shook his head in disgust. He grabbed the phone next to the inside front door and stabbed at the buttons on the number pad.
Harry shrugged. He felt stupid admitting he always knew where Malfoy was. “Why’re you back here hiding?”
Outside the stadium, the ticket booths were in worse shape, if that were even possible. And
The swabs come but what's this? Harry's homesick?
With the temperature sorted, they looked around the lobby. All of the plants were gone. “Where is everyone? And the plants?” Harry asked as he looked around.
“And you’ll live where?”
“Well the two of you have been together over a year, and I was wondering how Rita Skeeter’s article affected your relationship.”
Merlin, he hadn’t experienced so many highs and lows since the war, but Harry knew this: if he could live through the chaos of the past 24 hours, he could do anything. He pried open the seal with his thumbnail and withdrew the paper.
But the house was silent, save Puck who was attacking her plush bunny as if their lives hung in the balance.
“It was incredible! The Catapults were like—” and Harry was off, lost in Quidditch and the Cannons. His shoulders loosened, dropped back to their normal place; he relaxed his jaw and neck muscles, and when it came to the end of the night, he could talk about Malfoy.
Harry sat with them, nursing a cup of lukewarm tea. The fairy lights in the kitchenette window blinked on and off, giving Scorpius’ hair rainbow colors.
Harry stepped back and pushed his glasses up to the bridge of his nose. Ginny looked every inch the professional athlete. Tall, slender, but Harry had felt the muscles in her grasp. There was a reason she’d gone first in her draft year, and the records she set for the Holyhead Harpies would be hard for anyone to break.
“What’s going on between you and Harry?” Hermione asked, patting Draco’s hand. “Is everything OK? We won’t be here
“That’s right, Potter. Once you get out.”
“Again, what the fuck?”
“I sent an owl last night giving everyone the day off,” Draco said as he unstuck the front doors. “I saw that Dimplethwait didn’t waste any time getting his ‘babies’ out of here,” Draco said. “Hopefully he cleared his office out, too.”
Harry laughed quietly. “Yeah, I see how it is. They’re in charge.”
“Get up so I can—what are you looking for?”
“You’re motherfucking brilliant, Potter.” And Draco kissed Harry, fast and filthy. No finesse and left no doubt what he was thinking.
“You three look like shit,” Harry said. “What happened?”
Sixten rose from his chair and leaned across to shake Harry’s hand. He flashed a brilliant smile, warm and kind. “Hi, Harry.” His voice held the slightest lilt. “Draco’s spoken of you often.”
“Sure. Bring the new letters from guys wanting to go out with you, and we can go through them at dinner.” If Harry wouldn’t date him, the least he could do was find Harry someone he deserved.
With a deep breath, Harry pushed those feelings aside. He wasn’t 11 anymore, and his reactions were on him. “I can, but do you want fast or do you want right? Besides, Muggle technology is better when it comes to these results.”
I don’t know whether to punch him for kidnapping me or to try to get him help. Draco would know whether he needs a Mental Health Healer.  “Hey, um, this is great and all, but I just got word that there’s a serious case I have to get back for. Uh, Bosses.  You know how they can be. Don’t care if you’re on a date or uh, y’know—”
“I didn’t chase him off—” Harry began, but Kreacher only moaned louder, switching to his misfortunes in life.
“It’s brilliant! Do you think there’s more?”
“Well, when you put it like that—” Harry stormed out of his study where he kept his memorabilia.
“I’m safe for the first time in my life, so I don’t really give a shit about patterns or styles. If you like it, get it. If it’s something you’ll sit on and never leave the house, buy two. I literally do not care as long as you’re part of it.”
on the lot. Potter paid the bill, and when he came back, he grinned at Draco. “You’re going to love these two movies. Should we get popcorn or—”
“Brilliant, as always,” Draco said with fake sincerity. “I don’t know how you do it.”
Harry glared at Ginny, wishing that he’d bothered inventing a spell for a death-ray glare. Or a debilitating glare. Or even a mildly disconcerting glare. She always brought up his fucked-up knee, like it had changed the course of his life or something. He flexed his left knee and then cursed himself for doing it. The damn thing didn’t hurt ‘til someone brought the subject up.
“Sir, please come to the registration area. Auror Potter is here and is insisting he speak with you.”
It could only be Draco Malfoy.
I am chugging along. thank you for your patience and kind words. xox
“Time to get up,” Harry said, rolling out of bed.
Draco’s voice cracked, and Harry felt helpless because Draco was right. Even now, names like Goyle, Crabbe, Parkinson, and Malfoy hung like weights on their shoulders. They were whispered if said at all, and always said with distaste in the same way people spoke of sexually transmitted diseases or magical injuries.
“Hey,” Malfoy said eventually. “I—uh—um—I hope you weren’t angry that I left last night.”
He’s at my bedside and pokes his hand through the slats on the safety rail. They’re there so I don’t fall.
“Quarantined? QuaranTINED?” The splotches on Malfoy’s cheeks grew with each word. “With YOU?”
It went from occasionally, to a few times a week, to every day. Often, Granger couldn’t make it and Draco would wait for Potter.
“That is the funniest damn thing I’ve heard in a long time.” Draco wiped away tears as he gulped for breath. “You’re going to have every eligible wizard from every country dogging you.”
“You’re not mad at me, are you?” Harry interrupted. “We’d been trying to get into this Neo-Death Eater’s group for months, and I got a call that we had visual on them, and I was undercover and I couldn’t tell you and I couldn’t contact you, and I know you’re mad at me, and you probably aren’t even talking to me any more…”
Potter nodded and walked carefully down the snowy stoop. He didn’t look back as he walked away up the pavement. Didn’t stop to look at the pastel homes in his row or the Christmas lights above the street.
They were glad they’d followed her directions and waited until filming was over for the day.
Harry looked into the tin. One gingerbread man was decorated in scarlet robes with gold dots for buttons. One was decorated with lime green robes. “Hey. It’s us.”
“I get it,” Harry said, pushing the desk forward as he stood up abruptly. “It won’t happen again.”
“It wasn’t like that at all,” Malfoy sputtered, but Harry cut him off.
It was the sleep of the dead.
Draco, Harry, Blaise, and Pansy apparated in front of the gates of Malfoy Manor.
Harry kissed him, brushed his lips over Draco’s. “I think it’s worth the risk,” he said. “You’re worth the risk.”
His chest deflated, and his shoulders slumped. “You can’t. There’s nothing to help. He’s not interested.“
to follow the gold threads from the names as far back as the Middle Ages to the most recent. He dropped to his knees and dragged his finger over a blasted out spot. It must have been that of Sirius Black.
It was Harry’s most difficult potion, taking no fewer than three months worth of fireflies caught on the night of the full moon and only between nine and ten pm. It smelled like warm nights and smoky campfires and something he could only describe as
his conscience offered.
and Malfoy backed up a step.
Draco leaned forward into Hermione‘s face. “I’m going to Healer Jenkins and letting her know you need to be off the diagnostic team because your detective skills are shit. There’s no ‘us,’ there never was an ‘us’ and most certainly not for the past year.”
“I don’t have to try. Your collection makes it so easy—”
She sat back and waited for his response.
No noise from anywhere in the house.
Malfoy’s grin broke across his face. “You mean that?”
Ginny laughed, but there was no warmth behind it. “At least I wasn’t pretending to be straight.”
“Research shows that these programs score good ratings if they have a young, handsome man as a host. We think we’ll do even better with 2—”
The single most frightening words you can say to anyone who works in hospital.
“Brilliant!”
With all of his willpower, he chose not to humiliate
“I’d love it,” Harry said. “We’d love it.”
Draco didn’t understand the words; they sounded almost like English, but not quite. When Hermione finished speaking and tapped his wrist with the tip of her wand, his itchiness disappeared. It was a blissful peace, silent and—not itchy.
“Oh, you don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.”
Professional athletes should have certain luxuries in their home-away-from-home, but this changing room was
Turns out, Chad doesn't know much, and definitely not how to ice skate.
“Y’know Harry, it’s gettin’ harder to believe the lengths you’ll go to to avoid doing something with me.” Dylan’s voice was calm without even a small ripple. To Harry, that was worse than if he’d been yelling.
ya'll . i hope this made sense. I'm so tired and i hope I didn't sleep type. I have been known to do that. Bless my heart.
The community dinner is a success and other tid bits.
How the hell did he know that? But before Harry could ask, Draco waved him off. “Before you start with another one of your schemes—“
“Look. I’m sorry. I should have told you I never sleep over anywhere. It’s too intimate, too much like a—”
“Potter!” Draco said, his voice sharp and angry. His hands were balled into shaking fists. “Sixten’s here to help us, and you can’t pull your head out of your arse long enough to say hello?”
The room across from Potter’s was thick with dust. Draco could barely step foot in it; he felt like the darkness would swallow him up. They couldn’t even make it up to the third floor.
That—that wasn’t hard at all. Harry breathed out slowly and if he were overly proud, he was fine with that.
Taking a chance, he moves both of his hands to Harry’s arse and slides a finger into the crevice and circles Harry’s hole.
As for other teams’ opinions?
“McGonagall isn’t like that. Besides, she knows what happened.” Harry had made sure that she knew the ways Draco had protected him and the ways that he’d been a prisoner of war. “Trust me, it’s going to be okay.”
one more chapter. xoxo
Potter was obviously irritated that she wasn’t ready. “Hermione? Lunch?” he asked with a huff.
The ruling board was going to decide that his innovations were illegal. The time and money he and Draco had poured in so far—the BIQL wasn’t going to take that away from them.
Harry broke open the plastic and adjusted the thermostat to 22 degrees. “I can’t believe I’m using air conditioning in December, but short of opening all the windows—”
Later, he could think about what he could have done better. Which tool in his tool belt he could’ve used to act instead of react. How, embarrassed and hurt, he’d forgotten what Beatrix had taught him about taking back his power.
“Who are you talking to, Potter?” Malfoy mumbled into his pillow.
“I kept dreaming about you almost—” Draco’s voice cracked as he held back a sob.
*this chapter takes a poke at me. I live and die by my routines. When I shower, I do it in the same order every time, or I literally have no idea if I've washed something.   I come to McDonald's every morning to write. If I don't get my booth, I--I--idek what to do. I'm in my bed right after dinner (ok, I eat dinner in my bed) to listen to hockey or baseball.
Harry shined the light onto the palm of his hand so Scorpius could see. “Is that alright?”
“I’m an idiot.” Embarrassment colored Harry’s face. He was so stupid, killing any chances he had of this going further. His erection flagged, not that it mattered.
“Well, I’m fairly certain you will both live,” Harry said, pretending to be grave and serious. He packed Wandy McWandface and his other instruments into his bag.
“Neither,” Malfoy said and with a twist he was gone.
Lucky us, today's chapter is brought to us by
“Malfoy’s Patronus—”
“—Were for the staff.
Harry pulled the curtain over the portrait of Walburga Black, muffling her voice.
Christ, Ginny played for this arsehole. The team had suffered through this crap just to play. He felt so bad for them.
Harry blushed, and Ginny kissed his cheek before mercifully letting him go. “It’s no matter to me. I’m happy to have everyone think I’m the genius behind Rolling Scones.”
“No!” Draco said aloud and covered it unconvincingly with a cough.
Draco decided to give Potter a break. “Didn’t the article say
“I was working up to it. These things take time.” Potter’s face was still pale, but embarrassment blotched his cheekbones. “I could probably—”
Together. That’s how they’d show up.
Two days. Two months. Two years. It didn’t matter. Harry knew what he felt. Of course, it wasn’t love (yet), but he was so interested in knowing Draco more. And while he didn’t always get when people were flirting with him, he thought maybe Draco was.
Draco folded his dirty clothes. Put them in a stack on one of the bedroom chairs. Moved them into his suitcase. Turned down the sheets on the bed. Thought that was suggestive, so pulled them back up on Potter’s side. Climbed into bed. Got out of bed. Moved his dirty clothes back to the chair so they wouldn’t smudge the clean ones. Got back into bed and rolled on his right side so he was on the edge of the mattress, leaving a bro-space between where they’d each sleep.
And maybe, just maybe, it was time to face the fact that he had a tiny crush on Harry. But it didn't matter, because Potter had blokes from all over the world writing to him, and Draco was pretty sure none of the were just Junior Healers from Wiltshire.

They waited for questions as the five committee members conferred quietly.

The chapter title comes from
“Listen, Malfoy. I didn’t even agree to be partners with you. I can sell Grimmauld Place—”
“I like you, Malfoy.”
“Congratulations, by the way!” she said, grinning. “The Cannons’ first win in 20 years!”
The flames that had singed my clothes and hair, how my clothes were sweat-drenched. Sometimes, I’d even dream about my fingers grabbing Potter’s body, how it felt to be pressed against him, and I’d try to focus on that instead of being afraid I’d die. Or that I wouldn’t die, and I’d have to live to face my mistakes.
Draco broke the kiss and leaned back enough to look into Harry’s eyes. “I was thinking—I could stay tonight, if it’s okay with you?”
He glares at me, angrier than he’s been so far. He spits his words at me like he’s trying to hurt me. “Because—without a fight, what am I? A scared kid who would’ve failed out of Hogwarts if Hermione hadn’t done most of my work. What other choice did I have?”
It was worth a try.
Dimplethwait, who’d begun moving his beloveds back to their rightful place on the bench in front of desk, waved with one hand and didn’t seem to notice when Malfoy manhandled Harry out of the office.
based loosely on this picture;
“Christ, Harry, what did you do?”
Draco slammed the door—before Potter could see that Draco’s dick had inopportunely remembered that morning, snuggling against a naked Potter. He stepped into the shower, which immediately provided hot water, and scrubbed quickly.
The woman backed off, tucking it under her arm. “Good thing, too. These Chanels aren’t cheap you know.”
Draco hung up, and for the thousandth time wondered why he stayed with Jason. So much of his real life was hidden from Jason because he was a Muggle. And he wasn’t sure Jason was The One he’d be willing to tell.
I'm still chugging along. Thank you for hanging with me.
“A date, Potter. He invited you on a date.” Draco dropped his head into his hands. “How are you an Auror but you missed that big clue?” he said into his palms.
“Uh—if I want to go see a match, I can.”
“What is it, Potter?” Malfoy demanded, taking the wand from Harry’s hand and shaking it. “What does it say?” His face was pale--not as pale as his son’s, but paler than Harry would have liked.
“Hardly trouble or hardly paradise?” Malfoy asked with a raised eyebrow.
With the tea service following behind, he joined Draco upstairs. At least the big couch would definitely be more comfortable than the spartan kitchen chairs.
Scorpius giggled but held on to his dad tighter, as if he could protect him.
“Fine.” But Potter kept teasing Draco, almost sitting on the sheets but popping up when Draco yelled, until they were both laughing.
“Crowd?”
Blaise snorted.
Or a Junior Healer.
Draco smiled at Potter’s abysmal typing skill.
“You don’t remember any of it?” Weasley asked, drawing a notepad and quill from his back pocket. “What’s the last thing you
They might be a spectacle now, a gimmick, a scheme. But Harry knew that, with the trades they had in the pipeline, the Cannons would win matches through talent and hard work, and not just by default.
And finally, I’m happy.
“Are you coming? Or do you want a different doctor?” Harry asked, digging through his black bag and pulling out his stethoscope. Most of the items in the bag were Wizard items: potions, tinctures, a diagnostic wand he’d designed. Some were Muggle items, like his stethoscope and his new infrared thermometer. Occasionally he crossed over, using a stethoscope for Wizards or a discreet spell on a Muggle, but mostly he kept them separated.
Later I’ll be disappointed at the lack of imagination.
Harry corrected quietly. “I had the daft ideas, but you made them happen. You publicized to get people here. You gave the team new equipment. New contracts. You’re the one who told them that no one was safe. Play or get traded.”
“As my chosen one?”
“I had no idea that orchids were so profitable,” Harry said, praying his comment wouldn’t launch another monologue about plants. He surreptitiously blotted the sweat from his face before shoving the tissue back into his trouser pocket.
Ginny opened the shutters and handed him a mug of strong, black coffee. “Look, mate. No offense, but you need to get out. You’re like some old grandpa sitting in his flat waiting to die.” She held up her hand to stop Harry from interrupting. “I mean baby steps, like, I don’t know. Going to the pub with a group of us one night for a little. Or having your groceries delivered to your flat instead of mine.”
Dylan looked up, his eyes wide. “What?”
“Excellent. Now. I’d like to place an order.” Malfoy smiled, and it was brilliant like the first sun rays to break through rain clouds.
Harry threw the newspaper down on the table in disgust, and Draco clucked into his coffee, wondering what had thrown Potter into a tizzy today.
Who wrote this way?
Malfoy grumbled something that sounded like, “Goddamn self-righteous Gryffindor asshole.”
“This is going to be brilliant.” Draco sat up straight in his chair and pulled his appointment calendar from the pocket of his Junior Healer robe. “Are we still good for lunch tomorrow or will you have other plans—”
“That’s not what I’m asking. Can you work with her? Is this going to be a problem?”
Blaise pulled Potter into a side hug. “Thanks for agreeing to work with us, Harry. This show’s going to be the top in its time slot. I know it.”
“No!” Malfoy crawled up the bed and lay next to Scorpius. “You didn’t get me sick, sweetheart.” He locked pinkies with Scorpius and promised.
nice. Nice. He meant nice.
“Yeah, yeah,” Draco blushed.
When Pansy pulled Potter aside to talk to him, Blaise turned to Draco. “Mate, you might want to stop staring at Potter.” He laughed openly at Draco, whose face turned red like the frozen berries on the bushes.
Neither Hermione nor Draco were listening. Weasley stood next to the gurney, his Auror uniform covered in blood, some splatter, some soaked in great swaths. But he was okay. Good. Healthy.
The players showed more energy and intensity in their 200-130 win over the Holyhead Harpies than they had all season. Although they scored only five goals to the Harpies’ 13, Rodgers caught the Snitch in a daring dive, edging out the Harpies’ seeker by a fingertip.
“Use red icing for the lettering. It should say
Dimplethwait looked at Harry in confusion. Or was that an act, too?
“Yeah.” Harry nodded with a tired smile. “But I’ll be alright. I always am.”
“That was impressive, Potter. I didn’t know you had it in you.”
Harry smiled and nodded in agreement. “I know. But if they all brought a few family members, maybe our attendance would go up?”
based on this prompt:
“I’m better off. He was always flirting with other people, and I had some suspicions he was maybe doing stuff behind my back.”
I wrestle with the ropes binding my hands, too frigid and numb to know if I’d sliced into my skin and too pissed off at Potter to care. He bollocksed this up. Him and his typical Gryffindor recklessness. “You see a pretty girl lying on the pavement clutching her leg—”
“Well, I do know this. None of us are going anywhere for at least a week. We’re quarantined here. Together.”
Blaise grumbled as he pulled his wallet out of his trousers’ back pocket. “It was never supposed to work.”
But Draco just nodded.
Harry took Draco in, and Draco almost came just from being there. It’s too much and not enough, and he wanted to move but he can’t move. He breathed deep, counted to ten to gain control, to let Harry be in charge.
“This is nice,” Harry mumbled. “But you wake up too early.”
Draco insists he needs to sleep in the house to get the best Renovation possible.

“I think the last time this was cleaned was when Molly Weasley had us do it when the Order’s headquarters was here.” Potter looked around in the mostly empty room. Some pieces of furniture had been taken to the foyer for further inspection and possible use, but most couldn’t be salvaged. Those went into the dumpster, along with the curtains, the doxy-eaten rugs, and most trinkets. The tapestry remained; Draco said he would eventually create a frame from repurposed wood.
“Let me see you,” Draco said, pushing Harry’s jeans and boxers down over his hips. “Jesus,” Draco breathed as he looked at Harry’s already hard cock. It was thick and stood upright, angled toward the trail of thick, coarse hair leading down from Harry’s navel.
While Potter stood in the doorway and spluttered, Draco opened his suitcase and pulled out his toiletry kit and disappeared into the loo. Potter could damn well take his pillow and blanket and sleep somewhere else. He owned the damn house. It
Draco froze. “I can’t. I haven’t been to Hogwarts since—”
Harry struggled to stay awake. “But—but—we were dating.”
stopped by to pay my respects to your mum, you know, to check in on her because no one else does—” Blaise said with a smirk.
“Well, Potter. Either I get your room or there’s no filming tomorrow and
“Since we can,” Harry said, standing up with the one empty bowl, “You should probably call me Harry.”
“We’ll make it happen. You haven’t been wrong yet,” Malfoy said.
Whatever.
Okay, so what was wrong with wanting a quiet life? And it wasn’t
Blaise didn’t buy it for one moment. “Sure, sure. Tomorrow we’ll meet in Hogsmeade. Make sure you’re there by 11. That should give you enough time.” He rolled his eyes at them before nudging Pansy down the stairs.
Harry laughed. “Not if you’re gonna be a dick about it.”
Malfoy stopped at the couch and picked up the white sequined pillow with the words
“Do you think Harry would mind if I visited?” she asked, definitely not looking at their hands.
It wasn’t Ginny. It was stupid, fucking Malfoy who Harry wanted to be with. And a few times, Harry thought maybe Malfoy might feel the same way. But with his tantrum, he’d probably fucked that up.
Malfoy shook his head slightly, but Harry knew he’d get the last word. Harry helped Malfoy stand. “Let’s get you out of those clothes and into bed.”
After that, Potter barged into their lunch occasionally. He’d sit down as if he’d been invited, didn’t seem to care when his plates popped up on the table on top of confidential folders, and offered his non-medical opinion on their cases.
“Still horribly, horribly in debt?” Harry asked once Draco picked up the paper.
“Potter, you’re brilliant. I could kiss you!” Draco said, lurching forward to hug Harry for a second.
Draco has the perfect answer to Harry's finances and a solicitor to help them.
Draco stood naked, pressed against Harry. “Was that fucking wandless magic?” Draco asked, staring at the pile of clothes on the floor.
Within the hour, the foyer was bathed in sunlight flooding through the sidelights on either edge of the doorway. They noticed it was easier to see into the drawing room.
The committee secretary laid out the complaint against them: that they’d violated every Quidditch rule by taking the game indoor, and that the other teams in the BIQL had brought their complaints forward and were asking for the Cannon’s new stadium to be declared illegal.
“No, I--I mean--they said we could but we didn’t have to.” Malfoy struggled to sit up in the bed.
She filmed all the way down until she couldn’t see them any more.
“I don’t know, Puck,” he said, picking her up and burning his face into her furry neck. He didn’t care about getting fur on his polo shirt or jeans. “I thought we were okay, but—”
“Just—talk to me,” Potter says. “Tell me something I don’t know. Get my mind off this.”
Malfoy was trying to look stern, but the tip of his tongue peeked out between his lips, and Harry’s resolve melted. He flipped Malfoy off, but it felt weak and fond.
That caught Dimplethwait’s attention. He pursed his lips and nodded. “The Shenzen Nongke is one absent from my collection. My dealer has said he could possibly obtain one for 10,000 Galleons…”
“Rain—train!”
Draco turned Harry back toward him and then sank to his knees. The tub was hard, and he would regret this later, but right now, he needed this. To taste Harry and just know.
He fell asleep before he could decide.
“Am I doing this out of the goodness of my heart or—” Draco swirled his Firewhisky around the tumbler, debating whether he’d need another to swallow Blaise’s proposal.
And if the giant swirl of whipped cream in the ridiculous snowman mug smushed into the arm of his probably Cashmere jumper, it didn’t matter one bit to Harry.
had real problems. This was just Malfoy swanning off.
s before turning to Harry. They spoke deferentially to The Saviour of the Wizarding World, like they wanted to bow to him or kiss a ring. Harry despised it, hated when people made a big deal over something that was over and done. He liked that about Malfoy—he treated Harry like a person not some—overblown myth. Malfoy never hesitated to shoot him down, laugh at him, tell him he was wrong. It was kind of refreshing, now that Harry thought about it.
“Are you holding the knife by the blade?” I ask, because he can’t be. That would be stupid, even for Potter.
And Blaise talked.
Draco nodded. Harry didn’t think the conversation was done, just done for now. They’d absolutely have it again in some form when they got to the Burrow and were inundated with Weasleys. And judging from the shimmer on Ginny’s finger today, she and Blaise would have an announcement today.
“So you’re saying you don’t swallow?”
Potter opens his mouth—
Oh Merlin! Potter!
Harry sipped his coffee, ignoring his grits in the hopes that if he couldn’t see them, they might disappear. If Dylan turned away, Harry could use wandless magic to make them disappear before Dylan looked back. But how would he explain the missing bowl?
Maybe it wasn’t a risk at all.
“We wait to see if the house has accepted our good will.”
“If anyone knows about being in hospital, it’s Potter,” Draco Malfoy added as he began sorting the pile.
I'm going to take a little time to finish editing a novel based on
“Welcome everyone! Welcome!” Narcissa walked quickly up the hall to greet them. “Happy Christmas! Please come in.”
is my business. Been in my family for generations. Once, my great-great grandfather—”  He held up a familiar clear glass bottle and told a story about how his family had cornered the market.
“It’s snowing outside, but we are warm and dry in the council chambers. Each of us knows it wasn’t always so. Even with magic, we could have only kept the cold at bay for so long. I’m sure we all remember what this building, the Ministry of Magic, was like before the renovation a few years ago, with the faulty charms and the damp seeping into the wood structure.
Draco and Harry flung apart, flew to opposite edges of the bed, as if they’d been caught by parents and then laughed at how stupid they felt.
Harry closed his eyes, took as much of Draco into his mouth as he could. He loved the stretch at the corners of his lips, the weight on his tongue, the tang as he flicked the tip of his tongue over Draco’s slit.
“What the fuuu--” Harry said then remembered not to cuss in front of a child.
He said
“What are you staring at?” Potter asked with a smirk. He raised his eyebrow as he asked.
“If we don’t get up, we’re going to have a camera in our faces,” Draco began to say, but Harry’s hand was trailing down his hip, then to his dick, which had been half hard probably most of the night.
THIRD, enjoy Evgeni Malkin from the Pittsburgh Penguins with his own bobblehead:
“I reckon he thinks we’re on a date,” Harry said, tucking his napkin on his lap. If he looked up, Draco would absolutely see the pink on his cheeks and there would be no way he could play it off as wind chill.
American bacon, though. Now that was seriously brilliant. Thick slices of smoked bacon. Warm and delicious. The best thing about America. Harry demolished his bacon, picked at the eggs, and left the grits untouched.
What Harry lacked in technique, he made up for in enthusiasm. He pulled off for a moment, and Draco whined, tried to pull Harry back down. But Harry only smiled; his lips were red and swollen, and
“That’s good,” Malfoy said just before a giant sneeze.
Harry thought, hiding his repulsion. He’d probably used them hundreds of times in Potions.
Draco dragged Harry’s orange Cannons t-shirt over his head and tossed it away. “Merlin, I love the clothes you wear.”
Maybe Dylan was right, Harry thought. He hadn’t taken a vacation in over a year, mostly because this job just seemed like a vacation. He didn’t work all that often, but--well, maybe it was more than he thought.
The pub stall was crowded, but it gave Draco a chance to stand pressed against Sohrob, to feel the muscles of his thighs and to imagine him in Draco’s bed.
“Your turn, Papa. And I was brave, so you have to be, too!”
The whiskey in his empty stomach churned ugly and hot; it was the whiskey and not that he loved Harry. That Harry had left him without a word.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Mother. Harry and I—” and he kissed Harry in a way he was fairly sure wasn’t fit for company.
Y’all. I was Literally falling asleep as I was writing this. Like sleep typing. So if something makes NO sense let me know  lololol
“What? Why?” Potter sounded confused, worse than usual. “It wasn’t more awkward than finding you in bed with
Since we’re stuck lying on the floor face to face, I have to look at him. At his ugly face with those eyes like the spring gardens at the Manor. And his stupid biceps that want to bulge out of the sleeve of his uniform, and his shoulders that are too wide—“We should sit up. I think you’ll have a better angle with the knife.”
“Yeah, great. My boyfriend just broke up with me. He said I was away too much.” Draco let out an
Harry grinned and with a tap of his wand, transfigured Draco’s business robes into Slytherin Quidditch robes.
Draco flushed, and Harry suspected he’d hit too close to the truth. With its garish colors and its spectacular losing streak, the Cannons would never have appealed to Draco in the past.
“That’s
Harry completed the test on himself, scrubbed his hands clean, and decided he’d begin with Scorpius.
McGonagall looked bright and the happiest Harry’d ever seen her. “Alright, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy.” She shook Harry’s hand and smirked over her shoulder at Portrait Snape. “And if this scheme works, perhaps we can schedule something regularly.”
Potter’s staring at me, and he’s biting down on his lip so he doesn’t say something stupid. This time, I don’t think he’s angry with me. “Your father is a fucking arsehole,” he says
“We’ll see,” was as far as Draco would give, partly because he thought it was funny to see Potter so upset. Okay,
“What are you doing? Are you grabbing my purse? Are you stealing my purse?” the woman whirled around and confronted Draco, leaning threateningly over him.
“Wandless Patronus,” Harry whispers. “Not bad.”
Harry wrinkled up his nose and bit his lip in his best approximation of a rabbit. Scorpius copied him, and as he was biting into a make-believe carrot, Harry asked him, “Do you remember our colors?”
Harry hated grits. It was mealy and soupy and looked enough like oatmeal that the taste was confusing. And mealy. And soupy.
Draco snapped his fingers, and Potter, whose eyes were red rimmed but seemed alright, lifted the portrait off the wall and headed toward the back garden to the dumpster Draco had transfigured from a small, cardboard box.
“I assumed you were the—who
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco’s exaggeration. “Nice. We’ve been in this canteen all of 15 minutes, but sure. Listen to this!” He read the four sentences aloud and waited for Draco’s outrage.
Next and next until the
But at least there’ll be a nice roast.”
“Shut the fuck up.”
Blaise said that to piss him off and wouldn’t rise to it.
Harry thought to himself as Malfoy cozied up to Sixten and picked a piece of imaginary lint off his obviously high-dollar suit jacket.
“Put your bowl in the sink and see yourself out.”
Pansy smacked Blaise before he could respond. “You knew this was a possibility when you cast both of them.”
Harry squawked out, “What now?” Malfoy’s polite words managed to be simultaneously posh and scathing. A wave of something flooded Harry. It felt like being homesick, for Molly Weasley, and warm, full hugs and Sunday dinners, and the first day back at Hogwarts after too long hols with the Dursleys.
The bed is the elephant in the room.
“You—still want to—”
Draco motioned for Pansy to start filming again, hoping to make amends. “My apologies, Pot—Harry. We’ll get this liveable—lovely. We’ll get this lovely in no times.”
He didn’t wait for an answer. He grabbed Harry’s hand and pulled him out the front door. They were barely down the steps when Harry stopped. “Damn. I wish we’d got jackets.”
“You could, yeah.” But Harry didn’t want Lundberg there. Not really. It was as if this business between them was too new, something for just the two of them to share. He thought as fast as he could. “But uh, I don’t know about, y’know, how much Kreacher made, or what it will be. It’s probably not Swedish meatballs or lutefisk or Swedish fish—the stuff they eat.”
Based on this prompt
Draco wanted to cover his eyes from the glare as the canteen lights shone from his teeth.
Draco preened, and Harry really shouldn’t have thought that was as hot as it was. “We couldn’t possibly,” Draco said. “That information is covered in our pending patent. Let’s just say that, no matter where the Snitch appears, the Seekers will have no trouble getting to it.”
“Will you tell me how brilliant my scheme is?”
“Are you accusing me of…I’m not...” Draco stuttered, committing homicide in his thoughts. “Just shut it. I just haven’t seen him in years. How do you two even know each other?”
An article that appeared in
Harry quickly agreed.
“Don’t you dare get into that bed until you’ve taken a shower. You’re disgusting.”
“But, no one’s ever—” Malfoy argued, but it sounded half-hearted, like he wasn’t sure why he was fighting. “It’s not right—it’s I mean, there’s no reason—”
“But they were brillia—”
“For real? I didn’t—” Ginny’s face was bright as she pretended to be surprised. But Harry knew her bullshit, knew she needed something.
“That’s not what you said last night,” Harry laughed. “But I can try harder tonight.”
“I’ve been thinking of getting a dog,” Harry said. He brushed his cheek over Scorpius’ fur and loved the silky feel.
This time, Malfoy snickered at Potter. “Business model. Do you know even what that means?”
“It’s brilliant. London seems a bit smaller when I take him on walks. People are friendlier, and I don’t feel so alone.”
Draco grudgingly admitted to himself that Potter’s chest wasn’t unpleasant to occasionally look at, if he had to. He thought that he’d seen a small tattoo on Potter’s side, but when he looked closer,
Harry scrambled off the bed, careful not to hurt Draco. He stripped out of his clothes until he was naked, and fuck, his cock was long, thick enough he knew it would burn, and Draco wanted it.
When Draco came out, teeth-brushed, face-washed, and wearing only linen pyjama bottoms, he stopped suddenly. “What the fuck?”
You know, like a good friend would.
“I suspect we’ll have an answer later today,” Sixten whispered to Harry. “Could be a few days, but your next match is Saturday—they need to decide before then.”
Scorpius begged to watch late night telly, and Malfoy agreed on the condition that he eat something. Anything. He sat Scorpius on his lap at the kitchenette table, and when the soup appeared on the table, Scorpius ate a few spoonfuls before pushing his bowl aside. Draco didn’t argue. He just moved the bowl aside so Scorpius wouldn’t fall asleep in it.
“What am I supposed to do? Write, Dear Potter, I want to fuck you into the mattress so hard and so long that you can’t even think about getting on your Auror broom tomorrow.”
but that didn’t make sense. He was just trying to help, y’know, wipe the dust off him.
“It’s called
Hysteria creeps into my voice, and Auror training taught me to be better than that. Why aren’t I better than that?
Thank Merlin for bobbleheads.
Harry dropped his head into his hands. “Kreacher, stop.”
is officially over, I still have 3 more chapters.
Potter never did spill his secrets that he came to talk to Granger about. But the next day he showed up at their table in front of the decorated Christmas tree at Saint Mungo’s canteen with a yellow monstrosity under his arm. Granger laughed when Potter handed the stuffed toy to Draco.
Malfoy's different. He's got a sense of purpose, and now, the new owner of the Chudley Cannons does, too.
“Oh, Potter, please. You are pathetically easy to fool. You can barely see what’s right in front of you. But in this case, I’m not lying. Dr. Seuss was a wizard. Who else could write nonsense and pass it off as plot? Not in a box. Not with a fox. Not in a house. Not with a mouse.”
Much.) And he checked his mailbox at the Owl Post Office at one o’clock.
Draco slogged upstairs. “I’m too tired to care.I just want a hot shower and a blanket. Not sure I even care about a bed.”
Draco's going to help Harry find a boyfriend, even if it kills him (slowly, very slowly) as he does.
By the time they finished going over the contract and making suggested changes, it was well past dark. “Thank Merlin that’s over,” Malfoy said through a yawn.
Harry rolled his eyes, but she was right. “Baking dozens of croissants isn’t the same as going out in public.”
“It’s our first Teddy Bear Toss,” Potter said, standing in front of a small mountain of the toys. “This weekend the team is going to meet and take them to the kids’ ward at St. Mungo’s. It’s a small thing we can do to make a tough day in hospital a little brighter.”
“Last evening around 7:00 Florida time. We took a late Portkey.” Malfoy tugged at the collar of his jumper and dragged it off, over his head where it got stuck for a moment. He finally wiggled it off and threw it to the floor. “It’s hot in here. It’s just so hot everywhere here. For Merlin’s sake, it’s December. It’s not meant to be hot.”
He’s smiling like he’s so damn proud of me. “I know,” is all he says.
Pansy stopped filming and patted Draco on the shoulder. “Sweetie. Trust me. He’s not lying.”
I close my eyes and imagine walking hand in hand with Harry. He stops and turns to me, says he needs to kiss me.
According to my outline, there should be 23 chapters. <3
“I’ll bet you do,” Draco said, which made no sense. He was irritated—at every stupid thing Potter was. His unruly hair falling over his glasses, his perfect teeth behind that wide smile. And now, Draco would have to carry this show, do everything while Potter did nothing, lounging around probably shirtless in the sun. Oh, he knew it was December, but somehow, some way, they would find every opportunity for Potter to be shirtless. Film
Draco exhaled, shaky and high pitched, and Harry kissed him fast and filthy now, tiny movements of his tongue that promised what he wanted to deliver. “Wanna taste you, swallow you. Make you come and—”
He handed it to Malfoy, who looked discouraged as he put it on the desk. Harry went back to the corner cabinet, throwing shit away. They worked in silence for quite a while, and Harry hated it. He liked when Draco was all know-it-all and making fun of him, not all quiet and gloomy, worried about Merlin knows what.
She hugs me so tightly that I wince. My shoulders are angry. “So, we hug now? It’s a thing we do?” My voice is shredded, but I try to sound wry instead of pitiful.
kind of Dyl to cook for him. Still clutching his coffee, Harry took the plate from Dylan, nudging the patio chair leg so Dyl could sit. He set the plate on the wrought iron table but held onto the mug.
That was just typical Malfoy bullshit, he thought as he stalked out of that greenhouse of a building and into the frigid December afternoon. He had no idea where the Trainers’ room was, but now that he apparently owned the Cannons, it was probably time to find out.
“Yeah,” Harry beamed. “Wasn’t it great?”
Harry’s anger flashed, but he bit back the ugly. “Do you mean after sex? A booty call? A casual hook up? If we’re old enough to do it, we’re probably old enough to be able to
Over the past three weeks, the stories have died off. Players’ contracts have been extended with generous raises, and many people in the stands at tonight’s match wore bright orange Hogwarts Night shirts or sported rainbow scarves from Pride Night.
“Oh, yes of course. There are probably a dozen bedrooms in that old place. Plenty of room for two people to live in.” She nodded wisely.
“According to the weather lady, it’s gonna be a beautiful day.” Dylan stepped back into the kitchen, and when he reappeared, he held two plates of bacon and scrambled eggs, biscuits, and grits.
He grabbed his wand from the nightstand and pretended that he wasn’t hoping Draco would be in the lounge reading Harry’s
Draco grabbed Harry by the shoulders and held him in place. “Do you even have 20 million Galleons?” he hissed.
And then he was furious, and any desire for a bath and his bed were consumed by his anger. He recklessly disapparated on his front stoop and reappeared on the pavement in front of Potter’s house. He wanted to yell until Potter opens the door, shout that he’s a coward and to open the fucking door.
“I beg your—” Draco sputtered, touching his nose for blood.
Harry thought.  “Oh, come on. It wasn’t that bad.”
look good—good enough that Harry almost thought he might possibly consider maybe opening the shutters the next afternoon when Malfoy picked up his cupcakes.
Draco didn't answer, but Harry held out hope.
“Blaise! Pansy! Bring the camera!” Draco yelled down the stairwell.
“Potter. The file?” Malfoy asked in exasperation and pointed in front of Harry.
And kissed the breath out of Draco.
With a quick wave of his wand, Harry sterilized the instruments, and together he and Scorpius examined Malfoy, whose temperature was higher and when threatened at wand point, acknowledged that he felt like he’d been-- “What do you Americans say? Rode hard and put up wet?”
“Aha! I know you know I’m right when you start changing the subject.” Ginny danced away to clean the few tables, singing a song only she knew.
From here on in, kids, we're unbeta'd. Enjoy my wild mind.
But in the dark, it wouldn’t matter.
“Right!” Harry said, waving the paper like a flag. “Now we’re just horribly in debt.”
Before they’d left the mansion, Narcissa handed Harry and Draco each a small box. “For you both but open them when you’re alone.”
Draco nodded. He gave it a 7 out of 10 that the words ‘happily ever after’ were involved.
When other teams lodge official complaints against the Cannons for their unorthodox pitch, they're called to defend themselves.
He side-along apparated Potter to his office.
Malfoy dropped his head against the back of the couch and closed his eyes. “This has been one hell of a day. It must be what? 9:00 at night?”
Draco glanced down the bar, but the man was gone. Probably thrown out on his generous arse. If he didn’t have the common sense to dress appropriately, that’s exactly what should happen.
Clearly I'm not going to hit "posting every day." sigh. but onward and upward.
TW: MAJOR INJURY
Pansy punched Blaise in the arm. Based on the way he cringed, it wasn’t a play punch. And it wrinkled his suit jacket. “Damn, Pans.”
“No, he hasn’t been bitten by a gator,” Malfoy said, pushing the door open all the way. His son lay in the Queen size bed. He turned over but didn’t open his eyes, just mumbled
Thanks for following along.  The title comes from this song
“Wow” was all Harry could say.
Harry and Malfoy said at the same time, one louder than the other, but that still didn’t stop Scorpius who was bouncing on the mattress with more energy than he’d had the entire time Harry had been there.
Tonight’s win over the Holyhead Harpies marked the first time the Cannons had beaten them in two centuries. That makes the Cannons 4-0 under new ownership, even if the first three were forfeits.
Harry and Draco meet with Headmaster McGonagall about their next special event: Chudley Cannons salute Hogwarts!
All Harry knew at that moment was that he liked the soaring better than spiraling and wanted to share that feeling with Malfoy. Maybe it was the winter fairy tale scene with the snow and Christmas songs and Good Will, but maybe it was time.
“Oi! Potter! Malfoy!” Pansy’s holler thundered up the stairs.
Yes, I listened to
Malfoy struggled to sit up, and Harry worried about how labored his breathing seemed. “I don’t--”
like a huge ton of thanks to FleurySexual and Crowgirl42 for pointing out when things are crap. All remaining crud is my fault. lolol.
“No one could have foreseen a time when we didn’t ache from each day’s toil, didn’t fall into bed at dusk to wake at dawn and begin again. I can’t imagine what they would think of us in the 21st Century, with our temperature-controlled offices and our portkeys and our take away meals.”
McGonagall raised her eyebrows, and Harry thought she was almost impressed. “Tell me about that bit of magic.”
“I. Know. It’s brilliant.” Harry was almost bouncing in his chair in excitement. If he could get Draco to agree to this, the rest would be easy. “People will want to come to a game just to see what a stupid idea Indoor Quidditch is. And when they’re watching in their robes instead of winter robes and scarves and gloves and everything—They’ll keep coming back.”
Draco’s head snapped up, and he stared at Harry.
“But you’ve been alright. Been fair to us with increases in pay, and top notch renovations to the players area. And new equipment. We want to be fair, to help out; keep you mates here. Even if he is a Malfoy.”
He couldn’t believe he’d been stupid enough not to ask Blaise about his cohost.
“That doesn’t make sense,” Draco said, moving a half-dozen pots out of the way so he could fit easier on the desk. When Mr. Dimplethwait heard clay scraping against wood, he whirled around, but Draco stood and re-placed the flowers before Mr. Dimplethwait could speak. “Smart as ever. I’m a financial adviser. I work with a variety of clients to maximize the return on their investments.”
“Merlin, keep going,” Harry begged between kisses. Draco’s hands felt scorchingly hot on arse, and he imagined what they would feel like on his inner thigh or wrapped around his cock.
Draco felt the muscles in his jaw and shoulders immediately tense. “I do visit.”
“Make me, Potter,” Malfoy said with a smirk.
Blaise droned on, a meaningless buzz in Draco’s ear. “Pansy and I call it
Draco swallowed hard and finished reading.
“Sounds good. Should I send a message to Sixten to meet us there?”
“In so many ways, Potter. So many ways.”
Like maybe,
being mean—” He remembered his lesson. He inhaled and blew it out slowly and reminded himself that he was in charge of his emotions now. Harry looked away from her, not wanting to show he was angry because  her words hurt. Or how true her words were.
Draco handed Potter a plate and realized he was staring at Draco.
Harry interrupted Dimplethwait before he could launch into yet another long-winded anecdote. “I’m sorry, I—Are you—You’re not serious. The Cannons are a legacy,” Harry sputtered, leaning forward in his chair. “The name. The fluorescent orange. You can’t change.”
The anger drained out of Harry, left him weary and unwilling to fall into old patterns that he’d fought too hard to break. He righted his overturned chair and sat down. “Yes, I did try to convince myself I was straight, but I’m not. And I’m sorry for making you part of that. It’s one of the issues we’re working on it in therapy. But that’s not what you wanted to talk about.”
ex-boyfriend!”
“Jesus, what the fuck?” Harry asked, scrubbing his hand on his face.
“Did you mean this?” Potter asked, waving the letter at Draco.
Ginny leaned back in her chair, her arms crossed over her chest and her legs spread out under the table. She smirked. “Oh, do you really wanna do that?”
“Your shirt. Give me your shirt.” Draco waggled his fingers in a
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked young and beautiful, no worry lining his forehead, no cares etched on his face. Harry wanted to reach out and brush the snowflakes out of Draco’s hair, off his shoulders. Maybe kiss the one that landed on his cheek. These feelings he had—they were like when he’d learned to fly a broom. Soaring up, racing down, almost crashing but pulling up before disaster.
broom handle polish.
Harry watched him examine the knick-knacks he’d accumulated over the past ten years, some gifts from friends and some from his occasional travels to Europe and the States. He felt awkward, like Malfoy was somehow judging his life. Harry squirmed as Malfoy continued his circuit around the room, looking at framed pictures and touching anything he found interesting.
Some tiny part of me thought, maybe, if I told him about Chad wanting to blow me, that he would volunteer. Get on his knees, unzip my trousers, and suck me off til I came down his throat. Or finished on his face. And maybe he’d call me Harry.
“Nice guess, but I doubt it’s much past noon.Wanna bet?” Harry checked the time on his phone and saw he had 10 text messages and one missed call. “Fuck! I have to call Dylan and let him know what’s up.” His stomach lurched at the thought of the fuss Dyl would make. Drama. Always so much drama with him.
“Umhmmm.” Harry punctuated Dylan’s monologue when he stopped for a breath without committing to anything.
“He’s a good kid, Malfoy.” Harry hesitated then said, “You’ve done a great job raising him.”
Harry kissed him, a quick one to punctuate his sentence, and then slower, sweeter.
“You can double fuck—” Potter began, but they were interrupted by a tall, slender man with dark hair and a three day beard growth that was magnificently groomed.
Potter sat up straight and leaned in again. “It. Didn’t. Matter. The things they said. It was—so filthy.”
Harry changed the angle of his hips, and Draco gasped against Harry’s lips. “Fuck, don’t do that again.” He felt a shiver run through Draco. “Because I’ll come.”
In the middle of Tickles’ Fine Furnishings and Rug Emporium, on camera that may be edited out or might make the final footage, Draco kissed Harry. Not a peck, but not heated and passionate.
It’s the last thing he says.
Draco can’t wait, wants it now,
The time rambling around the States—they’d been good days, what he’d needed after his very public breakup. Someone else in charge, moving him from place to place, responsible only for feeding himself, even if it was only hot dogs and peanuts. He lost himself in the piss Americans call beer, in baseball and then hockey. Comparing players and their statistics. Arguing over coaches’ decisions. Rehashing games late into the night. It was Quidditch, just different.
my name.” Draco smiled warmly at Harry. He stacked the bowls and plates and carried them to the sink. “Let’s talk about some of the ideas you have for the Cannons.”
“Ginny said something about—”
As Blaise and Pansy left the room, Draco heard him mutter, “It’s not my money.”
While it wasn’t a huge crowd by typical Quidditch team standards, it was the largest the Cannons had seen in years. If attendance is any indicator, the new owners are succeeding in their quest to make Quidditch fun again. Season ticket sales have “tripled in the past month”, and single match tickets “have skyrocketed,” according to Malfoy. When asked for specifics, Malfoy declined to answer. “Let’s say, anyone who’s been to a Cannons match in the past 20 years already knows. We’re looking to the future. We want to keep growing the fan base back to its heyday.”
“How’d you know that was there?”
Maybe he would do just that after dinner and dessert.
Harry folded his arms on the table and hid his face in them.
“Fox—box.”
Someone clearing his voice at their open door ended any intentions Harry might have had. “Coach. What’s up?”
Coach looked over his shoulder to make sure Draco was gone. “Y’know. We weren’t sure when you two bought the Cannons, because no matter how bad it is, yeah? It can always get worse.”
“Your bag almost hit him,” Harry said with a straight face. “He didn’t want anything to happen to it.”
He didn’t know what Draco was going to say. Probably something caustic about the blow job or Grimmauld Place. Harry looked up at him, but Draco’s eyes were still closed, and a smile pulled at one side of his mouth.
“No, because I was too busy feeling bad for myself.”
“You absolute fucker,” Draco said, grabbing Harry as he walked down the stone steps from the office. He pushed Harry against the wall and crowded him.
over and over.
But, how could he? He’d spent two years hiding. He couldn’t just
The bowl of grits was still there. Harry moved it off his plate and picked at the eggs as Dylan rambled on about the National Seashore or Cape Canaveral or y’know--Dyl paused as if he had just had a brilliant idea. “Disney. Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios! Yes!” and he was off again, something about Star Wars or Star Trek or something.

Because his mobile phone wouldn’t work inside most magical houses, there’d been no reason to bring his. But he hadn’t expected the initial meeting to last as long as it had.
Narcissa owl’d back before their lunch break was finished that they were welcome to visit and that perhaps they would like to bring the filming crew and come for Christmas dinner.
How the fuck had he forgotten he wasn’t dressed—that he was still only wearing his pyjama bottoms? Five minutes before he’d felt rested and ready to face the day. Now he just wanted to climb back into bed (but not Potter’s!) and hide.
Harry looked around for Malfoy’s son. “Is he still at his day nursery?” he asked, instead of
about the Muggle President John F. Kennedy and his son JFK, Junior, who could never quite live up to his father’s name? In its Greco-Roman roots, theater was performed outdoors in amphitheaters, but sensibly moved inside. We celebrate that with record-breaking attendance, which means profit for both the owners and athletes.
Draco was thankful for the change of topic. With a sigh of relief, he said, “We can go to Hogsmeade tomorrow, if you like. I know an eclectic little resale shop. Everything from antiques to kitsch?”
Harry grabbed Draco’s hand to pull him upstairs to his bedroom; he fell forward, arms windmilling, headed face first to the floor. Draco snagged him, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist before he tumbled to the floor.
Harry stood abruptly and leaned forward, resting his weight on his fists. That way, he couldn’t punch Malfoy in his pompous, posh mouth. “No, because I’ve grown the fuck up. You should try it.”
shoot. sex is hard to write.
But he didn’t look sorry at all.
“—fans are going to complain—”
Once he was fully dressed jeans and a cashmere sweater, Draco allowed filming to begin again. He held a basket in one hand and a fresh cup of black coffee in the other.
“I have some at home. I can bring one tomorrow—”
have to tell your boyfriend that we can’t do it.”
His smile was distracting to Draco. It was a nice smile, wide and carefree, like his biggest worry was when he’d have his next cup of coffee.
“You shouldn’t be allowed to own—you’ve run this into the ground.” Harry stood and stepped forward until he was in Dimplethwait’s space. A drop of Harry’s sweat fell onto Dimplethwait’s cotton dress shirt, and Harry took a perverse pleasure as Dimplethwait’s face paled. “How much do you want for the Cannons?”
“I was inside. They didn’t like me, but they needed me because I knew spells they didn’t, like the Muggle levitation spell. They’re planning to rob Gringott’s, but I kept saying it was stupid because of the security problems. They started fighting—that’s all I remember.”
Thanks for following this new fic! ♥
Harry shook his head to clear his thoughts. The smile was
spell.
there was nothing there. He must have been mistaken.
Harry looked at their hands, casually together, at the dust that streaked Draco’s knuckles. It had been just barely 48 hours since Draco had bossed himself back into Harry’s life. Two days. How could he feel this much so fast?
Harry pulled Malfoy’s plate close enough that he could cut chunks of cake with his fork and shove them into his mouth. No wonder Malfoy laughed when Harry called himself a pretty face.
He pushed away from the table and grabbed his full plate and stalked into the kitchen. “Like, I’m kinda sick of it. We don’t even know if it’s real.”
“The first thing I like to do,” Harry said, rooting through his bag and tossing items helter-skelter onto the bed. He held up a pair of hedgehog gloves, tossed them aside, cheered and held up something for Scorpius to see, “Is introduce you to Wandy McWandface.” Scorpius giggled softly, and Harry pretended to be offended. “What? Don’t you like that name? I named him m’self!”
“The Black Family tapestry,” Draco said with reverence for the family artifact. He watched Pansy come closer with the camera, and as she scanned it, he said, “I’ve heard about its existence from my mother, but I’ve never seen it.”
Give aways, including t-shirts and wibble-wobblehead statues? Got it.
This title comes from
“Been partners with you over a year.” He closes his eyes and continues to saw the rope. “Never knew you to be afraid.”
Draco wondered.
Harry had followed Draco to the second floor. “Oh,” he said, his shoulders slumped. “All the rooms are open.”
The late afternoon sun filtered through the lettering on the windows, and Harry stepped over the shadow words as he finished with the tables and sweeping. He tucked the broom into the kitchen’s utility closet and filled the mop bucket, careful not to add too much cleaner like he usually did.
Harry took Draco’s hand, fingers entwined, and led him into the bathroom. He ran the water for the shower, but it was already hot, ready for them.
I remember. I remember the cold and the fear and the blood. I struggle to sit up, but Weasel gently holds me down. “Harry. Is he—” I don’t think I want the answer.
Potter had the gall to laugh—to laugh so hard that he couldn’t breathe. “Oh, my God, that’s perfect. Blaise? You’ve got to be—wait til Blaise hears you think we were fucking.”
Blaise circled his finger in the air. “C’mon. Film is expensive, and our benefactor wants to see a completed episode before they’ll pay for a full show.”
A gust of cold air blew into the room when Malfoy opened the window. Or maybe that was just the dejection settling into Harry’s heart.
“You were right.” Draco found Harry on the pitch, watching the Cannons file off into their renovated dressing room. “They’re protesting. I reminded them that a forfeit is the same as a loss. I sure as hell hope you have an idea; otherwise, we have to give everyone refunds.”
As if on cue, the Mediwizard pushes open the door, and Harry shuffles through.
And damn the furniture and rugs.
you!”
They walked side by side on the snowy pavement to the small Muggle restaurant Harry chose. The owners had draped evergreen boughs over the large window and the doorway, and fairy lights twinkled along each divider in the glass.
Malfoy buried his face in his hands. From the whimpers, Harry thought he might be crying a little.
Potter cupped Draco’s cheek. His hand was soft and wide, and Draco leaned into his touch. Potter inches closer, bodies not quite pressed together, but so close. With the desk transfigured into a bed, there was no room to move.
“You want to?” Draco laid his hand on Harry’s head and twisted a curl around his finger.
The title of this chapter is from the song,
With a quick
the title is pulled from the Radiohead song, Creep.
Harry didn’t finish reading. He dropped the paper and cradled Draco’s face. There was nothing booty-call or casual about his kiss or Draco’s response.
Harry licked his dry lips to wet them, thought it might look sexual when that wasn’t what he intended. Decided if Draco took it that way, that would be alright, too.
pile teetered and the
It was a terrible joke, and Draco didn’t mind at all.
He needed to call Jason; it was time to end that hot mess. Jason wasn’t right for him, and he certainly wasn’t good for him. And if he allowed himself to be tethered to the wrong person, he might miss the right person when he came along.
He rolled his eyes.
“You know. Good looking. Muscular…” Draco’s words dropped off. He’d made a mess of it now. “Nothing. Forget I said it.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest, almost daring Potter to continue, and Potter seemed almost to agree.
“Potter!” Draco hissed in Harry’s ear. “You can’t do that. You might as well give them away.”
Tonight‘s match was no exception. When Ginny Weasley scored the first goal of the match for the Cannons (only her fifth of the season), fans tossed plush stuffed animals off all shapes and sizes onto the pitch. Some of the plushies thrown were larger than a toddler, while some would fit easily in a toddler’s tiny hand.
Sixten sat down without looking at Harry, but under the table, he squeezed Harry’s thigh in support.
Draco and Harry discuss their plans for the Cannons, and Draco shows Harry a new Quidditch move.
The warmth of another body under the covers, the proximity without actually touching. It was—nice. Draco burrowed under the comforter until only his nose was showing.
Unless you woke up with a camera in your face and your director/producer saying, “Well, well, well. Isn’t that a pretty sight.”
“Good,” Harry said. He moved slowly, like every second counted, like Draco was precious and perfect.
If Draco was here, he’d be rolling on the ground, getting snow in his jacket and hair and down his trousers,  laughing his ass off.
“What do you mean you can’t know?” Malfoy tried to growl, but it just sounded pathetic--whispy and exhausted.
“Scrambled eggs on toast alright with you?” Draco asked and began cracking eggs into the pan.
“Yep!”
The file cabinet drawers were open and folders and papers were strewn all over the floor. The corner cabinet, where Dimplethwait had kept the
This whole day was unreal—Harry had bought a professional Quidditch team, met his arch nemesis for the first time in 10 years, found out they were now business partners, found out he wasn’t actually evil, found out he was actually alright, maybe better than alright, and here he was, running water over the dishes.
“Scorpius and I have walked past here so many times, the Aurors must think we’re going to rob you.”
Smoke drifted up the stairs, followed by a high-pitched, insistent beeping.
“Well, that’s just st—It’s—oh.” Draco sat back and rearranged the silverware in front of him. “I guess I understand how he could think that.”
Harry snickered at the thought of Draco working. He probably meant sit behind the desk and tell Harry what to do.
“I mean, for
No such luck.
Harry dragged his palms down the front of his trousers and then picked up the phone, punching in the numbers more forcefully than necessary. As the phone rang on the other end, Harry was embarrassed to realize that he was hoping it went to voicemail.
Harry thought he heard Draco humming along to the piped-in mix of wizard and Muggle carols, but when he looked over, Draco was silent.
Ginny lurched forward to grab his wrist. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, holding onto him before he could bolt, disappear into the crowd, back to the comfort of Grimmauld Place, to his habits that had worn grooves in his life.
Draco unpacked his basket as he explained to the camera. “I have sage,” he said, holding up a flowerpot filled with a soft grey-green plant. “Frankincense and myrrh, and a small vial of dragon’s blood will help cleanse the spirit of the house. And finally—” Draco lit a candle and the aroma of lavender filled the room. He murmured something before arising and placing the candle on the foyer table.
Potter turned his arse toward Draco and shimmied it over the mattress.
And at least he could text Jason if he got lonely.
Harry relaxed and tried not to sweat. It was the least he could do.
“That’s brilliant,” Harry said and kissed Draco again.
“Hell yeah, I walked out. After the picture of you with your hand down some Muggle bloke’s pants was all over the
Draco scrubbed his face with his hand. He needed more friends or a quieter conscience.
Harry didn’t know. He’d never—he didn’t know how—
Draco lay awake with Harry curled into him and wondered how one of Blaise’s money-making schemes had finally worked out for someone.
“He’s gay? Wait. What does he mean, I’m not his type?” Harry asked no one. “Wait. If I wasn’t poor or in jail, I’d be his type? And what about his robe that's still in Dimplethwait's office??”
Harry stomach plummeted then skidded to a stop at the thought that Malfoy would insist on meeting the baker. And he didn’t want to talk to anyone, and certainly not Malfoy. Even if he were being suspiciously kind and
Draco traced his fingers down Harry’s bare chest. It was grimy with dust and sweat from the day’s hard work, but Draco didn’t care. “You need a shower.”
“Not feeling too good,” he slurs, and I can barely hear him.
“Harry?”
Draco stood in Harry’s lounge, clothes rumpled and his fringe hanging in his eyes. He looked wrong, the opposite of cool and collected that Harry had come to expect.
“Ok, next—”
Harry pushed those feelings down. He was here to do his job, a job that he was frankly brilliant at, and no matter what level of tosser Malfoy was striving for, Harry wasn’t going to rise to the bait this time.
“Oh Harry. Please don’t say you haven’t left yet.” Dylan’s voice was full of disappointment and Harry squirmed at how much it sounded Aunt Petunia’s. “I guess I could meet you there, but I hate to have two cars—”
Apparently, Hermione wasn’t too itchy to flip Draco off. She picked up the phone, read the text, rolled her eyes, and handed it to Draco. “Don’t say it.”
The title is a line from a Tom Waits song called "In Between"
“But—but—no!” Oh for fuck’s sake. He’d gotten this so wrong. “You can’t tell him!”
. All the cases we cleared because of him. That I’m envious of how easily he jumped in to help strangers. That if I could, I’d spend the rest of my life with him.
Draco gathered the letters into a small bundle and, when no one was paying attention, he cast a quick
Fuck it. Fuck everything he knew about staying calm, about making wise choices, using his words instead of his emotions. “Oh no. No you don’t.”
“And just what is my type?”
“You’ve lost money every year for the past 20 years?” Harry asked, trying to keep the disbelief from his voice. He needed to make sure he wasn’t misunderstanding the papers. “How is that possible? It’s—it’s Quidditch!”
From across the market, Granger’s voice pierced the crowd’s happy noise and sent a cold, sharp bolt of fear down Draco’s spine. He stopped, and when she caught up to him, her face was white with fear.
Potter rubbed the back of his neck. He hesitated and then said, “What if the house doesn’t like it?”
Turns out, he’s never ice skated before.
“Umhmmm,” Harry said, turning Dylan toward him. He was pretty sure Dylan Langolin wasn’t the love of his life, but he was fun and he was here. And his rock hard abs were pretty alright.
“Scorpius, this is Dr. Harry.” Malfoy waited as his son looked at Harry, as if he were weighing whether to trust him. “Please answer his questions the best you can."
Draco shook his head. “Do you really not get it? He’s the famous Sixten Lundberg, saviour of Quidditch. You’re—you. The Great Harry Potter.  And I’m a Malfoy.”
Where was Malfoy? Harry scanned the chamber several times before barely noticing him standing, his shoulders flat against the back wall.
Scorpius nodded, and Harry held up the first instrument. “This is an--well, never mind the fancy name. This will let me look in your ears and at your throat. There’s a little light. See?”
Harry couldn’t argue with that. He’d given tickets to the Weasleys and their families. Every Quidditch writer he’d heard of and some that he’d never heard of and doubted were actually reporters. Every player was comped tickets for their extended families, which didn’t amount for much since they knew how bad the Cannons were.
as if it were an indictment of the old men.
But he
“We?” Harry teased. “I had no idea you were that kind of Cannons fan.”
which you may recognize from The Sopranos. lol
The couple at the next table gathered their shopping bags, and as the woman turned, her oversized purse slapped Draco flat in his face. Harry snorted, and with an
“Mother knows best,” she said to Draco with a tiny kiss on his cheek. “And yes, let’s do the Manor second. I have some ideas I’d like to try.”
Harry sat on the edge of the couch, staring at his phone on the glass coffee table. He needed to call Dylan and let him know he was quarantined. That he wouldn’t be home for at least a week. That there was a good chance he wouldn’t be home for Christmas.

“Of course I can,” Scorpius said, sounding like a Malfoy in miniature. “I’m not a baby. Red means stop, green go. Yellow means--” his voice wobbled as he said, “I’m scared.”
Draco and Harry squeezed into the Confessional closet.
“Where’s my counterpart?” Draco looked over his shoulder, around the wrought-iron enclosed square and to the terrace homes. “I know this street!” He grinned as he realized where they were. “My mother brought me here when I was little. To see my grand aunt. She lived right—”
Dylan’s voice dripped with frigid sarcasm. “I’m shocked. Absofuckinglutely shocked. Why? What is it now?”
“Merlin, no! Dogs can’t eat that.”

spell. “Shit. We’re late.”
“What? I didn’t—I—”
Dinner with with Draco... with a side of banter.
He didn’t like it, the way it felt like loss and emptiness.
We’ve been partners for a year; I’ve seen the abuse he takes. And he doesn’t deserve it, because (and it kills me to admit it) nobody trains harder than Potter. When the instructor introduces a new spell, Potter’s practicing long after everyone else is showered and gone. Except for me. He’s been my partner for the past year, and I work with him until we’re both drenched, our clothes sweat-glued to our backs and arses. It’s a good look for him, but I’ll never tell him that. Probably.
Dimplethwait’s office was most definitely not cleared out.
“My father raised me to hate you. He called you a filthy Mudblood, and the few times he was forced to say your name, he looked like would literally vomit. But I never figured out why I was supposed to hate you, because all the stories I’d ever heard were brilliant. How you defeated the most powerful Wizard ever when you were just a baby. And everyone was always so happy when they talked about you.”
“We have a meeting at the International Quidditch Association in 15 minutes,” Draco interrupted. “They’re saying our indoor stadium violates league rules. Get some clothes on.”
Harry’s face flushed, because he couldn’t lie fast enough. “You’ve got a smudge right—” He swiped his thumb to remove the dirt in the notch between his collarbones. Draco’s skin was soft, and Harry wanted. Merlin, he
He reached his hand out to touch the curve of Harry’s cheekbone with his thumb to see if his skin were as soft as it seemed. But the risk—was it worth it?
He cracked open the door to peek out, and there stood Potter.
Harry couldn’t process any of it. Not Malfoy, not his words.
If Draco realized what he’d said, he gave no notice, and Harry didn’t draw his attention to it. Maybe the next time he did something brilliant, Draco would say it again.
“Are these the kids from Woking who fucked around and got cable to work in magical houses? Spliced their Muggle neighbors’ connections outside the houses and ran it into theirs?”
“I know what it is,” Draco said, his voice raspy.
“Told you so.”
Malfoy waved Harry off. “That’s Sixten’s owl. It’s probably the contract.”
“—who wants to play when it’s too hot—”
“Was he looking for buried treasure?” Harry asked, not sure whether he was joking. “Did he have something hidden?”
He felt manic, like he couldn’t stop himself from being an asshole. Why was he being like this?
“Oh, I can be a good boy, Potter,” Malfoy preened, and then it seemed to dawn on him what he’d said. His face flamed with embarrassment, and he stuttered trying to back track what he’d said. “I mean, I deserve the numbing spell.”
Harry wondered as grabbed his doctor bag and returned to the living room.
They side-along apparated into an alley in Islington, and Harry enjoyed the warm press of Draco’s arm linked in his. When they landed, he wanted to hold on, not let Draco pull his arm away, but he couldn’t think of a way or a reason that made sense.
know no offense doesn’t actually excuse the offense, right?”
I nod, because sweet Salazar Slytherin, I don’t want anything more than that.
at work.” He used air quotes for this new event. “They fed us terrible sandwiches and wanted us to listen while they went on and on and on about their new wands.”
going to renovate. That hideous neon orange is going.”
Harry smiled and drifted off to sleep for a moment. When his eyes fluttered open again, Draco said, “You are my type. But when you’re healthy, we really are going to talk work confidentiality and our relationship.”
“I guess I’ll um, clear the plates,” Draco said because he didn’t know what else to say, and gathered the plates like a Muggle.
want her to know he’d fallen asleep on the old, lumpy couch at 8 last night and hadn’t woken up til that morning. The eggs and porridge lay heavy in his stomach, or maybe it was the weight of Ginny’s words settling in.
“Pay up, Blaise.” Narcissa held out her hand and pointed to her empty palm. “You said you were good for it.”
Ginny watched him leave and said to the empty bakery, “You can stop hiding now.”
“We’re totally committed to being part of the Chudley community,” Potter added. “On Monday—Christmas Eve—we’re opening the stadium to the community. The Cannons organization is hosting dinner for those who are homeless or may have no one to share the holiday with. Our players and their significant others will be serving food and thanking people for their kind welcome. The stadium facilities will be decorated for Christmas and will also be open through Christmas night for showers and or somewhere warm to sleep.”
Harry heard him, almost waited for it each day. Malfoy’s tone was softer than it had been at Hogwarts, rounded and curious where it once had been sharp and curt. Like someone Harry might chat up at the pub, buy a pint for and enjoy watching as he spoke.
“Hogsmeade?” Draco sputtered. “You made a colossal secret of going to Hogsmeade?”
But Harry knew he’d overstepped their tentative, new friendship. More like squashed it, he was pretty sure. He felt shaky and embarrassed. That was why he had routines; with routines, it didn’t matter if he didn’t think before he acted. “Sorry.”
“How’s the Baker?” he asked each time; Ginny wouldn’t offer more than a strangled
Before Harry finished the sentence, Draco was straddling his legs and pressing his chest against Harry’s. “We need to change things up. The Beaters need to get up in the other team’s space like this,” he said, his voice wavering. “Just because it used to be one way, doesn’t mean that it can’t be different now.”
“It doesn’t
And he didn’t need to date. His life was already rich and full. He went shopping for antiques for his home. He took long walks in the Physic Gardens where he may or may not steal leaves for his tiny Potions lab in the cellar. He visited the Chelsea Library. The lovely owner of Rococo Chocolates knew him by name and always slipped a few extra pieces into Draco’s bag—along with his phone number one time.
piles.
“…perfect fit…not degreed, mind you…just a real sense for landscaping.”
Dammit.
Draco grasped his hand tighter as they passed through. “Wasn’t sure it would let me in.”
Draco bit his lip, and to Harry, it seemed like he was almost afraid of the answer.
When Malfoy looked up from his hands, his eyes were wild, like he had an idea he didn’t quite like. “Dimplethwait, I’ll finalize the details and send a contract by owl, no later than tomorrow.”
Kreacher was unimpressed with Harry’s impersonation, with the squeaky yet still graveled voice, and turned back to the stove. Harry was fairly certain Kreacher called him a worm, a miscreant, a Magdalen, and a dandiprat, which had to be record for the number of slurs he’d jammed into one sentence.
“You’re right. It’s not fair. I should be back from this patient around noon. We’ll grab some clothes, find a nice hotel with a heated pool somewhere over by the beach. Just us and the seagulls. Okay?”
“Doctor Harry! You’re The Boy Who Lived! You saved everyone! You saved my Papa, and my Grand-mère and my Grande-père!”
“Auror, remember?” He’s smiling, but it’s tight, and when he blinks, it’s for a second too long. I’m assuming he caught the knife by the blade or worse, point first. “Trained to notice details.”
A teeny owl, tiny like the one Sirius gave Ron that year, is perched on my windowsill when I get home from Malfoy’s.
“Potter, don’t be an idiot. These are all things I said to myself. But Scorpius has been telling me about this trip they’re planning. It’s supposed to be a secret, but he’s 7. He can’t keep a secret. Like how all their things are being moved into storage. What else am I supposed to think besides them doing a runner?”
“Do you like it?” I ask.
Turns out, I shouldn't have laughed.
“Nice.”
Draco’s voice drifted into the hallway, and Harry’s stomach dropped. This was supposed to be a working afternoon, not a sit and argue afternoon.
boyfriend, stretching until his shirt buttons strained against the pull, Harry’s eyes would be all over that.
Draco ordered a shot of Talisker, downed it before he left the line, and ordered another.
“She always seemed to be such a nice old lady.” Draco shook his head. “Where did I go wrong raising her?”
Malfoy gasped. “Christ, Potter. Don’t be a dick.”
“Speaking of,” Blaise said. “He’s right on time. C’mon. Let me reintroduce you.”
Draco breathed in sharply, breaking through Harry’s fog. “I’m sorry,” he said, pulling his hand back quickly. “I shouldn’t have done that.”
Draco forced himself not to check his office every hour for an owl carrying some kind of explanation. Once his shift began, that wasn’t an issue. Hermione taught him the Scabies Spell and the two of them performed it over and over until each person in the hospital had been cured.
Harry raised an eyebrow, trying to ask what he was going to encounter, but Ginny smiled and shook her head. He followed Jasmine into Mr. Dimplethwait’s office wondering how in Merlin’s name he was going to not sweat in this sauna.
listen to him even if it didn’t listen to Draco.
Too many people talk at once, and I only catch a few words.
even though I’m almost impressed.
“Potter, don’t be ridiculous. I haven’t played—”
I coulda gotten a “blowie” out of this.
Harry shoved the stethoscope back into the bag, spilling the Tincture of Firefly all over the other bottles. “Fuck fuck dammit fuck. That’s--aagh, that took me months to infuse.” He pulled his wand from his ankle holster and siphoned off the excess liquid.
Malfoy had apparently continued talking as Harry thought about the nature of hair product. “But thank Merlin we had the old timers there and almost no one actually had a paid admission. Do you know why, Potter. Do you?”
Draco shook it off, and motioned for the camera to follow him into the next room. He kept up a running commentary of his observations.
Hermione flung open his office door. “I found the cure for the scabies!”
Wait til I tell Malfoy.
Harry thrust his phone into his trouser pocket. “I’m sorry. I should have stepped outside to make that call.”
Potter sat down, dragged something from his robe, and showed Draco. “Look. This is SpongeBob. The kids wanted to do this—”
Harry rolled his eyes, sighed dramatically and helped Kreacher stand up.  “This is my house. Sirius left it to me. We’ve been over this a thousand times.”
Malfoy was silent for a few minutes, and Harry just drank his tea.
Sweet, quirky granddad was gone, replaced by the sharp businessman who’d been camouflaged, hiding beneath, ready to sting. Dimplethwait may consider orchids his passion, but Harry had no doubt his real passion was money. Acquiring it. Hoarding it. And yes, spending it on growing orchids.
But the worst offense was the temperature. Harry zipped his jacket the rest of the way and shoved his hands into the pockets. It had to be easily 10-15 degrees colder than it should be, if not for the players then to keep the equipment useable. Brooms at this temperature would be nasty and unresponsive, and the players would spend more time forcing them to move faster than actually playing Quidditch.
The chapter title comes from the Foreigner song,
Draco is quarantined and decides to do the mature adult thing and write Potter about his feelings.
Harry sighed and looked out across the lake that lay next to their flat. Their apartment complex. Whatever. Barely 10 am on December 18th and it was already close to 30 degrees. 86 degrees. It really shouldn’t be this hot in December. Christmas just never felt right without a cold nose and one lost mitten.
“I’ll need two dozen cupcakes, vanilla with cinnamon chips,” Malfoy began, ticking requirements off on his fingers. “Cinnamon. Not chocolate. You might wish to write this down.”
“Harry is the horticulturalist of the two of us. He said the Manor’s holly trees will transplant easily—”
thanks for following along! and I love your comments!
“You bought birthday cupcakes for your dog.”
one.”
“No,” Potter said in a way that completely sounded like
Harry may have peeked at Malfoy as he ate, watched him catch the last chunk of chicken and thick noodle. Frown because the toast was gone. Merlin help him—he needed to stop gawking at Malfoy, because he wasn’t beautiful when he laughed or kind when he asked after all the Weasleys. He was Harry’s partner, and they needed to keep a professional relationship. Yes.
Also, I didn't forget the scabies. I just conveniently paused them.
Harry walked Blaise and Pansy to the door, whispering furiously about something. Draco didn’t care what it was. To get his typical excellent results, he needed to commune with the house. To commune, he needed to spend as much time as possible inside it, which meant that he needed to stay there during the renovation. It wasn’t his fault if there were only two habitable rooms in the entire house: the kitchen and the one bedroom upstairs.
The word didn’t begin to cover all the things Draco was to Harry. Friend, yes. But his business partner, sounding board, cheerleader, confidant. Lover. Harry hoped with his heart that he was all the same to Draco.
They clean and scrub, bin things that are unsalvageable, but the feeling never leaves the room.
Harry backed through the swinging door, pulling the rolling mop bucket behind him.
“I told you. I’m quarantined for at least a week—”
Draco returned with just Granger and Weasley, leaving the bulk of the Weasleys in the waiting room. They all looked disheveled with a vague funk that a cleansing spell didn’t quite remove.
“Oh, definitely with me.”
“Alright,” Harry said, smiling brighter when Malfoy sniffed with disgust as he entered the sitting room.
He took a breath and turned to Harry, who looked drop-jawed. “We have our work cut out for us.”
Harry nodded and tucked into his own serving.
“This and that.” Harry smiled sun-bright and carefree, as if Draco and he weren’t mortal enemies. Well, not mortal enemies, because that’s for fairy tales.
The Pride of Portree went the way of the Appleby Arrows and the Caerphilly Catapults, leaving the Cannons with a record of 3-0. The owner of The Pride made it clear in colorful language what he thought of the Cannons, the new owners, and their stadium.
“Ignore it,” Dylan whispered into Harry’s neck as he tugged at the pajama pants.
“Potter, why are we fighting over what kind of father I am? I don’t even have a child—”
politely?
Harry didn’t actually hate Sixten. He knew that when Sixten’s attention focused on him, he felt empowered, like he could do anything. Harry’d never met anyone with charisma like that; he wondered how each committee member felt as Sixten paused to allow his words to register before beginning again.
“The orange t-shirts make it pretty noticeable,” Harry agreed. “I think you’re right.” And that didn’t include the kids roaming the food court and merchandise areas.
“Shockingly enough, I do,” Draco said with a laugh. “Tell me it’s not your only one. That we haven’t used up your monthly quota of good ideas.”
Harry couldn’t talk though his own laughter. He nodded and gulped in breaths until he was able to speak. “I can’t repeat the things he said when I moved in.”
Special to the Wizard Sporting News
When a giant splinter lodged in Harry’s finger, and he spewed a lot of curses that couldn’t be shown pre-watershed, Draco rolled his eyes at the camera. “He forgets he’s a wizard sometimes. It’s a bit adorable.”
“Let’s meet at 9 tomorrow morning. Wear something that looks good,” Blaise added as he headed out the front door.
ps: don't worry. I only write happy fics.
Draco smiled tentatively, tried it on to see how it would feel. He’d been so angry at Potter for so long—for being the hero, for having everything handed to him, for not having to work—for having the life Draco should have had.
Aw, fuck. He hadn’t wanted Potter to see him with his glasses on, so he hadn’t removed the contact lens spell. But now his wand was in the loo, and his eyes felt like sandpaper. He could get up or he could—
At the end of lunch, Potter insisted Draco take the SpongeBob thing home. He’d dropped it on the extra chair in his office and there it sat.
Actually, Harry thought with a grin, Malfoy almost sounded amused.
The re-design of the interior flew by, and Draco knew it was courtesy of the house. It had locked doors, slapped them with loose floorboards, turned the third-floor stairs into a slide. If it hadn’t wanted to change, it wouldn’t have.
and check it out.
Harry held up the concession stands’ total sales and grinned.
Ginny eked out a sound, which Harry translated as her trying not to slap Malfoy. “Yes. Yes, they are.”
Harry’s voice had been steady and polite, kind but with steel underneath his words. Coach nodded. “Yeah, I—uh—understand. Of course, yeah.”
How could he spend less? This went beyond cost savings. This was dangerous for the fans, for the staff, and absolutely for the athletes. “How much?”
“Can’t. The Weasleys are all the family I have.” He cuts me off sharp and quick. As if he’s trying to make up for it, he says, “Thanks for saying we should sit up. I was having trouble angling the knife, but I’m hitting the rope right now.”
He felt the familiar pull of apparation twisting him into nothing until he landed softly in front of Bungalow 12. It was just like Disney to call these mini-mansions 'bungalows.' No car, so not a Floridian or something almost local.
“Well, it’s on me, then,” Harry said. Maybe if he pretended they’d never argued, Draco would go along with it. He stood up and pulled Draco to his feet. “I know a nice place near a skating rink. The food is good, but the service is slow. It will give me plenty of time to tell you my next idea.”
Draco swallowed back his pain and strode up to Sohrob. He patted Sohrob’s shoulder as they shook hands, and Draco slid it down to the upper arm. He left it there a beat or two longer and said, “Let’s get something to drink?”
“Have a good night, Draco?” Blaise asked with a smirk. “You work pretty damn fast.”
“Fuck Potter. Let’s get out of here,” Draco said, his voice ragged from the whiskey. “We can go to my office. “I’ll transfigure the desk.”
Ginny, ever so kindly, explains to Harry why he needs to shake his life up. And by KINDLY, read: blunt, in the way that only exes or siblings are.
The moment was thick between them, weighed heavy with their past and this present.
One of the two.
“I have a brilliant idea! The Manor should be next. We can eliminate the Dark Magic, and renovate it, and let’s face it. Everyone would watch to see where He Who Shall Not Be Named had lived for a year.”
“Auror Davis, 27 year old black male, took a direct hit to his right thigh—”
“I met some blokes who were into baseball. They were living in this mobile home and going around the country seeing as many games as they could. By the end, I knew as much about baseball as they did. A few of them switched to ice hockey, and I stayed.”
the dust.
Harry stepped into the shower and put his hand out for Draco. They stood under the hot spray, let it pound against their sore muscles until some of the ache melted away.
Harry turned to Draco and pinned him in place with a death stare. “Plus, it’s our t-shirt giveaway,” he said to McGonagall.
Christ, Potter’s huge dick was obvious underneath the towel, and it was at mouth level. Draco swallowed hard. He didn’t even like Potter, who was—uh—what had he told Blaise? He was having trouble remembering the words he’d used. Entitled and, um, something. His eyes watched rivulets of water trail down Harry’s chest, eventually disappearing into the towel.
he reminded himself. He didn’t have to accept her words or her mean spirited teasing any more.
“White buttercream icing, but instead of frosting them individually, frost them so that they take the appearance of a rectangle cake.”
Malfoy took Harry’s phone from his hand and inspected the lock screen photo of Harry and Dylan posing in front of the Castle in Disney World. The park had been overflowing with sweaty adults, over-exhausted crying babies, and these monstrous body puppets who zoned in on him as if they could tell he wanted none of it.
Draco dropped his vest and looked at Harry quizzically.
“Uh—” Blaise stuttered. “I may have mentioned it to her when I was visiting. Like a good son does. You should try it.”
“Tyler. Call me Tyler. Pleasure to meet you.”
Harry slid Draco’s slippers from his bare feet. Unzipped his trousers, and Draco’s cock jerked when Harry dragged his fingers across it.
Harry laughed, remembering his headache from the orange building. They hammered out other changes to the stadium and the training facility, including an immediate upgrade of the dressing rooms.
Malfoy placed his spoon inside the empty bowl. “I was thinking. Since we’re partners, you should probably call me Draco.”
“Thanks for coming, Chad.”
“No. I need you never to use that word again.
Figured we didn’t have much of a future after that.”
“There had to be another way besides hurting yourself! You’re a fucking idiot.”
Harry snorted at that as he snapped the bag shut. The snick of the lock catch almost echoed in the silence.
But today? Harry sensed that Muggle instruments would crawl up under Malfoy’s skin and fester, the thought of which made Harry smirk.
“You hate the clothes I wear. You say they’re rags and—” Harry shivered as Draco skated his fingers up and down Harry’s back, more nail than tip. It felt fucking brilliant, didn’t want him to stop—
He may have said something else as Harry disapparated back to the safety of Grimmauld Place, but Harry didn’t wait long enough to find out.
Malfoy was being a professional, helping Dimplethwait get the best deal. And now, sitting with Harry in his kitchen, Malfoy was working with his business partner to make their venture as lucrative as possible.
Potter.
He didn’t let the person on the other end of the phone speak; Malfoy just launched into a tirade. “I paid your frankly outrageous fees because I’d been assured that no riff-raff, no vagrants would harass us--Only to find one right on my doorstep.”
“I’ll walk you to the door.” He trailed Harry to the front door and opened it for him.
Malfoy looked.
“Today’s our last day of filming,” Harry added. “We’re done here, but since the weather is nice, we’re going over to Malfoy Manor to take a few cuttings from the garden to transplant here.”
It reached critical phase the day Potter
He stops for a moment and looks at me; the bright green eyes are glassy and dim, but he holds my gaze like he’s hoping my eyes will give up all my secrets. “Have you asked him out?”
“You first,” Potter said, his forehead lined with concern.
The clock chimed 8:30. That was a perfectly normal time for an adult to go to bed, wasn’t it? Besides, his shift tomorrow started at 7 am. He went through his night routine by rote, washing his plate and fork. Vanishing the trash. Extinguishing the fire. Setting the wards.
But he talked again about finding me someone. I’m being stupid, thinking he’s into me. So when the tiny owl’s parchment is from a guy who just wants some fun, to do something cool, I owled him back. Sure, why not. I have nothing better to do.
Draco rolled his eyes at himself.
“What the hell is a blowie?”
They disapparated to the A&E, and Hermione slipped on a pool of blood. She went down and scrambled back up as quickly as she could, wincing with pain. “Tell me about the injury?” she demanded as they trailed the nurse to the curtained off area.
Because the fest was actually over on 12/25, I'm going to use the last two pic prompts today.  They are
Draco shrugged and walked past Potter and out the door.
“If we work together, I think we can be pretty great.” Then Harry stopped shaking Coach’s hand but held it in place as he stared into Coach’s eyes. “I want to be fair, too. If you ever say anything like that again about Mr. Malfoy, your contract will be immediately terminated, and I will make damn sure you don’t coach again.”
After Potter left, Draco took a moment to close his eyes and replay what Potter had said.
With his splintery finger, Harry flipped off Draco.
He didn’t. He really didn’t.
“Maybe we can drive to the beach, and you can teach me to surf. You’ve wanted to teach me for months.”
“I think I would know,” Malfoy huffed. “It’s just me and Scorpius. He’s like my child.” Malfoy buried his face in dog’s fur.
omg, you guys, I'm so sorry. My computer DIED yesterday, like, funeral march dead. So I had to get a new one, and I'm very thankful I was in a position to do that.
“You’ve never invited me,” Harry answered with a smirk.
It took the entire shift to de-scabie every person at Saint Mungo’s. Draco dragged himself home, thinking only of a hot bath and a warm bed. And hoping Potter was a frozen lump on his doorstep. It would serve him right for what he did.
“Fuck you, Zabini! I always wear something that looks good.”
White Kitchen Pizza was tucked away in a market in Camden, just large enough that they could take up a table for an hour and not feel too bad. It was Potter’s favorite Muggle restaurant, and he always paid the bill so Draco wouldn’t have to deal with the confusing Muggle money.
“Stop apologizing for the short notice,” Beatrix said as she settled in her oversized arm chair. She pulled her legs up under her and balanced Harry’s folder on the arm of the chair. “Saturdays are for wizards and paperwork, and I’m always happy to put off paperwork! What’s up?”
“I didn’t invite you this time,” Draco smirked back but led Potter to the lounge. With a flick of his wand, the fire roared, warming the room.
“That was a delightful surprise,” Draco said, rolling his eyes for the benefit of the show, and Harry laughed.
Puck rolled onto her back, showed Harry her belly, and then clawed him when he tried to rub her stomach. “You could have just said you didn’t want to help,” Harry complained as he rummaged through the cabinets for the last of his Dittany.
people say. I don’t know about you, but I thank Merlin each morning, as magic lights my warm flat, not with open flames but with modified lamp bulbs. That my breakfast cooks on a converted hob and not over the fireplace. And that, if I’m asked to join a team up in the Scottish Highlands, I can use a portkey instead of a long, frigid ride on a broom or carpet.
Oh, and there was the 100-watt smile. Perfect teeth, bright white. How the hell did a Quidditch Beater have such nice teeth. That was a spell
Sixten shook his head. “Can’t. Sanna’s sick. I told her I’d only be gone a few hours.” He shrugged and said, “Hopefully Linnea took her nap today. If I hear something, I’ll be in touch.”
“They’re brilliant, especially the one of Ron.” Potter laughs, but stops as fast as he started, as if it hurts to laugh. “Don’t tell him I said that. He’d kill me.”
He wasn’t flirting and apparating a bloke back to Grimmauld Place. Wanting everything and willing to beg for it.
himself and didn’t yell. He did, however, knock really loudly.
Draco groaned in approval. “Don’t stop. Please.”
Harry grinned like he was made of happiness. “We better go. No one keeps Molly Weasley waiting. At least, not more than once.”
And didn’t feel wistful at all.
“Malfoy.”
“I didn’t--”
“Excellent pun, my boy! Once, when I was in the Amazon,” Mr. Dimplethwait sat back behind his desk, and with a hearty laugh, he was off, telling story after story, discussing his procurement of rare bulbs, his newest growing techniques, and eventually ending with his belief that the Cannons should be renamed the Moth Orchids and be outfitted in uniforms that were, well, orchid.
Harry closed the front door and tried to pull himself back to the present. He had a job to do, and once he completed these Covid tests, he could get some sleep.
Before Draco could say anything, Potter said very evenly and evilly, “Get that fucking camera out of our faces, and I swear to Christ that if you ever do this again, we’ll quit the show, and laugh at the money you’ll lose.”
“I didn’t feel any magic—”
Potter stared at Draco with one raised eyebrow until he understood. “He called it a blowie? What was he? Twelve?” Draco’s laughter threatened to overflow again, but he swallowed it back.
Harry nodded, then said, “Did you feel that? It was like a shift in the atmosphere. It feels—lighter in here. Less—oppressive.”
“Up? That’s higher than last week and last week was—”
Harry stood next to Draco’s desk, tapping his foot as if that would make Draco add faster. He held the ledger with the total receipts for food and merch.
Draco sat on the floor, cross-legged. Thank Merlin he’d worn jeans today instead of his tailored trousers. He surreptitiously swept a finger across the floor and then shuddered. Maybe the house would have liked Potter more if he’d cleaned once in a while.
And they haven’t. The fan promotions, the stadium renovations, the players’ contracts. They’re all adding up to a brilliant season for the Chudley Cannons.
Draco stirred slowly at the disembodied voice in his room until he remembered where he was; he bolted upright and began dressing as quickly as possible. “Yes, what is it? I’m here.”
It didn’t sound like an insult, but Harry wasn’t sure, and to be honest, didn’t quite know what to do with Malfoy when he wasn’t snapping at him.
Well, it made sense when
Harry moved the turkey platter and the bowl of mixed nuts to lay his hand, palm up, in front of Draco. “You did, too.”
“Yeah, I’m—uh—Harry, yeah.” I smile as genuinely as I can considering I’m not sure why I’m here, except that Malfoy seemed to think Chad was worthwhile, and Malfoy had smiled, and then I just wanted to make him happy.
Draco shrugged as he shook his head. “I have no idea. But instead of cleaning this with spells, we’re going to have to do it the Muggle way, because I don’t know what any of this is. And so I can’t say whether it’s important or not. Might as well get ready to work.”
Harry smoothed his hand down his dusty, sweat-stained, formerly white vest. “Use your own shirt!”
piped on in red. “The reviews said I wouldn’t be disappointed. I was skeptical, but I can admit I was wrong.“
“You’re paying me to do my job. Now let me do it.”
“It’s spaghetti sauce!” Potter said brightly. “It’s no big deal, just a few tins of tomatoes and paste and diced—”
“And you’ll do—” What exactly could Potter bring to complement Draco’s architecture and design background?
to go.”
Harry’s face flushed, and he mumbled an apology, but Sixten waved it off. “Nothing I haven’t heard before,” he said with a laugh. “But not a cover boy. Draco asked me to meet with you both to look over the contract.”
Draco thought before he could stop himself from staring at the lines of his abs.
“Thank Merlin we—”
A hand rubbed his back, warm and caring, and Harry assumed it was Sixten, but when he raised his head, he saw Sixten in front of him, his arms filled with parchments.
“Yeah, right,” Harry said under his breath and opened the envelope. His eyebrows rose higher and higher as he scanned the numbers.
“Just—get inside so we can start.”
Draco hesitated, but slid his hand on top of Harry’s. “I didn’t—”
Harry reached both arms around Draco, bracketed him, and squeezed the toy. The nose wiggled and played flute music, but Draco only felt the muscles ripple in Potter’s upper arms, smelled his terrible aftershave which smelled like part locker room soap and part suntan lotion. Draco took another breath of it before asking, “Do you mind, Potter?”
Malfoy laughed, not a polite chuckle but a long, loud belly laugh until he couldn’t breathe. “Swedish fish aren’t—oh my god—lutefisk. That stuff is so—”
“We’re done? I haven’t even done anything yet?”
He sat at his kitchen table (ignoring that Draco had sat in
Draco snatched the notice from the floor. “We can owl this to Sixten when we get there, so he knows.”
“So don’t come by until you hear from me,” Draco texted Harry on Hermione’s phone. “We’re quarantined until we can contain it.”
A sharp elbow in his ribs brought Harry back.
“Ohhhh, that sounds promising.” With his foot, Draco nudged a chair away from the table. “Sit. Talk.”
Fucking Merlin, it was Potter last night at the other end bar. Draco choked on air and quickly coughed to cover his embarrassment. As much as he was loath to admit it, he had noticed the man was a bit fit.
Although he's dead on his feet, Draco is too worried about his son to even sleep.
But he’d thought it had been more than a hook up. He’d thought—
“No, Mother—Harry and I—we enjoyed working together and decided to try living together.”
“I’m not stupid Potter. I have some contacts in the Aurors. They’re looking into his history. I fully believe they’ll find at least abuse. He’s a bully and probably a criminal, and Astoria is under his spell—probably figuratively, but there’s always the chance it is a spell of some sort. There’s a reason I have full-time custody.”
the glass shards on the floor will knit themselves together in the frame, and believe me, I’m thoughtful and precise in my mind.
Harry grinned. “Don’t be an idiot. C’mon!” He grabbed Draco’s wrist and dragged him up High Street, still not telling him where they were going.
At that moment, Malfoy stood up and looked around; he smiled broadly when he saw Harry and waved him over to the corner table. “Glad you came,” Malfoy said, extending his hand.
Draco was silent, but judging by the worry lines on his forehead, Harry suspected Draco was confused? upset? concerned? by Molly’s invitation. Harry stood up, and as he transfigured bowls into ziplock plastic bags, he casually mentioned, “You don’t
Malfoy cracked one eyelid and said, “Fuck you, Potter.” But there was no heat behind it.
Harry thought Malfoy might be grinning, but he was sun-blind and couldn’t be sure. No way he was going to shield his eyes or show any weakness. He wouldn’t give Malfoy that satisfaction. If only he’d brought his sunglasses.
“Are you telling me Weasley has enough dexterity to spell and type at the same time? I don’t believe it.”
“The last time you said that, our office was full of bobbleheads.”
For Harry, there was something about Draco’s eyes in the haloed lamplight, the snow flakes and the laughter still lingering at his lips…
“Ten years and three days.” Harry guided Draco’s hand to his cheek. “I’ve known you since I was eleven. That’s a long time—long enough to know—”
Until today.
Harry headed toward the admin building. With his wand, he tapped the door to unlock it and relocked it as he closed it behind him. The extension charm on the stadium was his favorite of all the renovations, except for this foyer. He and Draco had teamed up with every scrubbing charm they knew; they’d removed every trace of orchids and scoured the floors and walls until they gleamed. Draco had eyed the Christmas tree, decided it wasn’t elegant enough, and transformed it until it grazed the ceiling. They’d hung fairy lights along the edge of the reception desk, draped them over the tree boughs, and in a rare display of Cannon pride, Draco had transfigured all the red sequined heart ornaments into cannons.
Draco shook his head, his mouth shut into a hard, straight line.
Zabini’s cologne overwhelmed Harry, and he held himself back with every bit of emotional strength he had; otherwise, he would have punched Zabini, laid him out cold. There’d been no mistaking the scent. He’d smelled it on Ginny’s neck before she’d pulled away instead of kissing him. On her hair when he’d tried to hold her.
“We have a lot of new ideas,” Potter said with a wide grin. “We don’t care what they think. Pretty soon, they’ll be copying our business model.”
“No. We met 10 years and four days ago,” Draco said, reminding Harry what he had said the night before. “Long enough to know.”
“I don’t know why he didn’t stay,” Harry said, knowing he sounded like a love-sick teenager.
Hopefully, not Malfoy Manor.
“I may be insane, but at least I didn’t go out with a bloke named Chad.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and said, “I need you never to do that. Ever again.”
The time between Harry’s blinks was getting longer until Draco thought he’d fallen asleep. He pushed his chair back quietly from the bedside and stood up to leave for the first time in a week.
Hermione convinces Draco go to the annual staff Christmas Party.
“What? I didn’t—I hadn’t heard—” Hermione opened each chart quickly verifying their towns. “Oh my God,” Hermione dropped her head into her hands. “These kids probably watched SpongeBob and—”
“I truly didn’t look. That would be a shit thing for your new partner to do.” Malfoy wrapped his fingers around Harry’s wrist to grab Harry’s attention from the parchment.
Draco wanted to poke Harry for his use of the word oppressive, but the thing was, he was right. Suddenly, the house did feel less depressing. He jumped up from the kitchen table and sprinted up the stairs. The main floor had more light streaming in, but that could have been from the renovation. The test would be the second and third floors.
Until he was where he knew he should be.
“Fuck. You’re a fucking groupie,” I say peeling John’s fingers off me. “I should have checked you out instead of just saying yes.”
Did the players mind the disruption tonight?
Potter stole Draco’s mug and took a long swig of the tepid tea. “Ugh, how can you drink it with all that sugar in it.”
“A Muggle contraption, Potter? Really?” Malfoy sat on the loveseat across the room from Harry. With the curtains open, morning sun streamed through the oversized double window, directly into Harry’s eyes.
“Oh, I always look good.” And he winked at Blaise.
“Oh, Christ,” Harry said, looking over Draco’s shoulder. The room was—
“I can be a right bastard. Besides, what we do in private should be just that.” Potter rolled over and got out of bed, grumbling about
Go to a Cannons match these days, and you don’t know what you’ll see next.
Hidden in the kitchen, Harry watched Malfoy almost-sneer, the same one that appeared regularly in his dreams even after two years. Some of the dreams left him confused and breathless, but that was a different story.
because he thought it was funny to see Potter so upset.
“C’mon, Dylan. That’s not fair. You knew my job from the start. Part of being a concierge doctor means I have to stop what I’m doing—"
Draco picked at his dinner, which was easier than looking at Potter’s stupid scar or his stupid hair.
He thought about that as he apparated home to pack a bag. He debated bringing some of his Muggle electronics, but Grimmauld Place had such ancient magic imbued in it, he’d probably never get them to work.
“That was brilliant,” he said, gasping for breath. “I forgot was an utter arse he was.”
his conscience poked.
“So many.” Potter sat up and threw his head back in anguish, and Draco yanked his files away from him. “They wouldn’t go away. Eventually, I started taking the letters from them. Then I’d go back to bed. Then
thank you for following this and for sharing it if you like it!
Draco sighed and said the only thing he could come up with. “Green Eggs and Ham. It’s a book my nanny used to read to me.”
“Master Draco!”
“And across the top, one letter per cupcake, I want it to say—Shall I write it down for you?”
“I haven’t had dinner. Have you had dinner?” Draco interrupted and headed to the kitchen. He heard a mumbled “what the fuck,” but he didn’t hesitate. He marched into the kitchen and pulled the egg carton and cheddar cheese from the refrigerator, put them on the counter, found the frying pan he was looking for and put them on the counter, hunted for the loaf of bread before finding it in the pantry next to the cereal, and put that on the counter.
Harry vanished the mop and bucket, opting for a floor cleaning spell instead. He tucked the cash drawer into their office safe. On his way back, he stopped at the display case and boxed up cookies and a few cupcakes. “I’ll put in a few extra for Scorpius.”
And he was fucking
“I want this,” Draco said breathlessly. “I want this so much, but I don’t want to be interrupted by Blaise and Pansy. I want to take our time.”
“I’m sure she will do fine,” Arthur said, picking up the turkey leg that Draco had put down. “Maybe next year, it can be at their—”
“You fucking had a plan.”
“I like you, too, Potter.”
“He is a nice guy,” Harry agreed and waved his hand toward Malfoy’s face.
Harry nodded. He’d been stressing about when he was going to be able to get that done.
Draco snickered. He gave up trying to eat his salad, because he would surely choke.
This chapter is short. Already starting on today's (which is ch 6)
“You’ve never been here before,” Draco said in surprise.
Draco learns who the mysterious producer is and what their ultimate plan was.
Harry struggled to remember. Draco silenced the heart rate monitor which alarmed as his heart beat faster.
Malfoy had a small smear of white icing in the corner of his lips. In the time it took Harry to get to the Leaky, Malfoy had demolished half of the dessert he’d ordered and finished at least one cup of coffee—possibly more, based on Malfoy’s energy when Harry’s was flagging.
“You and Malfoy will make perfect foils,” Blaise added, walking Potter toward Draco.
cut my wrists. Lucky for me, since every single window in this rathole has been shattered, I’m too frozen to even notice.
Draco dressed in his best trousers and linen tuxedo shirt, including cuff links with his French cuffs. He tied his holiday green bowtie before sliding on his best tuxedo robe.
Draco drained his glass, giving himself enough time to think. He had no jobs in the pipeline and his personal vault at Gringott’s held nothing but dust and cobwebs. And if it went balls up, and make no mistake, it
“Drink this,” Harry said firmly, leaving no room for argument. While Malfoy sipped, Harry used his diagnostic wand to check his vitals. “Your temperature is 100.5. Not quite a fever, but I’m betting that even on your worst days, you have more energy than this.”
Before I fall asleep, I amuse myself by thinking of all the ways I could get even with Rita Skeeter, up to and including death.
have?
The hope of a small child, the way they believe completely in their dreams of a happy future. And lavender. This was his potion, his creation, and Harry used it when his patients needed a moment of peace, something to remind them Good still existed in the world.
He looked away from Potter
“It’s SpongeBob!”
And Sixten? He’d broach that when it was time.
up at Lundberg, at all 8 feet tall of him, a wall of solid muscle, with his stupid ginger-blond hair, and stupid unnaturally perfect white teeth, and Harry almost gagged at how—
Harry set the tea service on the coffee table and rubbed the back of his neck. Maybe Malfoy had lost his mind, or maybe Kreacher put something in the soup, because this wasn’t making any sense.
Draco blesses the house and asks its permission, and then they clean. Shame it’s too hot to keep shirts on.
“Oh, Merlin’s saggy pants.” Malfoy face-palmed again. “You have no idea how much you have?” he said into his hands.
“Another brilliant observation, Potter,” Malfoy drawled. He held out the empty chair for his friend, who sat down. “This is Sixten Lundberg. He’s a former Quidditch star for the Swedish-Norwegian League and current solicitor.”
Snape’s groan was muffled by his hands over his face.
Behind the shutters, Harry snickered at the backhanded compliment at the same time Ginny flipped Malfoy off.
“Oh, shit! I forgot about the spaghetti sauce! It’s burning!” Potter ran down the stairs, jumping halfway to the bottom.
“Yellow,” Scorpius whispered. “I’m afraid.” His lips trembled, and he moved closer to his father. Draco held him close and said something Harry couldn’t hear.
Thank you for following this. The next fic is called DESIGNING WIZARDS. it's the infancy of wizarding telly, and Blaise and Pansy are in on the ground floor with their shows based on Muggle HGTV.  They convince Interior Designer Draco to be on air talent and what better house to begin with than Grimmauld Place?
“Still on for Tuesday cinema?” Harry asked.
Obviously Lundberg and he were close enough that Malfoy knew the owl on sight. What the hell was Malfoy playing at, sitting on his lap and making Harry almost kiss him when he—he—he knew
“Hard drinking man. I like that. I like you, Draco. Been meaning to talk with you for a while, but word around was that you and Potter were—” Sohrob said and slid his hand to Draco’s hip. When Draco looked at him, Sohrob raised an eyebrow.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Potter. Only you could turn this into some god damn love triangle. Sixten’s not—”
I mumble
“Or, we do have a significant amount of work to do when we leave here. I could go home with you, see this statue-thing bobble monstrosity—” Which made Harry laugh all over again, and Draco spoke over him, “And since you’ll likely have a thousand questions, it will be easier if I’m right there to answer them. Save an owl from dying of exhaustion.”
“How about hot Head Auror to be?”
Mr. Dimplethwait handed Harry the bottle before sitting on the corner of his desk. “Here you go. For your potions supply at home.”
“The owls. The damn owls!” Potter said into the tabletop. “They tapped at the window all night. And look!” He pulled himself up out of the chair and pointed to spots on his scarlet robes. “They shit all over my uniform!”
The timer dinged and Harry checked the first batch of croissants. Like he said, he had his friends and Wizard telly. Maybe he would adopt a dog; he could take it for walks and ease back into society.
“I thought she was—” Potter says, not daring to make eye contact. The apology I hear in his voice was genuine, but fuck that.
“You two certainly have energy,” Molly Weasley said, rearranging the table to make space for the bowl of fruit she held. “This is the last of it from the concourse tables. Everyone ate their fill and left happy.”
“Aw, Malfoy, you say the sweetest things,” Potter laughed.
“I do date. I—"
“I must apologize for my son--” Malfoy breathed in heavily, and Harry worried he might faint. He helped Malfoy to the couch and sat him down. With a quick motion, Harry summoned a bottle of water from the kitchenette.
With a shoulder shrug, Harry brushed off Draco’s question.
“Well. This is delightfully awkward,” Malfoy said, standing on the edge of the suite’s living room wearing pajama bottoms and a threadbare T-shirt. He looked washed out especially against the deep brown wall. “I’ll just go back—”
The two jumped apart, shocked by the noise. The mood broken by the doors closing.
“Go. Go. I’ll close up.” Harry held the door open for Ginny, who carried one tray and had nine more floating behind her. “Have fun. Go save your wife.”
for one of Harry’s “weird giveaways he was so obsessed with.”
“I’ll owl her when we’re done. But for now—” Draco raised the items from their hiding spot. “Give me your vest.”
Draco rolled his eyes but spoke directly to the camera. “I’ve been in ancient homes like that one,” he pointed to Number 12. “These homes, the ones for the so called Sacred 28. They didn’t just provide shelter. They protected their families. The house’s magic would intertwine with the owners’, like wild vines, until they were almost inseparable. And the houses have become like fortresses protecting the Dark Magic and the family.”
With the drawing room completed the day before, they moved into the study.
He spelled out Scorpius, which Harry grudgingly thought was fair since it
“You can touch me—if you want,” Draco said. He took Harry’s hand and laid his palm flat over where his heart raced.
Harry stood, his knees creakier than he liked, and he kissed Draco softly. “More than okay.”
“Alright,” he said to the empty room as he made the bed, brushing away the wrinkles in the linen. “Time for scrambled eggs on toast and a bowl of porridge with bananas and chocolate chips, hold the bananas.”
“Harry! That’s confidential! You can’t—” Hermione grabbed it back before he could look at it.
Harry’s anger spiked before he could tamp it down. “Christ, Ginny. If this is you
Draco sat up in the bed, careful to keep the blanket over his lap. “Wait—Potter left?”
“Would you mind if we moved to the living room?” Draco asked. He looked uncomfortable asking, as if he were being too forward. “I’m cold, and that room was warm. The fire. It was nice.”
But no one said shit like that about Draco.
Harry laughed as he watched Draco and wondered if he knew how Harry felt. That his heart slammed into his ribs and then dropped out of his chest completely, leaving Harry breathless and lightheaded. Or how his body betrayed him when they were together, leaving Harry wondering how blood could rush to his face and his dick at the same time. And why he, a generally intelligent adult, spoke like a teenager if he could speak at all when he first saw Draco.
“You don’t.” A single bead of sweat rolls down his cheek. It’s so cold in here that I’d give anything for a firewhisky or even one of Potter’s dishwater cups of coffee, but he’s sweating.
While he works, I try wandless magic, but I have no idea what I’m doing. But clearly, the windows aren’t going to repair themselves, so I should try. It’s better than doing nothing and freezing.
“I don’t know. He has been a little yelly today.” Scorpius rubbed his chin, but then added, “I guess we can help him. He’s a nice guy.”
“—thought it would be a great idea to have flute noses.”
He pinned the towel to the shelf edge where it belonged. “You wave it and it helps the team win.”
“Did you have a Covid-19 test before you took the Portkey?” Harry asked, all whimsy vanished.
He can barely speak. How can he hold the knife?
at the Old Timers today.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and peeled Scorpius off Harry’s chest. “Don’t you know anything?” Before Harry could respond that he knew plenty of things, Malfoy added, “It’s a good thing you asked me to teach you about dogs
“Someone completely pitiful who needs better judgement.”
Just the growing need and desire between the two of them.
Slowly, Harry unbuttoned Draco’s blue silk shirt and let it puddle on the floor. Draco’s shoulders were sore from the days of work, and as if Harry knew, he kissed one shoulder and across Draco’s prominent clavicle to the other.
Draco kissed Harry, forgetting that everything in the confessional was fair game for the telly show.
Harry tried to make himself comfortable on the hard bench, the straight rails pressing into his back. He cursed himself for not researching Augustus Dimplethwaite; the name sounded familiar, but was that just because he owned the Cannons? “Is the orchid market hot right now?” he asked, hoping that was a good conversation starter.
Of course. He’d been in Grimmauld Place. The wards recognized him.
“Trouble in paradise with Mr. Sunshine?”
Because Potter is shit at most things, yeah? But he keeps me grounded, makes sure my sarcasm stays at almost acceptable levels. Because he laughs at my bad jokes and rituals I have to do.
Harry tapped each board with his wand, pulling the nails out and loosening the boards until he could pry them up with his fingers.
“You look ready to me,” Pansy offered and looked pointedly at Draco’s chest.
He’d heard something about him dating a Greengrass daughter. But none of them seemed like a good match for Malfoy.
This risk. Of not being enough. Not tall enough or thin enough or thick enough. The risk of giving himself over and having his heart broken.
Nothing. Not one fragment of glass even shimmies in its spot on the floor. No matter how much time I spend on it, not that I have any idea of time. It was dark when I started; it’s still dark. Could be 30 minutes? An hour? I’ve no idea.
“Saint Mungo’s—”
Potter laughed, a good belly laugh, deep and long until he can’t breathe, and Draco joined in like he didn’t have a choice because he didn’t. Potter’s laugh winds around him and draws him in until they’re both wheezing, pressing out words.
an impressive showing.
Harry grinned as he ran a hand down his abdomen, across the lines formed from thousands of hours of Auror training. “I’m gonna take your clothes off and then blow you. I’ve never done it before, but I can figure it out.”
Pansy hefted the camera from her shoulder. “Same time tomorrow?” she asked, rubbing her upper arm.
“Dylan, this is my job. This is what I do. I’m a doctor who makes house calls, and I get paid really well to do it.” Harry said, exasperation tinging his voice. He chose a pair of suit trousers and a starched, white dress shirt. His tie had hidden Mickeys. “You know this. We’ve talked about it before.”
Draco pulled at the cuffs of his dress shirt as he reined in his anger; he didn’t know what bloopers were, but if Blaise were going to try to humiliate him in front of his co-host, that was never going to happen. He looked up from his wrists and stared into the camera with one raised eyebrow. And winked.
“Hey, look!” Harry said, pulling a plaque out and blowing the dust toward Malfoy. “This commemorates the game in 1999 when they broke their sixteen-game losing streak by drawing with the Caerphilly Catapults.”
“Your mother suggested the show, and insisted that you and Draco would have great
“Whatever.”
Harry stopped in place, arms overflowing and wand still snug in his back pocket. He bit his lips and laughed silently as he nodded.
Harry thought as he stepped into the flames. They could catch up, learn about each other over dinner.
Harry’s breath caught, like this was the most intimate gesture someone had ever done. “Your skin is soft. I like it.”
he’d gone there every day for breakfast.
Draco kissed Harry, closed the gap without softness or finesse. He kissed him with white, hot need that overpowers sense, that says,
The next day is the same. He checks for owls, waits to order lunch, walks by Potter’s house after work. The day after. And the day after. No Potter, no owl. The only logical answer he has is that Potter is avoiding him. And by Friday, he’s done.
Draco grabbed his wand and said, “I’m going to try something—” And he enlarged the windows until they were virtually the entire wall. “What do you think?” he asked Harry.
It was the single worst house he’d ever seen.
Draco fell asleep curled into Potter, stickiness be damned.
wanted. Draco rolled his eyes again.
Draco took Sixten’s chair and nudged Harry to turn to him. Slowly, carefully telegraphing his intention, Draco places a gentle hand on Harry’s cheek. His gaze is soft and caring, and Harry’s heart barrel rolls in his chest. “Like this morning. You didn’t let me finish. You’ve got to let me finish.”
But the pang of loneliness in Harry’s heart told him it really wasn’t. Not anymore.
When the committee members turned back to Sixten, Harry ducked out of their circle. “Did you use a
The dark, dingy back meeting room had been transformed into a magical Winter Market, complete with (warm) snow and store fronts that offered different dinner fare or kitschy party keepsakes.
“Not gave up. Postponed,” Molly tutted. “I expect you both at the Burrow when you finish here. I’ve left Fleur in charge, so the menu will probably be
Harry shrugged. “I dunno. I guess an owl could find him, though.”
Harry leaned against the counter between Draco and the fridge. “Anyway, he was—"
“Maybe you’re right,” Harry acknowledged. “This coffee is shit, by the way. Who lets you make it?”
Harry was surprised by the question, the honest curiosity. he kept filling bags with turkey, overwhelmed by the volume of leftovers. Next year, we’re sending people out with food. “Why wouldn’t they? You’re my—friend.”
Draco climaxed with Harry’s name his only words. His chest heaved with shallow breaths, and he doesn’t care if he never takes a full breath again. He struggled to tell Harry to give him a second, that he would take care of him in a moment, but Potter didn’t listen.
“Make sure Kreacher has enough food for two?”
TW: Vague mention of controlling possibly abusive boyfriend. Draco explains that Astoria's boyfriend has unsavory ties and that she hasn't seen her friends in months.
Nothing.
Turns out, he’s not so good looking after all, not when he’s all ugly cursing and yelling.
An evergreen tree had been shoved into a corner of the office, the only nod to the Christmas season. The fairy lights were off, but when Harry looked closer he realized thee tree had no lights, and the sparse decorations were red sequined hearts that looked tawdry and cheap compared to the orchids.
Harry really didn’t like how pale Malfoy was. “So, worldwide pandemic, you’re traveling, and you think, why bother?”
TW: being outed
All Draco could say was
this prompt is a stretch, ok?
That’s all there was.
Sohrob linked his fingers with Draco’s and pushed their way through the crowd toward the exit.
They were silent for a moment, and Draco didn’t know what Potter was thinking about, but he, himself, was definitely not thinking of what Potter’s face would look like when he came.
“See, Potter?
“Your ex-boyfriend. Tall, dark, hot. New job, takes up lots of time?”
He’d hated that. People had poked into his privacy. He’d been in the spotlight all the time.
Potter protested, but in the end acknowledged it was true. “I spent more time in the infirmary at Hogwarts,” he said. “They should probably name it after me.”
Draco swallowed hard. That sounded—wrong. He should visit her; he knew that. But the Manor and its memories. It was difficult to explain. The last time he’d been there, he’d felt small and helpless, flooded by flashbacks of war trauma.
Harry caught a server’s attention and asked for coffee, which he promptly spilled on the table. He dabbed at it with napkins and papers before it could dribble onto his baggy, worn jeans.
Draco dropped a kiss on Harry’s head and went into the hallway to see who was keeping vigil with him.
Homesickness welled up, closing Harry’s throat. It was the homesickness and not the thought of a family—children and a husband who would love him thoroughly and deeply no matter what. And whom he would love as precious things.
Harry sat back down on the bench seat, which was even more uncomfortable because he was stuck to it, and gritted his teeth. “What the hell are you even doing here? Are you some tropical specialist?”
“Worse than the canteen sandwiches? That itself is a crime!” Draco joked weakly. “Well, I’m gonna—” He jerked his thumb toward the road and left before Potter could say anything else.
“Because I actually wash myself instead of daydreaming and tossing off,” he said, towel drying his hair.
But I know one of the chefs there—we went out for a bit. He was happy to help me out.”
In his head, Harry mocked Malfoy, who looked
And Draco wanted to cheer, could feel the excitement
she’d asked.
Dylan was silent, and just as Harry was going to say something ugly including the words
He’s alone a lot.
“And, pray-tell Mr. Potter, why won’t they be cold and bored at the match?” Professor McGonagall sat back in her chair, sipping her tea and looking like she had caught Harry once again.
Draco should’ve listened better,
Draco pushed the fake Chanel monstrosity out of the way.
Harry leaned forward the tiniest bit—any further and their noses would have touched.
“What’s this?” Malfoy yelled, waving a yellow towel out the door.
all the time, treat him like some muscle-bound Adonis while Draco did every inch of work.
“I’ve been to the healer loads of times,” Scorpius whispered. Harry turned to Malfoy who was still standing at the foot of the bed, his face impassive.
Blaise and Pansy stomped back into the house, trailing snowy footprints behind them. “What are we working on today?”
“We?” she asked innocently. “The designer and the owner.”
There went Harry’s patience. He might be a fuck up as a boyfriend, but he was a damn good doctor. “Are you fucking shitting me? It’s not like I have access to the tests, and even if I did it’s still going to take 5 to 7 days to get reliable results—”
“They need us in A&E. Aurors down, Dark Magic damage. We have to go.” She gulped in air, her chest heaving from the run. “Come on.”
“Wha--what?” Malfoy sputtered. “I’m not getting naked for you, you absolute bellend.”
Out of the side of his eye, Harry caught Draco’s quick smile and realized he was taking the piss.  “You utter arse. You’re messing with me.”
“Not scones, Malfoy. Scones. It’s named after the Muggle band—”
“It’s just that, before you blew your knee out, you had all these plans. You had the invite to try out for Puddlemere United. Kingsley was practically begging you to join the Aurors. Fuck, McGonagall even offered you the Defense Against the Dark Arts job.”
Harry’s face dropped. Draco laughed and brushed a curl off Harry’s forehead. “He needs to know, and I don’t want an owl interrupting us.”
He had to consciously remember that they’d also been a hot fucking mess. Ginny escalating, always escalating, trying to reach him someway. And Harry was absent even when they were together, withdrawing until there was nowhere further to go. He acted the victim instead of addressing their issues like an adult. It took months, travelling the US alone to realize what he wanted.
“What is this? It’s good.” Malfoy asked, dipping his spoon back into the bowl. “It’s
Draco found the closet that Blaise had set up with the small camera that he and Harry were to use. He called the room The Confessional.
“S’ok,” Draco said, his voice unsteady. “It’s fine. Really.”
“I’ll let that go because I am so pleased,“ Malfoy nodded toward Ginny’s fingers. Harry laughed  again and Malfoy moved his head as if he could see through the slats. “Who’s back there?“
We’d been out-dueled by a Wizard who our intel said was a Squib. Who our intel said was a young, slender, blond man. And not a young, slender, blonde woman. Seriously? We need better intel.
Draco and Harry stayed on the third-floor landing, barely aware that Blaise and Pansy had seen themselves out.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Draco hissed, close enough to Harry’s ear that Sixten couldn’t hear.
“If I ask, I bet Ginny could get the team together for a meeting,” Harry said, thinking out loud. Maybe they’ll be so happy not to work for Dimplethwait that they’ll actually help with the renovations.” He felt the tiniest spark of hope in his gut.
And he did. Harry closed his eyes and let himself feel the softness of Malfoy’s fingertips and the low thrum of his magic as it meshed with Harry’s. it took a moment for Malfoy’s words to register.  “I don’t have a partner—” He pulled his arm back in surprise, and Malfoy’s fingers fell away. Harry immediately missed Malfoy’s touch.
In nasty, painty jeans splattered with other indeterminate stains. A t-shirt that had fared no better than his trousers. And the past five years had done nothing to tame his hair.
“—And what do
“Good!” Potter laughed as he began stripping off his shirt and jeans. He pulled the sheets back, but Draco stopped him with a loud squawk.
Attendance keeps rising as word gets out that the Cannons are vastly improved and that they host fun, innovative events. And they're 3-0.
“But the cupcakes—”
would be good enough.
“Is it okay if I ask you to take me to bed?”
“Do you prefer formal furniture or more casual?”
“But I got you, fam. Can’t be harder than standing on a long board, riding a wave.”
“You keep quiet. I’m not finished.” Cautiously, Malfoy approached the thermostat on the wall. The plastic box that covered it was locked—most likely to keep anyone from lowering the temperature. Malfoy pulled his wand back, but Harry grabbed his hand.
It’s not that he didn’t have the chance to date, mind you. It’s just that, he’s a Junior Healer. And everyone knew they have almost no time to sleep in 24 hours. How was he supposed to find time to go out with someone?
“Brilliant?” Draco asked with a grin.
“I’ve only known you three days,” Draco said, his voice hushed afraid it would carry in the stairwell and sound foolish.
Harry stood alone in the hallway, still reeling from his own stupidity. There’d been so much in Malfoy’s sentence, Harry had no idea how to unpack it.
“It’s a risk, Harry. A huge risk.”
“I’m going to hang in the trainers’ room,” she said, waving Harry on. “Find me when you’re done.”
“Oh, I just saw him in the lobby. I guess he was here on a case. He was in a hurry to leave, but I stopped him to perform the scabies spell.”
Based loosely on this prompt:
Draco followed Harry up the stairs to the second floor. The view was alright, so that was a bonus.
Malfoy raised his head and held his hand up; for a moment, Harry considered talking over Malfoy’s pause because they
It slithered to Harry’s chest, and Draco could finally see it.
“That was bloody brilliant,” Harry said, slapping Draco’s back.
“Come on,” Harry said, forgetting he’d been embarrassed about the dust or the pillow. “Soup and toast.” He copied Kreacher’s voice as he led Malfoy down the stairs to the warm kitchen.
“You’re laughing!” Harry stared as if Draco had lost his mind. “Why are you laughing?”
The title comes from the Fall Out Boy song
But he
“Sure. Okay.” Harry tugged at the neck of his jumper. To him, the kitchen was uncomfortably warm, just as it was every night at dinner. Maybe Malfoy had ice water in his veins. Seemed that way sometimes…Harry took the jumper off and tossed it onto the kitchen table.
“Potter. Did you forget again that you’re a wizard?”
Their first Quidditch match as owners didn't go how Draco and Harry had hoped.
“That insane bastard,” Draco said through gritted teeth. “What the actual fuck was he thinking?”
“We cancelling the cinema tonight, then?” Draco ignored the confusing feeling in his stomach as he asked.
“Before you start with one, I wanted to apologize. I was out of line when I asked about you and Weasley. I should have respected you enough to know better.”
“It looks nice,” Draco said as they stood in front of the door, as if he were waiting for something.
TW: therapy session about being alone
he looked over his shoulder to Hannah Abbott working behind the bar,
“I would never,” Harry said with a straight face that lasted about ten seconds before their laughter started.
He watched Draco out of the corner of his eye; instead of making him less worried, Harry’s comment seemed to have deepened the lines.
“But? What but?” Malfoy demanded weakly.
“True.” Draco slid his hands into the elastic waist of Harry’s joggers. “But they don’t have buttons or zips.”
He struck through something on his list.
The first place Draco tried was the Confessional Closet, and yes, that’s where Potter was. Draco heard his tone but not his words. He still sounded heated, and Draco was fairly certain it was about Blaise and his camera.
his brain supplied.
Draco thought.
He waved and was gone before Harry could ask who and what.
I shove my hand out to shake his hand. He comes at me, ready to throw two arms around me in a bro hug. I wind up stabbing his gut.
“No way. Not now,” Harry said as the waiter brought their drinks. “You’re just going to have to wait until after we eat.”
Draco had been right. It
“Just now,” Potter said, and it seemed like he’d expected Malfoy to be angry. “Is that ok?”
Draco patted Potter’s hands. “Poor you. Having people throw themselves at you. Offering sex. It’s a tough life, Potter. I don’t know how you survive.”
Draco sicked up a little in his mouth. “Let’s keep this purely professional, shall we?” But then, his curiosity got the better of him. “Why’d you break up if you were such a
“Let me be!”
Draco cackled, loud enough that one of the senior Healers glared and whispered
she’d eventually agree, and the profit is in the food and merchandise, not the tickets.
“You repulse me.”
Harry nodded resolutely to punctuate his words.
“He’s coming around,” a stranger’s voice says from far away.
“Doctor Potter, I’ll join you in the sitting room in a moment.” Draco held his hand toward the open bedroom door.
As Harry watched Malfoy laugh, his own self-consciousness dissipated. “He’s not as bad as he used to be—”
Harry focused on the heat, and his clinging shirt, and the nauseating stench of the orchids. And the cost cutting. Yeah. The cost cutting. And how much he despised Draco Malfoy. “What do you mean, don’t ask again. I’ll ask if I want to. Mr. Dimplethwait, what’s your price for the Cannons?”
TW: Harry is kidnapped by his date, who is fully versed in Harry's personal history.
But the service was tetchy and didn’t work half the time. Plus—the few times he’d used it his date made a crowd-gathering scene. And using a glamour and a fake name seemed like lying.
“When were you going to make a move?”
Harry laughed. He felt giddy with the success of the day, even if it were a limited success. And he was here at dinner with Draco. A few days ago, he was furious with Draco for his questions about Ginny. About whether he could work with her professionally. But he’d thought—
Professor McGonagall’s office was spare and tidy, no-nonsense and direct like her. There were no doilies and decorative cat plates blinking at them from the wall. No fascinating objects or funny noises. If it hadn’t been for the portraits on the wall, Harry would’ve thought he’d never been in the office before.
“No way. I have something super special planned,” Potter said with a huge grin.
“Oh, but you happily took my money to produce the show!”
Draco had moved the table as well and propped his socked feet up. “This is great,” he said, waggling his feet. “That, though.” He nodded toward the lone stocking hanging from the mantle.
“Green,” Scorpius said with more energy than Harry had expected.
“Really? Just one. That’s kind of—yeah, wow. Who’d be
“They still have houses and sorting, but there’s a lot more interhouse cooperation. McGonagall even took away the House Cup.” Harry flicked his wand in a quick,
“So 360 Galleons for an afternoon out for the students,” Harry said as he wrapped up the meeting. “And hours of silence for anyone who might stay at Hogwarts? Priceless.”
Things lead to things in the Foyer.
The alarm chimed, and Harry closed the shutters to return to Madam Malkin’s petit fours for her annual Open House that began at 5. He’d been right on schedule until Ginny remembered the extra half-dozen trays Madam Malkin had requested the day before. There was just enough time to complete the order on time and close up shop.
“You can keep your clothes on then,” Harry stood abruptly and caught his bag as it fell off his lap. He followed Malfoy up the hallway to a partially closed door. “Where is he and what’s going on? Ear ache? Probably Swimmer’s Ear. Pretty common down here. Unless it’s a break or a gator bite, it’s usually Swimmer’s Ear.”
live here. It’s not
“Yeah, I—uh—I’ve seen you play. That game against the Harpies was brilliant. Why are you here?”
SECOND, in my mind, Naughtie is pronounced "knock-tee" like on Hamish & Dougal. It just tickled me. What can I say? I'm a radio 4 nerd.
Harry literally didn’t know which was the most unreal of all of those. But if he had to choose, it would be Malfoy—Draco—fitting seamlessly into Harry’s home. Washing the dishes with a sponge and soap. Drying his hands first on the worn dish towel and then on his trousers. Coming back to the table.
Draco looked around, waiting for one of the three to break and start laughing at their joke.
Draco couldn’t speak, didn’t want to open his mouth, afraid logic would spill out. He nodded.
“Nice,” Harry echoed, too busy watching the snow fall around Draco, land on his shoulders and the tip of his pink nose.
Dylan smiled, pumped it up a notch to 100 watts, and winked at Harry. “Oh, we’ll be fine. We have masks and hand sanitizer and we can, y’know. Social distance. I’m dying to see the new Star Wars stuff!” He trailed his bare foot up Harry’s calf as if he thought sex might help sell the idea.
The corner-cutting, cost specialist.
Brought to you by this prompt:
and it wasn’t a good look on him. At all.
Draco laid his quill down on the desk. “I’ve finished. I only had one person to buy for.”
“It’s the middle of winter,” Harry began, thinking quickly. “And you’ve a castle full of cold, bored teenagers doing Merlin only knows what on weekends in empty classrooms. Bring them to Saturday’s Chudley Cannons match against the Appleby Arrows. We'll call it Hogwarts Day."
“For once, just keep your mouth shut, Potter,” Draco said as he pushed Harry past Jasmine and into the hallway.
Blaise cleared his throat.
“Whoa. Wait a mo,” Potter said, hands out to stop Draco. “He’s whose what?”
“I guess we should find Blaise—” Draco managed to say, but his mind wasn’t here. It was back in bed, with Harry’s arm slung over his waist, possessive and protective.
“I’ve worked with Jasmine long enough that I know how to reach her at home. I’ll ask her to set up an office staff meeting for tomorrow morning.” Draco tugged his vest out of his jeans and pulled it up to wipe the dust from his face.
“That much?!”
Malfoy stared at Harry. “I never would have thought we could sit together and have a casual conversation.”
Harry stayed.
Harry pulled his coat tighter and cursed himself for forgetting his gloves. It was a short walk from the apparation point to the stadium, but the sharp, cold wind bit into him. In front of him, the stadium was silent and stately, with its new paint and renovations. The garish orange was replaced by a dignified white; the only orange on the exterior was in what Harry thought were tasteful accents, like the logo. The ticket booths had been reconstructed, including heating and cooling charms to go along with the rest of the stadium.
“Done!” With moments to spare, Harry piped the last rosette on the last petit four. Harry reached for the trays, but Ginny stopped him.
Draco crowded Harry against the door. His mouth is on Harry’s throat, not biting—yet. “What the fuck was that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s bullshit, and you know it.” His voice sounds shaky, and he’s too white, like the snow that drifts into the room through the broken windows. “You’re a lot of things. A bloody good Auror. A great partner. A good friend.”
The room was silent. Draco held his palm up so the wand could act as a compass. The wand jumped out of his hand and, suspended in the air, it pointed downward, directly at the floor.
If I were anywhere else, I’d tease out that image of Potter, chest heaving, shirtless—
“It’s not really a surprise,” Harry said into Ginny’s shoulder. He hugged her and then struggled free. “I check the Owl Post Office every afternoon at 1.”
Harry’s face flushed as he stuttered out a reply. “That’s not what I meant. Kreacher always has food waiting, and he makes too much. It’s not always great, but it’s edible and better than I can do. Plus, I haven’t told you any of my ideas.”
It started a year ago—awkwardly, as all things between Draco and Potter had.
“Before we start, here’s a game I like to play with my patients: red means stop. Green means go. Yellow means I’m afraid. Can you remember that?”
“Of course we’re partners, Potter. Or did you forget that?”
Harry laughed and realized the swirling in his stomach must be hunger. Of course. That made sense. “Do you want to get something to eat? We could go back to mine—”
“Potter.
And now? He didn’t feel anger at all. Something new blossomed, confusing but also shimmery, bright like the angel outlined in lights that hung over his street. He didn’t know what to name it, but it could be not-hatred. Not-despising. Something edging close to—his mind stuttered over the word—like.
“Dude. Sorry that that bitch Rita Skeeter outed you, man. Tha’s not cool. If you wanna, we could grab a brew and kinda shred her. B. T. Dubs, I’m Chad, here from California. Here’s my digits,” Draco read.
Harry leaned into Draco’s touch. “I want to. And I like to. I just haven’t done it in a bit, so I may be a bit rusty—”
I’m afraid, so afraid. My chest feels like ropes are binding it, holding it down so I can’t breathe and all I do is laugh, laugh until I’m sobbing uncontrollably. But the relief doesn’t outweigh the fear, because if my Patronus fails, we’ll both die.
Malfoy continued to listen, and Harry wondered if he were catching the sub-text of his trip. That he’d gone to explore his sexuality where he could be invisible. In the end he’d had a lot of great sex, made good memories, dulled bad ones, and exchanged phone numbers with the blokes in case “you ever come back across the pond.”
“Hang up, Malfoy, for Christ’s sake--” Harry tried to speak over Malfoy who was focused on telling the security guard was an utter and complete imbecile he was for letting Potter through.
Harry nodded, unconvinced. He hugged Beatrix, gave Athene a treat to nibble, and disapparated.
“Oh, Merlin help us. I’m frightened. Legitimately afraid for myself,” Draco said, over dramatically.
Dylan’s snort of disbelief rang clearly through the phone. Harry took a deep breath and changed his tactic. “I know that you’ve put up with a lot the past six months. When I get home Christmas Day, we’ll go someplace just the two of us. I’ll get another doctor to cover for me. I’ll turn my phone off. I promise. We can go down to Key West and go into all those shops you’ve told me about. How’s that sound?”
“I spent some time a few years ago, travelling in the States. It was after Ginny and I broke up—” Harry stated it as information that needed to be out there. If Draco had any questions, they needed to address them now.
The sunlight streaming through the window woke Draco, who was warm and well-rested, and tangled up in Harry.
“Sixth year me would never have believed it,” Harry said, and silently cursed because his voice sounded charmed and not at all snarky like he meant it to sound.
Potter laughs loudly, and I don’t know how he can when our situation is dire. He smiles and says, “Do you still hate me?”
I struggle to sit up, and Potter can’t do anything except watch and coach me with his praise.
Draco ignored his question. “These scarves are worse than the orchids,” he said, propping up a teetering pile. “You do know that, don’t you? You’re worse than Dimplethwait.”

Harry picked up his mug to take a sip of his tea, but he’d finished it at some point. He’d been so engrossed in their discussion, he hadn’t even realized it was done. “More tea?” he asked and with a flick of wand, the kettle filled itself and settled on the hob.
Although Draco and Harry tried the thongs on, they didn’t stay on for very long.
“Look, I’m sorry,” Potter says through gritted teeth. “He—I mean, she—was supposed to be a Squib. I didn’t think—”
“We know you have to uh—do refunds, yeah? But, the team said they’d be happy to—er uh—have a skills y’know clinic on the pitch. Maybe people wouldn’t want refunds?”
“That’s gotta stay—”
“Twenty million Galleons. I’ll pay 20 million for the Cannons,” Harry said, pushing Malfoy out of his way to shout at Dimplethwait. In the back of his mind it may have registered that Malfoy was solid, muscle where none had been at school. “Bet that’ll buy a lot of orchid seeds. Trees. Bulbs. However the fuck they grow.”
have listened better, but he was busy glaring at the back side of a bloke standing down the bar.
was the one who’d grown up privileged, wealthy and from the best family. But his father had gone too deeply in with Voldemort, and his mother sat home alone now with just Draco and her flower gardens. And someone had to pay for the upkeep of the Manor, once the Ministry had taken most of their wealth as ‘reparations.’
Draco nudged Potter away from the counter and rattled through the drawer for a whisk. When he (very loudly) found it, he began scrambling the eggs.
“Yes, really like shit.”
“Puck, my kneazle. Door slam scared her.” Harry slid his fingers through Draco’s hair, pulling it away from Draco’s face. Over the past week, Harry’d thought Draco’s eyes were the color of the ocean, angry and rough in winter; now, with his pupils wide, it seemed more like the sky before sunrise, beautiful and promising.
“You look like shit,” I say, partly because he does. His face is pale, and I can’t ignore the deep circles around his eyes. But partly because I don’t want to say anything stupid. Like
Potter laughed at the joke, and that made Draco
Potter was warm against Draco, his body a pleasant weight next to his. This was what he’d wanted—more than he’d
Malfoy stood and hugged the intruder, which was bad enough, but when this—this—person kissed Malfoy’s cheek, that was too much.
“And I’m gonna take care of you so many times,” Harry said, shutting down the last part of his brain that whispered doubts to him. He pictured Draco naked under him, preferably on his bed.
Harry kissed Draco, keeping the bags to his sides. It was sweet, loving with a hint of more underneath.
Malfoy screamed in shock when the door opened as he thought about knocking. “Merlin, Potter. Don’t scare me like that.” He gripped his chest, afraid his heart was going to explode.
had been shifted and the floor in front of it was covered in glass shards and tiny white dots that Harry was not going to think about. The coat closet was open, everything was open and rifled through.
“Not in

lighter with no reason except the house had decided to make it so. Draco could see the outlines of the stairs to the second floor and an umbrella stand near Walburga’s painting.
Harry could smell the sweet cream from the tea on Draco’s breath—if he closed the infinitesimal space between them, they’d be kissing.
If it were a typical year, Harry would have probably flipped Malfoy off and told him to fuck himself. But that was too much bad mojo for a year like 2020. “You have no idea,” was all Harry said before ushering Malfoy into the second bedroom and helping him out of his clothes and into a t-shirt and work out shorts. Harry tried not to stare at the pale ribbons of scars that crisscrossed Malfoy’s torso.
“Your mum won’t listen when I mention that, so good luck,” Harry said, stooping to pull a weed growing between the pavement cracks.
“Green eggs?” Potter gave his plate the once over. “They look fine to me?”
“Not on the stadium walls, in the loos, and definitely not the grass. Let’s undo whatever spell was cast to make orange turf. The walls can be white with orange accents. We can play up the yellow, too. And for Merlin’s sake, can we please replace the fixtures in the loo, because every time I take a piss in an orange urinal, I think I’m dying.”
I like lying with Harry.
“Why didn’t you tell me we were dating?” Draco shook his head, but he was laughing now. The last bit of anger fizzled away knowing Potter was alright, that he would be alright.
My Patronus slithers off to the Auror Force carrying as much information as I could give it.
The snow usually made Draco feel like a little kid again; tonight, it just made him feel old.
This conversation made no sense. Potter was going to work on the show?
“Well I guess this house call is over. The $500 fee still stands. You can transfer it to my Gringotts, or I take American Express. If I trusted you, I would let you Venmo me, but no.”
Harry was so screwed.
Harry turned down the bed, and once Malfoy was resting comfortably, Harry would check on Scorpius again.
Not whether he’d have to work with someone who maybe cared for him—or not. Who wanted to hook up with him—or not. Who’d go bankrupt with him—or not.
“Famous media personality?”
“They have to sign non-disclosure agreements,” Malfoy argued, waving the papers in Harry’s face.
They walked up the snowy pavement, looking for a decent shop that served lunch. Harry stopped him and let the early lunch crowd pass. “I’m sorry he broke up with you.”
I suck.

“How’s your knee?”
With a sigh of resignation, Harry returned to his baking.
“And what about the cup of coffee?” Potter pointed to the mug that was still hot under a stasis spell.
Harry scanned the committee members, watched their response to Sixten’s eloquent words. Several nodded in agreement, which Harry thought was a good sign. He watched Sixten as he spoke; he seemed at ease in front of the committee in a way that Harry never would be. Harry would be shuffling, mumbling, avoiding eye contact, or he’d spend too much time with his back to someone. Sixten was a natural with a confident voice that invited people to agree with him.
“Draco, we’ve read like a thousand of these already—”
Harry ignored Malfoy’s question and sat at his desk, rifling through the stack of papers that Jasmine dropped there before yesterday’s game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco watching him, opening and then closing his mouth without Malfoy actually saying anything.
“Okay, that’s not true. Galvin Gudgeon looked good.”
“Are you even listening?”
“Dylan,” Harry broke into the monologue. “I can’t make it. I—"
“Jealous, Blaise? You shouldn’t have let him go.” What the fuck was he even saying? He was a design professional, and he’d needed a place to sleep to be rested and in shape for filming today. That’s why he’d taken Potter’s bed. Well, shared.
Ginny growled, literally
Harry stopped short. “Hey. The Catapults forfeited! We’re 1-0!” And he kissed Draco to celebrate.
Was it, though?
Thanks again for your patience. I've changed the number of chapters to 22.
And outside? In this weather without a coat? Draco doubted Potter was savvy enough to know a warming charm.
