Draco smiled into his neck, unable to stop the swell of pride in his chest. He always knew he was a good lay. A wave of exhaustion overtook him, even though it was only 9:30 in the evening. He closed his eyes and lay boneless against Harry’s chest.
Another healer runs her wand over his face. There’s a beep. “One-oh-seven here on the forehead.”
Standing abruptly, he turned his back to her, hiding his face. He, then, remembered something that would be a perfect way to conceal his angst. Walking towards the entrance, he went into the mudroom to retrieve something from his coat pocket. He returned with a long black velvet box that he slid on the table towards Astoria.
He pushed Draco to sit on the bed, none too gently, and knelt before him to put on his underwear for him. Draco stayed silent for a while. Honestly, he was a little afraid.
“I have a high threshold for pain. It wasn’t that bad. To be honest, I was really turned on, in the beginning. Maybe we could try it again with a little less pain and a little more lube?”
Harry sat down.
When Draco didn’t move, Harry manhandled him roughly out of the tub and threw him into the bedroom. Draco almost fell, but he was able to stumble onto the bed and lie face first.
It seemed that another discussion was imminent, but Draco did not think it would be necessary for Harry.
“For those terrible things I said in the tub. About the war. I don’t even think those things about you, ever.”
But Harry’s so fucking
Draco had been craving to have Harry inside him for quite some time now. He wanted another, more intimate way, to prove his love.
When they arrived at the entrance, Draco noticed a medium sized trunk with “HP” written on the top. Harry noticed him staring at it.
Draco was starting to feel a slight twinge now. Though he was stretched from earlier, he felt raw inside. Harry’s two loads, from earlier, however, made his passage slick, and Draco still enjoyed every stroke.
“Oh yes sir. I wonder, may I call you “Master” if I wish?”
“…I’ve bought some more rope,” he whispered in his ear.
Draco couldn’t help stroking it a few times. Blaise drew in a breath at his first touch.
“Ah..stings,” Blaise says after the first few blows.
“He’s out of town,” Draco says casually, as he walks to the liquor cart to fix himself a drink.
Draco’s heart began to sprint and he instantly felt sweat on his forehead. Panic.
Suddenly, Blaise shot his hand out to grab Draco’s wand arm tightly.
He knew Blaise’s favorite thing to hear was that he was a good boy.
“Perhaps I’ll just spank you because I feel like it then.”
“As I was not born yesterday, I’ve been able to surmise, on my own, that you two have been involved since that picture in the Profit came out. Harry’s attack against unspeakable Zabini only confirmed my suspicions. I only wish the public never caught wind of it, but I am prepared for the backlash. It is none of my concern what you two do in your personal lives as long as your work remains impeccable. I’m not losing you over silly personal matters. I only summoned you here to offer my support during this difficult time. I am prepared to defend you both, to the media or the Wizengamot, should the occasion arise.”
“You thought what?”
He was angry now. This was a sensitive topic. He was reminded that he could not fuck Blaise, even if he wanted to.
Harry was slamming backwards now and Draco was forced to pick up the pace. He changed his angle to hit his prostate and Harry shot jets of cum all over the the shower wall, dragging Draco’s orgasm out him. He grunted as he came inside of him, then exited. Cum splattered the floor.
Worse still, Blaise decided to reincarnate back to his submissive self who relied on Draco to make the first advance.
“Who knows?” He answered, standing up. “But I should get back to work. Think about what I said.”
“I prepared myself in the safe room before you arrived…”
Harry is still fiddling with the thing when Draco returns. Harry almost looks at him but remembers he shouldn’t look in his eyes. He is too distracted, in any case, by the cock-hardening black leather pants he’s wearing. He’s shirtless.
Draco gritted his teeth, determined to keep a cool head.
“Draco, I think I’m gonna cum.”
“Are you seeing anyone these days?” Draco ventured, yet again. At this, Blaise forcefully detached himself from Draco, and began to look for his boxer briefs.
Another shrill laugh.
“I’m not gonna leave you, baby.”
Draco could deny him nothing now, the same way he could not deny Scorpius.
“No…it’s not because of the article.”
“Oh, yes, sir,” Harry said in his soft voice, surprised he had forgotten. He clasped his hands behind him, resting them above his flaming ass.
It was an intense orgasm. He shivered with aftershocks, rocking slightly inside Harry for a few moments. When it was over, Draco kissed his neck and stepped away very slowly. He gripped the base of cock while exiting, to make it less painful for Harry. Falling to his knees behind him, he pushed his cheeks apart to watch his cum bubble out of Harry’s hole. It wasn’t much, but he saw Harry’s hole clenching, intentionally, contracting to push it out. Harry was putting on a show for him. He smiled and licked his hole hole clean, thrusting his tongue inside. His cum was sweet, the way Harry claimed, but it had salty undertones. He found he didn’t mind the taste and ended with a soft kiss against his hole, then stood up.
Draco quickly hid the letter in his briefcase.
“Better. I’m going to the gym. I think it will help. I should get going.”
Draco just looked to the ground, remember that time in his life with a fond sadness.
that Draco knocked on Harry’s door to deliver him a report that he’d been waiting for since morning. It was now mid afternoon. He knocked, but there was no answer. This was strange. Draco was sure Harry had not left his office all day, not even to go down for lunch. He knocked again, but there was still no answer. He pushed the door open slightly.
Harry burst through the door and slammed it shut behind him. This was the Minister for Magic’s door. The man had no respect. He sat down and crossed his arms in a huff. His face was cleaned, nose unbroken, but his shirt was still bloody.
Harry looked like he wanted to speak but just bowed his head in silence, looking crestfallen.
“No. Have you lost your marbles? Of course I’m not fucking bloody Harry Potter! This isn’t about Potter. Forget him. Listen to me. I’ve been thinking about this for a while and I need you and I to take a break from our arrangement.”
“Hands and knees, pet. Show me your assets.” Really, Draco was having too much fun.
“Have the reports in to me by the end of the day, Potter,
Draco was one harsh word away from hexing his boss’ balls off and losing his job for good. He tried to collect himself before answering.
Draco just froze.
Harry heard him come through and walked quickly to the parlor to great him with a soft kiss. Draco never tired of this kind of greeting. He plucked Draco’s suitcases from his hand to take them upstairs and set them down in Regulus’ old room, then dragged him out, back to his own room.
“…and it might take all night. What do you think?”
He slammed Blaise against his door and began to kiss him roughly.
“I want to control what you feel,” Draco said firmly.
Harry must have noticed the disappointment etched in his face, though he tried his best to cover it behind his usual mask of indifference. He didn’t want him to know how much he was wounded by this.
When he arrived at the ball, many people began whispering, no doubt from the absence of his gorgeous blonde wife at his side. Their divorce, still quite recent, was hot news in the papers for several days. Many articles ran, speculating on the reasons, but Draco could not bring himself to read them.
He saw Harry cast a cleaning charm on himself, but he remained lying flat, trying to catch his breath. His head was turned so that his cheek lay flat on the ground, and his eyes were closed. He was naked from the waist down. Only his socks remained. Draco picked up his pants and boxers and threw them at him, startling him. He felt Harry looking at him, but didn’t meet his gaze.
But Harry did know he was there and did it purposely, in anticipation for this moment. Draco hasn’t put him in the collar in well over a week, as this past weekend was spent with the children at Grimmauld Place. Another crack of the whip, this time on his back.
“Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew. When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt. I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all and I stood tall. And did it My Way.”
“It’s not my fault your head’s in the clouds today. You’ve been off all morning. You alright? We have a briefing with Shacklebolt in five minutes.”
Harry sat back and stared at his hands, regret etched in his face.
Draco clutched the parchment to his chest and sighed.
“I was hoping we could make it three mistakes, tonight…what do you think?”
“The classic Malfoy shrug. Why am I not surprised?”
“You truly want it, don’t you?” Draco nods emphatically.
He heard Harry stand up and come close behind him, felt calloused hands stroking his arms. His potent magic seeped through his shirt, warming him instantly.
As he crossed his arms, staring at the fire, waiting for his body to move, he felt a hand on his shoulder. He shucked it off and walked a few feet away, turning his back to Draco. Then he felt a hand on his calf. He turned around, shocked to see Draco kneeling before him.
He bent his head to lay soft kisses on his neck from behind. Draco was hard against him.
He feels stark-raving mad today, completely off-balance.
He may be gone. He walks a little farther. Past some desks, a sitting area, a fountain. There are paintings on the wall he never noticed before. Street lamps shine through some windows, painting a pale glaze on everything. He walks faster—and Harry’s
He didn’t move a muscle. He was too shocked by Harry’s proclamation, and his own orgasmic reaction, to do much of anything. Harry came up behind him and wrapped his arms around him. Draco stiffened in response.
Blaise tried to push him off, but Draco pinned his wrists down to the bed.
“Baby…what happened?”
“You’re in trouble now, pet. When I ask you a question, I expect an answer.”
All semblance of human thought left Draco’s mind.
Then in an act of sheer insanity.
Draco groaned. There was no way Harry was going to hold off for more than a moment or two, certainly not long enough for Draco to enter him. He lifted his head quickly and ordered,
Even as he said it, he knew the part about it being just casual, was a complete lie.
“Kind of like a toy, pet, really. Given the right magic…”
Draco was so relieved when the end of his work day came. He worked through lunch, as he had promised himself, but it was incredibly hard to focus after Harry’s morning visit, pun intended. He barely got any work done because his erection persisted long after Harry left. As soon as he started to get into a work flow and his erection subsided, one of Harry’s sexy phrases would pop up in his mind, and his cock would reawaken like a lightening rod. He had a sneaking suspicion that this was Harry’s intention, all along.
He embraced him. Draco kissed his neck and whispered in his ear.
“Fuck you, Malfoy,” he said calmly.
Draco dials back the toy so it’s throbbing just a little where he needs it. Then he blows him like he’s starving for his cum. Like he’s delirious from aching for him all day, which he is. He didn’t get to escape into the men’s room today to relieve the tension. He’s groaning from his heavy balls and steel erection.
His hands were shaking. This was a catastrophe. Harry had rendered him impotent. He hardly knew himself anymore, absolutely certain he would explode if Harry talked to him in that horrific tone one more time. He did not want to lose his job because he couldn’t hold it together.
. You’re still so tight. I’ve fucked you every night this week but your hole still clings to me.” He sighed loudly, like a man lost to desire.
He pulled away to fix himself a glass of firewhiskey, re-closing his robe.
“Having some trouble?”
“Relax, pet. I’m gonna get this for you.”
He kissed him the whole time he fucked him, and he maintained a slow steady pace. If Harry wanted to use him for sex, then that was just fine with him. He was his to use as he desired.
He started for a moment, as if out of a daze, and took his time straightening up. He looked back before leaving, hesitant to say something, but deciding to say it anyway.
“Fuck you, Potter. You’ve ruined me.” He was screaming at him.
Blaise had never held his hand in public. He knew better than that. In the past, he never felt guilty about Blaise because they had established the terms of their relationship early on. It was only recently that things started turning sour, but only because Blaise had forgotten the rules.
“Crazy for you.”
Harry thrust his hips upwards to ram his prostate again and again. Draco was flung into another universe of pleasure. He was far gone and away. He hardly knew what he was saying in response.
Why do you think?
“I’ll make some tea. Let’s go sit in the parlor.”
Worse still, what if Harry kept him from going out on cases, or he somehow found a reason to fire him? As the Head Auror, he had the authority to do just
Harry’s heart sank at his words. Blaise was hitting his most sensitive spot, his deepest insecurity about Draco since he saw him with Blaise in the pensive, six months ago. He swiftly collected himself, however.
Draco was trembling in his arms. They had fallen to the floor together. He rubbed his eyes furiously and his voice cracked.
“Do you really mean that?”
“Always the tone of surprise, Potter.”
He stood and summoned Neech to retrieve the small jewelry box in his room.
He did a
Draco grinned mischievously.
“When’s the last time you ate something, Draco?”
Blaise leaned forward in Draco’s chair to scrutinize his face more closely. Then, it dawned on him.
“I’m knackered, Harry. Can we talk about this tomorrow? I need to rest.”
“…I saw you two in the piano room at the Spielberg Mansion Ministry Ball a few months ago.”
“Of course. I’m always happy to see you, Harry.”
He cast one last healing charm at his hole and unbound him from the bed.
Having no choice in the matter, Draco opened his eyes to watch ropes of his cum splatter his eyelashes, his tongue, his chin, dripping down to his chest.
“No,” he whispers. Harry wipes his cheeks.
Draco opens his eyes and Harry almost blows at the lust he sees inside them. Lust and something else. The room starts shaking, Harry’s accidental magic. It’s Harry’s turn to close his eyes, but Draco keeps making these low “uh, uh, uh” sounds that are driving him to the edge. He’s gripping Harry’s forearms tightly. “Uh” every time Harry hits his prostate, and Harry drives into him harder, faster, until Draco is writhing through his orgasm. Cum oozes out of his pink cock down the sides of his rigid shaft.
Harry locked eyes with him, determined to reduce Draco to a puddle of lust, and tried again.
“Trying to get rid of me Drake?” Draco flushes.
Before he could muster up the courage, Blaise beat him to the punch, “Did you see Potter tonight?”
At first, Draco did not understand why Harry always insisted it be him. They hated each other with passion, but they were suppose to trust each other with their lives?
To his horror, Draco felt his eyes prickling. He didn’t know why he had suddenly become this tearful old maid over night, but he couldn’t help it. Harry was making him feel things he had suppressed for most of his life. He turned his face away.
Draco looked around and no one was paying them any mind. He’d been sitting there for all of two minutes, and they were mostly hidden from view. He watched Blaise limp away and it filled him with immense sadness.
Draco used his wand again to summon a gag that tied itself to Harry’s mouth.
________________________________________________
Harry flinches. “I would never—“
“Sorry Drake. I’ll just be going now.”
When he got to his office, Shacklebolt motioned for him to take a seat. He didn’t speak and seemed to be waiting for something.
“You know, I saw you from a distance when you first got here. The hair gave you away. You were smiling and laughing. It’s a good look on you, Malfoy. You should try it at work sometime.”
Draco was still paralyzed, it seemed. So Harry took his hand to direct him out of the shower and began to dry him with another towel, tying it around his waist.
Pointing his wand at his hole, he filled it with lube and put some on his fingers.
Draco takes him on the desk and in the empty conference room and in the ministry locker rooms one night, when Draco skips his workout to lie there in wait. He uses him until he doesn’t know how Harry moves in the field. He gives him everything his body can—they’re often up all night—and Draco sleeps like the dead in twenty minute increments on the office couch Harry conjured for him.
Draco sighed, both in pleasure and exasperation.
“What are you doing?”
Draco had said too much in his anger. He was just so incredulous that
Draco snorts. “Could you? I’ve been begging you to for the last month.”
Draco feels a mixture of disappointment and elation when he sees Harry’s cum staining the grass between them.
“I have to go. We’ll talk later.”
When imbibed, they made the person feel euphoric, as if they were on a different plane of magic, an alternate universe where they were invincible. Consequently, it loosened all their inhibitions and made them very susceptible to suggestion. Not a good combination. It was being used recreationally.
“Sir, you need to step back. Only family members allowed.”
Draco lay on his side, turned away from Harry.
Draco punched the wall, scraping his knuckles. His heart and eyes were on fire from the helplessness he felt. He floo’d to Malfoy Manor and lay in bed alone that night, hoping Harry would surprise him. Sleep never came. Neither did Harry.
He feels humiliated, caught. If Harry could see him now...Disgusted with himself, he wills his cock down with thoughts of Harry’s heartbreak, and it works.
Draco had so much to do for work the next day. The Monday blues were creeping up on him early, even though it was only Sunday afternoon. He wondered if he really would have to complete Harry’s reports for him, if he should just do it now.
Harry was already there, as per usual, and shirtless, again. Draco’s annoyance was heightened as he had spent an inordinate amount of time with him today, and his nerves were fried. He couldn’t keep quiet tonight.
Draco looked away. He was not going to pretend to be incredulous over her bold statement. He knew exactly what that meant. Astoria knew what his favorite ‘position’ was—underneath another man.
______________________________________________
He reached over to grasp his hand for a second, feeling proud of him, then moved to pull it back, but Blaise held onto it, leaning forward and whispering quietly.
Harry wasn’t talking but his sex noises increased in pitch, to little squeaks.
gift of his tender love. He hardly felt worthy. They were both silent as they washed each other off and stepped out of the shower. As they dressed, Harry was looking distinctly smug.
“A shrug isn’t going to cut it. We had an incredible weekend last Saturday, but I felt distant from you tonight. Don’t you want me anymore? Now that you’ve had me, you’re pulling away. I can feel it. You always make me feel like I’m not good enough and I’m trying to be what you need. I stayed away all week. What is it you want? I’ll do whatever it is.”
He used his wand to tie Blaise’s wrists together behind his naked back with conjured thick black rope.
“Now who’s lying?” Harry whispers.
“Potter, you’ve lost your marbles. Have you taken your potion today?”
“You’re always stressed at work. Did something happen? You can tell me anything. Talk to me.”
Steam billowed around him and he breathed it in. He kept his eyes closed for a while, but the feeling of being watched started to vex him. He cracked his eyes open to see Harry staring at him through the the thick steam, unblinking.
Harry took a long time to look up, and when he did, it startled Draco. This was far worse than his hard expressionless face. It was like there was nothing behind his eyes. Like a dementor had sucked out his soul.
His attitude, afterwards, is what vexed Draco.
“I want to feel your cum all over my face again, too. Do you think that’s a possibility?”
out at the bustling streets of London, conjured magically, as they were underground.
‘I guess it pays to be the Savior’, Draco thought with venom.
He managed to find his sweet spot after a few more thrusts and Draco yelped again.
Draco blushed with shame over his accuracy. How many times had he used some variation of these same words? Now, the roles were reversed and he could not help the wave of humiliation that passed through him. That was overshadowed, however, by Harry’s thick cock rubbing against against him. He answered by thrusting backwards and spreading his legs.
Harry’s face transforms—confused to anguished.
She stood up, weeping, and went around Draco’s desk to kneel in front of him. She kissed his hands.
He still hadn’t said a word, which added to the fear factor.
“Definitely yes, pet…such a pretty cock.” Without waiting for a reaction, he swooped down again, his tongue happily bathing Harry’s balls while his hand held the stiff shaft loosely.
“Okay,” he answered softly.
Blaise slams his mojito on the glass table and it startles Draco. He jumps.
Draco looked down at at his lust-filled eyes as he licked each finger, one by one. There was still a splash of cum on his cheek. Draco thought he had never, before, seen such a beautiful sight.
He stood up, feeling dizzy on his feet, and began to redress himself. He repaired his robe, but it was still in a sorry state.
“Blaise is close to cracking. I made progress today. He’s meeting a contact this weekend.”
“Every one of them is not a crazed sociopath.”
“I heard you were sick, and I came to check on you. We have a case.”
He dragged Harry up the stairs, after the sun set, and promptly removed all his clothes. Harry was mostly unresponsive, just watching Draco through hooded eyes.
charm that bound his ankles to either bed post. His wrists were tied together, stretched out in front of him,
“I’m late now, thanks to you.
This behavior wasn’t going to fly anymore. Draco grabs his wrist hard and puts him in a submissive position against the wall, pressing his arm to his lower back. Harry does not struggle. Draco
Rumors were flying about Blaise’s persistent bachelorhood in pureblood circles, especially recently, as Blaise had not been spotted out on dates with pureblood women in quite some time.
“Sir,” Draco suggested firmly.
Draco looked down before answering.
He tried to remember why he had ever tried to stop this thing between them, in the first place. It felt inevitable. He was completely addicted to this new sensation already, planning to never let go.
Draco knelt between his legs and began stroking his cock lightly while generously lubing his hole with a single finger. Overly sensitive as he was, Harry went wild, moaning continuously.
Draco was an excellent auror, the best in the department, even better than Harry.
That makes Draco grin. “Which one?”
“Don’t.”
Harry was wearing black trousers as well, but a forest green button down that brightened his eyes. He looked good enough to eat.
He fell quickly into a blissful sleep.
“Does daddy want to fuck?”
“At work? You wouldn’t.”
Harry gasped in surprised pain. Draco relished the sound. Perhaps, he was expecting a spanking or lighter treatment, not having been able to see the conjured whip.
Draco is so changed himself—so wasted for him, years on end now—all his focus is on staunching his own wounds. He’s not looking past himself.
“Tell me who it is, right now, Astoria.”
So locked into his nonsensical jealousy…that he can’t live his life. He can’t follow through on any of his feelings. Not even the important ones. The worst thing is that he knows
“What’s that suppose to mean?”
Draco used his authoritative Dom voice, with the command to tell him. He knew Blaise would not be able to resist. Blaise’s blush intensified.
Dinner was mostly a pleasant affair. Draco and Astoria were quiet as Scorpius prattled on about everything Draco had missed while he was gone. Towards the end of the meal, he brought up something that both surprised and alarmed him.
“Blaise.”
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Yes.
This meant a load of paperwork for both Draco and Harry. By the time he got back to the office, it was 4pm so he quickly worked to finish it before end of day, intending to hit the gym hard that evening as he had missed his weekend workout.
He didn’t reply and completed his workout in silence.
Harry and Draco did not exchange two words throughout the entire breakfast. Harry was smart enough not to engage him. When the Potters got up to take their leave, Draco was relieved. He needed time to collect himself after his emotional day yesterday. Hours of enduring personal time with Harry’s soft laughs, shy smiles, and terrible chess skills had overwhelmed him.
Draco narrowed his eyes. He wanted to throttle him. Only Blaise was allowed to call him Drake. Blaise smiled guiltily and shrugged, as if to excuse his behavior.
that you’re just using me. I let myself think otherwise because of the romantic trips and the jealous behavior, but none of it means anything to you.”
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“You’re an idiot, Potter! Did you forget you’re a wizard? You could have hexed that werewolf off me. You didn’t have to pull him off with your bare hands. You could’ve been killed.” Adrenaline was still fresh in his veins. Both from Harry being inside him so recently and the attack.
“Fine. Yes.”
“Do you know how much I love you, Harry?”
____________________________________
Things were getting intense with Harry. Their last coupling, in the closet, had overwhelmed all his senses and infiltrated his brain like some sort of noxious, poisonous gas. It lingered in his mind all day, and hijacked his thoughts, to the point where all he could do, when he went back to his desk, was stare at the papers in front of him. He tried to focus, but he kept reading the same line over and over again, unable to make sense of the words.
Draco got off the bed, hiding a smirk. Putting the collar back in its place, he picked up the plug as well as his favorite bottle of lubricant. Harry’s eyes widened at the sight.
“I’m glad you enjoyed it, pet,” Draco said, amused. “But now there’s a little matter of my satisfaction.”
“I’ll go tell Astoria goodbye, and I’ll see you later. Yeah?”
They sat in silence staring at the warehouse. Blaise’s voice echoed in Draco’s mind. He felt awful. He did not expect it to go that badly and couldn’t think how to make it up to him, as sex was off the table now. The worst of it was his accusations about Harry, which echoed in his mind.
Draco woke up Sunday morning, a man on a mission. Thoughts of heartbreak, over Harry, were far away. The first thing he did was head straight to Gringott’s, where his financial advisor worked, to order a complete audit and to look for suspicious withdrawals.
Draco woke up very early this morning, before dawn, to a tapping sound on his window. A huge snowy white owl flew in when he opened it, dropping a letter on his desk and swiftly flew back out, without waiting for a reply.
“Oh god, yes, sir. Yours.”
Maybe Harry could do this, but he couldn’t. As usual, he got the better of him, but he realized that this wasn’t his intention. He saw that his Harry was trying so hard to be perfect for him and it made his heart ache.
“Good. Get the fuck out of here, then. Leave. And don’t ever come back!”
Harry stood up from the table, the energy building was too much to bear sitting down. He took the collar and threw it hard enough against the wall that the box broke into several pieces and the collar landed pathetically on the ground ten feet away. The clank of the metal against the hardwood floor rang ominously in the hall.
“You’re gonna kill me one day, you know that?”
“I’ll see you at work tomorrow,” he said instead.
with one long rope traveling from his bound wrists to the head of the bed. Harry could not move a muscle.
“Sorry for what?”
“Why are you still not in uniform?”
In an act of sheer terror, Harry cast a
Draco slapped him across the face, not hard, but it still reverberated in the room.
There was no way for Draco to know that this was the last time he would see Harry for several days. He left to Germany the next morning, without so much as a note.
“I’m getting close. Are you ready for my cum?”
“I understand completely, sir. It was an honor to serve you. I’ll go clear out my desk.”
“I know what this is really about. This is about your bloody obsession with Potter! I saw you cozying up with him just this morning and now you’re calling this off? Am I suppose to believe that’s a coincidence?
He pulled at his hair fretfully, hoping Draco would find a way out of this contract, soon. He got heat flashes just thinking that he had any sort of claim on Draco. He would break every bone in his body if he dared touch his dragon. Draco was his and his alone. He didn’t know when this fierce possessiveness over Draco began, but he knew it wasn’t normal. He sensed it from the very beginning of their relationship, since their time in Turkey. It had only worsened with the
Then again, Draco was married too,
Draco took that as a nicer way of saying ‘no.’
Draco rolled his eyes. Harry was making it seem like this was no big deal, just another Monday.
Draco just nodded, not trusting his voice. He remembered the sight of his cum splattering his eyelashes and chin, in the shower, when they were in Turkey. He felt his knees go weak at Harry’s confessions and smooth words. The man rendered him completely powerless and exrutiatingly hard.
He was fucking into him hard and fast now.
“Work,” he answered simply, not meeting his eye. Draco decided not to push it, and Harry continued.
“We have to discuss terms and a contract. You’ll need to be trained, of course.”
“Dear gods, what’s the matter with you? Again?”
He tried to pull out, but Harry wouldn’t let him. He just moaned around his cock in response.
Stopping right in front of him, Harry grabbed his hand to pull him close, but Draco wrenched his hand away. His oaky masculine scent was infiltrating his nostrils, triggering his memories, but he suppressed them. He stepped closer to kiss him, but Draco shoved him away, with all his might, before he could reach his target. He stumbled backwards.
“Wait a tick. Since when do you need to get so dressed up to see Hermione and Ron? And isn’t it late?”
nonverbally. Draco had never seen anything like it.
“You don’t have to, Harry. It’s no disgrace not to like something. We tried, and now we know you don’t care for the club,” Draco said reassuringly. “You don’t need the collar out here.”
There was a time when Blaise calling him “baby” used to ignite his rage, now it only filled him with great sadness. He can’t be Blaise’s baby and knows he suffers for it. He can’t be what Harry needs either, and he can’t decide which of them suffers more. Draco sighs in anguish. All this pain he causes. He doesn’t think himself worth the aggravation. Two beautiful, special men pining over this brooding, selfish half-man.
“Thank you, sir,” Harry whispered.
Wrong. He wasn't into blokes. The truth was he wasn’t into anyone, if they weren’t Draco. He never felt the faintest temptation to stray. Draco made him the happiest man alive. All this, was only to make him happy in return. He’d never been attracted like this to anyone before, man or woman. His smell, alone, was enough to get his cock hard and leaking. He need only stand next to him and inhale. But, he couldn’t say these things. He had a goal.
“Aww Harry. I don’t think it’s at all funny. I was just trying to cheer you up.”
Blaise pauses, turning. “Forgive you?” he asks incredulously.
Get in.”
A pile of condoms glistened in glass in front of her like an obscene candy bowl.  Draco had an idea of what they were used for but found the idea of putting synthetic muggle plastic on top of his dick distasteful. He thanked merlin he did not have to live like that, as he was a wizard and could simply cast protective charms wandlessly not that he would need them tonight.
Blaise blushes.
Throwing his napkin on the table, he pushes his chair back with a loud scrape, and leaves the dining room.
holding out a hand to Draco.
“Sir, I’m suppose to wear these out?” Harry repeated. Even though they were in muggle Paris, he really didn’t want to go anywhere in public dressed like that. And in the collar and cuffs! He always fantasized about wearing the collar in public, but the reality was a bit more jarring than anticipated. A wizard could be there tonight, just as Draco was, and recognize him. It would be so humiliating if he was photographed like this and would certainly make the front page of the Daily Profit where his kids would see. Draco told him he wasn’t planning on changing his appearance for anonymity.
They departed by international portkey to London on Sunday afternoon, and spent the day horseback riding across the Malfoy grounds. Harry had never been more happy in his entire life. He finally had Draco where he wanted him, all to himself. It would be made official tonight. As the wind whipped his hair, he imagined their life together fifty years from now, on these very grounds.
Draco rushed forward to help him stay standing. He grabbed his sweaty body, but Harry was too heavy for him, and he fell to the floor.
The minute the door closed, Harry, practically, ran to reach Draco behind his desk, to give him a searing kiss.
Draco hugged him back.
He’s never minded, in any case. He spent half his time at Hogwarts being hated by the majority of his classmates, first for thinking he was the heir of Slytherin, then for thinking he was an attention whore when his name came out of the Goblet of Fire. In 5th year, everyone thought he was mad for saying that Voldemort had returned. Then, in his 7th year, the entire world hated him as he was dubbed “Public enemy number 1.” He was definitely used to it but was surprised that Draco didn’t mind it either. It only made his heart flutter more as he looked back at him.
Draco’s cock started to harden to half-mast the more he thought of it, against his consent. He had already cum twice today. He willed it down. He was like a randy teenager these past few months; he had no idea what had gotten into him.
“No.”
Draco grins at Hermione, and she beams back at him,.
“Plenty,” Draco pulled him close and kissed him in front of all the museum guests. “I don’t know how I get to call you mine.”
“Couldn’t fucking breath…ah…” he groaned and after two or three more breaths, he sighed.
A loaded question. His
He felt he might die if he waited any longer.
When Draco started shaking, he stopped and flipped him around so that he could enter him face to face. He kissed Draco on the mouth and thrust his tongue inside. The cleaning charms insured he did not have any remnants of Draco’s taste from his previous activity.
He decided to go to the gym that night in an effort to clear his head. When he walked by Harry’s open door, he called after him. Draco retreated back to his office, head bent low. He couldn’t look at him. He would know the truth, just by seeing his eyes.
He had no idea what he would be walking into today, and this made him incredibly nervous. Maybe Harry would work to avoid him all day, in light of his hard cock pressing against his thigh at the gym, and that was something he could live with.
I’m not free to do whatever I like, without anticipating consequences. You're my boss. I’ll lose my job over this.”
“And it’s none of my business. I’m just telling you that Harry probably doesn’t feel it’s right to come to you. All I’m asking for is a conversation.”
By the time there was a knock at his door, announcing Harry’s return, he was fully dressed and back in work mode, studying the case file. He opened the door with it in hand, reading, not looking up to greet Harry, but finally speaking,
“Wrong.
“No one wants to see that,” he’d insist.
“I’m okay Pans,” and she left the room.
Draco is on the verge of exploding. He could hit him, actually throw a punch at him. He was trying to control him again, force his Dom out by inciting his jealousy. Harry could never be a true submissive, not without the collar anyway. The only thing he knew how to be was an enormous pain in his ass, and he considers telling him as much, but he doesn’t want to make things worse. He decides to come at him in a different way. He intentionally lowers his voice and softens it.
The stories never failed to delight Draco. He laughed and gasped at the appropriate moments. Draco always loved juicy gossip.
“Master Malfoy, there are many reporters waiting at the gates requesting entry, but Neech isn’t letting them through.”
Harry stared at him cruelly, not appreciating his dismissive tone, but he did not argue, as he usually did. He walked out, slamming the door closed behind him.
At the mention of her son being taken away from her, Astoria’s voice rose high and strong, for the first time.
“Hang on, pet, and remember where you are—my bedroom with me. This is to find your limits.
“Wait, Draco. Please just listen to me…You drive me mental. You’re just...so fucking sexy and I want you so badly, all the time. I feel myself losing it. I’ve never felt anything like this. Can you really blame me for being upset that you’re spending your evening with another man? One you just fucked, who happens to be in love with you?”
Draco’s so conditioned—such an animal—that hearing his name from Harry’s lips makes his pulse pick up.
When Harry doesn’t do it, he’s scared he’s going to hurt him, Draco shifts around so he’s on his side more, and he lays his cheek against Harry’s throat.
He strokes his cock lightly and a rivulet of precum streams down his shaft. He’s rocking his hips, flexing his legs. Draco thinks of his hard cock straining his boxer briefs as Weasley asks him what’s wrong. Of the careful way he moved about the room with the plug stuffing him.
He put on his robe and answered.
He moved sideways to get away from him but Harry gripped both arms, tight enough to bruise.
Draco dressed in a flurry, not meeting Harry’s eyes. When he went downstairs, his front door mail slot was pouring in letters. He summoned a wooden plank to block them, but then they started pouring out of the fireplace, flying around his parlor.
“You’ve been fucking around with Blaise since 5th year till now and you call it ‘casual’? Sounds like a lot more than that to me.”
It was that flat-faced stranger, a man he’s never met before. He remembers enough from his drunken Sunday to know that the news about Blaise transformed him, and he was slipping further away. If he didn’t have this taken care by the time he returned on Saturday evening, then all would be lost. He’s sure of it.
Blaise furrowed his eyebrows and Draco could literally see a light go out in his eyes. There was no answer from him.
“Get dressed.”
“I think we might be looking in the wrong place for these potions masters. Today, we should go to the Asia side of Turkey. I have a hunch we’ll have better luck there.”
He continued to fuck him hard and fast, but still so deeply.
Neech, the oldest of the house elves, one who came from a long line, serving only the Malfoys, came up to Draco to ask him if he was unsatisfied with the cooking. He clutched his face in his hand, showing off a solid gold ring with the Malfoy coat of arms. Tears flowed freely down his face.
and then Draco came, completely untouched, as Harry leaned down to kiss him. The sound of him begging him, needing him, was just too much.  He moaned into his mouth through his orgasm, and felt a spasm of heat flood the inside of his hole, as he pulled Harry over the edge with him. Harry nearly screamed out a groan as he came, shaking.
“Pardon?”
I want you to have at least one glass of water. You’ll find some ice water on the nightstand. “
Silence.
Draco shrugged in the pillow. Harry grabbed his shoulder so that he turned and faced him.
Unable to curb his curiosity, he turned around to look at his neck. Harry waved his hand to let the glamour fall away.
Parts of this chapter inspired and credited fully to "Deviations: Submission" by Jodi Payne and Chris Owen. You'll have to thank them for such delicious scenery. It's exactly how I imagined our Savior to be. I hope you liked it.
Harry hears the crack of a curse behind him, but before he can turn around he’s shoved so hard, he topples face first ten feet away.
“Does this feel like a cock in love with Potter?”
“I bet. Do you want to have dinner this weekend to celebrate my recovery? We could double, if you like. You, me, Astoria, and Pansy.”
“Look me in the eye and tell me that.”
“Listen Malfoy, it’s not what what you think.”
“What year were you in?”
It was easy to subdue his dominant side while Harry was so close to him, blanketing him with his waves of power.
Finally, his cock was gliding in smoothly and he set a steady pace. He put both hands back on deck and began to move with deep punishing thrusts.
“Draco…I heard the good news! I’m here to celebrate with you. I brought your favorite lube, the edible one.
He undid his trousers to free his erect cock. He spat down on Harry’s buttocks, smearing the spittle across his hole, and then spit in his hand, to coat his cock, before plunging inside Harry’s entrance, all the way to the hilt.
“But Astoria…”
When it was over, Harry was still breathing hard on his chest. He seemed reluctant to part from Draco’s body. Draco immediately felt a wave of exhaustion overtake him as bottoming drained his energy far more than topping ever did. Sleep was quickly approaching. He felt Harry kiss him one last time and lay next to him, cuddling into his side. They both, immediately, fell into a sated sleep.
When they reached the DMLE floor, together, there was a bustle of loud chatter that immediately died down to complete silence as they walked out. Every eye was upon them as they walked towards their offices. Draco averted his eyes and walked forward, calmly. He felt like he was a fish in a fishbowl. It was a horribly uncomfortable feeling, and Draco had the impulse to run to his office, but maintained a calm facade. He felt the weight of hundreds of judgmental eyes upon him.
“So needy.
After a few moments, Harry whispered, “move, please.”
“Stop, Harry. We can’t.”
“Just get on with it, Potter.”
The parlor is warm from hearth as Draco pours them each a glass of firewhiskey. He tries to hand one one to Harry but his arms are crossed and he’s staring impertinently away from him. He sets it down on the table and sits across from him.
Without his spectacles, though Draco was loathe to admit it, his eyes were
to right it once more. He tried to get his breathing under control.
Meanwhile, Harry was moaning in pleasure beneath him and began to push back to meet his thrusts. The sound of flesh slapping flesh filled the air. He was getting close.
“Yes. But there’s more it could do.” With a wave of his wand, it began to vibrate.
______________________________________________
Harry kneeling in front of him with his eyes downcast, rubbing his thighs. Watching Harry suck his cock as he looked up at him with a delicious vulnerability, pupils blown. His chiseled back tensing as he slid home for the first time. His scent, his taste, the sensation of his tight hole clenching.
“But, only for one hour. Just let me get changed first.” Scorpius squealed with joy and Draco chuckled.
He moved to lay next to him, cradling his body. Draco hugged him tightly and rested his head on his chest. He was breathing hard, like someone grieving.
With his heart breaking anew, Draco left his office, feeling more hopeless than ever.
They drank tea in silence. Draco still hadn’t uttered a single word. He couldn’t believe he was sitting here, calmly sipping Earl Grey tea, while his best friend lay in a hospital bed, at the hands of the man sitting across from him.
Harry’s frown intensified, rubbing his hands through his hair.
Still, no response.
Draco peeked behind him to see Harry squeezing his own cock, to prevent an early orgasm, but he was still rubbing it against him.
Draco stops, lulling him into a false sense of security, then standing back to deliver the sharpest blow yet, he brings the whip down with maximum strength right across his ass.
_______________________
“I can’t help it Blaise. You do something to me. I’ve missed you.”
Another wave of his wand kicked up the intensity yet another notch. Harry blew his second load of cum all over his stomach, shivering. After a few minutes, he was still half hard.
“I like it a lot.”
as he drove into him harder still. The obscene sound of flesh slapping flesh filled the room, accompanied by Blaise’s muffled screams, dampened by Draco’s hand, but still loud enough to be heard clearly.
Draco glanced down at the plaque on the portrait and realized something.
“All of life is just one anything. That’s what makes it interesting. Follow on your course and see what all your anythings are gonna be.”
Blaise knew him better than anyone, better than his wife, better than even his parents.
Was that his voice? It came out as a high pitched whimper. Draco was ashamed to hear it sound so breathy, desperate, and worst of all, honest. Harry resumed his slow torturous pace. They were twenty-five minutes in, by now, and Draco was lost in a haze of lust, his inhibitions wiped clean. Suddenly, he couldn’t stop talking. It was like a dam had broken and he couldn’t stop the water crashing through.
“…It can’t be broken if the sub is coerced. Not by me, you, or anyone. It has to come from Blaise alone, because it’s magically binding. It has to be his true decision. The contract will sense it in his magic if he is resistant to it. It won’t hold, even if he says the spell.”
He would have to, both, deliver the news of his divorce and make it clear to him that they could no longer be involved. He did not plan on mentioning Harry, as the man almost beat him to death last week. He hardly knew where to start. This would be a tough conversation.
“I’m thinking about the awful thing I’ll have to do if David isn’t enough. I’ll have to hurt him, Harry.”
Harry started getting angry now. He had forgotten the way Draco viewed him, in light of their happy honeymoon phase. He had lost track of his initial hesitancies about Draco who only saw him as the wholesome hero, not a naughty boy who deserved daddy’s punishment. He was stupid enough to get lost in the feeling of being buried deep inside him, flying high on his love. Draco had not topped him in months, and he remembered that being the top was his natural disposition. Draco always insisted on being the one entered with Harry, and he was only too happy to oblige. He was only now, realizing the significance of that. He had forgotten about it completely because Draco had told him he loved him, and it washed all his doubts away. Now, they were resurfacing with a vengeance, in light of his conversation with Blaise.
He was finally safe.
“Well, this looks cozy,” Harry’s voice rang out.
“Nothing. I just enjoyed seeing your Sunday afternoon picnic.”
Sighing, Draco picked up the flogger and crossed to the trunk that held his toys.
The door opens.
“Fine. How’s Pansy?”
Draco’s ears were burning, just hearing himself. He wished he could burn his retinas, and he’d already experienced it. He could only imagine how Harry felt. He wanted to die before Harry watched a single extra minute of this monstrous performance.
“Breathe, Potter. It’s easier if you breathe.” Draco didn’t recognize his own voice. It was tender, laced with lust and longing.
“You’ll be the death of me, Potter.”
“And give the French another reason to gloat over us by taking my best auror? I think not.”
He looks up at Draco and his eyes are hot with desire. No firewhiskey necessary, Harry feels positively drunk under his storm grey gaze. He sits up abruptly and drags Draco to the bedroom, locking the door behind him and throwing up a silencing charm. Draco is laughing the whole time behind him, but he quickly shuts him up by giving him a deep sensual kiss, gripping his bum tightly.
“Do you think I want to be like this? I’m a wreck…
in the tiny closet, and kissed him, desperately. He used one hand to hold Draco’s face while he plundered his mouth, and used his other to stroke his cock to hardness. Draco’s head swam. He was quickly becoming dizzy at the sensation of Harry’s tongue in his mouth with his palm tugging his cock. He was fully erect, in seconds. He wanted to stop him because they were at work. He needed to stop him, immediately, but the voice of objection quickly became a quiet whisper under Harry’s ministrations.
“I’m going to heal you now,” Draco said.
Draco needed to taste him. He got under the sheets and plopped his cock in his mouth, licking languidly. He felt Harry tense beneath him, finally awake, but didn’t relent.
“God, you’re beautiful…I can’t imagine anyone letting you go.” He kisses him again as Draco’s cheeks suffuse with heat. “And that blush...”
He had never hated himself more than this moment.
The shower was going.
Harry instantly obeyed. A small trickle of pre-cum dripped from Harry’s cock at Draco’s commanding tone. Draco grinned and stroked his cock as a reward for his obedience. He used two hands to pry his cheeks apart and forced his tongue inside his entrance, thrusting it in and out like a lizard. He lubed one finger to put it inside, sure to push down on his prostate every few strokes. Harry shook, pausing, and eventually started pushing back to meet his thrusts. He licked around the rim while preparing him with his fingers.
It reiterated to him that Harry deserved the power in this relationship. He was confused by his willingness and want to sacrifice it, especially to someone like him.
He considered simply not accepting the invitation, but after ditching him the night before, he knew that wouldn’t be possible.
Harry got up unsteadily, standing in display position, once more.
Draco tugs his hand and tugs Harry so he’s lying up against him.
Draco put the bracelet around his left wrist, and it closed immediately. The clasp vanished and it became a seamless infinity band once more. It automatically adjusted to fit his wrist perfectly.
Harry got up quickly to stop him.
Blaise sticks a hand in his shirt and squeezes one to hardness, looking up at him coyly.
“Stop the charade. Why don’t you want to fuck me, Draco? Tell me. It never seemed to be a problem to fuck Blaise for fifteen fucking years, but I’m not good enough? You didn’t cum last night. I felt you go soft, inside me.”
He cursed his reaction as his blush intensified, and he moved out of Harry’s grip to put the horse back in the stables. He summoned his house elf to to tend to her and walked back to the manor, with Harry at his side.
What Blaise wanted was for Draco to divorce his wife and run away with him so they could be together forever. This would never happen, of course. Draco would never abandon his wife and child. He didn’t even know how Draco truly felt about him.
Draco sinks down under the table. “Don’t think I did either.”
Draco fought to catch his breath. He cast a cleaning charm to his bottom and pulled his boxer briefs up, redoing his trousers. He turned and sat on the floor, wincing. His behind was raw from Harry’s brutal treatment, but he decided not to heal it. His cock was still half-hard, despite Harry’s roughness. Harry hadn’t allowed him to cum.
“Maybe it’s time we stop this then.”
“Endless reasons, but mainly, I’m doing this
“Not now, Potter, we have work to do.”
“Oh, you’re speaking to me, now? Congratulations. I would have congratulated you earlier, at the proposal party, but my owl invitation must have gotten lost. Maybe the owl was eaten by a giant eagle. I certainly hope so.”
“You shouldn’t be seen sitting with me, Drake. I have to get back to work, anyway. See you around.”
Draco began to move slowly, very slowly at first, shifting his angle to find his prostate, pleased when he felt Harry shudder and groan when he found his mark.
Then someone is screaming.
“Yes, sir.”
He felt Harry clutch his back tightly at that, his head rubbing Draco’s chest. He let up a bit to slide back on Draco’s cock faster.
He could kill him. The only thing he wants to do is ring his pompous little neck until his head detaches from his body.
Draco chuckled, remembering that Astoria used to say the same exact thing. He marveled at the fact that this too, seemed like a marriage, already, but it was so much better than what he had before. Draco felt like the luckiest guy on the planet to have this comfortable domesticity with Harry. He congratulated himself for resisting those stupid temptations from the weekend and vowed to never think of them again.
“Whether I do or don’t doesn’t matter.”
Then Harry’s hand grabs his hand under the covers.
“The boots, pet. Wait for me here,” he commanded and vanished.
“If it makes a difference, I very much enjoyed our time together. I won’t forget it….now, can I get back to work?”
“Will you, at least, stay with me tonight?”
His nerve endings were firing throughout his whole body sending shockwaves of desire to his brain. Harry slowly pushed in, refusing to pick up the pace, even when Draco slammed backwards. He pushed Draco’s outer leg upwards so that he had full control and
But, he still obliged. He pulled him forward by his hair and started fucking his mouth deeply. He loved hearing Blaise gag when he went too far. He was moaning in rapture around Draco’s cock, loving the rough treatment. It spurred him on to know he was pleasing him, after hearing he had let others in his bed. His sounds were driving him to the edge, but Draco needed to fuck him before cumming in his mouth. He planned to fill his hole with multiple loads tonight.
Harry wipes his face, embarrassed, but they keep coming.
He realized then that he never gave Harry enough, even during sex. He always left it to Harry to tell him how much he needed him, wanted him. Draco wished he could look into his eyes, but now wasn’t the time. Harry wanted it this way, and he promised. He gritted his teeth against an early orgasm, but he was so damn close. He stroked Harry’s hair and pushed his face close to his chest. The sheer pleasure of his velvet heat combined with Harry’s arousal after everything he’d just been through was enough to make him blow right away.
“…Draco, I know about Blaise.”
“Show off.”
It was his own fault, for starting anything with Harry, in the first place.
“Keep him on the yoga magic now, Draco. Might help with his
his entire family. He was working for them against his will and feared for his family’s safety while he was to be held in custody. Draco assured him that he would receive a fair trial and promised protection for his family, taking down the information of their location, and offering comfort for him as he was near hysterics. He used a soft but authoritative voice, one that could be trusted. It managed to sooth him. When he calmed down enough, Draco transferred him to a special cell for non-violent criminals.
“Not here, Blaise. Listen, we should talk.”
He stroked his free hand down Blaise’s back and started whispering sweetly,
She looked like a vision out of a fashion magazine, no matter what she wore, and she was always impeccably dressed. She was often approached to model, but politely declined. Even if she wanted to, she knew that Draco would never allow it. He was very possessive of her and sometimes became angry when men ogled her while out in public.
“Because I raped you!...Did you forget? You were begging me to stop and I kept fucking you into the mattress. You were telling me it hurt, but I kept hurting you.”
“So good…so tight…love this...fuck…could fuck you forever.”
Draco just continued to dress his oyster with vinegar and other toppings before slurping it in his mouth.
He scoffed at him, looking at Draco with livid betrayal, “He’s ready for you now.”
Harry’s chain shook loudly as he shifted angrily. He couldn’t help it. He felt like pulling out his wand and desecrating the entire club to the ground in a whirl of fiendfyre. Draco tightened his hold on the leash as he spoke in rapid French.
Blaise’s eyes light up when he sees him in his perfectly fitted grey ensemble. Draco’s wearing light grey plaid trousers, a white collared shirt, and a fitted matching vest with a silver pocket watch. The chain hangs out of the pocket making him look extremely posh. There was a strict dress code at the Wizarding Country Club and he never passes up a chance to flaunt his style. They shake hands and order drinks. They chat for a while about work and sports. Blaise asks after Scorpius. They’re three drinks in when Blaise mentions it.
“So you won’t,” Draco whispers. “Unless you change your mind.”
Draco put his hands on his ears. He could not stand another moment of the gossip and screaming outside his door. If he went home now, however, it would look suspicious, so he stayed put and tried to throw himself in his work.
“I don’t remember inviting you in.”
Maybe, he was just 'fucked up', the way Harry said. He would not inflict himself on anyone else.
__________________________________________
He walked slowly to the empty couch in the center of the front row and sat down gracefully. The front row was mostly unoccupied save for two men sitting in chairs at opposite ends. Sitting further back insured anonymity as it was cast in complete darkness. The front row was dimly lit by both the bright red light that shined over the sex scene and the light from the entrance. Draco did not mind being seen by these muggles. He relished in it. He took a sip of his drink and observed the scene before him. His cock hardened like a lightening rod.
Harry’s eyes are closed and he’s still trembling, unresponsive.
“I thought you would prefer the more twinky version of my body.”
“I’ll be back later,” he said softly.
He imagined Blaise had not insisted on his attention because their last few interactions had been more than favorable, as far as Blaise was concerned. They had enthusiastic morning sex, only last week, and shared a steamy kiss, the following Wednesday. Draco had kissed him that night, like a man desperate to prove himself. Meanwhile, Blaise had reverted back to impassivity, the way he knew was preferred, waiting for Draco to make the next move, as he always did.
It was all very cordial and they fell into an awkward silence.
He had fallen in love with him, virtually right away.
Blaise remained silent. Perhaps he was shocked at hearing Draco use this pet name again, or he was just really tired.
Ronald Weasley stood at the entrance. Harry was hidden underneath his desk, cock still buried in his mouth, but he stilled.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
“Blaise, please don’t,” he embraced him fully. Blaise collapsed into him, grabbing his shirt, soaking it with tears.
“You want me and all my baggage? Never having privacy when we’re out? Too many cameras everywhere we go?”
Harry hung his head low, ashamed.
He showed him a few more rooms, an upstairs drawing room that still needed to be redone, and finally, ended back in Harry’s room. Harry closed the door behind him and pushed him against the wall to kiss him.
He bowed his head in defeat and couldn’t help but think,
The biggest shock from his time thinking through things in his stripped Paris chateau, is that he’s somehow still worried for him. He should be worried for himself, but all he can think about is Harry on his knees in front of him, crying his eyes out. Thinks of his heaving muscular body in the shower saying,
They did the same to the two guards standing at the entrance.
Draco encouraged him to pick up each tool and test it against his hand, needing him to know what to expect. He knew exactly how all these things felt like when struck on the skin. Draco may have trained Blaise, but Blaise also trained him, in turn. He didn’t just pop into existence as the perfect Dom. He made Blaise use all these tools on him as well, so he would know how they felt, how much strength to use.
Harry stands up and turns his body, crossing his arms. “Can’t it be done by owl?”
Firewhiskey. That’s what he needs. He flexes his hands and realizes they’re blistered—from holding the flogger too tightly. He can barely move the right one. Tears sting his eyes. He lets the damn things fall as he walks into the parlor. Then he drags in a deep breath and lifts his head.
Harry was trembling all over, but he stayed silent, as was commanded.
Blaise is only happy pleasing Draco. He knows it in his bones because he feels the same way.
When he arrived at Blaise’s that night, around 9:30pm, Blaise had put on the works. The entire first floor was lit by soft candlelight and there was an empty bottle of his favorite red wine sitting next to a full decanter, which was holding the wine to let it breathe. Blaise had put out all his favorite snacks too. There were all manner of cubed cheeses, an entire charcuterie board with five different kinds of olives, and all different kinds of nuts.
“Good,” said Draco.
The half a heart couch. Harry laughs at that.
“I know about you and Harry.”
“You can touch it, but you must never put it on. That’s my job.” He winked.
A server came to the table with a tray, unloading the glasses of scotch, while the owner’s sub kneeled behind Mr. Wolfe’s chair.
His voice was soft, lacking a bit of its usual confidence.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Hands behind your back, hold your wrists—yes like that. Good. When I ask you to 'display' I’ll want you like this. Feet spread and arms back.”
“Who wants to be right? I, for one, would rather be a little fucking wrong. Better to be wrong with the right person than right with the wrong one.”
Harry looked up to face Draco who closed his eyes and pretended to sleep.
“Did you have breakfast already? I’m starved and there’s a case I need to discuss with you. Let’s go to the cafe around the corner.”
Draco picked up on his message quickly. He grabbed the back of Blaise’s head with both of his hands and set the pace, driving into his wet willing mouth slowly at first and watched his cock disappear into it over and over again. He began to quicken his deep thrusts as his fingers tangled in his beautiful thick black hair.
“Everyone? One lone psycho shouldn’t dictate our lives, Harry. I checked in with Shacklebolt and he told me the guy was drawing pictures of you in his cell. Not everyone is so cuckoo. And I’m not exactly a helpless damsel.”
Harry locked eyes with him, hoping he was doing it right.
“Fine, Drake. Whatever you want, love.”
“And where’s that Potter? Having boring sex, by candlelight, no doubt, every single night?”
His Wednesday night had been spent, instead, worshipping every inch of Harry’s body in his bedroom, for hours. Draco blushed, remembering what they had done, as it had been a particularly steamy night. Astoria had Scorpius for the night, and they were free to do as they pleased until morning. Draco decided to make the most of it.
“For merlin’s sake, Draco. You’re getting the bed all wet.”
Draco bent his head low as Harry resumed his pacing, working himself up into a rage.
He continued to whip him hard, but he could tell Blaise was enjoying it through the sounds of
Draco turned his head, even more pissed off at being reminded that his future wife took precedence over him. Blaise seemed to not notice anything amiss and chatted amiably with Draco over drinks. They were four drinks in, and Blaise still had not remarked on Draco’s appearance or made a single lewd comment. He certainly was not begging to be fucked. He treated him impassively, like a regular friend, although his tongue had loosened considerably. The man could never hold his alcohol.
lunch together at that table nearly every day for ten years, but Draco had not sat there for six months. Sensing his presence, Blaise looked up and locked eyes with him.
“Take off your shirt.”
He was NOT in love with
He entered the kitchen to find Harry at the stove.
Blaise didn’t give him a chance to recover before thrusting his cock back into his mouth and setting a fast, deep pace.
He pressed his face into his back as he picked up the pace. Harry’s back was soaked with sweat, drenching his shirt. It clung to his face, but Draco thought it the most erotic thing, of all. He wanted to bathe in Harry’s sweat if it meant he could keep pounding into him. He was making a lot of noise, despite himself, grunting loudly as he worked the man beneath him.
“I swear, sometimes I don’t know who the kid is. You or Scorpius?”
“Oh, fuck,” Harry gasps.
Draco pulled him over his knees by his arms, tipping him over to arrange him so that his ass was presented high in the air, with Harry’s head down by the floor, his feet off the ground, so he could get no leverage to push himself up. He pinned Harry left arm between their bodies and grabbed his right wrist twisting it up behind him and holding it at the small of his back.
This slow, sensual fuck was like torture for Draco. He was forced to realize right then, as Harry feasted softly on his neck, licking, kissing, sucking, and nibbling from behind, that maybe, just maybe, this was more than sex.
This turned out to be a fruitless endeavor. After searching many hours through the night, they hadn’t been able to uncover so much as a paw print in the snow, let alone a pack of human werewolves. The storm was too heavy for them to find anything. They could hardly see their feet in front of them.
A howler started smoking on the table. Draco was in shock. He could not do anything but watch the envelope smoke, until it burst opened.
“Harry, don’t. Please, don't cry. I love you.”
“Yes sir, I have. I’ve been thinking about it for weeks.”
“Magic.”
Harry leads him carefully into the bedroom—where they’ve been sleeping the last two nights with Harry angled away so he won’t “tempt them” with his cock. As if Draco’s not hard as granite, too.
and they’re alone again.
When he arrived on the floor of the DMLE, it was almost completely empty. It was a Saturday and there had been no critical arrests. He walked right passed the head Auror’s door which was wide open, looking straight ahead. He picked up speed when he neared his own office and closed the door quickly behind him.
moaning loudly. His pubic hair tickled Draco’s nose as he felt cum splatter down his throat.
He nodded again.
“For merlin’s sake Draco, contacts. It’s a muggle thing. You’re going to make me late. I don’t question you endlessly when you leave the house, even when it’s to go see your ex-lover.”
“Then why did you marry Astoria?”
Paris turned out to be a wonderful idea. Draco took to him to an extravagant dinner Friday evening and made love to him sweetly in front of floor-to-ceiling windows displaying the Eiffel tower. He took his time, bringing him to orgasm four times over the course of a few hours. Wanting to remind Harry that they were more than just Master and slave.
“Do you want to be?” Draco laughs.
He snapped his fingers and turned invisible, then undid the locking charms and waltzed out of the door.
“We just have to be careful. I can’t take any chances with you, Draco. If anything happens to you—“
“Let’s go take a nap pet.”
Draco strokes his hip. “Go sit down. I’ll make something for us. You didn’t get to have lunch, Auror Potter.”
He left the door slightly ajar but still chained, so that it couldn’t be opened all the way, and turned around to look for the file.
Stay still. I want to try something,” and he leaned his face closer, doing the unthinkable.
The result was a damaged unrecognizable room, in a state of ruin, not unlike Draco, himself.

The man was his kryptonite.
Scorpius rolled his eyes and finished with, “women, honestly!”
Draco couldn’t think of anything but the blood rushing to his cock as Harry swirled his tongue around it. His hands were clutching at the wall behind him and his eyes were closed.
His memory was sluggish. He could not remember a single thing from last night and did not recognize his surroundings. Did I cave and take Blaise on another impromptu getaway? he thought, as he swore off drinking forever.
Harry sighed in relief as the hard hand that had punished him began to stroke his heated skin, soothing away the sting that had flagged his erection. He was aware of the throbbing warmth of his backside starting to flow towards the front, and his cock slowly filled again.
They kiss, so long and soft and slow, and then they’re twined together. Draco brushes his lips over his cheek.
He took pity on the man and began sucking his cock as he placed two fingers inside now, brushing his prostate. Harry immediately blew into his mouth with a shout.
Hard punishing thrusts began in ernest. He began ramming into him immediately, with his hand on his hips, not pausing a single second. Harry didn’t make a sound. He was tensing extremely tightly around Draco’s cock. The only reason Draco was even able to get inside, was by sheer force.
He stood and grabbed Draco around the waist, before he could even consider, and apparated them both to the bedroom.
Draco held him tightly in his arms, and they both lay awake, staring at the full moon.
She reminded him of Astoria, then. But he was unperturbed.
“Of course I am Draco. What a silly question. What makes you say that?”
He cast the preparation charms and breached his entrance, carefully. Harry moaned. Draco paused when he was fully seated inside, leaning forward so that he was flush against his back. He covered Harry’s hand against the wall with his own, intertwining their fingers. Turning Harry’s head to kiss him from behind, he started moving slowly.
“You didn’t lock the door? You’re going to get us caught, Potter!”
Draco is looking at him, smiling just a little.
Seeing Harry defend him against those reporters, today, only increased his love for him, as if that were even possible. He was bursting to tell him, but this was not the right moment. It would seem like he was telling him as a last ditch effort to keep him close, in these desperate times.
