"It doesn't," Draco snapped, and tried to shove his hands off the Firebolt. Harry just caught his hands, and kept hold of them. "What are you doing? Don't you have something better to do?"
From the way Aberforth scoffed, that had hurt rather than helped their cause. "Oh, yes, now that you've entrusted the new school to
"Okay," Draco said, knowing he shouldn't agree, but said it nonetheless. "No need to beg any further, Chosen One, this is getting embarrassing. Now, come on, then. I believe I have some Muggles to terrify for you."
, then ripped it clear off and tossed it away, where it flew somewhere down the steps of the amphitheater. Then his hands were on Draco's neck again, squeezing.
"Eleven OWLs, Hermione, are you mad?" Ron gaped, but Bill behind them got this modest, secretive smile. Ron whirled his head reflexively to look at him, and then scowled. "Oh, yeah, Bill and Percy both got all twelve OWLs, so I guess you could, theoretically... but you'll have Quidditch back this year, Draco, and you've never taken Care of Magical Creatures either..."
"Kind boy... kind master..." Wormtail was crawling now like he was still a rat, and he called Ron his master the same way that Draco had heard him call Voldemort-
"Will he go after you?" Harry's eyes widened in abject fear. "Are you going to be in trouble because of me? We were fighting the Death Eaters, fighting for our lives- are they going to punish you because I won't help them? I don't want you to be sent away to Azkaban-"
Newly-felled towers that must have been taller lay in great shadowed stacks of stone under the rising moonlight. That must be what gave the illusion that the ruins went on forever. You could only make out hints, between these great leaning piles, of the great altitude and the steep view down, the piercing blue of surrounding lakes, or even the fading purple-dusk sky, filling each time you looked it with more unsettlingly clear stars.
. He'd hated causing pain, when it came to being forced to use Cruciatus by the Dark Lord. He would have thought anything close to torture would have once again made his skin crawl and breath seize up. Instead, he simply felt a condescending amusement.
"The brothers lingered to learn more of magic from Luna. The impetuous and gallant first brother Pictor fell in love, with the bright beauty Sola, who had so boldly summoned them. He asked for her hand in marriage, she accepted, and the wedding was set to be held in Eros's village. Sculptor had declared he would never love other than Estella, and Pavo the Hundred-Eyed had declared he never meant to wed, however much Luna would watch him, when she did not think she could be seen." Grindelwald's smirk had a world of implications in it, a brief human intrusion into the near-biblical tone. "So the brothers returned to their own village, where all their kin were long dead, to retrieve their mother's wedding ring and all her trousseau for Sola. Except it was the time of year where the river between their villages was highest, and the banks most flooded, and it is there we find the brothers acting in defiance of death."
"Dantanian," Draco said, and took a deep breath. He remembered how Bellatrix had kissed the talon wand, calling it Dantanian, after she took it from him. He took the wand and kissed both sides, just to be sure, but nothing happened. "Dantanian, I've seen- part of who you were. I'm sure there's more. I'll listen to whatever you want to tell me. When I- when I called myself a monster, I didn't mean you were. Just me. I mean, you turned a seven-year-old into a Dementor, but, like, you had your reasons?"
for it," but he didn't seem able to make Harry laugh. He considered asking if Harry knew about the talon wand and Antipodean Opaleye, but Harry had more immediate fears.
Draco felt like he was going to be sick. At least she said Riddle hadn't played into it too much. But even how much he had made Draco want to find whatever remained of that diary and bring it back to life to kill it again. "Luna, that's normal when you're in love. Even if you're super young, if you like someone a lot, you'll get curious, even if you don't know what it means-"
"Potter," Draco interrupted dryly, "You are holding up my lessons most severely. Now stuff your face. You and your crippling fear of Dementors are required in order to further my education." Even if his first attempt had proved just as Squib-like and useless as Lupin had described Aunt Bella's.
But they did have something the Slytherin side didn't: Sirius and Remus, sitting beside Professor McGonagall near the front chattering genially. They hadn't changed into Gryffindor colors, their robes still plain black, but where they were sitting still told a story. It must be a measure of how much the older Slytherins hated their own team, that they were dedicating so much energy to catcalling and hissing at the Kingsnakes, rather than dedicating even some of that energy towards the spectacle of the most famous man in the country over in enemy territory.
Ah, Severus's warm and fuzzy teaching style, who could beat it? Draco stooped over the first cauldron and felt the same mix of thrill and trepidation this potion always gave him.
gifted at your studies... but when you try to plan, you so often fail, reckless as you say, and act often without the calculation and clear thought of Ravenclaw..."
Draco glanced reflexively at Blaise, but somehow, he just hovered there letting Pucey take that tone with his girlfriend, not protesting. And Draco could never get Blaise to shut up. "There's no official rule that girls aren't allowed to play on the Slytherin team. Anyone can try out who's second-year or up, that's the rule. So anyway, as I was saying-"
"Expelliarmus, you condescending prick!" Ron shouted defiantly back, and Draco yelled Expelliarmus in return. The two streams of red light crashed together, and Neville gasped. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco could see Neville clinging in terror to a comforting Luna.
"Langlock!" Draco called, casting Severus's spell against the man he hated, and the bright light impacted, throwing him backwards. Maybe Draco should have run then, but he saw Black's hand go up to his throat at once and thought,
As for your question of anti-love potions or spells, it's an interesting idea. I don't know anything about it, though, even in dark magic terms. My first instinct, and Remus agrees with me here, is that it's probably impossible. If love can't be created by magic, it would make sense that it can't be destroyed by it, either. Humans do well enough at that part ourselves.
Ultimately, as the defensive scrimmage ended, Draco had the satisfaction of remaining unscathed.  Handsome Higgs had taken at least three hits. That would have to be slowing him down by now. But Draco was dealt his own hit to shake him, as merciless an impact as any Bludger to the back. The stands were not as empty as he had originally thought. Either their spectator had climbed into place after the start of tryouts, or he had been there all along, lurking in Draco's favorite spot, the shadow that hung depending over the wall by the stands. It had been the other way around in first year, but now Potter was the one sitting under the shadow, watching.
"Okay," Draco said, and looked about. He once again provoked the girls' shrieks when he called, "Hermione! What? She's my best friend!" It hit him that Pansy might not relish the idea of playing on a team with a Muggleborn girl, or at least one she had once so publicly called Mudblood. But Hermione just came over smiling, looking surprised but happy to be picked.
"Here we are," Shacklebolt said, leading them right from the underground passage to the most closed and private of the Ministry's holding cells. Severus looked around carefully several times before leading Draco in. "Take as long as you need," Shacklebolt called, and shut the cell door behind them.
"Nymphadora Tonks," he said with a smile. "I learned Lacarnum inflamari, from watching you shoot fireballs at me. And I taught it to Harry..." She appeared, and he knew not to put in 1998 as her year of death this time, but it sat on him like a new guilt of omission, the things he knew and could not say. Except he had tried to tell Severus that he would die, that both the men beside him would die, and they hadn't listened, because he couldn't tell them how he knew.
"You have the attention span of a soused Niffler," Severus observed, though his sharp gaze was softened by that unusual feel of comfort to him. "I am trying to assist
"In all probability," Severus said, looking to be hiding a continued distaste at the prospect. "There will have to be a trial. There was never one in the first place, that will be in his favor. And you may have to testify, as may many of your friends, even myself. Which I will, if you ask it of me, Draco. It can be explained to the Dark Lord as necessary to maintain my cover with Dumbledore. And having Harry Potter speaking for Black should help. Whether Potter is enough to convince the world the Dark Lord is back,
"One," Draco said, "You're making me gag, so stop. And two, how is it any business of yours who I fancy anyway, unless you're on the hunt for rivals because
"How will we know if it's worked?" Harry asked, going over to Grindelwald's side as if the sundering of the bond would be somehow visible. Perhaps it would be palpable to Grindelwald, though. They all peered at Grindelwald, who let out a strangled cry.
He trailed off, and Draco wanted to burn the entire world down, from just how badly he knew he had been played.
Draco wanted a shirt for a striker, since it sounded the most like Seeker, although Hermione said a closer equivalent to Seeker in terms of physique and speed might be a winger. That sounded promising, until she informed him the name was deceptive and wingers did not, in fact, fly, and then he was back to wanting a striker's shirt. She said Ian Wright was Arsenal's best striker, which Draco doubted due to the number of his shirts unbought compared to players around him.
But Draco wasn't allowed in to see Blaise in the hospital wing, which wasn't encouraging. Though he might have also goggled at Madam Pomfrey in a more unfriendly a manner than he meant to, in the wake of seeing her in Severus's memory last night.
Gilderoy seemed to want to hug him, but not to dare. Instead, he hugged Draco's arm, seizing it with fur-covered arms and babbling his thanks so profusely, Draco was grateful when Remus Apparated them out. Draco went up the stairs to change, only to stop halfway up when he realized he had made the worst mistake possible under this roof. He'd left Severus and Sirius alone together.
"I won't change it. It never will. Not unless you want it to. Listen, I'm sorry if I haven't been a good enough friend to you, or- a friend at all, really, and I haven't trusted you enough, I know, but- I swear I've
Except one Dementor wasn't fleeing, and then Draco saw it wasn't a Dementor. The hooded figure had pale hands, not scaly gray ones, as he bent over Harry's helpless figure.
And it was gorgeous, though admitting that would be playing to the wrong crowd. "I can use it as material for some of my transfigurations," he said nonchalantly, and from the indignant squawk behind them, it sounded like he had just lost any allegiance he had gained off Kreacher.
"Ve vill not have that!" Krum exclaimed, and committed to Saturdays for the near future. Draco told him not to spread it around, fearing Potter's jealousy, though of course Ron told Potter right away anyway.
"Not at all, Viktor," Draco said, exchanging a worried look with Luna. "Actually, we're here to help you. See, this here is Luna, my cousin. She's a Ravenclaw, and very intelligent. Her father's a newspaper owner, you might have seen her in a dress covered in
"Cannon!" he bellowed, as if it was solely Ron's fault that Harry was a walking wet dream. Chastened, Draco went behind the screen to put his own suit on. Which, as the mirror was happy to inform him, suited him far less than the others, with his marked pallor.
Draco couldn't help but laugh, much as he'd resolved to be as civil as possible. Respect would help win his way into Lockhart's confidence, gain him loyalties where so few others would show any regard, like picking up an unwanted chess piece for the dragon's side of the board. "No, Professor, he's not. You've heard Voldemort is back?" Lockhart flinched at the name but nodded. "Anything much else about the wizarding world?" Lockhart shook his head.
Draco shoved the hemorrhaging red form aside with his foot, barely seeing him in his haste to drag a bloodied Sirius away. "Remus!" he called, and once he dragged Sirius down the hall and to the side, so far the body was out of sight, he did the same for Remus, tunnel vision on getting his uncles to safety. Then he fell gasping beside them, his last energies spent. "He was casting the Killing curse... the wands... here," he groaned out, and threw out all five wands on the wood before them to let them find their wands.
Tony stood by watching, ready to shield himself, as Draco ripped it to pieces, removing the protective enchantments before transfiguring the wood to a more brittle quality. He cast Expulso, Reducto, and Confringo in turn, and used Ninguifors to turn the wooden splinters to snow, snow he then melted and dried over piles of other discarded wood, before repeating the process twice more, and then he gave it some jets of fire for good measure. Tony learned the Ninguifors charm for his troubles. Draco left that night with security that whatever came this year, even if it was Death Eaters at Hogwarts, it would not be through the vanishing cabinet.
Draco promised Hermione he would write to Potter and send a present for his birthday. He hesitated, before deciding there was no harm in sharing readily researchable information, and ended the letter with,
"I would have thought," Dantanian whispered with a show of patently false bravado, "That a Periander would be made of sterner stuff." He spoke louder to take over dictation.
Draco could see the dark amusement in Severus's gaze. "He is taking the rejection maturely, as I believe he would have from the start, should he not have been so foolish as to make his declaration when severely inebriated. Mr. Nott is usually a sensible, strong-minded young man, who was not at his best last night. I hope that on your part, you will not seek further retribution against one of my very few other students likely to receive an O on his Potions OWL."
"No, that was a joke, you great Horklump," Draco sighed, and pivoted on the chair's arm to poke at Harry's scar. "You need to get better at reading me if we're going to keep at this..."
Draco couldn't figure out why everyone was going crazy during the Durmstrang arrival, until he eavesdropped on the girls and heard them cooing over Krum. To him it seemed self-evident that Krum should be here- after all, someone had to be Durmstrang champion, and take Hermione to the Yule Ball- but they didn't know that, and he was the weird one, unimpressed by the boy who'd caught the Snitch in the last World Cup final. Which had, after all, won Draco a very satisfying bet.
He had to use the talon wand again, to clear off the melted soot and ashes from his bed and his skin. And heal the burn the swift implosion had left. He almost expected it to leave an angry red mark no matter what he did, like the talon brand, but it healed up more than fast enough. With a healing charm Severus had taught him.
"You, Potter?" Draco said with a scoff, trying to hide how stricken he was. "You don't even know what a wizard's duel is." He had wanted to stay unnoticed until he could get home, but it seemed he was on his way to earning Potter's old hatred back. "So really, if you're finished-"
But it couldn't be pleasant without foreknowledge, even with the mass disruption caused by Weasley's Wildfire Whiz-Bangs. And the fact that every professor seemed to relish making Umbridge get rid of them without lifting a finger themselves. Draco himself was having a grand old time witnessing the chaos, without any obligation to stop it or fear for its results this time.
Draco could have hit him. "Harry," Draco whispered, "If you're going to patronize me, I'd just as soon as offer a kiss for luck to the Ravenclaw eagle knocker."
"No, it's just..." Luna chewed on her lower lip. "I don't want something I did to be the reason this doesn't work and you get hurt, or Harry gets killed, or..."
"I remember you and Hermione just didn't seem to talk much. But then I told you to keep her company when I went home for Easter, and she brought you in about Uncle Sirius, didn't she?"
The crowd's hysteria rose to a new pitch, and then with a sweeping gesture of his arm, the letters disappeared from the sky, and flew onto the trophy, where a bright sparkling made it clear they were being engraved. Dumbledore clasped Harry by the shoulders, said something in his ear that looked very proud, and stepped aside.
"Ronald Weasley," Draco said, taking both shoulders firmly, "You kissed her. She kissed you. I don't care if the two of you have been too chicken to talk about it. If you're going to try and kiss someone, kiss
the real Heir of Slytherin and stop the attacks. Thank you for bringing that to the court's attention."
, the liaison between Hogwarts and Xaphan. The headmaster had an 'urgent message' for Lockhart that he
"The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter. Quite astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes... snakelike, in fact."
Draco had gone into this with such a high opinion of himself. He hadn't reckoned on his own extreme lack of patience. "Don't play dumb," he snapped. "That's the last thing
Harry was dressed in the dress code of nice Muggle clothes that Draco had imposed. His burgundy button-down was unbuttoned at the collar, his black slacks close-fitting, hair in about as much of a semblance of order as possible, and he stood there surrounded by small glowing fires and flowers. He had scarcely ever looked more like something out of a fairytale, even with the bloodied sword of Gryffindor in his hand.
"Here," he said, taking Harry's hand again, and led him to his bed. He opened the curtains with a wave of his wand. "One second," he said, and began fumbling at his wings, trying to remember the incantation to unseal them from his back. "You can wait in there."
Sirius had admitted to Draco privately that he and Remus feared, even if his trial next month did go as planned, Dumbledore would still not allow Sirius to formally adopt the boy and make this his permanent home. And thinking of that, Draco had to fight off the miserable mix of longing and regret and relief it sent through him, that Harry was unlikely to appear at Grimmauld anytime soon.
While one experiment in changing the past had succeeded, and Draco's third-best leather shoes had been salvaged, this first major lapse in blending in since the Sorting Hat debacle was not to be without its own damages. Worse ones, even, than Longbottom's stuttered attempts at thanking him the next few times he saw him. The bliss Draco felt arriving in the library after Herbology with Ravenclaw was short-lived when his table was infested by undesirables, alerted by his wand almost seeming to thrum and get hotter in his pocket. Namely an undesirable Mudblood, who dropped a tome the size of a cauldron on the table before dramatically opening it.
your greatest shame?" she said with a queasy smile, before regaining her self-control. "You say you changed your mind because you saw Pettigrew. Yet it should not escape anyone's notice that there have been
"The Cruciatus curse," Draco was forced to say, the natural next in the sequence, but Crouch's one good Polyjuiced eye lit up with so much triumph that Draco feared he had seriously miscalculated.
"It is the night," Severus informed him, "Of the sixth. You have been asleep since you were recovered last night. You will stay tonight, no arguments. No doubt the Gryffindors will be sniffing around here asking after you tomorrow morning. And you may be pleased to know, or perhaps not, that in Potter's absence tonight, Gryffindor has lost their match with Ravenclaw."
"I'll become an emancipated minor, obviously," Draco bit out. "I'll be of age in less than a year. I should have applied to become one even before I got disowned." Each time he said the word disowned, it felt like another small stab. He told himself every time that he didn't care, and it never made it any more true. "And I'll get on that, I know I have to answer the Ministry, just- not today-"
" She looked ready to explode at that. "Yes, I know about that too. I know everything about you. So you could lose more than your mouth if you cross me. Good day, Miss Skeeter." He rose to his feet while she trembled in her seat.
"They're rather similar, don't you think?" Granger interrupted excitedly. "Wasn't the First Wizarding War involved with all these blood disputes? Like the Muggle American Civil War. I wonder if Professor Binns would accept an essay on the topic for extra credit-"
"I haven't wanted to bother you before you were done your OWLs," she said, so nervously that Draco feared she was about to try and back out of being a flower girl. Lucky they still had Girl Weasley for the task. Hermione had thought it was Remus being nice, doubling up on the positions of ringbearer and flower girl to give all the Hogwarts students an official role in the wedding. But Draco had suspected, and still maintained, that Remus was wise enough to know it was best with this lot to always have yourself a spare.
"Listen," Harry interrupted, and everyone fell respectfully silent. "Look. I... I don't want to sound like I'm trying to be modest or anything, but... I had a lot of help with all that stuff..."
"Um," Viktor called in his quick fluent German, "Hello? Attention!" They quieted, looking back to their Seeker with their young, mainly German faces owl-eyed with fear. "I just have one more thing to say. It is possible we will lose, and possible we will win. I am not as sure we will win as our manager." There was derisive laughter, seemingly at their manager's expense, that Viktor didn't look to have expected. But soon, he plowed on. "But I just wanted to let you all know, there
It was child's play to beat Diggory, when playing against a Seeker who had not already played out this exact match. Draco had caught the Snitch the first time, and he did again, although the score of 210-80 didn't exactly bode as well as it could for their overall points tally. But from the looks of the match, things would only have worsened for the Nimbus-less Slytherin team.
"I'm sorry," Harry said, eyes fixing on him with determination in the dim light, gaps in the wood letting sharp beams of gold from the sunset filter through. "I had no idea. I didn't mean to jerk you around, I swear."
or I wouldn't have intervened and put you in charge of my family's castle, the only family I have left who hasn't disowned me.
in all this about unrest at the cup final," he said grumpily. "Your father's kept you out of all of it, has he? While my father just gets raked over the coals whenever..."
"What are you up to?" Hermione asked when he sat them down at Gryffindor. Her damn sharp nose for Draco's plotting. For the hundredth time, he considered letting her in on his fears. But he knew she would likely have a similar reaction what Severus probably would: even if she did believe him, he'd get some mixture of berating him for keeping it to himself so long, arrogantly taking too much on himself, and ordering him to leave such matters to more qualified intervention, like by the teachers. Well, he had Luna, and that would have to be enough.
"He did," Gilderoy said defensively, and unrolled the sleeve of his robe, his fur a great mass like an exotic animal on the sofa laid beside him. "See?" It did not look like any of the scars had gone, but they may have been more faded than Draco had remembered. "He's been trying different herbs and ointments. I'm sure it must seem very pathetic to you, someone who once claimed to be such a great wizard, going to Severus for help with
after me over your stupid old grudge if you really cared that much- you're the only father I've ever really had, and even
Massive press coverage was anticipated. Without an underage defendant, the press would be allowed inside, although theoretically kept under restraint. Once again, Harry would be there in court, this time as a witness for the defense. Meanwhile, Fudge would be calling the coroner who had analyzed the body of Pettigrew, Hit Wizards from the squad that arrested Sirius, Sirius himself, and, distressingly enough, Remus.
Draco leaned his head on Harry's shoulder, and alternated between watching Ron and Hermione or Luna and Tony, and other dancers, fully contented. Harry whispered endearments, calling him
often said how they were similar. Seeing from the outside now, Draco could understand the pain, of someone you cared about throwing up this ridiculous but earnest barrier of
"What, seriously?" Draco complained, trying not to roll his eyes at the friend who would be responsible for his survival in so many senses today. "You've been seeing me, like, everyday this break. What, did you think a stranger had showed up in my room?"
"I think I'm going to be sick," Draco gasped. "Where- is there a bathroom- never mind, I'll find one." Or a convenient potted plant, if the impending fit ended in puking.
Draco could hardly listen after that, only nodding weakly in agreement to use Sectumsempra if he must kill. He could hardly resist the urge to tell Severus he had used Sectumsempra for Grindelwald, as if to receive House points for his judicious choice of killing methods.
"The banishing charm," she ordered, and he duly cast Depulso and sent the beret flying away. "Vermillious," she said, and he sent up red sparks, unable to hide the boredom on his face, while Flitwick beamed in naive pride. On it went, through the third and fourth-year charms, until Umbridge seemed to realize she was getting nowhere, and went on to things he shouldn't have to know at the start of fifth year.
"That's up to you, Draco," Remus said, "Who you want to have blast your parents from the tapestry. But we have a name to change. Yours."
Harry gasped like he was so happy he could cry, pulling Draco tightly against him, holding him up, when he could not have fully stood on his own.
Meaning that Draco could produce snakes to choke the life out of you for the fun of it, while Ron was sometimes hard-pressed to produce his own
Draco gave an awkward little wave, walking towards the savior of the Wizarding world covered in the blood of the Basilisk he'd slain. He was embarrassed to admit the cause of his own state.
"And whom," Dumbledore said quietly, "Do you believe he would send to replace me? A returning Dolores Umbridge, perhaps?"
There were rumbles that Quidditch would be back at some point, with Hufflepuff double-booked. Their match with Gryffindor would have to be played, and then their final match with Slytherin, which had been due to be at the end of May, presumably moved back later. Draco could hardly believe he had just saved the Boy Who Lived from a giant spider with an Unforgivable, and yet he was still somehow expected to go right back to
About your issues with anger. Believe me, I know a thing or two about anger. For the first few years in Azkaban, I don't know if I felt much else besides anger, and grief and cold. And I'm not going to be the person to try and prescribe you with anger management, or cute little breathing exercises or any of that shit. Spite, resentment, all of that can be useless self-destructive poison, if it's directionless. It can turn upon yourself. Or you can turn it outward.
"Scared? Of you?" Draco breathed. Harry's hands hadn't moved from Draco's face, or Draco's from the nape of Harry's neck. "
who requested this demonstration," he said, crisp and posh and calm, "Of which of the two of us is a liar." He made a show of casting his spell then as congenially and leisurely if he was remarking upon the weather. "Cauterizo."
path he had taken to Voldemort's defeat? Leaving aside what it would do to Harry personally, finding out one of his very first father figures was tainted, and robbing him of an attachment so strong, it seemed to help define what it meant to him to
He reached back into his past memories, inwardly sneering at all saw before finding that there was only one person he was aware of that owned an invisibility cloak. And was the only person who might be stupidly brave enough to spy on him.
After her speech was finished, the students were finally dismissed and just before Draco could make his way to bed, he found he had the unwanted task of showing the first years to their dorm.
Both of them had lost their wands in the room of hidden things, and so were powerless to defend themselves from all the dangers a battle bought.
Blaise looked a little surprised. “Yes, but she’s only allowed one letter per week... something about security measures.”
Crabbe shook his head, apparently not having forgiven him, "C'mon. Let's go find Potter." He applied a dissolusion charm to himself and disappeared. Draco watched as Goyle did the same thing, then the door beside Draco where he had been opened.
The anger swelled in Draco’s mind and he felt himself launching his body towards Potter, resisting the urge use of magic, but wanting to hurt him anyway. The animalistic hatred having almost full control. It wanted to punch Potter. He tried to yank back against it, and managed to stop himself from hitting Potter- physically stumbling in the attempt. His face burned as Weasley laughed loudly.
“Well,” he licked his lips nervously “Without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job... perhaps impossible. I couldn’t guarantee anything.” He was obviously telling the truth, but Draco could not take that as an answer. He sneered and got closer to Borgin, making the man even more frightened. “No? Perhaps this will make you more confident.” Draco pulled up his sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark. Borgin’s face turned from nervous to terrified and he let out a small gasp of surprise.
“Fine, let’s talk about it over lunch shall we?” He asked, gesturing to the bright street next to them.
No loud bangs or shouts as there had been before. It was very unlikely that Voldemort would be late...and yet another minute passed.
He felt well and truly awake. He had gone to sleep at some time around 1 pm the previous day. In fact, he marvelled at how long he had slept, usually these days it was something close to 3 or 4 hours.
Draco knew that Snape was distracted and took the opportunity. He had made himself out to be weak but now revealed the strength he had been building when he slammed against Snape and forced him out.
Draco knew Snape would want a full fill in on his situation, in a place not filled with Death Eaters, unwanted ears and occasionally the Dark Lord. He sighed, not looking forward reliving his memories of the holidays and glanced at his timetable.

“It was lots of fun” He didn’t mention that the alcohol he had ingested had definitely been responsible for that.
“Draco, dump your stuff. We have to go to the Prefects carriage,” Pansy drew him out of his thoughts which were currently about finding out if the lips were indeed as soft as they looked. He nodded at her and a minute later they were walking towards the Prefects carriage.
The crowd buzzed around him, and after a minute or two of speculation, Krum was dragged out looking unconscious, or close to it.
Draco nodded back at him, and climbed into the warm carriage, thankful to get out of the cold night air. He would research the Thestrals later.
” The minister was corrupted by his Father, and as his father had appointed this ugly looking bitch, there was no way she was remotely good.
Snape sighed again before speaking “To be truthful with you, I don't know. But something is brewing.” He frowned seemingly finished with his ominous speech, “Come see me in my office tonight at the usual time, and I will review your progress.”
Poor, Draco. Finally had something going for him, and then that literal mind fuck, but I guess it worked out.
As soon as they had ordered the food Draco slipped out of the back door with the excuse of going to the toilet.
“Good plan,” said Harry sarcastically. Draco watched his eyes dart around. Looking for a way out. He began edging slowly backwards.
This is going to be the last chapter for awhile- 2-4 weeks. Im in finals time and everything is stressssss
Setting a smirk on his face, he leaned over Harry, his breath catching at the closeness. He forgot what he was doing for a second.
He slipped his mind into the asshole part of him that he had long ago shoved in the back of his mind. Bringing it out felt disgusting. In his head chanted;
She nodded, looking relieved, then raised a shaking hand to his cheek. Gentle, and for the first time in far too long, without fear. “My boy, My darling boy…”
“How has your occlumency practice been going?” Snape didn’t look up from the parchment he was marking.
Draco snapped out of his thoughts and suppressed a groan, Umbridge was the last person he wanted to see at that moment.
“Come on, stop standing there. What’s taking you so long?” She looked concerned, at Draco’s shrug she made a face but continued “Well- there’s a
Thought I'd put out a bit of a longer chapter this time, as the last few were short and a little heavy.
“Hey watch it!” A second year hufflepuff called out. Pansy grabbed Draco’s arm and dragged him over to the little girl who had yelled after Crabbe and Goyle. “
His mind flickered back to the signs. The conversation he had ear dropped on between Mrs Zabini and Father, where Lucious had rebuked Mrs Zabini for not keeping a good enough eye on Mother. So-
Shortly thereafter they arrived at the Great Hall. It had been transformed into a winter wonderland and looked...
“...We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.” The pink woman stood, to a polite applause that Draco took no part in.
The rest of the school year passed slowly. Draco mainly kept to himself, always thinking, going in circles with himself as he tried to think of a way to get away from his father. They had no family that would accept them- and Andromeda could not be contacted due to the magical restraints put on his Mother. Narcissa had not seen her sister in decades, so even if she
“What’s that matter?” growled Crabbe, wrenching himself free, “It’s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?”
Also its important to character development so I hope you don't mind. Harry will be back. Dream Harry will def be back even sooner.
“I am going to play another piece and then I will announce dinner for you” The house elf nodded, and he sent it away.
“She has been sober enough when you are here, but when you are at Hogwarts she has been turning to alcohol to control her emotions- and she is prone to lashing out when she is intoxicated…” “Apparently it runs in the family,”  Lucious muttered under his breath as he retrieved a piece of paper from his pocket. Draco’s face heated.
“I hope Goyles okay,” said Crabbe, forcing Draco to stop thinking about Potters ass and realise he hadn't thought about Goyle’s face at all.
He closed and rubbed his eyes, sending a thankful prayer to Merlin that his father had not peered into his ill-prepared mind, and opened them to find his mother hurrying towards him.
Here's Blaise! Hope you don't mind the American exchange thing. I just think it gives more of an interesting backstory. Hope you enjoyed! Please leave a comment if you did, telling me what I could have done better ect. Hm maybe I shoudld get a beta reader?
his father could have used occlumency. It simply wasn’t possible. The distance and the fact that Draco had not been dreaming, so he would not have been vulnerable to infiltration. His hangover the next day had confirmed that. What then?
Potter had been laughing, and Draco could see the smile fading from his stupid face as he made eye contact. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had laughed like that.
too, as it was the kind of laughter that filled your whole body and just forced all the tension out, the sort of laughter that made it hard to breathe.
“You decide pretty boy. But pay my pretty little price. Or else” Upon the last two words, Greyback looked up and winked at Draco and left the room.
- he felt he forehead crease. He stood there, watching the people swirl around him, the colours and sounds so bright, yet so…
Cruelly, soon after that, the universe granted his wish. The sounds of battle stopped as a cold, clear voice pierced the air for the second time that night.
Yet, a small part of Draco was thankful because he was on the winning side. Voldemort had once been unstoppable and would have won the war if not for the freak accident of Harry Potter. He would surely not make the same mistake again.
Snape came through his office door, looking very dishevelled and in all black pyjamas with a black robe and black slippers.
No, he didn't. That was just the alcohol talking. Draco turned to Pansy, “Its like they have sticks up their asses” Pansy giggled.
Draco felt rooted to the ground. He looked into his father’s harsh eyes, hating him. His Father would crush him in a duel if he tried to fight it. He had no choice.
Later that evening, Draco forced himself to walk the last few steps to once again knock on Snape's door. While he did appreciate the occlumency lessons, that didn’t mean he looked forward to them.
And just like that, the mood was ruined. Draco had no hope of bringing up the issue he really wanted- no- needed to talk about.
Draco trudged down towards Hogsmeade, considering his dream from the night before, with his suitcase levitating beside him. His chest felt light and warm from the memory, but simultaneously it left a very sickening feeling in his stomach. This was his
“Excuse me,” Draco interrupted, annoyed at the whole experience. “but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?”
His eyes opened, and the scream that had come out of his mouth was choked off as he realised he was safe. His heart thundered in his chest, and he felt as if he couldn’t breathe- but he was alive.
“You and I both know that this- us talking to each other... it’s odd. This is as strange as-" Harry paused, thinking, "No, this is probably the strangest thing I've ever experienced in my life. Yet despite that- I'm still talking to you- because you made a choice today, and it was the right one. And because of it I owe you my life. I have to honour that.” Draco finally summoned the courage to look at Harry. “You gave me your wand when you could have so easily left-"
Draco had not been able to escape Crabbe or Goyle. He hadn't had time to tell Pansy not to bother to send the boys back to him and hadn't had time to escape the room before they had arrived to flank him, their faces delighted at the return to old ways.
Pansy nodded enthusiastically and her face turned red as she tried to hold back another fit of laughter.
He looked up as the owls swooped in with the packages, expecting nothing from his Mother as he had already received his weekly fake check-in letter. He frowned and stabbed at a sausage. Then an owl landed on his table.
He had figured this would be the safest explanation, to pretend that he was fearful of anyone finding out he used pain to cope with his emotions.
They trudged towards Hogsmeade, they hands clasped together. They hadn’t held hands much at all due to being at school, so when the opportunity presented itself, they took it, despite the risk. Draco knew they needed each others strength for the oncoming hell that would be the Malfoy Manor. He had told Blaise about Bellatrix's crimes, and Blaise in return had remarked that perhaps she was crazier than his mother.
person he had interacted with in a positive way- had been untainted by the mess that was the rest of Draco’s life. And that had somehow meant something.
They reached the top of the stairs, and Draco strode forward at a fast pace. “Well, my father asked me to get in her good graces, so I need to visit her before class and butter her up… and I have to have a viable excuse to do so. I’m going to use you.”
Draco turned, just like everybody else, to watch as the champions make their way through the crowd. But his eyes were drawn to one boy in particular. He watched as the now scared looking Potter was dragged by the one of the Patils to the floor where they stood stiff and still.
When he met Mother the next day he was still slightly annoyed. As he crunched through the snow on the way to the restaurant he was meeting her in, he found he was incredibly annoyed by some stupid Christmas carolers. He flicked his wand in their direction and muttered “Descendo” which cause a heap of snow to fall off the roof they were under straight onto them. Draco smiled at their shocked cries.
He kept to himself, and barely noted as the second task passed. The only thing he could remember from that day was that Potter had played the idiotic hero, as per usual.
“...We should show them to him tomorrow when we have potions, Snape shouldn’t mind too much...” Draco's own voice echoed through his head in the strange way any speech did when one experienced legilimency. He felt Snape's amusement, and then heard his mentor's voice also echo through his mind “Yes, I thought that was rather amusing-”
Draco was fairly pleased with his physical shape since he had begun routinely working out. Sure, he wasn’t buff at all like Crabbe and Goyle, but no one could deny the lean muscles that had formed on his arms, legs and back.
when Pansy and the rest of the crowd collectively gasped, and Draco looked up to see red sparks fading away from near the centre of the maze.
That gave Harry pause, “Well- for fun I guess. Like the adrenaline that they get from falling from the sky- people enjoy that.”
. And if you didn’t, none of this would happen.” He patted Draco’s shoulder, “You may stop pretending to have a relationship with Pansy now, learn to bury your memories better. And if I ever find a memory of you kissing a boy again. I
had. But- he didn’t- and Draco was shocked to find that Harry began laughing again, and this time he didn’t stop when Draco didn’t join in. He just made his way over and sat on the statue that Draco had just occupied, and continued wheezing.
“Draco, I am aware you usually like to have your own desk, however as Mr Zabini here is new to the class and curriculum, and you are the most capable student here, you will be assisting him.” Snape ignored the glare Draco sent him. He
“Well that horse looks pretty fucking creepy,” said Blaise pointing to the air in front of the carriage. Draco looked, confused.
He moved out into courtyard after realised he didn’t want to go back inside. He had greatly missed the freedom of being able to walk around in open spaces due to his hellish summer and a walk around the lake sounded like a luxury.
“You.” He said, recognising her. Then, before she could blink his wand was pointed at her and she was on her knees. She let out a small shriek despite herself. “Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.”
Draco scoffed, unsure how to react, his fists slowly clenched, “Snape wasn’t a coward- I am,” he finally spat. He
Draco and Luna's plans to get her out are rudely interrupted by the Golden Trio who are very silly and get themselves snatched.
“The Draught of Peace,' said Potter. You could hear the hatred in his tone, being tightly restrained.
"I haven't forgotten myself Draco,” Draco’s eyes widened as Harry softly spoke his name, and his heart began to beat like crazy. Harry had spoken his
They walked back into the Slytherin carriage and upon entry Draco realised he wasnt in the mood for Pansy’s endless chatter, or Crabbe and Goyle's complaining, so as he sat down next to Theo, who was reading, he decided to copy the behaviour as reading would allow him to politely ignore everyone in the cabin for the rest of the trip. He opened his Ancient Rune’s textbook, which he had been reading for the purpose of getting ahead in study.
As he was patting Theo’s shoulder, Draco spotted Potter, who was dressed similarly to Theo in standard dress robes but unlike Theo, he looked good in them. Very good.
"I'm sorry," Draco said, and he wasn't just apologising for abandoning them. He knew he was apologising for the life they all lived- though Draco's was a lie while they seemed to enjoy it. He looked from Goyle, to Crabbe- who’s face hadn’t softened. They had been brought up to live this way, a life of cruelty, backstabbing, and lies.
Draco sighed then looked away. Trying to distract himself from thoughts of his father- and peacocks-
Snape sighed in relief. The hand on his shoulder patted him. “Well done. That would have been incredibly difficult. You did well.”
She nodded as he began pulling the robes over his head. “You’re right, Draco-” she glared at the Golden Trio “-Now I know the kind of scum that shops here… We’ll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting’s.”
“Form up!” Draco grabbed his broomstick and followed the new captain, Graham Montague’s, orders. It was the day after his breakdown and trials for the quidditch team were on. Draco felt ready for them as, thanks to Blaise, his head was clear. He had been for a run that morning, having felt the urge to just
He wondered briefly how Luna was, if she had reunited with her father yet- and that made him think of his own Father.
While Draco was not exactly happy to be spending so much time her, he was grateful for the knowledge he had gained and the practice he was getting. While he wouldn't have the substantial amount of time Potter and his friends had to train, he did have an incredible teacher.
“My mother,” said Draco, not moving his face at all. Harry laughed loudly, and Draco couldn’t stop his face from heating.
Well hi. Things are moving kinda fast now aren't they? We just finished fourth year. Please, please, leave a kudos or a comment if you liked it so far, and a comment about the things you didn't like and maybe I could have done better- or anything that confused you? Comments and Kudos's are so important for my moral, to know people want to keep reading motivates me to edit and upload some more.
“What’s going to happen in the coming months?” Snape had been hinting at ‘something’ which was apparently going to occur ‘next year’ or ‘in the coming months’ for some time, but he never revealed what. Draco assumed it was something to do with the dark mark incident at the Quidditch world cup.
As if called by Draco’s thoughts, a sneering Lucius pushed through the bar’s door. He looked around, his face turning mildly disgusted. He spotted Draco, and the disgusted look did not go away.  He gestured with his chin and swept out the door, knowing Draco would follow. Draco got up, collecting his suitcase on the way, his feeling of dread growing larger as he got closer to the door. He was so frightened his father would look into his mind and find the dream Draco had not yet had a chance to bury. Yet- he had no choice. Like an animal being lead to slaughter he followed his father, dread in his gut and mind.
TRIGGER WARNING. IF YOU ARE TRIGGERED SEXUAL ASSAULT/RAPE PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS CHAPTER. THERE IS A SUMMARY BELOW.
about you…” Blaise looked very uncomfortable. “Come on” he turned and left the pub, several people hurrying out of the way as he strode towards them.
He almost followed the students into the room before he had felt an arm grab him and drag him to the side of the door.
Anyway. Im really proud of the first chapter from the next bit which will be the next (and last) chapter so enjoy! and Ill see you in the next one!
And suddenly he couldn't pretend anymore, and he needed his Mother to love him again. Luna was no longer there to keep him sane, “Mother, I’m not the monster you think I am.”
They raced down the hill and through the gardens, and Draco managed to overtake Blaise when the American yelped and slipped on the ice, having strayed from the path in order to take a shortcut.
"Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes then add... two drops of syrup of hellebore." The tenseness had drained out of his voice, replaced by dismay. He had realized his mistake.
His father slammed against his them, shaking Draco to his core. “Very good” his father said, “But you will need to become more familiar with your walls so they can be put up faster, and then you will avoid cracks” his father proved his point by slipping through the cracks of the last bit Draco had hastily put together.
Blaise sat beside him, placing a hand on his shoulder. He began to speak, his voice warm and comforting.
Seemingly knowing the same thing, Voldemort’s voice returned, a crueler, more manipulative note to it. “
He picked up and unrolled the Prophet, and was immediately saddened by the sight he had forgotten would be on the front page.
down. Out of sight almost to himself, hoping and praying to all the gods whom he had never bothered to pray to before.
He smiled and applied some gel to his hair. After raising an eyebrow at himself he decided he looked better than good. He looked
They stood there for sometime before Draco felt something brush his hand- he slowly opened his palm to take Blaise’s hand, which was warmer than his. Something in him fluttered, he knew this was wrong but he couldn’t stop himself. So- instead- he smiled, enjoying the freedom. They stood there for a little longer, watching the sky, their hands intertwined.
Draco felt stiff as Granger went a little red, yet continued to answer every question adeptly, and he continued to make fun of her, hating everything he was forcing himself to be.
Draco didn’t think that one would hurt Harry too much, as he had said worse things with no reaction, but was then surprised by a large figure who materialised from the crowd.
She looked up, a bit of fire in her eyes, “Your Father often said things like that before you were born.”
He felt a wand being shoved into his hands. He looked down and was shocked to see his own wand sitting in his hand. The warmth of its return flooded into him- the knowledge that despite it having being stolen from him that it was still
He and Blaise split from their mothers and vanished into the crowd, enjoying their freedom. Blaise grabbed Draco hand, and began dragging towards Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour, saying he wanted a hot chocolate. Draco couldn’t bring himself to let go, enjoying the warmth of the hand in his, as well as the buzz he felt from their connection.
“Merry Christmas Draco,” Goyle handed him his present, which turned out to be a new set of quills. He got a broom polishing kit from Crabbe and a very nice jacket from Pansy.
His dark thoughts were interrupted when he saw Snape, striding down the table handing out timetables. When he reached Draco he paused and retrieved a note from his pocket which he added to the timetable. Snape nodded at Draco, Draco nodded back.
After the situation had calmed down, and both Goyle and the Mudblood had gone to see Pomfrey, Potter and Weasley had received detentions and Draco was pleased to see Potter sitting alone with a stormy expression on his face.
Draco snapped awake, having just been having a pleasant dream about a dragon chasing a boy on a broom with a black mess of hair on his head- to find Crabbe’s face far too close to his.
this woman. Despite wearing copious amounts of pink, and using fluffy words, this woman was just as vile as any of the ‘guests’ in his home.
Draco’s eyes were watering as he gasped out “I needed it.” He coughed to try and clear his throat of the burn and continued “This ball is fucking shit and I was about to pass out from boredom. Plus it’ll stop you from having so much. You’re already pissed enough.”
once been, but now Draco was different. He was trapped in his own head, unable to be who he was and it was torture. He had thought coming back to hogwarts would be safe and that he would be able to relax for the first time in months.
As they collapsed onto a grassy hill puffing and laughing, Draco suddenly became aware of Blaise’s body which was awfully close to his. As noticed that, Blaise’s knee bumped against his. He bumped it back. A second later their knees were resting against each other and the small contact sent electricity through Draco. He could focus on nothing but- he looked across at Blaise laying across from him, face tipped back with eyes closed to appreciate the sun that warmed his face, with lips that curled into a satisfied smile.
He returned to his rooms and begun to get ready for bed. As he stripped off his sweat-soaked clothes and climbed into the soft, feather duvet sent by his mother, he knew should definitely have a shower, but the medicine Snape gave him made him so tired and Draco couldn't be bothered. He started the meditations that would help shield his mind when he was asleep...
The class with Grubbly-Plank began, and immediately Draco spotted the bowtruckles the Professor had bought with her. They were little, green, stick looking things that… he reached back in his mind for the answer.
Armed with a large gulp of the Felix Felicis that had taken days to be delivered to him- (thanks to no owl allowing Greyback to go near it until he thought to paralyse one) Draco walked into the Room of Hidden Things.
Entranced, Draco turned with it as it slowly trotted around him- streaming light and making the broken world around it look beautiful. He found himself smiling at the magnificent creature and in response, it lifted it's head high. Its purpose served, it slowly diminished, evaporating into the air around it like mist in the morning light.
“He’s fine, Pomfrey will have him better in no time” said Pansy, kindly patting Crabbe on the shoulder.
they leave their minds open to legilimency and call him. It's how we communicate with his so effectively over large distances." Draco nodded- he knew what happened when Death Eaters touched their Dark Marks.
“Mother,” Draco stared at her for a second, looking at her hollow face, and bloodshot eyes. He had the sudden urge to sweep her into a hug. So he did.
Draco reached for the self-filling cup of water in front of him and began to build his walls again, trying to take Snape's words into account. He knew he had precious few moments before Snape would attack again.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief. They had been training hard over that last couple of days, preparing for his Defence Against the Dark Arts exam.
” He was a little short toned, but for Merlin’s sake, Draco had thought Blaise might be the first actual
After what ended up being a brief meeting with McGonagall addressing their privileges and responsibilities, they were dismissed and told to go onto patrol. Pansy said she couldn't be bothered and retreated to the cabin. Draco was happy to have a bit of time alone, when he heard the grating voices of Crabbe and Goyle. “Draco, wait up! We want to come with you” Unseen, Draco raised his eyes to the roof.
Borgin shook his head, trying to recover himself “There will be no need for…” His voice had grown considerably higher.
Now that his anger had escaped him, he felt in control...in fact, in comparison to the minute before, he didn’t feel
“They’re all gone- and we locked them in their rooms,” She gave him a wicked smile again. He smiled weakly back then pushed past her into the common room.
“Not anymore,” said Harry, waving the wand in a teasing way, but slightly louder than he needed to. The panic was clear on his face. “Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you theirs?”
Blaise paused then a small smile crept onto his face “What if I promise not to tell anybody?” He was smiling in the most appealing way and Draco desperately wanted to open up.
Still not believing it- she reached up his shirt, feeling how warm he still was. Which made sense as he had only just died... but it was
“There are bigger dragons to catch my friends,” he said, knowing they would hear the word ‘friends’ and forget anything else he might have said.
Potter and Weasley took out their wands, looking like they would hex him. He welcomed it- anything would be better than watching Potter any longer- with the darkness raging inside of him. Perhaps the pain would focus his mind enough to trap it back in.
Draco walked into the main common room and suppressed a gasp. He had never been at Hogwarts around Christmas and was surprised by the overnight transformation the house elves had given the room.
One night whilst the rest of the Slytherins were in the common room he returned to his dormitory and began to pace. He hated that this person who inhabited the school halls and wasn’t him. Sure, it
“You see, he said that Cornelius was expressing doubts as to whether messing with the school to this level was a good idea, and those punishments...well. But of course Father had to try and convince him that what you were doing was right. But even father thinks those punishments were a little...outdated.”
Pansy gasped as she spotted Granger “What the hell?” Draco could hear the disbelief in her voice, which coupled nicely with the small amount of fury in her features.
As usual, Draco’s stomach immediately began twisting up upon himself. His Mother had gotten up late to send the owl. He had been stupid not to do the same. His father probably had someone watching the house for owls... he should have seen it coming.
Dumbledore looked surprised at the interruption but quickly recovered and sat down. As Umbridge launched into her speech Draco remembered his Father’s words.
“Well I went to see the game between the Cannons and th-” Draco lost interest as soon as Goyle started talking, and focused on the textbook instead.
Draco climbed into bed, mentally exhausted after the long day and the meeting with Snape. He had needed something to distract and calm him, so the shower he had was so hot it had left his skin red and raw. The pain had felt surprisingly good. Afterwards, he had felt like he could breathe again. He stripped down to his undies to sleep, enjoying the feeling of the cool sheets against his still warm skin. He began the meditations that would shield his mind in sleep. He would never forget those again. Seconds after he closed his eyes he was asleep.
Objects were still crashing to the floor on the other side of the wall. Spurred into action, Potter finally came to his senses and pointed his wand at the wall of junk, “Finite!” Draco felt the pressure ease as the more powerful spoken spell steadied the wall. He let his own spell go, just in time to see Crabbe attempt the same spell again. “No!” he grabbed Crabbe’s arm, making the giant pause.“If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!”
“Will the champions please make their way to the dance floor.” McGonagall’s magically amplified voice rose above everybody else's.
“C'mon kid, I heard your Mother’s wild in bed. And you know you’ll have to pay a pretty price for me not to spill your little- or should I say-
“I don't know either.” Harry's laugh rang throughout the room. Draco suddenly realised that Harry being in his living room was strange.
Draco had missed being on his broom and raced around the pitch while Montague gave orders to everyone. As no one else was going for seeker he didn't really have to be there, his position was guaranteed- but he knew it would be good to turn up in support of the team.
“Are you the Malfoy boy?” Draco turned to find the owner of the hand was also the owner of an unknown face- most of which was covered by a large and heavy hood. But from what Draco could see, it was hairy and sported quite a few scars.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw Potter pull out his wand, so he reached for his own. Snape would be there any second, but that didn’t stop him.
As he slipped the three-piece suit on he knew immediately that he looked good. A glance in the mirror confirmed this. The suit fit him perfectly. The jacket was based on the military style with a gothic twist. It's high collar contained beautiful embroidery which fell all down its front and was accented with hints of green and silver. Everything else was black. Just the way he liked it. It was magically enchanted to be warmer than it should have been, considering it wasn't the bulky dress robes that usually would have kept him warm in the winter air.
He wondered where he was. Mother had told him that Lucius had never even come to the battle. He hadn’t spoken to his Father since the day Potter had escaped.
“How may I help you, Mr Malfoy? Are you here to pick up your order?” Borgin said from behind the counter, his dark eyes scrutinising Draco.
versions of Crabbe and Goyle. He wouldn’t have known they were there unless he was looking for them. He shrunk back to stand beside them. To wait.
Draco turned around, he knew to go down on one knee and bow his head. His breath caught as his eyes found a massive snake, coiled around Voldemort's feet on the floor. He forced himself to concentrate, his walls were almost complete. “My Lord.” He made sure to sound respectful, to not let the quiver of fear into his voice.
Then when she had seen his bruises when his father had beaten him she hadn’t hesitated to offer her help.
Draco shrugged “I have no idea what you talking about…” He glanced at Blaise, who had gotten two more bites in and was now onto his third. “...But I think I’ve let him eat for long enough, don’t you think?”
A pause, then, “He is well trained... Get up” Draco felt his legs move without him commanding them to. He kept his eyes averted, but he could
Hermione Granger had indeed transformed and he had to admit, she looked pretty good. She wore a blue dress, which seemed to float as she moved and he hair didn't resemble a birds nest for once. She was holding the arm of a very well dressed Viktor Krum, who’s normal frowning expression had changed to one of slight attentiveness. Draco frowned. Victor looked good. He had a contender for best dressed.
A knock came on Draco's door, wrenching him from his thoughts. He found himself laying in bed, the headache from his excessive occlumency practice killing him. He could not be bothered to speak. He flicked his wand in the general direction of the door and chanted ‘Alohomora’ in his mind. He smiled as the door opened.
He was happy at the sudden lenience of his father these holidays, who hadn’t let Draco off the manor grounds the previous year and had only allowed Draco to go to Diagon Alley if he was present. Draco suspected it was because now that Balsie and Mrs Zabini were watching, Father feared their judgment. Draco quickly wrote a letter, duplicated it twice and sent one each to Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle and Theo, asking if they would like to meet.
“No, this is just a spur of the moment visit” he said. She narrowed her eyes are him, obviously not liking his lack of formality.
Draco would have stepped back had there not been a wall behind him. He had never been victim to that smile- it was frightening, and made his stomach drop… even more so because that smile had once belonged to a friend.
His final defences went up and the younger, brattier, unempathetic Draco took over. Draco would have screamed if he could. But he could control nothing.
For a split second they looked into each other's eyes, and as Draco saw the rage in his opponent's eyes, he realised that perhaps duelling with Potter wasn't the best idea. Regardless, he had put himself into the situation- Committing, he decided to go with Densaugeo as it would disfigure Potters perfect teeth and therefore mess up his perfect face. He screamed the spell at the same time that Potter yelled Furnunculus! A pimple inducing hex- Apparently having had the same intention of facial disfigurement.
“Yes miss,” said Pansy, then snorted as she struggled to control herself. “Nope, sorry, I'm-- done now.” then let out a high pitched sigh as she sat down. Draco followed her, shaking his head but grinning anyway. Weasley looked ready to kill.
“No. I’m sorry.” Blaise looked a little taken aback. The silence stretched between them. Draco instantly wished he had made up some bullshit problems to avoid this.
Draco felt the weight, the constant words that whispered in his mind, and his sour mood- disappear. He sighed, smiling.
stupid. I thought I could hide his violent side from you. I stopped loving him and- And I only stayed because I could not bear the shame of leaving him, and I told myself you needed a father. I kept digging myself into this hole and now it’s so deep that I can’t get out--” She paused, tears welling in her eyes. Her voice had gone cold.
He looked over towards the Quidditch grounds, and at the stands which rose above the morning fog to barely brush the beams of sunlight which barely made it through the mountains and cloud. He missed playing Quidditch. It was unfair that just because they wanted to host the stupid tournament that they should ban quidditch and make the rest of them suffer. Hopefully, the first task would be held in the Quidditch pitch, which would mean they might get it back soon, as the first task was just a couple of days away...
And suddenly, Draco’s mind rushed. Greyback would only be trying to tempt Draco with information if it was something that had been kept hidden from him. A secret Blaise knew and he didn’t, something Blaise didn’t want him to know... Draco closed his eyes. It was something that
“If you're wondering what that smell is, Mother, a mudblood just walked in.” It slipped out of him as the emotional blackness began taking over, Draco reinforced the strong walls where his better self remained. It could not be touched.
Snape was one of the many visitors to the house and Draco didn't know how to feel. He looked up to Snape, but here Snape was, participating in the meetings. Draco began to question himself… everyone around him thought this was okay, but why didn't he?
A quick but concentrated ‘accio’ in his mind bought the potion to his waiting hand, which was another small testimony to his hard work with wordless magic.
he was cut off as Pansy spoke up, “No, that doesn't explain why the Carrow’s mentioned Ravenclaw tower. If Potter’s just coming to gather troops- why would he go to Ravenclaw tower? Could he have not destroyed the Horcrux yet? Could their library have something on it? I’m pretty sure horcruxes are ridiculously hard to destroy. And I don’t think we should mention this to the Carrows… as Theo made clear, He doesn’t want this information spread about. We can use this to our advantage.”
Blaise seemed taken aback by his tone. So Draco slowed down and took a breath, and then in a much gentler tone said “Sorry… Yeah?”
All of this is great for my next work, as it gives me so many things to work with (you bet Harry is going to develop one from PTSD and who better to help him than a dude who actually knows whats up? oooweee)
Draco heard himself curse. He quickly put his Pansy memories at the forefront of his mind, and then began to clear his mind of emotions. He began to gather strength for a counterattack. His father paused at the memory of them dancing at the Yule Ball, “
Draco moved past him to inspect the package that Borgin had fetched for him and placed on the table beside them- the Opal necklace. It had been expensive, but would be required if Draco could not fix the cabinet.
He blinked again, “...Yeah. Fine.” He shook his head to clear it. “Did you guys hear about the massacre at Gringotts? He went there not even twenty minutes ago,”
It was almost as if she were pretending that nothing ever happened. Did she not want it to exist? He knew that she loved him, but did she love that part of him too? Or was she just ignoring it?
Draco rubbed at his still wet hair with his towel and picked up the newspaper. Same old boring headlines.
"Crabbe!" Goyle didn't quite yell, but sounded firm enough, "Back down, he could take us, mummies wand or no. He trained with Bellatrix.”
Draco bolted awake. He groaned when he saw the very early morning light in the windows at the top of the room. The dream that had just woken him up was slipping away. Well, he was awake now--
“Well, it was pretty much automatic, she knows my father really well, he's always popping in and out of the Ministry ... it'll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won't it?” Pansy snorted.
that Harry had described, but he didn’t need to summon a memory, because he felt it at that very moment.
“Right-” Blaise said and sprung into action, following Draco's muttered instructions in an awkward way- that was until the Gryffindors barged in, chatting loudly and distracting Blaise.
“What prefers the dark?” Draco said sharply to Crabbe and Goyle- the last time he had been in the forest it had not been a fun time. “What did he say prefers the dark, did you hear?”
And so Draco had learned to read personality types, had learnt to see and manipulate greed and fear in others, while always masking his own interests.
He shuffled over and sat at one of the desks, then noxxed his wand, it's light too bright now that he didn’t need it.
Draco just stared blankly at Snape. “I have never been so frightened in my life. I learnt my fucking lesson.”
Breakfast the next day was appropriately served under a dark and gloomy sky, and as Draco poured himself tea he noticed that the Golden Trio were sitting alone. All their fellow Gryffindors had spaced themselves away from them, a display of just how badly the Prophet had influenced everybody. To have the other houses hate you was bad, Draco could understand that. But everyone in Potter’s
White spots exploded across his vision. Tears ran down his face. The hand grasping his shirt turned to a hand on his neck.
Thought Draco as he untied the letter from the bird's leg. He gave the owl a pat and some of his sausage, and sent it on it’s way then ripped the letter open.
Potter looked mockingly all around the shop. “Wow… look at that… he’s not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!”
“They are difficult to control! If anything goes wrong, Thickness shall be the one to blame and I could lose vital control in the ministry.”
, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.” How Draco would love to have Harry in a detention all by himself where he could-
When the attack was finally called off she joined the rest of the Death Eaters in the forbidden forest and he had not been there. She had begun to sob. Holding back screams of horror.
The battle, the deaths, the endless nightmares- they all had faded away as soon as the stag had come close. He no longer felt the weight of all of those faces, all of those screams- his mind was
“I thought you were with Pansy now-” She paused then softened “-but regardless, I was shocked, but I have come to realise that I don’t
Draco smiled, and with encouragement from Pansy walked over to the piano that sat in the corner of the room. Having your child learn an instrument was a common practice among the richer pureblood families, this meant over the years, an array of instruments had made their way into the Slytherin common room. When Draco was six years old his mother and father had chosen piano for him. What was once a chore imposed on him by his parents now bought him immense pleasure and was what he used to escape his thoughts. As he sat down and placed his fingers on the ivory keys he felt his mind slip into that relaxed place it always did. He did a quick warm up with a Hayden piece and then moved onto a Bach piece. His fingers flew across the keys and the notes rose into the air creating wonderful melody and harmony.
He threw back the potion, gagging as it slithered down his throat, and then shuddering as the disgusting sensation of slugs writing under his skin occurred everywhere.
The presence tried to break the walls down and Draco was struggling to fight it. He had never experienced anything like it.
“You have been distant the last couple of lessons we have had at the Manor.” It wasn’t a question. He had been distant ever since Voldemort had returned, since his life had been totally
Draco shrugged at Blaise and followed him, not surprised that his father had sent someone in his stead.
He walked over to the giant christmas tree which brushed the top of the dungeon roof, its spines dressed in silver baubles and angel hair. Enchanted snow steadily fell and dusted the tree, as well as the presents below it. Greenish blue light from the lake and the lamps on the ceiling put everything in the traditional Slytherin green tones whilst sunlight came from the enchanted windows set at the very top of the walls and made the tree sparkle. It was beautiful.
It gave him a good sense of confidence, and was the only thing that made him feel the tiniest bit in control.
Why the heck wouldnt Voldemort send his best witch to do the dirty work- and why wouldn't she come herself to prove herself or some bullshit- I understand its probably because he doesn't expect them to succeed and doesn't want to sacrifice her- but Draco had pretty good odds with this one when he fixed the cabinet... right? Anyway, I just like her being there and think its more to her character to take crazy risks like that.

Draco struggled to keep up and soon found that the river of students had several currents- but none of them seemed to move him closer to Potter. He looked around- looking in the corner of his eye trying to find Crabbe and Goyle. It took a minute but he found them, they were just behind him. It had only been a minute, but that had been enough time for him to lose track of Potter. Perhaps the hundreds of students hid him, perhaps he had gone somewhere. But then he realised... the primal urge to
A week later Draco tells Luna about her Father sighting Harry Potter, Luna asks Draco to help free her. He says he can't because he is scared for his Mother's and his own life and he believes there is no point in fighting a war you have already lost. Luna convinces him that it is because good people like him stand by and do nothing that the wrong side gets to win.
While Draco had been wishing that someone would hit him in the fucking face, this wasn’t who he had had in mind. He mentally rebuked himself- he should have known Longbottom would react that way. Draco knew what had happened to his parents.
“Shit, you’re not meant… you’re not meant to know that.” Fenrir looked paniked. Draco flicked his wand at the dog, making him yelp in surprise. “Fuck off” Draco didn’t even enjoy watching the beast scowl and skulk away. He could only feel the anger, consuming every part of him.
Remember to follow me at annarelise01 so i can let you know when im uploading as my schedule is nonexistent. love love love
She took a step back from him, and he felt himself panic- he was pushing her further away! “Mother, you have to believe me,” He could hear the whine in his voice, “I never touched her- we became close friends-”
Draco looked at Pansy and saw her scheming eyes, and her excitement at the possibility of having private information. Even though everything was telling her she should be scared- She was excited. He saw his old self. The child who had not ever thought about anyone but himself. The potential Death Eater. Pansy was still like that. She was still on the wrong side.
Crabbe recoiled, then sneered. "C'mon then, let go into there-" he pointed to an empty classroom "-and re-do them."
Draco is a bit self hatey because he failed to put his life on the line, but he is alive, and undiscovered.
Draco cast his eye's down, “Yeah, I know exactly how you feel actually,” he spoke quietly, shocked that Harry was sharing all this- and shocked that he felt comfortable doing the same. Perhaps it was the post-battle shock. “It’s so strange- like I’m watching somebody else's hands when I move them. It happened a lot when I had to-” he stopped, realising he was about to say
Oblivious, Blaise continued his lecture. “I can see you’re angry, but yelling at her won’t do any good,” He placed a hand onto Draco’s arm “she’s high inquisitor now and you heard and saw what happened to Potter in his detentions... She’s got power, so I don’t know how much a good idea-”  Blaise stopped at the look Draco was giving him.
There was a small silence that was followed by a drawn-out sigh, Slughorn did always like to be dramatic. “I’m here to evacuate you all… Y-You Know Who is coming to attack the school.” A silence, then “Harry Potter is here. He warned us.”
“How are you going?” Blaise removed his knee from Draco’s and stood up, Draco missed the comfortable contact. Blaise made up for it when he stuck out his hand to help Draco up. Draco knew it was wrong but took it anyway.
Woman!” He made eye contact with his Mother, who also looked slightly panicked “Mother, I don’t think I want these anymore.”
“...so coming here was...difficult.’ Draco tuned in towards the end “But Mom says your house isn’t so bad.” Blaise finished.
“Oh, an' here comes another one!” Draco was interrupted by Hagrid, who was now pointing to the trees, beaming. Draco felt his stomach come towards his mouth, the panic rising before... Nothing emerged.
They strode past some windows, the air was fresh and the view was nice. He had missed this dumb castle.
just ahead." Draco sneered as he settled into the lie. "Perhaps you're blind as well as stupid." Before Crabbe could attack he raised his mother's wand, pointing it at the boys chin.
Draco returned to his rooms, slamming the door when he got there and continuing to pack for Hogwarts. He was looking forward to finally leaving this place. He as he was packing he caught sight of the prophet which was still on the floor from where he had thrown it that morning. Potter stared back at him. Draco paused, and stared at the boy that was so similar to him as a thought came to him.
Dumbledore and Draco looked out to see Harry and Cedric on the ground in front of the maze. Cedric was unconscious.
“Well-- Better... much better” Draco blushed, “I’ve been meaning to thank you for your advice...I’m finding it easier to control myself”
“Oh come on Ron, Dittany is actually quite interesting. If you look at the specifics of its brewing method…”
“Don’ worry, it won’ hurt yeh.” The oaf had a toothy grin sticking out of his bushy bead. But Draco could see nothing to smile at. He shuddered.
It was only when Barty Crouch went missing that Draco’s attention was brought back to reality. Snape was incredibly agitated by the disappearance and this worried Draco.
He followed Potter as he joined the crowd which began sweeping them both up the stairs. He seemed a bit plumper then when Draco had last seen him. As if he had been eating enough.
saw Crabbe and Goyle push past him, following the sounds of voices- talked about finding a “Diadem.” He hurried to follow. They walked for some time, following a very similar path to the one Draco had once walked daily, until eventually the echoes stopped. Perhaps they had lost the trio?
going back in. It was a sick, poisonous thing and Draco somehow knew if he did not act quickly it would devour him. It would
Blaise just kinda shrugged at him, awkward “We just came in from America, she wanted to join the movement and we had no other place to go...”
Pansy’s second piece came to a close. She looked at him, ready for the duet that was next. He shook his head, signalling he wanted to play something else. She nodded and stepped away.
With a few waves of his wand and a new set of clothes, he looked close enough to the part and with another groan he set off for his father’s office.
He had come to the realisation that there was no such thing as blood purity and cried for nights on end, hating himself and everything he had become. The anger he had felt had been overpowering, and more than once he had found himself screaming and breaking things.
Draco felt a smirk come onto his face and seized the opportunity. This would help him let off steam. He took the permit he had gotten from Umbridge out of his pocket and signalled to Pansy, “Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straight away, I went to ask her first thing this morning.” He said loudly. Pansy began to snigger and then grinned.
“Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.”
Draco left the store, feeling pleased. He would send Greyback to pick up the Hand as well as the instructions on how to fix the cabinet. He was going to succeed. He had to.
The sound of stone forming into wood- similar to the sound of ice cracking, let him know that he had been successful. He repressed the urge to run as the door once again materialised from nothing. He placed his hand on the large doorknob, and after a pause, pushed through it. The sounds of battle ceased to exist as the door gently closed behind them, but Draco barely noticed, because his heart was beating so loudly in his ears.
“...Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four-hundred-and-sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things…”
But, true to character, Father had forbidden that, as he had been incredibly angry and refused Draco any comforts. Draco secretly suspected that Father was afraid Mother would support him and that was why they had no contact. He hadn’t even allowed Mother to come to King’s Cross station to say goodbye.
He slowly made his way downstairs, flinching anytime he had to open a door using his wand and therefore his hand. He snuck into the potions room, quietly tinkling through the bottles until he found a tendon healing tonic.
The voice spread through his mind and Draco felt his body tense- This was all happening too quickly for him to process.
Draco pushed forward to the front of the crowd, barely noticing as the fighters of Hogwarts began to trickle out the doors in front of them. He reached Hagrid’s side just as the Death Eater progression stopped. Voldemort was right in front of him, but Draco knew he could not succumb to the fear. He owed Harry Potter his life.
“Draco, I saw you that night, I know you drank. And now you know the dangers of not meditating, so I assume you shan’t do it again. Your father can access your dreams because you have a blood connection, so you must always meditate before you sleep--” He sighed and stopped his lecture “But it does not matter now.” Snape squatted down “Did he get in? Did he see your memories?”
But right now he had to protect himself, and his mother. He began to bury memories that he would have to face his father with, including the conversation he had just had with his mother. All the while he stared into the eyes of the boy opposite him, and watched as they hardened.
Crabbe and Goyle spoke simultaneously “What!?” apparently the two brain cells they shared couldn’t handle the information that Draco didn’t want to go bully people.
shutting down the school to put it on high alert within ten minutes or so. After the meeting I overheard the Carrows arguing about
After a terrifying walk through the forest- every slight noise from around the students making Drco flinch slightly, they arrived at a dark clearing and Hagrid dumped the cow carces on the ground. After a second or two the oaf raised his massive hands up to his mouth began to call out in a high pitched wailing noise. Draco could feel the panic building up. He looked into the trees, straining his eyes to try and get a glimpse of the creature Hagrid was calling.
Crabbe looked at Draco and smirked. “That doesn't mean I wouldn't have enjoyed punching him in his fat little face.”
Having returned from dinner, both Draco and Pansy were working on the badges. He hadn’t allowed Crabbe or Goyle near them since Crabbe had turned one bright pink and Goyle had somehow managed to blow one up. Theo sat in the corner studying, and had given up trying to convince them to do the same.
“Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?” he asked. He saw the laughs turn into looks of anger and apprehension, they all looked at Potter.
Draco was quite confused. “So to clarify… Muggles go up into the sky in big flying metal busses,” Harry nodded, already grinning, “and
Draco raised his chin, "I could easily take you both on in a duel- careful with your words." They had no idea how shaken he was from the darkness in his mind- which had woken up and started poking at the walls of its confines.
Harry turned and retired to his seat, a hand coming up to support his head. He looked exhausted. “Yeah… My brain hasn’t caught up to all of it yet. I have so much to think about- so many people…” His voice wobbled slightly- he was fighting tears. “So many are dead.” He sniffed, and as he raised his face to the sky Draco saw that he hadn’t been able to keep the tears back. They fell down his face, cutting through the dirt that covered it. It was such a vulnerable moment that showcased just how tired Harry truly was- for he never would have cried in front of Draco in his right mind.
“Come here boy” The Dark Lords voice carried across the crowded room, even though he hadn’t spoken loudly. Draco felt like pissing himself, and his heart began to beat rapidly. He started to build his walls. His practice over the last month had been intense, and it paid off. His walls were built quickly, and they were strong. By the time he crossed the room, they were up.
“I’m pretty sure the Weasel hates Potter at the moment,” said Theo, frowning and grabbing Crabbe before he stepped on to some steps which had started moving.
” But it was seemingly acceptable. They were packing their things away when Draco looked up and noticed Potter’s cauldron had grey smoke coming out of it- and Weasleys had green sparks flying out of it. Draco smirked, he knew Snape had been unfair, the first potion of the year was quite difficult.  That didn’t stop it from being funny though. Blaise had been lucky to have him. He looked around to find that Pansy’s potion was a little too dark and its steam was lavender instead of blue, while Theo seemed to have made a potion that was similar to Blaise’s.
“You’ve heard from your Mum?” Draco asked, wondering if Mrs Zabini’s letters were being screened too.
The Dark Lord, one of the most powerful legilimens ever known currently lived in his house and also happened to hate Harry Potter, so Draco could not afford to break character. If Voldemort got even a small inkling of his sympathy for Potter, his Mother and himself were as good as dead.
He reached the castle doors, skidding to a stop, his shoes slippery with mud, and he pushed the mass of wood open. He felt like he needed to vomit but he did not stop, he
Additionally, he filled his days with the practice of occlumency, wordless magic and recently, shifting the Imperius curse. Snape helped him with all three, giving him meditations and potions to help open and close his mind. Draco seemed to fail again and again but Snape would remind him that the power Draco had over his own mind was formidable, especially for someone his age. Snape wasn't the type to lie about such things so Draco felt somewhat comforted.
“I’ve bought you down here as a reminder… this is what happens if you do not obey the Dark Lord, or if you cause him any displeasure.” Draco swallowed, nodding. He knew this, he had only spent two years living in that fear.
He set a sneer on his face as he pushed open the door of the shop, wrinkling his nose as the musky smell affronted it. He stopped for a moment to let his eyes adjust to the ever-present darkness of the store, and then walked in, his head held high and his back straight- just as his father had taught him.
Because of this, after a series of events including Draco fangirling over Harry Potter, the trio escape, taking Ollivander and Luna with them.
“You shouldn't be here” Draco was panicking slightly. Harry went back to inspecting the photos. Draco's eyes went down to his ass. Fuck.
him “I am weak after so long away, however I find your resistance strong. You will be a useful servant.” The Dark Lord looked to his mother, and saw the way she clutched at his arm. Draco almost wanted to step in front of her to shield her from the red gaze. The red eyes returned to him, a small smile was upon Voldemorts face, and he commanded attention as he rose from his seat “You will serve me, you will devote yourself to me and you will submit to me. Otherwise, you and your mother will die.” Draco felt the blood drain from his face.
Draco's eyes snapped open, and he was hit by the headache and tiredness that was a result of his occlumency practice the night before. He had been working for a number of days on burying the incident with Potter in the library and what occurred after.
He unwrapped the beautiful three-piece suit they had gotten tailor-made for him, which had a dark green silk handkerchief included. He had also been given a framed photograph of him standing with his family. The picture had been taken before Draco's father had found the memory with Cassius, it had been taken less than a year ago. They all looked happy, and proud. Well, perhaps not his Mother, but she had never expressed emotion too strongly.
“But they’re really, really unlucky!” One of the panic-stricken Patils bought him from his thoughts, “They’re supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them. Professor Trelawney told me once-”
“Only to see you Mother” he replied taking his seat. Immediately the napkin rose from the table and settled itself onto his lap.
“My Lord.” He didn’t mean to let the fear show in his voice, but he was betrayed by the slight tremble it held.
He watched as his Mother slowly turned red and then purple as his father continued to yell various slurs at her.
After telling the others to go, as he had to ‘check something’, he spun sharply and pointed his wand at the fool.
Dumbledore, seemingly done with the introductions, continued, “Tryouts for the house Quidditch teams will take place on the-”
He set his fingers on the keys and forced himself to be in the moment, for nothing to exist except him and the ivory keys in front of him. He took a breath, let his heart settle, and committed. He began to play, the notes and keys an extension of himself.
“Just take one capful,” Snape said, the rare sound of concern filling his voice. Draco nodded, not in the mood to talk back to Snape and remind him that he had taken the potion the previous summer.
Draco leaned in, shutting his eyes, as hope surged in him and he dared to enjoy the moment. He was too hot, yet warm in a different way as he smelt the scent-
“Yes. I’m fine Pansy... thanks.” He pushed her hand away, but upon seeing her hurt expression, a small crack appeared in the wall and he withheld the harsh words he had been about to say. He found himself squeezing her hand. She squeezed back, and he forced himself to continue holding it. After a minute or two Pansy reached across and drew him into a long hug. He stiffened but then slowly relaxed into it… something about it felt…
“You ready?” He asked, smiling at her face which contained barely restrained excitement. She nodded.
Draco was still smiling when he stepped through the fireplace into the living room- but it was wiped from his face upon seeing the sight that greeted him. Voldemort and his father stood in the living room.
Deciding that being above ground was doing nothing for him, Draco calmly gathered his things and walked out of the library. He had barely made it to a small alcove before the tears came out. They spilled down his face, he didn't understand why he was so affected. Suddenly, he got mad. How
His gaze slid to Crabbe and Goyle, who’s gaze’s were cold- they were the same as Pansy, yet crueler.
That's it! Sorry, I didn't plan this scene until I wrote it so I didn't put it in the tags... my deepest apologies.
The fiendfyre- curse the thing- seemed to let him drag himself and Goyle up to the tip of the mountain of junk, trapping him in the middle of a sea of flames. It was playing with him.
He numbly watched as Crabbe stood up, his face twisting into that cruel pleasure. “It’s the Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!”
Voldemort was still speaking. “Come out of the castle, now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live, and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build together.”
"Been spying on me through you has he?" He almost wasn't surprised. His father had gotten to Blaise, so why couldn't he have gotten to Draco's best friends?
me!” Lucious whipped his wand was out and Draco desperately grabbed at his in his pocket. But before he could draw it, he felt his body seize up. His father had used petrificus totalus. And so Draco was forced to listen as his father went on. “You think to hide from me? You are my son! I see you, and I see the little
” His Father’s words sounded strange in his mind. Draco saw the replayed images of his father hitting him, again and again, and then saw his mother crawling to him. Draco had never wanted to relive that night again.
There was a knock at the Draco’s door. Draco flicked his wand at the door, not surprised to see their mothers, “Good morning Mrs Zabini, Good morning Mother,” Draco said, inviting them in them in.
“Because it gives you protection from death.” Pansy had whispered it. All eyes swung to her. “When someone is killed, it’s not their body that is taken from them, it’s their soul. But if you have a part of it stored away…”
“I’ll get them for you this week, but just so you know for next week, the ingredients in the cupboard are in alphabetical order, vertically, top to bottom. As you go right they move on. There's no difference between liquids, dry, hot or cold. It's only alphabet-” Draco looked up to find Blaise staring, his mouth slack in a perfect 'O’
“Oh, they were privately expressed of course. You do know that Father has the minister’s ear.” He didn’t even try to veil the warning in his voice.
Theo had remained quiet the entire time, but as he climbed into the carriages he gave the air in front on the carriage a strange look and spoke quietly.
He and Goyle looked at each other. Goyle looked relieved- but Draco knew that this was only a small reprise. The fighting would not stop as long as Harry Potter was alive.
Also thanks to Blaise, he had gotten quite good at controlling his breathing and could use the technique Blaise had taught him to help distance the angry and emotional part of his mind from the rest of it, which lessened the frequency of his fits.
"'We'," Harry echoed, and Draco thought he might be done yelling, but his voice raised until he was practically screeching at him. "You mean, you and Ron and Hermione? Mrs. Weasley told me to go see them. But I heard your voice! Sirius wouldn't tell me anything, so I sent all of you letters, and you've all just
As usual, he was greeted by a chorus of groans, but Draco had to admire the effect of the golden grid across the night air, making him grateful for the easy application their late-night practices gave it. Not to mention the increased secrecy, but Draco had cast a Caterwauling charm as always in the distance, to make anyone coming within eyeshot of their preparations. With the match tomorrow afternoon, it was all the more vital.
Dorian just seemed grateful Dantanian was talking to him. "Why do you say that? You aren't even in the dueling club. And you're last in our year at Defense-"
"I want the best for Draco too," Gilderoy went on earnestly. "And it does you credit, Severus, that you care so much about your godson and his welfare- does you great credit indeed, yes- but maybe, well, what he needs now is, er, some space? From you? Maybe?"
The stone floor of the office turned, hurtling Draco for the second time that day into a sea of jumbled fragments. He feared his mind wasn't capable of being pulled again so soon and not fragmenting. But eventually, whatever passed for a consciousness came through the darkness to a sunset over Hogwarts, as if the sun had risen back up in the sky, only to set again. The smell in Draco's nose was familiar as well: dittany, a smell always associated with his godfather.
Dumbledore broke the silence after some time, without warning. Not looking up at Draco, he said, "You did warn me."
"For that," Severus interrupted, "The solution is perhaps more evident, although I only learned it very recently, from materials at the citadel. And its discovery was why I ultimately made the choice to keep this all from you. But you might as well know the worst with the rest of it."
"It has a Dementor's hunger," Dantanian observed, and let the gag fall from the Phineas Black that remained.
"Oh my God," Harry breathed, having approached without them noticing. "Neville's parents, they're not mad any longer?"
"Draco," Lupin said, intently enough for Draco to look back up at him. "Draco, you are not a bad wizard or a bad student. Nor are you a bad person. I do not know if I have ever met an individual who cares so deeply and powerfully for his friends, and who will fight so hard to protect them. I wish I had listened in Hagrid's hut on Valentine's Day. It could have changed so much. But you are the one who
Gilderoy adjusted his fur, and then the clasp on his hair, nervously fussing with himself as if his outer cleanliness could affect what Draco thought of him now.
"Someone told me about this gala, and going to the Malfoy cellars after. That they were interesting," she began distantly, only to notice his face. "Wait, are you hurt? Oh no..." She tried to help pull him up, but he found himself as heavy as if weights of lead were strapped to his ankles, as if he was in the very spot the mirror had pulled him into the past, and leaving it would mean giving up any final shred of clarity, any less memory to tell him what in the world it was he was meant to do. "Draco, should I get-"
Foolishly, the sight of the light strands on cold black, from a person having slept there, made him think of Luna Lovegood sprawled out on a floor like this in their cellars, awakening from sleep with a mildness to her smile he had never understood, saying, "Hello, Draco. Is there any food for me today?"
, Viktor, but it does make it rather harder to study, all the attention you attract- all the giggling girls and that-"
"You think Harry and I aren't going to end up together," Draco surmised, "And that if I rush into more with him physically once he moves in, I'll regret it."
Potter leaped to his feet. "Shut up!" he yelled, with a look on his face that could have struck the Dark Lord dead. His handsomeness in that moment was almost surreal, something not belonging in such an inane schoolchildren's quarrel. He belonged in some fairytale or dream, and yet here he was, getting taunted by a Ron Weasley in tattered robes, whose inferiority complex had gone so far out of control, he would unload his venom on anyone who challenged him.
Harry said this like some great guilty revelation, but it wasn't. It was borderline uninteresting, in such a generally heightened context. "Yeah, that makes sense. You've been experiencing flashes of Voldemort's emotions, thoughts, feeling them yourself. Makes sense you'd see an experience through his eyes... in this case, his snake's. They've likely got some psychic connection as well. Be weirder for you
"I'm sorry," Draco said, and closed the door behind them, feeling only slightly less anxious than last year, when he had hallucinated being chased down the corridor of the train by Fiendfyre. "I'm sorry, okay? My father was out of line, I know that. I'm sorry I didn't step in." He looked at Potter as he said that, since Potter had seemed the one to most expect Gryffindor heroics out of him. Potter had been staying at the Burrow this last stretch of summer, and him and Ron would have had ample time to work themselves up into a lather about Draco if they wanted.
"Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium."
"Dobby will watch over you both," Dobby proclaimed with astounding confidence, and it was only after Dobby had conducted Draco all the way past the dragon sparking at his door that he said goodbye and apparated out of the manor as a free elf for the first time.
"This feels like the best day of my life! The Rat Thieves, together after a hiatus, back and better than ever! On another mission to uncover a mystery only they can-"
"Now it's even worse," Draco whined, but Remus pulled back to give him a look that would brook no argument.
Draco lost his nerve at the final hurdle. "The rat and the dragon. I wrote it all down exactly, I can show it to you sometime if you want. She predicted that the rat would be swallowed up in the flames of the dragon." He realized just a second after he lied that he'd told Hermione that prophecy right after it, in third year. He would just have to hope they never compared notes.
"Because you don't have nerves, when it's just us," Draco said impatiently. It also had to help that Draco was a singularly poor Chaser, and they both knew it. "Compared to practice earlier tonight... if you needed any more proof that it's your nerves that trip you up, not your skill... I'll give you some calming draughts, that should help, but if you don't have confidence-"
Daphne shrieked as it almost fell on top of her feet. Draco grabbed his wand and hissed, "Stupefy!" The writhing spider fell still, and Crouch's gaze went so murderous that Draco was driven to put on a show of obedience.
"Are you threatening me?" Severus said, unimpressed. The situation would have felt like two imposters playing the Draco and Severus roles, rather than themselves. Except Severus, look as he did just like the godfather Draco had trusted above all others, was already an imposter.
Dobby's eyes as he regarded Draco with swimming doubt were at once the same irritating eyes he had grown up seeing, and a pair of scales that held the weight of the future in them.
"I am forever staggered," Draco said drolly, "Not just by the courage of Gryffindor schemes, but by the depth of
found in one of the boxes, so he maintains still that these were your intentions. Quite the obedient
He sat down between Harry and Hermione that night at supper, with cordial nods to Molly and Bill Weasley nearby, and took the anxiety off Harry's face with a beaming smile. "What's with you today, anyway?" Hermione whispered skeptically. "You've been acting so
"I mean, honestly, my major contribution was just keeping Ron from getting himself killed by staring moonily at the Basilisk," Draco shrugged, enjoying the elbow he got in return, only to start when he felt a hand brush his, just for a moment.
Pansy spent the next few weeks pointedly ignoring him and flirting with third-years when he was nearby, as if no one had ever told her he was gay.
Severus looked bemused by Draco's sudden friendliness, after the frigidness that had reigned between them since the failed meeting with Black. "Yes?" he intoned.
"There's not much that I didn't say last night," Potter said, dropping his voice. "But none of us can figure out this other thing Mr. Weasley told me- he tried to make me promise that no matter what I heard, I wouldn't go after Sirius myself. Why would he think I'd do that?" He made a face at Draco as if anticipating derision. "Believe it or not, I'm not that arrogant, whatever you'd say-"
"I knew it," Severus groaned, pocketing his wand and staring fixedly at the empty wall in extreme dislike. His hands were clenched to fists in a visible effort of self-repression. "I knew
"It could be like that," Draco said heavily, "Or it could be worse. But he's not going to stop being a spy, and he
Did that mean there truly was something of Aunt Bella left in it, to show clemency for her sister's wand?
"I had other things to do," Draco repeated, and found the resemblance between Theo at 11 and Theo at 15 was not strong enough to set his mind wandering to the hedges of Malfoy Manor, where Draco had learned how a Slytherin tasted for the first time. It was instead a reminder of Theo's father laughing as Draco performed the Cruciatus curse that hit him with whiplash clarity, at the sight of Theo watching Dumbledore's speech, uttering nonsense words with such cheerful magnanimity. Dumbledore was so carefree now, everyone was, with an idiotic lack of respect for the darkness awaiting. Draco felt like Mad-Eye Moody ready to shout
Gilderoy squinted downwards, only to do a double-take once he processed the location and contents of the Polaroid in his hand. "Is that..."
"I'm sorry I'm so terrible at this," Harry sighed, wiping his sweat-soaked face and sitting, with the towel and chair the room had provided for his requirements. Draco sat beside him, ready to launch into the discussion section that the dueling book said was vital to answer any of the pupil's questions, and allow them to recognize their mistakes and learn. "You make it look so easy..."
"Shut up!" Draco yelled, losing his composure as he had resolved not to do. "Shut up about Sirius! You're one to talk about
"You're just scared I'll find out your secret!" Severus yelled, breaking free of Potter and running forward towards the opening, and then there was a
"This is what I found when I opened the dagger." Draco reached for it, and Severus held it back. "Destroy the copies first."
Draco's index finger ran out to trace over the words that were there in black fountain ink, in McGonagall's crisp handwriting from Transfiguration blackboards and this same letter, once upon a time. There it was, the most impossible combination-
"Well," Draco said, with that false childish optimism he knew infuriated Father so, "She stayed at Malfoy Manor for a week last year, and I stayed in Hampstead a week, so that's two. And since Hermione visiting
"You can do this, Draco. I know you can," Harry said intently, though there was a certain anxiety in his words that belied his confidence. Maybe Draco should have explained that the worst that could happen from a failed ritual was Draco's embarrassment.
At the start, though, Draco was more worried about Harry erroneously pitying decrepit old Grindelwald, in his sad squalor- but no squalor was actually forthcoming. Draco had forgotten many of the room improvements he'd made in that longtime cell during his first visits, lavishness in trade for secrets of the mirrors. He was like the world's most eccentrically paid interior decorator. As it was, they found Grindelwald comfortably housed, draped in deep blue fur robes in place of rags, from the same shop Draco had bought Gilderoy's. The mass murderer was calmly sipping water from a garishly transfigured cup, embossed with the Hallows.
"You look like something that comes to drag down sinners to the underworld," Draco said, and he couldn't see Harry's mouth behind the mask, but he could practically hear him smile.
The Gryffindors forced smiles, while Draco found he didn't have to. Luna being Draco's real cousin of a sort suited him, with the calm Luna's presence exuded, even from a dungeon cell in the blue loop. Her time with Tom Riddle had given her a separateness much like Draco's own, outsiders in the bodies of children but children no longer, sorted into houses where they did not belong, any more than they belonged anywhere else. Not to mention, it was nice to have one person around who was not more bound to Potter than himself, this time around.
Scrimgeour looked none too happy to have to deal with Draco, either Malfoy or Black. "Oh, yes, of course. My apologies. Mr. Black, if you wouldn't mind... Harry and I have a great deal to discuss..." Draco would have obeyed the dismissal, if Harry hadn't kept him there, hand going to clasp him around the waist under the cloak.
"Draco," Potter said, still not afraid, nothing but dismayed. "If you're angry, you don't have to be alone. I'm not afraid of you. I've never been afraid of you. No matter how much you try to make me. You do know that, don't you?"
The smell of hazelnuts was melting and the smell of fire was the true one. The warmth turned inverse, as the snow of Castell de L'Infern became the ice in the eyes of Draco- no, it was not Draco, though the eyes were the same. That was Father, who had also been wrecked by a human will. Father was crumpled on his knees gasping with his eyes melting, pain making tears escape involuntary. A small handprint was written across his cheek, with one hand clutching his cheek and tears escaping over it. Melting and yet the ice in that stare grew instead of thawed, hardened into something immoveable and hateful. Hatred impotent as the stump on his other wrist.
"You will return tomorrow," Grindelwald prompted. "To hear of the Mirror of Ecidyrue. And you'll  leave the cushions."
as if Draco wasn't well-aware. He was very receptive, though, having been so terrified she knew about him and Harry that he would have taken an intervention about his secret blood magic well in stride.
"Draco," Gilderoy said helplessly, deflating like some puffed-up Muggle parade float when the party was over. "I wanted to tell you- wanted to from the moment I found- materials, but Severus saw them first, and he told me it would be for your own good to keep them from you-" Severus shot him a sharp glance and his mouth shut.
"So I've dumped Neville," Luna informed Draco, upon his return to the Ravenclaw common room. Harry had taken him back to Hogwarts as soon as he could, and Draco had rested for a while in bed. Now he reemerged only for that blunt statement to greet him.
passage- oh, he'd like that the best, wouldn't he, coming in and killing Dumbledore by way of his own brother-"
"Oh, Salazar, bloody hell," Draco groaned into Harry's ear. "How did I miss the egg..." They watched as Filch monologued towards an imagined Peeves, who in his mind seemed the obvious culprit of egg-thieving, and whom Filch would now be able to triumphantly have expelled from the school, once and for all. "Shouldn't we make a break for it?"
? Save my stomach and abstain, Draco. The points are the points and speak for themselves. Victory is victory however you attain it."
"You're saying you're obsessed with me?" Draco teased. When Harry's hands moved, sliding back to cup his arse, he pressed as close to Harry as he could with the stag horns permitting, breathing in the Amortentia scent of Harry behind the metal of the mask. "Or what, addicted... you don't think I'm obsessed with you too, Harry Potter? Do you have any idea what I would do if anyone else ever
"Potter," Draco said, stepping between them again. "Tergeo," he said, several times for himself and then Potter, until they were relatively dust-free. Then he used some cleaning charms to get them fully back to presentable. "Look at me, Potter," Draco ordered. Potter obediently faced him, and closed his eyes when Draco reached for his glasses. Draco pulled them off and cast Reparo. Potter didn't open his eyes again until Draco put them back on. "There, come on," Draco said, forcibly straightening Potter's Gryffindor robes, which by occluding the red and gold crest, the soot had rather improved. "Here we go. Now you can shake his hand."
, said one of her yearmates, and for the sake of expediency in obeying Harry's orders, Draco pretended not to notice the face the girl made at the comment.
It had only been as he was checking out that he took a real look at the signs and materials around the store, and saw the collection had been called
"Oh no," said Hermione, stopping abruptly. "Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle-"
Dantanian sat cross-legged in a bedchamber not unlike Dorian's secret one in the dungeons. But it was in an array of different colors, the red-purple-gold-bronze and deep yellow of the rooms reminiscent of the shades of Astarte's flat in Paris. There was a painting of her on the wall nearby, but not with the skill of Jackson Shaw's, though with just as much care. It was signed Dantanian Noir, as were two smaller portraits of her, hung behind a wall of bohemian and eastern-patterned curtains and gauze. It would have been lovely, but for the half dozen dying snakes riddled over the carpet around Dantanian's feet.
youth. Trust can seem as firm and unchanging as the stones of Hogwarts, but only when there is no enemy knocking at the gates or creeping from within. You should not be surprised how with the slightest pressure, trust can crumble, with much more ease than you broke down this wall." Severus took a handful of the dust, far away from their faces to avoid the toxins, and lifted it before letting it fall through his fingers.
"Now..." said the voice of Voldemort, and Wormtail let Voldemort out of his little bundle. Draco was forced to look at Harry then, by the muffled sound of that scream drew from him. He followed Harry's gaze and could understood why he had screamed. It looked like the Dark Lord Draco remembered from the Manor, but small, more hideous and malformed than even the noseless monster from the blue loop. Instead of pearly white, its flesh was a dark red, but not the elegant, smooth pomegranate color of Naufragiam. It was the ugliest kind of wound, like hard red clay pulled from tainted earth.
"No," Draco said impatiently. "Of course not. Hermione, Luna, Neville, they're never dying either, I'm not having it. So that's the immortal ones. We can fight a war, yes, but you can all rest secure in the knowledge that Draco Malfoy has declared you immune from death."
"That was what Pammaque said he wanted." Maybe Periander had thought his rotting body would leave some final clue for Draco.
Once Harry finally stilled, Draco Vanished away his seed, before dropping to lie beside him. He stared greedily, feasting on the sight of Harry disheveled and sweaty.
"No," Draco said, "It's because Hermione tattled to McGonagall that Potter got a Firebolt, oh, and also, they don't like Hermione's cat- which, uh, actually kind of has something to do with-"
question Gilderoy would surely be asked the most, should he ever find legal absolution and be unleashed back out onto the world.
"I am not stalking you," Dorian said indignantly, toying nervously with a diamond pendant on his neck. "I am a Hogwarts prefect, charged to keep students in their houses after curfew!" Bruises were visible along his throat and collarbones above the silver chain, what looked to be bites from some other boy or girl's amorous attentions. When Dantanian looked up, Dorian seemed to suddenly remember they were there, and tried to pull his collar tighter to hide them. But Dantanian was looking at Lamia instead, with eyes that said,
"Do you think that could end up happening to you?" she asked with a hitch in her voice, overwrought by everything she had been forced to see without warning. She ran her fingers over the burn where Sirius had once been.
"I think I am," she said, with a long eye-roll, "But only when you consider that the person sleeping nearest to me now will be Lavender Brown."
going to be alright. We can all go and see him later. Bill's sitting with him now. He's going to take the morning off work."
on lockdown? No one's going to go after us. They've been after all the other houses, but not Slytherin. We're all safe, because no one here is a Mudblood like-"
Father faltered as the thought seemed to belatedly strike him, his left hand leaving Draco's neck to fumble in Draco's topmost pocket and pull out one of the earrings he'd shown him, the sigil of greyhounds a mere glittering shadow. "What did you do, Draco? These
, Severus!" Draco screamed at the top of his lungs, and began to shake, hands convulsing impotently. "YOU ARE GOING TO DIE-"
Draco let Luna lead them as they ran, though he and the others became progressively tenser at the distant sounds of battle in the castle. "The Order of the Phoenix is here," Luna reassured them. "They and the professors, they'll hold back the Death Eaters, that's what the second message on the coin said- those are the orders while the students get out of Hogwarts, the DA is to protect the evacuation-"
Potter was sweating more than before, a bead of it running down his face and catching distractingly over the curve of his top lip. "You think you're so impressive, don't you?"
- and I assure you, I myself was pressured into a fair share of that work, with a different copy of your loathsome Hecate book thrust into my hands along with many others- don't make that face, vain boy, if I am to have another hysterical fit about how your
Harry frowned, not seeming to process it at first, and then wonder filled his face. "Mistletoe," he breathed, and the horror that Draco had expected didn't appear there, only a slow-spreading blush across his handsome face, color rising high in his cheeks, which looked like they would be very hot to the touch- hotter even than his fingertips, which stopped where they had been trailing up and down Draco's palm to linger there.
"And no other piece moves like a knight?" Potter asked Weasley, though he seemed to know even before Weasley nodded.
Luna did not ask why his recovery from this bout of magical exhaustion ended up taking longer than any other. Even if she did faithfully relate worried conversations about his absence, increasing in frequency and pitch over time. Sharp-eyed Hermione had speculated that Draco could be malingering, if not simply unmotivated to recuperate, given how Luna had found his steadily increasing supply of angel's infusion unused. Ron's perspective had been that there wasn't any investigation
Then the stag was charging at the Dementors in righteous fury, a brilliant light still flanking it as Hermione began to lead the procession of Slytherins out of harm's way again, more Dementors streaming out of the common room after the fleeing students. But when they tried to follow, Harry was there with his Patronus, wand raised high in defiance of all of the Dementors' seeping cold, and hundreds of leering dark forms fled in the face of the stag...
Gilderoy made strangled throttled sounds, seeming finally to understand what Hermione and Luna already had, by their mortified glances to one another. Then Gilderoy looked warier, though surely he couldn't suspect romantic threat from
Draco shook his head, trying not to laugh too much and encourage her, as they left a scandalized-looking Dean and Seamus. "We'll play footy together back at school, yeah?" he called backwards at Dean.
"We've met a number of times before, haven't we," Draco said, wracking his memory, "Adrast?" and the goblin Adrast nodded. Draco did not mean the recognition to be friendly, but to show he knew enough to keep a grudge if defied. "I'm here to empty the vaults for this wand, as the Lord of House Black." He took the talon wand and laid it on the counter. Harry exhaled sharply. Draco shot him a warning look, and Harry seemed to compose himself, though it was a struggle.
"A wizard can fail to understand the charm. He can be too young or too magically weak to produce the needed force for the enchantment. Clearly, neither of those are your issue. He can be failing to use a strong enough memory of happiness. Often, this can be solved by imagining a memory rather than drawing on a past one. But in your case, I wonder if the issue is not the memory but your relationship to happiness itself... tell me, Draco, do you feel you
set on us, because you were too stupid to know he'd set us up! I saved your whole stupid evil house from them! I saved you from Riddle, I killed a Basilisk, and you just made
Why had Draco never thought about it? Why, amongst the Death Eaters, it was Wormtail alone never called by a proper name? Why had he never wondered
Harry looked about to leap off the bed, before he seemed to register his own situation, and rolled onto his side to hide his reaction.
Draco smiled at her grimly. "I went back to Grimmauld every day after that before term started, and they didn't notice me leaving once. As long as I'm at meals, I could be off selling my body between them, and they'd be none the wiser." He laughed at the face she made at his colorful example. "Sorry, sorry, but you catch my drift. Anyway, I'd blasted the name off the tapestry, and when I looked up, there was my Uncle Sirius, looking just like on all his wanted posters. And-"
, Wormtail, I swear it, he's alive," Black babbled. Draco almost thought him guilty, then, for how bad a job he was doing. He was falling apart, in a way just an angry old friend should never have made him, falling to pieces like Lupin's righteous fury was about to convince Black himself that he was guilty. "I didn't kill Peter, he staged it, he was the Secret Keeper, we changed it, thought no one would think- he's still alive, he's been hiding as a rat, Remus, it's why I broke out, to find him..."
The trees kept lighting up with blasts of green light in the distance, but a blast that came from closer had Potter urging them on deeper into the wood, to the sound of screaming. For once, Draco's voice was not one crying out. He pushed Potter out of the way, mean as it was, in his haste to get between Hermione and Luna again. They'd lost Fred and George along with Ginny, who'd had the good sense not to stop and dawdle with their little sister in danger. Ron and Harry took up the front, while Draco kept Hermione between the three of them despite her protests. "Hermione, don't you get it? You're not a Muggle, but you're still the first one they'd be after," he hissed, and she made a noise like she hadn't realized and let him hover closer as they walked.
"They're the Potters' childhood friends," Draco observed dryly to Theo. "You kind of ended up with the wrong crowd for that."
"That," Draco said, "Is because I am in possession of a brain, but I do pity you the lack of one, Potter. Perhaps with your most recent act of heroism, your public will be moved, and we can all put in a collection to purchase you one."
Armageddon was kind to such intrepid challengers. Granted, Ron did contrive to leave half an eyebrow behind, near Blaise Zabini at that. But a look from Theo of all people silenced Blaise from calling out the mistake. Maybe that was a sign vengeance did not burn eternal, or maybe Theo just felt them beyond such childishness.
Harry bit his lower lip, tugging it out enough to make Draco whimper, squirming brattily on his lap. "Then teach me," Harry whispered, "And stop
Draco almost cast Lacarnum inflamari before he remembered Hermione's order about not burning anything important. Surely Periander himself qualified, especially if he had anything on his person- Draco couldn't keep hesitating, though. It was lucky he was younger and faster than Periander, as he took refuge behind a massive sphinx, and that met a similarly dire fate as the goddess. "Diffindo!" Draco shouted, severing the feet of what had to be Vulcan with his blacksmith's forge, and a headless trunk that could have been Demeter or Hera, or Zeus himself on a shapelier day. "Oppugno!"
"I wanted answers!" Harry yelled, lowering all the distance Draco had put between them to zero again. Suddenly, Draco wished his room was not so beautiful, as every small prettiness in it seemed another potential gall to Harry, another thing Draco had and he didn't. "And I thought you of all people would at least give them to me! Since when have
in his head for all the good it was doing. The hat did not respond anymore, sitting so quiet that Draco feared his time travel-tainted mind had overworked the thing to the point of frying its virtual brain, with murmurs slowly starting up that Dumbledore had to raise a warning hand to quiet. Draco glanced backwards at the table and saw Dumbledore lowering his hand, and felt a surge of humiliation strong enough to make him feel a ghost of old hatreds.
It had been Wormtail to help the Dark Lord come back, there at his side when Draco's father had not been. Yes, Wormtail had been there when the Portkey had taken Potter to him, to give his blood to make him reborn before summoning the others. Wormtail's hand had been part of the sacrifice that brought Voldemort back. That was why he had that awful silver hand that Draco had hated to ever look at, the hand that had strangled Wormtail himself in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor, though Draco had never known why-
"Because it does!" Draco got in Potter's face, if that was the only way to make him see him for once. "It does, Potter, your
?" Potter waited for some other explanation, and when Draco just laughed, Potter's face had crumpled like he had
"Okay, Ron," Draco said, testing the waters. "I'm going to trust you with something I've never discussed with anyone, even the people it involves. If you tell a single soul, intentionally or not, I'll cast Langlock on you every morning for at least a week. Maybe a month. Depends on my mood at the time. Maybe Oscausi instead! And then it's Verniculpa
But now he had set his son another task. "He's been practicing his flying all the time for Quidditch, you know. I'm sure you've been as well," Nott said, with a warmth that seemed to confirm Severus's reading of the Death Eaters, wanting to pull Draco back into the fold. Punishment might come later, when he was too firmly ensnared again to run from it.
"Want to see me make it bigger? Hotter?" Draco smirked and narrowed his icy eyes. It felt like Potter had chosen that time to come out to him to expressly mess with his head. "How hot can you stand it, Potter?"
"Forgive me," Gilderoy said in a small, wounded voice, "If I did not want to dwell upon the connection."
What was different was the presence of Potter, who hadn't even bothered to come to Slytherin-Ravenclaw the first time, an absence that had irritated Draco to no end. He'd probably been helping Hermione with research last time, but now he was the only one of the trio to make an appearance. He was seated in that shadowy spot near the wall in a Hufflepuff section of all places, like he was abashed at having attended and didn't want to be seen. Draco couldn't have missed him, even before the Snitch flew down right into Potter's vicinity.
Draco shifted, trying to find a secure place to stand that did not have rotting parchment or twisted vines beneath it. "I'm not allowed to go for a walk? Get over yourself."
"Alohomora," he said softly, and then louder with an impatient wave of his hand, though his 11-year-old voice sounded ridiculously high and thin.
?" He lingered over the syllables of Krum's full names in the manner of Severus, as if all kinds of vicious intimations could be read into that pronunciation.
"Do I get an explanation?" Harry asked, sounding unperturbed by Draco's prickliness, and when his fingers stroked soothingly over Draco's forehead, it was a struggle not to purr. Maybe he shouldn't have let himself be lulled into sitting this way. It seemed criminal to be enjoying such lavish, affectionate treatment by Harry bloody Potter, while sitting on the grave dirt of his victims. But that was his life these days, the inhabitance of overlapping ironies.
Potter and Ron didn't seem to hear him, spellbound as from the middle of the misty domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was grey in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was blind.
"You're a child!" Draco hissed at him furiously. "You're all such children! How did that many years in Azkaban not teach you the way the world works? How did you still all live in your
"I know Shakespeare great," Draco said defensively. "I wrote an essay on him. I got an O on my Muggle Studies exam, didn't I? I discussed Titus Andronicus, and King Lear,
"Oh," Harry sighed, then leaned forward, seeming to steel himself. "Okay. My mind's a dagger now. Ask me any question."
, Draco," Potter said earnestly. "She was going to come. I don't think she liked turning into Bulstrode... but Draco, she's always said you're not the Heir and this would prove it-"
"Wanna show him, captain?" Draco drawled. Harry's green eyes went bright again at another ill-considered nickname.
"Miss Granger," Black said, though he was kind enough not to get to his feet when he offered her a hand to shake. "I've heard a lot about you."
"It's just wonderful," Draco said, with a childish earnestness deliberately calibrated to infuriate Severus, "To be able to offer assistance to this project, isn't it? I'm so glad, just to do some small thing to requite the generosity of my wonderful new guardians, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin."
them, past their surface of glittering ever-happiness. Still, it was a compelling surface, brilliant as the fireworks that kept whizzing and banging for weeks after they were gone. It made the increased dreariness in the castle left by their absence a bit less pronounced, at least. And helped him keep to his resolution not to think about his talk with McGonagall, or the prospects of his future, at all whatsoever. If Severus wasn't going to bring it up, he wasn't. He could pretend to be happy, and sometimes, he even felt he was.
"Cut it with the savior complex. Do I look scared to you? You're the scared one." He straddled Harry. The feeling of hands tightening on his waist to keep him balanced made his entire body tense for a glorious moment, awareness less of thought than sensation, of the configurations their bodies could take.
Many years ago, maybe even months ago, Draco would have let that be that. He would probably have pulled out his wand and cursed Theo and maybe all of them, at best stormed away and abandoned Quidditch practice, and maybe the Quidditch team with it. But these children were his friends again, for better or for worse. He cared about them, much as he wished he didn't.
The entire school seemed to be trying to cheer poor martyred Potter up the morning of Halloween, when he was to be abandoned as cruelly as he had ever been as a boy, to the terrible fate of
"Premeditated murder is never an option," Hermione said, horrified. "Of course not. That's against everything we stand for. If we stoop to that, between us and the Death Eaters, there's not enough difference anymore."
It was surreal to see a hundred thousand wizards, thinking how impossible such an event would have been only two or three years later, once the wizarding world had broken out into war. Yet the war had not taken so long the first time that the 1998 Quidditch World Cup should be prevented from being played, even if it had been in England and not Russia. It was stupefying in the figurative and almost the literal spell sense, the vertigo of looking down on so very many people wrapped in this diffuse golden light, with the knowledge that the reproduction of this sight in Russia in four years depended so much on his actions. That the fate perhaps of every single person hinged on him, and not just the two dozen or so who would fill this highest box. That faceless mass of red and green and gold would live in fear or safety depending on the choices he made, with the knowledge only he had of the blue loop, while his own foolishness with that still-unknown mirror had erased the chance for them to have nearly all their safety secured in the future already.
Mother's gaze dropped to the counter first, where the discarded Antipodean Opaleye lay, one of her last presents to him. Then it went to Harry's hand on his neck, which dropped away, exposing the necklace. Draco had wondered how much it would show up against his pale skin, but he was paler yet than the rose gold, and the shape of it seemed to show.
"I could kill you so many different ways," Dantanian said softly, "Before you came close to making the call."
." Dantanian kicked Phineas's face into the ground again. "I was older than some of your boys, but younger than some, when you ordered me dead along with my mother. You must have thought you succeeded, until I told you who I was. Why didn't you try and kill me then and wipe your bloodline clean?
, Potter, I regret to inform you you're heading in the wrong direction, much as it will come as a shock, because I am going to the
Draco sank into that untouched eye and sat down hard, putting his head in his hands. He could feel his feet push against a snow-covered beam that had fallen from the ceiling, and kicked at it without energy. Theo kicked it aside for him, spelled the area beside him dry, and then sat with him. The snowflakes were melting in his hair.
She pointed down. "How can this be? Can any person's life be without a past or a future? Without birth or death? There is a flaw in your diagram. Can you explain it?"
"What do you want me to say, Potter?" Draco shook his head. "You're still a child. You couldn't beat
"And for the pain," Draco added reluctantly. "Doesn't it help with that as well?" He tried to sound brave, but failed as usual, and his voice cracked as he said, "It hurts, sir."
"He lived longer than he thought he would," Dumbledore reflected, corners of his lips twisting up in something nothing like a smile. "He believed when he was young that he would go out early, in a blaze of glory. It must not have suited him, all those years in Nurmengard as a slow death."
"Hermione," Krum said, and Draco pumped his fist. All those many times spent going over and over that pronunciation had borne fruit. "Hermione, ve are not much acquainted, but I have seen you often in the library, vith your friends..."
"Students!" called an elderly voice, as a man with a striking resemblance to Cantankerous Nott walked out before them, and began the procedure for Sorting much like McGonagall always did. Dantanian seemed to visibly not be listening, either because he had already read about all this, or he just simply didn't care. He only began to pay attention when the Hat's song ended, and the students began to be called forward, name by name. There were many familiar ones, some less so, but none of the names were particularly interesting until the M's. "Malfoy, Dorian!"
"It's for Mr. Nott," Draco blurted, heart in his ears, "And it was a year ago, last June, soon after I killed Mr. Nott, I'd been sent home, like I have now. It was- it was from-"
"A Slytherin came to me and said Theo wants to kill me, and all the Slytherins hate me and want to help him," Draco admitted in a rush.
"Language, Charlie," Mr. Weasley said, in a tone clearly admonishing him for more than that, and Draco held up a hand to forestall Peter's smart comment.
"No," Flitwick said mildly, in a gently placating tone that reminded Draco of Remus. "But is that true, Mr. Black? Do you not have any particular direction you wish to pursue?"
tried. But I think... that's enough of that now, don't you?" Draco gripped the other side of the Pensieve as they stared at one another. "So give me the vial- and I'll
It had taken everything in Draco not to burst into laughter in several parts. Finally, he folded the letter in half with an impassive look, and handed it back to her. "Well?" Cho demanded, another tear streaking her red cheek. She could not have looked any more different in that moment, one had to acknowledge, than Tonks. "What do you think?"
"They'd be dangerous to any home-owners," Hermione began disapprovingly, but Luna shook her head. "And we don't know anything about their species or natural climate-"
This was Saint Potter, do-gooder, Gryffindor supreme, savior of the wizarding world, starry-eyed proponent of all that was good and pure and true. He would never draw an ounce of pleasure, let alone sexual pleasure, from playing with ropes, or squeezing on another boy's neck...
"Yeah, I'm sorry too, again, for the thousandth time," Ron said, "Though it was mainly Harry who convinced me," and earned a more severe elbowing. "What! It's true! You were always so sure, and you're the local expert on Draco Malfoy..."
" He seemed to try and put a paternal kindness on his own face, as he crossed back and sat beside Dantanian, giving him a tentative smile. "Don't worry, son. We're normal too. We've heard what happened to your mother. Whatever she did- whatever she
No one in the clearing, including Draco, knew what to make of that offer. "What is this, girl? Are you confessing that
Tryouts for Seekers in Slytherin, apart from participation in the other drills, consisted of a set of three one-on-one games. The other Slytherins flew down and dismounted, staring up from the grass while Flint hovered ready to release the Snitch. If his deal with Father had not been sufficient to reconcile Draco to fighting for a position he had not initially wanted, the collective front of opposition from Slytherin's older players
But there was no time. Millie was the one practical enough to pull back and bark at the DA, "Come on, let's go! Are we waiting for a Death Eater escort out of Hogwarts?"
hurt you." He lifted up the chest, making sure the imposter could see him in the process, and cast his most delicate Finestra. One by one, the ugly brown vials of Polyjuice shattered. The purple eyes, fast-fading to a dull and then drugged black, flashed in panic at the sight, even before Draco had gotten through all the rows, dropped the chest to the floor, and cast Incendio. "See? Doesn't that hurt worse?"
"Calm down," Wormtail snapped, slimy eyes going between Draco and the bundle. "It's the Dark Lord's snake. She would never disobey him. She is a faithful creature."
She saw Dantanian's stunned expression. "Didn't know much of that, did you? Funny, what people in these families can get up to. Say this about the Perianders and our curses- you'll never hear about us having any
"I made the trade. It was mad, but I loved her. I'd failed her once, out of my own weakness. I wasn't going to fail her again. I told myself I was already a monster, already deserved to die, so I could suffer terrible things- I could do terrible things, anything if it was for her.
Then it was Fleur Delacour, and then Cedric Diggory, and Draco applauded for them too, with at least some of the enthusiasm his housemates would expect from him for his supposed crush Diggory. He caught Potter glaring over in his direction, and stuck his tongue out at him before looking back at the goblet, the only one in the hall who knew to be expecting another name.
?" Neville said disbelievingly. "Merlin, Draco, put your wand away." He wasn't crying anymore. He looked more worried about Draco than himself. "Stop talking nonsense. I would never do that to you. Wands are wands, aren't they? It's who wields them that matters."
She nodded, looking like she had aged twenty years in the past hour of revelations. "I want to know as much as I can, Draco," she said bravely. "I'm trying not to judge you. All the things you've done... I was right, you haven't been telling me things anymore, but I understand why you did them. I can see you're just trying to protect the people you care about. Even before trying to protect yourself."
, and take it, and whatever Father said or did after not let it out of his hand- except he'd planned to follow the blue loop- but Hermione's hand touching his arm would be stiff and petrified in only a fluke escape from death before the school year was out if he didn't
Knowing what was to come, with the grand entrances by ship and flying carriage, it was actually kind of a drag to line himself up in front of the castle with all the other excited children. He wanted to shout at the carriages, just leave Krum and Delacour, send all the rest of your lot home and save us some time. Oh, and if the ship could take Karkaroff back off with it, that would be optimal. Draco was hardly looking forward to seeing him again. Although he was curious if he had managed to do something about the talon wand's brand, where Mother and Sirius hadn't.
hear from Black again, and this would remain an uncomfortable secret between just them and Dobby, as long as they lived. Maybe, she said, something awful had happened to Black- though they would have heard if he'd been caught- or Black had just given up...
With the explosion so close, Draco's hearing simply stopped, replaced by a dull ringing in his ears that made his head careen and prepare to fall. He felt the calming draught break in his pocket as he fell, joining all the shattered glass over him. His ears gave him nothing but ringing, as he peered up blearily to try and see what was happening.
"Right!" Seamus said, nodding. "He was the last one to catch the Snitch all three matches in a year before you, right?"
"I can't think," Neville said, looking around wildly. "I can't even breathe. Will you please just pick some for me?"
"Potter," Draco deadpanned, "Did you not recall my earnest wishes that you had joined me in Slytherin when you had the chance?" Potter was startled into a laugh that was a full undignified snort before it was over, gaze dropping bashfully after as he covered his nose. "Have I ever said that I do not want you around?"
If Harry didn't find out, track Charlie down in Romania, and feed him to one of his dragons before he could answer.
At the same time, surprising Draco again, Weasley said, "He didn't do anything wrong, sir, he didn't mean to wreck anything, just the mirror, and he was trying to help Harry." Dumbledore smiled and raised his wand sedately. Wordlessly, every spare bit of debris reconstituted itself, and the water dried until the room was just as it had been before.
Potter didn't fall for the bait. "No," Potter said absently, trailing his hand along the banner of the staircase as they ascended, like for once he needed to touch it to keep his balance. "I just was imagining if Cedric Diggory
"If you intend to keep championing a cause," Dantanian said wanly, "Which today has reached its definitive close, then I will not hesitate to set something about on fire and leave you behind." Once they were out of the Apparition wards, he pulled her into a Side-Along Apparition.
"Draco," Severus said, "Wait in the other room. I will set up another bed, and you will stay here tonight, to sleep off your disgraceful inebriation. I will assist Mr. Nott before escorting him back to his dorm."
Hermione pulled them aside from the stream of excited Hogwarts students pouring back inside. The sight of so many people around to overhear made her walk them further away, casting a Lumos and leading him until they were hidden around the corner of one side of the maze.
"Especially his hair," Ron said, "He looks like Snape now, doesn't he? He says he's gonna keep it that way." Thomas and Finnigan made noises of derision, and Draco tossed his hair showily.
But after all, that seemed a good sign Harry could end up spending the summer with them rather than the Dursleys, a prospect Draco very much hoped for, with or without the prospect of adoption. At least some of the summer would seem only fair, and Draco intended to keep his resolution to fight for it. So that was more than enough to explain why Harry was happy up on the top floor with Draco, without any need to clue Sirius or Remus in on... ulterior motives.
"Do you mean Draco Black?" Harry corrected gently. She checked the scroll, nodded wide-eyed, and shoved them each their scroll before positively fleeing the compartment.
Halloween was poised to be unpleasant, but he didn't see how they would get around to blaming it on him, unless they thought he helped Potter beat the age line. He contemplated warning Potter in some manner, but he couldn't think of any way that wouldn't make him just look guilty.
Weasley flushed bright red. "Alright, fine, yeah, I get it. Come on. Get under. We have to go somewhere forbidden in the castle. Harry took me to see it this way last night, and since then, he's been really different." Weasley flung the cloak over himself, vanishing like he'd Disapparated somehow within the walls of Hogwarts. Then the watery feel of the cloak was spread over Draco's shoulders too. He ducked his head underneath, letting Weasley cover them both, and looked down to see his body had vanished just like Weasley's.
Sirius did admirably, keeping from losing his cool all but once. He patiently repeated his denials to Fudge and Umbridge's increasingly transparent insistences on the official narrative.
Draco's breath was steady, but he felt a prickling behind his eyes that he had to fight away. "Are you saying I'm too fucked up to produce a Patronus? That you can't make one if you hate yourself too much?"
Draco was soon mercifully delivered with more boys to pretend to fancy instead of Potter. The announcement went up in the Entrance Hall on the 27th of the impending arrival of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, which Luna called an inauspicious date for the information to be shared. "I don't know why," she said with a frown, "But whenever I think of the tournament, I get this strange feeling it's not going to go well. I keep seeing portents in Divination about it, and Professor Trelawney keeps giving me bad grades on assignments. But it's what the tea leaves
, if that was the right way to describe whatever was inside- had somehow sensed he meant to replace him, and decided to get rid of the competition now after all.

"Yes, we do! And now the Gryffindors can come hang out here if they like. I'll get to see them more too! For one, I imagine
he reminded himself. Then a drenched Potter had the temerity to look even better wet than dry. He was shivering as he stared over at Draco, returning Draco's wave with a worried look.
Draco stole looks at Harry and then Sirius, both of whom looked as though they'd sooner spend their holiday with Nagini. "Well,
"Oh!" Harry said, actually drawing his wand right away in excitement. He bit his lip, green eyes very big above it, as he rolled up the sleeves of his hoodie and advanced on Draco. "You mean I'm going to be binding
feelings for? How would anyone know that? Would we say, or would there be a spell that would just know who we like-"
"Was that your first kiss?" Draco blurted, and Harry's eyes shot up, color going at once to his cheeks, and it was obvious then and there- this had been the sticking point after all, the reason Harry couldn't bear to speak to him or touch him or even look at him. This was what had Harry staring at him like a Dementor ready to kiss away his soul.
“Hermione it’s a pregnancy potion mixed with lust potion of ancient time, with this chances of getting pregnant is 100% so if I’ll get pregnant maybe Harry will take things forward, you know he’s been very distant lately.”
In the end it turned out to be a very good idea. Cause when he confronted him, after a little wand fight & resistance Draco broke down in tears. It was shocking for Harry to witness him crying, something did hurt in his chest, he didn't know why tho! Draco told him everything.. how his life is in danger & what dark lord is intended to do with him! Harry took him to the professor Dumbledore. Professor Dumbledore summoned professor Snape & they talked with Draco. After a discussion they provided Draco a shelter. They moved Draco from Slytherin’s quarters & gave him personal room near the library. & Dumbledore told Harry that now Draco is his & his friends's responsibility. His friends were not happy in the beginning. Hell even he was not happy either. But after a while Hermione & Ginny came around. Under the layer of arrogance there was a witty, funny, smart & charming boy! They immediately liked this new Draco & became close friends with him. Tho Ron never really accepted him as a friend. Harry was nearly inseparable from him ever since he became friends with Draco! They were now really close friends! But unfortunately for Harry, He fell in love with Draco! even before he can stop himself!
"I think it's the potion, Hermione." Said Ginny heavily. "It's much more stronger than I anticipated. Maybe-Maybe it's too late for us to save.." she couldn't even finish the sentence. She felt a lump forming in her throat. She was feeling immense guilt.
Draco was looking at her with sadness. He knew very well how difficult that relationship was for her.
"Wow! I- I'm speechless.. I just realised how childish I was being!! You- you understand him so well! If I didn't know any better I'd say you're in love with him!”
"Harry are you okay??!! I think you should go & lie down! You got lost again. Take some rest mate" Ron said with worry.
After hours of reading, One potion among these caught her interest. It was named as "certus graviditatum". This was mentioned as one of the most powerful, dark & fatal potion. After reading the details of it, she got intrigued by it. An idea popped up in her head. Her lips curved into a smile. This will definitely fix things between them, she thought.
"It-It's a combination of  a lust potion & pregnancy potion of ancient time. It arouses the man who consume it, to the extent that it creates the strong feelings of euphoria within him. All the love he bears in his heart surfaces & creates great ecstasy. It's far more intense than simple lust, cause this ecstasy arises from PURE LOVE & not from any physical attraction. It leads to love making which results in guaranteed  pregnancy, it creates a 'love child'. A child born out of pure love. & once it is conceived no power in the universe can stop the birth of that child, Not even the gods above!"
"Ron it's not time for being childish. Draco is our FRIEND. Besides he's close with Ginny, he might know something." Said Hermione.
With everything I’ve been through, she is the best thing that happened to me. I am the closest with her, she’s like the younger sister that I never had.
Finally they saw one figure sitting alone on one of the tables. It was Ginny. Harry was nowhere in sight.
She couldn't hold her tears anymore. She laid there crying for a while & then eventually fell asleep.
"You're frowning 'mione. & why do you keep looking in Harry's direction? I'm noticing this for a while now, is anything wrong?" Said Ron.
"So Why isn't he here with you then?" Asked Hermione. She too was very angry at Ginny. She really wanted to know about Harry's condition.
“Of course it is! It’s one of the very rare & ancient book, I got this as a gift from my dear friend. I’ve read it like 3 times already!”
he was struggling under Harry to get himself out of Harry's grasp, but he was not succeeding at all.
Draco glared at him & then he turned to Hermione. "If there's anything wrong you can tell me, I'll help you if I can." He said genuinely.
It feels like she doesn't know him anymore. She didn't fall in love with this Harry. He was a different human.
