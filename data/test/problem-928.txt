He finds everything else he needs- a plate and a knife - in another cupboard, and even a kettle and some tea. It isn’t much, but it makes for a good breakfast, and it doesn’t take long before half of the rolls are gone. The other half, Harry decides, will be kept for later. Merlin knows when there’s more food. A quick search of the kitchen reveals it to be empty of anything else. He leaves, his search for the owner of the voice now pressing in his mind.
A voice bellows through the Atrium and Harry's shoulders sag in relief. Junior Aurors swarm the place, forcing the reporters to give way for the men clad in green robes: Healers from St. Mungo’s, lead by nobody else than Harry's husband.
Obviously Hermione and Ron weren’t so sure if it was right to have any contact with Malfoy. They constantly questioned their connection and it took almost two years to finally make them see that, yes, he and Draco were meant for each other.
“Pansy was devastated, you see, because Finnigan had a hand in her blouse and you don’t want to know where she had her hand in turn.”
It’s their anniversary - the day of their first date, not the wedding - and he’s driving himself crazy for some time now. This year it’s his turn to plan something and he is at a loss what to do.
Grey eyes blink furiously to focus in the dim light before they find his and Harry falls in love once more with the depth and the sincerity of their expression. It was the first thing that caught his attention all those years ago, after the war, after everything was said and done and Harry was left with no plan in his life. They always broadcast everything so clearly, so openly, vulnerable but strong at the same time. They never once betrayed him, even when words tried to.
It was Harry who took away the pain, who supported Draco when everything came tumbling down on him. He never used his mighty name, never fought for Draco in public, but was supportive in every way Draco could imagine.
Harry tries to be a temptation on his own. He knows Veelas not only like a good show of their mate’s qualities, but they like to watch and to be wooed in every possible way. It’s almost the same with a human partner, but still a bit different.
He likes the weight of the knife in his hand and decides that it’s the perfect tool to teach an unforgettable lesson about loyalty and treachery and that one doesn’t fuck with the Chosen One and his loved ones.
With a pleased sigh, Harry turns on the spot and Apparates directly into the entrance hall of Grimmauld Place. He slowly sets the parcel down, gets out of his Auror robes and puts them on the hook next to an exquisitly tailored cloak. It costs a small fortune, but every time Harry sees it hanging next to his plain old Ministry robes, his heart swells and butterflies are let loose in his belly like the first time he saw it.
Draco complies without a hitch, taking over the movements. He uses his arms for leverage and pulls away before snapping his hips hard and going back down, taking Harry in as far as he can. He stays there for a second, clearly enjoying the fullness before he picks up again.
“I want to go to Spinwitches,” Harry says. Usually he has to wait for a long while before Ron allows him to drag him there after a visit. Malfoy merely shrugs, a small smile tugging at his pale lips, and says “Sure.”
“Won’t the others not be suspicious if they see us hanging out?” Harry doesn’t really mind what they will think, but maybe Malfoy does.
Harry smirks, does another round of laundry and heads to the kitchen. He has an appetite for some fried eggs and enough time to satisfy his urges. A self-inking quill is already waiting next to a fresh piece of parchment.
As he closes his eyes, letting his mind slip into the oblivion of sleep, he thinks about Harry and that their love helped him deal with so many obstacles before. He dreams about Harry’s sweet smile, his insightful knowledge how Draco’s mind works and all the small and big ways how he helped healing the wounds of the war by simply being there and listening when Draco needed it.
It’s the perfect place for them to take a stroll, enough space to not disturb the wings, but with the beauty of Wiltshire and the first stars as company. Harry hums in contentment, his thumb slowly caressing Draco’s. They don’t need much words in moments like this.
It’s horrible, what those kids had to endure during their captivity, especially the girls, and an army of Mind Healers won’t ever make it alright, but at least they stopped the madmen before anything more serious happened. It’s a small consolation, but in Harry’s book staying alive is still a better option.
“Please, Sir, please,” Draco’s voice is wrecked by arousal and fear, but he doesn’t dare say ‘no’ to Harry. If all else fails, he can use his safeword, but in their thirteen years together, he only used it three times. They know each other and their limits well enough.
Malfoy trails off, but it’s enough information to paint a gruesome picture. He can understand what Malfoy means. Harry is bulkier than him, knows he isn’t bad looking, but he’s a far cry from someone with centuries of considerate breeding, the extravagant limbs of noblesse. He swallows the bile that’s been steadily rising in his throat, shakes off the disgust that tries to settle in his bones. There’s time to really think about what happened in this house, what might happen in the next hour. It’s just not right now.
“Why would I think that?” Harry asks. His eyebrow is still raised and he finally understands why Malfoy uses it to underline his sarcastic statements or disbelief.
While Draco and the Veela are one, they are separate beings too. It’s hard to explain. They belong together, but they don’t. They share the same body, the same thoughts, the same mannerism, but they don’t. Sometimes when Harry looks into his husband’s eyes, he can see the creature stare back beneath the mesmerising grey. In the beginning it freaked him out, just a little bit, but now he’s as familiar with Draco as he’s with himself.
It took an hour to regain his composure and explain the whole thing to his boyfriend. Orange lilies symbolise hatred and the withered flower clearly indicated that the former hate Molly Weasley felt for him, had slowly died, just like the lily.
Her voice is soft as she caresses the plain black surface. Her eyes travel over the horse, before landing on Draco. He lowers his gaze immediately, just in case. He isn’t forbidden to look, but he doesn’t want to risk bad behaviour when they’re out. He sees her smirk out of the corner of his eyes but keeps his head down.
With a frantic “NO!” the otter weasels its way between them, then launches itself right into Harry’s face.
As Harry stands in front of his wardrobe, he ponders which coat he will wear today. It’s a quirk he won’t ever admit to, but he likes to choose the colour depending on his mood. Draco always tells him he has an atrocious fashion sense, and maybe he has, but Harry learned early how powerful colours could be to the mind. And despite having a husband worthy a supermodel, Draco never even notices that Harry is manipulating his moods with subtlety.
It’s already weighing heavy on his conscience, and he knows it’s his fault, and only his, that that little girl will likely die before the week is over. If he hadn’t been so stupid as a teenager, hadn’t followed his father like a good, mindless crup, he wouldn’t be tainted by the crimes he was forced to commit during the war. Maybe he’d have even fought on the right side and people would now look up to him, like they look up at Harry.
Nevertheless, Harry has learned to eat when the opportunity presents, so he carefully eases the tray with the freshly baked bread rolls out of its contraption and sets them on the table. A creek startles him badly, but when he turns it’s only the door of a cupboard, revealing an untouched jar of strawberry jam. He thinks about the possible consequences of eating strange food in a strange place, but his instincts don’t tell him that it’s a trap. They’ve been an invaluable help during the War, so Harry trusts his gut feeling more than anything else.
Nevertheless he has no choice in the matter, so he pulls his best robes from the closet, midnight blue with small silver stars, and goes through the motions he learned at the tender age of four. Brushing his teeth and his hair, taking a nail file to clean the ragged spikes he calls nails before applying clear nail varnish, making a mess out of things just like three decades ago. He gave up on immaculate beauty around the same time that the Dark Lord burned his Mark into his arm. He likes fashionable clothes and a nice cut, but that’s the end of it.
Draco’s eyes are screwed shut, giving himself over to the rough throat fucking and the pain like a good sub, and he can’t be any more beautiful than he is at this moment, when Harry comes with a strangled scream. His sub takes it all, panting harshly through his nose.
Next to the door that leads from the room, lies a crimson robe. Harry picks it up, surprised but not, when he finds his own name stitched to the inseam. It fits him perfectly, just like the strange jeans and jumper do. In the pocket he finds his wand, the only thing that is somewhat familiar. It gleams in the weak light, freshly polished like he’s never seen before. Whoever he is now, whatever version of Harry, he obviously takes good care of his things. There’s a spark of curiosity in the back of his mind that wants to know more, like how old he is, but the voice calls for him again and the thought is forgotten in an instant.
After a war memorial service, they stayed at Hogwarts, lingering on the Grounds, hidden by a series of Notice-Me-Nots and Muffliatos as Harry fucked every coherent thought out of Draco just behind Greenhouse 3. Clearly the Mandrakes were in the peak of their puberty because Harry could hear their excited chatter, some of them even cheering him on to go harder and faster. The isolated windows muffled their screams enough that they didn’t pass out, but their potent voices seemed to egg him on even more, making Harry weak in the knees and frantic with lust.
Draco whines when Harry’s hands let go of his throat and wrists and he’s pulled down from the horse. He pants heavily, the rush of adrenaline slowly receding.
He spent the day mostly by himself, although his friends asked him every few minutes if he really wanted to be alone. “No problem Harry, you can join us,” they said, but Harry didn’t want that. They are all on some post-war euphoria that includes a lot of cuddling, kisses, and extended snogging sessions in the common room. Thinking of it, almost everyone went and found another. Ron and Hermione, of course. Neville and Luna are a thing now, just like Pansy Parkinson, of all people, and Seamus, who is disgustingly besotted. There are Parvati and Terry Boot, Ginny and Dean, Hannah Abbott and Millicent Bulstrode. Michael Corner is dating someone from a lower year, just like Blaise Zabini. The castle is full of couples and Harry is an island of seeming loneliness amongst them. But he feels good. He doesn’t need a significant other, he’s content by himself. Sure, physical intimacy might sometimes be nice, but it isn’t anything Harry can’t do with his own two hands (and a couple of magical toys). He is a teenager after all.
Sydney: I googled who is the most sexually open and it's either Australia or Iceland. Since I thought Iceland is too cold in July (now that I think of, it's winter in Sydney, so that's not really the point) I decided on Australia and Sydney. Which brought up the problem that everything happens inside an opera house and of course the Sydney Opera House doesn't even have privat boxes. So we have to chalk it up to artistic license.
It looks delicious, just like every other year, and Harry’s heart aches with bittersweet familiarity.
Descending the stairs is hard since he has no feeling for heights, but he manages without an accident and only two almost-slips. As soon as his feet meet the rotten floorboards of the ground floor, he hears the voice calling for him again. It’s soft, maybe muffled, like the person wants to call him, but is afraid they are too loud. Why they would be afraid to call out for him, he doesn’t know. Despite the eerie feelings the house provokes, Harry hasn’t seen anything dangerous. He doesn’t know if that’s a good sign.
It’s why they don’t do this often, only on special occasions, but since next year he enters a new and exciting stage of his life (Hermione’s words), they won’t have time to indulge in drawn-out fantasies.
Draco is nervous. It’s been a long time since he allowed Harry to see this special side of him, but over the last few months the creature inside him got restless, and so did Draco.
Then there is a period in his life that he doesn’t remember at all. After the war, when he was suddenly drained, no adrenaline to fuel him anymore. Not battles to fight and nobody left to rescue. It was a bleak year after the war, full of tears, vastly shed and desperately hidden.
In the middle of the room, supported by an old stool, cowers Draco Malfoy. He’s grown up as well, is bloody and hurt, but Harry immediately feels hostility rising in him. There’s no question in his mind that Malfoy is the culprit of this. He’s the reason Harry can’t remember growing up or doesn’t know why he’s here or where ‘here’ is. And it doesn’t matter, not anymore, because Harry will make him take it all back, be it giving the memories back or turning him into a lanky eighteen-year-old again.
It makes him suspicious. Malfoy in general makes him suspicious (and he was right all those times before), and he thinks about refusing. Thinks about the wand in his hand. About the fact that he hasn’t seen a wand on Malfoy, who is weak and doesn’t seem to expect an attack. It would be really easy to overpower him. He actually looks quite pretty, in pain and bloody like he is now, Harry thinks, surprised at the thought, but not.
When Harry laughs, he does it with his whole body. He bends at the waist, one hand going to his stomach, the other hand braced on his knee. Between the hearty guffaw he wheezes, small puffs of air that Draco finds equally appalling and endearing. It makes him smile and soon they’re both laughing daftly.
What’s more important is that it’s never quiet around their cottage. Harry needs the wireless like he needs air. It’s always emitting music, and it doesn’t even matter what programme they’re listening to. It can be Celestina Warbeck, who has become somewhat of a guilty pleasure for Draco (not that he would ever admit that without torture), or some of that confusing Muggle Hip Hop.
Harry finds Malfoy cowering between two bookcases, like the frightened coward that he really is. He doesn’t seem aware of the danger he’s in, preoccupied with wiping blood away from his bare chest. He doesn’t wear a jumper, his trousers are almost shredded away. What’s left of the fabric is drenched in blood and other liquids Harry doesn’t want to think off, so he lets that fact go.
“Didn’t know you were such a jester, Malfoy,” he says, an indignant eyebrow raised. He almost regrets it, when he sees the light in Malfoy’s eyes go out and the slight smile fall flat.
And, alright,  maybe Harry has some Bad Habits too, he thinks as he sits on his hospital bed, a distressed nurse bandaging his badly burned arm in Murtlap-soaked gauze while his enraged husband prowl back and forth, left and right through his private room. They actually named the whole wing after him, the Harry-Potter-Magical-Emergencies-And-Maladies-Wing.
“Why are you hurt and I’m not? I have a few bruises, I think, but you look… Malfoy, quite frankly, you look horrible!”
When it gets emotional, Draco trusts in different Muggle singers like Dido or Katie Melua. He has a playlist for workouts, for parties, for dates with Harry and even one for particular naughty sex.
Harry grunts at the appropriate places, nods sometimes or smiles when he thinks Ron needs some assurance, but he is barely listening, lost in his own thoughts. It’s so homely, sitting in the den of their cottage, his husband sleeping, his best friends around, after a home-cooked dinner, and a Firewhisky in his hand.
In the end, everybody comes around, even if it takes some years and, for some, is still taking time.
Or the first time he fumbled his way through sex with some nameless guy in the broom closet at the Auror office. Glenn later dropped out of the training, deeply hurt that Harry hadn’t wanted a relationship but fast and uncomplicated sex, once he got a taste.
It’s a mistake to open the door, but neither of them could have anticipated that. The door, sturdy, ebony wood, and copper hinges, makes an ominous, creaking sound before sucking them inward, trapping them inside. The darkness swallows them and fear is rising in Harry, reminding him of a cupboard long gone. He doesn’t know where up and down are, seemingly suspended in nothingness. He reaches out, trying to find something to hold onto, but there is nothing. Just darkness.
He strokes the sweat-soaked hair, love evident in every movement. It’s not uncommon for him to break character during their sessions for a minute or two, especially when he makes Draco suffer fiercely, but his dragon is always too far gone to notice. As soon as Draco overcomes his desperation, he slips back into his role as Dom.
Harry's birthday is about a week away and Draco is slightly panicked. He’s been thinking about the gift for a very long time and has driven himself into a tie between smug satisfaction that his gift will be the best Harry will ever get, and paralysing terror that it will be a huge mistake. This isn't helped by the fact that Hermione is equally unsure and delighted by the idea.
The question seems to come out of nowhere, as Draco turns to look at him for a second before he remembers their rules and lowers his gaze. It doesn’t go unnoticed, though.
He can see the annoyed eye roll, hear the pained sigh. His husband, for all that he is a romantic sap and a cuddle monster, hates corny professions of love - or nicknames. ‘Babe’ is the only one Harry can get away with, at least sometimes. Anything else Draco will protest faster than Harry can finish saying them. He remembers an epic argument at the end of their second year as a couple, when he wouldn’t stop calling Draco ‘Honey’.
“Kind of stupid how this turned out, huh, Potter,” Draco says, but his voice is soft and melodic, and even his sneer has no edge.
When they part for the night with promises to meet again to avoid the happy courting, Harry feels lighter and happier than the months before. Who would’ve thought that the person he gets along with best nowadays is Draco Malfoy, his former nemesis and all-around pain in the arse.
He grabs for the soft mounds, still a little foreign in his hands, and wiggles them around, pushing them together and letting go. They jiggle softly, not much to jiggle anyway, but it’s enough that Draco tries to shy away, embarrassment clearly written on his face. Harry gives him a warning slap on his arse just to remind him who’s birthday this is. It’s like a chain reaction to both of them.
Harry vanishes the crushed tomato, and levitates the others, all with the wave of a hand. He's become pretty good at wandless magic, Draco notices as a surge of lust shudders through him. It shouldn't be so hot, but it is.
At first, he thinks it's Lucius Malfoy, and he has his wand raised before he even finishes the thought, ready to curse the bugger into oblivion. But then he takes a closer look. The differences are subtle - the hair is different, not as long or slicked but shoulder-length and soft-looking. Matted with blood. The build is both slighter and bulkier. The hips are slimmer, but the shoulders are more pronounced. The skin is milky white and clearly visible under the torn jumper.
With stiff knees Harry stood up, just then realising Pansy and Blaise had been there the whole time, silently watching their interactions. They both wore a soft smile and Harry knew it was another fight he had won. They never doubted his relationship with Draco ever again.
The way Draco first kisses up and down the length, feathery soft, a teasing whisper of what’s to come. He knows the exact time he can spend on kissing before Harry becomes impatient, so he switches to kitten-licks that drive him even more crazy. And he’s fast about it. One second he laps blissfully at the precome on Harry’s tip, the next he mouths at his balls. It tickles a bit but the sensation oddly mixes with the surge of lust that runs through Harry’s veins.
Pansy must have seen something in his eyes, because she leans over, and tells him in a sickly-sweet voice: “Don’t get used to it, I haven’t forgotten what you did to my favourite hat.”
The hallway to the small bar is crowded with wizards and witches from seemingly all kinds of nations. There are two Indian women, dressed in colourful saris, talking to two women wearing hijabs. There’s a group of men in scarlet robes, not unlike his Auror uniform, but the robes are only half-long and are combined with golden bloomers. Every one of them is wearing a decorative sword and broad peacock feathers. There are people who are dressed formally in suits and dresses.
Draco does turn his head away, trying to hide his burning face, but Harry doesn’t let him. He lets go of one tit and forces him to face the masses. There’s one man who watches them with hawk’s eyes. He licks his lips when he notices their attention and raises his drink in a silent thanks for the show. Draco chokes on the gesture, his squirming intensifies.
And, he realises, he doesn’t need to make this last walk on his own. He’s the Master of Death, which means that death has no meaning for him anymore. He can command it just like he can command his broom. It’s a gift, probably the last one he will ever get, but this once Harry doesn’t hesitate, doesn’t mind being selfish, like the brothers.
Harry wakes with a start. His head hurts, his muscles scream at him, and his throat is parched like he hasn't had something to drink in ages. Despite all that he's relatively comfortable. He isn't in his own bed in the eighth year dorm, but the mattress is soft and the blankets warm. Through the curtains falls soft, dim light, typical for a winter day in Scotland.
He watches helplessly when the mother sneers at him, pulling her baby closer to her chest as if to protect it. His steps falter and he briefly wonders if he should argue with her. Draco knows it’s futile. Regardless what he says, it won’t make her change her mind.
“Just some ingredients for potions. Steph is a master at Herbology.” He waves his hand, like this explains everything. Maybe it does.
As far as information goes, it's absolutely useless, but he doesn't get more, because suddenly Malfoy starts to scream. At first, Harry thinks it's just for show, he knows Malfoy has a flair for the dramatic, but he soon realises it's completely different from the Buckbeak incident in third year. Back then the git had cried bloody murder, barely able to refrain from laughing between his fits.
He can’t remember all the words, not even a handful of occasions, but he remembers probably the most important one.
It takes some time before the words really hit him. Before he realises that Harry has had enough. That he wants to leave. Not because Draco is sick, but because he won’t let anybody help.
That’s the moment Harry clears his throat, eyebrow raising in question. The girl looks up guiltily, like he caught them in the act, and Harry’s heart pounds painfully in his chest. He thought they were over this, over those devastating secrets of the past, of sneaking off to do who-knows-what. Malfoy, in turn, doesn’t look guilty at all, but he has his poker face on. Suddenly it seems Ron is right: Malfoy is, indeed, up to something.
There are bad habits and there are Bad Habits. Bad habits aren’t so bad and more likely adorable. Like when Draco rakes his hands through his mane whenever he’s nervous, destroying his perfectly coiffed hair. Harry finds it hilarious and endearing, and that wrecked look sometimes gets him hot and bothered.
Slowly recognition seeps into the flat gaze. Malfoy tries to get up from the floor several times but then just sinks back against the couch. His palms leave bloody fingerprints on the wooden floor, but he never takes his eyes off Harry. Like he’s afraid Harry might vanish if he looks away for the barest second. Finally, he stops his struggles and just sits there, shoulders slumped, posture defeated.
The tumbler of firewhisky is almost empty and Harry lets the last sip of it roll around his tongue, savours the heady flavour of honey and sherry only Glenmorangie has, glad he was introduced to the finer whiskey brands. Just as he sets the tumbler down, his present moans again, this time weaving actual words in it.
Harry raises an eyebrow in surprise and question. Apparently he and Malfoy are on a first-name basis, not that he can remember how that could come to be. He wonders what to do. He’s in a strange house, he can’t remember his life past eighth year. Maybe he’s trapped, maybe not, but aside from himself and his school nemesis, there’s nobody else here.
He soon developed another way out, letting his fantasy run away to exotic places in far away countries. Of course he was always the hero in his stories, fighting evil Muggles and dangerous dragons, rescuing the prince or princess in distress, finding the lost treasure. It was so easy for his mind to slip away, to explore and just experience a freedom he could never have in the cage that was his sophisticated upbringing.
Over the years they explore more of the Muggle world. Paris, Venice, Rome, New York and one memorable night at the Forbidden City, and Harry will never admit out loud what they actually did there. There were quite a few things that were forbidden up until then, and they shattered a lot of inhibitions on top of the golden roofs.
For now, Harry has planned to climb the Kilimanjaro. Draco was surprised by his plans, stating that it was equally impressing and stupid to go mountain climbing when one hadn’t ever done something like this before. Harry knows, but he sees the promise of the Veela whenever he comes home from his tiring training sessions and he knows the sex will be worth the effort.
Harry peels the sheets from his body and scoots over to the edge of the curtains. His muscles scream in agony, but the pain feels pure like after an intense Quidditch practice. Or several of them. His brain thrums away in his skull, but that pain is also manageable. Only when he puts his feet to the ground, everything is wrong.
The slender, white legs are parted by a spreader bar and decorated with intricate leather strips. They crisscross from ankle to upper thigh where they meet with an equally exciting leather harness. His present has rolled over onto his stomach, to relieve the pressure on his hands bound behind his back. The spreader bar forces him on his knees which in turn highlights the fine, firm arse.
“Shite, I need a new jumper,” he says to noone in particular and is surprised when he gets an answer from Malfoy, who’s still watching him.
Draco had been up all night, wondering if it really was going anywhere, pressured by his guilt and the headline of tomorrow’s Prophet, which was surely going to be devastating for the both of them.
It all grinds to a halt when he finally, finally, puts his hand on Draco’s chest. Both their breaths stop for a second. It feels different than usual, obviously, but Harry would have never imagined how so. It’s a soft mound, barely enough to fit his palm, but warm and soft and perfect. He wants to pull the dress down right this second and take one of them into his mouth, but he has to be tame as long as they’re in the open like this.
Sometimes he thinks about mundane things like his first kiss - and he can look at it now from the distance of decades and smile at his teenage insecurities and shortcomings.
He keeps himself still, listens for any sounds in the house and smiles when he hears a faint moan from somewhere above. The walls aren’t thick, but the actual noise has to be quite loud to be heard down here. Harry picks the parcel up and wanders up the stairs to the first floor, stopping right outside the sitting room.
There is a story there, but, even after countless years of being married, Harry and Draco have secrets. Nothing big or life-changing, they have a very open relationship, but small things. Like the reason Harry still carries Dumbledore’s Snitch around or Draco won’t tell him where he vanishes to every 2nd May from noon to six in the evening. There are couples that share everything, but they never felt the need.
The room is completely unfamiliar; it's not a dorm but looks like a real bedroom. A simple door leads to a bathroom, a fact he's making use of immediately. The water that comes out of the ancient-looking brass faucet tastes like copper, but it's refreshingly cool and soothes his parched throat. With the water, his headache finally recedes until it's only a soft thrum in his skull, light enough to ignore it altogether.
As he sinks onto the sofa now, emotionally exhausted by the day and the knowledge that he could have helped if people would have let him, Draco closes his eyes. His head pounds from a headache, but it isn’t the debilitating pain he experienced months before, but a mere inconvenience and a sure sign for stress.
Harry loves this about Draco. Despite all the teasing he still does, all the snark he can’t quell no matter how hard he tries, he knows what boundaries he can cross and what should be left to rest for eternity.
Harry gives the tits a few more slaps, then presses his mouth against them. The skin feels hot against his lips, and he can’t help himself and decorates them with another chain if hickeys. Tomorrow, Draco will look even more like a slut, soft bruises, and dark marks everywhere.
Some chapters were reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally hard to write, and others.... were not. This one came to me when I was at work, thinking what on Merlin's Earth I could write for this topic (and another chapter, maybe I'll remember which). Anyway, this is what came out of it ;)
Harry helps him straddle the thick cushion. Draco sees that the sides are slightly slanted, reducing the space to sit quite a bit. It’s not obvious on the first look that the sides slope down, but he realises why almost immediately. His centre is settled on a relatively narrow cushion, his weight pushing, his legs pulling him down. It gets uncomfortable rather quickly, although the horse doesn’t look like it. The leather is high quality, soft and warm under his fingers as he subtly tries to brace some of his weight on his arms to relieve his core. The longer he sits, the headier he feels. The magic of the wood slowly seeps into his clothes, igniting a spark. His cock stirs. Draco blushes and hopes nobody is paying any attention to him.
“Huh. Then we are,” Dumbledore says, and the white morphs into brick walls and benches, their wood soft from millions of people who rested here before.
It’s the one with whips and crops, which is quite interesting to Harry. It’s a kink they explored very early into their relationship, but decided that it wasn’t right for them. Well, Harry has to admit, he liked the way Draco’s pale skin would turn a soft pink, the noises he made when his hand met his arse. It was Draco who didn’t want to pursue it further. Seems like he wants to try again.
Okay, maybe he slightly exaggerated, since Harry has it worse than him, but deep down Draco is still a selfish bastard and he really hates those fancy-schmancy evenings when people look at Harry like he hung the moon and the stars (which he absolutely deserves) and look at Draco like he is the vilest creature that ever crawled out of the sewers (which he also deserves).
There is nothing worse for Draco than boredom. When he was a child everything that he might have enjoyed was quickly forbidden and he vividly remembers the hours he spent in his father’s study, getting lectured on proper behaviour for a Malfoy. Whenever he had time to do what he wanted - riding his training broom through the narrow halls of the Manor, playing hide and seek with the House Elves or simply reading a book that had a different topic than history - his father would soon put an end to it, dragging him off to the study for some ‘quality time’ between father and son.
It can’t be too expensive, Harry is very adamant about such things. But it mustn’t be cheap either, since what’s left of the Malfoy pride refuses to have an anniversary with cheap Tesco wine and chocolate.
They both love to have sex in strange places. Their first 'special' sex had been fairly normal. It was at night on a park bench near Buckingham Palace. After the most intense orgasm of his life so far, Harry had confessed that the hottest thing hadn’t been Draco riding him to oblivion, but the fact that they could have been caught any time. The way Draco’s cock twitched at the notion was all Harry needed to confirm that they had the same fantasies.
It’s a sign of their deep devotion, of the love between them, that they still are together, dealing with their issues, and still are willing to put up with each other’s bullshit, knowing full well that despite the endless talks, nothing will change. Bad habits, small or with capital B and H, will always be a part of their relationship, but Harry and Draco have found a way to live with them. And love with them.
He turns and unexpectedly sees an otter. It’s not a real animal, but an apparition of light. His mind fumbles for the knowledge and finally dredges up what he sees. It’s a Patronus and not just any, but Hermione’s. She’s calling to him, begging him to stop, and for a moment he feels inclined to do so, but the pathetic sobs Malfoy cries beneath him are too much of a distraction, and he turns again, ignoring the animal.
Since Harry’s childhood hasn’t been a well of endless joy, he likes simple, sometimes childish things best, like watching the telly, riding a bike or visiting the zoo.
He remembers the delicately carved saltire she displayed last year, exquisite ebony and dragon leather, the leather rubbed with Appetentia for heightened pleasure, more intense orgasms. The potion is forbidden in Britain, but the saltire was made in Spain and it is not illegal to import products made with it. Calliope confided in him she made three years worth of rent just selling this.
He puts everything back into the box and stashes it under the kitchen sink - a place Harry will likely never see. Draco is pleased with himself and Hermione. They did the best they could and hopefully it will be a gift Harry loves.
Today it’s a failed potions experiment at Diagon Alley that made everyone within a mile sick. It was a tricky case since usually the purple end of a Puking Pastille is enough to conquer almost every form of sickness, but not today. Until someone finally found the cure the whole emergency area was full of vomiting people, the stench a challenge for even the strongest stomach.
But Harry surprised him when he wanted to know everything about the many adventures Draco had experienced. He asked the right questions and even encouraged Draco to do it more often.
He thinks about what he just witnessed. Elitist pureblood Draco Malfoy enjoying chocolate like it’s the best thing in the world. Better than superiority or bullying other students or even Quidditch. He remembers the huge parcels his mother would sent him at the beginning of every school year and realises that those deliveries stopped sometime in third year. He’s sure there is a story behind it, but he won’t ask, not today. They’re having a good time, the third week in a row, and their easy friendship (when did that happen?) is still fragile enough that Harry doesn’t want to strain it with imposing questions.
Then a branch breaks right beside him, but he knows it’s not one of the Death Eaters, coming to get him. He turns, smiling.
Today is a rare occasion. It’s an uneventful week for the both of them. Crime rates are down due to the heat wave that fries Britain for four weeks and counting, and people seem to suffer too much from the sweltering heat to raise their wands.
“We’re still on for Saturday, aren’t we? Three o’clock at the gates?” Malfoy asks, trying to keep his voice normal, but Harry can hear the fear underneath, the insecurity.
Draco is still blushing like a virgin, his gaze flitters from shelf to shelf without looking at them too long. It’s endearing how prim he is, despite their passionate relationship and his work as a Healer. He barely is able to talk about it without an embarrassed grimace, and sighs dramatically whenever Harry gets around to dirty talk. He still explodes every time into tiny pieces and Harry loves to put him back together afterwards.
Almost immediately he frowns at the unknown feeling, the weight restricting his movements. He has yet to find out what it really does, but Harry is glad to help. With only the tips of his fingers he caresses a sensitive spot on Draco’s hips. It’s equally ticklish and arousing and normally Draco would squirm away, trying to escape the sensation.
First the air was filled with flying cups, plates and Grandma Weasley’s ugly gnome figurine, then clothes flew everywhere.
He goes over to Calliope, greeting her and exchanging pleasantries. His gaze never leaves Draco, noticing his every move and, more importantly, waiting and watching what will catch his husband’s attention. He’s always subtle, only hidden glances and inconspicuously coming back to the same shelf over and over again.
Draco gets up and steps between Harry’s legs. He’s blushing again, and Harry has seen him looking at the auditorium. While it’s highly unlikely that anybody sees them, it is possible though. However, with his back to the open space, there won’t be much to observe. Not yet anyway.
Harry thinks it's a nice gesture,  Draco always tells him spitefully that he 'donated' more than Lucius to St. Mungo's just by the fact that he's there almost twice a week. Because he's reckless, he can admit that. The years should have been quiet, with Voldemort gone and nobody to take up his slack. It seems the times of evil, megalomaniac Dark Lords are over, but despite that, Harry still gets injured on a regular basis.
“We’re Aurors. Well, I’m not really an Auror, but I belong to a different division inside the DMLE. I’m a Cursebreaker. This is a joint mission between our two subdivisions, all orchestrated by the Department of Mysteries. They sent us here to clear the house. We’re sure there are powerful artifacts hidden, as well as this house is believed to be the hideout of the necromancer we’ve been trying to catch for several months.”
After the war another time in his life began, and while he didn’t need to hide inside his mind anymore, Draco liked to think about the worlds he created, the story that hid around every corner of his fantasy.
When they enter the Ministry, they are swarmed by reporters. The children cling even more to him, terrified by all the ruckus. Of course the disappearance of five children in five days caught everyone's attention, but now that they're all safe, reporters are the last thing anybody needs.
There’s a small smile breaking through the haze of pain in Malfoy’s face. It oddly transforms him, makes him prettier, less edgy. It’s freaking Harry out that he notices things like this.
Malfoy is rambling, his eyes blank as he stares ahead from his prone position on the floor. Harry is at a loss on how to help him. He’s looking for something useful, like how to perform first aid in a situation like this, but except for
After getting ready to work and doing the laundry just like Draco asked, he sets to leave his own note.
“Since you’ve been a naughty boy, I decided to take you down a notch or two. Your constant nagging and violent fits don’t suit a good sub and I think this might be a good outlet for all that anger and frustration in you. It’s called a humbler and you will get real close with it tonight. Maybe after some quality time you will calm down a bit. If not, we can always play with it again. Let me show you how it’s used.”
“You see, this house belonged to the French nobleman Gille de Rais. He was a war hero, fought at Jeanne d’Arc’s side against the British. Later he was found to be a serial killer, kidnapping, raping, and killing children from villages all over the region. The necromancer was actually one of his accomplices, Francesco Prelati. I don’t know why he surfaced now, but he obviously set out to revive Gille de Rais. Only, he didn’t resurrect de Rais, but somehow melded his spirit with the house, creating something sentient. The house is keeping us from leaving, and it’s trying to keep us separated… although it worries me that it allows for us to meet occasionally.”
Exhaustion is pulling Harry down into its abyss, now that everyone is safe and they’re back at the Ministry, and the weight of the boy is getting heavier with every passing minute. It was a horrible week and an even more horrible day and if he could just rest for a minute, that would be enough to pull through the next hours.
Draco’s still wearing the black leather collar which is clearly out of place, but Hermione, of all people, helped him choose an appropriate neckband, although she’s asked a million questions why Harry would buy something designed for a woman. After tonight, he and Draco need to buy a dress that matches the neckband, so they can give it to her for Christmas.
His dragon shakes with pleasure, gooseflesh marking his perfect body. His hair is tousled, the perfect state destroyed by Harry’s eager fingers and the dampness of sweat. He’s breathing heavily and Harry can understand why: being pleasured for hours on end without rest can do that to you. He doesn’t have mercy, never has for things like this, and he knows Draco’s limits by heart.
“I know. Although nothing can mar the beauty that lies beneath, don’t you think?” His playful tone quickly falls flat again.
On Friday, he’s elated like he hasn’t been in a long time. He hopes whatever wrackspurt is causing his joyous mood stays around for a while, because he can almost get used to this feeling of simple happiness.
Draco pets the snake’s head, finds the worn fabric surprisingly soft. One eye is missing, the other one replaced with a black button. The stitches are sloppy, obviously the work of a child, but it’s charming and Draco imagines a little girl with auburn hair, her emerald green eyes fixed on the needle. At the tail is a crooked “L” embroidered. Did Lily ever learn how to sew properly? Did it matter? Probably not. Lily Potter’s qualities, no matter what they would have been, can be summarised by a simple phrase: She saved Harry.
“Ah, yes, your birthday present,” Calliope says from further into the shop. She isn’t visible in the dim light, but it does nothing to reduce her dominant presence. Draco feels her even more, reigning over them like a queen. He swallows nervously at the slight tension in the room.
“I couldn’t have wished for a better present,” Harry says and means every word. “Although there’s something not quite right, don’t you agree? You can’t go with a collar. It doesn’t match the dress at all.”
He feels the moment when Draco gets too enthusiastic and the humbler works his magic. Just like with crawling, Draco’s movements are restricted, and the more he moves, the more it hurts. His tongue falters, but Harry will have none of it. He tightens his grip on the wet strands and forces Draco’s face right back.
Something whispers to him, not the voice from before, but something else, something more helpful. It tells him that he and Malfoy are alone in this house, that Malfoy is helpless, that nobody will hear him scream. He only has to find the fucking traitor.
A shudder runs down his spine, although he can’t pinpoint a real reason for it. His head is a bit jumbled, a bit bruised, just like his body. There’s this itch, something that begs him to stop and see, but it’s muted and seems far away.
Draco is fucking his tongue in and out of Harry’s hole, moaning from more than just pain. His hands spread Harry’s arse cheeks even more and he dives in, sealing his lips around the rim, sucking wetly. He alternates his licks and his sucking in a steady rhythm, driving Harry slowly insane. When he starts nibbling, Harry can’t hold back anymore and starts moaning alongside his dragon.
He has never felt pain this strong, this all-encompassing like at this moment. The otter burns through his skin, his flesh, into his core, eradicating the shadows that have taken a hold of his mind. He hasn’t known they were there, but the agony of them leaving lets no room for doubt.
Draco flinches, part of it in fear what Harry’s about to do to him if he disobeys. Their scenes are hard sometimes, bordering on extreme, but it’s how they both like it. And they both have safe words in case something goes wrong or they both underestimate the power of their fantasies. It happens occasionally, but it’s a permanent process of learning each other’s boundaries.
He is just about to add the powdered sugar when two strong arms close around his chest. Draco flinches - Harry is stealthy as a cat when he wants to - and firmly squeezes the package. The sugar scatters in all directions, painting them both white, mixing with the mashed potatoes but, thank Merlin, doesn’t get near the chicken. Draco looks dumbstruck, his mouth opening and closing like a fish, as laughter booms behind him.
There’s only a handful of things he finds useful; how to dress properly, and appear to be aloof and confident, or how to walk and talk and move. But of all the useless things he learned and that are still seared into his brain, speaking the language of flowers is the most useful.
Draco suddenly appears at his side and Harry’s voluntary solitude ends in the best possible way: with a kiss and the promise of more as soon as they are home.
While he’d been tending to Malfoy, he tried to remember anything, but there is a huge blank space in his mind. Between a winter’s day at Hogwarts and now seem to be some ten-odd years, maybe more, but whenever he tries to recall something from his past, Harry’s brain starts to itch in a very uncomfortable way, getting unbearably stronger until he stops thinking, stops trying.
The water is cut off as Harry steps between him and the shower head to get wet. He reaches for the body wash, his eyes still fixed on Draco, and begins to soap himself up. When his hands reach his cock, Draco has to look. He licks his lips, watching a clever hand slick the hard member up, stroking up and down with deliberate motions. Harry doesn’t want to come yet, he just puts on a show for Draco, who is intrigued and at a loss what to do next. Does he want to watch or does he want to participate.
Harry fears the first Saturday every couple of months. He defeated Voldemort when he was seventeen, he chases dark wizards for a living and he lives with Draco, who can be a scary bastard if he intends to. Still he fears those dates more.
The room is dark, only small stripes of led-lights (and that Draco knows and recognises them says a lot) illuminate the small paths, and bright spotlights highlight the displayed goods.
Ginny begging him not to make a mistake, not to rush into this scam of a relationship since Draco only wanted to use him.
He knows it's normal, even for Veela mates, and he and Bill are in some kind of challenge who the bigger dork is when the allure gets too strong and they do stupid stuff.
There’s a rush on the stage, and it interrupts Harry enough that he becomes aware of his own pressing problem. Between his very fitting trousers and a wiggling husband, he barely gets his fly open. He’s just as wet as Draco.
“What did she give you just now?” he hears himself ask, even though he knows that Malfoy will lie to him.
Together they make their way over to the tables, which dangerously bow under the weight of pans and pots, plates and glasses.
The door unexpectedly opens and familiar footsteps announce his husband. Wide grey eyes meet emerald green as Harry pushes his Auror robes off his shoulders. They land on the bunch of Draco’s carelessly tossed away Healer robes, crimson red and lime green, a fitting analogy for their own deep bond.
It's a cold Walpurgis Night. Draco pulls his cloak tighter around himself, but the shivers don't subside. He feels ill, part of it the headache that hasn't let go since the early hours of the morning, the other part the sick anticipation of today. He always comes here alone.
Harry isn’t surprised to find Malfoy in the library on Monday evening, furiously writing on an essay for Charms, for the same reasons. They are comfortable around each other now, working on their homework and occasionally complaining about the antics of the couples. Seamus and Pansy have been sneaking off between classes. They laugh for a good solid hour about it, imagining McGonagall's face when she finally caught the lovebirds.
The picture that captures Draco’s attention is dark, almost black. He can barely make out the body part that is pictured, which is, probably, a female breast. What’s more captivating is the small golden hoop that glints in the light. It looks ethereal, like some kind of star with its own corona. The light breaks around the delicate lines, simply executed, but it’s what makes the ring so beautiful.
Special thanks, again, to hmn007, who did a great, perfect, beautiful job beta reading and gave some valuable input!
“I hate to urge you on, but we don’t have much time and there are others who want to see you.” That breaks Harry’s calm immediately. Draco is right, of course, he can’t afford to linger in the past. Surely he will have enough time for that when all is over.
It’s the 30th of July and he finally has left the Ministry behind, has wished everyone, both important and not so, a nice weekend, and now he’s free for two whole weeks. Being the Saviour of the Wizarding world hasn't got a lot of perks, but getting his holiday in time with his birthday every year is surely his favourite. He has just a few more errands to do, a little more shopping before he can go home and hang up his Auror robes.
He looks around the overgrown path, remembering the peacocks showing off their beautiful plumage. He remembers the bright flowers that were his mother's pride, the ethereal white horses on the paddock near the woods.
One day Harry showed him how to create playlists - a series of songs that play in a specific order - and ever since Draco’s life has its own soundtrack.
The piercing cry of a baby sends a jolt of fresh pain through his skull. The mother desperately tries to shush it, but the wailing only gets louder. Draco exchanges looks with Healer Neill and collects the file from Mediwitch Goldblum. The mother eyes him warily, obviously recognising who he is.
After the war he had been severely depressed, guilt and shame weighing him down as well as the people. Everyone was always staring at him, judging him for his failures, never for his accomplishments. When he started Healer training at St. Mungo’s patients refused to be treated by him, always reducing him to the ugly Mark on his left arm.
They don’t have time to do this very often. Harry is going to be the next Head Auror and Robards is keeping him busy every day and more nights than Draco cares for. While the Dark Lord was a prime example for a megalomaniac mad man, he wasn’t the first and certainly won’t be the last.
He gracefully sinks to his knees. The water has washed away the suds, but the skin still tastes slightly lemony, almost overpowering Harry’s natural musk. He sets to work, quick and clever strokes with his tongue, sweet kisses and firm suction and Harry writhes under the onslaught. It doesn’t take long for him to reach his climax and he shudders and moans as he gives Draco everything.
With a snap of his fingers, the collar springs open. Harry carefully takes it off and sets it on the mantle. He sees the faint red lines it’s imprinted on milky white skin. He runs his hands over them, feels Draco shudder, and feels a surge of fierce pride he can’t really explain. Despite his grief about his age, Harry often thinks he must be the luckiest bloke in the world whenever he comes home to his precious husband.
There is the tree house George and Ron built for Rose and Hugo and that will soon be used by the next generation of Weasley kids.
Malfoy’s face is scratched to hell, there’s a shallow cut on his temple still bleeding. When Harry looks at his bloody hands, he sees a fingernail missing completely, the others ragged and broken. The pinkie on his right hand is oddly askew, surely broken.
Draco gives curt and sharp orders, snapping at an unfortunate photographer who didn’t get out of the way quick enough. Harry sees that his eyes are clouded in pain - that damn headaches again - but when he kneels down in front of Mila and softly murmurs to her, there is nothing but concern for her well-being there.
The crash of the frying pan hitting the tiled floor is deafening to Draco’s delicate ears and makes him flinch violently, his hand hitting the basket with the cherry tomatoes, sending it over the counter.
Images flood his mind, coming and going fast, reminding him of the past three weeks. The first time they drank butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks, laughing about all the couples. The day they bought Harry new clothes and discussed Seeker’s gloves for nearly an hour. All the times they met in the halls between classes, greeting each other with a nod and a smile and a “Hey Potter!”. Malfoy’s undeniable joy at getting sweets. Hours in the library. Hermione smiling like she knows something he doesn’t. And suddenly Harry knows what she knows, probably has known from the first second. He likes Malfoy. Likes him a lot. Likes to spend time with him. Likes his smile and his sarcastic humour and his silent patience. Likes walking through the snow, watching fairy lights. Like a couple. He likes Draco Malfoy, is actually in love with him. And Malfoy is in love, too, he realises.
Calliope is a Dominatrix who either can’t let go of the personality or won’t, and she has to dominate the room and her shop at all times. In one of their tea-and-buy sessions she has admitted to love the power she holds over her customers and Harry can understand and accept that. He knows the rush such power brings, the enticement of control.
For a long time all that is to hear are different moans of pleasure and pain along with the wet sounds of a sucking mouth and furious wanking. Just before he actually blows his load, Harry janks Draco’s face away from his arse, eliciting more pain from the humbler, but he can’t bring himself to care right now.
A pop announces Harry’s arrival. They agreed to meet here, where nobody can watch. It’s a well kept secret between just the two of them. The air is heavy with anticipation. For Draco it’s always strange to give up the control over his body, to let the creature out. They are two different persons, even if they share the same body.
It will probably take months to clean up the mess the necromancers left behind. They will spend hundreds of hours bagging evidence, cataloguing it and filling files until Harry’s hand will beg him to just cut it off. On those days, he isn’t sure why he desperately wanted to be an Auror.
“What do you think, Dragon?” Harry whispers, voice rough, his timbre low with desire. Draco shivers at the pet name.
Harry saunters over, finally having had enough of just looking. He needs to touch, to taste and devour and he can’t wait any longer. He reaches out, barely touching the blond strands, just enough to let his present know that he is there. He strokes up and down, slowly increasing the pressure and it isn’t long before his fingertips gently scratch and massage. The moan comes again, now with a note of comfort and Harry savours it.
The hallway is open, pompous, with ceiling-high windows, thick columns, and wide arches. There are rich, crimson curtains and gilded ornaments, a stark contrast to the plain and dusty bedroom he just left. Light shines through the stained-glass windows, but it looks wrong, artificial. The hall isn’t dark, but the more details Harry tries to make out, the more they evade him. He thinks he can see cobwebs and thick dust in the corner of his eyes, but when he turns, everything looks perfect on the surface.
“Let’s get back to the castle, shall we?” Malfoy - no, Draco - asks and grabs Harry’s right hand with his left. They lace their fingers together, the grip tight and not willing to ever let go. Harry nods and they begin their walk back, but then he stops.
Pansy sees him first. “You look like shit”, she says in a charming and warm way that all Slytherins seem to have in common.
As it comes closer, Harry can make out its features. The wings catch his eyes and it’s not the dying sun colouring them golden, it’s their very own colour. They are big, bigger than a Hippogriff’s and rich like Harry would imagine an angel.
The Opera: For those who didn't get the "hints": It's Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, probably one of the most known operas, I think. I have seen it like, 15 years ago in music class, so I mostly followed the Wikipedia entry for any information.
It seems like an impossible demand, but Harry is the living (not for much longer, though) example that even the impossible can be achieved if one pushes their boundaries far enough.
One by one, every mistletoe in the street comes loose and follows the pair. When Harry and Draco stop to kiss, each piece vanishes under Draco’s cloak, getting back into the small package with the green ribbon.
“Ha-harry?” he asks timidly, obviously noticing that something is wrong. There are many things wrong in this world, but Harry is about to rectify some of those things. He smiles at the cowering mess before his feet with as much kindness as he can muster, which is none.
Without a word he rushes to the bathroom, throwing himself down to hug cool porcelain, but all that happens is dry heaving and bad cramps in his stomach. At least the room is dark.
They eye each other for a moment, like old friends, before Harry nods again and walks over to the platform. He passes through the brick wall, but this time his hands are bare and he is alone. He doesn’t think he will need much where he’s going and he understands that some journeys must be taken alone, but he still wishes for company.
Someone is calling him, so Harry peels the sheets from his body and scoots over to the edge of the curtains. His muscles scream in agony, but the pain feels pure like after an intense Quidditch practice. Or several of them. His brain thrums away in his skull, but that pain is also manageable. Only when he puts his feet to the ground, everything is wrong.
The initial cut is easy, although the bloodcurdling scream it provokes grates on his nerves. The crescendo of voices paralyses him for precious moments, but as Malfoy’s voice dies out in a coughing fit, there is still a second voice frantically shouting.
On some days it’s incredibly hard. Sometimes Draco has to fight to keep it together for hours on end; when the pressure of society is crushing his spirit and making it almost impossible to do his job. A Healer needs to be strong for their patients, unwavering and willing to endure. He’s all that and more, but some days it all seems futile. When his every step is met with hatred and contempt, when doors are slammed in his face, sometimes quite literally.
His hands grab Draco’s hair harder, almost yanking him forward on his cock, finally breaching that skilled throat. From then on it’s an artless face fuck, but Harry doesn’t care and only wants to reach completion.
Pansy is bustling around, wearing Draco’s “Kiss The Cook” apron, a wooden spoon in her hand, wielding it like a wand and barking orders at Blaise, who dutifully stands by the side and chops vegetables. It smells heavenly of strong spices and fresh ingredients, but Harry can’t help wondering where Draco is. They haven’t noticed him yet, so he clears his throat, trying to get their attention.
It’s bitingly cold and Hogsmeade is covered under heavy layers of perfect snow. Icicles adorn every roof and everyone is bubbling with pre-Christmas-excitement, despite the wounds of the war fresh in their minds.
“Put me back in and then come sit with me,” Harry says, a bit kinder but not less demanding than before. Draco lets him go, giving his dick a cursory inspection for residual come, then puts him back inside his pants and trousers. He’s a bit shaky from kneeling too long, so Harry pulls him into his lap, for once nothing sexual on his mind.
The hoarse voice gives Harry plenty of ideas and he isn’t the only one taking interest. Despite the sated tiredness he felt minutes ago, he is ready for another round of earth shattering sex.
He feels lonely some days. It isn’t like he’s dependent on Harry, Draco is perfectly capable of living his life on his own. He just doesn’t want to. Harry is the balm that soothes his soul - or something equally corny. It’s true, though.
He turns to the mantle, where he’s put the long, thin box with the neckband not moments ago. It was his only stop between getting back from his mission and coming home.
Feelings rush through Harry’s veins, a heady mixture that sets his blood on fire with want. He wants to shout his passion into the sky, make the world witness what he can’t put into words.
It’s a sentiment to the situation that Draco doesn’t try to refuse, not that he could talk back even if he wanted to.
The question is mumbled, much like Draco was already about to succumb to sleep but decided otherwise the last second. His voice is raspy, and Harry smirks. He did that.
“No.” It’s all Harry’s mind can supply as he sinks to the ground, more devastated than he thought he could ever feel. “No.” Of all the things that could happen, all the horrible things he’s seen during the war, he never once thought this would be the one to break him. He has a hard time comprehending what he’s seeing, hasn’t even, in his wildest, darkest dream, thought this could actually happen.
Draco is a pro, though, so he’s swallowing everything without complaint and stays put when he’s done lapping it all up. His cheeks are rosy, and Harry can imagine how wet he’ll be underneath the dress. There’s no danger that Draco’s going to come without permission, and it needs to be given explicitly, which seldom happens.
They all share a quiet moment - Harry’s throat is so dry, he can’t reply even if he wanted to. His mother kisses him on the cheek, a whispering sensation that burns like fire. In this moment Harry is sure he will never forget it, the feeling of her lips on his skin, and he doesn’t care that she isn’t here with him but already beyond.
It’s the coldest day so far, but it stops snowing when they meet at the gates. Malfoy is wrapped tightly into his thick, black cloak, a Slytherin scarf draped around him, nearly covering his whole face. His grey eyes gleam brightly, the emerald green only highlighting them. Harry swallows, his throat suddenly dry, but then he remembers what happened in the dungeons and whatever he wants to say stays stuck in his throat.
The words are harsh, hurtful. If he had the strength to flinch, he would have done so, but as it is, Draco can only watch his husband running down the hallway. It’s been so long, he doesn’t even remember when he’d seen Harry this angry. Maybe never. But he stays silent, doesn’t know what to say when faced with those accusations. Those threats.
“Well, I don’t see why not. We’re alone, it’s dark, and I clearly gave you an order, although I can surely repeat it if that’s what you want. Although I don’t think you’ll like it if I have to ask twice.”
Despite all the magic in the world, it takes about a month for his nipples to heal properly. Draco is impatient, but he knows he can’t rush the process or it might take much longer. His nipples ache in just the right way, and the itch he’s feeling is purely sexual. He wants to test them, wants to play with them. They seem like the best decision he’s made in a long time - which is, of course, the reason that Harry has to go abroad on a mission just in time for the healing to be done.
Harry finally stops, but only because he is tired of the teasing. He’s eager for the next step, or steps, of their session. He gets up from his knees, picking up the leash that dangles forgotten from the collar. A slight tug signals Draco to get moving and, like the good sub that he is, he almost immediately begins to crawl forward.
With a sigh he sits down as well, propped up against a small tree trunk. It’s his favourite place in the world and Harry wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.
It takes some time, but she finally lets go of Harry’s hand and follows one of the other Healers. Immediately Draco is up again and talks to Milo.
The lights in the drawing room are dimmed, just some forgotten fairy lights around the fireplace. The curtains are drawn tight, to fend off the summer heat and set the right mood. It’s cosy and comfortable and Harry feels the stress of the Ministry disperse, feels the peace sooth the hurt of everyday life, of criminals running free. Years ago he felt guilty slipping out of his Auror skin so easily, but all he feels now is contentment. He’s here and he enjoys being here. He can worry later, and he will. Just not now.
“I had a feeling you would need me today. Ron is covering my shift since ‘Mione and the kids are in Cardiff with Ginny. For all he complains about her clinginess, he is so easily lost without her. He’s bored out of his mind and couldn’t agree faster when I asked him.” Harry laughs.
nothing comes to mind. Maybe he can at least wipe away some of the blood that flecks Malfoy’s pale cheeks.
(Also I needed to change the POV so we can end on Draco in Ch. 30 and make the connection to the beginning of the verse.)
So for now, all they have are the various nieces and nephews, godchildren and children of friends and all of them love their Uncles Harry and Draco. They invade the cottage sometimes, limiting the precious times they have off their jobs, but it’s just such a delight to see them play in the garden, chasing wayward gnomes and squirrels, building castles in the little sandbox, cooking gourmet cuisine with mud. It’s all very domestic and soothes the slight hurt in Draco’s soul when he remembers that none of them are his own.
He remembers the many tears spilled on both sides, his own impotent fury that nobody was giving him a chance, not one benefit of doubt. Molly Weasley in desperation that her Harry was seeing a Death Eater, throwing his life away.
Veela-Draco needs to be handled more subtle; Harry needs to build the anticipation carefully so Draco decides willingly to let his creature out to play.
“So what’s going on between you two?” Ron audibly swallows his bite down, sputtering and coughing. Mrs Weasley would be outraged at his blatant show of manners, but she’s fortunately not here and everyone else at the table is used to his antics.
Draco follows them to the centrepiece of the shop, that strange stand. Upon closer inspection, the leather looks extremely soft and inviting. It’s the highest quality someone could ask for, but it doesn’t surprise him. Everything in this shop is exquisite and expensive. He graciously kneels beside Harry as Calliope starts to explain.
Harry smiles when he finds the note on the pillow next to his. The other side of the bed is cold, but his heart is warm and full of emotions.
They end up in Honeydukes. Harry likes it well enough to enjoy shopping there, but he has never seen someone’s eyes brimming with joy like Malfoy’s do as soon as they enter. People look at him in annoyance or anger and Harry can’t resent them for it. They all know what Malfoy did. But surely they can’t stay mad when confronted with the delight that’s written all over his face. He seems almost reluctant to touch anything, to get too close to the displays, as if he won’t be able to hold himself back, once he lets his restraints slip.
And it’s just so ridiculous, Harry laughs again. That’s a match he would’ve never thought possible, but somehow it still happened. Of all the couples around the castle they both seem like the most fake one, but also the most genuine one. It’s a strange contradiction, their relationship, but Harry’s the last one to judge. Not when he has his own secrets.
There were so many first times, and not the obvious ones. Sure, their first kiss was magnificent, and the first time they had sex - there aren’t words to describe that.
It can’t be something as simple as going out for dinner. They do that often enough that it wouldn’t be special, and the restaurants they usually don’t visit are too expensive and Harry would never agree to that. Or enjoy eating there, for that matter. Despite Draco’s best efforts, his husband never liked the high society the Malfoy name can still give them access to, never liked the stiff and impersonal atmosphere of Michelin Guide restaurants.
Which is why Draco presses closer against him, trying to melt into Harry's embrace. They're sweaty and it's too hot to be pressed together like this, but only an emergency could make Harry abandon their bed now. He slowly strokes through the soft, white-blond strands, twirling them around his fingers.
Sometimes Draco feels the sharp pang of longing. Before everything happened - before the war, before his creature was awoken, back when he barely hit puberty, his mother had filled his head with a fairytale. She told him that one day soon he would marry a nice pure-blood girl, and they would have an heir. Then he would be Lord of Malfoy Manor, surrounded by his children until they grew old enough to have kids on their own.
Next come specific touches and small gestures, that don’t mean much to Draco, but Harry knows the Veela registers them, waits for them with building anticipation.
His gaze wanders up, pleased to see the black leather collar. It had taken some time before they used it in their sessions, but now it’s an essential part of their playtime. He knows the collar is soft to the touch, nundu with polar fox lining, comfortable to be worn for hours. The row of silver buckles is charmed to only open at Harry’s will or in case of an emergency. It’s the most obvious claim of ownership and the primal part in him loves it nonetheless.
The voice calls for him again, so he walks forward, leaving the grand hallway and trudging down a flight of stairs that has seen better days. They lead to a parlour that is dusty and unclean. The curtains here are mouldy, the colour of old cheese and powdery moss. It smells like mothballs and decay, like rotten plants and brackish water.
Are you ready? Read on your own risk, and please keep in mind that it's merely a bridge to the actual sequel that is going to come soon. I can't make promises when that'll be, but I made it my resolution to write more and I'll try to keep it ;)
Sometimes he struggles with his own barrenness, the Veela demanding to be useful. It doesn’t understand that procreation doesn’t work with good intentions and a strong will, and it’s unhappy, feeling neglected and robbed of its true purpose. Draco often has to fight the, somewhat, ridiculous demands the creature has.
St. Mungo’s is busy today. Draco has been on his feet since four in the morning, replacing Healer Jackson, whose wife currently delivers their first child. The fourth floor is extraordinary uneventful, but the emergency room is full of sick children and the victims of a severe Quidditch accident. It’s a dangerous sport and despite Draco’s love for it, he sniffs in disdain whenever he treats an injury caused by a wayward bludger or the fall off a broom.
It makes Draco wish for another time, back when everything was fresh and exciting between them. Not that their relationship isn’t exciting now, but it was quite different back then. Every day had held a new discovery of themselves, now facets of Harry and things Draco hadn’t known about himself before he entered a relationship with somebody who really belonged to him.
Harry can't help the bright grin on his face. It’s absolutely ridiculous and the more he thinks about it, the funnier it gets: His big, bad Veela-husband, the incarnation of sex and passion, turns scarlet the second they enter the sex shop.
Even if they have their problems sometimes, he can always count on Harry to support him and take the pain away.
Although some memories are bad, the good ones outweigh them by far. It’s enough to fuel an army of Patroni. And it’s necessary doing the job he does.
Harry catches Hermione’s eyes and gives her a short nod. She waves her wand, a slow movement, much like a baton and music plays softly from somewhere. Draco holds his breath and begins to count in his head. At thirteen they have to do the first step, at thirty eight the first twist and at two hundred ten everything will be over.
His husband is frantically grabbing for something to hold onto when Harry uses both hands to pull on the piercings. They’re magically reinforced and can’t damage the nipple in any way, but they still hurt - and obviously in just the right way. Precome is gushing from Draco’s slit, fat drops that look and smell delicious. His lips are moving without rest, probably begging, if he’s still present enough to form words.
Harry lets his gaze wander upwards. The midnight blue dress falls softly around his legs and accents his narrow hips. They swing sinfully as he walks down the stairs. Small diamonds catch the light, making it look like it’s embroidered with actual stars. When his eyes land on Draco’s chest, Harry’s breath stops for a moment.
When he pulls forcefully on one of the hoops, Draco nearly shoots off his lap. His moan is hastily silenced by Harry’s hand. With the right stimulation, Draco could be so loud, even the passionate aria that is sung below wouldn’t be enough to drown out his pleasure. On a whim, Harry produces the panties from his pocket and wedges them between Draco’s lips. At least he can use both hands again.
“I’m sure that will go over well. ‘Hire Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, to advise you on style and public presentation. For references see Harry Potter and the deceased Dark Lord, who didn’t listen to Mr Malfoy’s admirable sense of fashion - and look how that turned out!’ I’ll stick to my cauldrons and books, if you don’t mind.”
Truthfully it will be a reward for Harry, but his sub is content to serve, so it may as well be for him.
By the time an owl taps on his window, carrying a small note from Harry that he’s staying at Ron’s for a few days, Draco has spoken to Healer Merrygold and is currently pumped full of potions. Merrygold whirls around the room, casting diagnostic spells in between harsh lectures on common sense, awful Healers and cantankerous colleagues.
Harry wakes with a start. His head hurts like a bitch, his muscles scream at him, his throat is parched. He’s not at home in his own bed, not at the Burrow or at Ron’s and Hermione’s, and it takes an embarrassingly long time to recognise his surroundings.
He also remembers the first time they kissed and it was also a moment full of doubts, of what-ifs, before Harry had leaned down, touched his cheek almost hesitantly, his emerald green eyes questioning and Draco had closed the gap, throwing everything overboard. He hadn’t wanted to make the first step, had been afraid he was reading the signs wrong, the surreptitiously glances and barely-there touches.
Draco doesn't know what Harry has planned. They talk about kinks and how to explore them often enough, but never in concrete detail. It's always Harry who makes the scenes come alive and that's how Draco likes it best. He's just not creative enough and it astounds him just how plentiful, mean, and erotic his husband's fantasies can be. He's a completely different man when he's in 'dom mode' as he calls it, and Draco is helplessly at his mercy.
They all turn their head as Harry appears with Draco by his side. Draco’s hair is a bit messier than before, but his flushed cheeks and rapidly heaving chest deflect from this small imperfection. It helps that standing up and walking clearly shows his raging hard-on. Some men and women smirk knowingly at them, but there are people reacting quite oppositely, turning in disgust and murmuring behind their backs.
“Let them think what they want to. I’m sure they will come up with a believable explanation.” With that he picks up his bag and leaves.
The magic of flowers is very subtle, but even those who don’t know about it understand it to a certain extent. Back then, Draco had crafted a beautiful bouquet of asters, bluebells, irises and purple hyacinths. It’d been hard to come by all the different plants since it was in the middle of a particular cold winter, but he managed just in time. The flowers spoke the words he couldn’t voice. They spoke of love, asked for forgiveness for his sins, begged for friendship, expressed his hope for a new beginning.
Harry didn’t hesitate and wrapped his arms around him, caressing the soft, blond locks, murmuring soothing words.
It’s when he sees the creature more often looking back at him that he knows it’s waiting for his bold declaration of devotion and strength. Whatever it is the next time.
Carelessly Draco lets his robes fall from his shoulders, followed by his shirt. They pool to his feet and he cringes inwardly, but he isn’t the one responsible; the Veela can’t get rid of the clothes fast enough. It’s a bit embarrassing how eager it is to finally be let out, but Draco can sympathise. He’d been a prisoner long enough to have experienced the cravings of freedom, no matter how short the time was.
Sometimes, on very, very rare occasions Harry records his own voice, telling stories about that one time a young Wizard and his friends broke into a bank and stole a special cup and fled on the back of a dragon. Draco was scandalised at first, protesting that they couldn’t tell children what happened in the war, but with a little help, the nasty reality was morphed into an exciting tale that was suited as a good night story.
He has specific songs for specific situations at work. For stressful days he prefers the Weird Sisters; Myron Wagtails raspy voice has the unique ability to just “blow” the pressure away.
For all the danger Draco poses to people who are dumb enough to cross him, as soon as they’re in bed, he turns into an almost submissive cuddly type. And Harry doesn’t mean sex, no. He means literal cuddling.
“Urgh, Malfoy, there’s a mistletoe above us.” It’s all he can say before Malfoy’s lips are on his and they’re kissing. Harry’s brain freezes for a second or two, unsure if it’s the cold or the fact that Malfoy. Is. Kissing. Him.
He hasn’t seen Draco since his departure seven days ago, only a glimpse of blond hair when he Flooed in. Not enough to satisfy his deeply seated desire to just look at his husband and hug the hell out of him. Their relationship is fairly sexual, but it’s those tender, chaste moments that make his life perfect.
A deep rumble in his belly reminds Harry that he hasn’t eaten properly today, between a new case disrupting his Saturday morning and a long investigation in Cornwall there hadn’t been enough time for more than a hasty cup of tea. He winces when he hears a loud clang in the kitchen, the slight headache that accompanied him for most of the day suddenly getting stronger.
It's a BAD HABIT Harry can't seem to break him from, no matter how hard he tries. Even years of promising that he is forgiven, that everything is well won't do anything. It's infuriating, really.
Now it's all soft touches and whispered love and maybe Harry wants to stay in this carefree bubble a little longer.
Draco half moans, half breathes a “Yes sir”, turned on by the prospect of more crawling around, presenting his ass to Harry, and, as he moves forward, he swings his hips in a lascivious way, forcing Harry to suppress a moan so he doesn’t give anything away. He’s a sensual creature, his dragon, and he knows how sexy he is, how hot he can get Harry with simple movements, a look, a word, a perfectly placed hand in inconspicuous places.
The fantasies changed then. He wasn’t the brave adventurer anymore but the damsel in distress, rescued by a golden hero who had suspicious resemblance to a certain Boy-Who-Lived. He spent many hours dreaming of is rescue, barely holding it together in front of the Dark Lord or his mad aunt whenever they decided to have a stroll through his mind.
There were many things that had been whispered in Harry’s ears over the years. Countless plans during their time at Hogwarts, confessing dreams during the long days while searching for Horcruxes and sharing fears in the furious days after the final Battle.
When he’s in position Harry spreads his arse cheeks. His hole is hot and swollen, and despite his willingness to tease him even more, Harry can’t wait any longer. Draco’s still tight, but smooth enough to glide back in. He shudders when Harry hits his prostate, so he does it again. They fuck for a minute or two before Harry comes up with an idea.
His tongue spears Harry’s rim, dipping inside the tight muscle and it lights his prick on fire. He speeds up his wanking, wondering if he should shoot his load now, quickly realising that if it isn’t now, it will be a long time before he has the chance again. That’s not a reason to rush things, though.
It might not be Harry's own bed, but he isn't worried. Someone is calling him, the voice female and somehow familiar, but he can’t place it.
“You should think about becoming a tailor. Or an image consultant or something.” It bursts out when he sees Malfoy critically raising an eyebrow, rubbing his chin as he contemplates if orange is one of Harry’s colours. He’s - obviously - a summer type, whatever that means.
The hallway allows only one direction and Harry follows it, but he has the strange feeling that it’s too long and that he doesn’t get closer to anything. It feels like ten minutes already that he follows the blank walls, but he can’t really tell. There are no windows, but the light never changes, no matter how far he goes.
Seemingly out of thin air, Calliope, the owner, materialises before them. She’s an intimidating person no matter the circumstances, but today it’s especially strong. He barely suppresses the need to avert his eyes and bow his head. He shakes a little in her presence and curses himself for being this weak, this needy. It doesn’t make any sense to cower before her - there are strict rules in the BDSM community and Calliope would never even touch him casually without expressed permission, but he still feels the urge to present himself in front of her. Her presence is that commanding.
Decades after the war, years after he married Harry, the Ministry likes to remind Draco exactly what he did when he was a stupid and terrified teenager. He earned it, there is no question, but he knows it hurts Harry whenever his husband hears the snide comments and barely concealed insults and that’s why Draco hates going there.
They don’t speak as they walk into the village, watching the few people that still have to get Christmas presents. Harry walks a tad faster than Malfoy, still unsure of what he should do, if they should talk of if he should just let it go. They have something nice between them, something he never thought possible. Can he really throw it away on some chance meeting?
The sterile smell of St. Mungo’s burns his nostrils, the soft beeping of monitoring spells fills his ears. His mind is flooded with memories.
Today is an extraordinary stressful day at work and if Harry is honest, he doesn’t know when he last had a day that didn’t qualify as stressful. Probably any Sunday, but then they meet their friends, try to finish whatever chores are left from the week and, if there is still enough time, try to have sex at least once a month. Which happens less and less, since Draco is often plagued by headaches and Harry is just too tired.
Then came the Dark Lord and with him terror Draco had never known before. In the endless hours, trapped inside the Manor, not even his mind was a safe place. But the only way for Draco to experience any kind of freedom, between endless bouts of torture and abuse, was to let his mind wander, to relive his childhood dreams.
I'm back! Since everybody got some resolutions for 2020, I made some too, and while some of them include impossible things I somehow have to pull off, finishing this story was high on my list and even doable! The secret to success is simple: it was already finished, but not proof-read. I bothered the fiance for quite some time, but he just didn't do it, claiming 2 in the morning wasn't the best time to remind him of his obligations. Anyway, here are all the missing chapters. Please look at the end notes of chapter 30, where I will do some more explaining, seeing this was always meant to be the first part of a series.
“Shut up, Malfoy. I know you like all this sweet stuff and I’m pretty sure you don’t get it as much as you’d like. Merry Christmas… or something.” Harry steps out onto the streets of Hogsmeade, but he hears the silent “Thank you” nonetheless.
Music never has been important in Draco’s life. His parents never allowed him time for such a useless hobby, and of course it was strictly forbidden to create any disturbance with something so common as the wireless.
Calliope was delighted when he told her what he wanted to try. She has some experience and she readily described it in vivid pictures, all the pleasure that could be found using a humbler on a sub. Harry can see the appeal now as Draco tries to limit his movements, panting harshly against the pain, but the rosy colour of his arousal hasn’t abated much. He’s a slut for pain in the right dosage, just like Harry is eager to deliver it.
Temptation is something that is always present in his life, ranging from staying at home and let the Ministry fend for their own, from going out and burning down the Prophet headquarters.
“Crucio!” Harry bellows, satisfied when the curse hits an unsuspecting Malfoy, making him writhe in agony. He barely screams, which dampens that elated feeling inside Harry just a bit but not enough to stop. Only when he sees fat tears rolling down pale cheeks and flecks of blood flying from bitten lips, he stops.
Harry was tempted many times in his life, mainly to use blunt objects on stubborn people. He remembers some of those times fondly, like when Ron drove him mad in the dorms with his snoring, or that one memorable time when even Hermione had been bothered by her own voice and willingly shut up, even before Harry could give her one of his not-so-subtle looks.
He leisurely walks the room, around the palm tree, inspecting the boring portrait of some Black ancestor who is asleep most of the time. Everytime he stops Draco has to kneel by his side like the good boy he is, hands clasped behind his back. His knees must be sore and he needs a few seconds to get his balance whenever Harry stops, but the blush doesn’t recede and his breathing is still labored, so it can’t be that bad. And Harry loves the way he moves, the sway of his hips, lewd but so gracious at the same time.
It’s out of the question to find a surrogate, even if they never talked about it. Draco wouldn’t be able to allow some woman to carry his or Harry’s child. There’s just too much that can go wrong when involving another person.
The trail gets thicker and fresher as he slowly walks down another hallway. He isn’t in a hurry, finally understands why anticipation is half the pleasure. There’s something primal and animalistic in hunting someone down. It’s almost like he can smell the fear in the air, a thick stench of despair and agony creating an enticing flavour. He licks his lips as he rounds another corner.
The glasses are already forgotten when he pulls Draco down onto his lap. Harry leans forward, burying his face in his neck, inhaling the unique scent that is his husband’s. There’s an erratic thrum under his lips, and he can’t help biting down, enough to make Draco hiss, but not enough to break skin or leave a mark. A fact he rectifies a few seconds later as he begins to suck at the alabaster white skin, leaving a trail of love bites like a second collar. Draco moans softly, his hand fists in Harry’s suit jacket like it’s the only connection to reality he has. He’s not in subspace yet, and maybe he won’t get there today, but Harry’s going to do his best to fuck his brains out when the time comes.
At supper, a huge eagle owl delivers a tiny slip of paper. “Tomorrow, 3 o’clock” it says, nothing more. It isn’t signed but Harry knows exactly who sent it to him. He's kind of excited at the prospect and feels himself smile for a long time that evening. Hermione looks at him, both annoyingly and kind of knowingly, but he doesn’t mind.
Instead he watches the perfect backside arch into the pleasure, the bound hands helplessly searching for something to grab, something to hold onto, but there is nothing, just the gradual burning pleasure the plug gives. It’s not enough, not by far, but it keeps the fire going, slowly driving his lover mad. Harry likes himself some good bondage, loves the intricate patterns he can create, loves the attention he can pay to the body under his hands.
He has his hands full of two dozen jumpers and shirts, some in garish colours he wouldn’t even look twice at, but Malfoy insist he try them on. They have already finished the trousers (he was even allowed some new jeans), but Malfoy, that damn slave driver, has announced he will make Harry try some robes and jackets as well. They’re in the most expensive shop he has ever been, but he can admit that he sees and feels the difference.
Her voice is cheerful and smoky, so sexy it makes shivers run down his spine. It’s her special kind of magic - she can make the knees of any gender, and orientation, weak, wake desire where there should be none. Desire sparks through Harry, makes his stomach flutter and he feels a bit guilty that he has this kind of reaction. But that is just Calliope and she has this effect on everybody.
Still, the work is exhausting and Draco is so tired most of the time, that he goes straight to bed without much energy to do more than gulp down something to eat.
However, they refuse to let Draco help and no matter how hard he fought to make them see reason, they wouldn’t allow him anywhere near the girl. St. Mungo’s has his back, but they’re also powerless when faced with determined parents and stubborn patients. He tried to help Healer Neill from afar, but they both know it won’t do any good as long as Draco isn’t allowed to see the girl for himself.
Finally, he allows the cage to open, and vanish, with a snap of his fingers. Immediately, there’s another spurt of precome and Draco swells to fullness. It’s impressive how fast he manages it, although Harry hasn’t expected anything less. Together, they manage to pull the panties down and Harry stows them in his pocket. He allows Draco to sit down again.
He murmurs a preparation spell and slicks his fingers with precome, then roughly prods at Draco’s hole just to check that everything is fine. They don’t use much prep, both enjoying the slight pain that comes from plunging right in, but that doesn’t mean they don’t use any lube or prep at all.
It's already Friday here, which means HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY. Hope you like this year's present just as much as last year's.
Harry follows every move, every stroke of those golden wings, excited and, if he is honest, extremely turned on. With a chuckle he realises that it’s the desired effect. He can’t wait to get his hands on Draco, to touch those feathers, feel their softness.
Malfoy watches him the whole time with a self-satisfied smirk on his face, like he knows exactly what Harry thinks. But it’s okay. He really earned it, being patient and keeping Harry company today.
Whenever ‘Uncle’ Draco keeps an eye on his nephews and nieces, he feels bittersweet happiness. The gleeful little faces and chubby hands, holding onto him so tightly he barely feels his fingers after a few minutes, remind him of he fact that he and Harry don’t have kids and most likely won’t have them.
"Maybe one of us should sit down. We're no good togethers. A bit bold to assume this time it would work." There's no accusation in Harry's words. They're way past such petty things like your fault and my fault. Sometimes it's better to admit you can't do everything together.
When Draco opens the door, he wonders if he mixed up the doors. Instead of hospital dreariness, he steps onto a sunlit clearing. A small stream gurgles in the distance, accompanied by a happy, chirpy song of two starlings, huddled together in a tree nearby. Amidst the flood of wild flowers stands Harry, a wicker basket in one hand, his stiff Auror robes covering the grass in a makeshift picnic blanket. Magic permeates the air, a sweet and enticing smell that touches something inside him.
Alas, if you want to leave it like this, this work stands alone and can be seen as 30 chapters of domestic fluff and a bit of angst that was even resolved. Or you can follow me and we'll explore what I have planned, even if I have to admit it is a bit of a cheap turn of events. ;)
“You’re such a sap, Potter, it’s disgusting!” Draco smiles to take away the bite. He barely admits it out loud, but he adores Harry’s romantic tendencies. They make him feel wanted, loved, desired and many other things, a heady cocktail of emotions. He chirrups, an unintentional sound that comes from deep inside him, from the creature that shares his blood.
Harry doesn’t care. He leads them to a secluded corner with a small table near the bar and sits down. When Draco tries to sit next to him, he shakes his head.
Harry feels slightly ill, feels transported back to sixth year. He might not have used the Cruciatus Curse back then but something equally horrible.
They shake hands and she prepares a cup of tea. Harry is in a hurry to get going, but that’s another of her habits: she likes to take things slow, let the thrill of anticipation grow until it’s almost unbearable. She doesn’t do it every time he comes in here to purchase something, but always when he really wants to get home. She can play him like a fiddle and he suspects she enjoys this little power play.
The regular steps are far too high for Draco to make it, and while Harry loves to inflict pain, he isn’t that twisted. It’s just about adding a little spice to their lives.
The white marble has darkened with the years, but at least the inscription is still clearly visible. ‘Narcissa Malfoy, beloved mother of Draco’ is all it says. Dates are not important. Her sacrifice is.
He leads them to a private entrance, guarded by a single wizard. It’s refreshing to be in a country where nobody knows him or Draco, so instead of gushing nonsense, the bloke only compliments him on his stunning wife.
The feeling of closeness, of love, of brain-melting pleasure can't compare to anything else in this world. No drug or alcohol can mimic the ecstasy of a mind-shattering orgasm. And that's just the normal days.
Draco does, and the horrified expression on his face makes Harry’s dick twitch in interest. His arousal has subtly burned the whole time, but he allows himself some comfort and finally unbuttons his pants and lowers the zipper. The relive is instant and he sighs in contentment.
The song gets louder, more intense and now he sees something - someone - rise from the closed treeline and he is momentarily blinded by the last remains of the sun. The creature is illuminated by a golden halo, majestic and breathtakingly beautiful. Harry longs to touch it, wants to give all his love and compassion to it and never let go.
The Manor is dead, has been abandoned for years. Draco remembers the times when there were soirees, pompous balls and the occasional hunting parties. When the high society of the wizarding world would twist themselves into new and interesting shapes to get an invitation. Back when the Malfoy name meant something.
The centerpiece is a black stand with a thick cushion, and it reminds him of some Muggle sports device he's seen at Teddy's school years ago. The children vaulted over it, helped by something like an elastic spring, but that can't be it, especially not in a place like this. Draco doesn't think of himself as innocent, not even naive, but he's not as comfortable as Harry is in expressing his sexuality and often finds himself at a loss with all the fancy things that can be bought nowadays.
“Please, Sir,” he whimpers, not that Harry could be convinced by that - and they both know it. They’re just the most coherent words he’s capable of right now. Harry strokes him torturously slow, never enough to satisfy.
As soon as he can, Draco begins to babble, “Please” and “Yes” and “No” and “Harry”. He’s too far gone to remember the rules, a fact that Harry lets slide for now. He’s riding the edge hard and feels the unstoppable force of his orgasm crash through his body, setting his veins on fire. He’s meeting Draco now at every thrust, making everything harder and more intense.
His dragon doesn’t look happy when he turns and moves over to the bar, but Harry couldn’t care less. He likes to watch the enticing swing of his hips, the round arse that’s barely concealed by the tight fit of the dress. Likes to watch Draco squirm as the bartender pins him with a knowing look like he knows all their secrets, especially the one Draco’s barely able to hide.
Draco pulls out the small box and places it on the kitchen table. His husband is on a lookout and will likely be away for the next two days. The Healer in Draco worries about his heavy workload, but Harry wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s always 120% with him.
It’s an ongoing argument between them, those Bad Habits. Harry hates Draco’s, Draco hates his, and so they go in circles again and again.
Malfoy sits on one of the tables next to the door. His feet barely reach the floor and they sway back and forth while he listens to what the girl says. Harry isn’t sure who she is, but her Slytherin jumper gives him a clue. She seems to be younger, a few years at least, but Harry can’t remember ever seeing her around. He can’t understand what they talk about, when she reaches into her bag, a Muggle backpack with a huge Slytherin emblem on it, and pulls out a small package with a green ribbon. She opens it, showing Malfoy the contents and he nods, taking it from her and putting it away inside his robe.
It’s not like he doesn’t want to get over it, but he can’t. All this blood still stains his hands and Draco doesn’t think he can ever wash it away. Harry tries to assure him that he paid his dues, that the way he helps people now makes up for his mistakes. That he was just a child and couldn’t have done anything to prevent what happened.
As a small consolation I will be posting 4 chapters, so I hope your forgive me and/or direct your anger and resentment at the fiance.
Now, years later, Draco can’t imagine not having music around him every day. He carries it with him, made possible by some clever Muggle device, and he even got the hang of downloading new songs from the Internet. He’s particular proud of this accomplishment. The Internet is virulent and dangerous for the imprudent mind, much more so for a person like Draco, who still fights with all the Muggle stuff most days.
Or so he thinks, because he can’t remember more than a few minutes. It’s a shame all of this isn’t even enough to convince him that things have to change, but a terrible argument with Harry is what finally does the trick.
It’s hard to let go of that delicious nipple, but just like the opera they’re nearing their grand finale, and there are still some things Harry wants to do.
Harry doesn’t know how exactly it works, or what happens inside Draco’s mind, but he knows the Veela can break through the tight leash Draco has on it and although he could always reign it back in, he sometimes lets it out to play.
On the desk of his overgrown office is a picture and it might be his most treasured one. To the unsuspecting eye it’s just a picture of their wedding; both grooms smiling brightly into the camera, proudly presenting their rings. The notable part of the picture aren’t the men, though. It’s the huge bouquet that Draco holds. It’s made up of primroses, bellflowers and anemones, quite unusual choices for a wedding, but the message they tell screams brightly in yellow, red and blue: eternal love.
That’s the longest that Harry has ever heard Malfoy talk and he doesn’t know where to start. So he picks up that last notion and begins his own tale.
It’s one of Harry’s secret kinks finally coming true. He’s never wished for a wife, never had the urge to sleep with a woman once he discovered his taste for blokes, but he’s always fantasised about mixing both. There’s something naughty, something salacious about a man with breasts. It’s making him hot and bothered for reasons he can’t explain.
Lately he discovered the healing power music has. It helps keeping his patients calm, and some even show improved stats. The few children on the ward enjoy the audiobooks he brings them. They’re mostly Muggle fairy tales, but the Wizarding world caught up over the years and there are the stories of Beedle the Bard and Marvin Miggs, too.
The path to his mother’s grave is still recognisable. Draco carelessly stomps on the weeds claiming the bare gravel. Winter will kill them all and he won’t be back before Christmas - why should he bother?
His Veela sighs in contentment, the grand gestures of affection pleasing the creature deep inside of him. It’s a secret they haven’t shared with anyone, haven’t felt the need ever since Draco made the first step and confessed his deep-felt love for Harry and revealed they were mates. It’s something so private not even Hermione and Weasel, pardon, Ron, know it. To Draco it’s just another string connecting them, tightening a bond that already withstood war and Death himself.
Harry watches for another minute or two, before he spells his clothes away, hopefully into the hamper in the laundry room, but he can’t be bothered to care right now. He easily overtakes Draco, who whimpers softly every other step, and settles down, legs spread, his cock proudly pointing at his sub. A wave of his hand summons a cushion, making it comfortable for him to sit and he passes the time by wanking, his movements slow and deliberate, to keep the fire burning.
He knows it's because he's the Saviour and the Boy-Who-Lived-Too-Many-Times-To-Count, but also because of his own hubris. Just like Draco, Harry knows he's the best Auror, that most of the old stagers are either dead or finally retired and the new generation of Junior Aurors has grown up in a time when the last war is almost forgotten, only living in the stories of dinosaurs like him.
Harry kneels before him, lifts the knife and runs it almost lovingly over Malfoy’s hollow cheeks, his split lip, his scarred chest. On his way down he accidentally nicks a nipple, causing fresh trickles of blood to run down the otherwise deadly pale chest.
Over the years they got tamer, less reckless. They still try to have an active sex life, but with Draco’s headaches getting worse, they hardly get the chance to explore that particular kink. Still, vanilla sex is better than no sex, and given their explosive history, it’s always wild, sweaty and mind-blowing.
“Seriously Harry, don’t let it be like sixth year. I know you were right, I know he was up to something, something bad and awful, but maybe he isn’t now. Malfoy just looks lonely sometimes, maybe that’s why he’s spending time with you. Think about it.”
Harry gets up from his chair, stepping behind Draco, who hasn’t so much as twitched since he knelt down. He shudders when Harry kneels next to him and grabs his balls, but he doesn’t move otherwise. Harry rolls them in his hand, his grip firm but not painful, not yet anyway. As Draco’s breath hitches, gooseflesh marking his perfect skin, he lets go and unscrews the wing bolts on each side. His dragon flinches when the relatively cold metal meets his bare skin as Harry pulls his balls back behind his legs, forcing him to widen his stance and finally let go of the now useless parcel.
Sometimes they are bigger, like the black dragon hide boots Draco treasures with an insane amount of intensity. He vividly remembers the row they had about wearing boots in the house. Okay, maybe he’d been a bit obsessed with them.
It’s the very thing Harry has tried to avoid since waking up, comparing this reality with his meagre memories because he realises it’s impossible. Impossible to think about his life, of ten or more years, missing when he can’t remember graduating.
I don't have a concrete timeline set for this. It's more of a writing exercise to me, to get a feeling for the characters and to write something that is short but to the point. That said, I imagine this piece happens way in the future, but I think it's vague enough to leave it to the reader's imagination.
They exchange small gifts quite regularly, sometimes just a single flower or the chocolate Harry likes so much (the cheap one from Tesco) or Draco’s favourite food.
There are many memories Harry treasures and likes to relive. They're a part of him, made him who he is, and while some of them are painful, most of them are good.
He remembers all the times they were together, after a good shag or just because they needed to be near each other. It was always Draco’s fingers stroking through his hair, lightly scratching his scalp, more than once making Harry forget the heavy load that had been placed on his shoulders at a too young age. With Draco at his side, he could sleep through most nights, his mind free of horrible memories and the dark things that Voldemort projected.
In the end it isn’t a hard decision. Harry had a painful life, although not all times were bad. But he’s had enough of longing for people that are long gone, for giving and rarely receiving in return.
It was hard to acquire everything, especially since Draco had to deal with certain Muggles. It's ridiculous, the amount of force he had to use to get something the Muggles didn't even want anymore, but he made the mistake to tell them it was for Harry. Draco isn't proud of himself, but his old prejudices surfaced once again while he had to deal with Harry's pig-headed relatives. More than once he caught himself muttering generic crap against the non-magical population. Crap his father forced into his mind, when he was still trying to impress a man that couldn’t possibly be impressed.
They sit for a few minutes, although Draco is seemingly dancing on Harry’s lap, pushing his cock into Harry’s loose fist and grinding his arse back into his very pronounced erection.
Another snap of his fingers and Draco is lifted into the air. Usually, Harry would carry him in his arms, but with the humbler still trapping Draco’s balls, it would be painful. Maybe so much so that Draco would likely come after a few steps, pain slut that he is. Harry won’t risk it.
Over the course of the next hour they talk about everything and nothing: her plans for the summer; Harry’s receipt for strawberry-cheesecake-cream filled eclairs; her preference of erumpent skin-made switches over normal leather because it stings so good; before she hands over the long, narrow, brown parcel with Harry’s order over, wishing him a happy birthday and closes the shop up right after his arse is out in the alley.
There is the tree he and Ginny planted. They all had drawn lots with different “chores” which lead to a furious weekend of renovation works at the Burrow to surprise Arthur and Molly for their 25th wedding anniversary. Ron and Bill had to reroof the Burrow while Hermione and Fleur replastered the outer walls. Draco and George had lucked out and were responsible for the new coat of paint inside while Charlie and Angelina tidied the attic and made a new home for the family ghoul. Finally it was Harry and Ginny’s task to clean up the garden and add a few plants. Hence the tree that has grown magnificently ever since.
The night is quite warm in Sydney, considering the season. They have a quiet dinner on a private yacht while cruising the harbour. The lights are more vivid, brighter than London, and while Harry does enjoy this overture to their evening, he can’t help feeling excited. There is a spark around them that has nothing to do with real magic or the slight buzz from the excellent wine.
Every day, he takes ten minutes for himself. Draco knows this and even helps him find the time, if life gets too stressful.
And he’s different. His feet look huge, his thighs oddly muscled. The black jumper he’s wearing stretches over his broad shoulders. He’s grown up but can’t remember anything past eighth year. The thought isn’t as disturbing as it should be. There’s a small voice in his head insisting he find out what’s wrong, but it’s very faint, and Harry doesn’t listen to the voices in his head on principle. It’s a lesson he’s learned.
“Draco,” Harry says evenly, like nothing happened at all, a poster boy for calmness. He sees the blush spread and intensify, a lovely pink.
It takes some time for Draco to come back enough to realise he needs to answer the question. But he isn’t capable of more than nodding frantically, constricting his own airway by pressing his throat against Harry’s firm hand.
Harry snickers but refuses to rise to the bait. He knows it’s just friendly banter, but the idea to share it with Malfoy is equal parts intriguing and baffling.
He looks Malfoy in the eyes, and suddenly a dam seems to break and his laughter sputters out of him. It breaks the slight tension in Malfoy’s shoulders, something he only discovers now that it’s gone, and they both raise their glasses and chink them together.
At long last he decides to wear his plain white greatcoat and matching boots. It feels like the simple choice took forever and he hurriedly leaves their small cottage and Apparates to Wiltshire.
There are boots on his feet, heavy and sturdy, shimmering in the pale light. Dragonhide, his mind supplies, but he doesn't know how he knows. He's wearing black jeans that fit surprisingly well. There is a hole in the knee, but it doesn't come from prolonged use. Except for the small rip, they are immaculate. His legs feel wrong, look wrong even, but he only understands when he stands up.
It’s a bleak evening, a thunderstorm wrecking the countryside and Harry is still out there, somewhere, arresting a bunch of baby Death Eaters who think it’s cool to slaughter a bunch of Muggle school kids. Draco feels incredibly lonely and his head kills him. The pain potions don’t work as well as they used to, and the thunder rivals the drumming in his skull. Worst of all is the boredom. He’s too tired to cook or do any other chores, and the bright lights of the telly make the headache worse.
“Why do we both have matching rings?” It’s out before he can hold the question back. Of all the insignificant things in this situation, two silver rings should be the most insignificant. He doesn’t expect the light blush that gives Malfoy’s deadly pale skin the illusion of life.
They join Calliope at a small table that is cluttered with legal forms and various kinds of jewelry.
He brings his patients pink and black tulips that help cheer them up, even if most of his young patients don’t know the meaning of it. Sometimes their parents bring him twigs of agrimony. He loves the subtlety of flowers. To most they’re just pretty, but to some they hold whole conversations.
Draco still remembers all the lessons his mother drummed into him. Walking and standing, sitting and dancing, speaking and keeping quiet. Philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, rhetoric and poetry, but also astrology, proper manners, music and so many other things Draco didn’t care for nor ever needed in his life.
They finally finish looking for clothes and Harry chooses a warm jumper to wear since the one he came in with is really pathetic. When he compares it with all the stuff they just bought, it’s obvious even to him. Malfoy is right, somehow. He’s Harry Potter, he’s a public person. Even if he doesn’t like fancy clothes, his hand-me-downs are embarrassing. But he has money now. He actually can afford new clothes every now and then.
As soon as the lady has finished, Harry leans over and whispers: “I want you to get on your knees right now and blow me nice and slow.”
Everything is perfect, and Harry might choke a little on the heavy emotions he feels at this moment. He’s never loved someone as much as Draco. The words sound hollow when he gets them out, never enough to really express what he feels.
He can still feel the touch of his family, has only to look around to see traces of everyone he holds dear in his life.
Harry swirls him around, his hand sure and strong on Draco’s hip, his other possessively holding Draco’s right.
When they finally finish, Draco wipes a tear from the corner of his eye before he swipes his hand over the messed up kitchen, Vanishing the white mess, leaving behind the buggered mashed potatoes and the chicken, now nearly black. Dinner’s ruined and Draco sighs in defeat.
He clears his throat when he stands in front of the table and sees Malfoy flinch. For a second he looks horrified, but he regains his composure soon enough and looks up at Harry.
Their kiss gets heated fast, but they’re still on the ground and the cold slowly seeps into Harry’s anorak, making him shiver. They struggle to get up, barely able to let go now that they have found each other. Malfoy smiles, and it looks almost like the one at Honeydukes, but even more ecstatic. Harry feels his own cheeks hurting pleasantly from doing the same.
“Alright.” Harry picks up the lumpy bundle of bread rolls, holding one out to Malfoy. “Here, are you hungry? I don’t know where I got them from, but they seem to be okay.”
Now I wanted to use this work to introduce it to a longer universe with Veela!Draco and Auror!Harry. If you're still interested, you should read the secret chapter 31. I wanted to include it in this chapter, but the finace was heavily protesting, stating he found that idea stupid and dumb and he was enraged beyond measure I would use such a 'cheap trick' on my readers.
Harry's fucking tall. The floor is ridiculously far away, and he sways slightly as he fights for balance. His arms are massive. They're long and muscular; he feels them bunching under the black jumper he wears. It looks almost obscene how the soft fabric stretches tightly over his biceps. As Harry grabs for the nightstand to keep himself from falling, he sees his hands.
The headaches are slowly killing him, and it’s on a sunny Thursday when Draco realises it can’t go on like this. He’s barely functional. He can’t keep his eyes open, because the lights hurt him fiercely, aside from the fact that he barely sleeps these days. His hands shake and most days he’s just glad he isn’t a Muggle doctor and doesn’t have to give shots on a regular basis or perform surgery. His mood swings from sleep-deprived high-as-a-kite to a deep depression in the span of minutes, leaving his co-workers offended and his patients confused.
He knows that Draco has been taking the potions dutifully, but he could have never imagined the result would look like this. Instead of being flat-chested, his husband now has small breasts. Barely enough to fill half his hand, just the hint of a swell, but they’re there.
Malfoy sighs, deep and a bit desperate, and it tells Harry that these past months must’ve been quite stressful to him. He doesn’t know much about the Ministry of Magic or the works of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, since he can’t remember if he's even finished school, but that little bit of information sounds important and intricate. Mr. Weasley cursed the Unspeakables often enough that he knows the Department of Mysteries seldom gets involved - and when it does, things tend to be serious.
However, a look at the clock on the mantle tells him he’s late and they need to get going if they want to catch their Portkey. The anticipation makes Harry’s stomach flutter as he climbs the stairs to his dressing room, courtesy of Draco’s meticulous renovations of Grimmauld Place. They both have dressing rooms for days like this when they need to keep a secret alive for as long as possible.
Draco looks at the table outside. Everything had been ready. Their best plates, their best silver, the napkin Grandma Black hated because they were made by Muggles but that Draco loves because they are the same colour as Harry’s eyes. The candle holder from Tesco, the only thing they possess that’s totally cheap but means a lot to them both.
His eyes, watching Harry with unconcealed kindness and more love than he’s ever seen before, are otherworldly.
He nearly gets sick again when a door is thrown open and it crashes against a wall. The pain is consuming his thoughts, so Draco is surprised when Harry is suddenly in front of him, talking and gesturing furiously. The words don’t reach his addled brain immediately, but when he finally can make sense of them, he gets sick again.
Most of the time Harry starts with heated gazes, but always when Draco is slightly distracted. His subconscious will see them, but he won’t be tempted to act on the promise of hot sex that Harry gives him. It’s not for him, anyway, but for the creature that always watches its mate.
“You’re welcome, Potter,” comes from behind him, and he slowly turns to see Malfoy with his wand pointing at the now cleared working station. He smiles at Harry, but it’s small and soft and he doesn’t think anyone else except him sees it. Which is fine, because since when does Malfoy smile?
The scenery on the stage has changed. The mountains and trees have vanished, instead, there is a rich bed chamber and a woman sings. It sounds imposing, powerful, but it’s certainly not Harry’s kind of music. He just waits to let the anticipation build and spends his time stealing glances at Draco.
It’s more of a frantic rutting for a while, just the tight drag of Draco’s channel against Harry’s overheated cock, animalistic and simple, yet satisfying. Draco’s breasts bounce around enticingly, and when Harry leans down to get one of them into his mouth, he sees something familiar in the corner of his eyes. He lifts his head, searching - and sure enough, the man from before has his eyes on them again. Suddenly it’s perfect.
Time flies by as he creates a masterpiece, but before long his eyes catch the silver ring again. He forces Malfoy’s hand in the air, the protest weak now that the blood is flowing freely from numerous wounds. Harry looks at the knife and realises it isn’t strong enough to make a clean cut, not through skin and flesh, sinews and bone. He contemplates for a minute, but then decides on keeping it - hacking and slashing will drive the lesson home even better.
Draco’s eyes were closed, his hair a mess, but Harry hadn’t seen anything more beautiful than his boyfriend lying next to him on a rainy Thursday afternoon. He gave Draco a last lingering look before he sank down, settling on Draco’s collarbone, pointy and slightly uncomfortable, but there wasn’t a place Harry would rather be.
Draco is standing in front of him, in his ever ethereal beauty: white faced, slender limbs and silver-blond hair, his skin unblemished, his body whole. Harry doesn’t want to trust his eyes, and tries to remember what Draco had looked like at Malfoy Manor when the Snatchers got hold of him, Ron and Hermione. Different, to say the least. Gaunt and stretched thin, his eyes dead and without any hope, dark bruises colouring his face, his arms and every other patch of skin Harry could see then.
Harry teasingly touches along the sturdy leather rings, relishing in the way they are tight on hot flesh. The slit is weeping the first small drops of precome, and he leans forward to lick them up. From this close, he can smell the arousal, a natural musk that has his mouth salivating and his own erection at attention.
“What, Potter? What’s this?” he demands in his haughty voice, but it’s missing the bite of previous years.
Draco swallows hard, not sure if he should believe what is happening. He’s wanted his nipples pierced for a long time, has talked about it at length, but somehow there was never the right time for it. And he’s old, forty isn’t just a number anymore. Maybe he’s too old for things like pierced nipples, but that doesn’t stop him from wanting. He can just imagine the delicate pain and shudders when he imagines Harry pulling on them. Thinks of a heavy chain connecting them, or weights that pull them down.
Room 4 is the smallest one, more of a broom closet than anything else. It’s so small it doesn’t even have a charmed window. Except for some cupboards and a cot it’s empty.
He remembers dying on the mossy floor of the Forbidden Forest, surrounded by the vilest people that ever lived, in an act of love.
He remembers Narcissa Malfoy urgently whispering in his ear, while he lay on the damp forest floor, just coming back from the death.
After that they got reckless but, fortunately, never caught. Not even when Draco rimmed Harry at the Quidditch cup final between the Cannons and the Harpies that resulted in the first win ever for the Cannons. It was a huge success and whenever Ron talks about that day - Do you remember Harry, do you!? You were there, you lucky bastard! - Harry gets semi-hard in his pants. For years he wonders if he was actually the reason the Harpies lost, since he’s sure their Disillusionment Charm slipped for a second and Ginny stared at him wide eyed before a Bludger cleanly knocked her off her broom. Their best Chaser down the Harpies stood no chance.
