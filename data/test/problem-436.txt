Robards chuckled lightly in genuine amusement. "Yes, I've heard. So... if he's so dangerous and you have such excellent security, then what are you doing HERE? Why do you want MY help?"
I slammed my cock into you and began to pound into you as rapidly as I could. I never slowed my pace, I never softened my thrusts. I simply pounded you until you came screaming behind your gag, untouched and covering the both of us in hot ropes of cum. Your release and your arse clenching around me was the only thing to stop my frantic thrusts. I came deep inside of you, screaming out, "My Dragon!" as I filled you.
And now I have to: "Stop playing around Draco and help me make sure the new art teacher's lesson plans are enriching enough!"
How in Merlin's vast arse did I get so lucky as to have the two best looking blokes on the planet as my husbands? I could look at the two for you for hours and DAYS and still not be full. Sigh...
I don't really know what or IF Phillip has done anything with either of them - he does have his own room, but it's not like we monitor the door all night - but he was very overtly friendly and handsy with both of them and they returned the blatant flirting. At the same time, all of them were dancing and flirting with others, clearly trying to pull.
I had a lovely little stroll through the booths, you know how much I enjoy a good market. But as we got closer to the end, I started seeing items that I wasn't completely sure were completely legal. I didn't really think much of it because perhaps they were selling things that were legal or normal in France or Russia that my delicate British sensibilities were just surprised by. But I just walked past a booth that was DEFINITELY selling things that shouldn't be sold.
When Elena pulled herself away from me to attempt to compose herself (by wiping tears and a little snot on your shirt, good job keeping calm love) Viona, who had been on my hip during the entire sobfest, grabbed my face in her pudgy baby hands and said "Mumda? Mumda?" "Yeah Princess, it's the Mum-Dad. I'm here." She glared at me, said "My!" Just the once this time! And then wanted down to go beg another biscuit from Molly.
Now that I know she's a child, and I know that you know she's a child, I am one hundred percent sure you would want nothing to do with her in any sort of a sexual manner. I may think I'm a disgusting, hideous freak, but I know you would kill yourself before you would touch a child.
You said something about naming our kids ridiculous names and we both keep talking about dragons, so let's name our kids Wyvern, Dragon, Girl Dragon, and Sheng Long - Doesn't that sound brilliant??? People can constantly ask him how long he really is, hahaha!
Well I got just tipsy enough to have the last of my inhibitions drop off, so I finally did what I had wanted to do all night and sat at your feet. Mmmm I love it when I can lay my head in your lap and have you pet my hair. I was surrounded by some of my favorite people in the world, feeling pleasantly fuzzy, and getting to be a good boy at your feet.
And speaking of your businesses, I would like to purchase a few of your laptops for Unity House. I thought one or two being available for the kids use would be nice, but also specifically for Finn so that he can take online muggle courses. They have homeschooling resources online that could help him supplement his education.
"When the day that lies ahead of me, seems impossible to face, when someone else instead of me, always seems to know the way, then I look at you, and the world's alright with me, just one look at you, and I know it's gonna be..... A
"Then we saw your face, now we're Believers, not a trace of doubt in our minds, we're in love, ooo-ooo, and we're believers, we couldn't leave you if we tried."
He caught me as I passed him, pushing me up against the tree and very very lightly placing a hand against my throat. "Does your Harry ever make you submit to him? I noticed that he loves to submit to you, but YOU give me the feeling that as much as you like bossing and dominating him, you'd actually love submitting."
Ok, there's a chance I'm overreacting. I did see them just a little over two days ago. But if Gabe is having developments what's to say Dyl or Morgana haven't?
And that led to buying him a few outfits he could wear when he wanted to be a girl. Nothing too, erm, sexy, I suppose. He wasn't trying to look like a prostitute, but rather a normal 16 year old girl. That said, he positively ADORED buying bras and knickers, which I can't exactly blame him for. After all, we both bought delightful knickers to wear under our robes when we got married, and for the most part, knickers just feel better against delicate bits than most male underwear.
Rather than explain, I pulled out my magimobile and called the police. My Japanese probably wasn't the best in my disorientation, but I managed to get across: "I need to report YEARS worth of dead bodies buried in the warehouse I recently bought."
But besides that one golden moment, I have basically climbed out of bed and hit the ground running every morning. Haven't even stopped to eat, just munched on whatever food Muffy has been forcing on me a few times per day. I've pretty much only stopped in time to crash into bed at night and I'm asleep before my head hits the pillow.
Not ONLY does my bump look bigger than the Manor, but it's ALSO lumpy and bumpy! It's frankly ugly and I dislike it. I shudder when I think about how much BIGGER it's going to get!!! But that said, even though my magic is holding steady - on the low side of normal, but better than my previous pregnancies. Aside from Zwei - he's basically been my star pregnancy, a singleton with no real problems.
Let me start with movie night. We all went to Unity House and watched Coco, which was a stunning movie about a boy who wanted to be like his grandfather and play the guitar. There were some interesting twists - such as a trip to the land of the dead. I loved it, but I daresay that Atreyu loved it even more. He now DEFINITELY wants that flying spirit jaguar thing!
And, uh, speaking of Kisa â€¦. it's been three or four days, has anyone heard from her or Blaise? I know they're safe, and I know what they're doing so I certainly don't want details, but how long do you think they're going to be missing? I'd like to see them and talk to them and tease Blaise incessantly for finally succumbing to the Veela thing.
That might be a little bit of good news, actually. Since you're no longer vomiting, you CAN eat, it's just not very fun to do because it triggers extra bouts of diarrhea. That said, you do need to eat, and obviously, you're still taking nutrition potions and other magic restoration/boosting potions. I think there's even one potion designed to help protect your body from the damage the others might potentially cause (such as diarrhea, which can easily dehydrate you) AND a potion to attempt to boost your normally very high but currently very low healing ability.
You and Zaire are taking ages to say goodbye to everyone before we return home, so I'm going to use the time to email you.
After that, Eris looked at her hands in her lap and said: "Er.... well, I don't actually remember what I did. I don't remember anything other than drinking - a LOT - and dancing and giggling almost constantly because EVERYTHING seemed hilarious. Ori says I was hot and heavy with a bloke, and to be honest, I probably was, because there was a couple of gorgeous blokes I wanted to snog, I just don't remember any of it. Thus, I have no idea if I remembered to cast the spells."
But you seemed to take me saying what you did was not okay and have somehow turned it into "Harry is going to force me to quit my job which is the thing I need most in this world to be fulfilled."
Erm... how was I supposed to do that? As it turned out, the door from the lounge to the stage was pretty direct. So I made my way onto the stage, feeling a little embarrassed only because I'd basically been told to stay where I was, and then was caught off guard by being asked to join you after all.
When I picture my future children - and I do want more than one. I hated being an only child because it was lonely until I went to Hogwarts. Anyway, when I picture them, they have... well, pale skin, but not quite as pale. Hopefully a bit more golden and healthy looking. I want some of them to have my white blond hair, and some of them to have their father's black hair. I'd like for them to have my height, but then again, a tiny girl who's tough as nails even though she looks delicate and fragile with my hair and his green eyes - ah!
And, more importantly, I need to be there. I used to think my dream of opening even a single orphanage might never happen. I stressed and panicked. I doubted myself. I kept thinking of all the worst case scenarios. I think I need the reminder of what can be accomplished even when you think the odds are stacked against you.
Love, I honestly can't thank you enough for my amazing birthday present! I knew you were spending today with Akihito so I was prepared to miss you, but I haven't had a moment to do so.
It seems our lives have come full circle. Years ago when we first started our family, I decided to start the tradition of matching Christmas pajamas. For the first few years, even Elena as the oldest, played along or even liked my ridiculous pajama decisions. Snowflakes and penguins, jolly Father Christmas faces, cats with silly hats, polar bears, full footy pajamas that made the wearer look like an elf. The obnoxious pajamas were a hit. Then as the children got a bit older, they started putting their feet down about how silly they looked.
So, after that man came into our home while you were mentally unwell and thrust that item on you which forced a vision, I went to the Ministry and had a lengthy discussion with him.
In any case, since I didn't know these drugs were in my drink (the first one dissolves on it's own and the second had to be crushed into powder before being added to the tea), I downed it trustingly. After all, it was an excellent quality tea and among my favorite blends.
Harry and Oliver are trying to be supportive, and Draco is already finding that the job might be a bit more than he wants.
I could have just fallen asleep to the feeling of complete love and safety. But as much as I enjoyed our time alone together, we didn't need to leave our husband home alone just so we could sleep on a blanket outside. Unless of course he had chosen to have a boys' night, get utterly pissed (which you obviously can't exactly do right now Ollie-Love), play with fire, and promise middle naming rights to an aforementioned friend.
I paused to look around and gauge reactions. The younger kids looked rather repulsed. The older kids looked interested but trying to hide it, and our own Siri and Zwei looked like they would rather Elena or somebody was up here instead of me.
No, RON is my friend, and Hermioneâ€™s boyfriend, heâ€™s actually YOUR weasel seeing as youâ€™re the only one who ever calls him that. You know heâ€™s growing on you! Admit it! And even if you canâ€™t admit liking Ron, you know you legitimately and openly love Hermione!
Frowning, Oliver conjured a cushion so that he could sit next to me. "Wait, if Harry knows this about you, then why did he get so mad when you got drunk and hinted that you loved Jules. Thinking back on it, I personally felt uncomfortable with the idea. Actually, I sort of couldn't stop myself from remembering the way you practically fondled Mahafsoun's hair and purred like a cat. You had that same look of bliss on your face as when you were drunkenly playing with Lumi, muttering things like: 'I love you Lumi, just like I love my Harry and my Oliver, my kids and my not kids like Mahafsoun and Jules and Wojtek and Amala and her babies.' I mean I was able to shrug it off because you were clearly drunk and rambling, but Harry got a very annoyed look on his face and had to excuse himself to the loo for a few minutes, so I am pretty sure he was angry."
Once Bletchley wrapped his head around the fact that Robards was genuinely dead (the body isn't glamoured, transfigured, or polyjuiced into him), and that they had no real leads to work with yet, he had no choice but to call me in as a suspect until I could be cleared.
I even danced with Ron, although that is probably less shocking now that I know what he's gotten up to in his free time with Blaise! Oh, and how are you going to tease me with that almost gossip and then just end your email?!? Unacceptable!
Side note, we had a fire pit added just off to the side of the start of the track so that they can step out of the pit and be exactly where I need them to be.
Ron and Hermione got up to leave. "So... if we're torturing Blaise tonight, I wonder what we should start with?" Ron asked.
Live in my house, I'll be your shelter, just pay me back with one thousand kisses, be my lover and I'll cover you, yeah!
In any case, I found a private spot and Apparated back to you. Then I gave you our adorable daughter, kissed you, told you the base details of what the Healer had done for her, and then told you that I needed a quick mini break - and I did, but mostly, I wanted to write all of this down so that you'd have a chance to read it and think it over before we start fighting about me acting like an Auror again.
So today, we were having a lovely and rather lazy day. All our kids were busy doing their own things - our younger ones happily entertaining Tatyana, Misha, and Tristan. Meaning that they were all out in the stables giving the equines so much love and attention that one or two of the horses might find themselves moving to Russia soon, haha.
"Oi, mutt, hop up onto the bed," I commanded, pointing firmly to leave no doubt that I expected to be obeyed.
Or, you know what? Never mind, maroon sounds wonderful. We could add some of your favorite golden accents! It will be quite the Gryffindor room!
Speaking of, having you home and in my arms for nearly an hour earlier today (before you got an urgent firecall saying that Carlito had worked himself into quite a state without you), was the best hour of the entire week. Fear not, the kids all remember you. They clearly miss you - as evidenced by their need to cling to you when they do manage to see you at Unity House - but they aren't dying because you are taking care of someone else who needs you. In fact, my parents and I took all the children in this house to Unity Park a couple of times this week, simply to wear them out.
It's so surreal that two years ago at this time we weren't even really on speaking terms, and you had zero siblings that you knew about. Last year, we just had Viona that we knew of, along with our two on the way, you only had the one little sister at that point. And this year we have FIVE children (with NONE on the way!), and you have four siblings. What will our future years look like?
Anyway, after ending my conversation with them (Ron seemed to be the only one not running around like a chicken with his head cut off), I was just entering the ballroom because we were planning to do an in costume dance practice, when Kisa came running in after me, launching herself at me so that she wrapped her arms and legs around me and knocked me to the floor.
"Lovely to meet you both, but I'm afraid you all will have to excuse me soon. As much as I am delighted to get a chance to hug you, Orion - Happy birthday by the way - I have to leave soon for France. Whenever your sister shows up ready to go."
I'm pretty sure we'd all asked our elves to serve us popcorn by that point and were silently watching in awe. I think you may have attempted to cast silencing spells on our youngest ones' ears, but since Leah was habitually signing everything she said, they all understood it anyway. Tiger was doing his best to cover BOTH of his youngest kids' ears, and curl them into him so that they couldn't read the signs, but I saw them both watching from under his arms anyway.
If OLIVER doesn't want you to do this mission, that's up to him. Just like all of the ACTUAL AURORS have given their significant others veto rights (see it's not just me), Bletchley should be understanding, and YOU should be understanding, if YOUR husbands don't want you to do this. Our feelings are valid and while I know you might like it to be otherwise, it's not exactly insane for someone to not want their husband shagging other people undercover.
Well, Friday night was a success, and not just for you and your quidditch prowess. When I came into the office this morning after the prospective parents had the weekend to think it over, I had thirteen official requests for adoption. We may get another one or two trickle in in the next few days. But as of right now I am helping thirteen children pack and prepare to head to their new homes.
She doesn't know this, but I already plan to buy her a farm nearby if she chooses that option. I want her within biking distance because she actually has responded to the horses here and would probably love to be able to come visit them whenever she wanted. But more importantly, I just want her nearby so that she DOESN'T literally become a hermit.
I just can't help but think it's hilarious that she's so particular about being the center of attention. She's in a massive family! She is one of twenty-four kids. She has just turned two years old and she already has eleven nieces and nephews with another on the way.
I've already been for a run this morning. It's so funny, I prefer to run outdoors. Even in the dead of winter I would rather just cast warming charm after warming charm than run indoors on a small circular track or, Merlin forbid, a treadmill. I'm glad those monstrosities exist for those who want to utilize them, but give me the great wide open any day! But the funny part is that back in the UK, even when we're at hotels or areas with more people, I rarely run into other people out on their runs. I know they do, I'm not going to pretend I'm the only runner in the entire place, I just think the places I run at home tend to be free of other runners.
Harry kissed him. "It's like when Draco asked me to do this to him, I wanted to because it was with HIM - no matter what his body was like at the time. So, it's an experience I can have with a man I love, and it's not something I want to do everyday, so..." he shrugged, probably feeling like he'd never be able to explain it.
As you know, I took River with me to Unity House today, he's going to have a nice long session with Yesenia. Hopefully she will have some insight as to how to transition him seamlessly into our family and how to help him grieve and remember his mum. She didn't leave River any letters did she? I hope we end up being a good family for him. Can I tell you something? I am already helplessly in love with him. I want to keep him forever! It's like, he walked into our home and my heart went "yep, that's the one, this one's ours."
Don't worry, we didn't burst in and pull you out when we first saw where you had gone, but as soon as I've finished writing and sending this we are coming to drag you off.
"Remember, you can't make a sound," I warned you as you knelt in front of where I was sitting. I opened your trousers and proceeded to give you a thorough milking. I LOVE the fact that you couldn't quite hold back all your whimpers and gasps. That said, I don't think anyone heard us.
After our night, I should be dead to the world! First, we watched Miles - the Divine Ms. M - positively KILL IT during his performance. To be honest, just watching him made me want to get up and sing and dance too. So then he invited me up on stage. I was so bloody shocked that I thought I was dreaming!
The Viper had a bit of a hard time surfing, he did eventually manage to ride a few waves, but he definitely didn't take to it as well as his kids did. All four of them managed to get to standing well before he did, surpassing Sirius' surfing within an hour or so and they'd never tried it before. I think his Bel is almost as competitive as Viona and Eris. He knew he couldn't compete with our little surfers who've been doing it most of their life, but he was certainly taunting his siblings with catching on the quickest.
But that sweet moment of camaraderie led to the entire night talking about each child's arrival into our lives.
We are exactly eight days away from the wedding, heading into the last weekend before the big day. Mahafsoun is finally back in town, and tempers and anxieties are flaring all over the place. You won't judge me if I hide in our rooms for a while right? I love wedding planning, but all the different conflicting personalities are putting me on edge.
I love him Draco. It's not the same as my love for you, it's not taking away my love for you, but it's there and it's real. I can wait until you're ready to say it as well, I don't want our new relationship to be off balance or to be a contest, but I've come to terms with my own feelings.
Jaz usually joins us for birthday breakfast prep, but not always. Sometimes she just wants to sleep in. Yesterday though, she wanted to help. And the four littles were running in and out of the kitchen; pretending to help a bit, while mostly being loud and stealing fruit.
Alright, strangely, I wasn't that teary eyed. MAYBE I'm finally getting a handle on this PPD monster after all, because I felt mostly parental pride with a hint of wistfulness and a dash or two of nostalgia. I was more happy than sad to see our Baby Viona get on that train. I was EXTREMELY happy to see that bloody ferret of hers get on the train!
While I was talking to Hannah, I broke down and admitted that the reason *I* was interested in the case is because I had a stupid dream that was eerily similar to the most recent victim. She asked me to tell her more about my dream, and when I told her that I was the most recent victim, that I felt not just jealous, but desperately eager to be made perfect for the man I wanted, well...
"He bites her fingers, making her smack him. Her eyes are utterly bloodshot, and I wonder if those minutes of quiet before the storm involve her taking something that drove her to this state. He tries to get away again, but she grabs him and none too gently brings him to the bathtub, which has already been filled with water. For all I know, it could be left over from his last bath - or hers, whenever that might've been.
P.S. Apparently we were just competitive enough today that Padfoot and Viper BOTH want to murder us rather violently for showing off, hahaha! At least their surfing instructor for the day was rather beautiful to look at and she kept flirting with all of us (even the kids in a somehow NOT inappropriate way), so they definitely had something nice and inspiring to look at while they suffered, haha.
But I was in too deep, still too in love, still wanting to be a family and raise our children together. So I allowed the controlling behavior to continue. Except it wasn't him. I mean, it WAS him, but it wasn't his fault. You see, a year ago, we went to St. Mungo's for his annual checkup ... yes I went along, I never went anywhere without him by that point ... and his inability to remember his own medical history was a red flag to his healer. Edmond was diagnosed with an aggressive strain of magic-resistant dementia.
So, your last two emails have been sort of weird, and when I try to figure out why, I think I'm overanalyzing them because... hmm...
Eventually you turned back and joined the dinner, but you were certainly cold to me for the rest of the night. Do you think it was maybe easier to focus on being annoyed with me so you weren't worried about tomorrow?
I decided to let the matter drop, although I gave him a look that let him know that I WOULD be looking into it, and stood up to leave. "I'm only agreeing to go home - after I add a last little bit to my report - because I know that Harry and Oliver will be home soon, and if I'm not there to help them unpack, it'll be MY arse in trouble. Please call me if ANYTHING develops."
Happy Anniversary Draco Lucius Malfoy. To the first of so many more to come. To the family we grew this last year. To any more family we may meet in the future. I love you with all of my heart. Everything I promised you a year ago, I still promise you. You are my life and my future.
Robards nearly blushed and rubbed the back of his neck. "Erm, see, whenever you come babble at me about something you want to use during your raids, all I care about is if it'll work and make our jobs easier. I don't actually listen to what you're saying, so, I've never talked about any of it to Roche."
However, I understand that you're coming from this as someone who hasn't taken them. I understand your feelings because I obviously was worried about something similar since I took so long to start them. I felt as though I needed to exhaust every avenue before I started this regimen. Even being someone who's on potions, who's been in therapy for years, I still have those internalized stigmas against mental health therapies. So I promise, as much as I had an initial feeling of hurt, I really am not holding your feelings about the potions against you.
Did you know that apparently, there are accounts of men (probably desperate to keep their children alive) who have actually breastfed their children simply by letting them latch on and suck until their own bodies understood what was being asked for and produced the hormone, and thus, milk. Along the same lines, virgin girls who've reached puberty and young women (virgin or not) who have never been pregnant can actually produce milk the same way if necessary. I did not know this, and folklore has it that there are herbs and things to help with this.
During Sleeping Beauty, there was this wonderful little song that Aurora was dancing to, and she was surprised by the Prince. I sort of saw that coming with all the foreshadowing they were doing, so I insisted that you get up and dance with me to: "I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream. I know you, that look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam. And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem, but if I know you, I know what you'll do, you'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream.
In less than one entire day of being here, we managed to have a nice lie about in the sun, we managed to play a rousing game of beach volleyball with our non infant kids, we managed to do a couple of hours of moonlight swimming, AND we managed to shag under the water amongst the gorgeous coral.
We also have to pick a date for, and plan, River's welcome party. We've done naming ceremonies for the babies, we did a welcoming ceremony for Elena's welcome into the Malfoy family and introduction to the ancestors, but River already has a name and the ancestral magic knew he was a Malfoy before we knew he existed. So all we really have to plan is a party where we invite our friends and family to officially meet him and celebrate his coming into the family. Although I'd really like to do a small ceremony, maybe with just the six of us, to welcome him into the Potter family as well. Maybe right before his party? If he wants that of course.
It was definitely a long day but seeing all those children being safe and sound was definitely worth it. I felt satisfied and exhausted, I couldn't wait to come home to you. After dinner was all cleaned up and the Kids were settling in for the evening, I was getting myself, Lily, Seph, and Cael ready to head home when River showed up unexpectedly.
Taking a deep breath, I nodded in understanding. "Alright. Let's do this together. Try to calm down. Reign your magic in. Do this with FULL intent and not pure rage."
"They're Gryffindors," Tiger stated in confusion. "WHY would they suddenly change their House affiliation to argue AGAINST something brave and adventurous?"
I'm really pleased that me accidentally waking you when I decided I needed a snuggle was met with you just being happy to see me. As well as a quickie. You'd think after weeks of not much sex (well, at least less than WE are used to) we would have wanted to take our time and really draw it out. Nope, we were both frantic and tore at each other like we were starving.
We are currently on our flight, which gives me plenty of time to recap my last two days. As I was waking up on my birthday, I could feel you trying to leave our bed, and I didn't care what time it was, this was NOT ON! So I grabbed you and yanked you back over to me so that I could kiss and have my very wicked way with you.
That led to me wandering (after taking at least a half an hour trying to find my way OUT of the closet) along the massive wall jam packed full of pictures. Sure enough, there were some from our wedding day and Oliver was wearing the outfit I'd found. Wow! We all looked amazing that day!
I kissed him on the cheek rather than say that I could think of a few things he could do - such as murder innocent people - that would push me over my limit. Because there's NO NEED to even mention that as he's such a good boy that he'd never even think it.
"Looks like my Charlie likes the idea as well. Shall we let them have their release and then put on a bit of a show for them?"
Anyway, with you getting serious about training for a marathon, and me having absolutely no desire to do anything today without you, I thought: "What the hell, couldn't hurt to try to keep up - or if that's too much for me, at least jog at a slower pace while you run circles around me."
Bloody Hell! In two months we're going to have a newborn, and then a second newborn only a few weeks later! We've done nothing to prepare! We have to .... Merlin! I don't even know what we have to do! We need nappies and clothes and blankets and ... and .... I don't even know what we need!
Sighing morosely, I closed my eyes and let my mind drift some more. Surprisingly, a room formed in my mind, I softly murmured a description of it - still half certain that I was just making it all up. I told Hannah that I saw a large and sunny room. It was full of toys. I probably rather pointlessly described some of the toys, but there really were all sorts - stuffed animals, porcelain dolls, toy soldiers, and those infernal Legos that the boys insist we step on every time we go into their rooms. There was far more than that, but I didn't think it was a truly important detail.
I can't imagine what kind of scam it could be, but I didn't want to just let her take me to you in case this was like a human trafficking thing or a scam to mug me for the rest of my money, it seemed an awfully elaborate ruse, but I feel as though I am a weird combination of a naÃ¯ve yet jaded man. So I thought I could write you a letter and have her get it to you.
You had made your appointment about the daycare for this upcoming Tuesday, instead of for tomorrow? today? Monday. I assume so that we could celebrate your birthday. We have two tiny babies, a toddler, and a big kid. We have been dealing with Antonio's legal battles, as well as his healing process. We just had our anniversary. With how busy we've been, I think you assumed I had forgotten your birthday.
I'm picturing a large home with a master suite on each end, one side for Rodrigo and Elena, the other side for Ethan and Rose. A huge kitchen, dining room, and living area in the middle of the house. This would be for shared meals, shared time together with all the children and adults together, a way to make the children feel part of a whole family instead of fragmented pieces or two families.
Look, I know that sex does not have to have anything to do with love or affection. I know the difference between physical satisfaction and true intimacy. I happen to prefer all of my sexual encounters to be about love. Even if the connection to that love is that my husband is watching me shag a stranger. For ME it's still about loving my husband. I personally only ever want to shag when there is love involved.
At any rate, Hermione is glaring at me because we're due to meet with the French and Russian Ministers in about 10 minutes, so I have to sign off and go flirt my arse off. Love you both beyond my ability to express!
How did your chat with Ethan go? You know, I should probably go ask him if he has any interesting new instruments. It's also about that time of year when I should really make sure that his parents are ordering a few extra instruments every shipment and putting them aside for me so that I can give them out to needy children for Christmas.
If today was a typical day as Head Auror, I'm going to have to have Muffy bring a few things from our closet to have on hand as necessary. So my morning was rather productive in that I think I finally got through all the files Robards had classified as active. Most of them were actually reclassified as cold cases that he just refused to stop working.
And do you know, after ALL of that, Elena and Miles both fell in love with the LAST applicant. At that point, I might well have chosen her even if she was illiterate and had no idea what a potion was. That said, she's actually brilliant. She spent her life homeschooling her five sons and three daughters - the right way, as opposed to all the kids we've had to remove from their homes for neglect and the like with homeschooling used as a cover for bad parenting. Now that her youngest child is all grown up and living on her own, Saoirse (pronounced seer-sha) is looking forward to a bit of adventure.
I decided this called for a bit of a divide and conquer tactic. To that end, I tied Harry to a chair - rather than suspend him from the ceiling as he normally prefers - with a gag in his mouth. This gave me the opportunity to focus on Oliver for a while. I started by tying him up as well so that I could drape him over your lap, Harry, and spank him. I started relatively gently and worked into deeper impacts. That said, I kept in mind that he doesn't like spanking as much as you do, and so, I needed to balance on the edge of hard enough to give him a thrill and keep his interest, but not so hard as to turn him off.
Hey Hey Hey now, those are MY spankings! I earned them fair and square! I was only saying that I needed something besides the beautiful but hard wooden chair that was in my office.Â  I just added a beautiful navy velvet cushion to the seat of the chair and now my bum feels lovely.
Good morning! Hopefully you and the babies didn't miss me overly much last night since I wasn't able to come to bed. It's actually about 6:00 A.M. and I am thinking about climbing into bed with you now. You won't mind if I spend the day sleeping and wake up just in time for dinner right?
I sighed a bit petulantly but didn't say anything, because if they DON'T behave, I'll lock them each in a different pocket dimension, just see if I don't!
I assume you both saw my opening salutation of this email, well Draco I don't want to hurt your feelings, you are my husband. But, while husband and fiance are your current technical titles, I think it's not exactly realistic. We are all three getting married. To each other. Binding ourselves into this beautiful triad. It will be the beginning of a new marriage for all of us. I've made such a big deal about how this isn't just Oliver joining our existing marriage, it's the beginning of our triad, and then I've continued to say husband and fiancÃ©.
I tried to respond, really I did, although the only thing that came out was a string of "Um" and "Erm" and a few "But I" attempts at sentences in there.
I am the worst Daddy ever, I hate that he's guarded, I hate that his past made him so distrustful, but I certainly enjoyed the silver lining which had him in my lap the entire time we were at Healer Rowe's. I love him so much, and I can't wait until he is open and knows how much I love him. Tomorrow morning I am actually going to bring him to the kitchens with me to make Lainie's birthday breakfast.
Before I go on and on about not only our baby girl's birthday party, but the emotional upheaval from our announcement, I have something very important but unrelated to say. Holy hell Malfoy, your new tattoos are so hot. I want to bite every inch of you. Neil is truly an artist, to heck with bringing anyone else, let's drag him to Africa and force him to be our personal tattoo-ist â€¦ tattoo-er? He managed to make them just so perfectly fit with Lainie's and River's personalities, but keep true to the original design and make it a cohesive little family of dragons.
This means that Miles has time in the mornings to just wander around and do as he likes, which unsurprisingly includes extra sleep now that he's growing a new human. It also means that he has the music room all to himself while the Unity Littles are usually out playing in the Park. And that's where I found him...
So far, I think the Queens performing will be you and I, Miles, Blaise, Ron, the Viper, Sirius, Lucius, Charlie, and Theo. The Kings will be Luna, Pansy, and Kisa! I had no idea Kisa was going to perform, but it does make sense, she just screams confidence!
I have to admit that I was a bit puzzled myself, reflexively muttering: "Goddamnit Harry," before leading my students to the classroom.
"Oh, right. In that case, hand me the parchment you have spelled to be your interactive diary, and by that I mean schedule, not the one you keep all your secrets in."
Since I lost the chance to tell you all about what you missed at the appointment, I suppose this is the best place to do it. Rowe and I started seriously debating the safety and timing of when to transplant one of the little monsters. She still sticks to, unless there is some sort of emergent issue, she wants to wait until Morgana is twenty-eight weeks to move her. Well, she would only move a twenty-eight week womb regardless of who we move, it's just that Morgana will obviously get there first.
The boys and their family make it to Africa and visit Unity House. Meanwhile, Sirius needs to wear a bell.
Well after we got the kids off to bed, your parents headed off to their suite to "let you young people have some time to yourselves." Which is when Pansy wanted all the details of last weekend. What is it about me that I was able to do all of those things, but discussing them has me blushing like a 14 year old at the Yule Ball trying to figure out why he's angry at Pansy!
And you know if you tried giving Wojtek to River that Shtara might straight up assault you. She's sassy and dramatic, spirited and ridiculously talented. But she doesn't suffer fools and only a fool would try to remove that bear from Shtara. I can't be your bodyguard and follow you around all day to make sure our thirteen year old doesn't jump you from the shadows. I can't be everywhere at once!
You shook your head. "No. Our goal is to give Jaz the best relationship she can have with her family."
I think I have discovered the weirdest and most unique form of torture. See, I've been laying out in the sun (partial shade) on my enormous plush cushion, in an area where there's a lot of ants. There's at least one anthill right in front of me, but I think there's another somewhere nearby because I'm seeing two distinct types of ants wandering around doing their thing.
I didn't actually mean we should use our children as their siblings' Godparents. I was more explaining why it wasn't weird to ask Mahafsoun when we've not ever asked our children. And I realize we really have used up a LOT of our options. And even doubling them in some places. We do still have a few unutilized options.
"Blimey this is a posh towel!" Girly exclaimed as she held out the towel Muffy had included with my things.
"Eeek! Harry Potter!" The timid young man squeaked when he spotted you, clearly not expecting someone so famous to just casually walk up to a group he was part of.
But here's the deal, I love that your libido is coming back. I really do. But I do not want you to ever apologize for taking things slowly or listening to your body when it's telling you it's tired. I can live without sex for a while, what I can't do is live without you. You have not been neglecting my needs, my need is for you to be healthy. Got it?!? Although if you're quite sure it's your libido talking and not some sense of guilt, I will gladly take anything you want to give me!
The reason animals are easier is that they have to trust you for you to get into their minds at all, so they teach patience and being calm. Then, once you do get into their minds, the way they think is so different that it's very jarring - often startling the practitioner right back out of their mind. But once you get used to that jarring feeling, their minds are very simple and easy to sort through. Again, maintaining calmness and trust. So, the practice is very good on many levels. The most important of which is learning to accept how jarring and disorienting it is to actually be in someone else's mind. It can often feel like you are stumbling around drunk in the dark. But once you KNOW how it feels and can work with the feeling, you can just do it. Or at least I can. I even sort of unconsciously practice it whenever I'm with my birds. I don't truly intend to, it's just sort of habit and a good way to see how they are doing. Probably why I didn't forget the skill.
Yesenia stopped with a sigh and I waited for her to gather her thoughts. "So... Mystery solved, I think. But I have no idea what the legal ramifications of this are. I mean, she wasn't raped and it's normal for children her age to 'play house' or 'play doctor' - that said, depending on how old this Peter is, he could be charged with Statutory Rape or molestation of a very young minor. I... I just hope that the Ministry does what is best for everyone involved."
Speaking of clothes, I must confess that I'm actually a little bit confused. You said that you agree with me about teaching *our* kids healthy and positive messages about nudity and the human body, but then you freaked out when my family joined us in the hotspring (I do understand that one as you weren't expecting it and were caught off guard) - but *then* you freaked out that the Unity kids were naked and climbing trees. Why freak out? Why not simply cast a bunch of cushioning charms under the tree should they happen to fall, and let them go wild? Their caregivers were more than likely standing ready to catch them if necessary and heal any minor scratches or cuts they might get from the tree. And as much as I love that you had them play music instead, it actually is so good for them to play in trees. Or is the problem simply that you forgot you're a wizard again and that you could cast cushioning charms to protect them from falls? The ironic thing is that once a child develops the skills necessary to *make it* to the branches of the tree, they really are unlikely to fall unless something startles them or off balances them (such as another child pushing them), so they would have been perfectly safe.
Currently, Ethan and Rose have their own house, Rodrigo has a flat, and Elena pops back and forth between their places, the Manor, and her school (where she has a flat), but if they all move here, such an arrangement seems excessive and unnecessary, so we'll see if they decide they're all ready to live together.
He's being a tease Draco! As I write to you, he's rubbing his palm over my pants, stroking my cock through the soft fabric. But what happens when I try to pull my pants down to give him better access? The monster just laughs and pulls his hand away. It's torturous! He's touching me, not enough to get me off, but just enough to make me desperate and whiney. I mean, when was the last time you heard me this whiney?
Oh, also speaking of things I nearly forgot. Guess who came to ask me for a fertility potion today... Yep, Miles. Now, before you go freaking out about how he JUST got a new job, and obviously, is in a very visual career in which hiding a pregnancy would be difficult, let me just tell you that the potion is actually for COLM.
We dealt with you Draco up on Mount Everest, which is very cool and I can't wait to see the pictures you took with the MMM you brought with. Aren't you glad you consistently keep one in your watch carry-all? Can you imagine only having those views in your memories and not having a physical copy?
That's not the important part, the important part was what Oliver said: "That's the door you used to bring me into your mind, and I suppose that doing so must have created the link permanently, because it's still here. What do you say we try it?"
As for now, I'm letting the wife fuss and cluck over me, making me chicken noodle soup and hot chocolate with chili pepper of all things.
"Oh?" I challenged with a huge smirk. "Care to make a wager on that? We could spend the next few hours comparing vaults, and if it turns out that mine is bigger than yours, I say you give each of my kids 5000 Galleons - and another 5000 to each of our Unity Houses!"
I shook my head. "No, I'm dead certain that your father is going to murder me for the Opium, no need for him to resurrect me and murder me all over again for a drug I don't even like the sound of."
So, I've sent an owl to grandmama that we're going to visit her next weekend as I really enjoy living and do not want her to have any reason to make my life miserable. We'll Portkey to Kamchatka on Friday morning, but the time difference is actually bigger than going to Japan. So, if we leave here at 9 AM, we'll arrive there at 9 PM. This will be just in time for a late dinner, but then we'll need to use the sleeping potion trick so that we can sleep at night there and get up at a reasonable time in the morning.
Anyway, where I was going with this is that Aya and Angella were working on us when River popped in, noticed that Aya was giving a bit of a lesson to Angella, and asked if he could apprentice with her too. So, strangely enough, our oldest son got his hands on us and massaged us too. He's not half bad, considering that it was his first time giving a massage. I'm certain being worked on as often as I was in the mood to call Aya over ever since the day he first arrived probably helped him to know how it was supposed to feel.
Which there was, so, if you should happen to hear about a bit of Slander in the Paper against Unity House, it has already been taken care of, and even better, neither of us had to throw money or lawyers at the problem to make it go away.
I was torn, a spanking sounded delightful. I can't remember the last time I turned down a spanking, or any impact play honestly. I think I stuttered a bit in confusion because your eyes softened and realized something wasn't adding up as usual.
Elena was already holding the incense for her part. She held it to one of the candles to light it, then once it was on fire, blew it out to let the smoke float away in the light breeze. She then set the stick in the holder between the candles. "Dear Malfoy and Potter Ancestors - and all the others who love them and have come here today. Thank you for welcoming me into your family and watching over me. I promise to do my best to make you all proud." With her hands together prayerfully, she bowed towards the candles and incense.
Anyway, I'll finish up here, rock them to sleep, and join the rest of you for whatever is on the schedule for tonight.
Of course we can put off creating my "Epcot" for after the Holidays. It's something I'd like to do, but there's no timeline necessary. We can wait until May for all I care, when we're both swollen and cranky and the only people who will be willing to spend time with us are those we're paying to be there!
"TouchÃ©," I murmured, letting him go. "You managed to land a hit on me. That earns you a reward; see me after class to claim it."
Since you are both teaching at the moment, I cannot be certain, but you may have actually known or suspected that I'd wake up fully me today. See...
During your pregnancy, your magic has been funneling into the baby at an expected rate, making your overall level decline at about three percent a month. This means that even if you are pregnant longer than the usual 40 weeks, you'll still have about 2/3rds of your magic left and probably won't even notice a drop in the quality of it or ability to use it. Also, your 2/3rds is roughly the same amount of magic that *most* average wizards have. So. Nothing to worry about.
Did you get a chance to stop in at the Ministry and look over the hand to hand combat training facilities? Is this something you're seriously contemplating? I have to admit it seems to have come out of nowhere. Years ago when you were deciding what direction to take your career, I had mentioned teaching and specifically training Aurors and you didn't seem all that interested. Preferring to take the training yourself and then hand pick the raids that interested you.
The 'current' family members - those deceased recently enough that their child or spouse is still alive - such as my grandfather Black - do not have their candles in that room. My mother actually has the candle for her father in her private sitting room. And now I feel like I'm rambling, sorry.
Okay, so for those of you who are curious, as it was explained by my hubby, the Human Centipede is a (I'm assuming) CGI thing in which humans are surgically attached so that they form a centipede. That's a bit horrifying on it's own, but these humans are attached mouth to anus so that whatever goes into the first human in line eventually comes out the last one in line.
It's early. It's early even for me. Well, it's not so early for me to have been awake, but seeing as I've already gotten ready for the day and am ready to leave at my usual wake up time, it's early. You would probably just call this time "yesterday"!
Exhausted? Exhausted? Iâ€™ll show you exhausted!! Yeah right after Iâ€™m done writing this, Iâ€™m going to come attack you .... naked. And since you seem to think my gorgeous husband Oliver is also exhausted, I will force him to come attack and prove to you just how exhausted we are.
Oh my heart it was so hard to leave that wee one this morning. You saw what a hard time I had Friday when we left him with Mum, and that was just to go to a different area of the Manor. I went to a completely different country today Draco! It helped that I left him with his other Daddy. I could NOT have done it if I'd had to leave him with Narcissa again. You know it's absolutely nothing against her, she's an amazing woman and a fantastic grandmother. I trust her with our children's lives constantly. But this whole thing with Gabe is so new and scary. I don't know if I'd even trust leaving him with Rowe right now and she's MORE qualified than either of us to care for him!
"I threw it in the Thames!" He shouted furiously, trying to break free of his bondage and leap across the table to get me.
I knew that foot binding was a thing, and I knew it wasn't a good thing, but I didn't know all of those specifics. That's just horrifying. Although it definitely makes me wonder; in that culture it was "normal" and those parents legitimately thought they were doing something good for their child, how many things do we do that would look nightmarish to someone outside of our society? I mean, I know I've mentioned that Neville's uncle dropped him out of a window to hopefully scare out his accidental magic, that is horrifying to me. And I KNOW his uncle was wrong and the whole idea was terrible, but he probably thought he was doing something good by bringing out Neville's magic.
I don't want to think about my fears right now, because I had a dream in which I turned into a dragon and burned you to a crispy crisp and then ate you and you tasted fucking fantastic! I couldn't get enough, but I was also so mad at myself because I didn't want to eat you *like that* - even though you were seriously the tastiest thing I'd ever had in my life, and that made me realize how fucked up I am. I mean, what if I *really* have a dragon inside me just waiting to eat you??? And then I'd be all alone for the rest of my life because I'd never recover from the insanity of losing you to... me? How does that work? I'm afraid I'll lose you to me? Hmm... That's definitely irrational. Wait, I think this might still be the bliss talking. I'm so sorry if none of this makes sense. I'm *trying* to keep on topic. Let me read your email again...
I'm quite excited to spend my own birthday here. I don't need anything for celebrating, I will just enjoy a perfect day in my favorite type of environment. Although if you really wanted to get me a present, you could take me down to the water and make love to me under the moonlight as midnight hits and it becomes my birthday. You know how I am with my midnight birthday tradition, I can't think of anything more perfect than you filling me as I officially become a year older.
And honestly Draco, even if that's what you were going for, am I really the person who is going to think less of you for wanting to be petted and told you're a good boy? Do you think less of me for wanting to be so good for you?
And this year's gala is going to be huge! It's the eleventh gala, and that makes this year the ten year anniversary of Unity House and Traditions. As always, all Unity Royalty will be invited. But Narcissa wants to, and everyone else agrees, have something to show just how many children have come through and the lives that have been changed. I'm not sure what she'll come up with, but I'm sure it will be beautiful and heart wrenching.
Jaz gave me a questioning look, probably wondering why Robards was so certain that I couldn't be successfully framed. I smiled and ruffled her hair as I gave her a kiss on the cheek.
She gave me a look that suggested I was being supremely unfair in chiding her rather than him, but otherwise stopped throwing a fit and let the sand fall to the floor. I straddled her over my hip and turned to give ICOW, BS a look to let him know that I actually did feel him to be at fault.
Then he quietly murmured quite possibly the only thing that would have gotten me to turn back into myself at that point: "Wow Draco, you're so tiny that my cock is bigger than you!"
I silently let him play out an interesting scene in his mind in which he sacrificed himself for her so that she could escape danger. I suppose he doesn't realize that our girl can actually protect herself and - more importantly - is smart enough to avoid such situations. In any case, he has my stamp of approval.
And just like I thought, there was discussion, it got heated in spots, but for the most part I think there's a stressful weight off of everyone's shoulders.
As for CafÃ© Exquis, you're probably going to laugh... So, what happened was that I met with the couple who wanted to open it and listened to their business plan, decided that it was worth investing in, and gave them enough money to cover all their projected costs - they had a lot of detailed estimates from real contractors, and actually, I put that money in an account that had a manager to ensure that they weren't just going to take it and run off. The manager had to approve expenditures and more or less only paid out to legitimate contractors and the like. Anyway, once that was set up, I didn't have to have anything more to do with the business. I grew a bit bored and eventually emailed you. Then I went to Russia for Pansy's wedding, then I came back and focused all my time and attention on you, so I ... forgot... Yes. I forgot that I owned CafÃ© Exquis. Even when we went on dates there, I wasn't thinking about it so much as I was thinking about you. Also, you probably assumed that when the 'owners' of the cafÃ© - the people who built it from scratch using my money - came over to our table to personally ensure that everything was excellent that they were fawning over you because of your fame, but in actuality, they wanted to make sure that I wasn't upset and likely to demand they pay me back sooner rather than later. Once they do, obviously they *will* own it, but until then, it's all in my name.
After a few strategic questions designed to NOT scare her off, we determined that she had no home (and thus no address to obtain a library card with), and that her mother has some form of cancer that is slowly killing her. Concerned, we naturally asked Shtara to stay in the bookstore and eat a sandwich and some biscuits while chatting with our Divas - as this was the last stop before they were going to be heading off to Hogwarts. Unsurprisingly, our Divas got along swimmingly with Shtara, despite the fact that they were 11 and she was only 9 at the time.
Apparently I seem like the perfect diversion for a few minutes or so. They even came to an agreement about it! If I should happen to agree to divert any of them, the others will watch that one's child/ren until we're done.
But back to Sirius. So it seems that Leah was a bit oblivious, so focused on OUR kids (helping Jaz with speech therapy and homework in general, tutoring Zaire as necessary, and then keeping a sharp eye on Shtara at all times during the play), that she just never noticed that she was pregnant. To be fair, she doesn't really look it. Apparently she found out this morning and came out to cry about it to the whole family.
Anyway, she will also be having a vaginoplasty so that she has a fully functioning vagina when they are done. Once again, I had to sort of go elsewhere in my mind as these things were being discussed because I REALLY didn't want any of that in my head. But those are the three definite surgeries.
You said on Friday that Viona was holding the baby; how did she do with him? I'm just curious as to how she's going to do when Orion and then the demon get here. It's the first time she's ever been around a baby younger than her. Daisy was the closest and she was a few months older.
So... alright, to be honest, I was sort of half mulling this over in the back of my mind. I KNEW that Oliver lamented not having the chance to carry a baby of his own, and it occurred to me that - just as I suggested previously - having me or Sebastian brew the potion with better ingredients would not only lead to a higher quality and more likely to work potion, but remember all the way back to Bubbles and the Demon? I originally thought I was pregnant but that just turned out to be wishful thinking and I had to have that resolved and try again?
I was now stroking Mahafsoun's hair, loving how soft and floaty it is. I think I may have even been purring.
Our "smaller" crowd yesterday at home was wonderful, but you know how much I look forward to Boxing Day at the Burrow every year. And as usual, it didn't disappoint.
It was such a lovely dinner, the kids all enjoyed having their favorite grownups with them. I just wonder, when Elena asked Greg if he would help her take Viona for a walk out in the gardens before bedtime, is he that thick that he didn't realize what was happening? Or does he not care? I am 99% sure that we will be seeing a lot of Greg in the next few weeks, I saw papers that looked remarkably like child-drawn blueprints sticking out of Lainie's robes when I put her to bed. He probably knows exactly what he's getting into with our tiny gorgeous manipulators, I just don't think he cares.
I grew quite distressed after just a few short minutes. I wanted to put her back to bed and hope she'd take a nap and then feel better, but I'm inclined to think that she's spent most of the weekend just lying in bed, not quite awake and not quite asleep either.
Oh hell, now I feel like a monster. Did I just inadvertently wish it had actually been my child that had been taken? My sweet, beautiful, wonderful, brilliant, creative, competitive, Haz? Wait, the other option is that I'm glad it's Harrison and NOT my kid. Either way I'm a despicable human being, I either wish my child had been kidnapped or I'm glad someone else was? A kid I love. Not that I'd want any child taken, even if I didn't know and love them. Ah, I'm making myself crazy. Maybe you're right and I do need some sleep.
"Is that so?" He asked with a mild tone that could be interpreted as amusement, or it could be interpreted as a soft but evil threat. "I am Nomzamo, descended from the Zulu Wizard tribe, and THIS MAN stole my son while he and his husband murdered me!"
Nora. The reason Nora is french is because she's our most recent addition to our family. She was adopted during a trip to Paris where her magic sought us out. Somehow knowing we were her forever family. She was born and raised in France, and while we are trying to make her more fluent in English as this is where she lives, we don't want her to lose her heritage or her first language.
, not too far from civilization that I felt as though we were going to go "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" but definitely secluded enough that I knew we could enjoy our kink indoors or outdoors and now worry about scaring the neighbors. We may have scared the wildlife, but no humans!
I grinned at you. "Well I WAS, but now I find that I'm in the mood to shag you up against the wall." As I said that, I'd backed you up against the nearest wall and was licking your neck."
Then I remembered that other parents around the world have mentioned things like having to drive their kids all over town to get them to go to sleep. Well, I wasn't certain that would work since my options are a super smoothly quiet sports car, or an also rather smooth flying carpet. Or...
There were two reasons for the glamour. First of all, as I was chasing Peter through the continent, I was hoping a glamour would keep him from realizing it was me that had found him. Possibly giving me those extra few seconds I might need to take him down. And the first few times I caught up with him were in heavily populated areas. I'd be almost close enough to get off a clear shot when he would shout something like "Oi Merlin, is that Harry Potter?" That's when I would get mobbed by the crowds. I hoped that by using a glamour I would be able to sneak up on him AND not be an easy distraction for him to use to get away again.
You saw the best there was in me, lifted me up when I couldn't reach, you gave me faith 'cause you believed, I'm everything I am, because you loved me,
My dragon who I don't even know if he exists anymore because it's been so long since I've been able to hold him in my arms. But I will be climbing into bed with you in less than three days! I leave here Tuesday, but with the length of the flight and the time change it will be Wednesday when I actually get home.
This was an ideal break from all the gala prep we'd been working on almost non stop for days. I mean that WE were able to take a break with Jaz, but the rest of our kids were still going at it under the supervision of Kamaria, Viona, Orion, and Eris. Which meant that we had Nora, our babies, Gemini, and Luka in with us.
"Well then, *specifically* put him down for after dinner, which is usually about 6 - that way, I can be on hand to see to it that he doesn't accidentally forget to let the kids play nicely by themselves for a bit while he relaxes. He has a habit of putting everyone else's needs before his own and if he didn't consider my word law on most things, he'd probably never take any time for himself!" I lamented.
"Plus I bet you get off on torturing us like that," least in shape grumbled under his breath, I let it slide this time because we were already five minutes over and I wanted to get home to you.
For an afternoon spent in a cemetery, we've had a surprisingly lovely time. We spread out a blanket, had a nice lunch, and Sirius and I told the kids all about my parents. Obviously Sirius had a lot more stories to tell, but I managed to get a word in here or there. I cried, Nora cried, Trey got glassy-eyed, and Sirius sobbed like a baby.
Realistically of course I see her. We see her throughout the weekdays when she has time off from her shows. We go see her perform fairly regularly. I like to pop over during time off from that job I don't have anymore!!! But she's a full time working woman who I sometimes wish would be underfoot and bugging me to take her shopping or bake her sweets.
"Non," I stated firmly, then whispered a question in his ear. This will sound bad, so brace yourselves. I asked him to take me back to his place. I swear to you, he lit up like Christmas had just come not even two months after the last time.
But she didn't do any of that. She waited. And that's what I find suspicious. Granted Rosalie *never* told me, and she had years, but the circumstances are obviously different. There had to be some form of intentional deceit in this mess somewhere, and until we find out more information, I don't know what to do. Other than to be there for you. At this point, what the hell?! Six can't possibly be more difficult than five. Right? (Please say I'm right.)
I daresay that if things went even half as well as they looked like, he will probably have a damn good chance of figuring out which gender he likes better.
Have I mentioned how much I adore movie nights? The kids have a blast, the adults enjoy it as well, there's just this sense of community that is perfect for me. And I love that I have an excuse to see Teddy at least once a week. I can't believe how quickly he's growing. And I love how he's really taken to Viona. Did you see him attempt to replicate her big brown eyes? He's been able to morph his hair since day one, but eye color is a new talent. I can't wait to see how he continues to grow his gift!
Our lives remain, in these small hours, these little wonders, these twists and turns of fate, time falls away, but these small hours, these small hours, still remain,
***Remember, the last chapter wasn't real. It was an alternative possibility based off an excellent prompt. So if you read this chapter and wonder where other Draco is, he was never here. Enjoy! ^_^
But I'm sure you're both surprised that I'm writing to you from Unity House again. Especially since I brought Ren with me I should definitely have my hands full today and not have a spare moment, let alone the many moments I would normally need to write an email. But ... erm ... see I had to step into the office to give Rowe a call about Serenity.
I really do think that much of the reason I can't let this go is the fact that I spent the last year or more, afraid for you, afraid for our family. And when we were safely removed from a war zone, I had told myself we were safe. I had to believe we were safe. I couldn't move forward in recovering from the trauma if I was busy expecting the next trauma to come jumping out at me. I know life is fragile and nothing is promised, but I feel as though we promised each other our safety and you broke that promise.
Yes Draco, this is how you bring something like this up ... AFTER the important conversation about the assassination attempt!
If you are curious, Here's where I got my inspiration for today's email: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnxfuvRHKDk
I know you wanted to leave 'Operation: get Neville's Long cock in Harry's Bottom" for a night that wouldn't upstage Pansy's announcement, but I had the perfect opportunity in front of me. I hope I was subtle enough not to anger Pansy's hormones. "Nev, swinging, sharing, or playing isn't right for every relationship, but there is nothing that would ever happen during these playtimes that would change how heart stoppingly in love with Draco I am, I am able to separate physical pleasure from feelings of friendship with our playmates, and nothing Draco could do would make me feel as though I didn't own 100% of his heart." I left it there because I knew pushing it any further would most likely anger or frustrate you, Nev, and Pansy, but I hope I gave him something to think about before you continue with your next attempt.
Seeing as we're waiting a bit on having a circle dinner to welcome Zaire until he's settled and feeling less guarded, I thought this might be a good opportunity to introduce him to whoever shows up for movie night. He wouldn't have to interact, he can just sit back and watch the movie while observing the people around him. And I know he wasn't particularly comfortable at Unity Africa, but it's such a similar atmosphere that it's not like we were trying to take him to Unity Park and really freak him out!
I was a little worried what the Slytherins were going to let our little ones get up to. I can imagine the ways they may try to fill the boredom of a Friday night. But then I thought: oh, well, my five year old rides flying invisible horses, so how much worse could things possibly get?
Hmm, except then I wouldn't really get to enjoy the spring bloom. And I suppose no full summer weather would mean limited outdoor swimming without extensive warming charms. And no winter, would definitely mean no snow. Ok, maybe I wouldn't really want to live somewhere with autumn weather all the time, I would miss the other seasons and I bet half of the magic of a brisk fall day becomes less special when that weather is every day. Alright, I won't insist we move somewhere permanently autumnal. But I do really love it right now!
I'm sure the Quartet as well as Pansy and Ivan feel the same way about our children. It's just so hard not getting to see them all the time.
When you talked about meeting him that first time at St. Mungo's and then went on to say you remember "all the harrowing details" I assumed you meant the details of his rescue and recovery. But no, you mean the harrowing details of his teenaged years. You, my love, are still most definitely the baby guy. Now that we have no babies, you're definitely the "little kid guy" and the "adult children guy" but you will never be the "teenager guy."
