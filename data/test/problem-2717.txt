was hot and damp. A huge contrast from the room where he waited for three hours at the Portkey Station, filled with cooling charms. His clothes were sticking to his skin, and having long hair didn’t seem like a good idea right then. Even in a ponytail, it increased the heat on his nape to almost scalding.
He would have done it, because being stuck in that place, unable to get his life moving, was worse than everything else.
It was nothing like that. And he liked it.
“Tupã blessed them with beautiful and—hmm,
Potter blinked and took his sweet time before darting his eyes from Draco’s now covered body to his eyes. “Oh, right…” Potter started, scratching his nape, and licked his lower lip. “They’re spiritual animals. Familiars. Students here are not allowed to bring their own, because we believe the animal—or Eí—will choose its wizard and bond with them. That’s how I met Naza. She was just a baby snake at the time and had trouble getting out of her egg; her siblings had already left. I took her in, and well, she stayed. She can sense what I feel, that sort of thing.”
certain the
No point in just delaying the inevitable, he mused, deciding it was not worth risking the macaw’s anger if he took too long to follow. So down he went, staggering after the bird, almost all drowsiness having left his body by now.
Lady of Destiny
Potter frowned and averted his stormy green eyes to the door of the Jeep
Draco didn’t want to know what the bloody hell was Tree Com for now—his resentful brain was already busy wondering how fast Potter had learnt it all so that he could beat him somehow—so he went for a subject that presented less of a chance of a meltdown. “Does everybody here perform wandless magic?” Because, again, he hadn’t seen a wand on Francisca.
Potter said, “There are only two kinds of weather here, Draco: hot and wet. I advise you to keep your cooling charms in check.” Then muttered under his breath, “Come on. She only failed me once, because Curupira messed up the spells I put in it.”
The most amazing part wasn't it.
a very interesting book featuring a ghost narrating his autobiography.
“No. It’s not—” Potter’s hands clutched desperately to Draco’s shirt, opening each button with unsteady fingers.
Draco stumbled back, grey orbs on the hand still firmly tied to his forearm. Harry followed him, eyes closed, breathing Draco in, until Draco’s knees gave in to the couch behind him, his body falling on the padded surface with a soft thud.
“What are you doing…?” Draco hummed, tipping his head back.
“So, did you do the ritual? How was it?”
very worried. Not about Potter’s confidence or the success rate of the ritual. But there was a nagging feeling in the back of his head, repeating that what usually worked for
, not a dragon.” Rudá smirked, watching the toucan throw his cards on the table, hands still trapping Draco. He turned back, pink eyes on him again. “I’ve heard so much about you already. No tale did justice to your beauty, my angel,” Rudá started, heavy-lidded eyes piercing into Draco’s. “I can’t tell you how anxious I’ve been to finally meet you!” He stretched a hand, petting the stalker-parrot still on Draco's shoulder. “Good boy, bringing him here to me.”
“Yes, yes. I’ve heard it all.” Draco rolled his eyes, slumping further under the tree where he was resting. Harry’s body cast a shadow over his own.
is much like Apparating,” Harry said, for the tenth time. “You have to focus on your destination. It’s a bit more complex, though, as you have to use your connection to the forest to pinpoint the location you want to go.”
Draco nodded once as she slid by his side. “It’s beautiful. Tainara was just telling me about the Dance of the Fire, right?” But when he turned to the girl, he noticed she wasn’t there anymore.
Potter merely shrugged, as if it was nothing. After all, it wasn’t
Instead, he took Draco to what seemed to be another one of the interminable cabins. Upon inspection, however, Draco soon realised it was not the same structure. The wooden pillars formed what looked like an open barn.
“These creatures only work in their own time, and to their own desires. If they don’t want to meet with you, you’ll never find them. Worse, you’d probably be lost in the forest forever.”
The bit of information had been given so freely it took Draco by surprise. He darted a glance at Potter, satisfied to notice the flush in his cheeks, but said nothing else.
“Thought you’d be happy to see me.”
Draco was expecting the rejection. He had his mind protected, too, just in case. Still, he stalked after Lua, arguing about the benefits of helping him.
Draco snorted. “Who is the stupid one, in the end?”
“Harry,” he corrected, but then quieted. The uneasy energy around him betrayed Harry was still waiting for something.
It was an acceptable arrangement.
“Yeh, yeh. That’s what I’m tryna say, man.”
leaving Potter’s house. Here he had at least a roof over his head and decent cooling charms keeping him refreshed.
“Yes, Drrragon Boy. No to darrrk in my forrrest, and we will let you in,” she agreed, sounding bored now.
All the Dark magic he had watched taking over Harry during the last weeks, the mood he had seemed to be in.
“Well, I don’t know, Potter. Sometimes I still marvel at your capacity to form coherent thoughts.”
It was easier now that he had been accepted by the school.
There it was again. Just a word.
. And it was not like the warmth from Potter’s magic. Nor did it feel like
“Well, I can assure you it very much can. I got stung at least twice today and thrown against a wall. I’m not in the mood to serve as Castelobruxo’s punching bag any longer.”
“It means light, or star,” Tainara drawled later that day.
But Francisca only directed a sympathetic grin at him. “I know Harry, and he trusts you. He
wouldn’t have sent him to Brazil completely unaware that Harry ‘We Had Nothing Serious’ Potter was there waiting for him. Longbottom wouldn’t even see what was coming before it hit him once Draco was back in London.
Caipora seemed satisfied and let go of his arm. The skin where she had held him too tightly was pristine, but the Dark Mark seemed lighter, barely visible.
Draco cringed inwardly.
She faced him. “We know they don’t like you already, so we take precaution. I’d say don’t let go of my hand, but I don’t trust them. So I’ll tie us up, okay? Still, try to hold my hand at all times.”
“She lives with her tribe. I’ve never been to visit her, though, they’re really private. But if you ever need someone who understands this forest, that’d be Tai.”
Everything fell quiet all at once.
“There was a young Carajá indigenous boy who loved nature, and talking to animals and birds. He loved watching the stars before going to sleep. However, one night, the Carajá noticed the sky was empty, darkness stretching all around. He asked, ‘Why is the sky so empty?’ But the animals and birds pretended they didn’t hear, and so the Carajá repeated it. ‘Please, tell me,’ he pleaded.
Draco ignored her taunt.
“Sorry, I’m taken.” The words came out with a silly giggle, but Draco pushed Saci away, anyway.
real, then it had happened only in there. Probably. Otherwise, there’d be Aurors at his doorstep by now, no matter how far from home he was. Draco doubted his status as a prime suspect in everything that went wrong near him would change much over the years.
However, the verb "passar" without the "mal", translate to
“Don’t be dramatic, Draco,” Longbottom chuckled, but then flinched. “Actually… Harry asked us not to tell anyone. He was afraid of the press finding out, and… you can imagine it.”
But it was just so hot.
As excited as Draco was about learning how to drive, he wasn’t confident enough to do it alone just yet—even with Potter’s charmed map to always show him the right path home and all the protection spells on the car. Since most of the students still hadn’t returned from the carnival holidays, Potter wasn’t terribly busy. Draco had such an easy time convincing Potter to take him back to Castelobruxo that afternoon when he got a positive answer after inquiring about the Potions master of the school that the smug smile stayed plastered on his lips all the way over.
“Salazar, Potter, that’s no time for an honest man to be out of bed.”
darkness. Easy.
“Then…” Well… then it was over. He squared his shoulders, “I
“It’s too late, Draco,” Tainara continued, her smirk turning impossibly larger. She shook her head and moved her hand up, throwing something she held up in the air, catching it, and then repeating the motion. “It’s too late.”
Oh, but Draco was such a great liar. Sometimes he didn’t even realise he was lying to himself.
It couldn’t be. Not this.
Potter patiently walked him through all the gadgets, pointing to every button on the panel, and explaining all the safety measures Draco should take before starting the car. Draco let Potter’s silvery accent wash over him, determinedly following his instructions.
“Mr Malfoy, calm down,” Berenice said, her voice low and melodious, resonating as one with his mind. “Everything will be alright. You’re fine, now. You’re breathing slowly and thinking of a way out of this. I know you are.”
Whatever this power was, whatever it meant. He could feel its tendrils stranded between the silent, terrorised students. Whose nightmare had made it so eerily quiet? Would Draco lose the ability to speak once he crossed the border?
Draco couldn’t move, enthralled by the creature and its small paws that reached for him. A smile tugged at Draco’s lips and he didn’t prevent it.
Its name was
He ran outside, Machado following suit, too jittery to stay still. The Jeep should still be there, parked under a tree, exactly how he had left it the last time it was used.
“Zere’s zomething guarded inside ze zeed.” Lua turned it over between her fingers. “Zomething evil.”
Draco was getting used to staying there, even if he was not doing very useful things with his time. He and Potter both created a routine and fell easily into pace, as frightening as that might be.
Draco tried grabbing Berenice, but it was too late. His back hit the ground with force, air painfully knocked out from his lungs. He coughed, turning around and leaning on his hands as blood leaked from his mouth.
After that night, he started to wonder if that was the reason Potter was really hiding in the middle of nowhere. Shame, and not freedom. Caipora had said Draco might still have darkness in him, but… he was not the only one. Everyone has a bit of darkness inside. He just hoped Potter’s light shone brighter than his shadows.
“What? It can’t do that.” Tainara was laughing, despite the grimace etched into her face.
“What the fuck…?” Draco sputtered. He couldn’t be intimidated by that. He could not let Potter’s voice get to him—it was
The news had travelled fast, after some students had heard the Headteacher talking to Draco and Harry on the day of the Kuarup Ritual. None of them, however, displayed any hostile behaviour towards him, and Draco thanked them for it. He guessed everyone was too tired to hate him.
The Pire of Iaké by Tainara’s feet was nothing more than a pile of ash, darkness and despair.
Potter
Saci did, and Draco didn’t go back to Harry’s place until he was sure Harry had left to work again the next morning. Or the same eternal morning since the disaster.
Lua smacked his head. Caipora was about to laugh, he could tell.
“Sure, like it’s that easy.”
a good man, he had made sure of that in the years after the war. Guilt would never leave him, but that was not what this was about. He grew, he became a better person. He knew the wrongs he had done would follow him forever and he’d never stop redeeming himself. But he could do
But it didn’t mean it was.
Once they had landed and Draco was safely on the ground again, still bleeding and dizzy from the transportation, he got to his feet. Saci grabbed his elbows when Draco swayed dangerously to one side.
He knew where to go, and the night sky enveloped him as he followed Machado to where he needed to be.
his guide in this insane place. It was not absurd at all that he leant on Potter, even after only a few days.
got the sun to dawn.
Draco pulled it from his holster and pointed at the object. His eyes, though, were on the creatures. “It doesn’t work. I’ve been trying magic since the first time I opened it.”
you’d do what I needed you to,” Tainara pressed, but Draco’s eyes didn’t leave Tainara’s foot pressed against Harry’s shoulder while the streams of dark energy tried to break into Berenice’s shield. “You not only helped me craft the rest of the potion, but you also made him vulnerable.” She smiled, and Draco finally snapped his eyes to her face. “Aren’t you proud?”
Tainara frowned, pulling the book back and turning the pages quickly. “I don’t know about that second one, but the other… Devil’s Eyes, you mean, like guarana?” She lifted her head and stared at him questioningly.
“It iss the Dark Boy,” the creature hissed, in a way that reminded him too much of Harry’s Parseltongue—minus the arousal—staring at Draco with a pointed and honestly terrifying glare. Curupira’s voice sounded so animalistic and alien that it took Draco a moment longer to compute that the creature was speaking English. And it had just called him Dark Boy. Who the fuck was he to tell if Draco was dark or not? Draco was torn between being a terrible person or someone better since the war, too much on his own, to need the judgment of a being who didn’t even have hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
Now, though, it was hard to ignore the loss that flying made him feel. Loss of so much time having passed without ever experiencing it again—Draco glanced at Potter, at his blinding smile as he swayed from one side to the other. The loss for what he could have had, Draco thought.
“What… excuse me?" Draco started, snorting. "I do not… I’m here for important research, something that could change lives, help people. This is not about me!”
“Zon’t be stupid. It had to have the night
Not that it’d be the best plan to exploit Lua’s weakness—if she had any—considering she was already too suspicious of Draco. But there had to be
bored. It’s too hot and everyone is busy with homework. Wish I had something to do.”
Saci was born from the bamboo bud, living there for 7 years, then 77 more practicing his tricks among humans and animals. Then, when his time is done and he dies, he becomes a poisonous mushroom.
Draco paused, glancing at the telly for a second. Was that what Potter watched religiously every day? He fixed his posture, staring at the man once more, considering how to understand what was Potter’s life as he bundled himself up alone in the cabin.
Potter’s arms closed tightly around him. Draco leaned all his weight on Potter as he was carried inside.
“Ouch, stop that!” He tried waving him away, but the animal only got more determined, raking his head against Draco’s cheek. “What do you want? I’m sure you don’t need me to feed you or anything. Go look for Potter, he’s the one with the knack for helping every weakling he can find.”
Arm still tied to Francisca’s, Draco shook those thoughts away. He would be damned before he let Potter mess with his head like that again. Draco didn’t need the git’s help. He could very well fix this situation on his own.
Draco shouldn’t get used to that. To belonging. Longing for something he couldn’t have anymore was dangerous.
Both José and Harry laughed, but did not contradict her. He was under the impression she was not an easy woman to oppose, and just accepted the jab with a stilted laugh.
If we let him open the coconut again, he'll release Jurupari.
Harry glanced at him, pulling a branch out of the way. He didn’t answer, though, instead keeping a balanced pace with Draco right on his heels.
healthy?” Draco nodded at her questioning glance. “Healthy boy. But Jurupari, God of Darkness, you remember about him, right? He was jealous of the boy and decided to kill him, when he was…” she seemed confused for a moment, “taking fruits in the forest.”
Draco barely remembered going back home and lying on the bed, apart from Harry’s soft whispers in his ears and his steady hands holding him. Harry changed his clothes at some point. The feel of the magic cleaning Draco was warm before he had given in to sleep. It was Harry’s magic, and it felt…
“Don’t worry,” she snorted, finally releasing his arm as they stepped to the edge of the forest. “That’s where I come in.”
“Did it?” Draco took his cup, letting the steam melt a bit of all the cooling charms the house held inside.
But this calm felt like it didn’t belong to him.
There was little that was special about the dark, wooden furniture, the rugs on the floor or the walls filled with moving portraits of the friends Potter left in London. Still, it reeked of Potter, of his magic, of his presence. It hurt being there. It was the kind of hurt that came with the awareness of the hole this place would leave in him when Draco wasn’t there anymore, rather than how the warmth in it made him sure that he’d never feel lonely there.
The car turned left, alarmingly close to hitting a tree. Draco held the windowsill, trying to focus on his breathing for now. Surely Potter knew what he was doing.
“Yes. There’s no point in looking for any of them. They’re too cunning.”
The darkness came to him, as if his and Saci’s magic were a magnet and Draco was the inter-mediating instrument. He fought it; the energy threatening his body, its control. He fought it with the only thing he was sure was real inside him; the love Draco felt for Harry. The certainty that the day would be over and things would be good and Harry would hold him again.
“We can teach you to open it,” she said, shrugging unconcerned.
Only he couldn’t. Obviously.
“But you will.” Caipora smirked, pointing with her head towards Draco.
He lifted his head slowly, eyes meeting hers and finding nothing but contentment and arrogance.
“Calm down,
And what he was doing wasn’t

feel about Potter.
like anything Draco had imagined. He gawked at the rustically garnished room, unsure of what to stare at first. At the giant gameleira tree—Potter’s addendum, because there was no way in hell that Draco would remember that name—standing resolute right in the middle of the space. Or the thick roots that crept from the base of the tree, slithering through the hard stone floor like the bodies of dormant Basilisks, serving as improvised tables and benches for the students. Despite the sturdy canopy almost completely covering the ceiling, sunlight bled around the room.
The Pink Dolphin morphs into a tall, handsome, and elegantly dressed man at night. He wears an all-white suit and a hat to cover his blowhole since the shape-shifting is not total. He, then, goes to the villages and seduces women, impregnating them and running off to the river when the sun is born. In smaller towns, for many years (and possibly until today) many women with kids with unknown fathers were said to been have impregnated by the Pink Dolphin.
“I feel terrible. But perfect,” Draco said. And he did. He felt
“I’m curious about something though,” Harry started, fingers softly stroking Draco’s hair, disentangling the knots he had put there himself while gripping to his platinum bands with force.
“So what?” Tainara snorted, grimacing and rolled her eyes. “Brazilian tribes are much better.”
He had given up trying to watch the end of
He was fucked. But he might educate Potter, at least.
The closest expression in English would be: avoid somebody or something like the plague
Draco inhaled deeply, closed his eyes and squared his shoulders. “
Harry inhaled deep, his eyes went wide for a moment, and then he was smiling. He didn’t ask for permission; he didn’t warn Draco before he was leaning in and his lips grazed his. Draco let them.
Draco raised an eyebrow, but nodded. “Something dark would tempt me. You said I should say no.”
what was going to happen. They’re toying with me and you know that. Tell me they did that to you when you got here as well.”
He took a deep breath. No. No, it wouldn’t end like this. He wouldn’t lose Harry to yet another dark being, another tainted magic. He
“I’m the last one,” the indigenous girl went on, voice now graver, solemn. She lifted a hand and Harry did the same. The shadows began to gather around them again.
“The husband sent three messengers to get the night from her mother, and the snake gave them a sealed tucumã seed, saying the night was inside it and they should not open it. But men—like ye—are curious, and they heard noises, and broke the seal and opened the seed.”
Draco didn’t stick out for the answer. The urge to run took over him, and his feet were taking him away before he rationalised about it. Draco had never run so much or so fast in his life.
, abstaining from his usual snarky comments about the characters and the stupidities of Maria do Carmo, the protagonist—he liked Nazaré better.
Draco expected little from him, anyway. Saci was good company, and though his transportation magic had saved Draco’s skin just now, he was not that skilled overall. Or willing.
“I would advise against that,” the damned woman interjected.
Draco’s empty coconut cup ended up abandoned at another table when Harry dragged him to the edge of the living section. Harry seemed to believe it was too noisy down there, and that the night was perfect for sky gazing, which ended up with them climbing up one of the biggest trees.
“Explain to me, then.”
show you the books.”
The fear of being out in the open had been so intense back then that Draco had walked only a couple of blocks before he’d started panting. He’d gone into the first shop he saw: a little antique store.
Are you sssure you changed, Dark Boy?”
He shook his head, scrambling for his coolest tone. “Not so good, I must say, if it took you three hours to get here.”
Was it his fault?
It was… fascinating. A bit terrifying, for how impossibly high those things were, but remarkable.
Draco didn’t let her finish, raising a placating hand. “I really appreciate your help, but I don’t think Homunin will be very pleased with me if I keep contradicting it. I need to get accepted by the ritual. There’s no other way.”
was putting it lightly.
His other hand held the coconut high at the tip of his wand. Sparks started coming out of the wand. They were not actually harmful, for now, but seemed true enough to show that he was really willing to destroy that thing.
Potter. Potter. Potter!
Draco was not used to having Harry’s undivided attention. Not anymore. He was not used to
Draco raised an eyebrow, keeping his eyes on the path. “Weren’t you?”
“Are those…?”
“I… you… did you just…” he started feebly. “I’m Draco Malfoy, I—”
Later that night, when Draco was dozing on top of Harry, Nazaré crept on the bed around his thighs, cold and malleable.
, but he bought it, anyway. That had been the first time he’d met his former fiancée.
Sighing, he shook his head and his shoulders, freeing them from the Headteacher’s grasp. Steely grey eyes met hers. “Who the fuck are you? What did you do to me?”
Draco raised an eyebrow, pushing the man again and stepping aside, out of Rudá’s reach. “Great, I’m here now. Tell me what you want, before I regret ever listening to you.”
. Even when all the odds were against them; when he had been trapped in his house with a madman, or when Harry sliced him open in a bathroom and he had almost—for a whole second—wished that he didn’t need to open his eyes again, or when Harry left and broke him to pieces. Not now, when Draco couldn’t—
Potter’s magic had always felt warm and comfortable. It tasted citric on Draco’s tongue and accepted him easily.
Draco hadn’t asked, but he didn’t point that out. He could relate to that level of commitment to a job.
“Draco!” Francisca’s hand was on his shoulder, pulling him back.
If Draco still knew Potter as he used to—something he denied vehemently—this anxiety would wear off in a few days.
It didn’t. He doubted that was what the snake had said, anyway.
“He’s a friend of mine,” Potter said, pointing to where Draco had taken a seat on a bench under a tree by the edge of the field. “From Hogwarts.”
Their shield fell. Draco raised his wand. Spells flew from his mouth, but they didn’t take life.
So, he hugged Harry tighter, pressing Harry's face against his own chest. Shaking his head slowly to Saci, Draco’s lips mouthed
“That’s awesome,” Potter prodded. “Last I heard, no one came even close to finding out what had left them like that. They thought it was some kind of spell, wasn’t it? You’re amazing.”
Not heartbreak, not loneliness or loss, but that thrill of hope for something Draco never thought he’d have back at the reach of his hands. He didn’t want to let it go. He couldn’t let it go.
“You seemed so eager to run away from Martin.”
Yes, he had read about her. Of course.
Naturally, Draco
They had a good routine, and it matched their needs; Harry’s not to be alone at all times, and Draco’s appeasing Harry’s sense of protection whenever he thought Draco was feeling down.
The coconut was still in his possession, but some reservations prevented Draco from opening it. That was when he started hearing it. The indistinct noises coming from inside the thing. Low growls, he could swear, leaves rustling against the wind that sang through cracks he could not see on the surface of the thing. It was alive and cold, and it scared him more than anything else in that place.
“Fuck,” he cursed, raising his head.
However,
That stupid human. Don't you think I've thought about everything already?
Draco had to open it. And let the darkness go, so that light could come in.
—not that the Malfoy name meant a lot right now. But he should have
The hardest part, however, was trying to keep going when he knew there was really nothing he could do to change his situation except wait. His research was completely stalled. No matter how much Draco read about Brazilian history and myths, he wasn’t getting any closer to an answer.
“It’s an endangered species,” Harry continued, his voice louder now that the jaguar had disappeared between the trees. “People hunt them for their fur. To make coats.”
cackled even louder. “
Draco tried not to flinch at the memory of the last Creature Care professor he had met and smiled kindly at José.
The library was
Young boy.
How the fuck did she know so much? Draco wondered.
Draco, too, was getting used to the bird and it barely even bothered him anymore when the creature would nibble at his ear, looking for attention. Still, he said, containing a grin, “To make him feel even more entitled? No, thank you.”
it again. He all but held his breath, trying to avoid the trembling that threatened to overtake his entire body.

“No, keep climbing!”
was not the last of his species. But they weren’t the friend Draco had made and they would never fill this space. Draco would, however, gladly meet them and their quirks.
Harry laughed, shaking his head. “You know, I never pictured you to be the nature type.” His hand left a burning desire at Draco’s back when he went back to the car.
“I mean, when you arrived, you were so stiff and grim, and now”—he winked at Draco—“you seem more relaxed, lighter.”
“I didn’t see anything.”
That seemed to improve the mood in the room, as Potter's smile grew wider, and the whole air around them felt lighter at the same moment. Draco averted his gaze. The warmth that spread in his chest whenever he faced Potter’s grin was dangerous.
“And I want answers. Are you ready to give them to me?”
Draco knew he would be accepted even if they hadn’t done that. However, it was a good feeling knowing there would never be another one like him, rejected and judged by a past that didn’t represent who he was anymore.
So when Draco first saw the silhouette of Castelobruxo, he didn’t even try to hide his astonishment.
,” she muttered to herself, absent-minded. “Inca! That’s it. And some other people. They all decided this school would be for every wizard in Latin America and changed the name to Castelobruxo. And build a golden castle. I don’t like it a lot.”
His fingers tightened around the small coconut and Draco screamed, much like Harry had that first time in the forest. “You won’t scare me away!” He doubted his cry could cut through the walls of noise the intense wind provoked, but felt certain that whoever needed to hear that would. Draco was not someone to be scared away as easily as those creatures might believe. “I’m not going anywhere and I
José added, “You could stay, you know. I think you’d like to live here.”
He turned to Draco. “My ancestors might be Latin, Brazilian even. It’s unclear. I was travelling the world trying to figure it out, when I came here and…” Potter had a shy grin playing in his face. “Stayed.”
It didn’t really matter that even his magic disagreed with that plan, flaring wildly at the most inconvenient times—when he attempted to touch one of Potter’s photographs, or when he closed the door to his guest room and it stung him. Draco knew deep down in his bones that this was just a presage of how bad this arrangement would end.
“Some of them, yeah, every week, at least. They help me with classes when they feel like it. These creatures are a bunch of lazy sods.” A blithe chuckle escaped her lips as Francisca raised her head. “Ah, just one more thing.” She shoved a hand in her trouser’s pocket and pulled out a rustic tobacco pipe big enough to make Draco consider whether there was an expansion charm in the pocket. “I always keep one of those in hand, in case they decide to grace us with their presence. This here”—she twirled the pipe in her fingers, before handing it to Draco—“pleases most of them. Caipora, Curupira and Saci, at least. I’m never sure about the
“Because, Rudá gave it to me for a reason,” Draco said. “It has to have something to do with my research, doesn’t it?”
that.
Completely unable to utter comprehensible words, to organise his thoughts, Draco turned to face Potter. Despair grew inside him, gutting the hopes that things would be better once he cured those people affected by the war.
Draco felt
“This is not funny. I don’t know why you are so happy. Honestly.” Draco rolled his eyes. “I don’t have the slightest chance of getting accepted by the school or finishing my research. The creatures were mellowing to me, but now…” He huffed, dropping both hands on his lap, a heavy sigh escaping his thin lips. “The Headteacher wants me gone.
Draco panted, quivering hands gripping the blankets. His throat hurt, his breathing came out ragged and anxious, but there was nothing holding him anymore. Not the dark, icy fingers of the night, not Potter’s magic.
“I have a life in London, Potter,” Draco said instead, body going a tad stiff under the other.
Draco nodded, resigning himself to spending more time with Potter. He’d survive this, he had to. It’d serve only to strengthen him. Dealing with Potter was definitely a challenge.
“Me too.”
“Salazar…” Draco said, eying the shot warily. He downed it at once, though, because there wasn’t really an excuse he could use to avoid the experience as Harry stared at him with those round, pleading eyes. How could he say no? Draco’s body wasn’t built to deny Potter anything.
Draco’s grin was tight, straining the muscles on his face, when he said, “It had to be Harry Potter.”
was a male macaw. However, whenever he saw Draco and the bird, he didn’t seem capable of holding back his grin. “Oh, he’s still sticking with you. I think he likes your clothes,” said José.
Draco opened his mouth, rebuttals coming to him even in his weak state, but the Headteacher raised a hand, stopping him from even trying. “Am. I. Clear?”
Who is that handsome friend of yours? Oh, the one from London? Don't you speak Portuguese?
Draco strolled for long enough that he started worrying about what he might hear from Potter when he came back—the fear of getting trapped there forever was abated by the audacity and absurdity of the whole thing. He was too far gone now to be concerned about what those creatures might do to him. Honestly, if they wanted to hurt Draco, they’d probably have done that when he spent hours alone and completely lost in the forest that time before. They might trick him, absolutely, but Draco liked to think he could handle provocation.
Apart from himself and the woman behind the counter, there wasn’t a single soul in the Portkey Station. The clerk, however, didn’t look bothered in the slightest by the smothering emptiness of the space.
Curupira is a boy with flame-coloured hair and feet turned backwards. He’s the protector of the forest and uses his speed and backward feet to deceive and mislead hunters that mean harm to his woods. He doesn't tolerate those who threaten to harm the environment, but he helps the lost or in need. Curupira is also tricky and mischievous. He can whistle nonstop and imitate sounds of nature and human voices to torment and confuse his targets. Curupira loves smoking and drinking sugarcane liquor (
“You’re joking,” he whispered.
That got him a roaring laugh. “It’s charmed. The Jeep. Kind of like the Knight Bus, you know? We won’t hit anything, don’t worry. And I’m an excellent driver. Just… keep all of you inside of the car.”
He spent the next few days reading everything he could on
“It’s an ocelot,” Potter murmured, bumping his shoulder against Draco’s once they were out of the car.
, Potter said,
But, despite Potter’s best intentions on helping Draco, their prior research proved unproductive. Potter wasn’t able to find a single thing on “Olhos de Demônio”, as he assured Draco was the Portuguese translation of one plant, and that the other was likely wrong because there wasn’t a single register about it. Draco was torn between believing the name was wrong or Potter’s translation was.
Of course! Saint Fucking Potter had to be the best of them all. His magic was so powerful that it just
“I told ye not to open the tucumã. And not to trust Rudá. And—”
Draco recoiled a bit more at each of his words, but the man kept pushing closer and closer until Draco’s back had hit the trunk of a tree and the stranger was inches apart from him.
“Fair enough.” Harry’s laugh filled the clearing as he stripped off his own clothes.
“How are you enjoying the Kuarup night?” she asked.
Draco willed his thoughts in the right direction, concentrating on his feet and on the path ahead, dodging lower branches and roots on the ground trying to keep him from his prey.
Draco glanced at the star-filled sky, at the brightness that the King Vulture had left behind. He wasn’t so sure people hadn’t learned that secret, after all. People changed, too. They became better. They had to.
“I’m beginning to see the benefits of this ritual.”
Her smile was enormous, her skin had acquired a darker tan, and she had traded her facial paint and school clothes for some kind of dress that seemed softer under the scalding forced weather.
The car took a wild—and potentially deadly—turn. Draco stole a terrified glance in Potter’s direction, who didn’t seem to mind or be worrying too much about his perilous driving.
The fire was out, but the people kept dancing and chanting, and howling. He couldn’t hear them. Everything was muffled by a long loud buzz in his ears.
The woman raised an eyebrow, giving him a dismissive glance. “The language spoken in Brazil is Portuguese, sir.”
“A bond?” he asked, and then repeated himself to be sure he had heard correctly. “A
“You mean, it could… banish me from the grounds?” he asked, a lump of panic settling in his throat.
Hands grabbed his abdomen, and the world disappeared inside a vortex of wind.
He had opened the seed.
He ended up in the armchair, Nazaré arched over his lap, with a book called
tosser tried to braid Nazaré, too? She was furious with
At Draco’s pointed glance, Potter continued—now more genuinely—apologetically. “Right, yes, I was planning on introducing you two sometime today, but I thought she was shedding. She said she liked you.” He added the last part as if it would appease Draco’s temper now that the harm was done.
“Heya, Draco,” Tainara, Potter’s rebel student, said. Her smile was as bright as the sun, and almost as blinding. She had no headdress today, although there was a lonely black feather hanging from her ear, complimenting the drawings in black paint adorning her features. Draco made a mental note to ask her about the paintings.
you open it ze first time?” Lua narrowed her eyes at him, and something in her tone let him know she knew the answer. And he should too.
Draco snorted, forcing himself to look away, not to stare at the deep expectant green eyes. “You think I do, Harry?” He shrugged. “Still, I’m here… I want to be with you now, because you make me feel special. That’s purely egoistic, really.”
Draco had to concede to that. “Absolutely. Yes. She’s terrifying.”
Draco knelt down by his side, grabbing Harry’s torso between his arms, holding him tight. “Please, Harry. Talk to me, please.”
prepared for this and all he wanted was to run and hide, and never think about backward feet and boys with impish grins again.
“Whenever Jaci hid behind the clouds, it meant he had company, that he had taken one girl and made them into stars,” Harry continued, sliding the shirt off of Draco’s torso. The words fell to his skin like a blanket, while his fingers worked the flies of his pants open. “Naiá, a beautiful indigenous girl, dreamed of being taken by the moon. But, one night, admiring Jaci’s reflection in the river… She started believing he was coming to take her. So smitten Naiá was, she fell in the river and drowned.” Draco’s pants slid down his thighs, Harry’s lips tracing each of the scars on his chest in slow motion. He lifted his head, looking up at Draco, a crooked smile playing on his lips. “Touched, Jaci made her into a star of the river, transforming Naiá into the Victoria Regia.”
“Yeah, that’s him!” Potter replied, as if understanding the language the boy spoke was a normal part of his day. From the way he had talked to the clerk at the Portkey Station, Draco assumed it was. “This is Draco, everyone.”
Annoyed by the silence, Potter poked him in the ribs. “Hey, it’ll be alright, don’t worry.”
The seed trembled in his palm; the heat becoming almost unbearable. Then, just like before, it sliced itself in two.
Rudá, according to Francisca, was known as
The macaw looks like this:
Draco tugged his face. “I love you, Harry. I’ve loved you for so long. And I hated you for leaving me behind.”
Draco had felt pain in his life. All kinds of pain. The one from a
It was easier to deal with having lost Harry
“Why is it so hot here?” It wasn’t that hot, but Draco was sweating, feverish skin turning a shade redder. He felt like boiling. Maybe it was what hell felt like.
“What is going on? The world was upside down and nobody noticed it.” Potter’s voice filled the room, soft and slower than the song, uncertain at first. He whispered the words into Draco’s ear, resting his head against Draco’s shoulder. “What is going on? I was at peace when you arrived.”
Draco shouldn’t be surprised, considering this was the most obtuse man he’d ever met. But he still huffed a disbelieving laugh and shook his head. Keeping his tone barely a whisper, he said, “We were back to Potter when you disappeared on me seven years ago. Pardon me for falling back to old habits regarding the man that didn’t have the decency to
And then Saci’s whirlwind appeared again, so strong it almost tripped Draco. He pressed his back against the tree behind him, fingers closing firmly on the seed, arms bracing for the impact, when Saci came lurching for him.
Potter chuckled, shaking his head, and his stare softened somewhat. “You didn’t have to clean my house. And no, I don’t expect you to do that—”
(See the end of the chapter for
Despite his amused tone, Draco recognised the truth for what it was. It was too bad (for himself) he could still identify Potter’s slight nuances.
down his throat to ease the burn. Surprisingly, it worked. It was not that bad. But Draco was not about to admit it.
What had he been thinking when he left London? Even with Hogwarts, and the war, and Voldemort sharing his house, and everything that Draco had had to live through, he still felt terribly unprepared for what he was facing now. Draco didn’t belong here, didn’t belong with Harry. Everything went wrong because of Draco.
Draco was nothing but shadows.
Draco had still to figure out
Well, if it wasn’t the most confusing and appalling conversation Draco had ever heard. And Draco had had his fair share of obnoxious people.
The Jeep was an old model—not that Draco would be able to tell. Apparently, it reacted best to magic, and it was not only spelled to avoid animals but also to make the actual driving an easier task. The steering wheel turned smoothly at the softest movement of his hands, and Draco switched gears—something that seemed to him terribly archaic—with relative ease. Even the impact of the gags the car gave whenever Draco got the clutch pedal wrong were smoothed down by Potter’s magic.
“Oh no. I was passing by when I saw you coming out of the woods,” José said, watching Machado take off from his shoulder and disappear with others like him in the sky. “You’re very comfortable now, right?”
“I missed you so much, Harry.”
surprised. But someone ought to remind her that nothing made sense to Draco.
The Living Section had been transformed into something even more magical that night. Right in the centre of the main field, the flames of a bonfire made the shadows dance in a slow, hypnotising pattern. Many small light spheres weaved between the trees, casting a yellowish glow on the furthest and darkest spots, where the silvery cold brilliance of the moon couldn’t reach. Some vivid yellow and red ribbons had been tied to the branches and swayed softly in the cool breeze.
My city has one of the biggest (and longest) carnivals in Brazil, it always starts on a Thursday and lasts 6 days (yes, that's true, practically 24h a day). There are also tons of other parties happening before and after this week. When I was at school (and even college) we got those 6 days off, and sometimes a bit more, right after the start of classes.
Saci continued, “It’s eating the school’s magic. Using it to attack Homunin.” He pointed at the field again. “It’s making everything dark, see?”
But no, he doubted anything would ever be alright after this.
Draco wasn’t sure the coolness of Potter’s tone was genuine acceptance or resignation over the fact that there were no answers for him. He let the subject drop.
Draco shoved a hand inside his robe pocket, groping around before finally feeling the cold, familiar metal press against his fingers. It was a little trinket he’d got from a second-hand shop in Muggle London. It had been one of the first times he braved this side of the city after he’d come back from his two-year masters in France.
The creatures glanced at each other before turning back to Draco. Caipora’s sigh was so deep her breath sounded like the wind singing in the crack of a window. It was creepy, more so because it happened during the day and not at night.
“The fruit. It looks like eyes. It’s a very Brazilian fruit, it makes the famous soda. Haven’t you tried it?”
Tai didn’t comment further on her reasoning behind avoiding the ritual. Draco wasn’t all that eager to talk about why he thought his didn’t work either.
As if understanding the sentence, the macaw nibbled at Draco’s hair and rubbed his head against Draco’s cheek.
What was happening was terror. A deep, frightening horror clawing under his skin, pulling him down, making everything dark in a place where only light should prevail.
“You bonded, right? Machado is your Eí now.”
“You know, his… ancient, prede—” she stopped herself mid-sentence, and Potter finished for her, “Ancestors.”
Potter didn’t laugh this time, but he was grinning from ear to ear when he crossed his arms. “Syryking,” he said, as if it was enough explanation.
Draco groaned in a way he’d feel very self-conscious about if he wasn’t so frustrated. “The bloody school is not very fond of the idea, and won’t let me read the interesting books.”
“Partially. At first, I believed the way the potion affected their brain was irreversible. However, some patients began regaining normal functions after a while without the influence of the substance, though most of them remained amnesiacs. Still, it’s important to pinpoint exactly what… Er, Potter?”
“Will you just calm down and rest for a bit?” Draco proposed, eyes closed and protected from the blinding veil of the sunlight, Machado lazily perched on his shoulder.
“Oh yeah,” she said matter-of-factly. “It can do many things. Like, feel when you need help or are hurt. Well, not you, obviously, or me.” She snorted. “‘Cause we’re not on the network.”
A sting of betrayal and abandonment shot through him. It was not the first time Potter left him to the wolves and it wouldn’t be the last, Draco convinced himself. Of course, if Draco was rational about things regarding Potter, he’d realise the truth for what it was: Potter was trying to help him. And Potter trusted these people to do the same and keep Draco safe.
. It needs zarkness. It feeds on zarkness and it was weak. Now it’s getting stronger.”
He looked like a boy, though Draco remembered what Francisca had told him about not mistaking Saci’s appearance for true age. Saci had rich black skin, short, thick hair, and was wearing a red dungaree that only covered his lower part. Saci had only one leg and despite Draco’s command for him to stop, he kept bouncing on this leg as if he couldn’t stop himself from fidgeting. Saci wasn’t attacking him, so Draco figured that was as close as he would get to being obeyed.
But the seed was still open, Draco realised, glancing down at his hand. It was open, and it was empty. And whatever had been hiding inside it had escaped.
Not that Draco knew anything for certain these days. He had long ago resigned himself to the uncanny truth about his own ignorance. He had been illiterate about Muggles, sticking to the bigoted truths his father diffused, even about magic. It made sense that he would be ignorant about Harry Potter, too.
Is that the friend you said was coming from London?
The hope that things would work out vanished from inside him at that moment—not that it was abundant, before. Draco knew what was happening, he knew, and he didn’t like it.
sexy, that his body hadn’t warmed up whenever Potter had attempted the feat after the war. Hell, that Draco hadn’t loved watching Potter doing it when they were twelve—not that he’d ever admit it.
It all sounded ominous somehow, and Draco decided it was best if he just remained silent. Maybe the boy, Curupira, wouldn’t even notice his presence.
His body laid bare on Harry’s mattress, sweat prickling his skin, glueing them together. Draco’s leg dangled on top of Harry’s thighs, head resting against his chest. He tried not to think about what that meant—because it meant something. Draco didn’t do casual, not after everything.
“And not for those who you,” Tainara pointed at the floor by Draco’s feet again, where he knew Berenice was trying to raise herself up. “Deem worthy.”
Draco prayed to all the gods that Potter didn’t notice the flush on his cheeks. Or that, if he did, he attributed it to the shock of being awoken by a wild beast, rather than the sight of Potter speaking to said beast. A
She roared a laugh, shaking her head. Draco mused that this trip could not get weirder.
“I am the prrrotector of the school and the forrrest, Drrragon, and I will not let you harrm any of it.”
The car was destroyed. It had almost completely melted to the ground. Its structure had turned into a metallic sludge, spoiling every patch of grass it touched. Had it been Harry’s magic’s fault?
“But it was not you,” Lua growled, hands in her hair. She turned to Caipora, who was shaking her head. “Ze fuck we do now?”
Was it something worse?
—rose to their feet at the same time. José positioned himself in Draco’s way, while Francisca laced an arm through Draco’s, preventing him from chasing Potter—not that it was something he did frequently.
“You are not,” she said after a long while. Her mouth moved with a bit of delay in the image, opposite from her voice. “You’ve been lost before, and you’ve been through worse before, Draco.”
Saci shrugged. “Ye shald give it back to me, anyway. It’s not like ye could open it, even if ye wanted. Ye’ll never open Boiuna’s seal.”
"Passar mal", means
Draco got up, fuming, as he averted his eyes from Potter. He pretended not to be satisfied at the flush in Potter’s cheeks and how his jaw worked as he surveyed Draco’s body—naked, but for his boxers—walking towards his trunk. “Are you sure it—
“I want you so much,” Harry said, straddling Draco’s thighs, fingers still on his arm. “I don’t want to hurt you. I want to be with you. I’ve always…” Harry inhaled deeply, eyes finally boring into Draco’s. “I
Draco was in no rush to do everything now—apart from finishing his research, of course, since people still depended on him. That Harry had drunk a variation of the Moriaetem Potion was enough incentive for Draco to decipher the potion as fast as he could.
too much and not to hate it all.
Potter chuckled. “And here I thought it would be harder to shut you up.”
The memory of their first encounter still stung a little. In a bitter way, though, because the second thing to know about Draco Malfoy was that he did
The wind that had brought Saci made Draco’s body tilt to the side. His fingers were fast to grab the trunk again, trying to keep his balance. The wood scratched his palms in an itchy, pungent way. He retched on the grass and smiled.
Harry was right about the robes. They were dirty now, exhibiting a small hole at the bottom, he noticed when climbing back in the car. Draco found he didn’t mind that too much now.
, he repeated inside his head as a mantra.
With his chest restrained, he tried getting up. The attempt was useless as the bulky mass on top of him pinned him down. Then it moved slightly.
. Somehow, Draco computed the exact moment the magic came out from the tip of his wand, purple energy crackling in the air, luring Jurupari to him.
“Yes.”
Potter’s laughter was filled with something Draco refused to acknowledge, but he followed the man regardless as he was dragged around the property.
Zé was kind enough to clarify. “It’s a spell to take you to another point in space. I think you have something similar in the UK.”
The silence became oppressive; it felt wrong.
No. Not wrong.
.” He lifted a hand, finger pointing at something over the edge of the forest, by the school borders, close to where they had landed. “Look.”
The sentence had tumbled out of his lips before Draco realised it was out, and Potter’s reply was truthful and charged with something Draco didn’t really want to look too deeply into. It didn’t matter that Potter still knew him. Draco tried to hide his embarrassment, busying himself with putting away the books that weren’t trying to attack him.
“Who else?” It was Caipora speaking now, and she was smiling.
Draco’s arms closed around Harry’s shoulders, pulling him closer, lips meeting again in a soft, almost chaste kiss. But Harry wasn’t finished.
They did that thing again, when they stared at each other because they didn’t want Draco knowing what they were thinking.
No. That wouldn’t happen. With or without Harry.
my fault, though. I was the one who messed around with what I didn’t understand.”
Francisca motioned her hand. It was a quick wandless spell, conjuring thick ropes that fell swiftly to her fingers. Draco had to mollify the jealousy at the blatant exhibition of power, glancing curiously at the object.
Draco opened his mouth, then closed it again. How did Potter know so much? How could Potter praise him so easily? Not that Draco was complaining. Not at all. It felt good to be the centre of his attention for once. Draco could get used to that again.
“Wait, you were actually rejected by the school?” Tai asked. “There was someone else like you, ya know!”
meant—it should come with no surprise that the school's Headteacher could be one as well.
To capture a Saci, one must throw a sieve at his wind swirl (what he uses to run around), then taking off his cap and trapping him in a bottle.
Saci was in front of him a minute later, face creased with worry.
Not home. Draco didn’t have one anymore.
“Harry!” Draco shouted, slamming the door open, running over every room in search of Harry.
It was easy to forget Potter existed while he was away and Draco was so busy with his work that he had no time for friends, for a life. Or when Martin kissed his lips as if Draco was the last man on Earth. It was easy to forget Harry when Draco didn’t have to face the crooked smile or green eyes when he woke up. Forgetting Potter was easy, Draco thought. Not loving him was almost impossible. It was almost the same as asking him not to breathe. He did it without thinking, without realising it was something he needed to survive, because it was normal and familiar. He kept this secret under his sleeve. It was a meager memento for whenever Draco dared to forget that he
?” Draco interrupted him, his astounded expression rapidly turning into a scowl. “What ritual?” He was positive he didn’t remember Longbottom talking about any ritual, but there was the matter of Draco getting constantly lost in his own thoughts or distracted about any conversation that didn’t revolve around him.
There were no students there, only two people who seemed old enough to be professors or in the staff of Castelobruxo. Relief washed over him.
Harry studied him for a second. “Why aren’t you wearing an engagement ring?”
Hey, Nanda, can you believe the tosser tried to braid Nazaré, too?
Draco was still wrapping his head around what she’d just told him as he was filled with the curiosity to know
And Draco did, because talking to Harry was easy. It was
Draco frowned. “That’s it? That’s all you’re going to say?”
and card games.”
He knew, then, what it was about the woman that bothered him. Her face reminded him way too much of his mother and her exact feelings about Draco and his escapade to the other side of the world.
Much like he used to do, Draco now pictured himself throwing a bunch of plates and mugs and glasses on the floor. By hand, even if his arm ended up sore and in pain by the end. It was a good kind of exhaustion, he’d learnt over the years.
Hiding how he felt now seemed irrelevant, though. Also, it turned out schooling his features was more difficult once he started speaking his mind. Draco had convinced himself that honesty was the right path to get people’s acceptance. Honesty also granted him a lot of animosity; these days, the only ones who didn’t flinch when he was less than pleasant were Pansy and—surprisingly—Longbottom. It happened an awful lot. Not that Draco saw people very often, apart from his mother, those two friends, and people at work—who weren’t really fond of his facetious comments.
He tutted, completely distracted from the notes he had brought with him, watching Potter effortlessly gather all attention back to him. It was an innate skill, Draco mused, that Potter didn’t seem to realise he had. It was unfair.
There, perched on the stone platform that had once held a living fire, was Tainara. She had a smirk plastered on her lips and a hand resting on Harry’s nape as he was kneeling on the floor.
Draco tried not to feel hurt by the clear distinction. The voice in the back of his head telling him he’d never be
means “inhabitant of”, resulting in “inhabitant of the forest”.
Oh, they need me.
), and sometimes the hunters give them cigarettes and alcohol to make them more compliant. Curupira is very curious, and the only way to escape his traps is to make a vine clew and hide the tip. He’ll be so distracted looking for it, the person will have time to escape.
It was not the fire that was alive, but the body to which the flames had claimed a hold. It was an actual person, but it was daunting all the same.
It was beautiful, yes. Yet there was nothing too special about its appearance.
Draco hummed, waiting for the rest, but when nothing else seemed forthcoming, he slid his eyes to José’s profile. He offered, after a beat, “He did mess up.” And
“Beautiful Imaeró transformed into Urutau, you know, the bird.” Draco didn’t know, but he nodded anyway. Tainara didn’t seem to notice, because she continued, and he let her voice wrap around him in the hazy blanket of his almost-nap. “Brown bird, has big, big mouth and is always crying like it’s very sad. It’s called ghost-bird or ‘Mother of Moon.’ Imaeró, transformed as Urutau, cries until this day, whenever she sees Tainá-Can and Denakê in the sky.”
He had not yet had the pleasure to meet this Lua everyone talked about at one point or another. The mystery woman was never at the dining room for meals, or the library, or any places Draco had free access to—which weren’t many. His curiosity was starting to niggle at him.
Draco could pretend all he wanted, but he was soon involved in Nazaré’s (the villain, not the snake) traps and ploys—she was a very good villain, and Draco tried not to feel bad about relating to her a bit.
were worth it. Draco was not giving him up, not after feeling so at peace by Harry’s side.
Potter took no time to answer, but his reply seemed somehow rehearsed, as if he’d given it tons of times already. “I wanted privacy. Also, to connect my house to the International Floo Network without having to depend on the school to talk to Teddy.”
“Doesn’t Potter give you any?”
He had never blamed Potter for it.
But it couldn’t be. This complete mess would have a logical explanation. It could be that dark power’s fault, it could be the creatures’ fault. Not Tainara’s.
almost tumbled out of his lips before Harry stiffened between his arms. Instead, Draco whispered, “What’s wrong?”
Draco blinked, trying to get used to the darkness falling upon them, cool and serene. Crickets sang, cicadas found their place back in the forest. He heard low growls and birds singing. But he knew whatever animals were around them, they were just as relieved as Draco was.
She had been misunderstood, and it had led her to do bad things. It was no excuse, of course. But Draco knew that restlessness and despair far too well not to relate to her on some level.
Saci laughed, then, hands dangling at his sides. “Ye see, that’s what happens when ye’re curious. The night escaped. The girl had to find a way to separate night from day.
Draco grinned, mouthing the man’s neck. “Not really. I’m glad we have this now.”
He thanked Francisca and drove himself home.
“Is that what this is?” Draco finally started again, softer, the feeling of being lost that had disappeared for a while settled back inside him. “I’m just visiting, and then I go away and they won’t think about me anymore?
Now Harry didn’t seem hurt at all, just confused, brows drawing together in a frown. “I didn’t disappear on you. I sent you a letter.”
Some teenagers had really taken the party too far, gathered by the corner of the Living Section where the light from the flowing spheres didn’t reach. Draco left Harry to handle his students and roamed around alone. Tainara was fast to find him again, lacing her arm through Draco’s and dragging him near to the bonfire to a dance he didn’t know the meaning of or how to perform.
The woman patted his shoulder twice, and Draco got up as she held a small mirror in front of him.
“What?!” Draco didn’t even care that his voice sounded like a shrill. It was becoming impossible to control his growing anxiety, and their silence did nothing for the churning in his guts.
So, he was taking his time to work out the courage to approach her.
life.”
Okay, so this is one of my favourite things about Brazil.
Potter’s gaze kept following Draco as he fished a robe, and let the silk slide over his body. Draco stepped in front of him, daft fingers tying a loose knot around his waist. When no more seemed forthcoming, he asked, “What would that be?”
Potter laughed, sprawled on the couch, hair still damp from his own shower, and wearing only a t-shirt and boxers—to which Draco decided against commenting.
“I’m so lost,” he said, throat dry, after talking for almost an hour non-stop, spilling his guts out in front of the hearth.
Draco closed his eyes, letting his face lean against Potter’s palms, still dizzy and too shaken to care about what that touch meant. “What happened?”
Machado was by his side again, guiding him through the woods while softly nibbling his ear. The bird seemed to have mellowed even more to him after Draco had named him, and now Machado didn’t leave his side anymore. After the proof of loyalty Draco had got—even if Machado did lure him to the woods by following Rudá’s orders in the first place—he couldn’t dismiss the bird any longer.
do it. Let me prove it to you.”
“Harry has been married to his job for years. And by that, I mean the forest.” José risked a glance at Draco, grinning.
Draco wasn’t sure that it should be called a car. It looked far too old and unstable for a task such as taking them places.
“Did you find out more about them?”
“It works like Apparition,” Potter supplied, seeing Draco was still stunned to silence. “You’ll be able to do it, once—”
The woman merely blinked. Hand raised, she cast a translucent green shield around them and it didn’t turn into darkness. “I understand your uneasiness. We’ve all miscalculated.”
Right. That wasn’t so bad. He could work with that. But what did it mean for him? For his research?
“I’m sorry, I’m
“You don’t have to help me. I’m sure researching isn’t your forte. I can do this on my own,” Draco said, undecided if he should stick to the excitement with knowledge at the tip of his fingers brewing inside him or his reservations about the school. It was getting tiring—resenting the new ways the school would find to reject him.
Draco sighed audibly. This was happening. This was really happening, and all of it was because of a pipe. “Thank you so much. Please, tell me what I should do. I’ll do anything. I promise I’m not here to cause any harm.”
, as Potter had put it with such rare eloquence.
inside the tucumã seed. Whereas Draco had the nagging suspicion it had been lurking around them before, Harry had been acting warily for weeks, even more so after their fight.
“Once I finish the ritual, I suppose?”
Did she have the slightest idea of how many mushroom species existed? “From the way Caipora talked, I don’t believe the school will have one lying around for me. Also, you and Caipora

Not that much.
as well,” he snorted, shaking his head. “You honestly think I’d do that on purpose? I didn’t
Green and wood were the best words to describe it. There was something minty in the air, distant, mixed with the fresh scent of wet grass and fur. A sweet aroma merged with something sour. It had rained recently.
“Wait, you really think this is my fault?” Draco’s indignation showed in voice, even if, in reality, he didn’t believe he had the right to feel like that.
Draco’s eyes darted around. Students gathered distantly from the line of the fire, crying copiously at the damage. The animals, covered in soot and ash, sought protection from the searing heat inside the school. The adults were trying to control the flames that just consumed, quenched,
José grinned at him. “Hope you guys can figure that out.”
Being with Harry, between his arms, in his care, filled Draco with the tentative certainty that everything would be alright. And Draco wanted to believe it and to make Harry feel the same way around him somehow.
The change had happened two years after the war, when he finished his masters in Potions Damage and returned to London. Living in France proved to be not only a great experience, but a respite from all the ‘Malfoy rules’ Draco had begun to ignore when his father wasn't watching anymore. Most of the Aurors who insisted on ‘casually’ stopping by his new flat in London didn’t seem to like his jabs about their uniforms and what exactly Draco thought of their constant unannounced visits. Not that he cared. Draco didn’t really bother with people who didn’t get his humour.
The most popular version of her in Brazil is that of walking and talking crocodile because of a TV show called "Sítio do Pica-pau Amarelo" that depicted many Brazilian tales.
Francisca must have thought his state was deplorable, though, for her strong features creased in a grimace as soon as she laid eyes on him. “Harry was just here looking for you, but he seemed to think you were at the library.” Draco frowned, but let it slide when the woman added, “I don’t know if I want to know what you were doing
“Potter, are they…” he started, but didn’t have time to finish.
Harry’s house.
Draco turned to her, index finger pressed against Berenice’s chest. “This is
Harry’s hair was shorter at the sides and back, but still as messy as a lion’s mane on top as it used to be. His skin had gained an even darker tan, and the bird tattoos he was cultivating close to his collarbone had now become two full sleeves of shapes and colours Draco couldn’t tell them apart for the life of him. Harry was still shorter than him, as expected, but his slim build had gained a more muscular shape, framed by dark jeans and a brown short-sleeved shirt. But even though his face had got older, and he was wearing frames more modern than Draco'd ever seen him using, those green eyes still shone as bright as the sun.
“Not all of them believe in it, of course. It’s an indigenous ritual,” Tainara continued, as they picked up two coconut cups filled with something dark and thick from a table in the corner, “but it became tradition here in the school.”
Three doors later, he stumbled upon a large study. A mahogany table stood by the window, accompanied by two upholstered armchairs in front of the hearth. Just like most of the other rooms, long panel windows covered the external walls from ceiling to floor. And where there were no windows, the walls were covered in shelves, spilling with hundreds of books. Draco smirked, perusing the stacks of tomes. Potter certainly had help in assembling that collection, he figured, smiling to himself.
. He didn’t.
Draco frowned. “What do you mean?”
“She wants to put down our defences… That’s why she needs the magic,” Draco heard Berenice’s weak voice beside him, and still didn’t look. “She’s going to destroy Homunin.”
“I’m a man!” Draco yelped, fighting the urge to hug his own torso. He would not give in to that strange insane figure.
Draco hoped it was true, at least.
But there was so much more to it that neither Neville nor the books had prepared him for. From just a glance, Draco felt life beating in each stone weaved into that construction.
Draco and Potter barely talked the rest of the day, both too lost in their own heads to acknowledge each other’s presence. Draco was still reeling from the way the Headteacher had dismissed him earlier. Tainara had accused her of being
“I am aware. And it can hear you. Homunin is very responsive. Try not to hurt its feelings, or it won't bode well for you.”
As if this was the sole problem.
Still frozen and pinned down in bed, Draco only shot a searing, wide-eyed glare at Potter. “Why is there a serpent in my bed, Potter?!”
Avoiding Harry at night—that were days, really—was an almost impossible task. Draco managed it by remaining in his room every evening after the incident, or just staying at school until late.
comes from curumim, “boy” or “child”, and
Draco’s knees faltered, and he fell, hitting the floor in a soft thud. His heart was beating so hard he could feel it in his throat. His palms gripped at the grass, grounding him to something palpable that was not trying to kill him. He took a deep breath, taking in the deafening
The promise could not be fulfilled, naturally, since the school didn’t agree with them about Draco seeing the restricted section.
“P-Potter,” he tried, voice raspy and low. “Harry… Stop. Stop it,” Draco got out, before his door slammed open. A blinding blue light came from the corridor, dissipating the shadows quickly.
obliged, imagining instead that he was grabbing his file from her hands and ripping it to shreds right in front of her. She had been right in the end. It had worked wonders and he was as calm and peaceful as a sloth by the end of the session.
“They’re here,” Tainara said, legs dangling from the branch where she sat.
“I really think I should open it.”
“Rrremember what I said, Drrragon Boy?” Caipora took over.
Draco raised an eyebrow, trying to meet Harry’s eyes, and finding it hard when Harry kept glancing at everything in the kitchen but him. “And how do you know that?”
“They’re not. I know them.”
He didn’t know this place, didn’t know its people and creatures. Draco did not know how to fix it, and had no devices to help him. He had to trust that this was for the best.
“That’s a terrifyingly accurate guess,” Draco mumbled, staring at the blur of the forest by his side.
excited, and his heart wasn’t tripping. It was just anger feeding him, burning his cheeks and setting his jaw taut.
“Be careful with him. Also, don’t believe the legends. He’s not attracted by a sieve nor captured by a bottle. Ripping the red hat from his head works, though,” she said, as if Draco would know some specific legend about a boy in the woods. No matter how many tales Tainara had told him, there were just too many for him to remember.
She shook her head. “It will—”
Draco
Harry choked, cheeks reddening. “You don’t really believe that,” he stuttered, baffled.
Let's pretend JK never shoved an Inca temple in the middle of Brazil and it all makes sense.
The wheels screeched loud enough to have him reeling, and they were thrown forward by the rebound. Draco grabbed the dashboard before his face could hit it.
Tai batted Potter's hand away, focusing solely on Draco. “Yeah. His name was Jurupari, he was indigenous, like me.” She kept talking, tumbling over her words, despite Draco’s stunned face and Potter’s apologetic smile. “According to legends, Homunin didn’t accept him and banished him from the land. It was centuries ago, you know. Some also say he was God of Darkness, or Demon of Dreams, so I don’t know how much of it is true. It was very sad and all, but I guess it’s not that bad if you’re still here.”
“The words you fucking use, Malfoy,” Potter chortled, but Draco didn’t stop.
?!” Draco snapped. “You were responsible for that girl and what she was doing! How—How could you not have noticed?”
But José rectified, “Messed up.”
(I purposefully left this bit for later, because of spoilers)
The look of genuine interest shot at Draco was almost enough to have him melting all over the carpet of the car. It wasn't fair that Potter still had that effect on him. That Potter was so fucking hot and friendly. It was, above all, not fair how Potter clearly remembered how much Draco loved talking about himself.
“You just like him because he riles me up.” Draco rolled his eyes, then turned to the macaw. “I should let Nazaré eat you.”
Draco wanted to return the gesture, but the weight on his shoulders seemed to have settled also on his face, making the corner of his lips constantly curved down.
“Patience, my love.” Draco grinned, nose shoved against Harry’s hair, hand resting on his nape. “I’ve got enough of your magic for a lifetime, and all the time in the world to hear you ranting at me for getting it wrong.”
How could Draco convince them he was good if they weren’t even willing to listen to him?
He cried, “Harry,
All those creatures had been playing Draco from the start, weren’t they? He was so full of it.
was becoming a mantra, until Draco finally found him.
Potter had always had his heart in the right place. The problem in having a relationship with him, though, had been in Harry’s lack of commitment skills.
Well, the good news for her was that Draco didn’t need her pity. He needed someone to help him open the damn tucumã seed.
“Actually,” she added, tying the rope firmly around Draco’s wrist, before doing the same to her own. “These clothes will not work, sorry. Excuse me.” Without a second thought, Francisca transfigured his robes to a simpler version of clothing.
Draco started bumping a fist into Saci’s knee. “Hey, have you heard? I have an Eí now…”
Draco took the offered hand with a roll of his eyes. “Ha-ha, you’re hilarious. Something hit me.” He took his hand back as soon as his feet touched the ground, fingers massaging the spot on his chest that had been hit.
wrong. How could he have thought he had a chance in that place? Draco believed he had really changed, that he was good now, that he deserved to feel happy, to feel something—
“It’s not sad, though.” Tainara shook her head so vehemently, her bushy hair almost whipped Draco’s face. “We don’t believe the dead would want us to behave in a sad or ugly way, so it’s a very joyous party.”

“He’s done that before.”
that smelled like it was rotting. He obviously didn’t say that, afraid he might offend someone with his opinions about the food, and wasn’t feeling adventurous enough to try it.
There was no flavour that he could distinguish apart from the strong tang of alcohol. The liquid burnt his throat all the way down, leaving Draco with a coughing fit for at least a minute, while Potter laughed humorously.
Draco ran, feet soaking in the wet mud, sweat dampening his skin. His breath ragged and cracked. He slowed down only after…
Harry was cold, so cold Draco could have thought he was dead. But no. He couldn’t be. Harry was breathing. Draco was sure of that. He checked again. His pulse was steady, despite how unresponsive he was.
“Oh. Not a jaguar?”
That was, after fixing the mess he had created and with no idea how to do that.
“If you say you’re sorry once again, I swear I’ll—”
“Hey, it’s okay. It’s no big deal, I swear.” Potter’s shrug carried the same placidity of his words. “It’s very light and absolutely reversible.”
Harry laughed. The movement made him groan in pain, and he held his stomach with one hand.
“Well, it took me Merlin knows how long running around in this labyrinth—I mean, forest, to find you. Common courtesy dictates that you hear me out?” Draco hated it sounded like a question, like a plea, but that was all his terrified body could manage. He’d take what he got, as only looking in her direction made his breath hitch.
That was what happened, right? The night was sucked into a coconut. It didn’t make a whole lot of sense, but Draco knew what he had seen. He knew and he couldn’t believe it.
Lua replied, body as stiff as stone. “
“Ha, funny.” Draco stood up, stretching his dormant limbs. “You’re not getting it. Rudá gave it to me, and I’m keeping the seed.”
“Don’t
Fuck his happy place.
going to fix it and prove to Harry, and Berenice, and the bloody school, that he could do it, and that he
Draco’s eyes went, immediately, to his forearm, to the mark hidden behind layers of heavy fabric. No, it couldn’t be that.
His robe got caught against a smaller branch sticking out from the base of the gameleira’s trunk, and he was about to curse all the gods when he heard Potter’s laughter. The git had, once again, offended his sense in fashion when they had left the house earlier. That time, though, Draco didn’t even have it in him to retort, as his loafers plunged in the wet grass, muddy because of the rain from the night before, and emerged ruined. Potter had said the rain had been the reason Nazaré went to Draco’s bed in the middle of the night. The snake had just been seeking heat. Draco had abstained from replying, even as the answer almost tumbled on the tip of his tongue—that it didn’t fucking explain why the snake chose Draco’s bed and not Potter’s. He was too proud to admit that Potter emanated heat like a furnace, as if he had a sun of his own.
Draco shrugged, poking the
and Potter, and how they always ended up destroying each other.
Potter. It was a teenager, speaking in riddles, trying to scare him away with some illusionary powers. Just that. “Yes, I am sure as hell.”
He was there. And being incensed by a damned clerk that looked too much like his mother.
Draco risked a look at him and regretted it instantly when he caught Potter’s grin.
Harry shifted in his chair. “You didn’t think about what you were doing, didn’t consider the consequences, and—You messed up everything, Draco.” His voice sounded strained, pained. “You were so selfish. My life was fine before you got here, and now… Everything is…”
His accent was different, his tone. Potter’s speech was slow, melodious and harmonic. It was a composition that Draco could no longer decipher.
I’m sorry.
?” Harry tried to turn his head, but Draco held him tighter.
Potter’s grin grew wider, and Draco tried very hard not to preen at himself for making Harry forget the pain from seconds before. “The sun is up very early here. You’ll get used to it soon. C’mon, you’ll love the breads I have.”
—after what seemed like hours and a lot of soreness on the soles of his feet. The trees had become thicker around him and the parrot, the canopy denser, protecting them from the worst of the heat even if the sun had already set by then. He tried not to worry too much about how much time had passed since he had begun his brief journey.
” The words caught in his throat, and he gulped. “Thank you so much. You won’t regret it.”
Draco considered asking him to be more specific, though he knew exactly what Harry was talking about. It did not seem like the time to test his mood, as Harry seemed to be so on edge this morning that he had a bit of a hard time remembering his own smile. Draco missed it.
Potter nudged his ribs, still staring at his student. “I don’t think he counts as an example, Tai.” He smiled, messing her hair and pulling back in an obvious attempt to terminate the conversation.
The thought that he’d have trouble sleeping in an unfamiliar environment proved to be in vain. That first night, exhaustion crept into Draco’s body and claimed him for a restful slumber as soon as his head hit the pillow.
Instead, he added, “So, am I the only one who was not accepted?”
It had to be.
It took Draco a moment to realise Potter was talking about the fire, as his own thoughts were not near that at all. He grinned weakly. “Yes. It’s just… I’m afraid of it. Fire. Since… you know.”
“One of many, I’m sure,” Berenice muttered under her breath.
before.”
“I missed you, your smell, the touch of your skin,” Harry’s words fell against Draco’s skin, warmth spreading from the mark, through his arm, to his chest.
Draco nodded, unworried about the girl’s rebellious tendencies. He had too much in his head to think hard about other people’s problems right now. “She also suggested I talk to a… Caipora?”
“I hurt you again,” Harry whinged, leaning into the touch.
Harry huffed in annoyance, but Draco soon felt the warmth of the other body next to him.
Draco rubbed a finger on his chin. It was a delightful story, and the fact the plant looked like an eye was enticing. The drawings around the text were very clear, but… “Is this fruit magical?”
Rudá started, “They’re not happy, you know, about you snooping around like that.”
Draco tamped down whatever instinct ordered him to track exactly what had hurt Harry and make them pay—it was not his place anymore. Maybe it had never been.
“Git.”
Harry had said sometimes dreams came to life in Homunin, but that was… That was beyond anything Draco had ever imagined.
He almost didn’t catch it, but once he did, he knew immediately what it was. The small fruit had the shape of an eye; white filled with a tinier black dot in the middle. It was small and hot, and full of magic. It was the magical guarana.
“Ye have to let the bad go, so the good can come in. Purge it all out now.”
“To infuriate the Carajá, the King Vulture told his secret in a whisper, thinking no one was there to listen. The Carajá couldn’t make out his words, but the birds and the trees did. That’s how they learned to remain young, renewing their feathers and leaves from time to time, as we, people, will never know this secret.” Harry finished in a whisper in Draco’s ear, his breath a hot puff against his skin.
“You did it, then?” Draco asked.
What…?
Potter. He kept repeating to himself over the years that Parseltongue was
. People rarely reacted well to his tainted past. But Draco was happy enough that she spoke English—even if with a thick and hardly understandable accent—to let the little piece of information fade into the back of his conscience. It changed nothing.
Working on a plan to fix his mistakes helped as well, since it would set a deadline for that torment. As soon as Draco worked everything out, he’d be able to go home and be away from all of that.
“I’m never drinking anything you offer me again, Potter. Be warned.”
He took a step forward, trying not to dwell on the fact that he was alone there, exposed to that growing darkness.
Draco looked.
“No, Potter, I haven’t seen the woman. I don’t go around fraternising with your Gryffindor friends or your exes for a hobby.”
people.”
And Draco did.
. It was like being home again when he hadn’t felt like that in a long time.
Draco was used to the hum of the city; loud neighbours and the constant honking of cars. The silence was oppressing, and he couldn’t really control his wandering mind when it got louder than what was around him. It had been a while since he had enjoyed his own company, since he had heard his own voice talking to him and not only pictured his
! It’s your fault!” He pushed the one-legged man, making him stumble back. There was no satisfaction in knowing that mess wasn’t entirely Draco’s doing. There couldn’t be when Harry was the one suffering.
“I like it better like this,” Francisca offered, shrugging. “Not that it wasn’t beautiful long, but you seemed like this steely figure. Now you look like someone… I don’t know, real. Approachable.”
Draco tilted his head back to give him better access, cursing the way his voice sounded so small, strangled. Fingers fidgeting and searching for contact, he reached for Harry’s hips with a bruising grip.
It didn’t matter. Draco was
To Draco’s surprise, the professor answered in English, interrupting his line of questioning. The strong accent, much more melodic and dragging than what Potter’s had transformed into, was still comprehensible, and Draco was grateful for that.
“Good boy.”
“They can use objects to channel their magic,” Potter added. “Some use twigs. Some feel more comfortable using personal belongings, like rings, or pens. Others can even use their animal companion to do magic and—”
Draco didn’t understand why he didn’t tell the truth. Why telling Potter what Berenice had told him felt like failure, like a conviction.
“Yes, you are. It gets better after the second shot. Don’t want you complaining about a hangover when we get up tomorrow, so we can try it again on the weekend.”
Harry shook his head, slowly. “Christ. I vouched for you, Draco. I tried to help you as much as I could!”
There
Tainara was just a girl.
They didn’t talk about that again that night, dropping the subject of Martin for something much more interesting: what Draco thought about Maria do Carmo, Nazaré and how the soap opera would end.
Draco grabbed Potter’s arm, all but ready to drag him to the Jeep. Once he realised what he was doing, though, he dropped it immediately. The heat of Potter’s skin burned Draco’s fingers like a warning he ought to take more seriously. Resigned and frustrated, he let his body fall inelegantly onto the hammock on Potter’s porch, watching as the fabric adapted to his shape and ignoring Potter’s intent gaze.
“Draco, wait!”
Draco assumed Tainara was talking about Headteacher Berenice, but didn’t comment further. He said, “Even if she does, the creatures will never forgive me now.”
She wasn’t alone, though.
it had been an accident. Harry was shaking, eyes wide, pressing his back against the counter as far from Draco as he could get. His magic was still alive around them, but not as hurtful anymore.
The seed wasn’t really a locket. But it opened.
His research, his trying to win the school over. It was all over. There was no turning back from this. Draco was even less welcomed here now. He had done it again. He had fucked everything up. And now he, Harry—and everyone else here—were paying for it.
Draco and Tainara were up in a second. Draco, because he was terribly afraid of fire since the Fiendfyre episode, and the mere word was enough to get the hair of his skin standing on end. He doubted Tainara had the same reservations.
