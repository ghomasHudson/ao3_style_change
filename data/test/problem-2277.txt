Draco shook his head but quickly said "I'd actually love a shower."
He let out a frustrated scream and apperated back to their resort.
When they finally approached the fireplaces, the majority of the Ministry's busy traffic had died down, seeing as most workers had gone home for the day. He grabbed some Floo powder, stepped in and yelled "Number 12 Grimmauld Place!" before disappearing in a rush of green flames.
Harry started blushing and sputtered for a second before saying “Well, not necessarily. Seeing as we're both unmated and our close proximity, it's likely we'll grow to be attached to each other. However, considering our past and all, I understand that it might be, well, hard to find a way to get over it all.” Draco remained silent so Harry went on. “I'm willing to put everything behind us, start new. As long as that's what you want.”
Harry stumbled through the fireplace in the living room of Number 12 Grimmauld Place before eagerly turning and waiting for a certain Omega to stumble in after him.
As I watch the sparks fly high
Harry shouldn't have done what he did next, but no one was there to stop him in this moment. He would later get scolded by Hermione for acting so impulsively. Stupid Gryffindor; act first, think second.
“That’s not true. And it’s not a valid reason. You can stand to be around him because you two were partners in potions for two years, not to mention you both got some of the highest marks out of everyone else by working together. And we did study with him a few times last year. Aside from our younger years, you never seemed to have much of a problem with him at school, especially last year. You two were ok last year. What happened, Harry?”
“How many people do you work with? What’re their names and ages?” Harry asked, grabbing a notepad and a pen.
“Who knows? People refuse to believe the truth because it’s easier.”
“Each cursed mail is three regular envelopes. Takes about the same amount of time to send off a cursed as it is for a couple regulars.”
It only made Draco turn away more, trying his best to hide his blush, and quietly said "I love reading."
“Let me finish and you’ll know.” Harry smirked. Draco sighed. “Yes, but, I want to love you… completely.” Harry finished.
“So,” Harry began, picking up a quill to fiddle with. “Are you an Omega?” Harry knew the answer, he just wanted to hear Draco confirm it.
“Yes, yes, it’s me. Have you seen Har-Potter?” Draco said, getting right to the point. He wasn’t interested in small talk with the redhead, knowing it would be a dull experience. And as for calling him Potter, he didn’t want Weasley to know anything suspicious was going on with him and Harry as he wasn’t sure if Harry told his friends about them, seeing the shock on Weasley’s face.
He hadn’t realized how lonely he’d gotten. After the war, Ginny and him decided to end things, simply because he had to find his mate (who, he realized after many failed attempts to reassure himself, wasn’t the redhead). Also Ginny was leaving London to travel with her professional Quidditch team she’d joined. Harry was truly happy for her, and felt bad that he didn’t reciprocate the feelings she strongly had for him. The best thing was to let her go, but that didn’t mean he didn’t need anyone. That’s where Draco came in and, although flipped his whole world around, brought him joy he hadn’t quite experienced before in his 18 years.
“Ok.”
Harry visibly relaxed and caught the message Draco was throwing at him. He smirked and asked “I think we've established that we're mates now,” Draco chuckled, “and, I'd really like to be with you. So, Draco Malfoy, would you like to be my mate-made-boyfriend?”
Clearly not in the mood to socialize, Draco left Harry alone and went to the kitchen to make himself some lunch. He’d heard the shower turn on, then off 10 minutes later. Harry never was one to take long showers.
“So, what happened?”
Footsteps, clicks, slam, more footsteps. “Draco? Is that you?”
“Hermione? Oh, dear. Is everything alright?” he crouched down beside her, rubbing her back soothingly. She nodded. She’d been sick a few times, judging by the look of her and the slight smell. “I’ll call for Ron.” he said, slightly panicked.
1 month earlier
“Bond with me.” Draco said.
This fic has had a title and rating change due to this chapter. It’s a little cringey and very sexual. I don’t even know, man.
“Harry,” Malfoy purred like before.
Harry shrugged. “It's nothing.” Then he thought for a minute and thought about his plans for the day. “Oh, also, Hermione is supposed to be coming over for a while after work, but that's not until 6. Just thought I'd let you know.”
When Harry finally caught his breath, it was then knocked out of him again as Draco tackled him into the sand. Draco kisses him hard and full, then. He kissed him passionately and lovingly.
As Harry entered the kitchen after showering and getting ready for the day, he saw Draco had made their breakfast of eggs and bacon. He felt his mouth water as he sat down beside his mate. He kissed his cheek and thanked him for the wonderful meal before digging into it. As he was shoving a forkful of eggs into his mouth, Draco slid the morning paper in front of him.
He continued to thrust slowly, deeply, so Draco could recuperate.
“Stay put, Malfoy.” Hermione said. He fell silent.
Now, however, Malfoy was here, and tormenting Harry he was. Well, not tormenting, necessarily, more so annoying him.
“Fuck, you’re so tight.”
“Why?” It was a simple question, one that probably anyone could’ve answered...except Harry.
“I came to apologize for my behaviour. I know that you’re just trying to help us, and I’m making everything more difficult. To be honest with you, I don’t know what’s happening; I can’t control anything. Not my moods, not even my magic. Once I lose control, it’s very difficult for me to gain it back again. I feel like I’m constantly fighting with myself, but barely, because I only lose control one side, the other I have no grasp on. So, I just wanted you to know that. And I’m sorry.”
“Mr Potter, it is a pleasure to see you again,” Miss Lovegood says in her airy voice. “I was afraid you would not come back.”
* * *
She walks towards the door, her eyes stinging. But she will not cry. Her days of shedding tears over him are long gone.
* * *
“No.” He sounds harsh, even to his ears.
Harry looks at Draco with a sad smile, then looks away. “You said the other night, that I’d be better off in Slytherin.”
“And that’s your problem, Harry.” Draco reaches out a hand, as if to brush his fingers against Harry’s jaw to feel the roughness, the texture of a past long settled in the dust of a war. His hand pauses midair, then lowers to his side. “You only ever thought about yourself.”
Harry takes a step closer, but Draco doesn’t back down. He looks at Harry with troubled grey eyes. “You don’t trust me anymore.”
Harry loves her for trying, for trying to heal him when he knows he never will, for loving him even when he will never love anyone like he loves Draco again, for shining a light when all he can see is darkness.
“Mr Potter, what can I assist you with today?”
Ron and Hermione are thrilled, of course, that they finally started officially dating. The whole school is abuzz with rumors of their new relationship, much to the dismay of Harry and the delight of Ginny.
When she’s alone, Hermione’s smile fades, and her mind returns to the memory, turning over every expression and every word she saw. Something wasn’t right in their argument, which at the time she had simply dismissed, writing it down to their boyhood rivalry.
Draco falls.
“Don’t be sorry, my love. She’s leaving both of us.”
then I choose my family. I choose my family every fucking time.”
“Mr Potter, if I may have a word,” Mrs Weasley says, waving off her son and Miss Granger when they realize that Harry has been detained. “Privately, please.”
“I suppose so,” Weasely mumbles, clearly not satisfied. Miss Granger blushes profusely. Harry looks away. He does not understand why they tiptoe so much around the obvious.
“Malfoy can speak for himself,” Harry says softly. Malfoy looks up at Harry, betrayed, like Harry had slapped him. He turns swiftly on his heel, leaving the room.
Then he Apparates without another word, leaving Draco dizzy like his whole world has flipped—but instead of upside down, it’s as if everything around him is finally rightside up.
“It does,” Draco says tersely.
But Hermione is not in the memory, and she notices.
“Oh god,” Harry groans.
Draco discovered the answers to a million questions he didn't know he had. Each kiss made sense, each touch a fact. Had Draco not known all this time?
Pansy shakes above him, bringing Harry back to the present. He grabs her by the waist, pulling her down, closer, sliding his tongue fully inside of her, then reaching with his finger and caressing her clit. He can barely focus, though, stars bursting behind his eyelids as Draco sinks himself lower, increasing his pace, rocking their bodies to one rhythm. Pansy guides his hand with her own, faster and faster and faster, just like Draco riding his cock, building intensity, their bodies glistening with sweat, the symphony of erotic sounds cascading around him like fireworks.
“Would you still have protected me if I was in Slytherin?” Harry glances at the Sorting Hat, perched on a high shelf on the far wall, but it stays silent.
Divination with Professor Trewlaney, highly selective
“I don’t understand. I thought we agreed…”
“What are these?” Harry asks, brushing his fingertips over the maps, the paper thin and almost translucent. Must be very old, and very valuable.
They do not all always get along well. Though Draco and Hermione had long since made amends, he could scarcely look her in the eyes, and they avoided each other’s company alone. Ron always deferred to Hermione, but occasionally he was able to joke around with Draco, though most of the time they were merely cordial.
* * *
curse on Katie Bell and Harry letting it happen, Harry has been trying to understand the nature of this task the Dark Lord ordered him to complete. But Draco never tells him anything, asking Harry to trust him instead.
Beside him, Draco adjusted himself in the bed, pulling the covers up over his chest. Harry stared at the ceiling, the peeling green wallpaper. He realized he was holding his breath, and tried to release it slowly.
Draco walked through the cliques and crowds of teenagers milling about the common room, left the dungeon, and rounded the same corner as Harry. He kept walking past the Great Hall, where a door just up ahead closed quietly.
“And what? You’re starting to doubt that decision?” Harry asked, and his voice betrayed him by trembling ever so slightly.
Harry gets up, his chair scraping behind him.
love with her. You never were. I actually always wondered why you two dated for so long.”
Harry was speechless, so Draco crawled towards him and kissed him, one hand palming the front of Harry’s jeans.
He recalls, unwillingly, the night on the Astronomy Tower, frozen under the Cloak, unable to do anything, unable to look away, forced to watch Draco, sweet, witty, loving Draco, point a wand at his father. And then Snape killed him.
“Yes, Harry! I am. Is that so hard to believe? Is it such a crime? That I want something more than this? That I want to love you openly and to stop hiding myself for you?”
Longbottom smiles proudly, as if personally pleased that Harry has addressed him, then sits. “Very well, thank you. It is very gracious of the Headmistress to allow us another year at Hogwarts, is it not?”
“Good morning,” Harry says, passing a mug of steaming coffee over to Draco, who takes it gratefully. “Sleep well?”
Just then, Harry raises his hand. Hermione pauses, along with younger Hermione, who frowns and stops taking notes.
Or doing something very different, which Draco does not want to think about. Draco slips his wand away.
“Harry, promise me. Promise me if everything goes to hell you won’t go there too. Promise me you’ll find me first and you’ll lean on me for as long as you need.” She looks into his eyes urgently, and he averts his gaze. “Promise me.” Her voice shakes.
“So what are you going to do now?” Hermione asked, wanting the rest of the story. They continued to fill them in, making sure to leave out their conversation from lunch.
“What, Potter,” he spat irritably.
When he went in, he didn’t see Potter anywhere, even though they specifically said to meet up here half past six.
He was so excited too. He was excited to marry Harry, to call him his and to just be with him. He just wanted to show the boy love because he was never able to do that before. Draco vowed to always be there for Harry, through anything and everything, thick and thin, even if they were fighting.
Draco sighed. He obviously knew that he hadn’t given Harry a love potion, and Harry clearly wasn’t obsessing over him like one normally would when under the influence, so Draco had no choice but to believe them.
Harry needed to talk to Hermione. She'd know what to do about his recent development of feelings for a certain blond Omega. She knew he was an unmated Alpha, not only with overly protective traits, but also sensitive magic. He was just a mess.
Damn, it's been a really long time. Sorry about that guys. First part of this story is done though! I WILL be continuing with this story, so don't worry. I've been trying to figure out how to write this chapter and this is the best thing I've come up with so far. I'd love for you to review and give me some ideas/things you want me to incorporate in this series. Thank you :)
“Accio Draco.”
“Yeah, right now.” Harry was already breathless.
“They’re ready for you soon.” A man Harry had seen running around the building during wedding preparations but didn’t bother learning his name, announced as he peaked into the room.
“You’re going to make me cry again.” Draco smiled.
“Take them off,” Draco says, casually gesturing to Harry’s briefs. Harry slides them off in relief, his cock glistening red in the glow of the coals. He pushes Harry back against the couch, and Harry complies silently, lying back, his heart beating sporadically as Draco quickly slips out of his remaining clothes.
Except he has, and his fingers skate below Draco’s belt. Draco gasps into a kiss, then he breaks off, and with glazed eyes, heavy eyes, which do not really see Harry, only feel him, Draco tugs at the hem of Harry’s sweater.
“That’s because no one knows me,” Harry interrupts angrily. “They think they love me but they don’t know the evil in me. The horrible things I have done. They just see a Savior, when I died to find a better world. I didn’t want to save them, just myself. I’m selfish.”
“Why?” Weasley looks surprised, then realizes and frowns. “No, you should not believe that. Your magic will right itself in no time. It just needs a little practice, that is all. We will both be accepted, I am sure. Professor McGonagall could not do otherwise with heroes of the war.”
She just has to figure out why.
She just knew.
It felt like they were falling apart.
Only then did Draco have the strength to get up and walk out, his hands reaching up to untie the blindfold.
“Will you have enough room?” Harry asks, looking around the small square space and minimalist design.
“Explain?
“Why not?”
But not this short.
Harry nodded, then remembered the dark. “Yes.”
Their faces are inches apart. Harry’s breaths turn shallow.
“Would you like to kiss her?” Draco asked, looking at Harry intently.
Hermione sits up. “Oh, right! How could I forget that? Honestly, Harry, I might just fail this exam, I mean a simple
“Do you not want to see me?” Harry asks.
She walks over to him before she changes her mind.
“We weren’t really fighting,” Harry says, frowning.
“The night I died, I saw a place, perhaps all in my head though no less real for it, a place all white and pure, where you can choose to go on, or stay. I chose to stay, but I did glimpse the beyond before I left, and I saw them all. My parents, Fred, Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and so many more, they were all together, all smiling, all happy. I took comfort knowing somewhere, in an other world, our fallen family and friends are happy and in peace. I hope it gives you comfort today, too, and every year hence, as we never truly forget, and never truly heal without them.”
“The party…”
The Muggle station falls away and reveals Platform 9¾, the black and red Hogwarts Express gleaming in all of its glory, with steam puffing from the engine as it prepares to depart.
“But what if I have nothing good to give?”
those very differences, in order that we may learn from each other, that we honor the legacy of this school, and its founders.
Distantly, the sound of people counting down reached Draco's ears. Their time was almost up. His whole body was both numb and the most alive it has ever felt.
Another silence ensues, in which both of them look anywhere else except at each other. Finally Draco sighs, running a hand through his disheveled hair.
Rain beats a steady rhythm against the stained glass windows in the dormitory. Harry adjusts the blankets on his bed, pulling them up around his waist. Already the chill of winter creeps into the castle during the night, and Harry shivers.
Apparently Harry’s lack of a response is answer enough for Draco, who nods slowly, as if expecting it. He smiles, but it feels false, and Harry wonders how everything good always slips so easily through his fingers, like trying to grasp the wind.
The shame palpitates with each breath. Harry fears speaking, that he might choke on his words.
“That’ll only give you a better reach.”
“Well,” Ron starts, but can’t finish, though he doesn’t have a good refutation anyway, as Hermione and Ginny walk into the common room arm in arm. Harry smiles sympathetically at Ron before rising and hugging Hermione, then kissing Ginny on the cheek and whispering something in her ear that makes her laugh.
am in charge. While I had a hand in procuring those very invitations, I was sworn to secrecy,” Mr Weasley says, smiling.
Then he leaves the dorm.
* * *
Harry twists out of the way, and the spell skitters like a monstrous spider across the floor, ripping apart the tile. He counters with a Bat Bogey Hex, which Draco dodges.
“Wake up, Harry,” Draco whispers, straining his ears to make sure no one else is walking around. Harry groans loudly, then buries himself under the covers, wrapping his strong arms around Draco.
Suddenly Harry is very alert, looking at Ginny in alarm. “No. Why do you ask?”
Something in her eyes when she said that reminded Hermione of something, but for the rest of the day she had trouble remembering what. But she remembers now, and it doesn’t make sense.
“All this time?” Pansy repeats faintly. After briefly closing her eyes, she takes a deep breath, and screams,
“Blessed,” Ginny finishes quietly, her mind which has always been a whirlwind of chaos has settled like dust floating down to the ground. “I know. Thank you. And Luna, it means—”
“No!” Draco exclaims, throwing his hands around Harry’s neck, as if that could somehow stop him. “Pansy will be sleeping. I can’t wake her, I promised.”
“I love you, Harry. I’ve moved on, but I will never stop loving you. And Ron and Hermione love you. And Mum and Dad love you. And Dumbledore loved you. So many people in your life, Harry, and yet you stand here like you’re all alone.” Ginny shakes her head, already turning away. Sometimes, the best thing—the only thing—is to walk away.
Harry looks at the platform wall. His stomach dips nervously as he realizes this will definitely be the last time he walks through the wall as a student. It makes him nostalgic for the last time he walked through this wall, blissfully unaware that he might never do so again, just happy to be returning home.
“Sleeping Draught,” Harry says quietly. He pulls his hand back, and turns to Draco. “But I’m afraid to take any more. You see, I was quite dependent during school, and I haven’t touched a drop since.”
“I wanted to see you,” Harry says, smirking. He lies down beside Draco, and Draco puts down his textbook, having forgotten about it completely. Harry lifts the side of the covers and slides underneath, his pajama covered legs finding Draco’s and curling around them possessively. “You’re so warm.”
He jumps onto the Third Floor landing with his lungs burning, but he doesn’t pause, instead sprinting down the hall and around the corner to where Draco was just minutes ago. He raises his wand and casts a brighter Lumos, looking around.
Harry already knew Draco’s morning routine, his quick, steaming shower, the short review of homework and test material in his bath robes, and then pulling on his outfit for the day (picked the night before).
Draco’s cheeks burn. “She’s just a friend.”
Whoever compared love to butterflies or warmth had obviously felt nothing of the sort. Draco had known for a long time that love had more to do with dread and nausea than any fluttery, flimsy feeling. Merlin, Draco thought he might throw up.
“But you don’t need it?” Harry finishes for him, smirking. “Snape is a two-faced liar, trust me, I know, so he probably doesn’t want to help you anyway.”
Harry shrugs. His body feels laden down, as if he were underwater, and his skin is hot and flushed. Summer has just come to an end and the days are still unbearably humid. Draco watches him steadily, then reaches out and jostles his shoulder.
“As we stand here today, and over the course of the next year, we all have a choice, as the late Professor Dumbledore always said, to choose what is right, or what is easy. As the eldest year, you lead by example, and as honored heroes of the war, the responsibility is, to say the least, significant. While you are all here first and foremost for an education, I must remind each and every one of you that this class year represents something much greater, a symbol of unity after years of destruction and fragmentation.
She studies Draco again, noticing now the dark circles under his eyes, how limply his blonde hair falls over his forehead, and the rumpled uniform that Hermione has discovered only recently would be uncharacteristic of him.
Hermione carefully watches Harry as he looks at Ginny hold Dean’s hand, but he doesn’t say anything or express any annoyance or hurt. Ron and Hermione share a look, then blush, the awkwardness from the pub last Hogsmeade trip still on both their minds.
“Oh.” Pansy deflates a little, then that familiar worry clenches at her stomach. Why is Hermione interested in Draco? Has something happened at the Ministry? Did Hermione find out he was illegally brewing Potter that potion?
He swivels around. It’s Pansy, his best friend, black lipstick stark against her pale face, the same color as her short black hair, the edges devastatingly sharp. She has a dark green scarf around her neck, and an inky black cloak bellowing around her, flowing just below the ankles of her boots.
Vaguely, in some part of his mind, Harry knows his parents will be coming home soon. But if this affects him at all, it only serves to heighten his senses, each touch branding, Draco’s mouth moving against his, dizzying.
Harry looks at the list disdainfully. He decides that if he cannot manage Potions, he would be dismal in Alchemy. He is not quite sure what Arithmancy is, but if it is anything like Mathematics in Muggle education, then he is better off avoiding it. Ancient Runes sounds interesting, but Harry remembers from Miss Granger that the workload was quite intense. That leaves French, Wandlore, and Healing.
“But what did the potion do, professor,”  Harry asks earnestly, as if he had not heard that people had died from it.
“What were you expecting?” Harry asks, in such a casual, innocently curious way that for a moment Draco is fooled that he hadn’t picked up on Draco’s meaning.
“Do you trust me?” Harry asks, holding out a hand. Draco’s gaze flickers from the outstretched hand and back to Harry’s eyes. His light grey eyes darken as if shadowed, and he swallows uneasily. Harry follows the movement of his pale, gleaming throat.
* * *
“Professor McGonagall will be teaching Transfigurations even as Headmistress?” Weasley asks doubtfully.
several times, until finally succeeding with one last swing of his wand to stop the light and returning the room to darkness. He breathes hard. There is a long silence on the other side of the curtains.
“Please, Harry,” Draco whispers, hoarse. He turns his body, face down on the bed. He looks at Harry looking at him, taking in his pale skin, his long limbs, open, wanting, and Draco flushes, seeing himself through Harry’s eyes.
“You used to call me Harry.” It’s just an observation, but Draco’s eyes flash.
"Yes."
And he dreams a very familiar dream.
“You’re beautiful,” Harry says.
But Draco wonders if their love is really
Lucy wags her finger at him. “Back again, Harry dear?”
But Pansy awakens something in him, something else, something different. They all know it. So they like to play this game, where Pansy watches them. Harry can barely stand it, having no patience. He must sit there and take whatever Draco is willing to give. His body strains, his hips lift up, yearning, but Draco pulls back, waiting for Harry to breathe, and settle back down. If Harry’s hand strays too far and too close, Draco will move it away, or take his wrists and hold them at his sides.
Pansy could think of a million and one reasons off the top of her head, but scanning Draco’s face she quickly deduces he wouldn’t understand any of them. So instead she shrugs, saying, “I guess you’re right.”
Ginny rolls her eyes, but swings her legs down, feet planting on the floor. Luna smiles pleasantly after Madam Pince as if she had greeted them with a good morning instead of a stern reprimand.
“What a coincidence,” Harry replies, equally as cool and collected. They stare at each other, unmoving and silent, before Harry speaks again. “I’m actually in need of a potion that I understand you can make.”
Harry laughs despite the conversation. “I can’t do that. And you’re very drunk.”
“Harry.”
Draco doesn’t know what to say. A part of him warms at the thought that out of everyone, he’s the only person to really see Harry beyond his fame and his aloofness. But another, smaller part within Draco shies away at what he does see in the depths of Harry’s eyes, that prowling, slithering darkness within which chills him to the bone.
“It doesn’t work like that,” Draco says, and he has his wand out protectively, feet set in a dueling stance. “Put down your wand, Harry.”
Wandlore with Mr Ollivander
“I don’t think you are,” Draco says quietly, almost resigned, before stepping out into the hallway. He turns to Harry, who stands paralyzed in the alcove. “Run,” he whispers harshly. Harry doesn’t need to be told twice; he turns the corner and runs, leaving Draco behind.
“Off to see Weasley?” she asks.
Then he’s just as guilty of murdering his father as Draco will be.
The doors swing open on level four.
“But maybe you should!” Pansy sits forward, eyes gleaming, scheming. “People respect you, even if they fear you or hate you, because of who you are.”
girls, with Draco being the first, of course. It had happened by accident, one of the first nights she spent with Blaise, when she had realized he might be the best person she knew. Pansy could sense her love for Blaise settling on her like a second skin, and so out of fear she blurted out the only thing that might scare Blaise away.
Of course, it is not always that simple.
When they disappear upstairs, Harry feels Draco’s hand resting right beside his thigh. He bites his lip, ignoring him, but it’s no use, the memory like a delicate breath on the nape of his neck.
“Yes, it was, wasn’t it,” Hermione says softly, and Draco realizes a second too late where this conversation has stumbled into. He stands frozen, unable to move, not even to speak. “You know, I was almost sad to hear they ended. I suppose the war had an effect on Slytherins that most people could scarcely imagine. Sometimes, though, I wonder if Pansy saw him all these years later, if they would find their way to each other. It sounds like something out of a book, doesn’t it?”
He quickly writes his response, tying his letter to Pig’s claw, who excitedly flies out of the window and disappears into the blue sky.
“So…?”
“He’s saying...that Harry and Draco have been secretly together...all this time.”
“Leave it up to Harry to have a second chance and still fuck things up,” Ron mutters.
Pansy and Draco laugh. Harry rolls his eyes, but he can’t hold back a smile. A flood of warmth washes away all the doubt and shame, and everything they don’t understand about each other and themselves, settling deep in his chest like the setting sun.
“No!” Harry backs away violently, shaking his head. “Draco, this is bad. This is bad. You’ll regret it tomorrow, I know it.”
explain? No, sir,
Ginny hadn’t meant to follow him, not really. But when she saw them, she knew.
Draco grins, clearly relieved to be changing the subject. He wraps an arm around Pansy, an uncharacteristically affectionate gesture, probably one he picked up from Harry. “Unfortunately, those subjects are not taught at Hogwarts, though I’m sure if you tried hard enough Snape would raise your grade by a letter.”
Harry breathes in sharply. “Merlin, Draco.” He starts to move them towards the stairs, but once they get to the first step, Draco sinks to the ground with all of his weight, pulling Harry onto his lap and kissing him hungrily, his mouth the sweet taste of tequila. Harry knows he should pull away but Draco’s mouth opens so wet and wanting, and all Harry has to do is slip his hand down—
Pansy shakes her head, then hesitates. “Yes, but not like I love you. I love both of you. I need both of you. But I also know it’s not love, not really, that it’s something else.” She sighs. “It’s complicated.”
Oh no. Harry knows before he hears it that Draco has stormed off, in the direction that Harry’s hiding. Snape stalks away in the opposite direction, and Harry takes advantage of this and grabs Draco by the shoulders when he passes his hiding spot, dragging them both into a nearby alcove.
How many times will Draco cut himself on that smile before he decides to heal?
“No, please, come in. I was just looking over a memory,” Hermione says, motioning for Draco to come forward. He places the parcel on her desk, and with a wave of his wand, it unrolls.
“He chose his family, Harry,” Hermione says, and she feels so sad that Harry could get things so wrong. “You both had an impossible choice to make, which really means you had no choice at all.”
“Oh all right.” She opens the seals. “This one is for you, Ron. ‘Dear Mr Ron B. Weasley, we are pleased to extend an invitation for your Eighth Year at Hogwarts. Please find enclosed a list of available courses for Eighth Years and their necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September first. We await your owl by no later than July thirty-first. Please reply with your chosen courses.’ Goodness me, it is already the twenty-third! What do they mean by this!”
late at night. The end of the cigarette catches, and he flicks the lighter off, putting it away. He’s left in darkness.
it had never been explored, that makes Hermione pause and wonder. How much had the war taken away? Did only people die, or did experiences die as well?
“Not that we know of, at least,” Hermione amends. “But he hasn’t left the flat in five days. Rarely leaves his bed to answer our fire calls. We tried to come over and find out what’s wrong, but he was always either asleep or drunk.”
“Yes, champagne pink. It’s a very specific pink, mind you.” Pansy crosses her arms, daring Hermione to question her judgement. But Hermione only lifts her chin slightly, then walks back into the dressing room.
The kettle begins to whistle.
“It’s about Harry. It’s always been about Harry,” Draco says seriously.
Harry groans in response, and it sounds a lot like
“Not that, idiot.” Ginny playfully shoves his arm. “Like, as friends.”
“I….come in...please.” Hermione sounds desperate, but from what Draco can see from his place on the couch, Pansy holds the door firmly halfway closed, with herself blocking the entry. He feels a rush of relief that his best friend knows that despite his lack of tears, he could absolutely not handle a visitor. Especially Hermione Granger.
“You’re not wandering around the castle at night, are you?”
Draco pulls back, suspicious. “Ginny?”
Harry smirks. “Come and get it.” Draco lunges, and Harry darts around him, but he realizes his mistake too late. He walks backwards towards the far end of the restroom as Draco corners him into the back wall, right next to the last stall. When Harry tries to make a run for it, Draco uses his wider wingspan to block Harry from escaping.
“No.”
Harry can almost hear his voice, asking
“Just be careful, Harry. I don’t want you to get hurt. I don’t want anyone to get hurt.”
When they pass by, Pansy sees Harry smirk at Draco, just a slight, insignificant movement of the corner of his mouth. Beside her Draco smiles a very small, intimate smile; the kind of smile passed only between lovers, like a secret message, a promise, even a kiss.
“Why not?” He sounds broken, but that’s not fair, because
“Sometimes,” Hermione says, shaking her head and sighing, a combination of gestures that is commonly performed in reaction to anything Harry Potter, “I want to strangle him.”
“Have you done this before?” he asks, though it pains him to.
“Really?” Luna wonders. “It always felt inevitable.”
“Harry?” a voice calls out from far away. Harry jerks back, breathless. He doesn’t look at Draco, his face dark and storming.
“I suppose if you are happy, my dear, that is all that matters,” Mrs Weasley says, though looking quite confused, as not even Percy had wanted to take more classes. “And you, Mr Potter?”
Suddenly the curtains are yanked to the side, and Blaise stands at the end in all his glory, shrewdly searching the bed. The light filtering in through the lake shines a halo around Blaise’s smooth, glowing skin.
“Well thank Merlin I’m a wizard.” Malfoy gazed at him under lowered eyelids. “Suppose I might’ve been better off a muggle.” Malfoy eyes his cigarette thoughtfully.
When the afternoon rolled around and the initial noontime sun had cooled a little, Harry decided to go for a swim.
“Took you two long enough.” said Ron, beaming when Hermione went to sit beside him.
Damn right, Draco thought. But he stayed silent, waiting for Harry to finish.
He only nodded.
Harry smiled and kissed his cheek before removing Draco from his embrace and exiting the kitchen, not wanting to distract the blond from his thoughts any further.
He started to get frustrated over this stupid kiss. So what?! It was just a kiss? It's not like it was his first. Even though it was from an Omega, his mind unhelpfully added.
“What do you think, Hermione? He ran away! Right, Harry?” Ron inquired.
After a long time of them holding onto each other, Harry slowly started to rub soothing circles all down Draco's back in hopes to calm him. It did, so he decided to break the silence. “Draco?”
“Fuck! Ow, Malfoy. The hell was that for, you wanker.” Potter exclaimed, rubbing his stubbly jaw.
“Stop!” Harry shouted. He came out from behind Hermione to face Malfoy.
Holy shit he was in Harry Potters house, living with him for Merlin knows how long. Then it dawned on him that he'd eventually have to come to figure out his own living arrangements. That thought pushed him over the edge and he drifted off into a peaceful sleep.
“Merlin, Harry, you could’ve just said so.” Draco was still giggling.
Diana, a recent recruit of his team, gladly took on the next appointment. Draco, in the meantime, tidied his station, returned some cash to the receptionists desk, then wiped his hands clean on a towel as he made his way to Potter.
“Professor, please.” Harry said. Why, he really didn’t know. He should’ve just escaped into the room like Snape was so clearly giving him the opportunity to do. “I’ll just take him, he’ll stay calm with me. I know you wouldn’t want him disrupting your lessons. I don’t want him to get even more fussy.”
Minutes later, Harry’s mind was still reeling. Everything just happened so fast (as it usually did with them). He asked Draco “What was that?”
“Uh, yeah, it came up. She was pretty determined to get it out of me that I want to be a healer. Even talked to Pomfrey about it.” He said with a shrug.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ron,” Draco says quietly. “His name is Ron.”
“Go away, Draco.”
The painting swings inward, revealing a dark tunnel. He ducks inside and meanders below the castle until he finds the kitchens, a room with a low ceiling and a large, hot furnace, low counter tops that take up the middle of the room, and shelves along the wall packed with sacks of flour and sugar and salt, jars of different jams and preservatives, and encased behind glass that must be enchanted cold a variety of salted meats and fish.
“Not funny,” Harry says wryly, setting his glass down and walking around the counter.
“We just thought,” Ron mentions awkwardly, “that maybe you didn’t know.”
“You’re just paranoid,” Draco dismisses, but he sounds a little less confident and a lot more desperate for it to be true. Pansy knows the feeling well, so she tries to sympathize.
But nothing ever came of it. Harry would never ask him out. His friends encouraged him to make the first move, but Harry refused. Harry might like Draco, but there was no way Draco liked Harry. He was a Gryffindor, Draco was a Slytherin. It was impossible.
The blond was practically insisting he sit on Harry’s lap, kissing and licking his neck in their spot at the back of the class. Harry normally sat middle to back, wanting to see and hear the lessons, but not draw attention to himself. Now, he really didn't want to draw attention to himself and his...nuisance.
“Oh yeah, baby?”
Draco just positively melted against Harry. He was very nervous about this whole thing, mainly about Harry's reaction. If he'd asked why Draco always pulled away before things could escalate between them, why they never discussed this before, why Draco wanted to discuss it now…
“If you do anything to anger the prophecy, even a long time from now, it may act up again. Say you have to travel away from each other, even if it’s for work or something, and you aren’t intending on leaving each other permanently, the prophecy won’t know the difference and it will cause pain, possibly to both of you, regardless of your feelings for each other. If you have an argument, even a long time from now, you will feel pain. It’s a horrible thing to have to deal with, one should be able to live freely, but alas, that is the fate of being bound to a prophecy.”
“Forever with you.” Draco repeated, their lips almost touching.
The intense feeling of Harry coming around his cock, ripped Draco’s orgasm from him, shooting deep within his husband.
“Those are sent from the sender to the recipient through the Ministry halls. We never get memos down here, it’s against policy.”
He heard the padding of feet and honestly expected the bed to dip a little bit on the opposite side of him, but it didn’t. Harry went to sleep on the couch.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief. “No, thank you. I’m sure everything will calm down now. Thanks again, Kingsley. I really appreciate this.”
Their lips met in a soft kiss, hands gently roaming, bodies pushed up against each other.
Harry shook his head. “That's not necessary. You can stay. And you can come in whenever you like. I noticed that you haven’t really been in here before today, but you live here too now. And I spend most of my time in here so I’d like for you to keep me company.” Harry smiled, untying the letter from the owl’s leg and grabbing a quill from nearby.
I know, because he said I have the same look.
Kingsley nodded and smiled. “Yes, of course. Anything for you, Harry. Oh, I forgot to mention, there’s a charity event being held for St. Mungos’ children ward tomorrow night. I’ve been asked to invite you, I hope you and Draco can attend.”
Draco’s head whipped around so fast, he was surprised it stayed on.
Harry just gave him a 'Really?' look before saying “No. The blanket is not making you sneeze. You have a cold, and you refuse to acknowledge it. It's only going to get worse, you know.” He said as Draco slipped from his lap.
The room(s) were decorated in dark green and black furniture, much like the Slytherin common room, from what Harry could remember from 2nd year. Lavish pieces and expensive trinkets littered every surface, but not making it look cluttered. The furniture looked rich and soft, probably made from the best materials that existed.
“I… I promised Ron and Hermione that I’d try to be nice and get to know you. Everyone kept saying that you’re not the same as you were in school, and I know that. But, I’m still the same. It hasn’t quite processed yet that we’re going to be together for the rest of our lives, so I’m dealing with it the only way I know how. I just need a little time to get used to this.”
“Mmm, Harry…” Malfoy practically purred.
“Even too busy for me?” Draco asked lightly.
"Really? Oh Hermione you're the best! When can you come?"
“Yeah, he did. Out of nowhere, really.” Draco hadn’t revealed what had happened to Harry, just that he was taken to the hospital and that they needed to meet him there ASAP.
Harry smiled gratefully and left the office. On his way back to the common room, he couldn’t help but wonder - why?
“I’m so fucking excited for this, Dray. You are fucking amazing, I hope you know.” Harry said, lining up and pushing slightly.
Hermione continued to insist on being told what had just happened, but as Ron helped get Harry ready again, and Harry practically sat slumped in the chair, Hermione was at a loss and began helping as well.
Suddenly steel met forest and Harry's world felt like it was going to crash down right there. His stare was so intense that it pierced through Harry like a sword.
“So that’s what Kingsley thinks of me then, eh? A petty criminal who deserves to be locked away in a basement for 8 hours a day, sifting through paper, doing an animal’s job?” Draco looked over at Harry, rage now encasing his expression. “Nice one, Potter. I know the whole wizarding world is aware of my crimes and think me of nothing but scum upon their shoe, but never did I think you and your chummy little Minister would agree with them, let alone employ me with ‘like-minded’ associates.”
Draco was happy. So happy.
After regaining some control, Draco stood up straight and smoothed down his shirt. “I’m fine.” His voice was hoarse and Harry stared at him incredulously.
“Yeah.” Harry said breathlessly. “I want you.”
When Draco got in, he saw a hint of brunette peeking out from one of the seats at the front of the plane. Draco didn’t want to disturb him anymore than he clearly already was, so he took a seat at the back, and picked up a random magazine to hopefully drown out the painful pinching in his heart.
But he wasn’t. He had simply fallen for someone who changed for the better, who was a wonderful, loving person now that he’d found himself amongst the rubble of his past and mistakes. Someone who not only makes Harry a better person, but who’s good for him, who treats him how he should be treated, who cares for him the way he’s never really been cared for before.
They never did finish their breakfast, nor their conversation of future dreams.
“I have a few papers to finish up for Kingsley, but I was hoping we could go out for dinner tonight.”
That sparked a new type of frenzy between them. In an attempt to level the nakedness between them, Draco almost ripped Harry’s shirt in half, trying to get it off of him, desperate to feel his skin. As Harry chuckled against his lips, Draco’s hands then flew to Harry’s drawstring, starting to unknot it with quick succession. However, something in Harry stopped. A warning flashed from behind his eyelids, ultimately stopping Draco’s frantic administrations.
Pink hair.
Draco’s brows furrowed. “Did what? The interview? I know, that’s where you’ve been all afternoon.”
“Draco, from the bottom of my heart, I really, really like you. I am not just saying that. You are my husband, of course I love you.”
“Yeah, basically.” Potter said, looking glumly into his drink.
“Where is Hermione anyways?” Draco pondered.
Harry said he was going to be in his study, Floo calling his friends, then left Draco alone.
“I’m all sweaty. I wanna shower. Har, please.” Draco attempted to wiggle out of Harry’s embrace, until Harry tightened his hold on him.
“Yes, professor.” Harry said solemnly. He turned to go back to the hospital wing to get Malfoy, when McGonagall stopped him.
Once he turned his attention back to Draco, Draco smiled.
Harry, surprised that Draco was speaking without first being spoken too, answered with "Yes, is that alright?"
Draco spun around and stared at Harry with a serious expression “Are you sure you want to finish that sentence?”
He distracted himself with the easy and relatively mess-free task of making some tea, and after grabbing a warm cuppa, he went out to the small backyard and sat in one of the old deck chairs. The afternoon air was calm and warm. There were a few birds chirping in a nearby tree, but the overall experience was exactly what Draco needed.
Harry wasn't offended, not really, but he scoffed anyways. “Gryffindor is NOT the most awful house at Hogwarts! Try the house that-”
“Good, good.” He said.
“Do I have to have a reason to come home early and surprise my lovely boyfriend whom I've missed all day?” Draco said, peering up to Harry from the bottom of the stairs.
Especially his Gryffindor, Draco thought, and as Harry smiled down at him, kissed his cheek softly and squeezed him a little closer, Draco agreed that yes, his Gryffindor was especially great.
“What’re you writing?” Harry pulled back and threw himself down beside Draco on the bench he sat on.
“Dray?” Harry prompted, mind wine-muffled and slightly aroused by the proximity and smell of his husband so close to him.
That spurred Draco on more, thrusting harder and faster, hitting Harry’s prostate right on.
Draco walked over to Harry as he was buttoning up his shirt. He reached up to kiss him “I am so proud of you.” He said.
In one fluid motion, he kissed Draco so powerfully, drawing his attention to their lips, as he slowly breached the blond. As soon as he bottomed out, Draco ripped his lips away, turned his face and screamed, tears pooling in the corners of his eyes.
“Sorted out your differences, then?” Ron asked, raising a brow.
A good century later, according to Draco, Harry eventually bottomed out, constantly caressing Draco’s back, hips and thighs.
“Sorry.” Draco choked out, the pain subsiding slightly.
“That won’t help, Ron.” Hermione chided.
He then grabbed his clothes and went down to the basement to wash them… only he had no idea how to work the damn machine. He could ask the house-elf, but he tried to avoid him as much as possible. He was an unfriendly little fellow and Draco felt extremely uncomfortable under his gaze. He settled for throwing them in a basket off to the side, and made his way back up to the main floor. He really didn’t feel like locking himself up in the library again, so he decided to go outside for some fresh air.
Harry's brows furrowed “What do you mean?”
With their relationship turning more physical, and their whole relationship still being fairly new, this all seemed so quick to Harry. It felt like he didn’t have time to process what was going on, because something new would come up again. Their situation didn’t seem to have any breaks, Harry felt like it was spinning out of control.
"You were here first."
“What about the press? And the rumors?” Harry worried.
When did he become Draco instead of Malfoy?
“Har-I’m, I’m gonna- come.”
“Fuck, Draco.” Harry said very loudly. He made to touch Draco but he swerved out of his way.
“Draco..” Harry said expectantly.
When Harry woke up to a cold bed, he sat up immediately and searched the room for his mate. “Draco?” he called. That’s when the initial fog of sleep lifted, and he heard the water running from the shower, the bathroom connecting to their bedroom.
They stayed like that for a while, Harry holding Draco, and Draco clinging onto him. The little Omega had stopped crying, but he didn't let go. He couldn't let go.
Draco realized then that he had everything he needed. He had his man, he had the reef below him and water around him, and he had true content in his heart.
Hermione and Ron had come over later that day. They decided to enjoy chinese take out at Grimmauld place, before they discussed Harry and Draco’s new possible discovery about their prophecy predicament.
“I want to see how long you can stay quiet, love.” Draco says. Harry looks at him, regards him for a moment, then nods.
Draco growled, lifted Harry up, and threw him down on the bed, just like Harry had said. Harry giggled as he spelled both their clothes off, too immersed in their activity to give a damn.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up but his face stayed impassive, in an ‘are you serious?’ kind of way. He told himself to expect this question, but to give nothing away in case it came up.
“Actually, Madame Pomfrey told me that you’ve been taking up time in the hospital wing, apprenticing her. She said that you are interested in becoming a healer.”
“Draco, I already said I took care of him-” Har-Potter began, but Draco cut him off.
“Wow, really? Never pegged you to be that malicious.” Harry grinned.
Harry gasped and groaned like he was in an extreme amount of pain.
He gritted his teeth and opened the first few books. He looked through the contents and found nothing even close to what he was looking for. He was lucky to find the last book titled ‘Humans and Creatures Alike’. The last book didn’t have much, but it was a lot more than he already  knew.
“Hmm? Yes?” Harry questioned.
“You can’t declare your love for me and then expect me to do the same!”
“What?” Draco asked innocently, but in a way one might consider seductively.
“Are you seeing Harry?” He asked.
“Come here. Now.” Harry demanded, pushing his chair away from the desk to make room for Draco.
“Mmm... this is going to be fun.” He smirked. He began crawling over to Harry, who backed up more and more until he hit a chair against the wall. He fell into it as Malfoy approached him.
“Glad you think so.” Harry said.
“Well, she told you not to heed this as a warning, but a guide. I mean, I’m definitely curious, but I wouldn’t be too worried if I were you.” Hermione said, taking out her homework from her bag.
“Hmm?”
As it blows through the trees.
Draco shrugged and dropped his gaze to the floor. He was quick to start pulling the sweater over his pale hands in a nervous manner. "Ok, I guess." He said quietly.
“Whatever you say, Malfoy. You’re the professional.” Potter says with a wink.
“Draco!” she said, running towards him. “I-I think I figured it out.” she was out of breath by the time she caught up to him.
Draco had read - or tried to, at least - since Harry left to meet up with Ron, but only managed to skim through a few pages before he got fed up and left the library. He ate warmed up leftovers from the night before, made some tea, then sat outside and tried to distract himself with anything but the small, unsettling anxiety that pooled in his stomach.
“The potion.”
Harry chuckled. “Because it’s a work day and you wouldn’t miss one even if old Voldy came back.” Then Harry regarded him seriously. “I thought it might be something serious. Thought I’d try to get it out of you. Glad I did too.” Harry’s lip curled up at the end.
“I don’t appreciate being lied too, and it clearly wasn’t nothing if you had to close the door to prevent me from looking. What was the potion for?”
Harry felt his stomach twist uncomfortably. “I doubt that.”
Harry got into the shower and watched Draco watching him.
“Ye’ve reached me inbox. Leave me a message, or just send an owl, yeh bloody muggle!” BEEP.
“I’m only joking, Malfoy. From what I remember, you're almost as smart as Hermione.”
“No, no! Draco please, no. He can’t know.” she said frantically.
Draco eventually nodded. “I’m sure he can.”
“Like the meeting with The Daily Prophet, wanting to know how the Saviour is managing life after Hogwarts; the groceries we need for this week: milk, toast, eggs, all the wonderful stuff; and dinner with Granger and her Weasel. I’m sure I’m forgetting something, so I’m trying to figure out what.” Draco replied, tapping the end of his quill on his chin.
So Harry did.
“Not really, no. They’re all swarmed down there. It wouldn’t be fair, and they’d probably hate me if I left them with my work.” Draco said, standing up to leave.
“Mhmm. Thanks Ted, see ya.” he waved goodbye and dragged Potter behind him. They found an unused pool table in the back, far from what poor Ted could see. “What the actual hell, Potter?! You are aware of a concept called consent, correct? Or just the notion of politeness and not getting all up in one’s space?” Draco said, pushing Potter’s shoulders firmly.
“So, Potter. Got any plans for tonight?” Draco asked nonchalantly. He asked this to all his customers, wanting to know if they had plans so he could help design the perfect style for the event.
“Mhmm, I love you too.”
Harry looked over to the oven before saying “You didn’t turn it on.” Draco just gave him a confused look before Harry continued “You have to preheat it, you know - warm it up before you bake those.”
Instead of apparating back to Grimmauld Place, Harry decided to walk there, taking time for himself, to walk through the park and enjoy the outdoors.
Pansy knew all about Draco’s crush on Harry. Of course she did, she knew before he did. Back in their third year, she picked it up quicker than anyone could have. She was always sympathetic towards Draco, knowing that with their rivalry, the chances of them getting together in Hogwarts was slim to none. Now though, with them grown adults and having figured themselves out more…. the possibilities were endless.
“Well, that was pleasant.” Draco deemed.
“Serves you right, bonehead.”
When Harry was done with his amazing swim, he covered himself up with a towel and went back inside to clean up.
“Yeah, I just wanted to cool off a bit.”
“Ok, but you could have fucked me over a grand, intrinsically engraved desk before you’ve even worked a day behind it, leaving you with the memory of stretching me open and fucking me deep and hard every time you sat behind it until the day you retired? Wow, missed out there, Potter.” Draco said, starting down the hall again and pulling Harry forward. An arm snaked around his waist and pulled him close to a hard chest.
Malfoy sighed. “You really can be obtuse. I can show you why sharing the bed could be good.”
Any other time in his whole life of knowing Draco Malfoy, Harry would’ve always expected the look in those steel-grey to be filled with hate and disgust, whenever directed at him. This time, however, the emotions that the glowing-like orbs held was what someone would describe as awestruck. With lips parted and a slight up-pull of one of the corners, Draco was smiling.
“Yeah, she's always been like that.” Harry smiled adoringly.
Draco looked at him thoughtfully before replying. "No, I've got nothing. And honestly, yes. I'd love to leave this place." He spoke softly and seriously, completely different from his normal, snippy tone Harry was used to hearing at school.
“Mr Potter! Good to see you again.” Kingsely’s secretary, Sarah, her name was apparently, greeted him.
Draco stared at their hands again, and as if Harry got the clue, his hand slipped away first and started to turn away. "Good night Draco." He said over his shoulder.
"That may also hold some control. Anywhere that held an event directly relating to your prophecy or bonding, will hold significant magical traces, able to force control over your relationship, so to speak."
Draco pulled back first. “I don’t fancy a fuck on sand. It won’t be comfortable for either of us.” With that, he grabbed his beloved’s hand and walked them back up to the bungalow.
He starts undressing me with the same touches and same movements as always. He eventually picks us up and Apparates us both to his room.
Draco turned, kissed Harry passionately and possessively, backing them up to the bed.
“Oh, now you want to communicate?!” Draco rebutted back. “Why should I? It’s not like YOU want to do this thing together! I have done everything only for you this far. It’s been a day! A fucking day and I regret this! I would’ve rather died than married you! Because you know what’s worse than being married to someone you don’t like? Being married to someone you love that HATES you!”
“On another note” Walkins started up again, “if the pain gets to be too much to handle at times, seeing as it’s not always possible for you two to be within direct contact of each other forever, I can prescribe a pain potion to help numb the affects, if that's what you desire.” She looked more to Harry than Draco, now knowing he’s the only one who’d most likely require said potion.
Four…his friends and family
An immaculately plucked, pale eyebrow lifted on Draco’s face. “I’ve been invited?”
As they reached the Floos, Draco asked “How did you know I was lying earlier?”
“No, it’s passed. I could use some water.”
“Ok, we’ll be down there shortly.” Hermione said politely, giving the man his cue to leave.
Draco pretended not to notice his stomach squeezing at the sheer adorableness Potter had radiating off of him; a major contrast to the first night he went out with him.
Harry approached the blond and wrapped his arms around the slightly smaller body. He rested his chin on his head and squeezed slightly.
"Umm, no, it's alright." Draco paused then continued with "But I think I should get back to bed. It's late."
“Take it back.” Harry ordered when he pinned Draco’s hands to his sides.
“Say another word about it and I’ll kick you out.” Draco said threateningly. “I’m a beautician Potter, not a linguist. Although my lexicon is particularly diverse, compared to your barbaric, subpar, plebeian vocabulary.” he might as well have stuck his nose high into the air with the level of ponce that radiated off of him.
"I’ve noticed that you're different. You've changed a lot since Hogwarts, I mean. You're quieter, more polite, and I haven't heard you insult me at all since I saw you yesterday." Harry said with a light laugh.
“Something appropriate… unlike your swim earlier.” Draco replied, making his way out of the room.
“No?” Harry said. Draco nodded. Harry licked his cheek. Draco screamed. Harry laughed. “Take it back.” He repeated.” Draco scowled and shook his head, trying his best to fight his smile. “I’ll lick you again.” Harry threatened. Draco scowled harder. Just as Harry leaned down, Draco reached up and kissed him soundly. Harry released his hands from the shock and Draco wrapped them around his neck. Draco quickly sat up, on top of Harry’s inviting lap.
Harry stood by the sink, filling a glass with water. “Mhmm.” he hummed. It didn’t sound like he was alright.
Draco was astounded. He was not expecting Harry to go on a full rant about why he was so emotionally unavailable. But now he knew why. And now he knew that Harry was going to try to open up.
Harry nodded, but neither of them moved away.
“Since I realized I was fucked. Truly and utterly fucked.” He said, falling back into the couch.
Harry eventually calmed down, pulling Draco to his chest and comforting him through body heat.
Malfoy lay on the bed, unconscious. Harry listened carefully to what the medi-witch had to say, as he stared intently at the blond.
“You aren’t just saying that? You truly believe it?”
“Hi baby.” Harry said tentatively.
More silence.
Draco blushed.
“Well, you said you wanted to talk about it.”
“Don’t disagree that that man didn’t need to shower more than he did, the greasy roach that he was.” Draco said, playing with his nails.
Harry screamed in delight, pulling his cheeks farther apart, and moaning so loudly, Hogwarts could’ve heard him.
Well, since he walked in the room and Harry discovered the beauty of the blond.
Arri Walkins entered the room with the air of a wisp: gentle and elegant. Her frail composition suiting her well. She came over to the bed, shaking both Harry and Draco’s hand with a quiet introduction, before turning to Hermione too.
Silence continued for another minute. Yes, he definitely hated Harry.
“You still have it?” He looked up, surprise filling his eyes.
He undresses in front of me, teasing me. He leans over me and kisses me hard.
Ginny shivers. “A war is coming. Everyone can feel that.”
He catches Draco looking at it, and he pulls down his sleeve to cover it. “When I was younger, before Hogwarts, I would come up here and stare out at the lake and wonder what my life would be like.”
Harry leads them up the stairs to his bedroom, not bothering to shut the door, simply lifting a slightly tipsy Draco onto the bed and kissing him messily, one hand on his thigh and the other haphazardly unbuttoning his shirt.
“Oh so now it’s Draco, is it?” Ron asks. “Been thinking about him too much, don’t you think mate?”
“You are as ignorant as ever,” Draco says angrily. “I shouldn’t even be here. I shouldn’t do this at all, let alone for you, of all people. But I’m doing it because I know how—nevermind.” Draco turns to hide the hot flush creeping up his cheeks. He sets the briefcase he brought on the counter top, made of black leather with silver clasps.
Harry’s hand drops from Ginny’s. “Did you ever wonder how we never had to choose? I was always on the right side, the good side. Dumbledore’s side, whatever that means. And your parents already fought against Voldemort in the Great War. It was easy.”
Pansy took a liking to Neville. They kissed by the end of the night, Pansy with her catlike smile, Neville speechless, his cheeks red as roses. Harry and Dean discovered that Draco had purchased a Muggle video game, but did not know how to operate it, so they invited him over the very next day to teach him, always desperate for more players.
“I don’t live there anymore,” Draco says shortly and without explanation, knowing Harry will not stoop so low as to ask why and risk showing interest. He always did take care in how people saw him.
Draco lifts the covers from his bed, though if he had the choice, he’d rather stay within their warmth tonight.
The Headmistress purses her lips, as if the situation is as dreadful to her as to the current Gryffindor students. “Unfortunately, the condition of Gryffindor Tower prohibits its use by students. A tent has been erected on the grounds that I hope will satisfy the Gryffindor house, though I understand will never replace the Tower.”
“No, he’s just sad. You left him with an impossible choice, Harry, to choose someone who kept him a secret, or to choose a life without the person he loves most in the world.” Hermione sighs, taking Ron’s hand in hers. He squeezes it comfortingly. “You know, the world wants to heal more than it wants to hate. If you give people the chance to love you for who you are, they will take it, I promise you.”
Pansy stares at him with sad, sad eyes. “Don’t do this, Draco.”
“Merlin,” she whispers under her breath.
“With Muggles?” Harry sounds surprised but not confused.
"I thought you wouldn't come." Harry. Who else? He heard each word like a vibration wherever Harry touched him.
The tip of his wand flickers with light, then sputters out, like the flame of a candle in the wind. He clenches his jaw and swings his arm as if he might will his magic to work, saying the spell again through gritted teeth. The light flickers again, then suddenly a blinding light explodes from his wand and fills the entire room, waking everyone with shouts and curses.
“I suppose,” Longbottom says quietly, sounding oddly solemn, “she means us not to forget, but to forgive.”
Draco begins to stir, as if sensing Harry’s eyes on him. He cracks an eye open.
, Draco thinks wryly,
Harry’s heart beats loudly in his chest as he lets Draco pull off his sweater and toss it on the ground, then remove his undershirt with a smirk. They stay apart for a moment, and Draco takes the time to admire Harry, to pass his hands over Harry’s bare chest, with his heartbeat loud like a drum, down his abdomen, tracing the thin line of hair that disappears beneath his jeans.
“I don’t know,” Harry says quietly. “I had a choice, but it didn’t really feel like one.”
“You don’t have to.”
“He means,” Harry interrupts sleepily, eyes still closed, “a romantic.”
“Just to see how it feels?”
“And how do you know this again,” Hermione cuts in sharply. “Oh right! You just know.”
Draco shrugs. “Some things have changed, but others haven’t.”
“This?” Harry uses his other hand to slowly slide his shirt sleeve up to his elbow. Draco’s Dark Mark is nothing more than a faded tattoo on his skin.
“See you at the Christmas Party, Harry,” she says quietly, before leaving him behind.
“And don’t worry about paying for these. It’s a gift. And I’m sure after Mr. Weasley sees you in them he’ll be thanking
“There’s someone who wants to see you.”
Draco shakes his head gently. “I’m not trying to just flatter you, Hermione. I truly believe the country needs your leadership and genius.” He bows his head slightly when Hermione fails to respond, practically speechless, a small smile on his face. “If that will be all, I should get going. Pansy will start to cook if left alone too long, and she’s a special type of bad in the kitchen.”
She puts out her cigarette when she hears footsteps on the stairs, and walks back inside the kitchen.
He glances at Hermione, who is curled up in an armchair with a book, as per usual. They haven’t been talking much since he started dating Lavender. But since Christmas Break, a sort of truce has sprung between them. Harry spreads himself out on the carpeted floor before the roaring fire, eyes closed, his Potion’s textbook resting on his stomach, underneath his hand.
His expression is vague, but Ginny can see the darkness lurking beneath.
Pansy doesn’t say anything more, and a few moments later, Draco saunters down, hair mussed from an afternoon nap.
Draco stared hard at him. “Yes. I wanted to keep this a secret because
A voice calls his name and a hand grabs his arm. Harry bolts upright in a cold sweat, and he realizes what he has to do. He gets up with shaky hands and starts packing immediately, blindly shoving clothes in a duffel bag. At the last moment before leaving his room, he snatches the vial off his nightstand and slips it into the pocket of his cloak.
“I love you.” Harry says it so plainly, not like a reason but a fact of life, with a stark surety that belies every doubt and worry Draco has ever had.
Now Harry fears that if Weasley does not propose soon, Miss Granger may think his feelings changed, and will lose hope and grow distant. Her natural reaction will thus discourage Weasley’s already timid confidence, and he will put off a proposal until the day he dies. And Harry must watch his closest friends grow apart miserably, completely helpless in the situation.
“But—”
He Disapparates before Pansy can respond.
“Harry…” Hermione begins hesitantly.
It means—”
“I thought perhaps you would have some expertise on the matter,” Harry says, ignoring his question. “Is there another potion…?”
“Oh yes, I found them,” Hermione says airily, nodding her head.
“Put your wand away, Draco,” Harry says coldly.
“―learning history is the only way we can stop ourselves from repeating the mistakes of the past. Second, Professor Binns is a ghost, which means he can manage more classes and not notice the difference.”
“I told him you don’t want to.” Harry watches Ginny’s reaction, but Ginny only smiles, though it doesn’t reach her eyes.
One day, however, this game turned into something else.
“So,” Hermione begins, glancing at Ron hesitantly. She rarely does anything hesitantly, but Ron has noticed her hesitating a lot around him recently. “Harry said no?”
Mornings are the hardest part of Draco’s day. A part of him longs never to wake up, and the rest of him must convince that part of him that nothing will fall apart when he opens his eyes.
“If by happiness, you mean acquiring a suitable marriage for each, then yes. Otherwise, I am afraid that
Draco looks at it anxiously, then quickly slides the box under his arm. “Nothing. A present for someone.” He avoids Harry’s searching gaze. “Really, you should go.”
Harry shrugs, and his face looks empty and cold. “We thought it would’ve been safer, with the task Voldemort gave him.”
“I am sure that by secrecy, they did not mean from your own wife, but from the children!”
A red taint blinds his vision like a shower of blood, and he realizes distantly, as if his mind has floated above his body, that his hand is gripping his wand.
“I lied,” Draco says quietly.  Harry’s heartbeat pounds once like a drum in his chest.
He pauses, and Hermione sees Molly with tears down her face, and Ginny discreetly wiping at her cheeks. Everyone has their eyes on Harry, even Draco.
Hermione sighs. “He knows as much as me.”
“You’re just victimizing yourself now.” Pansy sighs. “Life doesn’t owe you any favors, Draco. You take what you can get, how you can get it.”
Hogwarts watches him as he ascends to the top of the Astronomy Tower.
It has been three months since Harry moved into Draco’s apartment, and just shy of two since Pansy arrived at his doorstep and complicated things to such an extent that Draco can scarcely see a way out of it.
“Ten minutes late,” younger Hermione says, cutting Harry a slightly worried glance. For a moment Hermione forgets why she would have been worried about Harry, but then she recalls Harry’s break up with Ginny that wasn’t really a break up because they were not together to begin with. Perhaps that’s why, but somehow Hermione doubts it now. But what else would she be worried about, then? “Honestly, it’s outrageous.”
Suddenly a hand encircles the base of his cock, lighting his body on fire. He groans and Pansy shudders above him, rocking her hips ever so slightly. Harry feels Draco’s hand moving up and down slowly, too slowly, so that Harry’s legs tense up, tortured.
“Let me,” Draco says, swatting Harry’s hands away and undoing the buttons with frightening speed, lifting his own shirt off roughly and throwing it on the ground, helping Harry shrug off his own shirt, struggle out of pants, dropping them off the side of the bed with a superior irritation, as if clothes aren’t a worthy impedance. There is no time for romance or enticing gestures of slow reveals, just skin on skin, just straight pleasure like a shot of vodka to the back of the throat, eyes stinging at the shock.
She looks like a saving grace, if grace were dark and sinful, and Draco feels relieved to see her.
“Might I remind you that I raised you,” Dumbledore says not without a similar sharpness. He sighs, tugging at his long beard. “I’m not your father, but I care about you.”
“You know, as a friend.”
Harry returns home with his head full of Hermione’s warnings. They live in a very luxurious apartment with two floors and more rooms than seem possible to fit in the space, most likely thanks to Draco’s illegal extension charms which he pays the landlord to keep quiet about. He opens the heavy wooden door, passing through a shimmery ward.
Hermione looks at her sympathetically. “We just thought you should know. You’ve always known how to deal with him, and he just won’t listen to anything we say.”
Harry lifts his head, squinting his eyes. “Can I borrow something?”
Hermione sighs, and Ron rolls his eyes. Ginny just looks up from the magazine she’s flipping through and after a moment of searching Harry’s face, goes back to reading.
Harry puts out the cigarette and walks back inside the kitchen. He opens the cabinet above the sink, removing the strong glamour he had placed on it long ago, and grabbing a small vial of The Sad Nightingale he has had since the war.
“Oh.” Hermione looks startled, then curious. “Are you two dating? I was wondering.”
How can they still be out? Hermione pushes away the mental image of Ron kissing Lavender, the concept simply too horrid. As it happens, the more she tries not to picture it, the more her mind replays seeing them the other day, curled up together in that alcove, kissing and cooing at each other like a pair of lovebirds.
“No, you’re not my father.” Harry walks over to the Pensieve, where dark swirls of memory slither like snakes in the water. His voice comes out flat. “Tom Riddle killed him.”
* * *
The rest of the castle did not fare better, with large streaks of black as thick as tar marring the beautiful stone. Chunks of the walls are missing where a spell blasted through it. Great swathes of the castle grounds are completely burnt and show no signs of returning life.
“You should sleep,” Ginny repeats.
A faint kick flutters against his hand. Harry smiles, then looks up, but his smile fades when he realizes Hermione is crying.
Ginny closes her eyes, breathing softly. “Alright.” Her eyes are firm, like solid stone, and Harry can’t read through the walls. “This will be the last time.”
“Good day, Mr. Potter,” she says, tipping her head, the bluebirds twittering softly. The doors shudder closed, and without warning, the lift drops again. Harry smooths his suit down, thankful to exit the lift when it stops, and makes his way across the grand, polished hallway to the Auror offices.
He nods silently, then kisses her cheek absently, like he’s trying not to listen, trying not to understand her full meaning. She grabs his wrist and holds him steady.
Harry looks at Draco, at his apprehension, and traces the outline of the Dark Mark, ending with his fingertip on the head of the snake. Draco’s eyelids flutter shut, then open anxiously. He pulls his arm back but Harry keeps his grip around his wrist, so Draco ends up pulling Harry closer.
Finally Harry breaks the silence. “Does your offer still stand?”
“My wand is perfectly fine,” Harry replies automatically. “I have used this wand since I was eleven. It is
“Does that bother you?” Ginny asks.
“I’m not really,” Harry mutters, sitting up and stifling a yawn.
Soon Harry falls asleep, Draco's head on his chest like an anchor, sinking him down to the bottom of the sea.
“Seamus,” Ron hissed. Hermione elbowed him.
“I’m a former Death Eater, you know,” Draco says quietly, trying to control the slight tremor in his voice. Merlin, he needs to leave. A minute longer with Harry and he won’t be able to keep himself together.
A murmur of conversation floats from behind her, and Hermione frowns.
“Right, right, of course…” Slughorn mutters, startled at Draco’s adamancy.
“I want to see you,” Harry whispers, threading his fingers through Draco’s hair, which is already very disheveled. Draco’s reddened lips lift into a smile.
Harry’s face burns. “You know what I mean,” he says gloomily.
Draco laughs, but it is harsh and Harry flinches.  He feels his body hum at the reaction. “No, I’ll leave that to the Dark Lord. But perhaps I could hurt you enough to land you in St. Mungo’s for a few weeks—until Christmas break, at least. I don’t need much longer than that. Or maybe a
Harry looks at Draco in amazement and terror. “Are you drunk?”
Their procession into the castle is more like a funeral march, and no one says much as they take their seats for the Welcome Feast. Harry is in such a daze that he nearly sits down right away, and is saved from embarrassment by Weasley’s firm hand preventing him. They remain standing throughout the Sorting, which is conducted with more gravity than usual. Finally, the last small First Year is sorted into Ravenclaw.
Harry has never been close to Dumbledore, that much is apparent, but still. He’s already lost his biological parents, would he be so willing to lose another, even if their relationship is strained?
“Perhaps you still hold a grudge?” Hermione counters, and Pansy feels a rush of exhilaration that washes out the hurt pride. She has missed the innocent rivalry from her school days, when everything was Slytherin against Gryffindor. Draco puts up a good fight, but ever since Harry’s reappeared in the picture he’s gone soft.
He stares into the crackling fire of the Gryffindor common room. Almost everyone else has gone to bed, except for Hermione. She hunches over her notes with laser focus, probably for the Potions exam they have tomorrow.
“Harry,” Hermione says, and he looks up absently at her. “Are you okay?”
Draco briefly cups Pansy’s face in his hand, before gently guiding her in front of him until she realizes his intentions, and climbs on top of Harry’s chest, inching her hips over his face. Harry inhales sharply as Pansy lowers herself slightly.
Harry looks at Ginny quizzically, and she silently curses to herself for pushing it. He doesn’t know she saw him that night. He doesn’t know she saw the look in his eyes and knew without a shred of doubt that Harry would never look at her like that.
Miss Granger looks up, smiling. “The Headmistress is allowing me to take ten classes.”
this after so many years of nothing.
“My love—”
“What do you have to be ashamed of? You’re not talking about being a Death Eater, right? Because everyone knows you didn’t have a choice,” Harry says adamantly, and Draco stares at him in surprise.
Blaise laughed at something, and that's when Draco realized who Blaise was talking to.
“I can’t, Harry. I have to. You wouldn’t understand,” Draco says angrily. He looks furious, but also on the verge of tears. “I have to do this. You just wouldn’t understand.”
Harry tries not to look at Miss Weasley, who is barely containing her laughter.
“Why?” Harry said, breathless.
Hermione replies with something he can’t make out, but Pansy tenses just slightly, before relaxing. She’s nodding, and holding out her hand, as if to comfort Hermione. How odd the world has become in such a short time.
Why had they not done this before?
“Why would he never tell us?” Ron asks out loud, then shakes his head. “You know what, it doesn’t matter. I’m sure he had a reason.” He scratches at his stubble. “If he loved someone, why did he date Ginny?”
“Benefits?”
He relies on Ginny more than he would ever admit. She helps him forget...but only for stolen moments that are all too brief. Afterwards, reality rushes back and hits him like a freight train, so fast that his life flashes before his eyes except it’s not his life but every memory he has of Draco.
“I don’t know if we should stay together.”
“Need your glasses?” Draco asks haughtily.
He takes another step closer, the top of his boot going past the edge of the floor. He leans over, just a little bit more.
The curses fly back and forth, and the bathroom rapidly tears to pieces under the brunt force of malice. Harry’s hands shake with how much rage trembles in his breast, but his mind hones in steady on the harsh breath of someone else.
A loud clicking noise from afar makes them go still in each other’s arms. Harry pulls back, dizzy. Then he realizes what—who—is making that noise.
“I know,” Harry says, his throat closing up again. “I wish it was.”
Defense Against the Dark Arts with Mr Bill Weasley, highly selective
“Why do you say that?” Weasley asks.
“Draco, step away from the edge,” she says, her voice shaking. He breaks a little inside.
Harry fidgeted with the hem of his shirt. “His room. It’s too much. I was going to sleep downstairs, but I saw your light.”
Pansy hums low, the sound vibrating throughout her body, and Harry works his mouth faster, the low sounds unwillingly escaping from her lips causing Harry’s head to spin, intoxicated.
“I know. But she fights for justice, while I fight against
love and respect.
“Why can’t you be together?” Ron asks, confused. “The war is over. Everybody loves you—”
He takes a sip. “We need to stay close.”
“I—I can’t—he’s—I—” his eyes dart around and she shushes him gently, a finger on his lips, brushing softly.
“Yes, dad.”
“Why, Hermione? Because the bloke told Harry he was planning to kill his dad, that’s why,” Ron says, but Hermione just elbows him sharply, and looks at Harry.
“Draco,” Harry warns, but it’s no use, he can see the walls rising like a fortress in Draco’s shoulders, sees him pull himself up in defense. “I could help you.”
“It was with a girl. Once. It was nothing.”
A creak of a door and soft footsteps shake Harry’s attention away, and the shimmering label fades to air. He looks at the front desk, and his breath catches ever so slightly at the blond hair and dark robes.
“I thought I’d surprise you,” Hermione says, her voice warming like it does when she feels vulnerable and seen at the same time.
“But it’s not private. It’s secret.” Draco turned away. “And you’re ashamed of it. Of me.”
His whole body stays at rest until Draco sits up again, then Harry’s pulling him toward his chest again, Draco’s entire body over his on the couch, kissing him, not a care in the world, his limbs languid, his skin hot and tender, where each touch from Draco’s fingers is like a spark against stone.
Pansy’s lips tremble, but she nods, and they remain in each other’s arms on her bed until Draco drifts into a fitful sleep. Later, he feels Pansy untangling her arms, wrapping the robe around her body, and leaving the room. He hears Harry’s voice downstairs, distantly.
And Dumbledore doesn’t like the Malfoys too much, so Draco could never get close to Harry, much less even introduce himself. Only when they made it to Hogwarts, out of the watchful eye of the Headmaster, did Draco attempt a friendship.
Harry averts his gaze. “I know.”
that.
“Please don’t do this,” Draco says, tears spilling down his cheeks. “Not you, Harry. I need you. I can’t—you won’t—”
Draco half smiles. “That’s not why.”
“It would be easier if I had died that night with my parents,” Harry says.
“Well, you know, I…”
The glow of the lighter wavers in the dark. Harry watches it, wondering what it would be like to have only known this flame, this light, and not the blue glow of a
Draco drops his wand, and the spell ends, and Harry comes to life again, sprinting forward and kicking Draco’s wand away. They look at each other, Draco shaking all over, and Harry breathing hard.
Draco laughed harshly. “You’re right. You don’t understand a thing.”
“Oh is that what you call simple, Potter?” And the way Draco’s tone slips back effortlessly to that flirty rivalry brings a flush to Draco’s cheeks. Harry knows just what buttons to press to undo them all.
“A Death Eater?”
“Albus? You called for me?” Harry walks across the Headmaster’s office, stealing a lemon drop from a nearby bowl and popping it into his mouth. The sourness reminds him of growing up and Lucy bribing him with candy in order to lure him to the bath.
* * *
“Do you think she’s alright?” Ron asks, watching Hermione dancing in the snow ahead of them, nearly toppling dangerously to the side. Ron seems to Harry to be half paralyzingly worried about Hermione and the other half shamelessly in love. Of course, Harry would never tell Ron that.
Draco doesn’t care about scars anymore. He pulls up the sleeve on his arm, looking at his Dark Mark. How could he care about anything when
“Harry, not this again.”
“You see, Professor, I couldn’t sleep…”
“It’s nothing.”
that started it all. Maybe it was just there all along, dormant underneath years of passed insults and injuries.
“I already made an exception for you once, Harry, you can’t keep taking advantage of me.”
“Yes,” Draco whispers.
“Nearly,” she says, scanning the list. “What worries me is that seven of those fourteen classes which in past years were mandatory core classes have now been labeled ‘highly selective’ and optional.”
At that moment they walk past Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions, where Harry glimpses a familiar face in the windows. He quickly excuses himself from the bickering pair on the pretense of quickly buying a new robe, but they hardly notice his escape, as they are so caught up in each other’s company.
He raises his eyebrows, briefly surprised. “I’m doing as well as I can, I suppose. Why do you ask?”
“And quite right for you to think so,” Miss Granger says firmly. “I would have taken Herbology as well.”
“Wait!” Ron hurries after them, leaving a startled and hurt Lavender without the least bit of remorse.
“But—”
But Pansy sees it.
* * *
“Make love to me, Harry.”
“I cannot believe it!” Weasley cries, holding up a letter. The rest of the family looks at him, startled. They are all eating breakfast in the dining room and reading the letters that just arrived from Hogwarts which will decide which courses they were accepted by and, if they were not, which remaining courses are still available.
Harry leans forward, his eyes like the depths of a green forest, and Ron notes to himself that for the first time in weeks Harry seems to have come alive, with his shoulders brimming with untamed energy, a glimmer of the intensity that so shocked Ron at the Battle.
“Lastly, since many of you have completed much of the Hogwarts curriculum, I find it unnecessary to reteach topics that have already been learned. That is partly why I allowed most classes to be optional, and why many classes will be taught by guests very much esteemed in their respective fields. It is time to narrow your focus and choose an area of work that you would like to pursue after graduating. The smaller class sizes will allow you to form meaningful connections with your professors, which can prove useful later on as an apprenticeship or letter of recommendation for higher education. Use your time wisely.
They had to keep their love a secret.
“Zabini?” The name resurfaces memories from long ago, huddled by the fire in the Slytherin common room to keep the dungeon’s chill away, whispering about their boys, debating who had a better smile, or who was sexier. “That was ages ago.”
Ron turns around, and sees Ginny snogging Dean in plain view behind a nearby tapestry, scarcely hidden from view. Immediately he wants to vomit and punch Dean for no reason other than to stop the current horrifying scene from continuing further.
“Dreams?” The word floats in Draco’s mind sluggishly, like a leaf slowly drowning in a current. Harry reaches up with his other hand, lightly tracing Draco’s cheek. Draco holds his breath.
“But what do you think?” the man asks, blinking his blue eyes at him. Harry grimaces, staring into the fruity drink the man bought him exactly thirty two minutes ago as if the pineapple chunks swimming within might help him out.
Hermione looks down at herself, puzzled. “What? Do I look bad?”
The Headmistress calls for them to come closer near the podium. They rise and settle at the front of the long tables. Malfoy sits as far away as possible. Professor McGonagall walks down from the podium and stands before them. This close, Harry can see how exhausted she looks, and he realizes how much this must cost her.
No less than a few seconds later he hears someone clearing their throat. Ron pulls away, ignoring Lavender’s protests, and blushes when he sees Harry and Hermione standing there, the former raising a bored eyebrow and the latter with arms crossed, frowning.
Ever since the incident in the girl’s bathroom on their Hogsmeade trip, with Draco casting the
“Not for long,” Harry says with a smirk.
Miss Granger sighs, but says nothing more. They have had and will have this argument many times again.
“You said things were different now.”
“I know,” Draco says a little coldly. “She told me.”
“I don’t know,” Harry says finally. “Perhaps an auror as well.”
“I’m closed, Harry. Didn’t you read the sign?”
“Thanks, Hermione.” Harry runs a hand subconsciously through his hair. “I have nightmares.”
It is late in the night when she lets go, when the stars shine their brightest, cold flakes of snow, glittering, guiding her, calling to her,
It takes a minute for Harry to think straight again. He distantly feels Pansy lift herself off the couch. Draco collapses beside him. His blonde hair sticks to his forehead. He kisses Harry’s chest.
Ginny and Harry always seemed to be, and now how they keep their distance even having technically made up. When his mind is far away, Ginny already has trouble reaching him. But now his heart has gone to a boy with a dark, twisted Fate and Ginny has no hopes of reaching Harry now.
Harry crosses his arms, frowning. “I’m fine.” A hint of a smile returns to Dumbledore’s face. “I just want to know what the memory is about.”
“Try on the midnight blue. And Hermione?”
“Draco?” Harry asked tentatively.
Harry stares at Draco, worrying his bottom lip. Then he nods, averting his eyes. “I wish things were different, that’s all. I just wanted to ask you. Just to…”
Harry shakes his head vigorously, tears spilling down his cheeks. “I can’t, Ginny, I can’t.”
Ginny flips idly through her Transfiguration's textbook, feet kicked up on the table in front of her, across from Luna Lovegood reading the latest Quibbler upside down. Ever since Ginny and Harry have stopped seeing each other, she’s realized that he had actually been a type of support system in her life. They had been friends, maybe even
“Play nice, Ron,” Hermione says as she walks away with a smirk to where Zabini lounges in a dark green loveseat, a bottle of champagne hanging carelessly from his fingertips.
“Okay,” Draco says at last. He turns to Harry, and they take each other’s hand loosely, their fingers linked between them.
But as soon as she heard that Draco and his family were cleared of any charges, she fled from Paris, and appeared on Draco’s doorstep with a suitcase and tears in her eyes. There was only one thing to be done.
They must say goodbye.
This time Draco scoots in closer, a hand pressing underneath his chin, pulling him towards his mouth. They meet softly, but with less doubt, fully exploratory now. Draco dips his head, his mouth opening gently against Harry’s.
They fall silent, and Ron and Hermione share a look that has nothing to do with what type of girl Hermione might be. Just this morning a rumor that Ginny and Dean broke up started circulating around, and still, it seems, Harry has not heard it.
* * *
“Good.” Ginny sighs. “You look exhausted. Are you sleeping?”
“Thirty more minutes, and then your mum will want to watch something.”
Harry looks away with a frown. “Yes.”
* * *
His hands find her waist like a plea for help and she kisses him—a savior.
A few moments of struggling out of sweaty Quidditch gear and falling on the floor panting, kissing hungrily, hands fumbling against skin, and Ginny arcs against the hardwood floor, gasping, eyes flying open and then shutting tightly again and Harry kisses the crook of her neck, breath stuttering as they become still once more.
He grins, and her heart skips a beat. “Sleeping.”
“Katie,” he says, the name barely escaping his lips.
“You can wear something of mine,” Harry had said, quietly, and Draco had stared at him with an unreadable expression. “If you want.”
Draco never associated shame with heartbreak until he left Harry alone in that apartment for the last time and resolved to move on.
“Okay,” Hermione says, though it physically pains her to relinquish the knowledge. “It’s your choice.”
“Well, you may have noticed that Ronald...that I...with Lavender…” Hermione stutters to a stop. She has never really said the words out loud yet, although she has said almost as much to Harry before. Somehow simply being honest hurts more than telling half-truths.
Predictably, Harry changes the subject, saying, “You’ll be working in the kitchen.”
“What? Stop!” Draco struggles at first until he realizes it’s Harry. “Oh. It’s you.”
“You left me, Draco!” Harry yells, his voice trembling, with rage or despair Draco cannot tell. Maybe it’s both, or maybe it doesn’t matter. “I chose you and you threw it all in my face—”
“I can’t forget.”
* * *
Draco does not know exactly why he finds pleasure in watching Harry and Pansy together, except that he knows exactly why, as he watches Pansy lower her cunt over Harry’s mouth, and Harry struggles in the position, his jaw working, his cock exposed, waiting, untouched, nestled in dark curls.
Hermione and Ron share another look. This time Ron speaks.
At first, Draco was worried that Harry and Pansy would hate each other. And it certainly appeared that way in the beginning. Pansy could not fathom why or how Draco came to be involved with the most Gryffindor of Gryffindors, the most Dumbledore-loving, Slytherin-hating, Savior-complex of all wizards. Harry just thought Pansy was rude.
“No,” Draco interrupts softly. “I’ll go. I need to get home anyway. Pansy will surely be waiting up for me.” Harry’s head jerks up, looking at Draco with wild eyes, before forcing his gaze down at the table.
Harry sits back, his heart pounding, imagining the scene of the Battle. He remembers a giant’s fist knocking into the Gryffindor Tower, the stone collapsing under the force. For some reason, Harry always assumed that the Ministry would dispatch a group of professional builders and with a flick of a wand the tower would restore itself. But this sounds ominous.
French with Mrs Fleur Delacour Weasley
“It’s not about me,” Harry says, and it sounds like the closest thing to pleading. But Harry never begs. “It’s about what people would say.”
“I think you know exactly what I mean.” Draco smirks. “That’s the trouble of keeping so many secrets, Harry. One might just...come out.”
A beam of light shines across Draco’s sleeping face, turning his eyelashes translucent, highlighting the fine veins in his cheekbones. Harry stares and realizes he is trying to memorize this face, those pale, sharp features, delicate and refined like a carved marble statue.
“He does, I know. My mother trusts him, so he means well. But I can’t. I just...I just can’t.”
“Was on the run a lot,” Harry said. Draco’s gaze flickered down, but not before Harry caught a flash of understanding in his eyes.
“Then why start up again?” Draco asks, momentarily forgetting his original question. Of course, that’s exactly what Harry had intended, Draco reminds himself bitterly.
“Do you want to stop?” Ginny asks, unsure what to say.
“I’m just worried about you, Harry. I didn’t know you felt that way about Ginny.”
“Ah,” Harry says quietly, “that.”
“I suspect,” Miss Granger says, her voice darker now, “he is referring to Death Eaters and those associated with them who received a lighter sentence on account of, well, special circumstances.”
She looks back at him one last time, standing there on the balcony, his unruly curls and his green eyes and his lips, almost pouting, still seducing her, still waiting for her to kiss them.
Harry leans in, and Draco doesn’t stop him. When their lips meet, Draco gasps, and Harry yanks him closer in response, their teeth scraping and all Draco can think about is how hot Harry’s mouth feels against his, burning like a furnace.
Pansy smiles, but it fades when he slips an arm around her waist, his touch sparking against her skin, a familiar ache in her body. She looks at him looking at her, and wonders what he sees, why he wants her to stay. Is it for the same reason?
“You don’t get it,” Draco whispers, looking at Harry frantically, a mouse trapped in the claws of a hawk. Is Harry that much of a monster?
“I do,” Harry replies firmly. “I know him.”
“Don’t you always have the simple solution,” Draco mocks. Harry clenches his cigarette in his fist, then opens it and a small pile of ash is at the center of his palm where his cigarette was just a second ago. The breeze scatters the ash, and it spills between his fingers like sand.
that sends Harry’s wand flying out of his hand before he can cast anything.
“Oh.” Hermione looks at Draco, startled. He blushes, frowning.
Dumbledore stands up and storms across the office, pointing a finger at Harry. “Darkness is only the absence of light, nothing more. The only power it has is the power we give to it. I would hope I’ve taught you better.”
Nothing with Harry is ever that simple.
“My choice?” Draco echoes in disbelief. His lips quiver in anger and his hands tremble at his sides. “Well, if it’s
Because while Harry has always been an excellent liar, Draco is terrible. And he lied to Hermione just now, clear as day.
“It is,” Hermione says with a pleased smile. She gives a little flourished turn, posing at the end as if she were in a photoshoot for Witch Weekly, which incidentally, Pansy had asked Hermione to model for in their next edition, seeing as she was a war hero and very beautiful—Pansy’s words, not hers.
“I love a man in an apron.”
Ginny sighs. Harry might be the storm currently surrounding her, but Luna is the rainbow she earns on the other side, and she’ll just have to accept that for now.
Harry looks at Malfoy hesitantly. The latter stiffly inclines his head, not wanting to appear rude but perhaps resenting that he must acknowledge his boyhood rival.
“Of course,” Harry says scornfully.
Hermione continues to speak animatedly, with a serious attentiveness and a generous respect for such a Death Eater as him. He can’t imagine she’d want to harm him, even if he prefers men over women, even if he’s in love with Harry Potter.
Harry glances away, biting his bottom lip.
“Ron!” Hermione blushes, half-heartedly pushing him away. “You can’t choose your partners. And anyways, I’m shackled with someone else.”
So it was set. The Boy Who Lived would befriend the Weasley boy and later on the muggle-born Granger, for whatever random reason. Interestingly, Draco was not the only one who found this strange. Many other students considered these two misfits not good enough to accompany the Chosen One wherever he went. But it was Harry Potter, a well liked and powerful wizard, brought up under the Headmaster and most dangerous wizard in the world, Albus Dumbledore, and therefore everyone accepted what he did without hesitation, and Weasley and Granger received only the highest praise and attention.
