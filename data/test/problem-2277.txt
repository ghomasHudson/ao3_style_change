“To be honest, I’m glad you said it that way. I was starting to think there was nothing left of the boy I knew in there,” Hermione said, with a feeble smile.
Draco shook his head. “I’m working. A lot, at the moment. I don’t think I’ll have a lot of time for a social life for the next few weeks.”
“I’ll be cancelling your classes, today and tomorrow,” Harry said, firmly. “With the weekend, that will be four days’ rest, and then you should be alright.”
There were a thousand things she might have intended to say, but she said none of them, and Harry heard her regardless.
Draco grunted, and gestured over the pyjama shirt, which obediently closed. He took Harry’s hand between both of his own, his expression serious, worried, and… Hermione didn’t like to look, but she couldn’t look away, especially when Draco seemed to have forgotten she was there entirely for a moment or two and gently brushed Harry’s hair from his eyes. His hand rested on Harry’s cheek for a few moments, and he murmured something Hermione didn’t believe was a spell.
“I’m not sure I really want them to,” Potter said. “The other names they’ve used over the years have run the gamut from worse to much, much worse. I filed an injunction on the Prophet eight years ago preventing them from calling me the Saviour anymore,” he admitted miserably and then flushed.
One day he had been wandering aimlessly through one of the large parks when he found a middle-aged Muggle man teaching another adult how to ride a bicycle. It was interesting; riding a bicycle in the Muggle world was like riding a Broomstick, and it was unusual for an adult never to have learned. Harry loitered, with a notice-me-not charm, and learned that the man wanted to learn so he could teach his own daughter.
“I shall get you a thesauri-quill next time I’m in Flourish and Blotts, by the way; you need some new synonyms for prat.”
By the time they landed again, a short distance from the castle, they were drenched with sweat, freezing cold, and laughing from the sheer fucking joy of it.
“If ever you find yourself ready to talk about this, I’ll be ready to listen,” Harry said, with a shrug. “It’s your choice. I’ll let you know when dinner is in.”
, All Souls’ Day. He floo-called Hermione, who couldn’t talk about anything but her pregnancy. He floo-called Ron, who only wanted to fret about what would happen if Hermione was wrong, and it wasn’t a girl (“What if she just wants to keep having them, Harry? My parents had a thousand of us before they got Ginny — I don’t have the energy.”).
“It’s alright,” Harry said. “Everything will be fine.” He felt it. He believed it. Maybe he just needed to. He cupped Hermione’s face in his hands, and kissed her forehead.
Of course. Draco sounded like he was reporting society gossip and Hermione felt a brief ripple of irritation. They didn’t have a rather more urgent conversation to be getting on with — though she supposed she had been the one to raise the topic.
Harry decided to walk back to Grimmauld Place, and stopped on the way to collect some branches that had been blown off the trees in the nearby park. Grimmauld Place was coming along very nicely. Not finished, but it was hard to believe she was the same house that she had been when they’d first taken refuge there after Bill and Fleur’s wedding. She seemed to be responding beautifully to their intentions for her, the windows growing slightly to let in more light and air, the ceilings getting higher. The kitchen was back to being enormous, and the three of them had decided only this week that they would have a big party soon, invite all of the old gang to join them. Harry liked bringing natural wood into the place. The house seemed to know how to let it be shaped into skirting boards, and absorbed into failing window frames, and he was beginning to get a feel for the wood. He liked the way it hummed in his hand.
Harry didn’t have the heart to tell Ron he’d never liked it all that much, just, Ron loved it, and Harry had taken a long time to get over the thrill of having a friend, someone who wanted to spend time with him.
He found a friendly little cafe a while after that, and ordered a pot of tea and a slice of lemon meringue pie, which was delicious. There was a shelf of battered paperback books on the back wall. Harry chose one at random and read aimlessly for a while, knowing he would never finish the book, and not minding in the slightest. He’d read enough by the time he finished his tea to know that it was a simple story about people who were looking to be happy. That was more than enough.
Harry drew back, neck sore from bending over the parchment. “What do you think?” he asked quietly after a moment.
Harry considered for a moment, wondering if he should involve Ron and Hermione before going to see his rival alone in the dark. Especially when said rival was unconvincingly promising not to hex Harry. He didn't quite trust Malfoy yet, even if they agreed to an armistice. Merlin knew if the boy would pull a First Year and just not show up again.
He shot out of his seat, his chair scraping across the floor behind him. “Detention for what? Telling the truth?”
Unfortunately, what should have been a carefree, sunny day was dampened by that day’s issue of the Daily Prophet. Draco could tell it weighed down on all four of them, as the mention of Sirius being spotted at King’s Cross floated through their minds as blots of ink from the front page.
Hermione stayed silent for a moment, quickly dodging a curse from a glowing dagger that was hidden inside a cloth and had slipped out as she'd picked it up. Unfazed, she wrapped up the dagger again and threw it in to the
It became easy from there, stepping In to the role he'd seen his father take so many times. No one dared oppose him, because at the end of the day, people were  scared of his last name and what it could do. How he'd seen his father speak of muggleborns all his life, he would reflect on to the ones he went to classes with. The things his father had taught him about muggles, he would find in the bad taste in his mouth at the sight of them. All the whisperings and ideas his father threw at him magnified and inflated his sense of self, smug in the fact that he was
"He pleaded he was under the influence of Imperius the entire time. That and gold. Lots and lots of gold."
“Good, too.” Dean said congenially, decked out in his pyjamas that resembled some Quidditch team Harry couldn’t recall. He glanced at Seamus, and Dean also threw a short glance at his friend, “Oi.” Dean prodded Seamus’s side with one of his feet. “You gonna tell Harry about your summer?”
"I'd probably intrude anyways." Harry smiled. "And I'm giving you full permission to speak on my behalf should you need to."
"They seem to be more focused on the Ministry from the inside, for some reason. Arthur and Bill had a lot to say about the security within the lower levels of the Ministry - Seems Bill is there for much more than humble civil service."
So that Friday morning, Draco and Blaise stood inside Snape’s office, eyes glued to their respective wristwatches while their other hands held a chipped teacup Portkey between them.
"Fuck you." Harry hissed, angry for some reason he didn't care to analyse. Who was Draco to dictate where he should go? He could protect himself. Hadn't he been doing so for the last three years?
"You need to get started, Harry! You have around a month, you fool! How you've survived this long is beyond me!"
"Ah, yes. Malfoy, that's right." Remus gave Sirius a side-eye glance, "Who would have thought? A Malfoy defecting…"
But he knew he had to do it now, if not later. If he wanted to be different from his father, he needed to go about mending those rifts his family had caused. He was doing it for himself, mostly, not his sham of a bigot dad. If it made Harry happy too, then why not?
“Yes.” Umbridge said, tone now flat. “Nice to meet you both.” She looked over Pansy as if searching for something wrong with her, eyes lingering on her outstretched hand but never taking it. Pansy slowly retracted her hand, the silence in the room becoming deafeningly loud.
"What, the potion? Harry asked, surprised Ron was encouraging their potion they were bound to mess up yet.
“Me? What did I do?” said Harry quickly. His heart was beating rather fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him. After a moment, the reason for Seamus’s scorn dawned on him.“I… Was this because of the
"I see. We'll make sure to get Potter this time…" His father's voice faded as he and the other men walked away, and Draco took the opportunity to run up the stairs to his room.
The door bust open, and Moody was immediately stunned and bound by Albus Dumbledore. Snape walked in after him, face falling when he looked at Draco.
“I don’t want my magical signature on her stuff, you dolt.” Draco sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. He really was quite hungry, but he needed to get this sorted out first.
He showered quickly, urged by the thought of Malfoy's wand underneath his pillow. Anxiety fled through his veins at the thought that someone might life up his pillow by some odd chance of fate and see the wand. How on earth would he explain that?
A loud, ear-splitting grinding sound stopped him. He looked up to see the houses numbered eleven and thirteen splitting in between themselves. Slowly, they separated to reveal another house in between. On the front was the number 12, ornately detailed in black metal next to a barren looking door.
Ronald hovered in front of the biggest hoop, flailing clumsily to catch a quaffle. He seemed to still be getting the hang of the proper form for moving around on a broom efficiently. Around six times out of ten he would actually manage to prevent the charmed quaffles from scoring, but he also didn’t let that discourage him as he charmed them to fly again and would start from the beginning. Draco admired his tenacity, which one would come to expect from a boy from a family full of Gryffindors.
“I’m thinking long term, Harry.” Draco insisted. “I know stopping my father is probably the first priority, but if I can’t do my job
Harry, who was balancing on the tips of his toes on a chair, sighed frustratedly as he craned forward to get the last of the droppings. "You know," He said, "You could just use your wand and help me with this."
Once wrapped up, Ron pensively packed up his things before saying tentatively, “I think we should discuss things with Hermione first, yeah?”
no Voldemort. It was just your dad, and maybe a couple of other shady guys your dad hung out with. Now it's real, Draco. It's purposely putting yourself in harms way every moment you're around them." Draco noticed his hands beginning to wring in his lap. "You didn't…" Harry voice cracked and he turned his head away from Draco. "He killed him
He expected Harry to at least be a little happy to see him - even a greeting in return would’ve been appreciated - but the boy’s eyes only widened comically when they saw him.
Harry opened his mouth but nothing came out. Immediately, he furrowed his eyebrows irritably, realising Draco was messing with him, and threw open the door, leaving quickly with a muttered, "Damn idiot."
"No, but I did promise to share anything I know with you that one time by the Lake. When we first met after the Ball?"
"They think I'm at his estate. I go there every August anyway to go through the Potions syllabus for the coming year."
Harry scoffed, going to sit next to where Draco was settled. He noticed that the ground had been cleared of all the fallen leaves from the thick Willow tree above them and when he put a hand to the surface, realised there was a small, epidermal barrier that prevented them from actually making contact with the dirt. It was so fractional that it felt as if he were sitting on the ground anyway. Harry said nothing about it, knowing Draco would be too smug about it, clever as he was.
He knew the Potions Professor would have tracked him down eventually, so he decided to save the man the trouble. Normally Draco wouldn't be so averse to seeing Snape, but since it was about him and Potter, Draco was considering throwing himself out in to the Lake just to avoid it.
, Draco." He said, his voice quavering slightly that made Draco's heart sink. "Do you know what he said before he did it?" Draco assumed Harry was talking about Cedric. "He said
All at once, came in the entire Weasley clan, and Harry. Sirius and Remus even made an appearance behind them.
He sent both Ron and Hermione and letter the day before, and only got curt, infuriatingly polite responses. He didn’t want to be asked about how his summer was going, he wanted to know
"I am sorry, though." Draco said, looking at both Weasley and Granger, "For everything I've done…Especially to you, Granger. The things I've said and that one time I jinxed you last year…You did punch me though."
"So, Harry. It seemed more than just talking happened that night of the Ball." Hermione said menacingly. "Care to explain?"
On the other side of Dumbledore, Bill Weasley stood, and Draco had to avoid looking at him the most. As the prolonged silence went on, the man had slowly been unable to keep the lid on his amusement.  Gradually, he had started occasionally clenching his jaw, eyes watering as Draco saw him trying to suppress a laugh. Draco made an extra effort not to glance at him too often, lest he break down and ruin the silent standoff he'd created in the room.
"Well it doesn't look bad. That's one good thing to ever come out of his wand, then." She said appraisingly, both of them ignoring Ron snorting in to his hand again.
Dumbledore, for one of the first times Draco had ever seen, looked at a loss at how to phrase his words.  “I fear that Mr Potter may be… susceptible to more than we currently know because of what happened that night.”
Doing his best not to look like he was running, Harry made his way to Ron and Hermione. He dreaded what they would say to him now that they were a combined force, but thankfully for once, they seemed to be arguing between themselves. Edging nearer, Harry saw it was more than just an argument. Ron and Hermione were flat out verbally sparring. Suddenly he seemed unsure about interrupting, not knowing if he would make the situation worse or not. Just as he was about to go talk find Neville or someone else, he caught Hermione's eyes and she beckoned him over violently.
He glanced at the couples ahead and saw Fleur with someone from Hufflepuff stride on to the dance floor, all grace and flowing ivory robes. To Harry's amusement, he noticed that Fleur and Malfoy's robes looked jarringly similar, save for Fleur's shimmering translucent scarf wrapped around her and majority of her body, dancing behind her as she glided over the floor. Malfoy seemed to have noticed as well, judging by the slight downturn of the corners of his mouth, and Harry barely suppressed a grin.
"Well it's done now." Draco said irritably, "And it's getting late. Thank you, Sirius." He bowed slightly, causing Sirius's eyebrows to shoot up and glance at Harry amusedly. He shrugged back and followed Draco as he went to retrieve the Invisibility Cloak he'd thrown in to a corner. The boy was muttering under his breath to himself in a huff, and Harry watched in silence as he threw the cloak over himself.
"Draco." Ginevra said beside him. She'd been incessantly nagging him for - he checked his watch - twenty minutes now. The girl seemed to have a
"I…" Harry said, gripping his sleeve and head turned away. "I'm sorry for, er, you know. Shouting at you."
he, a supposed Wizard capable of taking down a Dark Wizard as a baby, reject him so outright? What could be possible be so wrong with Draco that he had said no? Harry Potter didn't look much at all, in his old, oversized clothes and wonky glasses. Draco was clearly better than him in every way, or so he believed at the time. Shouldn't it have been the other way around? Why was Draco the one feeling humiliated and left behind, and not Potter?
The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was also an envelope in her hand. “Did you — did you get — ?”
“Miss Granger would bring the emotional aspects into the situation more than her brilliant logical mind, unfortunately. Were it anyone else, I would have surely consulted her, but this time there would be a conflict of interest.”
"Now where in Godric's name do we get some of the stuff?" Harry asked him. Draco blew a strand of hair out of his eyes.
"Uh, Hermione!" Harry blurted, trying to change the subject. She looked at him expectantly, eyebrows raised in a way that reminded him of McGonagall. Did the girl have to resemble every mother figure in his life? "You..Uh - look very pretty." He cleared his throat and waited for her to cuss him out. Luckily, her eyes softened and she said sadly,
Draco just shrugged, turning his back to Ron then throwing a wink at Harry, smirking. Harry glanced at Hermione, who had an amused twitch in the corner of her mouth.
"Cut the shit, Potter. Its obvious to everyone, not just me. You've been glancing at him during meal times ever since the his name came out the Goblet. It's as if you'd never even seen him before. Not that I blame you, though. For a Hufflepuff, he's quite fit."
"A friend." Draco scoffed, not caring if he sounded rude, "This has far to do with than simple friendship."
in order not to trip on his way to their spot. He had a fleeting moment of gratitude over him when he realised he could cast magic freely, equally fighting a quiver when he remembered his Hearing.
Draco shut his eyes. That's exactly what he was afraid of. Nothing about the tournament seemed right.
"Come, come, all of you. Sit." Remus gestured to the chairs around them, and they all moved to sit, Sirius and Remus sat together at the head of the table while Ron and Hermione sat on one side and Harry and Draco on the other. "I'd ask about school but…" Remus trailed off, a solemn look on his face. "But other than that, how were your summers?"
"Oh, ho, ho! Someone's cranky, today! Not sleeping well? Or are you still fainting like a sick doe every so often?"
Ron and Hermione didn't move, both of their mouths actually agape and the room so quiet that Harry could hear the faint murmurings of the meeting in the next room.
"I do - or I did. It's complicated. I just…" He leant back on his hands, surprising Harry again when he saw Malfoy's palms curling up in the soft earth. "He never speaks to me much. He just taught me about politics and etiquette and all that other Pureblood crap when I was a child. That was the most he ever spoke to me in his life during those lessons."
"You can't tell me what to do, Draco." Harry said hotly, clenching his fists in his lap. Draco's laid back posture didn't change, but his face was tightly lipped and cold.
Walking back to the Hospital Wing underneath the cloak was one of the most deviously fun things Draco had done in a while, and he'd stolen Gillyweed from Snape's office a few months before.
Harry shrugged, trying to look as laid back as possible. Inside, his heart was thundering and he was feeling pretty sorry for whichever elf was going to wash his shirt later. This was it. There was no going back. Merlin, Draco might actually kill him for this.
"Yes, Blaise! I do!" Draco erupted. Taking a deep breath, he pinched the bridge of his nose trying to calm down. He gave himself a moment, then continued.
It took all of him not to look as incredibly pleased as he felt, and he and his friends filed out the stands as Harry was swallowed by the adoring crowds.
“Well, we’ll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won’t we?” she said, finally letting go of his hand.  “You may go.”
Seamus laughed, "It's not a bad thing, Harry. It's a good scary. The girls like that sort of thing." And Dean nodded in agreement. Ron was still engrossed in deciding where to direct his last rook, and took no notice of the conversation. Hermione, however… Harry could feel her gaze on the back of his neck so much he got goosebumps.
"I don't usually get offered food." Potter said, something in his voice sounding tight. He curled his arms around his knees tighter and rested his chin on them. Frustratingly, he still didn't touch the food. Draco had no idea why, or what weird complex the boy had but it prevented him from eating food when, what…someone gave it to him? Regardless of what it was, something hot coiled in his stomach at the thought. Food was something people should always make time for if they could, regardless of whether they were hungry or not. It was one of the things magic couldn't replace so it was incredibly important. It was fuel, and disrespectful to the body by depriving it.
At least none of them spoke to him. None of them except Dudley. He would sometimes stop on his way down the hall and taunt Harry through the door, but that was it. On odd days, though, he's spend it out in the house doing work or in the garden wandering aimlessly. Sometimes he just forgot he
They reached the secluded point, then he automatically took his mothers offered arm to apparate. With a tight pop in his gut, they were immediately in front of his home, Malfoy Manor. It stood as tall as always, black marble ingesting the sun setting behind it. It was a dreadfully dreary place, he knew that. If he didn't know any better it could have just screamed
“Now, once you’ve got it where it needs to be, then you must be completely sure of where it’s been put!” Lancaster explained excitedly.
"Good. See how you were almost hit by that spell - almost a second too late. You spent too much time turning your body to the spell when you could have been blocking it. Turn back to how you were." His father commanded.  Draco went back to the position he was in before, his father still to his far left.
“I know, Ron.” Harry sighed, sipping the smooth foam that collected on top of the butterbeer. “I just want to keep it lowkey for now, alright?”
“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.” Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward them, her stubby fingered hands splayed on her desk. “You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead —”
Hermione had unfortunately heard what Draco had said, her frown deepening at him. Ron, meanwhile, rolled his eyes at Harry.
"I'm glad I'm alive, too, Severus." He crossed his arms over his chest, sitting up over his tray of food brought in earlier through a spontaneous pop from thin air.
hi! I'm a bit excited this week because this chapter is or was supposed to be posted on the 27th, which is this fic's one year anniversary!!! exactly one year ago today, I randomly posted the first chapter of this fic and now I'm all the way at 160K words with lots and lots of people who somehow like what I write.
“Ow! Prat!” Harry hissed. Draco ignored him, eyes roving over the desk hungrily. It was undercover work, that’s it. His curiosity was sound… It was for the Order…
"You've barely tolerated anything, and I'll have you know that end of year exams are coming up, and I have the right
"So as I said earlier, anyone gives you grief about him or anything else, I'll set them straight, alright?"
Hours later saw Pansy in the boys dorms, sitting on the bed across from Draco's bed, and clearing her throat.
As the seriousness of this conversation overcame him, Draco widened his eyes but nodded, because he did remember. He would never forget that awful night, or the only horrible lie he had ever told his mother. Draco’s father had been worried his mother would leave him if she ever found out how that had happened. Draco had thought his father was being ridiculous but agreed nonetheless because his father certainly knew her better than Draco did.
They were both standing. His mother had the journal under a spell, floating in the air between them. "Do you really not have anything else to say for yourself?" his mother was hissing.
"He did not!" Harry burst. "He was just teasing me, I think. Besides he implied that Voldemort torturing him into a twitching bloody mess didn't do it for him."
“Surely, we can have one civil conversation," Blaise chuckled. "I just want to know your opinion on Potter’s . . . affection toward Draco.”
The kettle went off and Draco poured hot water in all three cups, carefully placing the saucer on top of his and Bear's tea for safe steeping; he was confident that Linky could handle her own at this point. A few minutes later he replaced them under the cups and gave both of their teas a dash of sugar, swirling with his spoon just once in each while thinking about the glowing green potion and the lockbox.
Harry sucked in a big breath and decided to just go for it. He stood and kicked his boxers all the way off; his cock bobbing in front of Malfoy’s face with the movement. Harry gently stood Malfoy up and dragged their bodies together, relishing in the feel of Malfoy’s tiny body and sharp angles against his own pliant flesh. Harry brought their mouths together and Draco moaned so brokenly as their tongues touched.
Harry absently shook his head, no, he wasn't breathing. He hadn't taken a breath since Malfoy appeared.
Potter froze and gazed at Draco, seemed to contemplate the meaning behind Draco’s words. Fucking Potter!
of his parent’s secret rooms. His mother had secret cabinets in the west wing and his father had two hidden galleries in the north wing and some smaller chambers scattered throughout.
Upon waking up together, with sweat-stained clothes the only barrier between their aching bodies, Ginny and Draco didn’t say a word about their drunken agreement. They just honored it.
Harry groaned and ripped the piece from his ear. “Oh yeah, because that’s how you woo Hermione, is it?” hissed Harry, before quickly tossing it into the toilet and flushing (he knew Ron wasn’t entirely to blame for this mess, but he was the reason Harry found himself bold enough to be where he was). Harry turned back to find Malfoy blankly watching him, one pale eyebrow arched high. “Don’t give me that look, Malfoy. Just keep going.”
The third day found Draco still beating down his own nervous energy with Snape’s poem, though he knew he was closer than ever to solving it. Draco was sitting on a stool reading over the words for the thousandth time when he decided to give up and turn to his mother’s methods. It was not guilt making him do it, either.
Hermione nodded thoughtfully, and he pat her back twice before leaving the room. He made his way past the door where Draco had met the Order earlier, which seemed to still be in use, so he tip toed just to be safe.
"It just…all they do is worry about me. I know it comes from a good place, but all they want to do is go to Dumbledore for every little thing. Sometimes I can't even tell them if my scar really
"That was just him being an idiot." Harry smiled slightly. "But on that first night on Yule, he said it himself with the most honesty I've ever seen on a person: I want no one dead for it. He looked sick, Hermione, at the thought of his father almost being responsible for those petrifications in Second Year. Sick at the thought of those possible deaths, and it occurred to me that maybe he wasn't as evil as I thought he was. He looked like a kid, not some sort of big scary dark lord."
"It's all your fault." Draco said offhandedly, instead focusing closely on Harry all of a sudden. His eyes were roving somewhere over his shoulder for some reason, and Harry whipped around to see if anyone was behind them.
"Merlin." Draco sat back on his hands, "How on earth did you get one of those? No wonder you get away with creeping around the school like a ghost."
"Which is why he's gathering all sorts of people this time around." Sirius said, crossing his arms, "He's trying to recruit not just people, but creatures. Giants, Goblins, the likes."
you swore together?" Hermione raised an eyebrow coldly, and Harry saw Draco stiffen in the corner of his eye.
"-weapon." Ron said at the same time as Draco, the two looking at each other in recognition for a few moments.
"But 'We've taken what you'll sorely miss'? That could be anything." He trailed off for a moment, tapping his quill on his parchment. "Maybe your wands? Maybe they'll disarm you. Or maybe it's a metaphor, like taking your breath away?"
"So what does this have to do with Dumbledore himself?" Draco asked, face serious and expressing complete attention to the matter at hand.
Draco laughed, "Please, you've been looking his way this whole time. Not to mention your little proclamation of
"Will you, Draco?" He repeated, maybe even a bit louder than before. The red wires danced between them, and he knew he must have looked a sight as their red light sent daunting shadows over his face.
After another awkward tea with his mother, Draco collapsed in to his room and it took all his willpower to drag himself for a bath before bed.
Not having time to cast another, he jumped and rolled to the side. He came up on to his knees in time to block another purple hex that smelled like burnt toast. His eyes lost the spot on his father's robes so he cast quick hex that was meant to cause boils to spread over his father's skin. It was blocked easily, but he took the quick moment to find another spot to focus on.
"Dumbledore." Hermione said, seeming to be on the same train of thought. "Dumbledore is one of the only wizards who can rival him, not to mention the only one he actually fears. He must be planning a way to get him out of the way."
What felt like moments after his strange dream ended did he startle awake. His eyes popped open to the familiar green water outside his windows. Knowing that looking out any of the windows in the Slytherin dorms gave no indication of the time of day, he turned over to his watch and saw that it was too outrageously early to be up on a Wednesday. It seemed that nap he took the day before as well as the early night was catching up to him, and he had hours before class and was totally bloody awake. He was awake at around the same time he and Potter left the Lake the previous day, and Draco decided to get up in hopes he might see the sun rise again.
Blaise’s expression turned sour, but he didn’t reply for a moment before saying, “Fine. I’m not particularly looking to get arrested anyway.”
“What’s the matter? Kneazle got your-” Draco started irritably, walking further into the room before his line of sight passed a stone pillar that had been obscuring another girl standing next to Harry. “
, Potter." He said venomously through a dazzling smile. Harry certainly tried his best, and once they reached the empty spot on the floor, the delicate music started and all the couples started to dance.
Draco watched Harry and Cedric run in to the maze, instantly obscuring them from view. Not long after, Fleur and Krum went in behind them. The cheers went down after that. Now all they could do was watch the maze until someone shot red sparks or found the Cup wherever it was.
"So that's why he did it, then?" She asked, understanding dawning in her eyes. "Do you think he fears he could mess things up?"
“Brilliant,” Draco remarked, settling his chin on his hand. “So these guidebooks are at every level?”
"Yeah. He tried to help me with the egg. I refused, though. It felt weird to get help from a teacher."
The last slivers of sunlight were disappearing beneath the stands of the Pitch, reminding Draco of where he was meant to be and urging him to continue down the halls. He made his way with purpose until he came to a stop in front of an ugly, stone Gargoyle statue.
Harry sung his praises to Molly Weasley for picking his sleek black robes. Unlike many other wizards, Harry deigned not to go fully starkers underneath and decided to wear his uniform shirt and black slacks underneath. He almost thought it a mistake and the bloody robes almost suffocated him with it's stifling heat. Harry decided to just fuck it and unbutton the front, allowing air to mercifully cool the sweat clinging to his shirt at the back.
They stepped in to the entrance hall, where they were met with one of the house elves that took Draco's school trunk to his room and his mother's outer robes to hang up. Softly, she turned to him and placed a hand on his cheek before leaving to east wing of the house where she usually spent her days. He watched her go, dread filling up his entire body and his mind not really functioning coherently.
pile, hearing a chorus of tortured wails erupting off of it as soon as it made contact with the other books.
She looked back at Ron with a cleverly conjured frown, "I'm not telling you, you'll just make fun of me."  Ron huffed and turned around to say something else before his gaze wavered and a disgusted scowl found his face.
"Don't say anything." Draco said, eyes shut and pinching the bridge of his nose. "He was right. All of it."
Draco made an appalled noise, but poured himself a cup anyway, and took a sip. Harry was right; it was nice, and also, it tasted like grass. Would wonders never cease.
In the summer, with children coming to buy their wands, Harry was so busy he had to hire a shop assistant. He hired a Hogwarts student, Ellie Greenteeth, whose parents were both Healers at St Mungo’s. She was intelligent and friendly and reminded him of Hermione, her head in a book every time she had a spare minute. She was in Slytherin. She’d told him so with her chin held high, daring him to assume she ate kittens for dessert or something, but Harry only nodded.
“But I need your opinion on something.” Ginny nodded. “There’s a memory. Something Harry can’t bear to think about.”
“Is that Molly Weasley’s shortbread I smell?” she asked, ignoring the chair for a moment. “Ah, so it is.” She took a lion, and took her seat, and Harry sat as well — on that side of his desk, since it seemed quite ridiculous to have the head of the Auror Office across a desk from him.
“I want to kiss every inch of you,” Harry said, climbing up onto the bed, kissing Draco’s hip. “Fuck, d’you know what you look like.”
“That would be the one. There was a ball that Christmas. He took me, but he ignored me all night. Still, he’s a good man. I hope you… Well, you know what I hope. We’d all be dead without him.”
“Ouch,” he shouted, as Persephone bit his earlobe. “Sodding horror. I’ll feed you to a Hippogriff if you’re not a little more respectful. I don’t care who your fancy-pants mistress is.” Persephone hooted again, annoyed, but refusing to move from her spot on the back of a dining chair alongside the one Draco was sitting on, pretending to be all casual and smooth.
“Son of Salazar,” Draco swore. He stood staring at the door for a long moment, and then heard the unmistakable sound of one of the portraits clearing his throat. He glanced up at Severus Snape, and tried not to glower. “Oh, leave it, Sev,” he said, his eyes narrowed. “I know what you’re thinking. I know what you want to say.”
“I’m not your Mind Healer. I’m Harry’s.” He picked absently at a stray bit of lint on his trousers, although Hermione was certain he was just giving her a break from that relentlessly calm grey gaze. “And I’m not making any judgement,” he lied, like a lying liar. “I’m merely trying to understand what is happening here. Do you know if he ever sought any kind of help to recover from the abuse?”
"Sirius was framed by Pettigrew, and he came back to Hogwarts to find him but everyone thought he was after me."
“Looks like a bitch.” Pansy muttered gravely. “No sane woman wears that much pink without things to hide.”
He didn't understand what was happening. He had felt fine until then. He was content with life, and was so excited for his first day of Hogwarts until Harry Potter rejected his handshake. Rejected his
" He said proudly. That's what broke Malfoy a second time, a small laugh escaping his lips. He stopped laughing almost immediately, and glared at Harry.
"Hi guys." He said, and awarded by puzzled expressions from both. "Potions first, right? Let's be off before we're late." He started walking ahead of them, a little too much bounce in his step.
have given me the password to the Prefects Bathroom for specific Tournament purposes." Potter said smugly, and Draco erupted.
Draco rolled his eyes, "My partner in Potions? Tall, fairly handsome, has gold earrings in for some reason…"
"Oh, shut up, Potter! You're insufferably intolerable!" The voice was farther away now, and Harry saw the privacy screens around his bed lift up. "See you
." Draco scoffed, "I'm not that scary, and besides, if I am it's only because of my family's reputation."
“Yes, Professor McGonagall.” Harry nodded solemnly. With a curt nod and an expression that seemed to soften, she let them go to collect their things. They travelled carefully through the halls in case anyone might spot them together.
"It doesn't sound like something Cedric would do, to be quite honest. He's a Hufflepuff, you know. I would have been more on guard if it was someone from another house-"
"I regret nothing." Harry shot back, rubbing his right hand with the phantom feeling of magic on his skin.
"And will you, under your best ability, act under pretenses for Voldemort and his followers but never willingly part take in their cause unless under threat of harm or your life?"
"And you said yes?" Blaise asked, now heavily invested in the situation. Draco hummed and Blaise drew a sharp intake of breath.
Harry, the git, laid down where he was sitting and closed his eyes, "Bugger. A nap sounds great, Draco. Wake me up when the sun sets, please." He said sweetly, and Draco whacked him once in the stomach.
In a sharp turn of events, Harry’s third day of detention went without a hitch. Apart from his curt “Good evening” and “Good night.”, no words were exchanged between him and Umbridge. The woman stayed uncharacteristically silent, even when he tilted back on his chair and rocked it forwards with a loud thump a few times throughout the evening. If Harry didn’t know better, he would have assumed it was both of them being punished, just being in that room together.
Hearing a short sigh from McGonagall, he looked back at her. She took off her reading glasses and clasped her hands over her desk. “Assuming the way Mr. Potter is currently digging a whole through my floor like a jackhammer,” Draco narrowed his eyes, not knowing what that was, “I take it that what the letter said was true?”
Harry angrily stabbed his hand in the air, but not before Umbridge was already answering the question of another student. Upon closer inspection, Draco realised it was one of the two girls who would have taken Harry to the Yule Ball.
“A connection, though?” Draco crossed his arms over his chest again, but this time it was to fight off the chill that the idea spurred on his body. “What would that mean, exactly?”
Draco wondered if Harry had dreams about that night like he himself often had. They didn't happen much, and for once Draco was glad for the rigorous activity he did during the day that made him too tired to even dream at night.
The grass hedges were now well on their way to being as tall as Hagrid himself, and Draco knew they would only get taller before the task. He looked over the same areas and spots in the hedges as for the last hour. The hedges were made of a distinct ivy like plant that was characteristically fast-growing and strong. Draco had finally found something similar to how it looked in a Herbology textbook, and found out they were from the
Draco shrugged, “Not too bad, actually. Seven are the usual Sacred Twenty-Eights relations - none less distant than a second cousin to the main lines, though. One half-blood, three regular Purebloods and one Muggleborn.”
“It’s cool, Ron,” Harry said, confused why his friend was so jumpy about trying out for the team. “We could play together, yeah? You any good?”
He clambered through the stand, gaining lots of dirty looks and utters of annoyance that he ignored. He made his way down, not knowing what he was doing or what he was thinking.
Ron collapsed in to a fit of giggles, and Harry side-elbowed him but couldn't hold in the laugh of his own. At Draco's glare however, he quickly wiped off the grin on his face.
“S’ afternoon.” Harry mumbled with his head down, still wary of the stares he could feel on the back of his neck.
This time Blaise opened up the gate and glanced around. Draco briefly wondered what the difference was between floors six and seven, but his train of thought was stopped by the room they were walking into.
"Shut up. Bloody pessimist." He said. Draco caught the paper from the air, laughing and setting it into one of his textbooks safely away from the boy.
Harry leant in even further, the room becoming still around them. He uttered lowly, feeling the words roll off his tongue similar to if he were speaking Parseltongue, “I also disappeared on the night of June the 24th along with Cedric Diggory, wherein upon return his heart had already stopped beating.”
"I mean…" Harry trailed off hesitantly, rubbing the back of his neck. "How long were you in there for?"
"At least you don't have to deal with child-minding a literal hag, Weasley." Draco said. "That and risking my life spying for you lot, as well as achieving all the O.W.L.S I want…" Draco trailed off for a moment worriedly. "Merlin, why am I here, again?"
They both started and ran inside, leaving the crowd behind them. The roars and cheers became muffled, but still audible. They came to a clearing that split two ways. Harry looked at Cedric and saw decision in the boys eyes. He knew what they would do. Nodding at each other, they turned opposite each other and went their separate ways.
Malfoy still looked strange. His eyebrows were relaxed and the enchanted snow settled on his face, but he didn't seem to care.  He nodded, his gaze turning back to somewhere Harry couldn't point out.
Harry shook his head regretfully at Malfoy, and the boy begun to reiterate, "Well I can't exactly tell anyone else my father might be becoming a death eater. Especially not the Slytherins." Malfoy added, as if reading Harry's mind, "Who better than someone who already knows? And I need
"Explain everything later, Harry - or rather Ron will. See you later lads!" Fred only gave a smirk and a glance a his twin before Disapparating with a loud crack.
The other portraits on the stairwell begin to scream as well, and Harry clapped his hands over his ears as Draco screwed his eyes at the noise in confusion. The woman seemed to be staring at him specifically, and after all the breath had seemingly been screamed out, did she begin to form coherent words.
Harry picked up one of Draco's spare parchments laying around and chucked it at him. The effect was dampened as the paper just wafted through the air and glided around Draco.
"I'm…" He said, feeling something catch in his throat. What did he want to say? Why couldn't he say it if he knew? "I'm just…"
"Not the covers." Draco said. "Inside. Gossip sections. Politics. Wherever they can. After Dumbledore's speech, talk of Voldemort coming back spiked panic. The papers are trying to make you look even more insane and now they're trying to do the same to Dumbledore, calling him senile and all of it a hoax. It's probably the Ministry's doing, trying to downplay his comeback."
"What?" Pansy asked, "I don't get it. We were talking about Potter weren't we…" She trailed off as it slowly dawned on her. She stared at Draco in shock. "Draco, you're joking."
Pansy looked at him delightedly when she saw him, "Draco! Man of the hour! Many of us were just discussing you and a certain-"
He shut the compartment door, nearly bumping in to Blaise behind him as he'd forgotten the boy was still there.
Draco scoffed, saying nothing and instead turning to lay over the arms of the chair, his head resting on one end and feet hanging off the other.
At that thought, he poised his quill again to write. He wanted to know how Harry was. What he was doing with those muggle relatives of his. Did he feel lonely? Did his friends write to him?
Harry leant back, throwing an arm over his eyes. The room was still spinning slightly and he hastily tried to dispel the nausea that was causing his stomach to stir. He had nothing left to bloody throw-up, for Merlin’s sake. If only the dizziness would go away.
Just before everyone had filed out of their Potions class, Draco quickly took out the triangle note Harry had thrown and scribbled something on the back. He folded it up as best he could in to the neat little shape it was, then tried his best to catch Harry's eye.
"Better be bloody worth the trouble." Harry heard him mutter, although he wasn't sure if Ron was talking about Hermione's situation or Harry's.
Draco narrowed his eyes at the man. “So, you’re spinning tales that don’t have anything to do with reality-”
"Molly is a pleasure, but I'll be glad to never hear about my 'peakiness' every again. I tried to tell her, but she just
Harry looked at him side-along, their eyes finally meeting, "It hasn't been that long, has it?" He smiled teasingly.
"Shut it, wanker. You created a monster that has their wand this time around." Draco said warningly, but Potter just snorted infuriatingly.
But when he did have them, it was Moody's wand pointed at him and the sound of someone screaming that he couldn't place to a face he knew. He shut his eyes quickly and took a deep shuddering breath.
"Erm, lunch is ready!" Harry said quickly before Draco had the chance to comment on S.P.E.W further. He started to the kitchen in hopes that the rest would follow, and was relieved to hear them pattering behind him as Ron and Hermione bickered about something.
"Regardless!" Draco bellowed, interrupting what Blaise was going to say. He climbed out of his blankets and stood on his bed, silk pajamas blazing in all his Malfoy glory and his hands outstretched around him.
Umbridge leant back in her seat at her desk, as if stunned that Hermione had the nerve to even utter the words she’d said.
When he opened them again, he exhaled steadily, and begun to write. A stable resolve resided itself in his mind, and his train of thought wondered down one path as he wrote down another on the parchment. The path led to a name. A root imbedded deep in the fallow soil he was stuck in.
Around him, he could see Ginny and a few other recognisable faces of his House in the corner of his eyes. His heart jumped momentarily at the sight of his friends, but the energy around them felt off, so he kept his head low.
Draco waved them away quickly. “Drop the sir, you’ll make me feel like my father. Now go on. Bother someone else.”
Harry caught his breath and laid down the same way he did the day before when he had fallen asleep. He closed his eyes but didn't let himself fall in to oblivion, instead letting the cool night's breeze sift through his hair on the ground.
“Look, Harry.” Draco said softly, “I know it’s difficult because of everything that happened, but losing your head won’t do you any good in getting back at him for it eventually. You need to channel everything into something that will help, alright?”
It might hurt Draco, though, and that was the problem. He wondered how he was with his father. Harry shuddered at the uncomfortable chill over his spine as he remembered seeing Lucius Malfoy standing proudly at the graveyard that night. He wouldn't know how he could even be in a room with such a person, let alone them being your father as well.
kind of harmless. He grinded his teeth together, incredibly annoyed but plastering a fake smile on his face so the man would just
He grit his teeth in frustration. He didn’t know the...etiquette for muggle-borns in Slytherin. It almost never happened, so he’d never been exposed to it. It was quite an ironic event, not to mention a cruel one at that…
"Wish she was here right now." Ron said. Harry chuckled, rubbing his forehead with a long sigh, fingers bumping on his scar. The chair wasn't meant for two people, so Ron and Harry were squashed together and the wooden arm was digging in to his side. It seemed he was destined for a life of pain.
“You two can play together! Oh, you were a rather good Keeper at the Burrow with the twins, weren’t you, Ron?”
He sat down on one of the benches, only to realise Pansy and Blaise were still standing, discussing something amongst themselves like they were parents called in to discuss about Draco in the Headmaster's office.
"You shouldn't be in this Tournament. You're just a boy." Draco said to him, so softly it could have been wind rushing past Harry's ears.
This time, he found Ron waiting for him as he walked to Myrtle’s bathroom - not needing to be sick as he’d had to for the two days prior, but just to wash the excess blood, both new and dried, off his hand.
this!" Draco felt a stab of pity for Nott. Blaise never usually raised his voice, but right then he knew things were only going to go downhill for Nott. He kept his eyes closed and surreptitiously tried to reach for his wand on his desk, but…
The Doxies came fluttering out of the drawer at once, and Draco took to the tactic of running away and spraying behind himself at the same time as one chased him, which seemed to amuse the Weasley twins to an infuriatingly severe degree.
Harry scoffed at that and decided to leave the issue for the time being, getting up from the chair and stretching deeply.  "Well I'm in Gryffindor, luckily for you." He said, shooting Ron a sly grin. The other boy shoved him lightly, but said nothing in a silent agreement to let the matter lie.
Harry looked at his shoes, nodding, "I understand. They're cunning and self-preserving and will do anything to win." He looked up at Sirius, knowing where his choices lay and trust had been placed, "But they're also loyal. Draco doesn't need to change. His loyalties lay in the same place as mine. I can swear it on my parents, if you'd ask me to."
"She may just trust you." Dumbledore said. "My sources say that no matter her position, she always keeps a close circle of people whom she works with to delegate tasks. I'm going on the assumption that as a teacher, things won't be so different."
"You'd better! I'm this close to beating the shit out of you!" And Harry immediately cut him off by covering his mouth with his hand. Draco's eyes widened, seething.
It wasn't until Potter asked him to the Ball that that indifference begun to crack. Potter infuriated him to no end, but the usual painful feeling he got when he saw him had just begun to fade away by that point. As soon as he'd asked, though, all those feelings came back with full force and
"Really?" Harry gaped, "I thought you would both hate me actually. Maybe even check me for Imperius."
The next few days, at Draco's expense, were indeed spent cleaning that forsaken house. The four of them worked, sometimes alongside Molly Weasley and Sirius, to remove whatever cursed objects, or Merlin forbid,
"I don't know, Hermione. He said I practically forced him to. Must be some Slytherin power play or something."
Harry stiffened as he saw the words appear on the page in a deep red ink despite there being none on the quill. His right hand began to sting for some reason, and he swiped it down his robes irritably before writing the next line.
"My mother is…she does love me, I think. She just isn't as ominous about her affections. We never hug or anything like that….Oh shit. Look at me complaining about my
"You waited for me?" Harry asked Malfoy's retreating figure. He didn't open his eyes to check, but rather heard the boy's footsteps halt. He stayed silent for heartbeat or two.
“I’ll make sure nobody sees, I promise. I just need you to get in. Just this once, and whatever you want, I’ll get it for you.”
Harry glanced at the three other Weasley's who were engrossed in their own heated debate, so Harry looked back between his friends and sighed. "I know. I'm really sorry, guys." He muttered, head bowed. "I shouldn’t have had a go at you."
"Draco, you look like shit." Blaise muttered, leaning in. Draco weighed his options on how to reply, not wanting to possibly anger the boy again. He hadn't quite planned an excuse for why he might have looked marginally sub-par in appearance than usual. Of course, he wouldn't have needed to if he had his wand to cast at least a few glamour charms on himself. He just shrugged and acted like the butter on his croissant required the utmost precision.
Harry opened the door, letting the yellow hall lights spill in to the room, before turning back quickly, "Wait," he said with realisation, "You just did magic!"
"Oh come off it, Pans." Blaise said, "They really like each other. Right, Theo? Can't put a label on
“It is not about right or wrong or truth or non-truth.” McGonagall said sternly. “It is about keeping yourself in control!”
Draco frowned. Was Sirius really risking making an appearance here? Hadn't he said his Animagus cover was blown? What if his father saw-?
Draco stared at the hand for a few moments before taking it and shaking firmly. The girl had an unwavering grip.
Transfigurations was no better. McGonagall spent half of the first hour rigorously reminding them all yet again of the standards that they were to uphold in preparation for their upcoming exams. It didn’t help that they were moving on to Bodily Transfigurations in class, which was one of the parts of the subject Harry did particularly the worst at.
Eventually, the voices hushed and he actually heard the soft murmur of Harry's voice, making his heart jump. Footsteps started up again, and they all approached the kitchen.
Draco watched his two friends emotionlessly, waiting for them to finish. When they had eventually managed to die down and Draco was sure nothing would set them off again, he asked evenly, “So you think Umbridge was antsy because of Potter?”
It wasn’t all in vain, at least. He heaved one last time, his stomach having nothing else to give. Looking up in the mirror, he saw nothing nice at all. His glasses were crooked and there was vomit smeared on his chin. It was disgusting. He felt absolutely terrible and his body seemed to only punish him for it even more.
"Of course." He replied, and he meant it. He didn't know how he would have gotten through the summer's with the Dursley's without their letters.
Hermione just sighed, rubbing her face again. "Don't be. I just wish you…talked about it with us first."
"No!" Draco shouted next to him, throwing himself in front of Harry with an expression that looked as if every movement caused him pain. Harry knew that look. He had it too, at that moment, but the adrenaline running through his veins numbed him from the pain almost completely.
to take me to the ball. If he were to back out, he would be admitting defeat. And since he's a useless muggle-raised Gryffindor, he won't know how to uphold any amount of class at all, setting himself up for disaster as he humiliates himself right next the sharp contrast of dignified, pureblood
Dean seemed to be dressed ready as he sat idly on his bed, but was unfortunately waiting for Seamus, resulting in all three as late as Ron and Harry were.
"Granted, I'm no less than surprised. But you can't really help it, can you? It's not your fault. You shouldn't be in this Tournament in the first place." He said noncommittally, as if he were talking about the weather. Harry thought about the words for a bit.
"Not telling." He winked secretively, and Ron clenched his fists. "Sorry, Ron. I just can't." Harry said. He wanted to preserve the spot as much as he could, save for Draco's presence. It was the one place at Hogwarts where he could really get away. "So we'd bump in to each other there sometimes. Of course, we had to talk to each other at some point, so we did. Now we just talk a bit more like actual people. Since the truce, I didn't really have a reason to have anything against him unless he started with the bigotry bullshit again. He hasn't said anything like it since to me, though, so I've got no reason to hate him like I did before. I guess he's also trying, so he's not been bad to me either. He's not that bad when he's not being a prat, actually."
," He looked up at Harry, pupils blown but not quite even looking at him properly, "And who better than Harry Potter to carry mine."
"For being…like this." Harry said between heaves of his chest. He hated the way his voice sounded. It was small, too quiet and something he hadn't heard in a while.
“Yes, ma’am.” Draco said dutifully, smirking slightly just for show and scooting through the row of students into the aisle. He forced himself not to look at Harry or his friends directly, but managed to give a small sneer and muttered, “Hurry up, Potty.”
"It'd be annoying. And I can take care of myself that much." Draco said, answering his rhetorical question out loud.
"Never been surer in my life." Draco said, the dazed grin on his face faded. "We can do it. Come on, Harry." He looked at him intently, hoping he understood how important it was to Draco. "If not for you, then for me. I'll be at the Manor this summer…my father will be there. I'm not sure what he has in store for me yet, but I need the reassurance. I'm not….brave, like you are."
“Seamus-” Dean got up and grabbed the boy by the arm harshly, whispering so harshly that everyone in the room could practically hear it. “Let’s not hound him.”
"Why would he say those things? Why attack Viktor?" Harry ran his hands roughly through his short hair.
"I've told you this already!" Draco said as if it was common sense, "My father took my Trace off when I turned fourteen. It's not exactly the most legal, however…"
. Not even a bloody letter. If he didn't have his wand with him, he might have thought he was a muggle with a weird wizard fantasy for nine months of the year.
"You lot!" Draco barked, and they both jumped like kneazles thrown in cold water. "Am I nice?" He demanded, crossing his arms. The Third Years nodded quickly, and Draco turned to Blaise triumphantly. "See?"
"He already did." Potter said. Draco's head whipped to his in turn, making contact with Potter's eyes fully for the first time that morning.
"Well you do." Malfoy said, taking on his usual know-it-all tone that Harry was more familiar with. "It's terribly annoying to look at you because of it, sometimes."
"I'm sorry." The boy whispered back, and Harry drew back a bit with Draco still in his arms to look at him face to face.
It was nice. That's all he could think. The letter was really, really nice. It was the most personal thing that had been said to him in a while. Hermione always was a bit robotic in her responses, and Ron was…Ron in his letters. Draco's letter was almost like he was sitting right next to him and having a conversation. Harry could almost hear the words as if spoken aloud by him.
"Yeah." Harry chuckled softly. "People think I'm round the bend nowadays. That hag Skeeter's no help. They think I do it all for attention, and this Tournament's done nothing to get me out of that."
"Oh. Malfoy." Sirius sighed, putting away his wand. This was shocking. Was Draco not enough of a threat for him? He'd wasn't the scariest bloke in the world, but he definitely wasn't
“No!” Harry burst out, holding out a hand. “It’s, erm, fine.” He took a biscuit out of the tartan and started to nibble at it. Draco just stared at him incredulously.
When Harry finally got his chance to speak, he was pretty sure he'd never spoken so much without a breath in between in his life. He told Sirius everything since the Yule Ball, and by the time he was done, he was panting for breath.
“Are we really going to go through this again?” Harry asked, crossing his arms over his chest. There was a moment of fear that she would get angry at the implication of Cedric’s death being because of Voldemort, just like she had a few days before, but luckily she seemed too stricken to react even normally. “What I’m trying to say,” Harry continued, “is that I know far more than you think. I was there that night-”
"Potter, are you alright?" Potter's eyes finally flicked to his, the green irises and red whites making him look feral and so unlike the usual person he saw. Draco felt the urge to ask what was wrong one more time when Potter smiled weakly and shook his head.
His face stayed neutral and he stayed silent. Umbridge said nothing more, settling back in her seat, and neither did he.
After dinner that day, Harry made his way to the Lake in case he might catch Malfoy there. He made his way under the willow tree and saw that he was in luck.
They both walked quickly down to the dorms to get their books for the day, steps heavy with the lingering chill of Umbridge’s classroom.
Harry gaped at himself in the mirror. He never cut his hair like that! The sides were shorter than the top of his head, where his unruly black hair was shorter than before but still messy and unkempt. It didn't look necessarily bad, but he wasn't going to tell Malfoy that.
"Right. Well done." And Draco's mouth almost fell open from the sudden praise he never got from the man.
"You two, I swear. It says in the introduction that the Ocular Replenishing Potion is a restorative supplement for one's tired, distressed or dry eyes. It's mostly a medicinal potion, but people brew it at home too." She said, finding the page she wanted and stabbing a finger at one of the crowded paragraphs. "If you had read it, you would been able to include in your notes that the appearance In colour of the potion isn't necessary to be stated, only whether it has the desired effect."
More friends than Harry could count. More than he wanted to count. Counting those present meant counting those who had died. One of the many reasons Harry never liked to celebrate his birthday. Somehow, celebrating it several days late made the hurt less.
“I see a match, here, that could raise the profile of the Malfoy line, and — please hear me, darling, when I tell you this matters much more to me — one that could make you happy. I’ll leave you with that thought; he’s almost here,” she said, crossing the space and opening the door to greet him before he had even managed to knock. “Harry, dear,” she said, stepping back to let him inside.
The mug of coffee was broken, on the floor, as were the shards of the mirror he had thrown it at. He looked like he was trying to appear collected, even disinterested, but he was shaking.
“Er,” he said. “Hullo again, Mrs Malfoy. And Professor Malfoy.” He let himself be led to a chair, but was somehow unable to sit. Not the Draught of Living Death, then, someone had merely stuck a pole up his arse. Draco felt his lip curl; it was very satisfying, to see someone who had repeatedly beaten — and then
There was nothing in the world that made him feel freer than flying, or younger. He didn’t bother with caution; it was much more fun to hurtle himself high into the sky, body crouched low against the broom so he could pick up some real speed. Draco could scarcely feel his face, the air was so cold; he could, however, feel that he was grinning.
There was absolutely no good reason for it. But rather than fudge an answer of some kind or, worse, tell the truth — Draco ignored the question.
“Mum.” Draco laughed. “I don’t think I’ve ever called her that in my life. And no, I haven’t had any suspicious post. Unless you’d count a cashmere sweater from Belarus. It’s a lovely shade of green. You’ll remember I’m partial to green.” He enjoyed the way Harry’s cheeked burned. “Once a Slytherin, always a Slytherin. I’m sorry, did I interrupt something?”
Topher frowned. “Yes. No!” He pulled a bottle of Firewhiskey from the pantry, and Summoned a couple of mugs. He seemed a bit more real, suddenly, and Ron felt himself relaxing. “Honestly, it’s been a rough few weeks and I fancy a drink. You’ll join me, right?”
It was surprising that in the end it was Hermione who was the first to crack; Harry had to berate himself for assuming that she was somehow immune to this kind of garbage, just because she was the most determined person he knew. The night she woke screaming for the first time, Harry and Ron wrapped themselves around her afterwards and she cried for hours into Ron’s neck.
Hermione nodded, tears burning her eyes. Draco stood and crossed the room to fetch her a handkerchief, smiling kindly before he eased himself onto the settee beside her.
say she can. Not you. You are the patient, Ha— Pot… Auror Potter?” Draco gave him an assessing look.
“You didn’t learn a thing. You were an appalling dancer,” Draco said, very reasonably. “And apparently, you still are. So
Maybe this hadn’t been the day for it. He couldn’t help but wish they’d been able to be alone, curled up together on the couch somewhere (preferably naked) and exploring each other, and what this could be, with no obligations and no one to bother them. But a declaration made on an auspicious date is traditional, and it mattered to Draco, no matter how he planned to mess up all the Pureblood traditions he was so fond of by getting Harry into bed before the Winter term began. He’d managed to keep his hands off Harry for this long, despite the rapid rekindling of a decades-old crush that had quickly moved to something much more serious — and if the heat of Harry’s kisses earlier were anything to go by, he didn’t seem particularly inclined to wait either.
“We were going to visit Number Twelve,” he said. “Yesterday. I think I’m ready. Do you still want to come? I really don’t mind going alone.”
Every night since Harry had moved into the Villa, Draco had heard him walking around at night. So it wasn’t a terrible shock, several days later, to find Harry climbing silently down the stairs at two o’clock in the morning, with his hair sticking out in every direction and blinking owlishly behind his glasses. Draco was stretched out on the couch, warming his toes with a book in his hand.
“Alright,” Hermione said, throwing her hands up. “I’ll confirm your attendance, and tighten up the story. And I promise not to ask again.”
He plucked gently, and then began to play, something Harry thought he recognised from the Muggle radio station he sometimes listened to at the shop. He sang quietly, beautifully, and Harry wished he could go back to that first day on the Hogwarts Express and shake Draco’s hand, show him another way through.
Draco found himself walking back through the castle in the direction of the Defence corridor, and Harry’s rooms. Well, room. His mother had been right about one thing; turning it into a suite would have had him choke on his martyrdom, and as nice as that might have been to watch, the chances were very good that he would have returned the space to its previously decrepit state rather than simply get comfortable.
Or rather — it was Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place the way it was now, in the real present — every surface thick with dust and the gaslights struggling to illuminate the corridor, the landing. The door to Harry’s bedroom was open a fraction and the light in there was stronger, but still weak and watery.
“Healer Black,” she said, as Parvati let him into her office. “Was there a problem with the Portkey?”
He hesitated as she immediately turned around and marched inside, before shrugging to himself and following. Hedwig hooted warningly behind him, where he'd hidden his stuff behind a bush, but he dutifully ignored her.
.” Harry said again. If people found out about that part of his detentions then Umbridge would surely know he was bluffing the whole time. While it wasn’t likely that people would believe her if she started accusing Harry of being Voldemort himself, he still didn't want to possibly give up the position he had right now. Maybe he could help Draco more like this…
Harry gripped his wand tighter and saw Cedric tense up next to him. The entry to the maze was obscured by darkness and fog.
“One thing I can’t recall,” Blaise ignored his plight, “is whether I actually provided this aforementioned postal address.”
, by a very nice body of water that inhabits a large squid. You catch my drift?” Draco said coolly, sweeping away a stray strand of hair that had fallen over his eyes.
." He said haughtily. Malfoy's shoulders drooped slightly at that, his gleeful mirth now slightly weaker than before. Harry took pleasure in seeing the other boy's confusion. He didn't necessarily know where he was going with this, but the small thrill at fighting with Malfoy gave him the possibility of a small victory in a long time. He decided in that moment that rendering the normally articulate Slytherin almost speechless was a step from winning the argument all together. All he needed to do was press it further.
Hermione's frown deepened. "You've got no shame." She scolded, turning to finish her dusting. "But this Umbridge woman means big trouble."
, Draco. I was bound to you from the moment I found you crying about Potter in the bathrooms during first year."
. The girl was hell-bent on letting Ron and Harry 'be responsible for their own studying and education for once'. It wasn't particularly working, and Ron managed to porcure her notes successfully from time to time which Harry sidled in on.
Ron nodded and looked at Harry uneasily, "Well, I was with Hermione one night while you'd disappeared again, and I was doing my Potions homework, you see. The one about that foul-smelling stuff? It was as awful to write about as it was to make, let alone explode-"
attacked!” A boy next to Dean added, hand already up as well. “Seamus Finnigan.” He added before Umbridge could open her mouth.
He slammed the cup down, startling a few people around him. “Going for a walk.” He said simply, getting up to stand.
Fourteen days before the Second Task, they had yet to sift through even half the books they'd collected. Every volume from
“It seems your physiology takes over in the case of potions like this. For lack of a better explanation, it seems you are immune to the potion’s effects, Mr Potter. On your way then.”
“It’s your turn to be loved, my sweet darling.” Harry’s mother spoke softly, moving to the side of his bed, running her fingers along his forehead. It was strange, he could almost feel it . But then again, if this was just a dream, it was incredibly cruel that his mind wouldn’t allow him to feel her touch. James took a seat at Harry’s other side, while Remus and Sirius occupied the foot of the bed.
“I don’t know-...Wait.” Harry frowned, looking around. Grabbing his glasses from the night stand and slipping out from beneath the sheets, Harry eyed the corner from Death had appeared. There was nothing there any longer, not that he’d expected anything to begin with but, his dream… it had felt incredibly real, and with Draco alive and well in his bed…
No, he wanted to find out who this other scent was, and tear him apart with teeth and claw. A rumbling sound of warning echoing down the stone halls—causing terrified students to scamper into the nearest classrooms or broom closets—came growling from Harry’s throat.
“Oh Harry…” Draco sat back up, trailing fingers softly along Harry’s jaw. With a tender expression on his face, he brought Harry’s eyes back to meet his.  “I always knew.”
The inner wolf growled, practically salivating at the challenge in Draco’s expression. Harry didn’t waste any time, hot-footing it out of the hall and into the corridor. He kept speed walking through the corridors, until he found an empty one at last. Pressing his face into the wall, he allowed the cold stone to ease the heat surging through his body like a fever.
The war didn’t end with the Battle of Hogwarts, as they all quickly and quite sadly learned. The Aurors still had so many dark wizards to round up, and it felt like for each person they found, several more popped up, committing horrible atrocities in the name of someone who wasn’t ever coming back.
The blond sent a kick towards his companion, encouraging her to not only look up, but to also perhaps depart and let them be. Whatever the secret signal was, Pansy took one look at Harry, and jettisoned out of there at practically the speed of light—leaving Draco and Harry to stare at each other across a few feet.
“Ngh, hush. Just five more minutes...Mmnn.” The sleepy sound of Draco’s voice was both terrifying and incredibly soothing for his soul.
in the halls, Draco had steadfastly ignored and avoided Harry in new and completely innovative ways.
The first sign of trouble came just at the end of class. Harry had gone the entire time without a single accident. It was incredible, but it helped having Hermione as a partner. That being said, it wasn’t like they were always completely infallible; and despite the numerous precautions Harry took during the brewing process, all it had taken was catching a whiff of Draco’s scent lingering somewhere for just a moment. It could have been the blond headed down the hall back to his dorms, or perhaps the scent simply floated through the classroom from down the hall. Whatever the reason, Harry’s entire body jolted as if pulled towards the scent, which caused him to accidentally bump into the cauldron while Hermione was stirring. Both of them were splattered with the contents.
And after being poked and prodded, and thoroughly cleaned by the gentle-as-sandpaper Madam Pomfrey, they came to a fairly solid conclusion.
After a while, Harry’s wrecked sobs finally subsided. Draco had laid them back down, but Harry continued to bury his face into Draco’s neck.
It didn’t even occur to him—until he was safely locked in his room, cock in hand, wanking so hard and fast he was likely going to have some chaffing to deal with—that he still had Draco’s jersey in his hands.
One hand wrapped around himself as he inhaled, eyes closing for a moment as he trembled. Above him, he could feel Draco switching hands in order to tangle one hand in Harry’s thick hair. The scraping of nails against his scalp felt incredible.
The closer Draco got, the harder it was for Harry to hold back. He was practically digging his fingers into the hard stone as it was, more as an anchor to keep himself from bowling Draco over. Staying pressed against the wall had the added bonus of keeping his visible arousal out of view of the blond.
Breaking the kiss, Harry pulled back to watch as Draco’s lashes fluttered against rosy-hued cheeks. It was sweet, but he needed more. Desperately so. “Your robes are going to get a little dirty. Better take them off.” Harry mused with a tone that was more command than polite request. Draco responded in turn with an expression that seemed both shocked and incredibly aroused at being bossed around so smoothly.
“Let me make this as simple as I can for you. Release me from your bidding and I shall bring back someone of your choosing.”
“Hermione…” Harry made a noise, while clutching his chest. He wasn’t okay, but he knew he had to be strong for Draco. At least here, with only Hermione to see him fall apart, he could let go for a moment, and be terrified that there was a high chance he would lose yet another person he was starting to love.
Dear God, he needed a muzzle for his inner wolf. He was barely keeping it together before, and now that lush scent was floating towards him, Harry’s mind was filled with a thousand and one ways he wanted to take Draco right here in the Great Hall. Each scene was as vivid in his head as if it were actually happening. From sweeping his arm across the table and slamming Draco’s back into it, to hoisting the blond up around his waist and fucking him while standing upright.
. Sure, they weren’t fighting anymore, and given time, it was possible to become friends, but like hell was he going to believe his physiology was responsible for falling in love with Malfoy.
Apparently forged initially over a bottle of firewhiskey and bemoaning their equally heartbroken states, it wasn’t long before they spent almost every waking minute together. Turns out, Pansy was quite the fierce competitor, and, when the opportunity was right, could also be quite the fast learner. Now, Draco and Hermione still had her beat in terms of grades and general academics, but Pansy was quick to pick things up from Hermione, and put it into practice with her own little gaggle of learners.
The hospital had kept him under strict observation for the first month, testing him during his first full moon. They told him over and over that the first shift was the worst, but Harry figured he’d been through much worse—including dying.
“You don’t have to do this right away, Harry. You know that right?” Hermione offered hesitantly as they stood—post apparition—in front of the doors to St Mungo’s.
“It’s alright. I know what you were trying to do. I just think some hatred runs even deeper than can be erased.” Harry shrugged, and followed Draco’s suit.
Evening meals were always interesting as an older student. The Eighth years tended to sit all together, at the end of one of the houses’ tables—they rotated to keep it fair—and kept to themselves while watching the younger students mill about in a flurry of activity. There was more house unity now than there had ever been in their six years of eating together.
That scent, Merlin help him, was an ambrosia of lust and excitement. Was it possible? Did Draco secretly want this just as much? With what little coherent thoughts he had left, Harry tried to make his intent very clear—as the idea of taking without consent sickened him despite his inner wolf’s thoughts to the contrary.
“Harry!” Draco gasped. In reply, Harry could only moan, and start a trail of teeth and lips down Draco’s neck.
“He’s had it for almost a year at this point. His own wand broke while we were on the run. And we came upon Draco’s when we were captured. Harry tried to give it back at some poin-”
Harry groaned and slammed his fist against the wall behind them. “You can’t possibly know what you’re saying. Please, don’t make this harder for me.” His voice softened to a whimper, as if he were the prey begging for mercy, and Draco was the predator hunting him.
She came by twice a week for tea, bringing with her an assortment of biscuits that melted in Harry’s mouth. In their discussions thus far, McGonagall had explained her idea regarding inviting former Sixth year students—who hadn’t come back due to the war—to return and finish their final year at Hogwarts.
“It’ll be alright, son.” James smiled kindly. “Don’t worry about any of us. It’s time for you to find happiness.”
Draco stood up, seething with rage at his inability to change the outcome of his misfortune, then nodded his head at the Headmistress and left.
Harry’s eyes snapped open at the sound. At first, he was terrified to move, but when the mattress shifted beneath the sheets he practically rolled himself around in a panic.
back pressed to the wall. Draco leaned in, pressing a firm, heated kiss against Harry’s lips. Harry groaned eagerly, hands letting go of his cock to tangle in Draco’s hair, tugging as roughly as Draco could handle.
“Am I imagining this? Is this still a dream?” Harry murmured to himself, attempting to pinch himself in multiple places. “OUCH!”
He acknowledged that he was one of the worst culprits for holding a grudge, but at least he could admit that about himself and still actively work on changing that.
Harry finally rounded the corner, to see the two friends packing up textbooks and scrolls of parchment. Pansy was still rambling on, but Draco’s eyes were fixed on Harry’s. A bead of sweat trickled its way down the side of his pale face, but considering the temperate weather, it seemed misplaced. Which likely meant it had everything to do with Harry’s sudden—and possibly aggressive-looking—presence.
But Draco? It was different this time. There was no war pressing down on them, nothing to focus on but recovery from loss. Friends and found family had pushed him to get out there, explore his options, allow himself an opportunity to find something genuine and all-encompassing. As Harry sank to his knees next to the frail body of his boyfriend, he knew this would be the last time he’d let himself love this deeply, or allowed anyone to get too close.
“Yes, I’m here Molly. Please, come on in.” He murmured, hardly finding the energy to get his words out.
“I figure whoever I’m paired with will come find me eventually. I’d rather not deal with the excitement on the stairs.”
“I can’t-” Even though his chest felt frozen, waves of panic and anguish were clawing their way to the surface. “Get me out of here. I can’t-” The words were stuttered as Harry, Gryffindor’s Golden boy and the Saviour of the Wizarding world, began hyperventilating.
“I’m fine, ‘Mione. Just a bad night of sleep,” Harry grumbled. He wasn’t in the mood for the lecture she was clearly gearing up to give. Thankfully, he was saved by the arrival of Hermione’s newest companion: Pansy.
“What do you want, Potter?” Gone were the snap and ice with which Draco had spoken in his youth. Instead, the fatigue was reinforced in the slow, practically monotone way he spoke.
helping as much as Harry thought she would. With a sigh, Harry closed his eyes and tried to drown them out with the sounds of wallowing in his own misery.
The parchment fell to the ground, as Harry raced back to the bed. His body practically bounced on the plush surface, but he didn’t care. Arms wildly wrapped around Draco, gathering him close, as a sob broke through.
“Shit. Shit. Fuck. I’m com-” Draco started to cry out but could barely get the words out, as his hand reached down, flying across slicked skin. Seconds later, Draco’s body was wracked with spasms, high keening sounds filling the air as he splattered the ground with white ribbons.
Stilling for a moment to catch his breath, Harry had a half second before Draco’s patience ran thin. Shifting carefully to his palms and knees—and with an initial test of pushing his hips back—Draco quickly found the perfect angle, and began rotating his hips back and forward against Harry—ultimately fucking himself on Harry’s cock—which in turn brought Harry far too close to the edge for his comfort.
“Seriously, I don’t have a thing for him. I just think he looks off. I’m going to ask Hermione to see about sending him home. He’s been here as often and as long as I have.”
Even with the practically ice-cold water pouring over his fevered frame, Harry still felt as hot as molten lava. Looking down, he saw his cock was still quite hard and showing no signs of softening in time for classes. With an annoyed grunt, he took his cock in hand and started stroking from base to tip in even, quick strokes. Every now and then, he’d add in a quick grope to the fleshy sacks just below.
"Oh, no Professor, I'm with Potter." He said sweetly sidling up to him. Harry stiffened because he really did not want Malfoy anywhere near at the moment.
He’d been completely distracted the day before, consumed with thoughts about the letter, so he understood how he may have missed Umbridge’s odd behaviour in DADA. Even if Harry was involved.
Draco paused, thinking about it for a moment with a frown. “I try to think about her as little as possible, so I wouldn’t know.”
Of course, he couldn’t blame Harry for his anger, Draco was angry too. Hell, everyone was. For a lot of things, mostly, but angry because of the changes within the school and how very un-Hogwarts everything was beginning to feel.
“I can imagine things are easily lost in there,” Blaise suggested sincerely. He was doing great, capturing the man’s attention completely. Draco was immensely glad he’d agreed to all this, and reminded himself to buy the boy a Butterbeer later.
"Oh, I thought about it. Something about his face sometimes still makes me want to…" He chuckled at the thought, to which Ron laughed as well. Within a second, they were both giggling to each other and Hermione was sighing.
Draco frowned. “But Professor,” he reasoned, “she’s a very keen woman. She’s bound to notice something amiss if my father continues to act, and after that, she’ll come after me first thing.”
and stop being such a prick in general. You're not you father, so stop trying to act like it - frankly it's quite embarrassing." Harry smiled when Malfoy did, feeling good at getting all of this off his chest. Malfoy stared at his hand for a few seconds considering it carefully. Then he took Harry's hand and Harry pulled him up to stand.
Draco folded up the note quickly, letting go of it and pressing the bridge of his nose with a sigh. A dream about You-know-who? It was safe to assume they weren't even dreams anymore. What was he planning? Using Wormtail as a servant, but he failed to do something. A 'blunder' as the voice had called it…
"Only one place to go is up, Draco." She said, her face like stone. "Your ledger is clean now. Make a new start with it."
there's also some moderate reactions to PTSD from Harry (mainly just vomiting and anxious thoughts), so please be aware!
Pansy stopped with her mouth open in shock, and Draco felt the same as she looked. Umbridge shot Pansy a tight smile, which turned sweeter and much more sickly as she turned to Draco.
Draco looked pointedly at Harry, who stiffly said, “I was sent to see you.” He held up the pink note with two fingers as if touching it fully would burn him.
"Remember the Dark Mark in the sky? At the World Cup? Like that, but on your arm. It's black but it makes the skin around it look ugly and green." Draco said disdainfully.
Just then his eyes caught Draco, stooped over his cauldron and stirring but looking at Harry questioningly. Harry shrugged slightly, flicking his eyes to Snape quickly then making a show of rolling them. The corners of Draco's mouth twitched but he just nodded and continued with his potion.
He cast a locking spell on the door to his rooms, and brought out a new phial of his potion. A little of his own hair, a little of Potter’s — he hoped that he might be allowed to skip the whole ‘dropping through a nightmare realm’ part of the experience, but there was no such luck.
“But we do need some space,” Hermione said, carefully. “And for that matter so does everyone else. And I love your mum, Ron, you know I do, but she won’t accept much help in the kitchen and she’s running herself ragged.”
pussy hound. Her manager always trotted out some good-looking bloke for her to take to functions, but I knew her better. She stopped that nonsense. Stopped performing, too, she was bored to tears. Got married to this terrific girl in Tuscany and they bought a vineyard. She still teaches, though.”
“You are most welcome. Just those finishing touches next Saturday, Harry,” Narcissa said. “Do sit down. This is elf-made wine, very fine.”
Once the wand was almost a wand, a misshapen lump of wood with a core — it was desperate to funnel… well,
Harry looked at his glass, still smiling, and then raised it to his lips. He took a deep drink, and rested it back on the sturdy walnut countertop.
“You heard the opposite when he was, what — fifteen? He’s been an Auror for almost twenty years, Draco, you don’t think he learned anything in all of that time?”
Harry only flinched for a moment before he kissed Narcissa’s cool cheek. “It’s beautiful, Mrs Malfoy,” he said.
“Don’t misunderstand, darling. I am very pleased. I thought for a while that you might end up marrying that dreadful half-Veela boy —”
He felt his cock stir, just slightly, and he almost didn’t notice when someone pushed a shot of something disgusting and sticky into his hand, but he downed it anyway.
Ron frowned at Hermione and then at Harry. “She’s doing that thing where she’s pretending you’re stupid for a while just to give herself time to come up with something else to say,” Ron said. And then, “Yes please. It’s good pie, ‘Mione.”
. We need to train him like a dog. He’s too stupid to take anything else in. There are worrying defects in your genetic line, Petunia.
“I just mean — do you think, when someone’s survived what we’ve survived, that there’s any chance they can be normal one day? That there will ever be a choice that isn’t influenced by the war? Because I’ve tried. And I don’t think so. I don’t think I can be.”
And he did; he could have just looked, and looked. But Draco’s pale skin was right there, begging to be tasted, and looking was just going to have to wait a while. He dragged his lips up Draco’s neck and nipped gently at the skin there, making Draco’s head fall back and his lips fall open. Open-mouthed and wet and hot. And then down to his collar bones, just the right size to close his teeth over; he sucked a dark little bruise to the underside, where it would be hidden by Draco’s clothes and he wouldn’t have to heal it.
“I need an elf,” Harry said, at breakfast one morning. With a crack, an elf wearing a woollen hat and socks appeared, chattering away happily at Harry. Harry beamed at her and handed her a package that had just been delivered by a huge tawny owl. An enormous heart-shaped box, wrapped in bright red paper and decorated with pink and white ribbons.
help with,” Mrs Malfoy said, stepping into the classroom. She walked swiftly down the aisle, her shoes clicking elegantly against the stones, and she opened the door to Harry’s room. “I see,” she said. “Well, I can work with this. Draco, darling, can you please make yourself very scarce, before Harry bursts a blood vessel?”
“I forgot how much fun that is. Do you know how ridiculous you looked, on your jelly legs?” Draco rolled over and held his head up on his hand. “The Saviour of the Wizarding world.”
Draco sat up more slowly. “Indeed. Well, it’s clearly time for your beauty sleep, Potter. I roll out of bed looking this good every day, but you need all the help you can get.” He reached for Harry’s hand, and Harry pulled him to his feet. They walked the hallways in silence for a few minutes, until Draco needed to head downstairs towards the dungeons. And there was a moment. Harry wondered if he should offer Draco a cup of tea, or a nightcap, or…
And then, days later, pacing in the corridor and waiting until his mother emerged, almost unable to stand, she was so relieved. She wrapped her arms around Draco and neither of them cried, but only because Malfoys didn’t cry.
Draco steeled himself. “In this world, we appear to be involved in a relationship. Both romantic and sexual in nature. It appears to have begun in Sixth Year at Hogwarts. He doesn’t speak of the war. He believes that his Godfather is on some kind of holiday. He has said on numerous occasions that we can’t have you and Ron to the house because you have two small children to care for. The reality inside his mind bears little similarity to the real world.”
“Yes, actually,” Harry said. “I’d like this clasp. And I need some advice, while you have a moment.”
effort to be tactful. “Pimples, or a hex? I don’t remember you looking quiet this spotty last week.”
“Grimmauld Place,” Hermione said. “We can clean it up, and live there. It’s only a step from the Burrow via the Floo. We can keep busy, get to therapy, enjoy some quiet…”
The party was small, but the guests too polite to make a fuss of Harry, much to his relief. He took a seat on the end of a sofa once he’d been introduced to everyone (Draco had snuck him a memory spell to recall their names, which was very helpful, as he would never have been able to keep them straight in his head otherwise).
He wasn’t expecting Granger to join them, but there she was. They’d booked a snug. By the time Granger arrived, briefly wearing a Glamour so she could get across the room without being jumped by her constituency, Draco was on his third Firewhiskey and feeling no pain.
Draco didn’t answer, just kissed him, and Harry decided that was as good an answer as any, for the moment. He snapped his hips, and Draco moaned loud and long. His eyes seemed to spark when he looked at Harry again.
Draco nodded, and Harry began his story. It started on his eleventh birthday. It started with hundreds of owls and hundreds of Hogwarts letters and a half-giant with a very strange umbrella. It moved on, in delightfully muted shades of nostalgia and a feeling of adventure. Shopping in Diagon Alley, which Harry had been afraid might be a dream. Meeting Hedwig, who had looked at him with such disdain, as if to indicate she wasn’t sure she wanted to belong to someone she could carry in her talons.
“You’re not working today. For the next few days. At least. Don’t you dare imagine that I have forgotten how to tell when you’re lying to me, Harry Potter,” she said, sternly.
“Alright. I have some personal information to share. I’m not sure it’s appropriate for Blaise to be here. However, I do recognise that he has some skills, and may be able to help. I also recognise that this… whatever this is,” he said, waving in their general direction, “may well mean that anything I tell you, Minist… Hermione, you will share with him. So I ask you as Harry’s medical proxy — should I ask Blaise to leave?”
Draco woke clutching at his throat, struggling to breathe, on his hands and knees on the floor. He felt rather like he’d been hit by the Hogwarts Express. He rolled onto his back, coughing and wheezing.
Harry lay beside Draco and breathed into his bicep, thrilling to the aftershocks, his cock over-sensitised and sticky.
Ron thought about how many times Harry had tried to talk about Draco Malfoy when he just wanted to play Quidditch or talk about girls or, Godric forgive him, even do his homework. And in sixth year, when Harry had stalked Malfoy like an obsessed fan. But he’d hated Malfoy. And what did Ron know?
Professor Saltzman was the first to leave, citing a prior engagement with a sparkle in his eye. “His husband is a vampire,” Neville whispered as he left. “A rich vampire. Isn’t that the thing?”
“I know someone you could talk to about that,” he said, far too quickly. “I’ll get her to Floo you or something. Now, what else do you want to look at? Only I have to get back to the shop.”
Hermione sighed. “Two years, perhaps. Blaise will have to resign from the Department of Mysteries and then, after a while, we can come out as a couple — it’s all very complicated.”
“You’re not,” Draco insisted. You can’t be. There’s one thing left. Please, Harry. Darling. Please. Do you love me?”
Draco had a clinical supervisor. It was only appropriate; he wouldn’t work with anyone who was rash enough not to have one themselves. A clinical supervisor was always an interesting combination of a therapist and a teacher.
Once he was settled in his armchair, the leg rest out all the way and the back reclined, Harry pulled the last quilt over himself and waited for sleep to take him.
Harry shook his head. “No, I want — I’m probably going to do this all wrong, but I’m going to try, if you can indulge me.” He hesitated. “Actually, I think you should know that I’ve been seeing a Mind Healer for a while, now. And it’s been good.”
Draco sighed, and closed his eyes, trying to feel his way to an answer that might make some kind of sense, but seven bloody hells, was that hard to do — he thought that on balance he might have fucked with Harry’s worldview quiet enough for one day. He also wondered if it was enough to blow these memories apart, or if Harry had to keep poking in them until he’d had enough of it. He wondered, too, whether Harry had much hope of living for long enough to do whatever it was he needed to do.
“Usually,” Luna agreed. “You’re amazing too, you know. I’m glad you quit your job. Your aura has looked like a tight golden shell for the last few years. It’s not good to be so closed off. You never know what you might be missing. And look, you have a butterfly on your wrist, now. A butterfly wouldn’t land on a tight golden shell.”
“I’m not…” he started, hating the way his stomach tied itself in knots. “I wasn’t raised well, Mrs Malfoy. I wasn’t raised in this world, and I wasn’t really…” Wasn’t really raised in the Muggle world, either, was what he wanted to say. Didn’t know how to do this sort of thing.
“I was nearly sorted into Slytherin myself,” he said. “Is it fun, sleeping under the lake? D’you ever see the giant squid?”
“What’s the hurry?” she asked. “Not that I’m complaining, I’ve been asking you to come in for a diagnostic on your magic for weeks, now. But why today?”
Draco nodded. “I said terrible things to Ron, when we were children. Called him poor. I’ve never been in a house like that. With people like that.”
And it was wonderful, as it always was; the girls climbed over Harry like he was a jungle gym and painted his fingernails, the conversation was fun and easy. And then when Gabrielle took the girls to bed, Harry and Ron set up a chess board.
Apparently he was appalled to find himself in the company of a pair of Purebloods in his quidditch gear and drenched with sweat, as well. Though he forgot quickly, as he looked around the room.
“I just thought — well, Ron thought. Wondered. If there was something you knew about that we didn’t. Something he told you, something terrible. The worst memory Harry has.”
“Milk and sugar,” he said, meeting Harry’s eyes for a moment. “I know you prefer a slice of lemon, but we need to get a little of something into you in case your stomach isn’t ready for food.”
Harry and Ron sat in the dark living room after one such night when Ron had been woken while he was trying to climb out a window.
“Mother loved Christmas,” he said, wistfully. “She spent all of November planning the decorations, and setting out the plans for the elves, drawing up lists of things they needed to order and who would be doing what jobs. Packages would arrive for weeks and weeks and then on the first of December, we’d wake up to find the house was decorated. I missed that, when I went to Hogwarts, you know. Not that the decorations there were anything to sneeze at.”
They stumbled into Harry’s bedroom already pulling at their clothes, and Harry was suddenly glad for the practise he’d had, shagging Muggles all over London, think of those first few times when he couldn’t quite figure out the etiquette of getting one’s kit off, wondering if he seemed presumptuous. Presumptuous or not they both knew what was happening here, and by the time Draco’s back hit the mattress all he had to do was lift his hips so Harry could help him with his jeans.
“I really don’t want to discuss this any more, Malfoy,” he said, and tried not to enjoy the way Malfoy flinched at the name. “Are you going to return to your rooms? Madam Pomfrey would probably like to keep an eye on you in the hospital wing, if you can bear the scrutiny.”
Which is to say it brought out the worst in him, which was one of the reasons he so rarely put himself in a position to be rejected. He’d never had a relationship that lasted for longer than six weeks, unless you counted the fact that two or three times a year Blaise blew through town and the two of them would spend a dirty weekend fucking and sucking in every conceivable position, location, and combination. The faint hangover from the intensive presence of a half-veela in his home was worth it, but the arrangement was no more romantic than the one Draco had with his hand. His hand, as well, while not remotely as satisfying as Blaise’s marvellously athletic and flexible body, was much more reliable, and there was certainly something to be said for that.
Draco pulled Harry’s cardigan tight around his body and nodded. He had his feet curled up beneath him and the Prophet curled tightly in one fist. He looked like he wanted to escape, but he could very easily have hidden in his bedroom when he heard them downstairs, so Harry couldn’t feel too sorry for him.
“I’ll show you my collection, if you can keep a secret,” he said, and Draco followed him with some trepidation out to the shed where he kept his bizarre collection of Muggle items. The whole house seemed to breathe out once he was outside.
“The first time I was asked for an autograph, I was eleven years old,” he admitted, eventually. “People treated me as special. It doesn’t matter if I was, or not; it was just very tiring. He never thought I was anything special. It helped.”
“Sometimes I wish I didn’t have feelings at all. I remember when I was young, wishing I could be as poised as Father, as cold. I practised, you know. Looking in the mirror and trying to keep my expressions off my face. I thought I could do it, if I practised enough. Keep myself secret, the way Father did. And then the slightest thing would happen, and I’d lose my temper, or I’d get frightened, or I’d laugh until my sides ached…”
Harry was suddenly so angry that some spiteful thirteen-year-old version of himself rose to the surface and he found himself thinking again of Ginny’s bat-bogey hex. But he didn’t reach for his wand or his magic. He was an adult. An Auror, a Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and he had killed Tom Riddle.
Mysteries, all, but it was impossible not to piece the simplest fragments together, given enough time to think.
“I agreed because I haven’t had a chance to put Potter in his place in over a decade, and I relish the opportunity. Which reminds me, I need some of those boyhood spell-books that are locked up in the attic. With all the silly jinxes. The cross-eyed jinx, and the one that turns ones hair into spaghetti, so forth.”
He smiled, and examined his bread, which had proved for a second time and was ready to slip into the oven. “I’m not ready. I’m nearly ready, but I’m not ready. I know what comes next, and I’m — I’m looking forward to it. I’m nearly there. There are things I need to do, first.”
Andromeda cried, a little. She hugged a lot. She talked about how it might be nice to be able to spend time with some of her old friends, now that Tom Riddle was dead.
His face burned, suddenly, as Draco raised his eyebrows so slowly that entire continental shifts occurred.
“No Malfoy,” Ron murmured. As if summoned, Malfoy appeared in place at the head of the grave, his spine straight, his eyes dry, and (one of those things Harry could have difficulty failing to notice, sometimes) his magic flashing and jagged in the air around him. The contrast between his calm exterior expression and his inner grief was frightening to see.
This was not a conversation he thought he should be having. Not with her. But since he couldn’t have it with Draco, there really wasn’t much of a choice.
“I learned the bat-bogey hex from Ginny, and I’m not afraid to use it,” Hermione said flatly. And unnecessarily; they
“It’s not exactly good to take too little, either. If your eyeballs are hanging out of your head from a lack of sleep, it’s probably time you swallowed your pride. No matter. I have some time tonight.”
“Harry’s worst memory. It’s not a secret, Hermione. We were all there. All four of us. You remember. I know you remember.”
They did look very happy, and the stars, Luna thought, when she gazed up into the sky, seemed to agree.
“Everyone knows you prefer a nice dirigible plum seed or two,” Draco replied. He barely noticed when Harry pushed himself out of his chair, mumbled an excuse and slipped away.
Was he about to lose his job? No — Harry couldn’t survive without purpose. His pathetic attempts to relax were proof enough of that.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Neville said, evenly. “I don’t. I haven’t even heard his name since his mum died.”
Except the tiny branch had the most wonderfully responsive feeling, in his hand. It seemed to be warm, almost. Harry laid it down alongside one of Crookshanks’ whiskers.
“Weeks?” Luc pouted again. He was wearing eyeliner, a little mascara, as if he needed anything to make him look prettier than he already was, with his messy black hair and his green eyes. “
It was pathetic, really. The number of things Harry remembered actually enjoying. It became an obsession. Trying to remember things he did at Hogwarts that didn’t involve fighting Tom Riddle, or trying not to die. Or when he’d still been an Auror, working insane hours and grateful for a few hours of sleep.
The Room of Requirement was never going to be usable again. The FiendFyre was trapped inside, and couldn’t escape, but it would burn for as long as Hogwarts stood. Harry and Draco spent most of the weekend trying to find a suitable location for the Duelling Club meetings. They needed mats. Space. Safety equipment. Eventually, in an almost lost wing of the castle, they found a large room that appeared to have been abandoned. Three very helpful elves promised to get the room clean in time for the first meeting the following Monday night.
“Thank you. I take that as a compliment, these days. And for the record, you’re quite odd yourself.”
Harry took a deep breath, and looked Draco directly in the eyes. “Because it was a disgusting, unforgivable violation of his privacy, and I knew stopping was the right thing to do.”
“Cuttings. Or… rather, dried branches. There’s good stuff in there, Harry, I promise. I think it’s brilliant that you’re going to be a wandmaker — brilliant! And if I can ever give you anything you need, I will.”
Hermione cleared her throat and Draco startled, rearranging the sheet over Harry’s body and straightening his spine. “I don’t mean to push, Draco,” she said. “But have you made any progress?”
“Sold,” Pansy said, opening her money bag to count out Galleons. “Listen, Potter — since I’m here anyway. I was wondering if you know where Draco is.”
“You two truly are unspeakably bad at this,” he said, and served himself some more pie. “To tell the truth, I think you might be right. I had those parties, what, twice a year…”
“But this…” Harry’s voice was lower, and scratchy, and exhausted. “This didn’t happen, did it. It didn’t happen and it can’t happen. The worst thing I ever did. I can’t take it back.”
Draco wrinkled his nose. “You might have a point.” He looked down at the points of his shoes. “Beautiful job, Kreacher. I’d ask you to do something about Harry’s hair, but I know how you feel about abject failure.”
“I had a lot of help,” Harry said firmly. “No one person can save the world. Which is why in this class, we’ll be working together. And I won’t have you sitting in houses. Everyone; get up and walk around, and sit with someone from a different house. Someone you haven’t met before, ideally, or at least someone you’ve never taken the time to get to know. You’ll be sitting somewhere different every single class, so I encourage you not to dawdle over this, or I’ll start making everyone come ten minutes early.”
He wished he didn’t recognise what he was looking at, but he did. This was not the old Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. This was the version that had only ever existed in his dreams, faithfully plotted out, wallpapered and painted, carpeted the way it had been carpeted in his most private fantasy world. Not just a house, but a home. And how she loved feeling like a home again; Harry felt the way her old resentments had fallen away. The bookcases were dust-free and the books looked as if they had been healing, too. When Harry stepped into the kitchen, he wanted to cry, a little bit; there it was in its glory, the size it had been when Molly Weasley had been feeding the Order of the Phoenix there night after night. He didn’t even notice the tears streaming down his cheeks. It didn’t look like it had even back then; it was exactly the way it had been in his dreams. Just… big. Big enough to host parties, full of friends, full of…
To her credit, Hermione didn’t rush to comfort. Harry supposed that was why he’d asked her, and not Ron. She sat silent for a long time, and then twitched strangely. She grabbed Harry’s hand, and pressed it to her stomach. Harry was alarmed, momentarily, until he felt the kick under his hand, and then his face split into a grin.
’. His face, his name, his reputation had never failed to draw interested and scandalised looks from students new and old, but Draco had learned something interesting in his first year of teaching; if you refused to pay a lick of attention, people really
“I need you to tell the Ministry to leave me alone for the rest of the year so I can finish my NEWTs. I don’t know… ban students from social events not arranged by Hogwarts, or something. I can’t stand it, Professor. The way they all want to shake my hand, and take my photograph, and touch my clothes — I think I’ve given enough, now, and I need time to be eighteen and stupid, not their sodding
Eventually, when all the sounds had died out, he sat up, got to his feet and pushed the cupboard door open. His shoulder was still in place, but it was swollen and bruised and Draco hoped that perhaps he was about to run away from home — from the house, really, this was not a home, and apparently never had been. The idea that Harry Potter had been raised to know how special and important he was, showered with gifts and praise, was gone. Draco hated that he’d ever made such an assumption.
Close to midnight, Neville, Harry and Draco decided it was time to turn in. Not exactly drunk, but very, very far from sober. At the door to the castle, knowing Neville was heading in the opposite direction to he and Harry, Draco pressed a small vial of a bright green liquid into each of their palms.
Harry seemed only too pleased to oblige. The name-changing joke had been running for almost two years, at this point, but Draco quite enjoyed it. “You know if we’re not fifteen minutes early, Molly Weasley will probably box both of our ears,” he said. “I’d rather like to avoid that.”
“Thank you, Minister,” he said, taking the gift, and he was gone, and Hermione was left with guilt and shame and wishing that Blaise could come and hold her while she cried the other half of her tears.
“I’d hoped you might get there on your own,” his mentor said, gently. “But sometimes there is a gap. Between what is ethical — and what is right.”
“As are you, Malfoy,” Harry said cheerfully. It earned him a look with narrowed eyes. “Both pleased with yourself and annoying. Are you busy this evening?”
“Forever, ideally. I don’t want to think about it. I’m so embarrassed. He never should have known any of it. It was… it was private, and I know that sounds ridiculous under the circumstances, but it was. Private. Just somewhere I went when I didn’t want to be Harry Potter anymore. He never treated me like anything but the skinny speccy git from the train that morning at the beginning of first year. Even when we started to get along a little better, after… I hate seeing that obligation in his eyes, Hermione. I have to get home.”
But then, he had to admit: if they had asked him, he would have said he didn’t care. And if they’d warned him, he would have said it didn’t matter.
“Well, we’ll find you something,” Ollivander said. He watched as Harry poured the tea. Harry only poured the cup to the half-way point, seeing how badly Ollivander’s hands shook.
“Topher. Right, then.” Ron stepped carefully past the portrait of Walburga Black and directed Topher into the sitting room. “Hermione — the Minister — said I should help you find anything you need, and that you could take anything you need away with you. So…?”
“I can’t believe I told you that.” Harry frowned, and then seemed to remember something. “I have a Kneazle kitten. Her name is Dora. I picked her out because she seems to have some very odd abilities for a Kneazle.”
“No,” Luna said, but she was standing as well. “You should come. It’s a very good time for walking alongside the stream.”
Hermione held his gaze. She looked tired, suddenly. But she forced a smile. “I know. And I love you, too. I guess I just wish that you could find a way to love
“I don’t think I know quite what to do with you,” Draco said. He hadn’t expected to say it, though he had been thinking it. “You’re different.”
“I stand by what I said. Dumbledore did his best by me. He knew what I had to do, and what I needed to be, and he let it all happen — he made sure it would all happen. Do you really think a Wizard as powerful as Dumbledore couldn’t have stopped me from competing the Tri-wizard Tournament?”
“Apprentice wandmaker,” he corrected. “I don’t think Europe has a Headmaster, but I rarely read the Prophet these days. And who is this?”
“I say, Potter. No one is going to try to take your food away before you finish it.” Potter flushed, and turned as if he intended to say something snotty, but decided against it. He moved his arm a good inch and a half and chewed what was in his mouth. “No one has ever gone hungry at Hogwarts. The kitchen elves would die of mortification.” He noticed the way Potter tensed, and of course, he was immediately struck with a great urge to poke until Potter snapped at him. But he didn’t. They were, after all, teachers now. Adults.
This perfect, dry, warm brush of lips was meant to test the base of it. Lust, or curiosity. Boredom, or friendship. Or love, perhaps, a true match. Draco ended the kiss, pulling an inch away and feeling rather than seeing Harry chase it for a moment, his eyes opening; the brightest green Draco ever wanted to see.
Hermione kneeled to examine the buds, the early flowers. To enjoy the scent of warm, moist earth. It didn’t feel like a place that had seen that much evil. Not anymore.
McGonagall sighed. “There are hundreds of jobs in the magical world, and hundreds of things you haven’t yet had the chance to try. Perhaps you have an affinity for art. Or healing.”
“I’m a disaster. You’re a disaster. We duel like maniacs and what I lack in your raw power I more than make up for in hard-earned skill. We both survived the fucking war.
He began to rub the potion into Harry’s skin, trying not to think about the knotted scars beneath his fingers. “It doesn’t matter. I suppose it’s a numbers game, in the end. We might talk about your tendency t throw yourself into the line of fire, some day.”
“It’s dot dat mad,” Harry replied, which in no way answered her question or appeared to reassure her. Okay, so he couldn’t talk properly and his head felt like it had swollen to twice its size — perhaps it was, indeed, ‘dat mad’.
And then when he was about to lose his mind on a cold Saturday in December, he walked out of the Hogwarts gates and apparated at the gate to Malfoy Manor. Neville had mentioned in a deliberately off-hand way that Draco was in Dublin visiting with Pansy Parkinson, that evening. It was possible that Neville thought Harry was actually keeping an eye out for Draco. It was equally possible that he was correct.
So what if they could never be friends? Harry hadn’t had high hopes even the night before, when Malfoy shook his hand and welcomed him cordially back to Hogwarts. Still. Getting along a little better than they had when they were children would be a good start. He jotted down some notes about the class and wound his scarf around his neck, before he headed down into the Great Hall for lunch.
“Maybe twice a year,” Neville replied with a sigh. “Or he used to. Being an Auror kept him busy, but he’d invite the old gang around…”
“I’d like to cook you something fancy.” Draco climbed to his feet, pulling Harry along to the kitchen.
Upstairs, he summoned the teapot and the tea, wandlessly, thoughtlessly, and when he looked up again Draco was looking at him with hunger in his eyes. Very poorly disguised.
“If you wake up,” he said, quietly, “I think I’d like to get to know you, Potter. We grew up. I’d like to see who you grew up into. Please, don’t die like this.”
“I’ve never been so sure. I’m only sorry it had to come to this.” She kissed Harry’s cheek, and leaned into him again, wiping her tears and ignoring the last of the applause. “When will you leave for Naples?”
“I miss him,” Harry said, at last. “We were getting to be good mates, and I’ve gone and bollocksed it — er, made a bit of a mess of things, really. Do you think he’ll forgive me? Even if I can’t — do the other things.”
