"I wish I could, too."  Harry said, scrunching his mouth to the side.  "But I don't expect that would go over too well with anyone.  Including the people at your house."
Draco exhaled softly, taking a bite of his biscuit.  Once he'd swallowed it his eyes found Harry's again and he smiled.  "We have very heavy conversations, you and I."
Harry knew that not killing both himself and Draco was likely the only concession or apology that they were likely to get from Tom.  And he knew that by Tom's standards, that was incredibly gracious.  So he dropped it as well and sat back just as the other boy had done.
“I'm not trying to make light of the circumstances... But I would think anyone who was willing to kill someone to create a Horcrux once is not going to balk at creating another...”  He trailed off again, rubbing his thumb against the side of his pinky finger for a moment before he continued.  “Even if maybe each time you did it you became less human...”
“I know you're still loyal to the Malfoys and I get that.  Especially since I know Draco is still out there somewhere when he should be here living in you, right?  That's kind of the reason I own you right now.  I want to try and find him and bring him back.  If I do find him, I'll hand the deed back over to him.  Won't ask him for a knut, swear to Merlin.”
“You will have to have another Auror here when you get the internet set up.  Someone has to come into your flat to do stuff, I think, and it would be incredibly lax of us to let some stranger walk in here with you alone.”
"Never any trust with you.  You're far too slippery and far too conniving and smart to be trusted."
"Your mother.." Harry sat down in one of the leather chairs facing Draco's desk, leaning forward with his forearms on his knees. "What about her?"
“That I can do.”  Harry said with a nod, then moved to get to his feet.  “I'll find out what I can and get you an appointment to have internet set up.  I think that you have to pay a monthly fee to have it but I assume you don't really have to care about money...”
Draco turned his eyes away as they started to flood again.  "He didn't give me any choice."
Draco laughed at what Snape said. A sharp bark of a laugh that was so full of disdain it even made Snape falter for a moment, one foot moving back even though he didn't actually take the step.  "You think I won't do it?  You just want to have a hand in it so you'll be praised by him.  You want to see us, my family, fall even further back from him.  Ridiculed further and pushed away more than we already are.  You're just looking to take MY glory and make it your own."
Hermione clucked and tutted and patted his shoulder and assured him that she and Ron would never stop being his friend.  And that SHE was sorry for not taking him more seriously in the summer and she understood and was even proud of him for what he'd managed to do.
Half of him wanted the other man to just forget all of this, to claim it wasn't actually true, that it was just like he'd said... A stressful time, not thinking clearly...  And half of him was angry that Harry would even suggest that when he knew those feelings were
"You.... didn't tell me what you thought me talking to Snape was..."  Draco said haltingly, all too aware of how close they were still standing together.  That he could still feel Harry's breath against him as the other boy chuckled.
Harry’s temper flared, Draco could see it in his eyes and in his face. Colour rose into his cheeks making the dark haired boy seem to flicker and crackle like a flame that had just been lit.  He couldn’t help but smile as he watched it happen, thumping his own head back against the wall as he regarded Harry with immense satisfaction.
There was, however, one person that knew Draco had to be alive.  He didn't know where he was, didn't know what had happened to him, but he KNEW Draco had been alive at the end of the war and he never second guessed that knowledge.  It angered him beyond belief that Draco's disappearance was just passed off.  That he faded from people's minds and memories without a second thought.  That no one seemed to CARE that he was just gone.
“I can make peace with Hermione and Ron.  I know they would be all too eager to have me jump back on the 'Malfoy is up to no good' band wagon.  If I do that, and I do it well, maybe I can get Hermione to research Vanishing Cabinets.  I couldn't ask her outright how to fix one but if I make them both believe that I've been friends with you just to try and find out what you're up to and you've confided in me that you were in Borgin and Burkes about a Vanishing Cabinet...”
"They're putting it up for auction.  Contents and everything."  Ron was uncorking a bottle of firewhiskey, pouring a measure into his glass then leaning over towards Harry to do the same.  "It's been empty for five years, though it looks like it's been left for five hundred.  Already so overgrown and looks unkempt."
"Mean what?"  Harry asked, his brow furrowing slightly.
"I think you need to talk to Snape."  Harry said eventually, absently reaching out to push a stray lock of Draco's hair up out of his eyes. "I mean really talk to him.  Bluntly.  Ask him why he fed false information to Voldemort.  Ask him why he made an Unbreakable Vow to help you.  Tell him you feel like there's more going on than you know.  The more information you can get the better."
“That really would be nice.”  The other man admitted with what was clearly an apologetic smile.  “I'll bring the mug back up when my shift is done, I'll just leave it outside your door, you can get it whenever it suits you if I do that.”
"Can we meet day after tomorrow?"  Draco asked Harry, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.
He smiled at his friend then left her office, retracing his steps through the Ministry to the apparation spots, going straight to the outer gates of Malfoy Manor.  He was still leery about trying to apparate right into the Manor or on it's front step until it got the feel of him and knew he wasn't going to do anything bad.  But as he walked through the gate and up to the front door, he felt nothing but a quiet sort of contentment that he had returned, and the front doors of the Manor opened for him to enter as he came up the stairs, not even waiting for him to reach for the handle.
But with a cooking lesson under his belt, and something new to learn and play with, Draco has to admit that he actually feels.. content.  Which is not something he ever thought he would have in his life again.
“Separated.  He didn't think they could get divorced quietly enough that no one would find out and he didn't want it in all the papers.  They're essentially divorced just not... on paper.”
"There's just one thing..."
Letting out a small sigh of relief he moved away from the mixer and picked up a knife and his cherries to chop.
“Fine.  I got it..”  Draco said, rolling his eyes as he followed Harry to the door.  He stumbled as they walked, butting into Harry and grabbing his coat to keep himself from falling.  “Sorry..”  He mumbled, embarrassed as he stood upright again, holding his hands behind his back.  “There must be a lip in the rug or something...”
"Is this the last room?"  Draco asked after a long minute of silence, not wanting to discuss the subject further.
” Hermione cut in, speaking far too loudly, both boys immediately shushing her and forcing her to swallow back whatever she was going to say next.  She took a few moments before she spoke again in a hissing whisper.  “He's tried sending living things through a broken Vanishing Cabinet??”
"Well you do."  Harry said, his voice a little more gentle after Draco spoke.  "You're a friend to me now.  Friends work out problems together.  But even really good friends still have to at least give each other a heads up about what's wrong.  I was crap at Divination, you know."
This had become more frequent.  After the chance meeting and conversation they'd had on the stairs a few weeks ago, Draco started to notice that Harry was kind of everywhere he was.  And not the same way he used to be.  It
"Used to what?"
With a huff he tore the envelope open and unfolded a very thick parchment that said something entirely different than every other missive he'd received since leaving the Wizarding World.
“But what does that have to do with me?”  He had asked, then immediately regretted it when the officials pushed their way past him and into the foyer of Malfoy Manor.
“I took it all out to look at and see what I understood and recognized and what I didn't.”  Draco sat back down on the stool and placed the box of macaroni and cheese back into the pile of things he didn't understand.
“So he has tried to fix it then.  I'm guessing fixing the physical problems didn't work?”
"He...  What?"
Harry looked down at the vial in his hand, closing his fingers around it before he slid it down into his pocket.  He didn't answer because he didn't want to just agree that he'd let Tom know what that memory was.  Regardless of what was going on, the help he was giving him, and the seemingly decent way he was treating him, Harry was not going to blindly agree to or promise anything to Tom.
“And job well done there.  Consider me thoroughly threatened.” Draco snorted lightly, his eyes turning up as he shook his head.  “I have nothing to tell you about where I’m disappearing to.”
He frowned, getting up to pluck the slightly smouldering envelope from the hearth before he sat down again, wondering if he should even bother opening it.
Draco shook his head, a slow and desolate back and forth swing that ended with him turning his head up to meet Neville's eyes.  “No.  He did the right thing.  Taking me would have... It just wouldn't have worked.”
“I didn't.”  Draco said, smirking a little bit.  That nasty little dark smirk that was so Draco and that Harry had come to love seeing on his face.  “I don't have to, I was just saying it to give you some warning.”
"I have no idea what you're talking about."  Draco responded icily, keeping his hands in his coat pockets.  It was really damn cold out.
“Oh...  I'm not... married.”  Neville said, slightly haltingly as he looked over at Draco.
“I promise you.  We're dreaming.  This is like when I met Tom at the orphanage.” He shook his arm out of Draco's grasp once more, waving his hand around.  “You're dreaming, I'm dreaming.  Actually it's kind of cool to be here
The blonde was still for just a moment before realization seemed to dawn on his face and he nodded once.
Harry could hear the catch in Draco's voice that was half the same heated need that was in him and half the absolute torment that his life had become.  He swallowed thickly, nodded his head as he leaned in to catch the blonde's lips again.  He kissed him deep but not hard, shifting a bit, using one hand with Draco's to press against him, trying to move slowly and smoothly, though neither of them had any sort of practice at any of this that Harry knew of.
"I'll need to send a message to Astoria.  I sent her a letter the other day, she's supposed to be moving back to the Manor tomorrow."
“I wouldn’t be so sure.” Harry said truthfully, tilting his head a bit as he looked at Draco rather curiously. “I had more than your personal influence guiding me in that.  Sirius was pretty driven against it.  My father was as well.”
“I didn't want to wake you up, but you slept all day yesterday.  I was getting worried about you not eating since Harry mentioned you had a... Um.. low blood sugar thing..”
“You let me go first.” Draco said, his eyes seeming to flicker in the dim light of the hall, narrowing and daring Harry to do just that.
Neither of them spoke, there wasn't much to say that would help anything.  Harry moved the small inch or so that closed the gap between them, sliding his arms around the blonde, pulling him in tightly.  Draco raised his head, one arm staying tight around Harry's back, his free hand raising to push into the unruly black hair that he both loved and hated.  Their lips pressed together hard and fast, a low noise escaping from Draco that he immediately stifled.
“What are you talking about?”  Harry asked, furrowing his brow and shaking his head at Draco.  “When?”
Harry- Merlin this is going to be awful.  You being able to text me whatever you like whenever you like.  I suppose if I tell you not to you wouldn't listen?
"There is absolutely NO way you could do that."  Harry said, giving Draco a shove over on the couch so there was room for him and the massive bowl of popcorn he was carrying to flop down next to the other man.  "You couldn't even boil water for tea."
Harry nodded when Draco faltered looking for words, tilting his head a bit.  "I know.  Dumbledore does that.  I've gotten used to it..."
He took in a deep breath, coughed and let it out again slowly as he rubbed his hands against his knees.  “When I saw Potter and everyone, when we were supposed to be stopping them..  He disarmed me, took my wand, I was glad to see it gone.  Glad to see them getting away.  The only thing I was sorry about was that I couldn't go with them.”
Mimir had found him.  And Theodore had already sent back a reply.
Carefully he retraced his steps up the walk way, moving at a more relaxed and amiable pace than he had the night before, almost as though he thought the house would be lulled into a false sense of security if he approached without purpose.  It didn't really do the trick, he could practically feel the place tensing the closer he got, raising it's hackles and ready to unleash whatever protective horrors were inside on him at any moment.
Draco had felt incredibly uneasy about the word 'action' being said while they were looking at him.  It was clear that they meant this directed at him, like he was going to have to take some sort of action.  And he was decidedly not interested in it.
."  Draco arched one eyebrow at the other man, feeling a great deal of satisfaction when Harry laughed again far more genuinely.
“Muggles do that a lot.”  Neville said, turning to look with Draco even though he probably knew the building inside and out better than anyone who lived there at this point.  “Take really big houses, often really old ones, and turn them into flats.  Makes money for them and lots of Muggles rent flats and rooms.”
“You were glad when Harry got everyone out?  I heard you fought against him but... only sort of...”
Harry smirked, nodding as they started walking up and down the hall several times in front of where the door for the Room of Requirement would open.
a very unlikely thing to see.  Our animosity towards each other at school wasn't a secret."
But this time it wasn't Harry thinking of an alternate plan.  It wasn't Harry's brain ticking through other options.
"Do you believe him?"  Harry stepped closer to Draco, bending down so he could look up into the blonde boy's downturned face.  "You can look at me, you know."
"Why we split up?"  Draco asked, raising his eyebrows a bit, smiling when Harry nodded.  "It was a few things, really..."
“I can help you with anything you don't know.”  Harry said as he came to join him, having shed his jacket onto the arm of the couch.
"Maybe Dumbledore could..."
Harry has lost something important... Something that might actually HELP Draco with the horrible task he's been set.
memories of me that it's hard to find any that aren't.”
"Ugh."
Hopefully he'd remember her face and avoid her in future visits.
"Would you shut up!"  He hissed, looking around and trying to control his breathing so he could listen.  "You have to be the dumbest clod in the world.  I don't give a rat's ass what you and your friends can do in here but do NOT call attention to us in this forest.  Not while I'm with you."
"Neither of those were intentional."  Draco said, not disputing it, just setting things right.  "I never wanted to hurt Katie.  Or Weasley.  I'm just not good at thinking of every possible variable."
This time Harry took his hand.
Harry closed the small distance between them, resting a hand on his shoulder and bending so he could tip his head and see into Draco's downturned face.  "Nothing's going to hurt you in here so long as you leave it alone.  And stay away from the Acromantulas."
Tom laughed at him.
Draco nodded, seeing how that made sense.  But they were two days from the release, just two days until his father came home.
"No, I..."  Draco trailed off, sighing a bit as he realized he'd just outted himself to Harry on something else.  At this point he figured he was already in this, he might as well just tell all.
to be that Harry would follow around behind him, spying on him.  Turning up to watch him from a distance and glare at him.
"Anything."  Harry said, smiling a little more and leaning forward a bit.
They'd taken to going to the Room of Requirement that always presented itself as Draco's bedroom in Malfoy Manor fairly regularly.  This was the fifth or sixth time they'd met there.  Always with the most subtle of planning.  An eye caught in class or across the Great Hall.  A note stuck in a pocket in the hall when they passed, bumping shoulders and sneering at each other in a combative way.
“You will regrade both essays.”  McGonagall said, handing both to Snape while keeping her eyes on Harry and Draco.  “And you two... may go...”
“Well...”  Draco scrunched his mouth to one side, his tightly folded arms loosening a bit.  “I suppose--”
"Whenever you're ready."  He said, looking straight into Draco's pale eyes.  "I'm with you."
"And you like that for a wedding cake?"
"Oh no. Not at all."  The dark haired boy smiled a little more genuinely.  "You know what's really mad?"
“You're tense.  You really don't need to be tense.  It's far better if you aren't, actually.”  Draco said, stopping a few feet in front of him.  “You're bracing yourself for an attack, which it is but it's different than a jinx or a curse. You need to be softer on the outside.”
“Don't get mad at Longbottom for bringing me the drink.”  He said, looking slightly uncertainly at Harry.  “We all know he wasn't supposed to, but it was kind and... I don't want to be getting him in trouble.  Again.  We aren't kids anymore.”
He wanted to be utterly forgotten, and for the most part he was.
Draco stayed quiet for a few moments, smirking a bit to himself.  An expression that was reminiscent of his days in Hogwarts.  Eventually, shifting to cross his legs at the knee more comfortably he spoke again, careful with how he worded things.
"That's amazing."  Draco smiled a bit, looking back down and watching as the snake in his mark shifted and twisted as though wanting right off his skin to curl around Harry's finger that was still stroking against it.  "It drives me nuts.  It's always moving and twitching and sometimes it really hurts."
“Not a clue.”  Draco said, smiling as he slid off the stool and went to the front door, tucking the envelope full of cash into the front pocket of one of his coats.  “But I'll figure it out as I go.  Television has been teaching me a lot.  About phones and the internet and apps...”
Not that that was any of his concern.
But intent and focus...  That wasn't exactly something both he and Draco were lacking.  Draco was incredibly intense and Harry was being honest when he talked about his skill level.
The scuffed paint had been cleaned and refreshed, the disgusting sticky looking carpet had been thoroughly cleaned so it looked brand new.  Everything, actually had gotten a very heavy
Draco didn't finish that sentence because before he could Harry had stepped up into him.  Had wrapped his arms around him and pulled him in tight.  Had slid one hand up his back to pull his head down the small ways (Harry always was a little shorter than him) to his own so he could press their lips together.
Draco left first again a few minutes later, making sure the halls were clear before slipping out of the room.  Harry sighed a looooong deep breath as he processed everything they had just talked about and looked around the room.
"I should have guessed Slughorn wouldn't give that mead over."  Draco said, sliding his mug onto the table.  Then immediately stilled as Harry looked at him, realizing he'd said too much just a little bit too late.  "I mean..."
He couldn't place exactly why he didn't want to be there, he just didn't find any of the conversation interesting.  Ron moaned about life and school work.  Hermione chastised them in between scribbling out her own assignments.  There was absolutely nothing about those two friendships he found particularly endearing right then.
"Why is it so important I open the door now?"
"Your temper and quickness to draw your wand on a classmate is what I think is the problem here."
His next steps in this were going to be the hardest, and they weren't something he was going to ask Draco for help with.  He was going to have to swallow his pride, stamp out his suspicion, and try his best to win over someone who absolutely loathed him.
"In school...  In the war.  After the war.  The years we didn't see each other.  Every time you nodded at me at the school train.  When I watched you go to Eeylops.  When you told me about the Dementors and your cousin...  Always been there.  Hasn't changed."
It was a little awkward.  Okay, much more than a little.  Aside from the nods they gave each other at the train station, and the owls they'd sent each other recently, they'd had absolutely no interaction what so ever since Harry had been captured and in Malfoy Manor.  Which was not the best time at all.  Terrible, to say the least
He couldn't fault Harry for thinking the way he did, even if it wasn't right at all.
“Maybe it will at some point.  Everything still feels in motion right now..”  Draco said, his voice uncertain and so full of hope.
“Happy now?”
After the gates had slammed shut with a decisively iron clang, he rested his hands on his legs, bent over to catch his breath.  Once he'd managed to stop his heart racing he raised his head again, looking for any sign of the ghostly presence, and considering Malfoy Manor in general.
-----------------------
"Thought I'd have everything gold plated and diamond encrusted?"  Draco asked, trying to smooth his hair back as he set his wand down on the bedside table, then moved to sit down on one of the wingback chairs, that were actually not wingbacks anymore but oversize and very comfortable looking armchairs.
"Now that's a tough one."  Harry said, pleased when Draco laughed at him thinking THAT was the big problem here.  "Maybe we start trying to plan to meet as far in advance as possible.  Right now we just get in touch when we want to meet the day of.  I know sometimes we're not going to be able to plan ahead but... When we can, maybe."
Harry stopped, figuring they were far enough away now that no one could see or hear them.  He smiled as he held up the pair of socks he was holding.
Harry nudged Draco back and the blonde smiled a little more. "I don't think you should judge any family against any other."  He said, stretching his legs out in front of him.
----------------------------------
"You'll never believe this."  Ron said, flopping down onto a seat, leaning back as though he'd just been through something particularly harrowing and mind crushing.  "Malfoy's not a Prefect anymore.  Or at least he's not doing anything he's supposed to be.  Just lounging in his compartment with his mates."
Draco smiled at him tightly, already starting to put together his mind so he could resume being his 'normal' self outside the door of this refuge.
It wasn't often that he got just as 'Malfoy' back at his mother, but he was not in any mood for this.   Between dealing with his own feelings, dealing with that old letter and what he'd said to Harry and Harry KNOWING it all, and then dealing with the emotional upheaval of Harry being there...
Then he read the letter, letting Draco cry and take all of the time he might need to process this.
"You don't wear green pyjamas?"
Draco turned, scanning the people nearby to see who Harry might be talking about.  His eyes landed on Snape standing not too far away who was looking squarely at him in a rather dark and angry way. "Oh Merlin.  Those jokes you can make all you like, but I better go see what on earth he wants."
“I'm sorry but that doesn't...”
With a deep breath in he pushed open the door to the shop and stepped through.  There was no one else in the shop, which was both a blessing and a curse.  He didn't have to deal with lots of people, but it meant that a salesman immediately descended upon him as the door swung shut behind him.
It took every ounce of willpower Harry had not to take a swing at Snape.  How could he and Draco trust him to help, to REALLY help when he was so petty and dismissive?
“Whatever you need, Hermione.”  Harry said, letting out what he hoped sounded like a grateful sigh as he offered her what he hoped was also a grateful smile.
He was reluctant to leave, but he did need to get home again.
Later, though.
"You said that before and clearly didn't mean it."
“Mm.. Well there's a lot of training to become an Auror.  You finish school and decide that's what you want to do and then it's like school all over again.” Neville said, pushing into the yolk of his egg with a corner of his toast.  “So many courses you have to take and a lot you CAN take if you wish to.  Some of them were about the Muggle world.  I didn't feel like I needed that much extra training in some of the other areas so I took a lot of the Muggle world courses.  It was at least something different to learn.  And quite interesting.”
"Arsehole.  It's not about making him like you, it's about making sure he does things fairly."
Draco exhaled another long breath as the young man walked away and further into the store.  This was... Far more difficult than he'd thought.  Not being out in a store and talking to someone, that was actually not even something he was concerned about right now.  But the feeling of not having a clue what you're talking about.  Seeing the look of odd curiousity, pass over someone's face when you answered their questions with statements that did not add up.  He did NOT like that feeling.
It was brutally hard, they fought each other just as much as worked together.  Teeth and tongues clashing and pressing and searching and biting and forcing low noises from both of them.  Draco’s hand fisted tightly in Harry’s hair.  One of Harry’s hands slid down, squeezing the back of Draco’s thigh just under his ass.
Harry said nothing for a few moments as he looked at the contents of the drawer.  Dozens and dozens and dozens of folded letters were inside of it.  Enough that it looked overfull, looked like Draco was going to run out of room in it soon.
“Yes, mistakes
"And?"  Draco, on the other hand, spoke sharply.  He frowned, leaning forward in his chair again to watch Harry closely.  "Did she say anything to you?"
"Yeah.. I.."  Draco shook his head a bit, looking away for a moment before back at Harry again.  "Honestly I was crying in relief more than anything else.  Just..."
"No he wouldn't have."  Harry said, trying to keep his voice gentle but even he could hear the note of panic in it.
"Well done, Draco."  Paul said, his voice without inflection as he shook his hand.  The smile on his face didn't reach his eyes and it made Draco dislike him even more.
"That's awful."  Draco said, moving to stand next to Harry, looking at the desk.  "Even if you know it's a Boggart, some of the things it can turn into...  It's terrible just to see it, you can't get your head to wrap around turning it into something funny."
"You know I can't do that."  Narcissa let out a sigh of her own, shifting on the chair she was sitting in to look towards the fire.  "Even if I'd like to, you know I can't."
Harry trailed off then, pausing to take in a breath and let it out slowly.  "He found all the documentation.  With his Magical Seal all over it.  But he didn't do it."
"I know it is." Harry said, laughing a little more.  "It's ridiculous."
“What WAS that?” Ginny asked as she came back to stand next to him, looking at Astoria and Draco.
----------------------
“Do you want to talk about it?  About the conversation that made it happen?”
"Always."
When he was done he took a step back to look at the massive, glittering cake.  He'd done the fondant and icing in a creamy off-white, careful piping from his concealed wand had created icicle like drips and daubs that were artistic, especially when paired with the swirl of glittering coloured sugar crystals.
"And definitely not while under extreme amounts of pressure.  No one could make good decisions with a sword hanging over their head." Harry said, feeling an unreasonable amount of happiness when Draco flashed him a grateful smile.
-------
Draco shifted, moving in front of Harry as he fixed the icy, smirky, ego driven facade of his First Year self onto his face.  "You'll soon find out some Wizarding families are much better than others, Potter.  You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort."
Draco nodded first, then paused his brow furrowing and his head tilting.  “What ARE we working towards?  My.. task... isn't the full end goal here.  We do that, but.. then what?”
“Kill me then.  Merlin knows it would solve a lot of my problems if I was just DEAD.  And create a lot more for you, which would be a crowning achievement and make dying now worthwhile.”
"I have no desire to speak with you.  If this is about your grade plummeting from 'Exceeds Expectations' to 'Poor', you'll need to talk to your former Defence Against the Dark Arts professors as they clearly were grading you incorrectly."
Draco had to admit that in some ways that was appealing.
Draco didn't mind.
Harry couldn't help but smirk, raising his hand to press the back of it against his mouth to try and hide the look.  Which didn't really do the trick and made Draco colour even darker than before.
She was yelling now as she strode down the hall and it made Draco jump, made his heart leap into his throat as he dropped his arms from around Harry and pushed the door closed again.
“Nothing.”  Draco said, rousing from his darker thoughts, with a deep breath in, letting it out slowly as he smiled a little bit, sliding one of the mugs to Neville before carrying his own around to sit down on one of the stools as well.
Madam Pince had already been by their table three times, lingering with sharp, probing looks at them for daring to be having fun in her silent library.  Harry figured the next time would be the last and he wasn't ready to leave just yet.
Harry moved towards a bench under a tree to sit down and Draco sat down next to him.
"Yeah...  They're a bit nasty.  But they're a lot deeper in.  We don't have to go that far."  Harry pet a hand against the back of Draco's shoulder, honestly feeling bad for scaring him so thoroughly.
He didn't run this time.  He couldn't have done it very well anyways if he'd wanted to.  Harry still had him pinned against the tree, not to mention he well and truly had no bearings in the forest anymore.  No idea where to run to if he'd wanted to get away.
She turned back to Draco again, looking at him and waiting, clearly not interested in or thinking it necessary to repeat the question.
Harry grinned as he waved his hand a bit.  "He collects people he thinks will have connections for him later in life.  I met him this summer, Slughorn, he didn't waste any time in telling me he could get Holyhead tickets whenever he wanted and the Editor of the Daily Prophet always wanted to hear his opinion on the news.  Or that Honeyduke's send him a hamper every Christmas.  He likes influential people, we were there being vetted for him to decide if he wanted to keep us or not."
Harry shrugged one shoulder a bit, yawning and thus missing the look that passed between Ron and Hermione.
"Careful mate."  Ron said with a grin and a wink towards Hermione.  "She'll tell you top dollar just so her Ministry Department gets extra funding."
"Nope."
“Of course I didn't.  I don't know how any of this memory gathering was really his business.  And he could have just told me all of this in one meeting.  Two hours of conversation would have given me all the information he has, even if it's what he
Draco, for his part, felt slightly guilty at how little he fought against the idea.  He kept wanting to say something, kept wanting to argue, to refuse to stay, to start throwing things and shouting and screaming until he was let out again.  But that coward in him, that lousy, stinking, nasty little coward inside of him was so relieved.  So incredibly relieved.
He had been getting these letters for the past five years.  As the living heir and owner of Malfoy Manor, it directed security messages to him.
"I think first you give Snape a chance to tell you what he's doing, and we start trying to figure out how to secretly communicate with your mother."
"We're going to get kicked out!"  Draco said in a hissing whisper.  He raised one hand to wipe a tear off his cheek from laughing so hard at what they were doing.
He smiled, though, at all of the Aurors that had brought his things up stairs, and thanked whatever Gods might be listening that at least he had the top floor and wouldn't have to hear anyone stomping around above him.
“It's safer if you can't do magic.  People can't trace you as easily.”  Harry took the wand from Draco but didn't put it in his pocket.  He turned it over thoughtfully in his hands as he watched the other man.  “You'll learn how to do things the Muggle way, it won't take you long to catch on.”
"Somehow I don't think it would."  Harry squeezed the hand on Draco's shoulder, sighing softly, then shifted again to look around.  "Where are we..."
"I also think we need to try and find a way to secretly talk with your mother."
"Like I'd want to look." He managed to spit out, keeping his eyes level with Harry's shoulder.
"Is Scorpius going to have to do the same?  Marry someone you say he has to?"
Tom quirked one side of his mouth up, his eyes glinting that vague slightly red tone as they looked into Harry's green ones.  “I haven't done anything with you.  Yet.  Come.”
Just as Harry had remembered the one night they'd been in Malfoy Manor together just an hour or so before, Draco remembered as well.
The young man reappeared in just enough time for Draco to have started contemplating walking out, carrying a slim box and beckoning Draco towards the counter.
Another voice spoke.  An icy, clear and posh female voice that immediate sliced through Draco's warm little bubble.
It seemed perfectly natural for Harry to push his back up hard against the wall as he kissed him harder.. deeper...  Their lips parting and tongues meeting in a slide that Draco would have described as 'electric' if he'd had any idea what electricity actually was.
Harry nodded, keeping his hands in his lap and his eyes on Draco.  “Do you want it back?”
"Didn't want to be.  Too much else to think about this year, I could care less about holding order with students."  Draco couldn't help but smile just a tiny bit, finding this absolutely absurd conversation kind of interesting.  "Did I miss much at Slughorn's lunch?  Blaise didn't say much about it when he got back."
And he stood there frozen, suddenly realizing that with a camera crew, a mass of other people, two hosts and two judges roaming around, it was going to be a LOT harder to cheat and magic his way to success.  Doing it to GET to the competition was easy, but now maintaining it was... going to be more than tricky.
“He probably shouldn't see you with us.”  Hermione said sadly, sighing out a low breath but then bucking herself up again.  “But you're doing what needs to be done.  I could still use your help in the library, though.  After dinner tomorrow?”
Which he did.
"That would be even better."  Draco sighed softly, shifting under Harry who took that as a cue to slide away from the other boy.
Draco- No. I don't.
This was upsetting, though.  After he and Draco had parted a few nights back, after he'd been told what it was the other boy had been tasked with, he realized that if Borgin had been telling the truth, he HAD what it was Draco needed.
"Open up!"
"That's good thinking."  Draco nodded, slightly absently, but it was clearly because he was pondering, not because he wasn't interested.  "What do we do to meet now?  If Weasley and Granger are on your tail."
"You actually would rather stand here in the water with me.  Naked."
“Convenient..”
Which he WAS, but Draco resented being read so damn easily.
"No kidding."  Draco said with a short chuckle.  "Telling me I have nothing to worry about or not to worry generally means there is definitely something to worry about, they just don't want to say what it is."
"You didn't tell anyone."  Draco said, tilting his head in a bit.  "Because you figured I had good reason to want it."
"You too." Draco said, looking intensely into Harry's eyes for a few moments, then turned to walk back through the woods.
“You know her?”  The woman spat at him, stepping forward and pushing the photo closer to Draco's face.  “Look at her!!  Look close!  She's dead because of you!  Death Eater scum!  You should have been thrown in Azakaban with your parents!  You should be dead!  You should be DEAD!!”
That morning Hermione had smiled at him as she slid onto the bench next to him at breakfast.
"Apparently you do."  Harry said, pointing first outside, then moving the telescope to where his finger was.  "Look first, not through the telescope, just out the window."  He pointed again and Draco moved closer to him to look where he was pointing.
"I wasn't making a sound."  Draco said, his chin raising slightly though the tips of his ears went pink.  He knew that when he was lost in work or having trouble with something he did talk to himself.  But he didn't want to admit that to Harry.  To have to make noises like he was apologetic.  Not to HIM.
“No, Potter, but I want to know your actual motives because it truly is out of the ordinary.”
"Oh..."
Draco sat silently as Harry spoke, focusing as hard as he could so the words didn't just bounce off of him.  "Then someone forged them."
“Ron!”  Hermione whipped her head around to look at the other boy accusingly.  “Did you not just hear what Harry said about not underestimating the enemy?  He's absolutely right!”
Something that Harry found admirable.  Another piece of Draco that made him so desperately want to help him.
Muggles didn't know who he was.  Muggles wouldn't shout at him if he decided to try going outside.  Muggles wouldn't accuse him of things.
you, so much."
Draco has been writing letters to Harry for years. The first one he wrote he really did mean to send, but then he didn't... Since then he has been writing letters, sealing them, and putting them in a drawer. They're personal, and therapeutic, they tell Harry everything... But they're never ACTUALLY supposed to be sent to him...
Draco nodded as he sat down at the table, then got up again to go to the sink and wash his hands, speaking as he scrubbed.  "Very much so.  Malfoys have lived in it for as far back as any of us know.  Scorpius will take it over either when he gets married or when I just don't want to live there and be in his hair anymore."
“... Fine.  But just a short one.”  Draco frowned as he spoke, giving Neville a sour look even as the other man smiled at him gratefully.  “I need to change first.” He said,  getting up from the counter stool to go back to his bedroom without waiting for Neville to say anything.
name was on a memorial of the deceased at Hogwarts.
Draco's head spun as he kissed Harry, as Harry kissed him back.  As lips parted to teeth and tongues, both of them seeming to try and jockey for control and yet at the same time yielding to each other as well.
“Slower..  Breathe slowly...”
He turned his back to the judge, muttering to himself.  Already he was planning his bakes for next week, and thinking it would be an absolute pleasure to keep forcing Paul to grudgingly praise him for his performance.
“Help you?”  A young man, decidedly younger than Draco, asked with a smile that seemed FAR too big for his face.
"You could tell what he was doing, right?"  Draco asked, rubbing his hand over his arm again once the fabric covered it.  "I heard him screaming about it, angry that no one had figured that out before."
“He can't do anything straight forward.” Harry said in a dark and clearly frustrated tone.  “Everything has to be a fucking journey with him.  All these memories to visit, all this information to just watch and then he sits back and waits for me to put it all together.  We could have had ONE meeting, just one, where he laid out everything for me.  But of course it can't be as simple as that.”
"I didn't."  Harry said, but his eyes swung to the left, not meeting Draco's.
"What kind of son would you be to go against your mother's wishes?  She must feel incredibly strongly about this to write to me directly.  She'd never do that if it wasn't incredibly important to her."
He came first in the technical, clapping politely for everyone else around him and accepting a side hug from the woman next to him who had come second.  "Brilliant."  She whispered to him, giving him a squeeze.  "Just brilliant, young man like you doing so well."
Harry- Yes you can ask an Auror to go to Gringotts for you.  Actually, write up your withdrawal form and give it to one of the Aurors, I'll go myself since I'll be coming to see you soon.
"It's cold.."
He leaned over to turn on the lamp next to the couch, making a sharp sound and squeezing his eyes closed as the sudden light blinded him.
"I'm composed.  That's as okay as I'm going to get."  Draco nodded his head once, then looked over his shoulder back the way he came.  "I'll go first, if that's alright."
"I thought boyfriends were supposed to be supportive."  Draco said, pretending to look offended.  "You should be encouraging me."
"Thank you."  He said quietly,  turning his head out of Harry's grasp, trying to make it clear that he was done with him now.
"I'm having trouble getting away to meet with Draco without my friends prying about it.  I need to use you as an excuse whenever we want to meet.  I need to say I have detention with you and if anyone ever asks you, I need you to say it's true."
”That’s fair.”  Harry said with a nod, still itching to argue with Draco about saving his life and what that seemed to imply, but understanding that a line had been drawn with the sharpness of his speech.  “Do I have your permission to talk to him directly about this? I feel like maybe if I could just have a level conversation with him it might help.  This job isn’t jinxed anymore and barring any unforeseen circumstance he will have me as his teacher for seven years.  That’s a long time to try and learn around being afraid of someone.”
“Your WAND, Draco.  Hand it over, I don't know how you got it off me, but--”
Draco nodded without saying anything, unable to say anything as Harry got him out of the bathroom.  They were lucky it was dinner time, there was no one in the wide corridors as Harry half ran half pulled Draco with him towards the only place he could think of that they could go and be totally left alone.
As the shaking finally started to ease, Draco stretched out first his legs then his arms, turning to look at the clock.
“I just need to practice then.”  Harry said, but this time he said it with a smile.  This time he felt like this was something he was actually capable of doing and he was, he had to admit, kind of excited about the prospect of seeing if he could at least match half of Draco's apparent skill with it.
They stood there in silence for a couple of minutes, the room and the safety it provided always hard to give up.
Draco frowned, dropping his chin a bit as he thought about the word, trying to place it but coming up empty.  He shook his head at the darker haired boy.  "I don't think so.  Another of Dumbledore's riddles?"
"Someone should have taught me that much sooner."  Draco said, still chuckling a bit.  "Maybe rule number one should be 'don't make jokes about vampires to your party guest who will then laugh at said vampire'."
"Not yet."  Harry shrugged his shoulders, then chuckled.  "But maybe if the right granny comes along..."
"Once is an accident."  Harry said, tilting his head enough to catch the edges of his now sore lips against Draco's that were red and puffy and looked rather enticing.  "Twice is coincidence.  It's that third time that's a problem..."
But then he remembered the way Harry had looked at him when he agreed to return his wand.  The fact that he was doing him such a favour, giving him something no one else that was being hidden away was getting.
The tingling edges of panic that had started to grab at him slowly ebbed away.  He was grateful for that, though he knew that sometimes forcing all of that down came back to bite him in the ass later.
"Sure."  Harry said, lightly touching his fingers to the back of Draco's hip.  "Everything, every part of my life, is just lining me up to fight Voldemort once and for all.  Every year the fight has just gotten bigger and bigger.  I've been called everything from "The Boy Who Lived" to "The Boy Who Lies" to a hero, to an attention seeker to..." He gestured towards Draco's mirror where 'The Chosen One?'  flashed at him.  "I can't even start to count the number of times I've wanted to just grab my broom and fly away."
Unfortunately he muttered it too loud and was pretty sure he made an enemy of the girl who had 'scanned' his food who gave him an absolutely scathing look for his remarks.
"My hands weren't even dirty."
Paul right then.
What if Harry changed his allegiance? What if it was brought about accidentally? What if no one, not Harry, not his friends, not Borgin, not Voldemort, had any intention of it happening... But it did.
Harry followed without thinking twice, squeezing in next to him and shaking his head, still chuckling.  “I've never seen two people more shocked.  It was amazing...  But it isn't fair you're getting detention when we both wrote that essay.”
Draco couldn't help but smirk, one soft noise of laughter coming from his nose.  "No kidding."
"Oh that'll make him just LOVE me."  Harry spoke with exaggerated bounce to his voice and it made Draco laugh.
There was, though.  Draco was lying and he knew he was lying.  He didn't go out because of all the people that seemed to radiate hatred towards him.  He didn't go out because he didn't want to see smiling pictures of dead people who haunted him while he was awake and while he was asleep.
"I can?"  Draco asked, sitting down on the edge of his bed, laughing when Harry gave him a 'come on' look at pointed at one of the Bulgarian National posters on the wall.  "Oh right...  I suppose that's true.  If flying would solve anything I have a broom."
How could he say no now?
"Boyfriends are also supposed to stop you from making an absolute ass of yourself on what's now an internationally loved television show.  Which is what would happen if you ever got chosen as a contestant.  Which you wouldn't, there is no way you'd even be selected to audition."
Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco, taking a bite from his toast and chewing rather triumphantly.
“But..”  Draco pulled back a bit, just enough that he could see Harry properly.  “It's
This actually was a nice place.  And absolutely no one looked at him twice.  Not a soul...
“I want to know what climax Dumbledore is building to.  What memory or information he's making you work so hard for.”
“He regrets it all the same.”  Neville said a little more quietly, sighing gently.
“I'm fine.”  Harry said, raking a hand through his hair as Ron and Hermione cast him worried looks.
“Draco can tell you what Horcruxes are.  You best make it appear as though you're trying to get the memory, but....  Leave the actual task with me and perhaps we can get.. creative...”
"Yeah of course.  I didn't want that.  Not just because it overlapped Cedric being Champion but because I didn't WANT to do all the trials.  Regardless of what you or any of your friends think, I don't really like risking life and limb all the time.  I'd much rather just live a normal average life."
Draco shook his head almost before Harry was finished speaking."  Absolutely not.  Astoria and I are in complete agreement about it, as well.  It's funny.." Draco chuckled a bit, picking up another biscuit.  "We absolutely did not work as a married couple, but as parents we are
Re-telling in AU what happens when Harry finds Draco in the bathroom in book six. It wasn't supposed to be a chaptered fic but as I was writing it I realized there was no way to say everything in one part. So we'll see where it takes us!
"I almost was."  Harry admitted as he joined him, leaning back to look up at the lake bottom again.  "The Sorting Hat almost put me there.  But I had been rather brainwashed by everyone I'd talked to at that point into thinking Slytherin was bad so I was rather adamant about not being put here.  Now I wish I'd kept my mouth shut."
So instead of apparating away, he went into the kitchen to start looking for something he could eat without cooking.
"Fair enough.  I'll stop making jokes at the expense of potentially violent guests when it might get you into trouble."  Harry turned his head, then squeezed Draco's arm as he leaned in close enough to whisper to him.  "What about particularly greasy guests?"
Harry smirked and Draco resented him for thinking that he was being funny.
“I want you to let me off the wall so I can go to my common room.”
"I'm guessing that it's all hidden somewhere in the house."  Harry said, resting his hands on the back of one of the chairs across from Hermione's desk.  Pointedly not sitting and demonstrating that he wasn't planning to stay.  "The dust that is there makes me think no one cleaned for awhile when it was Voldemort's headquarters and then Lucius and Narcissa decided to bundle up all their most precious things and hide them against the idea that maybe one day they'd get out of Azkaban."
“Your family ring, yes... It's in Dumbledore's office.”  Harry said, his brow knitting slightly.
"You can use my owl, that's fine." Harry looked up at him and smiled, reaching a hand out again but just lightly touching the back of his.  "It's going to be okay."
"Doubt anyone will buy it if they can't get inside."  Ron scratched the back of his head where he'd been swatted, leaning back in his chair.  "And who'd want it unless they were going to tear it down.  And who'd spend money just
“Well.  I'm pleasantly surprised then.”  Harry continued smiling but he clearly thought that Draco was lying.
Draco was at the window of his Room of Requirement bedroom, looking outside and watching the peacocks.  He turned and looked over his shoulder at Harry who was seated on the floor going through one of the magazines that were strewn about the room.
But deep down Draco held a kernel of resentment that he'd been left behind.  He had no reason to think that way, no reason to feel that.  Harry and he had been enemies through school.  Totally opposing sides of everything.  There was no reason for Harry to have done something so incredibly risky for someone that he had never, not once, been able to trust even a little bit.
Draco paused again, a rather satisfied smile curving onto his lips as he rested his head back, his eyes half closing.  "He stood up again and touched a finger to my temple.  He said I was far more intelligent than anyone gave me credit for and perhaps he had underestimated me entirely.  Then he told me to tell you that he'd be in touch... and he left."
"Kind of."  Draco agreed, raising his head so he could see the other man, sighing out a short breath.  "Look...  I don't want to not see you just because of my mother."
“Since about eleven last night.  We do roughly eight or nine hour shifts, not on the dot but it just works out better that way.”
“Room of Requirement?”  Draco asked, already starting to walk in that direction.
"Say no right now and I'll stop."  Harry said, looking Draco square in the eyes.  His hands were stilled between them, waiting for Draco to respond.
“Have you handled it? Has Dumbledore?”
Draco smirked a bit, shifting as best he could against the floor.  "Let me out of this then?"
And Harry, luckily, receives a helping hand with a very big problem...
All at once he screamed when something grabbed him from behind and he twisted around, flailing at whatever it was, his wand dropping down onto the ground.  His attacker was laughing at him, sick and twisted thing it was!  Laughing and it was going to cart him off into the woods, it was going to eat him or kill him or it was...  It was...
No no, it couldn't possibly be that...
"Funny thing.  He goes missing, everyone assumes he's with family or dead or what have you, but maybe he isn't."  Ron spoke with a mouthful of food and smiled when Hermione swatted the back of his head.
“I do need your wand.”  Harry said, far more gently than he probably should have given the fact that Draco had taken it back from him and used it in his absence.
He turned, thumping his back against the stone wall, sliding down it to sit on the floor, resting his head on his knees as he tried to get his breath back.  If it was a test, he had definitely failed.
"Before you were born.  Not too much before, though.  I saw your mother, your uncle and your grandfather.  And I saw your father from a distance as well.  Your uncle was in trouble, there was someone from the Ministry there trying to lay down the law..."
"I am not having this conversation with you.  It's foul."  Draco turned, heading towards the edge of the bath, but he stopped there, realizing that he'd have to get out again.  Have Harry see him again.  And maddeningly and ridiculously, there was more to see right that moment.
“Fashionable...”  Draco said, the word coming out a little breathlessly as he still worked to breath properly and his heart came back to it's normal rhythm.
Draco stayed quiet for a few moments, rather taken aback by Harry's answer.  He clearly had thought that by phrasing it the way he had, that Harry would realize what he was saying and champion ahead towards saving Dumbledore.  Not tell Draco that he was, in fact, what mattered most.
“It turns out,’ Harry said, looking over at Draco carefully.  “That the majority of people like their peaceful lives.  Myself included.”
“You admit you’re disappearing.” Harry’s expression lifted a bit, looked more hopeful like he might be getting somewhere.
“Ooo...  Scary word, Potter.”  Draco couldn't help himself.  He smirked when Harry spoke about trusting him,  the whole situation absolutely insane, really.
“This would do it.”  Harry said, running a hand over the side of the Cabinet, still not quizzing Draco any further about it.  “But if it's broken I can understand not wanting to even give it a shot...  If you got stuck, then what...”
"I know."  Draco said with a nod, sighing softly.  "But I don't understand why it matters so much to her or to anyone at this point..."
"No you wouldn't.  Do you like standing here?  Talking with me?  We've never truly had a conversation before, have we..."
Draco turned away from the television to watch (rather smugly) the look on the other man's face as Harry took in all of the changes that Draco had made.  He had
“Oh for...” Draco half laughed and half groaned, resting his forehead down against his arms.  “I know how to make a bloody sandwich, Longbottom.  I am not entirely helpless.  If it doesn't require cooking, I will do fine.  I KNOW how to do basic things without waving my wand around.  But if you ask me to cook with the Muggle.. things..” He paused there, gesturing vaguely at the stove and what Harry had called the 'toaster' before he continued  “Then I don't know what to do.”
He wanted to scream, he wanted to cry.  He wanted to laugh and smile and bang his head on the desk.  And also he kind of wanted to apparate as far away from everything in his life as he possibly could and just BREATHE for awhile.
Within five minutes he was fast asleep on the couch, the remote falling the short distance to the rug from his relaxed fingers.
Draco tipped one hand over the other like he was closing a book, smiling at Harry.  “Just close the book.  It doesn't take a lot of muscle or effort, you can even think of it like one of those diaries that have locks on them.  Close it, lock it.  Calm and casual...”
Draco smiled and nodded slightly, resting his wand against his chest, keeping his eyes on the stars above him.  He was still getting used to this new Harry.  The one that listened to him and gave him the same consideration he gave his actual friends.  The one that sat with him and let him cry and scream or sit in silence for hours and never questioned it.  "What do you think I should do?"
“I'm not surprised.”  Draco mumbled, getting busy with putting away the milk and sugar cubes that were on the counter.
Draco watched, listening closely as Neville finished running through the stove instructions, getting eggs and bacon on to cook before he explained about the oven and how that worked.  Together they got the chicken in the oven and by then it was time to flip the eggs and the bacon, which Draco did without help.
"Good.  The Dark Lord doesn't want any harm to come to Harry Potter unless he is the one to deliver it."
"Ass!"  Draco smacked the side of Harry's arm, getting up and brushing off his clothing, smoothing his hair again.  "That was incredibly undignified."
As mad as he was, as absolutely rage filled as he was right then, Draco couldn't help but laugh.  It was a tight noise that seemed reluctant to come from him, but it forced it's way out all the same.
“I think you
"Is it?"  Draco asked, bitterness stinging the two words.  "How can you be so sure?"
“SO sensitive..”  Draco said, smirking just a bit as he fiddled with his mug.  “Stop, Longbottom.  I'm not reformed, I'm not contrite, I'm still a Malfoy.  But I am an adult now.  And years without the influence of nasty parents, and Voldemort taking up your house space has actually softened me around the edges.”
Silence stretched for a full couple of minutes before Draco spoke again to break it, his voice a little softer.  “I knew you were looking at me.”
That looked like a bit of fun.  He could do without Pansy, really, but the rest...
"Ah."  Draco said, and rolled his eyes as he looked away.
"I don't know what happened."  He said, shaking his head and getting a spoon to try and fish the eggs out.  "Honestly just being here... It's so much more full on than you expect it to be."
Draco was finally getting around to asking Harry about the Dementor attack.  A story he really wanted to hear to compare to what his father had said happened.
He thought...
"I would have thought you'd be glad not to know."
you this time.”
"And did they?"  Tom asked, having stopped moving, regarding Harry with open curiousity.
“I called it an eh-phone.  It's an Iphone.”
"Dumbledore has always told me that Snape was with them.  I never really believed it." Harry growled the words out.
Narcissa spoke stiffly, and unless Borgin was mistaken there was a trace of fear there.  On the surface her loyalty was worn proud, but under it was the imprisonment of her husband, and whatever task Draco had been set up to do.
"No.  I don't."    He stopped there again, then sighed softly.  "We really aren't together.   We are for show, according to anyone who knows us we're together and happy.  But she and Scorpius live... I don't know where, actually.  I've never been to where she lives now."
Later, Luna Lovegood had joined Ollivander.  Just as kind, just as friendly, though her interpretation of events and her manner of being was altogether different.
"It's not alright."  He said, sighing softly.  "It isn't."
“Why would I be mad?  Voldemort didn't set you to kill ME.  And even if he did, it's him asking for it, not you.”
"To find a way around it."  He said, seeing the relief flood Draco's face.  "There has to be a way around it, there has to be something we can do."
Tom definitely looked like this information was everything he had every been looking for.
“Fine.  Whatever.  I'll teach you the basics and then leave you alone.”
Draco couldn't help but smile, catching one of Harry's hands with both his own.  "Good idea.  Yeah.. then I won't wonder if she's there or not.  I think that so long as I'm blunt she'll listen...  Can we do something so the message burns or disintegrates after she puts the parchment down?"
“You knew?”  Draco's eyes narrowed as he looked at the other man, then shook his head a bit, relaxing his gaze.  “Of course you knew, sorry.  Wasn't a secret after the war, was it.  And Potter had been there, Potter got everyone out.  Thank Merlin..”
"He came to you in a dream?"
And a promise that Draco probably can't keep.
Draco laughed at that, raising one eyebrow in a gesture Harry never had been able to master, and he had tried, shaking his head.  “I’m sorry...  You want a peaceful life but you’ve taken a job as a professor?”
"I wouldn't have thought that would matter to you."
He finished with the cherries, tipping them into the bowl and letting them mix while he prepared his baking pans.  He carefully cut parchment paper by hand to line them, then poured an equal amount of batter into all four of them.  He slid the full pans into the oven and closed the door, carefully sliding his wand out again to tap the oven with, springing it to life magically to take care of baking his cakes.
“You’re the one pinning me against a wall, Potter.
"My Aunt and Uncle flip out, thinking I've done something to Dudley.  Dudley thinks I've done something to him as well.  And at the time it seemed massively unfair but looking back now I understand why they thought that..  So we're having a bit of a row and then I get a message from the Ministry saying I've been expelled from Hogwarts for the use of underage magic and that Ministry Officials are going to be turning up to take my wand."
-------
“Your wand, please, Draco.”  Harry held his hand out to the other man, the slight curve of his lips turning into a full smile.  “As you agreed.”
"You think you can trick me into whatever is going on?  Talk to me nicely, JOKE with me and I'll fall for it that easily?"
“It didn't.”  Harry said, leaning forward, his chin jutting out a bit in defiance.  “You're punishing him for his parents.”
He'd purchased Mimir not long after things had settled after the war.  It had been one of the first trips out he'd made, one of the only trips he had made that had been stress free and no one had yelled at him.  When that started happening, and he stopped going out, Mimir was pretty much the only other living thing he interacted with, making them quite a tight knit pair.
Both boys sat in silence in the water, long enough for Draco's anger to ebb away a bit, the sting of it leaving him slowly, washing away into the water and leaving his mind more room to focus on other things.
Draco nodded slightly, still feeling a bit of that sink in his stomach he'd had in third year when Lupin had explained the Boggart and the process of defeating it.
"Cheers."  Harry said to the person he set them down, picking up one and handing the other to Draco.  "Come on, we can go to the park."
"Make me."
"Do you think I'm that shallow and fickle?"  Harry asked with a smile, raising his eyebrows.
Not like this was the first time in almost the full seven years since the war that they had seen each other.  Which was, actually, the truth.
"With everything else going on, you're investing your time with me."
“See you, Potter.”
His eyes rested on the mirror for a few moments, thinking something was out of place before he realized the article about himself, the Daily Prophet's "Chosen One?", wasn't there anymore.  He supposed the Room might not get everything exactly right every time.  But he thought it more likely that the 'owner' of the room had removed it when he noticed it was there.
"It's funny who can become our ally when we just let our minds relax and be more welcoming."  Dumbledore said, then chuckled when he saw Harry's cheeks go red.  "I'm not shaming you, Harry.  Your accusations were not exactly off point, were they?  You knew Draco was up to something and you were right.  I had always known you were right, I simply just didn't want you to get involved, things had to play out the right way.  I just wanted you to trust that it wasn't your problem to deal with."
"I know you aren't stupid."  Draco said, startling Harry who jerked his head around to look at the other boy.  "I know you know who I was talking about."
But if it
“I suppose you have...”
"Draco told me everything.  He told me about what Voldemort wants him to do.  He told me you wanted to help him.  He told me you made an Unbreakable Vow to his mother and it was because we talked about it that he came to you and asked for help.  He also told me that you spent the summer feeding Voldemort wrong information about me and Dumbledore.  Let me off the wall, I'm not actually here to cause trouble."
"He'd want to know why you're so sure you and your mother will be safe.  You'd have to tell him about the safe house.  You'd have to tell him about sending her an owl.  And we're not supposed to let there be ANY threads of links back to you."
He got up, restless, and moved to look out the window again.  Harry slid to sit up and moved to the edge of the bed again as he watched the blonde boy.  Then he got up and went to join him at the window, standing slightly behind him to look over his shoulder and down into the gardens.
"How am I acting abnormal?"
He never finished that thought.  Someone had grabbed his arm and pulled hard, forcing a none too suave noise from him that would have broke any illusion of superiority he was projecting in that moment.  "What... STOP.. I---"
"Well I can't really blame her."  Draco said, smirking up at Harry and shaking his head.  "I presented myself as a completely different person in school, I never gave any inkling about what I really thought or felt because it just 'isn't done'.  After the war and being away from school and with my father in prison for good I didn't feel like I had to be quite the pureblooded little viper I had been before.  It isn't her fault that she was expecting someone else.  It was mine."
"Why do you think you can make that decision?"
Draco's mouth snapped shut with an audible click and grind of teeth as his face flamed in colour and he bent to pick up his books, straightened his robes and moved to the east side of the tower.  He did not thank Harry, he considered the fact that he didn't call him names or tell him to leave the tower so he could work alone thanks enough.
-------------------------------------------------------
Harry furrowed his brow as he looked at Draco, catching on after a few moments of silence what all the unasked questions really were.  "I don't know what's happened this year."  He admitted, shifting to rest his back against the wall again.  "All the things that I thought were SO important and so meaningful... It's like I see them for what they really are.  What the people really are, what they're fighting against by opposing Voldemort.  And Dumbledore.."  Harry raised his eyes to Draco's face, snorting a bit.  "All he ever does is say 'Now I'll tell you everything..' and then proceeds to tell me half of things.   And never in a straight forward manner, either."  Harry huffed, scuffing his foot against the floor angrily.  "Always in riddles, always in round about fashion."
"All those sweaters came from Weasley's mother? I thought you bought those or something."
Harry laughed, taking Draco's arm and leading him across the crowded room.  "Okay rule number one?  Don't laugh at vampires when they're in earshot."
disarm him and remove the wand forcibly if he had to.  Completely certain Draco wouldn't curse him back to keep him off it.  Which...  He was right about.  Draco wouldn't curse him.  Or jinx him or hex him or.. anything.
He got up, leaving the letter on his desk instead of putting it in the drawer.
"You do a pretty good job."
"Twenty Galleons.  A mere twenty Galleons and it is yours."  Borgin said with a hint of a weasel like smile.
“Come off it, Potter.” Draco said with a slight growl in his otherwise amused voice.  “What do you think you could do to me to make me tell you anything?”
And in return he had said- “Twenty points to Mister Nott for causing such extreme pressure.”
"Draco..."  Harry said after a moment, making a soft noise and surprisingly colouring red in his cheeks.  "Draco, do you remember everything you put into that first letter you wrote me?"
"Thanks for your help today."
Draco rolled his eyes, rubbing a hand against the back of his neck as he bit his tongue.  He'd figured out what it was that was so different between Harry and Neville and his interactions with them thus far.
Now, though...  Now Harry had access to Malfoy Manor.  The last place he suspected Draco had been.  He had, Harry figured, at the very least returned there for a few days, and if there was any possibility that Harry could trace those last days and find him, he would.
After a session with Dumbledore the night after they return, Harry once again ventures into the Slytherin Dungeons to find Draco and catch him up with some very interesting information.
Then he felt Harry, heard the grated groan, felt the twitch of him against his own sensitive flesh.
They were sitting in a small restaurant half a block from Draco's flat.  Harry had marched him up and down streets in the area repeatedly until Draco was no longer disoriented and could find his way around easily.
"Harry."  The blonde boy stepped out from a thick clump of trees, black and stark in the dim moon light, making Draco's pale skin and hair glow almost as much as his Patronus did.
."  She said the incantation then flicked her wand to the left, the right and then forward.
"Ah, now see...". Harry grinned, leaning his arms onto the desk so he was closer to the other man, pointing a finger at him.  "This is a
He looked longingly at his bed as he got dressed, but knew that the worst thing he could do was keep messing with his sleep schedule.  At one point, early into the seven years he'd spent trying to stay inside and manage the attacks he kept having, he ordered a book from Flourish and Blotts about keeping a healthy mind.  One of the most important things the book (which had been mostly annoying and spoke to it's reader like it was better than them) had said to do was keep a regular sleep schedule.  That getting regular rest at regular times was very important.
"You're a good sport."
Draco tried to hold onto a straight face but couldn't do it for more than a few seconds before he snorted out a laugh.  “I'm only joking.  I don't have any use for Tinder.”
“Make it worth my while to tell you.”
--------------------------------------------
But at one window, Draco did fully stop and stare.  It was a window full of screens like televisions, but not all of them were televisions like his.  They were all different, and all doing different things.  There were even small rectangular things like televisions on stands, with signs above them shaped like arrows that pointed at them.
"Everything?"  Harry stood up straight, his brow furrowing a bit.
He hadn't spoken to Theodore since the morning of the Battle.  They'd woken up together in Draco's bed, neither of them knowing what they day held so neither of them said much of anything out of the ordinary.
What they were doing was sitting in the back of the library writing the 'bad essay' that would be handed in to Snape by Draco.  They had finished the good essay for Harry quite quickly and as neither of them made any moves towards wanting to leave, they decided to write the bad one together as well.
Draco just sat there, his brow furrowed as he looked at the window, half expecting the coin to come back.  But he realized how foolish that was rather quickly.
As Astoria nudged Scorpius towards the train, Draco straightened and brushed off the knee of his trousers, turning his head and catching Harry's gaze from across the platform.  They stood looking at each other for a long few moments before, rather surprisingly, Draco moved to walk towards Harry.
“To turn a hand black and dead....?”  Draco looked confused for a moment, then understanding crossed over his face as he looked at Harry in shock.  “Dumbledore's hand, you mean...”
“I see...”  Harry said, filing all of that information away.
"Why did you put him on the team then?"  Draco added a few tiny little flies around the Snape drawing, smiling a bit to himself with obvious satisfaction.
“You speak as though this is your shop.”  Draco said, tilting his head a bit.  “Is it?  I was here not long ago to get the phone, I didn't see you.”
His world softened a bit at a time, sounds started coming from the distance they were supposed to.  He could feel the carpet under him, sense the flat around him.
"And so he was a kid to you?  In an.. orphanage?"
"Even if you DID know what I was in there for, how does that prove you're not trying to trap me into something?"
Draco and Harry meeting in the Room of Requirement to discuss how to try and continue appearing like everything was normal over Christmas break.
“You'll have to have someone teach you how to cook.”  Harry said, looking at Draco rather sternly.  “And how to do the washing up.”
"Our family has enough troubles as it is, Draco.  Don't go looking for more."
And he was.
"It'll hurt.." Harry breathed the words out above Draco, his hips between his thighs and the blonde boy's hand around his cock, urging him forward.
Time passed un-noticed to Draco as he was lost in memory and eventually his head lolled against the back of the couch as he dropped into sleep.  Full dark came, chasing every last scrap of light out of the apartment, but he was comfortable there and not even noise from the street through the open window roused him.
“Easy..”  Neville's hand smoothed onto his back and he sank back into the actual moment and felt his heart racing and realized his breathing had become erratic again.
Harry laughed as well, the remaining dregs of tension melting between them in that moment.
Draco let the silence stretch until the gaze Harry had on him started to make his skin itch, then huffed out a low breath, tilting his head up from his phone just enough to look at the other man.  “What?”
“What exactly does that mean?”  Draco furrowed his brow, leaning a bit closer to the other boy.
“Well it would go a lot faster if you ACTUALLY helped Harry and I.”  Hermione said rather hotly, slamming her book shut and shoving it away before picking up another. She opened it at the beginning, flipping through the title pages before she paused.
Or perhaps it's the company he has to see the Muggle World with?
"All of it?"  Draco asked incredulously, looking at everything spread out.  There was so much, so many different stacks, so many forms, so many letters...
Harry was leaning against the open doorframe, his arms crossed loosely over his chest while Draco stood on the front step.  He couldn't help his mind wandering ever so slightly to how good Harry looked standing there.  That casual lean against the house that looked so natural and so...
Draco only got half a word out before he saw Harry's wand point at him, heard him speak but didn't catch the words as his entire body felt wrapped in ropes.  He struggled to get free and slid off the chair onto the floor.
exactly that for years.  And then the Ministry officials came knocking just a few days ago.
The silence stretched between them, long enough that Draco looked up to Harry's face to make sure he hadn't somehow offended him.  Far from offence, when he met Harry's eyes he saw something softer there, almost sympathetic.  It made his heart hammer a little harder in his chest and he watched as Harry took in a breath, clearly about to say something before he was interrupted by their boxes of chips being set down on the counter.
Draco spoke quietly and the words seemed to hang there, floating like visible things between them.  Harry, for a few moments, felt like they'd sucked the air right out of his lungs.  So stark was the immediate realization that he did, actually, care more about keeping Draco safe than keeping Dumbledore alive.
They all sat in a line at the end of the judging, they'd had a break while the judges filmed their separate discussion with Sandy and Noel, talking about who had done well and was in line for Star Baker, and those who hadn't done well and were in danger of going home.
Draco had faltered at the mention of the war, swallowing hard and stepping back towards the couch to sit down heavily against the edge of it.  He didn't want to talk about the war.  He didn't want to think about any of that.  He didn't want to hear how Neville 'didn't hold a grudge' and that he thought he was someone that had been involved involuntarily.
“You don't know who he is, do you.”  Harry shoved his hands into his pockets, taking a few steps closer to Draco and looking up to the blonde's face.
The incantations Hermione had just taught him, would actually help him locate the missing items. He was to tap the spot and say the first incantation which would search for it within the house.  If nothing happened he could say the second part and it would send the spell out to look away from the house.  It wasn't immediate, and Hermione admitted she had never used the incantation because anything she was looking for (or, more often, Ron was looking for) always ended up being in the house, so she never had to use the second part.
Harry and Draco steal a bit of time on the train to catch up in person rather than in owl, and Harry is SO pleased to see how much Draco seems to be reforming into his old self.
Harry left first, looking at the map that Draco now knew everything about to make sure it was clear before he slipped out the door.  Once he was gone Draco let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding.  Now alone he went over to the mirror where the Daily Prophet clipping was and took it from the mirror. He had forgotten it was there until Harry had made reference to it that day, otherwise he would have removed it the first time they were there.  It spoke a little too loudly about something he wasn't ready to say anything about.
Because maybe Harry's first priority was making sure Draco was safe.
"It works... on two levels.." Harry sputtered through gasps for air and laughter.
"I don't really know which ones I used but it wasn't quite this...  My towels still smell of it, did you want one?"
Harry shook his head, pressing his hand a little harder against his back.  "No.  I thought you adored your father."
Not wanting to stand and hover near the doorway of the building which might have invited one fo the Aurors to talk to him and ask him if he needed anything, he turned right and started walking down the street even though he wasn't completely sure it was the right way.  It didn't really matter, though.  Even if he walked and didn't find the store he could pick some shop to go into like he had
It was Harry.
"I had to come now." Draco said quietly, his eyes raising to meet Harry's as he stepped forward, closer to the other boy.  "Or not at all."
He would much rather lock the doors on the Manor and take his chances.  It was easier.  And... more comfortable...  In a lot of ways.
Harry shifted and leaned over, Draco felt warm lips touch his cheek and somehow that spurred him to move again, shifting with a low noise to look at Harry who was pulling back from him.
Harry shifted a bit, bracing himself to feel a flare of anger about the direct and abrupt reference of his parent's murders.  But it never came...  "I do sometimes.  But recently it hasn't mattered so much.  Without their deaths I wouldn't be standing here right now, would I?"
"And if you ever need anything." Draco said in return, letting go of Harry's hands with an ache and a regret that he felt would never fully resolve within him.
The latter raised both eyebrows as he looked at the cake and then to Draco.  "Well, it looks neat.  Good presentation.  I like your colour palette.  But how does it taste..."
"I always wondered if Fudge had any dealings with Voldemort..."
“I'll see you in the morning.”  Harry said, smiling as they left the Room of Requirement.  They parted at the stairs and Harry watched Draco walk down and through the hall until he couldn't see him anymore. He wished more than anything right then that he and Draco didn't have to go their separate ways.  That he could have kept talking to him all the way to Slytherin and all the way to their dorm.  Probably continuing to talk until they both fell asleep.  With a low breath he turned to head to Gryffindor, more than ready to call it a night.
"This week, our first week, I get the pleasure of naming the first Star Baker."  Noel said, absolutely beaming in front of them.  "And it goes to someone who's possibly made Paul's eyebrows shoot clear off his face more than once this weekend.  This week's Star Baker is.... Draco."
“Maybe...”  He said, despite how his insides shrieked the contrary to the request.  “But I doubt you'll convince Potter.”
“I didn't go out.”  Draco said, his brow creasing a bit.  “Why would I go out?”
"Well.  You're welcome."  Harry said, touching his glasses as Draco looked up at him with a fairly direct gaze.  "What?"
Harry relaxed a bit then, letting out a low breath as his lungs burned slightly from holding it.  Even when Draco had assumed that Harry was going to go to Hermione for answers and help in getting an owl and figuring out how to safe guard the message to Narcissa, Harry was already thinking he was going straight to Dumbledore with it.
Draco shrugged, swallowing roughly.  "All I was thinking was I wanted to go home."
I just...  I wasn't expecting that.  Are you really?  Or are you just joking with me because I am?"
He stepped through the doorway into the flat, trying to ignore the eager and expectant faces of the Aurors that had just finished sweeping the place for safety before letting him in.
"Good."  Harry said,  sliding his hand up to the centre of Draco's back, feeling the warmth of the smaller boy through his shirt.
"Absolutely not."  He said, putting a hand against the front of the drawer protectively.  "Just like the one you got, they were to you but they weren't actually for you.  Well.. Except for the very first one.  I did intend to send it, I just never did."
“I never thought I would have either.”  Harry admitted, raising his shoulders in a small shrug.  “But I suppose I was sort of pushed into what I felt I should believe from the start.”
He knew Harry was talking, but the sound of his voice was very distant in his brain.  Foggy and far away and totally removed from the way his world was narrowing at the corners.  His vision darkened at the edges, sharpened in the center.  He was both hyper aware of everything and aware of nothing at the same time.
“I don't understand, though...”  Draco took a sip from his mug, looking at Neville curiously.  “How did your first one not work for you?  Thats kind of the whole point of wands.”
Harry felt a surge of anger mixed with... something else entirely as he looked at him.  Hated himself for that ‘something else’ which was supposed to be gone.  It was supposed to be done.  It couldn’t keep coming back, but it did.
"No, I want to tell you."  Draco said, looking up to the dark haired boy.  "I'm just not supposed to know about this either.  I guess that doesn't really matter now...  My father had a cottage.  Well, he called it a cottage but it was actually a safe house.  He and my mother don't know that I found out about it.  But no one else knows, it was supposed to just be for us if we needed it.  He went there a lot last year, things started getting... bad."
“I want one...”  He said, looking back at the window again.  “I haven't a clue what I'd do with one, but I want one.”
And it made him feel about ten years old.
"Close.  Tap twice on the spot first, then say the incantation and flick your wand up."  She demonstrated again, then smiled when Harry mimicked her exactly.  "Perfect.  Then the next part is
"What is that?"  Harry asked, curiosity winning out over animosity.
"I'm glad to be able to show you a bit of the Muggle world.  Thank you for agreeing to come."
It wasn't a surprise, he had known what Harry had immediately gone and told Neville after their last 'visit'.  But it was still uncomfortable to try and swallow Neville knowing and BADLY covering for his sake.
“How long have you been working?”  He set the milk down on the counter, added what he thought was cream as well and then went looking for sugar cubes.
"No sir.  I don't think he would have really tried to stop me, but he feels so guilty about anything having to do with you.  I think it will be hard for him to hear you're helping him..."
Draco sighed, leaning his side against the couch, turned towards Harry.  "I wish you could come home with me."
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
Draco let out a bitter sort of laugh then, it slipped out without him realizing it or meaning to and he sighed, realizing he'd have to talk now.  He then turned and did the same as Harry, sliding down the door to sit on the floor, his back against the door.  "I'm not okay."
“I didn’t mean...” He started, but Draco just shook his head at him.
--------------------
He'd hugged Hermione before.  Ron, too, once or twice.  But just short sort of hugs that had patting on the back involved.  Friendly hugs that you gave to your friends.
"So.. What is all this?"  He asked, sitting down in the chair he'd unceremoniously fallen out of, rubbing one of his wrists where it had hit the floor.
Draco let out a low breath as Harry looked down.  He took a few steps back and sat down on the couch, staying quiet and just waiting.
Eventually he knew it was either do it, or put it off for the night.  And that second option wasn't one he would take.  He couldn't just put things off, Draco didn't have the luxury of time to pamper Harry's vanity and pride.
"And I was thinking I wanted somewhere safe to bring you.  Makes sense.."
He was turning his coffee cake carefully out of the pan when he looked up and caught the eye of the woman who'd hugged him yesterday.  She smiled at him and turned more towards his bench.
He'd spent the past fifteen minutes walking back and forth in this hallway, trying to convince himself to stop and knock.
"There's nothing wrong with that."  Harry said, frowning slightly.  "From what I know about my mom, I don't think she would have been the knitting me sweaters and mittens type either."
“I... certainly did not...”  Draco unfolded his arms, scraping the edge of his thumbnail against the line of his jaw a few times.  “But why on earth would he WANT to be assigned to my protection in particular?  I was arguably more horrid to him than I was to you.”
Harry looked at Draco, really looked at him for a few moments, then spoke a little more softly.
Draco nodded and Harry smiled, lightly brushing a hand against his arm.  Draco was getting a crash course in everything that Harry had sort of come to understand years before.  Even before Dumbledore started showing him all these memories, he had seen Tom in the Chamber of Secrets, so he wasn't shocked, but he did understand how Draco must be feeling.
And he remembered Longbottom (Was that REALLY Neville?  He was still struggling with that.) laughing at what he had said the day before.  And him bringing him the bubble tea that morning.  And teaching him the television remote.
He rolled folded the parchment into a self contained little packet, writing Theodore's name on it.  He was just about to call the project complete when another memory surfaced.. Bits and pieces at first... Then the whole of it flowed like he'd managed to unstop a river.
“And you say you aren't reformed.”
Once Harry had sat at the Slytherin table for breakfast, and had just begun winning over the people around him when Snape unceremoniously ordered him back to Gryffindor.  Which was a bummer, it had been fun having Harry sit next to him.
"Are you CRAZY?" Draco asked with a surprised laugh.  "That's not exactly keeping things normal and not suspicious..."
He untied the parchment, then took in a sharp breath when he turned it over.  His eyes bounced from the small little scratch of the funny Slytherin crest, to his name written in a heavy, spiky and slanting script that hadn't changed at all from school.
Draco had hoped, perhaps, that had just been a fluke.  Or that maybe he was more of a shy type person and that was why he hadn't met his gaze before.  But he knew, deep down, that he was just trying to make things up to make himself feel better.  And that became very clear as true, very quickly.
He'd had his first panic attack a year and a half after the war had ended.  He had come out of Diagon Alley and was crossing through The Leaky Cauldron when some witch had stepped right in front of him.
“Not particularly.  I'd rather we had a chance to talk about everything.  Last night was...”  He trailed off, his brow furrowing a bit as he tried and failed to search for the right words.
They fell silent again, letting it stretch while they looked at each other before eventually, again, Draco shifted.  "I need to go."
"No.." Draco smiled, slightly embarrassed.  "No I don't.  I just didn't think you were quite so pushy."
“You don't have to know how to use it to have it.  Having it gives you the opportunity to learn it.  I mean... If I'm constantly looking to TEACH you things I should definitely be more encouraging towards you using the internet.  It's an absolutely massive part of the Muggle world.”  Harry said, smiling a little more brightly.
Tom said the word again, holding his hand out where he was standing in front of the Pensieve.  Harry moved closer, letting the other boy take his wrist and pull him in.  The Pensieve had a memory floating in it, but rippling in the silver that Harry was used to seeing were very tiny threads of red.
"Really?  That doesn't seem right."  Harry said, pushing himself to stand so he could walk towards the smaller blonde boy.  "I don't know why Ginny or Neville would get invited and you wouldn't.  I figured you just didn't want to go.  Ron and Hermione said you weren't on Prefect Duty."
Draco could have sworn he saw Kreacher's bulbous eyes brim with tears at such a kind gesture.  He nodded to Harry without speaking and the dark haired man straightened up then.
"Hermione, I mean it."  Harry said when Hermione bit her lip and looked at him worriedly.  "There isn't anything we can do, even if there was something to what Malfoy was doing, it's not our business."
"Maybe he just didn't know the right information."  Harry shifted on the bed, shoving his hands under his thighs so he didn't do anything stupid.
Harry stood in the same place long after the quiet sound of Draco's footsteps had lapsed.  Watching the place between the tree's he'd last seen him.
“Draco is incredible with magic.”  Harry said quickly with a bit of a smile, his eyes wandering towards the grimy windows.  “Really, he's got that natural sort of flair.  I always wanted to have that, I feel clunky doing magic next to him when he just seems to do it so effortlessly...  A lot of really complicated stuff as well.  I mean, just last week he...”
Year 7, November 1997-  5 Months Before
Even if he was using magic to put things together, he still had to think up good combinations and decorating ideas.
Harry thought it out slowly, then started to nod just as slowly.  It wasn't exactly what they'd been aiming for, but it was, actually, a very good idea.  If Draco's mother went missing, it would generally be thought Draco would be safer at Hogwarts, not at home, in case he was in danger as well.  None of the Death Eaters could come and get him here, not without every professor knowing.  Voldemort definitely wouldn't come here for him.  And no one would likely suspect Draco of having anything to do with his mother disappearing.  Given that his father was in Azkaban, it would be pretty much assumed that it had something to do with Voldemort so...
"No offence taken, I don't like her much either."  Draco said, settling his shoulders against the padded back of the bench.  "Anyways, she practically pounced on me and was saying that I just needed to tell her the information I had and she'd take it to him, that there was no reason for me to need to see him directly.  I think my mother wanted to agree with her, but I insisted.  I told her straight out that the information I had was PERSONAL in regards to him and that I wasn't comfortable telling people his personal information when he may not want it known.  She kept trying to insist and I just kept saying no..."
"Oh..." Draco realized then what Harry was talking about and he chuckled a bit, embarrassed.  "You went into the Prefect's bathroom once, right?" When Harry nodded he continued, feeling a little silly.  "There's too many faucets, I counted wrong and.." He shrugged again rather helplessly, smiling when Harry laughed.
Harry rolled his eyes, then paused, and the look on his face suddenly made Draco thinking he would actually like to leave.  Right this second, yes please.
Meanwhile, in the Muggle world, Draco loses a good luck charm.  And can't help but wonder if Harry has anything to do with it...
"And this is what Draco should have actually taken?"  To Harry it sounded... boring.  No wonder no one else had bought it before.  What on earth was it actually good for?  Anyone could reconsider a situation or a choice if they wanted to.
“Do you even know what they all ARE?”
It was two things, actually.  The first being the 'serial number' that wasn't a serial number at all.  It was a date.  A date from quite a long time ago now, one that he wouldn't ever forget as it was the date of the Battle of Hogwarts.
“Why?  I'm sure Longbottom told you the gritty details already so there isn't anything to talk about.”
After locking the door he crossed to the window to look down at the street.  He watched Harry exit the building and then walk away, not stopping this time to talk to anyone before he reached whatever landmark they'd set out and he apparated away.
Kind of adorable.  Not that Draco was thinking about that.  He was pointedly NOT thinking about that.
"I didn't think there was any way for them to overturn his ruling when I first got the letter.  I thought perhaps it was due course and they were simply making sure they did all of their homework.  That everything with the war was so far done now they were getting to the very last and final dregs that didn't even really matter.  I didn't want to worry you for no reason."
“Quite.  But they did it for centuries.  Then they came up with telephones.  Where you picked up something that you put to your head and could listen at one end and speak into the other.  By pressing numbers on it, the same kind of device would make noise in another Muggle's house and when they picked up their listen part they could speak and hear each other. Not quite as inconvenient. NOW..” Neville said with a smile, wiggling the phone in his hand, “They have these.  They're called mobile phones, or cell phones.  You use this to press numbers on and when the other person hears their phone making noise and answers it, you can talk to each other through this.  Or, if you'd rather, you can type messages and send them instantly to someone.”
But there was a warmth on his back.  A warm spot on his back and warmth around one of his wrists.
The only things he'd done which he thought Harry might take total offence to was upgrade the furniture.  He didn't really change any of it THAT much, it was all the same basic shape... Just a little spruced up and nicer and more comfortable.
"Harry Potter.  Lowering himself to demand entrance to my store..."  Borgin looked caught between extreme amusement and extreme displeasure.
"And I shouldn't be trying to talk you out of meaning it.  We can't stand each other.  We'd happily kill each other."  Harry said, his hand sliding around onto Draco's back, pulling him forward and against him.  "And yet..."
“If you want one now I don't see any reason why you shouldn't have one.”  Neville said with a shrug and a smile.  “They were long term plans because we thought it would take awhile for everyone to adjust enough to be able to learn something more advanced.  But you've already mastered the television, and you know far more basic tasks without magic than most of the others.”
Then Harry took him into a grocery store, talking quietly as he showed him how to take a cart and physically push the stupid thing up and down the aisles, selecting what you wanted and putting them in the cart.  And as if that wasn't enough, when you got to the front of the store, you had to pick up every last item out of your cart again and put it on a moving counter for the shop worker to touch and.. 'scan' Harry had said, before someone else crammed all your food into bags and you handed over money.
"Stop your racket!"  Borgin hissed, poking a finger into his face.  It took only a few moments before recognition crawled across his aged features.  Realizing who it was he was talking to
“Exactly.”
Tom's eyes went redder, but unlike the last dream that had ended with anger when his eyes turned red, this time they seemed to be filled with something close to excitement.
“Lovely to see you as well.”  Harry said with a smirk, stepping into the flat and closing the door when Draco turned to walk back towards the kitchen area.  “Why do you have food all over your counters?”
Then just as suddenly as it started, it stopped.  They broke apart with a gasp, Draco's hands flying to the edges of the window to catch himself so he wouldn't fall when Harry stepped back.
“She'll go crazy in the library.  Probably even
Harry stared at it, slightly open mouthed in surprise for a few moments before he jerked his head up to look at Draco accusingly.  “Hermione gave me this in fifth year.”“I know.”
“Neville doesn't know how to hold a grudge.”  Harry said, looking around the flat a little more closely.  “To him, you're someone who got dragged into the war against your will.  You're a classmate, and therefore someone he wants to help.  You know, on closer look, you really didn't mess too much with the flat...”
Harry is impossible...
"We never stay more than a night or two, but why do you think we need to?"
"Yeah?"  Harry leaned forward, resting his forearms on his knees as he looked at Draco with interest.  "Why do you think that?"
And while he may find success in that, he starts to realize how many layers and threads and bits and pieces are part of this mystery...
He HAD been surprised when Kreacher answered the door.  He was used to him being utterly filthy, stinking and completely unkempt.  But the House Elf that greeted him was clean and his pillowcase immaculately pressed.  Not to mention that he smiled at Draco and at Harry and served them both tea with obvious happiness.  He had to remember to ask Harry what had happened.
“Merlin.  I keep forgetting how much you already know about everything.  You always seem two steps ahead.”
He fumbled around the mixer, turning it off as he felt hot red creep up from under his collar over the back of his neck and into his ears.  "Nerves."  He said, still trying to smile at the judges who were looking at him very oddly.  "So good to see you Paul and Prue."
Harry- Do you even know what WiFi is??
"Harry, I..."
That was annoying.  That was REALLY annoying, actually.  That was more annoying than him being there in the first place.  Refusing to even acknowledge Draco's presence with more than a glance, not saying a word?  How dare he.
"I think the time has passed for worrying about rudeness.  What is it?"
“Neville mentioned that.. you had another panic attack.”  Harry said after several minutes of silence.
Harry took in a sharp breath, once again rifling through the contents of his trunk, scouring around in the depths of it before he came up with the pair of socks he was thinking of.  Then he sat down on his bed, looking at the socks, and grinning.
Harry- Not the first time I've used it.  How are you texting???
"God dammit, Draco.." Harry hissed the words out, already on his feet and moving away from camp, away from the protection of the spells Hermione put up each time they set up.  He followed the fox, heart in his throat as his mind bounced over every possible reason Draco would have to make a move this bold.
“Oh.”  Harry wasn't sure what else to say to that.  His cheeks darkened a bit as he came back to himself and remembered what Draco HAD seen before he shut him out.
But he wondered... Was the Vanishing Cabinet considered a dark object?  Did you have to have dark intent in order to fix it as well?
A joke about Tinder...
Alright so...  We're just going to jump right into the action here, no reason to delay things moving forward.  Let's goooooo!
“They’ll never change.  Not really.” Draco admitted, raking his teeth over his lower lip and looking away from Harry.  “But you still testified for all of us.”
Not too bad...
It was clear that he was staying here.  Harry was right that his mother wouldn't have written to Harry if she didn't honestly feel that was the only answer.  And it kind of was, he knew that, too.  Draco would not consider finding another house and pretending it was his own.  But to just stay with someone else..  That felt more temporary.  That felt like he wasn't abandoning his mother, he had no stake in Harry's house, it was his own.  He was just a guest.  He could do that...
A silky voice spoke from a doorway on the left, making both Draco and Harry jump and turn.  Draco looked confused at who he saw, but Harry smiled, leaning against the post he still had his hand on.
"Well...  I assumed.  Him or Fenrir Greyback."
"What do we do first?"  Draco eventually asked, his voice quiet but steady.  Harry had given him enough time to settle himself again.
“You could have gotten us KILLED.”  The blonde hissed at him, shoving a hand against Harry's chest fairly roughly.  “What is WRONG with you!?”
are your secrets.”  Harry said with a roll of his eyes.  “He seems to think it's incredibly important that I see and learn all of this but is very pointed in telling me that he has no firm proof of anything that he's
"Should get back."  Harry eventually said, leaning over to kiss the side of Draco's head in a show of affection that somehow Draco found even more intimate than being in the Prefect's bathtub together.
Who would have thought...
Draco had him now, his confidence building as he watched the dark haired boy shift in discomfort.  His own chin raised slightly, getting to his feet in the chest deep water, moving slowly closer to Harry.  "You didn't get it quite right."
A few hours later he was getting ready for bed when he heard an owl tapping against the glass of his bedroom.  He let it in and took the letter from it, sitting down on the edge of his bed to read it.
Harry's hand reached forward that small ways between them, his fingers slid against Draco's ribs under the water.  Draco felt his eyes close, a small breath shuddering from his lips as he shook his head.  "I should mean it."
It was like a lightbulb went off over Harry’s head.  Draco’s response which he knew gave away his location but absolutely nothing he was doing in there, shone light directly into Harry’s brain and snapped together so many pieces of the puzzle at once.
He'd never held one of his friends the way he did Draco.  His friends didn't melt into him and cling to him like he was the only thing keeping them afloat.  He never would have considered hugging Ron or Hermione like this.
“I have no way of talking to him.  Unless he has a phone, hm?  No magic allowed, nothing that would draw attention, which would definitely include owls. And- ”  He held up his hand slightly to stop Neville from interrupting him.  “There is no way a letter penned by me, passed to an Auror and then sent to him, would pass his rather strident magical inspection and actually be opened.  I lived with him all through school.  I saw how he handled his mail, the spells he used to check it, how paranoid he and his whole family got when it was made clear everything coming into Hogwarts was being searched and cleared before being handed off to the students.”
"Good for you."  Harry said, folding his hands over his stomach as he listened, his eyes taking in just as much as his ears.  Draco looked well rested...  He was sitting straight, there were no shadows under his eyes and he seemed to be gaining back his ego and his attitude.  All things Harry rather relished seeing and quite a change from the ever thinning and ever exhausted looking boy that he'd become friends with just a few months before.
"She was here.  When I got back from Grimmauld Place.  She never comes unannounced but this time she did.  She snooped around.  She found all the letters I had written to you."
He started to walk out of the room, then paused in the doorway, his hand on the frame, long fingers stroking the polished wood for a few moments before he looked back into the room at Harry.  “You mentioned, through Draco, about the ring...”
“Come.”
“You think?”  Harry said as he followed him inside, both of them walking almost on autopilot to the place where the Vanishing Cabinet was, thumping down onto one of the worn couches with a sigh.  “I honestly believed he was really a Death Eater.”
After about five minutes he stopped, turning to look behind him for Harry but realized he wasn't there, not even at a distance.  He looked around, turning in a slow circle in the dark woods, realizing that he was quite alone.  Harry hadn't followed him, he couldn't even hear him.
------------------------------------------
Draco hissed, gritting his teeth and pulling his head back from the other boy's, his breathing hard as Harry could clearly feel the struggle to relax as he pushed into him.  The tight heat of his body like a vice around him, his hard flesh twitching, almost threatening to end things before they even started from the tight hot squeeze alone.
Draco couldn't help but laugh again, realizing Harry was totally right.  "And to think I was skeptical of it as a business model."
..." Harry said quietly, taking a step closer to Draco.  "You said that to me, if you've forgotten.  When I had you pinned against a tree."
Predictably, Harry has realized Draco somehow got his wand out of his pocket.
Harry stayed quiet, watching Draco carefully.  He didn't want to pry too much, but he wanted to make sure Draco knew he was interested and invested in this.  “How awful?”
He sat on his trunk again, bounced on it until he heard the locks click and then reached for the handle to lug it out of the room.  He looked at Hermione's worried face and smiled at her.  "Don't look so down.  We're going back to school, I thought you'd be pleased."
"Really?"  Harry was looking at him like he wasn't sure he believed him.  "Since when?"
Harry grinned as he spoke, and the wiggle that Draco got in his belly from it was totally different than the one that was about Harry being on their side of the war.
Draco fell silent, thinking hard.  He wanted to deny what Harry said, he wanted to argue with him more.  But unfortunately the other boy was kind of right.   And a teeny tiny little sliver of hope that had started building deep in him grew just a little more.
Merlin.  Gods.  Fuck.  NO.  NO NO NO NO.
"Not about..." Draco took one hand out of his pocket, gesturing between him and Harry.  "This.  I didn't tell him we were talking and meeting.  I mean I told him about what.. He.. wants me to do.  He already knew, he knew even before my mom went to see him.  He says he'll help."
"Pretty much."
“Fine, fine.”  Draco sat up on the couch, and gave his arm a gentle swing upwards to send Mimir into the air.  He watched him settle on the back of a chair before he turned to face Harry.  “You have my undivided attention.”
“It's my memory of the interaction with Slughorn.”  Tom said, smiling at Harry.  “Go.. But hide. Hide
"Tell me again what it is you and Draco have come up with so far?"
Draco did take a step back then, looking at Harry incredulously as he did.  He immediately thought about his interactions thus far with the young Auror, trying to mesh together the idea that he was Neville Longbottom, who in his mind had always remained a doughy push over.
5:04. That was a really early start but there was no way he was going back to sleep.  Not now...
“Unfortunately Hogwarts library didn't have a shelf of very handy books.”  Tom said, shooting an amused and rather friendly look over at Draco.  “I had to pretend to be naive and charming...  Go on, Harry.”
With help from Neville he crossed the short space and sank down onto the cushions with a groan.  He leaned over, his forehead almost touching his knees, his hands knitted over the back of his head as he felt the couch dip next to him.
Harry nodded, but didn't say anything else as he left.  Not even to remind Draco to lock the door behind him (which he got up and did anyways).
"No offence, Draco, but she's scarier than you are."
“Hm?”  Tom looked from Draco to Harry, his eyes narrowing a bit as he saw the murderous look on Harry's face.  “I beg your pardon.”
He said quietly as he slid his thumb along the parchment, then sucked in a sharp breath as a name appeared in the glinting space.
"Did you hear the news?"  Ron asked, thumping himself down into a chair at the table across from Harry.
Some events line up to the Canon book 6, and some don't as we start to deviate down a different path.
Harry gasped within the dream, gasped in real life as he sat upright.  He was immediately and fully awake.
It was, it had to be said, kind of amazing.  Proper, perfect and always impeccably outfitted Draco had a room that looked rather typical for a teenager.
It wasn't very much money for something that was obviously not that interesting.  Even if Borgin was lying through his teeth it wasn't going to be a big set back.
Getting away from Hogwarts after killing Dumbledore seemed like dark intent to him.  And he couldn't help but smile a little bit as his mind wandered, thinking about how that might play out.  Imagining himself and Draco running through the halls of Hogwarts to the Room of Requirement.  Would they be chased?  Would there not be another soul around that would know what had happened except them?
Mixers whirred to life.
“Theodore refused protection.”  Neville said with  a tilt of his head and an uncertain look.  “We keep asking but he won't answer.”
Draco was shaking as he read the last letter from Harry, dropping it once he finished to press both hands to his face.
"What is all this?"  Draco asked, walking towards the table after he got over the shock, his eyes bouncing from paper to paper to Harry and back again.
“What are you doing?”  Harry asked, still wary and not wanting to admit what he had spent his time in the memory thinking about.
"We might need a way to communicate with Draco's mother."  Harry said, continuing to work extremely hard to keep his temper in check.  "We don't know how things are going to play out.  He'll want to be able to talk to her and rather than wait until it's necessary, we're looking at how to do it now."
“Well..”  Neville smiled as he walked towards the door, obviously deciding to make his exit before Draco could change his mind.  Which was smart.  “You managed to talk him into keeping your wand.  I think he'll have to decide what's more important.  Getting someone else into protection who needs it, or sticking to rules that we've made up ourselves.”
There was a noise like a scream, a grating and anguished and furious sort of noise and a rush of wind at the same time.  Harry cried out as his scar seemed to flare from the inside out with fiery pain, pressing both hands to it, sure that his forehead was going to crack, to burst from the pressure and pain that was so intense... He struggled on the couch, trying to get to his feet, trying to search out Draco to try and get him up and out of the room.  They had to get up, they had to get---
Harry trailed off, a very strange look crossing his face as he watched Draco.  Watched him drink from the cup and then set it down again.  “Are you...  drinking...
“You still going to be mates with Malfoy?”  Ron asked with a scrunched nose and pained expression.
for a moment.  Just a moment, but all the same.."
“In case of
Something about the way Harry said that send a little jolt through Draco's veins.  His cheeks coloured a little darker and he shook his head at himself.  "I'm not used to that."
“You shoved me out so hard...”  Draco said, laughing himself as he crossed the short distance to the other boy, absolutely beaming at him.  “I didn't even see it coming.”
Harry just chuckled, turning around to lean his back against the wall so he was facing the other boy.  "So the location was my idea but you wanted to meet tonight.  Something up?"
"You can't choose death."  Harry said to him after class as they sat on a window ledge in the hallway.  Defence Against the Dark Arts had been their last class of the day, but they opted to sit not far from the door on a deep windowsill that was just big enough for the two of them, if they squished just a bit.
He slid onto the floor, first on his knees, then over onto his side, curling in on himself and crushing his eyes closed as tightly as he could as he tried his best to take in small sips of air.
A trip to the library yield far more results, far more quickly than hoped but, like everything in magic, the information is NOT as straightforward to use as he might have hoped.
"I know.  What a pompous git he is."  Draco rolled his eyes, straightening his robes a bit.
Theodore hadn't just decided not to talk to him for seven years.  He had legitimately thought he wasn't around
"You did, WHAT?"
Harry spoke in a deadpan of pretend surprise that made Draco smile even more, his cheeks going red.  But he didn't say anything else, he didn't know what to say.
"What were you thinking?"  Draco frowned as he looked curiously at Harry, then felt his breath catch slightly at the rather dark look in the other boy's already dark eyes.  Something about it made his stomach flip flop in a very squirmy but pleasant way.
Merlin he
He said the words and looked up the short ways to Harry's face, and then a moment later he couldn't see Harry anymore.  His eyes had closed and again they were kissing.
“I heard you’re Hogwart’s newest Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.” Draco spoke while looking away towards the train, raising one hand to wave at his son for a moment before dropping it back down.  “Auror work not suiting you?”
Draco and Harry amuse themselves with Owls while they're apart for the Christmas holidays.  Draco finds out a bit about Santa Claus and doesn't seem keen to know more....  But he also lets Harry know that he's spoken to Voldemort.  Directly.  And that Voldemort said he would be in touch with Harry...
He said that he and his mother had saved him.  He knew what his mother had done, how she had lied to Voldemort once confirming that Draco was still alive.  That with her lie it had given Harry the cover needed for the last leg of what had to be done.  But had he, himself, saved Harry?  He didn't think so.  Harry thought so, but he didn't think he had.
Oh dammit, he was supposed to crack the eggs first.  Only the insides went into cooking.  He peered into the mixing bowl as the beaters whirled, watching the eggs bump around whole within the mixture.
“Perfect.”  Harry happily moved the few steps to catch up with the other boy, falling in beside him.  “I don't think there's anywhere else in Hogwarts I'd feel comfortable discussing all of this.”
He rested both elbows on the book, rubbing his forehead with both hands as he thought, again, about the last days before the Battle.  The last hours.  The last words.
"But now it kind of is."  Harry said firmly, this time raising his head to meet Dumbledore's eyes over the half moon of his spectacles.  "But I don't want to get anyone in trouble, I want to save someone."
"I did."  Snape said, his brow furrowing a bit.
What if Harry changed his allegiance? What if it was brought about accidentally? What if no one, not Harry, not his friends, not Borgin, not Voldemort, had any intention of it happening... But it did.
Draco stayed quiet for a few moments, then let out a long low sigh.  If this was a test from Voldemort, he was absolutely going to fail right this second.  "I don't really know what side I'm on."  Draco said, shifting a little uncomfortably.  Half of him screamed at him to shut up, while the other half was so happy he had said it out loud.
But even though they were alone, they were trying not to look like they were doing anything untoward.
Draco sat at his desk, his elbows on the surface and hands squeezed tight in his hair as he looked down on the latest owl from Harry.
A branch snapped somewhere not far away and fell to the forest floor in a shiver of dried leaves, Draco pushed forward into Harry as the noise grated on his already agitated nerves, one hand curling in the front of his coat. "Slughorn shouldn't even have sent us in here."
"So she came upstairs from the party we were having and I went up awhile later and she was in here.  She kept pointing her wand at it and saying Riddikulus and all that, but it just kept changing into people in her family but showing them dead.  Eventually it turned it me, dead and bloody on the floor.  I was trying to get her to leave but then Lupin and Sirius and Mad Eye came in.  Lupin took care of the Boggart and they just shooed me off.  I never did talk to her about it afterwards."
He didn't say anything else, banging the drawer he was looking into shut a little too hard.  It was only a couple of moments after he spoke before he felt a hand on his back.  Turning he looked to Harry's face in slight question.  "I thought it would be kind of obvious."
"It was really no trouble."  Draco said, taking off the work gloves he had put on (and endured a bit of teasing from Harry over) and brushed his hands off.  "You should have an easier time with the house in general now."
Draco shook his head, keeping his hands behind his back.  “No.  I already told you, I didn't need all this coddling and neighbourhood tours.  I'm an adult, I am reasonably resourceful, I could have figured it out.”
"We couldn't find it in the day light anyways.  If you'd been paying any attention in class you would have realized that it only flowers at night."
"You have to at least PRETEND like everything is normal."  Draco said, then laughed as Harry tilted his head back and lolled listlessly against the couch they were sitting on in the Room of Requirement.  "Drama queen."
“You don’t have proof you aren’t disappearing if it came to that.” Harry growled, shifting  forward a bit more.
"For...  I don't know.  All the people that want you dead?"
.  Because I'm starting to think I should take the information about you being at Death Eater meetings all summer and make it more public.  I'm sure The Order would find it especially interesting."
It had changed things, their rivalry didn't matter.  What mattered was the vice like grip that Voldemort had on both of them at opposing ends of the spectrum.  It made it clear just how much they really did need each other.  But made being together next to impossible.
Longbottom was looking at him.  And he just had boxers on.
"You've proved his assumptions about you wrong twice yesterday, he's shaken on his pedestal."  The woman winked at him then turned back to her bench when her oven beeped.
Draco couldn't help but smile faintly to himself that even amid the blood curdling screams, as though they were torturing the old lady, Harry was making sure that Kreacher was happy.
“I could curse you...”
It seemed that the further into this he went, the more mysteries he was turning up...  And the biggest one, the only one he truly cared about, was still a blank slate.
He didn't want to be a Death Eater.  Once again a tool to be used in the war, just on a different side.
And after Harry had left with his wand that night, the little piece of hope turned to resentment and anger.  He had thought he needed to get his head back on straight.  He redoubled his efforts to be useful on
They stopped outside of Draco's building and Neville took the phone back from him and turned so Draco could see the screen.  He showed him how to unlock it, then took a bunch of little picture boxes off the screen that he called 'apps'.
Harry, feeling annoyed in general, abandoned the quest, not even telling Ron that he was.  He couldn't be bothered, really, and it wasn't like Ron was truly any help anyways.  He'd searched the same furniture and same floor over and over again like he expected something to change.
"What do you mean?"  Harry led the way back up the stairs, pressing his hands into his back and leaning a bit to stretch out his muscles.
“You can get one.”  Neville said, smiling at Draco as he put his own phone away.  “It was actually in the long term plans to get all of you that we've put into protection phones of your own for easy communication.  We've all got them, all the Aurors, I mean.  So if you have one then you can talk to us at any time.  And can silently alert us to problems or ask questions without having any contact...”
That seemed about the only thing the book suggested that Draco felt he could actually do.  And so he did TRY to do that.  Occasionally, as he had in the past weeks since he'd come to live in the Muggle world, everything just overcame him and he gave into the idea of just going to bed and forgetting the world.
“Maybe not directly.” Harry said, shaking his head.  “But I don’t know what he knows about before.  About the war.  About what happened...”
He had an early meeting the next day and a new client to take for lunch and wow with his confidence and ability.  Not to mention a fairly large order from Amazon that would be delivered later in the week.
Just as it had been the first time Tom joined him in a dream, he seemed consciously aware of himself asleep before falling deeper within his mind.
"What else happened in here?"  Tom asked the question with such a bite, his eyes sharp and focused so intensely on Harry it was like he was trying to peer inside of him.
“To try and help you settle in more.  Answer questions you have.  But you're far beyond where any one else is who we've put into hiding.  I spent most of yesterday with someone who could not comprehend using the light switches.”
Why was it that no matter which side he stood on there was someone there that just wanted to use him?
Harry had turned to watch him and Draco met his eyes, absolutely seething.  "WHAT!?"
Draco- What is it then?
Draco raised his head a bit, testing the weight of it and his neck to make sure that it could be supported before he sat up further.  He rested his arms against his knees, bracing them there as he tried to piece everything back together again.
"You did but..  I don't know.  I don't think it was good enough to make me leave."
---------------------------------------------------------
Draco muttered the words which made Harry laugh, looking appreciatively at the other boy and slowing his steps as they got to the end of the hall.  “You've got that right...  Do you want to go to dinner?”
“I can’t say that if your parents ended up there I’d do much about it.  But if you did, I’d fight tooth and nail to get you back out again.”
"Where would you go?"  Draco asked, turning a bit so he was facing Harry.  A mere inch or two separated them.  Aside from Harry tackling him in the bathroom, he'd never been this physically close to him.
“Potter!”
“So...  How
It only took a couple of minutes, he wasn't exactly experienced, and he could tell that there was nothing stopping him, not now.  His hands tightened against Harry's back, then one slid into his hair, fisting in the dark strands as he felt the pull right from the soles of his feet.  The rush of heat that claimed him, his hips pressing forward hard as he cried out, throbbed sticky and hot against his own skin.
Eventually Harry raised his head again and looked at Draco curiously.  "Did you apologize to Astoria for things not working out with you?"
Harry leaned in, closing the gap between them and Draco made a soft noise as their lips pressed together, gently at first, then after a few moments far harder.  And then harder still.  Draco's hands slid into Harry's hair as the taller boy moved between his knees and his surprisingly strong arms slid around his back to keep from knocking him out of the window.  They kissed hard, almost fighting each other as they did it, mouths opening and tongues sliding and curling, teeth nipping and biting as heat ramped between them.
“Draco...  Come on, breathe please...  Please...”
"Because I don't know how close an eye he's keeping on me."
"Fuck OFF, Potter!  You're the one who should have gotten detention, not me."
"Open the door, you absolute prat."
Neville started laughing, but it was clearly just an amused laugh, not a 'you're so stupid' laugh, so Draco smiled along with him.
He started measuring, even though it didn't matter what he did with everything since whatever he did would be corrected as soon as he could get his wand out.  Flour, milk, eggs...
-------------------------------------------
This was something Draco was used to, this was his mother all over, sitting and just waiting as though you had called her in to speak to her and not the other way around.  It was a tactic Draco knew well and not one that was difficult for him to ignore now as it had been used against him so many times.
They knew this might be their last chance.  Their only chance.  The years of mixed feelings, of angry kisses, of needy touches, of playing the back and forth game of trying to keep the upper hand had dissolved the year before.  When the real horror of both their lives was made clear.
He settled in a compartment with Neville and Luna, welcome and easy company to have.  He was actually dozing slightly and comfortably when the compartment door opened and Ron and Hermione stepped in to join them.
Tom cut the question off from Harry's lips, tilting his head in a bit and shoving very strong thoughts towards him.
"I should get home."  Draco eventually said, looking over at Harry and smiling.  "But thank you.  This was actually a lot of fun."
Draco laughed quietly shaking his head slowly side to side.  “I answered your question.”
McGonagall eyed him warily and with a distinct knowing that somewhat irked him.  “Are you going to start accusing Scorpius Malfoy of the same things you used to accuse Draco of?  Is he ‘up to something’, Potter?”
Harry 'took a break'.  To all who paid attention he withdrew from the world a fair bit and all breathed a sigh of relief that he did.
"So you're saying you could win.  So long as you could cheat." Harry tilted his head as he looked at Draco.
want that, you will keep your head down.  And not associate with people that have a spotlight pointed directly at them."
"I can't leave my mother alone with him."  Draco shook his head, not even considering it for a moment, not even letting the idea sink in.  Not even dwelling on the idea of staying here, with Harry, which was an option he had not considered.
Harry's eyebrows raised and Draco smiled at him, honestly kind of enjoying the surprise.  "Strange he'd go that far, isn't it?"
Draco- You gave me a pittance.  I don't have much left.
talk to.
Harry- Maddening. How do you know about internet?
"Oh I hope that rumour starts circulating wildly...  Honestly, I'll flirt my pants off with an old lady.  But I can only be so polite towards actual 'eligible' girls."
Draco couldn't help but be a little self satisfied with that reaction.  He'd hit the right nerve there.  And more than that he'd managed to take Harry down a few pegs in Potions class with this.  Harry had no right to be petted on by Slughorn anyways.
Some people yelled at him.
“Do I get an 'Outstanding' in Muggle Studies then, Professor Longbottom?”  Draco said with a smirk, relishing the way Neville's ears once again turned red, then laughed when the other man didn't even comment but instead turned to go into the store with Draco following him.
“No one thinks you're crazy, mate.”  Ron said, though he did actually think Harry might be a little unstable.  “But you've been through hell in life, yeah?  You deserve a break.”
“Shut it.  It was you, your testimony.  There was no other way we would have been pardoned.  No other way they would have truly believed that we hadn’t been in on the master plan when.. he.. came back.”
"No you can't.  But I dragged her into a marriage and children with me knowing from the start that it wasn't what I wanted."
Maybe it was the situation.  It could just be the incredibly dire situation, the months of absolute torment Draco had been through.  Or maybe Draco himself was just different than Ron and Hermione.  Maybe he was more affectionate...
Draco had been stepping back as the woman's voice rang higher and louder with each statement, turning and fleeing as she continued to screech that he should be dead.
He slid out of the chair and onto the floor, curling in on himself as he willed whatever curse had been put on him to just finish the job.
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
"I'll get an owl as quickly as I can."  Harry said with a nod.  "And I'll find out how to safeguard the letter to your mother."
Annoyed with himself, still annoyed with Harry and annoyed with the world in general, Draco made his way back to his building and pretty much stomped up the stairs.  Once inside and with his shoes off he brought the box containing his laptop over to the coffee table.
He waited a few seconds before padding softly towards the door, just standing there as he tried to decide what to do.
He looked down at his pinky where the thin line of silver was.  It seemed duller somehow, not as silver as before and harder to see than when he put it on.  He could feel it, though, and had found that he enjoyed it's presence.  Even if it didn't do anything.
"See you around, maybe?"  Harry called after him, smiling a bit when Draco's head jerked back to look at him, waving at the blonde before he turned to head through the crowd and up to the Gryffindor dorm.
What would happen when 'The Chosen One" decided he liked the idea of a Wizarding World, if not an entire world, under the power of Voldemort?
side.
Harry was dreaming again.  But.. not...
Ron was relying on the same, which was made clear by the way that he was balanced sitting back on two chair legs, secretively eating chocolate frogs rather than reading.  At least Harry was making an effort to look productive.
It didn't matter.  None of it mattered.
Harry nodded, even as his insides squirmed a bit.  Logically he knew it was exactly as Dumbledore had said, there was no path that didn't have risk.  But part of him had really hoped that Dumbledore would see it as completely perfect and with no chance of failure.  Or that he, himself, would offer a plan that had no risk.  Pipe dreams, he knew, but there had still been that little bit of hope.
Draco shook his head, letting it rest back against the couch.  “So was that it?  He just made you feel bad about yourself and sent you on your way?”
Harry laughed with him, poking the side of his shoulder a few times before he rested back again, knitting his hands over his stomach as he just watched the other boy for a few moments.  “Maybe we should be focusing on your task instead...”
McGonagall looked slightly mollified by what he had to say.  Enough that she stopped gripping the back of the chair like it had wronged her somehow.   “You understand why I had to ask you.” She said, looking at him pointedly.
Draco laughed, stretching his legs out and sighing a soft breath in satisfaction before he continued.  "He said I could see him after the meeting.  After everyone left and he sealed the room so no one could listen in he asked me what was so important.  So I said the message came from someone who wanted to help him.  Someone who had been shown the Gaunt house, the ring with with black stone and the Peverell coat of arms.  Someone who knew the box in the wardrobe had a silver thimble, a harmonica and a red yo-yo in it."  He paused, shaking his head a bit as he smiled over at Harry.  "I wish I could properly describe the look on his face, it was amazing.  His eyes absolutely BLAZED.  He closed the distance between us while I was talking, I've never been that close to him.  He stayed quiet for a few seconds before he asked me who was sending the message.  I said Harry Potter."
Harry moved and sat down at the other end of the couch, offering Draco an apologetic smile that was quite real and did soften Draco considerably.
"Which news?  There's always news."  Harry smiled at Ron, then up at Hermione as she leaned over his shoulder to set a plate and cutlery in front of him.
Under the small line of script was a space that glinted faintly in the light and Draco pressed the pad of his right thumb against the left side of it.
Ron frowned, turning back towards the couch as Harry's nasty tone sort of put him off wanting to help at all.
He wasn't sure what to think.  At all.  His emotions and his thoughts all rammed into each other at once over and over again, pulling him in fifty different directions at the same time.
Then he was walking backwards, Harry was pushing him and forced a low noise out of his throat has he felt his back collide with a wide tree trunk.  Harry pressed against him properly, the dark haired boy's hands sliding down his sides, pulling his hips forward.
Harry furrowed his brow as he looked at Draco and shook his head.  "I don't think it's cowardly...  You must have known exactly what it would turn into.  Most people do, you shouldn't feel like a coward for not facing off against it."

"I didn't, I just followed my Patronus.  I didn't even know I could do that while apparating, but..." He trailed off, raising one shoulder in a half shrug.
Returning to the front door again, he once again tapped the spot twice, then said the second incantation.
"Nothing.  I just don't feel like I should be the one to leave." He tried to affect his self satisfied drawl rather than the defensive reflex he was really feeling in the words.

"I don't either."  Harry said, sitting back in the chair.  "But I'm guessing she has to do with why you haven't been writing to me."
"I did tell them that."  Narcissa said quietly.  "I told them exactly what I thought.  I told them exactly what I knew.  They told
Harry- Like it or not, Draco, I'm head of the Auror department and you will be seeing a lot of me.
"What?"  Harry gave his head a slight shake as he drew out of the deep thoughts and refocused on what was actually going on.
“I like television.”  Tom said, shrugging one shoulder and then tipping his head to gesture towards the living room where Harry could still hear the noise from the TV.  “I almost never get to watch it.”

Please.
"Erm...  Yes."  Harry said, looking down at his hands in his lap.  "She made very polite small talk for a few moments.  Which she's never done before.  Normally she looks through me if I'm not there, I see her out fairly frequently."
"Impressive academic career."  Draco said, crossing his legs and settling into his chair more comfortably.  "And you fancied becoming an Auror with a record like that."
"Sir...  This might be really rude to ask but..."
He stayed completely motionless for a moment, then got up to pick up the envelope, opening it where he stood and taking out the single sheet of parchment.
Had opened more than a few and read them.
And smiled smugly when he heard Harry laugh as well.  Unfortunately as they were in class with Snape, that laugh cost Gryffindor 5 points.  He hoped Harry thought it was worth it.
For the first time in more years than he truly cared to think about, he felt...  Reasonably content.
The shock on McGonagall's face when they turned up together to talk to her seriously would have been worth anything.  But the stony disbelief and uncomfortable behaviour of Snape was the icing on the cake.
“In third year Fred and George Weasley gave me a magical map of Hogwarts.  It shows the castle and the grounds and every person in it has a tiny labelled dot that moves as they move.  So just by looking at it I could find anyone and know where they are.”
But she had also made it clear that no matter what, he had to continue to appear dedicated to Astoria.  And not be seen with Harry...
Harry's brows raised further and further as Draco spoke, tilting his head a little as he got to the end.  “You split your
