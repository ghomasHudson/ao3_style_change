“Merlin, I was joking myself,” Draco says in bewilderment. “For heaven’s sake, Potter, lighten up. Fuck, trust you to sour a light situation,” he adds bitterly, glaring daggers.
Shrugging, Potter dips his head and looks at Draco over the rim of his glasses, lashes fluttering. “My parents,” he murmurs. “Sirius, Remus... Ron and ‘Mione.” Then he meets Draco’s gaze squarely. “Anyone or anything that makes me feel safe.”
A warm hand grasps his elbow and helps him up, his purchases swirling up from the ground at the wave of a wand – a familiar length of hawthorn – and Harry’s head instantly starts to spin from blood loss.
There are rooms along the way but they’re all shut, heavy oak doors with intricately carved details. Draco imagines they’re parlours, and sitting rooms, maybe a dining room for entertaining, but the elf leads him all the way to the end of the hallway, where one set of stairs leads up further into the house, and another set of steps — slabs of grey stone — leads downstairs into what has to be a basement kitchen, judging from the scent of coffee, eggs and slightly burnt toast wafting up. The elf points him downstairs.
She’s looking right at me as she talks, hands cupped around her mug, stray curls escaping her bun and bouncing against her forehead. I don’t reply but I do rip open a packet of chocolate biscuits and dunk one in my tea.
I nod. But she probably senses that there’s something I’m not saying out loud because she raises her eyebrows expectantly. I sigh. “He’s been with more men than I have,” I finally say it out loud, “and he’s always raved about how good they were in bed. And I have no idea how to live up to any of that.”
He makes a sound of some sort, a short whimper; then Draco flings his arms around my neck and surges into me, kissing me back like he’s determined to win this fight too. Because it feels like a fight; it feels like we’re competing again. I don’t think. I just kiss. I taste his mouth and the booze on his tongue; I feel the softness of his cheek under my hand. When he pulls me closer, I plaster myself against him, pushing him bodily into the wall, and cup the back of his neck, my thumb landing right over the pulse point on his neck; his heart is racing like a bird’s.
“No,” Draco admits shakily, knowing full well what’s to follow. And sure enough, Potter’s mouth descends right back down, lips smacking around the vivid pink, pebbled skin, pulling at it on a leisurely suck, finding Draco’s wrists as he scrabbles wildly and holding them pinned to the pillows.
“Never—never claimed otherwise,” Potter says breathlessly, lifting his bum obligingly when Draco drags his pants down and throws them back over his shoulder. “Fuck, should you be sitting on the floor like that? Do you want a...cushion?” he trails off at the cool, half-lidded glare Draco shoots him.
Harry was in the bedroom, folding and sorting laundry, and Draco’s mind started to wander from the Liver Strengthening potion recipe to form a mental list of all the things he’d need to buy the next day at the supermarket. Letting the book fall closed in his lap, Draco sighed and rubbed at one eye with his forefinger, the room swimming before him just as something blue flashed across his vision.
Despite how forthright and honest a person Potter is, Draco doesn’t quite have the guts to broach the subject because he’s too busy enjoying the blissful little bubble that they’re both living in and he doesn’t yet want to risk popping it.
The way he said it sounded like a dismissal. But Harry didn’t move. He stood and stared at the sword.
Well, I should probably tell him how I feel before I kiss him but I’m going to kiss him one way or another.
He can’t be sure if his feet are still on the floor; he’s pretty certain he’s flying, or simply floating around like a cloud. Potter’s mouth tastes of the coffee they’d had earlier, and his body is hard and chiselled and hot under Draco’s feverishly caressing hands. He strokes over Potter’s shoulders, his back, down his flanks and up over his chest, their mouths never parting, their tongues sliding languidly against one another, mouths smacking wetly together.
“So sit the fuck down, shut the fuck up and eat your fucking breakfast, you fucking pain in the arse,” Potter says, bringing both the plates over to the table and kicking out a chair for Draco.
Because every cell in his body assured him, his foggy brain, that Malfoy had saved his little girl and brought them all away safely.
Draco scowls a little and Potter laughs again. “I’ll...get going, I suppose,” he says, because they’re both just
a—” Draco starts and then abruptly turns away with his middle finger held up. “Later, peasants!” he swaggers away and I frown after him until he’s swallowed by the crowd.

“And got fucking burnt in the process,” Draco says morosely, shifting the singed collar of his robes aside to show me a patch of bandage below his shoulder. “I hate cafeteria food,” he adds with a scowl, taking another bite and dropping into Ron’s chair.
His gaze tilts up when there’s a creamy flash at the window behind the folds of the thick curtains. The moon floats lazily, blurred behind the sheet of rain but full and round in its brilliant whiteness, mocking Harry with its deceptively serene presence in the agitated firmament. For once, for the first time in
“Harry, Malfoy’s blood sugar and pressure levels are going to vary over the next few months,” Granger interrupts calmly, shutting the file and picking up her wand. “Don’t you think I’d have told you if it was something to be worried about?
This time Harry left. He went back to his side of the clearing and cleared up the breakfast things. Scorpius and Albus were digging a hole with sticks, and from what Harry could make out of their conversation, they were looking for snake eggs. James was holding Lily’s hand as she pawed and plucked through the little yellow wild flowers growing around the edge of the trees. As Harry started putting together fresh sets of clothes from the jumbled mess inside the kids’ trunk, James left Lily to watch Albus and Scorpius dig, and walked over to Harry.
Harry ignored his grumbling, pushing his tongue back inside him along with the two fingers in a slick, wildly arousing tangle. The fingers went straight for his prostate, no dilly dallying, and waged a direct assault on it, massaging and squeezing until Draco was sure he was going to pass the fuck out. He was moaning hoarsely now, his eyes rolling back into his head, and simply focused on staying upright and leaving some of Harry’s hair attached to his scalp.
As though emboldened further just by that gasp, Potter drives his tongue deeper into Draco’s mouth, his hands squeezing Draco’s arse cheeks, massaging them apart in maddening circles through his trousers. Potter’s mouth tastes citrusy and strangely smoky and Draco isn’t even able to enjoy it as much as he’d like to because Potter is now brazenly jiggling handfuls of his bum, kissing Draco hard enough to send his head cracking back against the door and make his balls pull up painfully tight against his body.
rather irritated, when Granger does actually come in, shutting the door behind herself and following him into his lab.
Harry yelped and hastily stuffed his prick back in, wincing as the zipper caught. Malfoy was on the other side of the water, leaning his shoulder on a tree, expression bland.
Tristan holds out his hand. “Tristan Legrand,” he says with an idiotic little bow. “I know who you are, of course,” he adds before Hermione can introduce herself. “I’m a fan,” he says with a wink.
“Right,” Harry says lamely. “Okay, I guess... Oh! I’ll come drop you off now, I’m on my way to the Ministry anyw—”
“Yes, they are, I’m always wondering how to impre—” Potter breaks off abruptly, picking up the discarded menu and holding it up in front of his face.
“Who’s the guy?” Malfoy’s tone was so familiar that Harry could almost picture him – one eyebrow raised, eyes slightly narrowed in suspicious appraisal.
“Well, I’m going to try,” he says firmly. Then he sighs through his nose, gaze flicking away for a moment. “You shouldn’t have done what you did, Draco. I still can’t believe you put yourself at risk like that.”
Potter’s mouth snaps shut and he looks even more confused as he makes a vague, noncommittal sound, shrugging lightly. “I...guess?”
Leaning down, Draco kisses him, sucking his tongue and biting his mouth until it’s red and smarting. Then he moves over to whisper into his ear, “You want to taste me, don’t you?”
The words are right there, on the very tip of his tongue, but that snide voice inside his head that was strongest during the full moon is suddenly piping up, derisively informing him that it would be the biggest mistake of his life to bare himself to Malfoy now, at a point when he’s most likely to rip Harry’s heart apart and gleefully hand its corpse back to him, and it’s only too easy for Harry to succumb to that niggle of fear and doubt.
The headboard is slippery beneath Draco’s sweaty hand as he clenches at it, tightening his fist around their cocks and whimpering against one bronze, saliva-shiny nipple. Potter undulates against him like they’ve done this a thousand times, like they’d not spent their teens despising the very sight of one another, like he’d not almost killed Draco in a girls’ bathroom, and like Draco had never looked into his puffy, misshapen face and claimed he didn’t know who he was.
Harry lay in bed, his hands under his head, Baguette pressed into his hip, warm and furry. He’d been lying there for over an hour, wide awake. He was tired – his body ached with fatigue – but he couldn’t fall asleep. He also couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy.
“Do you know how long I’ve been calling you?!” Draco sounds nasal and stuffy again as he sniffles softly.
“Glorious,” Draco replies, conjuring three dessert plates and forks before prising open the lid of the box. There’s a large circular cake of some sort, deep gold and heaped with what looks like slivered pistachios.
“Because Harry requested me to help him out,” she answers calmly, not ruffled in the least. “I’ve been reading up, and I’m fairly confident of my abilities to help. Healer Abigail Penman, one of our senior most Healers, will be more than willing to help, too.” When Malfoy just continues half-glaring at her, she adds, a tad uncertainly, “If Harry and you prefer to consult with anoth--”
“Of course,” Malfoy says, eyes gleaming with something that has Harry breaking out into gooseflesh. “Why else.”
When they came back, Malfoy had a little fire going and was digging around in a trunk of his own. James and Albus stood and stared at the bluish-green fire. Harry expanded and looked through all three trunks to determine what they had, every sensible item he found making his stomach clench with grief and longing.
“First of all, no you’re not,” Potter says quietly, watching as Draco peels off the fancy golden paper with trembling fingers. “Secondly, it’s not even something new, so just shut it.”
“Well, aren’t you all the ugliest house elves I’ve ever seen,” Draco waltzes in, clad in ripped blue jeans and a deep green t-shirt with a silhouette of a dragon on it – the black outline moves as he walks, the dragon flapping its wings and then settling down, curling around itself. The stupid tosser is wearing his black leather jacket again – the one I’d gifted him for his birthday last year – despite it just being a casual lunch at The Burrow.
?!” he screamed into Harry’s face, when Harry just sat there on his haunches and blinked at him. “What the
I snort and then burst out laughing, chortling helplessly. “I want him so much it’s a bit disturbing, actually.”
Malfoy didn’t take up the challenge Harry threw at him, strapping on his sword in silence instead with his eyes on Harry the whole time. “All right,” he said at last.
“Potter, you bastard—” Malfoy’s long back dips inwards, a keening gasp sounding from where his head hangs between his shoulders when Harry pries his arse open and lays a firm lick up the crease with the flat of his tongue. “
The moment he opens the double doors and leads Malfoy into his appointed room, he turns around to see Malfoy’s reaction, pleased at the way Malfoy’s eyes go huge and his pink lips part, the wonder on his face making Harry’s stomach flutter happily.
I simply smile. It is immensely satisfying to realise that he genuinely believes that Draco and I are together now; that Draco left him for me. Almost, I want to say.
Harry doesn’t want to admit that it’s because year after year there are always more kids, more engaged, if not married couples, more demands for promises that the
He kissed him hard and deep and vigorously, all at once, and Malfoy gasped into it as he immediately struggled to return it, pressing bound hands into his back.
“Malfoy,” Harry says, carefully lifting both hands in front of him, “Calm down. Put your wand away. I just want to talk for a bit. I’m sorry, alright? I’m sorry I tracked my owl. But I was worried and needed to check that you were doing alright. Just...put your wand away.” Harry waits, watching the way Malfoy’s lower lip wobbles, Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallows loudly. “Lower your wand, Draco,” Harry tries again calmly, “before you accidentally take one of my balls or something.”
For Draco, the previous night was just a way to confirm what he’d known for a few days now. And then yesterday, even while in his basest form, Harry hadn’t managed to push him away, or make Draco’s dangerously out-of-control feelings for him go away. He tries to recall, to find a single moment from the previous night when he’d been disgusted,
Potter laughs again, coming back up to kiss him, slow and deep and lasting long enough that Draco is breathless and almost blind with arousal by the time he pulls away. It’s only when he hears the click of a tube that Draco looks around, vision blurred, to see Potter squeezing lube onto his fingers.
“Yeah, me too,” Potter replies clearly, expression and tone clear of any resentment or dishonesty. “I’m glad we’re friends now.”
It’s not as if I’ve not seen him at all, though. Because that would have made getting over him easy. When have I ever been that lucky?
Draco attacked his throat at once, leaving his own set of marks on the sun-bronzed skin, smiling against the jutting collarbones as Harry let out gritted grunts of pleasure into his mussed blond hair, jerking as Draco cupped his balls, rolling them in his hand before giving them a little squeeze--
“You remind me of Hagrid’s slobbering beast of a dog,” Draco laughed, attempting to bat him away before cupping his cheeks and kissing him back instead. Playing along, Harry painted a firm lick up his cheek and Draco yelped, still laughing as he planted both his hands on Harry’s face and forced it away. “Ugh, you’re fucking gr--”
Neither of them talks for a while, Potter seemingly as shocked by his temerity as Draco is. Draco eats a helping of the grilled vegetables and a slice of toast before pushing his plate away and pulling his tea towards himself again. Potter eats steadily until he’s eaten a bit of everything before reaching for the dreaded vial of vivid blue potion next to his plate.
“Don’t see why you’ve got your knickers in a twist, though,” Harry says coolly, flicking ash off with his thumb.
“You could, next time, if you like,” Hermione smiles, “Take care of yourself, Malfoy. Please don’t hesitate to reach out at any given time.”
“What if I don’t have enough magic left in me to produce a Patronus? It’s the same one way or another, Potter.”
“What are you even doing up here, hm?” Draco asks Scorpius as he retrieves his coffee and makes his way over, gaze briefly dropping to the picture of an obscenely decadent-looking chocolate fudge cake in Harry’s glossy-paged cookbook. “What, just because it’s your birthday, you get to climb up onto counters like a little monkey?” He bends in and blows a wet raspberry against Scorpius’ neck and Scorpius screeches. Lyra immediately screeches back and sticks a drool-wet hand onto Scorpius’ cheek, much to his horror.
Ron is silent for a long beat during which I watch Simon lean idly over the bar, grinning at something the bartender is saying. Then, “So... You
I scowl as I watch Tristan grin down at him and then turn to indicate something to the barman, who in turn passes him two pints of beer, one of which Tristan hands to Draco – but Draco
Draco is in absolutely no mood to entertain sub-department fraternising. The serene calmness with which he’d started off his day and left Grimmauld Place had worn out around midday, leaving in its wake an incessant, anxious gnawing in his stomach that’s yet to go away. He’s spent the day thinking about (worrying about) Harry, what he might say about what Draco did, and what that whole talk might lead to. He’s restless and uncertain and above all, misses Harry terribly.
Would you even know how to? ‘cause I’m not going to lie, love, I wouldn’t mind it in the least - I’ve sneaked a look at the package and Granger is one lucky bint—”
, Draco’s mouth floods with saliva as he stares at it, eyes wide and lips parted. His balls hang heavily underneath, swinging lightly with Potter’s movements. The hairs on Potter’s thighs are fine and dark, and Draco wants to flatten them onto the golden skin with his tongue.
He just shrugs and looks away, Malfoy, muttering under his breath, and Harry catches a vague, “—even have a
Potter blinks, lips turning inwards as he fights a smile and then just bursts into a chuckle anyway. “Are you really asking me that?” he chuckles, “Because I wasn’t joking earlier, Draco. You don’t—you’re barely even real to me, even when I’m holding you; I—I
We’re sitting very close now. I can smell him, his scent; it’s always enough to make me perk up. He’s so utterly beautiful; it’s always been distracting. But now I don’t have to focus on anything else. I can reach out and touch his face – so I do; I brush his hair back and run my thumb up one high cheekbone, trace the curve of his plump lower lip.
baby,” he adds, jumping to his feet and pushing both hands in his hair, panic rising at an alarming rate. “How is this even-- I’ve been fucking blokes for seven—he’s a
They collapse abruptly into a pile of wool and fervent kisses, Draco’s still gloved hands cradling Harry’s cheeks, Harry’s hands drawing tantalising patterns across the scars slashing across Draco’s heaving chest. Their mouths move together in a slick, easy dance of blissful familiarity, until Draco pulls away, gasping for breath through his mouth, his blocked nose emitting high, wheezing sounds as he pushes Harry’s face away.
Malfoy didn’t look up, not even as Harry spread out his own homework and proceeded to quietly get down to work. Not even an hour later when they still sat there, studying quietly together.
specimen of a cock as it stands there, dripping onto Potter’s abs. Draco can’t claim to have seen a large number or a wide variety of cocks but this, Potter’s, is not just the biggest he’d seen but is quite definitely the most beautiful.
“Yeah, I mean--” Potter swallows hard, one hand jumping up to his hair; he has a shiny spot of grease on his forearm as well. “I could, you know—Kreacher could...make us dinner. I mean, he’ll make
Gasping and twitching with every stroke, Draco let his eyes fall shut, his cock grazing the cool countertop each time he was thrown forward on a particularly savage thrust. Harry was grunting softly as he fucked him, his hand tangled firmly in Draco’s hair, his fingers bruising Draco’s hip. There was no restraint in the way he just
“Whatever do you mean, Potter?” Malfoy isn’t looking at him, lounging complacently, eyes half-lidded as he watches the dancers.
“I bet you can’t get three in a row,” the random bloke from three tables over who’d challenged Draco in the first place pipes up. Draco rolls his eyes.
“I bet it gets lonely, though.” It’s the most covert way Draco can bring himself to sniff around for signs of someone else in Harry’s life.
Shooting him a glare, Harry shakes his head again. “Not disfigured, no,” he chuckles weakly. When Malfoy simply continues to stare expectantly at him, Harry wheezes, “I’m fine, really.”
Harry’s shepherd’s pie: Harry liked to add a heap of grated cheddar to the potatoes and it crusted beautifully. Draco always ended up eating about three helpings more than he was actually capable of eating.
Harry leaned back onto his hands and stretched his legs out alongside Draco with a broken groan of pain. Ignoring his near complete nudity for a few more seconds, Draco reached out and gave one of Harry’s ankles an empathetic squeeze. Harry sighed, smiling lazily as Draco got stiffly to his feet and pulled his clothes back into place, muttering under his breath as he Summoned first his tie, and then the buttons he’d once again lost, applying a Sticking Charm to fix them back onto his shirt – these charms never lasted long; he’d have to make another trip to the kitchens. Or maybe he’d just teach himself to sew. He might as well; it’s not as if Harry would ever
“What do you mean?” Draco blurts defensively. “I—We spend—Our lives are independent of each other, Granger!” he says quickly.
Harry, spitting out grass, tries to frown at her through his laughter. “Shut up, he’s not like that,” he says jumping to his feet and shaking more grass out of his hair. “Don’t make me regret telling you about him.”
Draco spluttered quite vigorously and was certain that he’d unintentionally spat on Harry. “What? Why?!”
Harry doesn’t read the letter. He doesn’t even open it. He flicks a finger at it, and sends the envelope straight into the fire, not glancing up at Draco to see his reaction.
off?” Ron scowls at once. All of us just look at him impassively until his scowl deepens and he holds up both middle fingers. “She pisses me off plenty, just so you know.”
Granger had only just asked them, with a mysterious little smirk, whether they’d like to know the gender of the baby when her stupendously oafish husband had barged into the office, freezing at the sight of Draco with his belly out, and had almost fallen backwards out the door when Draco had begun bellowing expletives at him, Potter hurrying out after him with an apologetic grimace.
Draco starts in place, blinking around at Potter who’s watching him with a gentle little smile. “Even though this
He doesn’t complain like I’d expected him to. He stares at me, out of breath and clearly a bit unsure of what’s to follow, like he can’t quite put his finger on what I might do next. I pointedly undo his jeans and slide them off his legs; his endless, shapely legs covered in a fine, barely visible layer of golden hair. He points his toes like a ballet dancer as I peel the skin tight denim off. When I follow it up with a kiss to the arch of his foot, he jerks in clear surprise.
him, lifting and hauling him as he pleased, growling filth into his ear – Draco realised through the red haze that clouded his vision that he’d long since lost his mind.
Zabini has vanished into the crowd as I’m served my beer. I sip slowly and engage in small talk with Parkinson, Draco watching and listening to us; I can feel his gaze on me, I can feel his bewilderment as to why I’m not conversing with him after not having seen him for so long. I can smell his cologne. I want to touch him again. I want to feel the press of his warm body against mine. I want to tell him everything I’m feeling, want to pour it all out and watch him try to deal with it and fail, just like I’m failing. I want and want and want.
rather not, thanks,” I’ve shot back before I can reign myself in to answer more diplomatically. Draco now looks astonished
He grins at me, his hair styled in that soft tousle he wears it in outside work, and bobs his head in a nod but all I’m aware of is that his fucking
Potter doesn’t seem to be able to help the slightly lascivious leer he throws Draco’s way and horrifyingly enough, Draco isn’t even a little bothered by it – flustered and a tiny bit aroused, perhaps, but
“Fuck you,” he says, walking away and then pausing, turning back around with a small frown. “How do you know their shit’s blue?” he asks curiously.
Lucius snorts and holds out his hand for an excitedly wiggling Scorpius to take, leading him over to the Floo. Narcissa bends to press a kiss to Draco’s temple before darting another
Now Potter’s eyes are heated, his expression intense, and Draco stares back helplessly. “Happy birthday, Potter,” he says softly, squeezing Potter’s back with both hands.
“You think Malfoy’s actually serious about this one?” Ron asks me directly and I shrug carelessly at once, wishing he’d just
“Thus adding the dreaded, pungent aftertaste that Wolfsbane is known to possess,” Draco finishes, surprised and more than a little impressed. Not even some seasoned brewers know this little hack.
“I’d like to remind you at this point,” Zabini wanders back over. “That none of us have actually met this person – I’m still inclined to believe you’ve made the berk up.”
When he pulls away, he wastes no time in throwing Lucius the biggest, most smug grin he can muster, pointedly kissing Malfoy’s hand while doing so. Narcissa is smiling wryly, shaking her head as she wipes a fresh tear. Malfoy is red in the face, biting his lip over an enormous smile, and looks like he wants to murder Harry before snogging him some more.
“The fuck is so funny?” he snipes grumpily, thumping his tea onto the desk. “Malfoy,” Harry leans forward, blurting out without thought, “move in with me.”
The evening of Potter’s birthday finds them both in the pleasantly cool living room on the second floor, surrounded by baby books, most of them, shockingly enough, Potter’s. Draco had found stacks of them on Potter’s bedside tables, volume after volume of rare, wizard-pregnancy books and several more books about Veela and Veela mating.
Potter still appears confused as he frowns a bit. “What do you mean, Malfoy?” he replies, a tad defensively. “We talk now!”
“This is...” she breathes, holding her hair back and bending a little lower, her dark eyes reflecting the shine of what’s in the bowl. “How did you...?”
“How long is this likely to last?” Malfoy asks, his voice rather thin, his arse going vice-tight around Harry.
“Good. So, I don’t have to stop staring?” Potter is now close enough that Draco can see flecks of gold in the vibrant green of his irises.
Malfoy winced again as he picked up the third book where it’s lying spine-up a few feet away. “I don’t need your help. Leave.” With a vague gesture towards his bag, he reached for the books clutched in Harry’s arms.
With a nipping suck, Harry switches to the other nipple, gently grazing his teeth around it and teasing the peaked tip with his tongue. “Want to—want to...” he trails off, now licking a long stripe up Draco’s sternum, right up his neck, past his chin until he can sink his tongue into Draco’s mouth.
“Harry, you f—” Draco tried to speak—tried really hard—but failed miserably, his voice dying in his throat as Harry released his arm and peeled him open with one hand, wrapping the other arm under Draco’s abdomen and jerking his hips upwards and forcing Draco onto tiptoes.
not looking irritated or disinclined to answer. “After the Third Task. The Triwizard Tournament,” he adds when Draco just gapes.
“Lyda!” he huffs, pushing her hand off and wiping his cheek on his sleeve. “No,” he says firmly, holding up an imperious finger. “Is my buh-day, Papa,” he adds to Draco with another snooty huff, and Draco doesn’t know whether he’s tickled or horrified by how much of himself he sees in that small, haughty little pout.
you. It—it really does mean a lot, Malfoy.” Harry stares rather desperately into Malfoy’s lovely face, grey eyes soft and, for once, unshuttered, rosy mouth curved in a gentle, friendly smile. It’s only when he slowly closes a hand over Harry’s that Harry realises he’s touching Malfoy’s belly again.
“Childbirth, most likely,” Hermione answers quietly and Harry whips around to stare at her in mute horror. “Wizard-pregnancy related Healing wasn’t very advanced back then, Harry, we’re talking, two...three centuries, ago?” she adds, tilting her head at Ron.
“Yeah, look, that’s why I’m here,” I toe off my boots and crawl onto his bed, beer in hand, leaning back against the headboard and stretching my legs out. “Ron’s developed this heart thing caused by shock from your little announcement over lunch today.”
“Well, yes,” Harry turns to her impatiently, “but you said the paternity test is just a matter of an additional spell, right? And can you please, for the love of fuck, stop calling it ‘foetus’? It’s a
The door flies open almost the second he sets the knocker down, and Draco is met with the sight of the same old house-elf, looking up at Draco with a slightly smug, satisfied expression.
, Draco wants to say. Instead he just regards Potter in fixed silence, finally just shrugging nonchalantly. “There’s nothing to gain from telling them and they have nothing to lose from not knowing,” he says crisply. “And I can do with a while more before I’ve to deal with Weasley’s taunting and Granger’s smugness.”
Draco stood under the archway of the kitchen entrance, arms akimbo and his face pink with anger. “Look at this,” he hissed, pointing at something in the direction of the table inside the kitchen.
“Oh.” She looks at me, eyes very wide. “So you...don’t know that he...?” When she trails off and waits I just shake my head. She looks dreadfully ashamed. “Simon’s had...a sort of accident,” she says. “He... He had—He was with some bloke last night.” She says it bluntly. “He’s managed to tell the Healers what happened – I guess he wrote it down for them. His mouth and—and—” She turns red and clears her throat. “And his...bum—they’re...well—They’re infected with something. They don’t know what yet.” She sighs, looking worryingly close to tears of embarrassment while I digest the information. “One Healer mentioned it might be a dark curse of some sort. I suppose that’s what one gets for spending the night with some charva you meet at a—”
“She won’t get dressed,” Harry says, his voice muffled against the pillows. “She’s refusing to get dressed. I can’t do it, I just can’t.”
Potter is the one who’s half naked under Draco’s questing hands but it is still Draco who’s almost choking with the need to feel more of Potter against him, to feel the press of his body atop him, to taste some more of him. Boldly, he reaches down and strokes the flat of his palm over the ridge of Potter’s cock, the fleece of his joggers soft and worn beneath his hand. Potter
and my own fears instead of just showing him how much I love him and not giving a fuck about anything or anyone else.
Stumbling only slightly, Potter catches himself and whips around, lip curling in irritation as he shoves his glasses higher up his sweaty nose and glares at Draco through the fashionable, square frames, green,
“No,” he sighs, settling back down. “’s not a crime. And Ron and ‘Mione aren’t the way you think they are. They’re happy for us.”
Lunch is a delicious, slightly noisy affair that lasts nearly a whole two hours and by the time Mrs. Weasley has charmed everybody’s dessert plates to float serenely away into the sink inside, most of us are slumped in our seats, holding our straining stomachs.
Malfoy was now cleaning the floor at random, stealing glances at Harry. Outside, rain had begun to come down in sheets. The boys stood at one of the windows and peered over the sill, pushing their hands out through the Impervius that Malfoy had set up, laughing when their hands got drenched outside the window but emerged dry when they pulled back in.
His breath leaves him on a long whooshing sound and one long, white hand flies down to wrap tightly around the base of his prick. I sit back on my heels and watch him, his bare chest rising and falling, his ribs visible where the skin stretches tight over them.
I snort at the drawled comment and swivel my head around to face him from where I stand leaning back against the wall. He’s holding a grease-soaked bag of chips, presumably purchased from the chip vendor who’d been parked right outside the club, in one hand, and one fat, half-bitten chip in the other, and is watching me impassively as he chews.
“I really have to move,” Potter chokes out just then, after trembling over Draco in unmoving silence for a full minute and a half.
“Nothing!” Harry laughed softly. And then quite out of nowhere, “I wanted to kiss you back there in front of everybody like I’ve wanted nothing else.”
Suddenly he can see Malfoy smirking at him under those strobe lights in the club, can hear Malfoy’s helpless, breathy moans, the way he had sucked over Malfoy’s pulse point, unable to get enough of his scent. It’s a scent he has imprinted to memory, and as he stands there, Harry wants nothing more than to bury his face against that slender neck again and scent him; inhale him until he can smell nobody and nothing else.
“Are you even really working on that essay?” Hermione’s voice made him jump a little and Harry looked around guiltily at his parchment; he’d written the date, the title (Zark’s Theory of Cross-Species Transfiguration) and had three lines of introduction which he’d basically just copied down verbatim from the textbook.
going to be the one to ask the question that’s looming between them like a fucking shiny-arsed unicorn.
Hermione just sighs, shaking her head irritably before opening two different files. “Malfoy,” she starts carefully, “were you going to tell me about...a certain suppressant you’re on?”
There’s a sudden flurry of activity at the streetlamp-lit end of the alley where a small group of people exit the club, laughing and jostling one another, merrily drunk, as they stumble and sway over to the greasy spoon for bacon butties and chips. They hear the bell above the door chime as they enter the diner, the carols suddenly sounding louder, before the door shuts and there are just vague drifts of it over the sounds of their breathing again.
“Because...we’re not ever likely to share something meaningful?” Malfoy’s tone is like that of a question, but he says it flatly, following it up with a derisive huff. “Right,” he says again, “So, since you don’t like to dance or whatever, you won’t mind if I do? Only, I’m two drinks down and I don’t want to waste this brilliant buzz I’ve got going on.” Without waiting for Harry to answer, Malfoy pushes off the bar, not looking behind as he disappears into the crowd.
“When did you get back?” he asks as Harry crawls on and throws himself next to him, immediately placing a hand over his tummy.
Malfoy clears his throat softly and Harry hastily looks away, glancing up at Malfoy spooning sugar into two mugs, before turning away and walking up to the armchair, and the trunk piled with books. “There’s some tea here too,” Harry reminds him lamely.
you were following me all these days!” he snarled, tears of humiliation and pain streaking down the crimson that had spread across his cheeks. His hands were shaking as he reached up to gingerly prod at his nose and comb the hair off his face, his lip trembling as sharp gusts of air escaped him. “What do you
Potter doesn’t comment and simply continues flipping through the pages, quietly letting Draco in on the only existing memories of his family. When he gets to a photo of James and Lily Potter, a tiny, rotund baby with wispy black hair and vivid green eyes, sat on Lily’s hip waving fat little fists at the camera, Draco lets out a slightly strangled sound of wicked delight and drags the album closer.
with Potter,” Lucius mutters distastefully, one hand clutching the armrest very tightly. “Were you that desperate to
“Darling?” she says softly, and Malfoy jerks, wiping sweat off his upper-lip and darting Harry a quick, unreadable look. “What is it? Is something wrong?” She suddenly looks alarmed. “Are you unwell? Is that what you meant when you said Harry saved you?”
want off?” Malfoy asks, breathless and sharp. “Are you saying you’re the only one who knows how to commit?”
Harry was surprised – not that Malfoy’s wife had wanted to teach him tricky magic but that Malfoy would admit to it at all. Malfoy’s words hung between them, getting heavier every second because...
Potter still doesn’t look piqued. In fact, his mouth ticks up on one side and he suddenly seems less tense. “Then why d’you want to know?” he asks, still smiling.
“Not at all. Would you like to try the raisins instead? James doesn’t like the tartness of them and Albus insists it feels like he’s eating bugs with his porridge.”
, his mind immediately supplies with relish, and Draco sways to his feet with a growl and marches over to untie Granger’s letter. They’ve been writing for a few days now, exchanging gift ideas for Potter’s birthday and he’s already mentally set aside a neat sum in his vault that he rather desperately wants to spend on that generous arsehole.
Harry laughs quietly, sifting his free hand through Malfoy’s hair, dragging it along the damp roots. Despite the deep exhaustion he can sense settling around his very bones, his thighs and back screaming from overexertion, his head still lightly throbbing from the tinny whistle he’d been blowing as he’d coached all evening, Harry feels wide awake. He feels around behind himself and finds the smooth edge of the book. Just as he’s guiltily contemplating disturbing a half-asleep Malfoy, he stirs against Harry, glancing around over his shoulder and then rolling onto his back, smiling at Harry.
There’s a slight rustle of bedclothes as Malfoy resettles next to Harry, somehow pressed closer to him now. “Do you, perchance, think people have forgotten everything you’ve done for them and instead only focus on the fact that you’re a werewolf now?” Malfoy asks smoothly in a single breath.
The sweat on Malfoy’s skin shone golden as he sat there astride Harry’s hips, his hair sticking to the sweat on his forehead and along the sides of his cheek. His lips were wet and dark, slightly swollen, and his eyes were dark and slightly frantic.
“You...shouldn’t have gone after Simon,” I say just so that it’s on record that I had objected to Draco’s antics.
catch up,” Potter sighs, rolling his eyes again, the glib bastard. “You got the note, right? Is 7:45 okay, then?”
“Is that chicken?” Draco appears out of nowhere and indicates hopefully to the half-eaten sandwich on my plate, gratefully grabbing it up when I nod and push it towards him. “’M
I turn around with a snort, grinning at the sight of the snooty arsehole at the door, huge white cardboard box in one hand, wand twirling lazily in the other.
By now, Draco is completely certain that he’s mere seconds away from climaxing vigorously in his pants with Potter’s cock so deep down his throat that he’s lightheaded and swaying on his knees from lack of oxygen.
Malfoy hisses, a short, sharp intake of breath through clenched teeth, and jerks away, but Harry’s hand is only fisting more firmly in his hair, drawing him right back in and kissing him so hard that Malfoy’s head slams back into the rough brick wall. Harry can barely even
Draco lies in bed, staring at the brilliant white patches of light on his ceiling, quivering every time the curtains flutter. His stomach flutters lightly too, because it’s Potter’s he’s thinking about and it’s Potter he’s
They’re rather unapologetically wrapped up in each other, spending most of their free time together, much to the weary disgust of their friends. Potter becomes Harry and Malfoy becomes Draco, and eventually, they’re able to walk down a corridor holding hands without a swarm of breathlessly whispering, avidly staring students following them.
“Classy,” I snort. “Brought up in a Pureblood household, were you?” I laugh despite myself and he flips me off even as he delicately brings his tea up to his pink mouth.
Mostly because Draco doesn’t have Potter’s cock lodged so deep in his arse that he’s coughing from it tickling his throat.
Back on the ground, the players cluster around him as usual, and a quick glance across the stadium tells him that Malfoy is still in the stands. He has a word with a few players, including Ava who’s incredibly sheepish when Harry playfully tells her to reign in her temper tantrums, and reminds Elena to come in early the next day so he can time her with a fresh Snitch.
The corners of his eyes soften as he smiles back. “You’re growing old, Potter,” he says softly, mischievous twinkle back in place. “It’s a little sad to watch.”
Probably just to test her patience further, Malfoy doesn’t take the goblet from her for several more seconds, finally snatching it from her and sitting back down heavily, glaring resentfully at the water before gulping it down in one go.
Harry drank his beer and Malfoy stared at the floor. Across the room, the children now had smears of chocolate on their faces along with the mud, and they were all, Lily included, giggling madly at something Scorpius was saying, Scorpius himself hardly able to hold in his giggles long enough to speak.
“Don’t be absurd,” Malfoy scoffs softly. “All these years without incident and you lose control simply because I threatened to sleep with someone else?” There’s a hint of a smirk to Malfoy’s tone now and Harry’s jaw aches with how hard he grits his teeth.
I snort. “Right.” I don’t say anything for a few seconds during which Ron fidgets with the drawstrings of his pyjamas and Hermione’s gaze fixed on me never wavers.  “I would try,” I finally say quietly. “I would try to make it work.” I don’t tell them how it genuinely feels as if I’ll never get a chance to.
and tell Potter how much the sight of him with another man made him want to burn the whole place down. “I don’t even know what I was expecting from you, Potter. Of
Malfoy stares at his knees for a long time, expression tight and strained, throat bobbing as he swallows. “It’s not just in the mornings, though,” he finally says softly. “I—I tend to sick up at any damn time of the day.” Hermione’s quill scratching away is the only sound in the room as she nods at him to carry on. “And I’m either ravenous or I want to throw up at the sight of food,” Malfoy adds irritably.
Distracted for the tiniest moment, Harry stares. Then, “Hermione made me,” he sighs. “I’m not a big fan of balls, to be honest.”
Harry slipped out of the bed at once, retrieving the bundle that were his pyjamas and walking around Malfoy’s bed and back to his own. He wondered if he ought to look for a deeper meaning to Malfoy’s words. And then he felt like a prat for trying to pretend like he was in some sort of deeply moving novel or film. Malfoy was referring to his fucking rib. And he felt pretty fucking great apart from that, if he were to be honest.
“I’m going to tell everyone the second I get there and you can sit on my lap, if you like,” Harry says at all once, raising his eyebrows. “And arrive separately? You think you’re getting away anytime soon, Malfoy? I’m taking you home right now.”
“Yeah, you and I both, Potter,” Malfoy says, lips quirking slightly. Then, slightly more seriously, “Are you all right? Where’s Weasley?”
His face warming further, Draco emits a sharp bleating sound before breathing deeply. “Oh come off it, Potter, it was twenty minutes with a reeking toilet for company.”
arsehole.” The twitch of his lips and the bright speck in his eyes is proof enough that he’s not really annoyed.
“It makes no sense.” Harry looked around the little clearing again. Then he sighed. “I was supposed to make it to Wales. At
When the first lick came, Draco jerked purely out of surprise. Then he planted his feet more firmly, toes curing inside his shoes, and shamelessly pushed his hips back out. There was a low chuckle – and then Harry planted his face in Draco’s crack with the air of a man settling down for a much looked-forward-to feast.
Ron immediately snorts, holding one hand, palm up, under the bar as I start with my set. “Just ‘cause
“I’m not going anywhere with you,” he murmurs without rancour, seeming to suddenly wilt with exhaustion as he averts his gaze. “I want to go to the Manor.”
“What?” Harry muttered distractedly, shovelling one final forkful of shepherd’s pie into his mouth before picking up his bag and hurrying to his feet. “I just—I have some stuff to do.”
To which Malfoy, all cheeky grin and sparkling eyes, laughed and murmured, “Well, took you long enough, then.”
Ron however, just snorted. “You got off with him, yeah? What’s not to fucking like?” He was grinning now and it was rather obnoxious and inexplicably enough, Harry felt his face begin to heat.
“Yes, Harry,” Hermione sounds just as exasperated. She taps impatient fingers against the ladder I’m perched at the top of, my head and torso inside the musty smelling attic. “The box of ornaments my mother gave me isn’t here. That’s the one we’re missing.”
Harry’s wildly hammering heart slows very slightly when he sees that although tiny, Malfoy’s flat – sparse but clean – is not as bad as he’d envisioned on his way upstairs. The walls are bare and what little paint remains is peeling. There’s a rather cluttered little desk under the sole, square window, and Harry immediately spots the letter he’d sent Malfoy that morning. A small, tidy kitchenette lies to his left, a single bed, neatly made, against the wall on the far right. There’s an old wardrobe, the dark wood faded and scratched, and, across from it, an overstuffed, rather comfortable looking winged armchair, a small patch of the upholstery torn and leaking fluffy cotton on one of the armrests. A large trunk sits beside the armchair, several books stacked neatly on it along with a steaming mug of what Harry can smell is tea. There’s a bathroom on the right, a little off the foot of the bed, the door slightly ajar, and Harry can just about spot the porcelain of a stained sink with a cracked, dirty little mirror above it.
I’m thoroughly relieved by the arrival of Seamus and Dean, who are almost immediately followed by Ron and Hermione. In the ensuing surge of everyone greeting each other, ordering drinks and wishing Tristan a happy birthday, I’m able to sidle away to the edge of the group, lean back against the bar and drink my beer in silence. Ron comes to stand beside me, talking loudly over the music with Dean, but I am relatively undisturbed and am able to successfully continue tormenting myself about the fact that Draco and his boyfriend might soon be announcing their engagement and a fucking spring wedding or something.
Potter just sniggers as Draco stomps off, shaking his head and looking at him in a way that can only be called
He writhes in complete silence, back undulating and toes curling as Potter steadily licks him loose. He flinches every now and then when Potter slyly nibbles at the wrinkled flesh just inside his rim, soothing away the tantalising sting of it with the broad of his tongue, all the while scissoring the fingers he’s got inside Draco.
Harry licked his lips on a lazy grin, switching the phone to his left hand and reaching to curl his right around his cock. “Ah.”
“How many ever times it takes me to listen,” Draco replies, gasping as Potter sinks his teeth into the crook of his neck and shoulder, biting down until Draco’s spine is arching off the sofa. “Merlin, don’t turn me into one of your kind,” Draco chokes out, trembling as Potter sucks at the flesh between the deep indentations left by his teeth.
“Will you let me help you in some way?” Draco asks in a murmur, fingertips moving gently over Harry’s scalp. “Please?”
He’s still masticating like a cow, choking a bit every few seconds as he swallows, moist eyes fixed on the painted bowl of wildflowers placed at the centre of the table, when Potter leans in and closes one startlingly warm hand over Draco’s, which is still curled in a death grip around his fork. Cheeks bulging, lips gleaming with grease, Draco looks up, finally horrified at how he must probably look like a very blond chipmunk on the verge of violently barfing and then bursting into tears.
He never much enjoyed the ambience of a club – the unrelenting press of strangers’ bodies, the music that, after a point, was just basically
with an impossible amount of pent-up energy; Potter’s uncomfortable intensity, his incredible, careless strength – it ought to put Draco off, all of it.
with him today, and Draco had found himself, quite involuntarily, returning the sentiment in whatever way he could bring himself to.
“He was kind of a prick,” Potter suddenly grunts, and Draco tears his eyes off his father to look at him in surprise. Potter’s mouth quirks but he doesn’t return Draco’s gaze. “They both were. But Dad loved Mum longer than she him. He
They moaned into each other’s mouths as Draco sunk, not very carefully, onto Harry’s cock. The shaft pulsed and throbbed inside him, the burn of accommodation making Draco go cross eyed. “Wait!” Draco gasped as Harry lifted him back up so only the head was inside; but before Harry could scrabble to obey, to hold him firmly in place, Draco was already sliding down once more, gravity and his own weight dragging him into place around Harry’s cock, which then slid snidely over Draco’s prostate in a flash of near blinding pleasure. Draco thrashed. “
Draco is...barely conscious; he’s in a whole other world – one where nothing exists Potter’s ravenous, deadly mouth assiduously prising his arsehole open so that it’s soft and leaking spit, and Draco’s own hand, flying over his copiously seeping cock with loud squelches bunching the foreskin down and smoothing his palm over the glans and teasing the ridge underneath until he’s suddenly almost knocked backwards, right over Potter’s head, by his orgasm.
“You’ve got to believe me on this,” he says, silently pleased that he manages to sound rather steady. “Ginny and I are nothing but friends; she’s
“What do you mean?” Narcissa looks absolutely horrified. “What do you mean by that? Where did you go after you left that boy? Draco, we thought you were working –
“How can you still want me?” Draco asks abruptly, sounding partly petulant and partly genuinely curious.
“I never did manage to beat the rumours and get there first,” Draco smiles mirthlessly, “Anywhere I went, they already seemed to know. It’s okay, though,” he says quickly as Potter’s face darkens further, “I managed to keep afloat. Slug and Jiggers – the apothecary on Diagon? – my grandfather was one of the investors when it first opened so I was able to pull some strings. Helped out when they needed an extra hand, even brewed for them – they had fixed rates but they always paid me on time. I...” he swallows past the sudden knot in his throat, “I had to sell the watch I was gifted when I came of age but it did bring me a neat sum, so, I won’t—So, I won’t complain.” Draco swallows again and pauses a second, staring hard at the plush cream upholstery of the sofa. “Plus I have my personal vault at Gringotts,” he finally adds, blinking and noiselessly sighing through his nose.
“Master Harry will be meet young Master Black in the kitchen,” the elf insists when Draco just stands there and eyes the dingy stairwell with distaste.
“And I love you,” he replied, placing his palm over the tattoo and nuzzling Harry’s jaw. “You didn’t have to, though. Did it hurt?”
It was properly dark inside the hall even though it wasn’t very late. The rain never stopped pouring and after a while the children began to get restless. Scorpius had his father dig out a book from their trunk, and Albus and he sat and pored over it. Lily ran clumsily around the room, trying to catch the shimmering bubbles that Harry conjured for her entertainment. Malfoy sat in silence and wiped his sword clean, over and over again.
Looking up, Draco’s breath catches sharply in his throat as he watches the fat tears spill over and streak down his grimy cheeks, some catching on the rim of his glasses. His lips tremble and his face starts to crumple and despair climbs up Draco’s throat like bitter bile as he straightens up, standing on his knees and holding his arms out.
Leaning forward in confusion, Draco watched Moody hop awkwardly around the large bundle of material, tripping over it, when it suddenly struck him that—
“I’m aware,” Malfoy says stiffly. “Announce my arrival to them, please, and tell them I’ll meet with them in here. You’ll serve tea for four.”
“Potter,” he whispers shakily, letting his head fall back to let Harry lick long strokes up his neck, sucking up a little bruise every now and then.
“I can’t imagine what it must be like at that age,” said Harry, remembering what it was like at thirteen.
“Hey,” Potter greets him mildly as Draco walks up, scowling a bit. “I requested the room,” he adds, indicating with his thumb.
. Draco, who is no longer with Tristan, knows that I am back together with someone he’d once made colourful plans to kill. Draco, who is no longer with Tristan, now probably hates me more than he hates Simon.
“And this is why I warded myself in,” he says pointedly. “Pansy wouldn’t shut up either and I don’t want to talk about this yet.”
“Blaise, you fucking traitor,” Draco gnashes his teeth as he glares at Zabini who’s just pulled out another cold one for Ron.
Soft, amused laughter bubbles out of Draco before he can help it. “Why are you such an utter tit?” he asks with weary exasperation as Potter grins back. “I don’t—Let’s just go somewhere...not so fancy, Potter,” Draco says evenly, eyes on his finger as it traces the rim of his tea cup.
“I might not be a very good student,” Draco blurts hurriedly, resisting the impulse to reach out and grab Potter by the arm. “We’ll likely lose patience and end up flinging hexes, Potter.”
But Malfoy would simply blink at a spot somewhere over Harry’s shoulder, pick up the books he’d dropped and flounce away – like it didn’t even matter to him; like it hadn’t even made a difference to him.
He smoothes his hands down his sides, feeling rather self-conscious in his neatly pressed trousers and formal button down, and sends an awkward nod around the room to nobody in particular. Granger is curled up neatly in the sofa chair with a glass of white wine, bright-eyed as she smiles at Draco and her husband is sat on the floor in front of her and leaning back against the chair, expression moronically vapid as he stares fixedly at Draco’s stomach, arms resting on bent knees, one hand wrapped loosely around the neck of his cold pint. Potter is watching Draco nervously from where he stands behind Granger; he isn’t nursing a drink, the fool, and Draco suspects that it’s only because Draco can’t drink.
“Thank you,” Potter murmurs, wet mouth ticking up on a slow smirk, one thumb running along Draco’s lower lip as he strokes his bump and then reaches for Draco’s cock with his free hand.
“I wasn’t worried,” Harry replied at once. “I wouldn’t care if you did. I meant what I said earlier; you telling people would spare me the trouble.”
“Can’t you...take it before you eat?” Draco asks quietly, handing over his napkin when Potter fumbles for and drops his.
“Could you turn up the volume?” I nod towards the telly and drink more beer. Ron complies, increasing the volume by about two bars and then continuing over the chorused laughter of the studio audience in the show.
When, several minutes later, Potter turns to him and asks, thoughtful and quiet, “Is it specifically me and
After helping Lily eat a plain cheese sandwich and some chocolate, Harry brought Malfoy a sandwich and another can of beer. Malfoy was rifling around in his trunk and when Harry peeked in, he saw the food and beer he had brought over the night before, untouched.
is the actual beginning of their relationship, not because they’re about to fuck for the first time, but because there is there was now a sense of
!” he growls when Malfoy thrashes under Harry’s frantic hands and mouth, reaching back to clutch at Harry’s hair.
The four of us at the bar heave with laughter while Draco turns a dangerously threatening glare towards Ron who is still draped around his neck, hooting in triumph. Draco shoves him off, his lip curling as he stomps over to me.
Then, with one final shaky exhale, he’s stepping inside and shutting the door behind himself, effectively locking himself into a room with a (with
Ron rolls his eyes as he rounds his desk, pausing for a moment next to Harry’s to collect an additional two folders, before going and roughly dumping the whole pile into Malfoy’s arms.
“He can’t be older than four,” Harry’s voice is rough and wracked with the sort of agonising guilt that slowly eats away at one’s insides, “barely
“Hmm?” Granger only seems to register Potter’s question now. “Oh, I just meant that he’ll inadvertently be seeking emotional support from you – it’s natural to expect it from your partner when you’re in a physically and emotionally compromised state, really.” She draws her wand, snorting at the way Draco is scowling at her explanation. “Additionally, he’s going to be relying on your magic as well.”
Harry thought that maybe Malfoy might have tacked on an insult at the end of that sentence. But Malfoy, strangely enough, seemed the sort who wouldn’t swear in front of children. Harry couldn’t explain it, but he was sure of it.
Harry himself looks absolutely gorgeous, Draco thinks rather broodingly. Even though he likely hasn’t combed his hair in a week, despite the clunky glasses he wears, his Muggle ripped jeans – none of it puts Draco off. Harry’s arms and chest are still lightly muscled, abdomen taut and flat, hip bones begging to be touched and licked.
?” Lucius smirks and Harry rolls his eyes in genuine exasperation, “Because we already know that, Draco. News travels across the continent too.”
“Just...a huge fucking argument,” I say. “He tried to hex me. I asked him to fuck off. It was just...petty and nasty.”
After a significant amount of time spent fumbling around for his wand, Harry cleans himself up and pulls down his locking charms with several clicks that are very loud in the quiet stillness of his flat.
With a little grin, Potter bends back over him. “Does it hurt?” he asks curiously, blowing over the wet nipple, pausing when Draco cries out and arches towards his mouth.
“No matter what happens, neither of you are to let go of Lily’s hands, understand? She connects the three of you
This one lasts long enough that Harry loses track of time, slow and scorching, Malfoy’s legs wound around his hips, his nails hooked into the dampness of Harry’s back; this time when Harry pulls away, Malfoy drags him back in for more.
Potter, the courteous, hospitable bastard – always doing little things for Draco just to drive him up the wall.
Malfoy scoffs, throwing Harry a look, his glossy hair sliding over his forehead and onto his eyes. “Weasley just invites me to be polite, Potter,” he says, absently swirling his scotch around the glass, long, agile fingers stiff as he holds the tumbler by the rim. “He invites half the department, and the only reason he bothers with me is because I’m your partner and share an office with you, and he thinks I’d be
because he was dependent on Malfoy to lead him back to his children. The whole trip had taken less than ten minutes.
He’d eventually tried to simply distract himself; he’d Floo’d over to Ron and Hermione’s, and assembled an infuriatingly complicated crib for Rosie; Ron had been grateful that
But then I see the strain of hurt bewilderment in the resentment that’s simmering in his narrowed eyes and the resulting blow to my gut feels like I swallowed an anvil. He’s not that person anymore; he hasn’t been for years.
“Will you tell me about them sometime?” he asks instead. Potter looks up at him in confusion. “Your Muggle relatives,” Draco says quietly. “Will you tell me about them sometime? I mean...” he licks his lips, shrugging one shoulder, “only if you feel comfortable telling me.”
I’m suddenly unable to pull my gaze off his lower lip, shiny with spit. “Well, technically, I’ve already met him before.”
always save the day. And Harry,” Draco takes him by the chin and forces him to look around at him, “you’ve
“But still,” Draco murmurs, shaking his head, “I saw the m—I mean, I noticed and it still slipped my mind.” He pauses a moment, gaze shifting to Potter’s as he tilts his head thoughtfully. “I’ve lived here more than one moon cycle,” he says slowly. “How come I’ve never noti—how come you haven’t—?”
“Potter,” Draco gasps, lower back arching off the bed as Potter’s fingers slide in, slow and sure, right against his prostate.
When he’d discovered that Simon had been fucking someone else behind my back, Draco had been over and beyond
Harry feels Malfoy’s words touch every nerve ending he has, lighting his whole being up like nothing else had in a very long time.
His forehead is too big, I decide. His eyes are set too close. He’s definitely hiding a bald spot on one side of his head.
Malfoy slants him another smirk, pocketing his wand and picking up his knife and fork. “I’ll forgive you if and when I feel like it, Potter,” he says lazily, instantly looking much more like his old self.
Belly tightening with something white-hot and lewd, Draco nips his soft earlobe sharply before moving, all at once, to straddle his upper chest, his cock smacking Harry’s chin and leaving a smear of moisture on it. Harry dips his head, chin lowering as he mouths fervently, managing to get just the tip of Draco’s prick into his mouth. Shuddering and pushing one hand into Harry’s wild locks, Draco shifts higher, planting his knees on either side of Harry’s neck and angling his cock, sheathing it completely into the wet, heated suction Harry instantly provides.
from it. “I know how I can help you!” he blurts out, effectively cutting off Potter’s rant about watching human hair dissolve into a glass of Polyjuice.
“Potter, you don’t have to buy me things all the time.” Draco had tried to sound snappish but it came out sounding more consoling and rather wearily fond. “I’m not completely broke yet, you know?”
to get me fired?” he hisses as he walks up to us a few seconds later. “I have other customers, you know.”
“Yes, you do, Harry, and you probably don’t want to tell me for some idiotic, irrational reason,” Draco says fiercely, jerking back and grabbing Harry’s face. Smoothing back the unruly black strands off his forehead, Draco takes him by the chin and lifts slightly until their eyes meet. “Tell me what’s on your mind,” he says gently, but with no room for argument.
Three dementors glided in, ten feet tall, the black of their cloaks somehow even blacker than the night outside.
And then Harry felt as though he was somewhere outside, flying at top speed, the wind whipping through his hair and cutting into his skin and leaving him all tingly while something did loop de loops in his stomach and his heart fluttered happily around his chest. It felt like he’d never back come down.
He finally smiles, a crooked little smirk that has me smiling back. “Yeah.” He shrugs one shoulder. “I just – you’ve just been really quiet since we got here and I thought--”

was in charge. Potter lined kisses up Draco’s spine and told him he’s beautiful. Draco asked Potter to shut the fuck up and put his cock to some use.
“Sorry,” Potter pants hoarsely into Draco’s shoulder. “Wanted it to last—thought I’d last longer but—fuck, you’re so
“He’s got all sorts of shit back there,” laughed Harry, turning to peer behind the fridge again. “Oh my god,
It’s a small, square room, bare but for an overstuffed sofa against the back wall piled with a few cushions, a pitcher of water and two goblets on a low, end-table beside it.
And then he’s prancing lightly out and back into the party, rolling up his sleeves that had slipped back down to his wrists, and I smile at the way the yellow light catches in his bright hair before I follow him.
Malfoy stood up and slowly approached, his fingers twitching at his sides. When Harry held her out, Malfoy stuck his arms out awkwardly. Harry supposed he had never been the sort of father that held his toddler son very frequently. Posh people were like that.
“And?” Ron had prompted, but Draco had merely shrugged. “Wait, you’re not going to threaten to tell us in horrific detail just how thoroughly that eejit fucked you all over his place last night?”
Harry groans into the bruise he’s sucked, immediately rutting into Malfoy’s hand, his whole body burning with sensation. “What don’t you do, Malfoy?” he remembers to ask after a second, yanking aside Malfoy’s collar some more so he can bite into the soft crook of his neck.
Right up until the moment their lips touched, Harry had been sure that Malfoy was going to whack him across the face and stomp back to the castle before making a shouted announcement about Harry’s perversions.
Draco just shrugs. “I just didn’t want to be in the way when they all arrive,” he says, dragging both hands down Potter’s chest. “I’ll be in my room. The elf can bring me a tray there.”
He’s halfway down the hallway now but suddenly turns around when he realises I haven’t followed him in. Frowning confusedly he makes his way back to me.
“We have to go back for her,” James said, his voice cracking. “You don’t know if she’s dead, right? Let’s go check.”
“Now’s when you say it, you know,” he murmurs drowsily against Harry’s forehead. “Choose your moments wisely, Potter.”
“Don’t you have any work to do?!” Draco asks irritably. “Where are the files I asked you to pull out of the archives for me?”
Just as swiftly as he’d seized him, Potter releases him, and Draco stumbles back once more, breathing hitched as he gapes at Potter who’s once again staring at him, lips parted, expression thoughtful. The skin where Potter’s nose had touched his neck burns like he’s been branded.
believe,” his fingers curl around the back of Draco’s neck, inching towards his ponytail, “that I want to fuck
Draco glowers, his heartbeat thundering in his ears now. “Let me out of here,” he hisses, teeth grinding together.
Forcing his eyes open, Harry rolled onto his side, pushing himself up onto one elbow, looking around in a daze. It was completely dark – even the moon was gone. Hands, small, helpless hands, scrabbled at Harry, his sons’ cries devastating. Beside Harry was the tiny, still figure of his daughter.
“He owled me,” Draco supplies. He’s not smiling anymore. “He’s at Mungo’s too. I’ve convinced him not to press charges, by the way.”
“It just makes him an advanced model, I suppose,” Granger laughs, ignoring Potter’s irritable tongue-click. “He’s got stronger bones, richer blood, sharper senses compared to other werewolves—”
Potter follows his gaze and lets out a bark of laughter. “Yeah, didn’t have the heart to get rid of all of them,” he says, genially rueful. “This used to be Sirius’ room,” he explains when Draco looks at him in confusion. “There were literal
I finally slot my cock into place. He’s panting quietly with his eyes shut, his knees cradling my hips. With my arm trembling where it’s holding me up, I nudge forward, applying steady pressure until suddenly, just like that, I’m inside Draco.
When he feels the lube I conjure against his arsehole, his mouth drops open and he shudders, still not looking at me, and when I press my forefinger into him, just up to the first knuckle, he shuts his eyes with a harsh exhale.
Harry took a deep breath, right hand tight on his wand. He clearly pictured the backyard of his cottage in Godric’s Hollow. He turned in place.
Ron shrugs. “I suppose, yeah. My great-grand uncle lived to be about a hundred and eighteen, I think. I dunno what happened to his family though.”
“I’ve been living with him,” Malfoy answers brashly, sticking his chin up when Lucius’ eyes bulge, sighing after a moment and turning to Narcissa. “Mother, don’t. Don’t cry,” he murmurs gently, patting her knee until she wipes her face and looks up, her face blotchy and eyes red.
“Spot of tea?” Harry asked, not waiting for an answer as he pulled out a kettle and two mugs. A few minutes later he silently handed Malfoy his tea and sat down on the newly cleaned floor, leaning against the wall. Lily ambled around, bored and a little lost.
Draco scoffs, a fountain of crumbs spraying out his mouth, before taking another shamelessly large bite; Potter doesn’t even seem to notice the way Draco is stuffing his mug like a starved Erumpet.
“How come I haven’t seen a single pregnant wizard then, ‘Mione?” Harry asks wearily, rubbing at his forehead.
He’s shaking now, Draco, his thighs and hips aching with the strain, his throat dry and rasping from breathing in through his mouth. Each exhale of his comes out as a high-pitched, needy little keen, his fingers tightening around Harry’s hair in warning yet again.
“You’re practically family, Harry,” Granger sighs, adding the new sheets of Draco’s medical information into his file and shutting it. “D’you think you can pick up your pre-meal potions if I write you a prescription, Malfoy? I have a home-visit to get to.”
Malfoy shakes Harry’s hand off and follows it up with a rough shove to the chest. “Go fuck yourself!” he yells. “I don’t have to tell you both
It had been the day after Draco had moved in and Draco had come out of the bathroom to find an absolutely hideous, wrinkled old creature making his bed and had shrieked embarrassingly loudly before realising that it was actually a bloody
But he does anyway, on a deep sigh, shifting closer and hooking a sweaty, quivering leg over him as he sighs next to Draco. “Just you, Potter. Always, just you.”
a war criminal,” Harry retorts calmly, tightening his hold on Malfoy when his lips pull back in a snarl. “But I knew that speaking in favour of you and your mother would be enough to clear his name too, simply by association.” Harry cups his face again and holds it tightly, staring right into his eyes. “I’ve
“You wouldn’t be able to handle a dragon, Potter,” Draco drawls and Potter’s eyes suddenly flash with a knowing gleam.
,” I say honestly, sounding rather flabbergasted even to myself. Draco doesn’t say anything to that, merely rolling his eyes and sighing though his nose. “So you’ve actually like... talked to him and stuff? This past week?” I finally prod carefully.
Only two weeks since he’d moved in with him and Draco is already more comfortable and at home than he’d ever been in that filthy hole he’d lived in all these years. Potter doesn’t get in his way and never pries when Draco keeps to his room, but when Draco does deign to make an appearance in the sitting room or for his meals Potter seems ridiculously pleased and more than happy to spend a while in Draco’s company.
The blush spreading across those high, aristocratic cheekbones is unmistakable. “Getting a little ahead of ourselves, are we?” Draco nuzzles at him. “You’re a cocky bastard, aren’t you?”
“Well, if he’s gay, I’ll wear my tightest pair of trousers.” Malfoy was definitely smirking now and Harry had a feeling he fucking
“P-Potter?” he stutters, his fingers tightening in Potter’s hair as he nibbles at Draco’s collarbones.
Harry leaned back in his chair, eyebrows raised. When Malfoy continued to stare fixedly into his textbook, Harry asked softly, “We’re not?”
With the weak selfishness of those immersed in grief, Harry wondered if she too had been left an empty shell.
“What the hell,” Draco murmurs under his breath, pushing his long ponytail back over his shoulder and hiding his flaming cheeks by sipping more tea. “I want to help you,” he says one more time.
familiar. I’ve been here a few times as a child. Father would bring me when he had work to attend to at Salisbury. Sometimes I came here as a lad too, with Blaise when he would visit during the summer.”
” Draco is more annoyed than impressed now – she wasn’t even a professional and she knew more than most of his fellow brewers did. “This is additional to that. It’s beneficial to the end result. Granger, what do you want? Why are you here?”
Tilting his head, Harry latches his mouth over the wet hole, sucking with loud, crude slurps, mumbling unintelligibly into Malfoy’s arse as he shoves his tongue back in, joggling and bobbing his head as he goes back to fucking him with it. Malfoy moans throatily,
Harry’s hand is shaking around his wand, his other hand clammy where he’s gripping Malfoy’s hand – Malfoy, who suddenly looks absolutely shattered. Harry stares at him, throat dry and chest aching, until those grey eyes, unshuttered and slightly desperate, finally meet his.
“Oh,” exhaled the little boy as he slipped his hand into Harry’s and awkwardly pumped up and down. Malfoy cleared his throat. “I mean,” Scorpius swallowed, “how do you do?”
“And you’re free to roll around and eat grass with that half-bald wench,” Malfoy sneers, eyes narrowed to slits. “Go on, then, go back to her. Go back and laugh at me and gossip about me some more, like I’m sure you were just now. I’m just going clean up a bit and head out for the night.” He turns around and strides away, light, flowy robes billowing out behind him.
However, as Harry starts to suck, loudly and enthusiastically, pulling Draco open some more with steady, almost unrelenting suction, Draco comes dangerously close to just giving in and coming spectacularly all over himself. He tosses his head around, his hair loose and all over the place, his face burning hot, sweat prickling against his scalp and neck.
The circular skylight Draco had cut into the ceiling is letting in a thick, creamy white and perfectly straight shaft of moonlight into the room through the glass dome affixed to it. The ray of light fits perfectly around the circumference of the wooden pedestal, gleaming blinding white against the surface of the wide silver bowl set atop it. The bowl practically
Four hours later, I bang one fist into Draco’s front door in a relentless, aggravating beat until I hear an irascibly bellowed, “Who the
That is until Malfoy’s hands fly up into his own sweat-heavy blond locks, his eyes rolling back into his head, his mouth sagging wide open as he garbles, “Potter, please,” bucking up ineffectively under Harry’s heated weight.
“I could spell it dry for you.” Harry’s mouth was suddenly parched again; Malfoy’s nipples were nearly abnormally pink – bright enough that Harry could see clearly through the flimsy cotton.
Malfoy made a sound like a strangulated cat and Harry finally glanced back up at his face to see it burning a bright red, his lips parted as he breathed noisily, eyes impossibly wide.
“Draco,” he breathed, his grip on Draco turning savage as he stiffened and let out a guttural cry, pressing Draco onto his cock as if determined to come as deep inside him as physically possible. Whimpering, Draco pushed off the wall and wrapped both arms around Harry, clutching him to himself and pressing hot kisses onto his face which was still frozen in that rapturous mien of completion. “Draco,” he whispered again, and then Draco kissed him.
Draco’s gaze slowly travelled upwards, starting at the worn trainers, laces coming undone on the right one; the flap of a shirttail hanging out, crimson Gryffindor tie spilling out of one trouser pocket. Potter’s sleeves were rolled back haphazardly up to his elbows, thick forearms crossed across his chest, the first two buttons on his white shirt left undone. The mangy black head was thrown back in mirth, the unkempt mass of ebony making Draco’s hands itch with the desire to be buried in it. Light stubble shadowed the rugged jaw line; Draco could almost feel it on his skin already, scratching across him in a not entirely unpleasant way – not that he’d ever
.” He snorts softly into his handkerchief again, wiggling his nose into it until it emerges beet red.
Albus was blinking around, looking astonished at finding himself outdoors. James sat up, unruly hair flattened on one side, and stared up at the sky with his mouth slightly open. Then he looked down at the spot next to him.
Draco narrows his eyes. “Like you wouldn’t believe,” he replies breathlessly, dragging Potter back in.
After feeding Lily a final spoonful of creamed rice, Harry turned to the trunk once more. He pulled out small a collection of foods, a couple of bottles of water, and after a brief moment of consideration, a can of beer. He trudged across the clearing.
That edge Potter’s voice had held just a few minutes ago is now missing; he sounds almost...concerned – and
“No!” Draco says loudly. “No, it’s not that! I just—um, nothing, it’s just—a friend at work, she asked me who—she was asking if I’m seeing—she’s just a nosy little idiot, really, she’s my assistant, Octavia,” Draco rambles, shaking his head impatiently; Potter waits patiently though. “I didn’t tell her,” Draco blurts hurriedly. “I didn’t tell her about us, don’t worry.”
I meet his alcohol-glazed gaze steadily. He’s an utter mess, hair in his eyes and mouth, clothing dishevelled, veins popping at his temples. He’s white as a sheet, which is usual for when he’s angry or upset. Even his lips have gone pale. His neck is damp with sweat and he reeks of booze.
Draco has his head on my shoulder and is oddly quiet as he simply sits there with his eyes closed. I feel an inexplicable sense of satisfaction that it’s
Harry pushed his face into the manicured nest of blond pubes, nuzzling through the curls as he gripped Malfoy’s cock at the base with one hand and ran his other hand up Malfoy’s quivering flank.
Draco lets out an excited squeak. “He came! Move, Weasley. Oh for fuck’s sake, move your stupid flat arse.” He shoves impatiently at Ron until he slides out of his seat.
“I doubt anyone better even exists, love,” Draco answers truthfully. “If your tears didn’t prove that, then you still have your whole life as proof.”
He’s the first to look away; it feels like a victory. “I was wondering when I’d run into you again,” he murmurs, setting the weights down on the stand.
But I don’t hide. I stand there – I inch closer, in fact – and I wait. When he’s done with his set, Tristan’s gaze on the mirror shifts; he finally notices me standing behind him.
Malfoy howls and I hurriedly clamp one hand over his mouth with a frantically whispered, “Shit, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry!”
Weasley has to chime in at some point. And here Draco had been so pleased up until this second that he’d managed to go the whole three minutes he’d spent in the room without looking at that red headed prat.
Draco feels like the most selfish idiot alive as he simply stands and gapes at Potter, at the masked pain and turmoil in his face, the hard set of his jaw and the undeniable self-loathing in his eyes. Draco’d even spent several minutes gazing at the damn full moon the previous night, watching wispy cloud after cloud drifting lazily across the creamy orb as he’d recalled the way Potter had held his face in place and kissed him like a dying man, shivering lightly despite the night outside being sticky and still, his insides roiling with worry and humiliation at the way Potter had bolted.
They’d eaten dinner together, Potter and Draco; they’d actually sat across one end of the long wooden table in that brightly lit basement kitchen, and they’d shared a meal like two individuals who did not hate each other. They’d talked – about themselves, about each other, about Hogwarts and life after Hogwarts.
“Are you both not being… intimate?” she asks, not even blinking. “Does he have a problem with… the way you look now?”
“No, I’ll come downstairs now,” Draco calls out. Potter halts and looks back at Draco in surprise, a tiny smile playing about his mouth. “Tell the elf not to bring up a tray. I’m feeling okay, I’ll come down now.”
,” he says dryly, leaning down and pecking her cheek quickly. “I’ll be fine. Not my first full moon,” he adds over his shoulder with a smile as they start walking in opposite directions.
Harry blinked and slowly turned away, taking off his glasses and staring blankly at the sky, his wand clutched tightly in his hand beneath the blanket. It was only Ginny he could think of, his whole being yearning for her, tears running down the sides of his face. His last thought before he drifted off was how it was his own fault that she was gone.
“To go play Quidditch, I know.” Harry glanced over to see Malfoy look pointedly at Harry’s bare, tightly bound midriff. “Did your bloody glasses fall off? Who doesn’t notice a Bludger coming at them?”
“You heard me,” Draco turns back around with his drink, leaning back once more, his hip against my thigh.
I feel a sort of blinding happiness coupled with amusement spreading through my chest. “All of them?” I ask.
“Kittens don’t live in forests, Dad!” Albus joined in, crawling over James and coming over to peek under Harry’s blanket. “That’s Lily!”
“Half of which he’s already eaten,” Potter points out, yelping when Draco smacks his bare forearm sharply with long, bony fingers.
away from us.” He releases Draco and pulls back, only very slightly out of breath, the expression on his face more disappointed than angry. “It’s been over two years, Malfoy, for
Suddenly Draco’s elbows were being tugged at, prompting him to drop his arms and let Harry take his hands, guiding them behind himself. Face heating immediately, Draco slowly gripped and parted himself for Harry’s perusal, because Harry Potter was also shockingly filthy and it was probably one of his top three traits, in Draco’s top-secret opinion.
He was hazily floating on a cloud somewhere up in heaven, Harry’s fingers digging thoughtlessly into his soft bottom, his teeth scraping over Draco’s arsehole every few seconds. The sheets beneath him felt too hot and the room seemed to turn blurry and spin every time he let his eyes flutter open.
?” Malfoy screams, tearing off his cloak, bundling it up and throwing it down where the clasp clangs loudly against the floorboards. “Oh, wait, because I’m
Like the fact that even several seconds of staring at each other later, Harry still hasn’t smiled at him.
“I know, right?” Weasley says ruefully, getting to his feet with a soft creak of his chair, “Not nearly as exciting or convincing when said out loud. Well, ferret,” he grins at Draco instant glare, “Nice chatting with you. And obviously, it goes without saying that if you hurt Harry I will rip all of your shiny hair out your skull and strangle you with it, because no matter how uncomfortably good looking you might be,
I’m not very patient as I work him open thoroughly, but I’m watching him very closely for the smallest sign of discomfort. He displays none. He’s moving in time with my fingers, hips dancing and grinding as he works his arse onto my fingers with an ease of practice that I refuse to dwell upon.
?” Harry shoots back, voice slightly hoarse. He glares up at Draco from where he’s slouched on the sofa, glasses slightly lopsided, cheeks a bit ruddy.
while you’re around,” he laments, pushing his face back into the curve of Draco’s neck, pressing sloppy, wet kisses there as Draco tries not to pass out.
“I’m just doing my job back here,” Zabini drawls holding both hands up before hurrying off down the bar to serve a couple of giggling women who are twirling luridly colourful cocktail umbrellas at him to get his attention.
Harry falls asleep late, and wakes up late and opens shop late and so has to rush to get the fresh batches of ice cream out front on time. Lydia, his only employee, helps him carry out crates of fresh ingredients in from the delivery chute and talks without pause until he shoos her out to go mind shop out front. He’s just scraping out a batch of strawberry from the machine into its tub when the Floo bursts into a cloud of green and Malfoy steps out. Harry doesn’t look at him.
“Would it help soften the knot if I panicked and thrashed about?” When Harry starts laughing again, Malfoy slants him a smirk over his shoulder. “I’m just learning not to be surprised about all these impossible feats only
Harry rolled his eyes. “It was in the dead of the fucking night.” He sighed heavily through his nose as he was immediately assaulted with mental images of pale skin, blushing gloriously pink; that quivering, beautiful little arsehole; swollen, trembling hot mouth... “It was completely spontaneous, neither of us saw it coming but we did it anyway and he was very clear that he wanted it and now he won’t even fucking
Harry cries out into the kiss as Draco rocks back and forth over his cock, riding it in hard, steadily paced bounces, setting up a brisk yet cruelly teasing rhythm, working his own prostate with every carefully angled sit. Each time Harry trembles and pushes his hips up, going rigid as he hovers right on the very verge of climax, Draco stops moving entirely, getting away with this torture three separate times before Harry
,” Malfoy snaps, but his breath hitches as Harry pushes his slightly rumpled shirt higher up his back and presses his mouth to the dip of his spine, rubbing his erection in slow circles over his arse. “I’ve always fantasised about being fucked by you in an alleyway that smells like something severely flatulent recently
I reach out and after a moment’s hesitation, pull his hand holding the icepack away, instead tapping his nose with my wand and murmuring a Healing Charm. The redness instantly disappears and some of the tension in him melts away, his body relaxing a bit next to me.
Harry holds the tumbler with both hands, his expression vacant, head bowed, fierce, viridian eyes filled with pure, unfiltered anguish as he stares emptily at the floor. Draco’s stomach churns as he once again takes in the shapeless, damp patches of stickiness on his robes, the colour blending into Harry’s maroon uniform.
It’s Harry’s bright green gaze that first rises, to meet Draco’s, before Harry slowly pops off his cock, licking his lips and giving him a sly smirk. He wriggles out of his jeans and pants. “That’s not a very frightening threat, just so you know,” he drawls, pressing Draco’s knees further back onto his chest and shuffling forward on his knees. “But seeing as I’m likely to pop within three seconds of being inside you, I guess it won’t hurt to fuck you when you’re already this close.”
Another minute goes by and Draco thumps his fist into the door. “I know you’re home, you arsehole. Open up!”
“If you’re that impatient,” Harry pulls back and spins him around so quickly that Malfoy nearly completely loses balance before falling over the bike and bracing his hands against the freezing wall for support, “I could just fuck you right here.”
Draco grins bashfully, inhaling with his nose buried in Harry’s hair. His own hair is being gently finger-combed by Harry, long, loving strokes from root to tip, making Draco sink further into the ever intensifying lassitude that’s setting in.
“What?!” Harry forces out a laugh. “For fuck’s sake, Ron, you know that thing with Malfoy is just to take the mickey out of all those reporters.”
while I wait? Fuck my way through all of London in the hopes of finding him? What is this? Some fucked up version of Cinderella? Oh, shit,” he groans, “This
Their mouths meet in a ferociously hungry, terribly messy kiss, teeth clacking together too hard, tongues writhing wetly against each other. Harry can taste the zing of Malfoy’s drink on his tongue and growls as he winds a hand in Malfoy’s blond hair and roughly angles his face into place so he can shove his tongue further in. Malfoy moans, his hand tightening painfully around Harry’s erection, making Harry buck in shock and bite down too hard on Malfoy’s lip.
After a pause, Malfoy clears his throat softly. “What—what does that— what you mean?” he asks and seems to be holding his breath.
This time, their kiss is downright feral, Harry emitting sounds that are part-growls and part-whimpers, but his hands staying on the pillow all through it. When Draco pulls away, Harry makes a sharp, hungry sound that has Draco shushing him gently, their lips still brushing lightly together.
Ron simply sniggers, grabbing a three day-old, half empty packet of crisps from under a pile of ripped envelopes on Harry’s desk and returning to his seat. Malfoy makes a thoroughly annoyed sound as he peeks over the top of the pile of folders he’s holding to look for his glasses.
Draco stifles a gasp. “No!” he says too quickly and then colours deeply when Potter raises his eyebrows wordlessly, expression rather impassive. “I mean, that probably feels like taking the Cruiatus—” he starts.
Potter slowly slides an arm around Draco’s waist, looking as terrified as Draco suddenly feels. Their chests bump together and Draco feels the breath leave his lungs.
“She said the kid is doing fine, though, so you can stop trying to kill me,” Draco picks up the second roll on his plate and after only a moment’s hesitation eats half of it in a single bite, shutting his eyes and sighing as he chews. “Good
He’s laughing now. I cannot describe in words the perfection of the sight of Draco Malfoy laughing wholeheartedly. It’s almost ethereal.
Draco’s stomach flips over with excitement as Potter strolls in, Weasley beside him, gesticulating wildly, both of them deep in conversation. Potter’s still sweating from training, briny tracks running down the side of his face, forehead, upper lip and neck glistening with perspiration, the round neck of his grey a-shirt dark and wet with it. Potter runs the back of one hand across his brow, chuckling at something, no doubt, inane as fuck, Weasley is saying, and as his arm lifts, Draco can see the beads of moisture clinging to the wiry black hairs in his armpit.
Malfoy, completely still until now, moved so quickly that Harry gasped under his breath, reaching for his own wand out of pure, base instinct. The boy who’d made the comment about the blood went
Harry nods, gaze fixed on Malfoy’s pink mouth. “Yeah, those sound great. Anything else you can think of?”
Draco’s head whips around, mouth slightly open as he stares at Potter in disbelief. Potter looks puzzled, head tilted slightly as he takes in Draco’s wordless gaping.
Harry spent his days going about his routine like a robot, his mind instead on things like the fact that Malfoy had seemed
Malfoy is still grinning widely as he stops laughing and stares at Harry, shining eyes widening slightly. He tilts his head expectantly, face still open and smiling as he seemingly waits for Harry to laugh as well. “What?” he finally says blankly, when Harry just waits nervously.
“Oh, unclench, Auror Potter,” Draco drawls, rolling his eyes and using a paper napkin to dab at his eyes. “I was joking. I did not use any special
His yelp of shock is barely heard over Harry’s frightening snarl as he manhandles Draco off his lap and onto the bed on his front.
But he wanted to do it properly, and so every day, Harry wrote to him, and once in three days, Harry would go back to his flat. Malfoy eventually stopped opening the door for him so Harry stood there and pounded on his door for ten minutes and eventually left, promising to come back in a couple of days. He felt mildly embarrassed and very much like the crazy stalker Ron informed him he was being, but it all ended up being more than worth it when two weeks later, on a Saturday morning, Harry’s owl came back with a one-word reply:
He loves bartenders, Harry decides. Nobody else would serve him an eighth Firewhiskey on ice without even blinking, the way the tall, thin witch with the dozen moving tattoos along her arms and shoulders does.
She draws back slightly to grin up at me but keeps her arms around my neck. “Are you asking me or congratulating me?”
“Scorpius, you aren’t to say that word,” Draco says lamely, valiantly trying not to give into the laughter bubbling up.
Harry sniffles wetly, wiping his nose on his sleeve, shaking his head but not saying another word as Draco gently guides his head down onto his own chest, holding him pressed over his heart until he’s boneless and palpably calmer.
When Malfoy’s fresh glass of gin and tonic is back between his pale, spidery hands, he slants Harry a long, inscrutable look. “Trust you to be an obnoxiously charming drunk.”
“For Merlin’s sake, that’s not how one keeps their clothes crease-free,” says a lilting voice and Harry blinks around to see Malfoy leaning against the snow-frosted window of Honeydukes, almost blending into the white background in his pale,
Head thrown back, white gold hair spread out across the pillow, Adam’s apple bobbing in the long neck, thin chest heaving – eyes still shut; skinny limbs shifting restless in his sleep--
“I know it’s—I know I’m supposed to have found a way to cope with this,” Harry says, sounding desperately ashamed. “I know I’m supposed to be—to be
Malfoy sits with his back very straight, hands clasped in his lap. He’s bundled up in a cloak, his hair swept into a tight knot behind his head and he barely returns Harry’s smile, seeming preoccupied as he watches the Harpies over Harry’s shoulder.
Malfoy’s got him by the hair, both hands fisted in Harry’s mane, and he’s kissing Harry with the same fervent desperation that Harry’s insides are bubbling with. He still has a leg around Harry’s waist, and he’s grinding their cocks together almost unconsciously as he shoves and slides his tongue against Harry’s, nipping and biting ruthlessly at Harry’s mouth.
Draco splutters into his tea, blinking as flecks of it spray across his own face. Wiping them off roughly, cheeks burning even more hotly now, he throws a glare Potter’s way. “You’re taking me to
“Tastes so good,” Potter garbles at one point, wetly licking up Draco’s crease like a dog. “You’re so hot, Malfoy.”
Malfoy was pink in the face from what Harry could make out in the soft light from the lamp.  He blinked down at Harry’s hands working open his buttons and Harry suddenly had the urge to burst into hysterical laughter. He was undressing Draco Malfoy in the dead of night and was sort of getting off on it.
“Fucking ferret,” Draco muttered, elbowing Harry aside and reaching for the empty bottle of juice. “I’ll kill it one day,” he added
“Nobody gropes me,” he says with a chuckle. “None of them is even my type. There’s a certain lack of cocks on the team seeing as the Harpies is an all-women team,” he adds quickly as Malfoy lifts a brow haughtily.
“I don’t think she’s the one who has a problem with it,” she replies, leaning forward with a crinkly smile to stroke Lyra under her chin. “You are aware that your father and I have had regular intercourse for over three decades now?”
. Draco’s stomach fluttered and he could feel heat flooding his cheeks as he prepared to walk away, gulping hard and refusing to acknowledge the fond twinkle in those damn green eyes.
Things had been markedly pleasant between them since the Hog’s Head. They’d spent the whole afternoon, and a large portion of the evening, at the pub, finishing three helpings of Firewhiskey each before switching to Butterbeer and waiting for the tipsiness and random bursts of drunken giggling to pass; and in the meanwhile, talking.
He’d wanked twice in showers after training the previous evening, Potter’s hissed insults, the feel of his body pressing Draco down, the weight of it, the hard
Draco doesn’t turn around, just standing there in silence for a long time, his insides churning with a dozen emotions as he tries to find some energy to snap something unpleasant. “Goodnight, Potter,” he murmurs instead, sweeping out without waiting for a reply.
Neither of them has spotted Draco skulking behind the doorframe yet and so Draco carefully stays put, barely breathing for the terror that suddenly fills him making him instinctively grab the curve of his belly, his mind blank but echoing with a panicked shrieking of some kind.
Then Potter barks out a short, slightly derisive laugh and turns away, striding up to the table, sinking into a chair and slumping down in an ill-mannered slouch. “You chose a hell of a day to come sneer, Malfoy.” When Draco just continues to stand there, he slumps lower in his seat and kicks out the chair across the table from his. “Sit.”
“Are you, perchance, under the impression that I was on...a date of some sort just now?” Potter asks politely –
They headed for the living room and every fibre of Harry’s being dreaded the sight they might see. Ginny lying there, sprawled out; would she have the ability to feel sad at having been left alone all this time? Could she feel
“Good, good,” Hermione nods again, “Here are some pamphlets you can go through at your own convenience – basic do’s and don’ts, dietary requirements and restrictions, frequently asked questions and such. Is there anything you’d like me to clarify right now?” she adds gently.
Draco doesn’t quite know how to answer that because there’s a chaotic screeching that erupts inside his head while his heart takes wildly excited flips down to his belly and back up to his chest. Potter waits, face falling by small increments until Draco blurts out, “Dinner?” like a halfwit.
something might be up with you, but then when they call you out on it, your first impulse is to deny it and get annoyed that they’re reading too much into you?
Draco had simply stared at the gigantic, bright purple bag of sweets when Potter had heaved it onto the sofa beside Draco before looking back up at Potter in blank shock, at which point Potter had just shrugged and blushed and mumbled something about how Draco had finished most of the sweets in the bowl in his room before hurrying away.
Falling forward onto his hands with a wheezed sound of shock, Draco crouches there, knees on either side of Potter’s head, Draco’s hair flying around in a mess as he throws his head back and keens loudly. He doesn’t have to do anything really; Potter’s hands on his arse guide him in a slow, deep slide into his mouth, Draco’s cock jerking wildly each time it slips in deep. Potter is kneading his arse now, squeezing and working the flesh with increasingly fervent intent, and when Draco sobs and presses back into his hands, Potter growls.
“First of all, this isn’t about the actual Morgana,” Malfoy says, rolling his eyes exaggeratedly. “This is about a witch who’s separated from her—” He blushes faintly when Harry grins and raises his eyebrows. “Put away your teeth before I knock them in, Potter,” he snaps irritably. “I can’t possibly have you read me
him more, ruthlessly licking and teasingly sucking until Draco can feel saliva dripping down his crack. He slides in one finger, and then two, in quick succession, and makes his way straight to Draco’s prostate, flicking at it mercilessly until Draco is screaming into the pillow and striping the bedspread with ribbons of come, collapsing flat onto his front.
“You’re... I can't stand you,” Draco says breathlessly, roughly cupping his face and squeezing it, pressing their noses together.
Pretending not to notice, Draco sits down too, drawing his chair up close. “You said something just now,” he says flatly, “Alpha magic. What does that mean?”
Laughing, Harry turned him around and immediately nuzzled his cock, guiding it into his mouth with his left hand while his right slipped in between Draco’s legs. Grabbing him by two handfuls of his hair, Draco drove his cock into that wet warmth, panting through his mouth and groaning roughly when Harry pressed two fingertips into the yielding softness of his stretched hole. Draco’s stomach pooled with the kind of dull but terribly fierce heat that steadily spread outwards until his hips and groin and back all
Granger is pressing a warm hand over the little swell of Draco’s belly; next to them, Potter is ogling openly, mouth open and eyes wide as he stares at the bump. Draco stares at him until Potter’s eyes automatically meet his, and they both look away at once, cheeks warming.
For a moment, he genuinely believes that Potter’s going to pull his wand on him. The burning fury that flickers across Potter’s face is frightening in its heat and Draco’s hand involuntarily tightens on his wand.
Until, suddenly, the indolently hovering figure Draco’s gaze was fixed on moved so quickly that for one discombobulated moment, Draco thought he’d simply vanished into thin air. Harry flattened himself on his broom and plunged into such a steep nosedive that Draco’s stomach lurched just watching. Pansy gasped and Granger let out a soft shriek as Weasley, and the rest of the fucking school, hollered so loudly that the Forest beyond the pitch seemed to wilt from the noise.
Harry feels his stomach clench. “Are you telling me that this is somehow my fault? That I ought to have denied the contents of that bloody article that came out almost
“Why wouldn’t I be?” He sounded like the Malfoy Harry knew; cool, curt – shuttered; nothing like the man who’d just orgasmed with him, all while making the most deliciously lewd sounds as they jointly imagined Harry fucking him.
I turn where I’m sitting, looking up at him, opening my mouth but not saying anything because suddenly I have no idea how to apologise enough to make up for having said that out loud – because now he knows what I think.
Harry follows his calm statement up with a leisurely sip of beer while Malfoy slowly turns to regard him heatedly in shocked silence.
about him now, something that makes Draco wonder whether he himself carries an air of having grown up too fast, too soon as well, or whether it was just Potter.
, you’re already--” He suddenly gasps again, breaking off as Harry pushes his face into his neck and takes a firm mouthful to suck. “I never do this, fuck, but I
“Yes, well, we’re not an item,” Potter responds irritably. “Merlin, I spent the first two years after the War screaming about that to anyone who asked and you—” he sighs, looking weary, “I know you don’t care but I was just clarifying. That’s all.”
“I shut Moody up in his cage,” he said timidly, sitting up and awkwardly scratching his inner forearm over the vivid, flame-coloured tattoo of a phoenix. “Put his bowls in there too. He won’t get out until tomorrow.”
Malfoy smirks, and then instead of climbing on pillion, he straddles the bike facing Harry, settling onto the fuel tank and deliberately grinding their crotches together, his thighs settling atop Harry’s as he curls his legs around him. “You were right,” he murmurs, gnawing at Harry’s jaw. “I doubt I can sit very long right now, so get us there quickly.”
“I don’t care that you stare,” Malfoy declares at once, emerging from his hands, face and hands wet with tears.
in love with Draco. I just don’t fancy listening to him describe his sex life in minute detail. That doesn’t have to
Draco’s jaw is sore and his chin is slick with spit and precome by the time he pulls off, laying an open-mouthed kiss over the glans when Harry groans dolefully. His cock is flushed deep red, throbbing in Draco’s hand, the slit dribbling near constantly; when Draco dips his head lower and noisily sucks Harry’s balls into his mouth, they throb too.
I stare sullenly at him for several seconds before I realise I’m probably not getting hard again for a while anyway – not if the continued throbbing is any indication. Malfoy laughs as if he’s read my mind.
“Malfoy,” Harry presses his fingers to one suddenly aching temple, “please tell me what it’ll take for you to just...stop being like this. What would you have me do in exchange for being just a
And as he’d fucked Malfoy, for the first time in months, for the first time since he’d been bitten actually, he hadn’t thought about the wolf. His mind hadn’t wandered over to the ugly, blotchy pink scar on his left flank. He hadn’t been agonising over the fact that he’s technically a dangerous predator infected with a sickness that couldn’t be cured, and that how if not for his potions, he’d be considered a threat to society.
“I thought I just gave you your quality present.” Harry laughed again as Draco smacked him up the head. “Hey, extended rim jobs are perfectly acceptable presents, you spoilt brat. Learn to appreciate the sm-- Ouch!”
that big mouth of yours, Malfoy,” Harry breathes, standing between his knees and leaning over him, bending Malfoy backwards. “And don’t
He placed lube sticky hands under Malfoy’s knees and pressed them back onto his shoulders, planting his own knees firmly under his arse. With one hand, he reached down to line himself up, a nervous buzzing filling his head, Malfoy’s quick pants rather loud now.
“I always was, Granger, I’m a Veela by blood.” Draco sniffs haughtily, and Granger laughs. “What did Potter say about me?” he blurts out, not even caring that the gleam in her eye intensifies at his question.
Malfoy moans, bracing both hands against the wall and rocking back onto Harry’s cock. “I could’ve—sworn you—came just now, Potter,” he says, fighting to breathe as Harry further picks up pace. “Shit, right there—
!” Draco kicks at the door, bouncing his hips and clenching his arse as he eagerly rides Potter’s stiff tongue, “Yes! Fuck!
“At the kiosk outside the Office of Lycanthrope Affairs in the Department of Magical Beings, Level Four, Ministry of Magic,” the old elf gabbles away fluently in a croaky, wheezing voice, very clearly having memorised by rote.
Just over five months pregnant, he’s showing now, plainly and clearly visible through his clothes, and Potter simply does
“So you haven’t eaten anything yet?” Harry stares incredulously. “Right. Meet me downstairs in the kitchen. I might as well get a fry-up going, I can’t find Kreacher anyway. Malfoy,” he calls out with a sigh when Malfoy doesn’t look up from where he’s sniffing at the rose-scented hand soap and smoothing a hand over the stack of fluffy towels on the sink counter. When Harry calls out, Malfoy looks around, expression still rather shocked. “You remember where I pointed out the kitchen downstairs, right?” Harry asks and Malfoy nods. “Come down and eat breakfast,” he tells him, and Malfoy nods again, shrugging one shoulder.
At least that’s what he told himself when, half an hour later, he held a desperately thrashing, shamelessly moaning and completely naked Malfoy down in his warded bed and hungrily pushed his tongue deeper into his gorgeous, tightly clenching arse. Harry didn’t care if it was normal that he found himself
He stood up from where he’d been kneeling beside Harry. When he looked around, Harry realised they were somewhere new. For some reason, when he had regained consciousness, he had assumed they were back in the clearing.
Malfoy looked decidedly pink in the face now. “Don’t be a silly child. Come out and say hello like you were taught to.” And then that fond expression returned. “Like we know you’re dying to.”
“Rose petals, then,” Malfoy drawls, rolling his eyes and permitting Harry to kiss him for a few seconds.
“I’d rather I be the only one to see you starkers, thanks,” Harry says, groping around for the hem of Draco’s jumper.
“Fuck,” he whimpers under his breath as Harry makes a rough sound and fucks up into him on a completely unrestrained buck. When Harry’s hands scrabble wildly at the sheets and then slap onto Draco’s thighs, he takes him by the wrists, hunching over to hold them pinned above Harry’s head and, in the same move, lock their mouths together.
Malfoy led Scorpius to the stairs without comment or instruction; Harry expected him to disappear upstairs without looking back.
I go home and spend the rest of the evening putting up the entirety of the collection of Christmas decorations – including a miniature fake tree – which Draco had put together for me over the years. Every year he’d turn up with bagfuls of new shit to hang up around my flat. I do a particularly atrocious job and by the time I’m done, my house looks like a fucking joke, just dripping in lopsidedly hung up lights, bunched up tinsel and countless baubles. Draco would have a spectacular fit.
Then his cock is allowed to gently slap onto his heaving belly, and Harry cups Draco’s arse with both hands and hefts, lifting it up before resting his elbows on the frame of the bed straightening up off his heels, standing up on his knees, holding Draco up in the air.
“Why would I do that?” Draco asks, raising one eyebrow haughtily. “It isn’t even my sub-department. Why would I care who replaces you?”
the word ‘sex’ like that?!” Potter says frantically, darting a glance at the door. “I—I mean, sex would be brilliant, of course, but,” he looks slightly panicked for a moment when Draco splutters, both their faces maroon, “I meant
Malfoy doesn’t wear pants, Harry is more than a little pleasantly surprised to find out, an hour later.
Draco wants to hurt him. He wants to stub out his cigarette on Potter’s bare skin. He wants to tackle Potter to the ground and leave him covered in piss and rat shit. He wants to punch his face until it’s swollen and bruised. He wants Potter to
“Fuck off, Potter,” Malfoy snaps, impatiently wiping more tears that streak down his cheeks. “Yesterday I cried at the thought of leaving that hell-hole I used to live in. When in reality I couldn’t wait to get
Draco had stared helplessly at the expanse of damp, bronze skin and hard rolling muscles as Potter had looked wildly around the room and put two and two together, grinning amusedly at Draco before introducing him to Kreacher. Draco had seen the sparse sprinkling of dark hair trailing downwards from his navel, the sharp ridge of his collarbones, and when Potter had turned to leave with a soft chuckle, Draco had spotted the pale, gruesome looking scars on Potter’s left hip, half hidden under the towel.
Harry didn’t answer at once, watching him carefully. “Hogwarts,” he said at last, giving shape to the half-formed plan Ginny and he had put together.
He’d known their first time would be significant, would feel meaningful, and when Harry lays him down on the edge of his bed and finally breaks the kiss, Draco knows with one look at Harry, with not a single spoken word exchanged, that
to settle on him,” I point out, the now familiar helplessness bubbling up my throat, burning its way through me.
“You could just go by the kind of robes he already has,” Malfoy says dryly, raising an eyebrow. “Or you could just
” I ask incredulously as I catch the bundle of black, unwilling to admit that Draco looks fucking fantastic in his (what had to be uncomfortably) tight leather trousers and snug white t-shirt. His hair is carefully styled in that soft, artfully tousled mess and his eyes shine excitedly.
“Yes, as a matter of fact,” Malfoy shoots back airily with a mirthless smile of his own. “You see, Father, I’m—”
“What’s wrong?” Harry demands breathlessly, hopping off his broom before he’s even landed fully. “What the fuck happened?”
Two men stand side by side in the photograph on the other side, the one on the left bearing such a stark resemblance to Potter that Draco does a double take. He has the same jet black, chaotic pile of hair, the same square jaw and that familiar, unexpectedly handsome grin that Draco’s become rather
He’s wearing robes this time instead of the dull grey trousers and button down shirt he’d been wearing the previous day at breakfast. The hems of his robes are slightly dirty and the cuffs are visibly frayed but Malfoy holds himself with all the characteristic haughtiness that one would expect to see in him. His hair is still dry and dull looking but has been combed back into a ponytail much neater than last time. He looks pale and sunken-cheeked, eyes large and round in his narrow face and his jaw is clenched tightly, lip curled, nose high.
And despite all this, despite the apparent bone-weariness, the obvious lack of energy, there is not a shred of vulnerability in the man as he stands there and glares, his nostrils flaring as he openly scents Draco, and Draco takes another careful step away from him and his, frankly,
“What—what do you think you’re doing?” Draco blurts when several seconds later, neither of them have spoken and Potter’s face, barely two inches away from Draco’s, is still flat and sour.
Potter buries his face in Draco’s napkin with a small burp, shaking his head. “No, then I end up skipping breakfast altogether,” he croaks, eyes watering slightly. “And then
“Well, Potter. You look about the same since I last saw you – except for that giant wart on your nose that you’re growing.”
I stare at the scene in front of me; the dissonance makes me want to burst out into mirthless, slightly hysterical laughter.
But Harry wasn’t about to give up on the idea; after he’d left Malfoy’s decrepit place that evening, despair and sympathy bubbling up inside him, he wondered rather wildly if he ought to just go back and simply throw Malfoy over his shoulder and bring him to Grimmauld, kicking and screaming.
in a way he’d assumed he’d never feel again, and by the time he’d walked up to Malfoy, lounging carelessly against a pillar, Harry had stopped thinking.
“That’s on them, not you,” Draco says grimly. “You do so much, love. You try so fucking hard, but you can’t always be in control of the situation, you
He’s just leaving, walking past the little service and enquiry kiosk, when the sight of what is probably the ugliest house-elf he’s ever seen makes him slow down a step, glaring at it in bewilderment – it’s horrifically old, has sagging, greyish skin, and enormous bluish eyes that are spotted grey with age. It’s wearing a clean white toga, tufts of fluffy, white hair protruding out its ears, and throws Draco a curiously interested look as he passes by before suddenly lowering into a bow.
“Because you’ve warded your Floo, you arse.” I take in the sight of him in his stupid poncy black dressing gown with some sort of bright blue gunk all over his face and burst into a loud hoot of laughter. “Did a Crumple Horned Snorkack shit on your face?”
“Thank you, that’d be nice,” he says lightly, tipping his head with an awkward smile. “Where are we going?”
I laugh out loud at the expression on his face and then wince as one thin hand curls firmly in my hair and tugs sharply.
Sure enough, when I pull the door open, he nearly tumbles over inside, landing half on me and catching himself with his other hand on the door frame. He straightens up and sways dangerously. His eyes are bloodshot and pink but he’s paler than ever as he stands there trembling, glaring at me. His hair is in disarray and he smells very strongly of alcohol.
kid,” Malfoy sneers, “as much as you’d like me to turn out to be some slag who goes about with his arse on offer to be fucked—”
backwards, flying off the bed so violently that he ends up slamming the back of his head into the wall opposite the bed. Malfoy shrieks, scrambling up, endless arms and legs flailing about wildly, pale hair mussed beyond recognition. He sits up in a kneel, looking around the room as though expecting to be violently attacked, before glaring at Harry with irritated incredulity.
“No, but Dudley usually let me have any fruit-flavoured candy he got.” Harry grins. “He hated them. I had my fun, Malfoy, don’t worry.”
“Thank you for your insight, you giant orang-utan,” Draco grits, his hands clenched around the edge of his desk. He did not need Weasley to come and sound out the very thought that’s been bouncing around inside Draco’s head for over a week – how
Crumpling under the pain, much to Malfoy’s bewilderment, the bloke disappears within seconds. Thankfully, Malfoy immediately winds his way back to Harry, sweaty and out of breath.
There’s an odd, quiet buzzing inside his head as he heads downstairs, his mind curiously devoid of thought. He can’t think of a single thing to focus upon and give thought to, as one would expect to be doing after they spent a night in the secluded company of their lover in his werewolf form.
“Malfoy,” Harry leaps up, wrapping a hand around Malfoy’s wrist and giving him a little shake, “Stop yelling. Sit your arse down and tell us what the hell is going on.”
“What do you think, Malfoy?” Harry licked his own suddenly completely dry lips. “Give yourself one finger.” There was a brief clatter as Malfoy did something. Harry frowned. “What’re you doing?”
“What for?” Draco asks, equally softly, as he makes his way over to him, slow and unimposing as he approaches and then sinks down beside him, sitting sideways with one knee on the sofa so he can face Harry.
Slapping his cockhead against Potter’s arsehole a few times, Draco considers in silence, his vision doubling before him as he waits. Potter holds very still and Draco can hear his own heart thumping in his ears, his mouth dry and his breath slightly choppy. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, not really, but he resents Potter for how well he had fucked Draco a week ago and he wants to
“Harry, the baby is going to be fine,” Ron cuts in abruptly. He’s sitting up now, elbows on his knees, fingers laced before him as he looks earnestly at Harry. “It’s
Scowling, Harry crooked one finger through the lube, leaned forward and prodded his finger at the little hole, wiggling the tip inside and pausing at Malfoy’s quick inhale.
?” Potter asks in delight, scooping Caesar up and bringing him up to his face to bump his nose against the cat’s.
Bouncing slightly with a yelp, Draco scrambled up to attack Harry’s pants, pulling them down and after a bit of a struggle, dragging them completely off Harry’s long legs, running his hands back up the length of them, feeling the fine black hair part under his fingers, to wrap one hand carefully around Harry’s erection and using the other to drag Harry forward atop himself.
“I did it,” he whispers tremulously, and Draco’s chest aches. “I didn’t notice if mine’s bigger?” Harry says quickly, clearly trying to yank himself together; his chest heaves as he stares after his Patronus in disbelief, and he appears on the verge of tears.
It’s a single, seemingly unending slide into Draco that has him lifting off the sheets until he’s quivering under Potter with just his shoulders pressed to the bed, gasping shrilly against Potter’s shoulder as he curses through grit teeth into Draco’s hair. He’s pressed so deeply into Draco that Draco can feel the edge of Potter’s hip bones pressed up against his arse cheeks, can feel every twitch of his cock inside him.
“Harry, what the fuck is going on with you tonight?” He doesn’t sound angry – just bewildered. And a tiny bit like he wants to laugh at me.
“Beats me,” he throws his hands up and comes to sit cross legged by my feet. “He says he doesn’t want things to move too fast.”
Harry woke with a slight start to realise he’s being prodded and poked at; cool fingers gently pressed into his right flank and Madam Pomfrey nodded to herself.
For the enth time since they’d come back to Hogwarts, Draco notices how Potter appears to have not changed a smidge since the War while simultaneously seeming like a new person altogether. He still wears his hair rumpled and mussed up, still dresses carelessly and slightly sloppily, still flies a broom like he was born to; but there’s also something startlingly
“I’m not very fond of this holiday, Malfoy.” Harry hesitates before going on. “My parents were killed Halloween night, so...” Malfoy pales so fast that Harry instantly regrets bringing it up.
,” he replies sardonically. “There’s much to say about the quality of life after you’ve been bitten by a fucking werewolf. I throw a little one-man party monthly; you just missed this month’s. It was last night. Truly memorable.”
The dementors, as one, began to glide away, back out the kitchen door, the one carrying Lily bringing up the rear, Lily’s body flailing weakly as she tried to wriggle free.
But then he floats back down into a puddle of his own semen, blinking stupidly at nothing before Potter heaves him onto his back and knocks his knees wide open.
Draco tries to speak for several seconds but only manages to produce odd, choking noises. “He— It was all very nice,” Draco finally murmurs, mind still blank with shock. “I mean...private table out in the balcony with a view over the Seine, the floating lights and the...” he trails off, face scorching hot as Granger merely watches him in meaningful silence. “He told me it was you.”
Draco rolls his eyes, pursing his lips over a smile. “No,” he deadpans. “I can’t. It’s not as though it’s literally happening inside me or anything.”
He packed the trunks and carefully slipped them into his pockets which he had laced with Undetectable Extension charms. When he huddled the children together, still mud-streaked and grubby, he felt a hollow emptiness inside him; he was voluntarily bringing his children back to the place of danger they had barely managed to escape from not twelve hours ago. But he knew James was right; and there was no way he’d ever manage to leave England without at least
And so he’d just found himself sitting quietly on the low wall that ringed the oval courtyard, as people had scooped up the scant bit of snow that had collected on the ground, and was basically just sludgy mulch at this point, and thrown it at each other, hooting and howling like a bunch of boorish kerns. Finnigan had climbed into the frozen fountain in the centre of the courtyard, slipping and sliding on the ice, to poke at the marble centaur’s gonads, and upon being dared to lick the bulbous carving (by his own boyfriend, no less) proceeded to get his tongue stuck on the centaur’s balls.
Finally lifting his lips off Draco with a noisy little suck, Potter nuzzles Draco’s cheek, murmuring, “Ugh,
Harry’s hard, warm body simply presses closer, his breath playing across Draco’s face. “Lots of people are stupid together,” he says softly. “It’s all part of being happy.”
But Malfoy doesn’t look. He stumbles back a step, shoving one arm into his shirt sleeve, either not noticing or not caring that the garment is inside out. He throws Harry another frightened look as he backs away. “I don’t know if it’s the effect of some brain injury you suffered, Potter, but I know a lunatic when I see one and I’m not going to wait around to confirm whether I’m right.”
in that club – luminous skin and ridiculously shiny hair, lips berry-pink and moist, eyes sparkling with vitality.
Ron chokes a bit on his rice but assiduously continues to scoop more into his mouth, his cheeks bulging. Hermione is straight-faced, fingers laced in front of her.
Malfoy’s lip curls. “As much as I’d have loved to come here and be humiliated, I chose not to risk whatever self-respect I have remaining. Besides, it’s a pretty accurate diagnosis, isn’t it?” Malfoy nods towards the scrap of parchment again.
“Okay, well, I’ll give you these for the time being, and you can come back if you think you need something more to keep you up and running through the day,” she nods, “This is for your nausea, by the way, just a basic anti-nausea,” she points to the second, blue glass bottle.
“What?” Malfoy asks impatiently, looking more and more frustrated with each passing second. “Potter, what are you--?” he breaks off, sighing and running a hand through his hair, “Shit, I knew there’d be
“Wh-what?” he whispers at last, looking very much like he’s fervently praying he’d misheard Harry. “What did you just say?”
Simon buys his mother the most unremarkable pair of earrings in the store. I don’t claim to have impeccable taste in women’s jewellery – that’s something only Draco can boast about – but fuck, the pearl and garnet earrings Simon’s picked out for his mother makes me feel slightly sorry for the woman.
His body turns soft beneath mine as I slide off him just enough to tuck him against my side and tangle our legs together. When I pull back to look at him, cupping his cheek with one hand, he looks back at me with stars in his eyes, biting his kiss-swollen lip.
His head hurt so bad he couldn’t think. His mind was simple white noise. His whole body burned as though he had jumped into an ice bath. His ankle hurt so bad he felt like he might piss himself from the pain.
Scorpius’ face fell, a small frown of helpless sadness creasing his round face. “I... I think not, Mr. Potter. We... We don’t know where she is, you see.”
Malfoy storms into his room and slams the door hard enough to make the framed painting of a haughty looking witch rattle from side to side. She clutches at her pearls and then shoots Harry a glare. Harry gives her a flat stare and then slowly turns to look at where Malfoy disappeared behind that door.
By the time they finally part and Harry drags him out of the crowd, the rest of their party has arrived, looking around for the both of them. They all spend the evening gathered around the single booth they manage to commandeer and Harry has plenty of time to think about the kiss – and what it might turn into once they’re home.
“It’ll only provide temporary relief, Auror Potter, and we must warn that it’s an incredibly painful, not to mention inva--”
Swallowing, Draco gathers what little bravado lingers in him. “I...don’t care who—who you fuck,” he breathes, punctuating it by digging his nails into Potter’s soft nape.
Draco’s blush only intensifies as he brings his hair over his shoulder and stares at it in bafflement. “It doesn’t sparkle?” he says, perplexed.
“So, I can stare at you?” Potter’s voice is rich and low, eyes gleaming with something that makes Draco’s heart trip.
“Fuck you, I asked first,” Draco snaps, not even embarrassed at the childish retort. When Harry just snorts and looks away again, Draco takes a step forward and snaps his fingers under Harry’s nose again. “Do. You. Regret. Fucking me, Potter?”
“Malfoy,” Harry gets to his feet, raking a hand through his hair as he approaches him carefully, “Look, we’re...we’re sort of stuck together now, yeah? We don’t have to discuss the details of it right away but, fuck, we
I kiss him now, deep and slow, coaxing his mouth open and gently sucking his bottom lip between both my own. He makes a soft sound that’s more of an exhale. Gently tugging on my upper lip, he tilts his head and presses closer, one hand creeping into my hair. I cradle his head with one hand and kiss him properly, tongue and all, walking him backwards until I have him pinned to the doorjamb. He’s silent as he lets me, silent as he kisses me right back, eager and hungry and slightly desperate.
Tossing his head from side to side in time with the beat, Malfoy sways his hips, eyes lightly closed. Undulating against the stranger, Malfoy slowly sinks onto his haunches, pushing his arse out against the man as he smoothly rises back up, before immediately being dragged backwards, even closer, so the man can nose at Malfoy’s sweat-shiny throat.
The piece of fried potato crumbles against my front teeth as he determinedly tries to slip the chip past them and into my mouth. I sigh, accepting it and chewing slowly, not really tasting anything as I try not to watch the way he once again slowly licks his fingers clean.
“You’re the same age,” Draco points out, trying very hard not to roll his eyes. “We all are. And Granger, what happened was most certainly unfortunate – and that it happened to a model of virtuosity like Potter himself, even more so. But Granger, this isn’t the 70’s anymore.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and crossed his arms across his chest, his cloak cocooning him as he did so. Harry caught a glimpse of something gleaming under it.
“Cool!” James bounded forward, Albus right behind him. The three boys began horsing around, yelling out random words and laughing as their voices were echoed back at them. Harry set Lily down and she just stood there, clutching at Harry’s jeans and watching the boys with wide eyes.
She stirred, her fingers curling into Harry’s t-shirt as she blinked open wide green eyes and slowly looked up at him.
“That would be—thank you,” Mafoy mumbled, managing to yank one button free. “Just wait until I get it off though.”
A loud, crashing sound of something hitting the floor makes Draco scramble out of bed and snatch up his wand. The sound seemed to have come from the kitchen, from where he can now hear muffled cursing.
Malfoy looks flustered and angry again by the time Harry finishes, glaring at him with his lip curled. “Typical,” he hisses. “So what are you going to do about all that, Potter? Repair the whole building? Infuse it with some of your own excessive magic, perhaps? Obliterate Knockturn in its entirety?” His eyes flash for a moment before he sets his mug down. “Or perhaps you’ll throw me a bag of Galleons if I just got on my knees for you? Bent over for you, maybe?”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Malfoy eyes go round, “I didn’t realise this place was reserved only for Golden Prats.”
Harry glared right back before shrugging exaggeratedly. “Fine,” he said without looking at him, using the remaining lube on his left hand to roughly coat his cock, shivering at his own touch. He then shuffled forward on his knees, leaning down to brace himself on one hand before pausing. “Like this?” he confirmed, one eyebrow raised, his heart feeling like it was about to explode inside him.
Instead he goes home, ignoring the pit in his stomach, he showers, not paying any heed to the slight tightness in his throat, he makes some pasta, which he puts away in the refrigerator uneaten, and then he starts on the month’s batch of Wolfsbane, all the while pretending he isn’t completely desperate to go be with Harry.
, that Potter was well endowed, but that does not stop Draco from shamelessly ogling Potter’s massive,
Something flickers across Potter’s face for a brief second and he looks mildly horrified with himself. “We can meet elsewhere,” he says quickly.
Malfoy was still standing where he’d been and so Harry simply trudged on. The farther he walked, and the longer his solitude persisted, the stronger the mental images of Ginny’s limp form became. Vision blurring again, Harry blindly walked towards nowhere, tears dripping off his chin, ankle throbbing, mind whirring.
Draco swallows, nodding once before running his thumb below Harry’s eye. “Are—are you hungry? D’you want coffee, maybe?”
, Potter!” he shouts, turning and flinging his wand onto the sofa. He’s sweating profusely and his robes feel heavy and stifling and so Draco angrily tears them off over his head and flings those aside too, concluding his strop with a kick to the wall.
I’ve blurted it out before I can stop myself and Draco wryly lifts an eyebrow, lips curling into a small smirk, making my gut clench in an odd manner.
