explained. "It's long enough that we've been unnecessarily rude to each other, hasn't it?"
was fussy.
"What?" Harry asked, clearly having noticed Draco glaring at his plate.
Potter.
The more Draco interacted with Harry, the easier he found the task became. Of course, it was nearly always awkward at first, but then the two would fall into a rhythm that made it difficult for anyone to remember a time where the two had hated one another. Draco even found himself becoming friends with Neville and Luna--his wife, now. Granger and Weasley visited Harry every now and then, but Draco was rarely around or available when they were there, and Harry thought that it was only partially due to a mismanaged workload involved with grading his students' assignments. Nevertheless, each interaction became less awkward and more warm, and before long, it was wintertime.
, needing to get to bathing and styling his hair if he had any chance of being there early, or at the very least, on time.
He groaned at the thought as well as the idea of leaving his nice, warm bed, but Draco knew that if he didn't get up sometime soon, he would delay the inevitable until he was late for breakfast, and that simply wouldn't do. He couldn't let himself become a bad example for his students, now, could he?
"And mine was just eggs," Harry responded, pointedly ignoring Draco's argument.
"Pardon me?" Draco asked, not expecting Potter to say something so quickly. He couldn't have been lost in his own thoughts for that long, could he?
After a moment's pause, he coughed into his fist to clear his head before responding. "And to you," He hesitated, unaware of how to continue now that their dynamic had been upset. Should he still call him 'Potter,' or would that only upset him and cause every interaction between the pair to be unbearably uncomfortable from then on? Or did it not matter at all? There was no way of knowing, and Draco hated not knowing how to respond in a social situation.
When Potter jumped out of Hagrid's arms, to say Draco was surprised was an understatement.
"Call me Harry, now." Potter-no,
The triumphant grin that spread across his companion's face was only slightly irritating now, and wholly because it was at Draco's expense. Despite it all, though, the man was glad Harry had backed him into a corner on this. He wouldn't be spending Christmas alone again after all. Draco was glad his father was atoning for the sins he had committed, it still felt strange celebrating just with his mother, and the screaming matches the night always devolved into weren't good for his health or his mother's. At least, this way, he was able to have a chance at a real, happy holiday for the first time in a long time.
"Nope, I insist," Harry interrupted, placing a warm hand on Draco's shoulder. "If I won't convince you, I'm sure Hermione will."
"You're terrible," The bespectacled man replied, but Draco knew he didn't really mean it, as he had the dopiest looking grin on his face and was shaking his head fondly.
"If you two are quite finished, Professors Malfoy and Potter, I would like to begin this morning's announcements," Headmaster McGonagall's voice echoed throughout the hall, and both men turned interesting shades of rose and cherry as they noticed nearly the whole hall had been watching and listening to their discussion attentively.
"Draco is staying at Hogwarts for Christmas."
"Isn't it?!" She asked, completely misinterpreting his tone and clearly not knowing the history between the two men, before continuing. "I can't believe he actually accepted after Professor Moran resigned nearly a quarter through the year!" She then turned to her friend, a Ravenclaw. "Can you really believe it? Being taught Defense Against the Dark Arts by Harry Potter himself? It's like learning runes from Merlin!"
The moment his fingertips touched the polished wood of his chair, Harry seemed to sense his silent presence and turned to face him, vibrant green eyes still shining with mirth from whatever joke had been shared between the two of them, and a large grin pulling at the corners of his mouth. His tan skin was absolutely radiant, and his thick curls bounced with every chuckle that forced its way out of him despite his clear wish to start the conversation off properly.
Draco nearly cackled at that, remembering when Hermione had threatened Draco with a particularly sharp fork after he'd said something along the lines of how he was undeserving of her forgiveness after all he'd said to her. The woman was a force of nature when she wanted to be, especially with the extra hormones in her system because of Baby Rose.
So, Draco turned tail and ran, and he never talked to the man again. At least, not until today.
Ah, yes. Teddy. He was with Gran-
Harry's family? Had he actually married the Weaslette-no,
The blonde man sighed. "Harry, really, it's not a problem-"
"And what's wrong porridge?" Draco shot back, taking a spoonful of his own breakfast and consuming it to make a point, wholly unexpecting the gag from Harry in response, causing him to lose control of his faculties for a moment and
better," Harry punctuated this by shoveling a heaping forkful of the red and yellow mush into his mouth, causing Draco to gag slightly and look the other way. Harry chuckled a second time before swallowing the horrid stuff. "I usually make my own at home, with cheese and better seasoning, but here it seems the traditional route is used, which is... not my favorite, but better than porridge."
That was not what he needed to focus on, though. What Draco needed to focus on was how he planned on working in close quarters with Potter for the first time since the rebuilding of Hogwarts. The two of them had been on the same team for volunteer restoration work after Harry convinced the Ministry that Draco really was not a threat, seeing as he saved Harry's life by offering him his wand, for Merlin's sake. Draco was thankful for that, he really was, but how was he expected to respond to it? How could a single action change every interaction which followed, just like that? How was Potter able to forget years of torment, ridicule, and pain and treat Draco... like he wasn't Draco, just like that? It was very uncharacteristic and caused Draco a great amount of anxiety because, for once in his life, he had no idea what to expect of the Gryffindor, and that terrified him.
"Oh I see." Aria couldn't help laughing as she turned to face him, giving him a saccharinely sweet smile. "Would you like me to carry you then, Princess? That way the big bad dirty
Morag were already gone, their beds already made up, while even Hannah was already finishing up with putting on her uniform.
"Isn't that a bit archaic? Do families still arrange marriages for their children nowadays?"
Aria opened her eyes as Draco slowly pulled away, and he stared worriedly at her for a long time, obviously waiting for her reaction. With a smile, she reached up and wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him back down so that she could whisper something into his ear.
"Use this! Make her snap out of it!"
He cut off her indignant sputters with another kiss, and she let him push her down onto her back. She wrapped her arms around his back as he moved his lips down, humming as he kissed a trail down her neck, past the valley between her breasts, all the way down to her bellybutton. She giggled when he suddenly blew a raspberry against her stomach, and Draco chuckled as he looked up, meeting her mildly annoyed look with a smile.
have to sit with our new houses, okay? I don't want the Headmistress to think we're disrespecting her efforts."
Fortunately, they spent the remainder of the evening in relative silence after Pansy's little outburst, broken only by the occasional loud 'thuds' from the impressive stack of thick books that Morag was currently lifting from her trunk and arranging on the desk beside her bed.
"Malfoy, don't be so melodramatic. Are you
Aria nodded slowly.
He lifted his gaze and stared directly into Aria's wide eyes, and he noticed for the first time that they weren't blank anymore. Unlike the vacant expression Draco had seen on her face when Bentley had first cast the Feather Curse, Aria's eyes looked
"You like Luna?" She croaked out.
Zach, Aria immediately froze up and felt herself go into a mini panic attack.
Fleur smiled at them and stood up, walking back over to stand in front of the blackboard.
Embarrassed at having been caught sleeping, Aria had turned to look helplessly at Hermione across the room but unfortunately, her best friend was sitting with the Ravenclaws and was too far away to coach her the answer like she usually did.
As if Potter needed any more of a reason to inflate her ego, we have idiots like these practically worshiping the ground she walks on." Pansy muttered bitterly to herself, slinking back against her seat.
As soon as she was gone and they heard the sound of the girls' dormitory doors slamming shut, Zach snickered under his breath and turned to give Hannah a sardonic smirk.
Fisher howled in pain and immediately recoiled, shoving Pansy away as he stumbled to his knees and clutched at his eyes. As Pansy ran behind Blaise, Draco walked over to Fisher's blind, kneeling form. He scoffed loudly and kicked him hard on the stomach, causing Fisher to wince and stumble to the ground.
To her surprise, McGonagall just gave her a weary look and adjusted her spectacles onto the bridge of her nose. When she didn't say anything, Aria shared a look with Corey from the corner of her eye, meeting his anxious grimace with a small, reassuring grin.
They sneered venomously at each other before Blaise cleared his throat again, breaking them out of their trance.
"No!"
spot and Aria gasped again, trying move away from him, Draco tightened his grip on her and turned her slightly to the side so he could see.
"As I mentioned, an unmated veela, after being rejected by her chosen mate, would sometimes cut off her own wings. By doing this, it is like she 'forces' a mate-bond with herself, severing the connection to the one who rejected her. By cutting off her own wings, a veela 'frees herself' and becomes her own 'mate', so to speak." Fleur added quietly.
After a few more minutes, another eager hand shot up into the air and Fleur nodded, gesturing for Susan Bones to speak.
"I'm fine." Draco cut her off sharply, refusing to meet her gaze.
"Bentley, stop this." She let out an irritated sigh. "We both know your magic levels aren't anywhere near mine, so dueling me would be pointless."
"I'll make this as quick and concise as I can, Miss Potter." She sat down onto the chair across Aria's bed and crossed her arms over her chest, tapping her perfectly manicured fingernails against the sleeves of her blazer. "The reason I've been sent here today, is because — in light of recent events — the veela community wants me to convince you to officially press assault charges against Bentley Fisher."
He was a little surprised to see Morag standing behind him, the petite girl shifting her weight from one foot to the other as she waited for him to turn around fully to face her.
. When their gazes finally met and she found herself staring directly into his gray eyes, she felt dizzy; and her heart began pounding so rapidly in her chest that she found it hard to breathe.
"She'll love it."
Sure enough, by lunchtime, even Slughorn, Flitwick, and some of the other teachers were laughing when they noticed that all of the students from Hufflepuff were walking backwards along the corridors as they made their way to and from their respective classrooms.
"My mother told me her own version of that night. She said that it all happened very fast; that the Dark Lord—" Draco choked up, his heart still clenching with fear at the mere mention of the evil wizard he had once been forced to serve. "—hit you with the Killing Curse and you just
"Instructor?"
The first thing Aria realized on the morning of her first day of school was that,
"That's my fault." Draco winced in guilt as he forced himself back up to his feet, swaying a little and grabbing onto Blaise for balance. "I wrote Aria's veela name down when I was still trying to find out about her secret, and that son of a bitch must have...I don't know, gotten access to it somehow."
He didn't notice that Aria had seen him — probably because he wasn't even staring directly at her, almost as though he was afraid that she would lash out at him if she noticed that he was there.
"I don't really get cold that easily."
A light, jazzy melody was playing as Draco followed Blaise and Astoria and led Luna to the dance floor. Thankfully, Luna wasn't as completely inept at dancing as Draco expected, and after a few minutes, they set themselves into an easy waltz. As they danced, an unwelcome image suddenly flashed in Draco's head — that of Luna Lovegood, half-starved and bound up as a prisoner in the basement of Malfoy Manor — and Draco immediately stiffened, clenching his jaw at the memory.
"No, I used the flat end of the knife handle. Like it says in the instructions." Greg answered reassuringly, gesturing to his open textbook on the counter.
And not just any veela, apparently.
"It wasn't exactly easy, believe me." Draco admitted ruefully, smirking to himself and shaking his head. "I've been mulling all of this over in my head for more than a week now."
Aria smirked to herself at that, having heard Hermione's little comment.
Aria was seething as she accepted his hand and used it to pull herself up from her seat. Ignoring the questioning looks she was receiving from Ron and Neville, she reluctantly began shoving her books back into her bag.
"Well then…I guess we're partners?" She began with a nervous laugh.
"No, you're right.
A couple of things:
It was an incredibly intimate feeling, and it gave him such a rush of masculine glee to know that he was the first person (and
It all felt too good, and her entire body felt as though it was on fire.
careful not to touch him or get too close; how she never took off her gloves, how she had looked so interested when she asked him about his anti-bewitchment ring and even how nearly every idiot male within a ten-foot radius of her would be staring dazedly at her every ten minutes.
I did it! If it makes any difference, I wasn't planning to use it against you anymore! And before that incident at the Yule Ball, I was actually planning to give it back to you."
would take advantage of a situation like that." Aria drawled, rolling her eyes at him. "Why don't you do your own homework? I mean, as nice as Goyle is, he's not exactly a model student in History." She pointed out.
"What?" Pansy glared icily at him, looking annoyed at having been disturbed from her meal.
Shaking her head at the thought, Aria took that moment to glance curiously around the dormitory, noting with mild surprise that, unlike the dorm rooms in Gryffindor tower, the rooms down in the dungeons were much bigger than she expected.
"It is quite simple." Fleur answered her with a smile and wink. "An unmated veela is able to sense who her 'compatible mates' are through
She recognized the male voice instantly, her muscles tensing and her hand automatically hovering near the pocket of her robes where she knew her wand was tucked away. Slowly, she turned around and met Bentley Fisher's wide smile with a cautious incline of her head.
They never actually made it to breakfast after that; so a few hours later, the two of them ended up having a late brunch together in the kitchens.
He growled and reached for her again, snatching her wrist and using his grip to yank her closer. When she gasped and fell against him, Draco locked his other arm around her waist, trapping her in place.
Aria's lips twitched upwards into a grin as she glanced at something over his shoulder, prompting Draco to follow her gaze. His eyebrows arched up in surprise when he saw a smiling Narcissa and Andromeda hurriedly making their way towards them. Andromeda was holding a squirming pink-haired Teddy in her arms and as soon as the trio reached them, Teddy squealed and held his hands out to Aria, who giggled and lifted him up into her arms.
Blaise held up his wand and cast a protego over himself just before Fisher flung a hex at him. The spell shattered Blaise's shield, but before Blaise could retaliate, Fisher disappeared again and this time, he reappeared directly behind Pansy.
a saint." Aria couldn't help the harsh, mocking laugh that escaped her at Pansy's words.
Ignoring the gushing looks and shy waves he received from most of the girls in the room (including Pansy and Granger, apparently), Wood sat down, cross-legged onto the table and peered at them with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
A few seconds later, a tall, slender blonde strode cheerfully into the room, her heels clacking loudly against the polished, wooden floors.
Granger frowned at him, clearly not satisfied with his explanation.
"Do you want to go around them?" She teased.

Aria's eyes glazed over at his touch and the creamy skin along her face where his fingers had grazed seemed to
"Did you just
The awkward silence seemed to hang over the room for a few agonizing seconds before Blaise finally put them out of their misery and spoke up, flashing them a small grin and gesturing to the empty seats.
"My books, Corey." Draco answered sharply, narrowing his eyes at his reaction. "Were you going through them? Because you should know that's rude. You're not supposed to snoop around in other people's stuff." He snapped, grabbing his notebook and immediately leafing through it to make sure the parchment containing Aria's veela name, along with all of his important notes on Ancient Veelish, were still intact.
"He's been placed in a temporary holding cell in the Ministry until they decide what the proper charges are to be filed against him." Hermione told her.
"Get off, you pervert!"
"Sorry, kid." She walked over to one of the empty chairs by the windows and sat down, patting the one beside it. "I hate the thought of studying on a Saturday morning as much as you do but I promised your sister that I'd help you improve your grades. Don't worry though. I'll try to make things as interesting as I can." She told him.
"Estelle's right, you know. I'm thinking even big celebrities like Harriah Potter have a time limit. You take too long and she just might decide not to wait anymore. I should know. My wife almost left me because I took too long to propose to her." He told him, nodding solemnly.
He didn't protest when she began leading him to the large kitchen adjacent to the living area. Aria went straight to the refrigerator and took out a half empty bottle of wine, pouring it into two glasses and handing one of them to Draco.
"Granger brought him to the Headmistress' office a few minutes ago." He answered. "Why?"
All Aria knew was that, veela or not, she loved Draco.
"Please don't bother elaborating on that." She deadpanned.
"Who did what? What are you talking about?" Draco asked again, his voice clipped with impatience. "Try to calm down and tell me what actually happened."
"How long was I out?" She asked.
Sure enough, when Draco managed to find a seat in the middle of all the spectators and reporters around him, he looked up and saw an uncomfortable-looking Aria (in her true form, with her hair up and her wings out) seated at the very middle of a long table that had been placed on a small, elevated platform in front of the Ministry fountain. There were a couple of older-looking veela women (also in their true forms) seated at the table on either side of her; and judging from their uniforms, Draco could only guess that they were all representatives from the Veela Affairs Department of the Ministry. Blaise's mother, Ilyana Zabini (the only veela at the table who didn't have any wings) was seated on Aria's right. She was currently instructing the group of Aurors standing in front of the crowd to keep the reporters a safe distance away from the platform.
"It's too sweet." He deadpanned. "I don't like it—"
age would be married by now — probably already expecting their first child. What exactly are you waiting for anyway?"
." Bentley's eyes gleamed as he laughed and gave her a knowing smile. "He's the one who wrote down your veela name, after all."
She smirked at the squeak that left his lips and pressed herself closer, forcing more intimate contact between their bodies. When he shivered, she leaned down, tracing her lips gently against the side of his flushed face so she could whisper directly into his ear.
in this entire world
I have!" Hannah snapped back at her, scowling.
"No, don't apologize." Greg shook his head; and Aria guessed from the pensive look on his face that he was probably trying to gather his thoughts. "I'm sorry for everything I did to you and your friends during the war. And even before that, actually."
"How do you mean?" Morag asked again, looking confused.
"You're sure?" Corey asked again, staring uncertainly at the broomstick in his hand.
Fleur gave him an exasperated look. "As mentioned, the Feather Curse only works on
"Well, you're in luck, Potter." Draco gave her a haughty smile and spoke up in a deliberately arrogant voice to lighten the mood. "Architecture happens to be a particular hobby of mine, so I can help you assess if your flat is ready." He drawled.
Having grown somewhat accustomed to dealing with the press that summer, Aria was careful to keep her expression completely neutral as she entered the Great Hall that morning.
bother him, however, was the fact that everyone seemed to look at him as though he was some crazed murderer who was likely to just randomly cast the killing curse on someone on the street without so much as batting an eyelash.
"Before I dismiss you, Headmistress McGonagall instructed me to inform you all about your assignment for the next topic. You are to research on

"You have to know that I didn't make you my mate that night just because I wanted to save your life. It was so much more than that. I—"
Both Ron and Hermione blinked and stared at him in surprise. After a long moment, the stunned expression on Hermione's face slowly melted away.
2. I know the NEWTs are usually held somewhere from May to June. But I changed it in this story. Just presume the war effed up the schedule this year.
"You should see the Hufflepuff Common Room then." Smith snorted, leaning back against his seat and taking another sip from his beer. "Bloody chaos
to follow Madam Pomfrey's instructions anyway), Aria reluctantly leaned back against the pillows of her bed and slowly began to untwist her hair from its braid. Then, she took a long inhale of breath and closed her eyes. There was a brief, albeit very bright yellowish glow that wrapped around her entire form, causing Madam Pomfrey, Ron and Hermione to shield their eyes for a few seconds before the light instantly faded and all three of them opened their eyes again.
She reeled back, startled when Bentley Fisher smiled slowly at her, a strange, unsettling look gleaming in his wide eyes. When he noticed the way Aria was frowning at him, he lowered his gaze and eventually looked away, but not before giving her another weird look.
Draco flushed and immediately tried to step back to lengthen the distance between them but she leaned in even closer, tiptoeing her feet up until her lips were dangerously close to his ear. His breath hitched, and alarm bells started going off in his head at her nearness, but still, the sweet scent of her hair drew him closer; close enough so that he was all too aware of the inviting heat emanating from her body.

Aria felt her cheeks reddening with mortification.

"Like no one expected
She snatched Aria by her wrist and whisked her away from the crowd of reporters that had managed to accost her just as she was coming back from the bathroom. They made it to a secluded corner of the Hall, far outside the hearing range of anyone else; and Pansy finally turned around and blurted out in a shaky voice.
Aria shrugged and gave him a small grin. "Then yes, I reckon that looks okay. I think you can go ahead and add it to the mixture already. I'll get the strainer ready." She told him.
At this point, Draco's vision had gone completely hazy with allure-induced lust and he realized he couldn't think clearly anymore.
For a second, Draco thought that Pansy was actually going to tell Aria off, but when she eventually spoke; the words that came out of her mouth did not at all match the resentful scowl on her face.
"Ugh, right…Maid of Honor." Aria made a face and pretended to gag at Hermione's words. "Do I really have to, Hermione? Can't you ask Ginny or Luna to do it?" She complained.
She placed her hands on his chest to steady herself and immediately stilled her movements as her orgasm came rushing forward, coursing through her entire body and causing her to scream. She bent her head back and arched her spine backward, frantically flapping her wings high up into the air as she lost herself to wave after wave of mind-numbing pleasure. When it was over and the haziness in her mind slowly began to clear, she finally noticed that Draco's painful grip had slackened around her waist. She glanced down, noting that he was still coming down from his own post-orgasm high.
remember." Zach admitted, his cheeks flushing slightly. "I just wasn't sure
Aria turned to look at the blond Slytherin, noting how her former rival suddenly looked as though he had swallowed something nasty and was on the verge of throwing it back up. When Draco noticed that everyone was staring expectantly at him, he downed the rest of his drink in a single gulp and shoved his empty glass towards Blaise.
“Yeah, I don’t go out on my own much anymore.  This is my mate Draco, Draco this is my cousin Dudley.”  The men only nodded to each other at the introduction.
“You know who I am?”  He asked softly, as a blush crept up his cheeks. I figured I was way off your radar.”
“This is to go no further than this room, it hasn’t been announced yet.”  Harry said after taking a bite of his food.  “We plan on living in the muggle area when not at the school.  Fewer people judge either of us there.  We grew quite used to nobody paying us any attention for who we are aside from a few random homophobes.”
“Not yet.  It’s a new mark, it takes awhile for the pheromones to change.  Right now he reads as unmated until you see the bite.  Unfortunately, some people don’t even care if an omega is bonded.  They may not even realize he’s a veela yet.”  I wipe my finger in the blood and sniff it.  It definitely belongs to my mate.  Anger makes my wings stand up higher with a sharp, metallic gleam to them.  The feathers are no longer soft.  Now they are like razor blades.  I start trying to scent the air, testing my bond randomly.  I follow my instincts and take off.
“Deep down he knows, even Ginny tried to make him understand.  He just really wanted to legally be your brother.  He’ll get over it, whatever is so secret.  It won’t change anything.”  She argued.  “He loves you.”
Two sets of eye rolls answered him, and the click of the bedroom door opening again.
“Ugh, Poppa, it was nothing but harmless fun. From what I heard Dad used to do WAY worse when he went there.” Teddy wore black trousers with a white button down and the school blazer, but he had gone with blue hair with my silver eyes. His eyes rolled as though he was suffering through our discussion.
“Boys,” Remus started.  “Now that things are back to normal and you’ve had time to get your bond stabilized, have you come to any decisions regarding your future?”  He asked with a slight hesitance.
“I know we have time, and we can go shopping for the furniture today.  We stick with gender neutral colors and themes, but go as extravagant as we want.”
“That is normal, that’s what heats are like sometimes.  They may not all be quite as intense, but, this was our first.  You did nothing wrong.  I feel more alive today than I think I ever have.  Hell, I think next time we should add our wings into the mix.  I bet we could finish just by breathing on each other’s feathers.”
“He was afraid of anyone knowing.  He’s gay Ronald.  He wanted it to be a secret until they were ready.”
I refused to let Harry go as we finally got to the hospital.  Being fairly used to veela dynamics the staff really did not fuss about it much.  As they were checking him over a text came through letting us know that the godparents were going to be home soon.  I rolled my eyes, but let Harry focus on what the nurses were doing.
“Are you planning on living in the manor?”
Dursley
I decided to make my way to the library and try to get my mind off of my veela.  I knew my mother had invited some friends of hers, even if only one of my own friends was going to make it.  As the rest were out of the country on holidays.  Remembering that Pansy will be there drew a sigh out of me.  She is my best friend, but she  really wants to be more.  I’ve tried letting her down easy, but she keeps hoping.  There are only so many ways I can explain that I don’t see her that way, and never will.
"Yes, a lot of fun.  I do wish I had seen more of the rest of the faire though.  The fighters looked interesting."  I answered honestly.
“Yours are incredible too.” I whispered back with tears in my eyes.  “I can’t wait to see what forever feels like.”  I pull him in and kiss him deeply again.  I thought about trying to get him going again, but he once again seemed to read my mind.
We began by slowly grooming the other's wings.  Hands gently parting the feathers, jolts of sensation causing my body to react.  Soon our bodies were moving in a rhythm of their own.  There was no battle for dominance, just the organized chaos of tangled limbs. I felt the brush of Draco’s skin as though he was made of electricity.  His fingers tracing the path his lips would follow.  My breath came out in deep pants.  Words of love on my lips.  He anticipated my needs, only pausing when I could no longer avoid exploring him.  I wanted to taste him, to make him feel as good as he was making me feel.  Unlike when I was not in heat, we didn’t seem to tire.  Climaxing did not entice us to stop, we just kept going until our bodies could no longer stay awake. Our whispered words echoing in the large room.
He started waking up when I got up again to turn the water off.  “Hey love, can you walk? Or do you need me to carry you?”  I asked softly before placing a kiss to his forehead.  I could clearly see his pain, the scent coming in waves intoxicating.  I’d been warned that my instincts would be conflicted during my mate’s heat, but this feeling was not what I expected.  I wanted to protect him. I wanted to end the pain.  Yet, lust was building.
I woke up in pain on my eighteenth birthday. I knew it was going to happen, but that did not make the tearing of the skin between my shoulder blades any easier.  I could also feel a burning where my scent glands were coming in.  I choked down some pain relievers even though I was mostly through my changes.  I stood up to look at myself in the full length mirror on my wall. I scoffed at my hair. It was a mess, I’d have to fix that before going anywhere.  The most noticeable change was the wings.  Silver feathers with emerald green tips.  I opened them up fully, impressed by their size.  I never saw my father’s wings and now that he was in prison I would most likely never see them.  I reach back to touch the feathers, ignoring the blood slowly dripping down my back.  My body reacted to the touch immediately.  Small shock waves, not dissimilar to an orgasm, made me shiver.  “Well, that was interesting.”  I said aloud to myself.  It took me a few minutes to figure out how to retract my wings, but eventually they were once again safely hidden.  The open wound changed to a barely sealed line for each wing.  I quickly rinsed the blood off my back in the shower then dressed in straight cut black jeans and a dark gray jumper.  I spent the most time on my hair, smiling when I had it perfect.  The white blond hair and pale skin always looked great with this color.
*****Teddy’s p.o.v*****
“There’s plenty of room here, and we have no problem, however long it takes for that.  I was more referring to, well, um…  Veela Omegas are very fertile when in heat, which should be soon.  Have you planned that out?  Are you just going to see what happens?”  He finished, looking like he wished the earth would swallow him.
Ron looked surprised.  “Why wouldn’t he tell me?  Didn’t he trust us?”  He was starting to get flushed, so she grabbed his hand and held it tight.
Hermione sat in the kitchen watching while Harry and Draco cooked.  She had no idea how she could have not noticed a difference in her best friend.  They worked as a fluid team.  No awkward movements, just knowing exactly what the other would be doing.  He had grown more confident and he lost the shadows that had always followed him.  He was just happy.  She smiled brightly as she realized this, Harry noticed it and laughed.  “What?”  He asked.
Suddenly, without warning it was over.  I quickly downed a pain reliever and went back to sleep curled up in my lover’s arms.  I dreamed of comfort and safety.   I was able to forget the worries that had plagued me.
Draco takes this one.  “Not at the moment.  We both have some bad associations with it.  We share a flat in Muggle London for now.  When we get some renovations done to the manor we may decide to go back there.”
“Well, I just wanted to let you know.  I’ve got to get home.  Take care of yourselves.”  We walked her out, and when I turned to Draco all I wanted was to be distracted.
“My parents left me money.  I wanted to live a bit before figuring that out, but, yes.  I already have been approached about an opportunity that will have to wait to be announced.”  Harry answered, looking at Draco.
“You can do that?  You don’t just tell me something like that, now I need to see it!”  He said in a mocking voice.  Unfortunately, as Pans was finishing one song she must have caught some of the interaction.  She loudly asked if the audience wanted to see a volunteer dance too, as she looked dead into my eyes with a grin.
“I have also been approached, and it cannot be announced, but, yes.” the blond added.
“I really don’t know.  I just think it’s what my dads wanted to hear.  I didn’t really have a family for a long time.  How long did you want to wait?”  I sat up so I could see his face clearly.
“Oh, any way I win. Even if neither of us is correct I win so, sure. I think he will follow grandma and you into slytherin. He is very good at arguing.” With that he kissed me, entwined our hands and tugged me and our cart to the train. I quietly laughed, but followed quickly.
“I know, I can’t hide away forever though.  I am still a veela and I will not be taken completely by surprise again. You have helped me learn to fly, and I am no longer a complete newbie to this.  We’ll be careful.”  I failed at my attempt to hide the anger I was feeling at the situation.
She had picked out a green button up with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows with black jeans that were tighter than I would usually wear.  She gave up on my hair though.  It resisted every trick she had.  I showed up a little early, after promising Hermione I’d update her later.  I ordered a drink and waited, hoping I was not just imagining him.  The minutes felt like hours, but, exactly at six, in he came.  He was wearing a tight black button down with form fitting jeans.  His hair was perfect as always.  Part of me still believed that this was a coincidence, until he smiled at me.  That same amazing smile I’d seen in the dreams.  As he approached his scent hit me.  It was intoxicating.  I had been in the room with other alphas, but this inspired an immediate reaction.  I wanted to rub my face into his neck and drink in the scent.  I could have swooned when he put his arm around my waist and ordered a drink for himself and another for me.
“You look stunning, so let’s get this mess over with so I can have you all to myself for the rest of the day.”  Harry smirked playfully at Draco’s statement.  “I’m serious, I want some serious cuddle time after this.”.
My jaw dropped when he mentioned travel.  I had always wanted to, but, with my life I hadn’t had many opportunities.  I realized Draco’s family had money, but I was just now realizing what that could mean.  The thought of traveling, of kids one day.  I couldn’t help the warmth I felt at the realization.  My scent must have changed, as everyone was suddenly looking at me with goofy smiles.  Draco leaned over and kissed my mark.  “You get to help decide everything we do, but the world is open to us.  We are young, we are free to do almost anything and I want you to experience life with no boundaries for once.  We have our whole lives, together.”
“I thought we were using protection.” I said, fighting to speak through my instinct.  He looked me in the eyes and shook his head.  He was flushed from the heat, his body moving on top of me, eyes locked on mine.  I held his hips, my thumbs pressing in hard.  We were lost to our primal natures.  No more words, just instinct and feeling.
Harry felt his heart starting to flutter and forced himself to turn away, to look back up towards the podium where a band had just started playing.
they were in the same house after all and he didn't want to lose Ravenclaw twice the amount of points they would lose if Potter got himself caught on his own.
The most amazing thing, though, was the fact that he finally got to fly on a broom again. Quidditch with Ron and the twins was the best thing ever and he couldn't wait for the school team try outs this September. He just wasn't sure about the position he wanted to play, yet. Keeper definitely wasn't his thing but he loved being seeker and beater equally. And his father had been a chaser so that would be amazing, too. Nevertheless, his decision could wait until his return to school. Now he just wanted to enjoy the time he had with the Weasleys. At the moment he was getting ready to leave the burrow- that's what they had called their house - for Diagon Alley in order to buy various school supplies that were required. Soon all of them were gathered around the fireplace, even though Harry wasn't sure as to why exactly
But he didn't stop moving until he reached a locked door.
“The only person in your little gang with a resemblance of a brain in her skull? When is she
He knew it was a stupid idea:
The shouting voice made Harry's head explode in another wave of pain which made his eyes water and caused a reflex to push his hands against his ears and crouch into a tiny heap of limbs. In the movement he brushed something cold with his fingertips and soon he heard what it was. (Well, at least he had been right with his guess as to where his aunt kept the medicine.)
"we know about the Philosopher's stone."
Draco's heart rate doubled when he hastily threw a glance back at his father to check if he had noticed that somehting was off. He hadn't. Quietly he picked up the glasses and held them into the opening of the cabinet. Nothing happened. After another quick glance at his father he dared to whisper something.
“Oi, Mione! Watch your language!”
and as he was in fact very interested in Dark Arts the Malfoy heir couldn't ever be more curious about a place. As his father's appointment at
"I've got some friends in Gryffindor. Can't blame the the other Ravenclaws in my year for not liking me. I'm losing lots of house points in potions. I think the teacher has targeted me since he first saw me. "
As he didn't know the other two, he came to the conclusion that they weren't pure bloods. At least not part of the sacred 28 families. He gave Boot a short nod and then walked up the staircase,  reaching their dorm first.
Sighing Draco dipped his quill into black ink and started writing.
The dishes disappeared and it was time for dessert now. They were all Halloween themed and looked extremely delicious.
:    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :
The blond's head snapped towards him, sporting a surprised expression. When he opened his mouth the words escaped as a whisper.
“Harry Potter!”
Finally his eyes landed upon Malfoy who was sitting alone with an empty parchment in front of him, staring right back at Harry.
There weren't many locked doors in Hogwarts.
Harry kept his eyes fixed upon Malfoy angrily. Or so he was telling himself. Even though he was very far from actually believing it this time. Because most of his mind was currently more freaking out about the fact that Draco Malfoy was wearing a dress and he was absolutely slaying it!
“-I think I’m going to get my homework. Won’t hurt, getting an early start on that English essay.”
? Well, he could always ask Hermione about it if it ever got important again.
"What is it, 'Mione?"
Draco snorted and shook his head. Then he abruptly snapped it up to glare at his friend. Because Blaise had said: “Thanks, you too.”
Next he opened one of the bigger parcels. In the red wrapping he found a note and a sweater. The sweater was red and beared a big 'H' on the front. The note said that it was a Christmas sweater from Mrs. Weasley.
When Harry woke up he kept his eyes closed. Like this he could pretend that everything was true.
“Ah, Harry! Following my path to fame, are you?”
Malfoy used the door knocker and it sang:
"Why would I want to sit with those Gryffindorks? Or you for that matter."
He didn't ask it though. He didn't dare to remind the other boy of that night, it must've had awoken bad memories or so he guessed from the nightmare his roommate had had afterwards.
Regulus’ expression changed but Harry was entirely unable to read it.
Without them finding the slightest trace.
Percy smiled tensely. He did not mean for this conversation to come up right now. But apparently it had to be said now. It was probably long overdue after two months of dating. Gently, he took Oliver’s hand into his and kissed the back of it.
The last question they were now facing was, how they ever would be able to stop Snape from getting that stone. They wrecked their minds over it but Ron was only whining about how he needed food because he would be starving so they called it a day, went to dinner and split up afterwards, everyone heading for their respective common room.
During the train ride everything was perfect. Just as it should be. Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy, Blaise; and Draco in their center of attention. Nothing to remind him that he wasn't a Slytherin as he was supposed to be. Up until the feast it was like Potter didn't even exist. But as he sat among all those Ravenclaws he became incredibly aware of his absence. His friends weren't around and the Ravenclaws ignored him – not that that wasn't exactly what he wanted, mind you. He just felt his mask slipping away a bit and usually he just had to glare at Potter and let the
after that."
Draco smiled. He knew exactly which one he wanted to talk about. And he remembered most of it since he had written it down.
Draco jumped to his feet and his eyes scanned the room anxiously, trying to make out the source of the voice.
Finally back in his dorm he let himself fall onto his bed and reached for the book on top of the stack he had neatly piled on his bedside table.
He hated that -
"Wow, okay, this is at least twice as crazy as the rumours! You sure you didn't make that up?"
Draco walked through the door which the other boy had left open in his hurry and entered the almost deserted common room. He received a few glares for being out that late and risking their well earned house points but he just ignored them and made his way up to their dorm.
Harry also wished them a good nights sleep and made his way up the Ravenclaw tower. Surprisingly Malfoy was already up in their dorm. He'd seen Terry, Anthony and Michael sitting together in the common room, probably studying and eagerly ignoring him.
“I have you know, I used to play Seeker for Ravenclaw as well. That is why I came here, to see if the team is still as great as it was back then, with me to hold it up and together!”
She turned around on her heel and disappeared on the right staircase.
And the time dragged forward slowly and got slower and slower until it seemed to stand still completely and Draco was to await a whole year of this.
"But-"
The rest of the holidays were confusing. Most of the time he spent with the Weasleys and Hermione and they had lots of fun. They even sneaked him into the Gryffindor common room a few times. Malfoy kept ignoring him, no matter how often Harry tried to start a conversation. It seemed the Christmas morning had never happened. Like they hadn't had their greatest fun in months playing in the snow together. Like Malfoy had never given him two of his presents. Yeah, that had been pretty obvious. The wrapping had been the same as on the pureblood's presents and Harry didn't know anyone else who would give him something like that. He wondered where Malfoy went all the time. During the day he often disappeared and all the times Harry attempted to find him, he was nowhere to be seen. Not in the grounds, neither in the yard, nor in the library - Hermione could confirm this. She had been spending a great deal of time in there, searching for information on Nicolas Flamel. There was nothing to be found as it seemed. She even urged Harry to enter the restricted section with his invisibility cloak. He had tried but he only managed to escape Filch with a lot of luck and he didn't want to risk another detention too soon.
Yawning he made his way back and entered the Ravenclaw common room behind his classmates. Most of them stayed down there until dinner but Harry just grabbed an interesting looking book and then headed straight for the dorm.
While the others started discussing Harry's whereabouts during the troll attack in low voices, Draco reached for some parchment, ink and his quill on his nightstand to write a letter to his parents. He knew his father would probably make a big fuzz about a troll being able to get inside Hogwarts but sooner or later he would find out anyway.
"You're probably right."
Draco relaxed visibly and let himself sink into Harry’s embrace. “Did I tell you that I love you today?”
Harry had failed his self-set task miserably. He had not gotten Draco to talk to him again, instead he had only made it worse - he didn't even know
Then there was a much too familiar growl. Draco wanted to scream, he wanted to run, but he found that he coulnd't move.
Anyway, today was halloween.
Draco’s eyes turned into tiny sunsets again. “Yeah, I know you’re bi.”
"To get to the stone before Snape does,"
Because one thing was sure:
Harry had been sneaking out with his cloak more than once but never for that long. Something felt terribly wrong this time. Something must have happened. Draco wasn't able to close an eye that night because Harry didn't return. At all.
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
"That's none of you business, Scarface!"
Harry slowly got to his feet and put on an old, much too large sweater and some worn out pants. Now that he was awake he couldn't think of getting back to sleep. Therefore he just decided to go for a walk. It couldn't hurt to get to know a bit more about the building which he was going to live in for the greater part of the next seven years.
Harry found himself searching the room with his eyes for... he didn't even know what he was looking for. Something just felt amiss. He spotted his roommates (apart from Malfoy, obviously) sitting at the Ravenclaw table, talking as if they had never stopped. Soon, Anthony looked into his direction and made a motion to the other two. Terry and Michael turned their heads and sure enough all three of them flashed him bright grins. Harry smiled back and gave a little wave before bringing his gaze back to his plate – which was still empty. How long did he just sit there without eating? Shaking his head, he helped himself to some scrambled eggs and bacon and tucked right in before going back to people watching. Draco Malfoy was actually
Harry was sitting on his window sill, letting the chilly morning wind carry away any leftovers of sleepiness. Hagrid's photo book was lying open in his lap as he watched the sun rising, making the boring neighborhood of Little Whinging glow in warm colors.
Draco slapped Harry’s shoulder. “You can stick that smirk up your Gryffindor ass!”

“I said I didn’t want anything.”
Draco was stunned.
"It's
It was all too much just now.
Well, the 'unseen' part had an obvious answer: Harry's invisibility cloak.
"Could you maybe show me?"
Harry gasped. “What an accusation! Me? Braggy? I would never!”
"It will help me to identify the potion or curse, master Draco."
"I know your're there, Potter. Just take your damn glasses."
Ron didn't share his opinion, apparently. The ginger boy looked terrified. Harry suppressed a laugh at his friend's ridiculous facial expression and set off towards the exit again.
“You go first”,
“It won't take very long, I assure you! There is no reason to worry. Everybody, go back to practicing!”
Harry slowly glanced up at his two best friends. He was pretty sure “dumbfounded” was the perfect word to describe his current state. He blinked.
A few slow steps and then he felt a thin hand wrapping around his upper arm slowly dragging him backwards.
The two young wizards grinned at each other in victory and were already congratulating each other when there suddenly was a female scream behind the locked door. Harry froze.
NO! Not this word again!

. Taking a last glance at the clear blue summer sky, he hopped off the sill and closed the window behind him before making his way down to the kitchen. Another day in his living hell and it would be exactly like the last one and exactly like the ones that were coming. He just hoped that his friends could write soon. While he prepared breakfast he managed to slip one slice of bread into his back pocket as Petunia was calling for Vernon and
The other first years started moving again and Draco entered the common room right behind them.
“Tell Pansy that for a change.”
"Are you able to perform a simple potions scan? And maybe one for curses and hexes?"
"Amazing! What did you do to your glasses again?"
still didn't want to tell him what... you know...).
"1 am"
First Harry Potter didn't want to be his friend and now this. He belonged to Slytherin! His whole family had always been in Slytherin. This was so so bad!
“That’s none of your business, Potter.”
“Here yew go, kid!”
“Okay, fine. You’re not on probation. But get these out of my sight and talk to your father, alright?”
“Come on, mate. Let's go to the car.”
"Alright, have a nice day, Sir."
He let out a small sigh, dipped his quill into the black liquid and started writing.
Harry was
Ignoring his heart beating painfully against his chest he slowly pulled the door open and peered into the corridor. At first it was too dark to see anything. The only difference was that the snores got louder. He deeply regretted not trying harder to master Lumos last summer.
being at Hogwarts (
"Are you alright? Did anything else happen?"
He had missed them
This boy was unbelievable! Just leaving him alone in the dark with a cowardish dog to do... what exactly?
“You know me.  I know how to make an entrance.”  I kissed him quickly, unable to wait any longer to feel him. With my veela still mostly in charge, seeing my mate safe, in chains I had a deep desire to ravage him right there.  My more rational side decided that chains were worth looking into later, and not while the police were wandering around. He began to kiss my neck, breathing in my scent.  I think for a moment we forgot where we were because we only stopped when Hermione coughed politely.  Seeing an officer with her we both blushed and sat up straight. “Sorry,” I managed to get out “this is a new bond, still in the honeymoon phase I guess.”
“How do your friends and family feel about this relationship?”
“I did not say I did not feel anything towards him.  He was a prat that first day. Even if I had felt it right away, I would have been turned off by the attitude. He always seemed to hate me.  I also wouldn’t say I was obsessed.  Curious maybe, but not obsessed.”
"We'll have to do this again sometime then.  These faires become a whole separate life for some people."
I scratched the back of my neck nervously.  “I’m sure it will be fine.  Eventually. They are just worried about us.  I just couldn’t do it.  I’m sorry if I took the choice to wait out of your hands, but some part of me really wants it to happen when it happens.  We have time to find a house, even if it happened the first time.  We have time to travel a bit. I don’t want to worry about …”
The first message to arrive was surprisingly not a howler, it was from Luna, congratulating them.  They smiled at each other but, both knew that would not be the last.   As more and more owls arrived they were getting annoyed by the howlers.  Even being thrown directly into the fire they spit out some of their contents.  The number of times they heard ‘unnatural’,‘disgusting’, and ‘faggot’ as the paper burned was overwhelming.  However, they also got quite a few uplifting messages from people praising their bravery at coming out to the wizarding world and congratulating them on their marriage.  Even more from other gay people in the wizarding world who were too scared to come out, but happy to see them being proud of their relationship.  Eventually, the owls died down and they gradually read through all the messages.  They heard from friends from their days at Hogwarts, most of them admitting it was not that much of a shock that they’d end up together.  There were also more questions than the pair would ever have time to answer, as they still wanted some semblance of privacy for their life. They opened all of the regular mail coming in, swearing at the paper cuts they inevitably seemed to get.
"Let's go to mine then. Huge manor, only my mother who is easy to avoid. "
“How can she do that?”  He asked me.  I closed his jaws lightly with my fingers.
My mouth opened and closed, but I could not make a sound.  My hands were trembling and I was fighting tears.  Draco pulled me into his arms, his hands rubbing my back soothingly.  “Love, who is it?  I’m here with you, you are Safe.”
“But I do. I thought we had established that yesterday?”
Draco bit his lip and rolled his eyes. He loved rolling his eyes with a passion. “There might have been a few sexy ones, but I’m definitely not going to tell you about them.”
"Alright. I'm sorry I missed your big day but I really had to get these things done. I'm sure you can understand, after all you are twelve now! I will make it up to you anyway. Sleep well."
And that damn dress absolutely broke down all of the walls Harry had built up. Before he could talk himself out of it again, he started walking over to the table of the three with a quick step. On his way he grabbed himself one of the lilac drinks. Some extra courage wouldn’t hurt.
As a result he was now making his way down to the great hall.
“Yeah, right. I also have work to do. Technically. But it’s in my locker. So. Yeah.”
"Of course, master Draco, Sir. Dobby's lips are sealed."
"What..? Why am I here? What time is it?"
After taking a long sip of his drink and slapping himself mentally, Harry managed to remember his ballroom etiquette skills that he had somewhat achieved over his years at the ministry. He held out his arm for Draco, trying not to freak out entirely when he took it, and led him over to the dancefloor.
“Alright.”
"Oh, my angel. My
things. Like… like fluffy things. (Well done. Nice metaphor, Harry!)
He didn't want to spend Halloween silent and on his own, so why not telling her what she wanted to know.
“Deal.”
A door knocker?
Draco hummed in content and snuggled a little closer into Harry’s chest. “I did have a dream tonight, though. A good one.”
After another ten minutes of silent walking there was a sudden noise to their right. Malfoy jumped and before Harry had registered it the last glimpse of white blonde hair had disappeared in the shadows of the nearby trees, the dog right behind.
And they set off, walking next to each other, not daring to talk about what had happened but also not daring to leave the other alone, either. They were the first ones to be in the great hall, neither Harry nor Draco's friends being awake, yet. They settled down at Ravenclaw table next to each other. It was a bit weird to sit with the person that had been offending him for the past two months right until just this morning, but feeling glad that he didn't leave you alone.
“Okay.”
It did.
so strong that it overtook all his senses.
Harry still smiled like that.
"So what position will you do the try outs for?",
There are some things you don't just go through together without developing a friendship afterwards.
body height, tiny as you are."
"Harry?"
Squirrel would probably fit better for his name! This guy was just as pathetic.
Graves let out a sigh. “Just… see for yourself.”
“I- I think I have a date?”
They got detention. Polishing all of the awards in the trophy room on the following monday. Their smiles had faded when they had changed their clothes into dry ones and went down for lunch. Having skipped breakfast, Harry was really hungry.
Not really having a chance to talk himself out of it, he agreed.
When Harry returned, Draco was still in the cafeteria, the same position he had been sitting in half an hour ago. On his own. Neither Pansy, nor Blaise, nor any of Draco’s minions in sight. Something started thrumming beneath his skin at the prospect of having Draco to himself for the whole period.
“Hey, baby! Nothing to worry over. Just a few minutes. And they wouldn’t care if we were two hours late either.”
Their potion didn't get any better in the remaining half an hour -if it hadn’t even got worse- and Harry was truly relieved when the bell rang and he was finally able to storm out.
"I never get presents!"
“Go on, go on!”,
"Do you maybe need help with potions?"
"Wait, so you're saying that Snape let the troll inside?"
He should've guessed that. Cho was next to address him.
Without wasting any time to another thought they unlocked the door and entered the girls bathroom.
His heart jumped.
"Flitwick says they got rid of the troll."
Either way, it meant that Harry was stuck at this Ministry Yule ball on his own and he’d prefer to find himself some pleasant company before a bunch of self-declared important people would start chatting him up.
"Deatheaters were You-Know-Who's followers, all of them are purebloods, people who's ancestors were all wizards, and they all were in Slytherin at school!",
He let hear an unnerved groan.
Further the room was filled with comfy looking armchairs, benches and sofas and inbetween desks, of course. Literally everything in here seemed to be blue. Next to a window to their left there was a small fireplace, crackling slightly.
At least until Aunt Petunia would knock on the door of his cupboard he could pretend to lie in a four poster with blue curtains inside a magical castle.
He couldn't help but stare in awe.
As the black haired boy turned his head and laid his bespectacled, shining green eyes on him he felt blood shooting into his head, especially his cheeks - in anger of course! When Draco rapidly turned his head down a fuzzy feeling was left behind and he sensed something squirming in his stomach. Maybe he was just getting sick. Similar things had happened a lot recently. Maybe Potter had hexed him. Or slipped him a potion. He should probably go and see Madam Pomfrey about it.
Harry tries to find a place for himself in this new world while Draco is suffering.
Did she just call him by his first name? What an audacity! He was a Malfoy! She was to show respect towards him!
"Did you know his parents were said to be deatheaters? But his father works at the ministry and the Malfoys are a 'noble' family of purebloods, so they haven't been arrested."
"You've got this. Just speak very clearly."
"Any idea what this is?"
Harry smiled. He really liked the gesture of getting something selfmade but he definitely wouldn't risk to try those sweets if his life depended on it. He'd already made bad experiences with Hagrids cooking skills.
"Harry Potter?"
here,
"The school wards probably interfered with the radio connection. Try the tapes, they should be working!"
Gulping down the feeling of desperation Draco stood up from his desk chair and paced around his room. Dobby had been his last resort to find out what had happened to him and the elf had agreed with
with him, and that was definitely not what he wanted.
that lingered around here, that he was superior to them in every way possible. Just like he had learned it from his father. The store that was their destination was definitely the most clean and safe-looking place there was in this Alley. Actually it was like a very dark verion of a Diagon Alley shop. Weird, unnatural, valuable, beautiful and scary objects were presented in the shop window. Finally they entered and Draco didn't take in Lucius' warning to not touch anything due to a distraction. And even though everything in this shop was fascinating and at least partially desirable, it was not what had distracted him. No, but in the far corner of the shop there was a tall, wooden cabinet and Draco could've sworn that he saw a movement over there just a moment ago. Then, the shop owner turned up and he decided to investigate upon that suspiscous movement as soon as his father was caught up in the transactions.
"Maybe some kind of plant?"
The next morning he woke up to the sound of a carefully shut door and fading footsteps.
And they made their way back to the school. Harry urged to tell Ron and Hermione what exactly he had seen and heard - especially the encounter between Snape and Quirrel - but he didn't get his chance this evening. He didn't want Hagrid, Neville or Draco to overhear them and there was no way they wouldn't hear them talking in the silence of the night. The way to the Ravenclaw tower was awkward. And with awkward he meant
His movements and pronounciation seemed confident enough but then the broken state of his wand messed up everything. Apparently fixing a wand wasn't as simple as wrapping it in obnoxious amounts of spellotape. A light purple streak shot from the point where it was snapped in half rather then from its tip and just about grazed Hermione's shoulder. The girl immediately started sobbing and tears were streaming down her face when she turned around to glare at the redhead.
in reach once again. Everything was as it should be.
When Granger and the Weasel joined Harry on the way to the Quidditch pitch, Draco left them to themselves. He'd wanted to watch the game with the Slytherins anyway but still his mood fell a bit.
“I mean, it is common knowledge that the seeker is the most important and therefore most popular player of the team.”
He couldn't even think about how that would've been.
"I'll take that as a compliment."
The smirk was now plastered to his face, big and bright.
“We'd be way slower than the train, so either we won't find it, ever, or it's going to run us over. Let's just follow the railways next to it.”
TW: bad attempt at writing Hagrid’s accent :)
"This was important."
Harry thought about it for a moment. That whole scenario had been overwhelming.
He punched it.
“Yeah, I hope so.”
When they arrived, Ron had a brilliant idea.
Speaking of them, Ron's present had been a package of Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans and two chocolate frogs. Hermione had - who would have thought that? - sent him a book.
“Hey, Ron! You think you'll try out for the Gryffindor team this year?”
“Okay I didn’t mean to get so depressing. My point was: all of those dreams were weird as it gets. I mean, you and I were always there and I always tried to get you to show me affection of any kind but all the stuff happening around that was just… super weird and totally out of context. I don’t know, that’s probably how dreams are supposed to be when they’re not nightmares.”
Both houses seemed to be good choices to him. But he wouldn't really want to spend all his time with this Malfoy guy. He didn't seem very nice. Neither at Madam Malkin's nor on the train.
Just make sure he doesn't get to school.
It's not very likely that two first years manage to defeat an adult troll. Each of you will receive ten points for their house. But don't expect to always get this lucky!"
"Sneaking around past curfew again, are you, Potter?"
"Of course, master Draco, Sir!"
It was a ridiculous thought anyway.
He was just about to leave, when a shrill voice called out for him: “Oi, Potter! Don’t you wanna join us?”
"No, Malfoy, please! I just wanted to make them come back!"
And so they did. Then Mr and Mrs Weasley took Ginny through the barrier, leaving Ron and Harry to themselves. As their time was running out they decided to go together. They took up a lot of speed, the wall came closer and closer and –
Harry as well had spotted Snape's injury. He even could have sworn to have seen a drop of blood running down the Professor's left shoe. But before he could take a second glance, Snape hid it with his robe and snarled,
. Draco hadn't been able to believe his luck when Lucius had mentioned this at breakfast and told him the two of them would be attending to their respective businesses together. His mother had always prohibited going to
When Draco left the owlery, after sending his owl home with his letter, it was way to early for breakfast and Blaise and Pansy were probably still sleeping.
Hermione reached into her bag and triumphantly pulled out a DVD. “10 things I hate about you!”
This clearly showed how desperate they were.
"Yeah, I'm fine guys and no I did not battle a dragon. Who even said that?"
Surprised Draco looked up and saw Harry sitting on his bed, smiling at him, his hair tousled even worse than usual. He realised, he'd never seen Harry waking up before, even though they'd been roommates for months now and his heart warmed at the sight. He felt a light blush crawling up his cheeks and shook his head to get rid of it. His gaze directed to the book he'd just been unwrapping, he finally dared to answer,
Then, Graves switched keepers and the brunette girl Harry had raced during the warm up was now up. He didn't get a single Quaffle in after that. Cho did, once, but Merlin, that girl was good! Harry wasn't surprised when, after the time was up, she got keeper. Cho finally got her cheer and excitement back when she was chosen for chaser along with that good looking guy with the undercut, Calum Williams, who, Harry was pretty sure, had played the same position the year before. The final member of the chaser trio was Luke Chambers. Harry was so happy for Cho that he almost forgot to be disappointed about not getting in himself.
Then something seemed to jump into place inside him because suddenly the perfect mask reappeared on his face and he said,
But it seemed like neither of them were feeling like answering. Anger was boiling inside Harry and he turned towards Malfoy, ready to question him about why the hell he'd been following him, but when he found the other boy pale and staring blankly at the door knocker he just couldn't.
The stunning view of the grounds lying still beneath the covers of the night. The sky outside matching the painting on the dome shaped ceiling. Bright stars all over. And the cozy little fire. And the bookshelves. And the calm that was radiating off the colours that could be seen anywhere. Blue and bronze. Only then Harry realized how much he had really missed this place. Taking a final glance at the Rowena statue, he turned towards the staircases. He was home. Enjoying every step, he slowly made his way up to their dormitory which was now bearing the number II instead of the I that had sat there just a few months prior.
“I have nothing to do with that.”
Draco huffed a breathless laugh.
A new wave of energy took over his body, entirely sparked by the thought of what Malfoy's face would look like if Harry finished before him. The brunette girl was soon out of his field of vision and he was now so close behind Malfoy, he was sure he'd be able to touch the tail of his broom if he stretched out his arm in front of him.
There was a deep growl on the other side of the door. Draco froze.
"Who cares?! It's so cool!",
Pansy screeched.
"Um... Harry, would you maybe like to assist us with this?"
And then Dobby showed up, making everything worse. Well, at least now he knew that his friends remembered him! You always have to see the positive sides! Did you know how
"I trusted - I relied on you. How dare you sullying our name like that. I thought you were my son-"
"Elves can do magic other than house keeping spells, right?"
A proud bird which's posture really reminded him of the noble Lucius Malfoy. Curious but still happy Draco took the envelope and broke the green wax seal. Slowly he unfolded the expensive parchment holding elegant words written in night black ink.
at Snape.
"That's enough. I told you: I believe he somehow had already cursed me at that point! Now get to work!"
Again.
He wasn't really in his best mood.
Then this Clearwater prefect-girl lead the Ravenclaw first years to their rooms. They went up a lot of stairs and Draco tried not to look impressed by them moving around.
said Percy,
The whole group slowly set into motion. When Harry held one of the broomsticks tightly grasped in his right hand, excitement and nervosity set in at the same time. His heart rate sped up, it was like adrenaline was flooding his body and replacing the blood in his veins. He was totally focused on the wood in his palm and the ground under his feet. Cho, next to him, was rambling something he didn't quite gather as he threw one leg over the broom and bent his knees a little, ready to set off. And then the whistle blew and he was in the air instantly and it felt so good, so right and he loved being there.
Draco smirked after the invisible boy knowingly, who's steps could be heard faintly, running down the spinal staircase.
“Oooh, that. Right, I remember. See you Sunday then.”
At one point he couldn't keep his eyes open anymore but still wasn't able to drift off.
"One - Wait, no. I don't have any. I have an owl."
Still his mind didn't leave completely off of his roommate. He remembered the last evening. It had been nice talking to him about Quidditch. Of course he wouldn't allow a conversation like this to happen if people knowing his father were around. But family was a strong priority amongst purebloods, which meant almost all of them had left over Christmas, and his father would never converse with anyone less than a pureblood.
"We have to convince him to set that thing free again",
"Harry, this is an invisibility cloak."
“So, did you just want to punish me for nothing or is there something you wanted to discuss with me.”
“I didn’t say that!” A shushing noise came from the front desk of the library. Madam Pince was back. “You know what-“
“Yeah, sure.”
"Oi, peabrain!
Harry stopped pouring coke for a moment and looked up.
She grabbed her friend's arm and pulled her into a standing position. Harry was now getting a bit nervous and looked at Cho, hoping to receive a logical and truthful answer from her.
"Forget it."
Thankfully it didn't. It only took them a lot of time to drag Norbert up all those stairs. Hagrid had given it something to calm down which caused the dragon to shuffle sleepily all the way. It almost tripped over the last step on the seventh floor's staircase, right under a singing and giggling Peeves who was writing swearwords onto the ceiling in black ink.
“Mate! Harry! If we can't get in, what if my parents will never get out?”
"He insisted that Slytherin played fair."
He considered telling the shop owner about it but something felt off with the whole thing. And his gut feeling turned out to be correct. When he was close enough he recognised the glasses. How could he not after having to look at them every single day of the previous school year? There were cracks in the lenses but these were unmistakingly Potter's.
“Don’t be ridiculous, we both know your father didn’t do this because he is so generous.”
It was perfect. To his surprise she had managed to make his platinum blonde hair look exactly the way he was always wearing it. Not daring to give more of himself away to a muggle-born Hufflepuff, he gave her a grateful smile before facing away. She seemed to understand his intentions, though, because during  the following lesson when he almost ruined the potion due to his fatigue, she took over and finished the potion on her own with perfect precision. From then on it became kind of their thing: Whenever one of them was late or looked tired, the other would ask,
"I'm very sorry but Professor Dumbledore just received a letter from the minister this morning, summoning him to the ministry. May
just leave me alone in the dark. They say there are
If only there was someone he could talk to. He felt a lump closing his throat again as a sob welled up inside him. His mother had been the only person he could talk to. And now she wanted to leave him here over Christmas as well!
"Hey, over here dimwit!",
"I warn you to not step out of line again. You're lucky your mother convinced me not to punish you. I expect best grades from you and don't make friends with people from unworthy families."
This boy got more and more interesting.
Draco and Harry both jumped when the letter raised its voice again.
After that, the rest of the day went by in exactly the same manner as every other day at Hogwarts in the previous year. It was incredible how everything just slipped back into place as if there hadn't been weeks in between. Draco spent the meals with his friends at the Slytherin table, moaning and drawling about incapable teachers, annoying first years and “fucking Potter”. At one point during dinner he felt someone watching them and after a few seconds spotted the culprit at the Ravenclaw table. Loony Luna had him fixed with her curious gaze, her head tilted to the right and her whole body slightly moving up and down in a constant rhythm, indicating she was swinging her legs again. It was an adorable picture.
After he was done with the assignment, Draco pushed his schoolwork aside and leaned forward a little. At this point Harry was not yet done processing.
"Let's go get a teacher before he wakes up."
It was Ron.
Draco pulled away and narrowed his eyes at Harry. “You know that’s not my name!”
"Draco, my man? Are you still awake?"
“Maybe I can teach you!”
No warnings except for a little sadness and dramatics.
It was only on the next morning that he realised that Hedwig hadn't had anything to eat that day and he made a mental note to himself to buy some bird treats from the 5 pound note he had gotten for Christmas as soon as he came across an animal store. A supermarket would probably do as well.
Harry stood up and left the hall with his fellow Ravenclaws. Out of nowhere there was a hand clasping his wrist and dragging him away.
He himself had failed making the feather rise from his desk
The bell rang and Draco took a last deep breath before he stepped inside the classroom.
Reluctantly he left the snowy owl to herself and complied with his aunts orders.

And go!
He didn’t get a reply.
long seven years of school.
After the Potter boy had finished admiring the effects of the cloak, he finally opened Draco's presents.
now! He could understand that some business was more important than personal matters. His other side just got even more angry at him.
But the reply was already muffled by the bathroom door. With a sigh, Draco started to get ready for bed. Dobby was a dead elf!
The door knocker lyrically recited a few lines but Draco wasn't listening any longer.
“No, we were let off early. Apparently Mx Black has a meeting this afternoon.”
That's what Harry did to make living here a little more bearable. Every day he set his alarm clock for right about dawn so that he could enjoy a few hours to himself in peace before the Dursleys would wake up. He watched the sun rising higher and higher, lost in the moment, when there was an intense knock on his door. Closing his eyes he let his head fall back against the wall and sighed.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Apparently someone here has selective memory loss. But for good measure: I love you.”
Percy sighed. After a moment of contemplation, he put his bag down and sat down next to Oliver.
But neither Hermione nor Ron seemed to have listened.
The troll stood in the center of the mess and its eyes were fixed on one of the porcelain sinks in the corner.
It probably was a good thing that his father didn't witness this moment. Where was he anyway? He often left for a few days when he had work to do but still... This was his
In the end the evening was very nice and Draco smiled while he was getting ready for bed. When he came out of the bathroom, damp hair and pajamas on, he heard angry voices coming from downstairs echoing through the halls of Malfoy Manor. Curious, he went towards the staircase to hear what they were saying.
sitting on the ground. Blood rushed to his cheeks as Malfoy started laughing at him and even the more agreeable Blaise couldn’t suppress a smirk. Earlier he had been glad that the librarian was absent, but now he kind of wished she was there to shush them.
"RAVENCLAW!"
He did it anyway.
Not with the to him known kind of magic that lingered in the walls of Malfoy Manor.
Harry nodded  and she went to the back of the shop before returning with a box the size of maybe a watermelon.
And with these words he left him sitting there.
was rather early, this was the first point on their list. The Alley was a dark and scary place, Narrow walls, weird people selling questionable products. Draco was amazed and disgusted at the same time. (And maybe a little scared, too, but he would never admit that.) This was the first time he saw the ugly side of dark magic. He always had more of an elegant, strong and powerful impression of the art. A rough hand grabbed his upper arm and Draco jumped.
He gave a nod and Ron threw the powder into the fireplace which suddenly lit up in bright green flames. Harry almost screamed when Ron stepped into them, but the boy seemed totally fine and his clothes didn't even catch fire!
(See the end of the chapter for
There's no chance his father would accept such a shame. That's what Draco was. A shame for his whole bloodline!
The longer they talked about it, the stranger got the theories. Meanwhile they had started to walk upstairs and came to a halt where they had to part ways.
There was a short pause when Draco took a sip of his Earl Grey and only when he sat the cup back down again did
Slowly Draco raised his hand and softly caressed Harry’s face with his fingertips. Just to make sure he was actually there. Harry stirred and his eyes were wide open in a matter of seconds. Damn it.
Two days later, when the Dursleys were sure he wouldn't faint again after too much exhaustion, they sent him to buy some groceries at the local supermarket. He finished the shopping as fast as possible and then went through some streets nearby scanning them for a pet store. Just as he was about to go back to Privet Drive (his arms were hurting from carrying the bags and the Dursleys would get suspiscious if he didn't return soon) he saw a sign with brightly coloured paw prints on it. Relieved he entered and grabbed the first bag of bird treats he spotted from the shelf. They were for canaries but that didn't matter.
“Hi, Mione. Did the bell ring already?”
She turned back to the dissolving crowd. Apparently there was really no one who wanted to be beater.
kissed! He sighed and reached for his wand on the nightstand to check the time.
Ron frantically hit a silver button right where in another car there would've been a radio before pulling the sky blue Ford Anglia up into the clouds. Their journey went without huge struggles.
After a short pause she added in a whisper tone,
Not even their library at Malfoy Manor was this  tall.
) put on the hat and it didn't take long for it to shout,
Draco held onto her tightly, loving the warmth radiating off her body and being afraid to lose it again too soon. When they let go after a few minutes he saw his father standing behind her. He was wearing his 'ministry expression' like always in public but there was a light sparkle to his eyes. It didn't look angry, like Draco had feared, but delighted, and he held Draco's suitcase in his right hand, which the boy had dropped at some point. Relief washed over him and he couldn't help but give Lucius a small smile before turning to say goodbye to his friends.
These were going to be some
Why would she?
"It was my fault! I’ve read so much about trolls... I thought I could defeat one on my own. The two of them saved me."
Harry snickered and gently placed his chin on top of Draco’s head. “Alright, go ahead, diva.”
is going for him.”
"I love Michael Jackson! Have you heard of him?"
Despite all that, what was he supposed to do? Send him away? With what reasoning? It wasn't like he desperately wanted someone else to sit next to him. Of course, it would be the most preferable to work alone but sadly Severus usually wanted them to work in pairs so that wasn't an option. Also, doing things his father would approve of somehow didn't have the same appeal anymore. Therefore, he gave a shrug and set up his parchment and quill while Smith took a seat to his left.
"So, what is this mysterious punishment for which we have to meet up in the entrance hall?"
Keeping this sincere smile on his lips he pushed the window close again and decided to bring Hedwig up to the owlery himself.
Pansy snickered.
who had rejected
"Any idea?"
He had a plan! Over Christmas he would get Malfoy to talk to him! And he would start with it right now!
"Thank you, mother! You're the best!"
He closed his eyes in anticipation and took a deep breath to calm down. The less sleep he gets, the shorter his temper. And he hadn't slept at all in at least 22 hours. Draco raised his foot and looked down at what used to be an ink bottle. He was about to leave it be and continue his way to the door when he heard a soft but high voice speak up.
Once again, Draco was disappointed. The only options for lunch that day were meat loaf and tomato soup. Draco hated meat loaf. And tomato soup. So, he glared at Potter and his friends, who were just then entering the hall, while Pretending that Pansy, Blaise and even Crabbe weren’t throwing him curious glances. He didn’t exchange a single word with them, only nibbling on a slice of bread and sipping some pumpkin juice, his glare relentlessly fixed on the Ravenclaw beater. The idiot didn’t deserve to be that good at it on his first try. He was so fixated on
And that's how Harry became the new Ravenclaw beater without even having considered it before.
“Ugh, bugger off!”
Everything here just seemed to be so huge and mysterious. They also used some secret passageways.
“I really need another drink. Come on, Luna. Let’s head over to the bar. It was very nice seeing you, Harry!”
Draco cleared his throat before refocusing on his book. Harry finished pouring and then started drinking from one of the glasses. Once it was empty, he eyed the other one in fake contemplation.
"I don't talk to him!"
Something in Terry's expression softened and he walked over to Harry's bed.
+(-)+(-)+(-)+
Anger against Potter was better than guilt or hurt.
“-be on Sunday morning, 8 AM on the Quidditch pitch. Thank you for your attention, I hope I will see a lot of your faces Sunday! That's it!”
"What is it you're working on?"
"Mr. Malfoy, you're father will not at all be pleased to hear about this. I expect you to make sure this will never happen again."
He'd never seen something like this.
(-----------------------)
Good thing he was rescued by Ron, Fred and George only three days into his punishment. There’s only so long you can survive on nothing but tinned soup.
Surprise and disbelief were lacing his voice.
"I think I might have been hexed or poisoned."
“It is a bit, considering that no one in my family has a problem with Harry and Draco.”
They went down to the great hall anyway.
Thinking about Harry's laugh, he craved to hear it again. It felt like an eternity since the last time. Maybe if he had went down to breakfast instead he might have heard it floating over from the Gryffindor table where he was probably sitting with Granger and the Weasle Clan. That was the moment when it hit.
I've never heard of such a thing before! A pet owl. Crazy world."
or whatever. He actually was a bit mad at
"Oops. You should've listened to me, Harry, sweetie! But, well, the spell will probably wear off in a few hours."
Harry gave Padma, who had asked the question, a confused look. The girl just pointed at Ron and Hermione sitting next to each other, the former patting the latter's back. Of course, the two of them would have to sit out for a while.
"Hey, Harry. Come over here!"
Draco played along, even though he didn't feel like it.
With a snap the house elf finally disapparated, leaving Draco to himself. It wouldn't take much now to get him to break every promise he made to
"I don't even think the Dursleys know my birthday."
This whole place was ridiculous.
Marietta looked like she was about to tear up.
He still looked shocked.
McGonagall sighed.
“What are you doing?”
In conclusion
His mother had bought it for him so he'd have something to read when he needed time on his own at school.
Lockhart smiled at her so widely, it had to be painful.
This included completely ignoring his potions partner as she asked,
Pain shot through his head and neck, worse than he was used to from his scar. But this wasn't the scar. His sight blackened in front of him and he just managed to get off the bed before he threw up onto the floor.
Against to what he would've expected, Draco's heart suddenly swelled with pride and he hugged her. Screw his mask! That could be on again when he met someone else! He didn't need it in front of his mother.
The group came to a halt right in front of
Everything was fine now. Dobby would keep Potter off the train, so that idiot was safe. And he'd be back at Hogwarts soon. Out of his father's eyes and
Luna, who was sitting on Ginny’s lap, asked the highly important question: “Hermione, what movie are we watching tonight?”
. Afterwards they travelled back home and Draco took his new broom outside to fly a bit about their grounds while his mother was watching him fondly but also sadly. He could've sworn he also saw a glimpse of anger in her eyes.
He ran back to the table to grab his wand and sprinted out of the room and through the corridors while hurriedly eating down his breakfast. When he arrived at the potions classroom, the Hufflepuff girl was already waiting for him. Except for her, the corridor was empty, luckily. She gave him a sceptical glance leaning her brown-haired head to the right.
“Oh, that sucks. I think all teams should do the tryouts like the Ravenclaw team. Every year for every position except the captain's. That's so much more fair, don't you think.”
It seemed like Goldstein wasn't listening to him, either.
He carded his hand through his hair, not really caring that his hairdresser had spent an hour taming it earlier. Slowly, Harry let his gaze wander over the people in the room. He had to stay at least for an hour and Hermione had opted out this time. Unwillingly, considering that Ron had caught a dreadful curse two weeks prior and someone had to look after Rose and Hugo while he was at St. Mungos.
Shopping can be a real mess.
Hermione was whisper shouting at them while finishing her illustration of
Harry snorted. “Okay, happy ending then. Carry on.”
He ended up putting them behind a couch table that was placed on its side and covered the whole thing by draping an old rug over it. Then he turned on the spot, burning the exact position into his retinas before making his way back out of the room. He didn’t need to look back to know that the gate had faded the moment it had closed.
Eventually Harry managed to open his mouth. “I’ll see you tomorrow then. Or Thursday at the latest.”
Without another word she opened the chest and took out the tiny, golden ball. It stretched it's wings, she let go and it went off. When it had disappeared from sight she blew a whistle and seven teenagers on brooms were in the air.
The days were still too long to be able to see the stars at this time of the day so they were still stuck with the theory-bullshit.
a Ravenclaw and his father had forbidden to make friends with anyone fitting into either of these categories.
"What I
started to
Oliver seemed to be a little nervous, but he accepted the hug and then followed the two redheads into the house. There he was immediately welcomed by the rest of the family, who all already knew him from their school years. Percy lingered behind.
Late at night Harry was still lying awake, his brain not letting him sleep, no matter how exhausted he was.
Finally they made a deal. Harry and Ron would at least study two hours a day and she would help them with research in the evening. Like this, the week went by pretty fast.
"What do you mean, we can't talk to him?"
"Thanks a lot!"
It turned out Percy, Fred and George had some very interesting inside information,
Both boys shook their heads.
Finally the bell rang and he sprinted all the way down to the great hall for lunch and headed straight for the Gryffindor table. When Ron and Hermione finally joined him he immediately started to tell them everything about Snapes leg. Hermione was the first to see the connection.
The one on monday had been enough for the next couple of months. It had reminded him horribly of the time at the Dursleys where he had to kneel on the floor to clean something and was either being ignored or insulted. Yeah Malfoy was back to that again, as well. Harry really couldn't remember to have made a mistake. The second present from Malfoy he'd put into his trunk without unwrapping it. There it lay next to Hermione's book, the cloak and the note that had came with it. It didn't bear a signature but it said that the useful item had once been his father's. Therefore he'd sworn himself to always look after it and never, not in a thousand years, lose it. The only good thing that came from that detention was, that he had found a special trophy in the room. Dedicated to James Potter for scoring 25 goals as a chaser all by himself in one single match with less than 2 hours playing time. In this moment Harry had decided to do
More like the kind of magic that filled the halls of Hogwarts. The kind that made the ceiling above his head look like the cloudy nightsky and made the candles and carved pumpkins float through the hall.
"Probably not."
, do you understand?"
“I was just-“
"Come on, first years! Get up! Breakfast in ten minutes!"
"Then bring him here!"
One would think that Ravenclaws would try to sit in the front if possible.
At this moment they were sitting huddled together with the Weaslebee in their corner of the Astronomy classroom.
"He only used it on me once. I wanted him to play with me and ran into his office. I broke this weird and dark looking box and he got so angry. I don't even know why, there was only a book in it. And from what I saw when I was trying to pick it up there wasn't even a single word written in it. But he got so damn angry and he lost control."
“Sure, whatever makes you fall asleep at night, Potter.”
“Wait, please tell me this has a happy ending!”
Surrounded by all cuddly and weak people.
Why should he care who the boy spent his time with?
I really don't want to know where you got that from but
"What? Not even for your birthday?"
“Wh- what- t d-d-it you-u d-d-d-do to m-me?”,
or reading, always while drinking hot chocolate or tea. His friends weren't around, the other Ravenclaws tolerated him but he didn't dare talking with them more than was necessary, he didn't want his father to dispise him even more. Apart from sending a thank you letter for the presents he hadn't been in contact with his parents; he had nothing he wanted to tell them and he didn't want to ruin their vacation without him. And of course he would never talk to Potter again. That idiot had gotten him into trouble with his stupidity. If his father would ever hear about this...
Slytherin started to cheer and stomp loudly until the headmaster silenced them again.
(See the end of the chapter for
After that, in Draco's opinion, hilarious incident, Charms was over in a swish. As soon as the bell rang he was out of the classroom and rushing down towards the dungeons for potions. After all those weeks he was quite looking forward to brewing something again. He had always found it to be an exciting and likewise meditative praxis.
And he really needed to talk.
There was no holding back at the Gryffindor table anymore as the great hall was suddenly decorated with Gryffindor banners. Gryffindor had won the house cup. Disappointment could be read in all the faces at the Ravenclaw table. Still, they were all clapping out of respect. With two exceptions: Harry was clapping and cheering very enthusiastically, genuinely happy for his friends; the other was Draco Malfoy who was not clapping at all, looking at least as angry as his Slytherin friends.

Draco was confused.
"Malfoy! Wake up! M-DRACO!"
Harry was even more confused. “You will?”
"Longbottom! What is your fat arse doing out here after curfew? Professor Snape will have a field day when I tell him about it and he will take loads of points from Gryffindor for it!"
It was the captain.
Before Harry could get confused about who was leading, Draco had placed both his hands on Harry’s shoulders. Once again, Harry cursed his uniform. While it would have been an extra distraction, Harry wouldn’t have minded feeling them through his unnecessary shoulder-pads.
Doing homework in the library in almost total silence was a far stretch from what Harry would describe as fun and it definitely wasn’t more fun than teasing Draco into smiling or laughing (his lower eyelids – were they called that? – would rise up, turning his irises into tiny suns setting behind equally tiny hills) but he’d prefer it over being harassed by Snape any day.

Clearwater lead them over to the opposite end of the room and said:
Gently he placed his hands on Draco’s waist and they easily started dancing to the slow rhythm of the music.
Why couldn't his parents just let him go to Durmstrang?
Marietta looked like she'd been waiting for him to ask that question all along.
Drifting off in thought his eyes caught platinum blonde hair reflecting the sun which stood high in the enchanted ceiling. Malfoy's eyebrows were drawn together in something that looked like a mix of concern and curiosity as he was talking to his friends. They still hadn't exchanged a word since the... incident.
His father had taught him.
Right.
let me finish! Following him around would be too obvious, but we could at least take a look into his office, maybe we'll find something there!"
“What?!”
They were welcomed by a terrifying view.
But deep down he knew this wasn't the way he felt.
With a sigh Charlie forced himself to turn away and shut down the worrying for the rest of the night. He could come by to check in again tomorrow morning. Now, his family was waiting.
Malfoy stopped laughing but the mockery in his face was still blatantly clear. “Oh, yeah? And what?” Harry tried and failed to give an equally snarky remark. Apparently, Malfoy didn’t feel like granting him a few extra moments for his brain to catch up. “Well, whatever it is, I doubt it will help you fix…” - he vaguely gestured at Harry’s body - “…all of that. Tell me, when was the last time you picked up a comb?”
Fear and adrenaline muffled the voice in his back.
"Are you kidding me? What kind of wizards could treat the boy who lived like that?"
Ron slid a hand through his hair and gulped. Then he nodded.
Everything would be fine he just needed to get into the bathroom.
"Ah, hullo Harry! Wanna come over for a cuppa?"
Cheers erupted at the Gryffindor table and Harry flashed Ron a wide grin.
And he was gone again.
like the fact that McGonagall had the ability to turn into a cat.
Aria blinked at him before turning her attention to Hannah's embarrassed grimace.
"Hannah, I er…I'm not so sure I'm comfortable giving you advice about something as personal as your sex life. It's a little creepy, to be honest." She admitted, wincing.
"It's a device muggle children use to play games."
Left with no other choice (not to mention how she was magically
For a while, the room was filled with the incredibly lewd, wet sounds of flesh hitting flesh, intermingled with their vulgar moans as they fucked like two animals in heat, with Draco slamming himself frantically against her like a drunken sailor and Aria clawing at his back, urging him to go faster with her rapturous sighs and the filthy words she whispered into his ear.
Aria moved to step in between the two boys again but it was much too late this time.
Hermione, thank you!" Ron grinned widely, instantly cheering up, and he gave Hermione a quick hug and kiss on the cheek.
Hermione sighed and leaned back against him. "But at the risk of inciting a faction war between the vampires and the veelas?"
Blaise stopped behind Aria's chair and patted her lightly on the shoulder.
"Tryouts ended last week." Draco answered her in a nonchalant tone of voice, ignoring the look of confusion on her face. "The team's already been assembled. This is quidditch
Aria couldn't help wincing at Neville's question as she followed him, Luna, Ron and Hermione into the Great Hall later that evening. As they pushed through the doors, she let out a sigh of exasperation and subconsciously pushed her long braid impatiently over her shoulder.
Her surprise was short-lived, however, because a few seconds later, Aria's eyes narrowed, and the smile on her face became vicious.
"Is that so?" He couldn't help but arch his eyebrow higher at her, a small knowing grin beginning to curve the corner of his lips.
He nodded towards the center of the hall, and Draco followed his gaze.
She figured it was the best decision anyway, especially since Ron and Hermione would be spending their break separately with their families this year. Of course, as expected, they
They arched an eyebrow and considered her words for a few seconds before answering her with a noncommittal shrug.
Wincing in pain, Draco pointed his wand at her again and tried to stun her but Aria just raised her hand, disarming him and summoning his wand into her palm. He watched in horror as her clawed fingers tightened around his wand, snapping it in half before she tossed the pieces to the ground by her feet.
She caught the firecracker in mid-air and automatically flung it back in the direction where it came from, inadvertently saving herself – and the rest of her unsuspecting Slytherin housemates behind her – from a string of harmless (though particularly annoying) hexes and jinxes that were meant to last the entire morning.
"This is all very ridiculous." Morag finally acknowledged them all with a heavy, irritated sigh. She looked up and glared at Hannah over her glasses. "Hannah, if you're really serious about making your pathetic, sissy boyfriend pay more attention to you,
Draco arched an eyebrow; and his eyes flicked to her arms in belated realization.
"I'm...
"Ah, Mister Zabini! You found her!" Slughorn boomed happily when Blaise and Aria finally reached them, his attention immediately drawn to the cringe on Aria's face.
"I'm sorry too." He said softly, giving her a contrite look. "I never should have written down your name or kept your feather; and I never should have kept it a secret from you. If it wasn't for me, Fisher would have never been able to hurt you, and you probably wouldn't have been forced to out yourself to everyone like this."
"Peace offering?"
Satisfied that nothing seemed to be missing, Draco rolled his eyes in mild annoyance and began shoving all of the books into his bag.
"That's not funny." Aria growled.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sorry we took so long." Pansy ignored the nervous cringe on Hannah's face and shoved her forward. "Hannah, you've met Theodore Nott before haven't you?"
Draco knew that none of them were likely to gossip about him and Aria to the other houses anyway. One of the most well-kept, unspoken rules of being in Slytherin was that you weren't supposed to gossip about your housemates to anyone outside your house. Not that Draco was afraid to reveal their relationship to anyone or anything, but he and Aria hadn't exactly talked about whether she was okay with going public about dating him yet, and he certainly wasn't about to embarrass himself by being the one to bring it up.
He felt warmth seeping into his cheeks at the intense way she was suddenly staring at him, her bright green eyes impossibly wide as she seemed to scrutinize each and every single one of his features. Draco was a little taken back when he saw the barely concealed amusement on her face.
Draco gave her a grateful nod and took off, Blaise and Pansy close at his heels.
Draco blinked and stared absent-mindedly at the envelope in her hands.
Aria ignored Draco's shrill protests and reached up, tying half of her long, bed-tousled hair up into a messy bun on the top of her head. "Blaise did say that the party is about to start, so I'm going to take a shower."
"Hmm…Let's see." Blaise chuckled gleefully to himself and pretended to consider her question.
Shaking his head, he decided to follow their lead and finally set off, making his way through the castle towards the Hufflepuff Common Room. He passed by several more couples along the way, including Granger and Weasley, Daphne Greengrass and Seamus Finnigan, and even Millicent Bulstrode and a burly Hufflepuff boy named Wayne Hopkins.
Aria held a hand out, waiting patiently as the red-headed veela sitting to her left handed her a thick white folder. Smirking, Aria turned her attention back to Rita Skeeter as she flipped the folder open, scanning lazily through its contents.
Ever since the war ended, Draco had pretty much grown used to people hating him anyway. The looks had grown even more callous after he was acquitted by the Ministry. So, frankly, being the most despised person in the room had simply become a normal part of his life now.
And it wasn't a situation he intended to remedy anytime soon; at least not until he was able to look back on all of the horrors he experienced as a Death Eater without feeling a surge of bitterness toward the man.
"Oh for Merlin's sake, Ronald. Don't be such a child, we did no such thing! Just because Aria and I are in different houses now, it doesn't mean we left you!" She huffed, shaking her head in annoyance.
Draco heard loud footsteps from behind before Blaise finally approached them, his eyes darting back and forth between his two housemates in amusement. Smirking, he placed himself directly in between them before turning to Potter and giving the dark-haired girl a reassuring wink.
Draco's scowl only deepened at her answer. He continued to glare warningly at the people still watching them until Aria smiled and shook her head.
"…Oh."
"It was Draco."
you hate, Potter?"
"Like I said, Potter. I won't tell."
"It's bloody freezing outside, Potter. Now just take the damn sweater and cover yourself up. You don't want to give everyone here a bloody peep show of your legs when you sit back down." He snapped irritably, blushing in spite of himself when he noticed the way she was staring at him.
The words were spoken softly, without any hint of mirth or teasing in them, but Draco recognized them easily, and he was overwhelmed with a wave of
of us to take is, unfortunately, to follow Zabini's asinine, cheesy efforts and try to get along as best as we can. At least until the year is over and we can all get on with our lives." She told them in an unceremonious tone of voice before nodding to herself in affirmation and giving them all an all-knowing, superior look.
He didn't bother waiting for either of them to answer before he turned and practically fled the pub, rushing towards the exit doors and slamming them noisily behind him. As soon as he was gone and they were the only two customers left inside, the girl beside him sighed and turned to give Draco an exasperated glare.
His thrusts picked up, harder and harder, faster and faster, and she began moving her hips backwards to match his movements, but his pace was becoming more and more erratic. Just when Aria thought she couldn't take anymore, Draco shoved his hand between her legs, his breath hitching as he felt where their bodies were joined before he found her clit again, stroking it in a circular motion in time with his thrusts. His other hand dug into her hair and he
"Pansy, just let it go—"
"Well, that's a relief." Neville looked visibly relieved as he walked over to them and gave her a sardonic grin. "Now I know that there'll be at least
Aria waited until Draco saw Ron and Hermione dancing a couple of feet away from them; the newly wedded couple looking so blissfully in love and completely engrossed with each other that they obviously weren't aware anymore of anyone else around them.
"Thanks for that." Draco glared at him, raking a self-conscious hand through his disheveled blonde locks. "I've just been busy since my ministry trial, alright?" He grumbled.
"Why not?" Greg blinked at her and shrugged, tucking the card carefully back into his pocket. "I just said that it's
As the 8th years were somewhat of an anomaly that year, it didn't make sense to have them resorted with the other students in the Great Hall. Luckily, the sorting hat remembers
"Yes, I bought a flat in a muggle neighborhood."
Instead of answering, Aria scowled at her in challenge and tried to climb out of the bed again.
"What do you mean?" Hannah asked as she looked up and stared at her in shock.
Afterwards, they promised to spend the rest of the evening together (Aria had even hinted, using that seductive voice of hers, that she was going to make the wait worthwhile for him); and already Draco was getting agitated, wanting nothing more than to speed through the Ball, and his time with Astoria, as fast as possible.
"I'm okay with it."
"Alright, that's enough out of you, kid." Ron's left eye twitched and he met Aria's teasing smirk with another irritated glare before he shook his head and set the end of his broom down briefly onto the grass. "Anyway, what's up? Why are you two here?" His narrowed gaze flicked back to Aria and he pretended to give her a suspicious glare.
From where she sat beside Greg, Astoria looked up and distracted Hannah from the way all of the men were still laughing by giving her a reassuring smile. "Speaking of wedding planning, I heard you hired Pansy as your coordinator too, Hannah? I swear, she's an absolute godsend. She's the one who's been helping me organize all the details for
obviously!"
Corey also didn't have the perpetual scowl on his face that his older sister always seemed to have. Instead, as Pansy was introducing him to Aria, the brown-haired boy beamed up at her and rewarded her with a bright smile before extending his hand out to her in greeting.
"Will do. Thanks, Hagrid." Aria gave him one last reassuring smile and wave.
"Aria."
"Instructor Delacour will be your first guest lecturer for this class. She only has enough time to give us a brief introduction today, but she'll continue with a more detailed discussion of the topic next week." McGonagall noticed the way most of the boys were still staring dumbly at Fleur and sighed, shaking her head in exasperation.
"I am
"I—I wasn't crying!
Just as they reached the middle of the room, they were forced to stop when they inadvertently ended up running into Neville and Pansy. The other couple had been making their way towards them from the other side of the Chamber.
"Well to be fair, the pink shade would go really well with her complexion." Morag offered as she looked up and studied the gown in Hannah's left hand. "But to be honest, Pansy's right. The design is a bit too flashy. Maybe you should try looking for something that doesn't look so…" She paused as she tried to think of the right word.
Malfoy sneered at him but took the shot glass and brought it to his lips.
hours getting ready, I am not about to let you mess that up." She scoffed, managing to push him away from her just before a group of 5th years entered the common room.
"Skeeter." She greeted stiffly.
At her words, the soft, bitter laugh that left Draco's lips sounded almost resigned.
With a growl, Aria shoved him away and jumped off the counter, furiously trying to fix her disheveled hair back up as she stalked towards the doors. Laughing, Draco rushed after her and grabbed her wrist to prevent her from walking away.
"Why?"
"No."
Aria froze, and she blinked at him, as though she wasn't sure she had heard him correctly.
." Hermione answered with a defeated sigh. "But what exactly are you planning to do—"
At first, Draco stood there, stunned and completely frozen in place as he stared down at her irate expression.
"Is this somehow related to Aria being a veela?"
Morag suddenly raised her hand. "Does the fixation always have to be an object? Is it possible for a vampire to fixate on a person?" She asked.
"Exactly how many times—?"
Draco stared blankly at her.
Aria blinked a couple of times and gaped at him.
"Parkinson, you
With a dramatic sigh, Draco turned to Aria and gave her an appraising look.
sort of link to the Death Eaters and Voldemort. Even I think it's beginning to be a bit unreasonable as of late—"
"You probably wouldn't want to burn
"So you're…
He declared loudly with a firm shake of his head before he turned back to watching the flying Gryffindors through the window.
“Okay, let's go! For fairness reasons everyone will use one of the school brooms.”
The following silence was filled to the brim with tension. Harry was about to strike up a conversation about work or something when Pansy picked up her empty glass with one hand and grasped Luna’s wrist with the other.
would hardly be anywhere close to quick but he also had a gut feeling that he really ought to get to his dorm.
) but at least they didn't question what he was saying like Blaise sometimes did. The dark skinned boy had been sitting in the corner of the same room with Theo Nott, occasionally throwing weird glances at the three of them. After quite some time the portrait hole had opened to reveal Pansy and Daphne Greengrass. When they had spotted Draco in the Center of attention, the latter had scrunched her nose and excused herself to bed while the former girl had joined their group excitedly. In the beginning they had talked about how Dumbledore had been missing at dinner and thought up theories as to why that was. Soon they'd ended up only insulting their headmaster and this school in general and how Durmstrang was way superior. More than once Draco had stood up saying he needed to get back before curfew even though he'd been having loads of fun but Pansy had always insisted he should stay a little longer.
But he was a git!
"Are you deaf?! Get started! Now!"
It was a disappointment to see that Harry calling him by that name failed to turn the tips of Draco’s ears red at this point. Instead, Draco simply sighed at the interruption and looked up. Okay maybe that was better than seeing him get embarrassed. Harry was proud of the progress he’d made.
+(-)+(-)+(-)+
Draco jumped and almost fell out of his seat. Lost in his thoughts he hadn't realized that the sorting had started.
The boy who had once defeated the greatest wizard of all times had just saved him.
They said the last sentence in perfect unison.
, not caring about how close to curfew it was. A cup of peppermint tea was awaiting him on the table and he sat down on the couch in front of it while the door fell shut behind him.
"You don't know Michael Jackson? I thought you're living with muggles?"
"Here, take a look!"
Outrageous, Harry opened his mouth to argue - he hadn't even said a word - but closed it again. This was no good anyways and it would only cost him even more house points.
It took Harry a solid five minutes to realize he wouldn’t come up with anything better, before he crossed the room as well. He pulled out the chair next to Blaise, sat down and waited for their reactions. Malfoy looked at him as if he were an alien. Blaise raised one of his immaculate eyebrows and then simply went back to work with an amused expression. When Harry turned to Draco again, he was still staring. Harry felt embarrassment crawling under his skin.
