"Neville helped me," Harry says, watching for Malfoy's reaction. He just yawns again, turning on his side to curl up.
"Do you ever not need to shop for something?" Harry asks, stretching.
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco murmured, skimming through the front-page article. He put his hand on his bump, feeling a small fluttering as the baby reacted to his nervous energy. “Your other daddy has been talking to Barnabus Cuffe,” Draco told them, flipping the cover over to read the rest of the article. “He’s an entirely endearing prat. Don’t you dare be this impulsive.”
But by Saturday morning, something from the trip is still niggling at Harry, like a raspberry seed stuck in a back tooth and no matter how Harry presses he can't dislodge it.
amongst pure-bloods to have French elves. And my many failures as the Malfoy heir were served as often as the coq au vin. And also—"
Harry pushed inside, deeper and deeper, and Draco whined with a pleasure that grew with every depth Harry conquered. “Another finger,” Draco demanded, covetous and lusting. “Loosen me up, Harry.”
Harry bows with flourished affectation. "After you, Your Most Excellent Wanker."
“Harry,” Draco said, sitting down on the cover on his bed. Bloody hell, but his voice was shaking. “Harry, it’s me, and- Circe, I don’t even know what time it is, and I know I walked away from the Café today, but-”
"Am I supposed to believe you're full of regret now? You've had a change of heart?"
They enter a little shop Harry's never noticed before called Quincy's Quality Quilts. Inside it's brightly lit with neat rows of fabric stretching so far ahead of them Harry knows the space must be magically enhanced. It looks like Harry could walk the distance of the Quidditch pitch and not reach the end of the fabric displayed. He thinks there should be brooms available to browse from.
"What?" Malfoy says, bleary eyed and confused.
.” She looked briefly at Harry. “This’ll be your first time,” Hayes added, addressing him. “Has Draco described the spell to you in much detail?”
and Malfoy sits up blinking slowly while the Healer tells them the findings of the several tests they've conducted since last night.
He settled down in a chair in front of her desk, and the two of them went through a gamut of basic questions: age, vaccinations and medical history. Apart from a couple of old Quidditch injuries Draco was in textbook health, and Mediwitch Hayes seemed pleased with all of his answers.
"What's this?"
He could do this. Week in, week out, Draco straddled his Nimbus and kicked the ground away in front of thousands of baying, screaming Puddlemere United fans. Harry was just one man. Draco could do this.
Draco wondered, for a moment, whether he’d never woken up from his nightmare. How could Harry sit there, and say these things so casually? There had been plenty of low moments in Draco’s life, but this has to count as the worst. His hands felt clammy once more and he wished, fervently, that he could, for once, act like a normal person around Harry Potter.
Without warning, Harry placed his hand, ever so gently, on the round bump and spreading the span of his fingers wide. Draco huffed out a breath, taken completely by surprise by the sudden touch, and Harry pulled his hand away, speedy as a hex.
“Merlin,” she said, spelling her tape to fly around his middle, and take his width, “what a splendid bump you’ve got already! How many weeks along are you?”
Harry buries his head in his arms on the table.
"Time well spent."
"Oh hey, Harry. How are you?"
“You don’t understand,” Draco repeated, though he wasn’t sure what he was trying to say. “My trousers don’t fit! I’m
"So fancy fish and chips."
His Mother only laughed at that; a light, joyous sound. “And when have I ever been wrong about such things Draco?” she asked, ringing her bell to summon Adrianne to remove their plates. “A new baby daughter, precious not because of her family name or for the value of her dowry, but simply for who she is. The most loved baby in the world.”
He looks at the bathtub with curiosity. It’s a thing of beauty, it really is. Bigger than any that Harry has ever seen, a beautiful swirl pattern of pink and beige veins through white marble. Harry traces the edge with his index finger just to feel the cold stone.
Malfoy sprinkles a couple more pinches of salt and tastes it again, this time smiling that small pleased smile Harry is starting to recognize.
and all the while Harry's brain is still unhelpfully shouting,
"Right-o. Let's drink some tea."
"No, of course not. Nothing but spotless moral perfection satisfies the Savior. I'm sorry to be such a blot on your character." Malfoy angrily dumps flour into a mixing bowl causing a cloud of it to puff up.
“Ah. Right,” he starts. “Look, you’re gonna fuck up on the Northern Lights trip. In fact, you’re going to fuck up a lot. He really is still Draco Malfoy. You’ll clash and argue and you’ll make up just as fiercely. It’s going to be particularly bad on that trip. He’s been waiting for it all his life. Not much you can do about it. Just fix it, right after. You’ll know how.
Harry doesn't say so but he's glad it's porridge and not cold cereal. It's only that Malfoy's porridge really is more delicious. Today it's got toasted walnuts sprinkled over the top and a pile of something very orange and very goopy.
"It's persimmon preserves. You've never had a persimmon?"
"You're such a shit," Harry says, nursing his left hand.
"Okay, this is insane. I need the Hermione who punched Malfoy. Have you seen her?"
Draco cradled his teacup of chamomile tea – the only hot drink he could currently stomach – and tried to think, as clearly as he could, about what his options were.
Dinner was takeaway out from the local Chinese restaurant. Draco was pleasantly surprised to discover that his appetite, hidden deep in the doldrums for the last few weeks, suddenly re-emerged when Millie served him up a big plate of sweet and sour vegetables and spring rolls.
God bless Ronald Weasley, Harry thinks, for just knowing. Harry opens his mouth, feels like the words are caught in his chest, and closes it again, shaking his head.
"Bloody thrill junkie. Always endangering yourself. Just play Quidditch like the rest of us."
"Yeah," Ron says, "It's nice and wet, juicy even."
"Shut up," Harry says, but he leans up for a kiss, and then another and another until Malfoy says he really needs to feed Yip dinner.
Well. He did say he’d allow himself one more day. Petrol is soft and warm against him and the bedsheets, pillows and duvets smell sweet and fresh, like lemons and pine.
"No, you get fancy farm boxes from Italy delivered to your home. That's not the same."
The war inside Harry’s head sees this as a win to the curiosity side. The safety side would have left the room long ago, would have found the spare room, or the sofa in the living room or many of the other places he could sleep in that night. But curiosity wants to see more of this Other Harry and his Draco, so Harry takes the free space on the armchair and settles himself into it comfortably, once Draco is back in bed.
Draco eases himself out from under Harry, who sleeps on undisturbed, and slips on his dressing gown and slippers. Draco pads down the hall to the kitchen wondering what he'll make for breakfast. It ought to be something special, but Draco doesn't have enough time to make morning buns. He did however remember to bring his produce basket with him last night, anticipating the pleasure of unpacking it knowing Harry was still asleep in bed.
When he got to the end of the letter, Draco tapped the parchment with his wand. It flew to the front of his larder and stuck there, at eye level.
Draco sat there in silence, and played with the strap of his watch. Goodness, but what had he been thinking, wearing a yellow shirt? He grimaced. He likely looked like a monstrous bloody blancmange! Taking out his wand, Draco cast a
Draco allowed himself a smile at Harry’s shyness. “Jolly well ought to. It's my kitchen,” he replied. “I’ve lived here since I left Hogwarts. If you want to make yourself useful then you can pour the tea. Mine is the chamomile. There’s milk in the fridge.”
“I’m sorry, baby girl,” a mimic of Other Harry. Harry is quite sure he’s never in his life called anyone, human or cat, “baby girl.” He giggles to himself at the realisation.
"It's good isn't it?"
"I can't even keep track of why you're mad at me. Pick one thing and stick with it."
"Ron's working on it."
Ron chews slowly, looking thoughtful.
He turns the corner into a new aisle and there's Neville, watering some meowing tiger lillies.
"Yes?" Harry asks, not sure what's compelling any of his speech in the last minute or so.
"What kind?"
Harry seemed quietly nervous as he took Draco on the grand tour of Grimmauld Place, though he was clearly enthusiastic about the home that he’d inherited from his Godfather.
In theory, telling Pansy Parkinson-Nott should have been easier than telling his Mother. Draco knew that Pans ought to be pleased for him. Draco was, after all, godparent to Cygnus and Pansy was the person who’d known him the longest in his life. His friend moaned often that she was the only one of their Slytherin gang who’d done any actual growing up, so the fact of Draco being pregnant should be manna to her ears. Cygnus and his little one would be playmates.
"Yeah, Harry. You've been getting along great with Malfoy at work."
"Hi," Harry says, feeling like maybe he should have put more effort into his appearance and worn some jeans without holes.
"Harry! Listen, I just had lunch with Hermione and we were thinking of having a housewarming party, what do you think?"
meant Draco’s belongings could all be packed away into two trunks, and Ron and Greg had carried those through the Floo. All that remained was for Draco to do was collect his coat, his satchel and say his goodbyes to the place. He didn’t take long about it though.
if you wish.”
“Just as long as they don’t get my hair,” Harry replied, chuckling wetly. “Merlin, help them.”
"Come on, Malfoy," Harry grumbles under his breath.
Harry had written; words that made Draco’s heart clench.
Part of Draco expected Harry to pull away, but he didn’t. He didn’t move, or pull away, and then their lips were touching. Draco’s breath shook, and his pulse raced. It took Draco perhaps three seconds to realise that Harry wasn’t kissing him back. Hot disgrace and humiliation flooded through him and he ripped himself away from Harry’s touch.
"Seven Sickles for toast?" Harry says, aghast.
"You'll see."
“That’s the garlic,” Draco said, his comeback flimsy.
.” Harry put his arm around Draco’s shoulders, and then, all of a sudden, wrapped his arms around him, pulling him into a whole-hearted, and very reassuring hug. Draco buried his head into the thin cotton of Harry’s navy-blue Puddlemere tee-shirt, feeling quite justified in his foolish hormonal display.
"I'd never," Malfoy says, but he whispers the words into Harry's ear before gently biting and then sucking on Harry's earlobe. It might be the best thing Harry's ever felt. His hands tighten on Malfoy's waist.
“They look yummy,” Draco commented, burying his head in the crook of Harry’s neck and kissing the warm skin there. “I do so adore pancakes. You’re terribly domesticated, Harry. That’s the reason I’ve moved in with you. Your cooking skills. Your cooking skills, the sex, and
Once again Harry tries to draw a straight line from the Malfoy who broke Harry's nose to the Malfoy who holds Harry's hand and gets lost along the way. Malfoy says Harry wants him to suffer to prove he deserves to be happy now. And Harry's not sure he doesn't. He doesn't know how else to judge that Malfoy's changed except to see if he feels badly about the things he's done, to wonder if there's guilt or shame lurking under the defiant front Malfoy puts up whenever Harry talks about their past. What else is there, besides regret, to prove improvement?
His heart was thumping in his chest. He’d forgotten something, something of great consequence, but for the life of him he couldn’t remember… It was only when he caught sight of himself in a mirror that a stark, horrible awareness dawned upon him. He’d forgotten his baby. Put her down, and left her, and…
“Then Firecall beforehand so you can try to talk me out of it?” Draco suggested, impudently.
a couple. We’re friends, having a baby together. A bond doesn’t have to follow a pregnancy, like night follows day.”
Harry thinks about Thestrals and rock cakes and Malfoy all weekend. He doesn't know how to fit this piece of Malfoy into the larger puzzle. He arrives at Malfoy Manor on Monday morning hoping there's breakfast and determined to figure out Malfoy's motives.
Other Harry doesn’t react to the use of his last name with anything other than a smile.
"I guess that is a bit comforting."
Leading the way, exactly as Harry had requested, Draco couldn’t resist giving his hips a wriggle; tonight, he felt seductive and shameless. In only minutes Draco was pushing open the door of his bedroom,
The only silver lining was the plan that Greg had suggested.
"But what about dessert?" Harry asks. To which Malfoy says Harry is getting spoiled. Though if Harry's not mistaken, he says it rather fondly.
"Oh Jesus Christ, stop. No one is allowed to talk about this until I've had my sodding toast."
"Alright, fine! It's bloody Malfoy. If you were with him from 9 to 5 you'd have some complaints too."
Harry feels shame warming his cheeks. Not only is he crouching in some rose bushes like a pillock, he hasn't made time to see Luna in months.
"No, more like, some of the stuff you grow up with, that you really believe, you don't even really think about. Like me and house-elves."
It's just a house. A stupidly posh mansion of a house, where all the plants along the drive have withered and died, presumably from the evil that soaked into the ground or whatever, but just a house. A house with a dumb wrought iron gate two stories high that won't open.
"It's a start! It's what Hagrid deserves!"
"Are you coming?"
"Come on. Did Malfoy cry?"
"He made me dal makhani," Harry says miserably.
Harry takes a scalding sip and finds it does ground him a little, if only because he's thinking about his burnt tongue for a moment instead of Malfoy's head lolling lifelessly on his shoulders like a cut string puppet. The solace doesn't last long, but he keeps sipping, it's something to do while he waits.
Bill works with them through the afternoon, unshrinking massive four poster beds and chaise lounges and fancy end tables and giant vases, and at 4:00 asks Harry if he can get the last few bits of furniture because he's due back at Gringotts for a meeting. Harry agrees and Bill claps him on the shoulder, telling him not to have too much fun and he'll see him at the Burrow Sunday.
Harry complains that his feet hurt, that his bank account is suffering, that Malfoy won't stop pulling on his arm, but he loves his bedroom. The walls are a creamy white and the bed curtains are a gauzy golden color, the quilt from Ms. Quincy is white with lillies blushing pale pink and gold in shifting patterns. What's left of the room that isn't covered by the big white carved bed frame is covered with Harry's bright rug. Harry's never had a room of his own before, and he loves this one.
"What's your point?"
"That's a lot of cupcakes."
"I don't think I feel that way," Harry says, only realizing as he's saying it how true it is. He's not sure how he was expecting Ron to react, but it's not the wry smile he's getting now.
Harry doesn't know where to start. Being around Malfoy brings up all kinds of complicated stuff Harry doesn't particularly want to think about.
Draco did so, untucking his shirt-tails and unclipping the clasp on his trousers. It felt satisfying to finally be free of their constrictions, and he huffed out a sigh. The witch chuckled at the sound, opening the notebook and tucking her quill behind her ear.
Opening the pantry, Draco passed a bottle of fizzy Pumpkin Juice out to Goyle and took one for himself. The two of them sat down in front of the tidy plates of sandwiches.
"But—"
Harry does not ask about rouxs, it would probably just be another answer he wouldn't understand.
"Yes! On the fellytone!"
"Just the eggs and yeast," he says nervously.
, what precisely do you mean by kissing? There’s the sort you give to your maiden aunt, and the sort that you give to your betrothed.”
Malfoy smiles softly, his perfect cinnamon rolls smile like he knows what Harry's thinking. "Cake first. Now start casting."
Instead, Harry eases back into Malfoy's side with his cup of tea. It's a fancy spiced chai tea Malfoy got him and it's delicious with milk and sugar. It's hard to feel guilty about not participating more, with his warm drink in his hands and Malfoy holding him, rubbing small circles over his ribs. It's hard to feel anything but comfort.
When the bowl is empty Harry curls into Malfoy's chest, and Malfoy plays with Harry's hair, threading his fingers through it in such a soothing rhythm Harry dozes a little, not quite sleeping.
"Your legs are so long," Harry says, one hand on Malfoy's bony ankle, the feel of which somehow has Harry short of breath. He traces his fingers over the knob of bone and Malfoy shifts his leg up just a little higher. Harry's never snuggled like this before. The few moments Harry had with Ginny were snuck away in Hogwarts corridors, not in the private comfort of his own soft bed, the whole night his to be hugged and held close. It feels so wonderful Harry finds himself humming and nuzzling under Malfoy's chin, pressing little kisses to Malfoy's neck.
“That’s their heartbeat,” Hayes said gently. “It’s very strong. I’m just going to return your notes, gentlemen. I’ll be back in two ticks. I’ll give you both a minute.”
Harry is stunned. He crumples the kale leaf he was angrily ripping off the stem in his fist, staring at Malfoy and all he can think to say is, "No they're not."
Elianna’s third letter arrived three days after that. Draco petted the sweet girl, and opened the parchment with a sense of resignation. It seemed that ignoring Harry simply wasn’t working.
"I'll tell her you said that. I think she'll be pleased."
Today wasn’t a date. It was a simple case of acclimatisation. He needed to get used to Harry through small, incremental steps. Today was simply the first footstep on a very long journey.
Finally, he looks up at his friends.
"Don't be an idiot," Malfoy says. He's already closed his eyes again. He tugs weakly at Harry's hand. "Get in," he says, a little slurred.
Somehow, without Harry noticing how, Malfoy ends up in front of Harry's flat again. They have Harry's loaf of crackly bread and Draco's impulse buy of vanilla bean custard filled kouign amann with them and Draco is asking Harry for tea and Harry doesn't know how to say no. He also doesn't know if he wants to say no.
"Alright, alright. Weirdo."
"You can't jump down my throat."
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, as soon as Judith paused for breath. “I’m sure that St Mortimer’s Place has a million charms, but it simply isn’t for me. I’d feel discourteous if we were to continue our tour.”
"Where the hell am I?" Harry says.
“First things first,” she said, her quill springing into action and scribing her every word. “Draco, how have you been? Is everything okay with you and the baby? Any niggling worries or concerns?”
"But that's your mum. Not Draco Malfoy. If I had told you a year ago that Draco Malfoy would serve me crepes and oranges at a little breakfast tête-á-tête you would've checked me over for potions."
Draco didn’t look up at Goyle. He couldn’t. Any movement of his head – any at all – and he knew that he’d be parting with the remainder of his breakfast.
having a baby,” Harry said, carding his fingers through her hair, “and you’re a clever little girl. The baby will come in December, not long before Santa Claus. The lady in the paper was wrong though. We aren’t boyfriends. We’re just very good friends that are having a baby together.”
There didn’t seem any point in sticking around after that. Greg paid the wizard without an inch of shame, making small talk about the Harpies' long reign at the top of the table like he brought pregnancy tests in the middle of the night every day of the week. Draco didn’t speak. He was pretty sure that whatever noises would have come out of his mouth would have been garbled nonsense anyway.
Harry and Luna walk to the forest, dropping chunks of meat as they go, the Thestrals following along.
Harry smooths his hands over Malfoy's chest. He can't explain it but he really likes the feeling of Malfoy's bony chest under his hands. He likes sliding his hands over Malfoy's chest up into the extremely soft hair at the nape of his neck.
So Harry gets Malfoy a fettuccine with a cheesy cream sauce, peas, and bacon. Harry actually feels grateful Malfoy is too picky to eat St. Mungo's food because it gives him a way to be useful. And he gets to see Malfoy's expression when he walks in the room with the take out container. Malfoy even manages to eat most of it before he falls asleep again.
subscription would be best."
"Monkey!" Harry says, avoiding eye contact. They've only been kissing, Harry's not ready to talk about the size of his cock with Malfoy. "So what makes your lasagna better?"
Harry didn’t seem to think so. The stag disappeared with a flare of green sparkles, and Draco watched as Harry Apparated into the space it had just vacated with a noisy pop.
“Excuse me?” Draco asked, voice small and frigid.
"I get the impression you ask out of a sense of misplaced and slightly begrudging obligation. Do you like helping?"
"I know how to pour water."
“You can’t say things like that,” Draco said, his entire body trembling with shock and upset. “You can’t- can’t just say these sentences like they’re innocent and meaningless. You’re a fucking wizard, Harry,” he managed. “You ought to know bloody better.” Draco reached for his wallet, and threw coins down blindly. Suddenly, he needed to get away from the café, and away from Harry with a violent determination. He’d go to the Manor, or to Pansy’s. Draco needed to be anywhere but here. Harry gave him a confused look, his eyebrows drawn close, his brow knitted. It was clear he wasn’t following the conversation. Bloody hell, but why was it so difficult to find the right thing to say? “Words matter.” Draco finally managed. “I’ve fallen in love with you and I have to get over that, Harry, because this baby –
Malfoy stiffly pours Harry a cup and then looks up at him for instruction on cream and sugar, his mouth set in a frankly ridiculous little pout that makes Harry want to laugh out loud.
Draco and Harry are gentle kisses and soft touches for the rest of the day, hushed whispers between them, faces nuzzling into necks and hair, hands cradling faces.
"Ah yes, the beguiling sweetness."
"It's not that unrealistic. I
All of a sudden, he was craving his bed like never before. Perhaps, when he woke, he’d discover the last six weeks had been nothing but a dream, and that he – and now their baby – hadn’t been Harry Potter’s big mistake.
Malfoy sighs. "Fine, Neville too."
"Do you remember when Hermione asked me what he'd have to do to be forgiven?"
Malfoy doesn’t take long in the bathroom but comes out fully dressed, with no sign of work robes. He bends down over Other Harry on the bed to kiss his face and when Harry groans again, he says simply, “Wednesday. Breakfast with Pansy before work. Get up soon or you’ll be late.”
Draco had to pull back when Harry found their way beneath his shirt. He felt the same way as he’d done only a week before, except he was bigger now and even had a couple of stretch marks to show for it.
"That's not how it works," Malfoy says, also laughing. He shifts to lay down and pulls Harry down with him, running his fingers through Harry's hair. "Least I've got one organ that wasn't damaged."
Malfoy rolls his eyes but it looks a bit fond this time. "You're not going to drop this are you?"
"Getting to kiss you."
Draco’s chest did a funny little pitter-pat, and squeezed tight, like he couldn’t breathe, but that was only for a moment.
Adorning the walls were some very nice pieces by very famous magic and Muggle artists, and Draco couldn’t help himself. He came to a full stop, examining a big, geometric canvas carefully. “Merlin’s beard, Potter,” Draco said, unable to keep the wonder out of his voice, “this is a genuine bloody
Draco nodded.
Draco didn’t think that he’d sleep much after that kiss – Merlin, he didn’t believe that he’d ever sleep again – but to his surprise he fell asleep, the second his head hit the pillow. No more awful dreams came to haunt him, and he woke up feeling better than he had in days.
Draco felt his words dry as the sight of Harry’s stag filled his bedroom. “Is everything okay?” the stag asked, Harry's voice sounding wide awake, and frantic. It was only then, with no remnants of his pain remaining, that Draco thought how this must look to Harry. There was no going back now. “Is it the baby?” the stag demanded, but before Draco could answer, it carried on speaking. “I presume you’re at home? I’ll come over right now.”
"I suppose I'm willing to give him a chance because I believe he can be quite kind."
but felt too nervous to actually read any of the articles. He was nervous, far more than he’d expected to be. Wizard pregnancies were notorious for being more problematic than those of witches and there were a dozen things that could go wrong.
He stood, and pushed open the bathroom door, all of a sudden desperate for space. The walls were closing in on him, and Draco collided with Greg as he fell into the bedroom. Goyle was quick off the mark though. The Beater grabbed hold of Draco’s shoulders, and steadied him. He led Draco across to his bed and sat him down on it.
"I notice you didn't argue with 'irritable' though."
"Why?" Harry asks.
He and the little one would be a family of two, and families needed houses. Draco supposed he could always move back to the Manor, but that idea didn’t appeal either. Their baby didn't deserve to grow up in such an austere environment. Decisions would have to be made, and sooner rather than later.
are still on the Board! They can vote in absentia!"
"Class B? He almost died," Harry very nearly shouts.
"How're the Thestrals?" Harry asks.
Pansy was the closest thing Draco had to a sister, and he loved her immensely, but she was a witch with headstrong opinions and a very sharp tongue. She’d never hesitated before sharing either of those with Draco before. Draco highly doubted that she would this time, either.
Harry grinned at Draco’s flippancy. “It’s a bit more than breaking bread. Molly’s roast dinners are feats of endurance, and she’ll take it as an insult if you don’t have at least two plates of seconds. Don’t eat breakfast! Are you sure that you’re ready for this?”
Harry calms his breathing and can finally make out some of the words being said, the fog in his head clearing, slowly.
Malfoy's lips crook up a bit like he can't help himself. "You'll see soon enough."
“Okay?” Harry asked, waiting for Draco’s consent, the blunt thickness of his prick nudging Draco’s entrance.
Harry can't help the smile. He hates demonstrative pity about his upbringing, or lack thereof more like. He doesn't want pity. He just wants to be able to talk about his life without inducing tears in his listener.
“How did it go? How do you feel?”
She sits at the table, glass of wine in one hand, quill in the other, reading from a four foot long roll of parchment while Malfoy stands in the kitchen chopping and stirring and saying things like, "The 1732 Dissolution of the Wizengamot is
"Decidedly sloppy, but not without merit."
But standing under the bright Italian sun, golden rolling hills dotted with poppies and rows of grape vines, Harry rather thinks cabbage is his favorite vegetable.
But as their chests rise and fall, as the sound of their breathing quiets the room, the exhaustion of his long work day and his unexpected visit to another timeline catch up to him. And Harry falls asleep, too, head falling backwards onto the soft back of the armchair, one socked foot escaping just slightly from under the cloak.
Picking up his wand, Draco flicked it through the air, focusing on all his best memories, casting an
The green drawing room was the biggest room of the suite and Narcissa’s personal headquarters. The antithesis of the forbidding, dark rooms that Father had preferred, the Left Wing wasn’t filled with the dark magical objects and taxidermied creatures. It was light, well-lit and airy, and very soon Draco found himself standing outside his mother’s door.
Malfoy drops his forehead onto Harry's shoulder and huffs a laugh. "Of course."
He was vomiting into Flint’s posh marble sink, and was entirely mortified about the fact. It had only taken one sniff of the bouquet decorating Marcus’s lounge to have him parting with his dinner.
“It is a great honour to see Master Draco visiting the Manor once again,” she smiled, holding her hands out for the bouquet. “Adrianne will be taking the flowers for Mistress Cissy. She asked that you please make your way straight through to the green drawing room. Luncheon will be served at twelve promptly. Would Master Draco be wanting a glass of his favourite Merlot?”
"You remembered," Malfoy teases softly, coming closer for a kiss.
"I said you should think I'm trying to be better for you."
The thought doesn’t last long. Other Harry is whining, Harry is trying not to. Draco’s gorgeous, long, pale fingers are dipping into Other Harry, Harry’s breath is coming out in quiet pants that shake his whole chest.
Harry shrugs. "What would you have done?"
“Does this feel good for you?” Harry asked, and Draco would have laughed at the obviousness of the answer. He didn’t though. He couldn’t. There wasn’t enough breath left in his body for that.
Harry looks at his watch. He's been with Malfoy all of ten minutes and already he could use a pint. At this rate he'll need upwards of a hundred to wash away the irritation.
Malfoy was hit with a curse, the Healer tells them, they're still unsure what exactly, because they've never seen it before, but the curse slowly eradicated most of Malfoy's red blood cells, resulting in damage to various organs that were deprived of oxygen. They stabilized Malfoy last night with an oxygenation spell which they will continue to cast as Malfoy's body slowly creates more red blood cells. They'll also be administering a course of potions to repair the damage to Malfoy's internal organs.
Harry doesn’t feel guilt about it — he knows he’s not learning anything about his future that he shouldn’t. In his world, there isn’t any chance that he’d ever call Draco Malfoy “babe” and even less chance that Draco Malfoy would call him ‘love’ and ‘sweetheart’ like he does here. His eyes roam over the two shapes under the duvet, unable to figure out where one ends and the other starts.
“Everything looks tip-top,” Mediwitch Hayes said, twisting and flicking her wand in a complex pattern as she measured and evaluated the baby. She gave Draco an unreserved smile. “You’ve got yourself a very healthy, very happy-looking baby. They are measuring exactly where I’d like them to for the dates that you’ve given me. Their heart, organs and the magical centre of their brain all look well developed… The placenta is in a good place and your waters look good. I’m very pleased.”
"You're like my siblings."
Malfoy squeezes his hand and let's go as they enter a tiny market shop with a few baskets of pristine vegetables, rows of eggs in soft greens and blues and a graying older man with a sour face behind the till.
"Huh," Harry says. "I didn't know they could do that."
"One or two wouldn't go amiss."
"S'fine, mate. Just saying some big things happened in all our lives. Big things like that can really change your perspective.
Draco did, glad that Arthur hadn’t told him simply to put his feet up. He took two mugs from the shelf. One was purple, with the image of a cat on it, the second chipped, with the outline of Buckingham Palace against a night sky. It was an odd thing to find in a wizarding household, but Harry had told him how much the older Weasley loved everything Muggle. He added teabags and listened to the bubble of the water.
"You like my hair," he says, teasing.
Malfoy gathers a few things from the cold cupboard and starts some butter sizzling in a pan, his back turned to Harry. He's taller than Harry remembers, and thinner, though it's perhaps because Harry's only ever seen Malfoy in Hogwarts robes, not the sweater and—sweatpants?—he's wearing now.
"I'm really, really sorry Malfoy, I should have realized sooner you were sick," Harry says, the words spilling out of him unfiltered.
for myself, so that we’ve got precise records of what we’re dealing with, but before I go ahead, I’d like to ask if you’ve considered your options?”
Draco allowed himself to be led, and he let Harry bustle and fuss around him, bringing him his shoes, wand, and the bag where he stored his notes while he waited by the fireplace. Harry looked a little bit flustered – his cheeks were red – and Draco felt the same way. He puffed out a few deep breaths, making a conscious effort to relax. He tried to convince himself that the bubbly, happy feeling and his elevated mood were due to the baby, and their imminent appointment, and absolutely not due to Harry Potter.
There wasn’t anything else that either Braithwaite or Draco needed to say. The Mediwix assured him that he’d owl St Mungo’s that afternoon, and that he could expect an appointment within the week. The three of them stood, and Braithwaite looked between Goyle and he. “You did the right thing,” the Mediwix said, putting out his hand for Draco to shake. “Many wizards avoid the obvious conclusion for far too long. There’s still a bit of a stigma, isn’t there, amongst professional sportsmen? You seem like a solid couple and- “
And yet, Draco hadn’t waited until he was older and wiser.
"There's something else."
"Fine?" Harry wonders.
Harry does not pretend he's asleep, but he does crawl back under the covers and wait for Malfoy.
"It's gorgeous, Potter. The only thing is you need to move the rug out from under the bed more. And perhaps some candles and fresh flowers would be a nice touch."
Mother would have noticed that he wasn’t drinking – she missed nothing – but she didn’t comment. Mother was complementary about Puddlemere’s final few performances, “although that infamous Louis St Clare doesn’t do your team any kindness with his notorious behaviours,” and congratulated him on the team’s position in the League. “Though I firmly believe you’d have finished far higher if you hadn’t been laid low for those final two games, Draco. A tragedy, really.”
"Not much time to. Stake outs, overtime, catching Death Eaters, etcetera."
"No, this is not a crisis. You are not currently being tortured by Death Eaters."
Harry pushes the cutting board toward Malfoy. He's unsure how he managed to lose this argument when he's so clearly right. Harry was so sure Malfoy should apologize to Hagrid but somehow Malfoy's muddled everything up.
"Have you always cooked a lot?"
It's a much more convincing argument to Harry when Malfoy is also sucking on his neck. Harry threads his hands into Malfoy's—extremely soft—hair to keep Malfoy's mouth at his neck and Malfoy is very obliging.
"I just can't believe I was teased by an eighty-year-old grandmother all through school."
"I'm being
Draco loves cinnamon roll dough. It's never too sticky like bread dough. It's soft; soft like Harry's cheeks under Draco's palms last night. He zests an orange, smiling as it releases a burst of scent. He mixes the zest with cinnamon and sugar and sprinkles it over the dough, then he sprinkles a little more.
Café Quendryth was every bit as packed as their previous visit, but miraculously their elf-waiter was able to secure them the same table as before.
"Falling asleep on the job?" Malfoy asks.
six."
Luna chatters on to Harry, telling him about the herd—how helping Hagrid care for the sick creatures has really been helping her as well, what she's named each of them, which of the Thestrals really like blackened bananas—as they walk them to the wooded area within the Manor wards.
Harry puts his arm around Malfoy and squeezes him closer. He knows he needs to choose his words carefully here. Harry still wonders what would be enough, what Malfoy would have to do for Harry to forgive him.
“Hey,” Harry says, and bends down slightly to pet its soft fur. The collar reads ‘Petrol’, and he smiles at the name as he scratches behind its ears and the cat chirps contentedly.
"S'not that bizarre. How much of it d'you think he really believed? I mean, he was saying 'you'll be next Mudbloods' in second year. What twelve-year-old actually thinks their classmates should die? You'd have to be a Voldemort-level psychopath."
He breathes in and out and then says, "So, dal makhani?"
He takes Harry to ceramicists (potters, Potter!) in the Cotswolds and Harry has speckled jugs and pitchers and creamers pressed into his hands until he decides on a sunny yellow creamer just to get Malfoy to shut up.
Harry rolls his eyes. Of course Malfoy would be high maintenance while sick. Harry leaves Malfoy in bed and goes down the three staircases and several corridors to get some tea sorted. When he brings it back up to Malfoy he finds him asleep again.
"D'you think a second year shouting 'you'll be next Mudbloods' actually wants their classmates dead? He probably thought he did and then the war. He saw what that actually meant. If anything could change a person's mind completely it'd be seeing the horrible shite we saw during the war."
Harry's hello is muffled as he's scooped up in a bone-crushing hug.
Ron chuckles. "Mate, you've been to the Burrow, you know what my family's like."
Then Harry smells coffee and Ron and Hermione don't drink coffee and neither does Harry but Malfoy does. He drinks fancy coffee he grinds fresh every morning. And he must have ground it fresh
"Did Kingsley say why he put you on that case?"
"Harry, you tried to give

and thus are crowding the living room instead of the built-in shelves. The cupboards in the kitchen are bare, even the cold cupboard, because Ron hasn't had a chance to drop by the Burrow and collect the food Molly made them, "just until you're settled in." They haven't even a sofa or a table, since they wanted to shop for those things all together.
bread."
"Look Potter! Apparently no one got the message that you're terrible at Potions."
Draco made a huffing noise. Pansy was too clever by half. He pitied Nott. The poor bloke could hardly have any secrets. “Mummy said it was a sacred union, blessed by Merlin,” Draco retorted petulantly, annoyed by the witch.
"Because I can't stand that, Potter. Nothing was ever good enough growing up and I'm not living the rest of my life that way. Especially not with you."
"You're quiet," Malfoy says.
Draco nodded, not wanting to blurt out his news immediately. There were social niceties to attend to first; small talk to make, and the impartation of gossip about the various wizarding families that both of them knew. Once luncheon was served, Draco planned to make his announcement. He wasn’t sure what sort of reaction to anticipate, but he hoped, desperately, that his mum would be pleased. She’d always been vocal about wanting a grandchild, and although this mightn’t be the circumstances that Narcissa – or he himself, for that matter – had envisioned, life had made other plans.
Their bodies mould against each other under the covers and Harry finds himself wanting more. He wants to see how they fit against each other. He watches Other Harry snake his hand under the duvet and pull Draco closer. Draco moves but Harry can’t tell what he’s doing, until Draco breaks away from the kiss and asks, quiet and sleep-lovely, “Yeah?”
When the time comes for visitors to leave Harry promptly ignores it, sitting under the invisibility cloak until the night Healer does her last check and then getting back into bed with Malfoy. Malfoy snuggles close to Harry with a happy sigh that makes Harry melt a little.
Harry was correct. Café Quendryth was posh. Draco had arrived early, not wanting to be late, red-faced and flustered, but that only meant that he was sat there, twiddling his wand.
“Says to get on your side,” Harry answered. He reached over and grabbed a spare pillow from beside Draco’s head. “Stick this under your belly.” Draco did so, moving the pillow around until he felt comfortable. He glanced back at Harry, feeling shy, but Harry kissed a line up Draco’s back, across his shoulders and over his jaw and, it wasn’t long before the desire of his lover made him forget his self-consciousness. Draco jumped once again when he felt Harry’s hand between his legs, lining himself and getting himself in position to push inside.
Harry looked up at him, all guileless green eyes, and Draco straightaway felt atrocious, crawling guilt.
Hermione squeezes Harry's hand. "You're not a Healer, Harry. How could you have known?"
“Nothing wrong with being prepared, dearie,” Molly said, nodding her approval at Harry. “Are the pair of you planning to live together at Grimmauld Place?” she pondered, “Harry, I know you said you wanted to change the guest room into a suite for the baby?”
"Good for you. You also have organ damage so you should probably eat something."
"Can you put a price on transcendence?"
At Other Harry’s breathless, “Yeah,” Harry realises he’s in for more than he bargained for.
Draco had found himself weeping at the sight of his Mother’s rose garden – he’d played there when he was little – and he’d sobbed at the sight of his body after a shower. At nineteen weeks his belly was as round as a cauldron, and Draco had decided there and then that nobody (namely Potter) would ever fancy him, not ever again.
“Racing brooms… Father of your child,” Greg smirked. “Same difference, really. You could never resist riding either. Now, be good, Malfoy, and if you can’t be good-” he said, breaking off the sentence so that Draco could complete it.
Harry is starting to realize that's true. Despite six years of interactions at Hogwarts, most of them awful, Harry really doesn't know that much about Malfoy. He didn't know Malfoy likes to make buckwheat biscuits and obsesses over cabbage. He didn't know Malfoy has been writing to Luna and Hagrid. He didn't know Malfoy has a little dog that obviously loves him.
"Haven't had much except for fish and chips. Once it's been fried it always tastes good."
'I would like for you to take luncheon with me at the Manor,” Mother’s last owl had read, “and I do so wish for your attendance. This blasted Muggle virus has kept you from coming home for far too many weeks, and it is an
Narcissa looked at him thoughtfully and, very deliberately, she placed her own cutlery on her plate.
Get up, and have a glass of water. That was all he needed. Sliding down from his mattress, Draco padded towards the bathroom, but only got as far as the landing. The little wriggle changed then, changed into something that felt like a Cramping Jinx squashing all of the muscles in his lower belly, and fuck but it
is the way to go. No, it's definitely best if Harry just focuses on his crepe. His gray crepe.
Two minutes and a vigorous teeth brushing later, Harry sticks his head in Malfoy's Floo and says, "Do you want to get dinner?"
The man behind the till looks up at Harry's words and, if possible, his expression turns even more sour.
Draco winced. He couldn’t tell Hayes to mind her own business. This was her job. “I haven’t told him yet either,” he answered. “That is- well- We’re not a couple. It was a one-time thing, and he told me he’s not looking for anything serious.”
“Nerves again?” Greg asked, flopping down on the settee.
Harry takes a few bites; the persimmon preserves are cloyingly sweet. "Think I like the apples better."
. Only you, Harry Potter, could describe works of art as mere pictures. If I owned a genuine Mondrian, I’d be telling the sodding milkman,” Draco said, coming to a standstill beside Harry. They were stood in front of a door made of knotty pine wood. “I assure you that whatever is behind that door won’t be even half as impressive. Maybe not even a quarter as impressive.”
Now though, their child’s life would be a negotiated thing. It’d be Floo calls, and separate holidays, and fitting in with new partners, and likely other children born along the way. It’d be co-parenting, compromise, and nothing more.
“You look so good like this,” Harry said admiringly. “The most beautiful sight I’ve ever seen.”
"What was that?" Harry asks.
Harry pays for his quilt, barely listening as Ms. Quincy tells him the pick up day and time. Back outside on the slushy streets of Hogsmeade, Harry takes several deep breaths of cold air hoping to clear his head but it doesn't work.
"We ate a lot of French food growing up. It was
Harry pierced a piece of broccoli and ate it before responding to Draco’s question.
Of all the reactions possible, Draco hadn’t expected such tenderness from his mother. He seized her hand as she leant forwards, and knitted their slender fingers together. “But you suspected before?” Draco asked, wondering whether his mother was part-seer. “I’ve hardly told anyone. Only Greg, Millie and… I’ve told the other father too. He knows.”
Malfoy whispers the words into Harry's cheek where he's nuzzling him, rubbing his nose softly against Harry's. Harry can now feel Malfoy's warm breath against his lips. Malfoy's hands move up Harry's chest, pausing to smooth over his clavicles, to rest at Harry's neck, cradling Harry's head. Malfoy scratches his fingers into the hair at the base of Harry's neck, sending tingles over his scalp and causing Harry to utter a small pathetic sound.
Harry leans against the bit of counter where the sink is and watches Malfoy. He smashes the garlic with the flat side of the knife and a gleeful smack of his hand. He smells the spices and then measures them in his palm. He fishes olives out of the jar with his fingers, popping one into his mouth and nodding happily.
you'd go back," Ron says through a mouth full of wheaties. "I don't know why we even took you home."
"If you really liked it you wouldn't have let me put it back. Why do you look like you're deciding what coffin to get?"
“I want it,” Harry exclaimed, impetuous and keen. “I can’t abide the idea of them having bad dreams, Draco. That’s the one. I knew it the moment that I saw it.”
Draco nodded. Seven weeks before. Any Puddlemere fan would know that was the day they’d lost so definitively to the Harpies, and Harry Potter would know it as the day he’d gotten another notch on his broomstick. None of that was any of Braithwaite’s business, though.
“One moment,” came the voice from within, muffled behind the wood. Harry rolled his eyes, made a wry face, and then the door swung open to reveal Molly Weasley. “Harry,” she exclaimed warmly, “you’ve finally brought your young man, and earlier than expected too! Dinner won’t be long, love. Just need to mash the potatoes and glaze the carrots. Come here and give me a hug!”
"Look, I think I'm on board there. He doesn't really talk about it but I'm pretty sure his dad was awful to him. And a part of me gets it. Like, he had terrible role models, he was manipulated by powerful and scary people, he was scared. But…"
Glaring at his mate, Draco flicked his wand and sent the magazine soaring back to the table where it lived. Bloody hell, but Greg was slovenly. Every so often, sharing digs with Goyle during Away matches felt like Hogwarts had never ended.
"I should have added the tomato sauce at least three minutes ago. The garlic is almost burnt. Go sit down, Potter, you're too distracting."
“Good morning, gentlemen,” Judith said, giving them both a moment to organise themselves after they stepped through the Floo. “I’m very happy to meet the pair of you. I can promise you that the homes we’re visiting today represent the best magical properties currently available on the market.” Her eyes drifted over Draco’s grey cotton shirt, and she smiled. “If a family home is what you’re looking for, you couldn’t have picked better than Whitsand Bay.”
"What's that mean?"
"Harry, no one is saying that—" Hermione starts, her voice irritatingly soft.
"Well, neither do I. My parents weren't exactly the perfect loving couple. I probably don't need to tell you my father is not a kind man."
Draco had to laugh. The last time he’d actually left Pansy speechless had been at Hogwarts. Her boyfriend at the time, a git of a Ravenclaw from the year above, had tried to kiss him, so Draco had hexed his mouth tight shut and cursed him with warts.
tee-shirts.'
Around dinner time Harry tries to shake Malfoy awake but his eyelids don't even flutter. Malfoy is even paler than usual, and the tip of his nose and fingers are blue. Harry's heart skips a beat and he tries again, lifting Malfoy's torso but his head just lolls back and forth disturbingly. Then Harry's crisis training kicks in and everything narrows to the series of tasks he must perform: he Summons his wand, levitates Malfoy and flat out runs through the corridors of the Manor to get outside to Apparate.
"I read."
"I know about all sorts of Muggle things," Malfoy says.
"You're kissing him now? Have you lost your mind?"
"As always," Harry says miserably.
Draco very soon realised that Harry hadn’t been joking when he’d stated The ‘Elfy Bakery would get sick of the sight of him.
“Mrs Zabini and Mrs Bulstrode too. Something to do with our horoscopes apparently. When a Gemini mates with a Leo, a girl is frequently the result.” Draco scraped the last of the sprinkles from the side of the glass. “I mean, I know it's an old wives’ tale, but there’s a fifty percent chance they’re correct. Girl or boy, it doesn't matter, really. It’s all our baby.”
"Well when you put it like that."
-henge.
It doubtless had something to do with the omnipresent hot-water bottle that was his tummy. There was clearly nothing to be done about that, and as he lay down on his settee, Draco decided the best course of action was to close his eyes and enjoy five minutes of Harry-Potter-themed day dreams.
“Just that I’m happy,” Harry said, frowning at the sudden frostiness of Draco’s manner. “A baby wasn’t what either of us were expecting,” Harry clarified, “and I certainly wasn’t sure that I was ready – that I’d
“We’re celebrating,” Harry said, before he leant over and found Draco’s lips. “Celebrating because I get to kiss you now, whenever I wish, and I’ve wanted to do that for a very long time.” Kissing, it seemed, was an activity that the pair of them were doing now, and Draco could only wonder how he was going to survive a long future where the two of them kissed on a regular basis. He wasn’t a hundred percent sure that his heart would be able to take it, but he was very prepared to take the risk. “Chicken Gratin. Molly taught me how to make it. Don’t tell her, but I think my version is better. More garlic.”
Malfoy sets a plate down in front of Hermione with a piece of lasagna and arugula salad on the side. "Thanks," she says. "And lo and behold, the Board of Governors are a bunch of backwards traditionalist, out of touch, rich white men with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo at all costs. You should hear them speaking at the meetings Harry, it's like they're barely aware a war even happened. Well, the ones who aren't in prison now. Which is another thing! The Board members who are imprisoned for being
"I know where all the pure-blood families are from. The Weasley's were Vikings."
Goyle was slouched across the hotel bed when Draco emerged from the bathroom. The Puddlemere Beater looked up as soon as he saw Draco, throwing the copy of
Harry puts the flowers on the little table by Malfoy's bed and sits down to watch the full performance. As the Healer leaves, Malfoy slumps against his pillows, of which there are now two.
“Oh Merlin,” Draco moaned, as Harry pushed in with one slick finger and Draco had to grab fistfuls of the quilt cover, screwing his eyes tight shut. The other wizard slowly worked his way up to two fingers, and then he was pressing them inside of Draco, and,
"You're in a frangipane mood lately."
"No, I can pretty much tell how you're feeling."
"I hired him as a curse breaker. Oh don't look so surprised, it makes you look idiotic."
"You wouldn't believe how difficult it is to get a professor fired. Hi Malfoy," Hermione says.
“Time to pick the materials for your new clothes,” the witch chirped cheerfully, oblivious to what she’d seen. Merlin, but it was a good job he had a task at hand, and something to occupy his brain for the next few minutes. Had Harry held him even a moment longer, Draco didn’t think he could have been held responsible for his actions.
"What's wrong with egg white whipping spells?"
Harry looks ahead to make sure Malfoy is far enough away before answering. "Just wondering why you're here," Harry says honestly.
"Definitely. Definitely chocolate," Harry says.
Perhaps everything wouldn’t be as dreadful as he’d feared. He was hardly the first wizard in the world to have a baby, and the commotion would hardly last long. With a bit of luck, Louis St Clare would do something stupid and knock him off the front page entirely.
Harry grins at that and Ron claps him on the back. "A little fighting does the body good. Gets the heart rate up. You need that now that you have a cushy security job."
in his larder, and Draco had taken one out. He’d placed it on his palm, struck at its presence and the small space it took up in the world.
“It wasn’t,” Draco offered, conciliatory. Harry hadn’t just made the first step. He’d made several and they’d all been rebuffed. The wizard was trying, and Draco knew that he ought to try as well. They were tied together now, by the baby that they’d made, which meant they’d have to get on. Make decisions. Be adults, whatever that was supposed to mean. Draco picked the bag back up, and cleared his throat. “It wasn’t a bad idea,” he repeated. “It just came as a surprise, is all. I had Adrianne – she’s one of Mother’s elves – make us up some sandwiches. Still,” Draco conceded. “We could certainly have the croissants for dessert.”
Harry pushed in with three fingers then, slick fingers searching, probing, looking for the right angle, and he didn’t stop until Draco was a mess; his skin shivering, neck arched and his toes curled against the mattress.
"Those are his eggs, Potter. Laid by his chickens. Chickens I'm fairly certain he loves like human children."
Draco sighed. Maybe he’d give the tonic a try instead of owling it back to Grimmauld Place. Harry was spot-on: he’d felt weary down to his very bones during the last few days. A couple of drops in his cup of tea couldn’t hurt, surely?
Draco knew he’d be celebrating with the rest of the team that night, hitting the bars and clubs of wizarding London, drinking his weight in Firewhisky, and likely finding their way to the front of the
A pillow is grabbed from the head of the bed, and slid right under Other Harry’s crotch so his hips are lifted slightly. And that’s when Draco moves down his body and lowers his mouth between Other Harry’s cheeks. That’s also when Harry makes a very undignified and unadvised squeak and Other Harry lifts his head towards the armchair. He only looks for a second or two, head falling forwards again due to Draco’s attention, but those two seconds are enough for Harry to feel like he was not seen through, like he knew Harry was there. Their eyes had locked.
"What the hell is kale anyway?"
"What?" he demands. "I made cupcakes. For the party. You didn't tell me how many people would be in attendance and Luna is vegan now so there need to be vegan cupcakes."
"Don't have to apologize to me, mate."
Malfoy is leaning back on his pillow, eyes closed but holding his hand out to Harry. Harry shifts to sit on the bed and takes his hand.
Harry kept murmuring Draco’s’ name –
Either way, he moves carefully and quietly under the Cloak, pulling his shoes from where he’s stuffed them in the sides of the chair and sliding his feet into them. He sits back on his armchair, knees pulled to the chest, chin propped on them, and he watches. It’s impossible not to, at this stage.
“Ron, can you find me a pen?” he says. Ron looks confused but dashes out of the kitchen for a pen, as Harry tries to find a piece of paper and fails the first two tries, going, stupidly, for the wrong cupboard at first and realising he is confused about his own kitchen layout.
"A little boring."
“So good,” Draco managed back, his words a whisper. “You’re so good for me, Harry.”
"We can do sushi," Harry says, grateful he doesn't have to figure out where to take Malfoy.
"Yeah. Look, tell him I won't be bought off."
Malfoy is staring down at the crinkled sheet looking like he's about to cry so Harry goes to sit with him. "Don't cry, yeah? I'll feel triple guilty if I make a sick person cry."
Harry bends over, hands on his knees, adrenaline coursing through him, his heartbeat in his ears and shouts, "What the fuck?"
Tucked inside his satchel was the framed picture from the
“That’s pure-blood culture,” Draco replied, winding his way through the mid-afternoon crowds. “What’s the Black family motto, embroidered into the enormous family tree that hangs in your home?
"So, er, how've you been?"
“Is there anything I can do to help?” Draco asked, nodding towards the sink. “Housekeeping magic isn’t exactly my forte, but it’s the least I can do, especially as I’ve taken such advantage of your hospitality,” he added, awkwardly, not wanting to acknowledge aloud that he’d spent most of the afternoon asleep.
He wanted Harry so badly. Gods, but he wanted to take the bond too. He wanted lazy Sundays with the Weasleys, and cosy nights watching the television. Draco wanted Harry’s tuneless singing voice, and his awful Muggle music, and the kind generosity that radiated from his person.
ought not to be looking. “I’m not bothered about any of that. All I’m bothered about is you. That you’re healthy, and happy, and that everything is right with our baby.”
The waitress comes to take their order, smiling like their bickering is cute. Malfoy orders the ricotta with balsamic roasted grapes on brioche. Harry orders nutella on sourdough. Malfoy frowns at Harry like he's going to say something about nutella being pedestrian so Harry cuts him off.
“This
Bloody hell, but this was ridiculous. He half-expected Harry to present him with a sprig of rosemary to pin to his lapel, or ask for his mum’s permission to court him. Draco took back his earlier thoughts. This wasn’t like the Yule Ball at all. Going out on what amounted to a real date with Harry was a hundred, thousand times worse.
The pair of them lived in a flat above a wand shop, over in the Hadrian’s Gate area. It wasn’t far away from Knockturn, but the Ministry had been working hard to make the area more upscale since the end of the war. Greg didn’t officially live with Millie: she was too good a pure-blood for that and her Mummy and Daddy would have been appalled. She just slept there overnight, every night, and kept most of her belongings there.
Malfoy listens to the Healer, nodding slowly, still blinking blearily and Harry wonders if he's really understanding the news. Like the fact that he was cursed. Cursed while under Harry's protection. Harry puts his head in his hands, the feeling of failure overwhelming him. He let Malfoy get cursed and then he almost let him asphyxiate.
then, they've hardly written anything about all the work Harry's been doing, fascinated as they are with who Harry's dating. I'm sure it's difficult recovering from being a fascist state propaganda machine, but I would think they'd write something about rounding up the last Death Eaters. You really should subscribe to the
"God that feels—"
It wasn’t better to know. Knowing meant making decisions. Knowing meant talking to Harry, and the prickling of horrible humiliation that he experienced whenever he thought about that night. Knowing meant everything would have to change and Draco wasn’t sure he was ready. He wasn’t sure that he ever would be.
“Now, we need to talk food. Food goes a long way when it comes to Draco. Chocolate. Aplenty. And tea. Good tea, loose leaf. Learn how to make a London Fog. Also, learn how to make Molly’s mocha. Buy peppermint syrup for it, too. I know none of this makes sense, but let yourself enjoy food, too. Don’t be afraid to try new things. It’s probably best you let Draco guide you when you’re unsure. He is fussy but has
"Come here," Malfoy says.
Mr Weasley was there, and Draco felt the subtle hum of magic as the wizard
"Good afternoon Ms. Quincy."
Harry’s lips were red and shiny when they slid off Draco’s penis, and Draco watched as he wiped them, roughly, on the back of his hand. His hair was sticking up at every angle, his abs flexed and powerful muscle moved under toned skin. Harry was a jigsaw puzzle of delights, and Draco didn’t know where to look first.
“Draco?” Harry asked. He hadn’t moved his hand, and a hot coil of magic penetrated his skin, profound and physical. Draco supposed he ought to shake it off, ought to smile, tell Harry it was late, and he was tired. He didn’t. Instead, he gathered his courage and looked up. Harry was close, closer than he’s thought he was. Warm breath mingled between them, and Draco’s eyes flicked to the other man’s lips. Circe, but Draco
"Well, that's that then. I best be off, lots ter do this afternoon."
"Weren't you raised by Muggles? Do you not recognize sweatpants when you see them?"
No doubt the daft prat had been reading his precious book again, and Draco wondered what his fabulous advice would be today. Perhaps Harry would be informing Draco that Apparition was no longer advisable, or that craving banana and cloudberry pudding – just like the elves used to make – was entirely normal.
"Guilt is stupid, I told you," Malfoy says, his voice a little tight, but he leans into Harry and tucks his head underneath Harry's chin.
"That's a big word for you."
“Your mother sounds like a very wise lady,” the witch responded. “Alright, I think I’ve got everything that I need.” The seamstress waved her wand, and Draco watched her kit fly neatly to their places on the shop counter. Stood there, propped against it, was Harry. His eyes were wide and affectionate, and he was watching proceedings very intently. “Ah,” said the witch, clucking in delight. “Speak of the Devil and so he appears! Godric, but that’s the look of love your husband is wearing. It’s unmistakable.” Draco tucked himself back in, confused as to how to correct the witch’s presumption. Before he could formulate an answer that even came close to describing Harry and he, she bustled away to collect her book of material swathes. “It does an old witch’s heart good to see such devotion.”
been charmed to glow in ten-foot-high letters.
Draco turned away from the photograph to look at Harry. “It isn’t chaotic,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand. “You’ve seen all of mine, haven’t you, above my mantlepiece? We didn’t have a lot of photographs back at the Manor. Father believed them Muggle and déclassé. Mummy had a secret camera though, and she used to take dozens of pictures of Pans, Blaise and I. Let me assure you Harry, I intend to do the same with our own little one. Make sure I have plenty of bribery material for when they’re at Hogwarts and they want to bring their beloved home for the summer.”
"It's fine," Harry says. "I just… I don't really know what my dad's family ate. I don't even know what part of India they're from. No one ever told me."
. You might try it some time."
Malfoy sets a small leather bag on Harry's bedside table and stands at Harry's bedside for a moment looking down at the quilt, tracing some of the stitching with his fingertips. Then he takes off his dressing gown and, seeing there's nowhere to hang it, sets it on the end of Harry's bed and arranges his slippers on the ground directly below it and then Harry gets impatient with Malfoy's fiddling and tugs on Malfoy's hand for once to pull him into bed.
"Come on, Malfoy."
As they near the gazebo the cats come prancing out to greet Hagrid, the peacocks following not far behind and to start there's a lot of "Who's a good boying" and Luna's laughter as she tosses sunflower seeds to the peacocks and Yip runs in circles snatching them from under their beaks.
“Harry! Harry, are you okay?” Hermione asks, stretching a warm hand towards Harry and helping him back on his feet, pulling him into a hug.
"It's a frangipane rhubarb crumble with vanilla yogurt."
“You know he—“
“Do you want to come back to Half-Moon Place?” Draco asked, feeling very much like he didn’t want to be alone. “Adrianne has this evening off to visit her parents at the Manor, but I’m sure I could rustle up a cake or some biscuits? I might even have a pre-pregnancy beer rolling around the back of my pantry that I could furnish you with.”
"What's in the porridge? Not more persimmon, is it?"
"Go home and get some sleep. Visiting hours are eight to eighteen."
. Why should I be upset that you would think I would still enslave an elf here, after everything that happened? Why on earth would it bother me that you'd still think me callous enough to keep an elf in a dirty pillowcase? I'm just a spoiled brat, right, Potter?"
Malfoy takes in the news with a blank face, still reading the parchment of discharge instructions. Ron clears his throat and Malfoy looks up.
Other Harry is chopping onions and Harry decides to get closer, walking around the table quietly and standing at the edge of the table opposite the counter Other Harry is working on.
had predicted? Wanted the family, and the bond, and the happy ending?”
In all honesty, Draco hadn’t taken Mummy’s words about having a daughter seriously. He’d imagined that she was teasing him a little bit. Now though, for the first time, he speculated what it might be like having a little girl.
"Ha ha. Can I take a nap in your bed?"
“Good morning,” Harry said brightly, as Draco stepped to the side and allowed him entry. “Croissants. I bought croissants. I know how much you like them, Draco. Remember when we won against the Wasps? You were so ebullient that you owl-ordered croissants for the whole team.”
Malfoy looks up from a cookbook, a small smile on his face and reaches for a white paper-wrapped package, opening it up with a ceremonial air. "Look at this, Potter," Malfoy says, revealing a thick fillet of pink fish.
He pulls a bowl out of the cupboard he saw Other Harry go into and eats the same cereal Other Harry has just eaten. He doesn’t recognise the brand, but it’s lovely and sweet, and he wonders if he could attempt to find it once he gets back. He realises he didn’t have dinner the night before, too confused with this situation he was dropped into. Confident neither Draco nor Other Harry will be coming back any time soon and unsure about when he’ll get to eat again, Harry raids the cupboards, the fridge, and the pantry. He makes himself some toast after he finishes his cereal.
“Spontaneous combustion isn’t quite Ron’s style,” Harry said, chasing the bread with another mouthful of his Butterbeer. “He’s rather more laidback than that, and considerably more open-minded.” Harry shrugged his shoulders, and gestured to Draco with open palms. “I mean, yeah, Ron gave me a bit of ribbing when I told him about our little surprise. Said he felt sorry for any kid of ours – what with your sharp chin, and my short-sightedness – but he clapped me on the back, said he was happy for me. Said that we’d been star-crossed even at school. That it was only a matter of time.”
"I think so. Which is annoying on its own separate from the fact that he doesn't really know how."
Draco finished his mouthful, took a sip of his tea and nodded. “A little bit,” he said. “An archetypical Gryffindor.” He took a deep breath. “But thank you,” Draco said, “for coming over today… And for wanting to be involved.”
"Oh is that how it will happen?" Harry says, unable to hide his amused smile.
Draco wakes up with Harry's warm body flung over him, his hair tickling Draco's nose. It's divine. It's completely unexpected; an unexpected that started eight years ago and grew deeper and more far away with every interaction. Though Draco might have nursed a tiny impossible seedling of a wish that he could somehow have Harry's attention on him in some way other than disgust, he never thought it would actually happen. He never thought he'd be in Harry Potter's bed, snuggled up to him.
"You're—you're trying to—"
"And that makes it okay to get even?"
The two of them stood there, a pair of besotted fools, until their daughter finally ceased her kicking. It was at that point that Harry’s pancake, already burnt to a crisp, decided to fill the kitchen of Grimmauld Place with acrid, unpleasant smoke.
"Back to Potter, huh?" Harry says.
That wasn’t what Draco wanted, not by a long shot. This was their new beginning, after all, and it wouldn’t work unless he, and Harry, both let themselves believe in it. He wasn’t there to play housemates, or formal co-fathers. “I want this to be
"Whatever," Harry says. Then because he can't resist, "What's in them then?"
Draco saw the little limbs that were moving around, wiggling inside of him. He saw their little one’s torso, their head, and most significantly, the flicker of their powerful heartbeat.
Malfoy takes a sharp right down a claustrophobic staircase that ends in a surprisingly small kitchen. The ceiling is lower here which is much cozier than the towering hallways and empty rooms, and the coziness is further enhanced by the golden yellow walls and dark green cupboards. The open shelves above the cupboards are filled with crocks in saturated blues and yellows, and brown speckled cream mugs. Copper pots hang over the range. There are even little blue vases with cheerfully haphazard bundles of wildflowers. All together it looks like the kind of kitchen in
“I don’t doubt it,” Draco said, touching Harry’s wrist for the tiniest of moments. “Now off with you, Potter. I’m dead on my feet.”
Before long it was time for Greg to leave. Millie was expecting him; they had an appointment with their wedding planner, and then Greg had to get an early night. The new season’s training regime started in scarcely a few weeks, and the Beater needed to get back out on his broomstick. Draco had supposed he might feel envious when Puddlemere’s year began in earnest once more, but now it had arrived, he found that he didn’t, not truly. Other exciting events loomed far bigger in his future.
"Don't you think pasties are enough."
“Bloody hell,” Harry hissed from the side-lines. “You promised, on your honour, that you wouldn’t say… I’ve
As soon as it had finished speaking, the stag faded out of existence. Draco sank back into his settee, watching as the last of the sparkles disappeared. Hearing Harry speak those words felt significant. It felt like a privilege rarer than rubies that he’d been the one to give Harry a family and give him the fulfilment of his dreams.
"Wait just a second and we'll go with you," Hermione says, getting up from the table.
Goyle was right. It was better to know. The potion was supposed to take five minutes to give its result; but was a great pile of nonsense. It took less than a minute for the potion to change from a swampy green to a bright cerulean blue. He was pregnant and Draco wasn’t even the slightest bit surprised. Bloody,
"A bit working class for you, aren't they?"
Malfoy starts whisking a mixture of butter and flour in a pan and tells Harry to drizzle in the milk.
As soon as Hermione was close by, Draco could see that the younger witch was truly anguished. The colour was high in her cheeks, and her eyes were set and angry. Draco braced himself for the verbal laceration that he assumed was sure to follow.
It took mere moments for Harry’s Patronus to materialise in Draco’s Lounge. Salazar, but the stag was an impressive beast. Its antlers seemed to span the width of the room, and it glowed, iridescent with Harry’s fearless magic.
Harry starts work on Monday in a much better mood than he's been in for at least six months, maybe an entire year and a half. It's surprising to Harry how much lighter he feels just acknowledging he doesn't like being an Auror, even though he's still going to work. Just knowing it is enough right now.
"How many cupcakes did you make?"
"Isn't that toast place nearby?" Harry asks.
Except for the persimmon mush that's true, so Harry ignores it. "But grapefruit is bitter. And for middle aged women going on diets," Harry says, thinking of that unfortunate summer Aunt Petunia decided a quarter of grapefruit made an appropriate breakfast.
"We'll have Depression cake."
“That wasn’t what I was talking about,” Draco whispered, his spare hand finding Harry’s bicep and holding the other wizard tightly. “Do you always have to be so wilfully dense? I was talking about us. The
That would have been cliché and formula with any other wizard, but somehow the words seemed to suit Harry. Draco liked how good they sounded in Harry’s lovely deep voice, directed solely at him. Harry was beside his side in a flash, and the two of them linked their fingers.
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” she said, “and you too, Draco. I know we’ve had our issues in the past but nobody deserves this… Your private lives, spread all over the cover! I wasn’t sure if you’d know yet. I know you don’t get newspapers delivered, Harry, but- “
"Oh, right."
Harry didn’t. Consent given, Harry applied a new, gentle pressure to his puckered entrance, and his every touch set Draco aflame. With a nod of warning, Harry breached Draco.
He heard a half-groan come from Goyle’s bed, and then a voiced
"Potter, where's your fruit bowl? Where do you put your fruit? Do you just leave it to roll all over the counter like a barbarian?"
That evening, Draco felt itchy, and ill at ease. His conversation with Harry replayed like a broken charm in his head. Usually, Harry would have Apparated over for a few hours, and they’d have talked, filling Half-Moon Place with laughter and noise.
"Because Draco invited me."
Harry shoves Ron and puts the kettle on for tea.
“Bloody
"Does polenta smell like flowers?"
Harry is thinking maybe he should shut up about Malfoy before Ron and Hermione share that
“Circe’s tits,” Flint said, coming to his aid. His captain walked over and took his shoulder. He led Draco out the room like he’d been rendered an invalid, and sat him on a chair. Draco couldn’t have been more embarrassed, but he let himself be led, feeling a little thankful for the attention. Greg spelled the sink clean, cast an Air Cleansing Charm and joined them moments later
Harry rubbed a hand over his face, and spoke again. “Today at the Café? You told me that you’d fallen in love with me. What if I felt the same, Draco? What if I said I wanted everything the
"What're you making?" Harry asks.
Draco turned over and squashed his pillow around his ears. Why was Goyle snoring so loudly? Had he always been so noisy? The wizard sounded like an Erumpent! That was it. Draco knew when he was beaten.
The Mediwix didn’t press for details. Another flick of his wand and the
Ron leaves the kitchen laughing. Harry makes sure Ron's occupied in the living room with Hermione before turning around in Malfoy's arms. He tilts his head up for a kiss but Malfoy doesn't bend down to meet him.
Other Harry’s hands shake in front of him and he runs his right one through his hair. “Okay, that’s good,” Other Harry says to himself, and turns to the page on the counter again, picking it up and bringing it closer to the hob where he resumes his cooking.
Well, I reckon that applies in this instance.”
Harry looks at Ron trying to decide if he's drunk. He typically gets very red underneath his freckles when he drinks and Harry can see pale skin, so that theory is out. He's trying to think of another theory, anything really, to explain Ron's behavior, when Malfoy says, "I'll be there," in the same voice he used when he was eleven and challenging Harry to a midnight duel. Harry only just resists the urge to put his face in his hands.
After lunch, Harry swallows his pride and asks Malfoy for help. "D'you know where wizards buy furniture? Is there a place?"
There wasn’t much more to say after that. Draco was emotionally exhausted, and Harry appeared attuned to the fact. He dropped Draco’s hand, and they finished off the last few bites of their croissants silently. Draco tried to conceal a yawn behind the back of his hand, but he wasn’t successful.
"S'nothing," Hagrid says, shuffling a little closer.
“You said you didn’t want me,” Draco said, angrily, because Harry shouldn't be allowed to raise his hopes like that. He shouldn’t come around, and be this kind, and treat Draco better than any other man ever had, because he’d made Draco fall in love with him. “You said you didn’t want me, and you said you weren’t ready. You fucked me, and you left me, Harry.”
"Are you saying you don't want cake?"
Draco turned into the Left Wing of the Manor. Growing up, this part of the building had been his mother’s domain and even now it was the place that Draco felt the most comfortable.
. This Other Harry really does look happier. The word that comes to his mind is “shinier,” almost as if he’s glowing. Harry makes a mental note to start moisturising, like Hermione has been telling him to for ages.
"What'd you tell him? About the dal I mean," Ron says.
"Sorry," Harry says, remembering the beautiful mural Luna painted of their faces, the golden word "friends" twined around them. He feels like a pile of steaming garbage. "Work's been busy."
Greg made a gesture of defeat with his hands. “Looks like you’ve got it all worked out,” he answered, shrugging his shoulders. “Though I still think you should talk to him. Hear it from his Chosen Mouth and all that. You can’t know what Harry will say unless you talk to him.” Draco tried to cut in, but Greg hadn’t finished. “Harry’s not a complete prat, Malfoy. It could easily be Harry knocked up if you’d made a single different decision on the night, and wouldn’t you like to know if he was carrying your kid? You’ve made a big brave decision and now you’ve got to live with the consequences. He’ll be fucking livid if he spots you in
“You’re in love with Harry,” he said, matter-of-factly, his words a statement rather than a question. “How long have you known?”
“They look like you,” Draco quipped, a smile in his voice. “They’ve got your ridiculous long legs.”
"Look, I'm going to go," Neville says, pulling his coat out from the pile on one of their kitchen chairs. "I'll see you around."
"Shite! I forgot the rock cakes! And they'll be here in half an hour and I still need to set the table."
It was only when he placed the tray on his kitchen table that Draco saw Harry, standing in the doorway. His green eyes were trained on the swell of Draco’s middle, now mercifully covered once more.
Harry’s arm darted out, and Draco had to fight a farcical urge to laugh at the sight of it. “They’re not the Snitch,” Draco joked, voice soft. Harry smiled in return and swallowed, and Draco realised that the other man was nervous. “It’s alright,” Draco said. “You won’t hurt them. It’s not like there’s much to feel anyway.”
Harry’s mind spins with all this new information.
It doesn’t take long for his Auror instincts to kick in, and suddenly Harry’s wand is out and he’s cataloguing the house like a crime scene. Not that there’s a protocol for accidental time-hopping, or any kind of time-hopping at all, really. But Harry looks for clues. He needs to know when he is and who lives in this place in order to figure out his next steps. This is the Grimmauld Place he knows, only cleaner and lived in, much unlike the dreadful dark place Harry currently lives in. This place feels… joyful. There are pairs of shoes thrown about in the entrance hall, there are comfortable-looking pillows on cosy-looking sofas with soft-looking blankets hanging from their backs. There are pictures on the walls, books on the shelves, food in the pantry.
Harry gave the babygro an appraising glance, and then placed it down on top of the rest of his purchases.
Harry lifts his head to kiss Malfoy's lips lightly. "I'll be back in a bit."
"It's unexpected, isn't it?" Malfoy says happily. "And the sandy texture from the buckwheat."
He walks through the Muggle front of the shop through the door with the swirling cloudy barrier and gets caressed by the same creeping vines as last time, only there's no Malfoy to laugh at the look on Harry's face. He wanders the long aisles, looking at the blooms miserably and feeling there's no way he'll be able to put together a bouquet the way Malfoy can.
"I drew the Moon today."
Then Other Harry starts talking.
Draco inhaled, and wondered, briefly, what he’d done in a previous life to deserve his current existence. He massaged his temple, trying hard to think of an excuse that’d satisfy his teammate. Nothing came to mind and – truthfully – this was a mission that he didn’t relish completing on his own.
Malfoy insists Harry Apparate four separate times or else, "You'll splinch the Swiss meringue buttercream." So Harry walks each batch of cupcakes to the edge of the Manor's wards, Apparates with the cupcakes, deposits them in his kitchen, Floos back to the Manor, collects more cupcakes and does it all over again. Four times. The fourth time he's greeted at his flat with Malfoy's anxious face checking over the cupcakes, presumably to make sure Harry hasn't mauled them in transit.
, and referees whose every decision went against the team.
Draco watched as Harry gave Molly a hug, squeezing Harry like he was still a small boy rather than a well-built sportsman of twenty-three. The witch’s eyes were sparkly, and she seemed delighted by Harry’s presence. “It’s been much too long,” she scolded.
Draco did. He moved to the hob, and kept his attention solely focused on the food, moving the chicken in the pan and making sure that nothing got burnt. Draco even thought that he’d been doing a reasonable job until Harry stepped in behind him, and pressed his chest into Draco’s back. Circe, but it felt wonderful. Harry hooked his head over Draco’s shoulder and wrapped his arms around the swell of his middle. Draco leant back into him, enjoying the moment. He hadn’t realised how touch-starved he was, and he revelled in Harry’s warmth and sturdy presence.
It was a kick, light but undeniable. He stilled, and then he frantically ran his hands over the expanse of his tummy, pressing one hand at the top, and the other firmly on the bottom. Keeping as still as he possibly could, Draco held his breath, praying that she’d kick out once again.
"I don't know if I like fish."
"It's cashmere. Now go sit down or I'll burn the porridge.
Harry was quoted as saying in the front-page article. He and Cuffe must’ve enjoyed a long conversation.
Malfoy wrinkles his nose. "I ate a lot of French food growing up," he says.
"Malfoy," Harry says, "Victims deserve justice."
“Harry kept smiling,” Arthur cut in, absentmindedly breaking his shortbread in half, little pieces of it skittering all over the plate. “Did his rehabilitation. Got back in the saddle; put on a brave face. Inside it was a different tale. It was as if some part of Harry that had survived the war, survived Voldemort had finally broken. The light dulled, and Molly and I? Well, we imagined that we’d lost our Harry forever. But that joy, that joie de vivre? It’s coming back. Ron agrees. Harry is brighter. Happier. He loves you,” Arthur repeated, every bit as sedately as if he were talking about the weather. “The feelings are there. He simply needs time to process them. Time to get used to the idea.”
Malfoy looks exceedingly smug. "Oh you liked it, did you?"
Harry’s cock is so hard it hurts and if he makes a desperate sound of need of his own when his Other Self comes, panting and whining through it, it gets lost in the noise of the room. Harry’s chest aches with the intensity of the affection they share after, bodies flopping back into the mattress.
"Would you say it's a 'revelation'?"
There it was.
"A throw blanket?"
on the top floor of his pantry, and Draco reached up for those, his shirt riding up as he did so.
The pounding of his heart made Draco feel dizzy, and he decided that standing might not be the best idea, not for the next few minutes at least. How had he gotten himself in this predicament? He was twenty-three and theoretically intelligent. Images of Harry flickered through his consciousness. His lean, beautiful body during sex, and the rueful, apologetic look that he’d worn when he’d told Draco that he didn’t want anything serious. The very idea of telling Harry he was pregnant made Draco want to Apparate to the Manor and hide behind its tall walls for the rest of his days.
Finishing his tea, Draco had excused himself, wanting to get changed into his loosest black trousers. He had been holding his current pair up with a Sticking Charm for a week or so, and he wasn’t about to let Harry into that particular little secret. Reality dawned the moment that Draco pulled the trousers over his thighs and tried to force the clasps together. He sucked all the air out of his lungs, sent a fervent prayer up to Merlin, and tried his very hardest to get the two sides to meet.
Harry thinks he’d quite like to be read to in the bath.
"Ay, the gherkins, nice touch, that," Hagrid says.
"I know you're not this stupid, Potter."
As soon as the door shuts Malfoy sits up. "Come here, Harry," he says.
“A new magical being born outside of a bond,” Draco answered. “Mummy, I’m not in a relationship with the other father, and I never have been. Can you bring yourself to love my baby anyway? He’s-The other dad is a good, kind person, keen to be part of our child’s life. But not mine.”
"I still think so."
"Under my careful tutelage. Where's your kettle?" Malfoy asks, frowning at an open cabinet.
"There," Malfoy repeats, getting the measuring cups out. "Now before you open your mouth and make a mess of this conversation I
"No I—"
"Romantic."
"Yeah?"
That answer didn’t suit Harry either.
"Pasties. I have a small errand to run this afternoon and we'll need lunch."
"That's mostly true. Shrinking books requires a certain finesse I doubt you're capable of."
Draco lay back, counting to ten as Braithwaite waved his wand around and spoke an incantation that he was unacquainted with. The sensation of the Mediwix’s spell wasn’t enjoyable, and Draco felt it all over his skin like a thousand tiny pinpricks. Shining tendrils of purple magic began to gather above his abdomen, and Draco felt a sudden warmth infuse him. He watched, eyes peeled, as the wisps gathered into a tiny, pulsating mass that floated just below his navel. Braithwaite seemed satisfied.
It was really happening. Draco shook Mediwitch Hayes’s hand, and she told him to arrange a further appointment in a month’s time. Draco left her office feeling hopeful. In four months, training would begin once again for the 2004-2005 season, but he wouldn’t be getting on his broomstick.
For the rest of the morning Draco felt like he was walking on air. Circe, but he felt exactly like he’d done as a teenager, getting ready for the Yule Ball – jittery and keyed up; unable to keep still – and he ended up getting changed three times, which was ridiculous, because he wasn’t going dancing or to a five-star restaurant. He was going house hunting, one of the most exhausting and disheartening activities known to man.
Other Harry summons a small dark wooden side table from the corner of the bathroom and levitates it down gently until it’s right by the bath. Draco comes back up the stairs, two glasses of white wine levitating in front of him and a bowl of strawberries in his hand.
Pansy was talking her normal romanticised twaddle, and Draco rolled his eyes. He’d always kept his crush on Harry well-guarded and hidden at school, and Pans was talking a fat lot of nonsense about the pair of them being as hopeless as each other.
the last of the dinner plates into the cupboard. Draco coughed, announcing his presence, and the older wizard turned, acknowledging him.
For a good while there's only clinking china and Luna's humming and the cats purring and then Luna says, "These are very good rock cakes."
The sound of Orpheus scratching at the glass tore Draco from his spiralling panic attack, and he pushed open the window. The Eagle owl swooped in, with a small piece of parchment tied to his leg.
“I’ve gotten a little bigger,” Draco answered, his cheeks flushing at the admittance. “I’ve been using Extension Spells but nothing’s fitting very well anymore. I’d like to buy some new trousers. Shirts, too.” He lapsed into silence, but the witch didn’t seem surprised at all by his confession. All she did was chuckle,
"What's Malfoy doing here?" Neville asks, arms still crossed.
It was a stuffy, airless September afternoon when Greg returned from his long sojourn by the seaside. Draco was more pleased at the prospect of seeing his mate stepping through the Floo than he would have cared to admit aloud.
He’d gone to bed at eleven, lights out exactly when Flint had requested, but not a single blink of slumber had been forthcoming.
"I'm not a victim," Malfoy snaps, losing some of his calm demeanor.
And if Harry avoids him the rest of the day, Kingsley doesn't need to know it.
"And I thought you might like it! I don't know why you're so angry. You were angry you hadn't had any growing up so I thought I'd make you one now but apparently that makes you angry too so just go outside and eat your disgusting sandwich!"
Twenty minutes later Harry is squinting up at the wrought iron gates of Malfoy Manor. He was told the gates would open for him when he arrived but he's been standing here like a pillock for five minutes at least and the gates show no sign of changing that circumstance. He could Apparate back to the Ministry and Floo to the Manor from the office but while Harry's mostly not fussed about this assignment that doesn't mean he's keen to trail after Malfoy all day.
be ready – but then it happened, and it’s with you, and, well, I just can’t imagine it differently now. Of all the lives I could have experienced, I’m… Well, I’m glad this life is mine.”
"We could go. Get them. Now, I mean," Malfoy says, looking anywhere but Harry.
Harry sighs. "What do you want?"
Harry feels angry now, thinking of the eight feet of parchment he could fill with all the vile shite Malfoy's done since they were eleven. He doesn't know what to do with all this anger.
"How do you know that?"
“Salazar’s fucking eyes,” Draco managed, his voice rather more high-pitched than he’d have liked. “I-I don’t have the first clue which potion I need to buy… And that old git is
"What about your whole spiel about guilt and moving on?"
"What about the people you've hurt? What about what they deserve?"
Draco softened at Greg’s words. “I love Harry,” he said, “and I think- I
"Why are you being so weird about this. Aren't you gay too? You were way too into Andrea."
It took a matter of moments for pants, socks and every last vestige of clothes to be removed, and while Harry kicked away his jeans, Draco rustled in his bedside drawer for lube and a condom. The lube was easily uncovered, but there was a tiny moment of alarm when a condom couldn’t be seen instantly. He let out a relieved breath when an
"Oh no, no. I'm not doing all this work and not getting a spot of lunch out of the deal. You owe me."
Next on the agenda was upstairs. Draco had insisted that he absolutely must have a dressing room all of his own. He discovered to his intense pleasure that all of his clothes had been put away neatly in the walk-in wardrobe of a large, pale yellow bedroom.
"I was asking questions to learn more. You should try it some time. Besides, I got to talk to a gorgeous Italian man." Malfoy pours himself a glass and then looks up at Harry, a question on his face and it takes Harry a moment to realize he's asking if Harry wants wine and not if Harry also thinks Andrea is a gorgeous Italian man (the answer to which is unequivocally yes, but Harry is too stunned to say so).
Harry was very taken with everything, and soon he had a second basket of purchases, also filled to the brim. Draco held off. Usually he enjoyed shopping immensely, but today something was holding him back. He decided it was best not to examine his feelings too deeply.
"No problem."
“These modern potions are very accurate,” Braithwaite answered. Draco had to take his hat off to the wizard. He was good at his job. He didn’t sound even the slightest bit surprised at Draco’s tale. “So, in that respect, it’d be unprofessional of me not to manage your expectations. It is highly likely that you’re pregnant. There is, however, a spell that will tell us for sure.” He gave Draco a reassuring nod. “Unfortunately, I’m not an expert in wizard pregnancy, so if we do get a positive confirmation, then I’ll have to write you a referral to St Mungo’s where you’ll be managed by their Paternity Department. Does everything about that sound reasonable?”
"What?" Harry asks.
Hermione nods so Harry continues.
"Not sure there's any subject you don't know anything about," Ron says.
"Have you discovered the unicorns' names?" she asks in lieu of saying hello.
because he's
Or so he thinks.
This sacred right of passage for a wizard and my mother went and picked a wand for me."
good taste.”
"Should I have invited them into the Manor for cocktails and dancing? Hagrid told me to leave them be."
“Mistake, my pert arse,” Pansy retorted. “He got you pregnant so there must have been something special between you both. He could hardly have thought you were a Mountain Troll.” She sighed dramatically. “Oh darling. Harry and you! You’re both as hopeless as each other. Both blind to the truth, Draco, and at least Harry has the excuse of glasses. Neither of you have ever had even a clue about the other. You’ve never been able to see what was so clear to the rest of the world… And now you’ve a baby between you.” She pursed her lips. “Oh, darling. You don’t do things by halves, do you?”
"You get the one that you like."
Malfoy takes the pan off the heat and whisks the sauce less vigorously now.
Harry hasn't taken to political reform the way Ron and Hermione have. They seem to have endless energy for compiling evidence against Umbridge, giving interviews in support of legislation and reforms, working to replace Professor Binns with a competent teacher and updating the Hogwarts history curriculum. Harry knows he should do those things, Hermione's talked to him a thousand times about the weight of his name and all the influence it carries, but when Harry thinks about doing those things he feels a bone-deep weariness.
Harry pulled an odd face at that proposal – not disapproving as such, more quizzical – and looked very much like he was arranging his thoughts on the subject. He was about to speak when the same elf that has served them earlier called them back over.
"Small mercies," Ron says. "I don't know about the whole forgiveness thing, but I can say you've been a hell of a lot happier since you started going to the Manor."
Finding the hem of the other wizard’s scruffy Muggle tee-shirt, Draco slipped his fingers beneath the thin cotton and let his fingers explore the hard, muscly skin beneath. A disastrous fall had put paid to Harry’s professional flying career two years before, but hadn’t ever broken the other man’s spirit. Harry Potter was still the fittest, fastest, and most astute Seeker in the whole sky whenever the two had one of their regular training sessions. A sensual heat rolled through Draco, and he thanked Merlin, Morgana – any deities in the vicinity, really – for letting him have this opportunity. Truth be told, Draco couldn’t believe his luck.
. And you must stop as soon as I say."
The farmer, a tall man named Andrea, takes them around the property, through golden walled gardens, and round the animal pins where there are a few goats and several chickens, and then down to a wine cellar. Malfoy has a great many questions about the wine that he's asking in stilted Italian and Harry misses the feeling of the sunshine on his face so he wanders back outside and sits down against one of the low walls in the garden with its crumbling golden plaster and tips his face up to the sun. It's gorgeous here, bright and lovely, gold every way he looks.
"What? Are you serious?"
"Did your family not make curries or chutneys and the like?"
"Fine, pescatarian."
After a few minutes Draco carried on their conversation. “Pansy said something equally silly,” he commented, taking his fresh drink from the tray of their waiter and raising it to his lips. “The witch actually said that you and I were as ‘hopeless as each other’. It would seem that our friends know the contents of our hearts far better than we do ourselves. Salazar save us from the matchmakers.”
"How?"
"I think this is the best porridge I've ever had," Luna says.
Everything about the
gossip pages. Louis swapped girlfriends more often than Draco changed his socks, and yet he still managed to catch the Snitch with alarming regularity. Even worse, Louis was a glossy Gryffindor; a fan favourite. He didn’t have Draco’s uncomfortable past, Dark Mark, or his ruined family name.
The two of them left after that. Greg was telling him something, something about Szymon Lewandowski, and how they planned to thrash him, and the rest of the Magpies, into the middle of next week, but Draco wasn’t listening. He couldn’t really hear his friend, let alone reply. Braithwaite had promised to talk to Marcus, and tell him the situation, so there was nothing for Draco to do except sleep.
"This is a crisis! I can't put them through the Floo! Have you ever Flooed with a frosted cupcake? It's a disaster."
He's certainly going to need a pint with Ron when this day's over.
Louis St Clare would get his spot on the Puddlemere First Team; there wasn’t even a single Sickle of doubt about that.
a bigoted little shit? Because he absolutely was."
Ron and Hermione look at one another meaningfully.
Draco smiled, and pressed another kiss onto Harry’s lips. “We’re both wonderful,” he said, taking Harry’s hand and guiding it to the swell of his middle. “Though her flutters are quite strong at the moment. Possibly she’s responding to your magic.” He laughed, feeling a little self-conscious once again. “She won’t have had such a big dose of it since the moment she was conceived.”
and how much their little one had changed and grown since their last appointment. “Everything is progressing really well. My Mediwitch was pleased. Our baby looked beautiful.”
"No. No way. Are you saying he wasn't
"Draco," she exclaims, coming around the counter to hug Malfoy. She holds his shoulders and peers up at him. "Oh how you've grown! What a pleasure! What a pleasure! You look so like your mother! How is she?"
"Ron told me."
tomorrow, proclaimed by all and sundry as the Saviour’s latest love interest.”
"My mother did as well. I, well, I removed them before sending it over to you."
"How about this one?" Harry asks, showing Malfoy a picture of pasta with veggies.
His excuses had sounded weak at best, and Draco was entirely sure that Mother had seen through the lies.
Mediwitch Hayes looked at Harry, her face a perfect combination of confusion and approval. “Well that all sounds excellent,” she answered. “Wizard pregnancies are rooted in the magic of their two fathers, and it’s in the best interest of the baby that you are a strong partnership. Very few partners are so doting.”
"How do you know about Tesco?"
"Yes."
"Diagon's just crowded."
"Uh, sure," Harry says.
That seemed to work. The air in the room had felt tight with tension, but some of that dissipated when Harry smiled.
"How should I know?"
Harry takes a bite and frowns. It is the best porridge he's ever had, creamy and perfectly sweet and somehow the oats taste… oatier. And the stewed fruit is a pile of apples that taste like they came straight from the inside of an apple pie. Harry watches Malfoy smile down at his own bowl of oatmeal, a fragile wisp of a smile Harry's sure he's never seen before.
"And aside from your general lack of knowledge of cooking technique and variety, you have yet to dislike anything I've made despite your frequent disbelief."
The very worst afternoon had been the one where Ginny Weasley had suggested in a column in the
Harry comes closer and, taking Malfoy's hand in his, mutters a cooling charm. Malfoy doesn't say anything and Harry sighs.
"It's amazing."
"No," Harry says, admirably withstanding Malfoy's smug look.
"I do understand. I'm sorry Neville, I didn't mean to—it's not like I think any of those things are ok."
"I don't always complain about Malfoy."
“Very gentlemanly,” Draco said, sitting down in the chair opposite. He snagged a sandwich off the plate nearest to him. “I’m very impressed, although you don’t have to be so solicitous around me, Harry. I’m pregnant, not made of glass.”
"Of course not," Harry says.
"You've been to
"I think I have time for a batch of biscuits."
"I read about jaffa cakes and wanted to try them."
"What are you on about?"
Greg surprised Draco by laughing. “Just like the fortune cookie,” he said. “Remember that?
“I’d love to,” Harry answered, linking his arm inside Draco’s as they made their way towards the public Floo. “Beer and biscuits sound like the perfect end to the perfect day.”
Harry takes a sip of tea and nods at Malfoy to continue. He doesn't want to ruin this by starting a fight and there's a fifty-fifty chance whatever comes out of either of their mouths will start a fight.
The pictures are the easiest clues to decipher, even if they leave him slightly baffled and breathless, somehow. There are pictures of Ron and Hermione holding a small girl with Hermione’s big brown eyes and hair, and a smile just like Ron’s.
Draco hadn’t been able to help himself. He’d dozed as soon as his head had hit the pillow, sinking into a deep sleep where Harry’s green eyes sparkled, and words of true love dripped from his lips like honey.
He is. He just knows he can’t forget. He can’t let himself forget.
"When did you know?"
Malfoy sets the cup and saucer in front of Harry with a stiff nod.
“Bloody hell, Goyle,” Draco spat out, choosing the easier path of feigning infuriation rather than examining why he was as upset as he was. “If I’d have wanted this conversation, I’d have Flooed to the sodding Manor. Mummy is a sight easier on the eye than your ugly mug.” He took a belligerent swallow of Pumpkin Juice. “There’s never been any question that Harry and I are going to get bonded, or that I’m going to take his name… That was all
Draco snaked his hands over the surface of his tee-shirt, feeling the brush of the material over the silky-smooth skin beneath. Harry’s words rang in Draco’s head. The other wizard had lost his own parents, and was then forced to live with his abusers. He’d been brought up in a privileged world of pure-blood lies and now his own father was rotting his life away in prison.
It wasn’t Narcissa’s way to be discourteous – the witch shuddered at the sound of a raised voice – but Draco couldn’t help dreading the conversation he knew they needed to have.
Malfoy stops, looking a little embarrassed by his rant. "Well? Aren't you going to say asinine things about taking responsibility?"
"What's for lunch?" Harry asks without thinking.
Harry cupped his cheek, and Draco let his eyes flutter closed. He leant in. Draco was close enough to feel Harry’s breath ghosting on his skin, and the murmured words. “Thank you for our baby,” he said.
"The whole point is that you stop putting yourself in life threatening situations."
To which Malfoy shouts, "The cupcakes, Potter! Don't be dense!"
"I don't know why I brought him up, I can't think of anything I want to talk about less."
He starts at the top.
. All I want from you,” Draco concluded, fishing his ready-inked quill from the inside pocket of his satchel, “is half an hour of your time.”
“You’re still shaking,” Harry said, his voice gentle. He came over and sat beside Draco on the bed. He rubbed soft circles over his back. “What happened?”
Grimmauld Place wasn’t far from where Draco lived, less than half an hour’s flight for Orpheus, but Harry still kept Draco waiting.
But Harry would know that booming knock anywhere, it's the same booming knock that changed Harry's life eleven years ago.
"The herd at Hogwarts has been struggling with Wasting Warts and it's become so rampant that Hagrid has decided to quarantine the sick Thestrals. He needed a place to keep the healthy ones while the rest of the herd recovers."
Malfoy smiles down at his bowl of porridge again, and Harry, realizing he's watching Malfoy again, promptly shoves a huge bite into his mouth and chokes a little.
Luckily for Harry there's an intermission when Ron comes home and Malfoy serves them pasta e ceci and a radicchio, arugula, and endive salad. Unluckily for Harry, this intermission is rather brief.
Mostly."
“You like what you see?” Harry joked, posing, flirty, and Draco had to admit that he did, very much.
"What? Why?"
Malfoy pulls down a bright purple cookbook from the shelf and flips around a little looking for the right page. Harry leans over and reads aloud, "Chocolate Buckwheat Biscuits? Buckwheat?"
“Are you panicking now? I can’t remember anymore. Christ, don’t panic. This is good. Everything is going to be okay, okay? Breathe. Breathe, Harry.”
makes out that we’re together, then that’s on them. We know the truth – know what we are to each other – and that’s our business and nobody else’s. It’s just- Draco, you do know that my coming to your flat, and to St Mungo’s… That isn’t only because I care about the baby? You’re not some lock to be broken with an Alohomora, and then cast aside when our little one arrives! Bloody hell. When I said I wanted to be by your side, the emphasis was on the
"Can't argue with that," Harry says.
"Magic, obviously. Don't you know
Harry's less angry. He still thinks it's presumptuous, but presumptuously, well, kind. Malfoy is being kind.
" Harry says morosely. "He's named his dog Lord Yipslington." And then Harry is off, telling them about the bloody peacocks and the weird empty Manor and how Malfoy yelled at him about not eating breakfast, "And! He had a fit because I asked him if house-elves do the washing up!"
"Is it? Are you worried about me, Malfoy?"
Draco’s fears were unwarranted, though. The taunts and insults never arrived, and he began to realise that Harry hadn’t been spouting a cliché when he’d called the Weasleys ‘his people’. They really were the other wizard’s family, and he lost count of the good wishes he was offered, the hands that he shook, and the various wix jumping up to offer Harry and he their seats.
"Thanks," Malfoy says drily. "If it helps, I don't think Longbottom should be angry with you. He should be angry with me."
Harry laughs ruefully. "Yeah, I suppose it is."
"How were you supposed to know not to insult a village green grocer's eggs? Common sense!"
"More tea," Ron says firmly. "Tea always helps."
"Am I supposed to call you Draco now?"
"It's not free, Potter. In exchange for breakfast I demand you purchase proper pajamas."
The two of them sat, silent, for the longest time. Some of the colour blanched from Harry’s cheeks, but he hadn’t fled. That was positive.
"Actually, I need to go home and take care of Yip."
“Not particularly,” Harry answered. “I spent most of them eating Ron’s Every-Flavour beans and worrying about murderous despots.” He reached over and picked up a pair of scratch-mitts. “And yes, Molly Weasley has been on at me, making guesses, and asking me whether I want to find out. Apparently, a March moon is very auspicious for conceiving a daughter.”
"You don't have to be so churlish, I'm just making conversation."
“The Quidditch accident,” Draco supplied, memories of that significant day flashing through his mind, just as they always did whenever they were mentioned. “I was there. But Mr Weasley-”
Every day or so, Harry would Floo to Half-Moon Place, and the two of them would spend a couple of hours in each other’s company. Sometimes they read, and sometimes they watched films. Sometimes they listened to the wireless, and sometimes Draco snoozed on the settee. It was pleasant; companionable.
. Gasping as the pain came once again, Draco sank down onto the carpet, his whole-body trembling as the sensation intensified. It moved to his lower back, clamping down on the muscles there, making him sway; making his thoughts splinter.
“Rampaging Horntails wouldn’t keep me from it,” Harry answered, his hand never leaving Draco’s tummy. He seemed giddy, and Draco could see the fondness – the
“You alright?” Greg asked, looking over at Draco. He’d vanished the Bubble-Head Charm. and his freckled face was filled with genuine concern. Draco felt all his vexation with the big oaf melt away, just like it always did.
Somewhere along the line, his luck had changed, and he wondered, briefly, when that had happened. As Harry talked about their day ahead, about their lunch with the Weasley-Grangers, and the meeting with Marcus that he’d tried and failed to cancel, Draco listened. He looked across at Harry Potter, looked at the father of his child, and thought about losing to the Harpies. Draco thought about the night that followed it, and everything that had come afterwards.
Harry planned on dropping the bags in his room and leaving right away but as he comes back out to the living room he hears Ron arriving home with a "Hiya Ferret," and Malfoy's answering "Weasel."
"What'd you say?" Ron asks.
“Don’t worry, I’ve brought chocolate syrup,” Harry answered, plating up Draco’s breakfast and casting a Stasis on it. “And the posh lemon curd too. Adrianne informed me multiple times about how grumpy you get whenever your breakfast isn’t spot-on.” He nodded to the fridge. “Pumpkin juice is in there,” he said, “and glasses are in the cupboard. You pour the drinks while I finish making the pancakes.”
"Merlin, don't get in a snit. I was just surprised."
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry’s comment. “It’s my inner sanctum,” he joked back, hoping he sounded suave and not completely like an idiot. “Now, are you going to spend all night admiring my living quarters, or are you actually going to fuck me, because-”
"It's polenta. Ground corn."
Then, without warning, he stepped forward and pulled Draco into a hug, right there in the middle of Wizkids Magical Emporium. Draco was a little surprised, and he felt the eyes of a few of the other shoppers drift over them, but he didn’t pull away. Somehow it felt right, the two of them together, their baby between them, and Draco felt his heart skip a beat.
Three hours later, Harry also learns he knows very little about cabbage. And that there are in fact some cabbages in the world with a "beguiling sweetness" on offer. Harry would have kept this revelation to himself and saved himself the displeasure of Draco Malfoy's smug face, but the farmer had looked so pleased to show them around the land, so proud to tear a bit of leaf off a pale green cabbage and offer it to him, that Harry couldn't pretend it didn't taste miles better than anything Harry's ever gotten from the Tesco. Not that he's been buying many cabbages, mostly because prior to the Great Cabbage Awakening courtesy of Malfoy and Italy, when Harry previously thought of cabbage he thought of a tasteless pile of mush and
“Thank you,” Harry said. “Thank you for letting me be a part of this. It’s overwhelming, isn’t it? That this is our baby and that they’re growing inside of you right now. Feels like the most powerful magic in the world.”
"You're at Malfoy Manor, Potter. They assured me they were sending someone competent this time."
Mediwitch Hayes waved her wand, and spoke the incantation. Harry took hold of Draco’s hand, enfolding it in his own while twirls of shimmering purple filled the room. The enchantment was more intense than the last time the
Maybe he was worried about the match? Draco supposed that could be it. Montrose had Szymon Lewandowski playing tomorrow, a new Seeker from Poland who was widely considered one of the best Quidditch players in the world. Draco knew the home crowd would be right behind Lewandowski, urging him on to win the Snitch and victory.
Malfoys hands are running lightly over Harry's back, his scalp, his ears and shoulders, a tingling sensation following in their wake.
He lets Malfoy in and gets the kettle going.
It was only later, as the two of them were sat at the table, sharing their single perfect pancake, and several rounds of buttered toast, that Draco realised something important.
Draco did. He skipped some of the more embarrassing parts, like the Braxton-hicks and his nightmare, but in the majority his story was reasonably faithful and accurate.
"Sometimes my mother would bring almond croissants to my bedroom for breakfast on Sundays. Just her and me."
“I hope you’re breathing. Listen carefully, okay? This sounds ridiculous but I want you to remember so I’ll say it first: lean on Narcissa. She is going to be your biggest supporter.”
Harry arrived a few minutes later, Flooing in at ten-thirty exactly, and Draco honestly worried that his jaw might drop to the floor. Luckily it didn’t, nor did anything equally embarrassing happen. Harry always looked gorgeous, but today he looked as if he’d gone to a lot of extra trouble.
Harry rolls his eyes. "Just eat the mash and peas then."
Harry squinted at the parchment behind his round, metal-framed glasses.
“Circe,” Molly interjected, standing up and vanishing the newspaper with a swipe of her wand and a nonverbal spell. “There’s a reason that we don’t get that foul rag delivered. Pay it no mind, either of you! Any wix with a pair of eyes in their head can see that they pair of you will make wonderful parents, and any fool that thinks otherwise isn’t worth even a moment of your time. The people who care about you will know that the
Harry's cheeks heat, being asked so directly. "I think I do, yeah."
The cake is the most chocolate chocolate cake Harry's ever had the pleasure of tasting. He moans without meaning to.
"You know what? I need time to figure this out. I don't even know what I think except that I feel like dragon dung when anyone's mad at me. Except you."
“How did Ron seem?” Other Harry asks, tipping a can of tomatoes into the pan.
"I'm not promising anything," Harry says. There are in fact some things Malfoy could say that would invoke Harry's righteous anger.
"Merlin and Circe both, you're joking. This a joke. You keep your bread in a
It's not the most unpleasant breakfast Harry's ever had because Harry's eaten breakfast with Aunt Marge, each and every time of which was far worse than quietly eating gray crepes with Draco Malfoy. Harry just didn't anticipate that being Malfoy's security would include gray crepe breakfast spreads. He didn't expect his childhood bully to ask him how Harry takes his tea. Next Harry will be grabbing a pint with Dudley.
"No, I'm not allowing you to get a bright orange throw blanket. You'll make your flat look like Chudley Cannon sick-up."
Draco’s prick was so full, and aching, and he could feel it leaking against the cover of the bedsheets. He didn’t want to touch himself though, for he knew he’d ejaculate within a couple of tugs. Harry was a feast for his every sense, and Draco was famished and randy; determined to indulge for as long as he possibly could. He pressed back into Harry, lifting his leg as high as he could, letting Harry move even more deeply inside of him.
"Do you see any elves here?" Malfoy snaps, his face flushed in anger.
"You soft boil your eggs?"
Draco couldn’t stand it. Perfect Harry, holding his hand, kissing his bump. Perfect Harry, buying up the whole of Wizkid’s, and telling the
And Harry waits. It's excruciating.
"Christ Malfoy, way to make it awkward."
He is sandwiched between Hermione and Ron in a tight hug and he sinks into it, the warmth of it, the love of it. His friends. His friends who, in a few years, will have a tiny little smiley toddler and another baby on the way. His friends who, if the photographs in the wall are anything to go by, if what Other Harry has said is true, not only accept but approve of and love Draco Malfoy. His friends he keeps pushing away, despite needing them more than ever.
were identical – but one thing was entirely different.
It was a snowy owl, much like the one that Draco remembered Harry having back at school and, when he opened his window, the bird swooped in sedately and landed on his table. There was a message tied to his leg. The roll of parchment was small, and Draco removed it, wondering what the wonder wizard had forgotten to say to him in the café.
Harry frowned at Draco, but he didn’t take the bait. He ripped off a piece of his own garlic bread and ate it thoughtfully before he answered.
Harry tells Ron and Hermione what Neville told him about the things Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle did to him when they were younger. And that Neville thought Harry "of all people" should understand.
"How dare you, you can't take it back. We're going on a date if I have to spell you to my side."
“My darling,” Mother said, giving him a long, appraising look, her grey eyes identical to his own. “You look wonderful. So very handsome. Merlin, but I have missed you! Are you fully recovered from your malady?”
Draco didn’t quite know what to do with himself. He raised his fork to his mouth, thought better of it, and then placed it back onto his plate with a small click of metal against china. He swallowed a gulp of water before he trusted himself to speak. “How long have you known?”
"He said you apologized."
Draco couldn’t help but return the expression, and the two of them stared at each other for an impossibly long moment. He imagined that this was something else written in Harry’s baby book –
"Me? What about Neville?"
Draco didn’t know whether it was Harry’s article in the
Harry enlarges one of the hospital chairs for him and he sits down at Malfoy's bedside. He's wearing his giant moleskin coat with all the pockets even though it's spring and his hair is as wild as ever. Harry feels so relieved to see him. So much less alone.
"No! No, nothing like that. Threats sometimes. Suffice to say I felt it was safer to be a little less 'dramatic'."
Harry barely has time to realise what is happening before he’s assaulted by the nausea and the disorientating feeling. When he finally realises what the pulling at his gut and the tingling on his fingers and toes means, he’s falling on his arse, already back in the dark old Grimmauld Place he knows, face to face with Hermione’s bright, worried eyes.
Hermione goes soft at these words and leans up to kiss Ron on the cheek and Harry feels like he's living in a parallel universe where Malfoy didn't call Hermione a Mudblood every chance he got.
"How come I know you're not stupid? That's an excellent question. I'm not sure there's a satisfactory answer."
"Are you sick?"
. They’d been the latest of Harry’s passions to take root in Draco’s life. Harry had described them as classic, although they sounded nothing like the wizarding opera that his parents had taken him to as a child.
Malfoy looks up from inspecting the cupcakes, a little pink cheeked and says, "Well try harder."
"Why would we skip dessert when we could not skip dessert?"
"Thank you," Malfoy says, with that little pleased smile of his. "Well shall we get back to it? I'm looking forward to having a real table again."
Perfect Harry, who’d called him a mistake, and who had Apparated away after they’d slept together.
"No, that's the Fiori di Sicilia extract I added."
"Whatever," Harry says, pulling Malfoy closer. "What's for dinner?"
"It's a family heirloom."
"I thought maybe we'd get back into bed and eat scones and strawberries."
Harry rolls his eyes and Summons the cocoa. "There."
Harry sits down in huff, crossing his arms over his chest. "Stubborn arse."
Even the nothing, in-between times had been lovely, where they’d been sat, reading and watching telly, and Harry would absentmindedly rest his hand on Draco’s tummy. Draco’s face burned with embarrassment, and suddenly the day was too bright, and he was too hot. His armpits were sweaty, and it was as if all the air had been sucked from the room.
Draco smiled and moved closer to Harry. He let himself be enveloped by Harry’s arms before he replied. “I love you,” Draco said, the words slipping from his lips as easily as a charm. “And there isn’t anywhere I’d rather be.”
"Harry, come here."
The older wizard might have replied, but before he got a chance to there was a cacophony of noise. The Weasleys had returned; flush from the afternoon sun, giddy, and joshing each other loudly. Harry barged into the room before a few minutes had passed, agitated magic bouncing from his person. His face was knotted with worry.
Malfoy sits down and pours himself a cup of tea as if he's pouring for the queen, all straight backed posture and not a clink and then serves himself a crepe, fixing it with peevish care, smoothing on just the right amount of clotted cream, arranging his oranges just so, drizzling the honey with a ridiculous flourish. Harry watches the process trying not to laugh. Malfoy looks up from his carefully arranged crepe and clicks his tongue, looking irritably over at Harry.
"I don't think they'll fit, I have a very tight arse."
“Hello,” Draco said, giving Harry a stupid little wave as he walked towards him. Ugh, but ever his voice sounded odd, croaky and false. “You’re right on time,” he added, cringing at the sound of himself.
"Where are we going, then?"
If Harry was going to be visiting Half-Moon Place, Draco was determined to be prepared.
Harry opened the door, and was gone as speedily as he had arrived.
Harry made a small, uncommitted noise, and lifted a fork of pasta to his mouth. The two wizards ate for a moment, focused on their food.
“What’s on your mind?” Harry asked, putting down his fork and meeting Draco’s eyes. “You’re thinking. I can always tell.”
"Bacon, Malfoy, is not vegetarian."
Malfoy smiles at that. "Cast a cooling charm at the dough?"
“So, what are we waiting for?” Harry asked, taking Draco’s hand, giving him an infectiously enthusiastic grin. “I’m not sweating away the next hour hanging around in St Mungo’s, not if I can’t help it. Come on.” He continued, guiding him towards the door. “Let’s make a day of it. We’ll go to Frobisher’s, collect the potion, and then we could go out baby shopping? You’re not the only one panicking about getting things ready for our little one. Even Kreacher has scoffed at my lack of preparedness! I need a crib, clothes, toys… Basically everything. I suspect the last baby that Grimmauld Place saw was you, Draco. I’d like to get a few things, or at least see what’s out there. We could go back to Fratelli’s, if you liked. We had a brilliant meal, last time we visited.”
or their half-baked headlines, Draco. I’ll do whatever it takes to raise this baby together.” Harry leant across the table then, and took Draco’s hand in his own. It was warm and rough, and Draco felt the comforting fission of the other wizard’s strong magic. His fingers, clasped by Harry’s own, felt like they were on fire. “I mean, I’m not an entire prat. I’ve come here with my eyes open. I know that it’s not going to be easy, but if you’re… if
Somehow, Harry’s simple presence was enough to calm Draco’s anxieties; he expected it was his baby’s magic, recognising that of their other dad and responding to it. Harry had taken to laying his hand on Draco’s forearm whenever they sat together, and Draco could feel the love the other wizard held for their unborn child permeate his skin. He could feel Harry’s protectiveness and his fears, but Draco could also feel his care and his anticipation. It was a heady concoction, and Draco had been guilty of taking Harry’s hand more than once, and guiding it to his unclothed skin. “It helps me relax,” Draco would murmur, though Harry hadn’t offered any criticism of his behaviour.
"Yeah. You know, since you hate it."
showed it was nearly four o’clock. Bloody Potter hadn’t roused him, and he’d dreamt the afternoon away.
"There are two. There are two because we want you to live with us."
"Your favorite."
There was nothing else for it. With a slash of his wand, and an
," Malfoy says, tugging on Harry's hands and shirt and waist until Harry's sat on his lap, knees on either side of Malfoy's narrow hips.
Harry laughed at that, and then he leant in and kissed Draco once again.
Malfoy shrugs, unbothered.
that blasted baby book. Secondly, you’re not getting past the entrance hall without croissants. Many, many croissants.”
Ten minutes later Harry is at Tesco comparing tins of tomato soup. He gets the one that looks the fanciest.
“I can be the best,” Harry answered, not missing a beat. Then he moved in, kissing Draco’s cheek, all heat, and stubble, and then Draco’s jaw and the corner of his mouth. Harry took his time, and Draco could barely credit that such an archetypal Gryffindor could be so patient. Draco hadn’t ever been kissed with such devotion before, and by the time Harry reached his lips, Draco was a half-melted, hormonal mess. The kiss wasn’t deep or especially long, but the sensuality of it left Draco weak. “I can do that,” Harry said, “for you.”
Harry had brought other things too: a new pillow that he vowed would help Draco to sleep better, a luxurious bath elixir that smelt sharp and citrusy, and even a baby blanket, embroidered with tiny Snitches that flew and danced around the material. It was a beautiful piece of craft, and must have cost a dozen Galleons. Draco told Harry off for the extravagance – he wasn’t even out of the first trimester yet! – but Harry had only shrugged.
Malfoy tucks his head into the crook of Harry's neck and rubs his hands up and down Harry's back.
Internally, Draco cringed. He’d said so many awful things about the Burrow to Ron while he’d been at Hogwarts. He’d pondered, loudly, whether the family ate dinner in the pig-pen, whether they all bathed together to save on bathwater, and even whether Ron and his brothers took it in turns to sleep in the only bed they owned.
"What's in the porridge?" Harry asks again, shuffling a little closer. Malfoy is wearing a really soft jumper and Harry likes the way it feels under his hands.
"Are those for me?" Malfoy says, brightening in between potions.
"I'll have you know I've been to the Tesco before and I said none of those things," Malfoy says, sticking his nose in the air.
Everybody was full of questions – ‘did they want a boy or a girl? Had Draco’s morning sickness abated? Had they felt the baby move yet? – but Draco never felt like their interest was prying or meddlesome. The Weasleys were enthusiastic and kind, and before he even realised what was happening, Draco felt some of the nerves in his belly begin to melt away. He didn't feel like a Kneazle on hot bricks any longer.
many times, but he’d never seen coverage like this. '
Malfoy takes another sip with an exaggerated grimace. "Awful," he says.
A flicker of sadness crossed Mother’s face, just like it always did whenever Lucius was mentioned. “Your father spent too many years concerned with the endorsement of others, Draco. He lost everything he held dear because he believed wanted power. His hubris broke our world into pieces, Draco, and like the pure-blood fool I was, I followed him into the mouth of madness. I give a prayer of thanks, every single day that Merlin allowed you to be saved in the Room of Lost Things, Draco.” Narcissa wiped away a tear. “I nearly lost you once, and won’t lose you, or my granddaughter, over foolish customs that have no place in the modern world.”
"Isn't it?"
"Er—" Harry says, thrown somewhat by the sudden change in topic. "Some experimental spell, right?"
“They keep asking when you’re going to come over,” Harry said, casually as anything. “Molly does a big Sunday dinner every few weeks, and everybody piles into the Burrow. Ron and Hermione… Gins and Oliver. The whole kit and caboodle. I was going to ask you later, but now is as good a time as any. Will you come with me this Sunday? They all want to meet you, Draco. They want to get to know you a bit better.”
Draco had been a mistake. They’d had a good time in bed, but the relationship part – the making breakfast, and staying over part – had been surplus to requirements. If Harry wasn’t ready for a relationship, then he wasn’t likely ready for a baby either, as sure as dragons loved gold. His being rejected had felt terrible, but Draco couldn’t abide the idea of their child growing up knowing that the Chosen One – the Boy Who Lived – didn’t want them.
"It is a bit though, isn't it?"
He’s still facing the pot on the hob, pouring a generous glug of olive oil into it.
"What does it look like?"
"So, what did happen with Ginny?"
"Are you—? I'm sorry I think I might be having a stroke because it sounds like you're defending Malfoy."
was very much the same as the previous appointment. Sparkly purple magic filled the air and coalesced into the form of their baby. “Oh, it’s very clear,” Hayes said, the anticipation in the room palpable. “A little girl, gentlemen. You’re having a daughter.”
He’s sitting down to write when Ron comes back, passing him a quill and sitting across from him, a confused look on his face.
don't tell me you're one of those straight men."
Harry huffs a laugh, grateful someone's said it. "Maybe Umbridge will invite us for a game of pick up Quidditch next week."
Ron smiles softly and puts his arm around Hermione. "Such a know-it-all," he says fondly.
The bedroom doesn’t come with big surprises, except for the ring box he finds in the bedside table on Other Harry’s side. Two thin silver bands with the words ’
"What are you on about?"
"I wondered where all the furniture had gone."
Harry shuffles around not knowing what to do. He's never been someone's security guard before. He's pretty sure he doesn't need to hover at Malfoy's elbow but he doesn't know where to hover instead. His body feels awkward, like he's taking up too much space, especially in comparison to Malfoy, who seems like he knows exactly what to do.
He eats a nectarine standing up, juice running down his chin and forearm, dripping into the wide white ceramic sink. Petrol enters the kitchen then, a quick panther-like prowl. She eyes him and his nectarine and lets out a loud yelp. Harry doesn’t know if nectarines are safe for cats, so he apologises instead.
It’s comforting that his house is still his, even if it’s a Harry he can’t recognise as himself. The biggest surprise is that this Other Harry seems to be extremely close to Draco Malfoy. Extremely close in the romantic sense of things, which Harry really, really can’t understand. Harry watches his Other Self tilt his face up towards (a jeans-wearing!) Draco Malfoy, who looks at him and smiles before leaning in and kissing him on a loop. It makes him feel dizzy. And he really doesn’t have the time to unpack whatever
Malfoy tells Harry to levitate the tray and Harry does, grumbling just for the fun of it, and follows Malfoy through the endless cold corridors of the Manor. Despite Harry's many visits to Malfoy's home, Harry has never actually seen Malfoy's bedroom.
"Of course we want you to live with us. We're the
He showed it to his friends, a wry smile on his face.
Harry sipped his Butterbeer. “You’ve been missing out, Draco,” Harry said, obviously pleased at the sight of Draco devouring his food. “The wizard who owns it used to be a colleague of Arthur Weasley in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. The two of them got called out to a Muggle restaurant one day – some prat had charmed the knives and forks to stick to people’s fingers! – and the owner realised that they could do a far better job. Fratelli’s was the result, and the Weasleys, dragging me in tow, have been honoured guests here ever since. Ron, ‘Mione and I eat here all the time. The food’s great and no-one gives us any hassle. It’s a win-win.”
"I do mean it. But that's not what you actually want. You want retribution, you want me to prove I'm suffering for all my wrong doing. You want me to cry or crawl on my knees or be filled with self-loathing because that would neatly fit with your punitive and simple conception of justice."
Whenever he thought about Harry, there was always a good reason to put him off for another hour or so.
"No, you have to make me soup."
"Oh."
Draco floundered at the question, not sure how to describe to Victoire what Harry and he were to each other. The idea of denying it, and seeing the confusion on little Victoire Weasley’s face felt puzzlingly heartbreaking.
afraid we all saw," Ron says, giving into a wide grin.
Harry does hold his commentary, no longer pretending he's not avidly watching Malfoy. He watches his hands with his thin capable fingers measuring. He watches his arms, sinewy and strong, whisking. The cake seems to come together in no time at all and Malfoy slides it into the oven and comes to stand in front of Harry.
"Hmm," Luna says. "You do like Draco, though, don't you?"
One of those war criminals is Malfoy's father. Harry looks to Malfoy to see his reaction, which is calmly eating arugula salad.
Malfoy still looks very sick. He's always pale but now he practically blends in with the white sheets. His eyes are sunken and rimmed with dark circles. He looks small and pathetic in the hospital bed. Harry feels another pang of guilt that Malfoy was cursed under Harry's watch. It brings up all the other times in his life he's been careless, thoughtless, too late, too little. If only Harry had thought to go to Snape, he might've saved Sirius from falling through the veil. If he'd been quicker he could have saved Cedric, and Hedwig and Dobby… These thoughts spiral around Harry's head, clouding everything while he watches Malfoy sleep, too still. He'll go mad sitting here with nothing to do.
Draco couldn’t bear to say the word. Whyever had he thought this was a solid plan?
"Oh," Harry says. He had no idea buckwheat flour was gray.
Harry didn’t reply to his apology. All he did was sit there, staring intently at Draco, scratching the scruffy shadow of stubble on his chin. Draco tried his best to salvage his pride. “Go home,” Draco urged. “Please.”
"So the beloved Golden Trio live together? I can't wait for the
"Of course there's a place, Potter, there are several."
“I did, early on,” Draco said, taking a sip. “I think it’s all vanished now, thank Merlin… I’m feeling good at the moment. I’m nowhere near as tired as I was, and the baby is fluttering all the time. It’s all starting to get very real now, especially with Harry here buying up half of Wizkid’s Emporium earlier this week.”
As it turns out, the cake
Ron pokes his head round from inspecting the kitchen. He doesn't look all too surprised by Harry's question.
He stroked a hand over the side of his burgeoning bump while he waited. It was definitely, undeniably, the fault of their little one, no question about it.
Arthur was kind though. “Nothing to be sorry for,” he said, “there’s many things in life that deserve an apology, but in my experience, falling in love never requires a wizard to ask for forgiveness. You’re right. Harry won’t let you down. I’ve known him since he was a schoolboy, and there’s nobody alive that cares more for his loved ones than he does. He loves you too, but you need to bear with him. Never had a family of his own, and then the war came along. Not only dying to save the world, but then having to live the whole rest of your life as the Chosen One. It was the biggest of burdens, but I do think that Harry was getting there. Slowly, but surely." Arthur found Draco's eyes. "Harry was forging his own life, making an existence for himself, and then what happened?”
"As soon as I can drag my arse out of this chair."
Other Harry has a busy
Malfoy obliges, his grip on Harry surprisingly strong for someone in a hospital bed. He pulls Harry down to meet his lips and fucking devours him, sucking on Harry's lips and tongue. Harry has no idea what's gotten into Malfoy, but he certainly doesn't mind being kissed like
Then, at that thought, his quill stops as his breath catches, a big blot of ink forming at the end of his last sentence.
"Malfoy."
"What does it matter what color the yolk is?"
An indeterminate amount of time later, an hour or maybe a week, Malfoy says, "I need to go into Diagon Alley for a few things."
"Cheers, Ferret." Ron takes a kouign amann and his butterbeer and disappears into the hallway again.
, and apparently, he has a lot to say.
Draco thought of his mummy, sitting primly at her dining table when they'd met for lunch. She’d called his and Harry’s lovemaking “sacred, blessed by Merlin,” and he’d thought her language old-fashioned, almost quaint. Perhaps it had been he that was wrong, though. They’d only been together one night, but that had been enough to create a new life; enough to create a family.
"It's impossible to dislike French food," Malfoy says, whisking quickly now. The sauce in the pan, which momentarily looked chunky and unappetizing when Harry first poured in the milk, is starting to become smooth and creamy.
Harry looks around the kitchen. There are several mixing bowls out and a few pans on the hob and one pot of water boiling away. There's also no breakfast.
"What Hermione said."
So he got out of bed and separated egg yolks and whites and melted butter and mixed warm milk together with yeast and honey and added flour, cup by cup until he had a rich yellow dough gently rising on the counter.
"You're wearing sweatpants with Oxfords and a button up and sweater."
Pans and he didn’t see each other as regularly now as they had as children, but theirs was the sort of relationship where the passage of time didn’t matter. Being the consummate Slytherin, Draco decided to break the news by Firecall.
"I'm glad," Draco says, his usual reply, but today he looks especially pleased.
Draco shivered in the charm-cooled examination room as the witch had cast her magic over him, and then he’d wept at the sight of their baby. The umbilical cord was well-formed, and the amniotic sac was doing its job, nestling their baby and keeping them safe.
