Potter looked earnest.  “Malfoy, I won’t touch you if you don’t want me to, but maybe you should try to think of someone he could train – your shoulders are up around your ears right now, and if you also need massage for circulation in your legs….”
“Hmm.” Harry’s eyes searched Draco’s face. Then they dropped to his lips. “Do you think we could, uh, negotiate another kiss?”
Harry’s alarm must have shown on his face. “Sorry, but I only saw them briefly, and I’m, er, not much of a dancer at the best of times.”
“No, that was one of the things I was mistaken about,” Draco said.  “Shall we make a wild Scottish landscape around your railway track?”
“Oh – I didn’t realise how late it is - I’d better let you go,” Potter said.  “Saturday night coming, I expect you have plans.”  Draco didn’t, but he assumed Potter was excusing himself to go get ready for his own date.
So Harry gave her the golden apple, and at night she brought him up to Draco’s bedroom, where he lay sleeping.  Harry gave him a little kiss, to wake him with a nice surprise, but Draco still slept.  Harry called his name, and shook him, and called to him:
“I asked a librarian for a children’s book with a character named Teddy.  Did you know that Muggle librarians are actually helpful?  Not like Pince at all.”
Oddly enough, that earned him a wry half smile of acknowledgment.  Then something small, shiny and golden was flying at Harry’s head.  Reflexively he snatched it from the air, and found himself holding a wad of foil biscuit wrapper.   They didn’t make Snitches like they used to.
Draco and Harry went after them, more slowly.  The sinking sun flamed across the sky and water.  They watched until it was gone, leaving purple streaks of cloud.  The moon hung low overheard.
“Ah, Potter.  Most people make appointments, but then you’ve always been one for the direct approach.”
A few hours later, the coin around Draco’s neck warmed suddenly against his skin.  He pulled it out and saw a heart traced on its surface.  Nothing else.  He wasn’t surprised when Harry – and Granger, and Weasley – didn’t return.  Not that night, nor the next, nor in the weeks to come.
Malfoy choked.  His eyes were dancing with laughter which he was unsuccessfully trying to disguise as a cough.
But Snape was not the master of Dumbledore’s wand, Harry argued, Snape had served Dumbledore, out of love for Harry’s mother.  “Dumbledore died the master of that wand,” Harry said.
“Is that all it takes?  What, is this opposites day or something?  So I should say, ‘Harry, I adore your dark tempestuous locks’?”
Rutherford offered them some fresh caught mice to express her gratitude, but they said they preferred deep-fried tofu.  There was no accounting for taste, so she thanked them again and flew off to Osaka with the message clutched firmly in her talons.
“Wrackspurt dust?  You actually believe that invisible things fly in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy?”
They finished their duet smiling into each other’s eyes, riding a current of energy golden as a sunbeam.  “Oh, wait – I have another piece for you,” Harry said suddenly, and then ducked his head and raked his fingers through his hair so it stood up even more wildly than usual.  He fiddled around with the mouthpiece again while Draco waited out this burst of nervousness, then gave a shy smile, took a deep breath, closed his eyes and began to play.
“Well, we know about ‘Sex After the Hex’,” Harry smiled, quoting the title of Draco’s workshop. He opened the case, got out a reed, and dropped it into a cup of water sitting on an end table.  “I thought we could also have sax before the sex.”
The garter snake, who turned out to be quite chatty, said it would be happy to come along if they could keep it from freezing.  They could swing by its home in California (the San Francisco area) on the way back.   Harry bought a multiple use, open-ended Portkey, they packed some warmer clothes (and their brooms again), and they left.  The Portkey trip wasn’t bad this time, and they arrived in Alaska in the morning.
“He mustn’t think you’re laughing at him, that’s fatal,” Draco said.  “Go have a gingernut, Ignatius, O Owl of My Heart!  We’ll be with you in … a while.”
“So you brought me flowers?” Malfoy asked, deadpan.  He eyed the small pot in Harry’s hands, with its slender stems of fragrant white bells.
They flew around for a while just to explore. Draco came face to face with a ridiculously cute tree kangaroo, and Harry was startled when he nearly collided with a huge butterfly.
He came in sight of a narrow bridge.  There was a sign, “Beware of Monkeys.”  Harry saw a group of tourists cross, snacks and sticks out as the monkeys approached.  He tightened the straps on his pack so the animals couldn’t tear it off, and headed to the bridge by himself.
Draco frowned. “We are not amused, are we Old Timer?” The dog pushed his graying muzzle into Draco’s hand. “Someone there has a very juvenile sense of humor.”
He pushed his fear down until it was just another layer of the dread he’d been living with all year.
“I don’t really understand the magic, to be honest,” Malfoy said.  “But then, I’ve never fully understood how the ship from Durmstrang can come up through the Great Lake at Hogwarts, or how the Knight Bus seems to Apparate.  Wuffley can take this boat anywhere there was once a waterway, even if it’s changed course since then, or run dry, or gone underground.  When traveling that way, the boat is invisible to Muggles. It may be a form of time travel.”
The next morning he was sitting in the Beauxbatons library, looking at pictures of Triptolemus, the Greek demi-god of agriculture who flew around the country distributing wheat seeds and teaching people to grow them. In some stories, Triptolemus flew in a chariot pulled by a pair of winged dragons (a ‘Draco car’, one writer called it). Draco wasn’t sure he could handle a team of dragons, that sort of recklessness was more Harry’s style.
Harry looked at him sharply. But just then Arthur came back and Malfoy turned to him, making his excuses and asking to leave the car there until he could return for it. Arthur assented cheerfully, Malfoy retrieved a broom from the car, and once again Harry watched him sail gracefully off into the sky. Longing tugged at him.
“He’s improved it a lot,” Lavender said, coming in with a tray of tea and cake. “It made a big difference.”
The light shifted in the room – the wind chasing clouds across the sun outdoors – and for a moment Harry seemed to see a different Draco Malfoy.  One who looked a bit sad, tired and uncertain –  one who could be hurt.  One who Harry didn’t, perhaps, want to hurt.
He plunged his hand into the dark thicket of tight curls at Harry’s groin.  That once-forbidden forest, that lush undergrowth from which the sacred tree was even now rising.  A surge of wanting brought Draco, too, erect.  Springeth the wude nu, now the wood revives, and didn’t man used to kindle fire by rubbing two woods together?  Hot, hot in hand.
Draco sighed.  Greg had been a bit fragile since Vince died, and it was good to see him enthusiastic.  He was a born follower, and if he’d decided to follow Luna for the moment, well, she was benign, though batty.  Which was more than Draco could say about his own past influence.
Harry grinned like a loon.  “You think I’m yeast in cloud loaves?  Why did they throw me out of sky’s pantry?”
“You are a force of nature, Harry Potter,” Draco said when they’d caught their breath.  “Here’s part of a poem I learned.  It’s another by Dafydd ap Gwilym, but no knobs in this one.  This is you.”  He leaned over Harry with shining eyes and recited.
The Floo roared to life and Andromeda stepped through.  “Thank you so much, Draco!  I came back as quickly as I could!  I hope Teddy wasn’t a bother.  And Harry, you came after all!  You shouldn’t have troubled yourself, I know it’s been forever since you had a date.”
Draco was taken secretly to Grimmauld Place while they tried to decide what to do. He met his cousin Nymphadora for the first time.  She was so utterly unlike either his mother or aunt Bellatrix that he wondered what her mother could be like.
Draco pulled the handkerchief away and looked at it.  Across the damp cloth was a dry zigzag where the scar’s heat had evaporated the water.  “Damn,” he muttered.  “What were you dreaming about?”
“Oh, you must be exhausted! I forgot the time difference from China. Stay here tonight – I can Transfigure the couch into a bed for you, just a minute.”
Her bright orange eyes stared at him.  This was not Buckbeak, the one he’d had such a disastrous encounter with years ago.  The one he had insulted because in those years, any ally of Potter’s had to be an enemy of Draco’s.  No, this was a different beast, and a fresh start.
“Of course you can.  And now you want to.”  Malfoy beamed at him, and dropped his change in the jar.
Draco did not have a date with Harry Potter to see theatre, or play Quidditch, or anything else.  Draco was not on a date at all.
There were few things Harry wanted less than to pay a social call on Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy.  He had never understood why Lucius was out of Azkaban already, after serving only a few years after the death of Voldemort.  And Harry would be perfectly content never to see Malfoy Manor again.
“I believe there has been good progress, sir.  My centaur contact will have more information for me in a month.”
“Oh, smooth line.”   Harry was still laughing, which broke up the kiss a bit at first, and their noses bumped.  First sober kiss in the full light of day.  But he felt a giddy confidence, backing toward the bed, tugging Draco along.
That wasn’t what this was about, but Harry Potter was looking at him with compassion and Draco wasn’t about to contradict him. Snowflakes were caught in Potter’s messy curls and Draco yearned to brush them out. Something of that helpless loss must have shown on his face.
Saturday found him home waiting.  No Potter.  Inconsiderate, these heroes.  Draco might need to eat all the tea biscuits himself.
“Too long for a nose!  But that’s not the point, Harry.  Now I’ve lost the chance to break the curse, and I have to go back to my aunt‘s castle for the wedding, and we can never be together again.”
“Flesh, bones and blood vessels are more easily healed.  Nerves are much more complex. In this case, the most productive thing for you would be physical therapy for rehabilitation and some emotional counseling.”
Draco smiled.  “My mother used to sing it to me.  We called it the glow-worm song.  She thought there was more to it, but that’s all she remembered.  What did your – your aunt? –  sing to you at bedtime?”
“Draco?  Well, I’m kind of long and twisty and not that easy to pick out.  And a confirmed northerner, I’m not sure you can see anything this far south.  Maybe a pointy chin at the right time of year.  But let’s see what else we can find.”
And that’s how Harry found himself traveling back to Malfoy Manor on the Knight Bus with a veterinarian who spent the whole trip looking out the window, a sleeping Mooncalf, and Luna teaching him lullabies about moonlight.
“Harry! It’s so brilliant to have you back! Are you here for long? What have you been doing? You remember Lavender, of course you do!”
“Hmm,” Draco said.  “I could do research there myself; Sichuan has some specimens of magical bamboo that grow nowhere else.  But isn’t the food there blisteringly spicy?”
Malfoy lay back and Harry did too, looking straight up at blue sky. He flung an arm up to block the sun, but kept the other hand touching Malfoy’s, little fingers just grazing.
“Um, I don’t think it’s supposed to come to that point, Draco.  I think you’re supposed to keep them calm.  So they let you get to the honey.”
“We’ll just get our things stowed, then,” Malfoy said.  He picked up Fern and carried her aboard, then returned to levitate their luggage onto the small deck.
Here again was the large entrance hall with the rich carpet and the ancestral portraits.  He would have to go into the drawing room too.
Draco leaned his head back against Harry’s arm. “And the topic today was tricky.  Sexuality is a particularly touchy subject after a disability.”
“We had to get the locket – the Horcrux – it was in a basin, covered with potion, and the only way to get to it was by drinking the potion. He made me promise to make him drink it, so I did, but then he was begging me – begging me to stop, and it was poison, but I didn’t, I didn’t stop and he was screaming, it was killing him and I kept pouring it down his throat….”
“Stop the horses,” Potter said, and Draco slowed them to a halt. The acrid stink of dragon smoke was getting stronger, and the horses rolled their eyes and pranced nervously in place. Draco spoke soothingly to calm them. He risked gathering all the reins in one hand so that he could reach his wand.
“Partly because I haven’t been around the wizarding world much for a long time.  I ran away from reactions like that.”
But here was Herman the baby giant squid at the Hospital and Haven for War-Damaged Beasts. So. “How can we help you and your siblings?”
Potter reached up to him and Draco hauled him up behind onto the broom.  The peacocks swirled up around them in a noisy storm and Draco shot up higher.  Fortunately their tails weighed them down and they were rather clumsy flyers.
“Clearly this is a critical issue that has not received the attention it deserves.  I will certainly speak to the Ministry.  But…”  Draco frowned again.  “Why have you not spoken to me of it before?  This is exactly what a Centaur Liaison should be learning about.”
When Draco returned they made plans to visit Qing Cheng Shan, the sacred Taoist mountain. Next day they passed between stone statues of guardian lions (which looked nothing like any lion Harry had ever seen) to reach an ancient structure with arched entrances, gilded calligraphy, and a tiered, tiled roof elaborately decorated with carvings and painted figurines. The edges of the roof curved up like wings. It was the gateway to the mountain.
Harry remembered Teddy requesting cherry flavour. And the potion delivery for Lavender, and Draco saying it was a busy time of month… It was all making sense.
“Nothing would have been the same without him,” Draco assured Mr Banda, who welcomed him and went off to check on the sound system.
At the end, when he was very weak and in great pain, Dumbledore asked Snape for a “mercy killing”.  Dumbledore had wanted Harry there, so that Harry did not blame Snape, and Harry had wanted Draco there.  Draco remembered the vow his own mother had insisted on – if Snape did not kill Dumbledore now, Snape too would die.  Draco shivered.
“I read about them in a booklet I picked up when I flew out to look at the Pictish stones that Dean Thomas told me about.  The carvings were really interesting, you should see the Pictish Beast.  It has a long curving snout – or maybe it’s a duck-bill? –and some sort of back-curving horn or hair or antenna.  And curly feet.”
“Oh – well, the Slytherin rooms were under the lake, you know, and some of them had windows. I suppose that’s how I got interested.”  Malfoy was becoming more animated. “The fish here are gorgeous.  Indigo, electric blue, gold, purple, red, all sorts of stripes and speckles and blends of color.”  His hands darted through the air like the fish amid the rocks.  “There’s one called Dragon Blood Peacock, how could I resist?”
The bear stretched and ambled forward.  After a while Harry rubbed it behind the ears, as he used to do with the neighbour’s dog, and it sighed.
Draco learned that Æthelflæd had vouched for him and his house arrest was over, but he was expected to continue working with the haven for a year, longer if he wished; since he enjoyed the work, that was no problem.
“Well, but everyone should have a chance. Sometimes a body needs a little help. Maybe I can knit up a little something….” She reached for her knitting basket and copy of
“That sounds like a literary quotation run through house-elf syntax,” Draco observed, momentarily distracted.  “Have you been reading?”
The man stopped abruptly and shocked grey eyes snapped up to Harry’s own.  He looked at Harry blankly for a moment, saying nothing.  It couldn’t be Malfoy.  It had to be Malfoy.
“Yeah, Padma…” Hermione paused, her face lighting up as she searched for words. “You know, we just understand each other so well. With most people, I have to think about how to explain or present myself, but with her I can skip that.”
Oh no – that sounded like a leave-taking!  Rutherford swooped down toward him with all speed and saw his startled look just before, once more, he disappeared.
Harry looked mortified and Draco laughed helplessly.  Finally he said, “Teddy was a delight.  And perhaps Harry’s date will forgive him.  We can hope.”
He couldn’t even formulate the questions for all the things he didn’t know how to cope with.  But Baines was already leaving.
The Quidditch match itself was well-attended and hard-fought.  The home team won, and the Meteorites put on a dazzling display of their signature broom-sparkling in their victory celebration.  Draco got a couple of the team members to autograph the souvenir birch-bark moose call that he’d bought for Teddy.  All in all it was thoroughly satisfying.
“Hmm,” Potter said, as if he wouldn’t have expected that level of craftiness out of the old coot.  “Hey, it must be almost dinner time.  The outside door should open for that.  Are you coming?”
Draco had help in making the Mooncalf burrow from Merfley, who had returned from his ballet lesson. They’d fixed up a comfy nest in a quiet spot by the time Æthelflæd, Luna and Potter pulled up in the Knight Bus with the beast. Æthelflæd even approved of it.
As he was reading, Draco suddenly felt heat in a small round spot on his chest, as though a sunbeam had caught him just there.  But the sun was at his back.  He pulled out the coin he wore on a string around his neck, the one that was linked to Harry’s, and there again was the trace of a heart.  Just like eight months earlier – the last time Harry had said goodbye.
“Look, Malfoy, I inherited a feud from my father and I didn’t even know about it.  I know it’s not easy to end something like that, but…”
Rutherford huffed in annoyance.  Maybe she should forget this wild-Potter chase and go back to England.  Draco would not blame her.  But then she recalled the lines of the poem she carried:
“It’s your birthday in the summer, isn’t it?  We could get you a bird.  You used to have such a beautiful white owl.”
“It was a very intricate dance,” Harry said. “I wonder if they forget it if they don’t practice? Æthelflæd thinks this Mooncalf is quite young.”
After a moment she said simply, “Harry Potter. Come in, Hermione will be thrilled. She stepped out but she’ll be back in a minute.”
.  At first I thought she meant a story about an adventurous small dog, but it turns out to be someone named Darwin who got all excited about finches.  They had self-transfiguring beaks, or something.”
Draco’s face became rapt.  His chest rose on a long in-drawn breath and his head fell back.  He came with a series of small cries, and a look of peace drifted across his sharp features as he melted back onto the bed.  When he turned to Harry, his smile was so warm and open that Harry felt his heart expand.
“No, I found it written in a textbook that used to be his.  Back when he was a sixth year student himself.”
When she was at leisure to attend to Potter again, she heard him calling, “Thanks again, Charlie!  Goodbye!”  Rutherford looked on in frustration as once more Potter disappeared, leaving a waving red-head behind.
Draco flushed.  “I apologize if I have been making a nuisance of myself.  I had hoped I could be of assistance or improve communication between our peoples.”
“There wasn’t delivery in the mountains. And when I came back out, there was quite a stack of them, but to be honest I wanted to see you both so much, I decided to just come talk to you in person.”
Some months later, an Owl arrived for them from Luna. Harry read it aloud over breakfast. “Dear Harry and Draco, I hope you are well and not troubled by Nargles. In my reading of interspecies independent journalism, I came across this clipping from the
“That’s lovely,” Hermione said. “Oh look, the sun’s come out. Let’s go for a walk. We’ll show you the neighbourhood, Harry.”
But Harry is worried about the fretting child, still tiny, newly born.  He holds the infant awkwardly.
He was shaking when he arrived at his flat.  He’d forgot that his position was supposed to be a joke.  He’d forgot that he wasn’t expected to make a difference.  He’d forgot that Draco Malfoy had nothing to offer.
Draco could smell Harry’s arousal and, when Harry leaned close, feel the tip of his hot cock against Draco’s stomach.  Could he touch it now, or would Harry come too soon?  But Harry was leaning in to kiss him, pressing close against Draco, so Draco wrapped his arms around him, opened his mouth and kissed until he felt his own arousal humming all through him.
“All right.  See you later,” Potter said as he turned to go.  As though that were something to look forward to.
“Mount Emei is famous for its monkeys.  They’re Tibetan macaques.  They’ve been known to throw people’s cameras down ravines if they don’t get what they want.”
Harry, both wildly uncertain and strangely, deeply sure, still could not speak. Lips and tongue found other ways to answer. Draco gasped and then kissed him back. So they began a call and response of kiss and caress, of need and desire, fumbling at first but growing in ardour, until finally they were tumbling into bed together, a tangle of discarded clothes behind them.
He went back to the kitchen and returned with a plate of nice-looking biscuits.  “Come now, Ignatius, I’m sure Potter didn’t mean it, whatever it was.  Have a biscuit, there’s a fine handsome fellow.”
“I know what it means.”  Draco held his eyes in a level gaze.  “So you decided to lock yourself in, Harry?  Taking lessons from your benighted Muggle relatives?”
Draco needed to salvage this situation somehow.  He still didn’t know why Potter wanted to meet him in the first place.  He wasn’t eager to find out, to tell the truth.  No point antagonising Potter any further than could be helped.
“He stopped to protect me, cast a spell to keep me from moving under the invisibility cloak – that’s why you had time for
– I could never manage it.  Snape sure couldn’t, and he turned out to be a hero.  Even Dumbledore couldn’t.  It’s easier to do a little good than to do no harm, I think.”
Harry holds the baby up to rest against his shoulder, and the green blanket falls back to show a shock of blond hair.   Unmistakably pale hair for a wizard, and memories swirl around Lily.
They flew on and on as if they wouldn’t stop until the world’s end, and the North Wind began to tire and weaken so he could barely keep them above the waves.  It was night by the time the North Wind threw Harry ashore beneath the window of a castle.
One afternoon Draco was scattering treats to placate the peacocks when Potter walked up and asked if something was wrong. “They’re just miffed at having to share the spotlight with so many other beasts,” Draco said.
The melody grew strained and tense, and then there was a burst of glory, an exuberant sweep of golden sound, a joyous lift, and then a sweet sweet suspension.
They were handsome, for mittens, Draco had to admit. “Thanks,” he said, pulling on his cloak and following Potter out the door. “But who carries around two pairs of mittens?”
Draco emerged from the forest in a mood of unfamiliar lightness and excitement.  He wanted to share it with someone, and Potter, working in the pea-patch, was the only one around. “I did it, Potter!”  Draco called as he approached.  “I met a hippogriff and it was fine!”
Something skittered in the underbrush and he took his wand out, just as a precaution.  Between the urgency of keeping his job and the annoyance of dealing with Potter, he hadn’t really thought about the dangers of the forest itself.  Now he seemed to see eyes gleaming - red, green, yellow – from murky shadows.  He slowed down and looked more carefully about him.
“The greatest and most gifted head of the Goblin Liaison Office in centuries was Dirk Cresswell,” said Murgatroyd.  “Do you know what happened to him?  He was forced to flee for his life, captured by Snatchers and murdered during the war.  Maybe the same Snatchers who picked up Griphook the Goblin.  Let’s see, where was Griphook imprisoned? Oh yes, Malfoy Manor.  No, you’re not going to be a Goblin Liaison, Malfoy.”  He leaned back in his chair.  “Do you have an interest in working with werewolves?”
Draco stared at him.  He felt leaden.  He didn’t think he could move anything, not even his tongue.  It must be the pain potions.  He managed to shake his head slightly.
Over the next few weeks, as word spread in the wizarding community, animals began to trickle in: a Fire Crab that had lost its flames, an Augurey that had lost its voice, some Bowtruckles whose trees had been destroyed, an aged Muggle dog that had lost its family.
“I’m afraid my husband’s memory is not what it was,” she said as they passed by yet another large painting of splendidly dressed people.  She stopped in front of a picture of a girl at a piano.  “This is Lucinda Malfoy, Draco’s great-great aunt.  He has her hands.”  The girl glanced at them and began to play, her long fingers moving over silent keys.
He padded down the long hallway to the front door and opened it to find an eager-faced young house-elf, cradling a bedraggled Puffskein in his arms. Opening a door for a house-elf—just one more way the world had gone topsy-turvy.
Lavender came in. “Oh, my potion, wonderful! It was so helpful last month. Will you stay and have a cup of tea?”
“Too far.”   Harry put his fingers in his mouth to coat them and leaned forward, but Draco was turning and pushing back against his chest.
Draco was silent a while, considering.  Finally he said “All right.  If you can get them to agree, we’ll try it.  You have to help with the cooking, though.”
So Draco kept busy, but there was always an undercurrent of worry about the war, and Harry, and his family and friends.  On Beltane he felt particularly homesick.  It was a holiday for which Draco felt a special affinity, since his wand was hawthorn, the May bush, Beltane’s sacred tree.
“His house was taken over by the criminally insane and he learned not to mind a little benign battiness.”
“I’m soaked too.” Draco stood and grasped the hem of his own jumper and tugged it over his head, shaking drops of water out of his blond hair as he emerged.  Harry stared at the pale chest and then flushed and looked away as Draco took off his boots and started pulling down his trousers.
“So do I, and that wasn’t the question. Let me rephrase. I’m looking for someone new to beat at chess, Weasley, and your name has come up.”
“Think of it as preliminary research,” Draco said. “A scouting trip.  Even if this is mostly a holiday, you deserve one.”
“Draco – it’s not that I want to leave you behind.  But he’d try to use you to get at me, like he threatened your parents to get at you.  If anything happened to you, I’d never forgive myself.”
Harry laid his cheek down on Draco’s chest.  “This heart?” he murmured.  He pressed a kiss against Draco’s skin. “How is this heart?”
“Trust me, just for a moment,” Draco said, pulling an astounded Harry into the chariot.  Rosemonde turned and rose.
“He isn’t eating,” he said. “I cooked his food until it was soft and cut it up into little pieces but he won’t eat.” He passed his hand in front of the dog’s face, but the dog didn’t react. “I put his eye drops in but he doesn’t seem to see at all.”
Then they set free any other prisoners that Draco’s aunt had bewitched, and divided up the gold and silver that was lying around, and Pansy and Millicent went one way, and Harry and Draco went another, and they all flitted as far as they could from the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon.
Surely their mother tried to be fair, but perhaps a laughing child is easier to love.  Or perhaps that’s just what a jealous child fears.
“Oi!” said Harry.  “I’m not a mosquito.  I’m… a ticklebug!”  He pounced on Teddy, who collapsed in laughter.
“Fine, then, lift your shirt,” Draco said, and began dabbing gently at the cuts left by the tentacle barbs. Harry couldn’t help a hiss of pain. Draco murmured something absently in a low soothing voice and started to smooth the salve over the cuts. It felt cool and had a pleasant herbal smell. He bandaged the cuts deftly.
“It’s only luck the centaur ever talked to me.  If she hadn’t been there to translate for the Anggitay….”
“It’s not like that,” Draco said.  “She’s perfectly aware she’s beautiful, but I don’t get the sense that she’s evil.  Besides, it’s my job – she’s the only centaur who’s talked to me, even if I have no idea what she said. I wonder where she’s from, and what she’s doing here?”
Harry thought he'd recognised the bird’s distinctive markings, but what was Bill's owl Hessie doing delivering mail to Draco Malfoy, of all people?  “How did you get so familiar with Bill Weasley’s owl?” he asked.
Harry wondered what the writing said.  Perhaps it was verse by the poet Xue Tao, who had lived here more than 1000 years ago; the park was created in her honor.
A first-year Hufflepuff girl scurried around a corner toward them.  Greg hit her with a Jelly-Legs Jinx.  She wobbled on her feet and fell over.  Her legs flopped uselessly as she tried to get up.
“You think I’d let you go to Malfoy’s alone?”  Ron sighed.  “All right.  I hope you know what you’re doing, Harry.  I’m going to spend the whole time wanting to punch him, you know.”
“I – thanks.”  Just because the quiet would be such a relief, Harry told himself as he followed Draco back again.  He spent awhile bunching up and tying off the areas of net that had holes in them.  When he had finished, the net was so shortened that it was a bit hard to tuck in around the spare bed, but he didn’t want to mention it.  Feeling awkward, he decided the best thing would be just to go to bed.  It was dark already, and Draco was reading by candlelight.
“This is me.”  Potter’s hands were smaller and less skilled than Baines’, but warmer and drier.  “All right?”
“Oh my god, Parvati, did you make shrikhand?” Padma said. “I love you. You have to try this, Harry.”
“Look,” Harry said.  “I’m cockling my lips.  The better to kiss you with.”  He gave a thorough demonstration.  “Oh look, now your robes are cockled.  We’d better take them off.”
After walking a good ways on winding paths, Draco paused in a little clearing to enjoy the dappled sunshine that found its way in.  He sat on a broad flat stone and tried to whistle the bird-calls he’d learned long ago, before life became such a competition.
“We’re moving,” Harry said.  He could see the banks go by out the window.  He stuck his head out and looked in front and behind.  As the
They sat on a slope with a sweeping view of a valley and hills beyond. Draco lifted his tuba and played a haunting tune, full of loss and regret. Harry turned to him with wondering eyes. “That is an apology for neglect,” Draco said.
Finally Harry pulled back, breathless, and Draco laughed at the exultant look in his lover’s eyes.  His body thrummed with the power of the feeling between them.  He licked his hand and wrapped it around Harry’s stiff cock.  “Hot, you’re so hot,” Draco told him. With a few strokes, Harry came hard, over Draco’s hand and chest.
Draco sighed.  He turned to look for another place to sit and found Harry Potter standing next to him, looking between him and the two empty spots on the sofa.
He’d done it for the laugh of seeing Potter publicly embarrassed, tackled by a gruff singing dwarf in a Cupid costume.  Of course Draco couldn’t afford to have people know he’d written it – they might have got the wrong idea.  So he’d planted the idea that it was Ginny Weasley’s poem.  But no Weasley would have used the words ‘Dark Lord.’
His father’s voice was cold and brittle as an icicle snapping.  “I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam.”
“What was good about their school?  What wasn’t good?  Do you think it was a good school, overall?”   It wasn’t good, some students said, because it wasn’t safe.  It was too close to the war, classes were interrupted, children got hurt.  It was a good school, others argued.  The teachers and soldiers and doctors cared about the students. They taught them. They tried to feed and help and protect them.
Over the next few weeks Æthelflæd proved to be an efficient Healer, although not very sociable. She set the Niffler’s nose properly, re-ignited the Fire Crab, and taught Draco to brew a potion for the Augurey’s throat and ointment for Old Timer’s eyes. She fixed up a cottage on the grounds to live in and spent a lot of time with the Abraxan, working with its wounded wing.
And then they laughed and wrestled off the rest of their clothes and fell off the sofa, but the floor was near and the carpet was thick, so it was all right.   Draco was over him, eyes dark with desire and hair falling round his face; he thrust against Harry’s leg, stroking his cock, pulling him into a messy kiss.  “Want you, Harry, I want to see you come, suck you, fuck you, ride you, anything…”
Harry returned on the appointed date with Gabriel, his broom, some clean clothes, and a few other things.  “I brought some Muggle money, in case we need to do business with them along the way.”
A group of monkeys sat on the bridge.  Harry walked out to meet them.  A large macaque blocked his way.
“Cats aren’t stupid, especially if they’re part Kneazle.  Remember Crookshanks....” Hermione looked as if she would have said more, but then she glanced over her shoulder.  Ron must be there, Harry realized, so Hermione was being tactful.  Harry remembered all too well the treachery of Ron’s rat Scabbers, which Crookshanks had suspected all along.  It was a sore subject for Ron.
The afternoon sun streamed through the dusty windows, warm on their skins.  Draco gazed at Harry, dark-eyed and tousled and erect.  “Let me,” he said, sinking to his knees and taking Harry in his mouth.  Harry gave a small gasp, his face flushed, and his hands cradled Draco’s head.  And then Draco gave himself up to the pleasure of sucking and stroking until he could bear it no longer and rose up, his voice husky.  “Ride me, lover. Ride.”
Harry waited for her to go on, but she was actually waiting for him to reply. This was not a woman to answer with platitudes.
Padma picked up the take-out bags and peered inside. “It should taste fine. Eat dinner with us, Harry? There’s plenty of food. Parvati always packs enough for leftovers because she knows we can’t cook.”
Potter spoke up, because the damn room had kept the door to Potter’s side open, and he apparently had nothing better to do than eavesdrop.  “I could help.”
Harry lay on him, panting, then raised himself again. “You,” Harry whispered, rubbing his come in slow circles over Draco’s taut nipples and bending to lick himself off Draco’s skin. “You. You.  You,” he murmured, between kisses on Draco’s neck and jaw and face.
All those years I never learned to ignore you.  I’m going to try it now.  Let’s pretend if I don’t see you, you can’t be seen.  If I don’t meet your eyes, their green fire won’t burn me. If I don’t look, maybe you’ll get away.  I mean go away.
“A truth universally acknowledged,” said the man standing in the doorway, broom in hand. It was Draco Malfoy, though whether he looked cool or challenging or amused, Harry couldn’t quite tell.
Almost as soon as Harry touched it, the spots were gone, and Draco’s shirt was white as the driven snow.  Harry didn’t know how that happened, but he liked it.
Harry remembered his reunion with his own wand. The feeling of warmth, of relief, of rightness restored.  “Sorry for the delay,” he said.
Draco walked to the edge of the pond. He carefully levitated Herman out of the cauldron of water and lowered him into the lake. Herman jetted excitedly back and forth a few times, but then began waving his arms and tentacles frantically. As Draco watched in horror, the little squid began to swell like a balloon inflating. His eyes implored Draco.
Finally they set off uphill toward Harry’s house, with Draco trying to balance the market basket on his head, to the amusement of several teenage girls who did the same with no effort at all.  “How do you do that?”  Harry asked.  “Nothing ever stays up for me.”  Draco smirked and Harry swatted him.  “No rude comments, you know what I mean.”
Draco hurried upstairs.  The stunned snake in the tub was a striking combination of long black and blue stripes with a regular pattern of red splotches along the side.  “I think that’s a California Red-Sided Garter Snake, though the blue stripe is a bit unusual.  Gorgeous.  They’re harmless, unless you’re a frog or something like that.”
Harry smiled but shook his head.  “Hedwig was the best gift anyone ever gave me, Hagrid.  I know I could never replace her, though.”
Potter, stubborn as always, stayed put.  A tiny owl woke up, hooted with excitement, and flew over to him. “Hello, Pigwidgeon,” Potter said softly.
“Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chooo-choooo!”  Teddy made exuberant sound effects as the little red engine sped around the track, puffing out tiny bursts of steam. “Did you ride on the Hogwarts Express, Uncle Harry?”
Now they went to the bathroom down the hall from Draco’s room.  No splendid swimming pool of a tub, but room for them to lie together, cradled by warm water.  Then they went back to Draco’s bed and kissed, and Draco began to make love to Harry in every way his hands and mouth and mind could find.
Draco wasn’t sure whether he hoped anyone would come or not. What if people came and criticized their animal haven? What if people mocked this odd little family they had become? What if the Ministry decided to shut them down for some reason? But Merfley clearly had his heart set on the party, so Draco pretended enthusiasm.
“Less talk,” Potter said, “more action.”  He leaned closer, paused, and then pressed a quick kiss to Draco’s lips.
“Yeah,” he said raggedly. “But we’re both here now. So how about that snowball fight?” And he scooped up a handful of snow and rubbed it on Potter’s head, just so he could touch that hair, even with mittens on.
“Don’t be absurd, Malfoy. you know what I meant.  No one’s held that post for ages.  You’re being made red-“
Well, that was awkward.  Yet another person he’d spent his school years harassing, who had turned out to be a war hero.  Draco was so tired of apologizing.  He nodded and said good morning.
Harry watched him leave, feeling uneasy.  Was he supposed to apologize for something, and if so, what?  But Draco didn’t mention it when he returned home.  He didn’t shout, like Ginny had when she was angry.  And he didn’t weep like Cho Chang, thank goodness.  Maybe they were all right.  Harry let it go.
Harry’s smile vanished into a bitter twist of the lips.  “Nothing.  She wasn’t fond of spiders in cupboards.”
“It will be all right if I can supervise him,” Draco said.  “Greg doesn’t lie.  If he says Luna told him to do this, then she did.”
Draco nearly tripped as he tried to step out of them, and landed sprawled on the bed.  He leaned over to put Harry’s glasses safely on the nightstand. “Wanton, that’s what you are.  Ever hear of finesse, Potter?”
They decided to leave the ice snake in the freezer and the garter snake in the attic, and head for New Guinea with the impatient python.  New Guinea being difficult to get around except by air, they brought their brooms along.
Herman!” The little squid looked about to pop as he sailed through the air. Draco hastily deposited him back in the cauldron where Herman gradually returned to his normal size.
Draco strode into the forest, trying not to wonder what Longbottom and Potter might be doing together.
“So, hermit,” he said, sidling closer.  He pulled Harry in and murmured in his ear.  “Fancy a ride to Banbury Cross?”
impressive.  I didn’t know you were even old enough to ride it.  Have I missed something?  Have you turned 11 already?”
“Charlie Weasley says that wyverns are essential to the magico-ecological balance. I found the boundaries of the wyvern reserve; we can reinforce the wards before we begin. And don’t you want a little wildness in your life?”
Harry shook his head, chuckling.  He reached out to cup his lover’s balls and fondle them gently, then bent to the task of giving head.  It was a new skill for him, but a sensuous pleasure, and Draco’s soft cries rewarded him.
Harry thought.  “He’s not dirty,” Harry said.  “And he stays outside when he’s a bear.  He’s not a bear when he’s in bed.”
“Remus!  Remus!  Put me down near him.”  Draco did his best to fire Stunning spells at Lupin’s opponent before setting Tonks down. Rosemonde swept him up into the air again.
The Puffskein shrank a little as if embarrassed. Draco sighed and turned back to Merfley. “What do you suggest?”
“This is the north, and the lakeshore.  Maybe the people you’re meeting aren’t Chichewa speakers.  Maybe they speak Chitumbuka, or Chitonga or something.”
Draco cast Lumos, dragged himself into his wheelchair, and opened the door to Potter’s room.  “Potter!”
So, having spent too much time alone, bored, and tired of foraging for meals, Draco just said, “Could we start with cooking lessons instead?”
“Kreacher likes Harry Potter and the young master of the house of Black.  Kreacher is helping them.”
“Thank you, Aunt Andromeda.  I’ll try to do that,” Draco said.  “I’d better be going.  I think I’ll walk a bit and then Apparate.  I’d like a bit of air.”
Andromeda left as soon as he arrived, but she had a meal all prepared for Teddy and him, so that was easy enough.  After they ate, Teddy wanted to fly around the garden on his toy broom, so Draco watched him and gave some pointers until the light waned.  “Time for bed soon.  Let’s pick out a bedtime story.”
Harry imagined trying to capture Malfoy’s quizzical smile, his daughter’s vivid face, the sparkling water.  Why not?
“Some of them are quite recent, but the great White Horse at Uffington is more than 2000 years old, they think, and it’s huge.  I always wanted to see it, but….” His father had said it was too far, and then the war was looming, and Draco forgot.  But now…
“Never mind him.  You’ll be finished with that internship soon, right?  Meanwhile, you’ll get to escape him for a bit of holiday.  So where in China would you like us to go?”
A snorkeler was coming back in to shore, with slow kicks of lean pale legs.   Likely to burn badly in the African sun with that complexion, Harry thought idly.  Haven’t seen anyone that pale since…. The man, young, was standing now, splashing up the last few steps onto the beach.  He pulled the mask off an angular face, shaking lake water from the lightest of blond hair, more glistening drops running slantwise on a chest faintly slashed by a long jagged scar.  Harry’s jaw dropped as his worlds collided.
“What if it rains?  It’ll go through the lathes – if he doesn’t tear those off too.  You could have the ceiling come down around your ears.”
“Look, something else fell out of the wrappings.” Draco bent and picked a sprig of leaves and berries off the snow.  It was mistletoe. He held it over Harry’s head. “My chance to kiss my boyfriend on another continent.”
And there they were – sitting on a park bench together.  But where did that dog come from?  She swooped down to investigate.
Harry tried to make a joke, to cover his sense of strangeness.  “A Slytherin-green boat?  I should have known.”
Malfoy took out his wand – was that really necessary? – and stalked to the door of his cottage.  As he opened it, he bent down and the cat leapt off his shoulders and ran outside.  Harry followed with Gabriel’s cage.
“Oh, you want to ride me, do you?” the bear asked in a low voice, giving Harry a sly side-long look.  Its mood seemed to have suddenly improved.
Harry still pressed back and held tight for a few moments.  This was the best he could get, it seemed.  “All right,” he said finally, eyes shut.  He straightened up and found his balance, felt Malfoy’s hands cupping his shoulders again and running lightly down his arms.  Then they were gone.  When he opened his eyes again, he was alone in the bedroom.
Andromeda, who had been speaking to Malfoy in a low voice, turned and said, “Let’s do a quick tidying-up before we take a guest in there, all right?” Teddy began pouting until she added, “You can help me choose the spells.” Then he scampered off with her, leaving Harry alone in the room with Malfoy, who was still making notes in his little book.
Harry’s grin was cut short when Luna began asking about the Mooncalf. Guiltily he realized that, distracted by Malfoy, he’d almost forgot the poor creature.
“Let’s go up.”  Harry flew higher, and Malfoy let go of Harry’s broom and flew loop the loops around him.  Harry looked down over the meadows and woods and hills.  He could see a river glinting.  The air felt so good on his face.
Then he saw a photo of Ginny in the sports pages. She was with some blonde girl – a Dutch Quidditch coach – and they were turning toward each other, laughing, wind ruffling their short-cropped hair.  When did Ginny cut her hair, he wondered, as he waited for the familiar dull ache of confusion and resentment and loss. It didn’t come.
So Harry finished his meal with an utterly delicious combination of sweetened yogurt, cardamom, saffron, pistachios and rosewater, and tried not to keep thinking about Draco Malfoy.
With difficulty, Draco asked, “How is your sister?  She was friends with Lavender Brown, wasn’t she?  I’m very sorry about … all that.”
Draco was trying to hold onto Harry, brace himself in a boatful of slippery fish, and thwack at the Kraken with an oar. “Let
Not only Draco’s legs and feet were numb.  His hand could feel his cock, but his cock couldn’t feel his hand.
“It’s all true!”  Draco answered in surprise.  “Truer than saying we ‘just’ knew each other in school.”
“She has already left. Rainbow travel is scenic, but…” Kastania smiled.  “Chancy and slow.  She left greetings for you.  She did love the jewelry.”
The elf looked anxious. “Merfley is sorry it took so long! But I can be helping now. Where is the room for recovery?”
Draco shook his head and made room on the bench, wondering.  “I didn’t think you lived around here,” he said finally.
Ron looked sympathetic.  “Well, it wouldn’t be my idea of a good time, but… you might as well check it out.”
Granger said the castle needed to improve its accessibility for the disabled, which he couldn’t disagree with, though he did tell her not to make any badges on his behalf. She produced a
“You were no worse than he was,” Draco said. At least Potter had listened to him.  “Didn’t know you aspired to be a massage therapist, Potter.”
Draco looked down at his daughter, who was tugging at him, then over at Harry.  He nodded slowly.  “Why was it you came here, Potter?”
Well, hell – he might as well get it done while Baines was here.  He could always say no the next time.
As for the dog, he didn’t see or hear very well, but he didn’t seem to be in pain, and would push up against Draco’s legs or hands, looking for affection. “All right, Old Timer,” Draco said, scratching him behind the ears as the dog wagged his tail.
As Harry and Draco watched, the young Mooncalf was welcomed into their midst, and the dance began, the silvery beasts stepping lithely in the moonlight. It was Draco’s first time to see the dance as it was meant to be, and he was awed.
“Naps are good.  Right now, actually, I was just going to ask if you wanted to listen to something.”
Draco couldn’t help but be a little apprehensive—he didn’t look forward to dealing with any giant snakes or Hippogriffs. But surely the veterinarian would be trained in handling whatever turned up. And the treatment of their first patient seemed to have been a success. The Puffskein was busily scavenging up a meal of crumbs and dead spiders with its long pink tongue, and rooms were noticeably cleaner already.
The horse whinnied as Merfley came up. “Allow me to introduce myself,” Draco said. “My name is Draco Malfoy, and this is Merfley. We are the staff here as we await the arrival of the veterinarian.”
One Saturday Harry was sitting in his living room catching up with Hermione when the fireplace flared green.  Malfoy’s head appeared.
“Gabriel?”  Harry vaguely remembered a Christmas story of an angel.  A barn owl lifted its heart-shaped white face and fixed alert dark eyes on him.
“Albus,” Snape said with pain in his voice, and clasped Dumbledore’s hands in his.  Then he placed the tip of his wand at Dumbledore’s chest, and with a look of bitter grief whispered,
Malfoy’s mouth fell open again. Then he huffed and shook his head with a wry twist of his lips. “Go ahead, Potter, show me how it’s done.”
“Maybe your wand knew – maybe it knew you wanted Voldemort gone too,” Harry said slowly.  “Maybe that’s why it came to me so easily.  It knew that was my job.”
“You should continue to regain strength, especially if you exercise your upper body, and you may be able to live a long healthy life, if you take certain precautions.  However, a nerve at the base of your spinal cord has been permanently severed.  As a result, you have lost feeling and control of your legs and parts of your lower body.”
“Not like this,” Harry admitted.  “I told Kreacher that Narcissa Black’s son was coming for dinner and he outdid himself.”
“I have Muggle money, Potter,” Malfoy said.  “I didn’t buy my computer in Flourish and Blotts, you know.”
“No,” Draco said, intrigued. “I’d love to see that.  We can’t possibly bring a cat and an owl to a rare small bird sanctuary, though.”
She rather lost track of the days before she finally came close to Potter again, in the mountains of Romania.  It was rugged, beautiful country, but there were too many dragons for her taste.  At last she found Potter, flying with another red-haired man – did he collect them?
“I seriously doubt that,” Pansy said. “But you’re on.” She turned to Draco. “Set something up for me, there’s a dear.”
say odd things?” Potter laughed, a genuine crinkly-eyed laugh, and then Draco noticed the lines on his face, and the glint of silver in his hair.
“So now what do we do with them?”  Harry frowned.  “It doesn’t seem right to just Vanish them, especially if this one’s endangered.  And they don’t like zoos, people are always harassing them, tapping on the glass.”
Where, though?  Death Eaters at the Manor – maybe Greyback, maybe even the Dark Lord?  And how was Draco to complete his task now?  He and his family were doomed.
His own constellation, Draco, snaked around near the North Star - not bright, but there to be seen in any season.  The bright star was Sirius, his mother’s cousin, shining out of Canis Major. Sirius, the hot shot with the flying motorcycle – he’d heard stories from Harry, who seemed to have adored him.  No stories from his own family, just a burn mark on the tapestry of the Black family tree.
“We do what we can,” said Æthelflæd. She bent to lay a hand on Old Timer’s flank, and then quietly walked away.
After breakfast he wandered around the castle for a while, looking at rooms of splendid things, and then went outside where he finally found the white bear again.
But Potter beat him to it, hissed out some curse Draco had never heard before.  And then Draco was falling, pain slicing all through him like knives, he was lying in water and blood was pouring out of him, he was cold, so cold, he clawed at his chest to try to hold his blood in.  Someone was saying “No,” someone was wailing “Murder!” and his eyes went dim.
Draco dragged his eyes up to Harry’s and was held there, a moment out of time. “Giddy. Like I’m floating.”
Lavender leaned into her. “But, but…will anyone ever kiss me again?” Tears ran down her face, crookedly because of the scars. She’d been pretty, once, before the battle, before the werewolf. Now people sometimes flinched when they looked at her.
Too tired for more talk, they returned to their rooms, slid together into Draco’s bed, and fell asleep in each other’s arms.
Oh.  Draco hadn’t known they weren’t together any longer, although that could explain why he hadn’t seen her here visiting Potter.  But she wasn’t who Draco meant.
“I will, soon, just not today.  I don’t want you to miss your match.  Thanks for thinking of me, though, Ron.”
Draco rolled over with a lazy sunny smile that startled an open smile out of Potter in return.  As Potter stroked his feet, shins and thighs, Draco found himself looking fondly at the mess of black hair on his head.  But then Potter moved to his torso, where Draco could feel again, oh how he could feel – around his navel, across his nipples, Merlin did Potter have no idea what he was doing to him?  Potter noticed something – maybe Draco’s quickened breathing – because he asked again, “All right there?”
Next morning Gabriel flew out the open window without any message, and was gone for several hours.  When he returned, Harry was startled to see a parchment in his beak.  He unrolled it and read:
He untucked the net enough to reach out for his glasses.  When he could see clearly again, he groaned.  The net had several tears and small holes, and one big gaping one.  It was worse than useless.  Back in England he could have used a
Malfoy’s flat was above a flower shop.  He answered the door with the sleeves of his robes pushed up to his elbows, a tea towel in hand, and an inquisitive look.  Pretending to be washing up, part of some elaborate ruse to make him seem harmless and domestic, no doubt.
Shortly afterwards Malfoy stepped out of the green flames with Gabriel in his cage, covered in a green cloth.
Draco took Harry’s hands and held them up to cup his own face, nestling his cheeks against them.  “Maybe you should learn to find your way by touch.” He was drawing Harry’s hands over his chest and down his sides.
“We can hide you and your mother.  Your father is safe in Azkaban. You do not need to kill anyone, Draco.”
Harry wanted to change the subject.  He focused again on the dazzling night sky, looking for patterns. “I’d like to be able to find Andromeda, too.  I haven’t seen her for a long time.”
moved forward, the channel cleared and water appeared; behind them, it reverted to a weedy ditch. “How does that work?”
Draco grinned.  “Not bad, Potter,” he said, getting up and tossing a handful of shredded leaves into Harry’s dark tempestuous locks.
“He doesn’t sound so great to me,” Padma said, entering with a tray. “Have some tea and unburnt cakes, Harry.”
“Oh, as if I want to touch you,” Potter grumbled, climbing into the far side of the large bed.  There was no night table on his side.  He took off his glasses and handed them to Draco.  “Put those somewhere safe.”
The ceremony itself brought tears to Harry’s eyes.  These students had persevered through years of long dusty or muddy walks to school, or sleeping on reed mats on cement floors if they were lucky enough to be boarders.  Years of scraping together the fees for tuition and supplies and uniforms from their meager family resources, standing in line once a week for the privilege of briefly borrowing one of the few textbooks from the library, carrying their blue plastic chairs on their heads from one classroom to another as their overstretched teachers shifted the schedules and combined classes.  Many teenagers had lost one or both parents, often to AIDS although no one would say so directly.  Many of them would not pass the national exams they had just taken – exams that were designed for them not to pass.  Jobs were few, though there were shortages of so many kinds of skilled workers, and subsistence farming was a chancy business.  And yet the students came down the aisles singing and dancing, in the joy of music and movement, fellowship and accomplishment, hope and youth.
Next morning the North Wind puffed himself up to a great size and carried Harry high up into the sky.  They rushed along so fast that when Harry glanced down he could see stormy waves crashing in the ocean.  He was a bit worried that they’d cause a shipwreck.
“You always did what he asked, didn’t you.  Even if it nearly killed you,” Malfoy said in a low voice.
Harry laid a light hand on Draco’s shoulder.  “We haven’t had a massage for a long time,” Harry said quietly.  “Must be past due for one.  Or do you want to take a bath?”
“I’d been with Andromeda and Teddy before.”  It had been an adventure, the first time, and Draco had been nervous, but he wasn’t about to tell that to Potter.  Harry.  Whoever.  Andromeda was comfortable in the Muggle world, because her Muggle-born husband Ted had been close to his family.  She’d been willing to help Draco get his feet wet there.
However, experience with Ginny had taught him that questions about attending family gatherings were rarely simple. He studied what he could see of Draco’s averted face.
“I do not speak her human language, but I can ask her in Houyhnhynm, the common language among creatures of the horse.”
Draco tugged lightly at the waistband of Potter’s shorts and Potter lifted his hips just slightly, so Draco could ease them down.  Potter pushed at them suddenly, and kicked them off, and lay there naked and panting.  Draco stared at his cock.
Harry hadn’t realised there was someone else there. Now he noticed the man standing in the doorway of the shed, quietly regarding him. It was, who else, Draco Malfoy. In blue jeans and a T-shirt, slightly grease-smudged, with his hair falling into his eyes, looking unfairly un-Malfoyish and attractive.
“Well, you don’t need our approval,” said Andromeda.  “I just hope that witch or wizard knows how lucky they are.”
Draco began humming Celestina Warbeck’s recent hit, “It Was That Spell You Cast on Me” and Harry swatted him.  “Actually, I pretended that I lost a game of Truth or Dare.”
And now here they were, on a little boat in the middle of China, sailing up to a statue of Buddha so enormous….
Maybe they should try what?  Being friends?  How did one try to be friends with Potter?  And what on earth did he mean by a play date?
“Ow!” Someone swore in the darkness, and then the bed dipped.  “Budge over,” said a familiar voice.  “Do you expect me to sleep on the floor?”
“You’ll learn,” she tells him, but he cannot hear.  “Sha sha sha, there now,” she whispers to the baby, who stills for a moment and blinks at her with eyes like Harry’s.  Like her own.
The chocolate frog began jumping from his lap to Draco’s and back again.  “Why is the frog doing that?”
Malfoy shrugged as if trying to look nonchalant, but he was still glowing. “Well. Not every wand gets to finish off a Dark Lord.  And I couldn’t have done that with it.”
Harry might have collapsed on the floor, but Draco wouldn’t let him.  “Bed - much more comfortable - I’ll take you, not far.”  Harry was too hoarse to protest.
Draco took a long, uneven breath, then approached Harry slowly as one would a wounded animal, speaking in a low voice.  “I’m sorry.  I didn’t know, I was stupid.”
“So, er, perhaps if I knew where in the forest the centaurs stayed, I could avoid stirring up the other denizens. Do you have any suggestions for finding them?”
A young Taoist monk passed them on the way up the mountain, black robes swinging with his jaunty strides.  His long dark hair was twisted up into an elegant top-knot above his narrow, vivid, serenely confident face. Vitality seemed to radiate from him.
“My mother was quite insistent on good posture.  I don’t have the neck muscles to do this for long, though. Oh look, a chip stand – carry the basket and I’ll feed you chips.”
“Those are bee feet, Potter.  Someone must cure you of your obsession with feathery millipede legs.”
After a moment Malfoy remarked,  “With all the unsaying we’re accomplishing today, the Unspeakables should recruit us.”
An hour later, the Puffskein was clean, dry, fluffy and sweet-smelling. Merfley had trimmed off the scorched bits and sculpted the shorter fur into a floral design. The Puffskein hummed in contentment, Merfley beamed, and Draco decided that washing his own rather neglected hair would be a good idea.
After they’d both eaten berries for a while, the bear was in a better mood.  “If you’re still hungry, I could try getting us some honey.  The bees are likely to chase after me, though.”
His eye fell on the photo on his mantel, of himself with Ginny, a few months after the end of the war.  They were smiling for the camera – but that was just it.  Smiling for the camera, but not really at each other – they never quite met each other’s eyes.  Why hadn’t he noticed that before?
“Yeah, I’ve been pretty happy lately.  I do miss you two, though.  I have a favour to ask.  I’d like you to come to dinner -”
Draco gave him an inquiring look but didn’t press him. After a while he said, “It was a sleigh where I went.”
“Oh, you never seemed to care what I said about you.” Malfoy half-smiled.  “But are there no words you want to take back, perfect Potter?”
. Draco squelched an inexplicable impulse to ruffle Potter’s ever-messy hair. He couldn’t help the little smile that pulled at his lips. “Someone has clearly been spiking the Gryffindors’ punch with something stronger than I got,” he said. “No fair.”
He half expected a comment about werewolves polluting the family blood, but Draco sounded, if anything, eager. “I have a little cousin, then?  What’s he like?”
“I don’t understand the rush.” Potter frowned, staring out the window.  “They ought to give us time to figure things out. Relax and explore, now that there’s no war on.”
He switched into languorous and sensual music. Stirred, Harry lay watching him. “That must be for mating,” he said when Draco finished. Draco smiled and raised an eyebrow.
“I’d be happy never to have to eat another mushroom again,” Harry said.  “I had enough of them in the Forest of Dean to last me a lifetime.”
“I’ll do it,” Draco said, rough voiced.  “You strip.  I need to feel your skin on mine.”  He coated his fingers with oil and breached himself until he was moving against his own fingers, gazing at Harry with eyes heavy with desire.
“I never thought of there being female centaurs in the forest,” Harry said.  “Though it stands to reason I guess.”
He didn’t know how long he had been just smiling foolishly into those Fern-green eyes when he recollected himself.  Draco still didn’t know what the plan was – nothing formal, he guessed, given Potter’s clean but slightly shabby clothes – but as host he could always fall back on standard courtesies.  “Would you like some tea?”
“Well, you’re like a bird always trailing bits of poems in your beak, to line a nest with,” Hermione retorted. They beamed at each other.
“Liaison,” Draco said. “And no jokes about ‘dangerous liaisons’ or being hung like a horse, please, I’ve already heard them.”
Finally he was within reach – he stretched out a hand to touch its tail, and found he was grasping a human foot.  The fish had turned into a young man, who spun about and turned towards him.  Alarmed, he swam backwards, with the man in pursuit.  The stranger reached out a hand to stroke his leg, then propelled himself backwards, beckoning.  Hair swirled around his face, so Harry couldn’t see his eyes, but his smile looked teasing and playful.
The brightest star in the sky.  Harry looked in the direction Draco had indicated and indeed, there was one star that shone whiter and brighter than the rest.
by Zimbabwean author Shimmer Chinodya.   It described a school in a refugee encampment in the bush, run by guerilla fighters during their war for independence.  Maybe that would make a good lesson.
“Well then,” Harry said huskily. He leaned over Draco, brushing a lock of hair from his forehead and cupping his cheek, then moved in to kiss him, slowly at first. He pulled back. “Is that enough?”
“Yes! It was the special. Didn’t even have to wait for Taro Tuesday,” Hermione said. “Oh, I hope I didn’t spoil it by dropping the bags. I was so excited to see Harry.”
“Strange things happen to people who are targets of powerful dark wizards, but he’s gone.  So why would they happen to you now?”
Harry didn’t know what to say.  Draco seemed a little paler than usual.  “They don’t burn them now, though,” Harry said.  “I told you people were hostile to magic here, but we’re not using magic.”
Oh.  Draco had never heard his name spoken with such awe, such need.  Heavy-lidded green eyes, gazing with such naked want, brought an answering ache of desire in him.
“Are you making mittens for Hagrid’s brother Grawp, Mum? Because no one but a giant needs a mitten that’s a foot long.”
“More than that, it makes me think… nowadays we take magic for granted, take animals for granted, we’ve forgot how to feel awe.”
For the next week his aunt, uncle and cousin seemed determined to make Harry’s life even more miserable than before.  He would have run away, but his uncle kept him locked in.
Draco took them.  Without the scratched, smudged lenses, Potter’s eyes were bigger and a vivid green; the line of his eyebrows was strong without the frames in the way. “What do you know – you look better with your glasses off, Potter.  Not that that’s saying much.”
“Yeah!” Harry let out a sigh of relief. Talking about this was hard, but flying was, well, easy as flying.
“Well, goodhearted magical freaks are always welcome here. Let’s make a toast,” Andromeda said, “to the black sheep of the family!”
“No, I’d better get back,” Malfoy said.  He raised a hand of greeting to Hermione, glanced about to find the dish of Floo powder, tossed some into the fireplace and stepped in.  Harry waved goodbye as Malfoy disappeared in a whoosh.
“The war taught us that, I think,” Potter said slowly. “How to go away, to somewhere bearable, at least for a moment.”
“Saving the world?”  Malfoy didn’t sound as snide as he had in the old days, but somehow Harry blushed a little.
Potter kissed back until Draco was in danger of going all sweet and soft, like a Chocolate Frog left in the sun.
Draco looked where Potter was pointing. Sure enough, there was a mountain and a small cloud of smoke.  A faint roaring sound was becoming louder, and beneath the smoke he saw a speck that grew rapidly larger as it approached.
“You never said you wanted him awake.  His aunt gives him a sleepy potion so he’ll stop fussing about the marriage.”
.  I didn't invent the star names, though no one seems to know how Eta Draconis came to be called Booboo!
When Malfoy opened the door and saw Harry, something flickered briefly in his eyes, but his face was impassive.  He stood aside and waved Harry inside, but Harry stood in the doorway and spoke stumblingly.  “I, er, don’t believe I thanked you for returning my glasses.”
“It nubbumps, would be the best description,” Luna said thoughtfully. “Is tomorrow morning all right for bringing the attractor?”
Padma and Hermione went outside to admire the Palladian Bridge while Draco examined the gilded wyverns on the crown moulding in the Double Cube Room. Harry tarried in a small room full of paintings. He thought he caught a flicker of movement out of the corner of his eye, and turned to look back at a landscape, where a small snake was curled up on a rock. Had it been there before?
“Better get to bed then.”  Draco loosened his arms, but took one of Harry’s hands and led him inside.  They stopped inside the door, hesitating.
Harry handed them over, slid out of his flip-flops and climbed into Draco’s bed, still wearing his boxers and T-shirt. He lay stretched out on his back, legs straight and arms at his sides, on the far side of the bed.  Draco set Harry’s glasses on the little table, sat on the bed to take off his sandals, then pulled his legs up onto the bed.  He frowned over toward Harry’s side of the bed.  “Net’s come untucked there.”  Draco leaned across him to tuck in the mosquito net, sending a jolt of desire through Harry.  Still hovering above him, Draco again asked in a low voice, “Are you alright?”
“– all you do is talk about cocks.  If this is about that piece in the Daily Prophet, let me tell you, Malfoy, I really don’t care what they say about me.  My private life is none of anyone else’s business.”  Potter looked flushed.
“I wasn’t planning on calling in a Life Debt on it,” Harry answered, surprised that Malfoy had brought it up.  “But a nap would be nice.  Thanks.”
Still a bit dazed, Draco followed him to a place private enough for Apparition.  “Side-along me?  I’m kind of distracted,” he said.  Harry tucked him tenderly against his side and soon they were walking through the Hogwarts gates.
Potter had appeared, all foolhardy with no head protection, his wand aimed.  Draco interrupted Potter’s stunning spell and hauled him under the umbrella.  “Don’t jinx him – Greg is….”  Well, harmless was not the word.  “Well-intentioned.  Toward me, at any rate.”
“A lot of choices?” Padma rolled her eyes. “You must be joking. All those years, and never even the simplest curry. Terrible place to be a vegetarian.” She turned and looked around. “Cho! What did you think of the food at Hogwarts?”
It was a near thing, though – what if Draco had had to find a rhyme for purple?  Even if he’d managed to, Potter could counter with “Nasturtiums are orange” or “Mushrooms are beige,” and that way madness lay.  It was time to branch out.
He looked around. Choppy waves, land some distance away, and was that an iceberg? And then below the water he saw an enormous pair of eyes, the size of dinner plates, gazing at him from a conical head. A cluster of long arms trailed in the water, covered with serrated suckers like toothy little teacups.
“It seems that in Chinese Astronomy, Centaurus is in the quadrants of the Azure Dragon of the East and the Vermilion Bird of the South, whereas Sagittarius stretches from the Azure Dragon of the East to the Black Tortoise of the North.  But I don’t really understand what that signifies.”
?  Fascinating stuff, but much harder to read in the original, unless you speak a northern dialect yourself, perhaps.  It’s alliterative, which makes it easier to look things up in the glossary, but still…  Chaucer would be much easier to start with.  And he’s so likeable.  Funny and humane.”
“I was just going to read somewhere outside, so it won’t trouble me.  Anyway, Potter, you pulled me out of an inferno once, I imagine I can let you use the spare bed.”
“When I was eleven?  And what, I scarred you for life?”   Harry scoffed, before remembering that glimpse of a thin line slanting across Malfoy’s chest.  Apparently, in fact, he had.
“That fraud was no professor.”  McGonagall’s eyes snapped.  “It was outrageous behavior to a student, though not the last such seen at this school.
“I’d have uncursed you if I could,” Harry said quietly.  “I never meant to do that.  And you’re right, I didn’t much care what you said about me, except to Rita Skeeter.  When I was a prisoner in your house – what you didn’t say saved my life.”
Still, sometimes, as a sort of warm-up exercise, he’d dash off a few light-hearted lines about Potter and send them.
She and James had each other, and their laughing child, to live for.  To die for, if necessary.  As it had been.
‘They look the opposite of European centaurs – they have horse’s heads and men’s bodies. They’re healers, quite friendly and helpful to people in distress.”
“I always wanted to know how they made the sparks come out of their brooms.  Let me just check with our garter snake friend and see if it’s in a hurry to get home.”
Harry was looking at Malfoy’s mouth in the mirror, pink lips moving, so close to his hair. If Malfoy turned slightly, his lips would touch Harry’s forehead.  The arm across Harry’s stomach held him tight.  He pressed back harder against Malfoy’s chest and gripped the arm that was the only thing keeping him from falling.
They saw a moose swimming, and some sea otters floating on their backs, and seals.  The garter snake had wrapped itself securely around Harry’s upper arm under his clothes, but occasionally poked its head out of his collar to take a look.
Neither of them spoke for a few moments.  Harry didn’t know what to say.  He couldn’t wish Lucius Malfoy returned to his former self, that cold arrogant deadly man.  But it was shocking to see someone who had been such a formidable wizard reduced to a shell.
Draco laughed a little.  “Give me a few minutes and I can help you with that.  But you get my mouth this time.  I haven’t forgotten I have a badge to research.  And snakes,” he darted a quick lick to Harry’s neck, “smell with their tongues.”
Draco spun around, wand out and cursing, because there was the last person he wanted to find him like this, Harry Potter.  Then they were both firing hexes and jinxes, dodging, smashing lamps and bins and cisterns until the floor was flooded, but never managing to hit each other.  Desperate, Draco seized on the most extreme curse he dared.
Andromeda’s face softened. “You aren’t just some magical weapon against evil, Harry. You’re a person who people love.”
Just then the Floo roared to life and Hermione appeared. Harry held out his arms, grinning. She gave a little shriek, dropped a couple of packages and dove at him. Harry laughed as he hugged her and then caught his breath at the sweetness of feeling so loved. She squeezed him hard in silence and then words came tumbling out, a mixture of welcome and reproach. “I haven’t heard from you in forever, Harry!”
It occurred to Harry that he had no idea how Malfoy had got hold of his glasses in the first place.  As an Auror, he should check up on that sort of thing.  So it was only logical that he turned his footsteps toward Malfoy’s flat.
“Much of Britain’s forest land was lost long ago.  There are few places for a centaur herd.  We do not trust that what remains is safe.”
“Sure,” Draco answered, wondering.  Then, seeing Harry go toward the oblong black case in the corner of the room, he exclaimed “Oh!  Are you going to play for me?”
“Oh! We’re very pleased to have you here, Dr…. I didn’t catch your family name?” Draco had been raised to rate people based on family connections, and old habits died hard.
“It says the world’s biggest gathering of garter snakes is in Manitoba and if we hurry we might be able to catch them coming out of their winter dens where they all sleep together to stay warm.  In spring they have mating balls.”
Rosemonde flew with all her heart, beating the air with her mighty wings.  Draco had no idea how long they flew before they crossed the Channel.  The coin was pulling them toward Scotland.  He was not surprised when the familiar towers of Hogwarts finally came into view.
“You mean until the curse is better understood and its effects can be reversed?” Draco’s mother asked.
“So, tell me about this Aunt Lulu.  Is she a good aunt?” Potter asked when they were settled in Teddy’s bedroom.
Harry was spared having to comment by the arrival of a barn owl at the open window – the one that had brought Malfoy’s original message to his house. It surveyed him with disfavour.
The dog was indeed round, slow-moving and near-sighted.  But he was affable, leaning warmly against Draco’s leg and thumping his tail.  “You can stay with me,” Draco said.  “Do you have a name?  Can’t tell me?  I think your name is Wombat.”
“Now is coming grand finale of our party!” announced Merfley. “Please come to the pond. We is presenting water ballet and underwater light show!”
“Cho Chang?  Wow, you have a long memory.  I’d hardly say she was my girlfriend, we only had a couple of dates.”
“Have you been snorkeling yet?  They’re a type of tropical fish, and there are an incredible variety of them here - this lake is famous for them.”
Harry agreed and said goodbye to the West Wind.  Harry was tired by now, and the South Wind’s warmth was a comfort to him as they flew.  By and by it grew colder, though, and the South Wind began to tire, because another wind was blowing toward them.
Draco left his books in a corner and went for a fast walk, then came back and wrote feverishly.  When Harry brought him more treacle tart to refuel, he talked excitedly about a break-through on his thesis.  He’d gotten ink on his nose again.
“And there are children.  The little one said I had funny legs and smelled good.  She ran away too.”
“That was you – I heard you in there,” Draco said urgently.  “I’ve never heard anything like it.  It was a portrait in sound.”
Eventually there had been talk of compromise, sentencing him to somehow do community service while confined to the Manor. With little option but to accept, Draco had returned to the Manor—it had, for several years, been difficult to think of it as “home”—and awaited his fate.
“I’m named for a constellation, Potter.  Half of my mother’s family are named for heavenly bodies.  The night sky is like a Black family genealogy.”
finds her way back, but you know she’ll turn up again in the morning. Good thing I renewed the fish preservation charms.” He hung his wet clothes on a chair and slipped into the other side of the bed.
So Harry told him the story, and then they kissed some more, and then they made a plan, because the wedding was to be the next day.  And then they kissed again, and that led to other things, and there was great joy and love between them all that night.
Of course, Harry hadn’t liked Malfoy himself.  Did he like him now?  Or did he just fancy the thought of him all rumpled and pink-cheeked, in Harry’s arms, or his bed?
“I don’t know,” Harry answered.  He’d thought he might find some answers to life overseas, but it seemed he was as uncertain as ever.  “Keep bees?”  he said at random.  If the volunteer workshops were to be believed, it was a good Income Generating Activity. But mostly he was remembering the wild sweetness of the fresh honeycomb he’d bought a month ago, from a man selling it out of a metal box strapped to the back of his bicycle.
“We’re in Somerset now,” Potter said. “I just noticed it on a sign.  There was something in Somerset I wanted to see...”  He dug out a wizarding guidebook and thumbed through it.  “Here it is – the Modesty Rabnott Snidget Reservation.  Have you ever seen a Golden Snidget in the wild?”
Narcissa’s eyes had a sheen of tears.  Harry wondered where she had hidden this child when Voldemort took over the Manor.
Harry’s memory flashed back years, to Lucius Malfoy groveling before Voldemort in a cemetery. “Your family’s ambitions didn’t serve anything worth serving,” he said in a tight voice.
Harry sat outside the castle and wondered what to do.  He pulled the gold carding-comb out of his pocket and looked at it.  He pulled it through his messy hair.  It hurt.
He opened his eyes to a look of wonder on an older Draco’s face. Seeing Harry’s shock, Draco pulled back.  “You were expecting someone else....”
A few minutes later, after talking with Lavender in the kitchen, Malfoy left. Harry turned to Ron. “Well, that was unexpected.” When Ron looked puzzled, Harry added, “Malfoy.”
Malfoy’s eyes lit up.  “You’re on, Potter.”  He turned off the Souper-duper with a flick of his wand, disappeared briefly into the bedroom, and returned in flying robes, carrying his own broom.  “Lead the way.”
“And then sometimes you’re here and fine,” Harry said, his mouth twisting, “and the war comes and snatches you back.”
He thought of a picture he had seen of his mother in her youth, before one sister left home, the other went mad, and she married his father.  In the photo she had smiled coyly, tossed her fair hair and laughed.  A pretty girl who liked pretty things.  She was more than that, of course, but that was part of who she was.
Charlie Weasley’s smile paused when he heard the name. His eyes searched Draco’s, but finally he nodded and held out his hand. “Always good to meet another dragon aficionado.”
Potter swore without any real heat and asked about the make of the broom, which Draco had bought on the Continent when visiting his mother in France.  Draco may have shown off a little with a few more stunts on the way to the pub.
“I don’t know,” Draco said.  “But the centaurs aren’t showing up to talk to me.  And they study the stars….”
“How fortunate that summer holidays have just begun,” Draco said.   He didn’t bother to contest the notion that Hogwarts had ever been a safe place for students.
“Thanks.” Harry had no idea what to say to Malfoy. His eyes landed on Malfoy’s fountain pen. It was cigar-shaped, a striking marbled green and black with a gold nib. “Nice pen.”
But that was water under the bridge now.  When Draco had cried out, after his suicide attempt, that Harry Potter would understand, he’d meant that Potter had witnessed enough of Draco’s mistakes and failures to know the world would be better off without him.  But Harry understood something else instead  – how it felt to be isolated, scorned, burdened by expectations you doubted you could ever meet.  Talking with him, Draco had found a path out of the darkness.
Rutherford shook her leg at Potter again, and clapped her wings to get his attention.  She’d crossed two continents twice over to deliver this poem, and if Potter knew what was good for him, he’d take it!
“Yes, but I try to limit magic use during business hours, because of the Muggles who come in.  I can’t run this shop on wizarding clientele alone.”
Harry pulled the little badge from a pocket and tossed it over.  It flashed as it spun through the air.
“Well, er, why don’t you have these for now – I’d probably kill them anyway.  I’ll bring your wand another day.”
An interesting exclamation for a Gryffindor, Draco thought.  “Has this sort of thing happened to you often?  Snakes in the pipes?”
As a child, Lily loved two children:  Sev, the friend who first opened up the wizarding world to her, and Tuney, the sister who could not follow her into that world.
Gabriel turned and flew toward them, lower this time, and again the cat leapt up, nearly touching him.
“So.…”  Draco tried to follow the trail of house-elf logic.  “You thought if you kept our course from being smooth, we would find true love?”
For his family’s survival, he threatened his Headmaster.  Dumbledore offered another way, too late for either of them.
“Of course I read the cards.  How do you think I learned wizarding history?  Certainly wasn’t from Binns.”  Potter sat and tore into his packet.
There was some short silky hair on his companion’s head, but other than that…  His hand touched linen.  Bears wore night-shirts?  Harry felt his way down a thin arm, stroked down a side and thigh, and then the linen ended and he was skimming his hand along a human-seeming leg of smooth skin with a light sprinkling of hair.
They didn’t fly far, because Malfoy didn’t want Fern left behind.  He was speculating whether Fern would be willing to go up in a basket attached to the broom.  Harry didn’t think that would work, because Malfoy loved pulling stunts like looping, so it was just talk so far.
It was almost summer, and though the stone wall of the Owlery was cool against Harry’s back, the air was warm, and so was Draco’s skin against his own. Their leisurely kiss was heating up nicely and all was well in Harry’s world, until he heard a gasp and looked up to see Lavender Brown in the entrance. She stared at them in horror, dropped the letter she’d been carrying, and ran back down the steps.
“Yeah, I used one.  Third year, with Hermione. We saved Buckbeak and Sirius.”  How elated he’d been. “But then Sirius died anyway.”
He stumbled over to the other bed, and sat down.  Just before he took his glasses off again, he noticed a pale hair on the blue pillowcase.  It made him think of Polyjuice potion, and as he lay down and finished tucking the net around himself, he wondered vaguely what it would be like to look in the mirror and see pale straight hair, grey eyes, an angular aristocratic face.  His mind’s eye filled in the rest of the lean body he’d seen emerge dripping from the lake that morning.  He turned his head against the pillow, pulled the sheet over him, smelled a faint, indescribable but pleasant scent.  He dropped off to sleep.
“Well… I was visiting Charlie Weasley at the dragon reserve in Romania. I didn’t know what to do next. He told me about Chinese dragons, so I decided to go there to see them. Then…” Harry trailed off. He could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him. He tried to ignore that; Teddy deserved an answer. “It seemed like a good place to clear my mind and try to learn some things. And then… I lost track of time.”
Which meant the sun was setting and he’d better pitch his little tent. He chose a spot under a tree by the edge of a meadow, had a simple meal and watched the stars come out. Finally he crawled back into the tent to sleep.
“Aw, no!  The acromantulas?” Weasley looked genuinely horrified and sympathetic.  “How did you get away?”
“For the Hospital and Haven for War-Damaged Magical and Muggle Beasts at Malfoy Manor.” The house-elf looked at him expectantly.
“True,” Harry said. “Your schemes of harassment were generally quite elaborate. Uniquely creative, compared to those of my cousin, say.”
One day, as he was sitting on a park bench scratching Wombat behind the ears, Draco was surprised to see Harry Potter walking towards him.
Their first effort was constrained by a lack of fresh ingredients, but Draco learned a little about the judicious use of herbs and spices, and Merfley promised to go shopping after the meal.
Malfoy cast a quick succession of spells for pure pleasure, it seemed – transfigured a cloak stand into a hawthorn tree in bloom, watered it with
The light was changing. The sun would be coming up soon. Harry sent off a Patronus, hoping Luna was an early riser.
Draco sat and waited for the battered, shrunken, ragged figure of his father to reach him.  Draco ached to see him like that, with his face so bruised and his eye all swollen.
“Here is Herman!” Merfley announced, holding out the cauldron full of water. Inside floated a greyish squid about three inches long, regarding him wide-eyed.
“Right.” Perhaps Arthur had got into too much trouble over the Anglia and didn’t want to share its secret. “Do you really know how to drive that thing? And does it actually run?”
Draco looked at his outstretched, mittened hand. “Where have you been, Harry Potter?” he said softly.
Back inside the cave, she breathed in her mate’s scent so that she would know it again. They had a melodic conversation and she let the tones of that voice reverberate in her heart.  She bent down to nuzzle a baby….
“I’ll still be your boyfriend,” Draco said. “I don’t care anymore if my father finds out and disowns me.  Let Brown tell the world.”
After Potter took him to a Muggle Chinese restaurant the next day, saying he was tired of eating salad for every meal, Draco decided he’d need to visit Gringotts and exchange some Galleons for Muggle money so that Potter wasn’t always the one paying.  Not that Potter seemed to mind.
always tucked it in somewhere, and it always said you weren’t in danger of dying at the moment. So that was a relief.”
The cat returned to sit next to Gabriel and Harry watched in astonishment as his owl gently stroked the black fur with his beak. “He’s grooming her.  Do you think this was love at first sight, or do you think they have a history together?”
After that conversation, their old animosity seemed largely defused. They had a tacit agreement to share the Owlery, and when they found themselves there together, they would often talk a little, gradually becoming more relaxed with each other. One evening in early spring they leaned side by side at a window, watching owls go forth and stars come out. Harry couldn’t help asking Draco again about the arranged marriage.
The tap in the back garden produced a shimmering, translucent snake of a pure deep ethereal blue.  As it hissed, Harry paused with his wand raised and hissed back.  “It’s in real distress,” he said.  “Claims to be fainting from the heat.”
“A prince is being forced by his wicked aunt to marry a troll princess with a nose three ells long.”
They got unexpected help with party expenses from Luna, who remembered that Mooncalf dung was valuable fertilizer. She gave some to Neville, who offered to buy more for his greenhouse, and found a few other buyers for them.
But where exactly was Harry?  The Protean Charm linked their coins; Draco hoped the link was strong enough to track with.  Holding up its string he said,
“Well, I’ve never been to that castle myself, but you might ask the East Wind.  She’s very keen and far-sighted, and maybe she could blow you there.”
Much of the path consisted of narrow, irregular stone steps. Harry paused to catch his breath after yet another set of them, and shook his head at a pair of carriers offering to take him up in a chair slung between two poles. “Do I look that helpless?” he asked Draco.
Draco froze.  “No.  No.”  Remembering how afraid they had all been of being bound and sent to Azkaban.  Remembering the day of battle at Hogwarts, when Granger stunned Greg in the Room of Hidden Things, and Draco had to drag his heavy, helpless body up onto a teetering pile of furniture, desperately trying to escape the Fiendfyre flames.  The weight of Greg holding him back as Potter tried to pull Draco up onto the safety of his broom.  Just thinking of it made his palms sweat again, made his breath come in gasps.
Once in France she did a bit of hunting as necessary to keep up her flying strength and then followed her Potter-sense over the countryside.  Over several days it grew stronger and stronger.  Finally she spotted a group of wizards and heard the tones of Potter’s voice.  She began sailing down to them, just as…  Potter disappeared.
Feeling unexpectedly comfortable with this starlit Draco, Harry waved an arm at the sky and asked, “Where are you, then?  Up there, I mean?”
“You’ll find a meal in there, and a little silver bell that you can ring for anything you want,” said the bear.
When he lifts the baby, she sees the father’s green eyes, though they don’t see her.  Sees the lightning scar half-hidden by his hair.  She forgot, time is different on the other side of the Veil.  Her son Harry is this man, older than she, older than James ever had a chance to become.  Her son is a father.  And Lily feels a fierce pride.
Harry was distracted by the sight of Draco Malfoy entering. Instead of sitting down, he went to the counter to pick up a takeout order. Harry went up to speak with him.
Then they headed to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, where the Meteorites had a match against the Haileybury Hammers scheduled in two days’ time.  While they waited, Harry and Draco flew out to Buffalo Pound Provincial Park, where they saw big shaggy bison and admired the pelicans with their long pouched beaks.  At least, Harry and Draco admired the pelicans.  The garter snake hid.
“Sure,” Draco said, and wheeled over to the bed.  He spread a spare sheet over it, wrestled his robe off, and lay down on his front in his silk boxer shorts.  Since they had started using massage oil, he’d been removing his robe to avoid staining.  It made it easier for Potter to reach his back, also.  Potter had given him no reason to distrust him during the massages, so Draco had relaxed considerably about them.
Delivering post in mid-air was tricky, so she waited for them to land, looking forward to praise, amazement, and the satisfaction of a job well done.  Then Rutherford heard the rush of dragon-wings and felt the heat of flames.  She dodged swiftly, indignant.  Owls are predators, not prey!  Dragons had no respect.
When Draco was settled and looked over, Potter’s cheeks were flaming and his face had a mixture of fear and defiance that was totally characteristic but, just now, unexpected.
She regarded him silently before speaking.  “Some of my people may be angry that I speak with you, but perhaps it is time that we consider working together.  There is to be a world council of the Houyhnhynm speakers, the magical horse beasts and beings, sons of Sleipnir and daughters of Al-Buraq.  Those with concerns are bringing them to their representatives.  It is long since we had such a meeting.”
At the tiny shop run by Harry’s teaching colleague, Mrs Kaliwa smiled warmly at him and exchanged greetings in Chichewa.  Harry tried to buy something there each time he came to market, but the inventory was so small that it took some ingenuity.  Meanwhile Draco admired her roly-poly baby son.
Party to a lawsuit, Draco thought.  Avian assault and battery.  “I am sorry.  I didn’t realise you thought I was still living at the Manor.  It’s been shut up for some time.”
“Hello,” said Harry.  “I’m trying to get to the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon.  Do you know the way?”
Draco brought him a cup of tea and then sat next to him with a damp cloth and a little pot of salve.  “Your clothes are all wet anyway, might as well take them off,” he said matter-of-factly, starting to lift the hem of Harry’s jumper. Harry squawked.
Draco gripped the edge of the sink, shaking.  He stared blindly at the grimy basin, now streaked with his tears, and heard in memory the taunting malice in the Dark Lord’s voice.
Draco began to move his hand in the way he remembered liking on himself. It was strange to hold someone else’s cock and feel nothing in his own.  But he could concentrate on Potter and he did, watching his eyelids quiver and his mouth curve, listening for small sounds and quickening breath, inhaling him, tracking Potter’s pleasure.
. “Thank you for the opportunity.  And oh, look how useful, the paperwork’s all ready.”  He gestured again and the parchment and quill that had been floating behind his back, triggered by the recording charm he’d activated, sailed onto his supervisor’s desk.
The dance ended with them standing in each other’s arms, a little short of breath, swaying together.
“Good thing, I don’t want to lose you to monkey-bite fever.  If that beast is your kin, he doesn’t seem to know it.”
Finally Draco gave a small, surprised “Hmm.”   Ron had tipped his chair back on two legs and was grinning.
Draco looked out. The first snowfall of the winter—it was tempting. ”I didn’t think to bring gloves, though,” he said.
“I have a wand, Potter.  It’s – acceptable.  Did you think I went wandless all these years while I waited for you to decide I was worthy of getting mine back?  How do you think I fixed your glasses, among other things?”
“Payment in kind.”   His toe pressed onwards.  Draco was starting to slump back in his chair, but with an effort struggled to his feet and pulled Harry with him into the cabin.
“As far as I know, there are no wolverines or moose in Britain,” Draco told him.  “We’d need your grandmother’s permission for an international Portkey, so I’m afraid it can’t be arranged tonight.  Maybe you’d better just sleep now and dream about it.”
“I’ll wipe it off.”  Draco went to wipe his hand on the sheet, and then thought better of it.  He traced a circle around Potter’s navel, then smoothed his hand up Potter’s chest and rubbed and stroked across his nipples.  Potter’s mouth had fallen open and the look in his eyes was acting on Draco like a drug.  Potter turned toward him slightly.  There was the slightest bit of oil still on Draco’s hand.  He reached around and cupped the warm roundness of Potter’s arse, rubbing his hand against it.
His parents would have been horrified. But following their path had led Draco to far greater horrors than laundry lessons, and besides, they weren’t here. His father was in Azkaban and his mother, having seen Draco safely through his own trial, had finally given way to nervous exhaustion and been sent by her Healer to southern France, to recuperate in the care of distant cousins.
As he read more widely in poetry, Draco began to want to write original verse, for himself.  It was not easy, but by trying to find words, suspended in his craft, time slipped by and he began to discover what he felt and what he thought.  And sometimes, if the words were right, they could preserve the wonder, or contain the pain.  And perhaps someday, reading them, someone else might enter his poems like a Pensieve and see through his eyes.
Draco nodded stiffly.  Once again, Potter was less clueless than this so-called therapist.  Draco would ask his mother to have a word with St Mungo’s.  They couldn’t treat a Malfoy like this.  Or was it because he was a Malfoy that the man cared so little?
“At his house, I suppose, if he isn’t at his shop?” Hermione turned as the other woman stood abruptly and moved toward a door. Hermione’s hand shot out to grab her wrist and tug her gently closer. “Harry? Have you read the letters I sent?”
“You can show him how to do my shoulders and arms,” he told Baines.  “And my feet and calves.  That’s all.”
“Aye, Hedwig had a great heart.  She was a wise one, too, knew something about raising a boy, like you were then, Harry.  But now you know your way around.  You could help some newer owl, that’s still learning.  Give a younger one a chance.”
“Not so far. I guess I should have asked for more details about how the animal haven would work. I was just glad not to be going to Azkaban, to tell you the truth.”
Harry swallowed.  This was the part he buried deepest, couldn’t bear to think of, couldn’t tell anyone, couldn’t manage to forget.  Dumbledore moaning, pleading like a child, while he, Harry … “That was my fault,” he managed to get out.
He arrived in a garden behind a large house. There was a Hippogriff, hissing dangerously. Harry turned to see what it was hissing at and was shocked to see Draco Malfoy, of all people, pointing a wand at the furious creature. Harry had arrived just in time.
“Lady Godiva had the right idea,” Harry said, tugging at Draco’s trousers and then his own.  Draco peeled his shirt over his head.
“Right.  And it always will be, so if you still have a problem with that, I guess it’s better to remember it now. You want to give people the whole truth about us, Harry?  We can barely handle that ourselves. I’d like to get out of this country in one piece.”
She trotted up and gazed at him with her intelligent eyes, dropped her head to nuzzle his hair, and then turned and cantered toward the stables.  He hurried after.  Bernard, who looked after the Abraxans, helped him yoke her to the chariot and transfer from his chair.  He left word with Bernard for Mme Maxime, gave a sign to Rosemonde, she galloped and spread her powerful wings and then they were aloft.
Parvati tilted her head and cupped Lavender’s scarred cheek in her warm hand. They pressed their lips together, and Parvati’s body was soft against her own. “Oh,” Lavender breathed.
Draco renewed his shield charm, trying to think.  It was impossible to Disapparate on school grounds.  How could he get out of this?
How long had Draco been worrying about how Harry would react?  Harry strove to find the right words.
They traveled a long way and finally as night was falling they came to a steep hill.  The bear knocked on the side of the hill with one great white paw, and a door appeared.  It opened into the hall of a castle, all gleaming with gold and silver and lit with candles.
Another current of feeling warms the room.  Lily notices the man lying in bed.  His disheveled hair gleams from the pillow, the same silver-blond as her grandchild’s.  He looks exhausted and content, and love beams from his grey eyes as if Harry and the baby are all that matters in the world.
“She hired me to do it!”  Greg was beaming.  “She said there were Gloomy Mimswuggles nesting under the slates, and the house needed a good sunning and airing out.  Then everyone in it will be happier.”
“I’d have loved a broom like that back when I was a Seeker,” the surely-a-Weasley said, echoing Draco’s thoughts.  “I need something sturdier now, though. When you’re dealing with dragons, ‘fire-bolt’ takes on a whole new meaning.”
“It would be sad if there were no baby Humdingers,” said Cho, sitting on the floor with her head resting against Pansy’s leg.
“Yes.” He could see she was warming to the topic.  “I’m doing a study comparing Eastern and Western magical traditions.  They really never covered that at Hogwarts.”  He nodded and she went on.  “But I need to narrow my focus  – it’s all fascinating but a bit overwhelming.”
“If you’re a fisherman you’re supposed to be happy about the fish, aren’t you Potter? But no, no fish. There were three horses pulling the sleigh and I was driving them. Rather expertly, if I say so myself.”
“Well, now that that’s settled, do you want some lunch? Merfley and I made some soup last night that turned out rather well.”
“Well, you still haven’t finished, Mr Resurrection.  It wouldn’t hurt you to be a bit more selfish this time around.  Don’t let the bad memories win.  You know better, right Potter?”
Alaska, they found from the map, was enormous, though sparsely settled.  “This must be seven times the size of Britain,” Draco said.  “Where do we begin?”
Someone was screaming in pain.  It was his mother.  He looked up – the cabinet reached high above him, as though he were at the bottom of a well.  He had to get to the top.  There was a ladder built into the side, but his legs didn’t work.  He tried to haul himself up by his arms.  His mother was screaming again.  His arms gave way and he slid down.
Cho Chang, now with asymmetrical indigo hair, swung around. “Hogwarts food? Kind of boring. Big slabs of meat, bland vegetables. Oh, hello Harry!”
Potter looked startled and Draco remembered that there was only the one broom.  But Potter smiled.  What Seeker wouldn’t prefer the freedom of the spring skies to the claustrophobic squeeze of Apparition, given the choice?
The cat came forward to sniff through the bars of the cage, but Harry covered it with the cloth.  “Where are we?” he asked Malfoy, trying to decide if he’d rather Apparate or take the Floo.
Harry found himself reaching forward.  He had the strangest impulse to skim over the scar with his fingertips, trace the line….
“I mean, are you in business to import tropical fish or something?  Getting a monopoly on them for potions ingredients or aquariums or something?”
Inside again, Harry hurried to find a candle and match while he could still see.  “Sorry it’s a bit of a mess,” he said, entering the little living room.  The wavering candle flame showed Draco sitting on one of the woven reed chairs with Kili purring on his lap, a small warm smile on his face.  A sudden, unexpected happiness caught Harry by the throat.
“My boss wasn’t interested, but Hermione Granger is working with me to try to get the Ministry to take it seriously.”
“Yes – but really people – Muggles – were often quite kind when I was lost or confused.  I guess they sort of expect it of travelers.  Actually, people were far kinder in places where I was a stranger than back in Britain where I was known.  It was – humbling.  But compared to horrifying, humiliating or heartbreaking, humbling isn’t so bad.”
If Draco had understood then that he’d never sire an heir, he could have been spared the humiliation of his failed marriage to Astoria.
“Let’s nubbump, Boy-toy,” Draco growled in his ear, making Harry laugh outright.  His laugh turned into a gasp as Draco began to thrust against him, grabbing his arse and pulling him close.  Harry yanked at Draco’s trousers and managed to wrestle them down over his hips, then wriggled most of the way out of his own.  And then it was all delicious friction of skin against skin, harder and faster, until Harry was incoherent with passion and they came one after the other in explosive messy glory.
That’s when Lily started using the violet perfume her mother used to wear.  The light, fresh fragrance seemed to keep her mother near.  When sorrow seized her, Lily would press her eyes shut, grip something to steady herself, and breathe.  Her mother’s love was rooted in her heart, and nothing could dislodge it.
Harry looked.  He saw a man he tried to let no one see - with a drawn face and big lost eyes under his mess of hair, part of his scar showing through.  Behind him, Malfoy’s fiercely determined look.  Malfoy’s pale hands cupping his shoulders.  He leaned back slightly into the solid comfort of a chest against his back and sagged against it, as Malfoy’s arm came firmly around his waist.  Harry remembered Malfoy clutching him on the broom as they raced the flames in the Room of Requirement. But this time Harry was the one who needed to be hauled out of the fire.
Draco was jolted from his thoughts by the sight of two figures flying right towards him.  Who would be flying up here at night?  He drew his wand.  Moments later, two brooms landed on the tower – it was Harry and Dumbledore.  In the dimness, they didn’t notice him.
“I was away.  I was feeling a bit unsettled, so I went along to France with Bill Weasley and his family when they invited me.  Fleur’s sister Gabrielle still lives there.”
He hadn’t done a thing about repairing the Vanishing Cabinet, or any other scheme for fulfilling Voldemort’s demand, since the
With difficulty Harry held himself back, then wrenched himself away and stumbled five steps to the pantry, grabbing the vegetable oil.  When he returned Draco was shedding the last of his clothes.
“Not Nott.” Draco looked back over at the living wizard next to him.  This Potter had greying temples and laugh-lines, and seemed more comfortable in his own skin.  Draco found it hard to look away.
“Tessie can take you to the East Wind.  You’ll know when you’ve reached her home – the air is quite bracing.  They call the wind Minerva.”
“Something is afoot,” Draco said.  “A-foot or a-fin.  The Anggitay and now this.  Maybe an ichthyocentaur will turn up for me to liaise with.”  But the water was still now.
About a week later Harry arrived to find Draco glaring at a letter on Ministry stationery. “It’s madness,” he said turning to Harry. “They want us to take in a Manticore. That’s an M.O.M. class XXXXX beast, ‘known wizard killer.’ How can we heal it if we’re dead?”
They nodded and said goodbye, strolling out together, shoulders bumping easily against each other, and Draco wondered if there would always be a head of flame-red hair taking the spot next to Harry’s wild black curls.
“We wouldn’t…” Potter began to protest, but then a glint of gold caught Draco’s eye, and Potter’s too, and both swiveled towards it like hunting dogs pointing at prey.
“No!  He – I don’t want him to – Get away from me!” Draco said, pushing himself to the farthest corner of the bed.
In the Hogwarts library Draco raised his head from an old bestiary and snorted.  “It’s a cock-horse.  Look – front end of a horse, back end of a rooster.  A bit like a hippogriff in reverse.”
The first people to come were a family with two small children. Luckily Luna took them in hand and steered them away from the more dangerous beasts. They watched the squidlets change color, tossed the contented Puffskein around a bit, and left satisfied.
Draco laughed, and rolled over and kissed him, and sunlight poured through the window, warming his skin, and Harry smiled up at him, warming his heart.
Potter laughed. “Molly Weasley makes them with the yarn left over from her Christmas jumpers, so I have plenty. I must have tucked a pair in my cloak pocket last winter and forgot them, grabbed another pair when I left tonight.”
“Thank you.  Could you write it out for me because I make splotches with a quill and could I borrow your owl?”
“No, Muggles here believe in magic – and they hate it all.  It’s all dark, as far as they’re concerned, and they’ll blame just about anything on witchcraft.  People have been killed for being suspected of witchcraft. I stay away from the subject as much as possible, because I like my neighbors so much otherwise.  So as far as wizarding goes, I’m definitely not out.” Immediately Harry regretted the wording as Malfoy’s eyebrows went up.
“Ah.”  There was a momentary flicker of what looked like confusion in his eyes, but then Lucius nodded, his face calm again.  “It looks like rain today.  There’s to be a garden party at four.”
Malfoy whooshed straight up and caught the very back bristles of Harry’s broom.  He crowed with triumph.
“It has its own ideas, apparently.  The doors come and go, spells don’t always work.”  Potter got up and came to lean in the doorway between the rooms.
Harry followed him and got a tour of the neat little boat.  “We can expand it, with wizarding space, of course,” Malfoy said, “but the outside needs to be small for the narrow canals and locks.”
And she was alone on her mountainside again. The sun was rising. She looked around, and saw in the distance the landmarks she’d found from the cave where her future lay.
Harry cocked his head and regarded Draco for a moment.  A mischievous light came into his eyes.  “Want to?”
“Very well, I accept.  I’ll make arrangements to visit the herd in the Forbidden Forest as soon as possible.”
“He’s more polite than he used to be. But he has the oddest delusions about wyverns. I can’t figure it out.”
But he turned back to look on his way out.  A feeling came over him that the cabinet held a secret to his future.  In the dimness of the shop, the opals gleamed, and the shriveled hand seemed to beckon him to return.
“I forgot it might be nighttime here,” Harry said in a hushed voice. He pulled on his mittens against the cold.
“We cannot depend on the Ministry, of course, weakened as it is by the Rotfang conspiracy,” Luna said.  “But we must do all we can to protect magical spaces.  When you described the Anggitay I thought of the sacred white horse, so I visited a couple of statues of the goddess before I came here.  That always helps me feel strong and calm.”
“By rainbow?”  Draco was impressed by her stamina, and wondered if she had a way to conjure up rainbows when she needed them.
Feeling awful, Harry hurried over. The creature rolled its bulging eyes in terror at his approach. Afraid it would injure itself worse, Harry used a mild Stunning Spell and tried to think what to do. He needed advice from someone who knew magical creatures.
“Whichever species it is, it isn’t venomous; they both kill by squeezing.  I may have over-reacted by stunning it.  If it’s the boa it will still have a painful bite, though.”
And there was that smile, the little warm smile Harry loved, and he needed to go find Draco, his Draco, now.
A date.  Along with the curl of pleasure that brought, something tugged at Draco’s memory as he walked with Harry through Golden Gate Park.  He’d become so involved in their serpentine travels that he’d forgotten about Harry’s previous interrupted attempts to meet with him after Beltane.  There had been something Harry wanted to talk to him about.  Something important enough that he kept trying, after peacock attacks and crashing roof slates and cancelled dinners.  Something awkward enough that he hadn’t just said it and been done with it.  Draco didn’t think it was romance – at least, not at the beginning.
“While you wait for your mer-centaur, how about a lazy liaison with me?”  said Harry.  He trailed a finger down Draco’s chest.
“He made an appointment for the next cold day in hell.  I can fit him in sooner if he wants to reschedule….  But really, Harry, what can I do?  I’m not going to grovel.”
“They need such different environments,” Draco said.  “If our temperature charms fail, we risk melting the ice snake if we bring it to New Guinea, or freezing the python if we bring it along to the ice.  I think garter snakes are a bit more adaptable.  Maybe we should make more than one trip.”
Harry came up behind him and pressed against his back, looking over his shoulder.  “A cock-horse, eh?  Should we let Luna know you’ve got one?”
A black horse’s head and front legs broke the surface of the lake and pawed the air.  Then the creature dove and its scaly black fishtail slapped the water with a splash.
Draco couldn’t help it, his hand reached out toward the tent in Potter’s pants like it was a fire he could warm himself at on a cold night.  He stopped a couple of inches away, sure he could feel the heat radiating toward him, sure he could see it rise even more under his gaze.
“Listen to his breathing, it sounds so strange. What’s the spell for this? Or is there a potion I could make?” Draco asked urgently.
“I’m not trying to flirt,” was what Draco meant to say, but what came out instead was, “How would you do it?”
Draco was about to agree when he abruptly realized that he would likely be lumped in with the bad.  “Sometimes people change course,” he said.  But her expression had turned distant.  Padma looked quite different from what he remembered of her twin, Parvati, who was always giggling with that other Gryffindor girl, the silly one, who…
“Thank you, I am quite proud of them, I admit.  They are bred for power.  Come visit me in France, and perhaps we can teach you.  It would be an honor to instruct the descendant of Aurore Chevalier.”
The bear was pacing back and forth now, talking in an agitated tone.  “They’ll slander me.  People do, they’re very unfair to bears.  They’ll try to turn you against me.  They will, and you’ll leave me, and I’ll never…  I’ll….  I’ll be…”  He flung himself down on his belly and covered his eyes with his paws.
“Harry Potter can be showing us all the steps, and we can practice with the Mooncalf!” said Merfley, who had joined them for lunch. His eyes were bright with enthusiasm.
This has some film rather than book canon.  The title is from a Shaker song by Joseph Brackett - lyrics
They dried off hastily and fell into bed, and Draco felt a fizz of pride that his hands could make Harry come.  And then a wave of tenderness at the unguarded awe on Harry’s face.
“Friends?  Gabriel and some stupid cat?”  Harry snorted.  “That’s about as likely as Malfoy and me becoming friends.”
Harry took his hand and drew Draco’s fingers over scars he had never known Harry bore.  On Harry’s forearm.  On his chest.  The back of his right hand.  And then he brought Draco’s hand to his face, and Draco brushed his fringe aside with trembling fingers, and touched lightning.
“That whole business with Dumbledore’s wand – that was strange, though.” Malfoy frowned.  “I’ve never understood why it was so easy to make Dumbledore lose his wand that night.”
“I don’t, really.  But you can give me the hot, wet kind.  That tastes alright with milk and sugar, and keeps one from falling asleep.”
And in fact Draco was a fairly good driver. The Vauxhall Wyvern could no longer be considered a speedy car, but it didn’t break down, and they reached the boundary of the old wyvern reserve in one piece. “Now what?” said Draco.
“I mean no harm!” Draco called after her.  “I’m the Centaur Liaison!  Can I do anything for you?  Do you have any messages for us?”
Getting no immediate answer other than a long look, he leaned back, slid his foot out of his flip-flop, stretched out a bare toe and nudged Malfoy’s knee.
“Well, if anyone has earned a vacation from responsibility it’s you, Harry. I know you hate being called a hero, but…”
“And what if I do?”  Draco reached up to trace lightly, so lightly, over the zigzag of Harry’s lightning-shaped scar.  Harry sighed and bent to kiss the faint trail of scar on Draco’s chest.
“The castle lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and there is no way for you to get there.  I’m sorry, Harry.  Good-bye.”  And Draco was gone before Harry could see which way he went.  Harry searched, and called, but Draco was nowhere to be found, and finally Harry was so tired he fell asleep.
“He’s estranged from his father. That helps. He’s even mixed with some of Ted’s family at Teddy’s birthday parties. I think Muggles still baffle him a bit, but he doesn’t sneer at them anymore, and he’s been a good cousin to Teddy. And you,” she said, giving Harry a thoughtful look, “do you ever see your Muggle cousin?”
“All right.  Let me see about protecting the plants first, and then we’ll talk about it.  You could, er, have a cup of tea and some biscuits while you wait.”  Draco turned to Potter, who was regarding him with disbelief.
“I’m just imagining what Snape would have said if someone had tried using one of those in potions class.”
But then Murgatroyd became head of the Beast Division.  Murgatroyd didn’t like the Malfoy family, didn’t like the Black family, and didn’t care why Draco had done what he had done in the war years or whether he had changed any since.  Now, apparently, Draco was to be sacked.
The next morning as Draco approached Hagrid’s hut, he saw Potter out working in the garden. Not even using a wand, just hacking at the ground.
She turned on Draco.  “Don’t laugh at Harry just because he’s a little shy.  You should get out more too, young man. ”
They walked to a quiet spot and sat on the sand together.  The sun came out and the breeze died down, and Harry took off his shirt.   He closed his eyes and a smile spread across his face.
“Good, you don’t see peas very often.”  They stopped for bread rolls at the little bakery stand, and candles from another little shop.
Draco, squeezed between Harry and a young woman nursing her baby, merely remarked that it was lucky neither of them was tall.  There was little leg room, shoulder room, or any other kind of room, but they were better off than the conductor, who had no seat at all when the bus was full, and contorted his body into whatever limited space was available.  Children sat on laps, packages lay underfoot, and a few chickens flapped their wings disconsolately under the seats, legs tied together to prevent escape.
Malfoy must have been truly absorbed in his book to pass up an opportunity to complain, Harry thought.  He felt a little bad about having brought Malfoy something he clearly didn’t like.  But only a little bad.
“Ah.”  Draco held Harry's eyes for several breaths. “For that – I’d need to do some research.”  Harry couldn’t read his face.  There was a wary reserve in his posture.
Chair-bound.  Draco felt trapped.  He couldn’t seem to catch his breath.  He needed to get out, NOW.
“Here – I’ll stand where you can see me,” Potter said, coming around to stand near Draco’s face and putting his hands on the sheet in front of him.  Draco relaxed a little.  Baines began to knead Draco’s shoulders, talking to Potter in a low voice.  It did feel good.  Draco closed his eyes.
“Hmm.”  Hermione looked curious herself, but didn’t press it.  “You could ask a reference librarian.  They’re not all like Madam Pince, you know,” she added, seeing Harry’s less than enthusiastic expression.  “Or ask Padma Patil.  She’s opened a bookshop called The Raven’s Nest, and carries some things you’re not likely to find at Flourish and Blotts.  I have to stop by there this weekend to pick something up, you’re welcome to come with me.”
Malfoy looked a little nervous as he ushered Harry in.  They stood in the living room as Harry drew out the wand and held it toward Malfoy.  Just as Malfoy reached for it, Harry tightened his grip so that Malfoy had to tug.
Harry shook himself. Time to change the subject. “All right.” He drank his tea. “So Lavender, I hear you and Parvati opened a business together? Congratulations.”
The light drained from Draco’s eyes, and his face and hands stilled.  “Well, our family ambitions didn’t serve us very well in the end.”
Harry woke in the middle of the night and poked his head outside. The full moon had come up and the world was awash in silvery light. Something called to him.
“I’m just trying to give them a positive connection they can understand.  They can see that we’re close.”
Harry sat.  “Tell my parents not to trust Peter Pettigrew. Expose Tom Riddle and clear Hagrid’s name. Tell my father not to be such an arrogant berk around Snape, when they were at school.”
“Not everything. I kept the really good things, like my memories of you, and your parents. I kept them safe. But maybe I didn’t look at them enough.” Harry squatted down to Teddy’s height. “Maybe we could make some new good memories together?”
Meanwhile it was hot and the students complained that they couldn’t concentrate.  Harry flipped through the English textbook looking for something that might hold their interest.  No one wanted to work on grammar, himself included.  He found an excerpt from the novel
Narcissa had been watching all three of them.  “This is Harry Potter.  I’m about to show him some of the family portraits in the hall.  Why don’t you and Draco stay here and have a chat.”
Harry had to chew longer this time – it was a caramel. “Yeah, these fancy chocolates are nice,” he said when he finally finished. He grinned. “Still, there’s nothing like a good treacle tart.”
“I said I would.”  Draco looked puzzled and a little apprehensive, rising slowly to his feet as the cat, sensing trouble, jumped away.   “I can go, if you’d rather….”
Soon Draco put the book aside and there was darkness.  Harry lay there willing himself to sleep, without success.  His dream of the afternoon came back to him vividly.  Here he was in the same room – between the same sheets, even – and there was Draco, just in the next bed.  Why had he imagined he’d be able to relax here?  Finally he couldn’t keep still any longer.  He got up as quietly as he could, felt around for his glasses and flip-flops, and groped his way toward the door.
Draco took an unsteady breath.  He didn’t even lick the chocolate off his lips, because he could foresee that Harry Potter was about to do that for him.
“I have to visit my parents today; I promised my mother.  I don’t ... I don't suppose you’d want to come.” Draco shot him a quick look and then turned immediately to straighten his perfectly straight robes.
Draco followed him on a tour of the house’s plumbing.  They didn’t find any more inside.  “I guess that’s all,” Harry said.
“Oh – did we say we’d go flying?”  Draco had been working on an updated version of the Broom-Cat.  The double-handled broom he’d invented, with a seat suspended in-between, was easily controlled with the arms alone.  Now he was trying to improve the speed and responsiveness, without sacrificing stability.  He’d wanted to try out his new prototype.
The third time they applied the lust lotion so liberally that when they went to use it the fourth time it was gone.  “Never mind,” Draco said, “I don’t think we need it.  Besides, it doesn’t taste very good, which is really stupid in a lust lotion.”
Her dings rang out, clear and sweet in the mountain air. Humming a lullaby, she blibbered hopefully in the promised direction.
“We can talk about the war if we need to,” Harry said.  “But do we need to?  You’ve said you changed your beliefs, and I believe you.  I wasn’t a saint either.  If we have to go back and apologise for every single thing….  There was something Chaucer said.  Let me find it – I marked it.”
“Understood,” said the bear, facing him again.  “But don’t you want to get out of here?  See the world?  Have an adventure?”
Harry took a breath.  He stood behind Draco and cupped his shoulders, meeting Draco’s gaze in the reflection of the glass.  Then he drew his arms around Draco and bent his head to brush light kisses along his neck.  Harry shut his eyes and followed his instincts, letting his hands roam across Draco’s body, nuzzling his face into Draco’s neck, until Draco made a noise in his throat that sent Harry’s hands groping blindly down to cup Draco’s swelling crotch.  Draco turned in his arms, pressed himself against Harry and kissed him fiercely.
“New Guinea?  Python, then. Perhaps we could run a hot bath and let it enjoy the steam while we figure out what to do?”
That night the pug-nosed lassie returned and took Harry back up to the bedroom where Draco was sleeping.  Harry gave him a kiss and called to him:
Draco’s legs still weren’t co-operating.  Professor Snape brought him downstairs to the castle door by
Regulus, his mother’s other cousin, was a star in Leo – a strange constellation for a Slytherin, but then he was a mystery.  When Draco had been made Seeker on the Quidditch team, his mother had smiled and said “Like Regulus,” then stopped at his father’s frown.  When Draco asked, his father said that Regulus had displeased the Dark Lord – and that was all.
“Home is where you make it, Harry,” Draco answered, serious now, a questioning look in his eyes for a long moment before he abruptly turned his head away.  Chilled, Harry felt him withdrawing – hell, what just happened?  He made himself take a deep breath.
Potter cast a dubious glance at his card.  Mirabella Plunkett, famous for transfiguring herself into a haddock to be with her merman love.
– how could Draco have been so stupid?  True, he would rejoin his father at last, but Azkaban wasn’t where Draco had hoped to have their reunion.  And if that meant his mother was alone – Draco had no confidence that his Aunt Bellatrix would defend her against the Dark Lord’s displeasure.
“I can’t give it to you, but you need it.  Do you think I want you to have what you need?”  That was as plain as he dared to be, wand transfer was so tricky.  Draco gripped his wand.
Under cover of the child’s squeals of laughter, Draco nudged Potter and said, “Hear that?  A cock-horse.  Perfectly innocent word that happens to have cock in it.”
“I’m Harry, and my philosophy has a pretty active imagination. Are you comfortable?”  Harry shifted a little.  “Here, you can lean back against me.”
With effort, Draco stopped himself. He pressed his eyes shut.  He couldn’t prove that he wasn’t a burden by demanding to go when Harry didn’t want him along.  Draco didn’t want the history of his injury to bind Harry to him, like a Room of Parole with no exit. If they were ever to have a future together, Harry had to be able to choose it freely.
“Charming,” Harry said dryly, but Malfoy just nodded, looking toward his cat with a slightly melancholy expression.  Fern was now sitting next to Gabriel with a foreleg draped over his shoulder.
“It won’t actually misquote you, Potter.  It just colors the context, according to how it’s set when activated.  There’s scurrilous innuendo, wit, neutrality, flattery, porn…”
“What’s the Giant Squid doing way out here?” Harry asked. Though he might just as well ask what he and Malfoy were doing out here. Wherever here was.
“Out to the next school over.  One of the teachers showed me around.  I asked about the name of the school.”
“Well, she is damned intelligent.  And on the whole, it’s a relief not to have to pretend otherwise.  Come on, boyfriend, I’ll buy you an ice cream.”
Draco nodded to an old woman swaying down the path toward them with an enormous bundle of firewood on her head.  She bent her knees slightly in response, in lieu of nodding her head.
These days Potter’s hair might be the color of a very chalky blackboard, but his eyes were still brilliant green.
The dark jarring notes returned louder and more threatening, but the melody of determination, now stronger and joyful, broke in, building to a crescendo, sustained, triumphant, and then releasing in small sobs of relief, a gradual diminuendo, some somberness, but finally peace.
“What’s he doing with…”  Draco began, annoyed, but stopped because Greg was looking so distressed.  “Never mind.  It’s good you’re here.”
“Go away and stay away,” he told the owl, giving it the parchment. From the room where he’d pent her up for safety, Fern yowled.
Harry went for a lot of long broom rides after Ginny broke up with him. Eventually he felt more at peace about the whole thing – relieved, even – but the Gryffindor Common Room still felt like an awkward place, and he found himself wandering up to the Owlery again late one winter afternoon.
“I’ve been here a couple of years as a volunteer – I just have a few months to go on my assignment.”
The first hand Draco wanted was Harry Potter’s – just to shake in friendship.  But Draco couldn’t share a friend with a Weasley, and Potter had no taste.
Arthur’s head popped up. “Harry!” He hurried to meet Harry and then there were more delighted exclamations and questions. Finally Harry gestured to the car.
If that was a hint, Draco was going to ignore it. Potter could probably have any job he wanted, and he chose this? “Great use of your skills, I’m sure.”
“House-elves can do amazing things,” Harry said.  “Dobby blocked Platform 9 ¾ once, to try to keep me from going to Hogwarts.”
Harry tilted his head so his nose rubbed along Malfoy’s jaw line and his mouth almost touched that pale smooth throat.  “What?” he asked, so close to Malfoy’s skin that he felt the reflected warmth of his own breath.
Draco looked surprised and pleased.  Harry supposed Draco’s parentage seldom won him favour any more.
Draco’s jaw dropped.  He stared at his boss.  “I am not lying,” he managed to say, and then turned on his heel and left.
A serendipitous source of information, perhaps. “Have you, by any chance, heard of a dragon called Zmey Goryn… Zmey Gorny….”
Dumbledore looked grave, Snape looked impassive, and Potter looked startled.  Dumbledore turned to Potter.  “We’ve waited to ask you more about this, Harry, until we could get Draco’s account also.  But perhaps now you’d like to tell us what happened in the bathroom that day, before Professor Snape found the two of you there?”
“How about a pudgy dog?” Potter moved his hand to stroke the shaggy brown dog sitting at Draco’s feet.
“No, I saw their pictures carved on some of the Pictish stones,” Thomas said.  “I was trying to get a sense of Scottish magical art history, and those stones go back at least to medieval times.  Beautiful animals on them, too, worth flying out to see.  They’re at Meigle, Aberlemno, Glamis…”
Malfoy froze.  “Acquitted of all major charges, Potter.  Served my parole years ago.  If you’re looking for a threat to the wizarding world, it isn’t me.”
In San Francisco Harry and Draco found rooms at a wizarding bed-and-breakfast, since neither of them was in a hurry to go home yet. Then they wandered around.  Shop windows were full of posters for San Francisco Pride, the upcoming Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Celebration and Parade.  “Visiting from England?  You should stay for the parade!” a rather flirtatious young man told them.
“In any case,” Draco said with dignity, “Herman is a valiant and significant representative of the giant squid species. He is helping us to prepare an aquatic refuge for himself and his siblings, who were affected by curse fall-out in the Great Lake at Hogwarts. We hope that what they may have lost in, er, physical magnitude may be made up for by greater adaptability in appearance. We hope to not only revive their chromatophores, but add the photophores, iridophores and bioluminescence that other members of the squid family can flaunt.”
Draco turned sharply.  That was Potter’s voice, and Potter shouldn’t have known who was writing to him.  But the non-descript man addressing him didn’t look like Potter.
One didn’t survive the Dark Lord without learning how to keep memories locked away.  Draco banished that one, took a deep breath and knocked.
It was a miserably rainy autumn Sunday and Harry was restless, not in the mood for company. He wandered empty corridors of Hogwarts lost in thought, brooding over his latest confusing argument with Ginny, until he found himself on the fourth floor by the stairs to the Owlery.  He hadn’t been back there yet since returning to school as an eighth year student.  On impulse he headed up.
“Yeah, those public appearances are draining sometimes, aren’t they,” Harry said as he came over to rub Draco’s shoulders.
“She had to leave to look for Blibbering Humdingers.  It’s their mating season in the Canary Islands.  She told me to start work on your roof when we got a stretch of sunny weather.”
Draco had turned back to blow out the candle, then tuck in the net on his side, where the opening was.  Then he lay down.  In the dark, Harry just heard their breaths and the rustle of sheets when one of them moved.  He turned onto his stomach, facing away, hoping that would help him sleep.  His foot brushed Malfoy’s.
Malfoy drew the pen from his lips where he’d sucked the tip.  “As you like.”  He placed it upright on the parchment, where it began to write.
And then Old Timer gave a last long sigh. “He’s gone limp,” Draco said in a choked voice. “He’s gone—” His face crumpled.
Draco let out the breath he had been holding.  “Who’s there?” Dumbledore said.  “Ah –  good evening, Draco.”
The moon rose over the horizon. Quietly the other Mooncalves emerged. The young Mooncalf with them stood quivering at attention and then stepped out from the shadows.
Malfoy’s lip twitched. “That’s funny, I could have sworn that was the new Stratoblaster Three Thousand.”
Over the next few weeks, plans for the fun-raising party proceeded apace. Merfley tried to teach the Mooncalf dance, which he called a quadrille, to anyone who was willing, though there were never enough dancers to practice all the steps. He also spent a lot of time with Herman and the squidlets.
Mme Maxime gave him permission to take Rosemonde anywhere that Rosemonde was willing to go. Once he even flew into England to deliver a shipment of Portkeys, since the making of Portkeys was restricted in Britain now.  The Reseau had only approved that mission if Draco Polyjuiced as an able-bodied wizard, but there were problems with the Polyjuice and he barely got out before the changing back began.  Going through that painful transformation in mid-air over the Channel had been hazardous, and the Reseau refused to let him try a mission like that again.
“I wouldn’t dream of it, sir,” Draco said blandly.  “Your mellow – should you be fortunate enough to achieve one – will remain unharshed by me.”
Draco slanted a suspicious look at her and she smiled brilliantly back, then turned and walked off, calling over her shoulder. “Owl me the details.”
Harry stared at the snake.  It had only partly emerged; the tail end was presumably still up the pipe.  “Salazar Slytherin,” he muttered, “why me?”
The Hippogriff snuck over to the food table and made off with some rock cakes, which made Hagrid laugh.
Harry snorted.  “I guess Professor Snape didn’t believe in the Chinese zodiac.  Healer Highgroove doesn’t seem to either.  Still treating me like an idiot.”
There were plenty of reasons Draco was not comfortable in Malfoy Manor any more, but he didn’t need to discuss them with Potter.  “The peafowl will all die off eventually.”  In fifteen or twenty years.
“In my fourth year, you stopped another professor who’d used transfiguration against me.” He couldn’t bring himself to mention the humiliating details.
He looked again at her laughing face in the newspaper. When had he seen her look that carefree?  Not for a long, long time.  Toward the end of their relationship, she had become restless and snappish.  Like a wild animal penned up, he thought suddenly.  Better to let it go – and in his mind’s eye he saw a fox leaping away through a meadow, bright fur flashing.
An hour later, several glasses of quite good wine had managed to loosen Harry's tongue.  “You’re an owl beyond compare, Ignatius.  Such golden feathers.  Such intelligent black eyes. Face like a white heart.  Devastatingly good-looking.”  Mollified, Ignatius let Harry  stroke him.  It was nice.  Harry hadn’t had an owl since Hedwig.
“We can apply heat to raw food and often achieve an edible result. But we usually don’t have to, because my sister is a professional kitchen goddess.”
“I’ll take this nimble little beauty, then.”  Harry swung a leg over the broom and pushed off.  It was so responsive that he found himself veering, overcompensating, and wobbling while Malfoy cruised nearby, laughing at him.
Harry caught his hand and they watched the tiny lights flash. “Oh,” said Harry,  “I found that poem.  I asked Padma Patil about it.”
“Potter, allow me to present Æthelflæd, our resident veterinarian.” Malfoy’s eyes were gleaming. “She is named for a Muggle warrior queen who defeated enemies by dropping beehives on them.”
That reminded Draco of a poem that had struck him recently, he wasn’t sure why.  It was in a borrowed book that he’d need to return soon.  Perhaps he should make a copy.
“I’m sure you’re still her favorite person,” Harry found himself saying.  “Favorite non-mouse-hunting being, probably.” Malfoy smiled a little.
him in the sunlight, just moments earlier, and now here they were in the dark, and that memory was his alone.
And then Harry was standing on Diagon Alley, alone in a jostling crowd of strangers.  Aroused, confused, bereft.
When he woke the second time, he was alone and had energy to get up and wash.  Then he swapped the cleaner sheets onto Draco’s bed.  It was the best he could do.  When he went outside he saw Draco sitting under a tree some ways off, not reading but staring at the water.  Harry wandered over. “Sorry I used your bed,” he said, unable to look Malfoy in the face.  “The other net was torn and I was too tired to do anything about it.”  He waited for iciness, derision, scorn.
Malfoy’s eyes flickered as he looked at Harry. He shrugged. “The Wizengamot has designated this as a sanctuary for injured beasts, but whether you bring one here is up to you, I suppose.”
His initial concern evaporated.  “Don’t mind him, Gabriel,” he said.  “Malfoy’s always been a whiner.”
“I believe I could do well as a Goblin Liaison,” Draco said quickly.  “I have an interest in finance, and…”
“I can’t believe anyone thought that a night-time trip to the Forbidden Forest was an appropriate detention for first years,” Draco retorted.  Memories of a creepy cloaked figure bent over a dead unicorn had given him nightmares for months afterwards.
“Teddy is a joy. I don’t know what I’d do without him. And he hasn’t had any more trouble since he began taking that potion.”
Draco’s eyes took on that gleam of amusement that Harry was starting to recognise. He began to recite in rapid-fire rhythm:
“Hey, I hear a waterfall,” Harry called, so they flew over and found a beautiful cascade.  They made a game of flying close enough to get splashed with spray.  Refreshed and laughing, they headed back to Popondetta for a meal of fish, sweet potatoes and rambutan, a fragrant and odd little fruit that Harry said looked like a hairy eyeball.
Draco hadn’t seen an Abraxan since the ones that pulled Mme Maxine’s carriage from Beauxbatons to the Triwizard Tournament years before. Even wounded, this was a magnificent animal.
“Brilliant, Cassia!  I doubt Draco reads medieval Welsh.  Dafydd ap Gwilym is a great poet and wrote mostly love poems.  Some of his racier ones may not be translated in the printed anthologies, but you can check the internet – do you know how to use it?”
No, Draco wasn’t demanding that he come, wasn’t looking expectant or even hopeful. He looked, in fact, resigned, as if he was bracing himself to go through an ordeal alone.  And that was what decided Harry.
“I can teach you to make a Patronus, Draco.  But I agree on not wanting to stay awake and on guard all night.   We have safely delivered the tree python, so we can head home with a clear conscience.”
Rosemonde turned and brought them down again, where they could hear the Dark Lord jeering.  “Got a little cripple to be your nancy-boy, eh Potter?  Call that virtuous, do you?”
He wanted to so much that he froze and excused himself, thanking them but waving his twig repair kit vaguely, as if fixing up his broom was too urgent to put off.
Murgatroyd narrowed his eyes at him.   The quill waggled helpfully next to the signature line on the parchment authorizing the job transfer.  Murgatroyd scowled at it, then shrugged and signed. “You’ll need permission from the Headmistress to enter.  If you get it, you have until the end of the summer to learn something useful.  After that, you’re out.”
Rutherford looked dubious, but bore the unsigned message without complaint and returned empty-taloned.
“My favorite cousin is a Wizard-born Muggle. She went to Muggle schools and told me what she studied.  She liked literature classes.  I borrowed her books, and went on from there.”
There was chaos at the castle – a huge battle being fought outside on the grounds.  Not only wizards but giants, centaurs, suits of armor, spiders – general pandemonium.  Rosemonde whinnied to the silent skeletal flying horses.  Draco looked for Harry but couldn’t see him.  He and Rosemonde circled over the battlefield. Jets of curse light shot everywhere.
“Yes.  Well.”  Malfoy seemed to pull himself back together, as if striving for an air of merely professional interest.  “Enjoy your specs.  You should be able to see more clearly now, though it may take your vision a while to adjust.  You can always come back for maintenance and repair.”
“You cleared out your mind? Like a cupboard? Did you throw away the things you knew before?” Teddy frowned. His godchild. How could Harry have abandoned him for so long?
Draco was looking at him with a little frown.  “All right – I’ll try to think of something.”  He tucked a lock of Harry’s hair behind his ear.  “Sleep now?”
“I wondered… the Anggitay coming here, and I think I saw a campchurch in the Great Lake…  is there something special happening?”
“Pragmatic, Potter.  And for better or worse, my father was influential.  Without his support, Voldemort would’ve been weaker.”
Harry laughed, and snogged him, and they stumbled their way up to the hut and inside.  As soon as the heavy door shut Draco leaned his back against it for support, feeling weak at the knees, and then Harry was pressed against him, moving, and all was unbearable sweet friction that made Draco incoherent until Harry pulled back and tugged him toward the bedroom.
Harry opened his mouth to answer and found he wasn’t sure what to say. Indeed, how was Malfoy?  Just before the fierce fun of the snowball fight, there had been that odd moment when Malfoy seemed to have gone somewhere else but left his body behind.  He’d looked so shaken afterwards.
The next morning when Harry awoke he was alone in the bed.  He found some clean, nice clothes and put them on, and they actually fit him.  Following the smell of something good, he found his way to the room with the dining table, which was again covered with all kinds of foods that tasted much better than anything he’d ever eaten at his aunt and uncle’s house.
“Mmm.  Now that we’re not in such a hurry ” –  Draco sighed as Harry traced his collarbone with light fingers – “let’s recreate it.”
Soon the silvery hare of Luna’s Patronus came lolloping up. “Oh, the poor Mooncalf! Luckily there is a magical beast hospital and sanctuary that just opened up. Here are the Apparition coordinates—you can go there first and they can come and help you to transfer the patient. Moving anyone with broken bones is tricky.”
Draco had a better idea. He swept Harry Potter into a scorching kiss. “Mine,” he told the dragon, “claimed by Draco, dragon of stars.”
“A giant serpent invaded his nest when he was still a fledgling,” said Artemis. “It would unnerve anyone.”
“Children who age out of foster care.  They’re still awfully young to be on their own with no family they can rely on. I heard about a support organization they formed, and thought I could help out.”
“My girl is like a magpie around bright shiny little facts. She just has to collect them,” Padma said fondly.
Gabriel looked attentive, but did not reply.  He shuffled back and forth on his feet, and glanced toward the window, which Harry had closed.
Harry tried to tell himself. He traced his fingers lightly over a sharp cheekbone, pulled a T-shirt off over a head of fine silky hair, ran his hands over a smooth back and a chest marked by a thin line of scar tissue.
“Teddy?  He’s brilliant.  Right now all he can think about is Hogwarts. I want to see him while I can, before he starts there in the autumn.”
Sometimes Fern scampered along the towpath, stretching her legs, while Gabriel flew overhead.  The boats moved at a walking pace, no more than 4 miles an hour, so there was no danger the animals would be left behind unless they went into the fields to hunt.  They seemed to understand that they should keep the boat in sight.  The only difficulties came when they encountered dogs, but the combination of cat and owl was enough to keep them at bay.
Baines and Potter moved on to his arms and hands, Baines taking his right side and Potter following along on his left.  Draco’s robe had loose sleeves, and he’d taken to wearing nothing but boxer shorts underneath for ease in dressing, so it was easy for them to push the sleeves up to his shoulder.
When Harry turned back, Malfoy was making his way over to a seat by the window. He gazed out, an unguarded, bleak look on his face. The steely light of an overcast winter afternoon fell on his angular face with a harsh beauty.
Harry shook his head. Of its own volition, his hand moved to stroke Draco’s cheek, but he caught himself and stopped.
“Here.”  Draco pushed the pillow to the center of the bed, between them.  Harry lifted his head to rest on the pillow next to Draco’s, turning to face him.  The spot on the pillow was warm.
“I came closest in Japan, between the mountain shrines and the hot springs.  But… sometimes we don’t realize what we’re really looking for.  When I first came back from France, I guess I was expecting to find a poem.  When I didn’t… my disappointment surprised me. I didn’t want to think about it.  Now, I think perhaps I should have shown more appreciation for the poems I did get.  Especially the later ones, that came after most of them had stopped.”
One day Harry came in to find Draco sitting at a mass of papers. “Bills.” Draco sighed. “Do you know how much single malt whisky a full-grown Abraxan goes through in a month?”
Madame Pomfrey appeared in the doorway.  “Good, you’re awake,” she said.  “I don’t think you should try getting up for the bathroom yet, so I’ve brought these.  It’s easy to Banish things afterwards.”  She had a flannel, a towel, soapy water in a basin, and a bedpan.  Draco’s face turned hot.
“You must have had some idea,” Draco said.  “I notice you didn’t randomly choose a spell that showered me with buttercups.  Just what did you know about it?”
“That’s just it,” Draco said.  “You can’t always simply accept what others tell you, especially if what they say is… unkind.  See what people do.  And if you go wrong – try to right yourself.”
“No, sorry,” said Harry.  “I’m trying to get to the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon.  Do you know the way?”
, Harry thought.  He served a few types of tea, but his shop couldn’t specialise in everything, and fresh-ground coffee was the smell Harry loved.  In his experience, people who were passionately particular about tea were unlikely to be satisfied by anything he could offer anyway.  If this annoying person didn’t want – or notice – the choices on the menu, he could just go elsewhere.
“You said that my son is not your son. Naturally I assumed that you wished our marriage dissolved, as you prefer not to have a family.” Narcissa’s voice was cool. She fixed her husband with a steely look. “Or perhaps I misheard?”
