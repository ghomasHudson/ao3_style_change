“I’m not sure leaving them to their own devices is a good idea,” Draco said as he watched them through the glass panels in the storefront. “Though I won’t complain for a few minutes of peace.”
He sighed, opening his eyes finally to look at her questioning face. “Believe me, I wish this was that.”
“Good,” came her reply, with a look on her face that he knew meant he wasn’t getting out of this agreement.
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, sounding scandalised. “Careful, he’ll hear you and then you’ll have a lot of explaining to do when Ginny comes home tonight to hear James saying bollocks.”
“Mm,” Malfoy said as he took another sip. Placing the glass down on the table between them, he tilted his head as he looked at Harry, searching his face for something. “So, Potter. Care to explain what was so urgently in need of discussion that you had to owl me about it in the middle of the night?”
Harry hated pacing. He hated watching it happen, hated hearing it happen and most of all, hated doing it himself. But he couldn’t sit still for longer than a few seconds before his temper got the best of him, so it was best to pace right now.
In the past year since their conversation in Draco’s study, Harry had come to Malfoy Manor more times than he’d ever dared to hope. It had been more frequent in the early months, when they’d still been navigating their issues from the years of dancing around one another and keeping the secret from their respective children. Astoria had been able to entertain Scorpius, allowing them the space to be alone and uninterrupted. After everyone had returned to school it had simply made more sense for Draco to stay with Harry, so that on the nights he couldn’t have Ginny watch Luna, Draco could floo over after she’d fallen asleep. Harry associated his own home with their relationship more strongly, but perhaps that was simply because they had become more comfortable with one another during the time they’d spent there.
“I suppose not.” Sighing, Draco offered a strained smile. “I was sorry to hear about your divorce, by the way.”
Despite the fact that Draco had been the one to broach the topic, it was clear that he was feeling in over his head right now. Knowing better than to preemptively reassure him, Harry counted slowly to ten in his head.
Pressing his eyes shut tightly, he forced all of his muscles to clench and then relaxed them slowly, one at a time. Without even realising he had moved to touch it, he lifted his hand away from where it had ended up on his scar; though he wasn’t bothered by pains in his forehead anymore, it still seemed to be a reflex whenever things became too much to handle. Harry couldn’t remember the last night he had spent where things hadn’t overwhelmed him and he had given up wondering when it would finally come.
“Zonko’s?” He asked Malfoy, eyes determinedly fixed on where Teddy was playing and not the blonde beside him.
As he watched Draco making his way back to the stairs, Harry scrambled for something to say but came up blank. “Draco…”
“Believe me Harry, if there were any alternatives, I would. For now, I’m going back to researching muggle methods of dealing with trauma.”
“I should have known. I suppose this is something to do with that plan you accused me of the other night?”
His protest was met with silence as both Seamus and Harry winced, grateful they weren’t in his position.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Ginny was fine. It’s not like her life starts and ends with me you know. She had training, games away most weekends. It probably worked in her favour.”
An awful lot of his time was spent wondering about how his father was handling everything. Draco was concerned most for his mother simply because he cared for her so deeply, but he knew that she had always been strong and knew how to take care of herself. How to take care of all of them. She had gone into the war with one goal: to see her family come out the other side. She had acted on her own conscious decisions to do what she thought was best in the darkest times. Lucius on the other hand had made his choice far too early and started to fall apart as the years went by. While Draco highly doubted his stance on the cause had changed he felt that perhaps his father had started to think that the Dark Lord's measures were too much, too extreme, towards the end. That he had started to realise the grave danger he had placed his family in. It had driven him mad in those final months, realising that he cared a whole lot less about whether they won or lost but instead about his wife and kid, who he had dragged through hell and back for a madman's dream.
Sitting shakily, he took in the scene around him and grimaced. “Sorry about the drinks. I’ll get more, shall I?”
, he thought as he took in the face that stared back at him. Though still slightly emaciated, his face looked brighter and if it weren’t for the haunted depths of his green eyes Harry would almost be convinced that he was perfectly alright.
Harry’s head snapped around to look at the where Draco stood at the top of the carpeted staircase on the opposite side of the room.
Groaning, Harry ran an errant hand through his hair. “Can you not? I don’t want him to think we’re talking about him.”
“I’d best be getting home,” Harry said with a short nod, not wanting to drag this out to the point where Malfoy would regret anything. “See you ‘round, yeah?”
Harry continued to splutter as Andromeda chuckled to his right, patting him gently on the shoulder before wandering the other way to the kitchen.
And then Molly was embracing Draco; what little tension had built instantly left the room, Harry taking in Draco’s apparent shock over her shoulder with a grin. Making the rounds to greet everyone, he kept a watchful eye across the room as Weasley after Weasley gave Draco the same warm welcome they’d extend to any of the family and he felt his heart swell so much he thought it might burst.
Chuckling to himself, Harry made his way through the chaos towards the registers and gave a smile at Chelsea, one of the two Hogwarts-age casual staff he’d put on over Christmas hols. “Mind pulling up the purchase history for my friend here? Peter’s shown you how to do that, yeah?”
Harry snorted. “Maybe because it’s a bit depressing that I’m unemployed and divorced with three kids at the ripe old age of 28?”
“Do you regret it?” His voice was low, the tremble in it only noticeable for how well Harry could read Draco after so many years.
, he thought. Perhaps this was his opening to ask Draco outright and be done with the guessing games for good.
Turning to look at James, Harry was slightly wary of the mischievous look on his son’s face but could see no reason not to let them go. “Er, sure thing. Head to sleep soon though, alright?”
“Lily was… unintentional,” Harry admitted, keeping an eye on Teddy and Nick to make sure they didn’t catch what he was saying. Seeing them staring wide eyed at the angelic lights that hung between buildings, he continued. “I don’t regret it at all, of course. I love Lily more than anything. But we’d decided to divorce right before Ginny got pregnant and then realised it would be better for the family if we kept it quiet until after she was born. Ended up giving Gin a lot more time to talk some sense into me about quitting work as well, among other things.”
“Aside from the obvious, if you don’t mind. What do you think is perhaps causing you to take so much of it?”
There was a stunned silence between them as Harry took in what he’d just said. It wasn’t necessarily untrue, just something he didn’t think he would ever find himself discussing with Draco Malfoy in a London cafe. Chancing a glance at where Draco sat across the table he found the other man staring wide eyed into his lap.
Astoria’s voice came from closer beside him than he previously recalled. “Narcissa likes to decorate. I think it helps keep her focussed, keeps her calm. This will likely be her last year visiting here, so she’s rather outdone herself.”
Cursing, he moved to quickly sit up in the bed and grimaced as his stomach lurched with the motion. Bracing himself on his elbows he let out a heavy sigh and jammed his glasses back onto his face, his unfamiliar surroundings coming into focus. Ron and Hermione were in the far corner of the room by the entrance and an unfamiliar Healer stood opposite his bed, all slightly blurry even with his vision restored. He realised that someone had put up a
“They seem to like it here,” Draco said slowly, head gesturing towards their children in the snow. “Don’t you think?”
“Harry, stop.” Draco had been noticeably silent through most of this, but now he met Harry’s eyes, something in them that made Harry uneasy. Shaking his head gently, Draco sighed. “I think we should go home now.”
Shacklebolt was leading the hearing and his voice—though low in volume—drew everyone to attention. Calling the session to order, shuffling was heard as the crowd presumably settled into their seats.
Harry was at a loss for words, not sure they were both participating in the same conversation. “Just Harry’s fine.”
There were only a few days until Christmas and Harry was in a frantic rush to buy the last of the presents he needed. Auror training had run overtime and now he was cutting it fine to make it back before the end of lunch. Why had he left this until the last minute again?
Draco let out a soft, hollow laugh. “It’s the same reason Astoria was so worried about you ruining our marriage. Why I’ve avoided being alone with you, really.”
“Nick, go home and tell your dad I killed people too, okay? See how he takes that.” At the wide-eyed expressions before him, Harry realised that maybe he was shouting a bit louder than strictly necessary. Dropping his voice, Harry tried to dial it back a bit. “Sorry, don’t tell him that. But just know there’s more to it than what you’re hearing.”
“Tell him. Even if you realise you don’t want anything at all, Potter, just bloody tell him. Make sure you tell him soon and don’t expect him to wait around if you mess it up now, because Merlin knows he’s been waiting a while for you to stop being such a fool.”
“Yeah, yeah, whatever. I’ll …” He sighed, feeling the exhaustion finally hit. “I’ll find out later, I suppose. Home?”
“Two friends who have sex sometimes and are hopelessly in love with one another,” she muttered with a glare in his direction.
“Harry…It’s a harmless Christmas gift exchange.” Hermione frowned at him, an almost pitying look on her face. “I don’t see what about it has to be suspicious.”
As she sipped on her champagne, Ginny looked over Harry’s shoulder. When she looked back to him there was a mischievous glint in her eyes. “You could just walk over there and snog him senseless.”
Teddy wanted to hear stories about the marauders again, of course, and Harry obliged. Moony, Padfoot and Prongs were regular features in the tales he’d told Teddy growing up, and tonight seemed to be bringing about some nostalgia in them all. His eyes met Draco’s every now and then, a depth of emotion in them that had his heart aching. He vowed to do this every year, and said as much in perhaps not so many words.
Harry dropped one hand as he brought the other up through his hair absentmindedly. “She, er. She’s the same. You guys might, er, y’know.”
“Quite the oversimplification,” Draco said even as he conceded Harry’s point with a nod. “But go on.”
The tears were flowing freely now and Harry moved forward to do something to comfort her but Ginny held up her hand as a way to keep him back. Pressing his lips together, Harry focused on breathing until she seemed ready to continue.
The fierce intensity behind Potter’s green eyes as they locked onto Draco’s gaze was mesmerising, all consuming. Draco felt his breath catch as he schooled his expression into the mocking boredom he so desperately strived for.
It had been a long evening at work—Christmas Eve always kept them open late—and Harry was just about ready to collapse when he apparated home. Landing on the top step, he turned left towards the door before doing a double take at what he saw in his peripheral.
Ron snorted to her left, and Harry felt Draco relax slightly, shoulders dropping as he picked up his glass with shaky hands and took a drink.
Harry moved his queen across the board, taking out one of Draco’s knights in the process. “Not really.”
With a growl, Harry cut him off. “Merlin, do you know what it’s been like for me? You ignore me for years, keeping communication to the absolute bare minimum, and then out of fucking nowhere,” he said, hands tearing at his hair as he began to pace. “You tell me you’re getting a divorce at some point in the future, but you don’t know when! And you can’t talk to me anyway, and then you finally get your divorce and just… Don’t tell me because you are stupid enough to think that me respecting your wishes to not communicate is me no longer being interested?” Stopping to turn and look at Draco, Harry sighed, shoulders slumping. “I bloody wish I wasn’t interested, Draco, because you’ve been a right piece of work for years now.”
“The Muggle-born was in the library and asked Kreacher why he was being here so late instead of at Hogwarts like Kreacher is meant to be when Master doesn’t need food. Kreacher is not knowing he isn’t telling Muggle-born about Master. Master told Kreacher to talk to the Muggle-born girl more after he got home from St Mungo’s last week.”
Daring a glance back at Draco, he was glad to see the blonde looking amused rather than annoyed for his inattention. He smiled, before clearing his throat. “So, France?”
next to Ron and Hermione in the corner farthest from the kitchen and closest to the Christmas tree. Names were called, presents were delegated and time passed in a blurry haze. It wasn’t until he heard his name that he looked up from the bottom of the eggnog he was nursing that Harry dared chance a glance across the room and met Pansy’s disappointed glare that he realised Draco was no longer there. He caught the slightest glimpse of blonde in his peripheral and turned to see Draco making his way through to the kitchen and saw the perfect opportunity to corner him under the pretence of refilling his drink.
“So this is the old Black house? Looks a lot brighter than I remember, though it has been a few decades.”
“I can’t. But I do know that it’s been a bloody long time now, and while we can’t predict the future, I’d say it’s a pretty good indicator of how things might go.”
Taking a quick look around them to make sure nobody was paying attention, Harry cast a quick cushioning charm on Teddy and Nick before turning back to Draco, gesturing towards a low brick fence by the roadside. “They’ll be supervised enough in there for a few minutes. I just wanted to spend more than two seconds outside without the threat of getting a snowball to the face.”
“Yeah, mate. Wish I could have made it.” Harry gestured to the cluttered space around him with an apologetic smile. “Christmas just seems to be a different breed of beast for the shop, you know?”
Humming something he vaguely recalled being played at last week’s celebratory gala, Harry fished a white crewneck out from under his bed and shouted in triumph as a clean-looking pair of white socks appeared beneath it. Placing them on top of his dresser he silently thanked Kreacher’s love of cleaning as he noticed the thick layer of dust buildup beside them.
Children seemed to be everywhere he looked today. Victoire and Dominique were fighting over toys in the corner, Teddy wouldn’t stop accosting unsuspecting adults as they exited the kitchen and Lucy was slowly dragging herself along the floor while Percy sat behind her picking up toys as she dropped them. He assumed Fleur had taken Louis home to nap when she left after lunch; Bill was keeping an eye on their other children and would be taking Teddy with them for the night when he finally departed.
After what felt like an eternity there was a tapping at the window and Harry jumped to his feet so fast he felt something tighten in his back, opting to ignore the pain in favour of letting the owl back inside.
actually approve of and accept him—the irony of Draco needing the Weasley’s approval not lost on him—and breathed a sigh of relief when he finally came around to the idea that the conflict had centred around Percy’s wankerish behaviour rather than a decades-brewed mistrust in him personally.
“How is Lee, anyway?” Harry asked as he leaned on the countertop. “Still planning to be on the continent for the next few weeks?”
“Honestly, I’m not sure if we’re good at this marriage thing. Hermione keeps saying she thinks we’re too good at it, would you believe?”
With an earsplitting grin, Harry watched as Draco left the room and tried not to dwell on the warmth spreading through him.
Andromeda’s words brought Harry back to the room they were in and he gave her a soft smile. “Yeah, I do.” Turning back to where Malfoy stood, he nodded. “Merry Christmas, Malfoy.”
Working his fingers back into the knots of Harry’s shoulders, Draco continued softly. “You said you didn’t mind if we never got married. That you’d understand if it would be too much attention for scorpius, because even after all my years of stupidity—”
“I’ve been… Scared to come here. Too much happened, y’know?” He kicked at the carpet with the front of a scuffed trainer, keeping his eyes down. “Then I saw that you were here all the time. How?”
“I am no stranger to the effects of certain stimulants, Miss Granger. Even the most basic vital spells have shown that Harry has taken multiple in excess as of late. That being said, my concern lies more in the motive behind his actions than the damage he has done at this stage.”
Was it possible that—no. Hell would freeze over sooner than Malfoy having genuine interest in him…and it wasn’t like he cared, was it? Sure, the git was nice to look at… Perhaps not that bad to talk to, if everyone else was to be believed. Got under Harry’s skin like nothing else, though whether that was a good thing or not Harry couldn’t be sure. He groaned, head falling into his hands as he leaned on the dark table.
“Hmm.” Draco tilted his head, a puzzled look on his face. “You’re more of a kneazle person than a crup person then, I take it?”
Harry paused, eyes falling on where Fortescue’s used to be. Barely aware of the tides of people flowing past him, it felt as if time stood still as his mind was transported back to so many summers ago, when that shop had been a safe haven for him. A sadness spread through him, chest tightening as he turned away and boxed his emotions up for a later moment. Now was not the time for sentimental memories. Pushing on, he was passing the entrance to Eeylops Owl Emporium when he heard shouts coming from inside and couldn’t help lingering to listen in on the gruff tones that were rapidly rising in volume.
Seeing Draco at King’s Cross earlier that year had ripped a hole in Harry’s heart once more; it was the briefest of moments that they made eye contact and yet his entire body ached with the weight of what they’d been through. The experience confirmed two things he knew for certain: that he was irrevocably in love with Draco Malfoy, and that he deserved a lot better than what he’d dealt with over the past few years.
Waving the hand that wasn’t holding her wine, Astoria smiled. “Forgive me for reading between the lines. Now, promise me that you’ll continue to pester my husband so I can go save him from William in good conscience?”
A crease appeared between Draco’s brows. “You made it quite clear where you stood when it came to us. I didn’t think there was any point.”
Unfortunately, that plan was ruined by Luna handing him a present and instructing him to open the Secret Santa gift immediately.
Harry gulped nervously, hating the way she wouldn’t meet his eyes now. He had done this to them. “What do you want to—what should we do?”
Draco remembered flashes that he knew were real. Obviously he wasn't going out of his way to recall those horrible long months filled with fear and tension. They just struck him when he was unsuspecting. A smell, sound, certain phrase that fell from the guard's mouths in their casual conversations through the halls; it didn't take a lot to suck the breath from his lungs and draw his mind into a dark place. The dreams hadn't stopped, not yet. He didn't truly think they ever would. Some things just shouldn't be experienced in a wizard's life and even if he had been allowed his wand in the cell, he was yet to find a spell to take the feeling away. He would wake drenched in his own sweat, twisted in the ragged sheets with the feeling of a trapped scream in his throat, begging to be let loose. Not knowing how to take it all away, how to make it all better. Sometimes he worried that his parents were facing the same problems that he was. That they got trapped inside their minds, with no idea of how to escape.
With an exasperated sigh, Harry led the way outside and heard the second set of footsteps a few beats behind him. He continued to march until they were in the street and a few houses down from Andromeda’s, hopefully not visible from any of the windows. Turning around to level Draco with a look that hopefully conveyed just how unimpressed he was, Harry decided that now was not the time to let the other man dwell on his past mistakes.
Harry laughed, shaking his head. He took a step closer and upon realising that Draco didn’t seem to be trying to run this time, he took a few more until he had Draco backed up against the wall.
“Our bodies are sturdy things, Miss Granger, despite how fragile they sometimes appear. A few weeks of misuse will not have impacted your friend’s heart beyond the point of no repair, indeed in the case of most wizards his age it should only take a few days to bounce back to normal levels of function.”
Shifting awkwardly between his feet, Draco nodded slowly. “I am. It’ll be better for both of us, and our child.”
Though he hadn’t meant it to sound so nervous, his voice was still infinitely calmer than he felt inside. Sucking up every ounce of courage he had, Harry kept his chin up defiantly and met Malfoy’s quizzical gaze head on, refusing to back down or look away.
Harry watched over Ron’s shoulder as Hermione’s jaw set in a firm line as her nostrils flared. “He will, but that’s hardly the point. You saw what happened in there. He’s clearly—”
Harry smiled into her hair, blaming the Firewhiskey for how emotional he was feeling. “Thanks, ‘Mione. Love you too.”
Connecting the dots, Draco raised an eyebrow in Harry’s direction. “She’s also related to me, you idiot.”
“Please,” Harry whispered, voice breaking as he watched Draco turn on himself and disappear with a loud
So occupied were his thoughts as he relished in the delight he drew from this park that Harry almost didn’t notice the man standing partly obscured by the giant Christmas tree at first. It wasn’t until he heard an uncertain yet familiar voice calling out his name that his movements halted, turning his head to the right to see a familiar blonde regarding him with guarded curiosity.
“Oh, Salazar. Now he looks like he’s been stunned. Potter, I cannot stand here with you being a blithering idiot any longer. I’m sick of it, you hear me? Absolutely pathetic, the lot of you. You’ve clearly had some kind of breakthrough tonight, that much was obvious. Do something about it so the rest of us can regain our sanity, please. Please. Do you hear that? I am literally begging you, and Parkinsons don’t beg.”
There was none of the mockery or sarcasm he’d expected from Potter and perhaps that was what led Draco to be so honest in his answer. Whatever it was, his guard finally dropped enough to feel the desperation surrounding them, a longing for connection, to be understood. He was too far gone to know if it was projecting from him or Potter, possibly both.
“You could start by telling Kreacher you’ll do your own cleaning,” she said as she handed the crisply-pressed robes back to him.
Turning on his heel and heading in the direction of home, Harry smiled as he heard the soft goodbye said behind him before the telltale crack of apparition sounded.
“No, thanks Kreacher.” Harry waved a hand in the elf’s direction as he heard the familiar crack signalling his departure.
He curled in on himself once more, the fire within his veins dulling as a stray tear rolled out of his right eye and found its way to the cold floor. How he longed for a confidante. Someone to discuss this with, like he had with his fellow Slytherins so many times before everything had headed South in sixth year. Draco tried and failed not to think about how much he wanted his mother right now. She may have been blinded, perhaps simply biased, but she had always been good at imparting words of wisdom and making Draco feel loved. He tried not to think too deeply into what she’d allowed to happen under their roof and instead focused on the younger years, time spent wandering the Manor gardens and halls together as he grew up.
“One of us has to be,” she mumbled into the front of his sweater. “Merlin knows it isn’t you. Wanna talk about it?”
“No need to be so dramatic about it,” Draco grumbled. “Or is this the part that’s too much for you?”
“Shut up!” Harry stage whispered as he glanced around them, seeing people starting to turn their way. “This is serious.”
Both their heads turned at the clearing throat that sounded. Andromeda stood leaning against the doorway, soft smile on her lips and crinkling lines beside her knowing eyes.
“Don’t be stupid. I know you loved me every bit as I loved you, and we will always have this. I just also see that Malfoy has held your interest for far longer than you’re willing to admit, in ways you probably overlooked back then.”
They both paused as a waitress placed their steaming beverages before them. Harry grinned as he saw that the mugs matched the festive decor, looking like hollowed out upside-down Santas with handles attached to their sides. Rolling his eyes, Draco thanked the waitress before looking back at Harry.
“That wasn’t your fault,” Harry heard Hermione whispering to Draco. “George hasn’t quite gotten past the loss and Percy… Well, Percy’s an arse.”
Her bluntness was what stopped the lie on Harry’s lips. Faltering, he instead looked down at his hands where they rested in his lap and took a deep breath. “I’m not sure. I didn’t feel the magic happening.”
“Not at all. We were just leaving,” Ginny said as she grabbed Harry’s arm and gestured towards the front door with her head.
Taking her in as she stood before him he noticed how weary she looked; the light he used to see in her eyes seemed dulled, understandable from everything that had happened the last few years.
“Would anybody like some tea? Or there’s some pumpkin juice, or I suppose we could start on the mulled wine you’re—”
Sighing, Astoria glanced towards her husband before leaning in closer to Harry to speak. “Because neither of you wants to be publicly outed in your affections, and yet there’s too much history to be discussed before you can be within speaking distance of one another without addressing it?”
Cursing his awkward offer, Harry shifted from side to side as Malfoy stared at him like he’d gone mad. Perhaps he had. That would certainly be a better explanation than anything else his brain could come up with for his sudden want to assist Draco sodding Malfoy as he shopped for an owl. Looking down at his feet to spare himself the humiliation of being looked at as if he had grown an extra head, Harry was taken aback to hear a quiet
Choosing to simply grin and continue through to where everyone was gathered inside, Harry appreciated the bright colours and slightly unorthodox decorations. He told himself that was all he was looking for as he scoured the rooms he passed, rather than admit to himself just how desperately he was seeking a certain blonde.
She ushered them both out of the room promptly before anything more could be said on the matter, ignoring all of Hermione’s protests and Ron’s face as he tried to send Harry what was likely meant to be a reassuring look but instead looked like he was about to vomit slugs again. Drawing her wand, Healer Benson tapped on the door a few times to ensure it remained closed before turning back to face Harry.
“What?” Now Hermione was determinedly not making eye contact with him. “Normal isn’t something I’m used to, remember?”
Ginny spun quickly back around to face him, her hair following her gracefully and settling over one shoulder to hang across the side of her face. Brushing it back, she locked eyes with him and he saw it: though the pain and fighting of the recent past were evident, there was still that fire burning behind them and he almost flinched away, not knowing what to make of it. Harry brought a hand through his hair absentmindedly and pressed his lips together as he tried not to break the stare, knowing she needed this right now, possibly more than he did.
hello most of these chapters are being posted at 6am immediately after writing them in the early hours with very little editing done .... so i shall be going back to edit this story properly in january!
“They really bowed?” Ron asked, eyes wide with shock. “You must be joking, mate. That’s a nightmare.”
“You don’t have to do what I say.” With a pointed look, she shrugged at him. “Anyway, it’s not like you’ve ever listened to me where Malfoy’s concerned.”
Letting out a shocked burst of laughter, Harry saw the boys turn back to look at them. Shaking his head and giving them a thumbs up as he continued to chuckle, he glanced sideways to see Draco looking thoroughly pleased with himself. “Muggles, actually.”
“Sounds like another Malfoy child I once knew,” Harry teased. “He’ll be same year at Hogwarts as Albus, actually.”
“Al, if you throw one more at Lily while she’s on the ground I’ll leave you at home next time!” Harry called out, shoving Draco lightly as he laughed beside him. Turning to look at him, Harry smiled. “They seem to be enjoying themselves. Even James,” he added with a laugh. “I was worried he would kick up a fuss.”
“Master seems to be overreacting,” Kreacher muttered. “Does Master require anything else from Kreacher?”
Refusing to give in to the bile he felt rising in his throat, Draco took a few more steps towards the far wall. Keeping his gaze on the beige-tan-sand-had-once-been-white wool on his feet, he slowly made his way until he reached the pile of fabric that appeared to be his sleeping arrangements. This fabric also lacked a definitive colour, looking ragged and worn thin in so many places he doubted it would last the entirety of his stay. He had never seen something so clearly in need of replacing, despite his parents’ employing multiple house elves who dressed in rags and attending school with the Weasleys.
Nodding, Albus shovelled a forkful of potato into his mouth, spraying pieces everywhere as he spoke. “Well, he wasn’t supposed to say anything, because they’re not doing the… what’s the thing they have to do? There’s some fancy word for it. Paper stuff.” Waiting for an answer that never came, he shrugged. “They’re gonna do it while he’s home so that there won’t be lots of kids reading about it at school while he’s there. But he told me because we’re friends,” Albus finished, sticking his chest out proudly.
This should have been better. This shouldn’t have been such a struggle for him, honestly. He had been fighting his whole damn life to beat the bad guy and now the battle was won… So why did he felt like his entire identity had died with Voldemort?
Hermione snorted, flicking her wrist to add more tinsel to the tree in question. “Like she doesn’t know her ex-husband is more partial to men.”
Barely having the chance to blink before Hermione’s wand was out, Harry froze in shock for all of two seconds before doubling over in peals of laughter again. “Did you just…charm my…bloody tree…gay?” He was wheezing, not making a sound as air came silently into his laughing mouth between broken words. “What am I going to tell Ginny?”
“It’s fine, really.” It was a lie—he was still in agonising pain—but Harry really didn’t want to leave the house. “It’s pretty much gone now.”
Harry grumbled into his eggnog, taking a long sip as he ignored Malfoy’s chuckle across from him. Maybe ignored was the wrong word for what he was doing; the sound was carefree, genuine, something Harry had yet to really appreciate from the blonde, so he refused to respond but instead let it play over in his mind for a while before resting his glass atop his knee.
“My sister died because of him.” The man continued, oblivious to Harry’s warning as the crazed gestures sped up and his face became a deeper shade of puce. “He cannot just walk free! You must help me show him justice, I beg of you.”
Malfoy frowned for a moment before realising the joke for what it was. Harry watched as he tried to mask his laugh with a cough, turning his face away.
,” Dean moaned. “I mean, I know we see her most weeks and she’s not the absolute worst anymore. But what the Hell am I supposed to get her?”
“I’m just saying that maybe you should figure out if you’re happy with how you’re living your life now. If you are, and you definitely seem to be lately… Well, it’s hardly a waste of time to keep doing what you’re doing and either waiting out whatever he’s working through, or seeing what direction your life takes without him.” She paused, biting her lip as she glanced over at their three children before looking back to where he sat, watching. “Unless you’re unhappy, in which case I don’t know what else to say.”
Harry didn’t like the sound of that but chose not to push the subject, knowing when to take the win. He put the horribly cheesy positivity posters and harshly lit rooms of the psychological rehab facility out of his mind and instead focused on the warm air around them. It was a rare sunny day and Harry had to acknowledge that perhaps being outside wasn’t the worst thing for him right now; Hermione may have been on to something when she insisted that they walk back to the Ministry.
“Perhaps stupid isn’t the correct word in this instance.” She smiled at him, the kind of smile that gave the impression that her friendly nature could become something darker in a heartbeat if you wronged her. “Though I did warn him that you were likely to come barging in. I expected the front door, if we’re being perfectly candid.”
What a miserable thought. Actually, what a miserable life. There was no point in pretending otherwise at this stage: Draco had long ago given up on the glamorous, exciting life as Malfoy heir that he had been promised as a young boy. What was once a title he revelled in boasting was now a trait that he wished he could run away from, a painful reminder of childhood dreams lay by the wayside. Surely it was better to have given up on a dream than on his life? He had given up all hope of survival in the past year, sure that his end was inevitable in the war or its aftermath, though unsure of the exact timeline. He wanted to be thankful for evading death for a while longer, yet being stuck with no company but his own thoughts for the next few years made him almost wish for it.
He squeezed his eyes closed and imagined the fireplace in his room back at the Manor. No, that wouldn’t do. Too much had happened in that room and he… Well, that just wasn’t going to keep him warm right now.
Harry called after him as he watched Malfoy rise from the table and start off down the hallway towards the front door. Cursing, he jumped up and hurried after him, managing to catch him as he made it through to the front stairs.
Ron gave Harry a nervous smile and shrugged, clearly glad that the air around them was moving freer now. He stepped forward to embrace Hermione and mouthed an apology at Harry over her shoulder before gesturing towards the floo exits. “I’ll let you deal with that, then. I’m headed home. Don’t forget lunch tomorrow!”
With a bitter laugh Harry leaned forward and put his elbows on the table, aware of how close this brought him to Draco. “How do I even bring that up though? Hey, Gin. How was your day? I saw Draco. Wondered if we’re actually in love.”
The fact that he was here tonight, in a set of dress robes he’d let Ginny pick out and making small talk with various heads of department was not lost on him. In taking time to learn what he wanted to do with his life, finding his feet in the new venture and ultimately needing to schmooze the who’s who of the Ministry, Harry had come full circle.
And now he was meant to be happy. He was supposed to be showing up day in and day out at the Ministry to boost public morale and remind the world that it was all over and he was sick of it. He felt like Scrimgeour was running the place again; he was being used as a puppet, and he didn’t even know who was pulling the strings. All Harry knew was that he was burning out really fast, and he wasn’t sure how long he had left before it was all too much.
Hermione quietened at Healer Benson’s raised hand, chewing on her bottom lip as she wrung her hands in what seemed to be an effort to distract herself from telling the healer what she knew.
Pansy’s words echoed through his mind again as he stood, watching Malfoy stand vulnerably before him. “No. I meant what I said, it’s just been a long day. Christmas Eve and all. Come inside for a drink?”
“Well, the story goes that if your cracker breaks normally—one person gets a side, the other person doesn’t—then the colour of the fireworks shows how successful the partnership will be. But then if there are fireworks and the cracker doesn’t break at all, it’s a cursed marriage. The fireworks for those are always dark, usually a black or red through them. Means someone’s going to die.”
“Master Harry looks much better!” Kreacher exclaimed, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet. “Kreacher will be back to clean while Master is gone.”
Seamus laughed, taking a swig of his ale as he thumped Dean on the back. “You’ll be ‘right. Just you wait and see.”
“What if for once in our lives, we stopped thinking about what would happen later and just enjoyed ourselves?”
Harry looked up from where he’d been directing a fond glare at Hermione when he heard Arthur’s excited announcement. Still wearing the Santa outfit he’d given out gifts in earlier, his face was alight with the something akin to the fascination of when he’d finally understood the mechanics of electricity. Spotting him and Hermione, Arthur waved with his spare hand and made a beeline for the couch they occupied.
Draco tugged at his shirt and brought him back so that their lips were pressing against each other once more, mouths warm and inviting. How long they stayed there neither could say, kiss growing more confident as tongues explored mouths, ranging from tender, slow and explorative to rough, heated and needy. It wasn’t until they heard a cheer behind them that the two pulled apart, turning to see their friends standing in the doorway with grins across their faces.
It was a series of conflicting emotions that ran through Draco's body as he accepted his fate for the foreseeable future. He knew that Azkaban was a horrible place, one that he shouldn't be happy to be imprisoned in.
“You’re lucky I find your oblivious nature charming,” Draco muttered, giving a squeeze to the shoulder his other hand still rested on. “As I was saying before you so rudely interrupted me, I love so many things about you, and despite all of the reasons we’ve given one another over the years for this not to work… Well, against all odds, you may just be the best thing to ever happen to me. I’m sorry I was such a stubborn fool for so many years, and now that we’re past that, I hope you’ll agree to tolerate me for many more. As my husband,” he added nervously, mouth seeming to trip over the words. “Harry James Potter, will you marry me?”
Keeping them closed, Draco relaxed his eyes slightly to take the pressure off and try alleviate the tears that were threatening to flow.
“Walk with me then?” Looking around as if to remind Draco of their current audience, Harry dropped his voice even lower. “We can’t have this conversation here,”
“Wouldn’t think of missing it,” Harry called over his shoulder as he manoeuvred between the stacked boxes, grinning from ear to ear.
Crossing his arms, Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco. “You’re not making a good argument against this. You can’t just kiss me and then tell me it’s a bad idea!”
Particularly with his mind’s current offering - that Potter was the reason he had now twice evaded death this past month. This was definitely going to be a long sentence.
They made their way back out of the kitchen, Harry pausing briefly in the doorway in an attempt to wave goodbye to Teddy and Andromeda. He realised the mistake as soon as he locked eyes with Draco and saw something akin to panic crossing the blonde’s face.
“Glad to hear it,” he said as he pasted a smile on his face. “I’m not looking forward to sleeping, but I guess if that’ll fix it…”
i know ginny/harry isn't everyone's cup of tea (and this is definitely a drarry story!) but i am sticking to epilogue compliance so we've got ourselves a lily luna on the way. this will be the final ginny/harry relationship chapter though - i'm keeping her around though, i love supportive friend ginny! the epilogue did not do justice for what the two of them could have had as friends 😭
“I’m not sure. I just don’t know if this is what we both had in mind. I’m happy, I do love her, I just… Sorry, I’m rambling.”
“—and look how you’ve turned out,” Draco muttered as he rolled his eyes. “Oh well, if it gives you some peace of mind and buys us a few more minutes outside, who am I to complain?”
Cursing himself for how small he both sounded and felt, Draco picked up the end of his scarf and started tugging at a thread to avoid Harry’s gaze. It wasn’t that he’d been hoping Harry would tell him he was the same, or that it didn’t matter because he loved him anyway, no. Those feelings could die in Fiendfyre for all he cared.
It wasn’t the kind of kiss that shattered the earth or ruined a person, though in truth Draco had ruined him long ago. No, that kiss would come later, when they were away from prying eyes and the winter cold. This was short, sweet and had the corners of Harry’s mouth pulling up in a smile even before they’d pulled away from one another.
“Maybe I’m just lonely. You could be on to something about this just being my stupid Malfoy obsession all over again. I am quite bored without the Aurors; there’s only so many times I can reread
“Draco…” Harry gave up at the blonde’s expression. “Fine. Tell me something you’ve done since I last saw you.”
Determined to put on a brave face for both of them, Harry stepped forward and embraced Molly, eyes locking with Ron’s over her shoulder; he gave a thumbs up and grin of encouragement. Hermione stood beside him, looking behind Harry where he presumed his boyfriend was still standing. Heartbeat seeming to echo in the silence around them, Harry stepped back with his hands still on Molly’s shoulders, encouraging smile on his face as he watched her eyes flit between him and Draco behind him. He held his breath almost on instinct, despite knowing—hoping—that his family would accept Draco in all the ways he needed them to.
Hermione was looking back and forth between the two of them and Harry pointedly avoided looking her way, knowing she likely remembered him asking her about them earlier this year. He’d given up any hope of understanding what transpired that day after he realised Draco wasn’t going to write anyway and it seemed like a dead end when Hermione hadn’t been able to find anything. If he’d realised they were a pureblood thing sooner… Well, Arthur Weasley still probably wasn’t the first person he’d have asked.
“Hey!” Harry shouted, drawing strange looks from some of the people in line. Dropping his voice, he instead opted to glare across the table. “I take offence to that. Dumbledore would have loved it.”
The only mention he’d seen of Draco that year was the word the papers brought. There hadn’t been much—not for lack of searching, he’d practically torn the
“I know. I saw you leave the pub.” Shifting awkwardly in the hallway, Malfoy grimaced. “If you’d prefer I ignored the invitation, I can leave.”
Though Draco refused to look up at this point, he could feel the gazes of the witches and wizards fixating back on where he was seated in the middle of the room.
He lay down on his bed and closed his eyes, trying to calm his breathing. The thought of actually having something physically wrong was stressing him out and Harry didn’t think that would help him avoid the problem. He sat and tried to focus on happy memories because he didn’t really know what else to do. After what seemed like a lifetime but was probably only a few moments the pain seemed to ease to a dull ache and he breathed a sigh of relief.
we are on the home stretch now! only the tiniest bit more ~angsty times~ to go through, but it's mostly domestic fluff from this point onwards.
“That’s when I was worried you were just curious." Draco hesitated, meeting Harry's eyes uncertainly. "I think we've too much history for that to have ended well.”
Harry heard the overly nonchalant tone his voice took, saw the tells he wouldn’t have noticed a few years earlier. It filled him with hope but also scared him to death. “We’re good… I think.”
There was a stunned pause around the table as Harry’s Butterbeer sprayed the potatoes in front of him, the shock sending it out of his mouth as quickly as it had gone in. “Scorpius Malfoy?”
“Gin…” He shared a look with her, heart aching as he saw the concern in her eyes. “Give us a minute.”
Harry turned, coming face to face with Astoria as expected. He tried to smile as he watched her eyes rake over him, but it seemed like a tight grimace was all that his face was capable of.
Hermione let out a sharp laugh causing both Harry and Ron to flinch, having heard it many a time before. This was the
After a moment’s pause Harry chanced a glance at Malfoy again, his expression unreadable. With a sigh, Harry ran a hand carelessly through his hair as he thought of how to bring back the mood of a few moments earlier.
Rewarded with a forgiving smile, Draco warmed as he watched Harry settle back against his seat before attempting to prove his point once more.
“Muggle?” Harry felt slightly crestfallen but tried not to let it show. “So these aren’t the crackers that set off fireworks?”
“Harry,” she sighed. “You love him. Anyone can see it, and while I appreciate you trying to be delicate—”
He could feel it answered in the fingertips that had slipped under his shirt gripping so tight that he could feel the bruises forming, the soft sigh of his name turned moan that was swallowed between them.
Pouting, Harry took a glass of wine from the tray and sent a glare at Ginny. “You make it sound as if I’ve got a laundry list of plans to win Draco back.”
Harry nodded, cautious smile on his face. “I didn’t really understand what they did though. Are they supposed to mean something?”
“It’s going to be fine. You’ve seen Hermione at work plenty of times now, we’ve had dinner with her and Ron, Ginny will be there to support us—”
“I do want to see you! I just didn’t know what to…” He trailed off, and he knew from the look in her eyes that she already knew what he was about to say.
“I know you said it’s not serious,” Hermione said, her cautious voice warning Harry that she was about to say something she knew he mightn’t like. “But I also know how much you’ve wanted this. Don’t let things go on like this too long without making sure he’s ready for all the things that come with dating you, Harry. At some point he will have to forgive himself.”
Pouting into his lager, Harry was grateful when Ginny took the hint and changed the topic, only half listening as she went on to excitedly tell him about how happy Coach was with the new broom order. He knew he ought to be paying closer attention—it was his products she was chattering away about, after all—but he couldn’t drag his thoughts away from the blonde across the bar.
“You can’t be serious.” She raised an eyebrow and upon realising that he didn’t have more to say, continued. “You keep making time to come here to see Ron! I know you’re at the Ministry a lot but I’m there too sometimes! It’s not hard to come see me, Harry. You just don’t want to.”
Sharing a grateful look with Hermione, Harry patted her gently on the shoulder before leaving to make the rounds and saying goodbye to the rest of the Weasley clan. Retrieving their things from where they’d ended up, Harry helped his wife and child through the floo and stepped through to their home waiting on the other side.
Which left Harry here. Alone in his cubicle—probably alone in the office, everyone was at lunch—and infuriatingly confused by the actions of one Draco Malfoy. Without taking a second to stop and think about the repercussions Harry decided he’d had more than enough of this; work could manage without him pushing paper for the afternoon. Taking off his Auror robes and shrinking them down as he made his way to the elevators, he felt the familiar rage beginning to build under the surface of his skin as he marvelled at the audacity of Draco blowing him off like this for the foreseeable future. What in Merlin’s name did the prick think he was playing at?
The echo of a scream dying in his throat as he came to, Harry’s first observation was that everything smelled abnormally clean and the harsh whites of the room around him stung his eyes as they adjusted. His hair was plastered across his forehead and the lenses over his eyes were fogged up from the heat he was radiating. Removing his glasses to rub against where they pressed into the bridge of his nose he berated himself for falling leaving them on as he slept and then it struck him: he hadn’t done it intentionally. No, he hadn’t meant to fall asleep at all.
He shook his head, then brushed a hand through his hair as he looked up at her once more. “I’ll feel shit either way. Malfoy goes to Azkaban, my fault. Malfoy walks free, my fault.”
“I am going to finish this godawful drink,” Ginny said as she grabbed her glass from the table in front of her and finished its contents. “That was truly foul.”
“I guess we’ll have to work on changing that then,” he said tentatively, “starting with keeping this Christmas lights tradition. Think we can manage that much?" At Draco's barely perceptible nod, Harry grinned before making to catch up with the boys before they crossed the road ahead. "There’s no rush, Draco.”
Tonight had started out no different to any other before it. It was a long walk up from the dungeons but Draco relished in the thought of moving his legs these days; staying in one place for too long made him antsy and he didn’t have the patience to deal with himself when he was more often than not his only company. Portraits stirred as he passed—though the final battle was months behind them, the anticipatory tension never seemed to leave their frames—but none seemed to rouse fully until he got closer to where someone seemed to be pacing back and forth at the base of the stairs ahead. Draco paused, hiding in the shadows beside a suit of armour before realising who he was watching. Did Potter really have to occupy every one of his waking hours?
“Mmm,” Ginny said as she stepped back and folded her arms across her chest. “I suppose you didn’t do anything to provoke that, right?”
His heart threatened to escape his ribcage as Potter extended his hand, like Draco had done in this castle so many years ago.
He trailed off as Draco reached the top of the staircase and left his sights without so much as a backward glance. It was only that broken syllable playing on repeat that kept Harry from chasing after him, demanding answers. Needing something, anything.
Unsure how true that statement was anymore, Draco cast his mind back to the months before Christmas. Harry was right. There was nobody left to impress, no barriers left to break.
The familiar shout came from the front of the shop and Harry looked up from where he’d been unloading the latest delivery of polishing kits to see Seamus in the doorway, grinning from ear to ear.
while he had some peace and quiet. As the kettle boiled, he looked out the window at Edington and felt a warm sense of
“No, no. You say Ginny’s a super mum? What about you some day, when you're parenting and still managing to revolutionise laws and change the wizarding world? I can hardly see you giving that up when you decide to have kids.”
Astoria laughed softly before murmuring, too low for Draco’s ears. “Oh, you really are as oblivious as he says.”
Looking between the two of them, Harry sighed, signalling to the nearby waiter to swap out his glass. This was almost more exhausting than navigating the minefield that was Draco Malfoy, and considering the trials and tribulations Harry had faced in his life, that was saying something.
“Besides, after facing the press more times than I care to remember this year… What’s a den of Weasleys?”
Hearing the finality in his words, Harry paused, wheels spinning in his head. There was no doubt in his mind that living with Draco was what he wanted, but the Manor hadn’t been quite what he’d envisioned for them. Could he live in a residence that held so much darkness in its past?
She looked him, pressing her lips together in a sad smile. “Malfoy’s probably not about to make any immediate decisions either.”
Standing, he looked back to her and watched her turn on her heel and lead the way out into the garden. He followed hastily, almost tripping over his feet as he stepped out from the chair and gulped, trying to remind himself that everything was going to work out just fine. They didn’t have to make any big decisions today. He didn’t think either of them were really ready for that yet.
“It’s embarrassing to say aloud,” he admitted in a low voice as he glanced ahead, probably to check that the children weren’t listening. “But I was worried that you were just bored in your marriage and wanted to experiment. Or even that… well, it’s not really important. I guess I’m glad to hear you put more thought into it than that.”
“You mean the colours?” At Harry’s hesitant nod, Arthur launched into explanation mode, complete with exaggerated hand gestures and frantic eye movements. “Well, they were charmed by one of the older wizarding families back when arranged marriages were common among all magic folk. Mol and I are among the last generation to have used them. The colours showed how good a partnership the witch and wizard would be, with red being a warning and green being the best match. If I remember correctly, it was charmed so that the witch would always get the larger side of the cracker when it broke.”
“Harry.” Draco cast a look around them, letting out a shaky exhale. “Please. It’s not just you who’s married.”
“Probably not, yeah.” Harry waited a few moments for the answer that didn’t come. “Are you going to tell me?”
“Wait.” Harry thought back to forth year and realised maybe he had an answer, after all. “If I take Dreamless Sleep at night I won’t need Wideye anymore, right?”
Green eyes met his once more as Harry looked up from underneath dark lashes. “All of it, Draco. All of you.
“Er, excuse me.” Sharing a look with Ron, Harry was glad to know he wasn’t the only one completely lost. “What would do me good?”
It was Hermione pulling the other end of the cracker he’d been handed that snapped him out of his reminiscing on Draco’s fleeting smile last Christmas. He mouthed a
“I honestly don’t know why I bother,” she muttered as she turned on her heels and stalked off towards the apparition point outside the hospital.
“Bet he can’t think of what to get his person,” said Seamus. “What’d you end up with anyway? It’s a Slytherin, ain’t it?”
“Oh.” Harry was stumped for words now, civil conversation still feeling like uncharted waters. “Er, that still doesn’t explain what you do all the time. Dating can’t be all of it?”
“Spending a decade in denial will do that to you.” Laughing, she shook her head at him fondly. “Probably longer if we’re being perfectly honest.”
Ginny shrugged. “At least as long as we’ve been talking about him then. Might as well be an hour for the amount you’ve ignored every word I’ve said, while panicking about being in the same room as him.”
Shaking his head as he looked away from Draco’s angry stare, Harry sighed. “So you don’t want this?”
He slammed the glass down with more force than was necessary. “What’s with everyone calling me stupid lately?”
Harry leaned forward, their lips so close now they were almost brushing. “No, not really. A lot longer than I had realised, apparently.”
Closing his eyes, he allowed himself a moment to simply enjoy the feeling of stillness he felt. It had been far too long since he’d allowed himself to stretch out properly in his bed and despite the bustle of noises and too-stiff sheets beneath him, Harry felt almost at peace for a moment. He took a deep breath which gave way to a yawn and smiled softly as his eyelids grew heavier with every passing moment. Solitude seemed sweeter when he wasn’t battling his tired mind alone in his room at Grimmauld. Here at least Harry knew he was too surrounded to let any sleep come from this.
Feeling giddy with festive spirit and warm with appreciation for how far they’d come, Harry ordered a matching drink and echoed Draco’s soft smile.
She tipped her head back further in his lap, sending a pointed look up at him. “Yes, well. Ron was smart enough to drop out of the Aurors so I can actually afford to continue doing good.”
Shrugging, Ginny leaned back in her chair. “I mean, he told you to stay away until we figured things out, didn’t he?” At Harry’s confirming nod, she continued. “I’m not saying it would change anything. I’m not saying you should do anything. I just want you to know that if you’d been more upfront with yourself and everyone else about how you felt earlier on you would have lived a very different life.”
“Er…” Was all Harry managed before the rainbow appeared above him once more and resumed its intricate movement patterns. Again, his eyes were drawn to the tight gold tangle and he realised with a sinking feeling in his chest where he had seen such unforgiving golden colours before: in most of Voldemort’s horcruxes. A shiver ran down his spine as he tried to tear his gaze away but the slowly moving pulsation of the colour captivated him entirely.
Drawing his wand he quickly charmed the curtains shock but not before Malfoy’s face had gone into an apparent state of shock.
In his haste to forget about the event before it had even begun, Harry had barely spared a thought for who would be in attendance. If he’d spared more than a single brain cell, it might have crossed his mind to consider the fact that Draco was employed to advise various Ministry departments—or he was, last Harry’d heard—and therefore chances of crossing paths tonight were high.
Harry knew from the tone of his voice that he wasn’t going to owl. He also knew that fighting was a pointless endeavour. Dejected, he nodded a second too late as he heard the distinct crack of apparation and Draco was gone.
Maybe it served him right for making fun of Ron’s irritation, maybe the universe simply wanted to rub some salt in his wounds. Either way, Harry had definitely not been expecting Ron of all people to ask him if he’d heard from Malfoy lately. Furthermore, when he said no he hadn’t anticipated to then be handed the Prophet and told to flip to page five.
Was it weird that he kept all of the letters he had received from Draco? Harry told himself it was perfectly normal to hold onto correspondence; he kept all of Ginny’s letters! Maybe that was a poor comparison. Reassuring himself as he remembered that he kept all of Ron’s letters, and the ones from Hermione — well, except for the unimportant ones. What even constituted unimportant? His other friends simply sent far too many for him to keep them all whereas he and Draco only owled when it was of great importance.
They walked alongside each other in comfortable silence for a few more minutes, Harry taking the time to truly appreciate the summer’s day. Hermione shot him a few smug looks as they walked as if she knew what he was feeling and he couldn’t help the grin that broke out across his face. Screw therapy. Maybe he’d just go for walks in the sun instead.
“I won’t push it any more right now,” she said, deflating. “Just… Just know you can talk to me about it, okay?”
Harry nodded, grimacing at the memory. “One of them, yeah. Another kissed my bloody hand. It was awful.”
He sighed, ripping through the paper in the hopes that if he could get it over with quickly, maybe he’d be left alone long enough to slip away. As the wrapping fell away there was a gasp from Hermione to his left and he looked down at the silver blade in his hands, unsure of what was so special about it.
The git was laughing now, having smacked Draco across the back of his head before leaning on his knees to snicker. “That’s not what I mean and you know it.”
Snapped out of his thoughts, Harry blinked rapidly as he tried to make sense of Hermione’s words. “What?”
Feeling slightly embarrassed but mostly relieved, Harry tried to ignore the flush he felt creeping over his cheeks as he looked down at them. The gloves were shaped like hedgehogs, with fluffy bristles on the back of his hands “Teddy got them for me, actually.”
, Hermione started down the stairs and Harry fell into step behind her. Happy just to have made it out of Grimmauld without a proper argument, Harry pocketed the bag of galleons along with his wand and resumed humming the tune from earlier, drawing a snort from in front of him.
Arthur laughed, shaking his head as he looked back to Harry. “Point being, it’s been many decades. I don’t even know if they exist anymore, to tell you the truth. Who’ve you been swapping stories with, hey?”
spent the last week spiralling through all kinds of anticipatory emotions as he realised that it was almost time to meet Teddy on Platform 9 3/4 for Christmas hols, which meant that he was going to see Draco again.
The atmosphere on Platform 9 3/4 felt lighter, less coloured by the pain and losses of long ago and more filled with hope. Harry had driven again, this time bringing Draco along with the three of them after he had floo’d over to Andromeda’s that morning. They made quite the crowd, Harry navigating as Teddy darted quickly between people in a mad race to board the Hogwarts Express before it took off.
After hearing the disconnect tone Harry placed the phone back on the receiver. He was worried, that was for sure, but figured he would give it another five minutes before telling anybody that he was worried he was dying. Harry walked over to the sofa across the room and took a seat, hoping to ride it out.
A familiar laugh sounded behind him before Scorpius broke free of Albus’ arm, running over to wrap his arms around Astoria. “Mother, you’re here!”
Lifting his head at Astoria’s amused tone, Harry cocked his head to the side as he looked at her. “Yeah, Draco mentioned in his letter. I’m not sure there’s any reason for me to worry though.”
“Yes, Harry. Sex.” Pausing, Draco considered how best to put it. “I don’t… Really feel that way about anyone. At all.”
“Take you where?” Harry asked, ears catching the name at the forefront of his mind. “What was that about Draco?”
His intention had been to come home and pretend that everything was alright while he figured out how to broach the subject. He had forgotten to factor in how perceptive Ginny was; he only took a few steps through the door before she sighed, ushering him through to the kitchen with a finger pressed to her lips to stay silent.
So many words had been left unsaid between them. It had taken every ounce of the self control he possessed not to fall at Draco’s feet—metaphorically speaking, of course—and answer his letter last year with a resounding
“It’s alright. She’s got the best healers, and there’s not much I can really do besides providing moral support as requested.”
Harry shook his head. “No, Hermione. That doesn’t matter. If we could make the right choices, so could he.”
when it was messy, unlike his atrocious bird’s nest. “Its not my fault you’re a workaholic, Potter.”
’s article speculating about who Harry’s new girlfriend could possibly be. Apparently an inside source had all the juicy details and it was all anyone could talk about. Leaving the house was something he let other people do these days, for fear of being perceived by anyone who believed this rubbish.
With a laugh that was more like a bark, Draco shook his head, gaze dropping to the floor between them. “I do, and honestly? I’m glad. I spent my whole life wanting to please him, to fit the role of the Malfoy heir. Mother, rest her soul, wasn’t much better when it came down to it and when— when it happened,” Draco said, voice stumbling over his words as it shook. “Astoria and I talked about what we wanted to do. I’ve been more stubborn than I needed to be because I was scared of being what my father was, when really I think all I’ve done is show Scorpius that it’s more important to lie to protect your family name than to live life how you want to.”
“It’s a pleasure,” she said, turning back to Ginny and complimenting her dress. When Ginny perked up and exchanged compliments of her own, Harry tuned the two of them out as he prepared for how to react when Draco inevitably followed his wife over.
Her words propelled him into a memory of a similar conversation years ago, making him pause for a moment before answering.
Smiling gently, Hermione nodded. “I’m not telling you to decide anything today. In fact, please don’t decide anything today. You’re horrible for making rash decisions. Just think about what I said earlier, and remember that Arthur was just telling stories, okay?"
“You know what your lot did to my sister? It’s not right that you get to waltz around here, scum like you, while she’s gone. I ought to have your head for that, boy.”
“Yeah, one of the boys in my class told everyone about you when we learned about dragons.” With a shrug, James put his cutlery down to look questioningly at Harry. “Mum said that story was made up.”
“Oh Merlin, that’s disgusting.” She placed the glass in front of her, turning her eyes back on Harry once more. “Okay, so. I guess you already felt like part of my family and we didn’t question if it needed to be more than that. I don’t know. I’m not saying we did something we shouldn’t have done, or that any of it wasn’t real. Does that make sense?”
Many of the Slytherins hadn’t returned this year. Draco had resented McGonagall’s request for returning eighth-years to occupy the empty Slytherin dorm beds at first, even more so when students became civil with one another and started eating together in the Great Hall. Eventually everyone had accepted it, begun to enjoy it perhaps. Slowly the loss and horror that filled the air had dissipated with normality taking its place. It filled Draco with envy and a confusion he refused to address, for fear of recognising why he was the only person who couldn’t move past it all.
She laughed, placing her mug back on the table. “Not really. You’re just a very confused man. Have you ever considered that Draco and your job are related?”
Laughing, Draco shook his head. “Aside from the obvious. We were talking about how it would impact the children. You said you couldn’t see what the fuss was about anyway, it wasn’t like we were eloping or causing a scandal.”
Glancing back at Malfoy he could tell that they were both equally confused and he decided to hell with it, he was here now and therefore he was going to help the git find an owl before carrying on about his day as if nothing had happened. So much for making it back to training on time.
“I’d best be off,” Andromeda said to their left, startling Harry out of his emotions. “You’ll both be here for Christmas holidays, of course?”
Satisfied that Andromeda would handle the situation, Harry stepped closer to where Draco was leaning by the doorway, frown affixed on his face as if he’d been hit with a permanent sticking charm. He watched the blonde’s eyes glance at him as he approached, before murmuring low enough so the others wouldn’t hear. “Come home with me?”
“You kissed?!” She shouted, quickly covering her mouth with her hands as she realised how loud her voice had been. “You kissed?” She repeated at a whisper. “Last night?”

Healer Benson gave a soft laugh. “Yes, well. People with far more power and influence than me make the decisions, I’m afraid. That being said, it’s a start. I daresay it’d do Harry some good.”
She stopped when they got to the outer edges of the garden, close enough to the house to feel comforting but far enough away that prying eyes and curious ears wouldn’t trouble them. After casting a quick
He rambled on for a while as Harry stood, grin stretching across his face like a lunatic as he felt a warmth spreading through him.
"I suspected as much." She studied his face for a few moments, eyes crinkling at the corner at whatever she found there. “I’m starting to think you should just wait for him to owl then.”
Taking in the chaos before them, Harry nodded. “I think my parents might have been on to something just having one.”
“Oh.” Hermione’s brow furrowed and Harry could practically hear her thinking from across the room. “But the books…”
There was a soft smile on Draco’s face as he began his reply. “Think of the love you have for Weasley—not Ginevra, the other one—and Granger. It might not be quite the same; we hardly fought a Dark Lord together. Still, we’re in this marriage for the same mutually beneficial reasons and are fond enough of one another to make it work. Our child will want for nothing.”
Draco tilted his head, raising a brow in Harry’s direction. “What in Merlin’s name for? It’s behind us now.
“Bloody terrifying,” Draco agreed with a short laugh. “Though hopefully by then it’ll feel less…” He trailed off, but Harry knew exactly what he was referring to. It was the prickling feeling on their skin, the nausea that wouldn’t quite sit still. Something that only time and patience would be able to navigate.
as she shook her head knowingly, pulling the paper crown out of her end and placing it firmly on his head.
Shaking her head, Ginny looked up at him from beneath glistening lashes. “We both lost a lot. You wanted a family, and I… Right now, I think I need a drink.” Turning to pick up her wand from where she’d left it beside the sink, Ginny summoned two glasses and looked back over her shoulder at Harry. “Do we still have the brandy?”
His footsteps reached the door again and as he swivelled he glimpsed the time on the grandfather clock in the corner. He knew it was late. It hadn’t seemed like it was 2 o’clock when he’d finally given in to his emotions and peeled the covers back to walk back and forth like a caged animal past his four poster bed, but either he’d been walking a lot longer than he thought he had, or he had underestimated the amount of time he had spent laying in bed trying to ignore the feeling as it built.
He watched as Harry’s eyes widened slightly before his head dropped, gaze focused on where his hands were tightly gripping his knees.
They were sprawled across the floor at this point, leaning their backs against the couch. Harry had shrugged off his coat and jumper as the alcohol had started to warm him up a bit. Ron was flushed, unable to remove the horrendous sweater that George had forced onto him; they’d had a bet going at the shop all year and having lost, the Jingle My Bells innuendo was a permanent fixture across Ron’s for at least the next 32 hours. It had been funny when Harry first spotted it but now Ron wouldn’t stop complaining about how itchy it was getting, leaving him hoping that Hermione would know a spell to at least alleviate the discomfort.
“He mentioned in his last owl he might be seeing George and Angelina. Something about a family New Year’s getaway while the shop quietens down.”
“Oh, and Harry?” Came the suspiciously nonchalant call from her retreating figure. “Clear tomorrow afternoon. We’ve got plans.”
Sighing, Harry rolled his eyes and watched Ginny stick her tongue out at him in response. “Well, you said Scorpius’ dad told him about me. Did he say anything else about that? About his dad?
“Right.” Harry let out a long exhale, steeling himself for what he hoped wouldn’t piss Draco off too much. “Listen, Draco. About last year, I—”
“Mister Potter,” came the unfamiliar voice. “Draco mentioned he owled. He was stupid enough to think you wouldn’t come here.”
“Er, mate… I’m kinda with Hermione on this one. I know you’ve never been the best of mates with Malfoy, and I’m still not the git’s hugest fan, but I reckon you should just drop it, yeah?”
“Wouldn’t really say he cornered me,” Harry mumbled. “Was just weird, that’s all. Bit out of nowhere really.”
With a snort, Hermione shook her head. “The way some of the staff there fawned over you was, quite frankly, incredibly unprofessional and off-putting to say the least. It has made me realise the wizarding world severely lacks the support it needs particularly considering what we’ve just been through in recent years.”
Draco snorted, shooting him a sideways glance. “Forgive me if I didn’t believe that at first. You were quite determined when I saw you in Diagon that day.”
Harry had to give it to her, Healer Benson barely faltered as she took in Hermione’s seething disgust. With a subtle flick of her wrist a pamphlet made its way to Hermione, who managed to grab it in one hand before it smacked into her chest. He watched as she took one look at the cover and seemed to deflate as her eyes widened, before she gave a curt nod to Healer Benson and grimaced.
“Harry,” she said in a low tone, placing the glass on the counter in front of him. “Will you be okay walking past him?”
“Well, I was wondering…” She dropped her voice to a whisper and leaned in close across the table. “Could we go speak to someone at St Mungo’s? I know you’re not a huge fan,” She added hurriedly, “But it would really make me feel better about it and, um, they might be able to give you an alternative suggestion.”
The clinking of cutlery against plates was horribly loud in Harry’s ears after that, with conversations around the table dampened by what had transpired. Tensions were thick in the air, though Harry tried his best to ignore it. He knew that Draco could feel it too, the heavy atmosphere pressing against his skin and the way it made his throat feel as if it were closing in. They made it through lunch in relative silence, Harry sensing Draco’s growing anxiety and taking their cue to leave as soon as could be considered polite, after dessert; it was sinful to leave before Molly served the Yule log.
After exchanging hugs and well wishes they began gathering their belongings to leave, Ron and Hermione opting to floo straight to the Burrow while Harry and Ginny decided they would make a quick stop at home first to drop off gifts they’d received and collect the few they’d forgotten to bring that morning. Teddy was barely keeping his eyes open as Andromeda lifted him over her shoulder, waving goodbye to the departing couple by the fireplace.
is a… ritual, I suppose. When you’ve suffered a lot. Go to the place of the pain and sit with it until it sets you free. I’ve been trying, but—”
“…You seriously don’t do that here.” Her tone was cold, syllables even, and somehow that made it all the more terrifying.
While Hermione shot him a glance and changed the subject to their plans for the wedding, Harry nodded along and made noises where it seemed appropriate, relying on Ron to carry most of this conversation. Meanwhile, he vowed to keep a close eye on Malfoy. Starting with his stupid Secret Santa thing. Harry would have to find out who Malfoy had drawn from the hat and protect them from a potentially harmful gift, keeping them safe while also proving that Malfoy hadn’t changed at all since their schooling years.
“I see.” Harry stood watching her expression give nothing away of what was going on beneath that mask. It unnerved him for some reason that he couldn’t quite put his finger on. Giving up, he turned to examine the rest of the room, eyes landing on the grandiose Christmas tree in the far corner. It stretched at least halfway to the ceiling, but what drew Harry’s attention most of all was the sheer number of baubles and lights adorning it. He suspected there was more tinsel than branches. Gorgeous as it was, it had an air of
Standing quickly, he squeezed past his friends and made his way into the kitchen, ignoring the whispers that broke out behind him. Rounding the corner he stopped dead in his tracks as he saw Draco frozen across the room at the sight of him.
It was a voice he would have recognised anywhere, being one he’d heard almost daily for six years. Though at one point in his life it would have given Harry great pleasure to hear Malfoy being harassed, these days it seemed to only leave a sour taste in his mouth.
Making his way outside behind her, the cool air bit at his arms as he pulled his shirt sleeves back down as low as they would go over his hands, rubbing them together to generate a bit of heat without bothering to reach for his wand. The sun had set during his chat with Ron and not expecting to be outside, he had dressed lightly: a thin long-sleeved shirt and a worn pair of Dudley’s old jeans. Ginny was bundled up ahead of him, as to be expected after spending the day out flying. She didn’t seem to still be in her flying gear but she looked warm, which he was grateful for. As confusing as the situation might be, he’d hate to have a conversation that he’d been dreading while also worrying about her health.
It was a miracle, really, how everything had turned out. He hadn't honestly expected to make it this far. If the war didn't kill him he was sure the Dark Lord would have. Or the angry mobs who wanted every Death Eater’s head on a stake after the losses their side had suffered. He understood completely. It was difficult to admit but by the end of it he was so incredibly hopeful that stupid Potter would make it happen. That he would defeat the Dark Lord and Draco wouldn't have to live under his thumb anymore. He daren't speak these thoughts to anyone, not even his mother, for he knew exactly how awful they were. He had been raised on the side of the pureblood army and it had been drilled into him from such a young age: anyone not of pure wizarding descent is inferior and must be treated as such, or disposed of. He believed it wholeheartedly. He lived, breathed, ate, drank, slept, woke, a servant of this belief.
Harry cut off Draco’s muffled apology with a raised hand, keeping his gaze locked ahead. “I might not like your parents much, but at least they got to raise you. My aunt and uncle, they…”
Groaning as he lay back on the unmade bed, Harry pressed both fists to his eyes. “She’s going to kill me,” he mumbled into his hands. “Kreacher, she’s going to kill me.”
With a sad smile, Hermione reached across the gap between them to lay her hand on his forearm. “I know. You may not talk about it much, but you’re incredibly easy to read after all these years.”
“Here?” Draco questioned. At Harry’s nod, he began to count on his fingers. “There was the time you broke your arm and then lost all your bones. Oh! How could you forget Weasel—Weasley, sorry—vomiting slugs? Or the time that—”
“I see.” Looking to Harry for confirmation, Healer Benson shot him a sympathetic smile at his clear discomfort. “Harry, do you feel you’ve left out anything of great importance?”
would. He’s obviously been obsessed with you for just as long, if not longer, except he’s gone and done the mature thing and admit that he wants to do more adult things than just taunt you for the rest of your sorry existence.”
“Mm. Oh, almost forgot to tell you! Dean’s chuffed about your suggestion. He got chatting with Pansy last night and let me just say, I don’t think there’s going to be any issues there.”
“Oh.” Harry blinked a few times, unsure what to make of that. “Hmm. That’s definitely not what I thought started that. Thought it was just a bit too much wine and… I don’t know. Excitement that we decided to stop being married? Guess that doesn’t make much sense when I say it out loud.” He paused, looking up at Ginny’s amused face. “You really think me talking about my feelings is sexy?”
“Yeah, yeah. Saint Potter to the rescue, as always. Haven’t you got some kneazles to rescue from a tree or something?”
“I want you to know, Harry. We’ll be getting married no matter what. He needs an heir, I need a husband.” She was staring directly into his eyes now, her gaze feeling like it was burning its way through his skull. “We’re both keeping our families happy. Do not dare get in the way of that because of some whimsical—”
“Come on then, I think you’ve had quite enough time in the snow for one evening. Let’s get you both home to Andromeda.”
“Merlin, no.” Harry shook his head perhaps a little too quickly at that, but if Ginny noticed she chose not to mention it. “Home now?”
“You’re coming back?” Cursing inwardly at the excitement that had creeped into his voice, Harry sighed. “I mean, that must be nice for her.”
Laughing, Ginny shook her head as she met his eyes once more. “I think you should tell Draco how you feel. And yes, you should quit your stupid job. Let me go to work every day without feeling guilty for leaving the kids with mum.”
His thoughts wandered back to earlier that week when he hadn’t known if he would make it out of there alive. The Dementor’s kiss was outlawed, sure, but that didn’t inspire any feelings of ease in Draco. He knew better than to assume anything after all he had lived through. The thought of falling victim to their kiss was horrible, but worse than even that was the stares he had gotten upon arrival at the ministry. Some looks were scathing, filled with hatred and anger, but the ones that haunted Draco the most were the eyes that seemed to pity him. As if they knew how much he hadn’t wanted to be involved in everything surrounding him, the decisions he never got to make. He hated those stares. They knew nothing of his situation, no matter what they might have heard. No doubt they’d heard the words of one of the people who had testified to keep him out of Azkaban. He wanted to feel grateful and he was sure if he listened closely enough, a hidden part of him was appreciative.
Sauntering across the room to join Teddy by the tree, Malfoy threw an amused smirk back over his shoulder. “Helps to have the right connections, Potter.”
“That did the trick! Alright, I’m heading off with Luna now. If you need to have a Malfoy crisis, I’ll be home tomorrow. Actually, you'll see me for Christmas in a few days, you can wait. Don’t floo tonight please, you’re unbearable when you floo me drunk.”
“Right,” Mary said with a quiet snort. Turning to Harry, she raised an eyebrow. “Not much for the festive spirit, is he?”
sorrrryyyyyyy i promise i will make up for the angsty times! gotta throw some ✨emotions✨ at the boys for character development, right?
He had known this was coming—especially with him visiting Ron at the Burrow so often—but he had been hoping to avoid the conversation just a little longer.
, Harry took a second to appreciate the holiday decor. There was a miniature Christmas tree on the front counter and strings of multicoloured lights hung from the walls, giving it a festive feel. His feet found their way to the back of the short queue as he smiled to himself while watching the people at each table going about their days. Busy taking in the atmosphere, it wasn’t until he heard the familiar voice ordering in front of him that he snapped out of his people watching and his head turned to the unmistakable white blonde hair just above his natural line of sight.
Harry let out a sigh which quickly became a yawn and he gave in to it, finally making his way back to where the undersheets were exposed and collapsing once again into his bed. As he pulled the covers back over himself he felt the rage begin to boil under the surface once more—apparently unhappy with his lack of movement that had been keeping it at bay—but refused to do anything more than sleep at this point. He pressed his face into the pillow to muffle a groan as he thought about his early start tomorrow; inevitably Hermione would yet again know that he was up most of the night despite spending the evening in St Mungo’s and lecture him about the importance of proper sleep hygiene.
“Er…” Hesitant though he was to talk about his potential misuse of Wideye in the past month, Harry knew it would likely be painted in a better light coming from him. “Maybe?”
Ginny snapped, pointing her finger across the table at him accusatorially. “Percy, this wasn’t Harry at all. This was all you.”
“Usually you just use your wand,” Harry pointed out. “I didn’t realise you’d be standing to make it.”
He felt the cold glass of another Firewhiskey nudging his hand and he gladly took it from her, enjoying the first cold sip. “Mmm. You know what I mean though.”
“Oh. Well, you could still talk about it?” Harry paused, a small frown forming between his brows as he thought. “She said… Asexual, she said. She seemed to know a lot about it. Maybe she knows other asexual people?”
There was a scraping of chair against floor as George stood abruptly, mouth pressed into a thin line. Harry watched as the man’s eyes flickered around the table seeming to look at them all without actually seeing any of them, before George quickly walked out into the backyard and left an echoing silence behind.
“Oh yeah? They’re taking the kids across then?” Harry paused, thinking of the tiny toddlers he’d seen crawling around the Burrow a few weeks ago. “Be a bit of a pain travelling with those two, wouldn’t it?”
“Honestly?” Ginny sighed, tipping her head back to look at the ceiling. “I don’t want to make any big decisions before the holidays. You know mum will kick up a fuss, and it’s Albus’ first Christmas, and… These are all excuses, I know. What do you want to do, Harry?”
“Kreacher thinks that if master wants to be drinking so much of it, he should be keeping his rooms cleaner while he stays awake all night,” Kreacher muttered under his breath.
“We both know what happened here. How do you manage, night after night?” Before Draco could retort, Potter dropped his eyes again as his voice cracked on the final syllable. “Please.”
“How odd.” Hermione’s tone next to him was curious and he could feel her eyes boring into the side of his skull. “And if it splits in perfect halves? What’s that story?”
“Yes, I get your point.” Draco placed his mug back on the table, leaning forward on his elbows. “So you’ve realised it’s not what you had in mind. What’s the problem? It’s not so bad, is it?”
“Hmm?” Draco questioned with a blank look. “Oh, right. I’ll admit, it doesn’t look as awful as I’d thought.”
They were in the stands overlooking the Quidditch pitch again: the only place where Draco felt like he could be every part his true self with Harry.
Sighing, Harry leaned back and ran a hand through his hair. “I suppose not. It’s just not what I thought I would have.”
Craning his neck, Harry spotted Draco standing by the far wall, looking far too relaxed and delectable as ever in his perfectly tailored navy dress robes as he conversed with what appeared to be Hermione’s newest hire.
Draco looked up, shooting Harry a dark glare. “It’s a bit more complicated than that. I know you gave up the Black family home, but it wasn’t actually your family so it’s not quite the same—”
Whatever question Draco had been expecting, that definitely wasn’t it. “You disappeared for three months—
Perhaps his thoughts had always been skewed towards the wrong side, though he couldn’t say for sure which was wrong anymore. The beliefs he’d clung to so tightly in his early days might be problematic if he delved deep but it had been so much less effort and headache to be programmed that way. Ignorance truly was bliss, he could see that so clearly now.
Draco looked away, eyes glistening in the low light. “I know I don’t deserve another chance,” he said, voice quivering as he spoke. “Merlin, I didn’t even expect you to have waited this long. I thought I’d fucked up forever.”
With a grin, Harry signalled to Mary where she stood behind the counter with a bored expression on her face. “Brilliant. Too late to take that back now.”
He shrugged. “Hardly. They make good products, Teddy loves them, it’s conveniently closer to visit and Diagon doesn’t hold half as many memories as Hogsmeade.”
“When you put it that way, it doesn’t sound too great.” Hermione laughed, leaning back in the armchair and looking at Harry as she did so. He loved Hermione’s laugh; for all the time they’d spent being idiots in school, he felt that she laughed more now. Leaving a war behind would do that to someone, he supposed. The sound was light and melodious, her face unguarded and carefree. Like she had grown into her laugh as she had grown into this version of herself. With a soft smile taking its place, she quirked a brow at him. “You don’t really think that’s depressing, do you?”
It was endearing, and enough to make Harry’s breath catch in his throat. Maybe they could navigate the pain, if Draco could get it through his head just how much this was his final chance. “I’m not sure you get it, Draco. When you told me to sort things out with Ginny all those years ago… You were right. I was running from my problems.” Shaking his head as he thought to the men they’d been back then, Harry sighed. “I thought I needed to be better for you, but I know now that I actually needed to be better for myself. All those years, I wanted a version of you that I thought was doing the same, because surely if you were the reason I could do it, you could too, right?”
“Of course,” Harry said as he turned to see James half asleep in her arms. Overwhelmed with emotion, he beamed at her and wiped his eyes before he let any tears fall. “I’ll grab the bags and meet you by the fire.”
Harry sat in silence for a moment, slightly stunned that he’d gotten such an honest and heartfelt answer. “Er… Will you be doing it again this year, then?”
"You sound like Ginny," he grumbled, eyes staying pressed firmly shut as he tried not to think on how much what he was about to say hurt to think about. “Even if he missed the divorce announcement… That was so long ago, ‘Mione. There’s no way he’s missed all the bloody rubbish since then. If he wanted to talk, he’s had plenty of chances.”
“I don’t want to get back together, you idiot.” She rolled her eyes and his shoulders dropped with a sigh of relief. “I just mean living together with the kids. I don’t plan to start seeing anyone else yet, I want to focus on raising our children and you have to admit that we work well together. As friends,” she added as Harry opened his mouth again. “What if we just co-parented as housemates for a while? Then neither of us has to try find a new place, and when it does finalise there will be less fallout in the papers if they see we’re amicable.”
“You’re bloody lucky to have her, you know. How on earth that woman continues working while taking care of James and doesn’t drive herself mad worrying about you in the field all day—”
He nodded, plastering a smile on his face and shrugging. “Here’s hoping the little Malfoy’s not as much of a prat as his father.”
What constituted a better time, he wondered? He lay there reminiscing on easier days when he was young and naive, determined to rule the world in the same way he’d always thought his father had. The lust and pull he’d felt to his childhood of late seemed to dull with every deeper inspection of the truth. Draco’s thoughts were being coloured anew and he wasn’t entirely certain he liked this process.
The Healer met his eyes and Harry felt a pang in his chest as he was reminded of Dumbledore; she seemed to see the unspoken words, everything he had omitted during his conversation with the nurse earlier. “To have exuded such raw magical energy in your sleep? Yes, Mister Potter. I had hoped there was an easier explanation for what appears to be happening.”
Molly’s grumbles could be heard as she walked off, apparently unwilling to let Harry spend too much time in her home without a plate in his hand. Eyes flicking back to Ginny as Molly disappeared from view, Harry raised his eyebrows expectantly.
Harry’s jaw dropped, along with the tin of polish he’d been holding. “Oh. I… did not see that coming.”
“It’s funny, I didn’t expect to care so much.” She left out a broken laugh as her shoulders shook before curling in on herself, arms wrapping around her torso. “These past weeks… Maybe even longer than that. It felt like maybe this wasn’t right for us anyway. Like I’d wanted you because I couldn’t have you and then you left, and I kept wanting this idea I had for our future together. I almost feel like we were just doing what everyone expected us to do. Does that make sense?”
“How are you holding up?” Harry asked quietly, watching the other man’s eyes stay fixed on the stag. “You seem a bit lost in thought.”
“But he does!” John yelled, wand sparking towards the floor even as Harry tightened the grip on his arm.
The sentence length was of little consequence; Draco knew that staying out of there in the first place would guarantee his survival, in whatever form it took, whereas being sent to Azkaban with the possibility of a shorter term meant little in the way of actually leading to his release. They may have mentioned early release to house arrest but considering the social status of his witness stand, he thought it wise to assume it was all a front for the public. They needed reassurance, of course, that Potter’s opinion held value! Therefore to give him a life sentence publicly would be to tarnish the very saviour they all held in such high regard. Clearly Shacklebolt had no intention of freeing Draco, given his history and the side he had chosen. Yes, this was all for public morale. Best to ensure faith in the Chosen One and also get Draco behind bars, so they could indefinitely extend his term until there was no future left for him to follow beyond insanity or starvation.
Astoria scoffed. “Glad to know someone finds it endearing. Imagine how much he could complain about you in a day, and then multiply that by most days of the year for the entirety of our marriage.”
“Do I get to see your new house?” Scorpius asked, excitement practically radiating off him in waves as he cut off Harry’s retort. At her answering nod, he turned his head back to look at Albus. “Al, I get to half-live in London!”
“The Muggle-born is telling Kreacher that Master Harry does not need worry about heart attack. The Muggle-born is not looking very happy with Master Harry.”
apart some mornings—but from what he could tell, most of his year had been spent living on the continent with his mother and fiancee. It was different seeing him printed in grainy black and white images to in the flesh now, all six foot something of the man he once thought he knew.
“I’ll leave you in Chelsea’s capable hands,” Harry said as he tilted his head towards the mess he’d left up the back of the shop. “Best be getting back to it.”
As timed passed, the tempo slowed. The pranks became tamer, the hexes not even mildly painful. By the time Christmas rolled around they were faking reactions for passersby as spells missed them entirely. The words they slung at each other didn’t hit the same, followed by smirks and the occasional outright grin. So tangled up in this routine, the holiday departure of their friends along with most of the castle was almost welcome.
“Oh.” Harry was quiet for a moment, thinking back to his Ministry days. “I didn’t realise it was so bad. It was in the Aurors, obviously, but surely that’s different?”
He saw her jaw clench as she let out a deep sigh before glaring in his direction. “I will let you have Kreacher cook only because you’re going to tell him he’s not allowed to give you Wideye under any circumstance, or to continue cleaning up after you.”
“I want to keep being friends, at least. But I don’t know if we can right now. It’s hard to see you and know you might not want this anymore, even though…”
“—So you see, taking too much of either breeds a dependence which is not only dangerous but hard to break. You’re likely already finding it harder to wake up each day without Wideye and Dreamless Sleep will be at the other end of the spectrum: you’ll find it near impossible to wind down without it.”
Draco opened his mouth to respond, cut off by Andromeda calling out from the barrier between platforms nine and ten. “Sorry to interrupt, boys, but we’ve got to get this one through before he misses the train.”
“Death Eater, remember? Not many wizards who spare you a second glance, unless they're into some disturbing things.” Though his tone was lighthearted, Harry could hear the bitter edge to his words. “It’s also part of why I discouraged this from going much further, honestly. I don’t want Scorpius to deal with the world thinking his father’s seducing their Saviour for evil.”
Standing again, Draco tipped back the dregs of his coffee and shook his head. “Go home, Harry. Please don’t contact me again unless you genuinely figure things out with Ginevra and are able to respect my marriage equally.”
article for them. Maybe Harry ought to write and see how he was coping. At the very least, it was appropriate to send congratulations when a child was born. He and Ginny had received more letters than they’d known what to do with when James’ birth had been announced and though he hoped otherwise, Harry assumed it would be the same when they welcomed their next child. Nodding to himself while he made his way to the desk in their bedroom, Harry talked himself out of finding a gift to go with the letter and opened the bottom left drawer as he took a seat.
They both breathed shakily as their reflections showed the other what they were each too proud to say, even now: “sorry” wasn’t even close to covering what had brought about that incident, but their mutual fear and will to survive had been stronger than either conscience. Draco shook with all of the unspoken emotions and hoped that Harry couldn’t see it, despite so obviously seeing and feeling Harry quiver next to where he stood.
Harry took the proffered potion and threw it back in one gulp, grimacing slightly at the bitter aftertaste. He clenched his eyelids shut tight as he waited for the jolt of energy to hit, ever aware of how loud his breathing was in the silence around them. Having taken Wideye more often than not this past month, Harry knew almost to the second how long it took to come into effect and the fingers on his wand hand tapped impatiently as he counted down the moments.
“Harry, I am getting you help whether you like it or not. Let me do things my way and research all the options out there, otherwise I am admitting you to
There had been no snowfall tonight, but after their traditional light adventure Draco had suggested they walk down to Hyde Park to see the ice rink. When they were almost there, Harry spotted some icy slush presumably from snow earlier in the week and gestured to Draco for the boys to follow him.
He frowned, hating the way he could so easily agree with her words now. “This isn’t what I expected.”
“Relax, ‘Mione. It was a joke, you’re allowed to laugh.” Tipping his head back against the wall, he closed his eyes as he let out a long exhale. “You’re right though. I love their big family, I really do, but I can’t imagine raising one that size on my own.”
Draco snorted, shaking his head. “She knows who she married. Do you want a signed permission slip or something?
A shout from a nearby table was the final straw; by now he’d garnered the attention of the entire pub and felt as if he’d been plunged into the icy-cold depths of the Great Lake as all eyes focused on him. Gulping, he turned his pleading stare to Ron and Hermione in turn as he realised that something was amiss.
