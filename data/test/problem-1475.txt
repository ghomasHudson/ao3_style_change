Hermione would handle it better; she would order dozens of books on the psychological damage of child abuse and handle everything in the most politically correct way possible, sickeningly careful and gentle in her interactions with him, as if he were some unspeakably delicate treasure fashioned of glass rather than a boy who had been broken so many times before that his scars had scars had scars.
Harry has always followed his instincts.  Aside from that one notable Quirrel/Snape mixup, he’s usually right.  Something about being born for a war, born for a prophecy, groomed from the age of eleven and attacked constantly makes for very good instincts; Harry would’ve been dead by far if he didn’t listen to them.  And there’s something about Eilonwy Selwyn that draws him, something strange in her large, unfathomable, eyes.

He hasn’t thought of Malfoy in months; their seething animosity seems childish, superfluous, now, and it’s almost anachronistic to meet his gaze, like he’s been plucked from the grayness and desolation and slipped back into the old easy ways, identifying enemies by the color of their ties, green or red.

Slowly, a white bicuspid tugging at his red mouth, Potter twists his wrist with a surprising amount of grace.  Not elegance, never elegance, but a certain arresting, figuring, power that is born from duels and battles rather than dances and ballrooms.

“It’s a magical language that involves the ability to speak to snakes and most relatives, including chimeras, several species of dragon, and cockatrices.  It’s a dominant trait found primarily in the line of Salazar Slytherin, and several pureblooded lines in India.  Salazar Slytherin is said to have performed a ritual to keep the Parseltongue trait alive in his descendants.  Parselscript and Parselmagic are offshoots of Parseltongue- Parselscript is the phonetic translation of Parseltongue, and Parselmagic is magic spoken in Parseltongue, which amplifies the force of magic behind the spell by a constant of 2.5, although that can vary depending on the strength of the caster and the type of spell, given that Parselmagic works best with Transfiguration, Transmutation, and the Dark Arts.” Harry rattles off promptly.  Malfoy gapes.
Snape looks at him, onyx eyes assessing and sharp, and Harry wonders if Snape’s capable of wordlessly and wandlessly Legilimizing him, Professor Dumbledore and Voldemort certainly are.  Harry drops his gaze.
Potter’s grin slips the longer Draco stays silent, and he makes his way, robes grazing the tiles as he bends slightly, a hand flung forth like an offering.  Draco takes it, feeling impossibly tender all over, as if his skin’s been scraped raw.
She is mad.  She is broken.  She is loyal to a fault; Draco wonders if she would not have made an excellent Hufflepuff.
She slides up his forearm, bare and slender in the moon, her tongue flicking at the blood pooling in his palm.
The Potter boy is- something is different. He’d heard about the runaway and scoffed, because it was just like the boy to forget about the Order, about duty and responsibility and care and simply run off, leaving the house in ravaged shreds around the fat pulp of his Uncle.  Just like Black, too, really, maybe fleeing is part and parcel of that particular bloodline.  (He is not one for pureblood genealogies but he knows this: Dorea Black married a Potter.  Potter has Black blood in his veins.)

Then, there is a soft sound, a curse, and a huff of opposing laughter.
His Occlumency barriers are a meter thick, walls of cold iron and steel and stone, but he reinforces them in case, layering them with Dark Magic and curses so foul that Dumbledore would probably faint; he cannot show weakness.
Harry smiles, painfully.
An O for Transfig and Care, E’s for Potions and Herbology… he’d failed Divination, obviously, and Astronomy was a bust, given the business with Hagrid…
And yet, Draco has never seen Harry Potter so vulnerable as he had been mere moments ago, his head bowed and cradled in the cage of his arms, the nape of his neck clean and bare and so killable.

When the Dark Lord relents, Draco is trembling, shivering.
Yes, this chapter marks the demise of both 'Hogwarts Harry' and 'Summer Harry'.  RIP.
Draco casts several high-powered locking charms on his door, as is his habit, and gets to work.
He intends to go to the family library, intends to research Parseltongue and maybe, if he has time, a countercurse, but he hears voices and pauses.

So, because Harry's been abused and basically has developed a second personality to deal with his trauma, (wait, scratch that- his ~original~ personality is what's dealing with it- the blank, unemotive, survivor.  the happy, adventurous, boy is the second personality.  okay, continue) one might wonder as to his mental walls, i.e. his Occlumency skills.  Well, suffice it to say- Harry indeed has some good fucking Occlumency walls, although they aren't Draco-level (let alone

“If you’re not in Gryffindor,” Harry says, sharply, “You might as well clear out.” He pauses, biting his lip.  “And,” Harry adds reluctantly, “If you’re just here to gawk at me-” This prompts a round of furious giggles from a cluster of shiningly-arrayed Gryffindors, and Harry sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose and raking a hand through his curls, which are immutably tangled from the wind.

Draco peers deeper, gaze narrowing, scything through the thick blanket of Notice-Me-Not’s- they only work if one isn’t aware of them, and Draco is quite aware.  He’s also quite adept at seeing through them, and a minute is all it takes before he’s sliding under them and

Lily, he thinks.
With a hiss, he enlarges Aoife slightly, just enough for her to intimidating but nowhere close to her real length and loops her around his neck where she curls, content and sunny, scarf-like.

That taken care of (there’s no way to ward against the cursed silver; he checked), Draco turns to Parseltongue.
He makes his way to Defense just in time- and oh, fuck. Snape’s there, the tip of his nose and the slick oil-shine of his hair.  The sear of his black, black, eyes.  Those eyes loved my mother once, Harry thinks numbly, feeling pinned to the wall with accusation.

Harry wonders when Voldemort stopped being Tom.  When he, teetering on the knife-edged brink of humanity, had jerked in one last desperate paroxysm and plummeted unerringly for the deepest cesspits.  When Tom Riddle started looking an awful lot like a ghost and Voldemort had been the only name that comes to mind for the luridly pale, scarlet-eyed, apparition that looks more like a monster of legend than the ‘greatest wizard who ever lived’.
3. We will soon enter Harry's POV.  (Right now he's seeming like a bit of a moronic jock-stereotype and I promise it isn't that- remember, Harry was abused, too, even if his abuse was different from Draco's.  He was starved, beaten, assaulted; Draco was beaten and tortured à la
God, he’s such a mess.
Draco watches as Potter stumbles into the Defense Against The Dark Arts (ha, he’s been training in the Dark Arts all summer) classroom, hair a perpetual mess that is truly, utterly, astonishing in the degree of its explosive messiness, robes slightly askew, and tie knotted loose around the golden hollow of his throat.  Something hollows him.  Draco can feel a similar feeling in the knot of his stomach, in the bruise that has begun to ache again (the Numbing Potions are wearing off).

he’d said.
Harry closes his eyes, burrows under the sheets.  Breathes.
His life, before Hogwarts, was lived in brief, illusory, moments- the flicker of a firefly, the comforting weight of the library and brief stories of wizards and knights and dragons, those rare moments when he was alone in the house and he could finally
“Yep.” Potter nods, smiling vaguely, and… moves on.  Draco stares, mouth falling open uselessly, before he shelves the matter in his mind, resolving to interrogate Potter on it later.  Right now, the Chamber is his priority.

Hardly anything ever does, besides faint disdain; Draco’s been disregarding his emotions long enough that they fade into muffled, unheeded, cries.
Harry smiles at her.  “Well, pleased to meet you, Eilonwy Selwyn.”
Potter bends at the sinks, hands skating over each tap with absent-minded fondness of touch, eyes level with one tap.  Draco squints in the near dark to see it- he thinks can see a snake-carving on the tap.  Slowly, Potter hisses:
What else will Vernon take? The green of his mother’s eyes the black of his father’s hair- and God knows he’s

and then he blunders the third spectacularly, so much so that the stands erupt with laughter.  Not even Cormac… Harry looks to where Hermione’s sitting.  Her nose and cheeks are pink, she’s averting her eyes, and he can see her wand, pointed precisely where Cormac was a few seconds ago.  He feels the bizarre urge to laugh.  For all that Hermione loves her morals and strict, equanimous, rules, she abandons them soundly in the face of mitigating circumstances.  He casts his mind back to another Quidditch incident, the one in first year, Hermione setting Snape on fire.
“Harry.” Ginny clips out, fierce.  She’s always been fierce, even hidden under the doe-eyed fangirl from second-year, or maybe Tom did that, Tom carved out the heart in her which was made of mollusk hearts and melting sugar and shoved his hands deep, shoved in iron and coal and fire.  Tom does that to a lot of people, Harry thinks, senseless. Tom did that to him-

Hermione. His mind flits to the last time he saw her, face damp and terribly, horribly, confused, her hair making an explosively bushy aureole around her face.  He can’t even begin to articulate why he’s avoiding her, only that this farce of normality is suddenly desperately important for him to keep up, and he knows that if he spends even more than five minutes in her presence, her or Ron both, he will spill his secrets in gasping confessional and she will see the emptiness in him where once dwelt the light of passion, Gryffindor-gold and bright as a star.
They bring in the tattooist- a slim, balding, man with a wand as thick as a thumb.  He avoids the eyes of everyone there and refuses payment (Draco also thinks he may have urinated in his pants, by the smell of it).
Maybe he’s always been like this, that- maybe the illusion of Harry was superfluous, extraneous.
When I graduate, Harry tells himself, I will embark on an enormously, embarrassingly, long trip spanning the entirety of the magical world.
Think of your family; think of your friends, who are quite worried for you. I believe Ms. Weasley, in particular, told Severus off in a quite spectacular fashion, with a rather magnificent Bat-Bogey Hex.

(About Kreacher- his opinion of Harry seems to have changed drastically.  When he hears that Harry has, for all intents and purposes, decided to cut ties to the Order, he is begrudgingly hopeful; when Harry aimlessly begins carting the ‘Dark’ artifacts back into the places they belong, fingers moving out of intuition, realigning the webs of energy and snapping things into place, Kreacher lights up, when he sees Harry examining the Black family wards and working his blood into them, he is ecstatic.  Funny, really, the change in attitude, the change it wrings on the house.  The dingy, grimy, house is bright and opulent now, Kreacher cooking meals in freshly washed cotton; Harry barely notices it.  Everything is gray, God, he just- he can’t - it doesn’t
“Well, prefect? You have me at your mercy now,” Harry says, smirking slightly, and they can both tell he doesn’t really mean it but Malfoy snickers anyway, drawing in on himself and tipping Harry a half-smile.
He leans in instead, closer to Malfoy, nostrils flaring as he inhales the spicy, expensive smell that hangs around him.  He wants to open his mouth, wants it in his throat, wants to choke on it.  He smiles, instead.
“He wills, Master Harrys, Master Lucius has paid for the bestest of healers for hims” Jinx assured him and when he saw that Remus was confused, he quickly explained about Dobby. The werewolf looked thoughtful his fingers running over his chin.
“You will learn in time, I will hire another tutor to teach you about the wizarding world, but there will be time for that. For now let us just focus on other things” Lucius hummed finishing the chocolate humming “You will enjoy yourself with Narcissa and Draco. I wish that I could come with you tomorrow but I should imagine that I will be having meetings all day, I will like to be there when you see the healer though”
“You would, my dragon, for all of five minutes and then you would throw up. You must remember that you have extremely bad ocean sickness”
“I will have to bow out on seeing them. They have never reacted well to me” Remus muttered flashing a sad smile and Harry reached out to pat his hand trying to comfort him but not really knowing how. “The Cheshire cats don’t like me very much either”
“I’m fine Boris! You go have fun and prove that you really are Boris the Brave” She said and slowly Boris the Brave made his way down the castle stairs and out into his courtyard where his horse was waiting for him. The groomsmen laughed as they tried to get him on the horse...Harry dear? I think it’s time you were in bed once again” Narcissa chuckled closing the book as both Harry and Draco struggled to keep their eyes open.
“Hodie par puero usque ad formare” Lucius recited pointing his wand at Harry as he drank the potion down. He had expected it to taste awful but instead it had a sweet tanginess. A warm bubbling started collecting in his stomach and quickly spread throughout his body. It was like having pins and needles all over and he was glad that he had been allowed not to have his magical brace on.
“You don’t need to apologise…” Draco sighed rolling onto his side now and lightly running his finger over his forehead avoiding the scar which still looked a little swollen and red. Harry sighed happily at the touch feeling rather like a spoilt kitten. He had discovered that he liked being touched and craved it. After years of only getting beatings a gentle touch was something wonderful for him.
“Perhaps I shall, okay, we should begin learning more about Merlin”
“Like in the song Harry...On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me...” Hermione put in quickly very glad that she had been able to say something and Harry opened his mouth again but stared at the tree before speaking;
“I told you that I had tutors instead of going to school, Madam Ninomiya is witch from Japan. She is very skilled in magic but unfortunately, she isn’t allowed to teach me that! But I am sure you will like her, though she has a rather dry personality and can be very sarcastic when the mood takes her” Draco explained and Narcissa let out her little bell like laugh.
“That’s a few weeks away, right?” Harry asked, he’d read all the reports in the newspaper and followed on the wireless, but he hadn’t been to a game in ages. He was always too tired after working in the field and wanted nothing more than a night in in front of the fire or when he wasn’t working a night out at a club.
“Wakey, wakey little Master Harry, youse is being wanted in the Drawing rooms” Jinx said, and Harry gave a breath and reluctantly pulled himself out of bed. On his bedside table was a collection of items that Ernest had found for him. A quill, a bottle of ink that had rolled under the bed and he hadn’t been able to reach. A sock, a glove that he was positive he had lost in the maze at the back of the Malfoy house. It was strange to see the items there waiting for him every day, but he had gotten used to it. The first time he had woken to a dozen or more lost items he had been scared until he had remembered the Brownie and had quickly gotten some milk and honey and wrote a little thank-you note. Draco had promised that it wasn’t needed, and Pansy had laughed, but Harry liked to be polite. He rarely saw the Brownie about the manor during the day, however at night he acted out the stories of Boris the Brave in Shadows on the walls along with snow white for Pansy. “I has gotten the Milk and Honeys for the little Ernest, Little Master, Harry”
“I’m sorry Mr Weasley but the hat has spoken. Not all those in Slytherin house are bad, that is a foolish and narrow-minded view of the world.” A softly accented voice spoke from the head table and Harry saw that it was the black-haired woman that he had seen when he had Draco had come to visit. From her position at the table, and the way all the older students had fallen silent, Harry knew that this was the new Headmistresses Madam Sinistra. She had the sort of timeless beauty people had painted in Rome or Greece with plump lips and a ebony colour to her skin. Her lashes were dark as though she was wearing make-up and her hair was coiled up high. She looked young to be the headmistress of a school, but his Dad had told him that looks could be deceiving. Sinistra had been taught at the French school of Magic Beauxbatons and was skilled in the art of Astronomy. “The Hogwarts tradition of the sorting hat is a long one and not once has it misplaced a student…”
They grabbed their jumpers and the robes the Malfoy’s had brought them for Yule. They were almost identical though Draco’s had a grey fur lining, and he had a deep green. Both had swirling emblems with their initials on the front with an owl and a peacock. Narcissa had stitched them herself each stitch perfect and the threads shimmering different colours as they caught the lights in different angles and Harry couldn’t stop touching it whenever he was wearing it. A silver clasp fastened the robe closed and Harry shivered as he felt a pulse of protection magic settling over him. Remus had been the one to weave the magic into the fabric and he could feel his papa’s magic circling around him like a warm blanket. As always, he smiled and then had his hand taken by Draco again.
"Marvellous job of secret keeping, Potter," Draco said. "Did you invite Skeeter around for tea too, or is that next week?"
He painted the walls green, like trees and grass and open space and freedom, and — not having any clue where magical babies got their furniture from and not having anyone to ask when the baby was still such a secret — he went back to Mothercare and splashed right the fuck out. Getting it out of the shop and home again was a bit more of a puzzle, but if the cctv picked him up wheeling a trolley into an alley filled with bins, then they sure as anything didn't pick him up coming back out again. Then he played a magical game of magical flat pack creation, and the world gained a little more anger and Harry gained a lot of perspective on how Muggles felt when they came back from Ikea, and afterwards, his nursery had furniture and about sixteen different bags of baby clothes, and his future had a baby in it, and everything was really terribly odd and backwards and upside down.
"We were drunk," Harry said miserably.
Hermione raises an eyebrow. Harry focuses almost entirely on watering his plants. He has the window box to water, and the plants on the shelves by the window.
Harry found himself back in Basingstoke the following evening, but this time he had a menu for a local takeaway in his hand and his new book in his bag.
Draco looked at him. "I can't stay."
"Just the sofa," Harry said. "Twice."
Harry's fingers twitched. "What?"
"Good," Ron said, and passed him a chocolate frog. "You can have that for afters now."
"We've been looking for you for months," Ron said. "And all the time you're here, with him?"
"You did once. Well, twice."
"Not a decision to under-think," Draco said, but he was already closing the door, and Harry couldn't be sure if he'd seen Draco's face crumple, or if it had just been a trick of the light.
"Yes," Harry said. "But let's not throw stones, you knew it was a risk and you didn't stop it either."
"That one was all Draco," Potts says. They don't make eye contact. I'm not sure if he's telling the truth.
Harry wanted to weep. "Ours," he said. "Even if you don't bring him up, he's still ours. He'll always be ours, and you can change your mind."
"Aren't you worried there won't be any room for you anymore?" Ron asked, when Draco came in from the market with Sheila and deposited a paper bag on the table in front of Harry with a small glossy ornament of an otter on a grassy bank inside. Narcissa was coming over for lunch later. Hermione was outside in the garden, putting up a bird table with Tommy.
"I've finished them, and anyway, I'm not sure our residual trauma allows them to be categorised as 'adventures'," Draco says, although by this time he's back in his bedroom and the door's mostly closed. "And I think a Timmy of our own might be better protection than any crup, if these books are anything to go by. Although I always did want a crup, growing up. For company. We could get a crup, though."
"Making people sleep in the shed is weird, Hermione," Ron said.
Sometimes, Harry would glance over and see the line of his throat or the tilt of his chin and remember how beautiful Draco had looked that night, bathed in moonlight and breathless under Harry's touch. How beautiful he was now, pregnant with their child, his hand curved around his stomach. How Draco didn't want to be a part of seeing their child grow, and Harry had no choice but to respect his wishes because it was all he could fucking offer him.
"So long as the conversation whilst we eat is anything other than babies."
"Good," Harry said, because he'd got as far as laying out the quilt Molly had made for him on the floor and laying Jonny on it, and not much further. He succumbed to temptation and curled up next to Jonny on the blanket, letting him grab onto one of his fingers and hold tight. There was a selection of toys in easy reach, but Harry contented himself with just booping Jonny on the nose with his fingertip, which Jonny seemed to like — or at least, not actively hate. At this point some of those emotions seemed one and the same.
"I don't know," Harry said. "I don't know what to do."
Hermione snorted. "Oh god," she said. "You're going to be a dad."
Harry didn't know what to do, so he leaned in and pressed his mouth to Draco's. "I promise you I'll look after him. I swear it."
"Oh my god," Harry said, and went into Draco's living room to sit down heavily on a black and chrome sofa and look suitably pained at the idea of never having eaten pizza.
"It's not okay," Ron called helpfully from the kitchen.
"Do you think we should talk about names?" Harry asked, when he was sprawled on Draco's uncomfortable sofa and picking miserably at a bowl of pasta and pesto. He saw Draco a couple of times a week or more now, and he liked it. They ate food and watched Draco's Muggle TV and Draco lectured him about the right way to chop an onion or buy cheese or what cut of meat went into which kind of meal. They couldn't talk about anything important so they talked about food instead, and it filled the time and kept them busy and bickering and at some point it would all be all right and Harry would feel like he could breathe again.
Draco just looked at him. His face didn't something a bit weird that Harry didn't properly understand. "I won't," he said finally. "I haven't."
, which now has a four month waiting list for appointment slots. Malfoy highlights his tattoo experiences on his Instagram page; not counting the rather gruesome skull and snake he sports on his left forearm, his seven other tattoos are all courtesy of the elusive DT. He is, entertainingly, terrified of both needles and the experience of getting tattoos. Despite already sporting his skull/snake combo, he practically has to be held down for his first tattoo with DT. The camera keeps rolling. He documents his fear unflinchingly and at the end, there's a lion tattooed on Malfoy's right forearm. The accompanying TikTok comes with a soundtrack of Smooth Criminal. It's a compelling insight into the power of editing, given that the same content hits like a 180. The fear's gone. It's just bravado. I ask if Harry Potts edited it.
"Because I can't. Because me wanting him doesn't change the truth. I'll be bad for him. My name will be bad for him. It's not like people want me around now."
"Not if they deserve it," she said, and smiled at Harry.
"Not like this," Harry said, because Draco had starved himself of magic for months and months before Harry had found him, and the dark mark still had its power. It needed magic to function, and so Draco had starved himself of it, but it still hadn't given in.
"Properly sorted," Harry said. "Swear to you. The baby could come tomorrow and it'd be all right."
"There's an appointment," Draco said, "on Thursday."
Harry came over and sat on the arm of the sofa, ignoring Draco's pained look. "You're not going anywhere, are you? You'll stay here, with us?"
"Right," Harry said. He picked at the threadbare patch on his jeans. "Draco Malfoy?"
Draco just looked at him. "I have a private healer, and I wasn't inviting you. I just…" he looked a bit tired, and maybe flushed. "I wondered if you'd like to hear the outcome. I could keep you up to date. If you wanted to keep a record."
"Of course you are," Harry said, and closed the door, yelling through it, "Come back when you're sober, Malfoy."
He found himself in Mothercare on a Saturday morning, looking at tiny t-shirts and tiny skirts and tiny socks and tiny toys and small, baby-sized furniture.
"You're lucky I love you," Harry says, and Draco holds out his hand for Harry to take. "Agonies, what on earth."
"Yeah," Harry said. "Maybe because I'm more scared than I've ever been in my whole entire life that you'll walk away and I'll fuck this up. I always fuck it up. I don't know anything about people. Turns out I don't fucking know anything about anything, do I? Got you pregnant cos I didn't know shit."
"That's worked so well for us so far."
Ron glanced at him. "Malfoy's never going to let that happen. It's well important to them, innit? Babies and stuff. The Malfoy name."
"I'm perfectly capable of providing for myself."
Later, much later, Harry woke up to hands in his hair.
bodysuit' and felt one thing, and then another thing. He didn't know where to put either of those feelings so he shoved them into a dark recess somewhere at the back of his brain.
"Why not?"
Harry ignores Pansy's pointed eyebrow. "Good," he says. "It's good."
"So how are you two going to divvy up childcare?" Hermione asked, settling down into the armchair with a glass of rose. "Have you started talking about it?"
"You're not still planning on going abroad, are you?"
Draco's living room turned out to be just as oddly anti-Draco as the rest of the flat, laminate flooring and black and chrome sofas and a coffee table. There was a single bookcase and then, even weirder, a Muggle television set.
"Love you," Draco said softly. He'd been asleep before Harry said it back.
It was not entirely Harry's fault that so far adulthood was not turning out quite how he'd imagined it.
Harry nodded. "Yeah," he said. "I made it myself."
Draco didn't look at him again. "I'm sure," he said, and Harry came and placed his hand on Draco's stomach, and felt his baby kick.
Draco looked at the mango. "What are you," he said, probably to Harry, but still staring at the mango. "Why are you."
"Hi."
The thing is, Harry reasons, angling the camera, is that he's the happiest he's ever been, too.
"It's not," Draco said. "I shouldn't be here. I can't be here."
This time, Draco smiled back, and Harry couldn't look away.
"Are you certain?"
"Great," Draco says, and then throws his phone at Harry, who catches it one-handed, without much thought. Draco's undoing his robe. "Will you take some pictures of this?"
"I've never fallen on his dick when I was drunk," Ron said.
"Huh." Harry sat down on the sofa and set about unlacing his trainers. He didn't usually bother but Draco seemed the kind of person to have inside and outside shoes. "Any particular reason why?"
Draco didn't let go of him, not when the healer was examining him, or when they were putting up the screens, or casting the spells to minimise the pain.
"Not that you fell on his dick," Ron went on. "More like the other way around, given the, you know, baby, and everything."
Pansy raises an eyebrow in Harry's general direction. Harry busies himself misting the leaves of his rubber plant. He's not sure if it needs misting, but it keeps him busy.
"Yes," Draco said. "I'm sorry. I'm busy right now. We should arrange to meet up and make arrangements."
"Jonny Potter," Draco said, and he turned his face away, pretending to reach for the salt. He wiped his eye on his sleeve. "Not Malfoy. He doesn't get my name. My name stops with me."
"I need a book," Harry said, without bothering with hello.
"Do you?"
"I'm not sure she knew you could write."
"I know," Harry said. "Do you think he's all right?"
Draco came over and tilted Harry's chin up so he could kiss him. "If she's terrible, let's make her change Jonny's nappy."
"You're such a pleb," Draco said, but he stood back and let Harry into his hallway. It was a neutral beige hallway, with laminate flooring and silver hooks on the wall for his coats and cloaks. If Harry had had to pick any place on earth for Draco to live, it wouldn't be here. He hadn't really noticed the decoration either of the other times he'd been here, but then he'd had other things to think about.
"Great idea," Draco said. "Although I do have some lingering questions about why you've brought me a mango."
Draco looked at him then. "We can't be," he said. "Because I can't walk away from another friend, Harry, and I've got to walk away from this. I have to. And I can't look back, so please don't ask me to."
Draco frowned. "Is it possible," he said carefully, "that you don't have a clue what I'm talking about?"
"Oh my god," Hermione says, as if neither of them can hear her. "Why are you like this."
Draco was in a jumper and trousers, a little loose around his stomach. Harry couldn't tell if that was baby or just the fit.
"She hasn't wanted to be friends with me for ages, why is that going to change just because we've suddenly got a baby," Draco said, for about the fiftieth time. "I don't know why I invited her."
Draco looked at him. "Harry—"
Draco just looked at him. "I'm very pregnant," he said.
"I promise," Harry said, because Draco needed him to, and because Draco hadn't slept. He went to get Draco some pyjamas, and then came back into the bathroom to help him out of the bath and get dry. Then, for want of something better to do, he put Draco to bed in his bed, and stayed with him until he fell asleep.
Draco looked down at the carpet. "You said I was beautiful. In your letter."
, which allowed him to spread wallpapered greenery around the room to the green background of his dubious paint job. He had little bookshelves and little drawers, and far too many baby clothes that had tiny animals all over them. He'd bought all of it from muggle shops, still wary of someone discovering his secret, and only vaguely because he still had no idea where to get magical baby stuff without raising suspicion.
Draco was dying. Everybody knew it. Hermione brought Sheila and Tommy to see him every day. Draco's beloved animal figurines were laid out on the bedside table.
"Haven't you ever read, I don't know, anything?" she spluttered, whilst Ron sat in the armchair by the fire and shook his head a lot. He was grinning, although this was more to do with Hermione's exasperation being directed towards someone who wasn't him than the situation in general, which didn't offer too much in the good news stakes.
"Well you've fucked that right up the wall," Hermione said. She was bright red, which meant she was about to explode.
Their baby. Their son.
Harry did, but only because he had no fucking clue what else he was supposed to do.
Harry gave in to temptation and leaned in to kiss Draco's forehead. It wasn't something they'd done when one of them wasn't overflowing with emotions that they didn't seem to have the capacity to deal with, so they stared at each other for a moment, before Draco blushed and turned his attention back to their baby.
"It's weird," Harry said. "I love him, probably more than anything I've ever loved in my life, and at the same time, I feel like my heart's broken."
"No," Harry said. "I don't think I'd ever for one second considered what it would be like to leave him there and walk away. For him to say
Harry lifted their joined hands and kissed the back of Draco's hand. It felt like an odd thing to do. He'd never done anything like that before. "I think sometimes at school there were rumours. About what it was like at home when I wasn't at Hogwarts," he said finally. He felt Draco's stutter, rather than heard it. "I have no idea how to show him he's part of a family. I have no idea how to show him that he's loved. You're trusting me with him but I don't know what I'm doing."
"It's my turn to look after you for a change," Draco said, and Harry broke down and sobbed.
"The baby," Harry said.
Draco looked like he might bolt. Harry just kept holding his hand out, trying not to let his terror show on his face.
"Did it work?" Harry asked, when it became clear that Draco wasn't going to say anything else.
The fucking on the sofa with the curtains open had sort of happened by accident, and it had been all right, if unexpected. It had been followed by the rain stopping and the clouds clearing, and Draco's very audible "
"You could also have cleaned up after breakfast like you said you would," she said.
"Hermione will be pleased."
, and at the time of writing, sport 1,254 stories detailing their inevitable relationship culmination of a happy ever after. Rumours abound about the nature of their relationship, particularly on Twitter and Tumblr, but neither Malfoy nor Potts comment on it. Potts wouldn't; he doesn't have social media. "I just use Draco's," he says. "I edit his pictures."
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Our full moon error," he said. "Perhaps we should have this conversation when you're less… deshabille."
Ron brightens up. Draco looks into the middle distance, suitably moody, which means he's excited for a 99. Hermione rolls her eyes.
Harry drew his knee up to his chest. "Why don't you just stay?" he said. "He's our son. There's space here. Why don't we just… see how it goes?"
"Save him," Hermione said, and Harry hadn't begged, but he'd wanted to.
"Like how babies are made." Draco didn't do the decent thing and step back out of the way to let Harry into his flat.
It does something queer to Harry's insides. He pops the feeling to one side, like always. Hand holding and protestations of flatmate affection aside, their relationship remains, as always, mostly on the friendship side of things. Draco shares his bed most nights, but that is, unfortunately, genuinely a case of him needing his photos edited and having actual cold feet because of his refusal to ever wear socks.
Draco's jeans are unbuttoned and hang off his hips. They're too long and he walks on the hems as he turns to face me. I can imagine my mother telling me to pull them up. I think Harry Potts would rather Draco Malfoy's jeans stay exactly where they are. I don't judge him. I couldn't. I feel the same.
"We absolutely did," Harry agreed, and then, very slowly, quite awkwardly, he leaned in, and pressed his mouth to Draco's.
. And then, lastly,
Draco also looked a little green, but Harry rather suspected that was an overall aesthetic choice rather than abject nausea, although under the circumstances it could very likely be both. "It was raining," he said. "And overcast. And I was very, very drunk."
"The Malfoy family is no place for a child," he said. "I cannot promise this child any future beyond the childhood I had. And I won't subject another child to that."
"One Direction?" Draco says, his gaze somewhere over Harry Potts' shoulder. "I know what makes me beautiful."
The Weasleys adopted Jonny as one of their own within four seconds of meeting him, which meant that Harry was relieved of childcare duties for a few minutes, and also that he could let himself be hugged by Molly and bundled onto the sofa in the living room for a bit of a sit down.
Harry rolled his eyes. "They're not going to tell anyone."
"Um," Harry said. "Didn't I say?"
," Draco said, more insistently this time, and when Harry turned around, Draco's legs gave out on him, and he stumbled, then fell.
"It was evil," Draco says. "How come we never had midnight feasts at school? They're frying sausages in this one."
Lonely and desperately sad, Harry thought. Desperately, desperately sad. "All right," he said.
There was a moment where nothing happened. "Were you intending to?"
"You make me happy," Draco said. He was tired and weak and every time he fell asleep, it was for longer. One day soon he was going to fall asleep and not wake up. There was a long, long pause. "Do you think they'll find anything?"
Ron looks, with more than a little consternation, in the general direction of the roomba. "How much of a monster is it?"
"I'm building up to going back," Harry said.
"We just haven't done anything about it because, like, we're tired and we have to look after Jonny."
Draco poses, and Harry takes a picture - Draco, moody and looking at the kitchen door, all pale skin and cheekbones. Pansy rests her chin on her hands and leans over the back of the sofa to watch.
"It's very tiny," Harry said. "Right now, it's really tiny."
"Hullo," Harry says, going inexplicably pink. "And yes, in the kitchen."
The Draco Malfoy I've met today should be in direct contrast to the Malfoy in his videos, the one that hid behind the sofa when Harry Potts turned the Roomba on by remote whilst Malfoy was mid-greenery decoration, or the one that woke Harry Potts up in the middle of the night bellowing "What is that monstrous beeping?" and when a mostly-asleep Harry said,
Harry, who was half way through warming up a Marks and Spencer ready meal because he'd had to do a last minute trip to Mothercare for more nappies for newborns because he was scared he didn't have enough and still didn't know where the fuck to buy baby stuff that wasn't fucking Muggle, looked relatively bewildered. The possibilities at this point were a little bit endless. "What have I done now?"
"Where's his wand?" Ron asked. "He's not got it on him."
"They're stupid," Draco said. "I know it."
"Yes," Ron said. "That."
"Don't come back until you've sorted this out," Hermione called, through Harry's own front door.
"That's what happened the first time, isn't it? Happened by itself. By the light of the moon and all that."
Draco nodded, and didn't quite meet Harry's eyes. "Tea," he said. "Go through to the living room. I'll bring the tea through."
"Is this for his Instagram?" Hermione asks. "You're not putting a crup on the internet, Draco. Stop pretending the Statute of Secrecy doesn't exist."
"Sometimes I wonder how you're going to manage to sustain life."
It was another few weeks before Harry picked the room at the back of the house for the nursery, and according to his book, the baby was bigger than a pepper. The nursery overlooked the garden, not that the garden was much other than an overgrown space where occasionally he went out and hacked the most pervasively overgrown things down, but at least it was nature, and Harry was of the opinion that babies should see nature. He'd mostly seen his aunt and uncle's over-manicured lawn and the front garden with its competitive borders and neatly strimmed edges. He wasn't entirely sure that that counted, but he had also been forbidden from playing anywhere where the neighbours might see, so that had rather limited his interaction anyway.
"He doesn't deserve this," Harry said, which wasn't an answer.
"Molly?"
"Great," Hermione said, and allowed him another helping of lasagne, which he ate even though it should have stuck in his throat. He hadn't seen Draco since that time he was in green silk pyjamas, and that had been over a month ago. "Might not have to buy you a shed for your birthday after all."
"He won't bite," Harry said. "No teeth."
"Stay," Harry said. "Just stay. We'll sort it all out later."
"I shouldn't have assumed you hadn't sorted stuff like that out."
Fuck, he was going to have to get a babysitter if he ever wanted to sleep with anyone ever, ever again, although given on the experience he'd had between the ages of 22 and 28, that would come to six nights and about eight hours of human contact, so maybe a babysitter wasn't entirely out of the question.
"I don't know why," Draco says, lighting another cigarette in between takes. He's graduated to not even buttoning up the jeans we're photographing him in. They cling, like a temptation unto heaven, on his narrow hips. I feel dazed. Harry Potts looks dazed. Our photographer keeps taking pictures even during our breaks. A tattoo taunts us, just the glimpse of something more, curving out from the waistband of his underwear. I feel like a changed man. "It's probably luck."
When Hermione and Ron came over, he kept the nursery door closed, and when Draco came over to keep him updated about his appointments with his healer, Harry kept meaning to tell him, but he never quite found the right moment.
"John," Harry said. "Something like that?"
"You came," Draco said. He was flushed and sweating, his labour not that far progressed.
"How is it possible that neither of you thought to pay attention to the moon cycle?"
"It wasn't," Harry said. Then, "I don't think I knew I loved him before this."
"He's my son," Harry said sharply. "He's my son and I know how I'm going to look after him, so get off my back."
I can't help but ask about One Direction. Just in case.
Hermione just looked at him like he was stupid. In this case, he actually was.
"No," Draco said. "I've never been around one."
"You didn't know that pregnancy was a risk?" Draco asked, once Harry had been to the library, marinaded in his own fear and horror for a day or so, and then shown up on Draco's doorstep looking faintly green. "Are you an idiot?"
series, despite featuring frequently in their own greenery decorating slot. I ask if there are plans to feature the decorated Roomba, and take the opportunity to remind Draco that his biography across all his social media is
When he looked up, Draco was watching him, eyes wet. "Is he all right?"
"I think we should get a dog," Draco says, on his way out of the living room.
For a moment, everyone around the table went some shade of fuchsia.
It resonated through Harry's chest. It hurt.
"So, there we are," Harry said, neatly avoiding meeting Hermione's eyes.
Their baby kicked again, and Harry stepped back, and out of touching distance. He didn't look away, and neither did Draco.
He went home with Jonny the following day, cradling him close and already fiercely in love. How was it that his heart could simultaneously feel like it was shattering, and growing exponentially to encompass everything he felt for his son?
, depositing a bottle of wine into Harry's waiting arms and shrugging off her cloak. Ron followed her inside with a cake box.
"I didn't—" Harry said. He let out a breath. He hadn't told them that Draco didn't want this baby, that he'd be bringing it up alone.
“I’m good, decided on Hogsmeade for the sanctuary. Draco convinced me that I could make it bigger.”
“This is all to just to get Harry ready to correct the damage done to him, even magic has limits, Lord Malfoy, and the body is a complex thing but if you follow the course of potions you will be in good shape for Hogwarts in a year” He said his tone having a touch of a promise about it and Harry gave a very small smile before a knock on the door wiped it away. The clearing of a throat followed as the door opened.
“There! Look! I can see one!” Pansy shouted pointed as they reached the Cheshire enclosure. She bounced up and down and then ran towards a large purple cat that had a large head that seemed to be grinning showing off a large number of teeth. “They are so cute! Look Harry! Quickly, He’s vanishing!”
“Draco will you do the honour and be mine?”
“Perhaps, sadly there is sometimes even limits to magic but I’m sure the healer will be able to have a look, so should I send for the healer tomorrow...Dear the floo” Narcissa sighed and Harry almost screamed as he looked at the fire and saw the disembodied head of a sallow man with a large hook nose and dark eyes looking out at them.
ALMOST! Almost moving the plot along! The Dursleys will not be dealt with until First Year of Hogwarts…I know its very unlikely that James would want Snape over Black but it’s just as unlikely that Lucius Malfoy would read bedtime stories and allow Harry to call him Luci xD
“You’ll have to wait and see. Only a week till the party, ne” Nino winked grinning happily as she stayed settled in her chair sipping from the little coffee cup that she had been given when they had first entered which kept refilling itself as she emptied it. “Kingsley was telling me that he would be attending with his daughter Mbali”
“It’s only a game and I’m quick on my feet, I had to be with the Dursley’s, so I will be alright” Harry promised talking in a low whisper and Draco bit on the inside of his cheek fighting down his anger at the mention of the Dursley’s, it was something that he was getting good practice at doing, and he nodded at the plan.
“Hello, Irish” Pansy smiled prettily from where she was getting out of helping with her own trunk by playing around with her new owl. Pegasus was a pure black bird with eyes so orange that they looked red. Nobody could really tell what kind of Owl it was, but the seller had insisted that it was fully trained postal owl. The demon bird had already gotten on almost everyone’s bad side by bringing a live, very ruffled emerald green grass snake to the breakfast table the day before. The snake was currently curled up in Harry’s trunk wrapped in several layers to keep it warm. It was, for the most part, unharmed but it had insisted on going to Hogwarts with them.
“No, so long as Remus and Harry are on my side.”
“Good morning, Dad. Nino…” He said causing the Japanese teacher to let out a sleepy grumble as she tried to smile. Severus gave a small chuckle at her actions and then smiled at him. It wasn’t as wide a smile as Harry had grown used to from the man, but it was filled with warmth and love.
“You will not be. Harry will be glad to have a friend of his father’s staying with him. Though it will be harder to keep Harry’s identity a secret once you are staying with us” Lucius spoke softly his hand once again on Harry’s shoulder silently asking him if that was okay. Harry have a smile and a nod. “As for employment, what do you currently do?”
“Master Draco’s room hases lots of Broomes and posters!” Jinx said happily guiding Harry to sit down in one of the chairs while clicking her fingers. Two bottles of Butter Beer appeared and Draco moved from bed to sit in the chair opposite his friend. Harry was wearing a pair of Draco’s pyjamas spelled to fit him and his hair was even more of a mess than it had been all day. His feet barely touched the floor and he had an unbelievably cute feeling all around him. Draco had never thought of himself as the protective type. Like comforting somebody he had no idea how to be protective. It wasn’t something that was needed much in his circle of friends. None of them needed either very often as they were all as self assured as he himself and yet there was something about Harry that called to him. There was no great distance in their ages, a month at most, but oddly he felt the older of the two and he wanted to look after him.
“My hero!” Harry almost drunk giggled as Lucius playfully three several snowballs onto his back instead of Harry. The Malfoy’s and the Potter-Snapes had been playing a rather long game of snowball for most of the afternoon and without warming charms Draco was sure he wouldn’t be able to feel his toes. As it was, he was feeling incredibly warm and he grinned rolling off his friend before ducking into their fort which was a carefully constructed igloo. The rules of the game stated that once in the base they were free from attack.
“I want to believe you, Harry, but Lucius Malfoy is not somebody that is linked very often with Kindness. But to see him with you, it is a whole new side to him”
“Draco” Harry said pointedly using his first name as he jerked his head in a bow the French hens forgotten as he watched Draco walk away the invitation heavy in his hands
“Hogwarts here we come!”
“No! Not at all! Uncle Sev is amazing”
Narcissa had expected as much, her son was so like his father in more than looks. Lucius had confessed the same sentiments when they had had a moment alone together confessing that he wished he had done so before informing the aurors concerned that Dumbledore would use his fame to get off. That was the problem with her hot headed men, they were far too flashy, she had never been so. She knew the art of patience. The Dursley’s would get what was due to them, Dumbledore too, but they had to be careful and to be seen to be playing the game. The actions of her husband had tarnished the Malfoy name and they wouldn’t survive a public judgement, not against Dumbledore.
“With the way you were talking I can assure you I am already awake” Lucius hummed opening one of his eyes slowly and looking at him. There was a sleepy smile on his face which made him look so much younger and carefree. He sat himself into a more comfortable postion and stretched out his back. “It appears that young Harry is also awake, good morning”
“Gringotts, it was robbed…Or broken into…”
“I’m unsure, mummy and Daddy were saying that we might head to America for a week or two” Pansy answered with a half shrug. “When are you thinking of going to Japan?”
“Wow, you got a right ugly bird there, Pans, what the ‘ell is it? A bat?”
Stay Safe <3
“It appears that you have used it yourself, my boy, for Harry to know...”
“…I found out that I liked having sex with men…” Harry hummed quietly, and Draco almost choked on the whiskey he had been drinking. His eyes bulged out of his head as he stared at the saviour of the wizarding and muggle world.
“But…He is a Malfoy…They were on You know who’s side…They are all slimy snakes.”
“You will know him before you marry, we are allowing you to do that by hosting three balls, Dragon” Narcissa, the most beautiful woman in the land sighed looking to her husband who was absently reading through a letter he had received. Lucius looked up as he felt her stare and looked to his only child with a raised blonde eyebrow.
“You okay, Harry?” Draco asked with a smile squeezing his hand and Harry felt like he had gotten his answer and squeezed back answering with a smile of his own.
The doors opened with a wave of a hand and they all swept in, passed the four long tables that had all the other years staring at them, and down towards the long teacher’s table. Draco’s eyes immediately searched out his godfather who was sitting on the far end with Nino on one side of him and a wizard wearing a turban on the other. His thin lips curled into the smallest of smiles while Nino was almost bouncing in her seat looking beautiful as always in a flowered kimono. In front of the head table there was a stool with a beat-up hat sat upon it and Draco watched as a split near the brim opened and the hat started singing
“Professor…Have we met somewhere before? I feel like I know you?” He hummed aloud before he could stop himself sitting in the chair that had just appeared in the space opposite Remus.
He has been really struggling with his mental health with this whole coronavirus thing and it would mean a lot. Thank you 😊
“Mr Black-Potter” Narcissa said briskly clapping her hands together. “Mrs Figg, Healer Hinchcliffe would you like a drink?”
“No, Draco and his parents are here” Harry whispered in a small voice and Draco had the urge to gently take his hand again and give it a squeeze. Harry looked at it and then swallowed moving further into the room. Mrs Figg was an ancient old woman wearing carpet slippers and a floral house coat. Her hair was in curlers and yet her eyes were bright and quick as she looked them over.
“How dare you! You legilimency on a child! What horrors did you force him to watch!”
“You do realise that its Christmas tomorrow, don’t you?” Draco asked and although he knew what his lover was worried about, he tried to defuse the situation by making a joke of it.
“Um, I dunno, the will was actually a voice recording as was mum’s letter to Uncle Sev’ so yours might be the same” Harry remarked and Remus pulled out his wand and muttered a spell causing the letter to glow bright green for a moment or two.
“You didn’t. Guess you’re excited…After today you will be…Harry James Black-Potter-Lupin-Snape…Wow…That’s a mouthful maybe we should just stick with two? Potter-Lupin?”
“You are my friend, Jinx and I don’t like seeing you upset” He said happily hugging her a little while longer before letting her go and pushing open the door to Narcissa’s room. His strange family were waiting for them amongst the flowers and Harry noticed how Severus’ eyes moved over Remus looking to see if he was upset. Draco dropped the pruning sheers he was holding for his mother and came running over to him his arms wrapping around him tightly.
“Yes, I had to fetch the wood”
“Oh! You don’t have to! I was just...You just asked...I’m okay with...” Harry spluttered his faint flush growing as he tried to explain that he hadn’t actually meant that he wanted to go but had just been answering Draco’s question. “Sorry”
“Yes, thank-you, you sir?”
“That is a Peryton” Severus answered with a warm chuckle “They were all but extinct in both captivity and the wild until Newt Scamander started the breeding programme. They are thinking of reintroducing them to the wilds around Hogwarts in the coming years”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I see, but that is a good thing, you wanted to see him that is why you wrote to him, isn’t it?” Severus asked casually and Harry nodded slowly, that was true, he had sat down and started a dozen or more letters only to toss them into the fire.
“I do, that is why I told you, without fear. He was abused, mother and father think physically as well as mentally and emotionally. We do not know the full horrors of what he has gone through” Draco paused for a fraction knowing that Severus probably had a good idea after rifling through his memories. He felt hot with anger as he remembered the scene and he wished that he had kicked his godfather hard on the shin before forgiving him. “As mother is his next of Kin she has been given rights to take him as her ward while the matter is being handled by the Aurors”
“Wandless magic, or natural magic, is raw unfocused, learning how to use it in that state is hard, rather like trying to catch an entire storm in a teacup. Everyone has the potential to do it but why when it is much easier and more effective to use a wand to focus your magic?”
“It was one of Dudley’s old ones. It was gross when he had it, but he had stretched it all out and Aunt Petunia was trying to get it on me…”
“Um…It’s…It’s…It’s something to do with the Dursley’s” Harry whispered almost falling into the open chair by a roaring fire. The springs squeaked in protest of his harsh action, but they supported his weight easily enough. He chewed roughly on both his tongue and the inside of his cheek and tried to swallow the sickeningly large lump from the back of his throat. He loved Severus and Remus. He really did but he couldn’t stop the horrible thoughts that came to him, even now, that told him they were sick and wrong. “Please, don’t be angry with me…”
“I can well believe it, and I should think that they deserve it” Pansy gave a devilish smirk her blue eyes flashing as he leaned over in her chair whispering “If the muggles survive your mother it sounds as though they deserve Azkaban, perhaps your mother could arrange for them to be introduced to her sister? I’m sure she would love to play with them”
“Yes,
“I promise, Harry, I will come and fetch you myself” Remus promised him gently both his hands on his shoulders as he peered into his green eyes with his warm amber ones. “And I am sure, if you need a little break your dad will let you use the floo on a weekend to come home. Even if it’s just for an hour or two.” Harry let the warm words wash over him and he smiled and nodded jolting when a loud whistle sounded. “That’s the bell, you will be fine, Harry! I will write to you, have fun and study well!” Remus pressed a kiss to his forehead and then he was given another kiss by Narcissa who hugged him tight.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hadrian, Draco, this is Lee, the third coolest student in Hogwarts”
“Yes, very much like a policeman. You are not in any trouble, but I need you to tell me, is what Lord and Lady Malfoy saying true? Did your relatives harm you?”
“Harry, I consider myself truly honoured and happy to be called Dad. It is a title I never dared dream I would have but if you would like to bestow it on me then I will do my uttermost to be worthy of it”
“I believe I will write to the Squib Harry mentioned in his letter, perhaps she will be able to explain more about him” Narcissa hummed her perfectly made up lips touching the golden rim of her fine bone china tea-cup that held her name sake flower on the front.
“Potter...Welcome to Madam Malkin’s robes for all occasions, sorry we were just about to close for lunch”
“A werewolf?”
“Of course! We’re awesome! Come on, let me show you again!”
“Right…Yes…Okay…” The young heir sounded stuffy and stiff, but he stood as tall as he could and moved towards the four Chimera, all three of their heads looking at him.
“I would like a plain vanilla, Remus?”
“You saved me! I will help you Boris!” Boris startled at the offer of help from the little bat, but it was lonely in the forest alone and scary when the wind howled.
“I understand that” Chuck shrugged once again clearing his throat when he realised his voice was too high. “May I have some water?”
“Would you like to go to the theatre with me next weekend Draco?”
“The Goblins would even refuse the ministry, lawless lot, hem hem” Umbridge sneered leaving Harry perplexed about Goblins. He looked at Draco but the young blonde seemed to be lost in his own thoughts and wasn’t looking at him but at a painting on the wall. Harry followed his gaze and was startled to see a young man of about 19 with hair as black as his own his eyes on the other hand were a deep sky blue looking like marbles Dudley had played with as a child. He had tried to force Harry to eat one once and it had gotten lodged in his throat. He didn’t remember much after that until he was on the receiving end of a punch to the stomach by Vernon. The force of it had dislodged the marble and he had gasped for air. The young man in the painting stared at him for the longest time and then motioned for him to listen to what was going on around him.
“It’s a beautiful house”
“It is amazing. Magic is a wonderful thing”
“I believe we are ready to begin. Severus Tobias Snape, you have been entrusted with the son of James Fleamont Potter and Lily Jane Potter nee Evans...Will you add your blood to the potion to make Hadrien Junius Peverell your child?” Lucius asked as Narcissa stepped forward holding out an ornate knife.
“Yes! Absolutely! Coming right up!” Robertson yelled weakly clearly wishing he hadn’t bothered to come into work today and Harry wondered what Severus was like at school. He had clearly left an impression on the young man who looked as though he might have just graduated and was doing his first job. “One chocolate, one vanilla, and one Banana…That will be 6 sickles”
“Okay! I can do this!” Harry said happily looking at Draco who beamed at him.
*-*-*-*
“You are most welcome, Harry, now, I will leave you to your celebrations” He said, and Harry smiled bobbing himself while keeping a tight grip on the presents he had been given. When Kingsley had vanished, the next person came to stand in front of him. It was Jinx. She was grinning broadly and holding up a messily wrapped box that seemed to have airholes in the sides and on the top.
“A time turner could work, I suppose. He could perhaps have had the meeting in his office over heard the prophecy and then realised he could use it to his advantage” Severus answered though he sounded a little doubtful. His throat sounded raw from the harsh tears he had been crying but he looked physically more in control of himself again.
Harry blows his whistle, calling them to the ground.
It’s simple, familiar, really- the cane, the cursed silver - but the Dark Lord watches this time and Draco cannot show an ounce of weakness, so he does not cry out like he wants to when the cursed silver-side of the cane strikes him upside the ribs, when he feels the bruise blooming, spreading.
- but healing magic
There’s a flash of red hair through the window to his right, and Draco turns to see Weasley, Granger, and the girl Weasley struggling to through the mud.  A smile curves his lips; he murmurs a quick eavesdropping spell.
Well, let’s not discuss that topic any further.
Anyway, Muggles and their wars, there are so many of them.  And poetry- Muggles have better writers, that’s for sure.  “Twist me a crown of wind-flowers,” he sings, and he doesn’t know why but it’s beautiful.  Draco twirls his wand absently, drawing a creamy flower wreath into existence.

There is a written language, Parselscript, which is full of curves and sinuous accents; he studies the alphabet furiously and manages to memorize it in two days.  Spells incanted in Parseltongue are more powerful; words spoken in Parseltongue are generally more truthful (snakes don’t lie, after all, and Parseltongue functions like a low-grade Veritaserum.  Draco resolves to practice lying in it as soon as he can; he can’t afford not to).

At some point, Dudley wanders back into the house, plucks a peach from the fruit bowl, and wanders back out, banging the door shut as he goes; the sound makes Harry start, almost dropping the twig.
He curls up on the damp, dew-furred, grass with his wand clutched so tightly in his fist it feels liable to snap.  He must have broken past Dumbledore’s magic somehow- he doesn’t particularly care, all that matters is that he has it now.

slipped backwards, because although he knows the exact improbability (it’s a tally and sum of every interaction, every sneer every hiss every glare every action and its equal, opposite, reaction, there is most likely a precise number he could put to each side but he won’t) there is no animosity in Malfoy’s gaze; he meets Harry’s wondering eyes evenly.

“Dumbly-dore…Hoggywarts!” The elf squeaked its voice gravelly from lack of use but already he seemed to be radiating with happiness. His oddly shaped limbs moving slowly as he tried to bob into a bow. “Dobby knows you sire! Youse is a great mans!”
“I...I don’t know, but you did! If it was pity Potter...” Draco snapped pulling his reluctant eyes from Potter’s cock to his face once again surprised to see that the short arse was laughing at him. Potter actually had the nerve to sound amused when he asked;
“I doubt his family helped” Narcissa put in thoughtfully her delicate nose wrinkled in distaste a sight Harry wasn’t overly familiar with. Narcissa was brought up with breeding and could always be counted on to see the best in everyone, or at least pretend to, for her to show dislike so openly had Harry thinking that Chuck’s family were as bad as his own. “I have met Loretta a few times, a rather brash American who often mistakes loudness for personality, she has not an ounce of true talent in her blood but had people convinced she was as powerful as her grandmother”
“Yay! Well done!” The green-eyed boy beamed at him flashing white teeth and Draco flushed happily preening under the praise.
“Nope, Pansy was here a few minutes ago though and said that she would fetch them”
“Sorry”
At eleven o’clock sharp Harry entered the Malfoy’s ritual room which was where all serious forms of bonding had taken place for years. It was very much like a muggle chapel in the stately homes only more ornate with golden statues and white marble peacocks on either side of a marble altar which held a goblet filled with the blood-adoption potion.
“Indeed, she will. You read the story of Ytuen?”
“Very nice to meet you, sir”
“Dear Harry, before I go any further and forgive me if I am over stepping the bounds of our tentative friendship but what did you mean when you wrote ‘Locked in my cupboard?’ Your relatives keep you locked in a cupboard? I highly doubt that is normal sleeping arrangements for muggles. You can tell me that it is none of my concern but I would hardly let such a statement pass” Harry groaned he hadn’t meant to write that, Draco probably thought he was a freak now and like Dudley and his gang he was probably going to laugh about it behind his back. It had been going so well and now he had ruined it. However Draco’s letter continued and Harry kept reading surprised that the rest of the letter was much the same as their others had been.
“Draco, I have repeatedly told you not to use rude names for your friend. I have heard from Pansy’s mother that they will be in America this week and that Pansy will be coming to stay with us for the next month or so.” Narcissa scolded very lightly knowing that the name was just a fun nickname and that Draco truly cared about his female friend. Harry was still surprised at how little time Pansy spent with her parents, it wasn’t as if they didn’t love her, but they were both extremely busy and Pansy preferred to be with the Malfoys than staying by herself in hotels or holiday homes by herself. “Though we won’t be staying in the UK. We will be finally be taking that trip you wanted Draco…”
“Dragon, if you want to go to the zoo before we must return to the manor you must hurry” Narcissa hummed softly when they seemed to have finished and for some reason Harry was surprised when the face of a clock appeared in front of her. It cast a silvery glow against her face telling them all that it was already half two. “Forgive us for rushing off, we have an appointment for five that we simply cannot miss. Pansy are you still coming with us to the Zoo?”
“Keep your nose out Diggory, I bet your boyfriends would be pissed if I messed up your pretty face.” Blackmore snapped back his fists clenching tight. Diggory gave a very small smile that was fake but caused dimples to appear in his cheeks. “What are you laughing at pretty boy?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are we allowed?” Harry asked shyly his voice on the verge of vanishing and Draco cursed his distraction and moved closer to his nervous friend. He took his hand in his and Harry shot him a grateful smile his green eyes flashing more brightly than Masaki’s and Draco realised he was wrong Harry was the most beautiful guy he had ever seen. And wasn’t that a weird thing for a ten-year-old to think about his best friend. Masaki nodded happily saying in a loud voice
“Yes Narcissa”
“Golden Robes?”
The last thing in the box was a thick looking envelope with a wax seal over the flap. The imprint in the centre was of a dragon and Harry smiled running his finger over it before he lifted it up and pulled out a slip of folded paper. It was written in the same hand as the front of the package and he carefully opened it out and started reading.
“That was quick”
“What happened last night? When we were being taken to Ravenclaw he was still refusing to go with the Slytherin prefect.”
“Okay, let’s go”
“He just...Just showed me my memories” Harry answered, his voice raw and muffled against his arms and Draco shifted closer to him on the bed. He wasn’t completely sure how to soothe somebody. He had never had to do it before but he wanted to comfort Harry and reassure him if he could. “How did he do that?”
“He became a magi-zoologist. He learnt to control it and you will too, I just think we need to let you know that nobody is going to hurt you, or shout at you if you do anything freakish, in fact we are going to celebrate it…”
“You don’t have to go that far, Sir! You must already be very busy! You are a teacher after all!”
This story was meant to be darker but then I lost my boyfriend and my dad and well I wanted fluffy plus I had to establish this version of the Harry Potter world and since they were not in the 'real world' but the safety of malfoy Manor I thought that they would only really be exposed to people on their side... Now they are at hogwarts the threat will become clear...
“They are. A strange mix of stag and bird, they came from Atlantis. They are shy creatures for the most part, but they were known for helping the stranded witch or wizard out of the forest if they asked politely. Or perhaps I am being romantic again, Sevvie?”
“Afraid? No, surprised, Yes…” Severus admitted “However there are many reasons for it. The Potters are an old family…We will think about it later”
Christmas at Malfoy manor was nothing like Harry had experienced with the Dursley’s. For starters they didn’t call it Christmas. It was the winter festival and it lasted for a full twelve days. Each day started with a small gift left on the end of the bed. Harry had been completely shocked to wake up to a present with his name on it. It was wrapped in gold paper with silver stars that twinkled like Christmas lights. There wasn’t a senders’ name on the card, but he carefully unwrapped the paper while Draco tore his off with excitement. Inside was a small set of brass weighing scales, like the type Severus used to weigh out potion ingredients. These were engraved with his initials H.J.P.S on the base of the scales and Harry loved them. The next gift for the second day was a set of weights all shaped like Hedwig. Third was a sleek box with a lid and compartments for potion ingredients and the fourth was a dozen vials for potions. The fifth gift was a mortar and pestle made of polished black stone that had flicks of gold and silver running through it. The sixth gift was a pair of dragon hide gloves and a pair of silver handled scissors. The seventh gift was a set of rare potion ingredients all in glass bottles with intricate labels. On the eighth day was a box full of clothes and shoes. Ninth was a set of fiction books all based in the wizarding world and the tenth was a beautiful portable writing desk, complete with ink and quills, his name engraved on the front and Harry ran his fingers over it reverently. The eleventh was a photo album filled with pictures of his parents and even some of him as a baby. His eyes prickled with happiness as he looked at the faces, he didn’t remember them, but he knew in his heart they loved him. Draco had had him put one in a silver frame.
“With his father I am sure he will be a natural my heart, I will watch over them” Lucius said with a chuckle pressing a kiss to her cheek. Draco was genuinely surprised and happy to hear that and he grinned at Harry who looked startled but pleased.
“If I may, I couldn’t spend a moment longer with Roman, why does mother enjoy the company of such dullards. Daddy isn’t much better, he is always chasing boys half his age!” Pansy took Draco’s other arm in her own her eyes rolling slowly.
“You won’t know until you meet him, there is only a year left, now come we are almost at the zoo, Harry where would you like to go first?”
“Pixie birds, they are mothers favourite kind, they are almost extinct in the wild now and Mother loves butterflies, father always buys her trinkets with them on” Draco laughed holding out his hand and a black and orange butterfly came and landed on his finger “But in her mind nothing beats the real thing”
Once he had washed and dried the dishes, carefully putting them away and avoiding all Dudley’s attempts to get him to drop them Harry went out into the garden. As always his aunt was wearing the only pair of gardening gloves though she just stood over him with her hands resting on her narrow hips. She would chat happily to neighbours when they walked passed but otherwise she only spoke to bark orders at him. His aunt kept him working in the garden all day, he was only allowed one stop to use the bathroom and he used the time to take some water from the tap to drink before having to go back out and clean out the shed.

“Yup, Harry is as ruthless as a flower petal. Same as Draco”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Professor Filius Flitwick of Hogwarts” Dumbledore said straight away and Narcissa nodded in a sort of agreement. The charms teacher was somebody she would have probably requested as well as he was one of the best spell casters in the country. Tormuld looked thoughtful but then nodded with a sly half-smile that nobody seemed to notice. He moved around his desk and then threw some floo powder into the fire that was burning without giving heat.
“Draco Malfoy…Harry Black-Snape, Fred and George Weasley, and Miss Pansy Parkinson”
“I...”
“It’s been good. I don’t think I like herbology very much though.” Harry admitted dropping gracefully into the sofa beside him and Severus lifted an eyebrow.
“I...Better...Thank-you, I’m sorry for being so much of a fuss” Harry whispered flushing brightly under the looks he was being given from both the adult Malfoy’s. Lucius hadn’t spoken but he seemed just as happy as his wife that Harry was now awake.
“Remus…”
“Very well, show the way, Mr Potter” Lucius gave him a smile his demeanour and dress reminding him of the heroes from the period films aunt Petunia liked to watch. Harry had never been allowed to watch them himself but he had seen bits through the gap in his cupboard door.
“I was just…I still get surprised, I mean, when people sound like they care about me. Fussing over me not wearing socks or slippers” Harry shrugged, he was getting better, at least he thought so, however it was slow going and sometimes he couldn’t hide the absolute glee he felt when his dads or the Malfoy’s treated him as though he was something to be looked after. “The Dursley’s would make me clean the gutters in the rain, if I got sick, I had to hide it. They only cared that I was dressed because it wouldn’t have looked good for the neighbours”
“If one of you may take the children away with my house elf we will happily explain everything” Narcissa said calmly all of her anger seemed to have gone and the female auror gave a nod to her partner moving forward as Narcissa called for Jinx. Harry gasped loudly as Jinx popped into existence  and Draco tried to reassure him but it all felt rather flat. Everything was happening so quickly he was disappointed that he was being sent away but he could understand why. “Jinx, please take Draco, Harry, and the auror...?”
“Thank you Mr and Mr Weasley” Severus’ tone was a lot sharper than it normally was and when Harry turned to look at him he saw he had righted himself to his full imposing height and was staring out at the class with his unyielding, onyx eyes. His thin lips were curled around his teeth and Harry noted that all the students fell silent and shuffled to their places behind their desks. “You heard correctly, Hadrian is my son, he will be starting Hogwarts in the new year and Draco is my nephew. I would hope that you would show them kindness while they are in class today. Hadrian, Draco since you are here you should work with them on the potion we will be doing today. Mr’s Weasley I trust you will keep my son and godson safe”
“Uncle Sev’ I would be extremely happy if you would want to blood adopt me” Harry said gently moving over to the man and placing a hand on his arm. Severus looked at him through the curtains of his hair his eyes, dark and unfathomable. “But I can understand if you wouldn’t want that”
“No, unfortunately I have to speak with some of my Slytherins.” Severus gave a pinched sigh and then ushered them through the portrait before heading in the opposite direction.
“He asked if I would mind, I lack your skill, my beloved, but it made for a welcome break from the tediousness of paperwork” Lucius shrugged with a smile as his wife plucked the book from his hand and then sat on his lap with one arm wrapped about his shoulders. It was a warm, cosy scene and Harry liked it very much as Draco’s arm slipped around his waist. “Harry said that he enjoyed it. But I suspect he was merely being kind, I am sure we would all rather hear you read, my love”
“Ytuen is a special woman and I’m sure your daughter will do her proud” Harry said, and Kingsley gave a beaming smile clapping him on the shoulder.
“Dragon, please don’t look so sad” She whispered cupping his cheeks in between her hands and Draco gave a long sigh shaking his head. His fingers brushed over the note against his skin. “Come the ball is starting and we have to be there to meet our guests”
Harry’s eyes bulged out of his head as they entered a small dining room, which was still larger than the Dursley’s living room kitchen and main hall. Three of the walls were plain stone two with windows looking out over part of the garden that seemed to have a pathway marked with pretty white flowers with yellow insides. They were a small flower and highly unremarkable compared to the other flowers that surrounded the manor and yet when they were all grouped together it gave a beautiful display.
“I didn’t have bad dreams”
“But that won’t stop them from figuring it out. You just have to trust them”
Harry felt Draco’s hand slip into his as they walked down the corridor of the bank. They were going in a different direction to when he had arrived and Harry supposed they were going to the main area of the bank. He had been there once briefly when they had first come to inquire about his account manager and Harry had been blown away by it all. He looked sideways at his friend hoping Draco didn’t find it strange that he wanted be with him forever.
“Father is fine, Mr Potter-Lupin-Snape! Nobody was hurt and nothing was taken, the vault had already been emptied, the letters are just routine! However, I will let father know you asked about him!” Flitwick gave him a huge gummy smile and then handed over the schedule and map and Harry took it with a relieved smile of his own. As Nino had told them they had Defence against the Dark Arts first thing with Hufflepuff, and he smiled glad that the friendly teacher would be teaching them. Chao-Xiang had noticed the same thing as she let out a pleased gasp.
“I didn’t even know you existed. I didn’t know anything about my parents until Draco wrote to me. The Dursley’s told me that my father was a drunk and a dead beat and he and mum died in a car crash...”
“What?” He gasped and Draco shrugged nonchalantly grabbing his cup from him and putting it down on the bedside table.
“Thank-you for attending” Severus said smoothly a little stiff in his body while Remus was smiling brightly at his side.
“Thank-you, take these gifts to show that you are no stranger to our home, so you know that if you or any of yours need shelter you will have it here under our roof…Please douse the yule log and take away the past year” Lucius said formally as was required and the Malfoys’ and Potter-Snapes bowed at Kingsley as he took a jug of water Narcissa offered and then moved to the fire. He doused the flames and then removed the still smouldering log before placing some of the coals he had brought and lighting a new fire. “Thank-you, please have a drink of wine and toast the coming year with us…”
“Why? Why did you turn your teacher’s wig blue?” Nino laughed as she asked her eyes twinkling brightly with amusement and Harry felt his cheeks blush. At the time he didn’t think he had turned it blue, but then he hadn’t believed in magic, thinking about it now though he could remember how upset and angry he had been with the man and how stupid his wig was.
“When? When you got sick? I wasn’t embarrassed, Harry, I was worried. You looked like you were about to faint”
“You’ve got leaves in your hair, looks like a regular old birds nest...” the woman chuckled turning on the doorstep and almost tripping over the cat that was standing there. “Freddy, what have I told you, gonna break my neck one of these days, come on in...”
“Using legilimency on a child, Dumbledore?” He hissed softly and although he blinked Dumbledore gave a smile his head cocking curiously to one side.
“You do realise that by being with you my reputation will be in tatters?”
(See the end of the chapter for
I know that for ten year olds Harry and Draco seem…A lot older but I think they have both had to grow, they are immature about some things though…I hope that this doesn’t suck >.<
“Wow!” Draco and Harry said together and Tormuld beamed showing all of his sharp teeth though it was a friendly smile. It vanished when a knock sounded on the door an Harry almost choked on his sweet as he sucked in a breath. Lucius gently thumped him on the back while the door opened and Dumbledore came sweeping into the room wearing bright orange robes with suns and runes on them. His long fluffy beard was tucked into his belt and he was beaming with his eyes twinkling brightly as he looked at Harry. He attempted to get close but Jinx pushed him away with an invisible burst of elf magic.
Later that morning after breakfast both boys entered the study where Nino was waiting for them. She was dressed in a butter yellow kimono style robe with her hair tied up away from her face in a bun. She gave them both a smile and motioned for them to sit down at the desks.
“I don’t know much about either team though”
“I would and Remus…I don’t know him as well as I would like but…You think he is a good man and that is all I need” Harry said certainly in almost the same way his father had done in the will but only in the opposite direction. Severus covered his hand with his own, the long potion stained fingers gentle on his skin his eyes continuing to search his face before he nodded.
“Why did you leave me? You came as a teacher, you were nice to me, why couldn’t you...”
“Forgive me, but I must admit that I am at a loss, Harry, but I promise that we will figure it out, don’t fear”
“It really is! I wonder if any other Parsaltongue learnt to speak with Dragons.” Rolf hummed from over where he was mixing a rich vegan stew with a large handled wooden spoon. Harry gave a shrug, there was very little known about Parsaltongue, the only other speaker had been Voldemort and he wasn’t on to let in on his own secrets. For Harry it had made sense, after going to China and realising the Chinese dragon was more serpentine, he couldn’t resist trying to talk to it. The language hadn’t been the same, but it had been enough for him to understand and eventually learn to speak to the western dragon. The first time he’d tried in Romania had been with Norberta, Hagrid’s former dragon. The dragon had been surprised to say the least, but she had remembered him as being there when she was a hatchling and she had eventually agreed to teach him to be more fluent. That wasn’t to say every dragon wanted to talk to a creature that was basically food, but a few did, and it gave them an insight no one else had had. “I wish I could talk to Dragons!”
“Nice to meet you Harry! My name is Ninomiya Kazumiko” She said with a thick accent holding out a small, chunky hand to shake his while also bowing. “Draco has told me a lot about you in the last ten minutes”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I will try” Harry said weakly attempting to give a smile but he knew that it didn’t quite reach his eyes. Narcissa’s eyes softened even more as she moved forward and pressed a light kiss to his forehead over his scar as she whispered;
“No, Draco is just doing his best peacock impression” Harry answered continuing to grin and although Draco thought he should be offended he was just happy he had made Harry laugh.
“Visions?”
“Can I really stay here? In this beautiful house with Draco?” Harry whispered in wonder clearly not believing it and Draco gave a nod happily saying;
As Remus had predicted the Kelpies were under the water but there was a glass tunnel you could walk down. Harry stayed close to his father’s as they suddenly appeared underwater looking out at what appeared to be the bottom of a lake. The signs told them that it wasn’t only Kelpies but also Grindylows and Kappa swimming around as well as a fish called the faux mermen who technically wasn’t an exhibit but more of an employee who would clean the glass and make sure the other creatures were in tiptop shape. The fish had the lower body of a koi but the upper body of an almost humanoid. The strange little creature kept swimming to the glass and pulling faces before cleaning algae with a yellow coloured cloth.
“You’re welcome, how did you come to be in the Forbidden forest?”
“I don’t attend school. When I go to Hogwarts next year it will be my first time in a school situation, I was home schooled by some of the best tutors mother and father could get. Of course I have not been taught magic but mother and father gave me their old school books to read and Severus gave me a children’s potion set for Yule one year. It only included some none dangerous potions but Mother didn’t like me using it unsupervised. She can be such a worrier. I should tell you that she has written to Mrs Figg about you but don’t worry it is just formalities.
“Oh, I’m sorry” Harry mumbled feeling embarrassed that he had assumed that it would be the same in the wizarding world as it was in the muggle one. He felt so completely out of place here and he was sure that the Malfoy’s would grow tired of him for not knowing anything. As it was Lucius gave him a gentle smile his grey eyes warm as he stole a square of chocolate from Draco’s bar. He perched himself on the arm of the chair saying;
“Thank-you, but you’re more impressive! All those languages!”
“I want to kill them” Her dragon whispered suddenly speaking for pretty much the first time since the healer had been. A glance to her left told her that Harry had fallen to sleep his body held at an unnatural angle because of the brace.
“Prat”
“Traditionally it was a celebration of the last harvest before winter” Remus explained softly as Harry and Draco sat in the library one Friday afternoon. “Winters were bad and very few people had enough to eat. So, on Samhain eve the children of those that didn’t have enough would go door to door offering to give a favour for a treat. Part of the food that was given would be cooked and served in a feast on the day of Samhain”
“I...Okay...” Harry nodded seemingly only just realising that he hadn’t yet let go of Draco’s hand. He dropped it quickly as though he had been stung pale cheeks turning red as he stepped back into the house and motioned for them to follow.
“Draco, you are soon to be of age. It is expected for you to marry as soon as he too comes of age”
On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me...
Warning for past child abuse
“Jinx only makes the best” He commented looking at Harry hoping he was enjoying it. He had calmed down after Jinx had talked to him but he had also fallen silent and was just staring at a biscuit. Mentioning Jinx however seemed to revive him as he asked;
“You should” Remus agreed but didn’t make to remove his head from his arm and Severus didn’t try to make him. He supposed that he could breakfast here and then head back to Hogwarts for his first lesson. The bed was extremely comfortable after all and Remus was warm pressed against him. As if knowing what was going through his head Remus chuckled again and pressed back against him and Severus knew for sure that he wouldn’t be leaving. At least not yet. His eyes once again resting on the peaceful face of the werewolf he let out a contented sigh. Soon he would have the weight of the world on his shoulders again, there were plans to be made, Horcruxes to be sought, but for now he wanted to enjoy a peaceful moment with his…Lover. “You’re thinking very loud, Sev’ you’re ruining what should be a perfect moment…What is going around in that big brain of yours?”
“Yes, for all her madness, Bella was closest to the Dark Lord and if he confessed anything it would be to her” Lucius looked uncertain now his blonde eyelashes furrowed as they looked into the face of his wife. Narcissa pressed a light kiss to his wrinkled forehead and tucked his hair away from his handsome face. The pair, who always seemed to be so aloof and cold in public, proved once again how devoted to each other they were.
“It would still make him your legal heir Severus, and heir to the Prince line” Lucius hummed taking Narcissa’s hand in his to stop her from digging into the palms. The ancient head of the Weasley family had a lot to answer for, for placing such a curse and for not knowing how to break it. Their land and titles had been stripped from them but the fact that they could have so many healthy children was a sore spot for the Malfoy’s. Severus shrugged at the mention of Harry being his heir, he had never thought that he would have one having decided to pass on what monies and titles he had to Draco when the time came.
“Um...It is really good to see you, Harry, I was worried when Dumbledore had said you had left your aunt and uncle, not because I think you should go back there, Lils was very vocal about how you were not to be left there...” Remus hummed giving him a sad smile and Harry felt his anger prickle as he almost growled out;
“Boys, this may sound a little strange and I can’t honestly say why as of yet, but I want you to be careful around Professor Quirrell. I knew him when before he took his sabbatical, and he was always a little highly strung, but I can’t escape the feeling that he has changed somewhat. It could be the worries of a former spy but until I know for certain I want you to be careful.” Severus said stopping them as they reached the door and Harry looked at Draco with a raised eyebrow before promising his dad that they would be careful. “Good, now off you go to dinner, I will see you there.”
“Draco, this is my good friend Brutus” Masaki grinned introducing the large male who took a step forward and began pawing at the ground with odd shaped paws. They looked like lion paws but there was a touch of hoof about them.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Nice to know you could fit us into your social life.”
“Professor Flitwick, is your father well? I have just received a letter from Gringotts about the break in…”
“Very well” Severus slipped his wand into his holster and stepped back holding out his hand to help him up. Draco and Harry started clapping loudly as the butler elf popped to Narcissa’s side. He bowed low, his crooked nose pressing to the floor as he said pleasantly
“Now Harry Dear, travel by floo is rather jolting the first time you do it so we shall go through together” Narcissa hummed after cooing over the boy and smoothing out his hair. She hadn’t been completely successful but it was better than it had been when he had first presented himself to her to have the clothes he was wearing shrunk. She knew Lucius thought her a mother hen and perhaps she was but there was something about the black haired waif that made her feel particularly maternal. She loved her Dragon with every fibre of her being however he had never really needed her and he still didn’t like her to fuss over him but Harry, starved of any positive attention for so long wanted and welcomed it and she wasn’t going to deny him. “I have told the Parkinsons that you are my cousins child sent to stay with us...It is better than to have them ask too many questions, however if you want to tell them then it is completely up to you of course”
“A pear tree?” Harry Potter frowned as he sat at the Gryffindor table on a cold and wet December morning. The elves had just sent the food up from the kitchen and the mail had arrived with a large bulky package dressed in cheerful red and green paper. The owl that had brought it was unfamiliar but he had opened it easily enough surprised to find a glass box containing a miniature pear tree dressed with pretty ribbons. The base of the pot was white and blue fine bone China with the serpent Dragon flying around the base. “Who would send me a pear tree?”
Please forgive my lame history of magic in Japan I just wanted Harry and Draco to learn a little wand less magic
“Me too. I had just got home from our last meeting and Dumbledore was waiting for me. He told me that I was the lord of Privet and that it was my duty to marry the prince. I tried to run away several times but then…The Weasley twins. They showed me the portrait of the Prince” Harry flushed brightly white teeth biting at his lower lip “You never told me you were the prince!”
“Draco Malfoy”
“Right” Harry agreed with his friend but he was personally glad that it was only a daydream, he didn’t really think he suited a life of piracy.
Harry sat crossed legged in the bush of Mrs Figg’s front garden. He had a rare day off from chores and had been told to get out of he house. He had only managed to have enough time to grab one of the books from the mysterious Draco and it happened to be Hogwarts: A history. At first Harry didn’t know what to make of it, it was written as though it was a real place but it talked about magic, spells, and potions as though they were all real things that could be learnt at the school Hogwarts.
“What steps?”
“I see”
Sorry! I powered through to write this, it was the spark I needed, and I hope the next part will be better and will be quicker in coming out!
“No, you were having fun, Draco. It’s silly to stop. I just need a drink. I’ll be back in a few minutes…”
“He is, I’m really happy for you, Gin,”
“No! But…The Dursley’s they said horrible things about gay people…And it wasn’t just them…” Children had uttered some pretty nasty things in the playground to. The major insult for Dudley and his gang was ‘Fag’. “They said that they were disgusting but my dad seemed to be happy and fine with it and your parents”
“But, what if I can’t stay? What if the Dursley’s get me back?”
“You!” She hissed as they reached the gate her bony finger waved at Lucius “You attacked my son!”
Then he went to sit in the nursery with their son, and fell asleep in the armchair with one of Jonny's blankets draped over him to keep out the cold.
"This is the greatest day of my life," Draco says, rolling over onto his back and holding the magazine up in Harry's general direction. "The greatest day. I no longer suffer from agonies. I am agony free."
Draco had been moved to a different room, and Harry didn't know where. He was doing fine, the healer said, healing well and on the way to being able to go home. Harry hadn't ever asked if he had somebody to look after him when he got there. Or when it was he was going to leave to go abroad.
"It's not too late," Harry said. "Come say hello to our son."
"Coming up quick," Ron said. "You figured out where you're going to put the cot yet?"
"You said," Ron said, and by mutual, silent consent, they walked down to the river and dried off a bench so they could sit and watch the rubbish float by and pretend it was nature. "But, like, you know. The rest of it."
Of all the things to be felled with,
"Done," Harry said, and tried to hide the relief from his face.
"Harry," Ron said sharply. "What's going on."
"What is happening," Ron says, almost without inflection. "What is happening, and why is it happening to me."
"Let me know if there's anything I can do to help."
"We're going to have ice cream," Harry says. "If that helps."
"Glad I've finally satisfied you." There was a moment's pause as they both stared at each other, and Harry contemplated the fact that there were three of them in the hallway and not just two. "You can hang your cloak up there. Would you like tea?"
She didn't say,
Draco pressed a kiss to Jonny's head. "Yeah," he said, and cradled their son close.
Harry woke up one night to Draco's hand in his hair.
"Jonny Potter," Draco said. "Your baby boy."
"Loungewear," Draco said. "I didn't actually expect anyone to apparate directly into my living room. Usually guests come via the front door."
Tommy hovered in the doorway, quiet. He held something in his hand, a tiny, bubble wrapped package. He patted it into Draco's palm. "For you, son," he said.
"It's your baby, Harry," Hermione said.
Draco's expression was clearly wavering between bemused and vaguely enthusiastic.
"Hermione came to see me," Draco said, when he was feeding Jonny his bottle and Harry was making them both cups of tea.
From the sofa, Pansy makes some kind of strangled
"I have no idea," Draco said, leaning past Harry to take his cloak off the hook and hang it up again, but tidier. "Didn't you?"
"Don't need a bath."
"Why not?"
Harry nodded, and then turned to look out of the window.
Harry wasn't entirely sure what he was supposed to be keeping a record
"Definitely," Harry said. Hermione and Professor McGonagal had been leading the research into Draco's illness, into the complex magic that underpinned the dark mark and its mastery, and how it gained its power, and what Harry had missed when he'd offered Draco a new bond instead. "Hermione's the smartest person I've ever met."
"Put the boarding school stories down, Draco," Harry says. His exasperation is mostly faked. He's continually charmed by Draco. It's terrible. "Anyway, the light's shifting. If you want me to take any pictures it had better be soon."
He found him in the living room, curled up on the sofa with the blanket over him, a little knitted octopus that Molly had made for Jonny tucked up against his chest.
Draco's private healer had a cottage hospital on the south coast, near the cliffs. Harry thought he could hear the sea.
Even now, when Draco was with him, when he was safe, even now when Draco was so tired he couldn't keep his eyes open and his fingers shook around his cup of tea, when Harry had to cut his food up because he couldn't hold a knife steady, Harry kept thinking about Draco's room.
"You haven't got any," Draco said. "I know all yours. You're not the brightest spark, you had no idea wizards could get pregnant, and you think you can feed babies cheese."
But Draco hadn't stopped shivering even after the kettle had boiled and Harry had made them both some hot chocolate. He was so pale, with dark shadows under his eyes and his cloak thrown on over his pyjamas.
Ron made a face. "Hold up. How do you think Charlie had Maja? Did you miss the part where he was pregnant?"
Harry considered telling them that Draco wasn't going to be bringing the baby up, but it just didn't seem the right time. Draco had been inconsolable in his kitchen, sitting at the table and crying through half a packet of ginger biscuits and two cups of tea, and Harry hadn't known what the fuck to do except to keep boiling the kettle.
Potts is, at least partly, responsible for Malfoy's unscheduled arrival on social media just over a year ago. "He wanted to know what the teenagers were doing over the other side of the road every evening. He was busy smoking out of the window and looking moody. So I bought him his first phone."
"Nice place you've got here," Harry said.
"I don't have moonlight activities."
"What?"
"I won't," Harry said, and Draco didn't let go of his wrist. "I promise I won't."
"Yes," Ron said again. "They start out that way."
Draco turned his head away, and refused to hold him.
"No," Harry said, because there were more now, more that Harry had found in little antique shops and charity shops and the second hand market he'd used to visit with Draco. "They make you happy."
Harry pulled him inside and out of the cold. It was freezing outside, and Draco was barely dressed for it, shivering in his cloak even as Harry wrapped the blanket around his shoulders and pulled him into a hug. "It's okay," he said. "It's okay, Draco."
"I don't fucking know," Hermione said, "how about quitting your fucking job and not telling us?"
"I'm so disappointed in you," Hermione said, pulling open the cupboard door and chucking a cloak at him. It was his old one, and not quite broad enough across the shoulders, but maybe it wasn't the right time to comment on Hermione's sartorial choices. Harry put the cloak on. "You can't pretend this isn't happening, and you can't leave Draco Malfoy to go through this alone. This is your baby and your responsibility."
She headed into the kitchen for a bottle opener. "And Draco? How's he doing?"
"Oh, for fuck's sake," Draco said, still crying. "I hate you." There was a pause as he produced a neatly folded handkerchief from a pocket in his robes. He blew his nose. "I thought you said there were biscuits."
"We should charge entry fees," Draco say, tilting his chin up in Pansy's general direction.
"You like Tumblr," Draco says, unbuttoning his shirt a little and running his fingers through his hair. Harry is suddenly breathless, not that Draco seems to notice. "Where else would you get to reblog all those She-Ra gifs?"
"I want you around. Jonny wants you around."
Draco slept in the spare room the other side of the nursery, and they met in the middle of the night over Jonny's cot, both of them woken by his fierce little cries.
, but at the same time, he was fairly convinced that he should be. "That would be nice," he said finally, and if Draco refused to meet his eyes for the rest of the evening then that was completely normal and only to be expected.
There's a pause, as Draco records their exit for posterity, and then they leave, as one, for the park.
"Yeah," Harry said, and tried to smile.
It took everything Harry had to not give in and break in front of him.
"You tell me about Basingstoke," Harry said finally, "and I'll show you the nursery."
And Draco, trembling, cupped Harry's face in his hands and kissed him back.
"She still has her job," Draco said. "But no, we're not exactly friends."
"Fair," Ron said, and went into the kitchen to clean up and - hopefully - make him and Harry tea. "Harry thinks you'll call him an idiot for some reason."
"Not to actual Draco, though," Hermione said. "I don't care who you're in love with, but he actually might."
"Me neither," Harry said. "Unless you count playing with Teddy sometimes."
She was with Draco, who was standing in the doorway to Harry's living room, staring at Jonny.
"They're metaphysical," he says finally. I'm not entirely certain that's in anyway related to what I might have asked, but as I've forgotten the question, I feel somewhat validated by the answer.
It actually began in February, on a Thursday, on a night where Harry got so drunk he could barely see straight, and it just so happened that Draco was matching him drink for drink. They weren't friends; they weren't anything, they were just both in same place at the same time and in the mood to snipe at each other all evening because there wasn't anything better to do. Then the pub had closed. They'd stood outside in the street in the rain, and Harry had said,
"Maybe," Draco said. "I cried all over her for about two hours and then locked myself in the bathroom, so she might have regretted her decision in the end."
His collection grew over the months, tiny little animal figurines from the charity shops on the high street, from the weekly second hand market by the train station. Draco counting out his Muggle money with shaking hands, Harry's arm tucked into his. At the tiny cafe where Draco did a few hours a week, Sheila, the owner, let him have the collection of ornaments that had belonged to her mother, and Draco displayed them proudly. Tommy, Sheila's husband, had put him up a little shelf in their living room just for them.
"I wouldn't be," Harry said finally, rubbing the toe of his trainer against the floor. "Love you, don't I? It's not like you don't know that, I don't know what she's on about. Told you I wanted you to stay, didn't I?"
"Right," Hermione said. "I did buy one that I was going to give you, actually. It's in the bag on the table."
"Bit too late to be thinking about that now, isn't it? It's coming."
"I was too drunk to think about closing the curtains." Harry was being manhandled by Hermione towards his cloak cupboard.
"I know who The Beatles are," he says.
"Is this place Muggle?" Harry asked loudly, without bothering to go and find Draco.
"I didn't want to hurt him."
"Well," Harry said, "I'm going to spend a lot more time thinking about it going forward."
Harry's brain did a helpful white-out at this, which was all fine and dandy until he came back down to earth with a bump and realised Draco Malfoy had dissolved into sobs in Harry's entrance hall.
Draco looked at him then, eyes wide and wet. "I want my son," he said. "I can't have him and I want him so badly. Please, please don't let me see him. I can't bear to leave him again."
I believe him when he says he's learning. The last year has passed impossibly fast, and Draco Malfoy has left no offered opportunity unexplored. Is it greed? Maybe. I ask him.
Draco rolls his eyes right on back. "Come here and read it with me, Potts."
, and somehow they hadn't splinched themselves apparating back to Grimmauld Place.
Ron waited until they were far enough away from everyone that they could speak freely. Harry, ever mindful of beetles, cast a silencing charm anyway, just because he could.
"I've not been fired," Harry said. "I just didn't want anyone talking about it."
"Think about it," Draco said. "There's time."
"Harry," Hermione said. "Thank god. We've been looking for you everywhere."
“My family and my wife’s family. Mine and hers are there” Tormuld looked very proud as he pointed to the twin axes crossed behind him. Harry had thought that their display was a little more elaborate than any of the others and now he knew  why. “First Half-Goblin to get an axe”
“Um. Goodbye” Harry whispered feeling confused as the serpent slithered off to find another rock to lay on and get some heat from. He turned to his parents flushing ever so slightly at the expressions on their faces. Remus looked curious, amber eyes alert and questioning, while Severus was tight his lips drawn together tightly. “Sorry”
“For you, for allowing me to witness your adoption” He said his voice oddly baritone after the squeaking charms teacher. Again, it was book shaped wrapped in brown paper and Harry smiled “It is a book about traditional African magic. There are a few wandless spells within, but I trust that you and Draco will only use them in the presence of your teacher, hmm?”

“Not today, today I am taking my…Harry to the zoo at the tower of London and Lucius has gotten us a table to celebrate”
…Sorry for the length of delay again…Things have been happening, it turns out that my boyfriend had been planning on giving me a ring…His parents found it when they were sorting out his home qnd they brought it to me which broke my heart all over again. I have no idea if it was an engagement ring or just a ring because he thought I would like it, but it is beautiful, and I would have said yes to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, but you’re sort of pretty as one...I mean to some guys...” To everyone close to them at the table they were shocked to hear that muffled confession coming from the mouth of the red head. Harry included. He had been told that he had improved over the year, he had finally gone to the mediwitch and had been given a series of potions to combat the malnutrition that he had suffered. As a result, he had grown a few inches and had filled into his body. With the potions his eyesight had improved and he no longer needed to wear his glasses. In the summer he had asked Mrs Weasley to teach him some spells to mend and fix Dudley’s cast offs but he still didn’t understand why he was suddenly being called pretty.
“Yup”
“I still can’t believe Snape has a kid…Even an adopted one! And Harry Potter!” The boy over the other side of the table said in a rush while his friend nodded in agreement. The rest of the table were listening in but they weren’t be overly aggressive though Chao-Xiang looked as though she were about to fight both of the older boys if they didn’t shut up sometime soon.
“Dobby! Stop!” Harry cried as the elf suddenly started smacking his head on the bed frame his ears waving about in dramatic fashion.
“Are you afraid?”
“Oh! Good afternoon! How are…Bless my very soul, Harry Potter!” The ghost gasped swooping in and peering closer to Harry so he could see the scar. He didn’t quite touch him but still a cold shiver raced down Harry’s front, but always wanting to be polite he carefully collected himself and corrected the ghost.
“An argument?”
“I do hope that the ministry is aware that Harry is the victim in all of this” Lucius said his fingers running up and down his neck soothingly and Delores gave a smile showing small almost pointed teeth. Her eyelashes fluttered at Luicus as though she thought she was attractive.
“You, don’t see your children?” Harry asked not knowing what else to say. Chuck was staring sadly at the photo as he shook his head. His expression cleared slowly as he slipped the photo into the pocket of his coat answering him with a smile.
“No chance, you would have survived, Potter, you’re strong. But there is a real chance you would have been manipulated by Dumbledore and I would have said something stupid trying to impress you and had you hate me” Draco sighed fairly convinced of that but Harry didn’t know anything that Draco could have said that would ever make him hate him. He could be arrogant sometimes, and very rarely he could make him think of a thinner and more handsome Dudley, but over all he tried to be good and Harry knew that he cared deeply. “You would have made other friends and I would have been jealous, and we would have been something stupid, rivals, like Sev’ and your father”
“Sorry, I wasn’t laughing at you…Rather more at what you said…I remember you at school and how you idolised your father, to hear you call him an idiot…”
“Excuse me? But what does this mean?”
“Do you want to open it another time?
“Yes, because we are, aren’t we?” Pansy shrugged looking flippant, however Harry could see that she was nervous about the answer even if she were refusing to show it. Pansy and Draco had only had each other for a long time, neither trusted people much less children that weren’t other death eaters’ so this was a big moment for her. Seamus blinked his mouth opening and closing like a goldfish before he pointed out
“What you got there Potter?” Draco Malfoy’s clipped aristocratic voice floated through the great hall and Harry looked up sharply surprised that the Slytherin was still in school. Normally Malfoy left before all of the other students after all. “Hens? So, it’s true, Harry Potter is being courted? Aww how does it feel Potter?”
“Yes, I’m fine, Professor Snape is going to tell me about my mum” He answered smiling at the professor who smiled back before tucking into the black pudding on his plate. Harry looked away as he ate taking some more of his own food, mostly because Draco had started feeding him, surprised when the dark haired man spoke again.
“It spoke...”
“Harry! Harry is a good kinds soul! He should be saved! Dobby is bad! Dobby is weak! I couldn’ts saves him, Dumbly-Dore!” The elf began to cry loud messy tears as he pulled tightly at his ears looking for all the world as though he wanted to throw himself out of the window for his failure. It was pathetic really, Dumbledore thought, but loyalty like that was useful.
“Good morning, brat, how did you sleep?” Severus chuckled fondly as the small boy yawned before sliding into the chair beside him.
“I have already agreed to fly with the boys tonight, so my office is more than free for use, my friend, but for now, Draco, Harry, it is time for your Latin lessons” Lucius said checking a golden pocket watch from the pocket on his hip and Harry smiled nodding as he gave another look to Severus.
“No, not at all, Christmas is just one day and then they have a new year’s party…”
“Surely…Your house elves…”
“What happened?”
“I will find away. Just as I always do, Harry shall be taken care of” A crack and a smashing of pottery caused the tension in the room to snap and they both turned to see the strange and rather highly strung house elf Dobby in the corner of the room looking with frantic wide eyes at a broken flower pot.
“That’s awful”
“Of course you can, Harry, put them on the desk, but be careful of the bird droppings, Plum doesn’t care where he goes these days” Mrs Figg warned him and Harry gave a nod before tiptoeing through the attic to place his books down onto the desk. He put the photo of his parents down on top of it all. He pictures waved and smiled at him and Harry smiled back before quickly turning and following the woman back down from the attic.
“I will come, but first I must do one thing! Please!” He bagged and Dumbledore nodded “Do you have a pencil and some paper?” Again, Dumbledore nodded and handed him over the requested items. Although Draco had taught him to read and write Harry still struggled with holding a pencil and the words were shaky as he scrawled “Had to leave…Sorry…Be happy…Boy” “I need to take this to the edge of the forest. Please…”
“Yes, me too, even if it is a little confusing” Harry took out his own orange smiling happily at the decoration. It was such a simple thing and yet it was another sign that these people loved him and included him in everything. “What does the orange mean?”
“Honestly, yes, I was upset and, just between you and me, I was jealous of my sister but my life wasn’t all bad” She smiled picking out some wool from a basket at the side of her chair slowly rocking herself back and forth while the youngest of her many cats played around with a small ball of wool around their feet. Plum watched the whole thing from his perch his yellow eyes glowing in the dim light that was above them. “My family kept me with them until I met my husband and we came out into the muggle world”
“When you’re in a tent and you’re on the run thinking at any moment you could be killed...Wouldn’t you think about your girlfriend...?”

“I believe he is a powerful wizard, but I believe he is also an old fool who has let that power go to an already inflated head. I believe that you and Harry are going to need all the help you can get, and I am happy to stand by you both.”
He read his book and ate his sweets before drifting off to sleep where he dreamt of a red haired woman and a man laughing and dancing in cosy looking cottage living room while soft music played and bubbles appeared all around him causing him to laugh happily and clap his hands together.
“What a downright awful family” Draco said fuming for his friend. Narcissa raised an eyebrow but stayed silent and Draco continued his letter.
“It is interesting, however more research will need to be done. Frog spleens can be highly dangerous themselves and make for temperamental potions if used incorrectly…” Severus nodded before spending a great deal of time telling his son and godson about his own research into curse damage. He had seen a lot of it during his time with the Dark Lord and he longed for a way to help the poor souls in St Mungo’s as repentance. Though currently his own research was focused on a cure for werewolfism…Or at the very least making it less painful. Wolfsbane was a start but Remus needed something else, something that could lessen the monster he became. He had asked the Head of Ilvermorny, Robert Singer for any insight that he might have. The man had been a rather proficient researcher in a branch of Auror’s known as Hunters, before taking on the role of headmaster but so far it had all come to a dead end. He was lucky Lucius and Narcissa were happy to help fund him, research was costly, and a school potions master earned very little, it did however allow him access to many ingredients he would otherwise have difficulty in securing.
Thank-you so much for your feedback yesterday, it helped me to realise that you like the pacing and fluffiness and I will continue as I am. I get so very nervous about posting stories and want everyone to like them, I know I’m not the best but it makes me happy to have others enjoy what I write…
“How is that different from a house elf?”
“Merlin is a being of magic. He had a mother but no father. Magic itself placed the babe into the womb of Rhonabwy when it was most needed. As such he is a figure that many have latched upon to claim our divine right over muggles. The Dark lord being the latest in a vast line” Remus sighed continuing for Lucius who nodded along. “They couldn’t completely remove him from history, but they felt, to discourage the idea, that they should change his origin. Make him a student guided by the four heads of Hogwarts just a student it stops him from being the stuff of legends but instead makes him normal, human even…Only pure blood families and those with a keen interest in history know the truth”

“Harry? Are you okay?” Draco asked swiftly patting him down gently before turning and glaring at the older boys his free hand coming to rest on his hip in a move that was almost an exact replica of Narcissa though the look in his eyes was pure Lucius. “How dare you! Touching somebody without invitation! Of course, from your hair you are Weasley’s, of course you don’t know any better”
The day had been great. After a two-hour Quidditch game they had had a light lunch in Draco’s rooms before playing some magical games. When he had found out Pansy was staying for the night Seamus had begged his mum to be allowed to stay as well but Bridget had refused and had threatened to never let him come again if he didn’t stop whining. She clearly hadn’t enjoyed herself as much as her son and Harry doubted that she would ever like the Malfoy’s, or Severus, but Harry hoped that she wouldn’t stop the friendship that was forming between them and Seamus as the Irish boy was hysterical to be around and he fit into their strange band easily. Now however he was about to go to Remus’ rooms and talk to his fathers and he was terrified. He didn’t know what to say the pair. Draco had told him to be honest, but he didn’t want to upset them.
“See we celebrate our ‘Freakishness’ Harry, and you will too!”
Madam Malkins was just in front of him and he gave a fond sort of smile remembering the first time he had stepped into the robe shop before remembering Draco and the conversation that had followed. It was surprising how often he had thought of his former school nemesis over the years. He had spoke for him and his family at their trials and although Lucius had had to go to prison for three years both Draco and his mother had been given home arrest for one year only. From what Hermione had told him in a long letters Draco had, to everyone’s surprise, been apprenticed by Olivander and had opened a wand shop of his own in Hogsmeade. He had married Greengrass but people still spat at him even though he was trying to turn his life around.
“And what does Wolf’s Curse do Severus?” Remus asked wrinkling his nose at the name. It sounded almost like a poison over a potion. Severus stuffed his hands into the pocket of his robe and leaned back against the wall of Zonkos with one foot lifted as he answered in a light tone;
Harry sent his letter back with Plum who had given him a slightly sour look before taking off through the window once more. Mrs Figg had chuckled saying that she would have to give her postal bird a rather large mouse that evening to make up for the two delivery and Harry felt guilty. He had been so excited and happy to have a possible friend that his cousin couldn’t frighten off that he hadn’t thought about the owl being tired.
“I’m glad. As did I. I admit that it has become something of a guilty pleasure of mine, though I am a rather sentimental old fool and enjoy the art of puppetry”
“Oh yeah, great uncle Horologium, he does that a lot the real trick is getting him to shut up” Draco muttered in bored sounding voice his grey eyes rolling and Harry blinked about to speak and say that paintings didn’t move or talk when the knight removed his helmet to reveal bright blonde hair that had been pushed into a style that almost matched his helmet saying;
“…We’re going to the theatre at the weekend…”
“Okay Harry, you and Draco can go through first” Narcissa hummed handing over the pot of powder. Draco took a handful and tugged Harry into the flames before he even had time to say goodbye to Pansy. He did give her a wave before he was whisked away by the flames. He closed his eyes against the swirls of colours that he saw holding his breath until they landed with a bump back in Lucius’ study in Malfoy Manor.
“Maybe it’s a good thing he has his own room. The other Slytherin’s didn’t look too thrilled with him.” Harry pointed out remembering the looks on almost every Slytherins face after Ron’s outburst the night before and Severus gave a nod. Draco on the other hand snorted.
“Honestly! Why am I wearing this crown?” She asked with a huff throwing down the chaft of wheat and the scales so she could pull the offending crown from her head. “A waste of time. My husband’s idea of course. First years of Ravenclaw, welcome to your new home, I will make your first question an easy one…Mr and Mrs Mustard have six daughters and each daughter has one brother. How many people are in the Mustard family?” The portrait gave them a smile playing around with her crown as all of the first years looked at each other. Some even started counting on their fingers until eventually Draco huffed,
