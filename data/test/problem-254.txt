“Just wait till this year is up at any rate. Once I’m gone, you can do whatever you want to yourself, just not while I still have use for you,” said Draco, falling into easy banter.
“Alright,” sighed Draco. “There’s no point telling you, I reckon you’ll have to see it for yourself.”
And she was right, of course. He was the chosen one. If he could reveal not only the existence of the one Achilles heel that the Dark Lord possessed, but also the way to destroy it, it would surely guarantee his position of power.
Narcissa nodded as though she understood and rested one delicate gloved hand on Lucius’s. They shared a knowing glance and turned back to Draco with an expression of warmth. For his part, Draco found the whole thing disturbing.
“Here,” she shoved a branch with pointed green leaves into his hand, which he cracked and held under Diggory’s nose. His breathing immediately slowed.
She scurried down the short row of books in the Restricted Section, inspecting spines and muttering to herself.
“Dementor. One of the prison guards of Azkaban,” said Cedric. “They’re not supposed to be anywhere near civilians, but the Ministry seems to be losing control of them.”
“I’ve re-thought the approach actually.” Draco eyed him evenly. “The trouble with memory is it can be an emotional experience. When I learned Occlumency, it was from someone who already knew much of my history. I had control over what I did and didn’t share. I hadn’t considered that it might be a significantly different experience to sharing your memories with a stranger.”
Snape began to fade, cloak shimmering around his frail form, the puncture wounds on his neck subtly gleaming.
“Your army weakens, boy. You do not have the strength,” he laughed, looking past Harry. The snake coiled at his feet like a pit viper ready to strike.
Hot tears rolled down the side of his face. He wiped them away furiously with his sleeve. He hadn’t cried like this in years, not when they dragged Alice Longbottom away, not even when he was at his mother’s bedside a few days ago. But now, coming clean, it all came rushing back to him, like he’d forgotten how out of touch with his own humanity he’d become.
“It’s typical to start out with memory recall before going deep into Occlusion,” Draco lied. He couldn’t have Potter controlling his memories until he’d scraped everything he needed.
“Sounds fool proof,” muttered Hermione. Draco laughed under his breath. He wouldn’t get any useful information out of their conversation, but it was more interesting than the class at any rate.
“What is it?” Harry asked in awe as the snake continued to uncover itself and flicked its tongue at Harry. The store man eyed Harry suspiciously and then crossed his arms over his chest.
Voldemort's face softened as he moved a strand of hair out of Harry's face. "What have I done Severus. Look what at what I let that vile man do to my kin, what I let him shape me into with his lies and speeches of grandor," Voldemort spat. Severus winced slightly and then hesitantly lifted his hand to his master's shoulder.
Damn Potter didn't know what was good for him. Draco did plan on telling Severus about what happened with Hermione, it still unnerved him that someone like her would discourage Harry learning more about a subject.
"Simple really, why else would they bring in an animal like this to Hogwarts and give it to you," Hermione stated curtly. "Though, I wonder why a hyena? Why not something else?" she stated and crossed her arms. Her mouth twitched as she frowned in concentration.
Sirius paused to gage the reactions of the two Malfoys, nodding when they stayed completely emotionless. They both seemed to know he had more to say. “He also has come into a rather rare inheritance passed down through both the LeFay, and Slytherin lines with a few roots in the Peverell as well,” he paused, licking his lips. “Harry is a Kistune.”
As he opened his eyes, leaves where frozen in midair, and as he looked further there was nothing but ashes left of the Death Eaters.
Albus had managed to escape death. Aberforth's disintegrated corpse, where Albus should have been, was solid proof of that. Knowing what he knew now he wondered how the man got away with it all. There had to be someone else backing him. Who though? And not only who but why set up Tom Riddle like he had and then have Harry destroy him. Had Riddle known something?
“Well they are both addressed to you, and with what happened at Gringotts, well, you owe them a great deal. Best to read their's first," he paused to glance at Harry sternly, "just in case it’s something to do with the damage you caused." Harry turned red and nodded as he opened the letter and began to read.
“Oh, but I can help you get him back,” Albus purred, “But I need you to do something for me in return.” Harry could see Albus’ wand move, a spell he couldn’t quite make out falling over Cadmael.
“Lord LeFay only just came into his Throne. I’m sure you will know him when he comes back,” Kreacher chuckled. He was glad they had sorted out the bloodlines so now his mistress didn’t scream from her portrait anymore. “Come this was Master Draco,” Kreacher beckoned with his hand before leading Draco to his room.
Draco frowned. Harry Potter, almost killed by his childhood hero. That must have been a blow to his ego. “Wait! Why are you letting us live here then?” Draco blurted.
he said rather matter-of-factly. Harry remember what Sirius had said about his kitsune side finding a way to soften the blow from the bonds Dumbledore put on him and guessed that was what he was talking about.
"You think?" Neville squeaked. Draco growled louder, snapping his jaws near Neville's face and took a step closer, causing the young wizard to press himself against the wall. Draco was having
“I think you will do well,” Herm stated. Though she did have that little bit of doubt; Harry didn’t seem to notice and smiled.
She let out a slow breath and released the ribbon on the scroll. As it feel open it started to roll across the floor, and only stopped when it hit the wall. She took in a breath and started, "He has been abused for his whole life, various broken bones, fractures, punctured organs. He's malnourished, he's-," her voice caught in her throat, "-he's been raped, more than once. He's been brought back thrice, once through magical means, one while at his muggle guardians, and the last was after Nagini's attack." She paused to let it sink in. "His curse scar had spread, though not to the naked eye, and has completely rotted one of his eyes. He uses glamours to hide almost everything, and uses a glass eye he transfigured from a marble in place of the one he lost. A living object charm has been used on it to make it appear as though he hasn't lost it. Add that to countless mental instabilities..," she had to stop her self as the urge to vomit came back once more. The first time she'd read this she had nearly fainted. "Severus, you should see his mental state. How he really appears, how his soul has been warped," she said softly as her hands feel to her lap.
Ammit’s eyes seemed to glimmer before he let out a snake idea of a purr as he watched his master. He dropped down from the bed and made his way over to Harry, curling around him.
“So, Charlie. What do you think we can expect from this dragon?” Sirius asked as he ducked under a branch.
She paused at the door and looked back at Harry with a bit of pity. Then she spat at the ground angrily. “That man ruined Hogwarts as well as a great many other things. Try looking at the classes he stopped or the many books he removed and then locked up in his ‘private collection’. He was a menace, I’m glad he’s gone.” she finished venomously and then disappeared out the door. Remus and Sirius both sat shocked into silence. He had done that? Why?
"Ghost come back!" Harry all but hooted at the albino animal as Draco started sniffing around the Gryffindor common room. It was a lot cleaner than he expected it to be, and rather tastefully decorated, well expect for the obnoxious gold and red coloring that is. Someone looked up from their book, letting out a startled yelp when they saw Draco standing there. Well, a big striped albino hyena that is. Draco turned his head eyeballing his next victim and grinned. Letting out an odd yowl, his porcupine like mane stood up along his back and neck as he went charging at the wizard on the couch.
Neville nodded while Hermione pouted in her seat. Harry played with his thumbs, his ears slopping back against his head. “That makes sense,” Harry said quietly. “Is there any other students missing?” Harry questioned and looked over at Hermione.
Dragoon then began to read off the parchment as Sirius numbly came to from his thoughts. He was shocked to hear that he had a block on his memories placed there by none other than Albus Dumbledore. As well as a sudden realization the he was, in fact, blood related to his godson. As Dragoon kept reading the lists of his inheritance he suddenly began to realize that he wasn't as bad off as he thought he was. There was a sudden pause in Baxeka's reading.
“You should know where, you’ve woken up quite a few times here,” a familiar voice stated. Harry blinked hard again to try and get his vision to focus before smiling when he saw Neville and Luna sitting by his bed. He turned his head and then laughed when he saw Hermione giving him a disapproving look.
“Well, I was able to get to the vaults my father left. Even with what Dumbledore had told me; that since I was disowned I wouldn’t be able to," he paused as his face darkened, "I’m starting to think that Albus was hiding a lot from us. A lot that he shouldn't have even been involved with,” Remus' tone was harsh but Sirius had to nod in agreement. “I also had blocked memories like you did Sirius. So we’ll have to share the pensieve.” he said with a small sigh and shrugged his shoulders. It didn't really bother him but Sirius was an impatient man. He blushed when he thought about Sirius' lack of self control.
“If Albus is still alive then I fear he might be making a push to continue with what he was planning while he was alive,” LeFay said, cutting into Draco’s thoughts.
“Charlie wait!” Severus bellowed, but it was too late. Charlie was tackled to the ground as the group of rocks came to life, a long tail coming down almost on top of him. Severus jumped back as the snake-like tail swung at him.
"Yes. Harry died for Draco, and in doing so released my last soul fragment. If Bellatrix hadn't called for Narcissa, however, I would not be sitting here explaining everything. For that I am forever grateful," he put his thumb to his lip, "Lady Magic is keen to return Harry to our world. He has been blessed by her, and chosen to be her champion. However..."
Lucius stood in the drawing room beside the fire, his eye lingering on the flames. Narcissa sat on the sofa to the right of him with a cup of wine held in her hand, sipping it quietly.
Finishing his packing Draco headed to the first floor, picking up a few scones as he made his way out the back and through the kitchen. What he didn’t expect was to find Severus there waiting for him. He stopped, staring at the dower man.
“It’s a reversal for Draught of Living Death, hopefully it will work. I’m not sure what is causing Draco’s state but if anything, this should work,” Snape stated, scowling slightly. Bill took that as a sign he probably shouldn’t be talking so as not to distract the Potions Master. He turned then to Harry, watching the young lord attend to Draco.
Yet, now that they stood in the hall outside the headmaster’s staircase while Sirius and Narcissa talked to Minerva McGonagall and he couldn’t help but stare.
"Yes. Inside the envelopes at each of your seats is actually a copy of the most recent information we have gathered," the group started to pull out the information, "As you can see, Albus Dumbledore is most clearly alive and with having used his brother as a scapegoat, we aren't sure for how long. Ammit has been sent out to ascertain the identity of current owner of Hog's Head, and just how long said person has been there. From there we will at least have the beginnings of a timeline. The only real option we have right now is to continue what we have been doing for the past five years," just as LeFay finished explaining the bickering started. He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering how he'd gotten to this point. They all use to get along so well.
He felt his heart start pounding as a streak of black disappeared deeper into the forest. Terror of the unknown and the rumor of vampires kept him frozen to the spot for a moment. He shook it off and took of his rob, transfiguring it into a thick coat before starting toward the forest. Something about the blur drew him in, even with the knowledge he was going in blind, something screamed at him to go forward.
Sirius chuckled while Remus shook his head and smiled. It was good to see that Harry was acting normally despite everything. “How about we talk about this in the sitting room,” Remus stated. Harry stumbled as he tried to do just that, earning a snort from Sirius.
Harry asked. There was a faint laughing that cause Harry to whirl around again, he was panting a little as he looked around frantically.
Harry’s lips grew tight and he shook his head. “We can’t wait any longer, if they get to far past the gates McGonagall and the others could get seriously hurt,” Harry whispered back.
"I'd forgotten it was in the middle of winter. To use to being inside your," Draco paused, "domain."
The way he leaned away from Draco at the moment. The way his green eyes shimmered in the fire light...the way his hands continued to shake.
When he looked back, a giant bright purple eye was staring back at him. Harry froze and he could feel all the hair on his body standing on end. It continued to stare at him as Harry held his breath, watching it watch him. The water started to tremor slightly as the dragon shifted and began to lift its head; water free falling and rolling off his scales. The group back at the fire felt the tremors and started yelling Harry’s name.
“It’s been bothering me the whole time I’ve been here. When you said that you thought the collar would have broken off by now? Did that mean you didn’t care about the bond it represented?” he asked, huffing a little from the short sprint to catch LeFay before he stepped out the door.
Draco stood silently in the doorway. His knees still wobbling upon hearing LeFay’s voice. His collar hummed against his neck and joy sprouted from his chest. Draco couldn’t believe he’d found him. Harry LeFay was standing right in front of him! Yet, he looked so different: older,
“It’s from Narcissa,” he answered. Remus looked puzzled, What would a Malfoy want with one Harry Potter? Remus asked himself.
He looked up as Draco drew closer; his hand clenching the arm rest tighter and tighter with every step Draco took. After a moment he found himself looking down as Draco knelt in front of him.
“I’ll take bottom shelf for my books and you can have top shelf. The middle shelf will be reserved for potion ingredients,” Harry said as he floated his books to the shelf, marking them off on a piece of parchment as they passed. Draco started unpacking as well, agreeing with the organization suggestions.
"Thank you," Severus said softly as he sliced Harry's palm, spilling the blood into Draco's within the bowl.
"A familiar is a being that a wizard can share and store magic within. Most wizard's and witches, or at least the few that can control one, also use them for guarding objects of great importance, recon, messages, or even an aid during battle. Dumbledore has asked that I find such a beast that fits all those needs, believe you can control it. I however have my doubts. Normally the best familiars for this are magical, as they possess their own magical core, but they are hard to come by. Ghost here is a specially bred line of domesticated hyena. Doing so he can take on such a purpose as a magical creature would, " he over explained, all the while glaring at Harry.
“Let us discuss the next set of your plans now that we have gotten that out of the way. You have my council as always,” he added.
Chapter 6, the chapter before this, has been finished and uploaded. Please go read it as I write up chapter 8 and upload it as well. Thank you my beloveds for reading and sticking with me through this whole endevour. Much love to you and these beautiful characters!
Draco flushed, embarrassed. Snape smiled before clapping him on the shoulder. “You should get going now.”
"Why?" Draco started to growl, "Why deny it when I brought it up then? Why put me, us, through that?!"
Draco laid there, suddenly very aware of just who he was talking to. 'This isn't Potter' he reminded himself. "Not really, its actually kind of hot," he stated, licking his lips. LeFay's smirk removed as he turned away, waving his hand.
Carefully he stepped around Harry's body laying there on the bed and made himself a spot next to the other boy. He laid down, and then rested his head on Harry's stomach.
Minerva sighed, “I honestly couldn’t tell you why. I would like to say it was because of the war, but he had changed them before you-know-who was even born.” She pinched the bridge of her nose. Minerva was absolutely exhausted, and in between hiring new teachers for the positions Albus had removed, reading over all of the Founders notes and rules, and then also having to deal with replacing all of the books Albus had declared too dark for anyone to read; she had no time to take care of the simple things. “I believed Albus was doing this all for the good of wizarding kind, but now…,” she shook her head. “Anyways, the two of you will need to send in you chosen classes asap.”
“It’s pretty late, but one more thing before we turn in,” Sirius stated and pulled a small box out. He opened it and then handed Harry a small black ring like Sirius’ but this one had smaller rubies set inside a black rose. “This is the Black Heir ring. As my godson and living blood relative you’re next in line for the Lord Black title. Also, since we've blood adopted you to stabilize your condition while you were out, you're also officially recognized as our son,” Sirius revealed quietly. Harry was speechless as he slipped the ring onto his pinky finger and watched it shrink to his finger size. He felt like bawling. So much had happened… And now he had a real family.
Theo could barely kept the scrambling fox pinned in his tiger form while Hermione ran to the window and pulled it closed, locking it this time. She turned back to where Neville was talking softly to the midnight kitsune, Theo keeping the struggling Harry pinned as he slowly calmed down. His eyes began to regain focus and when the distant look in them faded Theo let him up while Neville continued to talk to him.
“I might actually want to read that series. It looked interesting,” LeFay stated as he started for the door.
The robe he ended up gabbing was a light grey with gold freckled trim, a great color against his eyes. He felt a light stirring at the back of his mind and guessed Tatsuya was waking from what ever meditation he'd been doing for the night. 'Good morning,'  LeFay thought to Tatsuya, smiling when he felt a caring nudge in the back of his head.
Draco lifted an eyebrow and closed his book before placing it on his lap. “It’s a poem book I found at the Malfoy Manor when I was twelve. It doesn’t say who the author is, but I’ve kept it with me ever since.”
He explored the book cases along the walls for the room first. His finger trailing across a few of the titles that stood out to him. Some of them were pretty dusty, while others seemed to have been used quite recently. Draco wondered what Harry's taste was like. Was LeFay more into history? Perhaps charms, potions? Or maybe he was a sucker for works of fiction. The thought made Draco smile.
The goblin turned their beady eyes to Albus, “It was a matter of personal security for the Potter boy if I recall.”
Draco got up and decided to head to the kitchen to get a snack. He hadn’t come down this morning for breakfast and was famished. As he did he passed by the drawing room, stopping when he heard voices raised from inside. They must have forgotten to activate the privacy wards because he could hear them loud and clear.
“Charlie! You’re not really considering this, are you?” Bill asked, astonished that his brother would put Harry in a position like this.
Narcissa looked down at the letter in her hands, her eyes pacing over the words again. The first time she'd read it she couldn’t believe it, and this time she was still unsure.
Bubo cooed at him from his perch, seeming to notice Harry was awake. Harry sighed and got up, grabbing a long robe from the bed post and pulled it around himself as he made his way over to the owl. He scratched between the Eagle Owl’s ear tufts and smiled sadly. “You miss the twat too huh,” Harry said softly. He turned his head when he heard a soft hissing behind him, looking over his shoulder as Ammit crawled his way up to hang heavily around Harry’s shoulders.
Tatsuya yawned. Harry smiled and then looked over both of his dads, smiling best he could at them still. Sirius smiled back and then went to hug him as McGonagall went to talk to Charlie and Bill.
“You’re going to miss breakfast and your chance to show McGonagall if you don’t hurry,” Hermione yelled through the door. She could hear Harry trying to go even faster then.
“I will not sleep with a nude man in the same bed,” Draco stated and crossed his arms over his chest, staring down Harry. Harry just shrugged and crawled into bed with a yawn.
“Draco, Harry, you may come inside now,” Narcissa said from the stair case, staring at her son as if she had just seen a ghost. Draco shook his head as the color faded from his eyes and turned, headed up past his mother. Harry lifted his head, cutting off his conversation with Ammit about Greek and Egyptian mythology.
“Honestly, I need a whole new wardrobe, I had quite the growth spirt,” he half laughed. Harry glanced around, frowning as another person came into the shop. The dresser seemed to notice his uneasiness and pointed at a back room. “Thanks,” he said quietly as he headed into the back. She closed the door behind them and threw up a privacy ward.
“We should call you Prongs, in honor of your father,” Remus stated, smiling. Sirius nodded, and wrapped an arm around Remus’ shoulders.
“What do you mean?” August asked, taking a quick step towards Cadmael as the atmosphere in the room changed.
"Your summons seemed rather urgent," Snape half sneered. Albus merrily nodded his head and reached for a lemon drop from his desk. "However, if it something that can be discussed later..." Albus shook his head.
“Yes, indeed I am awake. Now can you explain to me why you let one Harry fucking Potter put this around my neck?” Draco spat, motioning to the black metal and amethyst covered collar. Snape winced and then cleared his throat, his face becoming an emotionless mask.
“Why did we come out here?” Draco asked as he looked down into the courtyard. A few groups of ten seemed to be practicing dueling; magically and hand to hand.
Then something moved in the water behind Harry. Draco heard himself screaming, trying to get Harry's attention. To warn him, but it was to late as the monster approached through the water, arms outstretched. Draco slammed against something, he felt his nails scratching at the barrier.
“He’s a dragon, and you are a kitsune. While he may be stronger physically, you should be stronger within. Dominate him,” Hisashi growled, irritated that his pupil wasn’t listening.
“Draco! You're awake! Sev-Snape was worried when you didn’t wake up, even after administering the potion,” Harry’s voice caught in his throat. Draco smiled, unsure of what exactly had happened. He reached a hand up to rub the back of his neck only to encounter metal. Frowning he sat up and reached both of his hands up around his neck, feeling the metal collar the group had put on him last night.
It seemed very out of place, and stressed, in the hall. Despite its obvious discomfort, Harry noticed, it still sat patiently as Snape's feet.
Severus requires an explanation from Tom, an answer to how Tom changed. What did he mean when he said Harry was something more than what they thought he was. And what is Dumbledore planning?
“Well, I’m glad to hear that you’re still here,” Harry stated sarcastically. The kitsune chuckled and shifted as Harry called for a house elf. “As for who Volde is, he’s a man I had to kill to protect my friends,” he said softly as started to change. He felt kitsune stretch and yawn in his mind. It was a weird feeling, like feeling yourself doing something, but you weren’t actually doing it.
“Why what?” LeFay asked as he conjured a wine glass for himself. He didn’t seem to care about using wandless, or wordless magic in front of Draco.
"I'm not sure dragon. I'm not sure," Sev said as he wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled him into a hug. It took only moment for Draco's mask to slid away, tears streaming down the teens face as he started bawling into Severus' chest. "Shhh, it's okay... It will all be okay," Severus whispered.
The eyes rolled above Harry, impatient. "They really don't know when to give up, do they? You have been through too much already and they greedily want you back there. Can they not let you rest in piece?" the darkness spoke.
Harry on the other hand was confused, and a little shocked by the set up. “What’s all of this for, Sirius?” he asked, eyes narrowing, he still felt a little off being around Sirius. However, seeing his father’s creature ears in full view today made him think it might be pureblood related. His own ears had been humming since he entered the room.
Sirius Black was re positioned in the center of the room before they could start. Pain echoed through his body as the goblins started to mutter, their hands working delicate symbols into the air. Once it was done Severus tentatively opened his eyes, only this time everything seemed sharper; and the colors brighter. He didn’t feel any different but Harry and Remus gasped.
“Hopefully that doesn’t happen,” Snape stated. “Either way that seems like the fastest way to get him over here instead of stuck behind my godson’s tail.”
LeFay ground his fangs together, eyes narrowing as he tightened his grip around the string, pulling at his own magic till he could hear it crackling around him. He watched quietly before speaking again, his maw dripping with magic that splashed against the ground as his form shifted with his will. Sliding to form the ghastly image LeFay had always seen in the mirror, the one that licked at the corners of his nightmares at night. The one he knew Tatsuya had both warned him about using, and yet encouraged as well.
Harry finished spinning and sighed, giving up on trying to see his tails and sat down. Remus came back into the room and then sat down beside Sirius with an exhausted sigh.
Draco chuckled, eyes pacing the rest of the room. It was decorated in shades of silver and green, with dark ebony furniture to match, giving him a very Slytherin vibe.
LeFay sat at on the chair he'd been sitting on last night, finishing the breakfast brought to them by the house elves, sipping his tea quietly. Draco was across from him, smiling at something the slytherin had found hilarious apparently. LeFay rolled his eyes, looking back down into his empty tea cup. His eyes hardened in on the pattern in the tea leaves, a frown forming across his face. Sitting at the bottom of his cup was what looked like an owl, and it didn't look like a good one.
“I mean no. That is not what I wish,” Draco lifted his gaze to LeFay and his face showed determination. “If you, Lord LeFay, would allow me to stay; I would like to get to know the real you.”
“Yes, yes I think it will. Or at least help us reverse some of them and boost Draco’s own magical affinity for the moment,” Charlie stated excitedly. “I think it’s going to take all of us to put it on. Harry, get up on the back of his neck right behind his head, that looks like where it will fit best. Bill, Severus, help me lift it after it’s unshrunk.”
Hermione seemed surprised by that answer, and Draco noticed. "You didn't tell me that last night," Hermione pointed out, her voice raising slightly. Draco would have frowned if her could. Why did it matter to Hermione who he tutored with? Harry seemed to be thinking the same thing as his eyebrows rose. "I only mean, is it because of you-know-who?" she whispered. Ginny by that time had gone back to the book she was reading and if Draco knew anything he'd say she'd started sulking.
Harry pulled his thoughts away, opening his eyes again to find himself in his human form, hand still pressed to Draco’s snout. “Good boy,” Harry purred thickly, stroking the scales. He felt a snap as the last bit of their bonding magic fell into place. Draco smiled, sending a wave of appreciation and satisfaction across the bond, causing Harry to blush.
“I’ll wait for you while you tend to him,” Draco said quietly, eyes falling back to Cadmael. If everything Cadmael said was true, he’d put Harry through far more than he’d realized; far more pain than he could heal by just being there for him. Maybe he was even right about him being with Harry, maybe he shouldn’t be after all that. Cadmael may have betrayed Harry, but at least he had been by his side the whole time, trying to take care of him and trying to heal him. What did he do? Nothing.
“You probably need more protection then I do,” he chuckled and then patted Harry’s shoulder. Harry nodded and watched Theo jog off to catch up with Hermione.
“You’ll find out momentarily,” she spoke before motioning for him to go ahead of her. Harry sighed and headed up the steps, only to find himself in a very different room then he had been expecting. The Headmaster's room was rather bare, and no portraits of the last headmasters hung on the walls. “Now that everyone is here, we should go back over everything.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed, and Sirius could tell he was about to blow, “Now Harry, it’s my responsibility as Lord Black to take care of the whole family. That includes Narcissa, and her son. They have Black blood too and Draco didn’t seem all that bad at the end,” Sirius reasoned. Harry huffed but didn't' object, and started towards Potage’s. Sirius followed, feeling triumphant as they entered and bought the cauldrons.
Draco stopped and faced Harry, looking over the young man that had changed so much since the first time they’d met. He didn’t know if it was inheritance talking or the vow he made but he felt the fierce need to keep Harry safe. “Why wouldn’t I? This is exactly the reason I’m staying with you, and the whole loyalty vow. To keep you safe. More so why aren’t you worked up about it? You know they are talking about you!” Draco huffed and poked Harry in the middle of his chest to get his point through.
Most witches and wizard he met were selfish, purest, narrow-minded, pigheaded, and well there was lots of words he honestly could use to describe them, but here? Here it didn't seem to phase any of them.
Flashbacks of the previous battle at Hogwarts played in Harry's mind, keeping him frozen to the spot.
"Of course I know that, but they also had you," he pointed out, gesturing with a finger to add a little more emphases.
Neville reached into his pocket, his eyes never leaving the snarling beast in front of him however, his hands shaking as he pulled out a lemon and lime candied fruit bar. He held it out slowly to Draco who sniffed it, did this kid really think he was going to eat that? However, as Draco got a bigger whiff of it he felt his mouth starting to water, and not a second later he had the bar snatched up in his jaws and was jumping down from the bed with it. Feeling smug with his prize he brought it back over to Harry without thinking and laid down at his feet with the bar between his paws and started chewing on it.
“Indeed,” LeFay stated, looking back at Draco, “You’re also a Black. Like me,” he added, stepping down to Draco's level.
Though the house was done in dark shades it didn’t feel suffocating. Draco deduced that it was probably due to the shades of green that covered the walls and floor. He headed down the hall after his mother and when they entered the drawing room he was taken aback at the sharp contrast to the front room. The drawing room was done in light and dark shades of blue, apart from the wooden furniture which was made of a very light wood. He guessed birch but couldn’t be sure.
"Hang on Neville," Harry called from the door way as he entered the room, he crept slowly towards the bed, his eyes flicking between Ghost and Neville. How did he fix this. "Ne-Neville, this is Ghost, he is going to be my familiar. Ghost, that is Neville, he's a friend," Harry stopped as he noticed the growling starting to emanate from Ghost's body. "Don't move a muscle Neville, just try and stay calm, show him your not a threat, do you have any snacks on you? Maybe try giving him that? It'll work, I think," Harry hurridly suggested
“Honestly," he started slow, "I thought that when I came to full term, it wouldn’t recognize Harry as me. I-We thought its magic would have failed years ago,” he paused, eyes passing over Draco. “However, it seems that wasn’t the case. I apologize.”
"I am fine my beloved, I do not require immediate attention. Care for your son, please," he stated, motioning to Draco's animagus form. She nodded and then moved to Lucius side, helping him lift the heavy body. They moved out of the room, leaving Severus and Voldemort by themselves.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief, he wasn't stuck in that mass of fur anymore. That was good, but. "How long have I been out?" he asked as Lucius walked him over to a chair.
“No. Most will probably either call you Lord Potter, or Lord LeFay depending on their social standing. LeFay is one of the oldest families, thought to be extinct until now. So those that don’t know you well will probably address you as so. Those closer will probably call you Lord Potter unless you tell them otherwise,” Remus explained before yawning and glancing at the clock. Gosh it was late.
For Potter’s part, maybe it would be some comfort to him to believe he had a friend in these most trying of circumstances. He was doing Harry a kindness, really. After all, what would hurt worse in the end; betrayal or suffering in solitude?
“If you can’t control your own memories, you’ve got no shot at Occluding,” said Malfoy matter-of-factly. “Why did you choose that one?”
“That summer we went on a yacht around Greece for about a month till I finally realised I was more interested in the sporty type than the artistic type,” said Gemma, still attempting to talk over the volume of the club. “They’re so melodramatic, you know, it’s always ‘you don’t understand me.’ Anyway, I was introduced to the captain of the Gorgons over a stop in Mykonos and we dated for about six months…”
“And Parseltongue, while a rare gift, is not a mark of evil. It is a common misconception that it is dark-aligned.”
“It’s like a mind Healer, it’s a Muggle science discipline,” said Hermione. “So I thought I’d write to St Mungo’s and see if they can track down a copy for me. That is, if you’re happy for me to look into it further, Harry.”
Back in the room’s normal configuration, Luna sat cross-legged on the couches while Harry laid the crown on the coffee table for the two of them to inspect. He now saw that the front of the tiara depicted an eagle with its wings spread, the blue gems dripping off of it like raindrops.
Sure the public jilting he’d given Theo on the ride back to Hogwarts was harsher than he might have planned on another occasion, but he had to be put in his place. If he didn’t do it now, he would have had to do it later. Now that Draco was a Death Eater, those close to him would be watched more closely. One slip up could mean severe punishment.
This was not what Draco was expecting. The weight of the last six months was lifted off his shoulders just a hair and he could breathe.
“He’s really struggling,” whispered Luna, as though to spare his feelings. “Would you like to help us?”
But Angelica just seemed more amused by his stammering and let out a snort of laughter. “Draco, it’s fine,” she was saying, waving it away. “It’s fine, please sit. I’ve known all along. In fact, it’s one of the reasons I chose you.”
“A smokescreen can be useful to confuse your opponent,” said Cedric as he was consumed by fog and only his voice could be heard echoing down the corridor. “And gives you an offensive advantage as well.”
“And so, some debts go unpaid,” said Greenacre with a small sigh. “There was very little opportunity for recourse at any rate, and before long, Lucius was out of our grasp.” He paused and Draco looked up to meet a slightly chilly stare. “You look very much like him, you know.”
“That will do,” said Voldemort at last. Draco fell to his knees on the cold tile floor and the Dark Lord glided over, bending slightly to speak into his ear. “You have done enough to survive, but your value has dried up in my eyes. What I need from you is very specific: find me the boy and bring him here. If you are incapable of this, remember you are expendable.”
He looked back one more time as McGonagall said, “Who?” and they slipped through the door. As it closed behind them, they heard Umbridge shriek
“More importantly, how is it possible that no one knew of Voldemort before he was too powerful to be stopped? Someone had to train him, someone must recognise him. He has red eyes for crying out loud,” said Harry, tossing aside another book that didn’t even bother alluding to the inciting events of the wizarding war.
“Outrageous,” said Draco, studying the board momentarily and moving his bishop into place to defend. “You can’t pin me that easily, Potter.”
Draco forced him by the shoulders back into his desk chair as Shrub scuttled around underfoot, making noises of concern and tugging at her long ears.
“That one felt pretty good, don’t you think?” said Harry, feeling a sense of pride at finally completing one of Malfoy’s memory tasks.
“When did you figure it out?” asked Draco with a huff of laughter. Here he was thinking he was a master of keeping secrets, yet Harry seemed to know everything about him.
Harry was relieved. He may never be the most accomplished wizard, but he had enough skill now to be a threat when the time came. And if Hermione was onboard with spell stacking, who knew what she’d be able to dream up for him.
Hermione looked like she was going to lay into him, but just scoffed and rose to her feet. “Fine, let me show you the part you need so you can get it over with.”
“Good thing you didn’t touch it, there’s a powerful dark curse on this thing,” said Hermione, peering at the gold ring with the large black gem that had once been the black king’s shield.
Over the course of the few weeks he’d spent in England, Mr DuPont had occupied his time with various business meetings and fancy meals with old acquaintances. This would be one of the first opportunities for Draco to have prolonged one-on-one time with him since he and Angelica had arrived. Although the one or two accounts he’d heard from his father years ago about Mr DuPont were that he was an oaf, and a bleeding-heart muggle sympathiser to boot, Draco was determined to get on his good side.
“I – I thought our Lord was still up on Oxfordshire,” said Draco, numbly falling into step with his father. Their footfalls sounded off the marble floor as morose paintings watched them pass. “Zabini got a letter. I assumed he was getting called up to take the Mark.”
Tonks was already giving instructions to the group, speaking in a calm, authoritative tone. She motioned for Draco to come with her as the strange crowd got to their feet and she led them out of the back entrance of the pub, which dissolved away into a darkening alley. Tonks held up her wand in a small
The water from Hufflepuff’s Cup had healed him almost entirely, but the Mark remained, jet black on his pale forearm. By the time the cup healed him, it was already part of him. Draco tugged the sleeve of his jacket down reflexively.
“What’s so funny?” demanded Draco. “I’m telling you there’s a group of rogue students hellbent on finding the Dark Lord’s weakness. Surely that has to be bad news for at least one of the parties involved.”
“And who is operating under an assumed identity, with the express intention of hiding his or her birth name?”
“I’m in this completely,” said Draco seriously, setting his papers firmly onto the pile on the marble table.
True to his word, Draco showed him anything he wanted to see exactly as he remembered it. He saw Draco’s anxiety about the control he had over his group of friends, and the unrelenting pressure to succeed. His feelings of genuine love and admiration for Pansy who was his closest ally, and his guilt at letting her believe they were more than that.
“And all this time, ever since her death, you’ve worked for Dumbledore,” said Draco, still trying to put the pieces together himself. “Right under the Dark Lord’s nose.”
The ring in question lay perfectly innocuously on the chessboard where it had been dropped among the crumbled shards of the black king piece, once Harry won the game the night before.
The rest of the group spent so much time in Harry’s room over the next few days that when they left to Transfigure it back from a hospital wing to a flat, it had expanded in size to include several more squashy armchairs by the fire and a full kitchen table in the corner by the elf shelf.
“Gone to London to speak with the Wizengamot. Your attackers caused quite a ruckus, they say You-Know-Who has announced his return,” said Hermione, looking nervously at the other two. “What’s the last thing you remember?”
“You’re related to that oaf?” asked Malfoy, sounding amused. Harry clenched his teeth, trying not to show his annoyance, but Malfoy noticed. “Look, don’t overthink it. It started off pretty well, just try to focus on the memory itself so it doesn’t get away from you.”
But when the door opened it was not the gaunt frame of Professor Snape that answered, but a harassed looking house-elf.
Harry had asked this question to himself many times over the last few weeks. Since the battle, the scar hadn’t hurt and there had been no more visions. Nevertheless, there was something suspicious pulling at the back of his mind, like a memory he couldn’t remember or forget.
“Alright,” said Harry, taking a seat. “I think I know what I’m in for. If anything happens to me, promise me you’ll still go after Charlotte?”
Voldemort darted from thought to thought, bursting in on each as though he were knocking in doors. Draco could feel the collar of his robes growing damp with the strain as he tried to dodge and feint to thoughts without Occluding. The Dark Lord saw Quidditch practice, classes, a kiss shared with Pansy. He lingered on a tense moment Draco had not bothered to hide, of Snape breaking down at the Pensieve. Most likely wondering whether his servant would be fit for duty after prolonged memory exposure.
They sat in silence for a moment, listening to the leaves rustle. The sun was setting and the park was getting colder, but Harry was happy to stay in the park as long as Charlotte would. It was definitely better than whatever he’d be walking into at home.
As the scene played out, Draco was surprisingly warmed to see his old Headmaster again. He looked exactly as he had the first time Draco had laid eyes on him at the start of term feast in first year. Sure his beard was shorter and he was missing his trademark powder blue robes, but there was no mistaking the whimsical spirit behind the pale eyes.
“I take it you support a winning team?” said Harry with amusement as his eyes transfixed on the highlights from the weekend matches.
“As it happens, I’ve checked her memory from top to bottom. And it doesn’t seem she’s ever had another vision before or since,” said Voldemort silkily. “It’s as if the information just popped into her head shortly after the boy wound up at Hogwarts.”
“You planned this from the very beginning,” said Harry, his features contorted with disbelief and disgust. “The train station, everything. It was all your doing. You
As Harry entered the shadow of the porte cochere, the black double doors swung inwards to reveal a wood panelled hallway lined with coats of arms and tall candelabras. Two Death Eaters, one scraggy woman and a stout, blunt man, flanked him silently on either side wearing engraved silver masks. Silently, Harry understood he was to follow.
“The actions I have been directed to take regarding the ring do not involve you, other than to ascertain its condition,” said Draco pointedly.
“Don’t look,” he whispered. Draco shut his eyes and laid his forehead on Harry’s shoulder. Something was terribly wrong.
“They’re the regular lot, mostly. Football at the local club, schoolmates, the usual,” said Harry, holding the wand gingerly as though it were a stick of dynamite that might go off at any moment. “My friend Charlotte and I are getting ready to go to university in the fall. Finally going to get out of our shit town, you know?”
“I see,” said Draco, nodding. “What better position of influence than one where you don’t have to fight to keep your seat at the table. But why not just have the cards say that you’re destined to take over the business?”
He was met with booming laughter from Mr DuPont, who slapped a knee and said, “That’s good! I’m gonna steal that one.”
“Sneaking around in the shadows?” asked a voice from the empty hallway. “Much more can be accomplished when one is invisible.”
“Is Malfoy alright?” Harry found himself asking before he knew the words were coming out of his mouth. “It was just an accident. We were duelling and—”
Draco told stories of the best Quidditch matches from the last six years, which Harry had been fortunate enough to have already seen several of in his shared memories. Luna told about the time they raised mandrakes in the greenhouses and Blast-Ended Skrewts in Care of Magical Creatures, as well as half a dozen other lessons which sounded to Harry like near-death experiences, but which she told with a smile on her face.
Harry nodded, and then waved his wand, floating Cadmael and then escorting him and Draco down the hall to their room. He laid him down in his bed once they arrived, pulling the blanket over him before finally turning to Draco and resting his head against Draco’s.
Ghost leaned back away from Potter and then licked at his cheek, trying to reassure the wizard that it was okay. Harry smiled softly and then dropped his hands to his lap. Ghost watched him uneasily, shifting his weight on the bed. Harry sniffed and lifted a head to rub at one of his eyes again with his palm. "It was Cedric Diggory...At the Wizard's Cup when Voldemort killed him," Ghost's skin twitched as if he'd been hit. "He said it was my fault, my parents...Sirius almost dying they year after, Ron's dad getting attack. I think Cedric's right. It is all my fault," he whispered. Ghost seemed to notice he was on the verge of crying again as he licked Harry's cheek once more.
Harry nodded, “Oh, yes. I have. His name is Ammit.” Ammit bobbed his head and flicked his tongue out on Harry’s cheek. He giggled and push the snake’s head away gently. “Don’t, that tickles,” he laughed. Sirius smirked at them before pulling them into a place they could floo home from. “Why don’t we just apparate?” Harry asked.
“You can use mine Remus,” Harry chimed in quickly upon seeing the red upon his second father's face. Remus smiled and nodded before Cogdigger came over to get Harry. Sirius and Remus watched in silence as Harry stepped into the middle of the room and was instructed on how to cut his hand. As the cut healed Harry could feel his magic springing to life and pain suddenly exploded across his body. He screamed as green and silver light enveloped his vision.
“I think there may be bounty hunters already within the school grounds. Draco and I got a letter before he disappeared. We don’t know if it came by owl or not but it was a warning. ‘They are coming’,” Harry gripped the side of the table, his nails scratching into the wood. McGonagall tightened her jaw.
“Lord LeFay thought that it would be nice if you were near the terrace and garden. The Black Manor doesn’t have a large flying space so he thought he’d try his best to get you at least some outside space,” Kreacher stated. Draco tilted his head. Lord LeFay? Who was that?
Draco was shocked, and that shock quickly turned to anger. This was no time for games, Harry was hurting right now, badly, and Draco had promised he was going to be there for him. "I didn't tell anyone anything, I haven't even left the castle since I got here!" he snapped back, fuming that this, creature would darn accuse him of doing anything that would hurt Harry.
“This is amazing. I’ve never heard of anyone with a dragon inheritance being able to fully connect enough to transform,” Charlie stated in awe. Parvati glared at him.
"We both know Harry is stronger than any of us give him credit for. He'll make it," Severus said softly.
“What happened?” Snape said sternly, he didn’t like where this was going. McGonagall nodded for him to continue.
Green eyes hovered in the darkness as the kitsune grinned before devouring the boy whole and vanishing like smoke in the wind. Harry muttered something in his sleep as he rolled over and tugged the covers up higher.
“Hogwarts?” Harry asked as he lifted his intent focus from his waffles, complete and utter confusion on his face.
When Harry opened his eyes he was standing in the middle of a field. It was waving back and forth in front of him like a golden sea, and it him smile. He hadn’t expected this when kitsune said he’d need to find him.
Harry was running down the hallway, or at least what looked like a hallway. All he knew was that he felt like something was chasing him, and if he stopped. He didn’t know what would happen if he stopped, but the fear running through his veins told him that if he stopped it wouldn’t be good. So, he ran, his feet slapping on the wet ground. He hopped it was water on the ground as he turned and then slipped as he rounded the corner. He stumbled as he heard a loud scrapping behind him, causing him to panic as he tried to get to his feet again. Ahead was light and he ran towards it, panting as he slipped again and something roared angrily behind him.
Harry grumbled and put his head in his hands, sighing. He could try to dissolve his tails but he’d only been able to hold his concentration for ten minutes before they appeared again. He needed more practice or a wardrobe that accommodated his extra appendages. That gave him an idea.
"Like you said, I already have." Draco leaned in, his mouth finding Harry's as he was flooded with the taste of pine, maple, apple; the world of those that dwell with in the dark and damn space between the darkest of forests. His hand reached up to LeFay's face, sliding through his hair before hooking onto the massive set of antlers. His other hand hooked around LeFay's hips and pulled him tight. "Jariss, he's fighting to break free, would you do the honors?" Draco asked as he pulled away.
Harry looked up at Sirius and Remus with a soft smile as tears started to stream down his cheeks. “I can’t thank you two enough for what you’ve done for me,” he said quietly. Remus was the first to get up and hug Harry, followed closely by a teary-eyed Sirius.
"Without Ammit Lord LeFay will have nothing to center and ground his magic, his nature is so purely chaotic he needs someone there to ground him," August stated, "Its bullshit but LeFay has chosen you to take his familiars place. I doubt you'll have a choice in it even if you wanted to," he finished as he gestured at the collar securely around Draco's neck.
"Do I know you?" Draco asked, the man seemed familiar. Golden eyes, shaggy dark locks that came down to his chin, a pale face full of freckles, "Oh, I recognize you now. You where in the hall when I arrived," Draco mumbled.
LeFay smirked, starting to show fangs, “You sure? I think you’ll find that there's little of what resembles the person you once knew."
"I see my father's reputation still creates disgust," Hati smiled sadly, rubbing his arms over each other.
“They broke up the day before they came here. She honestly wanted to tell you but, it’s been pretty hard for her,” Theo explained for her, smiling slightly as she nodded and wiped at her eyes.
Harry woke to an incessant poking against his cheek. Groaning he swatted at it and then settled back into his sleeping position before hearing a growl as the poking started again. Harry let out a growl of his own and swatted at the offending appendage again. “I swear Potter, if I have to poke you again-,” the voice cut itself off as Harry’s eyes flashed open. Avada kedavra eyes peered at Draco, turning his stomach and making him flush red.
That's when he saw it, standing in the corner of the room behind him. He turned to look, but when he did it wasn’t there, so he looked back into the mirror.
"Now don't start that," Severus hissed, frowning. "You deserved it and you know it. Now do you think you can control yourself?"
"Yea I'm sure. I think I will head back to the dorms though. I'll see you guys later," he told his friends as he started to gather his things. Harry was just about to turn towards the doors when he heard his name called from the head of the table. He froze as the hall became quiet again. Giving a quick desperate glance at his friends he headed up to the teachers table. He stood on the other side of Snape when he got there; far away from the hyena.
Draco looked up from the floor, hope sparking in his chest again. "I won't disappoint you. I'll prove that I am worthy to be your
The next memory made Harry want to vomit, Cadmael was chained to the wall, head hanging limply. He couldn’t tell quite when this event had occurred, as when he’d pulled it from Cadmael’s mind it had been heavily altered and muddled. It was taking a lot for Harry to even keep the memory together. “Using me won’t work, he doesn’t care for me. He cares for that dragon child!” Cadmael was cursing.
Harry sat in silence as Draco waited anxiously for any sign of reaction. It wasn’t what Draco wanted to say, but he knew it was what he had to say first. He could never live with himself if he kept this part of his past hidden.
Draco felt a light weight on his knee as Ivy dropped from the edge of the bed and slithered towards one resting hand. He could feel Harry smiling as the little snake curled up in his palm and settled there. Whatever he’d done to earn it’s favour, he didn’t deserve it.
“Don’t worry, I’ll keep an eye on her,” said Pansy, gesturing in the direction of the dance floor where a familiar ponytail bobbed about, the towering figure of Blaise dancing around at her side. “Besides, I’m pretty sure she’s smashed. She won’t even notice you’re gone.”
“Sounds like more evidence of a guilty conscience to me,” said Harry, laying the book to the side and returning his focus to the mimbletonia, slouched over in its now too-big pot.
Today, as Draco approached the cracking blue fire, he was neither fearful nor arrogant, but apprehensive. He’d wait for Voldemort to play his cards before he gave anything away. It was that, or accept certain death.
Through Harry’s eyes, he could see the small space turn as he looked around. There was a strangely shaped door with a poster of Potter’s Muggle sports team. And to the right was a shelf with a few belongings spaced evenly apart.
,” said Snape. “It’s the very reason he went after the Potters in the first place.” He was laughing harder, leaning on the desk to brace himself.
,” but a searing headache shot through his temple and he broke off, pressing his forehead delicately onto one hand.
“Alright,” she said, with a resolved nod, grabbing his hand and placing the locket in it. “But we’re going to need backup.”
“Good, I will get you whatever you need to set it up. Potter ought not to know we have it in place, for his own protection,” said McGonagall.
“Look at this, Draco,” she beckoned him over and wrapped one warm, loving arm around him. “Can you see him? Gently now.”
“Nothing will ever be enough for him,” said Snape. Draco turned to see his professor, still seated, though the bind was wearing thin, staring at the ceiling with tear tracks down his cheeks.
She raised an eyebrow sceptically. “Well, I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Pince will have your head if you try and take anything out of here without her approval.”
Draco looked down piteously at his Head of House, who had grasped his wand and was trying to withdraw a new silver strand of memory from his temple, but it was thin as spider’s silk.
“Thanks,” he said, aiming his wand at his own temple. “You just need to reach out your consciousness to meet with mine.”
“Oh, hello,” said a petite witch. She wore a necklace that dangled with some sort of cork and had earrings shaped like turnips. She smiled dreamily up at him.
“I would have told you anything if I thought it would stop you going to that school,” she said, opening her left hand to reveal a crumpled and faded envelope of yellow parchment that bore his name in slanted green ink.
Making sure the coast was clear and putting up a light barrier charm, Luna pulled a bag out of her pocket marked
“I started wondering when you showed me your memories of the Manor. There was something in the dark corridor you didn’t want me to see,” said Harry. “But it wasn’t until we were walking back from Hogsmeade that I knew. You’re meant to take the Mark.”
Luna’s eyes had grown wide. Suddenly Draco had the frightening realisation that Luna had not been alluding to a crush at all.
“I don’t mind,” said Harry, “but I thought you said Muggle solutions were always inferior to magical ones.”
Draco stood on the other side, a distinctly unimpressed look on his face. His eyes trailed downwards, and Harry was painfully aware of his shirtlessness, the tattered state of his pajama trousers, and the dressing gown that made him look far too like Minerva. He pulled it around him for protection.
“At which point, Hermione and I will head to Diagon Alley,” said Harry. As much as he hoped the diary would be at the Manor for simplicity’s sake, he was glad to have a part to play in the plan that didn’t involve sitting around at Grimmauld Place and waiting for the others to come back. “Hermione will Apparate us into town and we’ll make a break through the main street conspicuously, making sure to be seen. We’ll also Apparate through Hogsmeade and near Privet Drive to spread the attention of any Death Eaters who—”
The black shape of the Potions Master sat very still, leaning his forehead into one hand propped up on the desk.
“I have suffered your insolence long enough!” cried Voldemort, rising slowly to his full height and raising a wand — Dumbledore’s wand, Harry realised in an instant. “To think the child of a Muggle-born would dare defy me? Your parents’ power was nothing in the face of my own. I destroyed her, boy!”
“Oh, Harry!” she said, her voice muffled into his shoulder. “It’s been awful for you. Being with the Dursleys that long – what was Dumbledore thinking?”
Harry screwed his eyes shut and tried to picture Draco in this timeline. A sneering, pointed face came into view, leering over him on a train, taunting him in front of a giant winged horse with the head of a bird, pretending to be a Dementor to scare him.
“And here I thought I was in for a relaxing day,” mused Harry under his breath. “Right, my mistake. Let’s just carry on with a friendly game and afterwards we’ll go our separate ways.”
Besides the fact that Harry was playing no one, the game had unfolded just like one of the hundreds he’d played in the park growing up. It had been like sitting opposite Al’s ghost, the strategies of the black side were so similar to his old tactics.
“Not always,” said Angelica, her expression softening. “Only when I have a message I need to deliver.”
He could feel a light tugging on his consciousness, and blinking, he was back in his room at the castle.
Luna quickly became a staple in the Room of Requirement, often ducking in between classes to play with Ivy or shadow Harry’s lessons, much to Hermione’s chagrin. Draco loved watching Hermione trying to battle Luna’s contributions with logic, and Harry’s mood seemed to have genuinely lifted since her addition to the group. Along with which, Harry’s magic was becoming more stable.
It was a feeling he had tried to push away years ago any time he was chasing Harry on a broom, or calling him out in class, or watching him dive headfirst into some ill advised adventure. There had always been something there between him and Harry, even that first day at Madame Malkin’s, before it was anything he could put a name to.
“Alright, I’ve heard of unicorns, but Thestrals? Should I even ask?” said Harry, wondering if a Thestral was just another figment of Luna’s imagination, but she looked up from her puffed up paper ball to fix him with a serious stare.
“Do you resign?” asked Draco, walking in a few slow paces around his end of the hall. “There’s no shame in it.”
“Not much,” said Harry, reaching for a spoon off of an abandoned dinner plate. “But check this out. If I cast a softening charm –
“What did Charlotte think?” asked Draco, finally advancing a knight. “She seemed to be the brains of the operation.”
For all they had been through over the last few months, Luna was the least changed of the group. Harry still received blue ink letters regularly, updating on progress of the mimbletonia research, or sharing doodles of Ivy, or horoscope clippings from the
But as Harry turned the corner and spotted the man in the tweed suit gazing thoughtfully at a chessboard and stroking a white beard, Draco’s stomach dropped. Sitting in broad daylight in a Muggle suit and smiling warmly at Harry through half-moon spectacles was Albus Dumbledore.
“That’s it,” said Harry, his eyes lighting up suddenly as he jumped to his feet, hobbling a bit on his injured leg.
“I admit the circumstances are not ideal, and of course you have no obligation to participate, Miss Lovegood, consider Potter merely as a peer. But for the sake of his concealment, the Fidelius must hold out. At least until we have a suitable replacement in position.”
“Right, let’s do this,” said Theo, shoving the paper into his robes’ pocket and loading up his plate with breakfast. Draco, unsure whether he’d be able to keep food down, excused himself to head early to the pitch.
Draco slipped his fingers under the hem of Harry’s jumper, letting them trail up the smooth expanse of warm skin. Harry made a noise of appreciation, which nearly made Draco lose his footing. He tried to take a step to steady himself, but at the same time, Harry pressed into his touch, and he stumbled backwards, his knees making contact with the edge of the bed.
He and Charlotte abandoned their bikes in the car park and jogged to the ticket counter, where a particularly bored looking teen served them half-heartedly. Harry was reluctant to part with the cash that for so long had been destined for greater things, but sharing a tight smile with Charlotte they accepted two tickets from the spotty youth and made a beeline for their track.
“Some plans take a little longer to unfold,” Harry laughed, setting the queen to the side. “McGonagall also invited me back to Hogwarts to study for real.”
“So now you know.” Snape’s breath was no more than a whisper behind him. He was still bound, but starting to regain movement.
Cedric looked around the room, nodding appreciatively. “Wish I had known this place was here when I was at Hogwarts,” he said, tossing the bag in Harry’s direction. “McGonagall asked me to pick up a few things for you.”
“You want Merlin’s honest truth?” said DuPont, leaning in close to Draco’s ear, his nest of clear hairs whipping around in the breeze at close range. “I don’t give a damn about Muggles. Couldn’t care one way or the other.”
“Harry? What’s wrong?” asked Hermione, craning to look into his face. “We got the locket. The plan worked!”
“From what I can tell, Quirrell was just an average guy before he fell in with the Death Eaters at the end of the war. But being a bit of a loner and an outcast, he was the perfect target for You-Know-Who’s penchant for building a cult following, and ultimately took the Mark as a sign of his dedication. You-Know-Who may have even hand selected him in order to have a pawn to control within Hogwarts.”
Tonks pressed her lips into a flat line. “Look, if you’re really worried about it, I can send word to the Order. I’m sure they can have Moody or someone fill in for you. You’re still so young.”
With his last session with Potter fast approaching, Draco was nearing panic over having neither figured out how he was going to break the Fidelius nor accessed anything of value in Potter’s memories.
Instead of feeling sorry for himself, he tried to imagine what the diadem version of himself would be doing with the information at their disposal. He had all the knowledge of the Death Eaters fortifications on the Manor and the Hall, if anyone could devise a plan to break in it was him.
“Well, we can’t know that for certain,” said McGonagall, her voice wavering. She had taught Sirius for seven years, seeing him grow up from a headstrong child into a headstrong adult. He’d separated from his family’s ideals years ago, hadn’t he? He would die for Lily and James, she was sure of it.
“For someone as obsessed with pure blood as he pretends to be, you’d think he’d stop wiping out bloodlines. Longbottoms, Abbotts, Parkinsons…”
But of course, if they asked what had changed his mind so completely, he wouldn’t be able to say anything about Potter. Even if he could, his friends may be too far gone to do anything but turn him, and Draco for harbouring the fugitive, into the outstretched hands of Lord Voldemort.
“Neville gave us the wrong locket. I doubt he knows what he’s talking about,” scoffed Draco. “Not to mention you’ll have to get pretty close to Voldemort to try and destroy him with venom. And there’s no doubt he’ll fight back.”
“I don’t know,” said Harry, as he kicked his feet into a pair of trainers. “I’m not supposed to be seen I guess.”
“Word to the wise, Granger, if you want someone to confide in you, maybe don’t make their lives a miserable timetable. A little bit of freedom goes a long way.”
“That’s good. I’ve been working on a charm to turn things inside out, you know for laundry and the like, but I had an accident with a turkey dinner and was given an official warning,” said Luna, airily.
“No, no, I’ll just hold us up — although, please, there’s no rush,” said Harry, trying to placate both sides of the group.
Theo stopped his frantic stirring and turned to listen. Draco was careful to keep his face expressionless, but he knew all four of his friends probably felt the same as he did – it had, after all, been the first death they had witnessed.
He could take a few moments to show Harry what he needed to know, he told himself. He’d be taking advantage of an opportunity to build some real trust. After all, he was trying to have Harry believe they were friends wasn’t he? Matter of fact, he was doing such a good job of it that he’d momentarily convinced himself of it.
“Lighten up Granger, do you really think we’ll be able to accidentally break a charm cast by Dumbledore?” said Draco, using his height to lean over her. “Besides, we’re on the same team for this.”
“That is yet to be decided. But for tonight, our course of action is clear. Under the charm, none of us will be able to reveal Harry’s location, or even the fact that we have seen him alive. Tomorrow the
Holding the blade upright and reading the name Godric Gryffindor in the hilt, Harry knew what he had to do. How Al had planned for it to fall into his hands he would never understand, but gripping the sword tighter, he was struck with the mad thought that this could work after all.
“Did you know she was going to be in the west corridor?” asked Hermione with a hint of accusation in her voice.
Harry was still blinking as he pulled the robes over his Muggle clothes and rose to walk towards the wardrobe. As the room came into focus, he stopped in his tracks. Looking back at him was a sandy brown haired wizard with brown eyes and high cheekbones.
Draco paused for a beat, coming to sit opposite, his black robe trailing behind him. Such an impractical article of clothing, but the way Malfoy wore it made him look regal.
She could hear his even, measured breathing and told herself that he would be alright. She wasn’t even sure if she’d remember tomorrow where he was or how to find him, based on the strength of the charm. But she was determined to see him return to their world in his lifetime, and she silently promised that to him and to herself.
“What, not as pretty as you’d imagined?” said Draco, leering over her, backing her against the stone wall. “Well, let me tell you, it wasn’t licked on by pixies either.”
Draco squeezed it in response, and then rose, heading to the end table where there was a pot of tea waiting.
“Thanks for the advice,” he said, walking down the row to meet her. “What are you doing here, then?”
A dark shadow passed behind Harry, blocking out the light from the battle as the Dark Lord’s face split with glee. “Kill him, Lucius!” he cried.
He looked down at his hands flexing them experimentally, and reached for his wand which hummed softly in his grip. “Feels like a fog has been lifted from my mind. Hell, I think even my vision has improved.” He blinked, squinting at the far wall, where the portrait of the woman with the pince-nez batted her eyelashes back at him.
Harry shifted in his seat, thinking it over. Draco had already seen Harry’s tragic backstory, the loveless relationship with his family, his sad little cupboard – what more was there to hide?
“Very well.” McGonagall straightened up in her chair. “I am the Secret Keeper of a crucial Fidelius Charm. One that has potential ramifications for the wizarding community at large. You have been identified as best positioned to instruct a special student who has come into the care of Hogwarts as of late last night when the original charm, held by Headmaster Dumbledore, was broken.”
“I’m sorry Professor, but if we want to keep Harry’s lessons on course, I really must insist that we stick to the condensed curriculum,” said Hermione, rummaging in her bag for the timetable. “He’s making so much headway these days, I’d hate to deviate from the plan and risk a setback.”
The woman glanced up with one raised eyebrow. “Ohh dear. What have I done this time?” she asked with a grimace. “It’s the broom, isn’t it? Look, I promise I’ll buy you a new one once my paycheck comes through. It’s just that it was the only thing on hand and I had to do a late run for supplies. How was I supposed to know that it had a flying radius of 100 kilometres?”
“Hard to believe, isn’t it?” said Tonks, leading him to the edge of the park where white buildings began to emerge. “This is London.”
“Are you attempting to threaten me?” laughed Voldemort, a devilish smile playing at his lips. “I’m sorry to tell you, but you are in no position to do so, Harry. I’ve entertained your requests far long enough. Now submit to me and be done with it or things will not start going your way from here.”
“Abbott? Interesting,” said Draco. If Blaise was dating the resident princess of Hufflepuff house, what else was going on beyond his notice in this place? “You could certainly do worse than marrying into a pure-blood line.”
Even when Harry was on his own with Ivy, he felt strangely at ease. He hadn’t had a vision through Voldemort’s eyes in weeks, and his bursts of magic had all but disappeared. Even his dreams had shifted from fantasies of his old life to a certain blond, flitting around on a broom over a dark grassy pitch.
“There is a rumour,” McGonagall continued, choosing her words carefully. “That the Dark Lord’s attempt to annihilate this child, was what caused his own downfall. A rebound of the Killing Curse, something never seen by our kind.”
“If I can help,” said Luna with a shrug. “For one thing, we should get to work on your potions brewing. We’re definitely going to need some Nargle repellent up here.”
“You hope at any rate.” Harry glanced up pushing his glasses into place. “Come on, show me a Luna memory then.”
“It’s true. I remember the name of the boy who became the Dark Lord. Though many will have forgotten it,” Ollivander said, running his fingers across the warm wood and lining it up like a sight. “It is a very dangerous name to know. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy – knowledge of this sort is a target for Death Eaters.”
He bent down to pick up the photo of his parents, frowning at their reluctant smiles. Why was he feeling so hesitant to leave? He didn’t owe these people anything; they left
“Of course I looked into this family, Potter,” spat Draco. “I know exactly what I’m getting into, and I’m more than capable of handling my father’s old affairs. It’s an enormous opportunity for me.”
Mentally cursing Laverne de Montmorency, mysterious intruders, and Yousef’s turtles for his pitiful lack of sleep, he pulled back the covers and draped a tartan dressing gown over his shoulders. This had better be worth it.
“That’s quite enough of that, I think,” she said, sounding vexed. “We all had our own reasons for coming here, but that doesn’t change our position now. No one besides us knows what Voldemort is doing or what his weaknesses are. If any of us thought this would be easy, we’re fooling ourselves, but it’s not impossible. Unless we fall apart.”
The muggle suit in question had been Potter’s direction for the night’s dress code, as Aparecium was in the heart of muggle London. He’d chosen a slim cut, navy suit which had cost him a weekend’s worth of Quidditch winnings and had damned well better be worth it. Under normal circumstances, he would have ignored Potter’s instructions and gone with a nicer set of dress robes, but after the surprising events of the golf weekend, he was finding himself more inclined to go along with Potter’s suggestions. Given the glances that he and Pansy were receiving from the muggles who passed by their spot in the foyer, it had been the right call.
“And what exactly is the devil’s beast?” asked Draco, wishing not for the first time that he could be over and done with this school already.
“Oh but I am.” Dumbledore’s pale blue eyes flashed in her direction. “I must insist we protect Harry’s location under a Fidelius Charm. And as I have already been duped by one Secret Keeper, I will bear the title myself.”
“Alrighty then, you ready to take this home?” he said as he lined up towards the green. “If we can both putt under 2, we’ll be in the lead heading into lunch. And I always have a better appetite when I’m winning.”
The kiss itself was nice, strawberry scented and delicate, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something missing. It was unclear how much time passed before Charlotte pulled away rosy-cheeked, and kicked off on her bicycle in the direction of the train station.
“Mercer, Wolfe, take the painting,” said Umbridge, snapping her fingers at two of the Aurors who jumped into action. Other paintings of headmasters were quick to leave their frames, but Dumbledore sat peacefully as he was taken off the wall.
Draco smiled down at the small creature who flicked her tongue out, and lifted her up to the collar of his robes where she settled in. “Can’t blame her for having good taste,” he said.
“Who doesn’t?” said Draco, with a look of misty eyed remembrance – something he was used to seeing on the faces of other pathetic souls when they reminisced about these times.
Hermione looked surprised at this display of affection but returned the hug warmly and, taking a look at Harry, summoned a scarf from inside to wrap around his neck.
It quickly became clear that Draco had not imagined the vertical stretching of the room, as they were now at the very top of the muggle building they’d entered, looking out on the evening skyline from a penthouse view. On all sides, the space was framed with large, sweeping windows framed with floor to ceiling curtains dripping with tassels. Beyond which the lights of London glimmering from every angle. Past the bottle service area and an expanse of open floor was a low stage, where a group of melancholy looking women sang a chant-like song.
“Damn, I’m sorry Luna.” Harry felt a sudden pang of guilt for all the times he’d shown Luna what his illicit spell combos had yielded. “We’ve been experimenting loads with charms, I never would have asked if I’d have known.”
“Yeah, bad dream,” said Harry. He wasn’t sure yet how much he ought to divulge to Hermione about the shadow life he could sometimes see into. He’d scoured the books she’d left him for anything that would explain it, but it didn’t seem like a common wizarding trait.
“Well, uh. We’ll be off then,” Draco said, addressing the portrait. He glanced back at Tonks in the doorway, who was standing with her arms crossed. “Off on a transport run, as Tonks says. Sounds like it might be quite dangerous.”
“I think she was feeling threatened that I was asking to speak with you personally,” explained Hermione matter-of-factly.
Draco shifted over on the bed to make room, and he came to lie down next to him. The house was quiet except for a strong wind that was pushing at the gaps in the windows, and what sounded like a house-elf still up late and scurrying around in the kitchen.
Draco did his best to suppress a groan of annoyance. The longer it took Potter to get the thing floating, the longer he’d have to spend trawling through memories with him and putting off the rest of his priorities. And it had damn well better be worth it. He now had 13 inches to write on applications of Arithmancy in curse breaking, on top of a detailed star chart of the southern hemisphere for Astronomy, and hours worth of brewing for a Potions practical that he hadn’t started from the week before.
A smaller thug was trying to get his hand around her to pull her off the spoke, but she was winding herself deeper into the tyre. Harry started to turn – he knew things wouldn’t end well for the snake – when he heard small cries that sounded like the mewlings of a kitten. He felt a pang of sympathy for the helpless creature, but there wasn’t anything he could do. There were too many of them.
He remembered now. The prophecy that had fuelled Voldemort’s desire to kill the one who might usurp him, it hadn’t stopped with the Potters. He’d set a death sentence on any wizarding family that had a child born in the prophesied year, intending to wipe out any chance of rebellion, but Draco’s parents had saved him, sending him instead to live with the cousin who’d been blasted off the family tree.
“So let me get this straight,” said Pansy, placing her teacup back on its saucer and turning to face Draco. “You had a chance to hook up with each of them, and you didn’t follow through on either?”
And the scar. The same scar that had wracked him with years of guilt and confusion had been given to him intentionally. If the accident had been a lie, how could he trust anything he’d been told? He screwed his eyes up and tried for the millionth time to conjure the memory of the green flash, to prove Luna wrong if nothing else.
“Therefore, we need your help, Mr Malfoy,” said McGonagall, resuming her matter-of-fact tone. “Harry will be safe here in the castle, protected by the wards and the power of the charm. But he won’t be safe forever. Eventually the world will come to know of his existence, and when that time comes he must be ready.”
“That’s just the thing – it’s a Muggle remedy.” Hermione flipped through the heavily dogeared pages, handing it over to Harry on one that bore the heading
And they weren’t the only ones looking at it. The Great Hall had an unusually cold hush to it, as students of all houses whispered furtively about the news. Letters from worried parents streamed in with the morning post, and even the staff table was full of tight-lipped faces and nervous glances.
“Not really,” said Harry, taking the opportunity to engage with him, even though he was certain he wouldn’t be able to stomach anything until the others were back.
“Breaking Potter won’t help you in your current position,” said Snape, resuming his teacherly tone. “You and I are both in the grips of a rather robust Fidelius Charm. Even if you knew all of Potter’s secrets today, there’s nothing you’d be able to do with them. Besides, our Lord is still weak. He needs more time to regain his true form.”
On one hand, Harry was glad for the reassurance that his skill was validated, but on the other hand, he got the sense that Malfoy was unsettled by the revelation. More than Charlotte had been. Harry’s eyes darted to the terrarium on his desk and he decided now was not the time for a live demonstration.
“I don’t know. Maybe,” said Harry. “If none of this had happened, I’d probably be heading to university in a few months. You know, I wanted to work in computer science.”
“A vampire?... Nah. I’m an Incubus," he chuckled, "An energy feeder. Luna’s been helping me out a lot. Is it true about you though? There are rumors about you claiming your titles and inheritance, but I didn’t think it would change you this much. What happened?” Neville asked.
“And you didn’t see Draco at all correct,” Snape sounded a bit hopeful but when Harry shook his head for the second time he sighed. “Narcissa is going to kill me.”
Harry’s ears twitched at Draco’s words and he could feel tears start to roll down his cheeks. He looked up quickly, going to grab Draco’s hand but he’d already turned and headed back into the hall with Severus. Another hand gripped his opposite in a tight grip and he looked back down at Cadmael as he wheezed and struggled to breath. Slowly the fur faded as he lost the strength to keep his beast form. His eyes cracked open and he looked up at LeFay, a soft smile on his face. He reached his hand up shakily to touch the side of LeFay’s face, whispering something softly.
Harry got to his feet, standing up on the rock. Looking around and cupping his ears he tried to pin point the sound. While he turned he spotted something through the trees.
Malfoy shook himself from his stupor, and smirked slightly as he regained his confidence. Ignoring the statement Malfoy crossed his arms, “It was rather hard to find you. Six years to be exact." The smirk on his face didn’t even falter as one of the men in the room inhumanly growled.
“My class got out early. Then Neville and Luna had to leave. I didn’t want to stay there by myself. Besides I’m fine, well that was until I bumped into you two. Wait Hermione what are you doing out here? Where’s Ron?” Harry asked, looking between the two. Theo rubbed the back of his head and looked up at the ceiling while Hermione bit her lip.
Draco was speechless. Even his father hadn’t been so cruel. Who could do such a thing to a someone, much less a child. “What all did they do to you?” he asked Harry.
“I can’t believe you two. Don’t you think he has been put through enough? It’s one dead end after the other,” Snape countered their conversation. Draco closed the door behind him with a light thump, drawing the attention of the other four adults.
Draco stated quietly without opening his eyes. Severus sighed and then patted his godson between his fury ears.
LeFay paused, hands gripping the sides of his robes, jaw tight. “I’m not sure what I feel anymore. But I know for sure, that there is no more remorse when I strike someone down. No more wishing I hadn’t had to, none of the disgust I use to have,” he explained quietly.
“Okay, let’s see it what else you got under there?” she stated, her eyes turning into slits. Harry blushed as he tried to find the words to speak. “I can smell you,” she murmured before he even had the chance to come up with something believable. Harry was confused for a moment before the woman sighed and pointed at his behind. “I’m a werewolf, one of the few that can get a job nowadays,” she explained, “I knew who you where the moment you stepped into the door from how you smell,” she added.
“African Violet, to protect those I swear allegiance too. Bay Leaf, to purify our bond. Agrimony, for overcoming any fears that may prohibit my ability to serve. Ash, for health. An Iris Flower, for wisdom, so that I may be of service to those I ally with. And Lavender, so that we may always find peace. With these I pledge my allegiance and loyalty to Lord Potter Peverell Gryffindor Slytherin LeFay; Heir to house Black,” Draco kept his eyes on the alter as he spoke and lit the flame. Harry handed Draco the athame and he cut his palm, dripping his blood onto the flames. “To this day, until my death, I solemnly swear.” The fire flared again, this time turning into a deep violet.
Tatsuya commented. Harry laughed and smiled; he couldn’t wait to tell his friends about his experience.
“It’s none of your business what I am, now if you’d please move. My sister needs this potion,” Parvati stated and tried to get past Dean. Dean grabbed her wrist and tried to push her back, only to have her slap him in the face with her free hand. “Let go of me, what is wrong with you three!”
Sirius caught the exchange and spoke up, curious. “Which you well know?' I’m guessing that means Draco is one of those few blessed with an inheritance?”
Draco jumped as the vines and flowers started to wrap around him, roots grabbing around his legs till he was pushed out into the opening.
Snape, being a spy for so long, caught on to the small hints of Albus' distress. He couldn't help the small twitch of a grin at the corner of his lips. "I thought it was the perfect choice. Hyena's are known for there extreme intelligence, surpassing that of chimpanzees, and for there protectiveness of their young and their packs. Not to mention the high sensitivity of their hearing and smell, and the fact that they are extremely agile and strong for their size. I even made sure to procure one that had been magically enhanced for the boy, and the most easy to tame species," Snape explained rather proudly. Let the old coot have a taste of that.
“I believe Mister Malfoy is treating Harry as a hatchling, or hatchling like,” Charlie stated, pointing out the dragon’s posture along with the fact he had just blocked Harry’s path. Harry couldn’t hear their conversation, and wasn’t all too happy about the tail in his way. Growling he started pushing at the tail, trying to move it, only to have something grab the back of his shirt and lift off the ground. Harry crossed his arms, scowling as he was dropped in front of the Hebridean Black. Draco stared at him before dropping his head down to Harry’s level and snorting.
Bill laughed quietly and then stopped, turning to Harry. Harry stopped, looking up at him slightly. (He just isn’t quite tall enough.)
“Where’s Draco?” he asked, confused. Draco would be so mad about the fact he did exactly what he’d told Harry not to do. Neville and Luna looked down at the bed silently and Hermione put a hand on his shoulder, rubbing it.
"Yea. I can't remember anything after that. It all just dark. Did something happen to Ghost?" Harry asked again.
“We’ll begin the search immediately, Draco.” Severus placed his hand on his godson’ shoulder, hopefully giving him some needed reassurance.
He gripped the edges of the counter tightly, setting his face with a determined expression. No, he knew who Harry really was. He had to be. Even if something happened between those six years, what happened before wasn’t a mistake! They were a part of each other far more than maybe either would realize and Draco could feel it in his bones.
Sirius smiled, “Yes, rings. Apparently, you’re next in line for a lot. Go ahead, take a look," he said as he waved his hand toward the box. "If the rings accept you then the goblins will be notified magically.  We won’t have to worry about sending them any notifications ourselves. I also have something to give you afterwards so don’t go anywhere when you’re finished." Sirius chuckled as he got up from his seat and disappeared down the hall.
When they opened their eyes again all he saw was shadow covering the ground as the creature towered over them. It roared again, almost blowing out his hearing as he cringed.
“After Harry was blown back I changed to try and get an upper hand on the pig shits that attacked me. That’s when Draco came running down the hall, I assumed you two were mates and Draco had felt you getting attacked. He took one look at Harry lying there with that shit standing over him and lost it. One second Draco was standing there and then the dragon. After saving you the other two started firing off spells at him, and I did what I could stop them. I barely was able to get him to chase me outside,” Parvati explained again. “Apparently, he got stuck like that, or he lost any sense of himself because I’ve tried to get him to return to normal but…,” she trailed off.
"I'm nothing like him, I can assure you, I didn't even met him. Which I'm honestly glad for," he stated.
Cadmael was passed out in the chair, but breathing calmly, and Harry felt a rush of relief. “Severus, thank you,” Harry said, bowing.
LeFay watched intently for a moment, something was different about Draco that he hadn't noticed before. Was he, trying to be...Kinder? "Hmm, so, what exactly is the purpose of getting to know me better?" LeFay asked, "You didn't exactly seem like you liked the Harry Potter of old to begin with."
Draco noticed the frown as he left his thoughts. "Are you alright LeFay?" he asked. LeFay looked up sharply and then put his cup down, smiling broadly.
"I know this is hard Harry, but you have to remain strong," Dumbledore said encouragingly, "Now, head on back."
Tom looked over at the fire, his eyes going red for a moment. "If only I had known before I twisted the basilisk to what I thought Salazar wanted. I was so naive," he sighed and raised his hand to his brow. "Dumbledore found out what happened, and that's where it all started. He said if I could gain more power I could change, I could make up for my mistakes, become a better man. He told me to look for a way to make horcruxes Severus. Pointed me in the direction of becoming the very evil he needed to stage himself against. I never knew my mother, she died when I was born. And my father, well after I found out what he'd done I killed him. I used his death and many others to create the first of my split souls. I had fallen for his trickery," Tom stopped, his gaze turning to the floor. "Everything in between is a mass of chaos, I don't remember most of it, however Narcissa tells me it will come back to me with time. I'm not sure if I want it to really."
"Hmm, that's not completely true. Spotted hyena's actually hunt for most of their meals, but striped hyena's do scavenge though I heard they eat fruit and small animals too," she stated.
The two disappeared as Draco tried to move through the heavy atmosphere. A loud resounding crack followed by a laughter sounding their departure.
Tatsuya could go back through his memories then and read it for himself. It was a system they started working out when Tatsuya started wanting to read things Harry didn’t care for.
He could feel the giant fox smile fearlessly, its muscles stretching as the green mouth glowed brightly. The smile turned wicked as Tatsuya appeared before him, green eyes glowing.
Knowing the wards would give out within the day she headed back down the stairs from the Astronomy Tower. She sighed as she walked down the stairs, going over the list of everyone still at the school. She remembered seeing all the eighth-year students in the great hall, already up to protecting their school again. She broke the news of the wards to the rest of the staff and students when she entered before they started setting a defensive line.
"Ghost, come here," Harry said from the bed after an hour had passed. A book was between his elbows that he used to prop up his head, intent on staying on his stomach to read rather than sitting up. Draco emerged from the bathroom, the sound of the toilet flushing. Harry's eyebrows rose as he watched the albino animal head over, it's head swinging side to side. "How?" Harry asked. Ghost looked like he shrugged before he jumped up on the bed and looked down at the book Harry had. "It's a potions book...Ron wouldn't stop bothering me long enough that I can read it, and Hermione is well...Distracting when she starts talking about other subjects. I do lots of reading when they are asleep or not around so I can keep up," he shrugged, "Sometimes I feel like they do it on purpose," Harry added at the look Ghost gave him.
Draco's eyes widened in shock as it started dawning on him what he was actually in for. Gods help him.
The man turned the collar over in his hands, “Well, collars or tags on familiars are usually filled with magic, they act like a wand does for a wizard,” he explained as he set it back down, “So, they are made of similar materials, this one is woven primarily out of unicorn hair, and then magically dyed. It also has a bit of something else special in it,” he added.
Sirius was surprised that Draco caught on so quickly. “Since you both have Black blood from your mother’s side I have to. However,” he paused to switch his attention to Narcissa, “I will have to ask you to swear loyalty to him, both of you. He is my heir so Narcissa would have to sooner or later, but because being a Kitsune is rarer than most Draco will as well. That way it lessens that chance that Harry is exposed before he can protect himself.” Narcissa nodded in understanding but Draco stood up sharply, causing the chair to fall over.
Finally, he jumped towards the end of the tunnel and into the light, only to feel himself failing. He looked upwards, eyes wide as the light started to fade and everything turned black around him.
LeFay's head rolled to the side as he felt the next wave hit both of them, panting as he looked down at Draco.
Shouting Harry hammered on the floor between them, watching Draco as he descended further into the bloody fluid beneath him. "Draco! Fight it! Come on! LET ME IN BASTARD!" Harry's fist shattered through the barrier and he felt himself plummeted into the red waters. He kicked, arms flailing for a moment before he swam down to Draco, grabbing the adolescent be the arm and dragging him upwards.
So, this was what Harry looked like now. He looked kind of like himself, but with the giant snake Draco was instantly reminded of you-know-who. His cheek bones seemed more defined, and his eyes were slanted along with being brighter. His hair was longer and pooled on the ground around him. Harry’s face all together appeared sharper, feminine in such a way that was still masculine, mischievous almost. Draco eyes however where more drawn to the three tails fanning out around him, and the black fur coating fox legs that seemed to start around Harry’s knees. Course the shorts could have been hiding more fur under them.
Draco shifted his weight and listened to his scales rattle. The cold hair was making him feel a little brittle, and the way LeFay was looking at him made him feel self conscious about his appearance. Was his scales misaligned? Did he have something stuck in his horns? Draco finally passed it off as his thoughts trying to fill the silence. After all, he could still feel the hurt in his chest from what LeFay had been telling Snape earlier. There was no way LeFay wanted him, he'd heard it himself.
“Wandless and wordless magic. Impressive,” Sirius stated from his spot at the kitchen island. Remus nodded as he stepped away from his adopted son, still looking him up and down. Sirius smirked and gave Harry a wink as Remus reached up to smooth out Harry’s collar. “Well, we really should get going Remus. It’s best to get the items we need as early as possible. Though, it is pretty late already. Lunch?” Sirius commented as he looked at the grandfather clock he could see in the front room. Remus nodded and headed back through the sitting room to their shared bedroom.
In the forest, a giant sleeps. He is unwelcome in this unfamiliar world and can't remember where he is.
“I’ve always trusted you pet,” Cadmael said horsly with a light chuckle, “I’m just sorry I couldn’t be stronger for you.”
“I don’t understand,” she said softly. Theo looked down at her with a sad smile, shaking his head before hugging her tighter.
Draco nodded the best he could before groaning and pulling his knees up to his chin. This had to be the worst idea ever.
“Good, now I’ve made the needed adjustments in the wards for you to move freely between them already. However, you won’t be able to take anyone through the wards with you,” LeFay stated in between sips of tea; motioning for Draco to take a seat across from him.
“How do you feel about all of this?” Harry asked Lupin as his father flipped through a book he'd pulled off the shelf. Something to browse while his husband took all the damn time in the world. Remus hummed.
“From the descriptions, probably not much. We just better hope it can’t produce a flame yet if it is a juvenile. However, I believe Professor Snape brought potions just in case that will cover burns,” he let the branch go he was holding back, whacking said Professor in the face. “Hopefully it won’t come to that,” he added and grimaced slightly. “Sorry Professor.”
Draco continued to stare at him. “I guess,” he answered, a half smirk on his face as he sat down across from Harry. He reached over to snag one of the apple pieces only to have a tail slap his hand. “Ouch! What the bloody hell was that for?!”
Severus nodded as he straightened, pulling at his cloak. He looked over at his godson, still in his animagus form. He shook out his fur coat, still shaking as he looked over at Severus. There was a small smile on the thin lips before Draco's eyes rolled back into his head and he collapsed into a furry heap. Severus was at his side at once, lifting the hyena's head. "No, no, come on Draco stay with me," he grunted, trying to get Draco to open his eyes.
Minerva looked over at Draco as Harry nodded and inspected the young Malfoy. Narcissa had told her that Draco had come into a very unusual inheritance as well, but that they’d known he would inherit it before hand. Even so, she could feel his presence as well. Her feline sense where on overload. The room felt like she was sitting with two giants on the verge of war.
Draco slinked towards the bed, hearing Neville's heavy breathing coming from behind the curtain. He stopped at the foot of the bed and sat, all his attention on the curtains as he waited for Neville to see if the coast was clear. He heard the bed creak as Neville reached for the curtains, pulling them back slowly. Draco took the chance and lept at him, the curtains falling away as Draco landed on the bed not even a foot away from Neville. Neville was shaking and possibly on the edge of pissing his pants.
Draco found himself looking into the mirror, panicked and already covered in sweat. What had he gotten himself into this time? How could he have been so blinded by lust for this man that he hardly knew?
The sun shone brightly through the window, and the tapping of a beak at it woke Harry. Yawning, he stretched and sat up, looking around with sleep crusted eyes. He made his way to the window and opened it, watching Bubo fly past him and onto his perch. Harry left the window propped open and went over to grab his clothes.
“Well, guess we should get this started,” Sirius stated, nodding at Dragoon. Sirius stepped into the middle of the room as he was instructed to cut his palm and let it drip onto the runes below. The blood flowed and pooled in the runes just as gold and red swirling lights formed around Sirius. A large family tree faded into existence along the wall, making both Harry and Lupin gawk. A long scroll of parchment then appeared in Dragoon’s hands and he smiled as Sirius stepped over to the family tree. “Could I get a copy of this?” he asked Dragoon as his hands explored the new wall engraving. The goblin simply nodded with a toothy grin.
The papers? It couldn’t possibly be in the muggle papers, and yet, Greenacre hadn’t shown any magical ability. Draco was trying to weigh up whether this man was muggle or magical when Greenacre chuckled softly and continued.
“They know,” said Luna. “At first we were just trying to escape Hogwarts, but when the others found out where Neville and I were going, most of them wanted to come along. They’re here to fight Voldemort.”
Harry was thrilled to be out of the room, and couldn’t help but gape at the many moving portraits and twisting stairways they came across. It all seemed so much more vibrant and fraught with magic than it was the night he’d arrived.
Beyond which there was an annoying sense of guilt that weighed heavily on him as he remembered sharing memories with Potter. Flashes of his stupidly noble attempts at saving all the weaker creatures that stumbled across his path. A naïve sense of wonder every time he saw a new form of magic. The unquestioning trust he’d put in Draco to delve into the dark recesses of his memory.
Potter was the enemy! Not to mention a boy who was wanted by the highest power in the land. His days were numbered at best, with nothing but a ragtag group of misfits to keep him safe.
“Good evening, Potter,” said McGonagall with a false cheerfulness Draco had only seen her use with nervous first years. “I wanted to introduce you to Draco Malfoy.”
“Draco, I think you had better go while I have a talk with Harry,” said McGonagall as the air grew thick with stifled magical energy.
The one thing he did know was that if he was going to get any closer to the memory of the green flash, it was with Malfoy’s help. And beyond that he was desperate to get back to Charlotte. There was nothing for him here. Was there?
Draco screamed in pain as the flesh of his arm audibly sizzled from the burn. He had once wondered what the Marking Ceremony entailed, but the fact that it was as painful as a Cruciatus Curse should not have been surprising. He clenched his jaw, his fists, to bare down on the pain, but in a few moments it was over. Breathing heavily, he looked down at his arm, but there was nothing there.
“Father,” said Draco, looking down at his full plate but not feeling at all hungry. “Do you remember the year the Dark Lord came to live with us?”
“We’re trying to get the Pensieve,” said Draco, as he and McGonagall moved to the faint blue glow of the basin.
No matter. He’d respected her wishes up till now, but if she was going to change the terms of the deal, he’d simply walk.
“Yes, of course,” Hermione perked up audibly. “And I could look into the strange waves of magical energy Harry is exhibiting. Perhaps I could find something to temper it.”
“We need to find her,” demanded Harry in a panic, throwing the covers back and catching sight of his leg for the first time. It had been recently bandaged, but fresh blood was already seeping through and the surrounding skin was a greenish grey. Harry tried to stand, but the pain from the leg shot up his side as Hermione guided him back down onto the pillows.
“I hope you have good news for me, Miss Granger,” said McGonagall. “I only have a few minutes before I need to be en route to the Ministry. The Wizengamot is holding a preliminary assembly on the replacement of Albus’s seat on the council, and I’ll be damned if I let it go to one of Fudge’s hand-selected candidates.”
Harry flushed and scrambled out of the way just in time for Hermione to make her landing and the group headed out onto a busy thoroughfare, packed with colourful stalls and vendors. Draco nodded to them as he peeled off towards a shaded side street, while Hermione grabbed Harry by the crook of the elbow and steered him in the opposite direction.
Draco cringed, knowing what was coming next. In his memory, his mind was full to bursting with thoughts of Harry as he blurted out, “
“I’m in,” said Cedric, his mouth quirking into a smile at the challenge. “I promised to protect wizarding kind from dark magic when I took up the Auror Robes. Can’t think of a better way to live up to the task.”
Hermione was looking at him with such an intense earnestness that he hardly knew what to say. The fact that she was actually wrong in any other scenario would have made him feel vindicated, but had the strange effect of making him feel guilty.
A few minutes later, Harry and Charlotte dropped down to hide behind tall bushes in the park, gasping for breath after having made a break for it from the scene of the crime. They could hear the thundering steps of Dudley and his crew not far behind them, growing closer, and then passing their spot as they held their breath. Once the danger had passed, they looked at each other and broke into laughter.
Luna chattered merrily about winged horses and bad omens as they made their way through the castle and out onto the darkening lawns, passing no one but a few paintings and an empty cottage on the edge of the grounds. Harry was thrilled to feel the rush of cool air hit his face for the first time in weeks, and when he turned to look back at the castle, his breath caught in his chest.
“Oh. That’s alright,” said Draco, stiffly. He was still unclear whether this person was on his side, let alone on good terms. Perhaps he was undercover for the brethren. “It sounds like you needed it.”
and flipping to the chapter on controlled memory selection. “Say what you want about Hermione, but it definitely doesn’t hurt to know more about the theory behind… What?”
The room crackled with antagonistic magic as Draco and Hermione stared each other down. Then Hermione took a step back, crossing her arms as a look of smug satisfaction crossed her face.
“Seems about as likely Indiana Jones’s Arc of the Covenant,” said Harry, pretending to sort through memory phials but too distracted with thoughts of the others to do anything useful.
Hermione gasped a sharp intake of breath, which seemed to satisfy Pansy, and she dropped her gaze back into a smirk of superiority, winding her arm around Draco’s. Harry, spotting Malfoy’s ‘get lost’ expression, was quick to manoeuvre Hermione past them. “No worries, we’ll tell McGonagall something came up.”
“Yes, that’s the one,” piped up Angelica before Draco could reply. “He’s just coming by floo, so he should be here any minute.”
“He says the Undersecretary is getting ready to file an injunction against Dumbledore’s estate in order to remove any latent control at Hogwarts,” she said, flipping to a new page. “Hm. Compact mirror rumoured to belong to Merga Bien. That could be interesting.”
“There are rumours, of course, of your return,” said Draco. The watery eyed man jumped nervously. “The
“Just how much of a fucking idiot I am for not doing this sooner,” said Draco, running a hand across Harry’s jawline and threading it through his dark tangle of hair, drawing him back in.
He took a deep breath, sat on the edge of the bed facing her, and said, “Alright. What do you want?”
“What is it you want, Draco?” asked Snape, in a quiet tone that failed to mask his suppressed fury. That numbing potion must be wearing off.
He smiled to himself. If there was anything his years of betting had taught him, it was when to hold and when to fold. There was only one thing to do now. When your opponent has guessed your cards, it’s time to show your hand.
She extended the deck in his direction, allowing him to turn over the final card. He laid the third card down next to the others to reveal an image of two figures facing each other, holding chalices. The symbol of the caduceus, a snake wrapped around a staff, twined between them.
Harry could feel the familiar tingling in his hands, knowing that his temper was about to amplify whatever magic came out of him next. All the better to show Malfoy and the rest what he was made of, if he could only figure out where to aim it.
“Yeah, they’re all here,” said Fred, handing a folded up slip of paper to Tonks, who glanced at it and passed it to Draco. It contained a manifest of names on one side and an aerial map on the other, with a route marked out in red.
“Thanks for bringing it. Too bad I’ll be gone by then,” said Harry, his eyes lingering on the flashes of players swooping across the page as he laid it to the side. “If I can get the blasted wand to work for me.”
“I deserve that,” he said. “But the Granger and Diggory don’t. They support you, they can help you finish this.”
“I did have a couple of suggestions that might make things move along more quickly.” Hermione rummaged through what sounded like a very large book. “For starters, I was thinking we need a bigger space for Harry to practise to keep him from hurting himself and allow for the right layouts for various spellwork. The room seems to know what we need, but I’m guessing it’s locked in place while we’re in there.”
The arched hallways hummed with magical energy as they wound their way through the castle. The warm sandstone walls caught the dappled light as it shone in through bevelled windows, beyond which lay sprawling grounds still green with the last life of summer. As they passed classrooms Harry could hear recitations of spells and whooshing and bubbling noises that had him momentarily forgetting why he was so quick to want to leave this place.
Snape fixed the elf with a stare that would send first-years running, but the elf only looked on with concern. She was right, of course.
The white pawn moved. Then the board was still. Harry was about to chalk it up as a failed experiment when the opposing pawn moved to D5 to meet his advance.
“Whatever you want, darling,” said Draco, trying to placate her quickly so he didn’t miss hearing what Lovegood knew.
“That’s a funny one innit!” said Hagrid, slapping his thigh. “The entire world already knows Harry survived. They’re calling him the boy who lived!”
“That’d be too easy,” he called. Though he was beginning to think he might not stand a chance against Draco after all. Dodging a Stunning Spell, the realisation occurred to him that if he couldn’t best a friend in a closed environment, he might not really stand a chance in the real world after all. And if that were true, what good would he be at keeping Charlotte safe when the time came? He nearly got hit by a Full Body-Bind, distracted by the worry of it.
“Nothing pleases him, Dolores. Haven’t you learned that by now?” said McGonagall, raising her head weakly to glare at the toad of a woman. “When he’s done with you, he will destroy you, like all the res—”
In all honesty, Harry hadn’t thought that far ahead, assuming that if they’d made it this far, they could easily go anywhere their cash would stretch. The thought of suggesting Scotland occurred to him, feeling a pang of regret that he had so much unfinished business there, but thinking for their safety, it was probably a good idea to get as far away as possible.
“I was intrigued to discover then how Luna could have stumbled upon Potter’s identity when concealed by the forces of such a powerful charm,” said Draco a bit louder. Hermione looked like she wanted to reply, but stopped short. “In fact, I think it’s something we should all be interested in, as it poses a substantial risk to our operations here. What I’ve surmised is that Potter himself is not complicit with the charm’s magic. Meaning he is protected as the object of the charm, but is himself not a participant.”
A still more pressing fear was that Draco could no longer see himself rejoicing over a summons to Wisteria Hall. In fact, he was petrified by it. Judging by the looks on his friends’ faces, they were as well. Pansy moved a hand to the crook of his elbow and squeezed.
“That’s a brilliant start,” said Harry. “Ced, if you can get me into the office I can start going through the memories.”
“Now then,” said Umbridge matter-of-factly when the screaming had subsided. “I’ll ask you one more time. Where is the wand?”
The small man fidgeted nervously at Voldemort’s side, blinking his watery eyes and rubbing his hands together. He leaned down to whisper something in Voldemort’s ear, but the Dark Lord waved the man away with a slow gesture.
“And you believe Potter will show you that willingly,” said Snape, placing sachets of dried waratah petals in a small drawer.
“And does it really take that long to teach someone Occlumency? I mean really, what do you two spend all that time doing?”
“What the hell are you teaching him, Granger?” demanded Cedric, as he knelt next to the other two, grabbing Draco by the shoulder to steady him.
“No time, leave it,” commanded McGonagall, sending a few rapidfire spells around the room to conceal, destroy, or hide away a final few precious objects.
“You can’t understand what they’ve done. What they were,” she said in a shaking voice, her fingers brushing away the hair that covered his scar. “At first I couldn’t stand the sight of you, knowing what that man did. But over the years, I have seen it as my duty to protect you.”
As his bike rolled quietly over the dark street, Harry felt a momentary sense of panic when he didn’t see a familiar redhead waiting for him. He paused opposite her house, when he suddenly felt something jab him in the back and a voice asked, “What’s my favourite film?”
Only Luna returned daily, wilfully oblivious to the change in the patterns of the others. Her latest hobby was paging through collections of obscure ancient artefacts which Voldemort might have targeted for use as a Horcrux.
Saying nothing, the man simply held out a hand and waved the unruly pack away. The boys fell silent, and a few moments later the soft sound of trainers leaving the park in an orderly manner could be heard. Harry tried to hold his breath, hoping the old man hadn’t spotted him and wouldn’t force him to go back home.
“I’ll just put on the robes,” said Harry, rising from the desk chair. “No one will recognise me anyway.”
“Well, there’s got to be a figurehead, sure, someone who is esteemed and admired so the rest can be inspired to follow. Then the counsel helps to uphold the law, for there to be peace.”
“Harry, it’s going to be us versus these two, but I think we can take ‘em,” said Angelica jubilantly. “We’ll play all 18 holes together, and tally up our scores on both sides.”
that Draco had brought round for him. If there was one thing he was more excited about than anything in the magical world, it was Quidditch. But he wasn’t here for frivolities, he reminded himself sternly. And his followup Legilimency session earlier that afternoon had not gone well.
Harry said nothing. It couldn’t be. Malfoy, his closest friend in this whole strange world, couldn’t be betraying him under his nose, could he?
He dashed through a corridor, glancing over his shoulder at the far end of the hallway which loomed into darkness. A flutter of fear in his chest kept him moving in the opposite direction towards his mother’s voice, but was large enough to be detected by Potter, who seemed interested in what lay in the dark corridor towards the north wing of the house. Draco was not about to show a sliver of that.
Draco tried to steady himself, his wand felt slippery in his hand. He knew he didn’t have a choice, but as Charlotte turned her moon-eyes to him, he thought of Harry and his resolve crumbled.
Harry gripped the man around the throat and saw his own grey hands, the flesh peeling away at the nails. “The day will soon come, Yaxley, when excuses will no longer suffice. For I do not suffer fools.”
Draco pulled sharply on the wire and the other end popped loose as well, sending a shower of sparks to the floor which he stamped out.
A thick cloud of smoke began to fill the room. Harry set off a few more knock-back jinxes while he could but had to settle for a sustained Shield Charm once he could no longer make out the square shoulders and pointy face. “Maybe you should stick to melting spoons.”
Hermione got to explaining the history of the house ghosts when, turning down a narrow hallway lit by lamps, they nearly ran into a pretty witch about their age with porcelain skin and dark black hair cut short around her shoulders.
“Oh. You can’t see her,” said Luna forlornly. “That’s a shame, she’s really quite beautiful. Here, give me your hand.”
“Zabini was needed for a menial task, well below your station,” said Lucius, waving this notion away with a pale hand. “There is a group of prisoners who are undergoing various stages of interrogation. I had thought someone in your age bracket may be of some use with one in particular.”
Draco stared into his own cup of dark, bitter coffee and completely dreaded having to get through this day.
“Damn,” said Harry, flopping back onto his pillows. “If I’m honest, I’d suspected you’d given me up for a minute. I didn’t want to believe it though.”
It seemed like the more they looked, the less new information they actually found. Almost like people wanted to pretend that Voldemort never existed at all.
“I have a few ideas about that,” said Draco, moving his queen-side knight into position to protect his centre pawn. “I have a hunch about how we can get the locket and the diary in one day, but it’s a wild scheme. It would depend on a lot of things going our way and Cedric and Hermione participating.”
He heaved his backpack farther up on his shoulders and continued his solo trek, knowing that somewhere close, Draco was being held. He only hoped he wasn’t too late.
Hermione leapt up to vanish the broken teapot and she and Harry headed to the kitchen to brew a fresh batch. When Kreacher had calmed down enough to be moved, Draco walked him over to the fireplace and seated him on the armchair. Hermione handed him a cup of tea which he held shakily in one hand, gripping the locket hard in the other.
He was busy mentally preparing his cover story when Harry said, completely at ease, “It’s fine, you don’t have to tell me. We all have our secrets.”
“Yeah, they still treat us like we’re kids,” said Theo, trying to scoop a muddy purple sludge into his phial. “Bloody irritating.”
Draco scoffed and turned to take a few paces away. “Here’s what I think, Professor. Potter shows up in the middle of the night with unprecedented powerful magic, an ability that’s passed down through Salazar Slytherin’s bloodline, and a reason to learn to separate his mind from the Dark Lord’s. Dumbledore wasn’t hiding him for his own good, he was hiding a weapon. Someone hand selected by the Dark Lord.”
“Oh, right,” said Harry, realising his mouth had fallen open at the sight of a stunning snowy white owl in a window display of Eyelop’s Owl Emporium. “Didn’t realise it was possible to stick out on a street like this.”
“But then what?” said Hermione, more obstinate than anxious now. “Even if this works and we get both relics back to the house, we still have to figure out how to destroy them. I’ve been looking into the Fiendfyre spell and I don’t think it’s a feasible option, it’s incredibly hard to control and many experienced wizards have died attempting it.”
There was no point stirring up emotions on the eve of battle. It would accomplish nothing except give Harry a sliver of hope for something that was probably never going to happen. No, the mission was too important for distractions now.
Draco’s own hands immediately found their way to the small of Harry’s back, then his hips, as he pulled him closer. Insistent lips pressed against his, soft but strong. The kiss with Theo so drastically paled with the real thing he almost laughed.
“No, no, there’s no need for that,” said Ollivander, waving a hand at McGonagall. “I’m convinced I can find a proper match. We clearly need something with a bendy quality, and unicorn hair is quite wrong, quite wrong indeed…”
“No, really. I’m dying to know what you could think you know about my life. You might think you have some notion of it after a few conversations over a pint, but you have no idea.”
“Are we sure it’s not an option to just let him return?” Cedric asked. Draco rolled his eyes. “We’d keep him under surveillance, obviously, but he’d be out of the castle. I’m worried he might pose a risk to the other students if he’s kept here.”
Draco couldn’t even muster up the energy to be annoyed by the git. He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Now’s not the fucking time, Potter.”
“Vision, yes,” said Harry, trying to sit up. The pain in his scar was still blinding. “The mental link is still strong. I was in Wisteria Hall, Voldemort was there with his followers. And he had Charlotte.”
He winced, willing the memory away as he pushed into the Potions classroom. He hoped more than anything Snape would know what to do.
Ever since he’d seen the memory of the green flash with Draco, he’d been desperate to remember what he could about his parents. He could picture his mother’s face, he knew she was scared, but beyond that it was hazy. If anything, the fact that he couldn’t see the Thestral might mean there was nothing to remember after all. “I don’t know if I saw it. My parents died in a car crash.”
A bolt of green light blasted from the end of Voldemort’s wand into her chest and she fell in a heap on the floor. Harry went rigid and he felt Draco recoil as well, but as a child he was not frightened. He gazed into the face of the man who approached the cot with a naïve curiosity.
,” said Hermione, emphasising the last word in Draco’s direction before turning to leave as the bard strummed a melancholy cord and wandered into a still life painting of fruits.
“And when will that be?” asked Draco. If he was going to act, he needed to do it soon, before McGonagall had a chance to conceal Potter’s existence further.
“Can’t say I risk living a normal life anytime soon,” said Harry, closing the book. “Thanks, ‘Mione.”
“Sorry I’m late,” he said as he caught sight of them. He looked like he’d had about a hundred hours of sleep since Draco had last laid eyes on him. He was dressed in a refined sort of sporty muggle outfit with navy pants and a dark grey jumper. Draco immediately regretted Angelica’s help on his wardrobe for the day.
“If it was that easy I would have done it,” said Harry, feeling the hair on the back of his neck prickle with frustration.
“Something tells me I won’t be sad to miss out on Transfiguration,” said Harry with a grateful smile.
In an instant, Luna was perched on the arm of the couch, holding Ivy in one hand and plucking the diadem off his head with the other. He could hear rustling at the table as Hermione and Cedric stepped into view as well. They were all still there. As strange as it was – he was relieved to see everyone.
“It was pretty perfect timing for you to get there just in time to save me, but not her,” said Harry. “How do we know you’re not working for them?”
He pulled open the door to the living room and felt an unnerving chill in the air, as though he had just walked out onto the autumnal grounds. Wand raised in a silent Lumos, he scanned the room for any sign of the cause.
Draco’s hand reached out reflexively, but instead of placing it on Harry’s shoulder he diverted it to the edge of the chest, not knowing what to say. Not for the first time, he had the vague sense that he’d underestimated him. Instead of crying or flying into a rage or succumbing to the throes of grief, Harry was taking up the mantle of a task that seemed herculean, if not impossible.
“Well, not in this case,” said Draco, and Harry saw his wall settling back into place. “Now. About that Occlumency practice.”
“Al put that memory in the trunk for a reason. He wanted us to find it,” said Harry, pacing. “We can guess what it is, can’t we? The letter said pieces of a soul, and it’s attached to these artefacts he was collecting. He was tying himself to them somehow.”
Rapid footsteps could be heard in the hall and an ebony door swung open, revealing a tall, blunt man with greying hair.
Dumbledore’s voice strained slightly on the words, as though he was urging himself as much as her to believe them.
It couldn’t be any worse than what had already come before, but somehow Harry was more concerned about what Draco might see in himself than what the others would see in the world the diadem revealed.
“We grew pretty close, Lucius and I. At the time, Abraxas was negotiating trade agreements on behalf of both magical and non-magical communities, so he was certainly looking out for muggles then. I think he even had a seat in parliament, if I recall. What really impressed me was your family’s long history of close ties with muggle royalty, back to mediaeval times I’ve been told.”
“Yeah, I feel ready,” said Harry, dropping the shield and looking around at the others. “Listen, thanks loads for all your help on this. Honestly. I’m almost sad to go, but I feel ready to meet what’s out there now.”
She stopped shuffling and held his gaze with a look of complete composure. Something few people could do effectively, let alone in a fluffy bathrobe. She flipped over a card to show a delicate featured man seated on a throne adorned in grapevines, holding a sceptre of gold. The king of pentacles.
“Maybe we could take P and play it off like she and I will room together,” she suggested with a slow blink. He was suddenly struck with the mental image of Angelica attempting to look seductive in pink frilly underthings and a pouty face, and for the first time wondered if he’d be able to play believably interested.
“There better have been more to it or that would have been pretty weak insight from an ancient relic meant to imbue knowledge,” said Hermione, handing him a cup of tea.
Harry was reaching out, nearly touching the portrait on the powder blue clad shoulder, when a hand appeared on his arm.
But Harry was still standing. He looked down at his hands, pulsing with magic and around at the room which was bowed out at the support beams. Voldemort would pay for what he had taken.
“Dumbledore mentioned something about it in his note as well,” said Cedric. “It’s not just a coincidence that Harry turned up just in time to save the world. It’s destiny.”
“Come on Granger, I’m sure you’re capable of an original thought,” said Malfoy, turning back to Pansy and attempting to lead her away. “I think we’ve got enough time to make it to the common room and back before last period.”
“I’m sure you mean to say, ‘wow, what quick thinking, Malfoy. Well done for covering for us so Potter could make his way through the castle without being seen,’” said Malfoy, lazily turning a page.
“I wouldn’t be so sure,” said Cedric, gathering up the file. “There are many who still share a purist belief, and many more who are simply anti-Ministry or anti-Muggle enough to be swayed if the payoff were right.”
To Harry’s relief, Charlotte had rebounded ahead of the healer’s schedule and had been granted special permission as Harry’s “family” to be allowed to keep the knowledge of the wizarding world. She would take her deferred A-levels over the summer, and she was encouraging Harry to do the same. They could still wind up in Edinburgh.
Harry saw him and returned a nervous smile, waiting for him in the shadows. “Everyone’s alright?” he asked.
“Witness summons, Search and Seizure, Ah – Here is the court order notifying you of your de-seating from the Wizengamot, and here is your arrest warrant for undermining Ministry authority,” said Umbridge, smiling ever broader as she tossed the final pages on the desk and snapped her purse shut. “I think you’ll find the paperwork is all in order.”
. His eyes flicked up to meet Harry’s, and he half smiled in amusement. Malfoy had come under the pretence of helping transport Harry through the castle safely, but Harry was still wary following Hermione’s advice about Slytherins.
“Where are you? Move the cloak so I can get you out. We need to move fast,” said Draco, straightening his robes.
“Gunpowder was where we got our start. Old Pierre DuPont emigrated from France in the early 1800s and used a background in alchemy to sell products to muggles. Thank you.” He handed the waiter a cash tip, at which she looked thoroughly startled. “The family has a long line of gifted alchemists, and after the war they switched tact to pharmaceuticals. You know, healing potions and the like at first.”
“What are you saying, Harry?” said Hermione. “Taking down a single wizard was one thing, but if he has all the power our visions have led us to believe, this is something altogether different.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at her, attempting to discern whether she was blackmailing him on his eavesdropping or just oblivious, but she merely blinked in response.
“No teachers,” said Harry. “We’re on our own for this. There’s no way they’ll sanction you guys helping me on what they’re sure to see as an impossible task.”
Borgin let out a small noise of admiration as he pulled the final layer of fabric away to reveal the golden ring with its rough, black stone sitting menacingly in the middle of the cloth. He whispered a few diagnostic spells and fiddled with the dials on his spectacles while the ring sat motionless; reflecting the sinister shop in its thick golden band.
As he squared up for his final defence lesson with Cedric, Harry was feeling ready to prove himself. Four weeks of learning had culminated in a hobnob collection of charms, a few defensive spells, and at least a handful of experiments that were working out for him so far.
“It must be costing you a fortune. Is there some sort of discount for national heroes?” asked Pansy drily.
Umbridge looked searchingly around the room until her eyes landed on the life-size portrait of Dumbledore that hung behind the desk, gazing down on McGonagall’s crumpled form below.
“No, I mean – nevermind,” said Harry, sitting up and setting the diadem on the table. He told the others all about the vision, everything he could remember that diadem Hermione had said about Horcruxes and everything he remembered from the alternate timeline – everything except Draco.
Frozen, Snape could do nothing but stare on as Draco swept over to the basin, took a breath, and placed his face through the surface.
“None of us really know what happened, that’s the mystery. You-Know-Who was building a vast following for years, promoting the powerful and harming half-bloods and Muggles. But a group of rebels stood against him. He killed many, but when he came to kill your family, the final curse backfired and he was never seen again. They say the Potters died for the good of wizarding kind,” said Luna.
Petunia took a few shuffled steps towards him, her hands held up to her chest like a mouse. “If you had come back straight away, maybe I could have convinced him,” she said.
Severus got up from his spot on the floor and walked over to Draco, putting his arms softly around Draco's chest as he lifted the hyena up onto the bed. What Draco saw broke his heart. Severus could see the pain on his godson's face as he placed a hand onto the furry shoulder.
It took seconds, much faster than Harry had expected before he opened his eyes. He could feel the fur moving with him as he stared at McGonagall. She seemed stunned and speechless before starting to clap her hands and smile. “Well done Harry!” she continued to smile as she stepped around him, inspecting his ability to change to see if anything was amiss. “Your clothes even transformed with you, very impressive for only two days of work,” she stated.
"You're feelings?" LeFay questioned. This was getting interesting, he knew Draco had seemed overly attached to the amethyst studded collar around his neck.
Draco pushed back the top of the tomb and froze. "Bloody hell," he coughed as he covered his nose. It smelt like a potion had exploded and spoiled in the tomb. Pinching his nose shut he pulled a vile out from his cloak and popped the top off, pouring it over the rotting remains of Albus Dumbledore. He couldn't believe he was doing this.
“Already 22:30,” he grumbled aloud. Slumping forwards he then laid out on his stomach, crossing his arms to hold up his head as he peaked into the pile of blankets. ‘
"With what has happened recently, we can't take any more chances. Sadly there isn't enough time to slowly introduce you two," Dumbledore explained as he put his palms together on the table, "These recent events have proved that no one is safe. Now, Snape will be tutoring you in your classes from now on, with some of the teachers supplementing in when he can't make it. Ghost is to be with you at all times, and tomorrow night you are to report to Snape's quarters. He will show you how to create the familiar contract."
“Sure, I guess. Is everything alright?” he locked eyes with Draco and felt an immediate push on his consciousness. Draco was trying to show him something. He could see flickers of a recent memory somewhere in the Manor.
“I wouldn’t be caught dead in that,” said Draco, as he and Harry watched Luna spin around the room before Transfiguring her clothes back into her black Ravenclaw robes. “You actually wear things like this?”
“Then there was this odd situation with Granger. Walking around with her and some boy and disappearing at strange hours,” said Pansy, drawing closer and looking like she was ready to light him on fire. “You couldn’t possibly be spending the time with Granger of your own volition, there’s nothing she could teach you that would be worth putting up with the smell.”
He groaned and flopped down into a large winged armchair. Of course he had no reason to think the plan wouldn’t go off perfectly – after all, he was the mastermind. Luna would be too stupid and sympathetic not to lead Potter straight to the Thestrals. His mother would be unquestioningly supportive of his tip and follow his instructions to the letter. And Potter would be too pigheaded and brave not to go charging back to his Muggle life the moment he got the chance.
“Be that as it may, he must have some power he is controlling. And it will only grow stronger with practice. To unlock Potter’s deepest memories, he may need to help you break down whatever mental or magical barrier is blocking them. And the best chance you have at that is by getting him to genuinely want to… open up.” said Snape, lazily sorting papers on his desk. “Put that back, Draco.”
He considered taking the opportunity with McGonagall to ask some of the burning questions he had ever since his first night in the castle, but decided against it when he saw how flat-out exhausted she looked. She tried to remain austere, telling him and Hermione about the conflict in both the Wizengamot and the International Counsel since Dumbledore’s departure, but the added stress of the late Headmaster’s duties was clearly taking its toll on her. Noticing the deep bags under her eyes and feeling perhaps some sort of misplaced pity, he determined it was best to wait for a better time.
“But I don’t understand. Why did Draco go off on his own? He should have waited for us,” said Hermione, flipping through books next to him, looking for a way to help.
He held Harry while Minerva took one last lingering glance at the sleeping face, dark eyelashes splayed out across rosy cheeks. The only evidence of his encounter with He Who Must Not Be Named was the jagged scar across his soft forehead.
“Yes, yes,” said McGonagall placatingly. “I think there could be potential here. If you can get Harry up to speed in the next 4 weeks I will certainly consider it an accomplishment worthy of recommendation.”
The moment he let his guard down, Snape had his wand out and hit him with a knock-back jinx at close range. Draco went flying into the apothecary cabinet, sending shelves of dry ingredients crashing down around him like a potpourri rain.
“At any rate, I only came by to talk about tutoring,” said Hermione, turning back to Draco. “Can I speak with you in the hallway?”
Draco folded the map and handed it back to Voldemort. “I’m sorry, my Lord, but I know nothing of the Potter boy other than what I read in the papers.”
“What kind of stories?” asked Draco, shifting to a sitting position against the trunk as the two of them unpacked the odd collection of books and ephemera which had seemingly not been organised in any logical way.
“It’s never too early to start picking your alliances,” said Draco, sitting back in his chair and chancing another glance at the fireplace.
“I wasn’t trying to hurt him,” insisted Harry. “But the whole point of this has been learning how to defend myself. And I’ve done that.”
“I was thinking…” she said in a low voice, as a hand slipped under the hem of his shirt and feathered across his waist. “What if we get away together for my last weekend? Maybe go up to London and get a hotel?”
Harry was unusually closed off in the last week leading up to Christmas break. Draco chalked it up to the mounting pressures on all of them to find Horcruxes following the diadem visions – the world may literally depend on them – but Harry seemed more affected than the rest.
When they returned, Harry was surprised to find the room was not empty. Malfoy was reclined on the sofa, paging through a copy of
“Draco! I was wondering when you’d be back,” she said, placing the cake on the end table and hopping off the side of the bed.
Harry scrambled to a sitting position, leaning on his elbows to return Luna’s stare. “What does he—”
“Harry,” she breathed, touching his arm. “Anyone who stood in his way died a terrible death. Only you didn’t.” Suddenly, Luna sounded much older than her age. The great invisible beast breathed beside her in the quiet clearing, sending off jets of steam with each breath. “That’s what makes you special; no one has ever survived a Killing Curse before. That’s why anyone would want to find you for good or bad.”
“I’m not convinced it is.” Harry inspected a final pawn as he placed it on the board. “Hermione disenchanted it but nothing’s happened.”
“I’m with Hermione on this one,” said Cedric, tossing his quill on the coffee table and sitting back against the settee. “The Death Eaters will already be looking everywhere for you. Dangling you where we think they’ll be looking is playing with fire, and the tradeoff is what, maybe ten minutes to search the unguarded sections of the Hall before they realise the ploy and come back to home base? The chances of one of the four of us being captured are extremely high.”
Everyone agreed the film was incredible, although Draco was quick to point out that the villain escaping by bobsled was unrealistic. Once Harry realised how much of a cultural education the rest needed, movie night with Hermione’s old VHSs became a regular occurrence.
Draco tried to keep from sighing in irritation. Didn’t this idiot know Draco had better things to do with his evenings than frolic about with Harry in his favourite memories? He was losing footing in far more important circles of his life for this.
“For another, if there’s at least one example of another misdiagnosed case, that makes me more optimistic that someone has studied this strain of affliction. I found a footnote about one that was cured, but I just heard from Flourish and Blotts and they’ve never heard of the book that describes it.”
She was working down the buttons of his shirt, a drunk smile playing at the corner of her lips as she rubbed a hand against his chest
Sometimes, when the others were around, Draco was quick to answer or brush off any of Harry’s questions into his past. But when they were alone together, like the first time they flew, he was more forthcoming. He probably thought he was great at hiding it, but Harry was starting to see his tells – when he was being honest and when he was trying to deflect.
“Damn it, you idiot, bring Lucius,” said Harry, rising to his feet to leer over the man. “The connection is weak. I need the potion before we separate.”
No one was visible on the grounds as the evening light faded, nor in the windows made of arched stone. But Harry knew he was being welcomed conditionally. The golden light of a first floor window flickered faintly, showing that someone was home, but only just.
“Merlin. Well, it helps that you have excellent memorisation,” said Hermione, putting the list to the side and probably suppressing any instinct to crack open the
Draco turned back to the newspaper in his hand, watching the charming way the glasses slid down Harry’s nose when he laughed. He looked up at the sound of fluttering wings to behold an incredibly ordinary looking owl descending into a perch on the chair opposite him. The owl regarded him quietly, tilting its head first one way, then another, and held out its leg to which was attached a small piece of parchment with his name in a familiar, slanted writing.
Draco looked disappointed for a moment before he wrapped his arms around Harry and brought him into a tight hug. “I know you do,” he said softly. They both stood there in silence for a good moment, Harry’s face burrowed into Draco’s neck.
Draco froze for a second, slipping on a rock as he was coming in for another attack, eyes wide as he saw Cadmael turn to face him. Claws ripped across his face and he felt a pang of deep pain across his chest as Cadmael fired a spell point blank into his chest. Draco flew back and landed in the dirt hard, crunching croming from his wings as he landed hard on them.
Draco gulped, and Draco chanced a quick glance at LeFay. The fact that the other kitsune in the room even seemed on edge told Draco everything he needed to know. “Again, I apologize for the intrusion, I’ll leave you two-”
“My deepest apologies, I was unaware there was another here,” Draco said, speaking quickly as fear spiked down his spine. Even Jariss was on edge, his presence pressing up against Draco’s mind to shelter his bloodline from the possible psychic attacks the much older kitsune could wield.
Harry was silent for a long moment as he pulled his shirt back on but kept his back to Draco. “I’d rather not talk about… I haven’t even told Sirius all of it, he only knows as far as the injuries go,” his voice was barely above a whisper. Ammit head butted Harry’s hand and then slowly wrapped himself around Harry to comfort his Kitsune. Draco didn’t dare push the subject and lowered his head to stare at the table.
“Wait a dragon? How did it get into the school, or even fit in the school for that fact!” Hermione opened her mouth to comment about the fact the school’s ceilings where well over thirty feet tall but Luna interrupted her.
Heading over to a set of double doors to his left he stopped, looking up at the crest above it. A large LF was scrawl atop a blue-grey fox, with nine tails, sitting above the door. One paw resting atop a diamond sphere while its glowed green while staing down at Draco. Hesitantly he pushed open the door, surprised by the amount of light that hit him from inside.
LeFay panicked, remembering the first time he’d meet Hisashi, he wanted to tell Draco quickly but he was surprised when Draco was immediately kneeling with his face pressed to the dirt.
“Nothing, Charlie is just surprised by the reaction Draco had,” Bill said, shaking his head at Severus. Snape seemed confused yet, returned to his normal blank face as Harry turned his attention from the group to the sleeping dragon.
“Draco?” Harry asked, eyes widening slightly. The dragon didn’t react, seeming only to grow inpatient as its lips started lifting to reveal teeth. Harry thought it would be too good to be true. Draco hadn’t come back to himself, it was still all dragon.
“Others are from brawls with opposing fractions. Or just for fun,” LeFay chuckled flashing his fangs.
While the liquid spilled out of the vile and onto the rotting corpse, Draco's eyes where drawn to a ring on the headmaster's hand that he was sure he'd seen somewhere before. He leaned over into the tomb and removed the ring just as the finger started to twitch. Draco reeled back, stumbling and landing on his arse. Grounding he slowly got back to his feet, cursing under his breath for being foolish enough to be scared of a dead man. Yet, when he looked back into the grave it wasn't the rotting Albus Dumbledore it had been just moments ago. In his place was Aberforth Dumbledore, with a look of horror plastered on his face.
“I’m sure your guardian can help you set up the portkey once you get home,” he said with a smile. Harry nodded and then squatted down to show the collar to Ghost.
"I'm fine, just a bit sick I guess," he lied. Course, Harry was use to it by now. He lied to Ginny about being in love with her before finally coming around and being honest.
“Where am I? Wha-wat happene-,” he cut himself off as he caught sight of something strange by the door. Looking back at him was a fox faced man, with emerald glowing orbs that mirrored his own expression. Both Sirius and Remus became quiet as Harry reached up to touch his face.  Long nails attached to delicate hands caressed the black fur before stroking up the outside of tall smooth fox ears. His ears. Looking down at his hands they looked almost normal, but his nails had grown long like talons and held a green hue.
All Draco saw was red as he leaped at the man between him and his property. He latched onto Voldemort's arm, dragging the man and knocking him down onto the ground. He heard yelling as Narcissus and Severus made it too the door, and then there was the screaming from the murder beneath him. Voldemort raised another arm to protect his face as Draco went for his throat his mind numb as the screaming continued. Suddenly Draco's eyes went wide as he felt his back legs give out. It took him a moment to realize he'd been hit with a stunner, and he turned. There stood Severus, pale as death with his wand drawn. Draco could feel the betray down to his bones, and his vision started to face as Lucius made his way into view behind his mother and Severus. He heard his father yell something and try to push through his mother and Severus.
Draco didn't want to, but the way Harry lay there, with his hands over his chest, and his skin so pale it was almost like a china doll, he doubted it. The only way Harry survived was a miracle in and of itself.
Draco shrugged, looking down at his arms and the faint bite marks littering them now. "I'm doing fine. I'm not to worried. Sev's potions are only the best in the whole of the wizarding world." He tried to laugh at least a little but it didn't come. He lifted his hands to rub his eyes only to feel a strong hand grip his. He looked up, startled by Tom's sudden movement. Tom squeezed his hand and smiled weakly at Draco.
“Technically, he isn’t a child,” Charlie noted as he was looking through a note book and then slipped it into his pocket. “Harry’s creature inheritance is a Kitsune correct? And the power output he has is something to be jealous of. Since Kitsunes are basically royalty in the creature society we might be able to use that to our advantage. The dragon might be willing to negotiate, or at least won’t try to kill us on first sight.”
Harry was surprised. This woman had met another Kitsune? Too bad she didn’t remember or he would have asked her questions about the experience.  “My name is Kristian by the way, Kristian Walters. Since we’ve gotten that out of the way. Do you trust me enough to take the glamours off so I can see what I’m really working with?” she asked and raised her brow. Harry nodded and the glamours faded as he took of his jacket and threw it into the corner.
Harry could feel the pain and hurt directed at him as Draco turned his attention to him. He looked away quickly, his hands gripping Cadmael’s fur tightly as he felt the man underneath the fur breath. He was grateful he wasn’t dead, and confused as to why he felt so connected, so betrayed all at once.
At the manor Draco pops by for a surprise visit to Harry's room, only to get a lot more than he bargained for. And in the darkness 'something wicked this way comes', and some can already sense the changes around some of the students.
“No,” LeFay said hotly, his jaw tightening, “Not until we settle everything with him. I,” he trailed off and his face softened for just a moment. August nodded, he understood, in a way, what his Lord must be going through. “I want you to go investigate Skoll and Cadmeal’s family. The time between Albus finding and ‘saving’ or beastman seems fishy, I want everything we can find. Even if that means you need to rip apart their old residence,” Harry stated, gripping Cadmael’s hand tighter. August’s surprised expression was wiped away quickly as he nodded, grabbing his book before making his way quickly out of the hospital wing. Harry stood there for a long while longer, thumb ghosting over the back of Cadmael’s hand.
