. He looked to the person left of Harry, the Granger girl.
"Never have I ever masturbated to gay porn." She said without a hitch, smirking slightly. Draco's eyes nearly popped out of his head, who knew she was this scandalous when she was drunk. He didn't take the shot, but something niggled at the back of his mind. He sought Harry's eyes and wasn't surprised when Harry didn't move. Seamus however, unabashed took the shot, stood up and whooped.
And...
The door slid open to reveal two boys, both slightly dishevelled, both with tired eyes and slightly leaner bodies. As soon as their eyes hit Harry and Hermione they slid over to where Ron would sit and then quickly back. Harry relaxed back into his seat, not sure why he was tense in the first place. Did he expect it to be? No, he squashed the blossoming thoughts.
Harry, for the first time that night, held Draco's gaze, "How the hell would you know what problems I have Malfoy. Leave me the goddamn fuck alone."
His feet had taken him to back where it had begun. Where he had been sorted, where he had received his broomstick, where he had been chosen for the Triwizard cup, where his scar had first hurt, where he had killed Voldemort, where he had seen all their bodies, laid out on display for all to see, for all to mourn. A sob tore from his body and broke the stillness. Harry sunk to the floor, in defeat and cried. There was no one left. Reality came crashing down.
"Stop, stop, stop." Hermione lifted her hands and shushed Lavender, knowing how dangerous the night could become for her friend, "I think we need to change things up. Get a little –" she lifted a bottle and shook it "–drunk. After all, that's what we came for."
• • •
Harry stumbled as he walked, stomach-lurching as he remembered the events of the battle. He'd fought Voldemort here, how could everything be so different? He slid clumsily into his seat. Hermione sat opposite and Ginny joined them, her eyes muted and skin pale. No one had had a particularly good summer.
He downed his shot.
Lots of love,
"I.. I don't want to talk about it." He said, unable to think up of an excuse.
• • •
"Trust you? I don't know about that."
"14 inches, but I've done 16 inches, and you should too if you want extra credit and house points."
"Harry, have you been crying?"
She rolled her eyes, but before she could continue pacing, the door was flung open and a partially drunk Seamus stumbled in, holding a shitload of bottles. Neville staggered in behind him holding a crate of firewhiskey. Hermione's scowl split into a grin – though Harry noted, it didn't quite reach her eyes.
He turned to Draco, "You fucking had to. Good grief. Merlin's balls. Hopefully she won't remember anything in the morning."
"Harry?" Neville prompted. Harry remembered that they were still there.
Without hesitating a few of the girls in the group took their shots giggling. Draco felt, through the alcohol-induced haze, he felt his stomach flip and blood drain from his face. His Dark Mark had stopped bothering him, but it was still there and it was still dark as ever. He didn't want to confirm it in front of everyone. It was more permanent then the scars on his body. He closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. Curse these fuckwits. Curse everybody. Curse fucking Voldemort. Curse himself. He opened his eyes, and with his left arm – the one that bore the mark – leant forward to reach for his shot, took it, downed it and put it back. Everyone stared at him. He sought Harry's eyes, but the boy didn't meet them, eyes closed and grip loose on his bottle – everyone but Harry stared at him.
"Harry, Harry. It's ok. We're here. We here to help." Kingsley Shacklebolt approached him with a red-face very upset Mrs Weasley.
Harry didn't meet her eyes, staring into the fire.
"I know."
Hey all,
Harry rubbed at his eyes in an effort to stop from crying, but all it did was wet his hands with salty tears. A tight pain pulled at Draco's chest, as he remembered all the breakdowns he had had at the Manor, and all the breakdowns he barely kept himself from having now.
Harry lay in bed. Without Ron's echoing snores, the dormitory felt too quiet, too large. Everything lay silent and everything lay still. Even the incessant arguing of Seamus and Dean over quidditch and muggle football had vanished, vanished when Dean was put into a magical coma –  the key to consciousness which died with the Death Eater.  Harry rolled over and stared out of the gap in his bed hangings, out of the window and onto the ground below.
The name, though his, bit him. His family's name clutching at him like a shadow, a reputation he was never quite free of. Draco furrowed his brows, 'Potter.. are you..?"
Draco slept the majority of the train ride. So much so that he missed the food trolley and the lamps were lit by the time he woke up. The only things he noticed was the clickity-clacks, the gentle swaying of the train and the dull ache in his side whenever he took a breath.
Then raising her voice she addressed them all, "Who wants a game of Truth and Dare?"
Was CPR an option? Did it even work on wizards? Was there blood in his airways, should he clear it? How could he clear it? Ambulances don't go to Hogwarts, "No.
Through tears, he gazed around the hall. He wished the Earth would open and swallow him whole. This was all his fault. Not just Voldemort's, but Harry's fault, his fault. So much death surrounded him, it always had. So many people had died, for his life or by his hand. How could he live up to their expectations? He was the boy who lived because people died. Harry rubbed his hands over his eyes desperately. How could he live so they could be glad they let him live?
It was this thought, of not being able to breathe, that did it. His breath shortened and his chest tightened and the ache continued to ache, pain spreading up and across his chest. His heart beat faster as he began to panic. The pain increased, and his breath shortened.
Across the – would it really be called a circle? – Harry went oddly still. He froze again, tense. He closed his eyes, took a deep, shuddering breath, opened them and reached for his shot. Draco felt his stomach plummet. He had wanted to see but to actually...no, it couldn't be the truth.
Cries of pain, of vengeance, of desperation, covered the cries of those who had lost all that they loved. When wands were lost they were replaced by daggers enchanted to harm, to maim and to kill. The frontiers of the two sides had broken, masks slipped as their faces stilled behind them, robes tore as youngsters fell upon the broken brick.
Hermione sat there for a moment in silence before smirking, "What's the furthest you've gone with a guy?"
Gradually people began to join them and it wasn't long before all the seventh years were sitting in a small circle. People reached for the booze, but Hermione smacked their hands away, "That's for later."
"I swear I'll hex the living daylights out of you, you git."
• • •
It was surreal being back on the train. In a moment when he looked down the hallway between compartments, he felt the last six years wash over him. The pointless bickering with Potter, the snide comments and laughing with Crabbe and Goyle, the food which always brought a smile to his face, the feeling of freedom whenever he boarded the train, finally out of the mansion. Beneath his civilian clothes, his Dark Mark throbbed and with a crashing halt he remembered all the events of the past year, washing over him like a cold bath. He shivered slightly. Feeling somewhat disconcerted he started searching for the right compartment. Walking past all of the full ones, he slid inside the first empty compartment, glaring at anyone younger who tried to enter. He sat and waited for his friends to show up, hoping that one of them would.
The door opened again and Draco walked in. Instantly the talking stopped and everyone turned to stare. He glowered at them all and walked over to where Hermione was sitting on the rug, protecting the booze. Harry half-followed, no more people to meet and greet, but also curious to see this exchange.
Peace offering in a time of peace – ironic, no?
Harry stopped writing. It took a minute for him to process what she had just said. He stoppered his ink bottle and rested his quill on top. He peered up at her from behind his glasses, intrigued, "Why do you wanna do that? Don't you think it's best to study?"
Draco watched Harry take the shot and wondered which part of the statement Harry found truth in. Surely he hadn't tortured anyone, but killing someone was a whole lot worse. Draco shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Bugger everyone. He reached forward and took his shot.
"Re..reduc... ducto..o." His breath shook, and his wand finally slipped from his hands, clattering to the floor. The boy hissed, as the giant piece of rubble pushed painfully into his side, and tears leaked from his eyes. A dark nothingness swam to meet him and his hands fell limp by his sides.
Harry nodded into her shoulder, knowing that if he was to open his mouth again, everything would come rushing out. He pulled back and nodded at her appreciatively. She smiled tight-lipped, and joined Kingsley at Draco's side, waving her wand in practised motions.
• • •
Everyone nodded, a few people, including Seamus, cheered. Harry nodded. This would be a good distraction. Surely it would stay light and fluffy, shallow and disinterested. Grabbing a bottle when Hermione was distracted, he took a long swig of the firewhiskey. He needed a good distraction from his nightmares. Maybe if he was drunk it would help.
"You wish Potter. You're the one that's scared."
"Malfoy?" It barely escaped him, but thundered in the quiet.
Even as people erupted into cheers, hugging each other and hobbling forwards to clap bloody hands on his shoulders, Harry just wanted to disappear. And when all eyes and hands went towards tending the injured, that's exactly what he did. He couldn't bear to look at anyone in the eyes. Sure they may have won, but they had lost so much. He couldn't bear look at Fred, his body still and cold, nor Lupin, nor Tonks. He didn't want to meet the eyes of George, of Percy, of any of the Weasleys. It was too much for him. He'd won, but he had lost at the same time.
"Oh, so not in the Great Hall where literally everyone else is having breakfast." Harry sneered, standing over him. Draco looked up at him unfazed by the power imbalance, but slightly uncomfortable at the jab. He hated going into the Great Hall. He had no one to talk to and the noise was overwhelming, and the smell was horrid, it reminded him of last year and the place itself just triggered his panic attacks.
It was a cold afternoon, but even so, many of the seventh year kids tried to take advantage of the little sun before the homework piles obscured it. Regardless of the blustery wind, people strolled and sat on the grounds, sometimes laughing but mostly staring out into the sky, lost in thought. Draco avoided them. Sitting in the library he tried to absorb himself in his work. He tried to think about something other than the thoughts spinning around in his head. An endless whirl of worry and panic. What if he was taking a bath in the Prefect bathroom and had an attack? What if he slipped under and couldn't breathe? What if he went into the Great Hall and freaked? What would people think? Do people think he's a killer, a murderer? What if? Would they?
"Malfoy." She snapped. His head snapped up and he glared, "Go away Granger, I'm working."
Every so often he would turn a hall and hear a crash, hear a muffled shout of a curse. His foot caught on something and distantly he wondered if it was a piece of rubble or a turned-up carpet. He turned his head the sound of a scream and stumbled towards it. In his peripheral, he saw fire burst into life, consuming a young wizard, melting, burning, devouring. Harry's vision blurred. He saw a ceiling come crashing down, a flash of red light and a body fall. He ran up the stairs to catch them but they fell through his fingers, head hitting the stone. He forgot how to walk, stumbling through corridor after corridor, hall after hall, up and downstairs, chasing people who were already gone, people who he could simply not save.
"Right." Harry replied, voice cracking.
He ran his fingers through his hair and threw the covers from him, not minding the biting cold. A momentary flash of green filled his vision and the events of last night were the last things on his mind. He grabbed his wand from under the pillow and let his feet fall on the cold floor. Not thinking he left the dormitory, and the common room and the Gryffindor tower.
It was pressed hurriedly into his hands by Seamus. Harry waved it in front of him and mumbled, "Prior Incantato."
Spicy, saucy stuff Harry Potter – what else do you do to prevent wasting away in your deep dark depression? Also Malfoy's just cute.
The Ravenclaw shifted in his seat, uncomfortable after what had just happened, "Truth."
But then, through the pain, he heard something. A pit-pat, the softest sound of feet in a silent hallway. His eyes slid over the hallway desperately, and whether by delusion or sanity, he didn't know, someone was suddenly standing in front of him. A head and then a body and then a shaky hand holding a blurry wand. He blinked once to clear his vision, but his eyes no longer obeyed him and the scene before him blurred further. Standing in front of him was a blurry black-haired blob of a boy.
Hermione?"
He smiled back a small, slightly sad smile, "Who would you invite?"
Harry left a trail of tears in his wake. The dust which had been stirred by the day's students was coming to settle and faint though it was, he left tear tracks as he walked, almost as if he wanted someone to come and find him.
Lots of love,
• • •
Hermione turned her back and went off to find some books. Draco sat there and tried to reabsorb himself in his work. A party, what the hell made her do that? Who would even go? Unable to think about fluxweed or daemon livers for his potions homework, he packed up his books and retreated to his dorm. Even if he was alone, at least he wasn't getting bugged by the likes of Granger.
He met her eyes briefly and looked away, "I love you too, Mother."
The Hogwarts express left the station and Draco put his legs up in his empty compartment, ignoring the empty feeling in his chest.
Hermione stood right in front of him, standing over him. Her satchel bumped against her hip and his eyes gravitated to the place where her arm used to be. She hissed and his eyes flicked quickly to her face, "What do you want filth-"
"Kiss Potter? No way, I'd rather snog Dumbledore's corpse."
She shrunk back into herself, somewhat affronted. Harry felt even more frustrated at himself. Seeing the look on her face – why couldn't he do anything right?
"He's dead! The Dark Lord has fallen. RETREAT!" One cry pierced the rest, Lucius Malfoy raised his voice in desperation. The Death Eaters, so vigilant and loyal fell to chaos, dark-robed figures scrambling for a means of escape. The sound of fireworks filled the air as any capable Death Eater apparated. Many didn't and put up a battle to win their losing fight.
Across from him, Hermione did the same, sniffling a little bit. When he heard her, his heart dropped even more and he felt shameful for being so selfish.
"What about breakfast, Harry?" Hermione called after him. She stood alone in the common room, more saddened than angry at his actions. Something had to be done about this moping and irritability. She couldn't let him waste away. She ran her hand through her thick bushy hair, and bit her lip. She knew she couldn't get him out of a funk like this, so who could?
"Hermione! You actually want me to kiss him?" He shot at her.
At last, he began to see the Gryffindors leave the Great Hall, and from where he was standing by the doors he had a great vantage point. He stepped forward out of the shadows and into the light, ready to approach his maybe nemesis. Seamus and Neville came first, with Hermione trailing, absentmindedly fingering her robes, tugging them over her – he cringed – armless shoulder. Then finally came Harry, glancing around nervously.
"I am hosting a party in the room of requirement."
"Shhh Harry, just wait, I'm sorry. I think someone's coming, it may be -" Hermione gave him a pointed look, sat up quickly and adjusted her shirt over what was left of her arm. Brushing the hair out his face, Harry eyed the door quietly.
Weeks passed. Day after day, night after night. Harry came down to breakfast each morning a little more dishevelled, a little more sleep-deprived, a little more irritated. He kept having dreams, not of Voldemort thank merlin, but of the bodies, of his friends, of his enemies, of Draco lying there dying in his blood, his body spasming and seizing up. The worst part was of this knowledge that it wasn't just a dream, it was a reality, a flashback to worse times.
He stood and stared down at Harry, who had crossed his arms over his chest in a futile attempt to warm himself. Draco realised then how cold Harry looked, shivers racking his body. As Harry hung his head in his hands, a quite sob escaped him, "Malfoy, I need to be a–"
Harry sank to the floor beside him sighing, "That's a mood."
Hermione refused to meet his eyes. He turned away from her, irritated that she would say such a thing. He shuffled forward in the circle and leaned in. Draco kept completely still where he was sitting. Everyone watched, the circle was silent in apprehension. Harry sighed, "Come on Malfoy, you scared or something?"
They walked together in silence, until they reached the kitchens. Draco could not help but sneak glances at the other boy. It was dark and cold, and Draco's limp was more pronounced than it had been in the last three months. And yet, Harry hadn't even mentioned it. That was odd, come to think of it, and Draco stole another glance at the Gryffindor. Gone was the sure-fired, loud speaking , loud footed boy, he was now uncertain with every step and had sunk into a silent rut. Draco didn't know what to think of it, other than he could not possibly fathom what he had gone through, being the face of the war itself.
Mrs Weasley pulled him in close and wrapped her arms around him, her voice also cracking, but her hold firm, "I've got you. Kingsley is good at healing, and Draco will be ok. Everything will be ok, Harry."
"Yes, wow really, Harry. God, I thought you'd be more up for this House unity thing." She smacked him over the back of the head with her neatly rolled parchment, "You're not even listening to me."
"You know what he would do right now?" Hermione hiccuped, more to herself then Harry, "He'd say something thick-headed or surprisingly insightful trying to make us feel better. He was always like that. Trying to make the world a better place. Why did we have to go fuck it up, Harry? Why did Voldemort have to fucking screw over us and ruin our lives."
Harry's stomach growled. Draco heard and lifting a cold piece of toast from his plate offered it to him, "Peace offering Potter?"
"Do we really have to be enemies?" The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them. Draco bit his lip, wishing he could take them back. They rested in the air for a few moments before Harry spoke, "Aren't we though? You're on Voldemorts side and I'm on, well, my side. Isn't it just the way it works?"
"Harry. I'm thinking of hosting an inter-house get-together this Friday evening, do you know anywhere I could host it?" She blurted.
"Thank me later," Hermione whispered to Harry, before getting out the booze and willing shot glasses to appear. Harry sat in awe of his friend. She had just protected him against another demeaning dare. Then his heart sunk and he deflated a little, how much of a coward was he to hide behind the protection of his friends? How many people were sacrificed for his survival? He lifted his drink and took a long swig.
Everyone glared at him as they passed. Zacharias Smith turned his nose in the air as if he was the proud ambitious Slytherin instead of loyal, but rather lofty, Hufflepuff and Susan Bones flinched when she passed him, hiding her – what he glimpsed to be, scarred arm in the folds of her robes. Padma and Romilda seemed especially invested in their conversation when they passed him and Michael Corner had the audacity to scornfully mention the Malfoy name in that same conversation. Draco clenched and unclenched his hands, angry, angry at all of them. His chest began to ache.
"Maybe I'll have to give you another secret to keep then." Harry's voice was suddenly husky, and Draco could feel his hot breath on his neck. He shuddered slightly, not really knowing how to act or react, but not really caring either.
Hermione poured shots and placed them out evenly on a round coffee table, that had just sorta appeared out of nowhere, leaving the bottles of firewhisky in the middle. She grinned, "We're gonna play a little game of 'Never have I ever'. Easy game, easy concept. If you've done it, you drink it. No rules, no restrictions. I'll go first. Never have I ever seen a thestral before last year."
Draco lifted his other eyebrow and sat down producing a plate from under his arm, "To have breakfast, idiot."
• • •
Padma cleared her throat. Harry stifled a groan. It was always troubling when Padma had her turn, after exposing her and Terry's relationship she had it out for him, and if there was one thing Harry didn't want, it was more trouble.
He turned back to her, "For one thing you could do it in the Room of Requirement. That way you don't have to provide any of the furnishings. And we could always the tunnel under the  Whomping Willow to import firewhiskey if Seamus's stash runs low. Which I doubt but–"
Lots of love,
"Okay," She smiled and twisted her hair around her finger, thinking. Hannah Abbott leaned in and whispered in her ear, and Padma's mouth popped into an 'o'. The girls snickered. The group leaned in, ready to hear Harry's dare. Padma cleared her throat dramatically, "Harry Potter I dare you to kiss Draco Malfoy."
Try as he might, Draco could not sleep. His lips were still burning pleasantly in memory of Harry and though the party had ended many hours before, he couldn't get it out of his mind. Who knew he was an adventurous drunk? He hadn't experimented much with alcohol in the past.
"That wasn't a kiss." Hannah cried. Padma nodded, "Nothing close to one."
He shifted his weight, cringing as a bolt of pain shot through his body. Who could it be? Who would dare be out after curfew – it wouldn't be one of the younger years, no. And in the Great Hall? He shivered.
His cheeks went red. Looking across the circle he saw Draco's do the same. He couldn't kiss him, they'd only reconciled a few days ago. And...
Deciding to do something instead of lying in bed like a happy lovestruck git – which, he insisted to no one in particular, he was not, Draco sat up and fetched his thickest gown from his drawers. Putting it on, he left the dormitory, bypassed the common room and climbed the stairs from the dungeons, needing to go to the kitchens and scab some food from the house-elves, preferably without them knowing. One hand on his abdomen, feeling the scar that was still very much painful, he struggled to find breath in his sides, and keep pace with his strides. He wasn't going to get better for a long time yet. Draco stopped at the top of the stairs to take a breather and his limp, which he'd been walking on fine, became pronounced even more so. He limped along the first floor, struggling to remember the way to the kitchens, struggling to walk and to breath and just struggling in general.
"Harry." Padma turned to him, pushing her hair back from her face where it had fallen when she had had to kiss Terry Boot. Harry mentally swore for jinxing himself. "Truth or dare."
"Somebody HeLP ME!" He screamed again, voice cracking dangerously at the end. Looking down at the pale boy, "Don't die Malfoy. C'mon, c'mon. Wake up you git! Nononononononono. SOMEBODY HELP ME!"
Draco glared at him, not wanting to be reminded of the throbbing Dark Mark on his forearm, "Then why did you fucking save me huh?"
He thought of saying something, but every time he opened his mouth to speak his voice failed him.It was only when they had reached the hallway did he clear his throat and alert the other boy, "We're here."
"Thanks, 'Mione." He fell silent measuring his scroll. He had four inches left to write which equalled to around seven lines. His quill scratched on the parchment as he tried to finish. Hermione had already finished her homework and she had begun to write up a study plan for the N.E.W.Ts, which Harry honestly didn't want to think about. They were over two terms away, and he already had so much on his plate. He sighed, staring at those empty inches of parchment.
The last child had left the stage and the spotlight was left lingering on the grand piano. Malfoy had sat a bit straighter for a moment and then started the most passionate performance.
* * *
“Malfoy! We need to get away from here!” she croaked, her wand was already casting a Patronus charm to call the reinforcements.
“You are subpoenaed for the preliminary hearing as a witness for the defense!” she started, her face enveloped by the roaring green flames, “The Auror in charge of the case wants to talk with you again. Kingsley didn’t provide any details, he only said that you did not respond to twenty of his owls… Twenty, Harry! Have you got any idea what you’ve gotten yourself into! This is outrageous!”
“They are just kids! Fuck their parents! Why do they have to suffer!” Draco shouted.
"Very well," the cloaked stranger exhaled warily and pulled back the hood.
“No… now I understand!” she interrupted him, “I overheard Ron and Hermione talking. And I wished you would have told me sooner.”
“Blimey, Harry! How did Hermione and you manage to get yourself a month of detention?” Ron asked him incredulously, trying to keep his silent
The person stepped closer, long crimson robes rustled soundly, and there she was, as good as alive. Elise Baelish was looking at him curiously, her smart haircut impeccable and a long dark bruise on her neck.
“There isn’t anymore. I threw all the dark arts-related tat away! And I am not feeding your addiction, so take the goddamn pills and stop pissing me off!” Potter looked all worked up about it like he was actually worried about Draco.
“No,” he said lamely.
“How are you feeling?” he uttered drowsily.
“Auror… yes, sure, sir,” the man babbled, sitting up a bit straighter and saluting him like Harry had been his superior. “What is there you would like to know?”
“No… er, nevermind. I’ve just heard a name somewhere…” the Gryffindor babbled trying not to blow his cover too much.
He studied her expression to find some hint of a joke but the girl was dead serious.
“Potter was kidnapped?… Now that’s news to me.” he lifted an eyebrow, his mind started going a mile a minute at that very moment.
"Do I need to remind you that Aurors cannot use lethal curses during an arrest?!" He asked coldly, "Besides, I have a child here. A very emotionally unstable one, I might add!"
“Your innocence, you don’t just let people take it… it’s supposed to be… important,” Draco explained looking very serious.
“Hello, everyone… I am… er, a lycanthrope.”Harry choked out, hoping that his glamor charm was still working and that the Prophet wouldn’t be publishing his riveting tale tomorrow.“I was bitten three years ago, the day before the full moon, and started transforming a year after that. I am... er… taking Wolfsbane right now and trying for people at work not to discover my condition. I think that’s about it.”
“You need to be able to produce a Patronus. Can you do it?”
“Where is everybody?” Harry asked.
“I am not, sure…” Harry said, distracted by his thoughts. He quickly glanced at the Slytherin table to see if Malfoy was still there, but he must have left already. “I need to talk to… someone! Thanks, Luna!”
She saw Hogwarts... a bathroom floor drenched in water and someone's blood... a boy, pale as a ghost. Crimson streaks slashed over his chest... and another boy, Potter, crouching next to him, his terrified eyes so big behind the round spectacles.
“Stall the mistress! Nobody needs to know we’re here! We’ll be back soon!” the blonde instructed the pupils.
They got to the entrance and ran towards the parking lot. A few muggles were looking at them curiously so Draco canceled the levitating spell and wrapped one arm around Harry’s waist, supporting his heavy limp body as they managed to hide behind the parked ambulance. He could see the nurses searching the area and he pressed himself closer to the cold side of the vehicle and held his breath, hoping that their odd couple would be unnoticed.
“Er… I am not sure I want to talk about it with you of all people,” Harry sighed, embarrassed.
“Potter?” the blonde asked him, “Why haven’t you run away yet? You’re not exactly the type to fool around with a bloke?”
“Mum,” Draco started slowly, trying to read her mood, “You do know that I did not intend to marry… a woman.”
It was always like that with TJ. Ever since he pulled him out of that wretched Rehab Center in Port Saint Lucie he had been a constant reminder of Draco’s sorry state at that time. He was a drug dealer, a peddler of all things illegal from muggle prescription pills, and cannabis to various philters, elixirs, and concoctions that tormented the wizardkind. Despite him being a complete slag, the git knew the market pretty well, and his illicit affairs with everything that moved provided him with a large network of clients.
“Hey, Pibsy,” Potter crouched to her level and tried to sound non-threateningly. “You know Elise Baelish, don’t you?”
Harry held his breath, waiting for them to say something worthwhile.
**Boke - idiot
“Draco made it,” Harry commented, twirling the ornate glass turtle doves he had received from Bill and Fleur as a gift in his hands. They had probably hoped that those would represent Ginny and him.
“Why?!”
“I can’t,” Harry gritted, “They will think I am asking for preferential treatment.”
She flicked her wand and a round metal dish levitated slowly towards Draco. He exhaled and took out the vial Potter had given him. He poured the shimmering liquid inside the basin and it swirled gently. The Slytherin waited until McGonagall had gone out and looked in tentatively.
,” Zabini’s smile was venomous.“Malfoy’s dead. Go chase your ghosts somewhere else!”
He needed extra dose fast, just to stop ruminating over something that shouldn’t have happened. Draco was determined to sneak into Slughorn’s storage once again, he wasn’t sure there would be the Philtre itself, but maybe if he found enough right ingredients.
“Kevin,” Harry smiled back. “Is the Chimera about?”
“Alright?” someone asked and he could smell expensive perfume and menthol cigarettes on them. The music was still blearing in his ears and it was very difficult to concentrate on the person who had saved him. Harry nodded, he wondered if anyone else had noticed what was going on and why weren’t those people fighting affected by the music. It felt almost as oppressive as the Imperius curse, but he could resist one with his magic, he knew that. However, those blearing sounds just kept pounding in his head, making him completely disoriented. He tried to cover his ears from the melody to keep his mind clear.
“I was just… worried,” the git grumbled.
“So I am going to Azkaban then,” he exhaled.
“You have 24 hours, Malfoy,” Amanda warned him and then threw something towards him. “I will find you. And if you a smart lad you will not tell about any of this to Mr. Potter.”
“Those were children! Orphans! Who don’t have anyone to stand up for them, Ron!” Harry yelled back not caring that another child was sleeping now far away.
“Elise, she was a pupil here. She was nice to you, wasn’t she? Do you know what happened to her… just nod.” he tried speaking calmly not to trigger another episode of self-harm.
He hurried over to where Harry was sitting, performed a couple of diagnostic spells, and carefully peeked under the layers of bled through gauze.
“Auror Proudfoot is on a special mission now…” Williamson started and then the door to his hospital room glowed blue and Harry hurried to hide under his Invisibility Cloak.
“That will be all, darling,” Narcissa said, giving the female Auror, who still hovered next to her a sharp look. “I think being next to the Savior of the Wizarding World is a sufficient protection”.
At least he was getting better at Healing Charms, Granger had slipped him a book with them the next time they worked together on their potion project. There was a note inside asking him to report it to McGonagall but Draco simply shook his head. What good would it bring, he was already a Death Eater scum, reporting would make him a snitch as well. He was grateful to Granger because he had something to talk about to his probation officer: Draco made a muggle-born friend.
“Draco, ‘s that you?” she asked over the line, “Martha and I went back to Saint Barbara’s to pick up her things and we found Potter… you should get there quick!”
Panic made his head spin the moment he saw the stricken expression on Draco’s face. That lady was potentially very dangerous to all the kids in this institution and they need to do something, to get the authorities involved and stop the madwoman before she did even more damage. The elf was their only chance to discover enough incriminating information and perhaps find out the truth about Elise's murder.
“Of course I did, she was our pupil, a very bright young lady, a bit non-conventional if I might say. Her mother was muggle-born, you see. She had trouble adjusting to a lot of the children here.” Auntie summoned a photograph of much younger Elise standing next to other children, her hair artfully braided and that smug grin on her face Draco had witnessed firsthand. “I was so proud of her and Oliver graduating Hogwarts and going on to become Aurors.”
“Oh that silly thing? Elise thought she would free old Pibsy here by giving her muggle clothes, bless her,” the woman chuckled and gave the elf a disapproving glare.
So the Slytherin sat there like an idiot holding a glass tube with a dangerous chemical for what it felt like forever until Potter was finally satisfied and took it away to look at the numbers on the scale. A cold hand felt his forehead and when the git wasn’t pleased with that a cheek was pressed there and then his lips.
“How did you manage to get out of the ministry holding cell, Malfoy?” Harry asked incredulously.
“What do you want now?! Why get Kevin involved?! Let him go… if you want to have your vengeance. It is me you should only deal with!” Harry pleaded.
Draco fell to the floor, ropes twisting around him and making it hard to inhale fully.
“Because even your precious talented daughter couldn’t fish anything useful from me for weeks in the Interrogation,” Malfoy exclaimed. “Now, let my mother go!”
Harry cursed under his breath and gave his insufferable best friend the firewhiskey.
“What?! What again?! I swear if you won’t wake up right now I will kill you myself!” the blonde was reaching for his throat and choking him.
“Thanks, Granger… for being a friend to me,” Draco called after her quietly.
"Salazar, help me! At the Unicorn, where else?! I swear one day either Krystal or I will find you overdosed on that sofa and that would be a sad but predictable ending to Draco bloody Malfoy,” Zabini lamented.
“I want a meeting with him!” he demanded. “I want to see the … twat…. Him. I want to see him!”
The thought of Potter wanting him even when he was with some random bloke, made him desperately hard, and Draco wished they were in a more secluded and preferably warmer place so they could do so much more than some teenage groping in the courtyard.
“I don’t want a contraband piece of wood that belonged to some dead arsehole!” the girl objected, wincing when her hair got pulled a bit. “I want a proper wand of my own, purchased from a proper wandmaker!”
“I’d like to ask you quite a few questions myself… But clearly, you were reluctant to answer them earlier!” the Slytherin replied sarcastically.
"No. I can't kiss Malfoy." He said, incredulous.
Now we have the aftermath of an actual war – damn JK depriving us of some hella good angst (that being said, we'll take up the mantle, and do a better job of it lolol).
Harry nearly spat out his drink. This was not going to be all innocent and sweet. What would he be forced to do?
"Never have I ever talked to He-who-must-not-be-named," Lavender said, eyes flicking to two boys in particular. She grinned as Neville and Harry went for their shots but gasped when Draco went for his. The circle fell silent and Draco scowled, also quite drunk, "Don't act as if you never suspected, you bunch of insolent pricks."
They went around the circle, people got dared to kiss, to flash bosoms and steal firewhiskey from the teacher's stash. They also got made to tell their deepest, darkest,
"Harry, are you okay? You were screaming and shouting." Neville said, holding his wand tip as a source of light, "You're not still... you're not still getting those dreams are you?"
"Hermione, for the Transfiguration work McGonagall set, how long did she say it had to be?" He looked at her expectantly.
"That's not happening Padma." Harry put his foot down. He couldn't believe she would dare. Padma scowled.
"Don't feel too bad Malfoy, I was part of a fucking prophecy from day one. I couldn't choose jack in my life, let alone live a peaceful one. Remember how I nearly got killed in our first-year by a pimply looking git who was scared of his own shadow? I think that's when life truly went to shit."
"I don't know Potter." He leant forward and waved a finger in his face, "How do I know you're not going to manipulate me in this drunken state to tell you all my secrets."
Draco reached out for the handles and pulled the doors open – ignoring the dead weight in his stomach. There, illuminated in the light of the moon, sitting on the steps of the teachers table, sat Harry, face streaked with tears. His eyes were frenzied and his hands pulled at his hair, but as Draco entered the room, Harry stilled and stared.
There were only five people left, Seamus, Neville, Hermione, Harry, and him. Draco felt like he was gate-crashing a Gryffindor party, but also didn't really care. He also felt like he should stop drinking, but didn't really care. He took another shot, feeling it burn down his throat. He shook his head, feeling it and trying to clear it.
"Come to the kitchens with me." Draco commanded his voice to have a scrap of his former authority, "We'll solve at least one of your problems."
"Malfoy. Your turn." Harry spoke. It was only the three of them left. In some distant corner of his mind, Draco wished Hermione would leave.
"Why would they humiliate themselves anymore?"
Taking the invisibility cloak, he swung it around his shoulders, pulled if over is head and weaved his way from the great hall to the courtyard to beyond the grand staircases, and up the forgotten hidden stairs. Once climbed he began to wander aimlessly through the halls, trying to get away - anything to stop the thoughts from racing through his head. The pulsing memories behind his eyes stung, and the tears began to fall from his eyes, dropping onto the floor as he walked. He left a trail of teardrops in the dust from the battle. When the dust settled, no one was left untouched, surrounded by pain, by death. He shook his head to dislodge this thought, glimpsing through a smashed window the Hogwarts grounds littered with rubble and fires. Harry continued to wander.
It isn’t until you manage to catch your breath that you realize you’re playing with his hair, running your fingers through the strands against the nape of his neck. You let go. Malfoy sits back on his heels.
“Already took care of it,” Malfoy says, his voice rough.
You snap your eyes to his face, to shocked to say anything.
“God, Harry.” Draco squeezes Harry’s shoulders. “God, I don’t know if I can—“
Once Harry catches his breath, he shuffles over the side of the bed and swipes his shirt off the ground. He gently cleans Draco’s chest, unsure if he can handle his magic right now. He cleans his own hands and wipes down Draco’s thighs. The gesture is astoundingly intimate and Harry’s chest clenches when Draco hums a content, “Thank you.”
, don’t ever stop.”
He starts whispering to you, temptations of, “Yes, yes, bruise me, Harry, please, please bruise me.”
Draco squeezes his eyes tight, his entire face pink to the tip of his nose. Harry twists his fingers and Draco stutters, “Y–yes.”
“I know.” You squeeze him tighter.
It’s only when you grab my ankle and growl that I finally slide my finger inside. I still your hips with my hand—my fingers pressing bruises into your skin—because I need this as much as you. I need to feel you surrounding me; I need every single part of you surrounding me.
You sink into the pillow and close your eyes.
After a long, torturous moment, Draco parts his shirt and says, “If you start blubbering, I’ll walk out and you won’t hear from me for at least a week.”
You move your fingers to his jaw and squeeze, forcing him to look at you. You lean in.
And when we finally sag against each other, with a laugh on my lips and a smile in your eyes, with come on your chest and sweat on your back, with a kiss on my lips and a promise to stay the night, I still refuse to let you go.
And then you let me in. Slowly, slowly, so slowly I think I might die, you sink down and beyond any religion and beyond any god, I know one singular truth: I know how it feels to be inside of you.
Snogging on the Hogwarts Express had always given Draco a thrill ever since he convinced Theo to try it with him on their way to school in forth year. The vibration of the tracks beneath him, the countryside rushing by, the commotion of unsuspecting passersby just one thin wall away—he could never get enough.
Hermione is worried. Ron is worried. Molly’s worried. McGonnagal’s worried. They’re all so
He’s so close. He’s so, so close that you can practically taste the heat of his mouth.
“You’re filthy, Potter.” Draco’s chuckle turns into a gasp when Harry rolls his hips up. “Why doesn’t that surprise me?” He asks, but his snark loses it’s edge inside the breathiness of his voice and all at once Harry
“Is this what you want?”
You’re not any better off. You bite and suck on his neck because you need to keep your mouth busy or else you’ll let out a string of mortifying praises and pleas. You chase your own end—your grip on Malfoy’s thigh bruising, the mark on his neck growing. Your thoughts coalesce into a spiral of confusion and need until all you can think is that this,
It’s not long before you have him shoved against the tall bookcase, the shelves digging into his skull, his shoulders, his spine. Each shift of his body brings a wince to his features, his lip contorting where the blood streaks onto his chin. He gives up on pushing you and his fingers start to fumble with your trousers. You still, looking up at the ceiling as he frees your hard cock from where it was trapped against your fly. You move your hands to the shelf behind him and grip tight as you hear a another zip and a rustle of fabric.
He presses his lips together and shakes his head, eyes burning. He wraps his legs around your waist and his arms around your neck. You kiss him again and move.
He looks up at you and taps his stirring rod against his lips. You can almost taste the phantom touch of cool metal.
“No, you won’t,” you order. You fumble with his shoes and rip off his pants. You get impatient and spell off his shirt. “No, you won’t.”
You follow.
But you only smile and push me back down, settling on your forearms, pressing your arse onto my hips to cage me.
He stares out the window. You stare at the bruises on his neck. He swallows. You stare. He speaks.
His nostrils flare once, twice, before he drops his head against the floor and slaps the stone.
Draco drops his head to the pillow. “Fuck.”
You stand aside as he slashes priceless tapestries and smashes ancient desks, as he hammers at the stone and throws a stream of heat that melts the window pane. He destroys the room you’ve been meeting in for the better part of a year: the bookshelf where you learned what his hand felt like wrapped around you, the desk where you tasted him for the first time, the stool you threw him against and almost dislocated his arm, the closet door where he gave you a gorgeous black eye.
“Please,” Harry begs. “Please, I want it so bad.”
You punch him.
So I let you put your hand on my chest and brand me, push me onto the bed and climb on top of me, bring lips close to mine and break me, but even still, after everything—maybe because I’m a masochist, maybe because I’m faithless—I can’t help but gasp, “I didn’t know you liked men.”
Luckily, Harry is more than amenable to Draco’s little fancy—his hands had found Draco’s waist almost immediately, pulling him in as close as possible. Which is why Draco finds himself grinding his hips and panting into Harry’s mouth, close to coming in his pants from nothing more than the dull friction against his cock and Harry’s strong hands on his waist.
You don’t think he’ll let you kiss him, so you suck on his collarbone. You like the taste of his sweat. You bury your nose in the crook of his neck, and with each panting breath, your head is filled like a helium balloon with expensive cologne that’s been dulled by the exertion of your fight.
His head whips to the side and he reverently touches his split lip. He shakes his head a few times before he lifts it. He draws back his fingers and looks at the blood. He grins.
Harry quickly shuffles up, closes his mouth around the areola, and sucks. Draco arches up and goes taut as if he’s held up by a marionette string. He’s voiceless as he clenches down around Harry’s fingers and the first few spurts land on Harry’s chin. Then, all at once, he collapses against the bed and broken moans spill out of his mouth.
You take your hand off his throat and he gulps down lungfuls of air. His eyes are hazy and he slumps against the desk, but when you slow down, he squeezes his legs tighter around you.
A few late-nighters dot the common room. You give them a warning glare. Draco doesn’t notice them.
Your pants are shoved down to your knees and the stone wall is rough and cold against your naked bum. Your toes curl in your shoes and you can’t tear your eyes away from where Malfoy’s lips are stretched around your cock.
“I’m fucking obsessed with you, Potter.”
You can’t sit still anymore. You thrust your hips and Malfoy lets you, easing his grip and working in tandem with you. The
, I’m not going to beg.”
Draco sends them slowly tumbling, building towards their release, but he knows it isn’t enough to send either of them over the edge. He keeps them there—teetering, spasming, twitching.
Draco moans and grinds his hard prick against Harry’s. Harry keeps pressing right
Malfoy spits in his hand and wraps around both of you, his gloriously long fingers taking it all with ease. Your drop your head to his shoulder and bite on his collarbone through his rumpled and damp button-down. You have never—
Draco snaps his eyes open and Harry briefly mourns the loss of post-orgasmic Draco, but happily welcomes back his tetchy and contrarian boyfriend. To Harry’s surprise, Draco doesn’t refuse. Instead, he huffs like he’s entirely put out and sits up. He roughly yanks off his shirt, avoiding Harry’s gaze and carefully turning his left arm inward until he’s able to flop down on his stomach and tuck his arm beneath Harry’s pillow.
Malfoy’s other hand is tight on your shoulder, holding, holding,
Harry is about to swallow down Draco’s cock when he feels Draco start to clench around his fingers. He lifts his head and watches in amazement as Draco hold the pillow beneath his head in a death-grip and covers his mouth with his other hand as his cries reach a fever-pitch.
You’re outside with Ron, watching the twilight fall when you feel a stinging jinx hit the middle of your back. You wheel around, hand going for your wand, to find Malfoy standing there, buzzing with harsh desperation, his wand gripped tight in his hand.
Harry brushes his fingers against the scar bisecting his waist and Draco lets out a stuttering breath, his torso twisting towards Harry’s touch. He snaps his eyes to Harry, his mouth agape and so un-Malfoy that it shocks Harry for a moment.
“Call it,” he hisses.
“Yes,
will finally release the pent-up anger inside of you, will finally give you some sense of quiet.
But Harry knows Draco, too. He sees past the bravado to the person who wears long sleeves in summer, who clutches protectively at his collar when Harry dares sink his fingers to the dip of his neck. So when Draco brings a shaky hand between their bodies as if he’s hoping it goes unnoticed, Harry can’t help it that his heart skips several beats.
In his fantasies when his obsession morphed into infatuation.
He nods.
Your muscles tense. I feel you tighten. My ears ring. You rip your teeth apart and I feel the moment you shatter because I do, too.
It’s been thirty eight hours and you’re desperate for it.
“He’s gone,” he whispers. His eyes well up with tears again. “I can’t even say I’ll see him again when I die because he’s just
You bring your hand to his throat and he nods frantically. You squeeze and he arches back, his eyelids fluttering. His hand flies to his cock and he chokes out, “Don’t stop.”
Harry lifts his head up. “Can you take it?”
You bite on his lips, suck on his neck, leave angry red and mottled love marks that won’t fade for days. He scratches down your back—over your shoulder blades to the dimples above your arse—leaving stinging trails that you hope will scab and scar.
managed to get you hard when nothing else could. But you don’t laugh, because while it’s absurd, you need this. You want this.
You line up your cock and slide in with one long stroke. You kiss away a tear.
“That’s it.” Harry feels half out of his mind, feverish. “That’s it, Draco. I want you to come just like this and then I want to fuck you.”
“That it?” he taunts.
Harry wants to say something, tell Draco he’s beautiful because he knows he’ll get a fierce glare and even fiercer blush in return. But as Harry opens his mouth, Draco opens his eyes and fixes Harry with an absolutely salacious grin and Harry finds himself absolutely speechless.
to your skin. So close you only need to turn your head the barest bit and he’ll touch you.
Harry’s heart speeds up, something hot writhing in the pit of his stomach. “What does it feel like?”
He can hardly be blamed for his enthusiasm—it is their first Hogwarts Express ride as a couple, after all. He had to christen their lush professor’s cabin (and
Draco doesn’t give any indication that he’s heard, but he goes easily when Harry rolls them again. He pushes Draco’s knee to the mattress and buries his face in Draco’s silken hair. He brings his lips to Draco’s ear and murmurs all of the filthy and soppy and sincere praises that have been dying to come out and for once Draco listens, for once he doesn’t shut Harry down with a kiss or a hand to his mouth.
After a moment, Draco cracks an eye open and turns slightly to look at Harry. Harry isn’t sure exactly what’s written across his face, but whatever is there makes Draco drop his guard and his eyes soften before he sinks back down into the pillow. He keeps his forearm out of sight, but a sleepy smile grows on his face as Harry traces his fingers up and down.
You gingerly place your hand on his shoulder and he tenses beneath you. He drops his hands and stares into the night, and you realize you’ve never seen true rage on Draco Malfoy until this moment. Your courtyard spats and locker room fights seem laughable in the face of the buzz that simmers beneath the surface of Malfoy’s skin.
You ease up the pressure on his collar and stumble off of him. He stays on the ground. You watch, utterly fascinated, as his chest rapidly rises and falls in an effort to catch his breath. He stands and swipes his jumper from he ground, putting it on as he walks to the window, covering the damp white school shirt stuck to his back
I feel it in my gut, that molten, thick, and heady sensation, rolling over and over and over, traveling out into the world as gasps and sighs, but never quite bubbling, never quite bursting, never quite moaning. And all the while you smile at me with those ridiculously red lips that I used to want to punch, though I now understand why—because anything,
So you do as he tells you and drive into him with everything you have. He practically vibrates with overstimulation, but whispers encouragements in your ear.
Harry grabs onto Draco’s chin and brings their lips together as Draco reaches his peak, catching the wrecked moan Draco can’t hold back. Harry doesn’t stop, fucking Draco through his orgasm and beyond it, until he stills deep inside and Draco feels Harry’s orgasm overtake him.
He looks up when the door closes. His chest rises: one, two, three, four pants in quick succession as unsteady as your footfalls across the floor. You stop between his splayed legs. You stare at his mouth. You flex your fingers.
Because, you see, I’m fucking obsessed with you, Draco.
You find him in the courtyard between Charms and Transfiguration. Pansy’s head is in his lap and he plays with her hair as he talks to Blaise.
You suck on the tender skin where his shoulder meets his neck. You know he’ll heal the mark as soon as you’re done, but it’s nice to look at while it lasts.
You pick up his wand and walk him out of the classroom. The door closes behind you with a soft click. You don’t part at the stairs.
“Potter!” Draco put his hands on the git’s shoulders and shook him into clarity. He was a good inch and half shorter and looked at him almost tenderly with those glossy eyes. “You have to sleep that off! You have issues… Look at you! You’ve already gotten completely pissed at four in the bloody afternoon! And you definitely don’t need to talk to anyone. Not me, for sure!”
“I’ve brought a bit of our Memory Restoring Elixir for you,” she said, handing him a vial with a potion.
“You and Mr. Draco Malfoy. There was a probation meeting scheduled for him yesterday evening.” the man replied.
“DON’T!” Draco’s voice was embarrassingly shrill,  “Millie, whatever you do, don’t call the Aurors.”
“It’s highly regulated, Harry. Look here,” the girl pointed at the page in one of the textbooks. There weren’t any instructions on how to cook it up, only general information. “The Painless Poppy Philtre is a strong Opium-based sedative, muscle relaxant, and anesthetic potion. Due to its highly addictive nature and various side-effects only a family physician or apothecary can prescribe it.”
I just need a couple more chapters for all of it to pay off and then there is a nice foundation for the sequel.
She laughed and sat at the edge of his bed, her hand ruffling his hair playfully.
“Bloody thing is as stubborn as her owner,” he grumbled and turned the steering wheel sharply to the left, driving recklessly into the narrow alcove, hitting a couple of muggle rubbish bins in the process.
“We could have just dumped him at St. Mungo’s…”
“Thank you, TJ” Draco mumbled, distracted, and went towards the nurse’s post.
“Brilliant, just bloody brilliant! So now I have to just sit and watch him being treated like a fugitive by the Ministry?!” Harry was refusing to listen to any of their advice at that moment.
The girl put a stack of books onto the table next to the cup of tea that was still untouched. Some of them were simple unlabeled journals, bound in black leather, however, the others were quite rare titles related to Legilimency such as “The Art of Mindreading” and “Mindworks”.
“And just so you know, Potter, you are as straight as I am and it is embarrassing to see you deny it,” the blonde was tired of that little dance they had around each other and the words of encouragement from Granger made him bold and reckless in that situation.
Of course, the bloody bravado of that pillock made him go into an abandoned wizarding home without calling for backup. And Draco thought that only Harry had that self-destructing tendency. That was a characteristic of every single Gryffindor he encountered.
thought Harry. He had disliked any legilimens since those disastrous lessons with Snape during his fifth year at Hogwarts.
Amanda took out another stack of one hundred pound notes, thicker this time, and presented to the pathologist.
In these moments Draco understood why she had been sorted into Slytherin, Auror Baelish was as rustles as Pansy could be when she needed a piece of information from him. Only he couldn’t brush this girl off that easily, the legilimency spell was prickling his mind already, and he felt as though dementors were there in this chamber, waiting to take him to Azkaban.
“Oh,” Harry exhaled.
They both exhaled heavily when the wound was covered with a fresh layer of silver and wrapped up again.
"Seriously, you bloody junkie! How many times do I have to say to stop getting high here?"Blaise huffed.
"Oh, you can actually speak for once," she smiled almost gently. A fellow Slytherin on the other side of the law, she found these instances ironic.
You know mum and junk food… How’s old Mistress Black with all these muggles out and about the house?”
“He was at Potter’s,” his Aunt answered for him, “Cissy, you should have seen the poor lad…”
If you have any comments or suggestions I am happy to read them. It looks like it is going to be a longish story, so I hope you stay until the end :)
He realized at that moment that he would never stop yearning for this fascinating person before him, with all his dark humor and bad habits and even worse mouth and his strength and fragility, his rare sincere smiles, his raw desire for him and his ability to make Harry lose control and he hoped that the other lad wanted him as much.
So, I've decided to progress the plot a bit, don't worry these two won't stay like that for a long time. And Hermione is a badass here and I love her for it :)
“Mister Potter, Mister Malfoy, you need to hurry,” the man said urgently. “The Portkey is going to go off in ten minutes. Follow me!”
The Gryffindor opened the sliding door of the moving train and cried:
The game of battleship had ended abruptly when Draco stormed into the lounge area and dragged his poor roommate up by the collar of his standard-issued polo shirt. The older lady Isaiah had been playing with gave out a scandalized yelp and hurried away from the room.
Harry couldn’t believe that he was going to be married off like some sort of sacrificial lamb to do what? Continue cruel and old traditions that were not supposed to matter after Voldemort was defeated. It was more complicated than this, Tom Riddle was just a product of centuries of prejudice. He remembered his bigoted uncle and his obsession with appearing normal and ordinary in front of the neighbors and he felt that those poisonous remarks had left an imprint on his life as well.
“Grief has changed this boy,” he heard Andromeda Tonks speak next to him.
Another flash of colour.... a porcelain cup in his hand, the tea leaves at the bottom are showing the sign of Aries... strong emotion, fire. He looks to the right and sees the unruly mop of dark hair, a smile that briefly lights his face until it turns into a scowl at the sight of another boy looking at him.
“I can’t… I’m sort of dead to them,” he mumbled lamely.
Harry wasn’t completely convinced, but shook her small hand, nevertheless.
“You know, I can’t promise that,” Draco smirked.
“Here… Just a stiff like you’d asked. John Doe, in his early twenties, Caucasian, fair hair. Cause of death – a drug overdose,’’ the man in navy-blue scrubs and a big plastic apron gestured towards one of the heavy doors that were mounted into the walls.
“The Harry Potter?!” Haley asked in awe.
“What do you mean?” Draco demanded.
“She knows?” the Slytherin asked once they were sitting next to the opened stained glass window in one of the more secluded passages.
“Have a lot of that going on, don’t you?” Granger winked knowingly. “You really fancy him… Harry.”
“What happened, Harry? You can tell me anything,” Hermione asked for the umpteenth time since he came here.
“So you’re telling me that Ginny accusing me of fancying Malfoy is the sign that she wants to get back together?” he asked, confused.
“Patronus Charm... I guess some of us can kiss their career goodbye,” Ron mused, going through the booklet.
It was funny indeed. The ministry was so deeply involved in the in-fighting that a cunning muggle man like Fumihiro Kawahara was completely flying under the radar as his influence in the wizarding criminal underworld strengthened. He had his own potion- master, a drug dealer, a pathologist who had no problem with disposing of a body or two, a money launderer; and Legilimens, to name a few. Not to mention the fact that Kumicho was involved with Chief Unspeakable in the very ministry who had no idea who he or his daughter was.
* * *
“Hermione had told me you were being bullied! She has already spoken to the Gryffindor prefects but you should report the rest,” he advised him.
“Your patient has walked into the restricted access room without any problems,” the young witch said sternly not letting the nurse come through to where Harry was sitting on the tattered sofa.
The dark-skinned bartender produced two tall, colorful drinks for them. Harry took a tentative sip from one of them, noticing how strong it actually was despite its cheerful candy-like appearance.
He ran back to Potter’s room, not even caring about making too much noise or recasting the disillusionment charm.
He didn’t manage to finish his sentence when the wards started ringing, making everyone gasp and scream and cover their ears. A couple of ornaments on the Christmas tree and champagne flutes shattered from the sound as a group of people clad in crimson robes Apparated into the hall.
Harry convinced her to ditch the evening festivities at Hogsmeade and they both were in London before the sundown. After they said their goodbyes, Harry hurried back to Grimmauld Place to take the last portion of Wolfsbane and prepare for the painful transformation. He had no idea where Kawahara went afterwards, probably to have a good night’s sleep and not think about work until Monday. Their training had been exhausting enough without getting pulled into some useless patrolling the streets of London on their day off.
“Serves you right, you plonker…” Draco was already walking away.
"Malfoy! What's going on?" Weasley was relentless.
Disclaimer: This chapter is a big middle finger to J.K.R's ridiculous TERFy beliefs and I don't support those who agree with them.
“Maybe, you should just give up?” the Gryffindor said.
“She is in the attic. Had to demolish the wall to take her down,” Harry shook his head.
Now the Gryffindor needed to get to London by any means, and he even knew a perfect occasion.
The orchids and bright tropical bushes changed to huge flesh-eating plants that emitted rancid stench of rotten flesh to lure their prey, and then Harry noticed very familiar wrinkly heads of Mandrakes and deadly spikes of Fanged Geranium and it wasn’t a simple muggle botanic garden anymore. He couldn’t believe that there was a magical section to this greenhouse, smack in the middle of muggle London and he wondered if some unlucky visitor ever got themselves maimed or eaten by one of these monstrosities.
“Step aside,” Draco ordered and came closer to the child.
“Uh, how about you play us something?” Potter asked, trying to save the embarrassing situation.
That choice of words made his insides squirm with embarrassment and arousal, his heart picked up even quicker pace than before. Whose brilliant idea was to put Malfoy into Harry’s room in the first place? Now he had to use one of the countless guest bedrooms since Hermione and Ron were staying over too. He was about to move away down the corridor when long fingers caught him by the wrist.
Krystal is singing "I Put a Spell on You" by Screaming Jay Hawkins, but I personally love Nina Simone's version, which you can listen to
Draco had heard insults like these so many times he mostly memorized what they meant. She called him a bloody wizard. That was quite absurd considering that a large creature that looked like a white wolf was lounging on the floor next to her, giving Draco as nasty of glare as the girl did.
“Harry, I get it, I do… If you’re feeling better you can come to Hogwarts tomorrow and talk to McGonagall about it,” Hermione interrupted, trying to appease them.
“Malfoy! Wait! I need to talk to you!” Potter called after him.
“So what?! You’re just going to leave like that?!” Harry called out to him when he heard the car door slam shut and the engine start.
“Avoiding you!” the Slytherin said, “How do you always know where I am? It is beyond disturbing.”
“No… I didn’t mean it. It’s quite complicated magic,” Potter mumbled, embarrassed.
Draco gave the man a grateful smile, taking a polite bite.
“You may leave now… unless you want me to hex you!” he said evenly. The Slytherin didn’t need to ask again, in a moment the passenger side door closed with a loud thud, and he was alone in the car.
… blood on the stone floor… flutter of wings… a scream of agony… Jaques… his brilliant Jaques with charming smiles and wicked disregard for whatever his father might say… Jaques kissing him… Jaques lying on the floor blood pooling around his savaged body…
Malfoy lifted his hands, trying to avoid confrontation and slowly left the Mercedes. The cop turned on his walkie-talkie and said something. In a moment two stern-looking men in crimson uniform jackets came over as though they’d just Apparated there.
Draco was blissfully high. He stretched out his arms, feeling the wind rippling on the thin fabric of his standard-issue cotton long-sleeve shirt. His vision was a bit blurry from the drugs but he was still lucid enough to enjoy this sunset. He didn’t have the slightest idea what he had taken or how much of it for that matter, but somehow he wanted more. Needed more. The abyss before him did not look frightening, it was inviting. The sound of the ocean was beckoning him, lulling his sense of self-preservation and whispering a false promise that as soon as he stepped forward everything would be over… His pain, his complete lack of control, his nightmarish past, and even more sinister future would all disappear beneath the water surface.
He knew Narcissa would go over and beyond to ensure their safety after the Father’s death but he did not expect her to go that far. His stomach churned at the thought of that nasty man’s hands being all over his beautiful mother.
Harry did not expect his best friend to be so calm and rational when it came to his issues with Draco and he did not expect him to side with the Ministry on that one either.
“Was it bad?” Draco asked, vanishing the bloodied rubbish away.
Harry woke up to a massive headache and sore throat, the only thing he wanted to do is to bury himself back under the covers and stay there forever. He wasn’t ready to face the world after what happened, his mind too shy and too scandalized to replay the events. The boy’s dorm room was blessedly empty and Harry contemplated drifting back to sleep until he felt the edge of his bed dip a little and saw somebody in Gryffindor robes sit next to him.
” the girl huffed and looked expectantly to Malfoy, “Go on, he’s yours.”
The bullet grazed Weasley's arm, and he cried out in pain, clutching at the bleeding wound. His eyes widened almost comically. He was looking at someone behind Draco who made that shot. There was a low growl of an animal and a white wolf leaped and attacked Weasley, pinning him to the ground with two mighty paws.
“Harry, is something wrong?” Neville asked worryingly.
“All right, today I am assigning you the partners you will most likely stick with for the rest of your Auror career. These have been approved by the Head Auror Robards so if you have any suggestions or complaints, you can jolly well stick them up your bum since he is not the man to change his mind,” Savage guffawed and gave the group a sympathetic look.
“Who would send you a bunch of memories?” the girl asked.
“Teddy might not like the smell,” he refused.
The Gryffindor looked around the dining table at the somewhat solemn faces of his second family. There was no reason for him to upset them with the news that he was gay and would not be pursuing anything with Ginny just yet. He would say it eventually when all the eggnog was drunk and all the Christmas pastries were eaten and all the Celestina’s songs were horribly sung along with. Then he would say it but now was not the time.
“You don’t have to talk… Just let me see your memories. I promise, it won’t hurt,” Draco said softly already lifting a wand to cast a spell at the poor elf.
He had left like a coward in the night. He took Potter’s ghastly jumper with a golden letter H on the front, Scourgified his shirt clean from blood, and got dressed. All the ride to his aunt's place in the Knight Bus he thought of Potter calling him Draco, he thought of how fiercely he clung to him, his fingers leaving bruises on pale skin, he thought that he wouldn’t be able to forgive himself, that whenever he would have to do his marital duty he would think of Potter.
“They think you know something that you don’t… that’s too bad, really, I thought you were a smart cookie,” she smiled.
Sometimes he dreamed of Potter, of his dark eyelashes and beauty marks running down his neck, the sharp white lines of his scars, and how easy it was to leave bruises and love bites on his skin. He could almost feel his ticklish nest of hair under his fingers, he could almost taste those full always chapped lips that liked to smile so much for no good reason, he could almost smell tea and muggle shampoo and something sweet that made up his scent. But then he would see blood, torn flesh next that delectable collarbone, a stain of crimson spreading all over that beautiful skin and he would wake up and scream and sob and beg the guard to put him out of his misery.
The Slytherin was looking at him intensely, his face earnest, his pupils all-consuming dark surrounded by a faint ring of grey. He was eerily handsome, his pale skin flushed in the tones of pink, his always impeccable hair a mess, and his thin mouth open and panting. There wasn’t a person at that moment Harry had wanted more. He wanted Draco to take him to consume him to show him exactly what he was missing and the feeling made his head spin.
“You need to stop,” he said warily, “You just… can you please stay out of it for once?!”
… a familiar sterile corridor with uncomfortable benches is filled with people… middle-aged women in colorful scrubs... a flock of distracted looking youths with notebooks in their hands and fear in their eyes… old women are complaining to the nurses about the waiting time… further into the corridor… some silhouettes caught his attention…  two men in crimson jackets stand out from the crowd of patients and medical staff… they approach the old man who is sipping the same vile coffee from the paper cup…
“Oh, thank Merlin!” another male voice exclaimed.
“I don’t think this is something you can forget that easily, Ron,” he replied gravely.
He stumbled into the attic. It was filled to the brim with all sorts of magical curiosities, old furniture and suspicious objects that would feel right at home at Borgin and Burks. Harry thought of selling some Blacks’ possessions, but he was afraid they would end up in wrong hands.
“Potter… your wound,” he mumbled, trying to fight his panic.
“I will... after the incident at St. Mungo’s I am inclined to believe your side of the story” she smirked.
The black liquid from the paper cup tasted vile but there wasn’t anything else he could drink so that would have to do. The waiting room bench was hard and uncomfortable as was the glare of the fluorescent lights and the annoying electric hum of the vending machine. That contraption had spat out that nonsense some might call coffee into Draco’s cup a few minutes before.
There was a slight scratching coming from the boot but Draco paid no mind to it. He wouldn’t let the boy out until they were safely away from other people, preferably somewhere in the woods. It was the very night he dreaded for the whole previous week, counting days and setting plans and arguing with Blaise. His friend refused to let him use the club’s cellar for the child’s transformation again. That was why Draco had no choice but to venture into the night of the full moon.
“Hello there, handsome,” Harry heard dangerously close to his ear. He turned around sluggishly, nursing his whiskey on the rocks in one hand.
The smell of sea-salt and the strong iodine scent of seaweed hit his nostrils and a strong shiver ripped through his body. Draco realized that he was already up to his waist in the water, his clothes were floating around him like dead jellyfish. He gave out a desperate sort of laugh and looked back towards the shore. The beach was completely empty. Nobody would be able to save him if he moved forward.
He shook his head, banishing the thought.
She was wearing sparkly evening robes in bright fuschia and her chestnut hair was charmed into an elaborate updo. Her extravagant nails and makeup suggested that she was prepared for the show already.
“I won’t hurt you. Tell me how did you get in here?” he continued, but still there was no answer. “Can you bloody stop gawking?!” Draco hissed at the men, “Can’t you see that you’re frightening him. He might know something.”
If only there was a way to make her stop. To somehow get this fixation out of her head…
And then something utterly strange happened, there was a loud crash, and a person who was supposedly a muggle priest took out his wand and fired a spell at Narcissa. As soon as Harry saw a flash of green light almost miss the woman, the hypnotic charm was broken, and he could move freely and leap off his seat with a disarming spell at hand. The female Auror was faster than him, she was already there, battling the man.
The blonde gave him a nasty glare but then he shook his head resignedly and threw the bag back into the ambulance. Harry was alarmed to see that, even in this dire situation, Draco was trying to satisfy his addiction. He understood that he would need to have a serious talk about such behavior in the future but they had more pressing matters at hand.
“Hold still”, he ordered and Harry felt like the wounds on his neck and cheek started to pull themselves together.
“Well,” she grinned apologetically, “It is a muggle agency. And sometimes being mediocre is important for blending in. Robards would not let me be all up in his business with the Death Eaters if I were exceptional.”
Harry should have realized it sooner. The auntie had been using other men to do her dirty work and it had worked way better than any Imperius Curse. Fist Williamson and then poor Kevin. He was always so nice to Harry and even his shameless flirting was too innocent. He would never try drugging him on purpose.
She ran up to the piano and started bashing her disproportionately big head into it.
“Not get caught, preferably…” the blonde gritted. “We need to get to my car but I cannot risk using noticeable spells in front of so many muggles.”
The reason why he left was simple - he was about to be engaged to Astoria Greengrass, a perfect match from a respectable and wealthy pureblood family. That was what his mother would want for him, and Draco had given her enough grief not to fulfill his filial duty.
The Auror was completely out of it, he somehow mistook Harry, who was wearing a muggle red hoodie and jeans as someone from DMLE, which was hilarious albeit a bit messed up.
“I need him conscious!” Malfoy said quickly coming out of his stupor.
“It’s Draco. How many times do I have to say it… D-R-A-C-O!” he gritted dangerously and the room suddenly became as cold as the inside of a muggle fridge.
The dim light was passing through the cracks in the door to the interrogation room number 7-26, where a person sat almost motionlessly in the uncomfortable wooden chair. The metal shackles were attached to the skinny wrists. And another person, a woman clad in the crimson Auror robes was hovering over a man, no, a boy, bound to the seat. The boy was tall and looked exhausted and slightly malnourished. Blonde hair was falling into his eyes and he nervously shook his head trying to see the woman properly.
The Prancing Unicorn was the only wizarding gay bar that managed to stay open in Diagon Alley. It had lived through countless raids, conservative moral outrage campaigns, and skyrocketing rent for many decades. After the war, Blaise Zabini was managing the establishment with the generous donations from the Kawahara family that shamelessly laundered their drug money through it. The fact that the yakuza was patronizing the bar made it easy to stay afloat and even support the local queer community with various events. One of those, a drag night, was hosted by one and only Krystal Ball, a stage name of Krystal Goyle.
He heard the footsteps in the corridor and recast the spell just in case before an old man in the short white robe accompanied by the two nurses burst into the room, looking all business.
He tossed her the wand and walked in.
Harry wrenched his head away from his grip and spat out the potion, the taste still lingered in his mouth and he was wondering if it would still be enough to work. He was breathing heavily, too scared to swallow his own saliva. There was no way he could induce the vomiting, his hands were tied and his mind was still bleary from whatever tranquilizer that was there in the muggle injection.
In the moments like these, he truly appreciated her being his partner. Most of the time her face showed little emotion when it came to working. But between the two of them, there was a healthy sense of comradery that Harry would expect from someone like Ron or Neville. Kawahara had just started training with them a week ago. And yet she had been a decent challenge in the practice duels and a great sport when it came to enduring long and sometimes mindless tasks that trainees were often assigned to.
The night only gained momentum from there. After flashing her bosoms at everyone Lavender turned to Draco, a dangerous glint in her eye. Draco chose to be dared. Harry suspected it had something to do with his connections in the Dark Wizarding World and the information he didn't want to be shared. The truth would be dangerous for either of them. Padma whispered something in Lavender's ear, shooting glares at Harry. Harry's stomach sunk. He didn't like what was coming.
"Get fucking on with it, will you. Move on, next statement. Don't fucking stare at me like that, I'm not showing anyone."
His temper bristled, "Look you fool. If you stay out here any longer in this drafty hall wearing nothing but boxers and a t-shirt, you are going to freeze and have a lot more problems than what you currently have. So either sulk here and freeze, or sulk in the kitchens and have a warm bowl of soup. Use your head Potter."
(See the end of the chapter for
His voice had got oddly high pitched and he tried to blink away the burning sensation that was growing behind his eyes. Feeling almost ashamed of how pathetic he seemed, he threw his covers off him and grabbed his robes, "I'm going. Enjoy your little pity party."
Lots of love,
"When using fluxweed in healing potions to cover for mishaps in animalistic transfigurations, one must capture the ever-changing essence in a bowl of a pure metallic form – preferably iron, cast with a spell of durability. Yes, that sounds ok. Being acidic – No that's not right. Fluxweed is alkaline isn't it." Draco mumbled to himself, focusing on the sounds of his words rather than his spiralling thoughts.
He rolled over in his bed. The kiss had felt like a thousand fireworks bursting across his lips and mouth, and just the feeling of the boy being close to him, Draco shivered at the thought. He opened his eyes in the dark and for a moment wondered if he should try and fall back asleep, but the scene kept playing on a loop in his mind, a wonderful loop.
Harry sat inside his compartment, trying not to talk about the elephant in the room. He'd spent all summer at the Weasleys, trying to avoid them, spending time in his room, in George's room and nowhere else. He hadn't spoken for weeks after and only recently had he actually joined them at meals. Now, sitting in the same train compartment, where they had first met, nearly overwhelmed him. A stinging pressure built behind his eyes. He pushed his hands over them to hide the tears building.
“Miss, the Malfoy kid is here,” another person said and the door to the room opened. Draco saw the priest tied to the leather chair and the vampire and the agent standing next to him, wands pointing at the man’s scowling face.
He often dreamed about being there, falling down into the mouth of a fiery beast, trying to grab something and losing his grip. Draco knew that somehow he managed to survive the fiendfyre, he just didn’t remember how. Was that another instance that had been wiped away or was the event so traumatic his brain had shielded him from it? He may never know now.
“I can drag your arse over to Pomfrey or worse, a prefect, and then the Savior of the wizarding world will be scrubbing the trophy room for months. Do you want that?” Draco exhaled.
“I do too, mate, but you could’ve talked to us about it first…” Ron added quietly, “Malfoy’s on the run now, so it majorly cocks up his chances of ever being acquitted. Maybe Kingsley had his reasons to keep that lady free.”
The flickering neon lights were in stark contrast to the sleepy cobbled Diagon Alley. The sign that said ‘The Prancing Unicorn’ was illuminating quite a big crowd that gathered, waiting for the bar to open. A gaggle of young wizards and witches, dressed in colorful robes and stylish muggle clothes were chatting eagerly.
“And what exactly is considered not pure? When you suck someone’s cock? Or when you wank them off? Or when you put that cock in the orifices? How pure are we now, huh, Draco?!” he asked, annoyed. “Weren’t you the one who told me that it was okay for me to be whatever and to pursue whomever… well, I want to pursue you, thank you very much!”
"Malfoy, I am arresting you for trespassing, possible kidnapping, treason, illegal use of Legilimency, disregard for the Statute of Secrecy. And several other charges that Head Auror Robards would like to read to you personally," the ginger said.
“Oh for the love of Merlin… do you have to make it sound so vulgar?” Harry groaned he wasn’t sure he would be able to discuss his abysmal sex life with his dorm-mates.
... Harry heard a rustle of material and then something warm and heavy covered his shivering body... he must have fallen asleep somewhere in the castle... Long fingers were stroking his hair… the surrounding air smelled of menthol cigarettes and citrus aftershave…
“Why are you so nice all of a sudden?” Megumi demanded, her cheeks turning pink from embarrassment.
“Even if there were any… do you know how to use that thing?!” Draco called after him.
“His probation officer was murdered last night!” Robards had the nerve to shout at the woman.
Someone cast a spell and an uncomfortable shiver went down his spine forcing him to wake up.
“What are you doing here… aren’t you supposed to be in class?” he mumbled, horrified to see her so oblivious to what actually transpired after she had left that wretched courtyard.
"No old farts and they need to be without bad habits! The aftertaste is just unbearable," the pathologist demanded. "What are you planning to do with that Auror? He looks palatable."The man pointed towards McLaggen.
There wasn’t any. And then he remembered that he was still wearing his hospital gown and not much else and they escaped from being apprehended by the DMLE earlier that very morning.
“Are you sure about this?” Draco murmured not yet answering his advances.
You want to laugh at the sheer absurdity that
bite.
Harry’s eyes are alight with mischief and lust as Draco climbs off of his lap and steadies himself. He has his buckle halfway out of his belt loops when Harry says, “Everything.”
The common room is empty and your roommates are asleep. You fall into bed. You don’t dream.
He narrows his eyes, and leans down, daring you to back out. A droplet of sweat trails from his hairline to the tip of his nose. You go cross-eyed trying to follow it. He tilts his head in confusion, and the tiny bead of moisture drops onto your bottom lip. You feel the splash, and you part your mouth to collect it onto the tip of your tongue.
“Yes. Yes, Potter.” Malfoy’s voice hitches at the end and he finally starts squirming beneath you. He scrabbles at your shirt until your buttons are undone and he can run his hands all over your skin, the cool metal of his rings leaving goosebumps across your chest.
You wonder if he likes the pain of a good fight, too. He must, if he keeps meeting you like this.
, choking on a moan.
to when I’m with you. With you, I just can, I just am. I can fight, or fuck, or bite, or hold, or, yes, even love if you’ll let me (you will), and you’ll take and take and take with a greed like no other.
“What do you want, I don’t understand,” you desperately say.
Harry throws the shirt off the bed and leans down to press a gentle kiss to Draco’s lips.
“And I want you to put up a fucking fight.” Malfoy pushes you away. You stumble back and he pushes you again. “
“What?” He asks when you’re already halfway up the staircase.
You yank on my hair and move my head to your will. I bite on your shoulder as you hiss in my ear, “Sit up.”
You take advantage of Malfoy’s current distraction and buck your hips up to flip him over. His eyes are squeezed shut and his hand flies to his face to keep them covered. His mouth drops open in a silent gasp when you use your grip on his thighs to drag his body down and align your crotches together.
Your heart leaps into your throat and you dig your nails into him.
“No.”
You say his name over and over, and you’re not sure when, but eventually he collapses against you, turning into your chest and scratching at the skin of your waist as he desperately holds you. You stroke his hair and press kisses to his crown.
the one you desperately imagine when you’re alone in bed. “What is it you want?”
You conjure lube onto your fingers and bite down hard on his pec as you enter him with two fingers. He arches into you with a groan and rolls his hips, fisting a hand in your hair. You pull away to find a perfect set of teeth marks right next to one of your scars that slash down his chest. You lick the sweat from his skin and twist your fingers.
He kicks at you and takes another swing, narrowly missing your ear and making contact with your cheekbone instead, so you climb on top of him and capture both wrists, pinning them to the old wood. Your face throbs. You’re both panting.
Harry hardly has time to gather his bearings before Draco’s sure hand wraps around his cock and all thoughts frazzle out of his mind. He grips Draco’s hips, marveling at such a large expanse of unobstructed skin, and squeezes tight when Draco slowly sinks down. His breath leaves him in a woosh when Draco bottoms out.
As soon as Draco loosens his grip, Harry kisses his way up to the spot on Draco’s neck that he discovered after their third official date—the one that makes Draco boneless. He sucks and pulls the skin between his teeth, refreshing the mark he left there just days ago, Draco’s desperate breaths filling his ear and making him lightheaded.
You obey. You feel the fire rushing from your heart down to your fingertips. You push him back and then grab at his collar.
“He’s gone.” Malfoy blinks up at the ceiling and you despair at the tears that well in his eyes and then disappear. Like magic. “My father’s gone and I didn’t even know until after it happened. And. And I know once they find out, everyone’s going to be
. You want to tear him apart and see inside of him, you want to eat him whole and attach him to your soul, you want to break him into a million pieces and keep him inside a jar.
His lips brush against your neck, gentle for only a hint of a moment, before he catches a tendon between his teeth and
was he forced to languish in third-rate coach cars as a student when the professors’ car is practically luxury-on-wheels?) or he would never forgive himself for wasting such an opportunity.
Harry’s hips stutter, and it’s Draco’s heaving chest—sweaty and flushed and marred and absolutely gorgeous—that does him in. At the last second, Harry pulls out and his orgasm rips through him as he comes all over Draco’s torso. He feels broken and whole as the heat engulfs his entire body. Through the haze, he can feel Draco clutch weakly at his wrist, his entire body trembling beneath him.
Harry breaks away from Draco’s lips just enough to place his hand over Draco’s and ask, “Can I?”
Harry studies Draco’s body, the permanent damage he caused in a moment of resentment and betrayal and fear, and while the guilt is there, pressed against his lungs like a boulder, it doesn’t crush his heart as he always feared it would.
You move feverishly against his leg. When he finally releases you, you bite his arsecheek as you feel your cock pulsing in your trousers. Your stomach tightens and you come
“Everything,” you say, and I know it’s true. “Give me everything.”
He knows it’s slow going, and in many ways the road has only just begun, but with each step they take, the scars they bear lose their hold over them. They’ll never disappear and they’ll never forget, but as Draco hums and presses against Harry’s gentle scratches, he realizes that somewhere along the way, and quite by accident, they’ve managed to forgive each other.
, coming for
You look down and see Malfoy tucking his spent cock back in his pants and vanishing drops of come off the floor at your feet. You dig your nails into your palm and desperately wish to know exactly which moment Malfoy came. You know better than to ask.
. But.” Malfoy drops his face into his hands. “But that’s my dad.”
So, when you finally get your cock in his arse, and he tells you to, “Stop being so fucking gentle, even Theo was rougher than you,” something twists painfully inside of you and you find yourself pressing him further into the wall, snaking your arm around his waist as if you can trap him there forever.
I can’t think, I can’t breathe. And I realize, not for the first time, that I don’t have to, I don’t
You feel him hesitate before he drops his hips back down. His arse connects with your cock and you realize, with a start, that you’re hard. You haven’t gotten hard in ages. You thought the war might have broken you.
Malfoy lands a punch on your cheekbone. The shock is enough to throw you off-balance into the desk behind you. The edge digs into your spine, a sharp point in the haze of your world. You plant your hands, push off, and lunge at him. His eyes widen as he goes down.
that I feel every time I look at you, touch you, talk to you, think of you. I need you to feel the way it hurts, the way it rips you apart with a pain so great it can only be described as pleasure. I know you get it, I can hear it in the way you beg for more even after I wring you dry.
,” Malfoy growls as he goes for a fistful of your hair. You grab his wrist before he can and throw him down against the professor’s desk. He hisses when the corner digs into his spine and his free hand pounds against your arm. You take every blow and lift him onto the table, pushing him back and holding him down with a hand pressing painfully into his collarbone.
You hear Malfoy’s breaths take a desperate edge and he moves furiously beneath you as if his time is running out. You know he’d never ask you to finish him off, and you don’t care to examine why you need him to come too. You move your hips, biting your lip through the overwhelming buzz of overstimulation until his thighs squeeze you tight and his nails dig into your arms and his entire body pulls taut beneath you.
In his fear when Draco laid in the hospital wing, writhing beneath Pompfrey’s heaviest pain-relief spells.
“Keep going,” he demands, “Don’t stop, c’mon.”
Ron makes to move towards him, but you hold him back. Malfoy doesn’t even seem to notice. His eyes are trained on you. You tilt your head in question. He takes a deep, shuddering breath, and turns on his heel and stalks towards the castle. You mumble something to Ron; some vague assurance you can’t bother to make genuine.
You strip off his clothes and he moves where you direct him, lifeless like a dress-up doll. You gather him into your bed and spell the curtains shut around you. He turns to you in the darkness and traces gentle fingers against your jaw. You hold your breath, your arm tight where it wraps around his waist.
“You misunderstand,” you say, your breath hot against my ear. “It’s only
“Okay.”
The next time you meet like this, you don’t bother with the fight. You shove Malfoy’s pants down and bend him over the desk. You’ve been devouring all of the filthy literature you were able to smuggle out of the Restricted Section—Malfoy’s turned you into something of an addict—and there’s one thing you’ve been burning to try.
“Give it to me,” he whispers. “Give it all to me.”
. It’s too much.” Draco tugs on Harry’s hair. “Fuck, it’s too much.”
Harry uses all his will to still his hips, clenching his free hand in a fist as he adds a third finger to Draco’s spasming hole. Draco starts shaking beneath him, his moans turning into mewls.
“Come on.” You nudge him to stand. “Come on, Draco, let’s go to bed.”
“I’m not.”
doing this to him. You. Potter. Potter with the popping
, though,” he begs.
Draco whispers praises into Harry’s mouth, voice pitching with every practiced thrust into his prostate. He feels himself twitching, his core burning, and he wraps his hand around himself in desperation.
“Flip,” Harry grunts, grabbing hold of Draco’s thigh. “Flip, Draco.”
Malfoy’s hand moves from your hair, to your neck, to your chest, restless in his exploration. His strokes start to stutter and he almost starts to squirm and you watch as his cock twitches before he tenses and spills all over his hand, all over your cock.
“Yes?” Harry bites down on the deep scar that runs across Draco’s stomach and groans in satisfaction when Draco sobs out,
“I don’t care how. However you’ll let me.” You push in a third finger, hovering over his lips as you beg. “I’ll give you a black eye. I’ll bite you. I’ll scratch you. I’ll suck bruises in your skin. Whatever you want. Whatever you want.”
mmm. Prepare yourselves.
The battles which had been evenly matched for too long tipped in the students' favour, and they celebrated, victorious. Harry had won. In the middle of the Great Hall, he stood, adrenaline washing from him. Finally, he had defeated Voldemort, finally the war he'd been a part of since his birth was over. Holding Draco's wand in his hand and the Elder wand in the other,  watching Voldemort crumple to the ground, he expected to feel somewhat happy, satisfied even, but as his eyes fell on the crowd beyond Harry just felt numb. Was this it? He had closure now, but why did he feel so empty?
"What are you doing here, Malfoy." Harry snapped.
"Never have I ever," Zacharias shot glances at Draco, "gotten a tattoo."
Harry leant forwards as well and smirked, "I don't know Malfoy. Maybe you just have to trust me."
"Harry," Neville repeated sternly, "I did not put up with a year of torture from the Carrows to be dumb to actually believe you when you say you're fine. You're shaking and sweating and you've been bloody screaming for the past half hour. I don't believe you, one bit."
"I don't see you moving any closer."
"She doesn't know?" Didn't Harry tell his friends everything? Draco's brow furrowed. He didn't know where this was going or where this had exploded from, but it was his fault for bringing it up in the first place.
"Malfoy, no one knows!" Harry cried.
Draco twisted his face into a look of disgust, "No need to shout Potter, I am the only other person here. And I should ask you the same thing. What are you doing here?"
Harry shook his head, "Nah, s'alright. Just not..." He trailed off and looked pointedly at
"Hermione, I think you were wrong." He turned around to face her.
It's not fate, it's the author's authority.
Harry glanced at him, then back out the window, but kept an ear out for Hermione's expected answer.
This coming chapter has a lil more angst, a lil more spice so I hope y'all like it ~

"I was going to the kitchens, but heard someone, so I came to who it was and found you." Draco said matter-of-factly, carefully avoiding the topic of crying or breakdown.
Harry grabbed his shot and drunk. Neville did the same. Everyone else stayed oddly still.

George was covered in blood, sobbing into the crook of Fred's stiff, cold neck. Half his intestines were hanging out of his body, and his legs were mangled to the point where Harry wasn't sure whether they were legs or mangled bone. Harry's stomach heaved, and he felt his lunch travel up his throat. Fred still had his boyish half-smile plastered on his face, George would never smile again. Shock washed over him.
Across the circle a flustered Hermione stood. Without saying a word she grabbed the rest of the booze, and her jacket which she'd discarded earlier. The boys watched her leave. Harry swore, "Shit. Hermione! I can." The door slammed shut and he sighed, "I can explain. Goddamnit."
Harry screamed for help.
Harry stalked out of the dorm and down into the common room. Everything was still dark. Lighting a few candles, he saw his potions books still open on the table. At least now he had the chance to finish his homework.
"Way to make it obvious, guys." He muttered into his curry.
It was Harry's turn. Draco surveyed him, everyone watched him waiting for his 'Never have I...'. The black-haired boy grinned lazily, "Never have I ever been bottom."
Why was he this early anyway? Didn't he have a gang of friends always surrounding him at all times? Surely the boy-who-lived was the most popular person in the year, had friends. Had friends that were at least, still alive and kicking. He started to tap-tap-tap his shoes down the hallway. Harry turned to look at him, almost as if he was expecting someone else. Seeing Draco he frowned. Draco glared right back.
Lavender smirked, "I dare you to –"
"You didn't specify what a kiss was Padma," He retorted, "Or how long you wanted us kissing."
Draco cleared his throat. Harry stopped and glared at him, "What do you want, Malfoy."
"Hiya Harry." The Irish boy nodded at him, "We've been looking for some seventh years to hang with, mind if we sit?"
"You can't tell anyone about this Potter."
"Never have I ever used the Cruciatus curse." The words had left his mouth and he couldn't take them back. What had made him say it? Maybe. Yes, that was it. He wanted to know if Harry really had tortured or killed, which part of the statement he truly agreed with. But surely no.
Hermione still has a brain, but I have none. I have an exam on Wednesday and instead I'm on this cursed site reading. What have you guys done to me? I have a love/hate relationship with this site right now.
The Gryffindor shifted in her seat, "Truth."
"It was the last thing I saw." Draco subconsciously ran a hand over his scarred stomach, "Before well, everything went all... before everything went to shit."
"Potter."
"Soo... how were everyone's holidays?" Neville broke the silence, yet again.
Draco tipped his head back and leant against the wall. He hadn't wanted this moment for himself, but in the way of protecting himself had harmed others. He felt bad for feeling bad, hadn't his father called him spineless, unable to do a thing to pull himself up even if it meant pushing others down? He was selfish, and a coward. Coward, coward, coward. His Dark Mark wasn't even worth anything, just punishment for his father's mistakes. His thoughts spiralled, and he opened his mouth and eyes in a bid to push himself out of his mind.
"Take a good look at the Slytherin table."
She bit her lip. This was a touchy subject in their year. Less like an elephant in the room and more like an elephant in Hogwarts, no one wanted to mention the empty beds and small classes, "I think..."
After that, it was a steady flow of seventh-years, all dressed in casual clothes, all looking ready to do something scandalous and forget the war. He greeted Lavender and Padma, Zacharias and Terry – everyone seemed at ease with each other. Around him, people started talking, Hufflepuff to Gryffindor to Ravenclaw, everything was going smoothly.
"Hermione, it'll be fine. Seamus is getting his booze, people will come. Everyone wants to well, get drunk and forget everything."
The fighting had stopped, he noticed, quite a while later when he pushed open the lead eyelids of his. It was quiet. Peaceful even. He drew a shaky rattling breath, then spluttered, then coughed, then winced as the rubble shifted above him. He tasted blood on his tongue. Glancing around the hall, he saw no one, all was quiet. There were no pit-pattering of steps, nor the murmur of voices, nor the shouts, screams of curses and hexes and spells. The battle was over, or so it seemed, had they all left without him? Surely not his mother, his father maybe yes, but no – more tears dripped down his face, steadily gaining momentum, as the gravity of the situation pushed down upon him. His pale hair stuck to his paler forehead, sweating as each breath became more of a concerted effort to stay alive, each breath shorter and shorter. Like an old man, he wheezed, struggling to find the air to breathe. His vision swam, and black dots appeared whenever he blinked. His body began to shiver. Blood pooled in all the wrong places.
"Oh yeah, Seamus, lots of times. Holidays come around and I have the house to myself, all you gotta do is go down to the strip club and get a small room there." He shrugged, "It's nothing big."
"SOMEBODY –" He broke off mid-scream, interrupted.
Draco caught it and watched in shock as Harry stalked away. Around him, students snickered. Face hot, he needed to redeem himself, "Shut up all of you, the next person who giggles I'll hex."
Draco heard him before he saw him. He heard the sobs coming from behind the ornate doors and wondered who could possibly be behind them.  With the cold wind ruffling his hair, stinging his face, and hunger pinching his stomach, the thought of having to console some random fourth year there and then was not on his agenda. Yet something tugged in his brain, something kept his feet rooted to the spot where he stood before the doors.
"You know I couldn't do that." He glared at her.
A pink blush spread across her cheeks, but she didn't hesitate to answer, "Oral."
Draco hung around after dinner, waiting. After six years of animosity, it felt odd to be waiting for the boy he hated. Except, he wasn't even sure about that anymore. He tried not to fiddle with his robes, as he watched the crowds pass. First the first years passed through the doors, nearly knocking him back, the crowd double the size it was last year. He guess the decision to repeat everyone's year had some drawbacks. Then the other years left in dribs and drabs, all of them looking tired but content, with full stomachs to boot. Draco dropped his gaze as he began to see faces he recognised, then lifted it as he remembered his families reputation.
I'm back!
"Never have I ever killed or tortured another human being." She smirked, eyes only for pale-haired Slytherin boy.
Anyways, leave a comment on what you'd like to see in the future, or what you liked about the past – Are there any other ships you want to see out of the limited people left?
Narcissa hugged her son and pulling back said, "Don't get into too much trouble. You're here for your N.E.W.Ts, nothing and no one else, remember that. I love you Draco."
Hermione rubbed the stub of her left arm. The train rattled along the tracks and Harry glanced out of the window.
The common room was nearly empty when Hermione decided to approach Harry about it. Her idea. He was sitting on the floor, quill hovering over the one section of parchment trying to find the right words. He had decided to make a concerted effort on his studies this year, which was proving harder than he initially thought.
If Fred's death had shocked Harry, he wasn't prepared for the person lying equally still beside him. As soon as he saw Ron's freckled face, a sob tore from him. His heart fell. His hand flew to his mouth to stifle the next strangled sob. His best friend. No. Oh, Merlin.  No. This couldn't happen. He shouldn't have died, he was the brightest part of Harry's life. He saved Harry so many times, how –. His eyes shifted to Hermione. She sobbed beside Ron's body, her lap pooling with blood. As his eyes adjusted, he saw something even worse, her left arm from the shoulder down was... missing. He broke down crying, and in the middle of the Hall, surrounded by people mourning their families and friends nobody thought anything of it.
secrets. As long as he didn't get picked Harry was fine with that.
He raised both eyebrows.
Draco didn't know what to do. He didn't want to aggravate Potter, but that as the only thing he knew how to do comfortably with the boy, and neither of them wanted to fight. There was nothing he could do to comfort him either – he didn't have the right to fix the hurt of others having cause so much of it himself.
She took a deep breath, steadying herself, "I think I would invite everyone from our year. The few of us who are left, anyway."
Hehe,
Hermione looked down at her hand and shifted in her seat, her face growing red. Harry looked away politely, knowing how deeply she felt their losses. He turned back to his parchment and measured it again, "Would you invite
It was by far the most empty. Of the now sixth years, he saw only five people and as his eyes travelled up to the end of the table he was shocked to see the empty seats. It was as Hermione said, no one had come back to redo their final year. Yet in the furthermost seat, he saw someone.
Harry nodded, not trusting his voice. He leant on Hermione, trying to get Ron off his mind.
The room was tense, and nobody could really relax. They had all suspected Draco, the boy knew as much, but Harry? After that, all the statements targeted either of the two boys and their's became surprisingly mundane. The night wore on, and the bottles emptied and the seventh-years began to stumble more and more on their words, casually breaking out into hysterical laughter. Harry slurred and continued taking shots, and Draco watched him get more and more drunk, as he himself downed many more. Draco filled with warmth from the firewhisky and he felt like he could take on anyone. Anyone but the entire seventh-year population who seemed to have it out for him.
He cried and he cried. His chest squeezed with grief. He was suddenly taken back to the few weeks he spent at the end of the summer at Grimmauld Place, turning to anything to ease the pain – alcohol especially. Memory upon memory, a laughing face, a happy soul, Harry wished he could tear his mind from his head, to stop this pain, to stop all of it. The wind picked up outside and the cold bit his bare feet and nose. He sobbed into the crook of his arms, much like George sobbed into the crook of his dead brother – the war had left unwilling survivors. His heart ached.
"Harry!" She exclaimed and dropped all of them. He blinked and focused on her.
"Lavender, truth or dare?"
Harry and Hermione entered the Grand Hall quietly with Seamus and Neville. The Hall was a lot quieter, a lot more subdued than Harry remembered. The younger years were chatty, glancing around at the obvious decay and whispering to themselves, but the older years sat quietly, too many empty seats around them.
The distraction he obviously needed, Draco took his shot, placing his glass down a lot more quietly. The two boys watched each other with tired eyes.
Harry stood in the room alone with Hermione. She paced lengths, muttering to herself. With each passing minute, she got more and more frantic. It was ten minutes after nine and not a soul had shown up. She repositioned the couches, the rugs, even changed the hall hangings to a more neutral colour. That was okay, but after she adjusted the rug in front of the fire for the fifth time, Harry had to intervene, if not for her sake then the sake of his sanity.
"Well, we need to have a break every now and then, and after the war, everyone's in a bit of a funk. We could all loosen up a little, have some butterbeer and firewhiskey, play some innocent games and talk. If V...Vol...Voldemort was trying to split us apart he's done a good job of it."
Harry's lips met his, and sparks flew in Draco's vision. He closed his eyes and fell in love with the warmth, the feeling, the pleasure that was spreading around his body. Harry's lips were smooth and fine against Draco's and Draco melted into them. Their mouths moved in harmony. It felt right, it felt bloody good. Draco broke the kiss and stared at Harry.
Harry awoke in a cold sweat. The dorm was quiet in a way that wasn't quiet but was still too quiet for someone whose heart was beating a mile a minute. His head throbbed and for a second he thought his scar was the cause, but then his memory kickstarted and his face grew hot. Why the hell had he kissed Malfoy? He knew his drunken self was a flirt at the best of times, but that wasn't for his friends to know. His secrets had grown in multitudes since the Battle of Hogwarts and he didn't want his lovely drinking habit to become anything but what it was – a secret.
Draco began to chuckle and after a few moments, Harry started to laugh. Both their voices were rusty and their faces strained with the effort. For the first time in a long while the tears they cried were not the product of sadness, fear or pain. They wiped happy tears from their cheeks. The sound of their laughter echoed through the near-empty hall. From where Hermione was standing at the end, books in a satchel swung over one shoulder, she could see everything. She saw the banter and the laughter, and the sharing of the toast. Hermione knew what she had to do.
"Not if I get you first."
"Wow really?" He responded, muttering through his quill, eyes scanning his scroll, "I can't believe I wrote left when the hand motion is obviously to the right. No wonder I couldn't transfigure that frog this morning, I was waving the counterspell."
Seamus winked and made a motion with his hands. Hermione didn't so much as turn a shade, though Harry's face reddened slightly. Draco watched as Neville also stood, much less drunk, and supported his friend. Draco realised that he would have to get down to his dormitories as well, a cavity opening in his chest when he realised he would have no friends to support him.
“Don’t be silly, dear, it’s your home. Who am I not to help our brightest ward?” the matron pats her hand and hides the glasses away…
The Gryffindor glanced around in a haze. They crashed into something on the stolen ambulance.
Aunt Bella was just on time to stop the inevitable, she roughly dragged Draco to his feet, and told him to get out, called him a good for nothing poof who cannot fend for himself. The parents were told that there had been an accident while hunting... It was summer before he received the Dark Mark...
**** Ootani-kun, katazukete! - Otani, clean up!
The wizard waved his wand and took away the glamour. An ugly face of Crabbe Senior was glaring at him.
“There was a connection… between me and Tom Riddle. He would get into my dreams and I could feel his emotions. I don’t think I can handle any more reminders of that,” the dark-haired boy confessed.
“She knows,” Harry confirmed gravely.
Kawahara also sometimes smelled of tobacco, but Harry never saw her smoking. Maybe she was one of those secret smokers, who were too ashamed to show their bad habit to their colleagues. And she rarely smelled of sweat or blood like other Aurors did, but it was probably due to her impeccable hygiene and overall spirit of put-togetherness she had about her.
Harry had never seen Malfoys behave like that, they usually looked completely composed and proper and devout of emotions.

“I came here not to guzzle your party poppers,” Draco cut him off coldly, “I need my usual order along with 27 flasks of Polyjuice potion.”
The Slytherin grabbed the most passable things out of those that Potter lent him and started dressing in a hurry, his jaw clenched and fingers shaky. A couple of spells slicked back his relaxed hair and the mask of Malfoy he wore around to protect himself was firmly in place.
“Hey, guys. Mind if I join you?” she asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco made no effort to move. He was still standing at the door and eyeing the people inside suspiciously. He still couldn’t believe that they managed to capture Yaxley without alerting the whole muggle town and half of the Ministry of Magic. But he was wary of the fact that there was no Witch Watcher squad coming into the funeral home to apprehend the Death Eater.
“Who are you? Who sent you?” the blonde demanded, finally finding his composure.
***Ki ni naru? - Are you curious?
“Hop in, Potter, before I changed my mind!” Draco flicked the wand to the ignition and the engine purred to life.
“On what grounds?!” she demanded, “The Ministry has no right…”
“Why are you such a child, Potter?!” he exclaimed annoyed. “Shacklebolt released me only because he was afraid I will make his little cover job public. My silence is his insurance to remain a Minister after letting this barmy hag keep operating the orphanage without any sanctions.”
A white queen was dragging his poor knight to haul off the chessboard. Harry was distracted all evening, losing to Ron miserably. Ginny was working on her essay at the library and Hermione went off to check on the Potions’ project, so it was only boys that were sitting around the fireplace in Gryffindor common room.
It wasn’t as though Draco didn’t suspect it. There was a full moon recently and Harry showed a surprising amount of strength for someone who had been lying unconscious in the muggle ICU a few hours prior. But someone else acknowledging it was unbearable.
Draco woke up sometime during the night, he felt too hot and smothered by a heap of covers thrown over him. He saw Potter’s head slumped on the sofa beside him, the idiot was dozing off in a sitting position, crouched on the floor, still wearing the same sweater from last night. Was he really there watching over him? The Slytherin realized that he was naked from the waist up and belatedly noticed a new change of clothes put on top of the blankets. He suspected that this place was an old Black residence, modernized and made to look like an exceptionally dull muggle house. The furniture and magical objects were still there but there was a muggle screen, a telephone, and electric lamps everywhere. He could say that it looked cozy and the creepy atmosphere that a lot of wizarding houses possessed was gone and replaced by that strange wizarding and muggle blend that was Potter himself.
“Shut up for a moment…” and then he closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.
He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, trying to make the words come out, “There was another person that I liked… It feels like it was a long time ago. He was my cousin, on the Malfoy side. His family would come every summer to discuss some business deals with the Father and we would just explore the manor together. Sometimes we would fool around, hide somewhere on the property and behave like foolish children we were. The summer after the fifth year Aunt Bella escaped prison and brought a couple of her associates to the Manor. Fenrir Greyback was one of them… He killed him. I saw all of it… and that’s why…”
He didn’t feel particularly possessive over the magical item, they had spent many occasions hiding under it together over the years. However her adamant refusal to tell him the real reason behind needing the cloak had urged the stalker in him to creep up to the surface.
“Harry…” the lad at the steering wheel asked in a strained voice. “Are you alright?”
“The keys, the muggle keys… they’re usually somewhere in the corridor!” he levitated the dresser and made a makeshift barricade out of it, while Draco was frantically rummaging through drawers in search of the object.
He was in the middle of nowhere, some road stretched through the countryside when the realization hit him. Somebody’d definitely modified his memory. A moment ago he couldn’t even remember that he preferred men.
Malfoy paused. So he wasn’t imagining it. It was true. Well, at least he knew that Nott was not connected to him whatsoever.
“Harry,” Ron yawned.“Have you seen what time it is? You’re lucky I fell asleep in the sitting room.”
“No! There is! I know just a person! Just… Just trust me, okay!” and then the foolish git was running downstairs, the door swinging in its frame like a pendulum after him.
Their noses crushed, teeth clanked and the frames of Potter’s glasses dug painfully into his cheek, but he was kissing him, scaring him into submission, refusing to let go even when the other boy’s fingers were trying to push him away.
Draco couldn’t fathom that saint Potter would be lying through his teeth to save his nemesis right now. However, the git was involved somehow anyway, so he wasn’t much of a saint after all.
“What is the meaning of this?!” Gareth Greengrass shouted. “The DMLE has no business barging in here unannounced!”
“Draco Malfoy, you will do as I ask or you are one foot in Azkaban! Do you hear me?!” the girl shrieked, making him wince a little.
“I am gay… I should’ve never lead you on like that,” Harry announced and he was relieved to see that at least those words were honest.
The agent gave Draco a once over and shortly concluded: “A traffic collision… and… I would really appreciate it if he was the one driving.” She gestured towards the dead muggle.
“You s-shouldn’t be… um,  looking for trouble, now that you’re on prob...”
He came up to her, taking a hairbrush out of her hand, and started slowly untangling her straight black locks. It would be such a shame to damage them with peroxide for his sake. But the Polyjuice potion usually started wearing off at the crown of one’s head. And it was only a matter of time before someone would notice Megumi’s jet-black hair turning into platinum blonde.
“Amanda… Isn’t she your sister? You look similar,” he explained.
“B-but...”
“It is rare for a Black not to cry before getting a match for marriage,” she said soothingly and patted his blonde head. “You have to be a man in this situation… or you can always do what I did.”
“You guys are mental! It has been three weeks already and the more I look at it the further it is from being done!” sighed the ginger, returning the hug.
New York mobsters used to keep gay bars in business and inadvertently helped the LGBTQ+ community in their fight for equality. I wanted to pay a little homage to that with the Prancing Unicorn. Also the name is simmilar to LOTR the Prancing Pony, because I love this trilogy.
“You are a terrible liar, Harry. I know you…” Ginny looked heartbroken. “I would’ve understood if you did not love me anymore but this... How could you do it to us, to the memory of Fred? You know what he… what his family has done… It has been only three months since the war has ended and you…”
The Slytherin knew what would happen next, the Cruciatus curse attacked his strained nervous system, sending him into the abyss of agony. He was too anxious about his mother to dissociate, feeling all of the impact. The ropes tightened, preventing him from writhing on the floor and he felt like lack of oxygen made his mind swim, he was about to faint, to plunge into sweet oblivion.
He knew that Potter woke up from his coma a couple of weeks ago but he did not expect him to be on his feet already, visiting his godson and appearing in his life so nonchalantly.
” the Slytherin yelled and glass shards and wood chips scattered everywhere, creating a passage for their escape in place of the window.
The dark-haired lad wasn’t Potter...
“You are the Savior… Order of Merlin First Class and all that rubbish,” she snickered unashamedly, not even trying to give him a hand.
“We can’t go to that man just yet, mother!” Draco said determined, “I still have some unfinished business in London…”
The train moved, and he saw that Draco was walking towards the passage between the platform 9 and ¾. Harry stood up suddenly and ran out of the compartment.
“Why not?”
They were in the Northern wing, in the piano room. The instrument was covered in a thick layer of dust. It was obvious nobody touched it after Draco and his students.
A lonely seagull made a line in the air, not even fluttering its wings, catching the wind on its feathers, and soaring across the gray sky effortlessly. The sun was slowly emerging on the horizon, lighting the heavy clouds and murky water. There were a few visitors on the Brighton beach this early in the morning. An old lady was walking her poodle and some jogger was stretching before a refreshing run. They did not expect to see a vintage Mercedes-Benz roll onto the wooden pier.
* * *
“Hey… wait! I suppose we can Apparate to Hogsmead!” Potter shouted.
“No!” he heard himself say.
“Then. Get. Away. From. Me!” he gritted inches away from Potter’s stupid bespectacled face.
He had started this meaningless project only to stay together with his friends and stop bloody thinking about the events that happened this May. They had lost so much and so many people died because of him.
Draco pulled away immediately, panting and looking at Harry’s face, terrified.
He saw a bushy-haired head pop into his secluded space and look at him worryingly.
The whispers grew louder and professor McGonagall had to shush a few especially disruptive students.
He realized that he probably needed to deescalate the situation, however, his bloody mouth just wasn’t listening. Something was amusing in the way that female Auror was terrified of a big bad Death Eater who was just barely of age.
“I dunno, mate. Maybe… I would say, it’s not anything one should be taking regularly. Pomphrey would not even give it to any of the students… Trust me, I’ve tried,” Ron said begrudgingly.
“Not really, mate. But what did you expect, she was a Slytherin... They are not afraid to step over a couple of corpses for their ambitions!” Ron pointed at upstairs clearly talking about the semi-conscious blonde currently lying in Harry’s bedroom.
Harry looked at the sky, trying to find the moon poking through the canopy of trees, it was Waxing Gibbous, almost full that night. If the beast attacked him, there was a chance that he could get infected by the lycanthropy.
“He doesn’t know about it,” Harry shushed him. “And I want to keep that way!”
“Mister Potter and his friends believe in our cause and therefore will be complicit, especially since it concerns your freedom and safety,” the Minister replied and stood up and showed Draco that the conversation was over. “It is my advise for you to keep whatever you know to yourself if you don’t want to see your family’s... and Mr. Potter’s reputation plummet to the bottom.”
Harry was there with his Auror squad, all dressed in brand new official crimson uniforms with gold lapels. Head Auror Robards had been droning on about representing the DMLE at the event for the whole previous week, so they had no choice but to wear the robes that were entirely too hot and constricting for the weather. Next to him, Neville was fidgeting with his collar that pulled too tight around his neck, and Millie Bulstrode was casting cooling charms to keep herself less sweaty. Hermione was there too. Her department didn’t have any official uniform so she was dressed in loose formal robes that looked much more comfortable.
He didn’t care one goddamn bit if there was a whole squad of DMLE waiting to arrest him. There was a small chance that the Orphanage’s wayward magic wards were strong enough not to give away his transgression. In any way, he really hoped that him saving the bint’s life would count for something. She cast a full body bind on the veela and moved towards Potter to check on him.
The blonde used the charm and miraculously the equipment froze and stopped beeping. It bought them some time to unhook all the wires from the Gryffindor. Harry sat on the edge of his bed, leaning heavily on Draco’s arm for support and breathing unevenly.
“I don’t have much of a choice,” the girl replied, “But you know, at least you seem like a decent person. Unlike my previous suitor.”
“And was there any harm done?” the woman asked simply. “ Those younglings have no recollection of their minds being meddled with… However now… after you’ve exposed me to the press, they have no place to go anymore… It is all your fault, Potter. And to think of it! You are an orphan as well. Have you no compassion?”
“My place”, Harry suggested as they started to ascend the narrow street among muggle apartment buildings. “You are injured, you need some potions!”
Harry was relieved to have her old self back and prepared to listen attentively.
“Oh Lawdy, now that’s good mornin’ to ya,” Isaiah drawled when he saw their room. “Did you do somethin’ bad, Jacob?”
. He has looked at this hair and these hands and this neck and this jawline long and often enough to know that it's definitely him. A wave of relief passes through him and he realizes that Potter is, indeed, alive.
“You… Aren’t you dead?” Harry asked tentatively, “Am I dead? Again?”
He wasn’t breathing. His skin looked almost gray in contrast to his brightly colored polyester jumper. His neck was bent unnaturally, it seemed grotesquely comical. His platinum blonde hair had a streak of crimson in it. It was splayed wildly over his forehead covering a deep wound. That was the way they found him, slumped over the steering wheel, wand broken and a thin strip of blood at his mouth. That what Harry had seen on the still muggle photos the police had provided.
“Shut up! You bloody martyr!” Draco snapped at him. “We’re escaping together… and I will knock you out again if I need to if you refuse to cooperate!”
"I am sorry, I wasn't trying to pry. She's just my partner, and I wanted to ask her out for a drink," Harry was trying to explain himself as best as he could but he still felt as though he had majorly cocked something up.
“Who’s doing that? Who’s looking into my mind?” Harry demanded.
“Yeah,
“Mister Malfoy,” McGonagall interrupted his daydreaming. “Do you care to explain to me the real reason you wanted to be in my office?”
Pibsy continued shaking her head, her gaze darting around the classroom as if to find where to escape. Harry wasn’t sure he would be able to persuade her to go with them or give any statements, but he needed to try.
“Shall I accompany Kobayashi-san to the client?” Draco suggested without enthusiasm.
Muggle club music was blasting on full volume from the speakers, and many excited youths were breaking the sweat on the dance floor, some way too close to each other for Harry’s comfort. He was grateful that his mediocre glamour spell worked well enough in the sparsely lit bar and nobody was trying to strike a conversation. He made his way to the bar counter, where a dark-skinned lad in a scandalously tight sheer synthetic shirt was serving complicated-looking cocktails to the patrons. The bartender looked eerily familiar, and he could have bet he had seen him at Hogwarts.
“Thank you for your cooperation,” Malfoy smiled carnivorously and punched Nott straight in his sneering face, “And this… is for calling me a faggot!”
“I was trying to help! They tried to silence you, but they cannot do that to me,” Potter exclaimed.
“Mr. Malfoy!” a muggle lady at the front desk greeted them. “The flower arrangements were delivered this morning. We will be ready to have the viewing soon”.
“Yes!” the girl replied with a huff.
“Ron?” he called faintly.
“Now, now, you don’t want anything bad to happen to your precious mummy, do you?” he asked with false concern. “Let’s cooperate and nobody would be harmed… much. Where are the memories?”
The girl sighed heavily and pressed the tip of her wand to his temple, extracting a thin string of memory from his mind. She charmed a vial and put it away into her robes.
Listen! I don’t think he’s breathing,” a rough voice was right above Draco’s ear.
“Oi! Pibs! Piiiibs!” she screamed and the house-elf Apparated into the room.
“Fine. I will write you a standard prescription. It might be a bit too potent, but it will do for the meantime,” she exhaled warily, “But you need to get him to talk. Those monsters who abuse children need to be brought to justice!”
It looks like I can't help but turn this into a murder mystery, the boys are going to hook up soon, no worries.
