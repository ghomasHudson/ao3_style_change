His husband followed their son into the room at a more sedate pace. “It’d still be in better condition than before you fixed this place up.”
Like magic, Scorpius lit up and immediately forgot about being sullen. “There’s going to be trick-or-treating, Father!”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh come on, you saw how he played the situation.” Harry laughed, pulling him closer. “Ah, I’m going to end up wearing a bloody costume, aren’t I?”
Potter just smiled and pulled Draco towards him so that Draco’s back was against his front. Strong arms wrapped around Draco’s middle, Potter burying his face where neck met shoulder. “You know I’m not actually the all-knowing being some people think I am, right?” Potter reminded him, voice slightly muffled. “You’re smarter than me anyway, you’ll come up with better advice than I ever could.”
dating an ex-Death Eather, he’s just seeking attention. No, no, he was adopting a charity case. Well, his achievements are
Harry opened his eyes at the dip in the mattress and smiled goofily. “Brilliant Halloween, don’t you think?” he whispered.
“Father, it’s really unfair that I get magic and the others don’t,” Scorpius complained, fidgeting as Draco fussed over his hair.
“We’re coming, kiddo,” Harry laughed, kissing Draco’s cheek and holding out his arm. Draco took it with an amused shake of his head.
They stayed in that position for a while, quiet and contemplative. Potter was completely relaxed, occasionally nuzzling his face against Draco’s skin.
“Not too rough, boys,” Harry called out before kissing Draco’s temple. They sat down again while Draco had stirred his tea. “That was magnanimous of you.”
Because of Draco’s history, he was almost as recognizable as Potter to the public and those who hated him felt that they were finally allowed to yell it at his face: He broke Harry and Ginevra Potter apart. He's put the Saviour under a spell. His changed behaviour was to give the world a false sense of security. He was somehow harming the beneficiaries of his charity work. There was
Perhaps it didn't help that he himself doubted his intentions. People spread lies about Potter, but he couldn't muster the same level of certainty when it came to himself. After all, it wasn't so long ago that he was the boy who only knew how to spout shite.
“Of course we get candy, it’s Halloween!” Draco shot Harry a look, but didn’t protest. He’ll have to keep an eye on his boys but he’s determined to regulate the sugar. Oh Merlin, the sugar.
More kisses peppered his face and he could only melt against the gentle ministrations. “I believe you,” Potter whispered back. “I believe you.”
He looked at his husband who still looked just as excited as their six-year-old. If partaking in this odd tradition meant that the shadows were further from Harry this Halloween night, then how could Draco refuse?
rid the world of the Dark Lord as a baby. His parents died in a car crash. He was secretly the heir of Slytherin. He either made up or hallucinated the Dark Lord's return. He was a criminal that had to be put down. He could take all the needs of the world upon his shoulders because that was what he was
Harry was joking, of course, but Draco was reminded of how no shadows crossed his husband’s face tonight despite how a scant few hours before donning their costumes, they were by his parents' graves. Even if he hadn’t ended up enjoying himself, Draco would still go to all the hectic parties and wear the silliest of costumes a thousand times over if it meant that Harry would always look as peaceful as he did now.
“Like how you get really really grumpy when Father beats you at Seeking?” Scorpius asked, the epitome of innocence.
“Do you want our precious Scorpius to grow up like this one over here?” Harry joked, making Teddy stick a tongue out at him.
Harry gave a loud sigh from where he was sprawled over their sofa. “Give it up, kiddo. It’s best you learn early that you should avoid the word ‘contest’ around your father.”
Potter raised an eyebrow but didn’t call him out. “I think…" Draco waited. "...That we’re all just trying to find our truths.”
“He’s going to hide and spook you,” Scorpius informed Draco when they finally stepped outside. His conspiratorial demeanor gave way to disgruntlement. “
Harry looked at him sharply. “I know you’re excited, Scorpius, but your father’s been working. We’re the ones bothering him here.”
Interacting with fellow parents wasn't deplorable at all. They were a bit excitable though, especially about the fact that they were a sort of association that planned everything. Draco privately thought that he could do a bit better than cardboard graveyards and faux cobwebs even without magic. And if he got that chance, he’d definitely cull the seemingly endless pumpkin-theme...
“Don’t play with your food, Theodore, and no snark at breakfast,” Draco scolded before turning back to his traitorous husband. “You didn’t even think to warn me that I’d have to
Harry grinned at Draco’s horror. “Hey, don’t hate on the classics! But don’t worry, your father would
Draco’s smile widened as he leaned into the frankly glorious massage. “Yes, of course. You never let me forget it.”
“Oh alright, as long as Teddy joins too.” Twin whoops came from the excited duo and Draco couldn’t help but smile fondly.
win the costume contest, ensuring his excellent mood. He had worn a simple all-black ensemble with some dirt and leaves for effect, but the
Draco immediately groaned. “Ugh, don’t be vapid, Potter.” One of the couch pillows hit Potter's stupid head. “Save me from your fluffy nonsense.”
“Hey, it’s not my fault the other kids talked about their mums and grandparents making their costumes!” Harry argued, dabbing at where he spilled coffee on his shirt. “He got fascinated, I reckon.”
“Hush,” he scolded his equally spruced-up escort. Harry was wearing a long black coat with an upturned collar, with his canines extended with a glamour. His lips were wine red. “I’d rather not traumatize the children. Or the Muggles.” If Draco had agreed, they probably wouldn’t be able to get their hands off each other. Indeed, Harry looked gorgeous as a dark predator and he knew that wearing the more appropriate prince outfit didn’t stop Harry from wanting to devour him. Not that Draco would really mind the action, just the audience.
Harry ruffled his hair affectionately. “No problem, kiddo. Why don’t you tell your father what you were so excited about?”
He drew in a deep, painful breath and then said, “Er, well you see... I have this cousin Dudley- whale of a boy really- and well, see, he and his friends don't like me too much, and so yesterday they grabbed me from the park and ruffed me up a bit. It's not really as bad as it looks. Really. I've had far worse before.”
Remus blinked at Harry’s question in surprise. He had obviously assumed that Harry was going to ask him to leave. “Yes. Though sometimes I can be a bit crabby on the days before, and a bit tired on the days after. Especially if I don’t have any Wolfsbane Potion that month. Wolfsbane Potion,” Remus explained having noticed Harry’s confusion, “Is a potion which allows me to retain my human thoughts and feelings while I’m in my werewolf form. It can be quite difficult to come by sometimes, as it is an extremely hard potion to make. Thankfully though, Professor Snape has agreed to make it for me during my stay at Hogwarts.”
He turned away as the men haggled over illegal belongings Lucius was selling and glanced around the store. The room was filled with dangerous objects, but a seemingly normal cabinet caught his eye. He was about to touch it when two things stopped him. First, he was sure he heard a muffled sneeze from inside the cabinet. Second, Lucius called out from across the store, “Remember Draco, touch nothing. If you think I'm buying you anything after you let that filthy mud-blood Granger get higher scores than you, then you are even dimmer than she made you look!”
“Yeah, but what about this time? Because Dad says it was your Uncle.” Ron questioned a bit more assertively.
Harry and Hermione had agreed, and Harry had tried to ignore the one possibility none of them had voiced. Maybe Malfoy really had changed over the summer. Still, Harry had decided, it wouldn't hurt to keep a close eye on him. If he actually had changed it would be evident soon enough.
Draco wasn't quite sure when exactly it had started, the gradual realization that his father wasn't really as great as he'd always seemed when Draco was younger. He guessed though, that it had probably started around the time that he had left for school.
“Albus... there are major signs of years of abuse. How is it that no one has ever noticed? More importantly, how did Poppy miss it when Potter was in her care at the end of term?” Severus questioned.
Now though, Albus knew that he had made a terrible mistake. What good were the bloodwards if his relatives tried to beat him to death?
“Leave him alone, he didn't want all that!” A young ginger girl exclaimed with a glare. Obviously she was another judgemental Weasley.
“Come, Draco.” It's funny. (In a completely humourless way, of course.) Lucius had been saying that exact phrase for years, but Draco had only recently realized his father was calling him like a master would his dog. Draco hastened to catch up with Lucius and hoped that Potter would be able to follow.
“Harry dear, I know you mean to comfort when you say that you've had worse... but that's really not a good thing. I'm ready to take you to a healer right now based solely on the injuries I can see, never mind what you're hiding under your clothes. Surely you must know you don't deserve this kind of treatment. Why haven't you told anyone?”
“Oi, urm… Harry what was that? You just froze for a moment there? What was that about?” Neville asked, concerned lacing his voice.
He stopped running to check, disappointed, he continued running. It seemed this dominant wasn’t worthy. He wondered if any of them were, if none of them were able to catch him he wou-
His door slammed open and his uncle stood there in all his furious glory staring at him. All too quickly his uncle charged at him. Pulling off his belt and holding the end without the metal fastener in his hand and started whipping Harry so hard, "COUNT THE WHIPS BOY!"
Harry raced ahead of Luna and Neville. But half-way to the train he stopped mid-step. Harry got this dazed look on his face as he stilled until he shook his head confused for a second before he kept walking. Luna and Neville exchanged looks behind his back before boarding the train with him.
Harry glanced up at the clock every few minutes or so. At 10 minutes to 12 Harry put down his book. He sat at his table looking out onto the streets of Privet drive. He glanced at the clock every few seconds, willing the time to go faster. Though he never knew why, there wasn't anything to celebrate anyway. It became tradition for Harry, to stay up until midnight on the eve of his birthday, and greet himself a happy birthday.
On the way, Harry regained some of his excitement and started skipping again, to the relief and amusement of Pansy.
“Ok” She went back to wolfing up her food. Harry was sure when her instinct would be suppressed she would be so horrified. He giggled to himself already seeing her face. He turned back to his food when she started glaring at him.
Like Draco they were all determined to have this sub as theirs, but unlike Draco only 2 of them were able to win his affections. The others prayed that the submissive would let them participate in the hunt for him, even if there was no chance.
“Because I want to,” Draco said, adding mashed potatoes to Harry’s plate, no gravy. Before passing it to Harry “Is that a crime?”
Harry was released and ran as fast as he could. There were dominants nearby. They needed to prove to him that they were able to track him, protect him, that they were worthy. These dominants, none of them were worthy until they could fight him. He needed to make certain that they were able to protect him from anything, even if the threat was himself.
“Oh, Thank you elder.” Harry smiled at the elder before he left and the trio continued on their way to the castle to move their thing into their new quarters. Pansy wasn’t needed yet since she wasn't one of the submissives that had a lot of dominants vying for her attention. It wasn’t that she wasn’t good looking but she was very intimidating. She could make any dominant cower at her feet, all except one.
2 more days until the hunt and Harry was practically vibrating with excitement. He had a gigantic smile on his face, and he was practically skipping down the halls. His excitement was starting to rub off on the people around him, so the Slytherins were mostly affected. When they were around him they wouldn’t be as harsh and there was the tiniest quirk of the lips that would disappear within the minute, but nevertheless it was still there.
Harry snuggled back into the warmth of Draco’s chest. Wrapping his arms around Dracos torso, making sure to wedge himself deeper in the dominant’s hold. It was starting to get colder, and Harry never really liked the cold after the Dursley’s, so it was nice to be able to snuggle up to a body so warm he could act like a heater.
And Harry ran off, he heard a roar of a dominant veela not far behind him as he ran away trying to make it difficult for the dominant to catch him. He weaved through trees at top speed making sure to take sharp turns. Harry didn’t know how long he was running, but it was quiet and it seemed as if he had lost the dominant.
Draco did, he started growling softly. “I will make him fall for me, I won’t force him if he doesn’t want me, but I will do my absolute best to make him mine.”
Harry was curled up in the armchair by the double doors to the balcony half-asleep as he watched the sun go down. He kept gazing back at Draco as if trying to convince himself that he was where he was. In the couples hall, with a mate, with
Since there was only 1 bathroom Draco had picked out what he was going to wear while Harry was in the shower and had entered after him. Harry zoned out while waiting for Draco to get out of the bathroom, and when Draco did, Harry turned to ask him if he was ready to go. But paused at the sight of a shirtless Draco, towel wrapped around his waist body and hair still damp. Harry's mouth went dry as he took in Draco's pale skin shining with water and toned upper body.
Umm... I don't really have a posting schedule, because that pressures me then I end up writing nothing at all, just please be patient with me, please. Also, I am still working on my grammar, etc, this is also not Beta'ed so there might be some mistakes that I may or may not have slipped over, sorry.
She didn’t realize that it was already this cold even though it was in the middle of November. She was starting to get chilly, her hot chocolate the only thing keeping her from freezing. By the time she realized that she was a witch and there was such a thing as magic, she also remembered in her grogginess she had left her wand on her dresser table. Settling for a weak wandless warming charm, it wasn’t the best since she was hopeless at wandless magic, but it was better than freezing in the cold.
"Well then, Harry James Potter, would you like to accompany me to Hogsmead next Saturday?" Draco asked, smiling down at the smaller male.
As they continued to get comfortable with each other, the more confident Harry got about their mating. He was even ready, and heavily anticipated, the time when they would complete their mateship and have sex. The kisses that Draco was giving him, were like a nice appetizer to what Harry knew would be an amazing meal.
“Yah… we are such big idiots. I’ve liked him since first year as well, but I only noticed last year during the Yule Ball.”
“Hey, Harry, look at me.” Draco said, using his finger to turn Harry’s face towards him. “We’re going to get through this together love, you're never going back. I’ll never let you.”
Draco was really looking forward to going back to Hogwarts, especially when he could act like himself outside of his dormitory and common room. Draco also was looking forward to being able to act nice to people now that his father didn't have his “Malfoy’s are cold” reputation anymore. He was going to try and get closer to his raven-haired crush. If he was able to have a good friend relationship with Harry he would eventually ask if he could court him.
“Are you sure? You should be hungrier after all the hormones we’ve been taking.” Draco said, turning to face Harry.
"How could I not like you? For the record I've liked you since I saw you in that shop in Madam Malkins, I've liked you ever since. But really Harry, how could I not like you, you save people and you give the wizarding world hope, especially when you vanquished... You-Know-Who last year during the last task. What isn't there to not to like you, besides the fact that you can be such a stubborn git at times but I love you for it even though every time we've interacted before hasn't been so pleasant, but I plan on changing that if you let me." Draco said clearly meaning every word of what he said.
While wiggling closer it dislodged the comforter, and Harry noticed how much colder it was. The window was open and the cold winter air was blowing into their room. A particularly strong gust of wind made Harry shiver suddenly feeling like he was submerged in a pool of ice water. Draco's warmth seemed more inviting than ever, it was warmer than the blanket wrapped around his shivering body. So why not.
But no he wasn’t your normal submissive. They needed to work to get him. So he made sure to move around constantly to make sure they wouldn’t be able to track him.
Pansy, Draco, Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle were once again in a corridor on the way to the library where Pansy arranged for them to meet up with the Golden Trio to study as well as put into motion the next part of their plan. When they arrived in the Library Hermione and Pansy started to study in the bay window together, Hermione helping Pansy with her "good subjects" while Pansy helped her with her not so good subjects. Eventually everyone broke into their groups with Blaise and Draco joining Pansy and Hermione studying for an upcoming Potions Quiz, while Crabbe, Goyle and Ron started talking about quidditch.
"Are you sure, like 100 percent?" Pansy asked, staring into Hermione's eyes, hiding her emotions once more.
Draco looked at Harry, it looked as if he was about to cry. Draco pulled Harry to his chest and buried his face into Harry's hair. "I'm so sorry you had to go through that Harry, and oh Merlin! The fact that I added to that while we were in school, and bullying you, I'm so, so, so, sorry, nothing will be able to describe how sorry I am" Draco said ranting, running his hand through Harry's hair. Harry looked up at him, seeing how sad he was, he was ranting so fast it was so hard to understand him, if he wasn't around Hermione so often, he wouldn't have understood a word that he would have said. Harry kissed him to shut him up.
Draco glanced at Harry, his mate was perfect. So beautiful, Draco felt himself melt whenever those emerald eyes were fixed on his own. His mate was glowing with the light of the sun going down. He was curled up on the armchair facing the balcony, while Draco was on the couch across pretending to read his book, while instead observing his mate slowly drift off to sleep.
Pansy woke up, she didn’t know what to expect, but she hoped that they were out of the enclosure by now. She wanted some time to snuggle with Harry if Draco would allow her. She didn’t know she had gotten herself so attached to the younger male, but honestly, it didn’t freak her out as much as she thought it should. Pansy never knew she wanted a sibling until recently when she started to get to know Harry.
And he was coming closer to the cave. Draco panicked, if the submissive were to scent him out in the area he would for sure run away, and Draco would lose his shot. So Draco decided he would fly up to the tree by the entrance of the cave and wait for the submissive to come closer, he would have a better shot.
If the mated pair did not come out by the next day, they would have to send a search party out just to make sure that everything was okay inside the enclosure.
Harry stumbled toward his wardrobe opening the door and peering into the mirror. Staring at his reflection he gasped. He looked so different. Yesterday when he checked himself in the mirror he looked normal, with his extremely messy mop of pitch-black hair, his green eyes (that were previously looking dull and hollow), kinda muscular body, and build.
Harry had a dopey grin on his face. His Dominant was Draco Malfoy. Harry was oh so very happy about that, and judging from the look on his face, it didn’t look like Draco minded either.
“Well honestly, I just wanna curl up with someone… stronger, more dominant? It’s a weird feeling, I dunno how to describe it…”
“I mean that does make sense,” Harry said after some thinking. “But, I’ve been without a family for most of my life, I’ve been taking care of myself, so this whole mate thing sounds pretty cool, although a little rushed. But there is no pressure, you could always just deny all suitors and wait till you're ready. Honestly it wouldn't surprise me if we see a few older Veela’s during the ceremony”
Outside the alcove there were 4 very supportive friends, 2 girls squealing their brains out and the other 2 watching the scene go on inside the alcove. Squeals of Finally and about time had been heard muttered throughout the great hall as Draco and Harry sat beside each other the next day for breakfast. Even professor Snape looked "soft" as he watched Harry and Draco exchange a kiss before his class, not that anyone would say it in fear of their house being rid of 100000 points. And Draco and Harry were as happy as ever, when they were together they were always smiling, and it wasn't a surprise when Draco proposed to Harry in the end of their seventh year after 2 years and ½ of dating, or when they had the biggest wedding of the century 3 months after school ended, or how 8 months later, Harry gave birth to their 1st child, and then two years later when he gave birth to a pair of twins, a boy and a girl. And Draco and Harry were so happy together even though some people started to hate Harry because of this and Harry would sometimes have bouts of depression, Draco was always there to get him out and back on his feet.
Harry looked down at his clothes and frowned. "Yeah, why? It's all I have at the moment Pansy and I forgot to order winter clothes when we ordered clothes. And the only other one I have is a sweater Mrs. Weasley gave me. But I don't really feel comfortable wearing that"
“I hope you all have decided who you want to hunt for. Just approach one of the council members present, tell them the submissives or submissive you would like to hunt for. So that we can set up the order.” The council member said. “Oh, you may change your mind, just inform us, and if you wish to participate last minute you must inform a counselor at least 30 minutes prior to the submissive’s hunt. The hunt is tomorrow, choose wisely, we mate for life. A Veela will always be their happiest with their 1st mate.”
“It’s alright dear, normal behavior. Should have known you’d still be protective.” She smiled at the young dominant before turning on her heel, motioning for the others to follow her to the dining tent.
Theo was fluffing up his hair, and then flattening it. Draco honestly didn’t know what he was trying to do with it but he admitted it did look rather attractive and could see why he wanted it like that. Blaise was trying to do something with his hair. What he was trying to do Draco didn’t know because Blaise had gotten a buzzcut early in the summer, so his hair was still rather short.
So I haven't started writing the chase yet... bare with me... I'm still trying to figure out how exactly to write it. Anyway :) Thnx for all the support :)
“So, Harry then, you are going to chase after him aren’t you” Blaise had a smirk on his face, while Draco started to choke on his food.
Eventually Draco came down from his "high" and sighed "Harry what's wrong?" Harry ducked his head, Draco not wanting Harry to hide anymore placed his finger under the smaller boys chin and tilted it upwards. "None of that Harry, look, I'm sorry. I'm so so sorry for the way I treated you, Ron, Hermione and everyone else that I have hurt while I was being childish. Look, I understand if you don't forgive me, i just wanted you to know that I am really sorry, I honestly was just really jealous and i didn't know how to deal with it since growing up i was an onl-"
“Well let’s put it this way. He felt all the pain he ever inflicted on Harry, emotional, physical, and otherwise. That combined with constantly being pranked by his brothers, and 3 months' worth of detention must have scared him off” Blaise said with a sinister edge in his deep voice.
Harry heard several loud thuds indicating that his uncle had awoken. Dust particles falling onto his head as he tried to get comfortable in the cramped toddler's bed. He heard his uncle screaming at him to get up, and start making breakfast.
"Ahh, I see. Let's go then." Draco stood up putting his book down on the coffee table before pulling Harry up and dragging him to the closet to get changed.
Harry loved his garden, it was his favourite place in the house. The one place he had control of. He loved tending to it. Watering the plants, occasionally sipping on the water itself to satisfy his thirst, pruning and cutting occasionally. Harry was always at peace in his garden. But even in his favourite place where everything could be perfect he was lost in thought. He couldn't stop picturing a strong person taking care of him.
Lupin's smile widened as he grasped Harry's hand, and he suddenly looked much younger. “Please Harry, call me Remus. Molly has made us some tea if you would join me inside. I believe we have a few things we need to discuss.” The man was thankfully able to keep the final sentence from sounding too ominous. Although, Harry was still a bit uneasy as he and the others followed Remus back to the house.
Harry was very relieved to hear Remus say those things, but part of him thought maybe it would have been better if Remus hadn't known Harry existed either. Then he wouldn't have had so many years to build up an idea of who Harry should be, and he wouldn't be disappointed if Harry couldn't live up to it.
It felt as if someone had fixed his rib and his spleen, although there was still some pain left and he did still feel a bit woozy. It must have been Madame Pomfrey. Harry had met her the last time he was here, but a student intern had been the one to treat him then.
Harry jumped as he heard the sudden scraping sound of Aunt Petunia pushing his food tray under the door. He cringed as he limped over to retrieve the tray. Uncle Vernon had been a bit overly enthusiastic with his beating the night before. Harry supposed it was due to the fact that not only was he extremely angry about his botched business dinner, but also, it was the first time Uncle Vernon had hit him since the previous summer. The man hadn't dared lay a finger on Harry since he'd gotten back, but now that he knew Harry wasn't allowed to use magic outside of school, it was open season.
“Thank you, Poppy. Come Severus, let’s give her some space to work.” Dumbledore said leading Severus by the elbow into the hall way. “I am gratified to hear that you are so concerned with this. I have a task and I feel that you are the only one I can entrust it to, based on your past.”
Draco found though, that movies had to be experienced first-hand in order to truly appreciate them, as when he tried to explain the premise to Tom, the diary hadn’t been able to enjoy it the way Draco had.
Eventually, when it became obvious Harry wasn’t going to say anything, Remus began to elaborate. “I know that you’ve not been in the wizarding world for long Harry, but I’m sure that you must have heard at least some of the prejudice against werewolves, and I would understand completely if you would rather not be around me.” The man said all of this while staring intently at his shoes.
At present Draco had stored the box in his Hogwarts trunk so that he wouldn't have to see it very often, and was trying his best to forget about it.
When Potter had woke it had taken all of his restraint to keep from breaking down on the boy in apology. He felt so ashamed. It was obvious now that the boy had been none of the things Severus had been assuming he was all year. Severus knew that if he had tried even for a second to see the child as his own person rather than as a clone of his father or a painful reminder of his mother that it would have been apparent. Severus had been bullying a child all year based solely on his own misgivings.
“I told you not to move Potter.” Snape glared at an apologetic Mrs. Weasley as he took the glasses out of Harry's hands and placed them gently on Harry's face.
“Voldemort is gone. For now. That does not mean, however, that he won't be back one day, and it does not mean that his followers won't still try to kill you.” Harry stared intently at his hands and nodded his understanding.
At the end of the day it had been sad to see Hermione go, but at least school would be starting soon. She had been extremely understanding and sympathetic about Harry's abuse and had thankfully not asked too many questions. She had however made it clear she was willing to listen if Harry ever needed to talk.
“Of course I don't have a House Elf Ron! I live with muggles! Until last night I'd never even heard of House Elves!” He exclaimed and then proceeded to summarize exactly what had happened the night before.
Still, Harry was in Gryffindor for a reason, so he took a deep breath and offered the man a skittish smile and a handshake. “Hello, Mr. Lupin. It's very nice to meet you.”
“But Sir, I thought Voldemort was gone?” Harry was afraid he already knew what the answer to his question was, and he was right.
Severus knew Albus Dumbledore well enough that he didn't suspect the older wizard of having known, but he was completely baffled by the fact that the muggles had been abusing The Boy Who Lived right under everyone's nose for years and no one had reported it.
The boy had the entire world trying desperately to get even a glance at his life and no one had seen anything? In all of the people who had managed to track him down through his childhood, not one person had noticed how his relatives were treating him? In all of the people Dumbledore had stationed around his house, not one had thought anything untoward was happening?
Inwardly, he sighed; outwardly he simply nodded and said, “Of course Mother,” as earnestly as he could manage.
Also, this time he would make sure someone was actually watching. Not just some old squib a street over either. This time he would station a trusted teacher right next door. The one teacher who could best empathise with young Mr. Potter. He would send Severus. Maybe this would finally show Severus that Harry wasn't his father.
While Harry was waiting for her to return, Ron quietly entered the room. He looked more cautious than Harry had ever seen him. He almost seemed timid.
Dumbledore lifted the wards on Hogwarts and Apparated him sidelong back to the burrow. Apparation was no more pleasant than portkey transportation unfortunately, though this time he was thankfully able to keep from vomiting again.
There was a sizeable book shop in the centre of the town where he had found books on pretty much everything you could imagine. It was surprising just how many things muggles managed to do without magic. Electricity, computers, the cinema, television, telephones, cars, aeroplanes, electric guitars... the list went on and on of things Draco couldn't fathom having been invented without the use of magic.
Draco was immensely glad he had taken the risk and investigated the diary himself instead of waiting and giving it to his godfather. He hated to imagine what Uncle Severus would think of him if he had shown up for second year terrified of a harmless book. Also, he was beginning to consider Riddle a confidant and that was something he would definitely need this year with all of the personal changes he was planning to make. He was grateful he hadn't accidentally given that up before he had realized he even had it.
When he had first been sent to the Weasleys to check on an abused Harry Potter, Severus honestly hadn't expected to find any real cause for alarm. He had thought he would get there and maybe Potter would be in a fuss about his family disciplining him when he felt he had done nothing wrong. Or that possibly his aunt or uncle had accidentally hurt him and the brat was whining for attention. What Severus had found had astonished and sickened him.
“Ah, I'm afraid that's another thing that is my fault. I asked him to stay away because I wanted you to grow up completely in the muggle world. Away from the distraction of your fame. Once you came to school, he wanted to come and visit you, but I knew you were not very happy with the Dursleys and I was concerned you wouldn't understand why you could not just simply live with him. Please understand that I had assumed the source of your unhappiness stemmed only from feelings of not fitting in or being too different from the Dursleys and thus misunderstood. I never imagined that they were harming you. I had hoped to spare you from the knowledge that Voldemort was after
Draco stepped a bit closer and his stomach gave an unsettling lurch while his pulse quickened in fear. “This is sodding ridiculous!” He exclaimed to himself as he stormed over to where The Box sat on his night stand and ripped the lid off in frustration.
Whoever this Riddle guy was, he was smart. Imprinting a piece of his own consciousness in the diary would definitely keep the wrong people from learning his secrets. This way he could choose whether or not to let someone read what he was thinking.
He had spent the previous week checking the diary for every enchantment he could think of and every curse mentioned in the manor library and he had found nothing. Absolutely
When Lucius had confronted him about his performance Draco had made the mistake of pointing out that blood had absolutely nothing to do with how well you did in school and that had been the last straw for Lucius. That night was the first time that his father had ever beat Draco with his cane.
“They hurt me because I have magic. Because I’m different from them. Because they are scared of what they don’t understand.” Understanding seeped across Remus’s face. “I don’t care if you’re a werewolf Remus. As long as you’re a nice person, you could be a cross-dressing alien from Mars and I wouldn’t care.”
As soon as breakfast was finished the next morning everyone ran (or in Percy's case, was dragged) out to the orchard by the Weasley's house to play. Harry and Ginny were seekers Fred and George doubled as beaters and keepers while Ron and Percy were chasers.
Finally, two days after they had gone to Diagon Alley, it had been a full week since Harry had woken up in the Hospital Wing. Madame Pomfrey visited the Burrow and gave Harry a check-up and reluctantly cleared him to fly. Mrs. Weasley still made them wait a day to have the actual Quidditch scrimmage they had been planning. The twins had even blackmailed Percy into playing so that there would be an even number of players, though there was no telling what kind of dirt they had on him.
Albus Dumbledore was not a man who was often wrong. Every decision he made was plotted and analysed for weeks, months, sometimes even years in advance. He planned things so carefully that he could rarely afford much of a margin of error. As an unfortunate result, any time that he was ever wrong, the fallout was wrought with near critical damage. This time though, Albus felt the damage was much worse than usual.
He hoped that hadn’t gone as badly as he thought it had. Draco had written to Riddle at great length about changing his image and Riddle had assured him it was better to change drastically all at once rather than to try and do it subtly over time and risk coming off as insincere. That way once people realized this was how you were going to be from now on, they would only have to adjust themselves to the new you once.
"It's fine Sir. Professor Dumbledore said that you had asked for me loads of times and that he's the one that decided I would be better off with the Dursleys. If that’s true, then it really wasn't your fault. I mean, who expects Professor Dumbledore to be wrong?" Harry flushed as he realized what all he had said. What if Professor Dumbledore had only said that stuff to be nice, and Remus didn't actually want him?
Draco decided it couldn't hurt much to continue writing to him. If only to finish the conversation. Maybe he could convince Riddle to teach him the spell he had used to imprint his consciousness into his diary.
Harry sat alone on the Weasley's couch and waited for Ron's parents to return to the room. Mrs. Weasley had told him to lie down while she and her husband went to fire call Hogwarts, but his bruises were making that a harder task than it should have been.
Mr. Weasley sent his wife a worried look and cleared his throat. “Harry, we need you to tell us what really happened.” He said in a stern voice.
Always, whenever he had thought of how Harry may feel lonely or different, Albus had told himself that he was doing more help than harm in the long run. That the bloodwards were more important than Harry's comfort.
Draco knew there was no way any of his pure-blood friends could do half the things the Gryffindor Trio had done that year. He knew he probably couldn't have done them either. (He was still a bit miffed about the House Cup though, Dumbledore could have gone about that a nicer way.)
Eventually Mrs. Weasley ordered Fred, George, and Ron to go and de-gnome the garden and for Harry to stay behind. Percy had long since left the table to go write to someone; the twins had taken great fun in teasing him about it.
Suddenly there was a knock at the door and Draco almost dropped the book in his haste to return it back to its box. His father would be furious if he found out that had opened the box before he was supposed to.
While Harry was talking to Ron, the twins removed the bars from his window, climbed in and broke out his door to retrieve his school things that the muggles had locked in the cupboard under the stairs. They were almost away when Hedwig caused a ruckus because Harry had almost forgotten her. The noise woke Uncle Vernon who, when Harry had went back for Hedwig, had almost ripped off Harry's ankle trying to stop him from escaping. The Weasleys managed to pull Harry out of Vernon's grasp, though quite painfully as the easiest place for them to grab him was around his torso which was covered in bruises.Though, Harry was luckily able to pass off his grimace of pain as if it were caused by his ankle getting twisted.
It made no sense. Why would his father give him a normal blank diary? The only thing left to do to test it was to write in it. He had held off from that as long as he could because he didn't want to activate whatever enchantment or curse his father had put on the book, but after a week of getting nowhere his curiosity had magnified and Draco was seriously considering risking it.
“Knockturn Alley is not a good place to get lost.” Draco tutted ignoring the questioning look Potter was giving him. “Especially if you're Harry Potter. Okay. When Father and I leave, try to follow us as quickly as possible. Don't let anyone stop you, hide your scar and stay out of sight and you should be fine. Sorry, I would just walk you out, but Father is with me and he... well he just wouldn't like it...”
The trip to Diagon Alley had gone much differently than Harry had expected. Getting lost in the Floo Network had been weird enough, but the encounter with the suddenly changed Draco Malfoy had really been strange.
The left side of Harry's face was swollen and discoloured, mostly dark purple with shades of yellow, blue, and red mixed in around the edges. He had a deep cut on his cheek that had thankfully since stopped bleeding. His glasses were unbroken so he had most likely not had them on during the attack. His chest was bare and there were more bruises and cuts littered across his torso. The worst bruising (some of which strongly resembled shoeprints) was around the child's ribs. A few ribs were obviously broken, and based on the area of discolouration on his abdomen (not to mention all of the blood Potter had expelled) it was likely his spleen was ruptured.
There was an awkward silence for a moment while Harry sat shocked. He was surprised, Harry had never met a werewolf before, but he was also a bit confused. Harry wasn’t quite sure what he was supposed to say, or why Remus thought that his being a werewolf would make any difference to Harry at all.
Dumbledore is the most difficult character ever for me to write. That being said, I still have no excuse for taking so long to post this chapter. I blame my finicky nitpicking tendencies... Anyway, here you go.
The first thing Harry registered when he came to were dark eyes, black stringy hair, and a hooked nose about two inches from his face.
Suddenly it felt as if his body were being pulled inside out through his bellybutton. The pain, which Harry had been almost completely numb to while Snape was examining him, raced back in full force as the world shifted around him.
“I... Yeah. It was Uncle Vernon.” Harry admitted trying to swallow back the worsening nausea. Where was Mrs. Weasley with his water?
He wasn't sure whether his mother knew the true extent of the beating, and he wasn't about to ask, but judging by the way she looked at him Draco was sure it wouldn't matter. She would back her husband on anything.
In the end, after seeing how wrong his father had been about wizards, Draco decided to scrap all previous notions about muggles and see them for himself. So, three days after the summer holiday had started, Draco had sneaked off into the closest muggle town to do just that.
“Oh, here you are Harry dear. They fell off earlier when you fainted.” Mrs. Weasley said rushing forward and handing them to him.
“Oh really? I couldn't tell by the way Lockhart had to bodily pull him into the picture. Looked like he nearly ripped your arm off Potter. If I were you I’d sic your little girlfriend here on him. Looks like she could do some damage.” The girl turned bright red and backed away. Draco felt a bit mean for embarrassing the girl, but he didn't like people who were rude for no reason.
“So, Harry, how many sugars do you really take in your tea? I thought one was a bit mature for your age.” Remus teased gently.
At this Dumbledore's eyes finally regained some of their twinkle. “I was under the impression you were staying with the Weasley's for the remainder of the summer?”
No, Severus knew exactly why he hadn't seen the signs of abuse. He had been far too preoccupied with shutting his eyes and pretending the boy was someone else, in order to spare his own feelings, to notice anything troublesome. What was confusing to Severus, was that no one else had seen the signs either.
Many of the pure-bloods he had been raised with were mediocre when it came to coursework, and some like Crabbe and Goyle were down right hopeless. Whereas some half-blood and muggle-borns, especially Hermione Granger, excelled above and beyond. In fact, even Harry Potter's mother had been a muggle-born, making Potter a half-blood, and he had defeated the darkest, most powerful wizard
“Oh, Merlin. Mum! Mum!!” Ron called frantically as he watched Harry spew. At first Harry wasn't sure why Ron sounded so upset, until he saw it. He wasn't just spewing his breakfast. Harry was vomiting blood. A great deal of it too.
“Professor Dumbledore has of course informed me of your treatment at the Dursleys, and I will not ask you to speak to me about it until you are ready. He has assured me that he will be punishing them discretely and has convinced me to let you return under Professor Snape's watchful eye, but I wanted you to know that I fully intend to make them pay legally for what they've done to you the instant you turn seventeen and we no longer have need of them. They will not get away with this. I feel I should have pushed Dumbledore harder to let me see you, but it is far too late now. I am so sorry Harry.”
Draco was lucky that he had had the foresight to put an enlarging charm and a feather light charm on the inside of a rucksack (a purchase he had made the week before in the muggle town, along with some casual muggle clothing) before he came, or he would have been hard pressed to carry all of his books home. As it was he only had to carry them to an alley beside the book store and then he stuffed them all in his bag. He would have to pack all of his muggle things in the bag when he got home so that he could just throw the bag in his trunk with his school stuff.
Harry flinched as he lifted his hand to awkwardly rub the back of his neck. He'd forgotten momentarily that he was still injured. Ron noticed, “Blimey Harry! What the hell happened to you?!” He exclaimed leaning in to better examine Harry's facial features in the moon light. “I didn't see it before because it's so dark, but you look like you fell off your broom!” Both twins looked at Harry in concern.
After moment of just standing there staring at the proof that he had completely failed Lily's son, Severus had leapt into action. He had forced a blood replenishing potion down Harry's throat and placed a stasis charm on the spleen. He hadn't been skilled enough to fix it, but at least the charm would keep it from getting any worse while they waited for Poppy.
However, the fact remained that the bloodwards were necessary. He couldn't have Harry removed from the home completely or he would be in danger. He could, however, make sure the boy spent as little time there as possible.
Snape sighed in resignation when Harry didn't answer him. “I'll have to start you on a few nutritional potions and have Poppy assign you a meal plan. There is a small chance that it's still reversible.”
Suddenly it occurred to Harry what exactly he was doing. He was lying to adults. The Dursleys hated that. Why would the Weasleys be any different? He was horrified that he had obviously broken a rule and he wasn't even sure what the punishment would be here.
Before Harry could dwell too long on his perceived shortcomings, Remus spoke again. “There is one thing that I feel you should know about me before you agree to see me.” Remus shifted and cleared his throat uncomfortably. The man very obviously didn’t want to voice whatever it was he was about to say. Harry was just about to try to give him an out when Remus breathed out a deep huff and said bluntly, “Harry, I’m a werewolf.”
Draco sighed in frustration as he eyed The Box. His father had told him not to open it until school started, and because it gave him such a foreboding feeling, Draco had seriously considered not opening it at all, and instead giving it to Uncle Severus once he got back to Hogwarts but, the suspense was driving him crazy.
The truth was he simply didn't want to acknowledge just how much like Lily the boy truly was. Most people swore Mr. Potter was a carbon copy of his father, and Severus would be the first to agree but, honestly, he was a much more even mixture of the two.
It was about that time that she noticed Harry was hurt, and she proceeded to make a huge fuss over him. She quickly stopped though, when she saw just how uncomfortable it was making Harry, and rushed everyone inside for breakfast.
Before Harry could get himself too worked up with doubt, Remus noticed and reassured him. "I do want you Harry. Very much. I write Professor Dumbledore every month and ask about you, and every year on your birthday and on Christmas I ask him to reconsider letting me see you. His reasons are always very sound, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to be in your life. Finally, this year when I wrote him in June, he said he would set up a meeting later this year, but then this happened. I am very glad to finally get to meet you, though I would give anything for it to be under better circumstances."
But, no. There was no excuse. Never mind what type of situation Harry was in at home, Severus had had no excuse to treat a child that way. Lily would have been repulsed by his behaviour.
He didn't have much time to dwell on that though, as Mr. Weasley stepped forward and said, “Alright Severus. You take Harry on to Hogwarts through the floo. Molly and I will gather the children and come check on him in a bit.”
“Why didn't you tell me that mate? If I'd known they were like that Mum and Dad would have taken you in! There's no way we would have sent you back to them if we had known they were hurting you!” Ron stressed flopping down next to Harry on the couch.
Harry was twice as sad for Remus now, knowing that even though there was a potion that made Remus practically harmless, the man had still expected to be turned away. “Remus, do you know why the Dursleys hurt me?”
“Yes. She was out of the country, so I'm afraid she'll have to wait to be issued an emergency portkey.” Dumbledore sighed.
The first thing that Severus had noticed upon arriving at the Weasley residence, was that Molly Weasley was shouting for her husband. He had followed Arthur to the sitting room and was alarmed at the amount of bloody bile upon the floor that had apparently come from the Potter boy. Potter was unconscious on the floor and Molly and her youngest son were in the process of lifting the boy onto the couch.
Before he had left the Manor, Draco had had a House Elf go to Gringots and exchange some of his allowance for muggle money on the off chance that he found anything interesting enough to buy. It was a good thing he had had that foresight because, much to his surprise, Draco had found almost everything in the muggle world interesting.
He must have made a sound because the next thing he knew the submissive was staring right at him, as if his eyes were looking into his soul. And they just stared at each other.
Harry was nudged out of his thoughts when Pansy slightly dug her elbow into Harry’s side. He was disoriented for a moment before he realized that the food had arrived.
Harry in response cuddled closer breathing in Draco’s scent once more, before he tipped his head up to capture Draco’s lips in another kiss.
After a lot of convincing from Ron and Hermione, Harry decided that he wouldn't run away from Draco anymore, he just wouldn't fight with him. So there Harry was, walking across the hall passing by Draco. He couldn't help but duck his head and tuck his chin to his chest and try to move as quickly as he could, but just before he could turn the corner —
"MERLIN, yes, if not I would have waited for our normal time!" Pansy stared at her, she had never seen Hermione act so... excited, shippy, she couldn't really describe it, but she was really excited. Hermione then looked shocked at herself for a second before she looked back at Pansy and grinned sheepishly "Sorry about that Pans, I'm just really excited!" She grinned
Harry woke up in the middle of the night. It was his second time sleeping with Draco. However, last time his feelings were clouded by the need for a mate. This time however it was his first time sleeping with Draco without the inducers. It was weird and awkward. He could feel Draco's heat on the other side of the bed. Draco's scent inviting him closer to Draco. But instead of wiggling closer Harry just turned to observe Draco.
“Ready for what love?” It was the night before when Draco would claim Harry so he was making sure everything was in order.
Draco held his breath. Harry was staring at him, direct eye contact. Draco complied and stared back at Harry as he judged him. Harry made eye contact with him one more time before he nodded his head slightly and moved on.
Okay... so I know that the creature that Draco and Harry are, are Veela. But like I edited "Veela" so it's not like the traditional Veela. Just keep that in mind... if you don't want to read that, then don't read it.
Pansy knew bits of Harry’s childhood from what he confided with her or accidentally slipped, it was an understatement to say that she was disgusted with the way he was treated. How could you treat a child that way… So it did make sense as to why he would favour the chance to start a family.
Harry on the other hand was pretty hungry so he was able to eat more than he usually was able to consume. He was comfortable around the Slytherins, they had welcomed him into their house when his own house had abandoned him. Practically all his friends were now in Slytherin. He didn't know how he could have ever thought that all Slytherins were "evil". They were just misunderstood.
Panicking Harry wished that he could perform underage magic so that he could cover up his new appearance. Calming down slightly he folded his wings into his back he looked at his reflection in the mirror once more remembering what he looked like the night before. Then like magic the Harry he saw in his head was the Harry in the mirror. Surprised and breathing properly again Harry rushed over to the window to let the owl in. The owls dropped its load then flew out of the window but not before nibbling on a few Hedwig's treats.
Madam Pomfrey took note of how much Harry ate before she left to get Harry’s potion. She handed Harry two bottles, she left after making sure he had drank every last drop. Then she checked Harry’s vitals one last time before she allowed the pair to return to their dorms
Harry tried studying for Potions with Hermione, Pansy, Blaise, and Draco, but he just couldn't keep up, sure he was smart but he still couldn't keep up because the Slytherins and Hermione were already studying months ahead of where Harry was, when Harry finally got really worked up that he couldn't understand anything he banged his head onto the table and just sighed. Suddenly when all the concentration left his brain and he just started to relax he noticed that he could feel someone looking at him, well more like staring at him.
Everyday he spent at the dursleys the more depressed and suicidal he got. The more his self-esteem slipped through his fingers as he was pushed aside and ignored not only during the summer but during most of his time at Hogwarts as well, and it didn't help that most of the time that he got attention he was either being insulted or called attention seeking brat. But what would you expect from a person who has never been shown any attention or affection throughout his life.
"GET MY COFFEE BOY!" His uncle yelled at him from his seat at the table. Glaring at him with such loathing and disgust, with such promise of punishment had he disobeyed that Harry cowered and practically ran without running (NO RUNNING INSIDE THE HOUSE BOY!) to make his uncle's coffee.
When breathing finally became a necessity Harry pulled back from their kiss panting softly. Draco gave his lips one last peck before he pulled back as well.
The dominant tensed. Draco could tell the dominant wanted to pounce. The councillors got to him first. Harry moved on, as if nothing just happened. It was probably the inducers making him oblivious to the near tackle. Fortunately Draco was there to pounce on the dominant if the guards did not get there first, Draco seemed to forget that there were borders protecting Harry from that.
Harry stared at the ceiling of his dorm in Gryffindor Common Room. He had hundreds of thoughts racing through his mind. All of them revolve around the same person... Draco Malfoy.
The pair decided that they would have their mating in 4 days' time, Enough time for Harry to heal, and enough time for them to prepare for the 3 days of solitude that followed.
Harry slowly drifted to sleep again. Draco stayed awake consumed with the boys depicted in the strange muggle book. A type of literature he had would have never explored before he met Harry
Harry took a deep breath. "Well, first of all... I'm Gay" Seeing Hermione smirk and about to interrupt him, he raised his hand signaling for her to let him finish, "... and... urmm... and I think... I think I'm in love," Harry looked directly into Hermione's eyes " or rather falling in love... with errm... , Draco Malfoy"
Harry staggered into his room sore and exhausted. He walked over to the “bed” and collapsed trying to get comfortable on the lumpy mattress. When Harry was just about to drift off he remembered the letters he had received earlier that day. Groaning softly and sitting up he walked to the dresser and got the packages out. Before he closed the door he looked at the mirror and released the pressure from his back from keeping his wings in the whole day though there was still a burst of pain and a bit of blood that clung to his wing since it was stil the 2nd time he had the out.  He then pictured what he looked like in the morning and the glamor dropped and he looked at “new” Harry. He studied his appearance or a few more seconds before he closed the door and sat down on the floor with his back against the door facing the window.
“You don't know how much you have been driving me crazy” Draco said, tightening his hold on Harry. Burying his head in Harry’s scent gland, taking in the intoxicating smell of chocolate and berries. His own scent there, but faint. It would continue to be that way until they bonded. Draco resented Harry rubbing his own scent gland, taking another wiff of Harry’s scent. Pleased to smell Vanilla and a hint of Sandalwood mixed with Harry’s own scent.
They couldn’t even say where they were. Ron was probably just over exaggerating. They were most likely having fun without him, stupid Potter, freal, ugly, brat… Why would they want the freak...
Elder Hanna stepped back, not fazed. This was normal behavior for dominants. “Okay, I’m not going to hurt him. Here is the antidote to the inducer. One sip each.”
Draco watched as the golden light faded to the darkness of night. They hadn’t even eaten dinner, their previous meal was lunch, he didn’t want to leave his mate alone in their rooms while he went to dinner. Anyways he wasn’t that hungry, even if he were he could always call for a house elf. Making up his mind Draco set his book on the coffee table and slowly picked up him mate. Surprised that he was so light. Draco made a mental note to make sure to get Harry to eat more. We’re submissives supposed to be this light? Harry nuzzled his head into Draco’s chest, and Draco cooed while he smiled softly at his submissive.
“That was nothing… I just smelled something good…” Harry said before relaxing back into his seat. Neville saw that Harry was getting uncomfortable so he dropped the subject and started talking to Luna about whackspurts… whatever those were.
“Draco. We all know the only other dominant who could possibly catch Harry besides you is probably me. We are the fastest Dominants here. Even then you would overpower me. You are stronger. Plus we have been training since we were 11 when we found out. If anyone had the best chance of getting Harry, it would be you.” Blaise sad rolling his eyes, this was at least the 5th time he had said the exact same thing.
Draco couldn’t wait to mate with a submissive. For them to bare his children, to bond with them. It was a common misconception that Veelas used sex as a bonding meathod. In all honesty it was more like a bonding of the soul, sex was just encouraged by the bond, if the partners wanted they could consummate. Honestly Draco didn’t really care, as long as he would have a mate.
Harry giggled slightly as Draco set him on his feet. The pair set out to the edge of the camp, Draco was still on high alert, he had already scent marked Harry, but that wouldn’t stop the other dominants from trying to stake a claim. Harry on the other hand was relaxed, his Veela was no longer shouting in his ear to mate.
For the rest of the night Hermione and Pansy devised a plan to get Harry and Draco together, or as their now ship name Drarry.
“No… Dad thinks they migrated to the north for summer, but we were able to find a horn!” Luna said in her Dreamy voice with a smile on her face as she remembered her summer. “How about you Neville? How was your inheritance?”
Harry flew to the center. There was a big tree in the middle, perfect for hiding in. He hid in there. He could sense the other 2 dominants close by. Half of him wanted to show himself, let them know where he was so that they could catch him. The other half thought that was too easy, they needed to find him themselves. So he stayed hidden. They heard the growling of the other 2 dominants nearby.
Draco went into the washroom to freshen up. He took a quick shower and put on a pair of pajamas, before leaving and crawling opposite to Harry. It was still awkward sleeping beside another person. So Draco kept to his side not knowing if his presence would be appreciated by Harry this early in their relationship. Cuddles administered by Harry was okay, but Draco didn’t want to do anything if Harry didn’t start it for now. He wanted things to be perfect for Harry.
He 1st opened the letter from his friends. He opened the letters from Neville and Luna 1st. He smiled excited as Luna talked about her camping trip with her Father where they were tracking down a Crumple horned snorkack for her father's magazine the Quibbler. He met Luna the previous year when she helped him practice for the tournament. Neville talked about how he came into a magical inheritance and that hopefully he would do better this year than the last. Luna sent him a green emerald -that creepily resembled his eyes- on a chain. She said they repealed wrackspurts. Neville sent him a low maintenance succulent.
They sounded wrong. They weren’t scary enough, not strong enough to ward off threats to him. Harry needed to get away before they found him. They were currently fighting by the trunk of the tree clearly fighting over which one would go in and claim him.
Ya... That short. Ik ik ill write more for the next one, I have smthing coming up.. get ready to hate Ron :)  In the meantime i would really appreciate it if you checked out my edits on insta: @oaisis.aep :)
Draco growled again, the dominant didn’t back down. So while the dominant was still out of breath. Draco flipped the dominant over so he was on the floor. He quickly kicked the dominant in the face before moving on, he had wasted enough time on this stupid dominant. The submissive was coming closer to him. The dominants were still far away; this was his chance.
Thank you to all those who have read this fanfiction I really appreciate all the kudos, comments and reads. :D
Dudley ran down the stairs and practically pounced on the chair. Making sure he sat on the spot where all the food was in arms reach. Then Vernon and Petunia came in and sat down. When the family was settled Petunia signaled that they were ready to eat. Harry bowed his head slightly then headed for his corner of the room. Not looking up until he heard the silverware stop clacking and the chair scraping backwards, signaling that Dudley had finished his dinner.
“Everyone is safe right?” Elder Jacob said as Draco downed half the potion before handing it to Harry for him to finish.
Harry and Pansy went to the submissive's commons to pack up Harry’s things while Draco went the opposite directions to pack his things up. They finished packing up his things fairly quickly since Harry didn’t have a lot of things, to begin with.
He had scars to prove it. Carvings all over his body, courtesy of his uncle, saying exactly what he was, an ungrateful freak who deserved nothing. He hid it well. So many glamorous and lies. Though he was sure his friends knew of his abuse. I mean Ron saved him from his room in the summer of 1st year, when there were bars on his window. What kind of person doesn't question why you have bars on your windows! They either saw it and chose to ignore it or didn't think anything of it. It hurt either way, but he got over it, they were only kids after all, and he really didn't give them any reason to suspect otherwise.
These little run-ins with Harry kept happening, and everytime Draco would catch eye of Harry, he would always see how beautiful he was. But not once has Draco ever seen his eyes since last term, and Draco was really getting worried that something was wrong. He would always tell his concerns to Pansy and he knew that Pansy and Hermione were really good friends. He also guessed that they had started "shipping" them, and honestly didn't mind. He wanted to be with Harry as a friend or more.
But if Draco was being honest with himself he had his sights set on a certain Gryffindor half-blood. Regardless of whether or not he was a Veela, he was only going through these mate meetings because they were mandatory… and so that he could prove to his dad that none of the girls were good matches for him. He was just very glad that his parents were supportive of his sexuality, as well as the fact he might not marry someone of creature blood… much more one that is not a pureblood.
Draco looked so peaceful as he slept. There was no sneer that was present when Draco was younger and he and Harry were at each other’s throats. (He hadn’t seen that look in so long, it honestly relieved him) There were no wrinkles on the young Malfoy heir. Even asleep it looked as if every single hair on Draco’s head was styled to make him look as attractive as possible. You wouldn’t even be able to tell that they hadn’t used the bathroom, or taken a shower since this time the previous morning.
“I dunno, I mean I've got my whole life ahead of me. Why do I need to settle down right now? I mean I’m only 15, why do I need to mate?”
But behind the masks he wanted to be cared for, for someone to actually care for him. Who was present for him and always there. Who would stand beside him throughout everything that he would do. Someone to love him, for him and not just his masks. Who could peel those masks off and help him expose the real him. Give him the affection he had been craving since he was dropped off at the Dursleys.
Draco released a relieved sigh. He could do this. Harry considered him worthy. He would prove himself able to protect and catch the precious submissive he was about to claim. Draco was on cloud nine. He had this in the bag, nothing would stop him.
Phew! So that is done. I hope yall enjoyed this chapter. I thank you guys so much for all the support that you have given this work. I really appreciate it.
Harry had been quiet ever since they had gotten back in their rooms, his silence was getting Draco a little worried.
He wondered if his parents would be proud of him if they were alive, of course he knew that his parents would be... but that doesn't mean that he didn't wonder if they would have been upset instead that he goes out risking his neck every year.
“Oh, and Harry I saw you staring at Draco” Pansy smirked when Harry’s head snapped her direction, his face a deep red.
Once he felt the world stop spinning and his legs starting to wake up again he took a step forward only to hear a crunch. Looking down confused he looked at the floor seeing his glasses (the frame broken) just laying there he picked them up confused. He gasped in surprise as his head made the connection  he felt on his face with his hands feeling the bridge of his nose, when he felt nothing there he started to panic slightly rushing for the small mirror inside his wardrobe.
Draco walked into the tent, keeping his composure even though all the sweet smells around him were driving him nuts, though he could keep it under control, the only time he wasn’t able to keep his composer was when he had just gotten his inheritance and at the platform when the mystery submissive came.
“That would be the stimulant Harry, bringing out your submissive instincts, It’s different for every sub.”
After an hour or so Harry was well rested. He couldn’t sense any others nearby so he figured it was safe to finally move out of his hiding spot and continue running. He slowly got out from his hiding spot taking refuge in the shadows the trees were producing and moved slowly towards the cave he saw while he was walking early during the day, only stopping every half an hour or so to make sure that he couldn’t sense anyone else nearby.
change of character. Sighing Harry decided that he would tell Hermione, the worst that could happen was that she and Ron would flip out, right?
10... Suddenly the pain picked up once again, waves of agony and pain slamming into him making him curl up, letting out silent cries of pain. Suddenly like an eruption there was a great wave of power from his stomach stretching him in the opposite direction. The strength of the wave that made that house sway slightly.
When Draco didn’t have his masks on was actually quite decent. Harry wanted to get to know this part of Draco much much more.
Draco watched amused as his best friend sat awkwardly, leaning to the side a bit as a figure curled into his side.
“Aren’t you excited? I mean a day ago you were bouncing off the walls, and now ur just…” She just trailed off not knowing how to describe it. “Erm just... are you sure you're ok?
"I'm sorry! I'M SORRY UNCLE! I PROMISE I WON'T DO IT AGAIN! I'M SORRY I'M SUCH A FREAK! I'LL BE GOOD! I'LL BE GOOD I PROMISE" Harry sobbed curling into himself as his uncle moved on to kicking and punching him. "You better be boy or else" His uncle left the room with a final kick then proceeded to slam the door shut leaving Harry to tend to his injuries in the dark cold room.
Draco woke up suddenly, something was different. He was still groggy so he couldn’t decipher what. But something was definitely different. Assuming it was just another dominant searching for the submissive. Until he smelled it. It was so familiar, so sweet, so pure. It was the submissive.
“Thank god you're okay. We were about to send out the search team to see if everyone was okay.” Elder Hanna said, stepping forward to check Harry for injuries.
Once again he found himself over thinking --that he started shaking-- and just thinking about a certain Slytherin Prince. Why was there so much love in his eyes, did he mean it?. Was he looking at me? Does he like me? God! Why did I look at him for so long! He must think i'm such a -
Harry wondered as he admired his new look. Experimenting with his wings and new look for a few minutes he found out that he could fold his wings into his back although it was uncomfortable for a minute or 2. He was broken from his musing by 2 noises; his uncle getting ready for the day and the tapping of 2 owls on the windowpane.
Draco didn't respond. He was in his head imagining a life with a mate. His mate the one and only Harry Potter.
Harry could feel himself tearing up at the love that was showered upon him by Draco. “Draco I love you so freaking much.”
Food appeared in front of the pair. Harry automatically reached for the raw steak but it was snatched by Draco.
Pansy and Harry were getting ready to go to the tents. The students who were participating had to skip the scent repressors for the week to get their scents out. A lot of the dominants almost lost it, so teachers had to keep an eye out for it.
Okay so, I feel the need to admit that I have had a big problem with this chapter. In order for this story to work properly Draco has to change a bit and I have had the hardest time trying to create a believable change in Draco without making him too out of character. I'm still not sure I've managed it properly, but if I continue to pick at this chapter, soon I'll have nothing left. So without further ado, here it is.
Instead of doing the things Lucius wanted him to this year, Draco was going to use the year to find himself. He had been an extension of his father for so long, that Draco really had no idea what kind of person he actually was. He knew what kind of person he wanted to be though, and that person was vastly different than the Draco Malfoy of first year. To begin with, that person was a lot nicer than Draco had ever dared to be. It was going to be an odd transition, but Draco knew he would feel better for it.
It was hard for Harry to feel too wronged or angry when faced with how obviously upset Dumbledore was over his mistake. He wasn't too happy about it either, but he could see that Dumbledore had at least been trying to protect him in some way, which was a lot more than what many of the other adults in his life had done for him.
Luckily he was saved from having to say anything as Madame Pomfrey chose that moment to arrive. Harry was told that his ribs had indeed been fixed and that his spleen was as good as new. He would likely be sore for the next few days and some of his lesser bruises had been left to heal on their own. He was given a special diet and a list of potions to help with his healing and his nourishment, but was thankfully cleared to go back to the Weasley's house.
Severus pondered as he levitated the damaged youth to the Hospital Wing, how exactly the entire magical world had missed its blessed hero's awful mistreatment at the hands of his muggle relatives.
“I... Erm...You... I thought you said it was your cousin?” Ron stammered, looking as if it were painful to ask. Harry sighed. See, this was why he didn't tell Ron and the twins the truth. He didn't want them to look at him the way Ron was staring at him now. As if he were odd... or broken. Still, Ron deserved an answer.
“Wait, Sir. You said you're going to send someone to protect me when I go back to the Dursleys. Who exactly did you mean by that?”
He had just gotten the lid closed and turned around with what he hoped was a calm face when his mother entered his room. “Draco, tomorrow your father is going to take you with him to the Parkinson's to discuss some business and I expect you to be on your best behaviour.” she said with a stern expression.
“You're right 'Mione, it's much more likely that he's up to something.” Ron had said, narrowing his eyes in the direction which the Malfoys had left in. “We should keep an eye on him this year. It must be pretty bad if he's trying that hard to throw off our suspicions.”
Severus Snape sighed in resignation and sneered in disgust as he vanished and scoured the sick from his shoes. Normally he would've suspected the Potter boy to have done it on purpose but it was beyond obvious this time that he couldn't help it. Only a heartless fool would expect a child this injured to have complete control over himself. And though most Gryffindors would swear otherwise, Severus wasn't quite that callous. Yet.
Trying to think of a reason why Madame Pomfrey would have missed Harry's abuse without making her seem like she was bad at her job or just completely unsympathetic was very difficult. Also, please let me know if you think Snape was too out of character. I mean, obviously he needs to be a bit out of character for this story to work at all, but I hope I haven't made him completely unrealistic.
“Not just yet Harry. You have been sleeping and healing now for just under a week. Though you doubtlessly feel much better, I think you will find you are not entirely well yet.” Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have lost some of their ever present twinkle, and it looked as if it pained him to even lay eyes on Harry. His guilt and sadness were obvious on his face.
Draco was bored to tears. His father was supposed to be taking him school shopping but instead they were in Borgin and Burk's, a store in Knockturn Alley. The whole morning Draco had had to listen to Lucius drone on about Malfoy pride and blood status, so he was immensely grateful when Borgin came out from the back to speak to his father.
“It won’t activate it, since technically, you’re not doing any magic. But you should still only use it in emergencies.” Remus stressed as he stood. “Now, I’m afraid I have to be going. There are some errands I need to finish to prepare for the upcoming school year. I believe Professor Dumbledore has already informed you that I will be Madame Pomfrey's assistant this year in lieu of an apprentice. If I don’t see you before school starts, please come and visit me after classes on September 2
They played endless rounds of exploding snap and wizard’s chess and eventually on one particularly boring day Harry even taught them all the muggle game of hide-and-go-seek. Harry was glad they didn't find it too childish, and he felt something mend inside of him at finally being able to play one of the first games Dudley had ever excluded him from with his friends.
Harry's stomach lurched and his mouth went dry. Something deep inside his chest crumpled a bit. “Send me back Sir?” Harry felt his eyes watering and quickly looked away from his professor.
As they flew Ron relayed the story of Harry’s disastrous previous night to his brothers. Harry stayed mostly quiet, only giving small nods of encouragement or corrections when needed. Eventually he felt himself beginning to drift back to sleep.
Harry tried his best to eat all of the food Mrs. Weasley piled onto his plate, but he just felt too sick from the pain. It was getting worse. He felt terrible, and didn't want to seem rude, especially since the food was so good, but he just wasn't able to force even half of it down. Never mind the fact that all of the Weasley boys all had at least two helpings of everything, or the fact that it had been at least a day and a half since Harry had eaten anything at all.
Everyone was proud of the Gryffindors for dealing with things themselves and Draco couldn't help but want to be thought of that way too. Sure Uncle Severus thought they were idiots, but that was probably just because he hates Gryffindors. He had always encouraged Draco to do things for himself rather than just whining for help. No, he should at least test the book fully before just handing the thing off.
As for the rest of the year, Albus rather thought it was time that he contacted Remus Lupin. The Potters had named Remus as a second godfather in their wills far before it was legal for werewolves to have custody of children. Had there been no need for bloodwards, because Sirius Black was unavailable due to his imprisonment, Harry would have been sent to live with Remus four years after his parent’s deaths, when the laws had finally changed. He may only be Harry's second godfather because of a technicality, but it would have to do. Albus had always thought Remus would be a much more responsible guardian than Sirius Black anyway.
After talking to Riddle, Draco had decided that this year was going to be different than last. He had initially considered trying out for seeker on the Quidditch team, but then he realized that though he liked Quidditch, he really had no interest in being on the team (it would take up too much free time) and the idea was actually just another thing his father had tried to push him into.
Draco took a deep breath and opened the diary to a random page. He inked up his quill and hovered over the page trying to decide what to write. As he was thinking, a small blot of ink dripped from his quill onto the otherwise blank page. Draco didn't even have time for the panic at what he had done to set in before the blot faded out of existence before his eyes.
So. It's been nearly four years since I last updated this. To anyone still waiting for this, I am completely embarrassed and so, so, sorry. Would anyone believe me if I lied and said I was kidnapped all this time and have only just now managed to access a computer? Yeah, I didn't think so. Anyway, here's the next chapter. Please excuse me while I go crawl in a hole and attempt to hide my shame.
Harry took a deep breath and looked at his old trainers and explained as best as he could. “Uncle Vernon was upset because I wrecked his business dinner. I tried to tell him it wasn't my fault; that a House Elf had done it, but he didn't believe me. It's alright. I mean, I've had worse before.
“Oh you poor dear, “Mrs. Weasley cried. “No one should be treated that way. Especially not you! Such a sweet, kind boy!” At this point she hugged Harry even tighter and he could no longer hide his discomfort. Mrs. Weasley was busy crying into his hair, but thankfully Mr. Weasley noticed his painful grimace.
This was it. The time had come for them to interrogate him about his bruises. Harry hoped that his lies would be good enough to satisfy their concerns, but he knew he wasn't half as convincing to adults as he was to children.
Draco couldn't stop himself from rolling his eyes and his near silent retort of, “as if blood has anything to do with school work you prejudice cretin.” Thankfully, Lucius didn't hear him because he was busy telling Borgin about how much blood still mattered to the Malfoys as they headed to the back to continue their business.
Harry flushed and looked away. He knew he was too short and a bit underweight, but he was still embarrassed that Snape had mentioned it out loud. He had made sure to eat as healthily as possible during the school term, but it hadn't been enough to reverse the years of damage inflicted by the Dursleys' abuse.
Harry was pleasantly surprised to find Ginny was actually pretty good at seeking so he didn't have to go too easy on her. (Although, she still couldn't manage to speak to or in front of him.) He was still a lot better than she was though, and Harry had just taken a mad dive to catch the snitch and had barely left any room at all to pull back up when he realized they had a spectator.
Harry put the necklace on and nodded solemnly. “Thank you.” He said earnestly. The only thing of his parents’ that Harry had ever had before was his father’s Invisibility Cloak. “But wait,” something suddenly occurred to Harry. “What about the underage magic trace?”
One thing that Draco was going to miss dearly when he went back to Hogwarts, was the muggle town near his house. Since their trip to Diagon Alley a fortnight ago Lucius had been out of the house on business quite a bit. As such, Draco had had a much easier time sneaking out to visit the town lately.
Draco knew his expressions were slipping and if his father had noticed the one time he had actually gone so far as to role his eyes, he would have had hell to pay for it. He needed to be more careful. He would much rather be at home reading the few muggle books he still had left from his last excursion into town. Or maybe even just writing back and forth with Riddle, who was turning out to be quite an interesting person to talk to, but his parents had insisted on him going. It would draw attention if Draco didn't go. Merlin forbid that!
Harry blinked in surprise. He had completely forgotten that was still there. “Oh... I er, I used to sleep there... Before my Hogwarts letter came. My aunt and uncle freaked when the letter was addressed not only to their house, but to my cupboard as well.” Harry explained uncomfortably.
Harry's stomach turned at the thought of floo travel. Mr. Weasley had explained it to him earlier when Mrs. Weasley had first gone to call Dumbledore and it sounded positively dreadful. Mr. Weasley had even mentioned the possibility of getting lost in the Floo Network and winding up in the wrong place completely. He was relieved to see Snape was shaking his head.
Eventually Mrs. Weasley returned to the sitting room. “We were able to reach Professor Dumbledore dear, and he's working on getting in touch with Madame Pomfrey. How are you feeling?” She said brushing his hair back from his face. Harry was surprised at just how much the motherly gesture affected him, as he had to swallow a lump that formed in his throat.
“No, his body can't handle the stress of floo travel right now. We shall have to use a portkey. Luckily Dumbledore gave me one he made previously that can get past the wards.” Snape said pulling an old bottle cap out of his robes. “Potter, place your finger on this and do not let go. I feel I should warn you this shall not be very pleasant.”
As it was, Draco knew he couldn’t personally apologize to every person that he had wronged (mostly because that would probably be insincere and only manage to assuage his own guilt) but he did make sure to write letters to the before mentioned four that he had been worst to last year. He had written many different drafts of each letter and eventually decided to go with the most heartfelt of each (because let’s face it, if Draco Malfoy was going to apologize, he may as well do it properly.) He had sent them all last night and he was waiting for his owl Sully (Draco was seven when he had gotten him and he had named the bird Sullen after it’s only expression; his parents were a bit miffed, but Draco had stood his ground and they had eventually relented out of sheer annoyance) to return.
Draco had actually sat down and made a list of the people he had been worst to, and he was surprised at how long it had actually gotten. He had expected to have to put down Neville Longbottom and the Gryffindor trio, but once had started writing the list he had been surprised by how many people had actually come to mind. At this point he thought it might actually be better just writing a column in the Daily Prophet titled My Sincerest Apologies to Everyone for Being Such a Spoiled Prat, by: Draco Malfoy. It would certainly take less time.
“A book.” He blinked. Suddenly Draco felt very stupid. He picked up the book and flipped through the pages. He was further surprised to realize it was completely blank.
“Ron! What are you doing here? You can't be here. If the Dursleys find you they'll kill- Wait, is that a flying Ford Angela?” Harry asked in surprise as Fred and George waved at him through the window.
Harry and the others, who had likely noticed the man while Harry was diving, landed and approached the man together. When they reached him the man said, “For a moment I forgot and thought I was watching a young James. Then I remembered even James wasn't
Professor Dumbledore had assured him that his godfather had wanted him for many years and, Harry did believe him, but there was still a small part of him that worried. What if Lupin decided he didn't like Harry and then was upset that he was stuck with Harry? What if the problem wasn't the Dursleys and simply that Harry was undeserving of familial love?
The first week Harry spent at the Burrow passed in a blur. Madame Pomfrey had instructed him to take it easy (and had made sure to tell Mrs. Weasley too) so, he and Ron spent most of their time inside, but there was always something to do.
seemed to be wrong with the book. If his father had been someone else, Draco might think Lucius was telling him that only
“It was just Dudley and his gang.” Harry lied quickly. “Don't worry Ron, I've had far worse before.” He felt bad about lying but, he really didn't want them to know just yet how much of a freak he really was. Getting ruffed up by some other kids was one thing, but he really didn't think he could handle them knowing he was abused.
Harry's heart swelled slightly at the comment the stranger made. He paused for a moment, “I'm sorry sir but, who are you?”
Later in the day it was evident that Potter had found some way out of Knockturn Alley when the press hogging idiot that was Gilderoy Lockhart dragged him up to the front to pose for pictures. Once Potter had finally managed to tear himself away from Lockhart's grimy attention stealing hands, Draco scoffed incredulously and said, “God Potter. You'd think you were Freddie Mercury returned to life the way they fawn over you. What must it be like to be so famous you can't go into a
After a moment Snape leaned back and scowled. “I'm going to have to take him to Hogwarts. I've managed to stop the bleeding, but he still has a lot of wounds, old and new, that I simply cannot heal all at once. Not to mention how malnourished the child is. Did those muggles
It was very off putting to see Dumbledore so guilt stricken. “I guess I understand what you were trying to do Professor. Really, I don't blame you. I know you were only trying to keep me safe, Sir.” suddenly something occurred to Harry. “Professor, are you- I mean, are you sure he will want to keep me? I mean, not everyone wants children... especially someone else's...”
Harry had watched feeling slightly disoriented as Draco Malfoy left Flourish and Blots. He had allowed himself to be ushered out of the shop by Mrs. Weasley and had turned to his two closest friends as soon as they were outside. “So, on a scale of one to ten exactly how sure are we that Malfoy hasn't been replaced with a pod person? Because right now I would probably vote negative seven.”
Harry Potter sat on his bed and stared forlornly out the window. Last night a House Elf, of all things, had come and ruined his life. Now there was a man fitting bars on Harry's window and Uncle Vernon had put a lock and a cat flap for food on his bedroom door. At least now he knew that his friends hadn't forgotten him. Maybe someone would notice when he didn't show up for school.
“Harry dear,” Mrs. Weasley started delicately as if not to startle him off. “I need you to tell us what happened.” Harry looked from Mrs. Weasley to her husband and then back again.
Before Hogwarts the only people Draco had ever been around were his father's business associates and their children. Naturally, that meant that he had only ever known pure-bloods. Draco had always taken Lucius' word for it when he'd said that half-bloods and muggle-borns were inferior to pure-bloods, and that muggles were little more than clothed monkeys. After spending a while at school though, Draco had realized his father's views were not completely accurate.
Harry settled back and stared up at his professor in confusion. He thought he could see Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the background, but someone had removed his glasses so he couldn't be sure.
Whatever was in the box, Draco was sure he wouldn't like it. The box felt heavy in a way that had nothing to do with weight, and it left Draco's stomach feeling unsettled if he stared at or handled it for too long.
They didn't have the proper balls, except for an old practice snitch that came when you whistled to it so that it couldn't fly away and end up in the nearby muggle village, so they used substitutes. They had an old football that Mr. Weasley had been hiding in his shed of muggle things that they used for the quaffle and Fred and George just pelted apples at the others instead of bludgers.
Honestly this was getting a bit ridiculous. “You've got to be lost. You're way too straight laced to be here for any other reason.” Then it occurred to him, “Wait, did you get lost in the Floo Network?” He only asked because it used to happen to him all the time when he was younger. He'd never had a speech impediment, but the idea of willingly stepping into an active fire had always caused him to stutter. It had driven Lucius barmy for a while until Draco had grown out of it.
“Yes, my boy. His name is Remus Lupin, and he was a dear friend of your parents when they were still alive.”
When he arrived Mrs. Weasley ushered him upstairs into Ron's room and commanded him to rest. Later, when Ron came upstairs Harry was happy to learn they would be going to Diagon Alley the following Wednesday.
“So, Potter. Come here often?” Now that he knew that blood status was a sham and was no longer trying to earn his father's approval, there didn't seem to be much of a reason to continue being such an awful prat all the time. That didn't mean he had to lose all of his snark though.
If blood status mattered as much as his father claimed, then why wasn't there more proof? Everything he'd ever been taught was starting to seem more like nasty rumours than actual fact. Needless to say Draco was confused and not a little bit unsettled.
Contrary to popular belief, Draco had been disciplined before. He had been grounded, cuffed over the back of his head, spanked, and even slapped in the mouth by his mother once, but it was nothing compared to this. Draco still had yellowing bruises left all over his body and it had been almost three weeks now. (Of course, not anywhere that anyone could see, as that would bring the family embarrassment.)
There was a softness around his mouth that he had definitely inherited from his mother. A subtle angle to his cheek bones and a fullness to his chin. His handwriting was almost the same exact messy scrawl Lily had had when she had first learned to write with a quill. He had many of her quirks, such as biting his lip when concentrating, or tapping his foot to stay awake when he was tired. The few times he was partnered with the Longbottom boy for Potions it was evident that he had inherited his mother's kindness as well as her sense of justice and loyalty. By far the worst though, were his eyes. Her eyes.
The movie had been a very different experience for Draco. Buffy the Vampire Slayer was an interesting parody of monsters and teenagers, and though the muggles' interpretation of vampires had been almost completely wrong, Draco had still found the movie incredibly entertaining.
His mother stayed in his room for a while longer lecturing him about his behaviour and Malfoy honour, and by the time she left he was so tired, he forgot to study the diary any further that night.
“I guess we should get the important things out of the way and then we can get to know one another.” Remus sighed and cleared his throat.
“Yeah, that used to happen to me all the time. Count yourself lucky. The first time I flooed I retched all over myself. Where were you trying to go? Diagon Alley?”
“Harry, please do not mistake me. The Dursleys will face unyielding consequences for what they have done to you. Unfortunately the situation must be dealt with delicately. I’m afraid that I am unable to charge them
Potter was openly gaping at him in confusion and Draco might have taken a moment to explain and apologise for his past wrongs, but then he heard Lucius' voice coming closer from the back as he ended his discussion with Borgin and he had to quickly close the cabinet door and turn around.
Severus knew how he himself had missed it. Looking at Harry Potter brought back far too many memories of Lily, so, most of the time Severus just imagined James in the boy's place and reacted accordingly.
of Harry's more serious problems when he was in the hospital wing for three days last term. They should have been immediately obvious to such a seasoned healer as she. Instead, the boy was treated for a concussion and exhaustion and then sent on his way.
He gingerly sat back down and looked at the sparse meal the Dursleys had given him. Though it was the only meal he'd been granted that day, Harry sighed and gave the entirety to Hedwig. His ribs hurt so badly it was making him nauseated, and the food probably wouldn't have stayed down anyway. Hedwig gave Harry an affronted look and ruffled her feathers, but eventually she ate it.
Harry lay carefully back down on the hospital bed. “Professor... I... please don't feel bad. I could have told you last year, but I didn't. There's no reason for you to feel bad Sir.”
Harry was alone the next time he woke up. He felt disoriented and his head was slightly sore, as if he had slept too deeply and for a long time. It took him a moment to find his glasses, but once he did, he recognised that he was in the Hogwarts hospital wing.
It had been a fortnight since Draco's father had given him the mysterious box with the mysterious item in it that would supposedly teach Draco how to be a better Malfoy, and though it made his stomach queasy to think about or look at The Box, Draco felt he was going to go sparse imagining what was in it. He had even taken to capitalising the stupid thing in his head. It was getting rather ridiculous.
Ron had looked bemused by Harry's muggle reference, but Hermione had laughed loudly. “I agree he is acting extremely odd, but it's still highly unlikely that he's an alien clone.” Ron (having understood the reference then) had nodded in agreement.
They played for hours, until the twins decided to spice things up by hiding in peculiar places and popping out screaming at anyone that walked by rather than just waiting to be found. Mrs. Weasley ended their game after they jumped out at her thinking that she was Percy and accidentally caused her to spill the fresh laundry.
“I'm fine, thanks.” Harry felt like maybe he should have told her about the increasing pain, but she was already doing so much for him and he really didn't want to be a bother. So, he decided to tough it out until Madame Pomfrey arrived. Harry hoped it wouldn't take too long though, because he was beginning to feel nauseated and flushed as well now.
Today, Draco was buying as many books as he could to try and last him until Christmas break. He had recently discovered an obsession with fiction books. The children and young adult muggle fiction was so much more interesting than wizard fiction. In a lot of muggle books, the main character actually stumbled upon magic (though the magic was never quite accurate) which was very interesting. Even the ones without magic were enthralling, and Draco was determined to buy as many as he could find. By now the shop workers had learned to ignore his eccentricities in taste, so he didn’t have to be sneaky about it either.
Draco wasn’t really expecting much in way of replies from any of them; fearful suspicion from Longbottom, polite suspicion from Granger, blunt suspicion from Potter, and probably a note saying piss off from Weasley. Still, at least he had apologized at all. Riddle had thought it was unnecessary, but Draco knew that, at least for these four people, this was the only way that he could make them understand that he was serious about his new attitude.
Harry flushed again in embarrassment. He really felt like saying 'no', but he didn't want to upset the Weasleys when they were being so nice to him. Plus at least this way Mrs. Weasley would have to stop crying on him. “I... er... I guess that's alright. It really isn't that bad though.” Harry said as he stood and gently removed his shirt.
He had been terrified of a diary for half a month. It was a good thing no one had known about this or he never would have lived it down. “How in the world could a blank diary teach me what it means to be a Malfoy?” Draco muttered to himself in confusion.
He knew he should probably just wait and give it to his godfather when he got back to school, but he couldn't help but feel stupid for being so scared of the thing. How much damage could a book do anyway? And wouldn't Uncle Severus be more proud if Draco brought him the book already knowing what was wrong with it rather than if he just expected a grown up to deal with it?
The entire school year Draco had done his best to pretend that he still held the same beliefs as his parents and his pure-blood friends. Once the end of the school year came however, and Harry Potter had once again faced and defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-So-Great-If-A-Child-Has-Vanquished-Him-Twice-Now, Draco could no longer live in denial. His father was wrong.
“Molly, I think you should let go for just a moment. Harry can you show us everywhere you're injured? I'm sorry to be invasive, but we need to see them to know whether or not you need a healer.”
“In light of recent events though, I’ve added something to them. They are now portkeys. Your father’s band will take you to Dumbledore’s office, the necklace will take you to myself, and in case the moon is full or I am indisposed for some other reason, your mother’s band will take you to Professor Snape. To activate them you just tap one with your wand and say the password. Your father’s ring is Prongs, the necklace is Moony, and your mother’s ring is Lily.” Remus said, gesturing to the rings to make sure Harry knew which was which. He continued, “It is imperative that you keep these with you at all times Harry, and only use these when you absolutely need them. Also, don’t tell too many people about them or Professor Dumbledore and I could get into trouble. We weren’t exactly authorized to make these, but we both agreed that we didn’t ever want you to be stuck in a dangerous situation like earlier this summer again.”
Even with as many things as Draco got that day, he still went back three more times that week for more information. He found tabloids (with motionless pictures!) that told him about muggle pop culture, which honestly he found just as confusing as wizard pop culture with the way things were always changing. He discovered a very strong liking for muggle music, and an interest in muggle science, especially chemistry which he found very similar to potion making. Not everything he found was to his liking, and a lot of the sports seemed a bit boring and brutish when compared to Quidditch, but it was obvious that none of it had been created by clothed monkeys. His father was wrong again.
