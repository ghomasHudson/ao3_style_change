There was a lot of noise as everyone scuttled to their assigned guest rooms, and only Mother and Harry remained. Draco had only just realized he had Harry’s wand still sitting in his lap. He didn’t dare move, in case Harry noticed and asked for it back. For whatever reason, it gave him immense comfort to hold it.
Draco honestly considered it. He was rather tired, actually, as being on edge since early in the afternoon was exhausting. Just when he opened his mouth to say yes, a sudden sound made his blood freeze in his arteries.
“You were going to – you were going to suggest he
“Ah, yes. Is it okay for me to say it was one of my favorite childhood moments?” Potter laughed, and Draco shook his head, laughing too.
could reach into his mind with much ease, but usually there was no need for that – Draco was already accustomed to the uncompromising degree of honesty that was required of him. There was nothing he didn't share, everything he had and that he was. All of it, always. There was no other way. Draco felt the light touch at his chin, releasing him from the forced state of rest, and gave the flowers a terrified glance.
“It’s good to be officially introduced, Draco,” Macnair said in a voice he did not know, but an intonation he knew only too well. His fingers on Draco’s skin weren’t flames, they were ice, and it was spreading. A frozen, frantic sort of buzz, a poisonous cold, all over his body. From his hip and to his stomach, expanding in his chest, diffusing into his bloodstream, down his arms, all the way to his fingertips, up his neck, down his back, twisting and wafting down to his toes. It wasn’t exactly fear, and it wasn’t exactly hate, and it wasn’t exactly grief, it was… death. This was it. The end. This was
“Draco?”
“Malfoy…” Harry tried, but he shook his head.
“It’s nothing.” Malfoy stopped too, and he still wasn’t looking at him.
a prick, and he was
“What?” Draco was distracted enough to forget about his puzzlement with Potter’s return for a second. “Death Eaters? Again?”
, it was unbearable. Harry thought he could
For a long moment Malfoy just looked at him, marveling at him like he couldn’t quite believe what he just heard. Then he lowered his glance to the sofa, his eyes filled with an emotion Harry didn't recognize. “I don’t think you’d want me around anymore if you knew, Potter. I don’t think you’d even speak to me again.”
There were about a thousand other responses, and what Draco eventually chose to go with was, “Are you sure?”
“Your partner… gave it to you? What does that mean?”
But this was another subject Draco was not going to go into (
“It really isn’t.”
“You heard me. I am done being scared of you. I'm ready to face you now – I, and I alone.” Draco turned to his father. “This is supposed to be my punishment, is it not? Have right at it, then. As if I've not been punished enough by you this year. Do as you wish to me, but you must send her away.”
about
“Look, I’m sorry I’ve been a little distant. I promise it had nothing to do with you.”
“What do you mean, even if in nothing else?” Potter’s voice shook, and Draco started.
“What are you sorry for?” Potter asked softly, and Draco was only this far from sobbing again.
Potter’s expression was still very soft when he continued, and it hurt. “My family – the people who raised me – they didn’t care for me. Not at all. I think my aunt’s always been jealous of my mother, and then her husband was just a… anyway. It was really lonely. I didn’t have any friends, and… well, I had nobody. Really, nobody. No one who cared if I lived or died.”
Harry did the least probable thing and burst into a fit of laughter. “You knucklehead,” he shook his head, impossibly affectionate. “That’s what got you so upset? You funny, funny twit. I don’t know in how many more ways I can say it, Draco, but I’m fairly positive you’re it for me.”
Draco remembered that day only vaguely; the pieces of cloud in his head were sparse around there. The whole of that first year was a bit of a blur. A continuum of learning and making mistakes, of apologizing and making amends, of running between
“Not much.” Draco studied his face; pale, stubbly, red around the eyes. “You look exhausted too. Rough night?”
Potter must have seen it in his eyes, since he didn’t argue. “All right. I’m leaving. I’m going, okay? But I just want you to know that – “
“You miss her.” It wasn’t exactly a question, but Potter nodded as though it was one.
Harry felt like he was holding his breath, and maybe he was, because now it was coming out in a great sigh of relief. His grin was so wide, it hurt his jaw muscles. “Good. I want to do this with you too, Malfoy.” The Slytherin didn't exactly smile, but he looked sort of relieved, and his eyes softened.
“I don’t understand. What’s the problem?”
“You’re incredible, Draco. Really. Amazing.” He kissed his forehead softly, and the light that shone in the grey eyes stole the very oxygen from his lungs.
“I’m sure I gave back as good as I got,” Harry shrugged. “But also… for never giving you the opportunity to show me who you really are.” He was very aware of his hand on Malfoy’s waist, of how close their bodies were. His cheeks, already pinkish from the wind, grew steadily pinker.
“I – “ Harry started, eyebrows knitting on his forehead. “Why do you sound like it’s no surprise to you?”
“Don’t you dare touch him, you son of a bitch – “ and Harry was more of a blur than a person, attacking with such force, everyone in the vicinity momentarily paused. It was only a second, though; by the next, Draco was trying to escape the hands out to grab him on some very shaky legs.
“What?” Potter cried in shock. Perhaps that wasn’t what he meant? “He used
The finger quotes were maddening enough to make Draco completely, completely forget himself. “That's right, Potter, I’m pathetic. I’m a pathetic
“Harry’s a bit of a prat,” he said then in his fondest voice.
“Sure thing. You can be whatever you want, it’s a free country.”
There were noises in the distance, and movement as the light by the staircase flickered; someone was growing closer. Draco was a little proud of himself for seeing them coming this time - up until now he’d only had the presence of mind to notice them as he was already being cursed. He couldn’t tell who it was until the figure was pretty near; his heart squirmed with fright when he recognized it. His aunt. Good fucking gods, he really had it now. He tried to harness the anger he felt so recently into energy. It wasn't much, but honestly, he would take whatever he could right now.
Potter inhales sharply.
Okay, so that wasn’t the best revenge tactic, since only Weasley and Granger had to take a shot. But that was the price Draco had to pay for living with Harry bloody Potter.
“Sure,” Draco croaks.
"You're lying," Harry says, his voice too loud.
“Consider this an intervention,” she hisses.
He follows her to the cash register to make his payment.
Draco doesn’t have an eating disorder.
“Why the new clothes?” Pansy asks. “You look like a Muggle.”
Draco feels like he’s dissolving under Potter’s gaze and not in a good way.
Draco wants this. He has wanted it too long for him to fully understand, and Harry is just
“You’re reading too much into this,” Draco snaps.

(He could have splinched Pansy. He could have killed them.)
Draco is standing, clutching his fork like he’s about to spear it through Blaise’s heart, and everyone is staring at him. Judging. Whispering.
has to make things difficult, doesn’t he?
“You’re always so cold,” Potter says.
“So did I,” Harry says grimly.
“Sorry,” Draco says. “He does that to me, too.”
“I didn’t think you were drunk,” Draco says, his voice hitching. “I just—I don’t know how to talk to people.”
Draco closes his eyes and burrows into the blanket, curling up on the couch. Potter brushes back Draco’s hair, checking his forehead once more.
Potter doesn’t move, and Draco cautiously accepts the phone. He types his number in, then hesitates.
“Having a pity party,” Harry says. “You?”
it," Molly says. "It's all under the surface."
Ron grasps Harry's shoulders, looking him in the eye.
“Have I had the wrong image of you, all these years?” she asks.
“My girlfriend broke up with me,” Harry says.
It occurs to Draco that Pansy, Blaise, and Goyle are going to be incurable smug.
“Hi,” Harry says.
Harry doesn't have enough air to speak. All he can think to do is keep looking, keep searching--
He has to shake Potter’s hand because the world is watching. It will seem so ungrateful if Draco doesn’t.
Harry hands her a few pieces of paper, and Luna reads silently.
He didn’t exactly
“You’re right,” Potter says. “I really was.”
"He wrote poetry," Harry says.
“Because I’m fine, too.”
There were signs. There had to have been signs. Draco couldn't have just decided to do it one day, spur of the moment--that's not how Draco was. He planned and prepared and theorized. He thought of contingencies; he plotted out each choice.
“Yeah, well, I chose to cut you up in the boy’s bathroom,” Potter says wearily.
He didn’t know. He
and Draco--
Draco whirls around, his heart pounding, to find Ginny Weasley staring him down with a dark scowl on her face.
Luna pecks Harry's cheek.
Draco hasn’t eaten in five days. (This is nothing. At Hogwarts, Draco could go weeks without eating.)
Draco can remember the first and only time he tried alcohol. It was a bottle of wine that he and Blaise snuck out of Lucius’s extensive reserves. At the time, Draco liked the floaty, giggly feeling that it gave him.
“Watch where you’re going,” Potter snaps, climbing to his feet.
Just because he slammed the Chosen One to the ground in front of a crowd of wizards. The same Chosen One who got him out of a life sentence in Azkaban.
Harry is bad at social cues, true, but he’s pretty sure
So many things are hard for Draco. He has trouble falling asleep. He can barely drag himself out of bed on the rare occasions when he
Draco would get burned at the stake if he killed Potter, but he finds this more appealing than the thought of having to
“She probably just isn’t
So then, Draco Malfoy is trans. This changes nothing. He is still a former Death Eater. He is still a blood traitor in the eyes of his father, still something vile and disgusting that his father will never understand.
Pansy holds him, but their arms are not strong enough to calm Harry's shaking shoulders.
“Neither ‘m I, then,” he says. “We’ll use the Floo.”
Okay, maybe he is a little drunk. There’s no way he would ask that sober.
Aaron pauses slightly, and Draco feels something like dread rising up his throat.
"It's my fault," says Harry.
“They probably meant to,” he says. “They just . . . kept putting it off.” Harry’s left hand is on the table, and Draco gingerly rests his hand on top, half expecting Harry to yank his away. Instead, Harry turns their hand palm-up, enteining his fingers with Draco’s. Draco inhales shakily. “Feelings are messy. They’re complicated and difficult, and it’s hard enough as it is to love someone and be loved back, let alone tell another person about that love.” Draco nudges Harry’s shoulder gently. “Especially if they’re an ex.”
because--
Harry runs to Draco's grave, his eyes raking the ground under his feet. He can't breathe. He can't breathe. He can't breathe--
Something softens in Potter’s eyes.
“Nice robe,” Potter says. “The red looks good on you. I’m a little surprised it isn’t green, though, you know--you kinda look like a Gryffindor.”
The next article Draco read was far less complimentary, frequently misgendering and deadnaming Percy and prominently displaying a photo of him hexing a reporter who got too close to him and his family. Something uncomfortable twisted inside Draco’s stomach as he read, and he eventually had to just put it aside.
"This, Harry," Luna says solemnly, linking arms with him on the other side, "simply will not do."
“—I need to go,” Draco says dizzily.
"He was getting better," Harry says.
Ron's voice drops about twenty degrees as he says, "Maybe you should consider seeing one."
“Do you think I’m damaged?” Harry asks.
But then there’s Harry fucking Potter, who seems to have developed the delusion that Draco
The Death Eaters have taken over the school, and Voldemort is in his house, and Dumbledore is dead, and Voldemort is in Draco’s house, and he can’t fall asleep at night because he can hear the other students’ screams,
Oh, Merlin. Oh, Salazar. Draco is an idiot. Draco deserves to die. Why does he talk to people? Why does he even
“Special occasion?” Harry asks.
“I--are you--” Potter rubs his face and groans. “I’m so bad at this. I’m sorry. You don’t have to tell me anything.”
“--just trying to pretend like she’s a man--”
He has to have the ring. He can't have lost it; he can't--
Harry considers pointing out that he knows how to Apparate, but he’s touched that Malfoy is evidently so scared of his friends’ wrath. Ron and Hermione will be chuffed when Harry tells them. He climbs into the truck.
“That doesn’t mean you should sell it,” Narcissa says. She’s so upset that she doesn’t ask Draco if he wants more tea.
Pansy bends down, their knees in the dirt, and begins to sweep through the grass next to Draco's grave. It's clear that they have no clue what they're looking for, but they're trying to help, and Harry's throat is too tight to thank them.

“What’re we thinking today?” Aaron asks, flinging the cape around Draco’s shoulders.
any dark magic, other than what the Dark Lord force-fed down his throat). Draco is guilty, and it makes no sense for him to walk free.
Molly hugs him tightly, and Harry stiffens. He doesn't want hugs. He wants answers.
Harry looks at Draco, his eyebrow raised, and then
Draco smirks. “I figured.”
Did Potter hex him? Did Potter curse him?
and I know that I don’t deserve to be touched, so I—“
“I think a lot of people have,” he whispers.
Potter rests his hand on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco freezes.
Not for the first time, the thought crosses Draco’s mind that
“Fuck off,” Potter snarls.
wear dresses, it was always trousers. Nice trousers, obviously. But, um . . .” Harry opens and closes his mouth abruptly, then lets out a huffy laugh. “I don’t know where I was going with this.”
Draco’s brow furrows, and he stares at Harry, who looks utterly miserable.
Ron drops his glass of water, his head jerking up. Harry's stomach twists as the glass shatters on the floor, blood spilling across--
“That’s Ginny’s perfume.”
Hermione wants Harry to visit Draco's grave. She claims that this will help him find closure, that Harry needs to have something ground him.
“You hoe, don’t you get it? Potter’s an orphan—his friends
Hex him, swear at him, shove him to the floor—Draco just wants Potter to end Draco’s misery so Draco can go.
anything about it. Harry is the wind, and all Draco can do is follow his lead.
“We’re taking you out to eat,” Blaise says firmly.
“It helps, you know,” says Potter. “I mean, I never talked about it, either, but my friends helped a lot.”
The bar is loud and clustered with way too many people. Draco knows he is being paranoid, but he feels like people are staring at him and judging. This is ridiculous, and he
to move on.)
Potter smirks, and Draco wants to wipe it off of his smug, disgusting face.
It begins with Harry having to buy a shirt. They’re pretty sure that all disasters have roots in clothing and fashion and have occasionally toyed with the idea of shucking off his clothes and moving to a cottage in the woods where clothing could be a thing of the past. Unfortunately, Harry finds himself rather fond of his friends, which makes a life of solitude somewhat less appealing.
And fuck. In retrospect, Harry really should have seen this coming.
“I eat,” Draco protests. He isn’t lying. He had a handful of chocolate frogs yesterday after class, and he kept all of them down. He’s getting better.
and Draco can feel Tessa’s impatient stare slicing into his skin.
But there’s something about the process of showering and dressing that seems like too much for Draco right now.
“Yes,” Draco says with far more confidence than what he feels.
He needs to rent a flat. He needs to get a job. He needs to find a way to repair all the damage his family inflicted during the war.
“Percy already gave me one. Well, technically, Molly’s the one who knit it, but she had Percy gift it because she thought it would be more poetic or something.”
Harry stands, pressing a package of tissues he keeps on hand (Luna’s idea, everyone he knows ends up crying at the most inopportune times, so they might as well be prepared) into Malfoy’s hand. Surprisingly, Malfoy takes it.
Potter side-apparates Draco to his place and directs Draco to the couch.
Harry claws at the dirt until his hands are covered with dirt and scratches and tiny rocks.
There are bundles of different emotions currently knotted up in Harry’s mind, and trying to sort through them all is almost impossible.
Progress, Harry supposes.
hand off so that the Chosen One can’t burden another poor unfortunate soul with his cursed physical contact.
He’s standing in a Muggle shop, more for warmth than anything. He has been staring at the same bag of crisps for the past five minutes, and the workers are starting to watch him with suspicion.
Pansy yells.
“I’m not crying,” Draco says.
He should have known Pansy would not let it go.

he thinks it’s awful. It just feels
“You don’t live there anymore,” says Draco. “And I don’t want to, either.”
“Why the long face, Potter?” she asks breezily. “It’s not every day the savior of the Wizarding World gets to have pity party waffles with their arch nemesis. You ought to call yourself blessed.”
Draco says forcefully.
“Damn white people,” Harry mutters under his breath.
Hermione inhales sharply.
Malfoy inhales shakily, smoothing out her slacks. Harry’s beginning to wonder if that’s a nervous tic—there are never any wrinkles.
Maybe Draco is hallucinating. That would certainly explain all the Howlers that have been coming his way because no one, not even the likes of Luna Lovegood, would use a Howler to send a sweetly worded encouragement to leave the house.
“Sorry!”
“Haven’t you heard? I must not tell lies.”
“We have to create something new for you, darling,” Pansy explains as she ties a sheet around Draco’s neck. “Everyone knows what you look like, and I do mean
"THEN WHO CAN I?" Harry yells, leaping to his feet. "Whose fault is it, Ron?! Because it sure as

wouldn’t believe himself).
“How short?” Tessa asks.
"Right back atcha," Harry whispers.
“That’s good,” Draco says. Ginny gives him an incredulous look, and Draco feels like screaming. He doesn’t know what he’s doing
One more night, and Harry will finally be able to move on with his life without Draco floating behind him (always, permanently behind).
(They’ll send him back to Azkaban; they’ll send him back to Azkaban;
"Do you think he would have said yes?" Harry asks.
Draco hadn’t thought much of it, not even when Pansy started going by they/them pronouns exclusively. Because, well, that was
Luna raises limpid eyes. Without saying a word, her eyes ask,
“That’s not . . . Draco—“
Draco should feel surprised, he supposes, but the persistent thread of anxiety isn’t allowing him to react beyond basic social courtesies. Was he supposed to know? It was probably in the papers. Considering this is Harry Potter they’re talking about, it was

Pansy’s voice flits unbidden across Draco’s mind:
just a ring, and Harry just lost the one thing that was still holding Draco to earth, and now Draco is lost forever.)
Draco starts to run out of meals.

“Are you okay?” Potter asks again.
“Sure,” Draco says after a moment of hesitation. “What’s up?”
The waiter comes by, and Draco feels himself begin to disconnect as Potter and the waiter chat about the weather, Quidditch, and literally everything except food.
Pansy sat up and grasped Draco’s hands.
Draco grabs the sides of Harry's face and pulls him close. Draco kisses him more fiercely than before, and Harry presses against him.
Potter offers Draco a crooked grin, and Draco feels his heart constrict.
Draco hisses. “I showed you that letter in strict confidence, and it’s
to be something wrong because of this persistent ache that wouldn’t leave him alone. Something was missing.
All Harry sees is mud and grass with a slab of stone carved to bear Draco's name.
Draco stares straight ahead, his cheeks burning. He can’t bring himself to look at Blaise for fear of every secret spilling from his lips.
“Lies,” Draco hisses. “We’re not even friends—“
The door flings open, and Potter stares at Draco, his eyes narrowed.
“Um.” Harry pokes her shoulder. “Are you okay?”
Instead of Percy, he finds Malfoy, examining her reflection in the mirror, carefully smoothing out a knee-length green dress.
It's everything about him. He tries
“Thanks, Draco,” Potter says. “Don’t be a stranger, yeah?”
Harry has anxiety up to his throat right now, but it’s fine. He can do this. They’ve been dating for two years now, and Draco has already mentioned that this is something he wants.
Draco starts to snicker, and the rest of the room begins to laugh.
Potter pushes Draco gently to a normal standing position.
Potter,” Malfoy says tearfully.
"He promised me," Harry says, his voice poised on the edge of a cliff, "that he was getting better."
The third time Potter touches Draco is after Draco sells the Manor.
The second time Draco gets his hair cut, Pansy is nowhere to be found.
Harry takes back every nice thought they ever had about either of them. The list of said nice things is unsurprisingly small.
“What do you think?” Pansy asks.
“Oh, I didn’t read it,” Luna says airily. “I smelled it. Like clementine and cloves, which is the smell of love.”
It's going to be fine; it's going to be fine;
“You don’t have to be drunk,” Draco says. Salazar, he hates himself for being close to tears. He’s an idiot.
Harry resists the urge to start laughing hysterically.
Malfoy steps down from the truck, smoothing out invisible wrinkles in her suit jacket. She locks the truck, then sneers at Harry, her even white teeth flashing in the night. Harry thinks,
The next day, Draco gets a three-piece suit in the mail. He smiles.
Draco opens his mouth, but no words come out. He has to try several before his mouth is capable of making actual sounds.
Draco swallows. There are too many things fluttering in his mind right now, and he can’t pin them down. All he can think of is Harry’s skin, his hair, their eyes, the way they’re all but sitting in Draco’s lap in a public restaurant.
Draco nods stiffly, then makes his way to the door. Just before he closes the door behind him, he hears Ginny say, “Something has to be done, Luna.”
But Draco.
Draco’s eyes start to sting.
Draco sends the letter before his common sense turns back on.
“Are you working an a new one?” Potter asks, gesturing to the many papers spread across Draco’s table.
It’s clinical. It’s nothing. It doesn’t imply any affection.
says Potter, “doesn’t really
Robards squeezes Harry's shoulder. "Let me know when you're ready to return to work," he whispers.
“That’s nice of you,” Harry says lamely.
“Can you do something like that?” Draco asks.
Everything about this is completely normal.
“Oh, God,” Draco said, his voice high. “Oh, sweet fucking

Before Harry can respond, Draco pulls back abruptly, anxiety clawing its way up his chest.
Draco doesn’t have an eating disorder.

Harry can’t remember his exact reaction, but he remembers just
This does not have the devastating impact Draco had hoped for. Instead, Pansy howls with laughter, apparently so overcome with the hilarity of Draco becoming friends with a

“Thank you,” he says.
When it comes time for presents, Harry finds that Draco, per usual, found the perfect gift: a bright red, heated blanket with Snitches zooming across the fabric.
“I love you,” Harry says. “All of you, no matter how much you drive me mad.”

Ginny is quiet as Draco counts out the money. Draco has never been more grateful that he managed to memorize how the Muggles’ blasted money system works. Looking like a fool in front of a Muggle was one thing--looking like a fool in front of a

Scorpius shakes his head.

Normal. Like any other young man on the street without a hint of tragedy, infamy, or scandal clinging to him.
(A Muggleborn is one fourth as likely as a Pureblood to experience depression or suicidal ideation. A Squib is three times as likely to attempt suicide. Remnants of Death Eaters still exist and harass, threaten, beat, and sometimes kill anyone who doesn’t match their idea of a pure wizard.)
Draco’s hands start to tremble because Blaise
But Harry is stuck, in one moment, in one frame, kneeling at Draco's side and placing his ear to Draco's chest, waiting for the heartbeat and the breath that never come.
“I don’t want to!” Draco yells, and a silence falls upon the room.
Draco walks out of the shop, shaking slightly. He doesn’t know where he’s going.
Draco can’t stop his hands from shaking.
Pansy catches sight of Harry and freezes, their eyes wide.
Blaise throws his head back and laughs, this sharp, short bark from the back of his throat.
“I don’t think a haircut is going to hide me for long,” Draco says.
Draco was seven when it first happened. He remembers whining to his father for several minutes straight about some idiotic toy that he wanted. Before he knew what was happening, his father grabbed him by the arm and marched him back to his room.
"I can't stop looking at it," Harry says.
Luna rests her head on Ginny's shoulder, her pale hair streaming down Ginny's chest. Harry's breath stutters for a brief second because
He doesn’t blame Pansy and Blaise. Draco knows that they’re dealing with their own consequences and issues. Pansy and Blaise are barely able to keep their heads above water, let alone help Draco as well.
Ron's face is ashen. He steps closer to Harry, the glass crunching under his shoes.
is a completely different matter.
“It’s good,” Draco says.
Harry is surprised into a laugh in spite of himself. “Get over yourself, Malfoy,” he says, jumping out of the truck.
But there is a shuttered look in Harry’s eyes, and Draco recognizes it as the same look he saw a few years ago whenever he looked in the mirror.
He's so cold.
“I don’t mind,” Draco says.
Draco doesn’t have an eating disorder. He has time management skills.
Draco can’t think of anything to say. Potter’s hand is on Draco’s shoulder, and now his other hand is on Draco’s forehead.
Potter rubs his face and sighs. He looks too tired to argue with Draco, which is a rarity in itself.

The war has ended, and the Ministry cleared him of all charges. This does not mean that the
Draco is running on panic and confusion and hatred. Any food he tries to eat just comes right back up, no matter how hard he tries to keep it down. Draco lives on juice and water and the occasional cracker or slice of cheese (sometimes a piece of chocolate if he has earned it, which is rare).
Ron rolls his eyes and take a swig of beer, clearly signaling that he wants this conversation over with. Ron is a good friend, but he can only handle listening to Harry’s gift woes for so long.
A low note of anxiety begins to hum through Draco’s body. What seemed so reasonable back at the Manor makes no sense now. Potter wouldn’t believe Draco if he says he’s not hungry
at least, there are supposed to be,” Pansy adds, giving Harry a nasty look.
Malfoy starts, meeting Harry’s eye in the mirror.
“We could do an undercut,” Pansy says. “I could buzz a little flower design in the back.”
“Oh,” Scorpius says, visibly disappointed. “Hullo, Harry. I thought you were Rose.”
Draco can feel tears forming, and he hates himself for that. Crying in front of a person he barely knows is bad enough, but crying in front of
A few days later, a check arrives from Potter, along with a politely worded apology that Granger no doubt dictated. Luna artfully manages to “leak” this newest tidbit to the press, and soon name after name begins to pour in.
He doesn’t have to tell Potter anything. They aren’t even friends.
to drown, and—)
"I was going to propose," Harry says through stiff lips.
Potter grins and claps Draco’s shoulder. “Great. I’ll see you later. Try not to get murdered before then.”
The worst feeling is when Draco tallies up his deeds and finds that the bad things outnumber the good, and it’s not even because of the hunger pangs he knows he will feel. It’s the sheer shame coursing through his veins, the reminder that
“I think it’s a great idea,” Luna says serenely. “Percy, you always complain that no one wants to make fun of Harry with you.”
The man’s robes set on fire, and he starts to scream. Ron stumbles back, cursing. Harry quickly casts a spell to douse the flames because he’s obnoxiously good like that. For a brief second, his eyes meet Draco’s.
Ginny starts to say, “You shouldn’t—“
It’s like being touched by the sun.
It’s the only word people seem to know nowadays.
“Some things,” Draco whispers, “can’t be atoned for.”
Harry offers a weak little wave. “Hi, Pansy,” they say. He looks at Malfoy, tilting his head ever so slightly. “Do you go by Draco now?”
(Except Draco isn’t treading water. He’s drowning, and he
Draco tries to keep his face unreadable, but Blaise still sees, of course. He always does.
Draco gives Harry a sympathetic smile.
Blaise is holding the list.
"I need--I need to go home," Draco says dizzily.
“—beautiful,” Potter finishes, his voice falling to a hushed whisper.
“We’re actually not archnemeses anymore,” Harry says. “I mean, I think we would both ignore screams of pain and torture from the other if we were having a bad day, but we’re not—” Malfoy sneers at Harry the second time this night, and Harry remembers why they felt like knocking her teeth out their entire time at school together. “Fine. You’re my archnemesis, we would kill each other given the chance, and blah blah blah. Happy now?”
Draco is marred.
“What do you want?” Draco asks in the least rude way possible.
“But--” Draco couldn’t think of a proper rebuttal. “But it’s dark in there.”
She stared. “Harrison… You killed that monster. You didn’t leave it alive in those tunnels.”
“What?” Harry snapped, causing a few of the Hufflepuff’s nearby to look back at him. He quickly lowered his voice, practically hissing at his friend. “You can’t be serious. I’m not some kid that doesn’t know what he’s doing. I’ve fought dark wizards, survived a fight with a basilisk, and escaped from Voldemort. I don’t need a
“No, Aunt Petunia,” Harry said quickly. “We… We just need a moment of your time. To have a quick chat. It’s… It’s kind of about Lily.”
Running a hand over his face, Harry groaned.
XxXXxX
Harry gave a careful, nervous smile. “Hello, Aunt Petunia.”
Another affirmative, and another note.
“Well?” she said, seeming both pleased and angry with him. “What have you got started?”
, was throwing around unforgivables? I mean, really, letting things slide and Death Eaters escape Azkaban is what the Ministry does best nowadays.”
With a heavy sigh, Harry went to shower and get ready for the day. Thankfully, Greg doesn’t attempt to follow him in and stays out by the door. After coming out, clean and dressed, Harry led the way out of the dungeons to stop by the kitchens. Greg was more than happy to ask the elves for enough food to feed an army, while Harry just got some toast, a small bowl of fruit, and a mug of tea.
After a quick chat with Pucey, Harry was left to get started on his Potions essay on Moonstones. He worked on his bed, glancing up to watch as Honavi slipped around the room, exploring every nook and cranny. And, until dinner, that’s how he spent his afternoon.
“Do you need a lozenge, Miss Umbridge?” McGonagall demanded coldly, turning her furious gaze back on the other witch. “If so, I suggest you go to Madam Pomfrey. However, if you are doing this to gain my attention, I’m beginning to wonder how you expect to gain any idea of my teaching methods. You see, I generally do not allow people to interrupt me when I am speaking, as you should remember.”
After pressing a kiss to his forehead, she got up from the floor and headed to the door. She shot him a smile before she left, and moved down the hallway, leaving Harry to his thoughts. He just wanted to be able to talk to his friends again.
“Uh, Harry,” Freya said, a brow raised. “What’s with your friend?”
“Is something wrong, Offi-” The woman cut herself off when her eyes landed on Harry. She stared, a storm of emotions flashing in her eyes, to fast for Harry to see. “You…”
Harry raised a brow at her. “Where would we meet? How would we get a large group of people inside without someone seeing us? How would we even recruit? For now, we just have to wait, and keep our heads down. Think you can do that Hermione?”
“Harrison!” she gasped. “You haven’t gone back down there!”
Dudley looked up, confused. “You mean whatever Mum wanted you to tell me?”
Maria spoke up next. Much like Dorian, she reported that those at Beauxbatons were in agreement. Madam Maxine seemed to have allied herself with Dumbledore. The french school would be preparing the best way it could for the inevitable dangers of the coming war. French Ministry officials were all investigating Harry’s claim, and they seemed to trust Madam Maxine more then they did Fudge.
Instantly, Maria’s face hardened.
to observe, and make sure that my teaching is holding up to Ministry standards. Your job is
“For the summer,” his father said. “We think it would be best if you were to stay out of the public eye for a while, and if you go out, you’ll need to stay with a chaperone. In the meantime, you will continue your training. In everything.”
Looking up, Harry blinked. “What?”
“Now, today we will be starting the year with Vanishing spells. They are easier than Conjuring spells, which are NEWT level, but could appear on your OWL test. We will be attempting to vanish snails first. Completely vanishing them will be our goal for the next few lessons. However, should you all manage it sooner, we will move on to mice early.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. He didn’t like hearing anyone talk to his family that way, much less a pig of a man like Vernon Dursley. He wanted to snap at the man, to finally be rid of him, but he knew that he couldn’t just sit back and let them get hurt or even die because of him. He didn’t want to have anything else to do with them, and they certainly weren’t going to write.
That sent a soft murmur around the Slytherins. Across the room from him, Harry could hear Blaise and Theo muttering in agitation, before the former thrust his hand into the air.
“I said,” Harry grit out. “Yes. I do expect to be attacked while we’re here. Three out of four of our teachers have attacked me, two of which aimed to
They spent the entire morning at the hospital, with Harry’s brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, trickling in as they heard the news. They sat and waited as long as they could, before they had to go home.
She cut herself off again, her eyes darted towards Jonathan, then back at Harry. And Harry realized something. Petunia and Vernon had most certainly known about magic. Sure, Harry knew that they knew, if only because Snape had talked about them as if they did, but he had never really acknowledged it. That his entire childhood, they had lied to him about
XxXXxX
“Everything?”
Turning back to the board, she began to write again, starting a bulleted list of a basic rundown of their teachers for each year.
“Ma’am.” His voice was as sharp as the scrape of his chair on the floor, filling the room and commanding the attention of everyone within. All eyes moved to him, even Umbridge, as he held his head high in defense of his teacher. “You can think whatever you like. Trust me, I don’t always believe in predictions either, but in my years at this school, there is one thing that has always remained true: if Professor Trelawney makes a prediction about danger in your future, you had best heed the warning. When it comes to death and peril, she is seldom wrong.”
When Vernon’s eyes landed on him, it was clear that, much like Petunia, he didn’t like the sight of Harry.
when she died?”
He meant it as a joke. Really, he had. But Dudley stuffed his hands into his pockets, looking down at the ground as he kicked a rock. He looked unbelievably sad, and so very lonely. And that’s when Harry began to wonder if, after he had left, if Dudley had had anyone his own age around. How long after losing their ‘wealthy’ status had the Dursley’s moved? And would Dudley been able to handle public school alone? Where he couldn’t use wealth to make friends anymore?
“Well,” Jonathan said, looking from his little note to the house. “Seems like this is the place.”
Heaving a sigh, Harry hung his head in his hands, ruffling his hair in agitation. “Yeah, yeah, I know. She was bullying Trelawney for a prediction. Her predictions in class are usually bullshit, but that doesn't give Umbridge the right to act that way."
would be there. Jonathan was still doing muggle police work in Little Winning last he heard, and Freya’s husband was supposed to be in Romania with Ron’s brother Charlie. Not to mention that Russell was on tour with his band, and his wife Maria was still supposed to be at Beauxbatons in France.
“Not exactly the kind of party you’d be into, Big D,” Harry told him instead. “You’d have to get the wizard equivalent of a suit, and learn a ton of wizarding manners beforehand. Not to mention the dancing and all that.” The look of disappointment was clear, and Harry wished he could say yes. “But, uh, if you want, I can see about you coming out to the house sometime anyway? My birthday is soon.”
“Some sort of infighting between your kind,” she said, almost off handedly, like she didn’t care. “It wasn’t my problem then, and it isn’t my problem now.”
From the side of the room, Greg gave a little cough, as if he wasn’t sure if he was supposed to say anything to that. Draco quickly stood, like he’d been snapped out of some kind of daze. Cheeks burning red, the blond cleared his own throat, and set Harry down on his bed.
Frowning, his mother nods. “Of course. Did you think of someone who doesn’t know yet?”
“No thanks,” Harry sighed. “I just want to be able to pass my OWLs without worrying about dying this year. Though, I suppose that’s too much to ask, considering my track record.”
It was clear that she and Dudley didn’t seem to understand any of what Harry was staying, but he didn’t bother explaining. He was curious if she was actually interested in what he did at school, or if she was just asking to be polite. It seemed it was the latter, as she quickly moved on.
She didn’t seem to like how quiet he was. Though, Harry couldn’t blame her. Outside of his potioneering basement, Derrick was a lot like Snape, withdrawn and reserved. They didn’t get to see him like Harry did, moving about and with that eager shine to his eye to discover something new.
Instantly, Harry groaned. Draco had sicced Greg on him as a guard dog. Now the blond's strange behavior the night before made sense. The confession about Sirius had Draco convinced that Harry couldn’t be trusted to protect himself, and needed someone there to vet people that Harry interacted with.
Swallowing the growing lump in his throat, Harry did his best to not let his voice crack when he spoke. “Where… Where did you get this?”
The next morning, Harry woke to a nearly empty dorm room. Emphasis on nearly.
After arriving at the hospital, a mediwitch was quick to lead them to where his mother was being kept. She was trying to tell them something, maybe calm them down, but Harry wasn’t listening. His heart was pounding, practically trying to beat out of his chest, as his ears rang with the rush of blood.
“The Potter family vault,” she admitted. “When we went to get your things, your first year, I got the key for their vault, where all the things from their house would have gone. I didn’t take anything from it, before today, but after you went to school, I went down there to have a list made of all the things inside. After all, James was the last Potter, and that family once had an impressive collection of magical items.
She paused, eyes narrowed in a way Harry had never seen before. Every time Maria had spoken in the past, she had been calm and carefully composed. Never had she gained such a stern tone, an almost imposing air around her. For a moment, Harry wasn’t sure that he was looking at the same woman that had married his brother.
“Not sure anyone can forget he’s there. He’s a huge kid.”
“That’s it?” Harry asked. “That’s all you have to say? You just… believe me?”
XxXXxX
BTW, I have started plans for taking a Draco/Harry leaning. You've been warned.
“Well, he must belong to someone,” Draco hummed, looking around. “Probably someone in our room. Did Theo or Blaise mention getting a cat?”
In the meantime, Harry went to sit with his snakes, using the time to talk about Sila to them, telling them all about the giant sperant that Harry had met two years ago. They were split rather evenly between interested and cautious. Strup and Gift all seemed rather uninterested all togther, but agreed to go anyway. It might have had something to do with Honavi’s excited encouragement.
“Yes,” his father said. “Yes. I’m here.”
“Well, maybe you can meet some of my friends next time.” Pausing, Harry grinned. “Actually… I know a girl who lives not even a half hour drive from here. She’s the brightest witch of the age, and she could probably tell you a lot more about our history then I could. Then again, you’d probably be a lot more interested in meeting the Weasley’s…”
“That’s very kind,” Draco says unsteadily, “but I have a lot of work to do.”

He wanted this for so long, but now that it is in reach, he had no idea how to take it.

“Are you sick?” Potter asks hesitantly. “Do you need—do you need a Healer?”
On Christmas day, Harry is trying his best to calm himself down.

And that’s that.
Harry laughs and presses a kiss at the corner of Draco’s mouth.
There is a loud crash, and Draco turns in his seat to find Ron pinning a man against the wall.
“That would make sense,” Potter says. “Sickness can do that to you.”
and--
“The worst thing is that he always knows what to get me,” grumbles Harry. “Then I feel like a complete prat as he pastes on his polite society smile and tells me how much he loves mine.”
They all laugh, Draco included, but Draco can’t remember the last time he found anyone’s jokes funny.
So Draco picks up a shard of glass from his shattered mirror.
“You didn’t know what you were doing,” Draco says stiffly.
“It’s a very nice lap,” Ginny says.
He hopes Harry will not hate him. Draco knows that Harry will understand, though. Harry has always seen the parts of Draco that he prefers to keep hidden.
Blaise starts to say, “Mate--”
“That was a cheap shot,” Draco says in a hard voice. “Never have I ever lived in a house without peacocks.”
"I don't know, Harry," she says finally. "But I think--I think these may have

Harry rubs his face, then presses the heels of his palms against his eyes.

Malfoy groans. “He/him, and Pansy, this is
"I don't understand why I'm here," Harry says.
Harry should probably stay closeted around the likes of Malfoy—if anyone were likely to be transphobic, she would be the one. But Harry feels the urge to be reckless tonight. At any rate, it’s not like anyone will be upset with him if they end up murdering Malfoy in a fit of blind rage. Except Pansy and Blaise, but Harry is pretty sure he could take them.
"No, there has to be someone to blame," Harry says frantically. "There has to be a
Draco follows Potter inside, somehow feeling numb and tight and raw at the same time.
“Sure,” Ginny says.
He can barely breathe. Each breath is like a spasm, a spike of pain slicing down his throat.
“Wizard eBay is a myth!”
Draco stared at Pansy, his mouth falling open slightly.
“Ginny,” they say gently, “you’re not transphobic; you’re a lesbian. It’d be more transphobic if you
Draco writes a book about his time as a Death Eater. Then he writes another about the history of Dark Magic and another about the life of Tom Riddle and another about the plights of Squibs.
“Oh, God,” she gasps. “Oh, sweet fucking Merlin. Pansy’s going to go

A few weeks pass. Blaise's words keep echoing in Harry's mind and combining with everyone else's.
But there is a prickling on his neck that will not go away.
Blaise told him that they would meet here, but Blaise is nowhere to be found.
Draco’s head hurts, and he scrubs furiously at his face. He needs to stop crying. If this is the way he’s going to react to talking to Potter, Golden Boy Extraordinaire, about it, he’s probably going to start sobbing if he talks to anyone else.
Potter pulls away, his hands falling from Draco’s skin. Draco hates the way he immediately misses their presence.
Draco went into the cupboard.
“I’m fine,” Draco says.
“I completely understand, sir,” she says. “I dated a white man last year, and it was the worst dating experience of my life.”
Harry stares down at his hands. Try as he might, the quivering will not cease.
Draco is just opening his mouth to retort with some of the nastiest adjectives he knows when a tall, well-dressed wizard grabs him by his lapels and slams him against the wall.
Draco finds himself wandering London at night.
Life moves on. (Life
Draco’s eyes widen, and his breath catches in his throat.
It’s Draco’s.

Draco feels his stomach tighten with every new letter.
"You've been stuck inside for a week," Ginny says, linking arms with Harry.
“You’re sexy,” Pansy says cheerfully. “You should wear red next time you go on a ‘not a date’ with Potter.”
“Of course not,” Harry says, pushing back Draco’s hair.
Draco turns to see Potter leaning against the wall.
The wizard is still screaming about Death Eaters and murder and blood, and Draco can't stop his hands from shaking.
In their fifth year, Pansy told him that they didn’t feel like
“I didn’t ask.”
Potter brushes past Draco without a second glance. Draco’s entire body is on fire now, as if he’s back in the Manor with Voldemort, with Aunt Bella standing over him, hissing foul threats as she casts stinging hex after—
She and Ginny walk away, hand in hand.
Draco surges forward, his arms wrapping around Harry’s body, and kisses them again. Harry stills for one moment, then kisses back. They’re soft and warm under Draco’s hands, on top of Draco’s thighs, against Draco’s lips, and Draco has been cold for
“Tell me about it,” Draco says, pecking Harry’s cheek. “He’s always rushing to and fro. I swear, he practically lives off of protein bars.”
And all the terror rises up Draco’s spine because she
Blaise leans in, his eyes glinting.
“Nothing,” says Potter. “You just . . . surprise me.” His voice lowers, and he fiddles with the cuff of his sleeve. “In the best of ways, of course.”
“We’re s’posed to play today,” Scorpius continues obliviously. He brightens. “Are you here to take me to her?”
Draco instinctively reaches for his wand to repair Potter’s glasses. Except he doesn’t have his wand because Potter didn’t give it back after the trial, and no one will sell him a new one, and—
Contrary to what many British people believe, tea does not fix everything.
How bad could one late night waffle run be?
“I’m not gon’ make you do anything,” Harry says. “Not right. Too drunk.”
“Would you go with me?” Draco asks, trying to keep the pleading note from his voice.
trans?”
“How does it look?” Tessa.
Draco starts another charity, this time with Granger, that focuses on finding Muggleborns before their eleventh birthday to start easing them and their parents into the Wizarding World right away. Most likely due to Granger’s influence, Potter attaches his bank account and his money to this charity, too, and the donations start flooding in.
Blaise stands behind her, his arms crossed, a murky fury swirling in his eyes. Draco feels like his lungs have been crushed.
Potter looks so
He just doesn’t deserve to eat.
“Why?” Harry asks.
“Is there someone you can owl?” Potter asks. “Your mum or whatever?”
Harry apparates away, right as Pansy's hand latched onto his arm.
Blaise claims that Draco looks like some edgy Muggle punk who has run out on his parents and joined a band that screams instead of sings.
“I’m doomed,” Harry tells their ceiling.

“No,” Ginny says. “It’s good.”
Potter smiles at him.
She looks at Draco, as if daring him to argue.
Draco is clean, for one, and wearing proper clothing. He has a job at

Potter ordered a hamburger.
This is ridiculous. It has only been a few days. (Except Draco had gotten used to having more good things than bad things, had gotten used to being able to eat almost every day.)
“You look like you need alcohol,” Potter says, his voice dry.

It’s not that Harry is too sad about this. They should probably have broken up with Ginny right away, after all, instead of putting the responsibility on her.
them to be happy. I just—why didn’t they tell me?”
His mind always jumps to Azkaban now, no matter how miniscule the offense.
“You gonna eat that?” Harry asks. His burger is already half-gone.
Scorpius wraps his arms around Harry’s waist for less than one second before skipping off, humming a cheerful tune.
Draco knows full well that
“Merry Christmas, Draco,” says Harry.
“Do you
Draco shuts that thought off quickly because
He should get dressed. Or shower. Or something.

"Mr. Potter," the Auror starts to say.
Harry trudges home, counting the days until his doom.
“It probably won’t do,” Harry says glumly but purchases it anyway.
"So you're sacking me."
Draco’s mouth opens and closes.
“Did I say that ou’ loud?” he asked blurrily.
He’s not racist anymore. He thinks. At least, he’s trying not to be.
“Yes, dear?” she said, voice gentle.
A groan from the ground next to him drew Harry’s attention. He turned, kneeling down next to Dudley. His cousin wasn’t dead, thankfully. Just dazed. The Dementor had been more focused on Harry.
“Is Professor Snape not joining us?” his father said, voice calm and soft, but clearly carrying down the table.
“Dad?” Harry asked.
Draco and Blaise shared a look, one of deep concern. Harry belatedly realized his slip, wincing as he tried to think of a way to explain that didn’t sound as crazy as the truth.
Ron groans and hoists her up.
“Um,” Draco says, unsure of what other words to use to describe a haircut, “very short.”
"Ron says it's not my fault," says Harry.
“Never have I ever gone to Paris and stayed at a five star hotel with room service delivered every night,” Granger says.
Draco hesitates to say that he hates his friends, but also he
“You know about Luna?”
Malfoy cautiously touches her pale hair, as if she were afraid mere touch might burn it away.
“Fuck
“I’m gonna shut up now,” Potter says, snapping his gaze away. He awkwardly offers Draco the cauldron. “Crockpot. I made soup.”
“Nice shirt, Potter,” says Malfoy. “Just as hideous as the rest of your closet.”
“It’s our ancestral home,” Narcissa says.
“Forget it,” he spits, and stalks away.
Draco spends the night dry-heaving over a toilet.
Harry straddles Draco on the couch. Harry is kissing him, and Draco is technically kissing back, but he can't bring himself to
“That’s right…”
They went up, one by one, to demonstrate the first year spells Maria wrote on the board. It was almost surreal, demonstrating green and red sparks, lumos and fumos, along with flipendo. Such… simple spells that had only been used in practice, or he had used nearly every day since learning it.
Frowning, Harry pursed his lips. “Well, the majority seem to believe the paper. They don’t want to believe that he’s back, so they don’t. Hermione and Ron believe me, of course. So do Ron’s brothers, Fred and George, as well as his sister Ginny. I managed to talk to Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang before hand. While Cho didn’t seem to want to listen, or even understand at first, Cedric did, and was able to convince her I was telling the truth. They said that they would eventually try talking with the other Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, but after the article, no one would really listen. Hermione and Ron’s siblings have been having just about as little luck with the Gyfindors, though Neville Longbottom seemed understand.”
“Why don’t we take this inside,” Jonathan said quickly, smiling in hope of keeping everything under control. “Maybe we can talk over a cup of tea?”
XxXXxX
“Draco too… She really likes him… Calls him ‘the pretty one’. She likes it when he comes down into the Chamber…”
, by Inigo Imago. Harry picked his copy up, just to see what kind of nonsense they’d be ‘learning’ today. Seemed like they’d be working on dream interpretation…
“Have you had Defense?” Harry asked instead, keeping carefully calm. “I haven’t been able to see Maria yet, and I don’t have Defense until tomorrow.”
“What happened to her?” Derrick asked. He was probably the only one of the three of them that could speak at the moment. “Was she able to tell you?”
?! With that
!” Ron was hissing at her. “Seriously, Hermione, don’t you know how much trouble he could get in?”
“Harrison,” Draco said, voice thick with worry and somewhat drawn out, as though the blond was speaking to a five year old. “Are you forgetting about Sirius Black? Third year, he broke into the castle and nearly stabbed you and Weasley in your sleep.”
“I wasn’t aware that Millicent had gotten a new cat,” the blond said, more to himself, rather than Greg and Vince, who had come in behind him.
“I know about magic,” Harry said. “And about how Lily and James really died. You do too, right?”
“He a police officer like the other guy?” Dudley asked, reaching to take another biscuit that Petunia had put out.
Harry himself could feel his stomach churn and tighten at the sight of the man who beat him and mistreated him throughout most of his child. He had known that Vernon had gotten out of prison, but he had been hoping not to see him. Sure, it had been inevitable. But he rather not have to deal with his uncle. Or his cousin.
They ate, talking softly about things Harry wanted to do before he went back to school. Today, they’d be adding some grass and flowers to the bottom of his planter, under the whistling flower bush, but they could try to do something different every other week. After all, he deserved time off just like everyone else.
Sorry for the delay! Things have gotten hectic... Again.
She glowered at him, brow pulled tight. “It isn’t half cocked…”
“Nothing, mate,” he insisted. “Hermione just had a bad idea, is all.”
As students slowly worked on the vanishing spell, McGonagall wandered the room. Umbridge, while not following her, did ask questions whenever McGonagall got to close.
For a moment, Umbridge simply studied him. Then, she smiled, the gesture making Harry’s spine crawl as she descended the trapdoor, the scratch of her quill echoing as she disappeared. Harry simply glowered after her, knowing he probably made more trouble for himself down the line. He dropped back into his seat, turning to scratch once more at his page, as Trelawney stepped up to his table.
“It’s true,” Maria said. “I’m pregnant. Ten weeks, the mediwizard said… It’s why I’m not at Beauxbatons. As much as Madam Maxine wanted to keep me on as the Defense instructor, she thinks it wouldn’t be good for me to stay and have to leave in the middle of the school year. Not… Not when a war is coming.”
“Mr. Alistair,” McGonagall suddenly called. Harry jerked, looking over at her. “It would be best if you paid attention. Unless you intend to vanish your desk.”
"How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?" Umbridge asked first.
Before Harry could continue, Draco stood, lips still pressed tight. “Alistair,” he said, making Harry wince. He was only Alistair when Draco was mad at him… “If you insist on doing idiotic things, then I’m off to bed. I’ll see you in the morning.”
“The potions must have finally kicked in.”
“I have an idea,” Harry said with a grin. “Actually, I think I may have accidentally made the perfect spot over the last two years.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mrs. Dursley,” Jonathan said, putting on his best officer smile. “Maybe it would be a good idea for us to discuss this in private? Maybe Harrison and your son can go out, take a walk, so everyone can be filled in?”
If Petunia hadn’t been tense before, she was especially ridgid now. “Your mother? What could you possibly have to talk to me about her for? Can’t you be asking your-”
“I will call you, like everyone else,” his father said, not looking up from where he was sat. “So go home.”
Harry’s head snapped up, vision tunneling in on the mediwitch that had led the way. He felt his blood boil, nails digging into his palms as his hands curled into fists. Potion? What potion?
Draco threw open the door, mid rant. “-and I can’t believe Theo agreed with him! He’s supposed to be smarter than that perverted cretin. Why, if it wouldn’t cause a mess with my father, I’d curse his-”
Harry blinked, glancing around in confusion. It took him a moment to look behind him, noticing Greg standing just a step or so behind him, and watching the class and Ron over Harry’s shoulder.
For a moment, Harry wondered if he should tell her about the hearing. It did, after all, involve Dudley… If he had been charged, they would have come to Obliviate them. Still, he didn’t want them worrying about him. To know that he would be fighting this war on more than one front… So he thought of other things to tell them.
Umbridge sat in the corner, clipboard in hand.
For once, Trelawney didn’t immediately go off about how it meant he would die before the end of the year. Instead, her voice grew rather quiet, misty even, as she spoke. “You are entering a new chapter of your life, a pause in the cycle of inner turmoil and conflict. However, it is just the calm before the storm. A darkness approaches, which will cause you great pain and suffering. If you manage to purge this darkness, you will be graced with wealth and prosperity.”
Ron frowned, not seeming to follow. “What do you mean? Where are you thinking?”
Deciding to just fully come clean, Harry sighed. He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands. “Sirius… is my Godfather. And he’s on our side.”
“Of course it does,” Harry hissed, glowering. “But how are we going to be prepared for a fight, if no one is going to teach us?”
as their Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. And, as Inquisitor, it is
“Zinnia,” he breathed, shaking hand reaching out to hers on the bed. Voice thick with worry and agony. The stoic head of the Alistair family dropped to his knees, unable to hold himself up as he desperately held onto his wife's hand. “Zinnia… I… I’m…”
“Not since I was here last,” he lied. “Not yet anyway. My parents hold a party, at the beginning of August, every year. Mum is busy with the planning. She does most of it herself, before getting help with set up. It’s lots of fun, though. I usually get to invite two of my friends from school, and they stay at the house for a few nights.”
“I’m supposed to watch you,” Greg said, as a way of explaining.
defensive spells? I certainly can’t imagine any situation arising in the classroom where you would need to use any spell.”
The bell rang for lunch, and Harry gathered up his bag. With a quick smile and wave to Maria, he hurried out to get to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
For the first time since learning the spell, a corporeal patronus sprang forth. The large glowing animal charged forward to defend Harry from the darkness of the Dementor, catching it in the chest with its antlers. It threw the Dementor back, like it was nothing, until the Dementor fled.
When they finally arrived at the room, the Mediwitch carefully sliding the door open for them, Harry could have sworn his heart had stopped.
By the time ten o’clock arrived, Harry was finished with everything, and was carefully shooing the younger students to their dorms. Noah was the last to go, having held onto the sleeve of Harry’s robes all the way to the dormitory hallway. He wasn’t sure why Noah was so attached to him, but the kid was rather cute.
“Oh,” he sighed. “I may have mentioned Sirius yesterday, and now Draco doesn’t think I can be trusted to make good decisions. So he apparently set Greg as my personal guard. Just… Ignore him, and you’ll forget he’s there.”
“Attacked?!” She bellowed, voice hauntingly sadistic. “Mr. Zabini, you’ll be learning in a risk free environment. There will be no attacking done in this class.”
Harry nodded. “This is gonna sound crazy, D, but… Magic is real. I’m a wizard. So were my parents, and so is my family.”
I'm gonna be adding more tags soon, and I was wondering if anyone had any that they thought needed to be added? I'm not sure myself at this point...
“Come on, Big D,” Harry said, pulling Dudley to his feet as best he could. “Let’s get you home.”
Greg and Vince didn’t bother trying to deny it, and were quickly back out the door. Draco turned to follow, only to pause, and turn back to gently rub between Harry’s ears.
. And while we may have cut ties, he may still send people after you if he thinks that it would draw me out. So, really, Mrs. Dursley. I’ve only come to issue a warning. Nothing else.”
"Petunia," a voice grunted as the front door banged open. "We’re back."
She wasn’t. Instead, they got a letter from Saint Mungos.
“Harrison?” his mother said, catching his attention.
“Yeah. Nephew, actually. Oldest sisters son.” Harry shook his head. “We didn’t come out here to talk about my family, though. Well, not really.”
He shook his head, running his hands through the fur on Harry’s back. “I thought he trusted me…”
“Merlin, no.” He couldn’t help but chuckle. “No, Derrick is a Potions Master. Trained by one of my teachers, the best potioneer in the British wizarding world. You may remember him, Aunt Petunia. Severus Snape?”
Pursing her lips, she had an all too familiar look in her eye. The look she got when she was about to storm off for research. “Of course. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go to the library.”
For a moment, Professor Trelawney sputtered. “I… But… W-wait!” She took a deep breath, clearly trying to calm herself and return to her usual misty air, even as her fists shook at her side. “I… I do see something… It’s about you… Why, I sense darkness… A danger lurking…” Raising her hand, Trelawney pointed a finger at Umbridge, hand shaking as the toad simply continued to smile. “You are in grave danger! A great peril awaits you!”
