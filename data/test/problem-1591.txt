“Yes?”
Draco chanced a glance at Harry and both men smiled.
"How have you guys been?" Harry addressed Seamus and Dean.
.          Malfoy appeared to be doing something similar. He still had his fists clenched, but now he was rubbing his thumb against his index finger. He looked miserable and torn—confused, as though he didn’t know what to do. He bit his lip. “Well, I, um, I suppose. If you’d like. I’m living here…in Manchester. In Moss Side. Which, I suppose that doesn’t matter as owls can find someone no matter their location or knowledge of their location…” he rambled on, looking like he was thinking of something else.
He couldn’t wait to tell Hermione about his new organization skills. She’d be proud of him.
“Stop,” Draco demanded. “What else did she tell you?”
“Awesome,” Harry said.
The room grew silent for a few moments.
First Potter was attending his university and now his bar? Did Draco not have one sacred place left? He stopped when he got past the back corner of the bar. He listened closely but could only hear Xavier’s words.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well…” Andromeda stopped talking, and she smiled a little guiltily. “Yes. For someone who is only learning it very casually and slowly, yes. I do think that you’d do well if you learned it professionally, though.”
Andromeda made sure to handle all the food, but Harry didn't feel useless.
sleep tonight, damn it.
“’Uni-like’? Is that even a real term?”
.          “Oh, don’t do too much, Harry. You’ve already decided to show us much of Manchester and your university. I don’t want you straining yourself,” she replied. She had that “oh, Harry, you’ve had such a hard life you just need to relax also are you okay I’m worried about you” look on her face that so many people had given him after the war’s end. He was fine. He really, truly was fine.
"Really?!" Draco asked. He sounded excited.
don’t run away from my problems.”
Malfoy exhaled, halted, and turned around. He waited for Harry to approach him, clearly not wanting to cause a scene.
“We decided on Ruby—for Gryffindor,” Ron elaborated.
“What…what does the probation consist of?”
“Yeah, I’ll get him.” Harry stood up and started walking. He made his way up the stairs and into Teddy’s room. He went over to Teddy’s bed and crouched by it. For a second, he just simply observed the toddler and his steady breaths. Harry smiled to himself, unable to believe that someone this innocent and angelic could exist. He shook Teddy’s arm slightly.
. He’d swept, vacuumed, dusted, and washed the dishes from time to time, executive dysfunction be damned; the only problem was the messiness and clutter. Harry picked up all of his dirty clothes and shoved them into the closet in the lounge. He cleared some things off the sofa and pushed everything out of the way of the fireplace. Grabbing some of the floo powder from the pot on top of the mantle, Harry prepped for his small journey.
He swept the leaves into a garbage bag and went inside the house. Everything looked perfect. All of the decorations were up and the goody bags were fixed. The only things left to do were the graveyard brownies and the dinner. Andromeda and Harry decided to clean on the twenty-ninth, bake brownies on the thirtieth, and cook dinner a few hours before the party started.
“Teddy has been asking for you, tout le jour. [all day.]”
“It’s fine. You all catch up,” she affirmed.
“She called the whole thing off, moved to Italy, learned Italian, and started dating muggle women.”
religion. It seemed to be more like a philosophy class than anything.
Harry smiled. However, he noticed that things were much more calm and less colorful than normal. He asked, “Where’s Teddy?”
Harry smiled and walked over to Mr. Weasley and Draco. He waved when Draco noticed him. The two spoke for a few more minutes until Mr. Weasley excused himself.
Harry’s plan worked for the first half of the lecture. It felt like the longest hour of his life, but it only got more nerve-racking when Harry sniffed the air and caught a whiff of his own BO.
“You throw a clock out the window.”
The two men sat on the back porch until 2 AM when Draco finally decided to go home.
The night continued like that: a mixture of serious conversation, awkwardness, and puns. Harry loved it.
"I've got it.
April 6th came, and Harry had yet again spent the night before stressing in his bed about Teddy and his future. Insomnia was no stranger to Harry, but he hated when it happened before an important event. At 5AM, Harry dragged himself out of bed and onto the porch for a cigarette. He smoked it quickly, still not used to the low temperature and gentle rainfall of early April. He didn’t mind the cold, but he hated smoking in the rain. He went back in for a warm shower and then dressed himself in his auror trainee uniform, basic wizarding attire topped with a trench coat and pure black robes.
"Perhaps…" she said, smiling.
“What do you think you’re doing?” He asked, with a slightly angry and skeptical tone.
"Three martinis," Harry corrected.
"She's a beater," Luna informed him.
“To do drugs?”
“Is that what happens in December?” Harry sarcastically asked.
.          "Am I
. He didn’t want to get too far behind.
Harry shook his head and laughed.
“Do you believe in aliens?”
The movie ended and the two men walked out of the theater. Without thinking, Harry reached his hand down to meet Draco’s. Draco blushed and commented, “I think it’s weird that Anakin could just win a race without any practice.”
“Just cheeky. I’m really excited for this year to start. I can’t believe it’s only a week until Hogwarts goes back in session! Last year didn’t feel real, you know?”
“I don’t think that you should have been in Azkaban at all.”
“I may not practice a certain religion, but having a ‘pure-blooded’ relative from Kenya is supposed to be really important. I only wish I knew more about my heritage,” Harry said, swallowing some broccoli.
“So, what’s the plan for the rest of the day?” Draco asked.
It was about 10 PM when Harry decided to put Teddy to bed. He walked out of the toddler’s room and
The three of them grew quiet as they reached their apartment complex. Noise was something that bothered Gonzalo more than anything, especially after 9PM and before 7AM. They said their goodbyes and went in their respective doors. Draco went to the kitchen to grab a few Triscuit crackers and an Ambien. He set his alarm to 3PM and lay down on the mattress. He had work that night at 11PM.
[Is it that you like your courses?]
Harry had spent only part of his time thinking about Malfoy. He couldn’t understand why he was in Manchester, instead of in Étretat with his mother Narcissa. He couldn’t understand why he wasn’t in London. He couldn’t understand why he was in the damn
“So,” she began, a tinge of humor and curiosity in her voice, “Who was that?”
“Indeed.” She nodded. “Are you ready for your big speech?”
"Sorry, just curious. When Umbridge was at Hogwarts and I caught you and your friends…why did you guys always meet in there?"
Malfoy shrugged, threw up his hands, and walked off.
"Sure."
Harry shook his stupor away. “Oh, those. Yeah, um, they’re true. I just figured that I should do something a little more…lowkey, y’know?” Harry swallowed. He noticed that he was rubbing his chin. “Well, uh…I’d better be off. Y’know, big speech to do.” He faked a smile. “Nice seeing all of you again!”
A body, he felt more than saw, crouched down besides his own, voice lowered.
” And the huge smile on Draco’s face would always have that same effect on Harry—
For all his effort, regrettably, Harry never looked impressed. One day, soon, Draco would again dumbfound him with his charm, certain the man that had blushed like mad when Draco sang on stage had not been an illusion. As it stood, Draco was content with their current tentative acquaintance and had no wish to disturb it.
The woman named Hermione sighed. “Harry, I know how concerned you are for Draco.” Her voice softened, but her tone stayed firm. “But I can’t skip procedure, even for you, nor give you more answers on a developing case than I already have.”
“Goodbye Mr. Slughorn,” Luna said, which cheered the old man considerably.
Third tank, where he had spent most of his recreational time, playing with toys or laying on the soft kelp bed to rest. It was also adjacent to Luna’s room. The neighboring lounge with the puffy chair Luna would always sit in and read him stories to help him understand human language, regardless of his being unable to speak it back. Luna wasn’t waiting for him here, just Red Robes appearing around the corner suddenly—
” She pushed.
, Red Robes—walking to and fro in either direction of the long hallway, with other creatures and humanoids between them, all familiar faces just like Luna, leaving.
it in many ways. It seemed the most crucial moments he could use a reassuring touch was when Harry wasn’t there to offer it to him. Those instances mostly boiled down to his voice.
“Can I see the others?” Slughorn asked as they walked out of sight.
“Yes,” was his simple answer, seeming surprised to be asked. Draco was more surprised he believed him. A part of him knew to. And yet, the confirmation of something he’d desperately wished for, but stopped hoping would ever come, dropped like a rock in his chest rather than lifting a weight off him.
would be a troublesome one.” Rather than a warmer greeting Draco somehow expected given their last emotional exchange—albeit on Draco’s end—Draco was met with a stern, matter of fact expression and neutral, green eyes.
and Luna, his nearest family, for the last time.
“Please, I don’t want to hurt you anymore.”
Neither of their lungs caught fire.
But they never did, Draco was always the one to initiate it and only while eating.
His only plan of action was to use his siren ways. He could only hope it would be as or somewhat effective on humans. It remained to be seen whether Harry thought of him sexually at all—Harry wasn’t

Sending him to the ocean wasn’t something Draco would call freedom, when it was the one place he’d left intending to never return. Draco would rather go back to the Troupe and be with Luna, but he was not foolish enough to believe any of the place was left besides a building, empty of anyone
The next day Draco waited for Harry right outside the door, startling him a bit.
But the wall closed up as usual. With both of them still outside it, staring at a rough rockface of uninterrupted stone. Nothing happened as they waited.
More startling, Draco got the impression the man
“…consequences of arousal potions...”
But that was the point. Having just because you
These humans who watched him but did not interact, mostly came in and out of doors within a hallway outside his water filled container. They observed him from a window that made up an entire wall of his tank on one of its longer sides—the three remaining walls were as white as the uniforms they wore. They wrote on boards stacked thick with paper, and conversed with each other as they moved back and forth through the long hall. A hall which, as far as Draco could see, held no visible creatures further down it besides himself.
And then she had to. The men gently took her away from Draco, who couldn’t hoist himself and his heavy tail up the side of his pool’s rim fast enough. Long hair swaying, she was marched off between the red robes as she looked over her shoulder at him with a smile probably meant to be comforting.
Draco shut his mouth, swallowing, and waited. For a second, neither moved.
The expression of the other man—
Harry approached him, missing the regal red robes of days ago, and dressed casually in shorts and a shirt that left little to the imagination. Draco ignored his heart hammering excitedly in his chest at finally being interacted with, to give the dishonest man his best glare.
“I’m not saying his expression of rut is natural for sirens, Harry. But it is something they’re supposed to experience to a lesser intensity.” She seemed to hesitate to say the rest, as if Harry might take it poorly. “This might not be something we can cure, if for example—it’s a biological or sexual dysfunction-”
sit with the emeralds and jade so...” Harry looked up at him meaningfully. Draco tutted from where he hovered midair as his wand cast uninterrupted.
The sharp teeth parted a little so a tongue could lazily slip out, as it dozed.
Draco’s hands had started twitching without his notice. For a moment, he was certain he was in a dream gone wrong, recalling all the different creatures he’d known for so long disappear before his very eyes past his different tanks and tunnels, as more and more red robes came to take them. And Draco still didn’t know where he was going.
Draco grabbed his hand. And breathed.
And then he pulled back, waiting for Harry’s answer.
Draco faced forward, saying the words to renew the wards, sealing up the cave for good. And the opening started to disappear.
But he couldn’t figure
Harry began to leave, making his way to the door.
Draco glanced at him, noticing the three thick golden bands wrapped around the tips of each of his ears. To which, he gave Harry a small approving smile.
Draco would-if-he-could, say the same thing back to him. As it was, he kept eating the fish Harry held out for him. So began a pattern, Harry, exasperated but intrigued, would hand Draco each fish, who would chew it in his hands, until he risked biting Harry’s with what little there was left of that particular fish.
Draco might have rolled his eyes, if he wasn’t actually distracted by his realization of the man’s surprising talkativeness. Gone was his cold aloofness of the other day post-show, almost as if he was an altogether different person. It reminded him a bit of Luna actually, and he felt himself relaxing. Then again, he had cried in the man’s arms, that warranted
It had only been an hour and a half since Draco had started talking to Narcissa. Harry had taken the opportunity to leave the flat. Both to give the mother and son some space
It was well and good for a few hours.
“I’ll see you again tomorrow, alright?”
He didn’t care. He just wanted Luna back.
Because she knew he would have someone else.
Before he could make a questioning gesture, she succeeded where Slughorn failed, hugging Draco tightly to her. Rather than the safety and comfort it provided him on many occasions before, he didn’t know why her gripping him so tightly frightened him instead.
Before Draco could summon the last of his energy to request the opposite, Harry was leaving.
“His temperature is elevating dangerously again.” Her words seemed to summon the worst of it, as Draco felt another sharp stab of pain. Draco grabbed Harry by the shirt and pressed himself to him even closer, desperately looking up at him, while he still had a mind to convey what he needed.
“She’s back with the fae now.”
After the last particularly stubborn pumpkin vine joined the pile next to her, she tilted her head at him thoughtfully.
Initially, ever since the first meal, the human didn’t talk much at all, just watched Draco eat, which suited Draco fine. Silent company was still company, simply better than nothing. So Draco would relax with the familiar sensation of having someone to eat with. Harry’s eyes being fixed on Draco the whole while also heartened him.
Learning about Harry was fascinating. He turned out to be a young veteran to a war Draco had no prior knowledge of. And when he wasn’t working at the center, he was a reserve for the Aurors—the red robed individuals—when they dealt with cases involving captivity and trafficking of magical creatures. Though he was rarely called into action it seemed.
He sang his grief and longing until they had turned into the same melody. And eventually, the song merely became Harry’s name in siren tongue, said over and over, the sweetest melody that Draco could sing to himself to pass his remaining days. A song of
He found himself standing at the display with rows of mostly golden vials including the hair dye. Quite a few potions could take on golden tones. Maybe the color was favored by magic as it was by dragons. Luckily, Draco had
Today Draco would begin with the basics: food.
When Draco had naively ventured into the human world in search of food and the vainer hope of friendship amongst land dwellers who couldn’t understand him, he’d never expected to be caught while in human appearance, or end up anywhere like the
“Which we can do nothing about with so little that we know of siren’s biology,” Harry bit out.
He also was amazingly skilled at a flying broom game called Quidditch. His position of choice was seeker, someone who apparently flew amazingly fast from what Draco understood. Draco started to think of Harry like he would the phoenix, a creature similarly destined to conquer the skies, and liked the image he made.
This news didn’t change anything. Draco still didn’t eat any of his meals, even if he knew he was hurting himself going without food for so long. And he’d make it known until whoever observed him couldn’t ignore it.
to have everyone transfixed and stupidly salivating for him like always-
-were so very green and lost to anything else save for Draco.
Draco couldn’t go completely back to normal until he was mated. Why was that so hard to understand? But telling that to these humans proved an impossible task.
“Goodbye you two. It’s been a wondrous seven years together I will never forget. I wish you the best. And you both will always be my favorites!” His parting announcement was met with Luna’s friendly waving, while Draco stayed where he was, unmoved.
than he had in his entire life. That ball of stubborn worry always inside himself vanished entirely. He was in complete harmony and completely comforted. Harry must have felt something too by the way his body suddenly slumped against him.
“Obviously, it can’t be the potions. Sorry Otter, the timeline for their exiting his system and the onset of his condition just doesn’t work for that. And we’ve checked everything else… every presence of a known pheromone that could make him hot and bothered… except
?” Slughorn’s voice rose, affronted. “Because setting them out back in the wild for nature to take its course and kill them so they can be featured in a museum as bones is so much more humane!?” Slughorn’s face became redder than Draco had ever seen it, the more he spoke.
they needed someone for the one act, and Draco was
Without Luna, he would have
Draco made a sound of pain, and unable to obscure it from Harry—feeling no need to hide himself from his mate—he lifted his hands.
It was irrational, he knew. And felt somewhat misplaced to miss someone who was still there while still having a friend with unknown whereabouts. But it didn’t stop him from panicking anytime Harry was delayed in his visits to Draco nor his endeavors in making Harry stay as long as possible. Harry had yet to complain.
Draco so badly wished to tell him this revelation and that Draco had come to love him. And to ask if, as a human, Harry felt the same irresistible pull to the other? Could he feel their magic interacting too?
“Now?” Harry asked hopefully.
He felt more tugging on his navel and chest than usual as they reappeared in Diagon alley, in front of a small shop with pink tinted windows and a cheerfully orange door. It belonged to one of Draco’s favorite shops for pre-made potions and tinctures. Ever the potion connoisseur, (a fact Draco loved to rub in Harry’s face but less so these days), he wanted the storerooms in his cavern stocked up with dittany. More than even healers at St. Mungos could put to practical use.
“What they do or don’t, or, what they should or shouldn’t do according to their species, isn’t up to you! That’s the point, Horace!” Harry loomed over a startled Slughorn, the same time an impressive wave of magic rose to bear down on all present, wondrous and terrifying. The danger it posed strangely grounded Draco’s otherwise rapidly whirlpooling thoughts, even more than Luna’s hand which found his and held it tightly.
No one had the brilliant idea to simply serve it
Draco swam in circles around Harry, unbridled with the need to
less expensive to account for birthday gift contributions.
But the cutting sting of being ignored remained; intolerable. And quickly turned into anger.
The appreciation that sung in his chest faltered in the middle of his neck, trapped and fluttering like a bird that forgot to fly mid leap. Draco was still not used to being able to freely use his voice after all. He wanted to pay him back. But with what else, Draco didn’t know.
good at it—for the easily observable fact, musical abilities aside, that Draco was
The hand pulled back and with it, a very familiar silver inlaid collar glinted without a neck inside it, its polished surface reflecting Draco’s own eyes that it had been created to match.
“You understand right?”
“I had bets on the twins, just to see what they’d come up with. But Harry got to you first.”
And when Draco would turn that expression fully on him, it was this moment that Draco always seemed the most foreign. Someone else altogether. It was an expression Harry had seen before elsewhere, and never wanted to see again. More reptile than human, too much like... a man that once went by ‘Riddle’.
“Today is going to be fun weather Draco. Lots of sun and green fields, can’t forget the Zurrydrinkles, of course.” She spoke of sights Draco had never seen and something Draco was sure she’d only known in her odd dreams. Her strange vocabulary entertained Draco compared to how much it disarmed him when they first met. It had been seven years already since, and neither of them looked a day more aged.
Leaving was the challenge.
back, not just Luna, or the werewolf, or the phoenix, but everyone and everything as it had been just this morning. He wished to preserve it. Perhaps, he understood Slughorn’s need to keep them all in the same place after all.
It wasn’t much: coral, sand, and a section of soft seabed, which was leagues less comfortable than the one at the Troupe had been. Somewhere throughout the day, boredom became tiredness and he dozed off.
He also wasn't a dragon animagus, which might have helped him wrap his head around the extent of Draco’s obsession for collecting shiny and pricey things.
At that, Draco stared incredulously at her, burying the urge to laugh. Then they were misunderstanding entirely, and he would be miserably stuck here experiencing an eternal heatwave while the answer was right next to him, stroking his hair. All his ‘state’ needed was Harry’s reciprocation of Draco’s mating song and they could both continue on happily as a mated pair. Can’t they put two and two together? Was their information on siren’s copulation so
Was Harry really that important that he’d never leave Draco?
To him yesterday had been when Harry was panicking about Draco’s mating response. Draco shook his head.
Aside from making Draco’s daily life there at the Rehabilitation Center bearable, the other’s continuous presence didn’t change his reality of loss all that much. He still missed Luna and this place didn’t feel like home. But it was something, nonetheless.
“That’s what you said a week ago. It’s been
Like every other year before, Draco’s comfortable warmth in his dragon hide lulled Harry to sleep swiftly. He almost didn’t want to yet, filled with the same sort of deep calm he associated with a cloudy King’s Cross Station and a familiar old face with twinkling blue eyes offering him a choice. Harry couldn’t be happier with his decision.
days, Hermione. How can this be normal?”
As much as he swam away, just out of Harry’s reach, Draco kept glancing behind him to see Harry’s green eyes pinpoint their focus only on Draco, and him alone, with the determination that would not be refused. Without thinking it, Draco let himself be caught several times. Because more and more as he played with Harry, becoming Harry’s victory felt like a victory of his own too.
Harry lifted up his head to look at him. Anxiety and desire warred in his gaze.
of their attention. Whose gaze was pinning whom down was irrelevant, he only wanted them to see him more. A furor roared in his chest and eyes and head the longer he saw the man still watching him, spreading to the rest of his body, like a wave of heat cresting without ever crashing. Building and building. Draco felt himself become more and more unraveled, succumbing to the pleasure of it. To be listened to. To be seen. Noticed. By those emerald eyes, never impassive or elsewhere again. Under their focus, Draco only wanted to seem…
Harry turned back to Slughorn who winced, preferring being forgotten. “I’m not going to arrest you,” Harry said to Slughorn’s blinking eyes. “But I am referring you to a program for addiction. You need to get a hold of your urges to collect living things… or delve in herbology raising
like he was in pain
Luna had told him in her own way, hadn’t she? There was another message to garner from Luna, a secondary one that Draco only knew to look for from knowing her. For as much as Luna would never return, Draco would also never need her again. And that meant he didn’t need Luna or anyone else to not be alone, because he’d always have Harry.
“But the honor of earning your favour however is all
The uproar in response to their mating, Draco considered highly exaggerated. Their being mates should be the only explanation needed.
“Why react
Draco enjoyed making Harry wait for him too much to be annoyed, making a show of deigning the human with his magnificent presence. If he rehearsed occasionally just how he would pick himself up, out of the water and saunter his way over to Harry, that only showed how dedicated he was to knock the human down a peg.
him for anything, not anything as direct as entertainment anyway. The only thing Draco could give them credit for was being subtle with their intentions.
Draco blinked in shock. Draco had heard how heatwaves, especially firsts, could knock siren’s out, but those were especially rare—and only if the mating bond was especially strong. But Harry, as a human, must experience it quite differently.
And without planning to, Draco found himself smiling stupidly back at him.
“Let’s get some fresh air.”
As an avid quidditch player, Harry was no stranger to heights. But that was on a broom. He didn’t see why Draco had to stack it so high.
And like he was dreaming; Draco saw Harry come through it, hair disheveled and green eyes rimmed with red. Even then he did not stop, sure he would wake if the song ended—not even when Harry spoke.
,” Draco answered before the swoop of apparition took them both.
“Having a creature expose itself indecently to an audience is psychologically harmful. It
And that was okay, Draco thought. It is as it should be.
“Let’s go,” Draco announced, pulling him by the arm to side-along.
Was this the supposed freedom Harry had promised? So far, at least in terms of being caged up and being fed, it was little different from his treatment with Slughorn, and the fish he was being
That said, Draco still stared at him, wondering about his purpose here.
This wasn’t working. If he were to go about this right, rather than air, Draco ought to smell him in the water where his nose could really capture Harry’s smell.
And what was a
Draco knew he was being teased in part. But thinking about all the keepers that attempted to best him, he had to agree. They had been alarmingly adamant about it. If being smacked with fish was an enjoyable human pastime, Draco had been bored enough to happily use them as target practice.
rather than created an extra allotted time to spend with him separately. He was better off with Harry as is. Still, Draco got the impression, that those humans in white suits (who had made a reappearance since his positive reception of Harry) did not actually approve of Harry’s meal-delivery-turned-social-visits with Draco, but their disapproving stares from the other side of the glass might have been his imagination.
Harry wasn’t much into piercings himself. And it felt kind of funny anyway. He’d been told the holes would completely heal up once he’d take them out. So that was good.
The pang of grief overflowed in a splash of sound. Out his mouth. And he froze, startled at being in the wrong place—the wrong stage to do so, when another upset noise followed in response to his confusion—croaky and weak.
“We’ll see each other again someday. Not in this world.” She smiled again, only this time brighter. “But when a Rowling pens a red rock.”
“I’m sorry, but it’s time for me to go.” His hands were firm but gentle as he guided Draco off him. Draco was too stunned with his own body’s responses to the touch. As he the final piece came together why his reactions to Harry’s touches had always been more intense and robbing him of sense than Luna’s had been.
A fish smacking against the man’s back got his attention. Startled, the redhead turned around only to face a volley of dead fish Draco hurled violently at him, flashing his teeth and scales aggressively all the while. Once he’d emptied his arms, Draco sneered at the dumbfounded man. Sliding out the water the rest of the way, Draco began to hiss and drag himself toward him, ready to toss the same fish scattered on the ground all over again, causing the red-head to scurry away and shut the door behind him.
As he dodged and dove deeper into his pool, he realized he wanted them
And he promised himself, no matter how long it took, he would never eat again until he saw him. And he kept that promise for six more days.
“Sorry,” He rubbed the back of his head, but Draco didn’t buy he was guilty for a second, not when he still had that smile on. “Nutritional potions as part of your medicine had to be given to you. I didn’t throw it into the water for you to drink if that’s what you’re nervous for. Just from a bottle. That’s what you like at any rate,” He smirked.
Realizing that his own voice working normally scared him almost broke him. The everyday sounds within himself that he’d been so used to being silenced were now much too loud and abrupt for his ears. It pained him how unnatural his own day to day voice had become to him. The too light weight of the kelp band that poorly substituted his old silver collar only worsened the sensation of wrongness. Draco had developed a habit of touching his own neck periodically and not relaxing until he’d circled it with his hand.
“I would’ve thought,” Harry spoke again, low and cutting, “you learned your lesson the
He had short red hair and blue eyes, and his relaxed face seemed friendly enough. And when Draco swam up to the edge to look closer at him, he was the first to actually wave and greet Draco. The generous muscles on his arms stood out as he worked on some pipes leading into the tank. He wasn’t bad on the eyes and he left Draco well-enough alone, rather than taking notes on him and every minor action of his.
Then he turned away, swimming to the center and bottom of his tank, and sat there, staring off into nothing.
And he didn’t give them a chance as the music started playing.
It’s no wonder Draco had been hit so hard so abruptly.
And beckoned Harry over to his own final one next to him. Harry climbed further up it, taking Draco’s hand to get up the rest of the way. It was a good 10 feet off the ground.
“Right,” Harry muttered, pretending he at all understood what that meant. Trying to follow a dragon’s latest justification for relocation was a losing game. A lesson he’d learned enough.
It was guarded as much as Draco’s animagus ability from public knowledge. Maintaining secrecy was necessary. For all that a dragon animagus would make any witch or wizard a celebrity, an ex-death eater capable of assuming the form of a fire-breathing dragon did not paint a reassuring picture to many.
Draco stared at it critically, raising himself and his broom higher. “Not quite.”
Some of the fulfilled gifts were ridiculously expensive
He no longer felt embarrassment baring his slit to anyone who would look. All manner of humans  had seen it. Draco was only an object to them. But as much as they could look, he bore the one dignity that they’d never be able to touch it; not while he was under the Master’s care and good favor. And he wouldn’t start disappointing now.
and Harry’s voice broke into Draco’s thoughts, into his song.
After devouring the first fish, he did the same with the others, ignoring any Harry wasn’t directly holding and only eating what Harry gave him. For the second hand-fed fish, as soon as Harry would try to let go of it, Draco would stop eating, disrupting all Harry’s attempts to make him eat by himself until Harry gave in.
“At least, let me say goodbye to them?” Slughorn phrased only the end of it as a question, probably realizing he held little leg room for requests.
Draco slowly ascended, taking his time to slide his head out of the water up to where she knelt over the edge, not bothering to change his expression to a friendlier one at his serially whimsical friend. Her blonde hair looked as tangled in strange objects as ever—tiny pumpkins this time—that did nothing for either improving or worsening his mood, which stayed sour.
off in his own territory, to share with Harry, his mate
The only company he had to speak of were certain individuals dressed in blue shirts and shorts that would come through a door on the floor above his tank to clean the ceiling and surrounding walls with their wands. Or at least, that was the only thing Draco caught them doing. Draco watched them curiously above the water’s surface, but they didn’t heed him any. Draco eventually returned to examining the finer decorations of his new tank instead.
Noticing Draco’s relaxing, he laughed.
All his energy and appetite he lost seemingly overnight.
Still, since those interactions, no keepers or cleaners would even come near him now. The humans in white coats that once stood in front of his tank’s glass wall were strangely absent as well, as if Draco’s aggression to the ones that fed him had made them vanish also. Though he thought he saw a few sneakily leaving the window to his tank when he woke up after a nap once.
“What’s the point of getting all this stuff—” Harry took out the last earring and set it in Draco’s waiting palm along with the gold armbands—“If we’re never going to see it again.”
“We’ll see it next year,” Draco said simply while Harry eyed the forlorn, untouched wood and bristles.
together was not lost on Draco. The combination of the heady aroma and glee was steadily getting to his head as he chased Harry and Harry chased him round and round, endlessly till he was sure he’d reach a delirium of joy he could not return from.
day a year.”
He didn’t know how long he sat there for, with the dangerous feeling that nothing mattered anymore. He’d lost Luna, but then he’d had Harry. But apparently, Luna had been wrong… because Harry was leaving him too. He was being abandoned and
for her…
He still remembered the first days when he used to come on stage singing his heart out, hopeful and desperately wishing someone would be moved enough by his voice to rescue him. But of course, even if they could have understood his song’s pleas, the kinds of humans that attend these sorts of things had no such interests except to enslave him for themselves. He was better off where he was.
Hermione cleared her throat and looked over a page in front of her. “It’s well known that Sirens experience seasonal rut once every seven years. After four days of this, they will settle with or without a mating encounter, and resume as normal. During this time, their body temperatures rise to a high degree but it doesn’t affect their functioning, except in rare cases. Their magical cores also increase in activity, which is theorized as the main cause behind the heat increase they experience. We don’t know enough about the mechanism within sirens that’s meant to cool down after a rut. Whatever it is, in Draco we can assume it’s malfunctioned in some way and isn’t working properly to reorient himself and his rut fully.”
year, Harry.” Draco shook his head at him. Turning away, he resituated the bejeweled chandelier (a gift from his parents) for the tenth time in one minute. “The dragon has moved on from that arrangement.”
Draco had the gut feeling he didn’t want to meet these twins, despite Charlie’s eyes softening at mentioning them. He reached down and grabbed something in a wrapper which smelled like food—which had Draco’s shoulders instinctually rising defensively—but it turned out to be for himself and not Draco as he unwrapped and bit into something crunchy that smelled but looked nothing like fish.
And then it was a torrent as his voice broke out into all of his emotions of loss, fear and mourning.
After all this time, he’d come to like Slughorn as much as one could their captor who had otherwise been gentle and friendly to them. A kind owner who also thought so
Harry’s favorite reading material of course were the Quidditch magazines he would sometimes bring while keeping Draco company at lunch, which Draco disliked immensely at first, hard put to tolerate any distraction from himself when this was the only time for interaction Draco had all day. Still, Draco didn’t mind the pages full of pictures when Harry was actively pointing things out in it to better explain Quidditch to him. Nor did they ever consume the entirety of Harry’s attention away from him, often forgotten and put aside by the time Draco was a third of the way into his meal.
“Or that possibility,” Hermione admitted, a little snippily. “But we’ve ruled out all variables it could be: his diet, water in his tank, a magical malady, and screened for any of the Arousal Ambrosia Slughorn had been regularly giving him.”
An enraged sound brought Draco back to the present—to Harry grabbing Horace by the collar and staring him down with unwithheld contempt.
“Sorry.” Harry shoved the door shut behind him. He set the package he’d intercepted from their owl on the table for Draco to sort out.
But Draco gave gifts as good as he was given in return during the holidays. Christmas was a whole other complicated event. Fun, but fatiguing.
would have been alleviated easily enough with some mating action. But, Draco worryingly could not recall any interest or satisfaction on Harry’s part when Draco clearly revealed the human’s significance to him. Without direct communication, Draco isn’t sure how he could put it more plainly.
, mate.”
“Yes,” Harry glanced over the list even as he saw Draco do the same with his own copy.
So there, he decided to remain for as long as he could.
Harry turned toward him.
“Funny...” Harry’s eyes narrowed on Draco. “I don’t remember seeing you having to eat out of people’s hands.”
When he peeked back above the water a few seconds later, rather than revulsion, he found the other laughing uncontrollably, as he called for Draco between gasps.
But unlike the cave, he actually took something—
From his lenient pose, the man sitting on the chair next to him and reading a book didn’t seem to hold any grudges for the thrown fish. If anything, when he saw Draco was up, he smiled warmly, just as he had the first day Draco met him. Draco almost believed he’d confused him with someone else—there were many people at the center with red hair—until he spoke.
Unfortunately, it did not seem everyone agreed with such simple answers.
“But he’s been off it for two months,” a voice that sounded like Hermione’s interceded.
Harry didn’t look cheered at all.
“I have to go,” Harry whispered gently, sounding reluctant even as he did.
Finally, the two were
With their hands entwined, their fingers tightened, warm and certain. They left, taking only what was most precious with them back home.
The trembling worsened.
“So you’re saying it’s permanently just coming and going? So hot that his brain melts?” Harry asked, sounding frustrated. “How’s any of that natural?”
Still, liquid gold had to have an allure all its own.
intended to be a permanent place for him. Draco should be grateful for this, but it was quickly overshadowed by fears of being sent back to the sea. These humans that thought they were doing what was best for him—just like Slughorn—had no way of knowing just how badly he wished not to go back there. There was no doubt in Draco’s mind they would not let him stay here to live amongst them in the human world, no matter how much he fought and shouted.
But when Harry’s green eyes met his, Draco could only moan softly, helpless to communicate anything as he was swept up by mating heat.
And because Luna had always been
“Or think of all the salmon and swordfish after.” Her smile was warm, but tired too as she made quick work of putting on his jewelry and checking the magical timer on his collar. Looking him over and seeing everything was in place, she lightly drummed her fingers on his forehead—her usual
—and rolled back on her heels to stand, regarding him affectionately.
Draco opened his mouth to sing again, but without any magical power to enthrall behind it—to
It wasn’t a ‘rut’ or whatever strange human notion Harry had given it, unless that meant: perfectly natural reaction to the presence of your mate and their courtship. The ‘heatwave’ was a consequence of sirens discovering their mate. Draco just hadn’t expected to present with it so soon. Perhaps without realizing it, he’d mistakenly thought there’d be a lesser reaction within himself to a human mate. Evidenced by Harry’s huge effect on Draco, he couldn’t have been more wrong.
“We don’t know how long Draco will stay out of rut. Rut is meant to be a natural experience for sirens.” Hermione said slowly. “We’ll just have to keep that in mind about our plans to release him,
“Oh right! How stupid of me. Your friend, er… Luna wasn’t it?” Harry shook his head at himself before facing Draco again.
But the simplest answer was also often the most disappointing. Draco wished he’d been telling the truth.
understand—
Hermione frowned as she glanced at him.
Blinking, Harry slowly picked it up again, staring at him all throughout his action. Draco didn’t care if the other thought him odd for it, having just discovered he quite liked this new manner of eating. And evidently Harry, despite his initial pause, was still willing to try again.
All faces turned their attention toward him, Hermione with disbelief, and Harry, with something like hope that matched Draco’s own.
“Sorry Draco, I’ll be back to congratulate you more later,” He called over his shoulder as he went. “You’ll have more free time next week, be sure of it!” Draco received this promise of respite with a nod and smile, and mixed emotions beneath it.
“I’ll need you to come with us, Miss.” One instructed.
“You’re really attached, aren’t you?” Harry, who still hadn’t lifted Draco off him, turned his head to the side to smile over at him.
“Yes—NOT
Draco wasn’t necessarily keen on this development.
“Draco wants to be with me.”
“She was right,” Harry said thoughtfully, letting his head fall back and stare up at the sky. Draco glanced at him curiously.
day after all. For whatever reason, Draco refused to buy things the days immediately before it. And he'd declined Harry’s offers to pay for him until Harry stopped asking altogether.
Harry’s voice carried a questioning tone but Draco didn’t completely hear the words, too far gone to translate human speech at the moment.
“I’m sorry, I only meant… I only wished to save them all. But I know you’re going to take them and I can’t- I cannot…” He struggled for words, and when none came, all of his control seemed to crumble as his face broke into tearful pleads.
Draco, weakened from periods of not eating, still made his way over as quickly as he could once he noticed him, overjoyed after not having seen him in so long.
, Harry.”
. Harry was grateful he only had to wear gold today. And nothing beyond the few piercings and armbands they'd discussed.
bye, Draco.” She smiled at him, tapping her fingers on his forehead. “Our playtime here and together is done.”
While he was distracted by it, Luna gave Draco’s hand a brief squeeze. And it was all the warning he had before she abruptly stood up, making her way towards the clearly more powerful of the two wizards, and away from him.
Despite his obvious concern for Draco, Harry listened.
He wondered how long he could keep it up. In the ocean, he’d gone for quite a while on very little. It must have been nearly four days already with Draco not eating. This morning he decided to lay at the edge of the pool outside it to sunbathe—considering what it was like to be a plant who only needed sun and water; there’d be no way to lob sunshine at him crassly for one—when he saw a familiar face.
Like a man possessed, he rounded on Draco, the last of his sentence dying on his lips as he smashed them against Draco’s, “-
be hurting him, but saving him all over again.
“You’ve flustered him,” Draco said, before leaning in toward the witch over the counter.
It’s in that moment, Draco felt an unparalleled gratitude towards Harry, for being there with him as his friend—twice now while he cried, and for saving him even if it meant Luna had to be taken away. Deep down, he hadn’t wanted to stay there, and she had known that too. It had been the same for her. As much as they wished to keep together, staying there wouldn’t have been worth it.
Just like the sirens' courtships of old, they practically revolved around each other, chasing back and forth. Looking back, Draco should have been more careful in his excitement to be with Harry.
“You’re awfully happy today,” Harry noted as he sat in the unfolded seat. If only Harry knew for what a glorious reason that was.
Like all his prior visits, the affable witch gave Harry a knowing smile as they left. The kind that knew exactly what the customer wanted even more than they themselves ever did.
He sobbed like he hadn’t since he was a young child, face buried in his hands as he let the world he knew fully fall apart in his mind like it already had around him.
The voice of the Master resonated through the room, speaking the thousandth reiteration of the same unchanged script that Draco knew better than his own voice. “Now for all you lovely ladies and gents, we’re ready to show you what you’ve all been waiting for! Introducing… our favorite platinum haired sea dragon… the mercurial last siren of the Seven Seas, the handsome, man -eating,
He’d certainly been more expressive when Draco had been singing to him.
Harry, for his part, always bided his time setting up next to Draco, letting Draco be the one to approach him first.
With growing disbelief, he stared down at his slowly parting slit, that needed no arousal potions to have functioned in such a way. The combination of magic and physical contact had done strange things to Draco, in a way that was only supposed to happen to sirens in more intimate arrangements. The more he thought about it, the more it incentivized him to face the obvious—that Draco thought he’d never have with so few sirens left in the sea.
The response was instant and brilliant. For once in his life, Draco felt whole and more
“Sorry, buddy,” Charlie said, looking guilty. “It’s just me, today.”
Harry offered him a fish then—cold scales on a warm palm.
Anger sated, but stomach not, he ignored the latter for the salient taste of victory. Still, he mulled over his current situation that so far had dashed any positive expectations he’d been left by the “
A group of seven people talked in a circle next to him, with Hermione and Harry butting heads. Draco was beginning to think he was a major point of contention between them. Charlie, who was surprisingly the least vocal amongst them, seemed to silently contemplate everything being said. The other faces Draco had seen before but he had no names to give them.
Harry sighed as he dutifully slid off from his perch above the pile of green gems—that last time Draco had insisted would bring out his eyes best. He had figured that would be a ‘safe spot’ where he wouldn’t have to inevitably change positions so soon.
He didn’t wonder why it was him and not another red robe to approach him. Perhaps Harry wanted to rub it in, that the only one who had been really defeated today had been Draco after all. Whatever feelings of triumph Draco had held over the man earlier today seemed like a joke. Rather than just another human rendered mute under his song’s influence, this one had been the one responsible for why his residence and one friend had said goodbye to him for good.
A sea of mesmerized, upturned faces greeted him as he swam into the middle of his stage, above the large trident pointing toward him rising from the ground. It would act as his anchor point throughout his act.
His fourth tank, the show stage, and his last area he would be able to check. He found no one there either. Luna was gone. There were no more familiar faces in the audience, only red robes in the pews, taking measurements and levitating and packing things that didn’t belong to them. The trident stood tall in the face of everything but offered Draco no more real refuge than it ever had. It and his song on this stage never once saved him. And the crystal-clear water, designed to make him as visible as possible, didn’t start to hide him from the uninvited audience now. Even more Red Robes congregated and pointed their sticks at him. Draco swam away while he could.
he wanted as much as the fact that he wanted something.
Harry put his hand up against it as well, smiling, but then faltered, pulling it away.
The toothy  maw made a content, crooning sound, flicking its tongue at Harry. The dragon
“Don’t get too used to it,” Harry said, gruffly, slinging the empty buckets over his broad shoulders.
Weakly, he lifted his arms up at Harry, to pull him toward him.
She understood anyway.
Before he could analyze it much further, Harry lightly but more insistently pushed at his shoulders.
Of all the things that had occurred to him today,
Harry had yet to buy anything himself there or acknowledge it.
But Charlie returned again for the next meal, which Draco received the same, refusing it all together. And Charlie didn’t push him to, merely giving him a sad smile and leaving again.
Because Draco’s one motivation hadn’t changed—even after all these years a pampered captive in the human world—the same reason why he had even bothered to come here to the human world in the first place.
it. His body trembled a little as Draco shut his eyes. He couldn’t look directly at Harry too long, or the heatwave might come back again. He didn’t know if just seeing Harry was enough, but he wouldn’t chance it. When he opened his eyes again, he saw Charlie looking his way, lost in thought.
Draco needed her to tell him how to keep her.
His presence remained a welcome distraction as Draco openly stared at his pert behind from underwater, consideringly. A human being the one to inadvertently give him a show for once entertained him for quite a while. And it allowed his mind to take a break from processing the stark change of his location.
“Why are you putting up so much of a fight?” he asked.
But this obsession with physical contact had as much to do with the fact that he enjoyed it as he
Also he had the unfortunate realization that his body had embarrassingly gotten used to human attention, specifically of the sexual kind. And he was now in a setting where he wouldn’t have that either. His habit to sexually stimulate himself didn’t go away just because he was out of the Troupe. So more and more often, out of sheer lack of anything better to do for the most part, he found himself touching his intimate areas passingly. Of course, without a potion to induce arousal or the call of a discovered mate, he could never become aroused more than a slight itch. His member could never slip out his slit more than a peek, which only added to his already pressing frustrations.
But it was clearly something Draco was keen on doing more often, once most of his inhibitions were out of the way.
“Marvelous work today, Draco! You’ve outdone yourself my boy!” The man’s stomach was the only thing bigger than his jolly laugh as he pat Draco’s shoulder with un-withheld pride. It was hardly a secret that Draco was his favorite to show off. And Draco’s collar conveniently permitted him to speak for the short while he had Slughorn’s attention after-shows, but he couldn’t speak in human tongue either way.
Harry let himself be steered toward the door without complaint. Today was less about taking his usual half of the reins for their schedule, and more about following along with Draco’s needs which only Draco could lead.
A silver dragon, wings flaring and neck stretched high, towered in his place. Nothing the size of the giant Hungarian Horn-tail that Harry had to flee at the Triwizard tournament, but
Draco’s peculiar perfectionism was less entertaining while it was ordering him around. Not to mention Draco’s advantage of being on a broom to move things while Harry, who hadn’t had the foresight to bring his, was stuck following his instructions from the ground. Harry doubted he was helping much more than if Draco had done it himself. Though, Draco didn’t seem to know
She had said it as if she knew. Because she had.
With greater satisfaction than he had experienced in a long time, he made for the exit.
More and more of the remaining packages got stacked and shrunk to fit into the overflowing trunk, layered with cushioning charms. The quill's furious scribbling filled the room as it hastily wrote down the final names by their associated gifts for the Thank You cards. Draco, with Harry's help, would be owling them out tomorrow.
Draco passed the time in Charlie’s company listening to the man talk about everything from the weather to his many brothers and one sister—and how Draco ought to meet them--until the other’s shift watching him was over, and Draco was left alone but happy at their interaction ending without any hostility.
“Well, why don’t we go over what we know?” A woman whose hair he could have sworn was blonde a moment ago, but pink now, interjected into the quiet of the room.
Draco reached for Harry, who put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. He felt moving his limbs came a little harder to him, but didn’t mind it. He was more content with Harry’s hands on his skin again.
to get something off his own list for Draco done.
The following days, Draco refused his meals and stayed sullenly at the bottom of his tank. He hated these new humans who wouldn’t interact with him at all, ignoring the part that was his fault for doing his best to scare them away. Food seemed much less important than his wishes to be back with Luna, and even Slughorn.
Draco, blinking, nodded at her.
Draco had little time to process that before Slughorn had rounded on the taller man.
The dragon suddenly reared up, beginning a series of rumbles growing louder and louder that were the prelude to its full territorial roar.
Draco raised his eyebrows with an innocent look and no explanation, pointedly waiting for him to offer the next fish to Draco’s waiting mouth. Regardless of his clear suspicion, Harry obliged, surprisingly obedient. Not that Draco hadn’t appreciated the moments Harry defied him during their very first interactions
She gently guided Harry away from him. Which Draco vocally protested. But as usual,
Despite his obvious expression and hiss of warning, Harry casually sat across from Draco with the bucket of fish next to him. And
to allure their owner’s very soul. His voice burst out wanton and savage in his native tongue.

This was something only Draco owned, not managed by goblins. It was a wonder Malfoy bothered with having a Gringotts vault at all.
He climbed to sit on the gold pieces on the top of the mound, which was somehow less comfortable than the geometrically-cut gems he left further below it. But nothing worth griping about.
“His core temperature is back to 36 Degrees Celsius,” a plain voice said, followed by multiple sounds of relief.
Fifth and final tank, back to where he started. He had come back to where he had begun the day, thinking it would be the same as every other—
.” Draco’s arm wrapped over Harry’s shoulders, giving Harry a short peck on the mouth. Kisses weren’t something Draco would normally do without some sort of build up to it like sex. Or some special occasion.
This year, in addition to all of that, he also wanted Harry to be adorned in gold armbands underneath his clothes, where it couldn’t be seen. And when asked why, “
Harry glanced down at Draco, his grin infectious and captivating. Draco returned it just as brightly.
, he slowly made his way over—only to impulsively eat it straight out of Harry’s hand instead of his own. Before Draco could fully process the brief and
He went to sleep on an empty stomach and with an even emptier chest that night.
Draco didn’t wait for them to grab him too. Quickly, he reversed his direction, going back the way he came, made easier by the slippery trail of water he left behind when coming from it. He strained his arms until the footsteps behind him couldn’t make it in time to catch his tail as it slid back into the pool. He didn’t even bother looking back to see what they would do to pursue him.
Through his watery eyes, even amongst the release of both recent and buried emotions, he could see the other look like he didn’t know what to do with his hands or Draco, despite his soft verbal reassurances. Eventually he had enough sense to put them on Draco.
Because it was in his hand (not on the floor or the water or left in a bucket) and he
“You’re free,” Harry said, wording the obvious as if it would sink into him faster to garner the appropriate response, like jumping for joy or hugging his rescuers. Draco was supposed to be. In all his dreams of escape, he had. But those had been just that,
that day.
Moments like these were where Luna was completely wrong on something. He did need Luna for immediate advice on something he knew nothing about.
Outside the cave, there wouldn’t be another opportunity to show Draco, since all gifted objects had to remain behind after his dragon claimed it for his horde. Draco liked the earrings and that was good enough.
It’s like you said, we know so little of siren’s biology and habits. As they are severely understudied, how do we even know what we do have is right?” He patted the book in his hand, that Draco had seen him reading earlier.
right, thanks,” Harry replied intelligently, aware of his earrings’ existence again as he saw her own large, starry bangles, many rings, and huge-beaded necklaces. “Nice to see lots on you too.”
He began his tried and true performance, that wizards and witches of high wealth paid gallons of galleons to attend. Starting slow, he merely gyrated his hips and swam in lazy perfect circles while splashes of color were summoned to the left and right of him, to accentuate his dance’s sensuality all the more.
______________
At the time, Draco’s, or rather, the dragon’s restlessness had been as contagious as Dragon Pox. And Harry hadn’t seen the point in staying put if it wasn’t his final placement anyway.
Draco should have thanked him then too.
” It was the most passionate Draco had ever witnessed Harry’s friend.
In a similar vein, Draco had added golden piercings on his list a month ago and asked if Harry would ever wear them. So Harry ended up saying yes and getting a few without even thinking about it. Just because Draco requested it and Harry could.
Draco turned up his nose at him, tail flicking water, unimpressed. He was plenty experienced with near starvation if it had to come to it.
Harry nodded, instinctively straightening himself.
“And where is my lovely siren?” When Slughorn approached him with clear intentions to embrace him as well, Draco coldly turned away and swam further out, just enough to keep beyond his reach.
The effects of the potion he drank before the show slowly pulsed deeper and deeper within him, with every swimming stroke and flip of his body, as he chased his own tail around the trident set in the center of the stage. The audience didn’t know its significance yet, but they would soon.
He alternated between acrobatic flipping stunts and swimming in swerving patterns that exaggerated the length of his tail and the flexibility of his body, that further inspired their lust’s imaginations.
Draco couldn’t understand. Nor ask what she meant. His throat worked frantically, but nothing could make it past the collar keeping him painfully silent.
But just like that, their eye contact must end as well. The curtain gently swept closed on his tank as he watched the other disappear. And so ended his audience with the green eyed gem, a specimen of a human Draco could bear to look at and actually want to impress.
“Thank you, Harry. It won’t happen again,” Slughorn promised profusely.
She nodded back. “Good. But just in case, I’ll give you a brief summary of what we know of what’s going on with you. You’ve experienced an intense first rut, where you were coming in and out of consciousness for the last nine days. Do you remember any of this?”
“-Don’t yet. He’s in shock,” He heard someone say, an echo from nearby.
Rolling up the parchment and stepping out of the cave was the easy part.
Draco had tried explaining it to him last year: “
“He’s responding to someone here, because just like us, he can have the
Draco waited for Harry to set up the bucket, only to grab his wrist to gently stop his hand from reaching inside it and getting his scent contaminated.
A long silence ensued between the seething man and the cowed one, as the dense cloud of oppressive magic lingered, flooding the vacuum of unspoken words and poised itself to react with violence. Draco could even feel it enter his lungs as he breathed in. And some of it remained burrowed in his throat as he exhaled, a thread of it winding itself deeper toward his own muffled magic’s center. His inner song stirred in response.
He descended back into his water, meal untouched.
He held onto the thought that he was luckier than most, certainly more than the other sirens that no longer existed. Even counting his blessings, receiving his choice meal and so called ‘treats’ over and over again felt less like the reward that Slughorn meant it to be, and more a necessary chore to satiate his terrible hunger after wasting so much magic and energy into his endlessly requested songs.
After an hour or so of hard work that had him all sweaty—really he should just join Draco in the cool water—he left to go elsewhere with another wave that Draco returned. Draco remained content with dozing off.
—out of Gringotts. So it was far from being obsolete.
In all his red robed glory, the man descended and dismounted off a flying broom to stand a few feet away and stare at Draco, who remained at the bottom of his pool of vanished water save for the tiny inch of puddle he sat in, where he watched the ceiling’s reflection. His safe place turned into a bowl with high walls that had no way of escape.
Above him, the ceiling was decorated with lifelike paintings of clouds that slowly moved in a soft breeze. If he stared too long, he began to feel the breeze himself. Looking around, he found himself suspended and floating on the surface of a tank, filled with unnaturally still, water laced with magic.
salary Harry made as an Auror, and then some. It had seemed like no one would buy the most extravagant selections on Draco's registry. Given the sheer price alone. That, and who would trouble themselves with hunting down a—rarer than unicorns—Ruby-rhubarb beetle?
But Harry wasn’t alone in the extent of what he’d been willing to gift Draco Malfoy.
And Green eyes.
Harry laid backwards on the gold and waited listlessly. One of the piercings snagged beneath his heavy Auror robes, and he grimaced a bit as he rubbed at it. His small excitement at the idea of Draco’s reaction to them earlier when he got them had already waned.
______________
Just Draco.
It was foreboding to have to relearn his mouth making simple sounds he’d taken for granted that now seemed so loud in what used to be silence: gasps, groans, moans, yawns, snorts, laughs, and all emotive noises in between. He only forgot to notice his voice working if he was too captured up in a really strong emotion, such as when he’d attacked the keepers who’d failed to feed him properly. But most daily emotions were weaker bursts of sound that drove him slowly mad.
“Mating a human won’t fulfill you,” Harry whispered. “It won’t work with me. You’ll just suffer.”
That long overdue gratitude came over him in full swing, finally understanding. The impulse to sing filled his lungs and to share this revelation to the world and honor the person who saved him and his best friend, Harry, who was also his friend now.
listened to him.
enough to be that is,” he emphasized, staring across at Draco from behind glasses that made his already prominently green eyes look even larger. “But we need a safe place to release you first. Since most reservations are forest based, you’ll be stuck with us until we find or create an appropriate ocean reserve.”
And what did that mean for Luna’s promise? He hadn’t even considered that Harry might not be the answer. Had he interpreted it wrongly?
Where would
He felt cooler hands place themselves on him that made his body shudder, as he was pulled toward the surface with Harry, where he’d otherwise sink like a rock to the bottom. Taking him to the edge of the tank where they could cling to the rim of the sides, Harry asked him, worry written all over his face.
Overpowered by this desire, he gave the fingers a lick, which had… an interesting effect on their own as Harry’s breath caught, losing his voice mid-sentence. Draco was reminded again, that this man hadn’t been completely immune to Draco’s power over him. And that emboldened him to eat more
Yet nowhere felt safer than by the side of a lethal creature that could kill him with one flaming exhale.
“You’re a strange one,” Harry finally murmured, but his hand finally stayed still for Draco to finish.
Draco nodded, and Harry ruffled his hair again in passing.
with her predictions, Draco deep down had known then he wouldn’t be seeing her again. His faith in her words was why he’d been so adamant in not letting her go. So he shouldn’t be so affected by her promise being fulfilled. But having it confirmed—made real—that she couldn’t return didn’t make it hurt any less.
Draco felt his insides freeze over. For a moment he wished he’d misheard. Or that he could stop understanding Slughorn as the man, who he’d known to only give him compliments and endless accolades for the past seven years, continued on unflatteringly about his mating habits like he’d been talking facts about the weather.
Still, not the kind of minor body-modifying gift contribution Harry would volunteer for again.
His gaping slit and member that stood at full mast were freely exposed for Harry to see. Just Harry looking seemed to make it worse, and it jerked under Harry’s attention.
But it’s just a moment before the animal’s temptations were pushed away by human sanity.
Straining his ears he was able to pick up the noises of people walking by his door, but the footsteps passed it. There was no sign of Harry and anyone else, except the remainder of Harry’s scent in a chair pulled out next to him. Proof that Harry had been there some time ago.
Slughorn twirled to face them, with unbridled fondness and brimming heartache at his impending loss of his precious creatures.
When said stranger began to talk more animatedly, Draco joined her in paying attention to what the two humans were discussing—or more so
Draco appreciated a belated apology over none. In no mood or state to give anyone else grief, he merely nodded his understanding, which earned him another smile from the redhead. He seemed to be a person, like Luna, whose regular expression was a smile and who enjoyed talking. It’s a good thing Harry wasn’t like that, or Draco would be distracted by his smile and voice all the time. Thinking of Harry made him nervous and his body clench for some reason, so Draco focused back on the redhead in front of him.
“Ready?” Draco asked, voice surprisingly steady. There was a shift in him that Harry had begun to recognize. For all his worrying earlier, an unusual confidence seemed to take over Malfoy. The kind that needed no rhyme or reason to assert itself.
“That’s good, Harry,” Draco said, in that pre-dragon manic manner of his. “Now would you please move the antique table? It isn’t catching the light right.”

At least two had to be worth more than the
The rest of the day without Harry was terribly dreary. Draco’s surroundings lacked anything else of remarkable note. Draco sometimes regretted turning away every other human who had applied to be his keeper, even though he was mostly sure that they would have
Finally, when it had to be noon (they’d been there for three hours), Draco took his usual
She and her could only mean Luna. Draco immediately perked up at that, startling Harry—who froze in confusion under Draco’s sudden undivided attention until a realization struck him.
As he fret over this, Draco heard voices again that came up to the doors and entered.
By the time most of the fish were gone, his face lingered above the man’s hands, going slower and slower by the end of it. The need to prolong contact and nearness with someone after being without for so long had him stretching his usual pace. If Harry mistook it for Draco eating slower as he got fuller… well, Draco wasn’t going to correct him.
And just like that, Harry left him without even a goodbye.
stupid and eventually caught on, starting to leave food out for him in a flatter tub when he hadn’t noticed. It wasn’t quite a plate, but Draco could acknowledge this improvement at least. He came out to eat more often.
“Let’s go,” Harry prompted him along. Slughorn hesitated only a moment, giving them one last wistful look, before joining him.
Put more mildly, Draco was being more
And they had turned away from him.
Desperate, Draco sang for him, long and lilting and everything he wanted to say but couldn’t.
The day that had been marked off on their calendar for the past six months of the previous year: Dragon Appreciation Day to muggles and Draco Diem to traditional Wizards—Or as Harry liked to call it,
He had never questioned it before, why no other creature performed a sexual act but himself. Draco hadn’t thought it meant anything, or to think anything of it. That if it wasn’t him, it might have been asked of someone else, a centaur perhaps or some other majestic humanoid creature. That they needed a single act to pull off for that certain audience, and that the possibility he could refuse meant some other might take the position. Beyond those, the decision had simply been about… the need to be useful and not cast aside. But Slughorn had thought he’d say yes because Draco was a
“This is a
Draco was too, that his mate could not want him, could not love him as much as Draco did him, and would not keep Draco. The loss felt like when Luna left him, only
He never thought Draco would answer no because of what he was, and Draco had proved him right by accepting to become such an exhibit. Suddenly all the shows before—every instance he turned himself into an instrument for human’s sexual enjoyment and re-imagined it as a success of his magical abilities—tasted rotten in his mouth. The self-delusion and misplaced pride that despite his imprisonment, taking up this activity wasn’t so humiliating since he’d had a choice meant nothing if no one had believed he could refuse such an offer.
“Well, I’ve got to give it to you. First time in a while I’ve gotten startled by a creature like that.” His muscled arms spread themselves to stretch behind his neck. “Gave my heart a fright, you did. And a good story too.” He leaned forward, whispering a bit conspiratorially. “Surviving a siren’s fish attack is practically a medal of honor around here, you know?”
, hurt the most.
Luna started to weave the pumpkins out of her flowing yellow curls, pausing between several to help him take off his charmed jewelry. The collar of course always remained after the others were lifted. Unlike his adornments, the pumpkins were her own selection.
“We’re stopping by
Taking his cue, Harry laid with him. Draco’s snout carefully positioned itself directly on his belly, snuffling a bit, angled in such a way one of his eyes was staring at Harry’s. Harry stroked his scales, enjoying the texture under his fingers and the rhythmic waves of warm air fanning his face.
-hearted than Harry got to see him for most of the rest of the year.
“Good, everything’s in order.” Draco seemed to be assuring himself, probably checking with his dragon-side. Harry had caught Draco deliberating with himself out loud for the past hour.
Without their voices, he was truly alone.
Harry wrapped his arms tighter around Draco, who didn’t remember when they got there, but was even more thankful all the same. The song in his chest still sang even if it couldn’t escape his mouth.
The smile that was aimed at him was genuine, the same singularity he’d seen once before and yet different from the one that had answered Luna’s thanks for their freedom
After an hour or so longer keeping each other close, Harry made to move away but Draco wouldn’t let him.
Of all the trivia Luna taught him about humans and their hobbies or strange fixations, she never broached the topic about their mating practices, a decision which Draco regretted immeasurably now. Draco had no notion of how humans went about copulating, which left him to work with the only knowledge he had relative familiarity with,
Resigned, Harry returned to his spot, thankful for the Calming Draught he had taken that morning for that exact reason. One bundle of dragon nerves was enough.
He offered the fish in his hand, the same way Harry used to. Draco stared at it but didn’t take it. The disappointment ate up his appetite. He shook his head and slipped back into the water, where he sunk to the bottom. They had to know already that the only one Draco wanted as his keeper was Harry. So why were they changing things?

.” Draco’s attention was brought back to Harry’s apology.
“Shh. shh. It’s alright.”
“What is it, Draco?” Slughorn insisted. “Have I done something, dear Boy?”
Harry mimicked the dragon and let his own eyes begin to fall shut.
Luna went ahead and hugged the shorter man back, patting him on the back consolingly and saying something Draco missed that made the Master—their Master no longer—laugh.
The kelp around his neck calmed the urge thankfully before it could make him even more humiliated by instinctually mistaking human laughter for an invitation to respond with song.
Draco stared at him openly as Slughorn wrung his hands, gaze darting nervously between them.

“Yes, I knew that you were withholding information from me,” Narcissa smiled sadly. “I’ve been worried about him and you’ve helped him…” she trailed off when Andromeda came back out.
date him.” Fab stood up as well, but now she was smirking. Draco put his hands up in disbelief. “I didn’t! I, I wouldn’t!”
Draco snorted and kissed Harry's cheek. "No, seriously."
"I wouldn't call it 'enjoying myself,' but yeas," Draco replied politely.
to make these things come true, or to do whatever other moral a white Suburban mum would tell you. You've got a lot of decisions to make and a lot of changes to come. Embrace them." She took a deep breath and put her clipboard on her desk.
While they trained to become aurors, pretty much everyone else in their friend group had made career plans as well. Hermione was studying Chemistry at Oxford University. Luna had brought art therapy to the wizarding world. Ginny and Neville were working alongside the Hogwarts Restoration Organization to rebuild and renovate Hogwarts. George continued his and Fred’s joke shop and brought in his girlfriend Angelina to help. Things were going back to normal—or as normal as things could be.
Harry picked Teddy up and held him.
"I was
“I’ve done meth before. I know what to do! I just…have never done it by surprise.”
“Charlie.”
.          “Well,” she said, “That was rather fluffy.” She pulled the second envelope out, entitled “Harry Potter,” and handed it to him. “Here you are.” She grinned smugly, as if she were saying “I told you so.”
"That's not fair!"
He groaned and looked at the clock again. Not even three minutes had passed. There was no way he could go to training like this. When he went yesterday, he had confused the Ebublio Jinks with the Biting Jinks, accidentally causing Ron’s textbook to latch onto his arm. It took ten minutes for the professor to calm Ron down enough to get the book off. Harry didn’t want that to happen again, but he had also missed the 1
"Potter, you haven't gotten a clue. Your first year had about 40 students, but, by your sixth year, that number decreased to 25."
“We’ve just decided to wait and get engaged at the right time. I’d like to get engaged after university and then maybe actually get married a few years later. I’m considering getting my doctorate in chem at a graduate school in the States,” Hermione said.
Draco sighed and replied, “Well, they did the same thing to Pansy, didn’t they?”
“Wow, you must really like mirrors,” Draco joked.
He sighed, full of anticipation.
“No, no, no. It’s not possible,” Harry silently pleaded, “The same uni is enough, but the same class? Bloody hell. Shit. Fu-“
“Me and you and Teddy. Unless you’d like to invite someone else,” Andromeda added, smiling cunningly.
The men apparated to Diagon Alley and went to Gringotts to convert their money.
Neville winced at Harry’s drunkenness. He informed the bartenders, "We'll have four shots of fireball, two Blue Labels, two martinis, and a water."
A few days had passed, and it was now Monday, April 10th. Harry had woken up at 5:30AM to go to the gym at 6 like he did every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The auror trainees usually spent Mondays doing written work and having class time. The lack of movement bored Harry, so he decided that he’d needed a regular gym routine. Coffee in hand, Harry strolled to the gym. He ran and lifted weights until it was time to shower and go to work.
“’Ey, you too, Drake.”
“Oh my God,” Draco said. He stood up and paced around the porch. He lit another cigarette.
Draco simply blinked at him in confusion. Did he just call Draco “mate”? Was Draco even technically
Recess took place on the playground behind the school. Decked out with slides, monkey bars, swings, a teeter-totter, and a track, the entity kept the kids content.
To say that Harry was excited for this conference was an over exaggeration in the least. Hogwarts had re-opened last year, but the renovations were still occurring. At that point, not many people wanted to return anyways. There were so many remedial classes and off-limits areas of the school that it hardly felt like Hogwarts.
“An hour!” he exclaimed, “I’ve been looking at one bloody page for
As the class went on, he tried not to notice Potter staring at him from time to time. He tried not to notice Potter observing his muggle clothes. He hoped that Potter wouldn’t notice the bags under his eyes, the lost weight. Then again, it wasn’t as if Potter looked much better. He looked better than he looked that night at the pub: much more sober. Yet, the bags under his eyes were deep, complementing the lack of light in his irises. His clothes looked rather slept-in and dirty, like he rarely did his own laundry. His hair was just as messy as it had always been, the kinks and curls sticking out and into his eyes. His glasses were dirty and smudged. Draco tore his eyes from Potter and looked at the syllabus again.
.          Teddy tightened his little fist. Malfoy gritted his teeth together and rubbed his thumb against his index finger even quicker. “
Harry remarked, “The fact that you
This had probably been the worst birthday that Draco had ever had.
"I'm not your child anymore!"
“I know. Merlin, I know. Have you ever noticed how sometimes I’m a hypocrite? I
“Thanks,” Harry replied. “It’s my favorite color.”
“But you won’t even hear me out!”
Happy Christmas to you, too. I hope that the scarf is keeping you warm in this cold weather and snow. I’m glad that Teddy is happy. My morning has been okay—thank you for asking.
“You knew? I may have always been, but I never realized it. Since when have you guys known?”
that you just said.”
Harry sat down right next to him. In such close proximity, he could make out the various blonds in Draco’s hair, the blue-ish grey of his irises, and the curves of his jaw. Harry cleared his throat and looked away. He almost forgot what he was there for.
“Dear Harry,
“Hey, you. Didn’t you hear me call your name?” the blond asked,
About an hour and a half later, the brownies were cooling, Teddy was awake, and Harry and Andromeda were making icing from scratch. Two hours from the party, Harry went to his room so that he could finally get ready. He wasn’t going as anything special—just a pirate. However, Harry wanted it to be amazing, so he’d bought a full outfit, an eyepatch, a fake beard, and eyeliner. It took him thirty minutes and four tries, but his makeup was finally perfectly messy.
“That’s classified.”
“Yeah, but she wants to stay in her residence or whatever. She says she wants the ‘university experience’ and that using magic to go back to the wizarding world when she should be at a Muggle uni isn’t very ‘uni-like.’”
"Why? I'm fluent."
“I mean…
4. Your emotions are valid and normal.
He stopped there and folded the paper up. Then, he stepped outside to chain-smoke for a while. When he came back inside, he saw that the clock read 4:05 AM. He was grateful. Four hours of sleep was a lot for him. After he fixed a pot of coffee, he heard a whimpering sound from Teddy’s bedroom. Harry rushed in and picked the toddler up.
"Draco Lucius Abraxas Mal-"
Most importantly, he wanted to tell someone. Which meant that he defied all stereotypes. Weren’t you supposed to find out that you were gay or bi or pan or something when you’re five? And aren’t you supposed to be terrified of coming out?
to?” Harry asked.
“Wait, weren’t you just berating your therapist because it was ‘bizarre’ to question your sexuality?”
.          “Bring it to me!” She called back. “I have Teddy in the tub and can’t leave!”
In a few minutes, Teddy’s breaths became even and Harry placed him back down in his bed. Harry silently backed out of the bedroom and walked back to the kitchen. He drained a few cups of coffee and picked at some cereal, and then he took a shower. When he was done with everything, it was 5:30 AM.
He was slightly jarred by the urgency of the letter. Yet he wondered how bad an article about him could really be. He hadn’t touched the
“Oui, [Yes,] lil’ one?”
"Okay," Draco whispered.
Harry asked, "How many students are attending?"
“Oh, uh, nothing. I just thought I saw something,” Harry replied. He checked for the head of white-blond hair but couldn’t see anything else. Harry shrugged it off.
Harry could tell that they were getting on serious ground again. Draco didn't like to focus on the bullying during Hogwarts, especially not towards the Weasleys, especially because Fred di—Harry didn't allow himself to finish the thought. Then he got angry at himself. Why did he have to go forward in one thing, like sleeping, and then backward in another?
It was now 9 PM and they had just finished a run to Starbucks. Harry was walking Draco home.
“130,” Sally replied. Fab and Draco groaned.
“So, you do meth, but you’re too good to shoot up? Okay, then.” She rolled her eyes.
Together, they walked to English class.
Harry snorted, “No. Not even a little bit. I was just thinking about it on my way to Archie’s.” He got the food out of the bag and continued, “Do you really think I’m getting better?”
“We’re great!” Ron answered. He smiled and looked at Hermione.
"Well, yes. Ambien is known to change how you sleep, and dreaming is just a part of that cycle. Most people experience what they describe as 'strange' or 'weird' dreams, though. They're not that problematic, but I'd still like for you to keep me updated on your dream sequences and such."
"You are

“Well, ask away.”

A solitary bird chirped. The snow had finally melted from the ground a fortnight before. Harry tossed and turned in his bed.
“Oh, er—“
Harry felt somewhat ashamed to admit that he had spent the past three hours hyperventilating and having a break down, but he wrote a letter to his therapist about it anyways. He read for a little bit to calm himself down. By the time that Andromeda woke up, his palms were still sweaty.
"Well, I've been rather all right. Currently I'm a trainee healer for the Appleby Arrows. They reckon I'll be ready to work full-time by September," Dean said.
Thank you for reading! I can't believe I picked up this four year old fic, but I really enjoyed getting back into it. Special thanks to iessoardin, who encouraged me. This is a short chapter, but the story is just about to pick up!
It looked just as marvelous as it always did. Harry couldn’t help but overlook the dark vibes of the castle; he knew that it would feel different, but he didn’t care that much. The Entrance Hall had obviously been redone, but it had kept its token marble staircase and oak doors. Harry, Andromeda, and Teddy had begun making their way to the Great Hall when suddenly Teddy started screaming.

happened to the heater. Sometimes this meant that there wouldn’t be hot water for a few days if too many people had used hot water at one time. Draco didn’t think he’d ever be able to understand muggles. Sally told him that people had individual hot water heaters most of the time; she said she wasn’t sure why this building had all of them connected. She didn’t ask him why he didn’t know what a hot water heater was. She never asked him about his life before Moss Side; he never asked her about hers.
Sincerely,
“C’mon, Teddy.
.          “I like ‘ur ‘air,” Teddy stated, somehow missing both the “y” and “h” sounds. Harry resolved to help the child with his pronunciation later on.
"Fine, do as you want," she whispered before walking away.
“Just havin’ fun. Azkaban and parole, y’know.”
“‘Arry!” the young child squealed and changed his skin color to match that of Harry. After deciding that his complexion was dark enough, Teddy morphed a tiny lightning bolt scar on the center of his forehead.
Dousselsnorf snorted hard to clear collected mucus out of his throat. “Would you like for me to fill out an official report, or shall I just give you a cookie for doing the bare minimum?” He replied sarcastically.
Harry Went about his day as normal as he could. At lunch time, Andromeda stopped him and told him that she would always love and accept him, and that Tonks wasn’t straight, either. However, Harry’s mood grew fouler as more and more papers came in. It was as if their accuracy got worse with time.
“Oh. You have problems sleeping?”
“Yes, I know. I just wanted to hear you say, ‘Busty Boo,’” the officer admitted with a smirk playing at his mouth. He cleared his throat and continued.
By 7:30, Harry had learned that Draco’s favorite book was

"Andromeda," Harry called. "Which table should Teddy sit at?"
"I'm almost done with auror training!" Ron announced. "All I need now is the practical internships. I'm completely finished with all the theoretical stuff. I even passed the exams with flying colors!"
“Merpeople? Yes.”
“When?” Draco asked. He was genuinely confused. Even if she were referencing the group of wizards, who did she mean?
Over the past two days, the snow had evened out and it was now safe to travel on the muggle roads. Harry and Andromeda had taken the opportunity to go grocery shopping. Andromeda took holidays very seriously, if Halloween and November 5th weren't enough of examples. She insisted on making several types of fudges, cookies, pies, and cakes. Along with that, she promised Teddy that they would make a gingerbread house. In comparison with the presents that she bought Teddy, Harry's pile looked like pebbles.
Malfoy choked out a humorless laugh and said, “Right, Potter. My poor, bigoted parents.” He rolled his eyes again.
Harry didn’t mind, so they stood around smoking cigarettes together.
But it was nothing like this. How could something so similar be so different?
“Headmistress,” she corrected.
“Potter, table for two,” Harry informed the host.

Harry sent an owl to McGonagall, and they had scheduled a meeting for the seventeenth of May. He had fifteen days to go before his life changed—again.
But he had no human voice to utter it, and Harry had no siren ears. So Draco smiled at him, as warmly as he did mutely, instead.
Draco slowly lowered himself to align it, obscuring his actions with his hands till the last second. And then he pressed the hole beneath his slit to it and began impaling himself for all to see.
Draco grinned haughtily at the man’s retreating back.

Whatever ominous ‘last time’ referred to turned Slughorn white as a sheet. He looked positively shaken.

A tragedy.

Slughorn stood there at the edge of the pool, dumbfounded, never having been so disregarded by Draco before.
In a place only the two of them knew... protected by a beast that one of them was... surrounded by a sea of wealth and fire-breathing scales... the security of possessions and physical shelter let the dragon and Draco relax. And Harry felt more protected than he ever had before with a dragon snoozing in his lap.
The look of relief on Slughorn’s face was palpable as he dried his face with a handkerchief. “Thank you, Harry-”
Draco put all of his desperation into the note for his mate.

Despite the feelings of betrayal Draco had felt so strongly only days ago toward the man, he found himself drawn to him—and not in anger. Having been given details of his circumstances helped things. Though he did rile Draco up, it was currently a manageable vexation that Draco kind of enjoyed, and most irritation was outweighed by the relief Harry’s presence brought just by interrupting Draco’s tedious isolation.

He felt strange, surreal. Afraid with it off, more naked—

“Don’t worry,” his eyes took on a more distant look. “She’s safe.” The end of his sentence wasn’t as celebratory given the subject, but perhaps it was just because it was old news to Harry and didn’t mean as much to him as it did Draco.
But Draco had already turned away, re-absorbed in studying the list. The quill scrawled off another check-mark on Draco’s Gift Registry, wherever
Draco nodded, flashing his teeth as he did so. He was but, he would need the fish and their smell as far away as possible from Harry and himself for once.
Harry’s mouth opened.
As Harry took on all of Draco’s weight, Harry’s scent pressed directly against his nose. It only seemed to sap at Draco’s consciousness even faster. He just wanted to remain there forever, warm and held. Harry really was too potent for him in water for Draco to lose control like this. Draco should be scared but he was still just deliriously happy. It all felt right, because his mate was with him now.
Draco bit his lip. He was hesitant. He finally said, “Well, you probably know more about
“Thank you,” Andromeda said, walking out of the room.
.          Andromeda was cooing at Teddy when she spotted Malfoy. She immediately recognized him. “Draco?” she wondered aloud.

“Why?” Harry said.
"I took a nap and forgot to put the turkey in the oven. Andromeda did it and left me a note. I woke up at 2 AM to find it and flipped"
Harry inhaled sharply in surprise.
Ginny slapped him playfully on the arm and said, “I got the acceptance letter two days ago. I legit cried—I couldn’t believe it!”

“No!”
“I think she’s trying to get back into muggle slang or whatever. I have no clue. You know how Hermione is at times,” Ron admitted.
I hope to hear from you. Take care.
“But I will make you a deal: if you ignore me, I’ll ignore you. All right?”
They stood in silence and threw their cigarette butts away. Harry was ready to go back indoors when Draco pointed up and said, “Mistletoe.”
He attempted, “Hey, Draco.”
“Have you thought at all about what we talked about last week?”
“Who’s announcing it tonight?” He asked.
“Why did you get pets?”
"I'll go to the PTSD meetings with you."
“Yup,” Harry confirmed.
Malfoy shook his head in negation, "No, my mother and I don't talk anymore."
“So, Draco,” Andromeda spoke up, ignoring Teddy’s newest temper tantrum over the color of his sippy cup. “What made you decide on history?”
After class, the two boys walked out together. Harry lit up a cigarette.
“Hmm…a cardinal,” Draco observed after about ten minutes.
“Yeah.”
"Oh, I'd think that you'd take French."
Harry and Andromeda heated up all the food and set out the buffet. Everyone lined up and Harry got in the back of the line, near the door. At that time, Draco and his mother came through the door and obviously were in the middle of arguing.
This particular Wednesday was Draco’s first day off in many, many days. He had planned to stay up rather late with a bottle of Firewhisky, listening to music on the new CD player he bought himself. He had done so that night; however, he was awoken by a loud knocking at his window shortly before 8AM. When he rose from his bed, he realized that it was a postage owl pecking. The owl had three letters in its beak, and they were all from one person: Narcissa Malfoy.
Harry woke up 6AM so he could get ready for training that day. He had only slept a few hours, and he had a killer headache, but he was as well rested as he had been since the war. He took a long, hot shower and dressed quickly. He downed a few cups of black coffee and a bowl of cereal. He apparated to the Department around 7:30 and walked into his classroom around 7:50. Ron greeted him.
be magic there. Just maybe," Harry joked.
Draco pursed his lips.
Somehow, he still wasn’t sure about Sally—or any muggles, really. They helped each other and even went out of their way to make sure someone was safe or okay. Sally had spent part of her savings in order to get Draco some Xanax since he blew all of his money on that coke. He had always been taught that kindness was weakness, and that was why the muggles were so weak: they didn’t know when to be selfish. When the war first ended, he spent a lot of time being confused. He didn’t know what to think about muggles and muggleborns and half-bloods. He didn’t know what to think about Dumbledore and Hogwarts. He didn’t know what to think about the Death Eaters or Harry Potter or even all of the bloody things that happened to him as a result of his father’s “career.”
“Hey, buddy. What’s wrong?” Harry asked.
Draco’s smile grew. He acknowledged, “That sounds nice. Like something you needed.”
Harry frowned and said, “I dunno.”
“Huh?”

“You’ve been to Knockturn Alley?” Malfoy questioned.
Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise, then he added, “Isn’t she exiled? How was she able to come here?”
“Uh...yeah,” Harry replied. They both seemed to be at a loss for words. For a moment, Narcissa merely stared at Harry with her mouth open. Then, she shook herself out of her stupor.
muggles
“Oh...yeah! That’d be great. So, um, is the cake for them?”
“Yes, of course.”
Over the next five days, they finished the fudge, the cookies (sugar, red velvet, and chocolate chip), the pies (mince, cherry, and chocolate), and the cakes (vanilla and marble). Harry could not foresee looking at another pastry. But it was the day before the party (Christmas Eve Eve) and he was up at 4 AM so that he could start on the dinner.
They both burst out laughing.
"How about you, Harry?" Neville asked.
The building looked the same as it did when he first visited: old, antique, ancient. Draco didn’t care which one it was. Growing up as a Malfoy, they all felt like synonyms—or maybe that was his French brain talking. He was about to check in when he saw a familiar head of black hair. He hid behind the potted plant in front of the door and peered out. He saw dark skin, messy and curly hair, and a lightning-bolt shaped scar. There was no bloody way. There was no bloody way that Potter was there.

"No more dreams?" She questioned.
Malfoy simply nodded curtly.
“Yeah.”

“Well, then, I take it that you know what you’re gonna do.”
. [Stay still. Change your hair again so that I can brush it, please.]” Teddy complied but not without a scowl on his face.
Harry rolled his eyes and said, “Oh, come on.”
“Hmm...Spooky Scary Skeletons— The Dance Remix?”
“Didn’t I?”
"Wasn't she chaser for the Gryffindors?" Draco speculated, looking slightly confused.
“Yeah,” the blond agreed.
“Oh,” said Andromeda. “Well, I should have told you. Narcissa a arrivé à cinq heures du soir. Oui? [arrived at five in the evening. Yes?]”
, Potter! This is very serious.”
“Draco!” Teddy commanded, “Up!”
“Oh.”
Andromeda smiled, “Yes, it was.” She set the table and put their pancakes down.
.          “Oh, well, yeah. He does. He’s very smart. Can you count to ten for Draco, Teddy?” Andromeda bounced Teddy in her arms. He shook his head and pouted. “Ugh,
They sat down and Harry said, “This place reminds me of Knockturn Alley.”

You too,
Several hours passed before Draco finally calmed down. He flushed all of his drugs and poured his liquors down the sink. He was going to get better. He had to get better. He was finally not feeling high, so he was pretty confident about his meeting. He’d rarely ever been “manic” before, and he wasn’t completely familiar with not feeling like shit. He took a long, lukewarm shower.

Someone grabbed his arm and he looked up. Draco was smiling at him.
"Hey, hey. It's okay. You didn't know. It was almost two months ago, anyways," he interrupted.
“Unicorns?”
“We should…we should go before they call the bloody authorities,” Fab declared. She dabbed under her eyes with a tissue, careful not to wipe away her eyeliner and mascara. The three of them stood up and left the park.
“Draco. Draco Malfoy,” Harry replied.
“Two: I was a scared kid when
Draco laughed, and then so did Harry. It felt nice to joke around.
“Roughly an hour.”
“Nothing. Just not used to being complimented by the Bi Who Lived.”
Their jaws dropped.
While he waited for Teddy to wake up, he vacuumed and mopped the floors, dusted, wiped the counters, and cleaned all the expensive china that they'd use. Teddy woke up crying—something about a nightmare about Ursula from the Little Mermaid. Harry ran to his room and scooped him up. He could, after all, relate to the toddler.
"Oh, yeah. I'm doing much better. The Ambien is really helping. I got eight hours of sleep last night!"
“Oui, je comprends [Yes, I understand].” Harry answered. He finally put his wand away.
. Do you need help carrying the presents in?"
Neville got up, leading Harry to the counter. Harry would have felt nervous about seeing and talking to Malfoy again, the first time since he'd given Malfoy's wand back after the war, but he was just a bit too tipsy to care. He walked into a stool at one of the nearby tables, and Neville grabbed his arm in order to steady him.
“Harry,” she said, softening the embrace. “You are the kindest and most considerate person I know. Don’t ever change.” She let go of him and resumed her stirring. “Don’t worry— there are no special effects like I always did for Dora. No spell show, no fog, no spiders. I want everyone to be safe and happy. The scariest thing here will be the ghosts of the brownie graveyard— and they’ll be smiling!”
.          When class was dismissed, Malfoy got up as quickly as he usually did; however, this time he lost his balance and nearly fell over. Out of instinct, Harry extended his arms out. Malfoy swatted them away and glared at Harry. Harry rolled his eyes again and strode to his flat so that he could take the floo to Andromeda’s. He didn't watch as Malfoy left.
” Sally said, the sarcasm playing in her voice. “Noooo. Jerry would
He gladly visited every child, pointing out a hidden plot in the book or a special fact about the magic. As he walked through the room, he grew nostalgic for the days of Dumbledore’s Army. He enjoyed helping people learn and understand. Before Harry knew it, it was time to pass out goldfish and multiplication charts.
A few kids giggled, obviously knowing that he was joking.
"No, I did," Harry answered. "but I think that teaching will make me happier."
“S-sorry.”
“Eh. Not really. What’re you gonna do after uni?”
“No press,” Harry said matter-of-factly.
“Oh, God. This is gonna be so awkward,” Harry added.
“It’s shaped like lightning!” Davie squeaked.
“Draco,” the blond corrected.
“Harry, take it from someone who knows
Andromeda came back to the table after her smoke break. It was her turn to watch Teddy and Harry and Draco’s turn to smoke. The two men walked outdoors and stood by the wall on the side of the building. It was pretty late, so they were the only ones out there.
They kissed and went on their separate ways.
“Yeah. You alright?” Harry replied.
“So, slack classes.”
, and
“So was Andromeda.”
.          "Ooooh, are you using your big boy words now, Potter?" Malfoy replied. He sneered at him.
“Yeah,” Malfoy said, suddenly very interested in his menu. He soon cleared his throat and asked, “Do you know what you’re going to order yet?”
"How big is the staff?"
“’Was’? ‘Were’? Wh-what happened to them?” Draco asked. He felt like he already knew the answer.
Draco rolled his eyes.
"Oh. Is that the course that you should be in now?"
They continued their meeting and discussed Draco’s short-term and long-term goals. Draco spoke about maintaining his job, fully furnishing his apartment, going to university, and, most importantly, getting clean. Dousselsnorf seemed less angry than normal, so Draco thought that know was the perfect time to poke the bear.
The nurse came in and signaled for Ron to leave as she checked Harry’s head. Harry lie in the bed after she left. He had already missed about ten days that year,
"So, let's discuss why you're here, Mr. Potter."
Harry practically ran to the door, but he had to stop before he opened it so that he could catch his breath. He turned the doorknob and let a smiling Draco in.
