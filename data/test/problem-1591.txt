Harry shot him a knowing smile back, mentally preparing himself for whatever way Draco chose to respond. He hoped it’d be wicked. Harry wanted to push Draco, so that, in turn, he would push Harry back. Because when you got down to the crux of it, that’s what they’d always wanted. They’d simply been two stubborn boys revving for a challenge. It wasn’t until later that they discovered a challenge could take many different forms.
“Fuck, Potter” Malfoy breathed, moving in on Harry’s mouth again. This time, Malfoy decided slow was fine as long as it was accompanied by maneuvers with his tongue Harry felt ought be labeled dark magic. The hold Malfoy had on Harry’s throat seemed to tighten with his enthusiasm and Harry was so hard the slightest breeze could tip him over the edge.
Theo: Don’t be sorry! I have a new business deal in the works, this will do wonders for my reputation.
Prongs: Right. You don’t know that there’s limited jobs in the wizarding world? Even fewer that leave you famous?
Stay strong! Any second, Teddy will get bored of hiding and walk into the living room.  Finding his godfather half-hard and sexually frustrated in the hands of his estranged cousin was not on!
Draco: "You suck them into your mouth." *Sucking sounds * "Uhh that feels incredible. Mmm makes me wonder what else you can do with that mouth."
“Have you brought a notepad, Potter,” Draco went on with enthusiasm, “because this part may be of some interest to you.” Harry would be willing to bet his Firebolt it  wouldn’t be, but he nodded along all the same because the other wizard’s passion for the subject was nothing short of adorable. “It’s simplest just to keep in mind the six “s’s’” of wine tasting: See, Swirl, Smell, Sip, the option to Spit or Swallow and Savor.” Harry snorted, barely contained, laughter bursting from chest.
Prongs: Shit. I’m sorry. I have a really short fuse when it comes to prejudice and sometimes I assume the worst. I guess you can say I’m not quite over the war.
Ginny: She said she had a shoot there, but she had her lie voice on. I’ll pester her about it later. For now, we know where he is!
“Yes,” voice sounding broken, “D-d-draco please!” Sparks danced and burst up Harry’s spine as a broad, textured tongue lapped at him over and over again. Draco moaned into his arse and a constant stream of expletives flowed from Harry’s mouth like veritaserumed truths.
Harry: Yes…A time of ginger hairballs, no covers and the scent of sweaty armguards. You’re absolutely right, how have I managed without you?
I am so overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from all of you readers! It really made my week and is 100% the reason why I wanted to get the next chapter out so quickly.
Greenviper: I’ve nothing against them, on principle, but relationships are meant to be about candor and trust. With the Magical Statute of Secrecy, it makes that impossible. I’m aware many couples have done it in the past but being a wizard is a huge part of who I am, it’s a part of everything I do. It is unlikely that anyone could understand or connect with the real me without it.
Hermione: If something natural makes you that uncomfortable, we will replace the couch. Ron and I are sincerely sorry, we thought you’d be at work.
Hermione: I’m glad you like them! I think they’re the only books you’ve read that I’ve given you these past eleven years.
Ginny: "Oh yeah, I called to make sure we were on the same page about the annual camping trip. Luna and Rolf are convinced we need to get to the site at FIVE AM to see the plimpies."
“How could I possibly interrupt – “ Draco paused, a teasing look about his face, “whatever it was I just walked in on.” Harry gave him a two finger salute and returned to his work on the hollandaise. He spared a glance at the butter he had clarifying in a small pot and leaned more fully into Draco’s arms.
Malfoy who had, unfortunately, been savouring at the time....had promptly began to choke. Harry, for his part, was patting himself on the back for managing not to laugh during the coughing fit. Malfoy, however, surprising Harry for what must have been the fifteenth time that evening, did laugh.
“Next week, as it turns out,” Harry said, keeping a careful eye on him.  “We have to get ourselves situated before the students turn up.” Noticing Malfoy’s expression hadn’t changed, Harry called upon Godric, Helga and whichever founders would help him, and took Malfoy’s hand across the table. Malfoy looked up at him, mask firmly in place.
Greenviper: I’ll meet you at the bar of a restaurant called “The Sinclair,” on Pollen st, Mayfair. How does 18:30 sound? I know it may seem early but it is a Monday evening, after all.
Ginny: Shut the fuck up. You would not! That was the best month of your life. The tour was only two weeks. You were fine.
“Come on, Boy Wonder,” Draco goaded, “I know you can fit it all in that smart mouth of yours.” Harry shook his head, eyes watering from the strain on his jaw. It wasn’t possible, his mouth was full to breaking and there was still a whole quarter a towel left.
Hermione: Where to start? I was going to surprise Ron because I’d been away but for some reason, I couldn’t get my skirt’s zip up.
Harry: I’d press you up against the cold, stone wall a bit harder than is strictly necessary. There’s sure to be a mark the next day but I kind of like the sound of that so I keep pushing, rolling my erection against yours. I look down and see the outline of your hardening cock through those maddening fucking trousers of yours. I sink to my knees and rub the leather surrounding your cock against my cheek. My mouth waters. The smell of the material mixed with your scent
“That’s right,” Harry agreed and made sure to smile at Teddy in a way that let him know that Harry was, in fact, the lucky one.
“I know,” Draco consented, both hands firmly on Harry’s chest again. His arms were completely outstretched to ensure there was a substantial amount of space between the two of them.  “You need to go home before I lose my nerve.”
Harry: "We fry macaroni and cheese in the shape of miniature people and I charm them to walk around the table."
McGonagall: "Now, I’m just calling to check in. Neville has informed me you have agreed to take his place in handling the last minute arrangements for this Friday."
Harry: Am I? So, at the engagement party you didn’t talk to Bill about me keeping Teddy from Draco (not true, btw) when you knew he’d overhear you? You didn’t say negative things to Teddy about Draco behind my back? You’ve been so sneaky. I didn’t even realize the extent of it until this morning. Do Slytherins have magic cum or something, one orgasm and you turn into the worst of them?
Hermione: Neither would skinning your hide, Harry, but you don’t exactly fancy the sound of it, do you?
Ron: Bloody hell, not this again. So he was staring at Harry, what’s else is new? He was probably plotting something. Hermione, YOU were clearly staring at Malfoy! Are you telling me you fancy the ferret?
Hermione: He’s a Slytherin, he took the dark mark, he was brainwashed by his family, regrets his actions and, Harry, it was him you said you saw in Godric’s not Pansy.
“Potter,” Draco groused, being pulled down with him, but there was a smile plastered clear across his face. Harry pulled Draco toward him, hands cupping either side of his face, delighted at the opportunity to look at him. He pulled him close. Draco resisted –
Pansy: I didn’t do it for you. I swear, Potter, if you hurt him I will set Blaise on you and, trust me, the poison apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.
“What would you have me do, Malfoy?” Harry asked, half wanting the answer. “Obliviate myself? Forget about all the years you spent walking around like the biggest twat in recorded history.” A muscle in Malfoy’s jaw twitched and Harry knew from many a spar with the other man that that was never a good sign. It was odd though, nostalgia caressed Harry’s temper, giving him the impulse to push his school rival further still.
Hermione: You two are horrible. Harry, I’ve never known you to be superficial. I’m sure he is perfectly lovely.
Greenviper: I regret what I did. I’m a horrible person. I deserved to die in Azkaban, maybe you wish you killed me yourself, I don’t know. Is that what you want to hear? Because I like you! I never put up with these war conversations because they never make anyone feel better but I like you a lot and you needed to know.
Draco removed his tongue, replacing it with a finger to massage at Harry’s prostate. Harry bucked on a whimper, a smattering of bright dots appearing before his eyes. This was insane he’d barely touched his dick and - his balls drew up again –
Pansy: Oh, certainly, the ball’s only tomorrow but please take all the time in the world doing whatever it is Potters do.
Harry: I know you all think I talk about him too much but the best thing just happened. I think I might cry!
Harry: "FUCK! Merlin, please Hydra. I want it. M-make me wet for you. Open me up and give me what you promised. I-I’m desperate for it."
be scared of me,” Teddy said quietly. Harry’s head abruptly turned back to the boy, Harry and Draco saying “No,” at the same time.
Draco: Great. So I’ll meet you at Palms of Goa at 7, then? Or shall we push for 6, in case things start to fizzle.
Harry sighed, feeling like the universe had conspired against him. Why wasn’t he permitted anything simple? There truly was no joy without stipulations for him. He was pissed at Malfoy but he didn’t want to hurt him. He wanted Malfoy, but he hated the idea of wanting him. Fuck, he needed more alcohol!
Harry wanted to be irritated - he had a plan to give Draco a piece of his mind but was much too distracted by the way the other man peered, patiently at Teddy. Was far too swept away by the flurry it caused in his chest and the onslaught of want it triggered in other places.
You aren’t the only one who does it. No one in the family takes Pansy and my relationship seriously and it really pisses me off. It was the same with quidditch. No one believed I was good enough until I got on the Harpies. I don’t want to have to wait until Pansy and I are married or something for people to start treating us with respect.
“But today is a new day, Potter,” Draco pressed Harry’s nipples into his chest, “things have changed.” Pain spread like the blush across Harry’s chest, picking up pleasure on its way down the rest of his body.
Ginny: Are you going to put it on a pillow, cuddle with it at night? Let it remind you of a better time?
When he was one he saved world, at fourteen he battled a dragon and at twenty two Harry Potter was about to denounce Godric and run away from his problems. He could buy a Crup and commit to a life of abstinence. He could live vicariously through characters in books, where each complication had a desired degree of separation from his own life. He could even convince himself that that wasn’t as pathetic as it sounded in his head, what he couldn’t do, however, was live with not knowing. The past couple months, Theo had given Harry a glimpse of what his life could be; to have a partner to joke, fight and grow with and all Harry had ever wanted was a family. So, as barmy as it was, he stood outside The Sinclair, doubt turning to sweat at his temples, and confident in nothing but the fit of his jacket.
“I – God just – “Harry craned his neck to look at Draco, for all the man’s bravado he did not look the picture of composure. His face was flushed, his lips parted and his eyes clenched with desire as he pushed his clothed prick into Harry’s arse. Harry smirked.
Greenviper: It’s in the wizards toilets, first stall. Message me when you get home and I’ll tell you how to use it.
first years and then you’re off dancing with him like he’s as pure as puff.” Malfoy all but shouted.
Ron: It’s true! I called Dean and Seamus second year and I knew about Fred when everyone still thought he was dating Angelina. I even called you, Harry!
Look, Hydra, it’s not my fault YOU told me some personal shit about yourself and now you’re feeling insecure about it.  I told you I don’t care about your family.
Greenviper: You know what? You clearly grew up in the muggle world and had access to an LGBT community that doesn’t yet exist in the wizarding world. I’m a pureblood, I can’t just look things up on the enterpet device. I didn’t even know what ‘pan’ meant. I had to message three different friends and my ex. You are a judgmental arsehole. Have a nice life!
Greenviper: I already asked the incompetent muggle to deliver it to my home but she informed me that it would arrive midday tomorrow. When I explained to her that I needed to wear it this evening, she said there was nothing else she could do.
“We’re going to fuck,” Draco said, decisively. He climbed on the bed, straddled Harry’s waist and began unbuttoning his shirt at the same time. “I don’t care which way we do it,” he continued, “but it’s happening. Right now.”
Hermione: Please don’t use that term. And anyway, I’ve been doing some thinking and I think it’s clear Hydra is Malfoy.
“Sorry,” Draco groaned, sitting up and pressing buttons on his Spellular. He rubbed a hand across his face, tiredly. Harry tried to pull Draco back to him. “No, Potter, I really have to go. Now I have to shower again before my interview.”
the way I did with Hydra then…then I was ruined. Then…There’s nobody else for me, Draco … You are everything I’ve ever wanted. *Hysterical chuckle* and we’ve technically been dating a week. So that’s like defeating-the-Dark-Lord fucking terrifying.”
Ginny: Sure. I was meant to be getting drinks with George, anyway. I’ve told him he can come along and that you’ll be paying his tab as well.
“Exactly,” Harry said, emotion a sticky, stuck, toffee in his throat. He made eye-contact with Draco on the other side of the bed, a world of screams and fear and riddukulus’d boggarts passing between them in their wordless conversation.
TheRealGing: Not that many, actually. It’s a heavily warded profile. We screen the site and select who gets to see our profile. Then we wait for them to bite. All of those selected have been interested, though. :b
“Fuck,fuck,fuck, fuck” Harry cursed. He turned his head around to see what the other man looked like.
Not that Harry wasn’t happy to share, in fact, it turned out he was chuffed to do just about anything that kept Malfoy at that table with him. Harry had no idea what would happen when the magic of this night was over. When he had to go home and justify his feelings to Ron and Hermione. Or, even better, if Harry got lucky and didn’t have to go home at all, what would happen in the morning? Would Harry catch Malfoy in a bad mood? Would the
Ginny: Hey, remember that time we literally rocked your socks off. We were in a rush so you left them on, yeah. But then you got hot half way through and decided to take them off but your feet smelled so bloody RANK! HAHAHAHA
“That doesn’t matter,” Teddy bellowed, “my first Dad was a werewolf and Vic’s gran is half veela and she says a full veela could beat a full werewolf but I want to tell her she’s wrong!”
Harry: I just had a good feeling about this bloke. He was funny and sassy and used words like auspicious.
Draco: “You make me happy and I didn’t think that was possible…for me. Which is, as you put it, defeating-the-Dark-Lord fucking terrifying. So, I’m sorry I keep doubting you. Eventually, I’ll become disillusioned with you and that will no longer be a problem.”
“However, on a full moon, the wolf has no real connection to his human self, while the Veela maintains human consciousness, which in the case of a fight would hopefully mean they’d also maintain a sense of human morality thus – “
But do know this, if you ever ask me to call you ‘Sir’ in person, you’ll find yourself extremely disappointed.
Though, I suppose you get points for knowing not to try for Ravenclaw. Wouldn’t that have been a laugh.
Harry felt rough fabric press against his lips. He looked down. It was his white kitchen towel. Draco pushed it into his mouth at Harry’s shocked gasp. He pushed and pushed until Harry started to choke, the towel pressing against his gag-reflex with nowhere else to go.
Pansy: I disagree. It will make that mop you call hair purposefully haphazard and it’s in line with that ruggedly handsome aesthetic you keep failing to achieve.
Harry: "Course. I’m pretty open with him about most things. Not to mention, his Dad was bi so… I don’t know. It just seemed important to talk about it early. His gran wasn’t too keen, mind."
“Keep working, Potter,” Draco taunted. His voice had taken on the same husky quality as the previous night and what was once a whisper of arousal, became a steady pulse between his legs. Harry let out an exasperated huff.
Greenviper: You better not be OK. You better be lying in St. Mungo’s drinking meals from a straw. I can see you saw my messages!
“And,” Draco continued, looking somber, “the only werewolf I’ve ever met who embraced their wolf form, could even control when he changed, he was a sick and terrible creature. Nowhere near the man your father was.”
Greenviper: I’ll be ‘thrilled’ if this works. Until then, you’ll not find me counting any dragon eggs.
WARNING: This chapter deals with depression and is at points significantly more serious than other chapters. You have been warned!
performance in there was entirely unfair!” With a flick of his wrist, he sent Harry tumbling onto his unmade bed. Draco’s eyes were dark and predatory. Harry stared, bottom lip caught between his teeth, at the obvious tent in Draco’s trousers.
Harry’s shoulders tensed and he felt the uncomfortable beginnings of a power headache. He should have been used to it at this point, it was always the same when something unexpectedly reminded him of his time with the Dursleys.
that morning Sybil said there was bad hair in my future." *sniffles* "Sorry Harry, working the ball has brought back all these old feelings. You were saying?"
“So,” Teddy said, ignoring Harry completely, “what are your in- in,” he screwed up his face in concentration as he struggled with the difficult word. “In-ten-chuns with my Dad?”
Harry slid further up the counter, trying to ground himself for each blow, wrists almost as sore as his arse with the constant back and forth.  But it was worth it to feel that exquisite sting, the excruciating anticipation of the next time it was to come; worth it for his cock to be red, rock hard and leaking onto his cabinets.
Explanation: Woosh, ok so mental health is a struggle! For me it tends to be a bigger struggle during big changes in my life, no matter how good those changes are. I was cast in a 4 month acting tour, an incredible career-changing experience, but it did require me to move away from and be isolated from a lot of my family and friends and those people are my rock! As you can probably guess, things were not great for me at the beginning of the tour. But life is about adapting and learning and so I adapted and learned how to use skype! I also cultivated a new sort of comfort family where I was and I owe them everything! Long story made a bit shorter, I valued forming those relationships and keeping in contact with my estranged family over fandom. I was still connected as a reader but I didn't have it in me to write the final chapter until now. And frankly it would have been BAD had I tried to.
Draco: I think it’s pointless to not let Teddy call you ‘Dad.’ I know that when you read this in my voice that it appears judgmental, but that’s not case. I completely understand why the prefix is important to you, however, Teddy doesn’t have the same sentimentality about honoring the memory of Professor Lupin that you do. He’s just a little boy being raised, superbly, I might add, by his hero. He wants someone to call ‘Dad,’ I know you can relate to that. The title means a lot more to him than it does to Professor Lupin at this point. And in any case, last time I checked, a kid was allowed more than one Dad.
Hermione: I wonder why Malfoy got sooo upset at the EXACT same time Harry started dancing with Theo?
Last night I fucked you like I’d been fantasizing about fucking you since before I knew what fucking was. And I was so overwhelmed by all the possible ways I could fuck you that I wanted to have it all at once.
Mr. Brewer: "If this is about the hotel in Brighton, I already talked to you all once. I don’t know nothing about it."
Instead, Harry was pleased to feel Draco’s nimble hands massage at his shoulders. He didn’t have the words for it yet, but one day he would tell Draco how much that simple act of understanding meant to him.
Neville: A brilliant idea in theory: make them run the Hogwarts Express just for the two of us for unnecessary albeit extremely important, nostalgia reasons. Not so practical in practice, though, is it?
“The only reason I finished  the course,” Harry continued, “was because McGonagall plans for me to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts in a few years and thought I needed to learn Auror grade defensive spells. It backfired , though, I was top of my Auror class and now the department won’t let me go unless I agree to teach a seminar over the summer – “
Draco’s vocal cords emitted a high-pitched whimper, “You should see how you look,” Harry heard him swallow, “Potter, you’ll be the death of me.”
Greenviper: Are you SURE you’re a wizard? Honestly, it’s a wonder they allow you to function without assistance.
“For breakfast?” Harry shook his head. “Yeah, I don’t think so. They’re in a bag on the counter, you can take them with you.” He gave his ex a disapproving sidelong glance, “I’m sure Ginny with let you have one as soon as I’m out of earshot.”
“Well done,” Draco praised and Harry, Godric knows why, thanked him, the word ‘Sir’ poised at his lips. In the future, when Harry looked back on this morning, and he certainly would (often), he would mark this as the moment he knew he was thoroughly and irrevocably fucked.
Harry: Honestly, I’d rather just spend my birthday with the kid. I only have a few days left with him.
“I’m going to eat you,” He declared, then licked Harry from bollocks to tailbone. Harry’s hips went haywire, bucking at air and his bloody cabinets. Drool dribbled at the corners Harry’s mouth. Draco steadying him.
Harry: There’s some space just in front of me, if you don’t mind it being a bit snug. No socks in sight.
I mourn the loss of that arse each day. I will never have an arse as perfect as yours again. You’ve ruined me for all other bums!
“You’re mine.“ And then Draco was coming too. Harry felt his come deep within, his spent cock making a valiant, yet feeble, attempt to jerk back to life.
Draco kissed at Harry’s hole. He sucked, slurped and breathed into it, making Harry wet, desperate and begging for it.
“Your handwriting,” Malfoy said simply. Harry waited for him to go on. “There were notes in the margins of the books, remember?” Malfoy met his eyes then and, though Harry was wholly unprepared for fierce grey being thrust upon him, he did not move. “You wrote a letter to the Wizengamot,” he went on, “a plea to clear Mother and myself of our crimes in the war. You must have known they wouldn’t refuse you…” He petered off and Harry waited. There was a living silence between them in the busy restaurant, almost as if, if Harry dared to breathe too loudly, he’d never get the chance to hear what Malfoy said next.
Harry, nervous, shot out his right hand for Malfoy to shake. The other wizard just stared at the appendage. Much too long if you were to ask Harry. He already felt ridiculous enough, did Malfoy have to rub it in? Resigned to the taunting of his life, Harry made to lower his hand before Malfoy took hold of it at the last second.
“I don’t think we’ll be needing the reservation,” Malfoy said to her, cold and detached. Harry’s stomach plummeted. This was it? After all this bloody time, it was over. Just like like that. “My sincerest apologies for the inconvenience.“
“You’re a bit of a distraction,” Harry stated. He took a deep breath and decided to do as he was told anyway. He picked up his small pot of clarified butter and began spooning the thin layer of milk fat off the top and placing it into a separate bowl. Needless to say it was a very un-sexy process, a saving grace to Harry if there was any hope of him finishing breakfast.
Harry: Of course not! I would NEVER purposely keep Teddy from a family event. He and Andromeda had tickets to see a show. We didn’t know Hermione was going to propose this week.
Prongs: Before things go TOO FAR? What the fuck, Hydra? We’ve been talking for months! Where are you? Because, personally, I’m in pretty damn ‘far.’
Prongs: Well then what are we doing here? We’ve talked almost every day for over a month. We’re compatible in more ways than one, yet you don’t want to meet? How the hell am I supposed to take that?
? To the confession, to the uncharacteristic sincerity, to the traces of longing Harry wished didn’t feel so relatable. Harry motioned for the bartender, silently ordering them another set of drinks. Neither of them dared speak until they arrived.
Harry: I’d say your actual daddy issues have at least a little to do with it…but yeah, sure, blame who you need to.
Malfoy sat back down on his stool stiffly, a hint of a smile a the corner of his month and a glint of hope in his eye. Despite it all, it made Harry’s heart do a little jump to see it.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled before jumping in again. “Sweet pea, keeper of my soul.” His eyes didn’t leave Draco’s. “I know sometimes I’m out of control.”
“Fuck you, Potter!” He stood up, straightening his slacks in the process. This struck Harry as very odd. Why Malfoy cared if his pants wrinkled at a time like this, was absolutely lost him. It was almost funny and when combined with the absurdity of the evening, Harry was left with the inapropriate task of stamping down a laugh.
Draco: Turn off mind message, you dork, I’m hearing double. One Potter in my head is more than enough, thank you!
“And they said we couldn’t compromise,” Malfoy teased. Harry rolled his eyes, if only to skive off the absurd impulse he had to giggle.
Ron: Ever since Ginny and Pansy moved in together, Mum’s been really pushing the marriage and kids bit. Worried about grandchildren or some rubbish like that.
Draco: Did you ask my aunt and cousin not to come tonight so you wouldn’t have to introduce me to him.
Then he was fucking into Harry, shoving forward as Harry used his remaining energy to push back. They settled on a hard, erratic rhythm that was sure not to beget longevity. Draco thrust in, angled perfectly to ignite that spot inside him.
“You’re funny!” Teddy proclaimed, mood changing with the air in room. “Can he stay for dinner?” Teddy asked Harry.
Harry: One can only walk in on their mates shagging so many times before it causes permanent neurological damage.
the distraction?” Both Draco’s hands began a path up Harry’s bare chest. Harry’s breath hitched, feeling everywhere Draco touched like fiend fire licking at his skin. “When I had to watch you walk around yesterday evening like this,” he found Harry’s nipples, rubbing at them with the pads of his thumbs. Harry sighed, pushing his chest into Draco’s hands. “And because of the presence of my cousin,” Draco continued, “I could do nothing about it.”
“Bend over. Hands flat on the counter,” Draco commanded, sounding pissed. Harry couldn’t spread his legs fast enough. “If you so much as lift a pinky, I won’t let you come.”
“Salazar, Potter, put your wand down!” Draco Malfoy said, looking gobsmacked.  He stood, stiff as a wand handle, in Harry’s fireplace, his hands raised above his head like a criminal.
Harry: Yeah, Dudley's band sucks but it’s nice he has a dream.  And I warned you on the way here that the venue would be a little rough around the edges.
Harry, for all his planned misbehavior, melted into it. He pressed himself further against Draco and rolled his arse against him, reaching back with his right arm to a get ahold of Draco’s neck. He let his tongue glide against the other man’s, let the arousal coiled in his center release itself into the kiss.
Thank you all for your REVIEWS, LOVE and PATIENCE! I do this for you all and the response has been amazing so far! I could not be happier!! :)
Harry: I think he’s going to be pissed you stole his show. But you’ve done well, it really does suit him!
Theo: Suppose it is, yeah. Can’t live on Granddad’s galleons forever, can I? Then again, here I am chatting up the air to Sleekeazy’s. What do you think, would I make a good trophy husband?
Greenviper: Collins is a very famous English dictionary, Prongs. The two of you would get on appallingly, no matter how much one of you would benefit from the introduction.
I'm the worst!!! but don't throw things at me, this cliffy was ALL Syn-the-beta. I was going to write more but she said this was a better place to end the chapter. How's the view, Syn, from under that bus?
Ginny: ‘Mum, Ron was talking to me about Gran’s ring the other day. I think he’s finally ready to propose!’
This chapter destroyed me. There is none of me left. Syn Beta'd so hard! SO HARD! I OWE HER A LIFE DEBT! Some scenes had to be rewritten multiple times. I had a bit of a breakdown where I forgot words and I cried in my car to "being alive" from company because I think it is basically Harry's anthem in this fic! Anyoo, I hope you enjoy the product of my blood, sweat and tears! Comments and love are always appreciated.
“Wait, you think – ” Harry began, laughter overtaking him before he could explain that Teddy was, in fact, not a witch Harry was cheating on Draco with.
Harry: "Yeah… I know you didn’t want to use the Floo network for the delivery but the giant fireplace in the kitchens looks like our best bet at the moment."
Harry: Am I really? Because Kreacher was doing me a favor today and I asked him to pick up those caramel cauldron cakes from Madam Puddifoot’s you love so much.
Prongs: Just yesterday you were going on about how much you fancied me. Mind telling me what happened between now and then to make you act like a total prat!
“Now, if you ever want to stop what we’re doing, curl your hands into a fists and bang them on the counter.” His voice was serious. “Do it so I know you understand.” Harry complied immediately, touched because even in the heat of their play Draco was so careful. He cared.  “Good.”
“I just want some fucking time,” Harry said desperately. “You’ve had months to process this. I’m asking for more than half an hour.”
“Fuuuck,” he called like prayer. His head swung up, back arching in the process, like he’d reached some sort of higher plane, his orgasm frozen in time. And that’s what it felt like, too, Draco fucking him through it, singing his praises.
Unfortunately, not even his blossoming love affair with a piece of clothing could assuage the nervous anxiety radiating through his body. He’d verified that he was apparating to the right location about three times and checked to make sure he was still breathing another four. Of course, he’d already began a human to human communication with Nott, but what if he was pissed off Harry hadn’t told him who he was at the ball. What if his ignorance embarrassed him and he lashed out, thus ruining what could have otherwise been an incredible evening? And above all else, what if it turned out that they didn’t even work well together. Perhaps their banter wouldn’t transfer over to reality or he was still involved with the Death Eaters and this had all been an elaborate plot to kill Harry…
Greenviper: You can’t know that for sure and I can’t be expected to rely on your flimsy Gryffindor instinct, can I?
Draco: "I slide two fingers into the knuckle." *Whimpering* "I go right to the place I know will – FUCKING HUH f-fuck!"
Greenviper: How wonderful for you. You are an example to us all. May I continue my lament about muggle shops?
“That wasn’t so hard, now was it?” There was a semi constant stream of tears as Harry adjusted to the feeling of his mouth being filled so completely. It was painful, hard to breathe and glorious in every way imaginable. Harry rubbed his aching cock against smooth wood of the cabinet to give himself some relief.
“Daad,” Teddy called in a sleepy voice. There was no mistaking that. Draco leapt off Harry’s lap, practically flying off the bed. It would have been funny if the situation wasn’t so – not.
Ginny: You’re Welcome! The team gets broom prototypes all the time so it really wasn’t that big of a deal.
“Love you, Ted!” Harry called back. He shook his head as he watched them leave the room. He ran his hands through his tangled, morning bird’s nest, wondering what demon had possessed Ginny Weasley and which method was best to exorcise it.
WARNING: This chapter is much longer and much smuttier than most chapters. There is Dom/Sub content as well. You have been warned. Oh, and you might need this at some point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50Qo62s8QNg
“Draco no!” Harry cut him off, forgoing the whiplash-inducing head turn and whirling around completely to intercept his godson.
Harry: Why not? It’s true. One day, Hermione, you’re going to face the fact that when you get home from work you and Ron have each other. You don’t have to go to the store alone, or cook alone or eat dinner alone. There’s no cooling off after a fight because you’re stuck in the same house and you just have to deal with each other. That’s family!
“Shit!” Harry squeezed his eyes shut as Draco adjusted so he was hitting the mark with every, practiced thrust. Harry grasped, frantically, between his legs, impressed by just how wet he was. He smeared the pre-come over his prick and began to stroke, moaning into the relief of it. He was so sensitive, the head of his cock red and poking out of his foreskin, he nearly feared the intensity of his building orgasm.
Harry lifted his head, jerking it, lazily, in the direction of his open bedroom door and called upon his magic to grant him this small favor in his time of need. There was a loud rustling, the sound of drawer opening, closing and then a bottle hurtled toward them.
Prongs: My screenname works so easily. You get to call me ‘Prongs’ but what do I call you? Green? Viper? If I call you Viper, you have to own a leather jacket. It’s a rule.
Prongs: I get you’re mad at me for reasons you’ve still yet to inform me of, but come on, Hydra, I know you must be a little thrilled at the idea of meeting me.
Neville: I wanted a challenge for the Newt students. I’m up against Matilda Spore at Beauxbatons who practically revolutionized modern magical herbology. I didn’t want the transferring students to feel like they got the bad end of the wand when they got me as their professor.
McGonagall: When I was a girl, I too fell for a man that seemed wrong for all the logical reasons and, for that matter, so did your mother around the same age. She chose her heart and, though unfairly short, I believe those years with your father and later you were the best of her life. While I am not one for regrets, I have plagued myself with decades of wondering. You do not want to wonder.
Ginny: Just be yourself, Harry. That’s the point of this, yeah? You’re a simple guy. Don’t overthink it.
I really need to thank @synonym4life this week because they beta'd the heck out of this chapter, even adding some brill lines of their own. How did I get so lucky? who knows? but I'm not going to question it!
Greenviper: For the record, I’m not a stalker, however, I noticed you haven’t even logged onto the app in three days. Are you OK?
Draco pulled back, Harry followed, mouth watering, like a Crup being deprived of his treat. Draco tightened the hand that held Harry’s jaw and turned him to face his burnt and forgotten breakfast. Harry did a quick wandless spell to turn off stove and waited.
Harry: Yes. Unfortunately, yes. It has happened and I am blind. My eyes will NEVER come back from this.
Prongs: Haha I don’t care that your bigoted family is in Azkaban. Dead chuffed about it, if I’m honest.
Ginny: It shouldn’t take a Ministry ceiled piece of parchment to validate my relationship in the eyes of my family. I say I love her, that should damn well be enough. Percy’s only been dating Audrey for five months and she already gets invited to family dinner.
My Beta was wonderful this time around AND I DO MEAN WONDERFUL! So, I wanted to do something special for her. What did I do, you ask? I wrote her fluffy, cheesy, sappy poetry like my girl Ginny Weasley!
Draco: "I push you onto your bed. You look up at me, bewildered. This isn’t how you imagined things going, all those times you fantasized about us, but you like it."
Ginny: I can’t explain it. She pisses me off more than anyone but she also makes me giddy, horny and terrified all at the same time. Sometimes I think I’m addicted to the way she makes me feel.
Prongs: Looking for a Scottish slag on the side. Someone to warm my frigid bed whilst we’re apart. Neville’s already turned me down, see.
Draco: No, I know the names. In chronological order:  Aunt Murderer Weasel, Born-to-be-muggle Weasel, Attractive Genetic Anomaly Weasel, Dragon Weasel, Swotty Weasel, Auditorily Challenged Weasel, Worst Weasel, Soon-to-be Mrs. Granger-Worst Weasel, Potty Weasel and, last and almost least, Weaselette.
Greenviper: In any case, it’s obvious to anyone with an IQ greater than 95 where I stand in this. I would not be trying this hard if I weren’t interested.  I generally needn’t put in any effort at all.
“So you regret getting to know Hydra, then?” Malfoy pushed, looking, for lack of a better word, terrified of the answer.
“Sounds more like the six “s’s” of sucking cock,” Harry blurted, remembering himself too late and turning a shade of red one doesn’t often see outside of December.
“No, but only with us, yeah?” Teddy nodded. He looked from Harry to Draco as if he couldn’t quite believe his luck and said, “Fuck’um,” then laughed.
“Well which one is it?” Harry said, raggedly “Do you want me to count or shut my mouth?” Draco laughed then too and Harry’s heart swelled with pride.
“You’re still not counting,” Draco admonished. Harry laughed, voice coming out a bit madder than he’d meant it to. He took a steady breath.
Harry: "RIGHT THERE! Don’t stop, please don’t stop! I’m so close!  Touch yourself. Please touch yourself. Touch me! I’mmhmm s-so close!"
Draco: "I assume you only have beer. Instead, you bring out a dusty bottle of Ogden’s with a ridiculous grin on your face. You’re very proud of yourself."
A lot of you asked me for an update when I started posting the Ginsy companion piece, well chapter one is up! It is a story about how Pansy and Ginny get together and will eventually overlap with the Howlr plotline, so you'll get a bit of Howlr from Draco's pov. This is a quick preview, if you like it check out the rest
Draco: As soon we’re not surrounded by your fan club, you’re going to thoroughly regret saying that.
Neville: Well…Since I can’t move, you have to take my place as head of the party planning committee and finish the last minute preparations for the ball.
Draco was on him again, kissing him like they’d been apart for  weeks as opposed to mere minutes. This time, it was Malfoy weaving his hands through Harry’s impossibly messy hair. He was the one moaning wantonly at every brush of their cocks.
His hand picked up speed, giving long, tight pumps as he thought about how many times he’d fantasized about this; hard and wet in the showers after a match against Slytherin, late nights in a tent in the middle of a war, at a meeting, reading a flirtatious message from Hydra. Draco was wrong. Harry never needed to view this new version of Draco separately from Hydra or the git he went to school with, he just needed to combine the love he already had for all three of them.
Then Draco took hold of Harry’s leather jacket, relished the feel of the material in his hands, and removed Harry Potter from his front door.
“No.” He was sure of that. He was. And he sounded it too, when he said it to Malfoy. But just so he’d really absorb the message, Harry said it again. “No! I’m sorry Malfoy but you’re mad if you think that. I didn’t.”
“Malfoy,” Harry began, determined not to look at him any longer. “I don’t mean to be rude but could you move down a seat, I’m meeting someone.”
Harry: Did you and Parkinson have another fight? Did Luna stand you up for Rolf again? Did you only score 50 points in the match as opposed to your usual 3000 again? OH, oh, oh did your Mum introduce your gf as your roommate…again? Forgive me if I’m less than shocked by your continuous cycle drama.
Hermione: We’ve sorted that all out. He’s going to spend the night with Bill, Fleur and Victoire. He loves her!
Hermione: That is a totally natural response to have when the child you help raise says that, Harry. You should not feel guilty.
Harry: You think it’s been ‘hard’ on me? You can’t even begin to imagine what this feels like. They all leave me. My parents, Sirius, Dumbledore. Fuck, even Hedwig. Every time I start to feel like I’ve finally got a family, it gets taken away from me.
“Can you sing now?” Teddy asked. Harry took a deep breath. He gave Draco a fleeting glance only to receive a raised eyebrow in return.
Prongs: Hydra, Hydra, Hydra…I know you’re gagging for it, but I already told you I can’t send you a dick pic.
A bitter, guilty, part of Harry wanted to point out that perhaps he could better understand pureblood prejudice aimed at  children if he hadn’t been so busy dolling it out, but instead he said –
Harry: "Nothing dearie, just making sure whatever story you’re about to tell lacks its usual… color."
Harry: Not possible. She’s the only other person I know that has as big a hard-on for plants as you.
Ron: ‘I know. Couldn’t sleep. Hermione Proposed, mate! I’m gutted I didn’t get to ask her, tell you the truth, but, FUCK, I’m getting married!’
AS ALWAYS, a size-kink thank you to Syn, who is the world's best Beta (I mean no offense)! We work so well together and she sacrificed studying for her exams to get this chapter to you faster and I love her and she's perfect and (oh yeah) enjoy the final chapter!
Neville: For now. You’re on a fast track to DADA and you know it. Hogwarts is about to reopen for the first time in five years. It’s a crucial time for the British wizarding world and we’re a part of that. We can’t afford to slack off.
“Might I make a suggestion,” Malfoy said, picking up and flipping through his menu. Harry nodded, perhaps too enthusiastically. “May I please order for us? You’re bound to choose something safe and bland and I, generous wizard that I am, will end up taking pity on you and giving you half my plate.”
Harry: Gin, could you maybe just let her back into the flat, you don’t even have to forgive her. I would just really like Draco to talk to me again? Pretty please!
Draco brought his hand to Harry’s cheek and kissed the skin just below his left ear. “Don’t tell me you’re not happy to see me,” he said, then had the audacity to chuckle with the cockiness of a wizard who knew there wasn’t anything further from the truth.
Ginny: Lol Talk to my twat of a brother. If I say something, it’s a ‘thing.’ If you say something – it’s gospel.
“What?” Harry was thrown off by the mention of the other Slytherin, in large part due to the fact that he’d hardly given him a second thought since he saw Malfoy sitting at the bar.
Prongs: Virtual admirer? Is that what I am? I mean I could be your boyfriend but apparently that would ‘ruin’ things.
Hermione: Hush, Ronald. I politely sit across the dinner table from Percy every week and it was he who stood by the ministry while they were stripping muggle-borns of their wands. People change.
McGonagall: "Don’t sound so surprised, Mr. Potter. I have rebuilt a school from rubble, you’ll find I’m more than capable of operating a mobile spell phone."
Greenviper: Is this your subtle way of asking me to kiss your arse, Potter? A public rimming is a bit kinkier than I had in mind for a first date. But who am I to refuse the Chosen One?
“Why don’t you make the same recipe twice? I know you’re not exactly the perfectionist type, but surely someone who enjoys cooking as much as you do would at least…”
Harry’s chest and head felt like they were battling to see which one could cause him the most pain and they were both winning.
Harry: “Err, I’m really sorry! Could I add an order of cinnamon sticks and the double chocolate chip brownies”
Hermione: No, last time you'd just broken his heart and the time before that, well, he had you, didn’t he?
Draco tipped Harry’s head toward the ceiling, giving him full access to Harry’s neck. He used his other hand, fingers smooth and elegant, to pet at his throat. How fucking odd. How fucking odd that Harry was turned on by it. He gulped, feeling his Adam’s apple bob beneath Draco’s hand. Draco hummed appreciatively and Harry felt it throughout his entire body.
“You just don’t,” Malfoy repeated, disapprovingly. “What a conversationalist you are.” Harry took a heaving breath and placed his menu on the table next to his plate.
Greenviper: You are a complete dunderhead, so much so that I worry it might be contagious. I do not say ‘I like you back’ because I am not a randy fourth year trying to score a lush date to the Yule Ball.
Prongs: I’d Twist and scissor in your hole as I wrapped my mouth around the swollen head of your prick.
“My, how presumptuous we are,” Malfoy said, utterly oblivious to what Harry was going through.  “I was under the impression that all that fan-seeking nonsense I used to spew was – “
“I assure you, I just had an exceedingly satisfactory breakfast,” he reached a hand down to rub at Harry soar bum, “I’ll thank you to remember.”
Draco: "It’s a potion I invented. I took the alpha draft. Where ever I touch myself, you can feel it on your body. For example, this is my hand on your inner thigh. And this…"
Draco: Yes, I’ve heard the story. I have the story memorized. Get me an agent, I could perform the story drunk, exhausted and while doing a headstand on a broom.
“Yup,” Harry cut him off, knowing he could do nothing about the situation in his pants and couldn’t bear to think about what Draco was going to do to relieve his. “There’s a small dresser in there, feel free to borrow some pajamas from the third drawer."
Prongs: Sorry, I know it’s kind of weird to have a blank photo on a dating app but it’s for my privacy. If we hit it off I’m fully prepared to meet, though! :)
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, a bit flushed. “You can’t know how much unfair shite Teddy gets for it. And right now he’s five and adorable, what’s going to happen when he gets older?”
“You’re perfect,” Draco said as he spread Harry open and pressed the tip of his tongue forward and into Harry. Harry’s toes curled and his back spasmed.
Pansy: I’ve pulled three looks for you for the ball tomorrow.  I need you to select one and I’ll take care of the rest.
“I didn’t say I regretted it,” Harry began, “but that’s beside the point,” he let more whisky blaze a path down his throat, “because you’re not really
Ron: Hey Harry, we’re all meeting at 3 brooms tomorrow night to celebrate your Birthday! The theme is muggles!! Kiss kiss, see you there. Bye!
“Malfoy!” Harry anxiously looked over his shoulder to see if anyone had heard. He could feel his cheeks flaming and he wished to Merlin they would stop. He also wished he could stop thinking about that night Malfoy was referencing and all the other great nights he’d spent chatting with Hydra.
Hermione: Since when are you the expert on gay relationships, Ronald Weasley. Is there something you’d like to share?
Harry: So what if you’re young. I don’t know any two people that are more ready. You’re practically married as is, if you waited any longer you’d just be biding time. Not to mention you are the most prepared and logical person potentially on the planet. I don’t think you could have left the store with that ring if you didn’t know it was right.
“Uhh – yeah,” Harry said, both terrified to move his hand and nervous that, if he didn’t, Malfoy might hit him. “I’ll have a working floo in my chambers. In case, I don’t know, you were worried… or something.”
Ginny: Pansy thinks it’s because I’m jealous. She says that’s the real reason I was so mad when she didn’t tell me Hydra was Malfoy.
Harry: No. You and Ron are a family. You’ll get married and have kids that will also be your family. Ginny will have Pansy and Neville will have Hannah and Teddy will have Andromeda and I’ll just be a side relative everyone calls uncle but doesn’t actually belong.
Feeling he’d gone through the motions, Harry was just about to head into his room and ‘find’ Teddy when his living room Floo roared to life. Harry had a warded Floo; few people knew the address and the ones who did knew not to show up on a Teddy day.
Ooh it just got better, “back in my day, they did all the shirt lifting in private and disease took care of it eventually.”
Draco: Well, there you have it. I don’t see why you feel the need to support him in the first place.
Ginny: Of course not. But when we broke up, I lost my place in your life. You all never let me into your perfect little trio but at least while we were together, I had a reason to get some of your attention. You’re my best friend, Harry, and I was fine playing the role of the one that got away because it meant you still wanted me around.
“That’s a little bit dramatic, don’t you think?” Harry replied in hushed tones. Draco lips curved into a manic smile and Harry was suddenly reminded of the genes he shared with Bellatrix Lestrange.
“We’ll be leaving too, I’m afraid,” Ginny said, suddenly suspiciously in a rush. “Enjoy the rest of your morning.”
Please remove me from this fucking place! You were the only person I could think to scream my feelings into the void at.
Grey eyes flashed, as Draco let the non-verbal dare wash over him as if it were fourth year all over again. Back when the rivalry was fun, petty and arguably flirtatious.  He gripped Harry’s jaw, firm, roving his thumb over his lower lip. Harry pulled the digit into his mouth and sucked at the tip. The act completely consumed him, he savored Draco’s thumb in a silent promise. He called the whole thing into his mouth and sucked at it like he wished it were the other man’s cock.
“So what’ll it be, Ted?” Harry said, hours past the metamorphs bedtime. Harry couldn’t be blamed, of course, if Draco hadn’t shown up with his unending insistence that Harry give Teddy everything he wanted, he would have been in bed at the proper time. But as it were, Harry had agreed to two desserts, multiple games of exploding snap and a promise to take Teddy and Draco on Sirius’ old motorbike over winter vacation.
“Auntie Ginny!!” He jumped up, stepping on Draco in the process, (“Oof”) and ran into her arms. She swung him around, flipping the boy over her right shoulder then back over her left. Her defined, quidditch muscled flexed as she worked.
of the kids at your school don’t understand. And that’s their fault, not yours.” Teddy’s head remained hung and his lips were pulled into a deep frown. “Hey,” Harry brushed back his hair, dipping his head to meet his eyes, “what’s Auntie Ginny say about people like that?” Teddy grinned.
Greenviper: Would you rather be stuck on a desert island with Morcott for a year or live the rest of your life without magic?
“Edward Remus Lupin, say that you’re sorry right now. We do not use that language no matter who you learned it from.”
“Potter,” Draco cleared his throat. He dusted the floo powder off his fitted blue trousers and grey button down. “I should have texted first.”
Harry: I probably wouldn’t have invited you but not for the reasons you think, ok. To start, as much as I love him, Teddy is a handful and requires all of my attention. I would have had to keep abandoning you in a room full of Weasleys, which, you now, I’m sure you would have LOVED! And honestly, Draco, you aren’t exactly a favourite around here. I wouldn’t want Teddy to meet you surrounded by people that might negatively influence his opinion of you.
In light of your recent engagement, Harry James Potter is officially kicking, best friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger out of his flat.
texted,” Draco segued, the mischievous look on his face transfiguring the mood of the room, “then I’d probably miss the chance to see you walking about your house in nothing but your joggers.” Draco looked Harry up and down, pausing, lip wedged between his teeth, to admire Harry’s firm abdomen. “A true loss, I assure you.”
Harry: Hey, I know this is your lunch break but I really need some of your magic. Neville and I have been trying to get a hold of this band Casting Castles that’s supposed to be performing for the ball but they’ve been giving us the runaround. Their twat of a manager just gives one word responses and that’s if he decides to pick up at all.
Greenviper: I’m trying not to take this personally. Have I misplaced a fight somewhere in my memory?
“But I don’t understand, why are the Veela and the werewolf fighting in the first place?” Draco questioned, attempting to have a logic based conversation with a five-year old. “I’m pretty sure they don’t even occupy the same re - “
Neville: You don’t need to plan it. It’s already planned. You just have to manage and make sure everything’s in place on time. I will be here to help via Spellular in any way I can.
Pansy: You’re a fucking hypocrite, Weasley! If the roles were reversed, there’s no way you would have given up Potter if he asked you not to say anything.
It took so long for the other man to respond that Harry broke his rule and turned toward him. Malfoy had two fingers pressed to his right temple to show Harry just how inconvenienced he was by his presence.
“I forced Pansy to confirm it when she and the Weaselette found your profile, but I’ve known since you sent me the books.”
All these pieces are by designers that draw inspiration from popular muggle designers. I know that’s important to you.
Harry: Thank you guys. I’m really embarrassed. I’m not sure what to say other than thank you for caring.
Hermione: "No, Mr. Brewer, I’m Flooing in regard to the Hogwarts Ball your clients are scheduled to play at tomorrow."
Harry: "Yes –  please! I’m begging you, fuck me open! Hard and messy. I want to feel you. I want to know you’re doing the same thing to yourself."
Ron: Well, you know Hermione’s been traveling for work a lot lately. So I was having myself a bit of a wank and I got carried away and now I think I’ve ruined a set of her old Hogwarts robes.
Harry: Neville, Neville, Neville, Minerva could never be mad at me. I saved her school, if you’ve forgotten.
“You’re such a bratty sub,” Draco said. He kneaded at the red, marked globes that were once Harry’s arse, occasionally tracing over bits of raised skin. Harry was going to feel this well into next week. The thought made him shudder; sitting in the Great Hall, preparing for classes, no one knowing why he kept wincing.
Harry: Moving on… The queer male Slytherins from our year are Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini. Blaise is pretty openly pansexual, though. So that just leaves Nott.
Sorry for the late update, the Beta and I were both traveling last week and didn't have time to fic. This chapter is twice as long, however, so you can't be too mad!
Syn, my exceedingly brilliant Beta, has said many a time that she hates me for that ending...Sorry!?!  Anyway, thanks for reading and reviewing! We're having such great conversations, it's a dream come true!
Hermione: "I don’t know many other witches with the last name ‘Ganger’, as I’m sure you’ll find there’s but one Wizard left with the last name ‘Potter.’ But in case you’ve forgotten, he defeated Voldemort. It is him you’ve been dodging the past two days."
“Gree –“ Harry hadn’t finished the word before his legs were legs kicked open and his trackies vanished. Draco’s breath was hot at his ear.
Malfoy waited, rooted in his spot, far too close to Harry and looking confident beyond any reasonable doubt that he was right. Was he right? Who had Harry pictured during those late night phone calls, whose voice had he been expecting to hear? When Hydra swore to Harry that he had changed, why was the mere thought of Malfoy enough to understand and believe him.
Harry: I’ve already taken the liberty of transporting your belongings to your old house. Anyway, we needed to rip off the plaster sometime. I move to Hogwarts next week.
“No,” Harry said, stammering so much this time he scarcely convinced himself. But what Malfoy was saying was ridiculous. It could not be true. Harry didn’t know who Hydra was? He had wanted to know so badly at every step, didn’t he? It had kept him up at night. But then again, Harry spoke Parseltongue without realizing it wasn’t English. He’d spent years letting certain images of blonde pop up in his dreams and had managed to convince himself he was straight.
McGonagall: You are lucky in that often when you make mistakes, they work out for you in the end. In any case, if this man faults you on one mishap then he is probably not worth the trouble in the first place.
Harry laughed. Teddy zoomed around the living room chanting a chorus of “He gets to stay, Cousin came to play” and Draco made a futile attempt to conceal his smile a final time before giving in. It was the first time Harry had ever seen him look this happy and it was peculiar because it didn’t really suit his face. Draco was all angles and beautifully sculpted lines but Michelangelo’s David was made to peer, pensively, into the distance not be charmed beyond restraint by angelic five year olds. Joy made Draco’s mouth much too big for his face and his nose scrunched up in the middle, creating waves of wrinkles beneath his eyes. Harry had never found him more attractive.
“How you did all the eating but I ended up stuffed.” Harry snickered, wiggling his eyebrows at Draco, proud of his joke.
Harry listened and laughed at the way every story Malfoy seemed to tell was a performance, embellished with a sense of suspense and an endless series of hand gestures. He was all at once exactly the same and totally different than the wizard Harry had known at Hogwarts or even the one he’d gotten to know over Howlr. It was so odd, Harry kept thinking, how he’d felt he’d known Hydra completely but in reality had known nothing about him.
Draco: "MMMM! Oooo-oh yeah, did I forget to mention it vibrates. I work it in and out. Feel yourself clamp down on it. L-let the vibration travel through your whole body."
“Stop,” Harry said, desperate to get that look off Malfoy’s face. “I’m doing a piss poor job of explaining.”
“I want you to count them,” Draco instructed. Harry nodded, eager for the next blow. When it came, Harry bit back a moan, he could take more than this. Draco could hit him harder. Harry wanted him to work for every sound he made, wanted him to earn his obedience. If there’s one thing Harry learned from switching, it was that the sub had all the control and he planned to take full advantage of that power.
Hermione: Stole his show? How many times do I have to tell you, there is no modern reason why it shouldn’t be the woman who proposes?
Harry: But you push me to go on more dates than anyone. You’re the reason I got on Howlr in the first place!
I fucked you like I’m falling in fucking love with you. Like I’ve been in love with at least four different versions of you all ready.
“Wait,” Harry said, throwing his hand out into the space between him and Malfoy as if the action would stop the other man from speaking. “I just need some time to think.” Of course, no such silencing gesture existed where Malfoy was concerned. If it had, Harry would have used it somewhere between, ‘My father told me all Weasleys’ and ‘I’ve got to do it.’
Prongs: Oh. LOL no! He and his boyfriend were only on a break at the time. He was not pleased when he found out we hooked up.
Harry: I told him he could call me ‘God Da’ if he didn’t like ‘Harry’ anymore.  He said that ‘Harry’ didn’t ‘define the relationship.’
“Mr. Malfoy your table is ready,” the cheery hostess informed them. She seemed to realize she’d walked in on something and suddenly looked like she wanted to bolt on the spot.
“Mmm,” Harry sighed, mouth slack, as he widened his stance. His heart was hammering against his chest.
“Crass but well played, Potter,” he’d said and Harry’s chest soared  with what he felt was a misplaced sense of pride.
Harry: Hey. Stop it! I am IN this. I don’t know why you keep looking for reasons why I’m not but I am! I woke up at five-a-fucking-clock this morning and made quiche for the Mother of a prat who let me wake up to a cold bed. All week I’ve chosen YOU over my family. I introduced you to my godson! And last night?
Hermione: You’ll do great, Harry. Remember, he already knows you. This is just another adventure you all are going on together.
“They can’t see us,” Malfoy said impatiently before distributing a line of playful bites down Harry’s neck. Harry whimpered, finally,
Greenviper: I thought you might. You have a terrible sense of humor and tend to gravitate toward the lowest hanging fruit.
“Fucking hell, Hermione’ s going to be impossible,” was all Harry managed to say. He knew other words existed in the English language, was even aware enough to realize those words sometimes came together to form a sentence, but at that moment his mind was far too busy flipping between late night chats with Hydra and corridor duels with Malfoy to even attempt such communication.
Pansy: I haven’t a clue what you’re talking about. But, if I did, however, I would caution you not mention it to Draco. He is practicing what we Salazarians like to call “Selective Sight.” A truly irreplaceable skill, as we see only what we want to see and ignore that which keeps our depressed mothers happy.
Harry: So it’s spirit week at Teddy’s school and today they’re supposed to dress up like a witch or wizard they admire. I walked in his room and he looked just like me.              Metamorphed himself a little scar and everything.
“Me?” Malfoy gesticulated with a flourish. “Are you put out, Potter, because I sound like…myself?” Harry felt an amused smile quirk at his lips before he could stop himself.
Harry made sure to make a big production of opening his own menu and began his search for the perfect dish that would wipe that smug smile right off Malfoy’s frustratingly attractive face.
“Not only are you rude,” Harry stated, emphatically, “but you’re wrong. I get my best recipes from restaurant menus and I rarley make the same thing twice, so I’m pretty much an expert at ordering at this point.”
Hermione: Just this, you know what the mind healer said, if you’re not going to go to therapy you NEED to keep up with the potions.
Ginny: This is the happiest relationship I’ve ever been in. This is the happiest I’ve ever been. period.
Draco: Her makeup is all over my bathroom, she keeps re-organizing my closet so I have no idea where anything is AND if I have to listen to her and the she-weasel have hate sex ONE more time, I’m going to pitch myself off the balcony.
Harry gave Draco a fleeting glance, hoping the blonde would save Harry the same way he’d been saving Teddy all evening. There was no such luck. Draco sat, gracefully next to Teddy on his bed and said, “Go on, ask your questions.” Teddy smiled.
He sauntered toward Harry, a look of concern on his face but chose not to comment on Harry’s apparent paranoia and what had inevitably caused it.  Harry was grateful for that and tried to let his embarrassment melt away with the tension in his shoulders. He could see it in his face that, at least, that was something Draco understood. He wasn’t going to make Harry talk about it or explain himself because he also had bad days, days stolen by echoes of a past neither of them asked for.
Fleur: Harry, I don’t mean to do this on your birthday but Teddy woke up screaming and he hasn’t stopped for the past two hours. He won’t tell us what’s wrong. He just keeps asking for you.
“You should have told me sooner,” Harry said, wincing at how accusatory the words sounded in his voice.
Ginny: *Singing: delightfully on key* Harry and Mal-foy romp-ing wil-low. Slytherin spunk left on your pil-low. *big finish (pun intended)*
McGonagall: Something like sending the phrase “cock it all up” in a message sent to the witch that employs you to teach children.
Harry, feeling rather brave for staying on his date with his childhood foe, was suddenly struck with the realization that he was going to have to be an active participant on this date with the aforementioned childhood foe. What on earth were they going to talk about? ‘Hey, still got those scars from when I almost killed you in a bathroom?’ ‘That’s right, my nose never did heal properly after you stepped directly onto my face, thanks for noticing.’
Harry: Which I agree with wholeheartedly, Hermione. Now, going on about how ‘ridiculous’ it would be to get married so he wouldn’t beat you to it is, however, devious.
“You should,” Draco insisted, scrambling to retrieve his wand from his abandoned trouser pocket, performing the spell then returning to Harry’s lap. He waited. “You may proceed.”
After that, Teddy steered clear of relationship questions, opting for the very important ‘who would win in a fight’ variety instead.
Pansy: Your beloved, Potter, wasn’t in any danger! Salazar, he defeated the Dark Lord, I’m pretty sure he can handle, Draco.
Lavender: "What do they think? That my staff’s going to roll it in on a neon bloody float or something? We are professionals, after all. We know how to be discreet."
His wand flew to his hand before he had time to think of the spell. He planted himself firmly between the fireplace and the hall that led to Teddy. He didn’t have time for a full on duel. He would have do a stunner, grab Teddy and apparate them to Godric’s –
Ron: Oh no, mate. Hey, there’ll  be other wizards. If you can get on this well with Malfoy, imagine what it’ll be like flirting with someone you can actually stand!
Greenviper: What’s wrong, Prongs? They’re already a threesome. They were practically made for this game.
“Says he who cast the first pillow,” Ginny replied. And then Harry was cackling too because he’d spent enough Sundays at the Dursley's to know how little sense that made.
“Oh –“ Draco said, eyes landing on the five-year-old at the entrance to the living room. Today he had dark black hair going in every direction, green eyes and a white-toothed smile that took up a quarter of his face.
Ginny: There’s nothing I can say that I haven’t already said. Howlr’s great! The queer wizarding populous is dreadfully low and still very shy. With the app, at least you know, yeah? And you’re always talking about how you wish someone could get to know you for you without the whole ‘I saved the whole bloody world’ thing getting in your way. Closet cases do Howlr anonymously all the time.
Andromeda: Yes, yes, he’s perfectly well but I have a checkup in an hour and I completely forgot it’s a half day at Wiz Kid? Do you think you’d be able to pick him up at noon? If not, I could always cancel my appointment. Of course, who knows what they’ll charge if I do that.
McGonagall: "Harry? This is Minerva McGonagall; Neville gave me your number. I trust that’s alright with you?"
“Are you two gonna kiss?” Teddy grimaced, looking equal parts disgusted and intrigued by the prospect. Harry laughed, cheeks growing ever redder. He picked up Teddy’s stuffed Hippogriff, placed it in his arms and put the boy to bed without another word.
Draco: "Fucking Salazar! I can’t do it. This is a failed experiment. I can’t tease you without teasing myself."
” She was saying his name in that awful way Harry used to to say it; hearing it come from someone else was worse – way worse!
Harry’s insides did a nervous flutter, thinking about doing that in front of Draco. It was much too early in this relationship for Draco to hear him sing. In fact, on their joint deathbed after seventy blissful years of marriage it would still be too soon. It wasn’t that he necessarily had a bad voice, it was just that Harry didn’t know because he didn’t sing in front of anyone excluding Teddy. Well, and sometimes Ginny but once you watch your girlfriend take six shots of fire whiskey in a row then attempt to deep throat you in the nearest loo only to vomit her burrito bowl all over your dick, you lose the ability to be embarrassed in front of her.
Draco pressed closer, sliding his half-interested prick against Harry’s. He was screwed. And not in the way he desperately wanted to be. What happened to the chaste prat that’d been making Harry work overtime for a mere snog? Despite the current (prominent) objections from other parts of his body, Harry wanted
Anyone who’s interested, message me by replying to this question: ‘If you ever met a very famous person, what would you say to them?’
” Harry didn’t mean it to come out like that. As if  the idea of Malfoy repulsed him to his very core but it sounded it anyway and he didn’t know how to take back the intention of words that he meant.
Hermione: Thank you, thank you. First, I’d like to thank boarding school and unresolved sexual tension.
, Draco was filthy in the best way, face red, eyes wild, hands trembling. Harry pushed back, maintaining eye-contact as he fucked himself on the tongue. Draco opened his mouth wide, holding his tongue out as straight as he could. Harry rocked back and forth until Draco curled his tongue inside him, keeping him in place. Harry’s balls drew up, painfully.
“We never managed to, actually,’ Harry said, absently, mind reeling at what felt like an impossibility. No, what
Greenviper: The earpiece is a Wheezes product. It lets us talk to each other as if it were a spell phone call except it alters the sound of our voices in case we know each other. I'm pretty sure it's intended for prank calls but I thought it could serve us just as well.
Prongs: No. Just don’t be surprised when I return the favor. Sarcasm is my parseltongue – skill acquired at birth.
Greenviper: And I never said I didn’t want a relationship. That’s the thing with you bloody Gryffindors, you plopped on this earth severely lacking the critical thinking skills necessary to see a view different than your own. Not all of us jump head first into heartbreak without looking back and that’s ok, Prongs.
Neville: Don’t forget you have an appointment with McGonagall at 12:30 to go over the agenda. You can’t be late, Harry, you’re already on thin ice with her.
“Well, it’s good to know someone can pick up my hints,” Malfoy continued on, “I was beginning to think I was the problem. Can you imagine?”
, beautiful face. “It was easy to put Hydra’s personality on Nott, on anyone else, because he was a clean slate, so to speak. He and I don’t have the same messy history you and I do. I mean, when I look at Nott, it’s convenient to see him as Hydra. When I look at you, I just see –
Now all eyes were on a pink-cheeked Draco Malfoy. “I thought I was a tosser,” he teased Teddy, to Harry’s chagrin. He’d much prefer it if the word was forgotten rather than become a staple in the boy’s vocabulary.
Harry: Could you sign one of your old jerseys and donate it to the Hogwarts ball as a raffle prize? Pretty please?!?
Greenviper: And I don’t want wizard’s wearing shorts under robes but one weird sister does it and now - here we are.
Hermione: "Now, back to business. As the event begins at 19:30, we expect the band to arrive at 17:00."
Dessert, Harry was pleased to find, was indisputably Malfoy’s favorite part of the meal. Harry recalled from Hogwarts that Malfoy had a rather large sweet tooth but after two hardy courses, he was beginning to wonder where his former rival kept it all. For Malfoy had not only eaten his entire slice of molten chocolate lava cake (which he proclaimed was ‘better than sex’) but also helped himself to a good portion of Harry’s salted  caramel pudding.
Greenviper: The Hostess is back, I’m letting her take me to our table. It’s in the corner by the window. If you’d like to escape, this would be the time to do it.
Pansy: In one of our brief and unfortunate times together, did I mistakenly give you the impression that I cared?
Draco: *Clears throat, speech is clipped and decisive* “Thank you for your inarticulate, grammatically incorrect confession earlier. I needed to hear it.”
Ginny: Yes… but tbh Harry that’s not such a bad idea for you. Besides, I thought I was going out with a hook up and they ended up being my soulmate.
Harry: You don’t remember giving me a blow job EVERY day in November then not so subtly asking me to do a publicity tour to promote your brother’s Spell Phone company?
Harry: Very true. We both know that despite years of torture, humiliation, and physical violence you were scribbling Mr. Malfoy-Potter all over your potions book. There’s no need to discuss it further.
Ron: NO! I was using a daydream potion and you need a physical representation … and sometimes she puts them on for me and it just REALLY WORKS OK!?!?
Arthur: I’m sorry Harry, but you need to hear it. Merlin knows you deserve to be happy, so if the Malfoy boy does that for you then we will, of course, welcome him. But you must know, not everyone’s thrilled at the idea.
“Both.” Teddy looked directly at Draco, giving him the same Crup eyes he’d been using on the Slytherin all night. This time, Harry had the wherewithal to head him off, shooting Draco a look that said ‘don’t even think about it.’ Draco sneered at Harry then gave Teddy an apologetic shrug.
It hit Harry then, like a full speed bludger to the head; the tone, the slight on Harry’s intelligence… It wasn’t supposed to be – couldn’t be – but, Merlin, how could it not be? The clipped drawl he heard in his head when he read Hydra’s messages, it was always right there in fucking front of him. Draco Malfoy. Draco Bloody Fucking Ferret Malfoy.
Harry: Sorry mate, can’t pass up the opportunity to defy gender roles and shit on the innate binary of the traditional wedding ceremony.
Greenviper: That’s how it was told to me as a child. I had an Aunt who said his ghost haunted Azkaban and that on Christmas Eve he stole all the presents from children who played with muggles.
Harry: Never. This has all been an unfortunate misunderstanding. You were merely a convenient vessel for my denial, nothing more. Further correspondence will not be necessary.
Prongs: Slide your hands slowly up your chest. Feel every inch of yourself. Play with your nipples until you squirm, then pinch them until you scream. That’s what I would do if I were there. You’ve promised beauty and I have a feeling you’re not exaggerating. I bet I get hard just looking at you.
Harry was struck with the image of a smaller and, believe it or not, poncier first year Malfoy offering Harry his hand.
Hermione: And we have always been a family, Harry! I’m closer to you and Ron then I’ve ever been to my parents.
Prongs: Well it tasted delicious! “Zagat rating 31 out of 30” “Can’t wait to see what he cooks next!”
Greenviper: You know what my family are like. They aren’t the best people, but they always loved me. How was I supposed to know all the things my beloved parents were teaching me was shit?
Hermione: I know taking Teddy back to Andromeda’s has been hard on you but you can’t shut everyone out like this.
Draco: *Strained and determined* "I coat a finger in lube and bring it back and forth against your rim. AH Ah Aa-and around the circumference."
The bartender placed what looked like a couple fingers of muggle whisky in front of Harry and another cocktail in front of Malfoy. Harry gave an imperceptible shake of his head, realizing too late that he’d  been staring at the impatient wizard sat next to him the whole time.
Draco: "I vanish your clothes, sitting at your feet – appraising you. It’s important to me, deciding which parts of you I want touch first. Eventually, I slowly slide my hands down your chest then back up your thighs."
Harry: Fuck. Sorry, I had to put down my phone. I was in a meeting. I didn't mean it in that way, Draco. I just meant that I want to spend as much time as possible with you before my life gets crazy. I DON’T want this to fizzle. I’m having fun. Aren’t you having fun?
“It’s a play on a Bible verse,” Ginny informed Draco coldly. He looked confused and isolated. Harry took his hand and squeezed.
“Teddy!” Harry gasped, cheeks coloring. Draco laughed sheepishly, looking to Harry for help. “Where did you even hear that?”
“Oh,” Harry said, breathing heavy. He didn’t want to be an arsehole but he could feel the disappointment written all over his face.
Hermione: Good point.  Harry, would you mind cross referencing how you flirt with Hydra with how you flirt with Malfoy in your fantasies and see if there’s any overlap?
“Dudley’s lyrics aren’t near so creative,” he protested. Draco moved from Harry’s ear to his neck, pressing what felt like – oh god – his hard length against Harry’s backside.
Greenviper: Oh, almost forgot, do us both a favor and wear something presentable. It’d be dreadfully anticlimactic if you turned up looking like a troll.
“I presume you’ll be moving to Scotland full time?” Malfoy played absently with the scraps left on his plate.
Greenviper: Don’t make me turn that train around, Potter. It’s only due to my immeasurable generosity that I allowed you to get on it in the first place.
“They were starving me,” he said flatly.  Ginny caught the pillow easily, crawled across the bed and hit Harry square in the face with it. Teddy cackled.
“Bum ars-e-tit,” Harry continued in a bad French accent. Draco promptly batting Harry’s hands away from him.
“Wait,” Harry said before he knew what his mouth was doing. “Do you think we could have a bit more time at the bar?” he asked the hostess. She looked between the two of them, a cautious smile on her face.
Harry: I pulled Theo (who is Hydra) at the ball. But Theo/Hydra doesn’t know I’m Prongs/Harry so now Theo feels guilty for liking the Harry he danced with and as a result Hydra is taking it out on Prongs. OR Hydra is using Harry to make Prongs jealous. Wouldn’t that be a mess?
Ron: So her Royal Highness of Lesbos graces us with her presence for the first time in weeks and she gets to pick the menu? We all know you’re only here because your gfs out of town.
Hermione: "Good. Obviously only I can hear you because I’m calling their office’s main floo, so just hold tight."
Harry: I’m supposed to have a date tonight but it’s with a person that’s all wrong for me. I’ve been talking to him for a while now but we’re complete opposites. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet and we already fight all the time.
Harry: *simultaneously* “You could just come over n - “   Draco: *Simultaneously* “I think it’s best if I do your hair my – “
“If you can’t take this,” Draco said, sounding on top of the world now that he’d finally gained the upper hand, “how do you ever expect to take my cock.”  Harry let out a frustrated growl around the towel.
And what Harry lacked in finesse, he made up for in sheer need, for when his lips finally met Malfoy’s after all those years, he thought he’d die if he couldn’t have more. He had never felt anything like it; being so desperate for something while it was actually happening. It was like being on his Firebolt and missing flying or craving Indian while eating curry; it didn’t make any sense, but it didn’t have to because he was kissing Malfoy.
A swirl of facts and feelings warred inside Harry, each demanding to be heard but he didn’t have time for that because Malfoy was going to leave and if he left that was it? If Malfoy walked out that door, there was no salvaging this. There was no Hydra or companionship or any of it. The thought seemed almost too much to bare.
Greenviper: Are you aware of the lack of punctuation in that message? Shall I bring Collins along on our date?
to be an impossibility. Malfoy was the unfortunately attractive bloke you wanked over, then hoped to never think of again. He was the pitiable arsehole you couldn’t help but save. He was the reformed childhood bully you made strained small talk with when there was no polite escape. He was certainly not the wizard that made your chest swell at every message, the man that gave you hope for a future previously perceived as improbable; he wasn’t Hydra.
Draco pressed in a bit further and Harry’s knees finally gave out. Chuckling, the other man wrapped his arm around Harry’s center to hold him up. He thrust all the way in.
Greenviper: Funny you ask, Prongs. As it turns, we have to work around the Azkaban visitation schedule.
hit Harry like a spark of life. He lurched forward, lower lip trapped between his teeth. This is what he wanted, had been pushing for, needed.
Ron: Well could you stop NOT doing it at dinner? You know Mum hates them at the table.  I think she’d ban them from the whole house if George hadn’t invented them.
Harry gawked at Draco, at a total loss for words when Teddy let out a tiny imperceptible laugh that bubbled within his tiny frame and emerged a full-fledged fit of giggles.
Draco: Yes, well she’s taken a fair few quaffles to the head so I wouldn’t quit your day job quite yet.
Prongs: Hahahahaha you should see the look on your face! Quick question, would it have made a difference if it was a wizarding toilet?
Ginny: I mean, honestly, first Dean, now Neville. Which one of my ex’s are you going to bugger next?
Harry: Teddy is my everything! We were watching the Series of Unfortunate Events movie, he turns to me and says “It’s good, I guess, but it would be better if it was like the books.”
Theo: I would be annoyed but I know how long you’ve wanted this! Have you told him of your string of doppelgangers? Never let it be said that Draco Malfoy doesn’t have a type. Could be the fittest bloke in the world but if he doesn’t have green eyes and the inability to use a comb…
“Good,” Harry said. He laid down on one of the vacant sides beside Teddy. He looked at the already slumbering boy, always forgetting how small he was until he watched him sleep peacefully.
“Salazar Potter, you heartless fool, look what you’ve done to my cousin.” Draco stared at the boy like he was the most precious crystal ball in his collection. “Do something,” he continued, “he’s about to cry!”
Hi friends and readers! I hope you're still out there, it's been a long fucking time! I won't offer excuses or apologize for my long absence because I've come to realize that taking the time off was what was best for me and the fic. I will, however, offer you an explanation. If you aren't interested in my life (fair) please read the warning and skip right to the chapter.
Prongs: Living my life…I know this might be hard for a narcissist like yourself to grasp, but the world does keep spinning even if you’re not at the center of it.
Hermione: Or Hydra is not Theo at all and he saw you dancing with Theo at the ball and is pissed because he thinks YOU’RE cheating on him.
Hermione: I thought it was odd, but did a fastening spell and let it go. Then I found a stain on my prefect’s badge.
Greenviper: It’s all well and good to say you fancy me loads when you haven’t even met me, but what happens when we meet in real life and I’m the opposite of what you expected?
Harry: "Yes. I’m really really sorry but we’re going to have to do this another time. T- Something’s wrong with my godson and I have to go get him. *Muttering* I knew he was too young to stay the night."
“You were right earlier,” Malfoy said by way of explanation. “You need more time to get used to the idea of us,” he lifted his head to look at Harry, “of me.” Harry wanted to go back in time and give his past self a swift kick in the shins.
Draco: "I slip the fingers into your mouth and flirt with your tongue." *Slightly muffled* "Can you feel them? On your tongue?"
Greenviper: I hate myself for it. I know it’s partially my fault but I meant what I said last week. The war really messed me up too.
Neville: Because I didn’t brew the antidote fast enough and I was only able to preserve about a quarter of my body.
“While your abysmal work ethic and utter paucity of self-preservation skills are unsurprising, I would have thought that the fucking vanquisher of the Dark Lord would have done a bit more research in this particular instance.” Malfoy had a crazed look in his eyes. “I’m surprised Granger let you leave the house.”
Greenviper: What a novel idea, I didn’t think of that. How incredibly fortunate I am to have been graced with your profound wit.
