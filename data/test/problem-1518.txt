But here he was, all the same, and short of tracking down a Time-Turner and attempting a re-do of the past few weeks, there was little he could do but accept that Potter was probably never going to quite be
Draco gave him a slow, patient blink that suggested he ought to choose his next words very carefully, as the implication Draco was bad at his job (where ‘his job’ had been instructing his own owl to fly to London and back inside of six hours) was bordering on offensive—and Potter held both hands up.
, especially when Potter kept insisting he stay human when they met in the Owlery because he felt ‘just weird’ talking to an owl all the time. Draco had news for Potter: that ship had sailed
“Er, well I’m…I’m getting rid of him, see. Giving him to a friend, and he’ll probably want to tag his new owl with his own band.”
There was a long, heavy pause, and when Draco dared flick his eyes back, just for a peek, he could see Potter’s lips pressed tight together, probably wrestling with the urge to say something nasty about Lucius, and Draco instinctively readied his own needle-sharp retorts.
“How did your parents take the news of your going back to Hogwarts, Draco?” Hermione asked, perhaps thinking Draco might be feeling left out of the conversation. From the way he winced at being pulled into their cheery banter, Harry doubted that was the case.
“Can’t I? Ask yourself—” he said, working a hand between them to fondle Harry’s cock through his pyjama bottoms, “—how
isn’t saying anything, and the attendants over at the Registry desk can’t divulge petitioner logs without a warrant. If you’d like to file a report, get a case file started, we can discuss that after we’re finished here, but otherwise—”
“All right,” Potter said, too easily, then crossed his arms over his chest. “And…what exactly were you expecting to
idea they needed to get on, and Draco meant to remind her in fashionable terms that just because he tolerated Potter didn’t mean she shared the same privileges.
"It is so fucking fun. Haven't you ever had cheese puffs? Licking off the cheese dust is the whole point,"
Harry’s hand is unusually cold in his own, but then again, so is Draco’s. He can feel it tremble against his grip, but thankfully, it doesn't seem worse than before, earlier that morning or last night. It’s not better, but not worse.
“Harry, we need to leave. Can you… can you stand?” He feels stupid asking this question, Harry shouldn’t be standing right now. He should-- What Harry needs is medical help, he needs to have his wounds treated and bandaged and then he needs a potion and then sleep.
"Get back to work,” Val, as usual, doesn’t rise to the bait. No one knows where Dumbledore is. “As long as you're not a threat, you're not in danger."
Any thoughts about Granger and Weasley vanish in the wake of the new revelation, "We're... we're friends?" he says dumbly.
Severus raises his eyebrow at the messy haired boy and then glances around the kitchen with narrowed eyes. "I consider this a victory." He hums. "Nothing is burnt beyond repair, the doors and windows seem to be intact," he sounds utterly serious in spite of his obvious mockery. "There are no corpses around the cottage, all things considered Potter." His eyes land back on Harry. "I'd say you handled yourself well for five days,"
"You should be working," she replies instead of rising to the bait, she turns away from him to the wall-length windows--now lacking their once opulent Green drapes--but he knows she still has eyes on him.
Rosier shoves him into the fireplace and before Draco can utter a word, he's stunned. All he hears before they floo away, is the young man shouting,
"Yes, my sincere condolences to Mr. Potter for his loss, and also the nine families of the muggles that perished, alas they will never know the truth. We will bring justice to those responsible, and make a fine example of them, let it be known that our Ministry is as strong as ever. Thriving on Justice, and the truth."
Rosier cackles above him, blood sluggishly running down his chin, one side of his face pulled down permanently as a result of a broken cheekbone. His eyes bloodshot.
"Yes, nice bonding experience,” Harry cuts in, wringing his left hand and bouncing his leg restlessly, “Am I going to die?"
This is utter madness, and Severus is aware of that. So acutely is he aware of the utter delusion his
When he wakes, some time after but not sure how long, he notices the lack of warmth, which is what woke him in the first place, his mind doesn't panic, but his body does.
"Can you walk by yourself?" he asks, and holds Draco upright by his waist, throwing one of the boy's lanky arms over his neck as he holds his wand in his other hand.
This is most likely the most surreal experience of his life. If this is what's bound to happen when he's just taking a walk, Harry shudders to think of picnics and Quidditch competitions from now on.
Potter is wheezing behind him, and a small part of Severus feels severely sorry that the boy is being forced to run in this state, but he doesn't voice his thoughts. They cannot afford the smallest mistake, as long as Potter is conscious then he can run.
He stares at Nott as Potter twitches on the floor. Draco is slumped over against the wall, his eyes closed, shirt bloody and face mauled, and Severus’s heart skips a beat. But then he sees his chest rising and falling, and Severus himself almost slumps in relief, before catching himself.
His heart sinks when he wakes up to an empty bed. Logically, he knows that Harry could have woken up early and is making breakfast, but the possibility is so laughably tiny, that Draco doesn’t really consider it. The other side of the bed is cold, and the cottage doesn’t smell of Harry’s cooking. There’s no humming sound coming from downstairs.
This all will also highlight how different Draco interacts with Harry compared to Ron and Hermione, even if it doesn't diminish their love for him.
“Wass’at,” he slurs. Draco gives him a half-hearted sneer as he pushes another vial against his lips.
The warmth from the Firewhiskey is spreading quickly through his body, but it does nothing to curb the hollow feeling beneath his ribs. And something akin to regret.
"Boiled carrots?" Harry asks again, now leaving the knife in favor of the peeler, which is marginally safer since Harry cannot physically peel his own skin with the muggle device. At least, that’s what Draco hopes.
Lucius hummed. ‘It’s not her, It’s the other one. Selene is too gentle with the child. Valentina seemed barely involved. The knight is laying low,’
It takes Draco another twenty minutes before he gingerly eases Harry into the seat and stands to stretch his legs. He inspects the washing machines with a keen eye, and moves on from row to row, whilst checking on Harry over his shoulder every now and then. He doesn't want a repeat of the barn accident, if he could call it that, again.
??" Rosier punctuates his word with a swift kick to Harry's abdomen. Harry's too winded to make a sound. "This isn't about him, Potter. This is just between you-" Another kick. "-and me."
dumpster. Food that could've touched anything. Infused with all sorts of muggle diseases. Made by them, thrown away by them.
She's not looking but Harry shakes his head nonetheless. He resists a slight shudder as he thinks about
"Not his most outlandish decision this year, have you seen how many detentions he has had with Dolores in the past month?" Minerva huffs, apparently on a roll.
Potter's wand lowers, and he's still just looking at Draco, as if he thought him incapable of making such allegations, or uttering those words at all. He seems bewildered, his mouth opens without a noise escaping. Draco waits for the response.
It really isn’t, but Potter is bleeding enough that the air in the bathroom is tinged metallic. And that’s a smell Draco isn’t particularly fond of.
The place is dark, illuminated by a few magically lit lamps that hang from a wall. He’s in a crypt of some sort, he realises belatedly. The vials in the bag clink loudly and there’s movement off to his right.
as it had ended Mrs. Malfoy's life, as it had done so many years ago his mother. And father. And Cedric.
"Thank you, Draco," Harry keeps his other hand, the one in the garbage away from him, but Draco reaches for it, and then lets Harry take them back to the dumpster.

There’s Harry, undoubtedly Harry, on the floor. His body twisted and trembling as he struggles to lift up his head. There’s another body, and it takes him a hot moment to recognise the disfigured, bloodied face of Evan Rosier.
Draco scrambles to his feet, his mother's wand slipping into his hand as he comes to stand in front of Harry. Both are looking at the closed door with bated breath. He is quite sure that neither of them breathe until the door rattles against the hinges, cringing and struggling, until with a stifled groan it opens and a dark robed man steps inside, his eyes swiftly taking in the surroundings until it lands on Harry and Draco standing in the kitchen.
"Do not test me anymore, Evan," Evan's head lolls back to stare into Malfoy's eyes, grey and blue ornate with streams of murkish blood.
"Slandering your name, and Potter's." Minerva sighs with a set jaw. "Oh for Merlin's sake! That boy's relatives just died!"
"Sort of," Harry tells him, his voice is so patient, so gentle, "They put this liquid, called petrol, into the car, and it powers the engine, and makes the wheels move."
It was just a dream. Nothing more. Even though he can't, for the life of him, imagine why he'd dream of such a thing. He had never even heard of half the spells Bellatrix had used. How had his mind come up with
"No, she has been using extremely low dosages, to prolong the suffering, I would imagine. It only worsened this dramatically as a result of the nerve soothers. Do not take any more unless I tell you or you've consumed the antidote."
“It’s cold,” Draco says, and mulls Harry's words in his head. 'Okay' in Harry's language is much milder in meaning than its other counterparts.
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, aftermath of self-harm, alcohol abuse, implied/referenced torture.
Severus arches a brow, "I'm not asking you to defend anyone and we're not in my classroom. I believe it would benefit us both greatly if you hurried this up, time is golden."
Harry has no time to react. Bony frail fingers dart out and close around his throat, freezing and slimy, they lift him off his feet and Harry's mouth opens in shock. He's beyond shocked.
Draco stares at Harry’s face, pinched with frustration and chewing through his lips. He raises a hand to free his lip from between his teeth, his finger, lingers on Harry’s lip and says, "Actually, I have an idea."
"Tell them to come over tomorrow,” he sits back down on the couch with a thump, “I'm too drunk to move about."
“We can’t. Too much blood, just-- just do it, Harry.” There’s a split second when he doesn’t think Harry will do as told, before sharp pain erupts from his shoulder, making him howl and his knees to buckle.
"No, I need to take a blood sample, though I'm fairly certain of the poison's nature. Still, we need to be diligent."
"Wow, they were hungry for sure," Harry marvels, and one of the birds hops back on his shoulder. Draco steers clear from Harry's bird cult and walks over to the counter, pulling out a kettle to fill.
But she is too fast. Of course she is. She's not a Ministry worker at all, she's a Death Eater. She throws up a wordless shield as her eyes spark with surprise and fury. "My, so bold. You'll just need to be put right back in your place, right, Mr. Malfoy?"
Harry flushes a little. They are mostly for Draco because he was being a git, but the blonde doesn’t even hate boiled carrots. Maybe he should serve them cold and soggy to him later.
"I feel like it's September first, with all these—" is the first thing he hears once Harry is jolted out of his bizarre dream. He ignores Draco and raises his head from the boy's lap, rubbing a hand over his clammy face.
Sirius' absence should feel significant in a moment like this, but with Draco's head on his shoulder, Harry doesn't feel the pang of anguish that was expected.
He extends a hand and lays his palm flat against the mirror, his back is also flush to the mirror behind him.
That was awful. So awful indeed that Harry wants to pour bleach into his eyes or down his ears just to get the images and the sounds out of his head.
His wand is well hidden but within reach, in the giant pocket of his sagging jeans as he walks. It's always on him. Lately, even breathing feels hard if he is without his wand. He feels too exposed, too vulnerable, too
"Minister Fudge will see you now," she says and slips into her chair again. Kingsley walks past her with an impatient frown. He cannot possibly think of a reason why Fudge would want to see him.
His wand slides further down his sleeve, and he looks around, assessing his surroundings, taking in the purring cats, the sickening splash of pink on every surface, the repulsive odor of her perfume. Before he can really do much. Umbridge has shut the door behind herself with a loud thud and is turning on him, her wand out and ready to attack, although not trained on him. He tenses.
He's seen it happen once, when they were in the cell together, the abrupt way Harry's eyes cleared and his head snapped to meet his.
Harry is giving cooking another chance, and so far, it is going smoothly. Well, as smoothly as possible under the circumstances.
"They kept you in a fucking cupboard,” he says, and while he wants to shout, he keeps his voice somewhat even and low. How can Harry be okay with this? “It will never not be a big deal."
"It is," There's another man in the elevator with them, plump and old with a long beard, hoisting a card box in his arms, as something widely wriggles and shifts inside, growling. He's probably from the lower floors, Kingsley thinks, the care and welfare of magical creatures.
The others, especially Ginny, give him a wide berth as well, and Harry's left feeling a little isolated as he glances at the severed house-elf heads that are mounted on the stairwell walls, and Crookshanks tangled in his steps as he walks. He eyes Sirius's mom's portrait as well, shuddering to think about the kind of house his godfather had been brought up in, which isn't a pretty image at all.
Potter is too slow, for some reason. She sends another stunner at Potter and the boy barely dodges the curse before lunging himself to the right, crashing into her decorative cat shrine upon a table. Draco stifles a groan and grips his wand tighter.
His fingers loosen around Harry’s wrist, ready to pull back. A small sigh whistles past his lips and Harry’s eyes flick down to their conjoined hands.

"Nothing. Nothing. Um, let's go," Draco says, standing up and straightening out his clothes. Sirius’ words echo in Harry’s head, but he squashes them down. They’re okay and Sirius isn’t here anymore.
"Leaving now, Severus?" Albus asks over his steaming mug. Severus just looks at him with a knowing frown.
"Come in," comes the muffled voice of the minister as Kingsley knocks. He turns the knob and walks in, softly closing the door behind him.
"Needs a bit more, I'd say," Umbridge isn't even looking at his scars, but rather intensely, sadistically staring into Harry's eyes. "Not for today," She drawls and lets go of his hand, reaching for her wand to clean Harry's blood off her fingers.
He observes as Potter's eyes don't shift and his pupils stay the same. Draco cautiously snaps his fingers near Potter's ears. Nothing.
The young man catches Draco's gaze, steadily holds it without an ounce of concern. He looks too young to be Rosier Senior, his father's former business partner. This must be the son.
"Just a misunderstanding, I'm sure," Fudge waves him off, ducking under his desk to seemingly reach one of the drawers and pull out a letter.
"Are we doing lines?" Ron finished for her, flopping down on the wooden chair Remus conjured with a swish of his wand.
Instead of withdrawing his wand, Evan Rosier waves it in a circular motion over his head and mutters a quick 'Silencio'.
They sit and eat in silence for a while. The sandwich, ham and cheese; Draco’s favourite, sits heavily in his stomach.
bad since Fourth Year. Perhaps he was letting himself go, now the war was over. What a waste of celebrity. “No, that’s fine. The post business, I mean. I don’t really care about that. After all—” He shrugged. “They weren’t all that private, aside from the exchanges with the bank. And you don’t seem half as eager to go running to Rita Skeeter with stories about me these days.”
Potter squirmed. “Yeah, I know but—I couldn’t remember if it was the East Library or the West you told me to—ow, wotchit, you’re gonna break my glasses!”
He considered—for only a heartbeat—simply stopping being such a prickly shit and just letting himself enjoy what it might feel like to really
Suddenly, he was somewhere dark, and quiet, and Potter was gently setting him down on something soft, carefully stroking the top of his head, the way he’d been petting the little Scops only moments ago. “There, you can change back now, if you like. Er, assuming it
And for the first time since Thomassen’s office, Draco paused to consider that, as little sense as it made, perhaps Potter

fling spells at Draco, entirely unprompted?! The nasty scars spidering across Draco’s chest, hidden underneath layers of feather and magic, pulsed sympathetically.
And Potter was treading on dangerous ground now—but then, so was Draco. Extended bouts of talking really did
Harry was astounded at the progress that had been made, even in the brief span that had lapsed since he and his friends had last dropped in to aid in the restoration. All of the towers finally stood tall and proud again, including Gryffindor, and the flagstones positively gleamed with Charmwork, no longer slathered in spilt blood or oozing residue from Dark spells. The Quidditch pitch, disappointingly, was still to be addressed, with the Ravenclaw tapestries still showing nasty scorch marks and sod waiting to be laid, but Harry didn’t doubt it would be in working order once more by the start of term.
Still, return he did eventually—and this time, he came armed with a wide-brimmed hat, hide gloves, and a healthy amount of wariness.
“The gesture is appreciated but wholly unnecessary.” Draco nibbled at his lip. “Just fuck me good and proper, and we’ll call it even.”
“Don’t try too hard on my account,” Draco leered, giving the tie a tug to secure it. “There; now you won’t embarrass me.” He grabbed Harry by the shoulders and spun him around to face the full-length mirror in the corner. Harry had to admit, Draco knew what he was doing. The collar was a bit high for his comfort, and he was still convinced he was overdressed for the occasion—surely a nice set of trousers and suit jacket would have been sufficient—but he didn’t dislike the man he saw staring back at him from the mirror, and given the way his eyes darkened, like a storm rolling in, Draco didn’t either.
. Draco didn’t know what to say in the face of such frank openness bordering uncomfortably close on affection, so instead he just said, whining a little, “…I don’t want to be an Auror.”
Potter had spotted him gliding in, though, and was ready—easily snatching up the Snitch the moment it fell within reach. Draco took a long loop around the hall, eyes trained on Potter as he made his way back to the skylight. Huddled amongst the Gryffindor scrum below, Potter held the Snitch close, frowning at the little note threaded through the ribbon Draco had used to tie down the wings when it wouldn’t stop flapping.
Harry grumbled, but his eyes popped wide as he looked at Draco and his intense stare. Harry could feel the heat shoot up to his cheeks. He could feel his own arousal pressed against his jeans, and Malfoy looked like he was in the same state.
Draco was extremely hyper aware of Harry's hands as he removed them from his collar. One trailing to the back of his neck, the other moving to cup Draco's cheek.
He looked up from his phone having been walking down to the quidditch pitch after Slughorns class. Hermione and Ron went to dinner while he snuck away. Not being in the mood to eat. His friends always helped to cheer him up, but nothing really changed in the real world outside their comfort.
Why he had to be the one to put an end to the darkest wizard the wizarding world had had in centuries.
"You've always had me. You might not have had me in the same way at the beginning, but ive been here" Harry's hands gripped hard onto Draco's waist, holding him down as Harry leaned back against his headboard and jerked his hips upwards for Draco.
No, Draco did not take pride in having to rush away from the Great Hall to have a quick wank in the nearest room. But damn, Harry is the absolute sexiest thing to stumble into his life, and that just about made up for whatever anger he held against Harry for making him result to a
Harry let his hands release the seat and stroke up Malfoy's thighs until his hands came to the thin hips of Draco Malfoy's.
Harry didn't nessisarily have a problem with Slytherins, he frankly understood how and why they were pushed into succumbing to Voldemort.
"Im not even going to try to explain to you how relieved I am. Hermione and Ron have been trying to get me to sack up for years."
Harry had to admit that she had a good point. Even though he spoke for the Malfoy's, confessing their mercies towards him at the Wizengamot, he wasn't declaring that he had forgiven Malfoy at all. Malfoy had thanked Harry for getting him and his Mother out of life in Azkaban briefly at the beginning of the year.  Harry also didn't have much trouble imagining Malfoy, forced to side with Voldemort, claiming the dark mark, or doing really anything evil. Partially because he had witnessed first hand in the court yard in the final battle how much he cared for the safety of his family, mainly of his mother, and how hesitant he had been to join the other side. Harry could hear the sob of his mother next to Lucius pleading for their son, while he lay in Hagrids arms mere feet away.
Harry traced his tongue along Draco's collar bone, leaving Draco startled and aroused. He bared his neck backwards, absorbing the feel of Harry's wet tongue across his skin.
Draco squirmed under such a powerful gaze and tried to make himself as unnoticeable as possible, even with Harry's and his fingers still intertwined.
H: Where are you? Supper is over with and Ron is mad that you didn’t save him from the first year girl that's been obsessed with him.
Draco cursed Harry's existence for bringing him to such a state, moaning and furiously seeking release.
A lot of the guys couldnt tear their eyes away, actually including Dean and Seamus, even though he was sure they were strictly gay.
He tossed his top and bottoms on the ground and settled into his own bed. Before he could let his head hit the pillow he caught sight of white sliver of paper peeking from his pants pocket.
Yes, Harry was embarrassed to basically admit he wanted to fuck Draco, in front of most of the 8th years. But he didnt feel very embarrassed to give Draco a show, like he had given him. Plus his dream was already the closest Harry could come to embarassing himself. He couldn't imagine telling Draco that he would dream about him every night.
"I don't know that either. If you mean why I'm here, in your lap, then that's because I wanted to see you up close."
His lips were red, still looking extremely kissable, and his pupils were still blown wide as he also evaluated Harry.
Harry made a rather undignified snort after he thought he had composed himself, sending both of them into another fit of laughter.
"I understand that these past few months of school have been hard. Returning to the grounds of which very many unfortunate deaths occured, and for that reason it is very understandable that each of you are in search of distraction," McGonagall sent an endearing gaze at Harry, who had bowed his head and her gaze went unnoticed, "You will both serve a week of detention for the disruption of a lesson. Do not let me catch you two disobeying my rules again, or so help me you will not have even an hour of freetime after classes."
"'Mione, he used to call you a mudblood! He was going to kill Dumbledore! He watched while Bellatrix tortured you. How do you expect me to forgive him for something he
Draco observed a picture frame with Granger and Weasley kissing to one side with Harry on the other shrugging his shoulders and shaking his head. The short play of the photo made Draco chuckle.
It made Draco a bit sad to imagine how he would have turned out if Harry hadnt survived. Would he have been sent to Azkaban? Would Voldemort have killed everyone? Even his Mother and Father.
Harry was more observant of his surroundings this year, and it was hard to miss how Ron had taken to gazing at Lavender recently.
Slowly, hesitantly, he slipped out of his bed and wrestled the paper from his pants and grabbed the phone from the other pocket.
Draco burst through the door unceremoniously, heaving for breath and scrambling for his seat before Slughorn entered the room.
Harry knew Malfoy had felt him, he was obviously very intrested in the Slytherin. Harry thanked the gods that Malfoy didn't know he was practically in love with him. That would bring about the complications of Malfoy making fun of him for something he couldn't exactly control and he didnt feel like getting his heart ripped from his chest.
The only person he wanted to look at then, was Malfoy, but he wouldn't look up from whatever he found interesting about his nails. Harry stared nonetheless enjoying the remainder of the flush on Malfoy's skin. Harry marvelled at the stark contrast of Malfoy's white skin and the red blush in his cheeks.
Harry startled, hesitantly meeting Pansy's eyes. He faked a nonchalant shrug, "Dare," Watching Pansy's questioning featured morph into one of pure evil, Harry felt like he should have chosen truth. Either way, Harry figured, he would've been screwed.
Harry sighed, dropping his fork onto his plate and rubbing his hands up and down his thighs in thought. At last Harry stood and left the Great Hall, ignoring Ron's, muffled with food, attempts at getting him to wait up.
Harry basically moaned into Dracos ear, as he was reminded of the arousing session they had by the fireplace.
Draco blanched, so this was how Harry was going to play huh? He could deal, and if that meant maybe a day in detention he could take it. Just for good measures he passed a glare towards Harry before grabbing his wand and muttering the incantation.
Harry said nothing as he gripped Draco's hand, tugging them down hallways until they reached McGonagall's room.
Those who did, had been influenced by Hermione before Harry walked in. The people who didnt were mainly just the people who had come into the dorm after Harry.
They got a few awkward glares before they caught their breaths and forced themselves to stop laughing. A smile seemed permanently stuck on Draco's mouth.
"Fuck Potter," Malfoy whispered, throwing his head back. Harry barely registered Malfoy's death grip on his knees.
Malfoy whispered, his head appointed to Hermione and Pansy, but a very big smile was plastered to his face. It looked genuine and It stirred the happiness in Harry's chest.
Harry made his way hastly to the 8th year dormitories. He didnt quite know what to say to Hermione, but he didnt want to let her think he blamed the Slytherin's, or Malfoy, for anything anymore. At least he didnt blame the blond for anything nessicarilly bad...
"Dean and I nicked everyone some Firewhiskey. Parkinson suggested it would lighten the tension, eh?"
Malfoy was daring Dean to blow Seamus in another room. While the two exited, the common room was left in awkward silence.
Draco watched from his peripheral vision as a smile brought Harrys lips upwards, then was quickly squashed down.
A celebratory whoop left Malfoy’s smug and exhausted face. But what Harry hadnt expected to see was the elation on his face. His smile was wide and showed his white teeth. His hair was stuck to his forehead with sweat, a few streaks still escaping down his collar and neck. His eyes were crinkled and staring back at him. Slowly the adrenaline left Malfoy's face, easing the heavy lift and fall of his chest and leaving him with a satisfied smile.
Of course Draco didnt actually blame him, rather he should be thanking him. Thanking him for more than just being born as the #1 attractive person. Thanking him for saving his life, for speaking at his families trial, for letting their past go...
Harry pulled his wand from his pocket and held it under the desk aimed at Slughorn, he quietly whispered,
And he recalled the way Malfoy gave him sideways glances in the classes they shared, or from across the Great Hall.
As much as inter-house mingling is encouraged in all years, the eighth years found themselves doing almost whatever they wanted, doing so with whomever.
He let a challenged smirk fall onto his lips. Bolting after Malfoy he caught up fairly quickly. In all honesty it almost seemed like Malfoy had slowed a bit in waiting since just as he took his flank the git darted forward. Flashing him a grin over his shoulder.
Malfoy bit his lip, no doubt probably trying to defy the Veritaserum. Harry's interrupted their staring contest to watch Malfoy's adams apple bob as he swallowed.
Harry made it to the locker room with a ghost of a smile on his face at the recollection of the picture he found with Lily’s letter back in Grimauld.
After all, he'd say he's gotten to know Harry quite well, and maybe his friends weren't as bad as they seemed, under their second hand cloaks and untamed bushy hair.
Harry hadnt noticed when Ron had come through the entrance, or when Ron had got himself a cup, already nursing it in his hand.
"Any amount of PDA, Mr. Potter is unacceptable within the classrooms, and halls of Hogwarts. That is percisely the reason we decided to implement the magical restriction of all unauthorized spells and charms. Professor Dumbledore believed in the complete freedom of magic, be it for good cause or not. With the reconstruction of this precious school it was an all staff decision that such restrictions be mandatory. That is why your charms did not stick Mr. Potter, nor you Mr. Malfoy."
The bottle went around the circle, when it came to Harry he didnt even dwell on what could come of the game. Hermione ended up with a little bit of the potion left in the bottle.
Draco was definitely caught off gaurd. Why would Harry ask him that? Was he curious? Did he care? Would Harry be disappointed if he knew he was gay?
Harry registered that he didn't even know when the pair had left the Great Hall, swearing he saw them when he first entered.
Another gulp had him letting everything flee from his thoughts. His worries should be on the present or the future. He hated dwelling on the past and what he couldn't change. The lives he couldn't save...
"Mate, you look ready to jump out of your seat." Ron snickered to his right through a mouthful of mashed potatoes.
Harry was shocked. He wasnt homophobic, nor was he very disgusted with his new revelation. It was like realizing a little part of him that had always been missing.
He toweled himself and sat quietly at a bench thinking to himself about the recent events. His phone buzzed in his pants pocket, startling him.
After Harry refocused, forgetting Ron was there Harry noted the slight bitterness that etched its way into Ron's voice, but knew it was lighthearted.
Draco was rather hesitant to join the Saviour of the Wizarding World through the streets of Hogsmead. For one, Harry had invited him. That alone rung the bells of caution. Any extended amount of time alone with Potter allowed his feeling to fester and consume his conscience.
"No," Ron answered almost sheepish. "But she's always right about everything. Especially with people."
After not even another second, Pansy was on her knees pushing Hermione back by her shoulders and starting out with a kiss.
One last fleeting imaginary glimpse at Harry's laughing, mirth filled gaze, sent him careening into his orgasm.
Harry was very confused with what was happening, and not so surprisingly, Harry heard Luna mumble something about feeling a familiar presence.
Draco chuckled, he didnt need to lie to himself, of course he'd miss the occasional traded insult between them, even if each slur had a deeper meaning, it wouldn't have been the same without a pair of green eyes and messy hair walking the halls of Hogwarts, walking into class, smiling at Draco.
"Yeah, and I dared him, to receive a lap dance, from you." Pansy seethed at Malfoy, she seemed to think that this cleared all the complaints away, and clapped her hands.
“Mind playing a few seekers games?” He spoke as his feet touched the ground and he stopped a few feet away.
Also...i had no idea where the astral plane thingy came from and im sorry if you dont like it. I just thought something new could be thrown in with the Truth or Dare set up.
Harry took his time looking at Draco, whose white button up and green Slytherin tie were loosened. Harry felt his prick jump at the thought of getting his mouth on Draco's throat. How he would love the noises Draco would make.
Stupid Veritassirum, he had wanted to say top, because he couldnt help the thought that bottoming would be less manly.
As Slughorn faced the class everyone got a full view of both of Slughorns ears wiggling and twitching non stop.
Looking over Harry's shoulder, Draco watched everyone's eyes dart to Hermione and Pansy, accidentally giving away exactly what he wanted to know.
"Sorry again..." Harry nonchalountly walked to the entrance, slipping into the room after mumbling the password.
Not a second after the ball was up were they both pushing off the ground and darting high onto the pitch, eyes sharp and heads scanning the clouds.
Harry blushed as he realised he was still out of his pants. Draco didn't waste a second, after catching the tint in Harry's cheeks, tucking Harry away into his jeans.
Draco whined at the loss of Harry's tongue as he pulled away. His hands remained and he carded his finders through the short hair. If Draco could purr, he bet he would have.
Draco must have subconsiously been colder than he thought. It was hard to tell with a friendly side pressed against his own.
Once everyone had plunked themselves around the room and quieted their shushed greetings to the people next to them, Hermione was holding up a bottle of clear liquid.
After a few civil conversations and awkward interactions between classes and in the 8th year common rooms, they let their fury towards each other ebb away.
Draco worried his bottom lip with his teeth. Yeah, they were friends, but they haven't even grazed the topic of relationships and sexuality. Draco assumed Harry was straight, all 6th year he was attached to the she weasel. Then there was only that Cho girl that Draco could recall. Maybe not all hope was lost?
Harry turned his head particularly quickly, and he felt the blur of the room around his vision. He double checked that his glasses were on his face, before it registered that he was probably a little tipsy.
Harry flashed him a small side smile that sent Draco into a fake coughing fit, anything to hide how utterly pleased he was to have caused it.
"I might as well go make my peace with her, she probably knows more about Slytherins now that she has an inside view from her girlfriend."
"What do you say we loose a few articles of clothing?" Harry suggested wiggling his eyebrow as his hand sculpted Draco's spine through his robes.
Harry took it upon himself to claim Draco's lips. Draco could feel the tilt in Harry's lips from his smile, making Draco himself smile and break their kiss.
Draco and Harry get a bit more heated with each other, thanks to the group of assholes they call their friends.
Pushing the broom forward he took Malfoy's side, the snitch right in front of them zig zagging and darting here and there. Malfoy's arm was outreached, his fingers maybe a meter from the ball.
After another twenty minutes of reviewing the terms of his probation and scheduling his next ‘visit’, Draco plodded down the hall, past reception and back to the lift, with a heavy weight across his shoulders.
now. He hadn’t imagined his Animagus abilities would remain secret forever, but he had at least hoped they wouldn’t be splashed across the front page of the
, don’t you? Slytherins for one—and either sold you out to the Dark Lord or else made a whole-hearted attempt to do so for another?” He touched Harry’s temple with a thoughtful frown. “I haven’t wanked you silly, have I? I know you had no smarts to spare to begin with, so I’ll never forgive myself if—”
“So I’m not enough, then?” he said, taking care to keep his tone playful and teasing; Draco could be very sensitive about the M word business. “You’ve gone and hurt my feelings.”
Harry drew his pillow from under his head and hit Draco across the face with it, receiving a sharp squawk for his efforts. They tussled for a bit—which led to kissing, which led to hands wandering where they really shouldn’t, unless they wanted to wind up with new aches and pains come morning.
Wentsworth gave a gruff chuckle. “Well, you’re keeping your marks up, that’s good to see. Any plans for the upcoming holiday?”
“They said we should head on without them; they’re going to linger a bit for farewells, since they’ve already decided they aren’t coming back.”
Thenceforth, Draco came by fairly regularly in the evening after meals in the idle hours before curfew. Some days, Potter’s roommates were present, and others, Potter wasn’t around at all. But on the odd nights when Potter actually used his free time to put forth a bit of effort instead of sailing through his classes, he allowed Draco to join him, taking critiques in relative stride and offering treats freshly procured from the finest shops in Diagon Alley as thanks.
Patting himself down to check for injury, he collapsed down onto what turned out to be a burlap sack of something soft. Dirt, hopefully; fertiliser, probably. He blinked, sight adjusting to the dim light of the shed Potter had furtively bundled him off to. A shed—Weasley’s shed, then. “What…” he said, still panting, “the
or burying their noses in Horcrux and Founders research. Strange, but not bad. It just left Harry a bit tilted, the rapidity with which their adventure had come to an end, leaving them now trying to navigate the matter of calm, quiet domesticity, a concept with which neither of them was particularly familiar nor well-suited.
They continued their good-natured bickering all the way back to Grimmauld Place, where they were only interrupted by dinner.
“Aww, now that’s not very nice. I expect I can improve with some revision though. How’s the Greenhouses at midnight work for you?”
in Hogsmeade?” Granger asked, because she couldn’t just take Potter’s word for it, evidently. Had to be an insufferable snoop.
, after all, and they’d rarely printed anything the Boy Saviour might deem ‘fit’. Maybe he would have heard the words, “Did you hear what the
"I don't know." Harry suddenly looks worried, biting his lips as he mumbles, staring at his grotesque hand.
They're all empty, some have the weird nice smelling powder in cube slots, and strange buttons that don't work when Draco presses them.
"Fraternizing with the enemy?" she continues, and Draco stiffens. Enemy? He knows that she hates Potter, but enemy is a strong word, certainly? Unless-
"And the cost," another click of the tongue. "Lucius Malfoy is dead, Evan. You forced him into acting out. I had him in the palm of my hand, and you burned it to ashes," the scales roughly rub against his bare skin and Evan is so mortified by its presence that he screams merely as an outlet for the over piling terror.
!” Severus watches in horror as Nott’s curse grazes Draco on the shoulder. There is a moment of stillness before Draco roars in pain, Lucius is thrown off balance, wildly glancing at his son over his shoulder whilst trying to take Nott down in the same instance. Draco crumples down as blood spreads across his shirt and robe at an alarming rate.
“Do you want your fun or not?” Harry cannot see, but Bellatrix’s tone is dry and almost cooled with an air of unimpressed impatience.
The first step they take is… not a promising one. They stumble more than walk, and he’s not sure who’s holding up who. But they walk.
He has nothing to treat this. Not even water. He bites his lip, and reaches to Draco once more. “You need to wake up,” Harry curses his shaking hand and does it again. It might as well be pointless, Draco is like an inferno already, he could be delirious at this point.
Harry never lets go of his hand, "That's a stop sign," he points at a red signpost by the far end of the street, "That means cars have to stop before entering the street. To avoid accidents."
Draco frowns, "I don't get it. They've been told you're safe." What else is there to be worried about? Umbridge is still there, but Severus had said that Dumbledore wouldn’t let any other students get hurt. And anyway, Umbridge’s beef had been with Harry and him, not his friends.
Harry helplessly looks at his flushed cheeks, his bloodstained shirt and back to his face, his eyes moving restlessly under his lids. He probably has an infection. And while Harry is used to dealing with injuries with almost no supplies at all, even he doesn’t have anything to help him with. The water pitcher is gone.
His robes swish upon the damp ground, and his eyebrow crooks once he comes to a stop in front of a closed shop. Rosier regards the shop for a moment and then draws his wand, his shoulders drawn back.
We do NOT wish to trigger anyone who's trying to read and enjoy this story, so if you guys think you need to be warned explicitly about the entailment of this chapter, please go to endnotes.
“Yes?” Draco frowns, he doesn’t actually know what is ‘adequate’ regarding this type of injury, although Harry has been almost overbearing in his worry, fussing and working over his shoulder as much as he could given his tremors.
"Oh really?" Bill exchanges a smirk with Tonks who rolls her eyes, "Maybe you should put in a word for me in front of mom? She'd have kittens for sure."
"A bit rebellious, aren't you?" She asks Harry, wiggling her eyebrows at the bars on Harry's window.
Albus closes his eyes and falls back against the couch, his skin pale and breathing slower than before.
He works as if on autopilot. This is easy. He can do this. As long as he doesn't make any mistakes, or doesn't have any accidents, he'd be fine. He could just block everything out and complete his chores for that day. Maybe there would be enough chores today to exhaust him so much that he won't dream.
Harry gives him a small, brittle smile, like he knows exactly what bullshit Draco is on about, but he just shrugs, “Same as you. I’m okay.”
"Ron, I know you don't like action, like my dear furry friend, Remus. But you either want to live, or turn into a pink goop."
Harry had thrown up a few times already when he spent too much time obsessing over his dream. Even though it wasn't a dream. Harry isn't sure what it was. He's scared of asking anyone, he's terrified of telling Ron and Hermione, after the whole debacle with Sirius, Harry's too paranoid to even try uttering the man's codename. Much less writing him a letter about how he saw his cousin ruthlessly killed by his other cousin while her son watched and her husband did nothing.
He spends the rest of the day lazily going through his chores. Not even completing half of them, but most of them had been pointless anyway. If he cleaned the damned floor once more, he'd rub the tiles right off.
From all of the gore, and blood and hallucinations, the moment Draco recalls most prominently is carrying Harry.
Bellatrix was there. In the dream. Harry doesn't know why he'd thought of her at all. She was in Azkaban as far as he knows, wasn't she?
"I'm extremely disappointed in you," Evan's body twitches, violently shaking as The Dark Lord's cold foot presses down on his cheekbone without an ounce of mercy. The force is enough to make Evan cry out again in earnest. Voldemort doesn't give away until the bone
"A meeting?" Harry asks for the first time since dinner has started, prompting Remus to look up from Sirius to smile at him. "Yes," he says mildly, he looks much more relaxed now. Harry vaguely notices how younger he looks when he's around Sirius.
It takes Draco a moment to catch on. He never had that problem with other people before, never had any issues understanding them, or hell, even reading between the lines of their faces, their deepest, darkest secrets. But Harry Bloody Potter is a first in everything so far.
"You guess," she drawls and Harry bites the inside of his cheek. Maybe he should have reacted differently.
"No,” Harry frowns. “I was reading," and sleeping wouldn’t have been good anyway, one of them had to stay awake lest they miss their stop.
Surprisingly, Harry's body doesn't push on the urge to vomit as he stares at Draco and thinks of his father's swift demise. Harry lets his eyes flutter close with Draco in his sight, a comforting presence in spite of their unfortunate predicament.
He sits there for a little while, gazing up at the sky as it darkens further, the light bleeds away into inky blackness. It's getting chillier too. Harry wasn't expecting that when he stepped out for his stroll, or else he would have worn one of the Weasley jumpers over Dudley's rags. They all still fit. The first one he had received is only a bit shorter now, the sleeves fall short to the middle of his forearms.
The diagnosis doesn’t reveal much, except abnormal dehydration. Severus purses his lips, confirmation that this is exactly the potion he’d been requested to make, all those years ago. He doesn’t know whether to be relieved or worried. He tends to think about it sometimes, how many deaths and maimings and poisoning he is responsible for due to being the Dark Lord’s Potion master.
"Albus? Albus are you there?" Slughorn doesn’t sound anything like Severus remembers. Not the jovial man he’d been when teaching potions. He sounds tired and concerned. It instantly puts Severus on edge, even more so than before.
"Oh it's quite alright, Mr. Malfoy," She says, her eyes narrowed and stitched to Harry's hand. Harry doesn't dare breathe.
Calmer than he probably should be feeling, seeing as Sirius has been glaring at him since that morning. On and off, Harry feels the man in the too tight and stifling space of their compartment.
"I'll make you some hot chocolate as well," Mrs. Weasley says with a motherly smile, getting to her feet.
Draco pouts in mock sympathy. "Poor piss Potter with his sob story of a life." he ducks a stinging jinx coming from the shorter boy. "Hiding behind his name, and his poor rag-wearing friends… hiding behind Diggory." That struck a nerve, and Potter goes very still, his eyes wide with rage and his hand trembling in place. Draco rejoices, only momentarily at Potter's frozen figure before he pushes again.
Potter washes the breakfast dishes with no complaint, then in the absence of other things to do, the boy walks over to the red worn couch in the living room, drapes himself on said couch, with the back door opened a nudge to let the wind run through the windchimes as he just lies there and stares into the distance.
Sirius had told him that once, in one of his letters as Snuffles. As Harry's eyes open and his scar sears in pain, he finds himself loathing Sirius and his metaphoric logic.
"My aunt Petunia once hit me with a wooden spoon because of pickled garlic," Harry casually mentions sometime later, it should have started raining by now but it's not and Draco is grateful.
"Remember cars? There's a truck--a type of car-- specified just for letters. Or a bike. I'm not really sure of this stuff. They find the addresses, then use the vehicle to get it there,"
"Thank you," Harry says for him and Draco flushes. He's practised that before. He has manners. Time and time again he practised, and he still forgot.
Minerva scoffs in disbelief. "No need? People need to know the truth, Albus. We are in a war situation. We barely need people believing whatever
He’s being stood up. It takes a lot to be stood up by someone like Potter, especially after humiliating himself by offering to actually help the daft prat, but here he is, idly glancing around and huffing in irritation.
He was right before. It hurts a lot more than the first time around. Instead of a severe stinging in his chest, it's tantamount to someone slashing his chest open and digging in with sharp nails. Over and over again.
Severus doesn’t dare nod his head, neither does he shake it, instead he throws a meaningful glance at a disoriented Potter and Draco scowls.
"Merlin's balls, Harry," Draco groans. "If you infest this place with those beasts, I swear to God."
“Are you asking me for personal experience?” is the man’s bereft reply and Harry rolls on the floor, facing away so that Draco wouldn’t see his face, damp in perspiration and his own drool. It’s disgusting.
"We should go," Remus says with a nod to Tonks and Moody and grasps Harry's shoulder, leading him away from the two.
He knew he could. Harry’s a fucking twig compared to Draco, and Draco isn’t exactly bulky. It’d kill his legs, but it’d make him feel better. But the truth of the matter is, Harry would never accept it. He didn't last time- not knowingly anyway-, and he won't now.
"You're running the bloody school," Rosier drags Draco to his side, his hand tight enough to grind Draco's bones. "You cannot just leave your post. Stand back and damage control. Until our Lord summons you,"
‘I’m sure I wouldn’t mind in real life, her being my cousin and all,’ Sirius’s voice is barely heard over his own screaming. Harry is tired. ‘Even as children she was such a bitch. She used to yank my hair, casted stinging jinxes at little Reggi all the time,’
"Are you serious?" Harry’s nose wrinkles immediately after he says this, eyes flicking over to somewhere on Draco’s right before his face clears.
Sirius's words ring in his head a few times, with phrases such as 'resistance against you-know-who' and 'Dumbledore insisting on absolute secrecy' bolded in the mental speech. It makes some amount of sense but Harry is too mad and irrational to accept it as such. He's giving himself some leeway to be petulant, he knows how ridiculous he must look but he doesn't care. Harry's tired. He really is.
'It'll be easy. You just gotta be careful about body disposal.' Imaginary Sirius hums, rubbing his chin. 'Cannot bury or burn her… maybe throw her off the Astronomy tower down in the mud pit. It has a great view too. Or dissolve her in one of Snape's Potions.'
“Was that okay?” Harry asks. Draco can barely nod over the heady rush he’s feeling. The last time he’d felt this way, remotely close to how he’s feeling right now, had been when they’d been dancing together.
“It seems like I’m not the only one.” Harry folds his arms, his wand clutched in his uninjured hand.
“Harry. You’re not breathing right,” in a mad desperate dash his mind wonders whether there is a calming draught in Snape’s stock, but he perishes the thought the moment it comes. He cannot just leave Harry like this, in spite of having no idea what was happening to him.
Fudge opens his mouth and then closes it for a moment. "Well yes, yes. It's not that I'm implying anything, Auror Shacklebolt. But I also happen to have your floo location history on hand as well, and you seem to have used your floo to contact the headmaster on the following day after the incident."
"Nothing to worry about, just routine reports," he continues and Sirius nods along, giving Harry a small, barely noticeable wink before Remus steals his attention again.
His jovial steps come to an abrupt stop before the double doors and Evan rights himself, slipping his silver mask in place with a smirk as he gently taps the wood with his knuckles.
"I like it," Harry awkwardly turns and heads for the sink. He needs his water to bolt out of here. Maybe head back to his own room, or hide in the loo until morning, he's not sure which he'd rather do now.
“Did you know that the moon is moving away from the Earth at the rate of four centimeters per year?” Draco blinks. Then thinks it over.
Remus himself settles in Minerva's chair. "You don't need to do any lines. We can just spend the day here, catch up."
He takes in where they are going, and surely enough, they seem to be headed towards her office. Definitely in the opposite direction of the Slytherin dungeons. He slips his wand down his sleeve, running a finger over its tip.
was true, then Snape was the only other person who knew about Malfoy's mom. Aside from Lucius Malfoy.
It sounds downright awful. Harry would most assuredly smack him for it. Either with his hands or his mug.
measures of retaliation. The other boy is getting too cocky. "You're still dripping blood everywhere, Potter." He points out, snark dripping off every word.
"Well, Mr. Malfoy, I have to say I am very disappointed," she starts, tapping her wand against her chin slowly, as if thinking very hard. Draco doesn't answer, just looks at her with a blank, bored gaze.
The other boy's chuckle surprises him, and Draco raises his eyebrows but Harry keeps on laughing. "Bored," the boy sniggers. "We're in a prison cell and you're bored?"
Unease rises up in Harry's throat, and he's about to say something when Malfoy shakes his head and starts wiping away at the cuts. Still bleeding sluggishly.
Two weeks ago, my lovely grandmother, and Elen's lovely grandfather passed away due to health complications. May they both rest in peace.
Potter’s trembling hands are clenching and unclenching, and he is actually glaring at Severus. If the situation weren’t as horrific as it is, Severus would have found it amusing. He doesn’t answer.
"Yes," Kingsley drapes one leg over the other in an exaggerated display of nonchalance. "I haven't been on leave in over two months,"
"They won't come back to life by you drying up like a twig. Drink, Albus," Severus repeats. The man stares at him for a long moment and then drinks the water. Severus nods, taking the glass away from him. Albus summons the small piece of paper from the floor wandlessly, his eyes flicking over the loopy handwriting.
The man enters the cell with a sick grin on his face and certain gleam in his eyes and Harry lets his eyes close. Time to get some crispy nerves.
Aunt Petunia continues, "I didn't keep you in this house to be a lazing, good for nothing freak! Get off your lazy ass and get to work! Get up before you regret it!"
The implications of Umbridge as the Headmistress are huge and Severus shudders just thinking about that bloated pink monstrosity, he barely stops himself from letting out a disgusted noise. Hagrid would do a better job than her.
Every touch of her hand on his revolts Harry to the point of vomiting, but he manages. Walks over to her and sticks out his bloodied hand. It's slowly going numb again and the blood is starting to crust into a rusty brown.
Falling backward, he settles to just pulling his wand out, finally. His grip is pitifully weak on it, he isn't even holding it properly. But he has to do
“Twinky,” That seems to be the word that the stream is trying to push to the forefront of his mind, as it glitters under the imaginary moonlight. Harry sighs and then almost smacks his own forehead for being so stupid.
Tonks and Bill are gaping right back at him, looking kind of sheepish. Mad-Eye is reclining on a, probably transfigured, armchair, his non-prosthetic leg in white bandages.
'You're playing chase, like with Marge's Dog. Except the dog in the situation is me. Quite ironic, isn't it?'
And then Harry’s face pops up in his head, once again. And yes, he should. He can risk it. He’s confident enough in his abilities to be able to apparate a hundred yards.
Draco chortles. “Trust me, Pans, he didn’t entrust you with anything, he tossed it at you for his own carnal amusement and your mother’s embarrassment.”
He pulls Potter, as gently but as hurriedly as he can manage and leans him against the wall, then crouches down to retrieve a mumbling Draco.
Draco reaches for the bag, "I know," he unfolds the coat once Harry crumples on one of the chairs, his eyes closed.
Through the process of elimination, Draco figures that a potion is too unreliable and fleeting, it can be flushed out of the system eventually, Rosier would never go for something like that.
"Because I don't want to play the game anymore,” Harry laces his fingers through Draco where they’re wound around his stomach. He’s warm, both of them are. Which is such a novelty now that he sighs in contentment, “Had everything gone right, you would be my father, had everything gone right, I would be at school with my friends, but if everything had gone right, he wouldn't be holding me like this."
Potter finally deigned to grace Draco with his presence five minutes later, quietly shutting the door behind himself with apologies already on his lips. “I’m
“…All right.” Potter seemed to be having a devil of a time wrapping his mind around what was, as far as Draco could tell, a rather simple concept. Perhaps he too was only astounded by how far Draco had flown in such a short amount of time. Perhaps he was thinking
He was immediately drawn inside, and the chill of the evening was chased away by the tower’s cosy warmth. Gryffindor House had its charms, he supposed, as far as amenities went. The Dungeon could be draughty if you weren’t bundled up under the bedclothes, and even the likes of Blaise, who preferred to sleep in the buff, never went to bed without at least one pair of wool socks on.

other things that were infinitely easier to accomplish than studying some of the most difficult magic out there. And flattering as it might be to think you did it just to make my life a little more hellish in your own special way, I’m disinclined to believe you.”
at hearing compared to owls’, but even over the dull drone of conversation, Draco still managed to catch Weasley going, “That’s a
Snape had nearly stabbed his quill through the parchment, so quickly had he scrawled his signature on the application—and then sent it sailing off to McGonagall for final approval as the Head of the Transfiguration Department. “I’m expecting smart decisions from you this year, Mr Malfoy. You’ve always been a clever student. Do
Draco squinted at Potter, who drew his hand back, miming putting it away so as not to bother Draco anymore. “You’re awfully jumpy. Most owls I’ve known have been pretty laid-back. Well, barring Pig. But he’s just excitable by nature. You act like everyone’s out to get you.” Potter gestured around the room. “There aren’t many safer places than inside these walls, you know. Even the Owlery’s protected by the castle’s charms. You don’t have to be so uptight.”
“Er…” Harry followed him down, clutching the newel at the base for comfort. “…It was about you, actually.”
“…I think I didn’t know how to feel about you. I wanted you to notice me, I suppose. Focus on me. If I couldn’t have you doing that positively, I’d take negatively. It was still you, obsessed with me. And when you didn’t notice me, not the way I wanted you to at least, I told myself I never wanted you anyway, that you were obviously not worth my time if you saw fit to hang about with the sorts you did. Werewolves and convicted felons and—Muggleborns.” He grew very quiet. “I didn’t know how else I could feel, so I decided to feel hate. I’m not proud of it—”
“No, just—” He waved a hand around the room. “I was here a year ago today, actually. We had everyone over for Harry’s seventeenth last year. Mum set up some tables out in the garden—” He jerked a thumb behind him. “And I found myself sitting next to Harry.” He was smiling to himself and took another draw from his bottle. “He asked me the strangest question.”
But Draco just waved him off with a disgusted huff. “Salazar’s balls, I’ll leave you and your cock in peace. I’m taking next bath.” He threw a sharp look over his shoulder. “…And don’t come peeping until I’m ready.”
As Potter had already announced his intention to visit earlier, their next stop was Eeylops Owl Emporium, where Potter loaded down a burlap sack with every flavour of treat in the shop, including the seasonal specials, and even grabbed a tin of expensive imported treats that included flavours like
He spent the rest of the afternoon quietly sulking from Potter’s shoulder while the group flitted from shop to shop snapping up last-minute Christmas gifts, and dinner was a quiet affair in the Leaky Tap. Draco was starving by this point, but his pride would not allow him to accept the hand-fed scraps Potter offered him in what he probably meant as an apology for the harrowing experience at Eeylops. Draco made a mental note to
fan clubs might consider the merit in having people around willing to watch your back as fiercely as you watch theirs. Just a suggestion.”
Draco let him stew in his self-loathing for only a heartbeat, then gave a derisive scoff, staring down into his half-drunk mug of tea. “…Don’t try and feign sympathy, and keep your condolences to yourself.”
Draco didn’t quite know what to say to that, so he went for the lowest hanging fruit. “…You’re right, it
went up as the game began. Potter kicked off, and Draco drifted into position. Once Potter saw him, there was every chance he would catch on to what Draco was trying to do, which would ruin the surprise, so he had precious few moments of leeway to get this done. Below, the Snitch had zipped out from under the awning and was now flying in spiralling loops toward the Hufflepuff stands. Potter was taking a lazy turn around the pitch, eyes peeled, and he seemed to have spotted neither Draco nor the errant Snitch.
Harry choked on his crème brûlée, and that was the end of lunch. Draco promptly excused the both of them, thanking his mother for the lovely meal, as if she’d lifted a finger to prepare it herself, and slipped his arm through Harry’s, ready to Disapparate right from the dining room. It was only just as he was twisting on his heel that he called out, “By the by, I’ll be boarding at Harry’s place for the foreseeable future. I’ll have the rest of my things Summoned in the morning. Don’t bother trying to Owl me—the place is under a Fidelius, drat it all. I’ll be back for luncheon again next week, ta!”
, Potter,” Draco huffed, shoulders slumping in unmistakable relief. He leaned against one of the bedposts, his forehead pressed against his arm as he seemed to struggle to collect himself. “You cannot give me a ring and then tell me it’s an
“Good to see you again, Draco,” Wentsworth said after his secretary had ushered Draco into his office, and he waved his wand, encouraging a chair that had been sitting in the corner to gallop over and scoop up Draco, depositing him in front of Wentsworth’s desk, which was presently drowning in paperwork. Catching Draco taking in the state of his desk, Wentsworth gave a wry chuckle. “Well, it’s a busy time of year, you can understand. Parole hearings, petitions for family leave, and enough visitation requests to choke on.”
“What…what’s the difference?” Harry asked, in a very small voice. Oh, he had a good idea, but hearing Draco talk like this, not circumspect at all,
When Potter arrived with breakfast the next morning (kibble for the owls, what he’d evidently told Weasley’s mother was “thirds, ‘cause I’m famished!” for Draco), he brought with him news that there was to be a trip to Diagon Alley for lunch and to visit ‘George’ to help him prepare for the Christmas rush. “Seeing as, you know, he lost half his help…” Through awkward and not entirely sincere condolences, Draco divined that George was one of the Weasley twins who’d made Umbridge’s short time at Hogwarts a living hell (and ruined his own Fifth Year) before going on to open the joke shop in Diagon Alley that Draco himself had patronised in Sixth Year to aid his aborted efforts at murder.
He cast a hasty Glamour on himself before he dared set foot inside, all too conscious of the fact that the shop was only right around the corner from the

She was angling most unsubtly for his decision on whether or not to return for the Eighth-year curriculum, and he gave a dismissive nod. “You’ll be hearing from me soon on that matter, I expect.”
Harry felt like he’d unwittingly wandered into the Slytherin Common Room, and Draco’s friends made sure he didn’t forget it. They fell back on inside jokes or discussed their own post-war situations with Draco, not bothering to loop Harry in. He’d thought the backhanded compliments on his cooking had been bad enough, but trust Draco’s companions to manage to sink even lower than Harry had imagined possible. Granted, it was admittedly nice to see Draco so garrulous and comfortable—even at the best of moments with Harry and Ron and Hermione, he had always mostly kept to himself, rarely starting or continuing a conversation on his own. It wasn’t that Draco
She gave him a funny look, then bobbed her head. “Well then, if you wouldn’t mind peeling the potatoes? There’s a sack, just inside the pantry. A dozen should do. I’ll just pop out to the garden for some herbs.”
The next morning, Draco trudged back up to the Owlery, the Snitch safe and secure in his pocket. He gave a silent nod to Xerxes, who after a steady diet of treats from Draco’s hand had learned he was to accept no more letters or parcels from Potter, and quickly and quietly assumed his owl form. The Snitch in talon, he winged his way around to the Great Hall, slipping through the skylight along with the other owls making their morning deliveries to the students feasting below, and dropped the Snitch directly over Potter’s head.
“I…I don’t…” Draco stared at Thomassen like he’d grown a second head—and really, that would’ve shocked him less right about now. “Why on
look like Spellotape. He only just held himself back from adding the Mooncalf-hide saddle seat—it would be a luxury wasted on Potter.
full of owl treats if you’ll do it? Do you have a flavour preference or anything? George said Eeylops started selling a new ‘Cinnamon Pumpkin Tripe’ flavour after the equinox, and that sounds absolutely disgusting to me, but I’m not an owl, so what do I know?” He slowly extended the hand holding the parchment. “
Harry guided him out, a hand on the small of his back, when he didn’t immediately step off. They made their way to the reception desk, behind which sat a cheery young man who was thrilled—just
“Don’t worry,” Potter groused, one eye pinned to Draco at all times, as if fearful he might suddenly find himself swooped upon otherwise. He carefully fit his little scroll of parchment to the Barred Owl’s leg, which it tolerated with a sleepy blink. “I won’t be demanding your ‘services’ again.” Draco gave a rough, rasping hiss that came out in a stutter reminiscent of chuckling laughter. “Dunno how you could be expected to fly anyhow with that stick up your arse.” He stopped laughing.
There was a whiny twinge to his voice that suggested he wasn’t in any real pain, and Harry leered. “Let me make it up to you?” Draco kept his lips twisted into a scowl, but the brightness in his eyes betrayed his interest, and Harry stepped in—then stopped. “Wait—
“What’s so funny?” Harry asked; it had been a serious question, and he’d hoped for a serious answer.
Draco drew himself up, tugging on his robes and taking a step back. He disguised his still-racing pulse with a gruff, derisive huff and forced a curl to his lip. “Thought the entire school was pulling one over on you, then? Slow news day at the
—I didn’t want you sticking your pock-marked nose where it didn’t belong? Did I not dumb it down enough for your pea-brain to grasp?”
it and buy a new one. He thought the new rug looked somehow a little blood-stained too and hadn’t set foot in the room since the final battle.
Once the last of the plastered Slytherins had been safely seen through the Floo, not a one sober enough to Apparate five feet let alone all the way home, Harry wanted to just collapse into bed, nearly as drained by the ordeal as he’d been by his duel with Voldemort—so he did.
what the Dark Lord and his more maniacal followers had left behind, whether intentionally or otherwise, for unwitting fools like Draco to stumble upon later?
with Potter. Potter smiled against his lips, tugged him even closer, and made a little sound in the back of his throat. It was rough and breathy and felt like a challenge that said
“Thank you, but it’s nothing I can’t handle,” Draco said, quickly, because while he appreciated his friends throwing fits for him, he didn’t appreciate them doing so in the middle of the Great Hall. They could be nearly as bad as Potter sometimes.
In the early morning hours, just as dawn was breaking and with the rest of the Weasley household snugly abed, Draco departed. He’d waited for first light out of habit, only belatedly recalling he had excellent night vision and could have overnighted in the comfort of his own bed instead of on a perch alongside a wheezing Errol and Pig, who seemed to have some form of owl night terrors and woke up squawking at odd hours.
“Aw, come on, Hermione,” Ron pleaded. “Can’t you save your new campaign for next week?” Hermione gave him a sour look, and he quickly amended, “Just, your new Ministry mates would be devastated they didn’t get to hear your ideas first.”
He was so caught up in his own thoughts he nearly bumped right into Mrs. Weasley, who was levitating a casserole out of the oven. “Goodness, Harry, do be careful!” she chided, then caught herself. “Oh dear, you’re red as a tomato. Are you feeling all right? It’s awfully stuffy in this kitchen, you should go out and get some fresh air.”
The next morning, he considered Flooing to Diagon Alley like a civilised wizard—then considered again after recalling that he’d need to find a private space to shift (the Eeylops staff would have questions if pressed to remove one of their patented cuffs from a human, surely), a task that would be difficult if not downright impossible the weekend before students would be returning to Hogwarts for the new term. He therefore kissed his mother on the cheek after wolfing down a quick three-course breakfast and winged his way to London, not knowing at all how much time he ought to allot for the journey and therefore arriving nearly two hours before the appointed meeting time.
Something poked his shoulder, though, and he swivelled his head around, locking eyes with Potter, who gave him a weak wave. “Thanks for keeping me company. And if it’s all the same to you, I don’t think I’ll credit you on my essay. Flitwick would probably want to know who ‘Alabastard’ was, and my sanity’s always been a tenuous thing at this school.”
of practice needed, though.” He leaned in close, nuzzling the sensitive skin just below Harry’s ear—oh, this was
“Er…” Potter hedged, eyes darting about in a most suspicious manner—before falling on the wand clutched in Draco’s grasp. “…Nice to see your wand’s behaving,” he said, and that had absolutely nothing to do with the topic at hand, but Draco let it be, enjoying the sight of Potter squirming.
“I might just,” Draco said, turning Potter’s childish threat around on him. “I hear it’s nice this time of year.”
“I’m going to start shadowing some Ministry officials in the next week or so,” Hermione said, spooning a helping of sweetcorn onto her plate. It had been Ron’s turn this evening, and he’d recently taken a shine to all things instant, as Draco had; every dish on the table had come from a tin or packet and been zapped with a Warming Charm.
Harry escaped into the publicity of the common room. Even despite the many people that occupied the room already in accordance to the aformentioned party, Harry had no trouble finding Hermione, almost instinctively.
Draco's euphoric high left him stumbling out of the cupboard after listening and making sure the hallway was empty, then tucking himself away and vanishing the mess he'd made.
It was surprising in the first place that Harry decided to come back to hogwarts to finish it off. Everyone basically just assumed he'd had enough of the place that held so many unfortunate losses. The Weasel and Granger decided to abandon their chosen one, but even Draco could feel his hostility towards them subsiding.
Harry must have been so intensely staring, Hermione seemed to voice her concern from across the table.
"You should have seen the look on your face mate," Draco couldn't help but chuckle as Harry turned back to him confused. "I've been completely obvious, and you look as if I've turned your world upside down, Potter,"
"Why don't you admit to yourself that Malfoy might not be a bad guy?" Harry gave a swift glance to Malfoy then focused back on Hermione.
Neville had somewhat taken it easy on him. At least he didnt have to confess his undying love in front of every fucking house at Hogwarts.
He pulled back, seeming to confuse Malfoy, as he slowed, but this gave him the perfect opportunity. Rising above Malfoy’s height, he flipped himself upside down. As soon as Malfoy turned back forward, Harry had spun his broom around jetting backwards in his perspective, and ducked downwards, right in front of Malfoy. He flashed a toothy grin,  which caused Malfoy to belt out a startled guffaw. The hand Malfoy had had outreached darted forward once more but this time to yank Harry downwards by his robes. He sent him spinning ahead, which flipped him right side up and back in pursuit of Malfoy.
He recalled the way his head hung over his shoulder, watching Harry squeeze his hips for dear life for the dare.
"I could wake you up right now and I would remember everything you've said..." Draco's eyes softened, looking up at Harry's invisible face. "But, I wouldnt be opposed to indulging in one of your dreams right now."
"Ah, Parkinson, Granger. Thanks." Draco gave a sly smile before standing with Harry's ass in his hands and Harry's legs wrapped around his torso.
Draco took the opportunity. Harry felt the careful slide of Draco's tongue over his lips, then his own tongue as they rubbed together, pulling another moan from Harry. Draco's hand was quickening, snapping his wrist at the end of each pull.
Harry slipped passed many people he didn't even care to acknowledge, to get the other side of the room.
The noise seemed to make Harry stall, turning to look at Draco and what he was looking at once they got to his bed.
Ron was never good at hiding his feelings, so it was obvious to everyone he knew, he had fallen for Hermione. Hermione wasn't very secretive either, its a wonder how Ron hadn't picked up the more than friendly care she showed the youngest Weasley boy sooner.
Pansy's yell scared both boys into stillness. Harry's eyes flew opened and Malfoy snapped his head straight. Harry loosed his hold on the hips he's probably bruised. For a moment longer both of them just heaved breath after breath, then Malfoy was quickly moving away from Harry.
Harry followed Seamus' pointing finger to a small table set against a wall with a few bottles of said alcohol and plastic cups.
Harry nodded at Draco after reading it. With a small smirk gracing Harry's lips, he passed it back after a quick squiggle.
Draco braced a hand over Harry's chest, bending down to kiss Harry again. Harry licked his way into Draco's mouth, pushing apart Dracos pliant lips with the intrusion. Draco could only groan as he made busy with the buttons of his shirt after slipping off his tie.
"You know eye fucking from across the hall isn't going to get you anywhere." She closed her History of Muggles book and jerked her head in the direction of Malfoy.
Draco shared a room with Blaise and Theo, and Draco recalled Harry telling him that he shared his own with Longbottom, Thomas, and Finnigan.
He bought himself a new broom since his other broke, not another Firebolt, but not a Cleansweep either. A nimbus 2000, his first broom, if you didn’t count his toy broom Sirius had gotten him for his 1st birthday.
He sighed, leaning against a corner out of Filches view. He hadn't even stepped a foot passed the doors before Mrs. Norris came meowing looking up at him innocently.
"Pansy, what the fuck? Its Potters dare not mine!" Malfoy spat to Pansy looking about ready to get up and just walk out of the common room.
Harry was almost inclined to look away from Malfoy, until he watched the Slytherin break from his daze and snap at Pansy with a bit of color to his cheeks.
even more excited and almost too eager to accept the offer; he got along fairly with the other 2 members of the Golden Trio but...
However the game was moving on. Harry was still achingly hard and no matter what he thought of to try to get it to go down, his mind never failed in picturing Malfoy rubbing his clothed ass on his clothed dick.
Already strung out from thinking so much about the git, he stuffed his phone and the paper back into his pants pocket and dressed himself, swearing not to think about it on his way up to the dorms.
Draco willed his mind away from the topic of any intimate situations with Harry. Despite how much he did like Harry, sporting an erection next to him in the middle of class was not how he imagined that conversation ever starting out.
Slowly, Harry crawled over Malfoy's outstretched legs and sat down over his thighs. Harry hadn't expected to be able to sit, he though he would phase through the legs under him but he could feel the heat radiating from beneath him.
"Shall we return to class just to spite Slughorn, or should we go elsewhere?" Harry asked, caressing Draco's jawline with his thumb from where his hand had made it to Draco's neck.
Draco's hands loosened their iron hold on Harry's collar, letting them roam up and back through Harry's mop of hair.
Harry wasnt sure what Hermione referred to as "eye fucking", no, he certainly wasnt doing anything close to the fucking part, none the less with his eyes. He especially wasnt doing anything containing that last word with the likes of Malfoy at all.
“I wasn’t!” he protested with a bit more heat this time. “I was going to say…” He took a bracing breath. “I was going to say that
