"Malfoy!"
Ron. But Ron seemed to
. What the
"You must have knocked your head really hard with something," was all Draco could mutter.
"Stop it, Harry!" shrieked Hermione.
But if he didn't fix it, his mother would die.
Harry looked as if he'd been slapped and it was his turn to start walking away quickly. To escape from his problems, as usual.
"Mr Potter!" McGonagall squealed.
"No," he replied despite the evidence.
getting? It was him the one that crashed my nose!"
"Only with clothes. No hiding charm works, and it absorbs any kind of makeup."
"I told Harry to distract Malfoy so that he cannot do whatever it is that he is supposed to do. I'd like to know what is it that he is supposed to do, but I guess that could put him and us in compromising situations..."
"Look, I feel generous today. So I will spell it for you. I just need you to explain me a couple of things. I admit that I am pretty dull, because I really don't know how to
"So you are seriously considering helping Malfoy? When the hell, and how the fuck, did you two arrive at that conclusion?" asked Ron with very open eyes.
"Be my guest, princess. Don't worry, I was not planning on eating that food."
"Yes. A proposal. That is in line with what I told you last time of no more sex between us."
"I don't," answered Harry, and he felt the scar in his hand itch. "But it's so obvious. You are malnourished."
Potter gave him a mocking smile.
Pansy scanned him with squinted eyes. He didn't look tired, more like hurt or angry. It was a rare sight, because he didn't usually allow himself to openly express his feelings. He normally dealt with them by blocking them or hiding from them. This was rare. But it wasn't the first time she saw him like that. When they were little and she won at some game, he would put on that exact same expression, as if it was an outrage that things didn't go according to his plan. She started to let him win as they got older, because she preferred to avoid putting that look on his face. Draco also reacted like that when he fought with his mother, or when Lucius acted like Lucius. Few people were able to get under his skin in that way, and yet the one that did the most was Saint Potter. Anyway, whatever the reason, when Draco was in a mood like that, there was no talking about it that could make it better.
"Are you serious? You really want to talk with
a few centimetres away from where Draco was standing. And Draco was petrified.
But he was a mess, so he called his name again.
"Potter, I know that reflection is a skill that you find difficult, but we will be needing more than three words from you," said Snape. Draco caught McGonagall eyeing him dangerously.
With a perspective of some inches, he could see Malfoy's face clearly. Malfoy, who was manipulating and messing with his head. Malfoy, who was biting his lower lip and smiling mockingly, as if he knew that Harry was using all his will power to stay away. Malfoy, who didn't look like he hated him anymore, who was not hiding behind masks, but letting his gray eyes show that he
Harry woke up with a terrible soggy taste in the mouth, but for some reason, he felt satisfied. He didn't remember what he had dreamed that night, but it must have been good. Then he remembered that it hadn't been a dream, and that it had in fact been revolting.
Draco blinked slowly. Potter was not enjoyable anymore, now he just was the guy he hated. He stood up to leave.
"Some of them are quite remarkable? Did you seriously just said that about
They both remembered when they had said those very same words in their second year. But this was a completely different scenario, and it was far more dangerous. Draco laughed, as if he was in complete control of the situation. Potter rolled his eyes, not impressed, but he separated himself from Draco's body, and he was locking himself in the bathroom, when Draco grabbed his arm for a change, and said one more thing: "And remember, Potter, this is just sex. I still hate you. Completely and honestly."
Draco had grown up living in the kind of world that follows wars. A world where everyone knows what is right and what is wrong. (Right is what won. Wrong is what lost.) A world than knows pain and loss. Not that his family had lost much. Which meant that his family was part of the winners, right?
bless you all, thanks for reading, please leave comments with all your thoughts, and im a bit sorry that there was not that much actual interaction between drarry in this one (but i love pansy sooooooo i hope you do to)
In an outburst of energy, he stood up and grabbed some items that had been left behind around him. A necklace. A pretty box. A spell.
Both of them felt asleep with a grimace on their faces, and they didn't sleep very well.
Harry had been scared to death when he'd found him in the forest. The dumb idiot was sitting there with just a shirt in the middle of the cold, and he'd looked so lost that Harry still couldn't get rid of the feeling of terror. So when Malfoy came out of the bathroom, still with dark shadows under his eyes and a somewhat doubtful stance, but with his hair neatly combed and glancing at Harry with the softest eyes he'd ever directed at him, Harry beamed widely.
"I'm just saying he doesn't deserve you. Not as a friend. Not as
"Too queer for your popular sports kid standards?" asked Malfoy without bothering to open his eyes.
"No!" Pansy quirked her head at him, dangerously. "I mean, yes! But I don't think he is reallyÂ going to leave me alone, you know."
"Because I have no clue of what the fuck it means!"
"What do you mean why? Because I was horny and-"
, but it was not aggressive, not hateful. He spoke as if was having fun, as if he was actively controlling his voice to sound warm and
"I have a plan to help Malfoy and Harry."
While he was dealing with the stupidly thin pages, he managed to check the book cover, and after the extra-long time he needed to focus on the letters and put them together, he realised that it was a familiar book.
"Now, take out your wands. You are going to practice the
Draco Malfoy looked at the mirror. He was not even a bit surprised by the image in the glass. His paleness that in the past years had shined bright as the full moon, looked now sick, like old china that was one touch away to break into a million pieces. The bags under his eyes were black and were getting deeper. His cheekbones were too visible, and they did not look aristocratic and proud anymore, but deadly. Draco's reflection eyed him with despise. He still managed to straighten his shoulders as he had learned to do when he was three. He put on an impregnable mask to cover all the sadness that his silver look might have spilled and stepped out of his room, no weakness or desperation to be seen.
"Listen, I didn't want to-"
Malfoy was ready and easily dodged the spell.
His inner critical voice used to sound like Hermione. Which was annoying. Now it sounded like Malfoy. Which was worrying.
want Potter to shower him. Pity he was too exhausted to speak. "Okay, ready? We are moving to the bed and then you can sleep more comfortably. You can just lay all your weight on me, but I need you to make a tiny effort to stand up, okay? Think that it is all to arrive to a warm, comfy bed, much better than the cold and hard bathroom floor, I promise. It will be super easy."
"When I am able to concentrate on what I am reading, sure."
"It's just- You know how it is our last week in this room..."
"I'm more concerned about how I'll deal without having the Chosen One constantly stalking me."
stupid thing is making me crazy, Potter. Blame yourself, it's you I can't even look at without losing my mind, you absolute moron-"
"Not like you, my dear, I assure you. My most recent discovery is Sebastian, though."
"You just managed to ruin green for me, Potter."
"And do you think that's selfish?"
"But how did it happen?" she pushed. "What were you doing, what were you saying-"
Potter jumped like he was also feeling some kind of electricity in the air.
"What do you mean?"
"Listen, Potter," he said without looking at him. "We have to get rid of this situation today, so you better shut your big mouth and don't go around provoking."
"Barely," replied Draco.
"You are a-," he mumbled. "You. You are a piece of- You huge. Merlin, I hate you."
Harry kept forgetting what an insufferable bitch Malfoy was, but he breathed in to try to keep it cool. He didn't want to fight with Malfoy tonight.
"No! No! Really, no! Fuck. It's not that. Of course I don't want-"
"Well, nobody asked you to eat my neck out but look at this," Draco said, as he pointed the very clear and very red spot on his lower neck, right above his collarbone. "Pretty crazy for somebody that is completely uninterested in me."
"Now you are just being creepy," said Potter, after leaving everything on Draco's desk. And then he started walking towards the bed, to the place where Draco was seating. And Draco panicked.
He was alone in the Room of Requirements. Alone. Always alone.
And then he arrived.
"It was okay. Yesterday I was too tired to dream."
, but he made sure to stay the furthest away from Potter that the mattress allowed.
And then Harry moved. He did not want to confront Malfoy anymore. He hid in his bed and closed the curtains shut.
"I don't know. Normal."
And then Harry felt how a familiar body slithered under his blankets next to him.
"Call it as you wish. Sex is a normal thing, and I am not ashamed that I like it." Draco almost believed the self-confidence in his own voice, specially considering how little sexual contacts he had had during his life. "Yesterday I was horny and you were nearby, so I kissed you. It's not that deep."
was he looking like
"It- It's okay, Potter. I'm okay," he managed to tell him. But he was still shaking violently.
uncovered.
Potter looked like he'd been slapped, and then it was him who put on a mask to hide some kind of pain in his green eyes. It was a pathetic mask.
And then Malfoy licked his lips. Wet red lips. Harry could not stop staring. Closer. He was trapped. Closer. He could not turn away. Closer.
"Besides," Snape continued, completely disregarding Draco, "back at the beginning of the month, Potter was late for the Opening Ceremony. Nymphadora Tonks found him on the train back to London, paralyzed and with a broken nose of his own. No one knows how that happened because Potter did not make any accusations, but we know both know it was you, don't we? So maybe you don't want to push it."
Hermione laughed uncomfortably. She did not know how to interpret the situation. Malfoy and Harry had always been oblivious to their surroundings when they were fighting, and they tended to keep track of the other when they were in the same room, but Malfoy had never been that obvious and Harry was forcing his neck so much not to turn around, that there was a vein pulsating in his forehead. In all honesty, they were embarrassing. How was it possible that she hadn't realised earlier?
"What is weird is you and me having a conversation."
of attitudes from now on if we want to get rid of this stupidity as soon as possible. Don't disturb me, and I won't disturb you. Don't step on my side of the room, don't touch my stuff and there won't be any problem. Regarding the bathroom, I wake up early and I highly doubt that a Gryffindor like you does not stay in bed as long as possible, so showering won't be a problem. Just clean everything after you use it."
Instead, he turned and walked into the red part of the room. He drew the curtains carefully, not to startle him more than he already was.
"I'm sure you assume a lot of stuff about me, Potter, and I am sure most of it is incorrect," he declared, closing his eyes again, but then he continued speaking. "No one can deny that it is remarkable to live without magic, but some muggles have also managed to invent their own kind of magic with words, or music, or painting. Art is objectively admirable. Wizards don't need art because we have enough magic already, but muggles had to be more creative." Malfoy suddenly opened his eyes in shock. "Whatever, I am not going to discuss my world views with you. I don't have the energy right now."
"Are you stupid? Or you just say stupidities when you are bored?"
Potter frowned and his glasses slid a bit down his nose. Potter the thing of pushing the glasses back to their place. Draco had never thought of that as cute, but it suddenly was, maybe because Potter was staring at him fixedly with his bright green eyes and Draco was in a state of mind in which all the details of his face were fascinating.
"Discrete so that no one knows that their big hero Harry Potter is gay?"
But he would have to cross the entire castle to reach the kitchen.
"Well, you know how Malfoy is a scumbag..."
Okay, right. So Potter was dreaming about him. Wonderful. Bloody brilliant. For a second, Draco felt like fainting, because he was sick, with the
bath."
"Are you even listening to me?" he replied, looking annoyed, and finally putting on his pyjamas. "Better?"
They were sitting at the Great Hall, having dinner. Hermione had been muttering for half an hour about this and that. The last part of her monologue had focused on the third component of the Golden Trio and how he'd been missing.
"No excuses, I will be firing him. What a loss. My dear Morgana, you cannot expect loyalty from anyone this days."
Plus, he was starving, as Potter had sharply pointed out. And now the whole room was impregnated with the juicy and tasty smell of Hogwarts' special baked potatoes. If he was not mistaken, his nostrils also detected something sweet, like hot chocolate or caramel apples.
"So what is it that you do until midnight?"
But again, what was he planning to say?Â "I know you hate me, but
"Where were you, then? What happened? Why do you look like this?"
"Not mine, Harry's. If we are right, and he cares."
"Oh, come on, you never thought that him considering Cedric so attractive was a bit gay?"
Potter was looking at him straight in the eye, daringly. Draco stared back firmly, ignoring how blushed his face must have been at the moment. Potter could not know that he wanted to run away. Draco had never been scared of him, but this was different. This was a whole new different kind of terrorising. The kind that apparently Potter was great at.
But he deserved to be alone.
Draco caught how he changed his mind and smirked with the corner of his lips. Maybe Potter was able to control his neuron when he had enough motivation. He was glad that he'd been able to
It did not take long for Potter to come back to reality, for his brain to function again and realise. Realise that once again they had gotten too close. Realise that Draco was a horrible person that he most definitely did not want close to him.
"Is it Voldemort? Did he make you a Death Eater?"
"It's called vomiting, Potter. It happens when one is sick. And personally, I'd rather be alone while I'm at it. So don't worry, and close the door after you leave."
The professors should have seen it coming.
Until he heard the room door opening and a shriek behind his back.
"What's that?" asked Draco, noticing the lines of ink across the parchment.
"You took me by surprise."
better?
"Good, so basically the curse
"I know that that means that you also have no clue how to do it non verbally."
And off went Snape, his black cloak loyally after him. And a startled Draco had no other option but to follow.
Ron stopped to think about it for a second and then said:Â "That he is a Death Eater?"
"It's not pity, okay? You scared me back there, that's what it is."
Then, Draco opened that cabinet again because he was a self-torturing imbecile, and the dead bird hadn't moved. "Wake up, you stupid creature!" Draco grabbed the nonsensically small dead body and threw it across the room. It was disgusting.
"So? What was that?," asked Hermione the moment the door was closed.
"We have a follow up meeting at Snape's office now!" Harry shouted against the bathroom door.
Draco inhaled deeply. Potter had said "we" as if they had something in common- As if they were living something similar even though their situations were opposites. Or maybe Draco was reading too much into it and it had just been a way of speaking, a way of not sounding too selfish by saying "us" instead of "I".
"Then you can leave, don't go to the room except to sleep. Avoid him. And if you feel that you can't, then come to me. I can make sure you are distracted, alright? We'll study or whatever you want."
"Took you long enough!!"
"But we are on detention," he said weakly. "We have to share a room. I can't ignore him forever."
Draco punched her in the arm, and his face went pink. Which was embarrassing to witness.
Malfoy sat on his pillow, grabbed a fork, and eagerly started eating, without waiting for a reply.
"I don't know, 'Mione."
"Ready!" Potter cried, before coming back to the room with the sleeves of his sweater pulled up to his elbows and steam in his glasses. It was an unbearably adorable sight.
There still was a lot of food, but Harry kept eating, and waiting, and thinking of all the ways in which he was going to shout at Malfoy the next time he saw him.
"I don't care about Quidditch right now."
"So what are you saying? That he likes me or what?"
Harry entered the room silently. He had actually not gone to their bedroom directly after leaving Ron and Hermione, because he also did not want to face Malfoy and have uncomfortable conversations with him. Now it was late, around eleven in the night, and he was not expecting Malfoy to be there yet, but he still did not want to be too noisy. Of course, there was no one there to be bothered by the noise. Harry swallowed that feeling that was too close to disappointment. What did he want? Malfoy waiting for him with food like he always did? Why would he want that if he had determined to not talk to Malfoy ever again?
It was a simple plan.
"Why the fuck did you not play? What are you sitting here for when there's Quidditch?"
"You are delusional, Granger. The world doesn't work like that."
Draco wanted to stop trembling then, but his body didn't feel his own. Potter, who couldn't stop himself from invading his personal space, held Draco's hands trying to stop them from moving uncontrollably. "Goodness, you are freezing. How long have you been sitting out here, you fool?"
"So you don't care, right? This is
"Tell me, Saint Potter," said Draco softly. "If your parents were alive, wouldn't you do whatever you had to to prevent them from dying?"
. It was not nice. It had
"It was an accident!"
"Oh, please," replied Draco. "Even if it was, you'd lose."
It was then when Draco noticed the scar. From such a short distance, it was as if he had never seen it before. From afar, it seemed like a clean cut, but it was in fact ugly, as if it had been forcefully sewed together. It spread through Potter's forehead like a disease, and it seemed cold and dark. Dead. Draco could feel the evil magic that had caused that scar. In contrast, his green eyes were wildly alive, transparent to all that he was feeling at the moment. Anger, annoyance, and what was that right there? Surprise? Understanding? Pity? Potter could not
"It's
"Enough!" hissed Draco, completely horrified. "Jeez, I have been traumatised forever. Be proud, I'm never having sex again. In fact, that is the best plan. I'm not doing anything with Potter ever again, happy?"
"That's not new, though, he dragged us to Knocturn Alley already. You know, when they almost caught us because of you."
He breathed like a chimney. Maybe Potter smoked, it had never occurred to him. The image of Potter smoking was funny. He was too ridiculous to pull it off, probably would choke to death.
. Fuck you a million times."
"And your way of showing that was falling asleep?" asked Potter, laughing a bit.
"Harry."
Harry saw how the mess in Malfoy's silver eyes became an impregnable iron fortress. The mask was up once again. That made him stand up as well with a piercing pain in the chest.
"Ron?" Harry asked confusedly. "Where the fuck am I?"
"Malfoy?" he begged.
Draco's mark hurt as if He knew the traitorous thoughts he had been having. Draco shivered. What he hated most of all was the fear. Not being able to move without the paralyzing realization that he was trapped.
But Potter was enhanced by hate and magic. The punch was unstoppable. Draco felt himself flying across the room to end up falling to the ground with a broken nose. The second one in less than a month.
Tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, ta-
"If you were straight-forward and told me what exactly you are planning, then I would be able to consider collaborating with you."
"I don't know what you are talking about," said Harry defensively. "We don't even talk to each other."
him. No one was allowed to pity a Malfoy, no pity, no compassion, because Malfoys never allowed the rest to see their weaknesses. Never. But especially not Harry Potter, his sworn enemy since they were eleven. Why couldn't he push him away then? Why on earth was he thinking that his green eyes were almost pretty? And what was the need to stand so close?
Draco knew three things when Potter barged in the room like a freaking tornado. First, Weasley and Granger knew about whatever the hell was going on between them. Second, Potter had remembered Katie Bell and the whole Death Eater thing. And third, Draco found angry Harry Potter quite enjoyable. He wasn't sure if it was the red cheeks or the sparkling eyes, but watching Potter bursting with emotion did something for his lower stomach. It was embarrassing, but then again, it was probably the Gryffindor disease he'd caught with all the kissing.
"But if I'd been a guy, with my technique? It would have been seconds!"
"You don't understand!" he said a bit too excitedly, but the Professor was getting on his nerves. "I hate him! That will never change!"
Draco wanted to strangle him. They had been so close.
Damn him.
"Yeah, she told me last night. You would have heard if you had been here." Ron used an evidently accusing tone, too explicit to be taken hundred percent seriously.
Racism is a plague. It is everywhere. We grow in schools were children are bullied on the basis of race or where their parents come from. The mainstream media and fictional worlds only tell the white stories (Harry Potter is the whitest story ever, and JK Rowling had the audacity to call the only racialized character she has Cho Chang). We have the duty to unlearn white supremacy, we have the duty to deconstruct our racist tendencies and to use our white privilege to fucking put down a system that needs people to die and suffer for others to thrive.

"Whatever, Malfoy."
Harry looked back into his eyes. Malfoy looked completely shaken, gaze wide open and face bright red. But he was also rabid. Harry felt a terrible urge to ran away and hide, but his legs were not cooperating one bit. His mouth was not cooperating either, because he knew he was supposed to say sorry or something, but his throat was completely dry and he was sure that if he tried to talk, the sound would not be flattering at all.
"Now, before you leave, shall we review what we have learnt about Tom Riddle today?"
They went silent, and Draco was, once again, too conscious of Potter's breathing. Draco was so concentrated on how Potter's breathing sounded, that he missed the moment when he adapted his own respiratory rhythm to Harry's.
"I don't even like guys!"
Draco, astonished and angry to be so obviously the subject of his mockery, got rid of Potter's grip. Not for long, though, as Potter had the audacity to hold his arm again.
Tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac-
As John Boyega, who literally plays a cop who quit the force in Star Wars says, BLACK LIVES HAVE ALWAYS MATTERED.
"So, are you going to kiss me or what?" asked Draco impatiently. She was truly beautiful. She had pretty brown eyes, although they were not as expressive and alive as. Well, as nobody. There was no need for stupid comparisons.
Something trembled deep in the silver pupils, just for a second. Malfoy opened his mouth to say something back, but nothing came out.
"I really hope you don't mean sexually, Granger."
"Nothing I was planning on discussing with you."
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry did not know what to say. The sight of Malfoy's neck was too much to keep pretending that he wasn't hot as fuck. But then Malfoy smiled evilly, and Harry remembered how he was supposed to not come close to Malfoy ever again.
"What a pity. I'm sure that would've been an image to remember," and as Draco said that, he realised his lower body agreed fervently. Potter was cornered against the wall. He looked like a lost fawn, but he was also staring at Draco's mouth eagerly. "Maybe Gryffindors are not as brave as they claim to be."
Potter frowned. Why did he think that he was allowed to frown? Another mystery.
"Malfoy and Harry?"
"What?" he finally answered, completely disoriented.
"Draco, darling, do you feel like doing something?" asked Pansy, with a sugary voice.
"Is all going good, Harry Potter, sir?" asked Dobby.
. Freaking Potter's stupid lips and whatever contagious disease he had passed on to him. Damn the moment when he
Dumbledore smirked as if he'd just witnessed a private joke.
"If you want."
"Come on, Malfoy! Don't be a jerk! It's getting dark and it's freezing."
"What do you mean? Why not?"
Draco hid in behind his curtains, furious. Potter did not grab his arm this time. Good, because he would not have been able to respond to his acts. There was no way in which he could express how much he hated him.
. Draco smiled and his stomach ache eased. He could have purred right there. Potter
is just sex. I don't give a shit about you and you don't give a shit about me, but it's still sex, and you fucking liked it. I don't care if you are not able to accept that."
Harry showered after draining the bathtub, and he tried to ignore the scents that floated in the air. He also tried to cool down his burning body with icy water, but that worked as badly as it had in the morning. The knowledge that Malfoy was at the other side of the door only made it worse.
"Why don't you tell me then? Why don't you just tell me what were you doing all day?" he pleaded.
"Or what?"
than his stupid father. That he was able to
to actually feel bad. "You can't keep your hands away from me or what?" He tried to sound cocky and sure of himself, but based on the look of Malfoy's face, he failed.
"We need to talk to him."
Disclaimer: In this place transphobes are not welcome. Fuck JK Rowling and stan Daniel Radcliffe. Trans women are obviously women, it is not a debate.
Harry needed to look at them closer. Malfoy stood totally rigid but Harry just wanted closer. Malfoy did not yield, he did not move an inch. Harry briefly gazed at the face. He was still wearing the mask. Glaring. Harry needed closer. Was that alarm in the silver eyes? Closer. Harry hated the mask. He was so mad at the face that wore the mask. Closer. At the fucking red lips. Closer. At the breath that he felt in his own face. Closer.
"Crowley, Potter! Just grab it and go!" he snapped when Potter finally was within reach of his nightstand.
The silence came back for a while.
"Wrecking my nerves, you absolute jerk!"
Silence.
"I've been looking like this all year, Potter. Sorry to disappoint," his tone was terrible, bitter, sour,
"There must have been a context, right?"
The nightmares had started after the fourth year. After He had come back. He had known then where the Malfoy family's loyalties stood. He should have known earlier, but his naive self had elected to believe in the innocence of his parents.
"What do you mean?"
"So wanna take off your shirt and go again?" Potter asked, breaking the safe distance that Draco had established.
He hated that he could not escape, that the only option he had was to do exactly as he had been commanded. Maybe if he had the balls, he would kill Harry Potter and just end with it, be a hero himself, make the Dark Lord respect him, and earn a good vacation to forget. That for sure would be easier than killing Dumbledore.
Merlin, he must be mad. Just sex. What kind of teenager agrees to "just sex". As if Harry knew a single shit about sex. As if he was not the most virgin person he knew. Not to mention that Harry was getting into "just sex" with Draco Bloody Malfoy of all people. Malfoy, who, for some reason, was gazing at him across the Great Hall as if he didn't know that they were supposed to be a secret.
. "Doesn't matter. I don't know why you are insisting on this."
Somewhere in the back of his head, Draco wondered why they had not fought. Everyone in Hogwarts had expected an open war. But they had voluntarily and spontaneously not fought.
"Let's seat," said Pansy as she grabbed Hermione's hand, more softly this time. The Gryffindor girl was too shocked to resist. They sat and Pansy dropped her hand as if it was nothing odd that she had taken it in the first place.
Draco did not look as Potter got dressed again. The Slytherin put out his wand and cleaned both himself and his bed, where they'd end up in. Then, he laid down and hid under his blankets with all the intentions of falling asleep again.
"You know a lot about that, right Potter? The Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, famous and wonderful Potter. I'm sure that's a big burden."
"McGonagall told me yesterday. I was going to tell you last night, but you were late and-"
. He was back to the first day. Except with an extra dead person.
His chest was compressing. He couldn't breathe. And Draco fell. Somewhere in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.
"Interpret it as you will," he said calmly, carelessly pulling his blond hair away from his face. And then he swiftly walked away.
And then the door opened, and no shout came out. The Slytherin entered the room, with his hair all over the place (a couple of locks were freely dancing over his forehead) and a deeply tired and somewhat stressed look. Then he saw Harry, eating on the floor, glaring at him too directly. In no time, he straightened up and put the hair back in its place, and defiantly glared back. Harry did not dare to open his mouth.
Potter smiled widely. It was obnoxious to smile so much. Draco had to look away.
"Wow, Potter," Draco hissed, trying not to care. Trying not to lose his cool despite everything that Potter was saying and doing. "You surprise me. Who knew you were such an observant person? You should include it in your CV: Harry Potter, the Chosen One, an expert in creepily watching how others live their lives even if they don't concern him at all."
"Doing what?" Potter breathed out, and Draco wanted Potter to back off and allow his brain connections to function again, but he did not have the force of will left to fight his own distasteful and tragic impulses. "Doing what, prince?"
"Suspicious? You mean besides the fact that he skips every class and he always goes to sleep extremely late?" asked Ron bitterly.
Infuriated, he barged in the green and red room.
Silence.
"Yes, yes, you were saying that Harry-"
. Soft and classy, but borderline
"Yes? I think they are getting somewhat close?"
"Whatever, Potter," Draco gave him a deadly grimace.
"What do you mean you know?" asked Pansy in a high pitch, looking at him with wide open eyes and dropping their held hands.
"Would you? Would you tell me if you could?" asked Harry softly. Malfoy wasn't red anymore. All the blood had vanished from his face. Now he was white. Terrifyingly white. He started shaking, and Harry felt weak. "I know it is weird, but you can trust me. Maybe I can help or-"
"Wait, are you sure?" Potter asked, standing up quickly for someone that was disoriented after having just woken up. He stopped Draco taking his arm (duh). "I normally remember what I dream-"
"What are you even saying?" asked Potter, and it was a disgrace how pertinent the question was.
The redhead seemed to relax a bit. He focused his stare on Harry, and nodded nervously. As if he was finally ready to say it.
"Oh, feelings. What a marvellous thing. Hate. Love. There is nothing quite as intense as those two. I envy you, Harry. This worn out body is no longer able to feel those kinds of rushed emotions."
"Oh, come on, don't be so
a man.
"But maybe we can go for a second round of just sex," suggested Draco a bit too quickly to keep his act completely cool and impersonal.
. I will go
Draco opened his eyes but he needed some time to process his surroundings. The first thing he noticed was that he was unbearably sticky. Then, that he was stuck to an almost naked Harry Potter. Literally stuck, like with sweat and saliva and semen. Finally, he checked his arm, which was thankfully well covered by his wide open shirt. It was the middle of the night. He breathed in deeply.
Ron was right. It all made sense, in a weird and unexpected way, but logical after all.
chewing noises, but because Harry Potter represented all that he was supposed to hate. All the reasons why he had to do what he had to do.
"Well, I did. So move, Potter! Now!" Draco felt his voice rising.
Harry's face went white. He'd been preparing himself to deny it. He'd been training to laugh it off. But there he was now, completely terrified, unable to look at his friends in the eyes.
"Mr. POTTER!" McGonagall had to shout for Harry to finally react.
Although he hoped it was not too obvious, Draco felt his body shaking and his face on fire. What the hell was he doing speaking like that? Potter kept saying
"And you need to get this close to tell me that?" Harry spoke on his lips again. Their irregular breaths mixing and fighting between them.
"No, you don't get it. This is a terrible situation, Ron."
"You don't trust me? Ouch," she said jokingly.
"Mr Potter," he started, voice deep with mockery. "Do you intend to stand there forever blocking the way? Are our chairs
His lips were the reddest thing in sight, and although they were straightened in a hard and mean line, they looked fucking good, all delicate and well defined, as if they had been painted with the finest of brushes. Only Malfoy could have insanely pretty lips like those.
"Of course not, it's just that I didn't know you read muggle books."
Harry could not avoid starting coughing loudly. All McGonagall, Snape, and Malfoy squinted at him.
"Why did you do
Potter had also left too early that morning. Draco always woke up before him. Every single day since they'd started sharing a room, and actually, also before that. Mornings were Draco's Potter-free times. So what was Potter doing disturbing their well-established dynamic? It almost felt as if Potter was avoiding him. How dared he? Draco was the avoider, thank you very much. That's how they worked, and it was fine like that. Potter could not just change it all of a sudden. There were rules, okay? Unspoken rules, but rules nonetheless.
"Is that my tie?" Malfoy asked, and for a moment, Harry didn't understand what the fuck did he mean.
"So what?" Malfoy squinted at him. He was really pulling the
He remembered the Quidditch match against Slytherin the following Saturday, and the practice he had scheduled for that evening. He should probably get going. He should also be more excited about being the team's Captain, but there he was, having a bath and obsessing about Malfoy's whereabouts. It was just that he could not ignore the weirdness of it all. Malfoy's odd behavior and tiredness seemed more urgent than Quidditch. Especially now that they had to share a fucking room.
Saturdays were normally Harry's best days. Ron and him would gradually wake up and get dressed with absolutely no rush. Hermione would arrive to their room and hurry them up so that there would still be something left for breakfast. But even Hermione was more relaxed on Saturdays and there was always plenty of breakfast left.
"So what am I supposed to do with all this breakfast now?"
"Well, I cannot be sure, but he disappears from the Marauder's Map without leaving the castle, so I reckon..."
"Wait, you were having dinner
"Do you think it might be that he doesn't trust us?"
Harry always caught the snitch before Malfoy, but Malfoy at least
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco gazed at the shut door for a while. It still was the middle of the night, but there was no way he was going to be able to fall asleep again. So he just sat at his bed, facing the door. He was not able to do anything else. He was not even angry, just terrified that Potter would never return. He scratched the Dark Mark without even noticing the pain. Maybe Potter'd been right. He was not worth it.
the truth.
"Wait, so what you are saying is that you
"Harry, where does he go when he is not in your room or in class?" asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. Harry also ignored Ron.
Harry would forever be amazed by how Ron managed to go from the most serious of loyalties to low key brotherhood in a matter of seconds. He was able to make Harry feel loved and important, and make it seem as if it was effortless. If he saw Hermione worrying too much, he would crack the perfect joke to make her laugh. If it was a matter of life or death, he would not hesitate to put himself in the middle. If he did not understand what was going on (which happened often), he would just stand there facing the unknown bravely, and never once thinking of leaving them behind. Ron gave friendship a whole new meaning, and Harry knew he was what made them better. Hermione and him. They were better because they had Ron.
Draco truly needed it to end.
Now, please be my guest and try it out, apply it to yourself."
"Are you scared, Malfoy? Why are you not talking, prince? You cannot defend yourself?"
"Did you sweat much wherever you were passing the night?"
This was Malfoy.
"You know that Potter and Draco slept together, don't you?"
"A question for whose answer you couldn't care less. Leave me alone already."
"What is your mother going to say when she discovers that you ruined her shirt, Malfoy? Why, were they out of shirts for men?"
"Really?" said the Slytherin Head Teacher. "There have been... testimonies of... shouting... in the middle of the night."
The past days had been full of things he rather wanted to avoid. For instance, he wanted to avoid being closer than a meter near Malfoy. He also preferred to not talk to Malfoy. Shouting and insulting was okay. But talking was off limits. Talking made his mind go through unknown and dangerous paths that he most definitely wanted to avoid. In an ideal world, he would have liked to avoid thinking of Malfoy entirely, but the fact that they lived together, both sharing a room and going to the same school, made that hard. He had eventually settled for the avoidance of as many interactions as possible, and to limit the unavoidable encounters to the usual quarrelling they had been engaging in since they were eleven.
Second, Harry Potter was no longer his area of expertise, and he had turned out to be a
Harry couldn't know, because he didn't care. Right or wrong, he still
Apparently, Malfoy was not coming back. Maybe he was in Slytherin. He for sure had enough people licking his ass to have somewhere to crash. The jerk would have no problem in making someone sleep in the ground as long as he had a bed. Maybe he was sleeping
Harry needed time. He needed time to let it sink in. He'd spoken too much. So much more than he'd planned. He was sure that his friends were going to leave any minute soon. However, they were too struck to move.
"But-"
on him.
"But it's my bed," whined Draco miserably.
"Well, it's far away from the library and everything, and-"
There was a loud crash.
Harry hated the new room. It smelled weird. Good, but weird. He missed the noise, the mess, his friends. At that point of the night, Neville would be putting on his pyjamas, ready to sleep, and Ron probably was still in the common room with Hermione, playing chess or commenting on his misfortune. Seamus and Dean, Ginny, and all the rest were probably hanging around too. And he had to be locked up in there, in a small room lost somewhere in the castle, alone. Because, of course, Malfoy had not returned in the whole evening.
Harry was not even going to question it any longer. It was
(See the end of the chapter for
He kicked the Vanishing Cabinet, which mocked him by not moving one bit.
"What the fuck, Malfoy?" he spluttered from the floor, and only then he noticed that he had no clothes on besides his underpants. "Shit."
Yes! The apple was back. Beautiful apple with the beautiful bite that served as an identification. He was a freaking genius, modesty aside.
"Harry."
"Whatever," she replied blushing slightly. "Can you focus? We have to do something about Harry."
He kept talking, trying to be reassuring or useful, whatever would stop the screaming.
Malfoy's blond hair was messy, all around his head, and his cheeks were pink because of the fever, and Harry thought that it was not fair that even at his worse, he still managed to look like a fucking prince. Could it be true? What Malfoy had said about not despising muggles? Could it be that his views of the world were more than a copy of his father's? But what were his views then? After all, he'd heard Malfoy call Hermione names too often, and even if there were some decent, smart beliefs buried somewhere inside him, Harry couldn't just erase years of insults against both Ron and Hermione. Not to mention Katie's almost murder.
"Swear it. Swear to me that what happened with Katie had nothing to do with you. Swear it to my face."
After that, no one dared to speak.
did it smell good.
"My eyes are green," Potter said, and Draco was petrified for a second, hearing that too loud and too clear in his head. He really didn't know what to answer to that. What was there to answer? Yes, Potter? I am a sucker for your crazy beautiful green eyes? One part of him wanted to see how Potter would react to that. Only after a few moments of utter shock, Draco realised that he was supposed to insult him for such a self-centred, narcissistic comment.
"You didn't, right? And you also didn't go to breakfast. So it is the first time you eat today, and it is already past midnight. So maybe you do need watching."
"Oh, true, I was forgetting that being in princess Malfoy's presence is a luxury. But I obviously did not mean it like that. I just thought more time had passed, and that meant less time left having to put up with you."
"Okay..." started Hermione, but she didn't know how to continue. She felt pity for Malfoy, but it was still Malfoy. "Okay, and how- How can you know that?"
are the rich kid whose biggest problem is to have his hair messed up, not me."
hope you liked it :)
Harry was used to Malfoy's superiority tone, but he hated how it could still get under his skin.
"Ronald! Shut up!"
Hermione squinted her eyes at him.
"If you were able to shut up while you sleep, I would not have had to come here to shut you up myself," he replied and before he could escape the situation as he was ready to do, Potter grabbed him by the arm, with that entitlement that was so typical of him.
Harry opened the drawer feeling tipsy, which was stupid. It was not that weird to read out loud to your sick roommate. He'd never done it for Ron because Ron was not a person that read often. But it was a normal thing. He struggled to open the book, because his fingertips felt numb, and he was grateful that Malfoy did not see how ridiculously clumsy he was.
"Something like what?" Harry asked, trying to sound casual.
"And how is that related to Potter distracting him?"
When he arrived to the room he shared with Potter, he was exhausted. But he needed to get at least a couple hours of sleep if he did not want to collapse while he carried out the most stupid assassination attempt ever. It was around four in the morning, so he was not expecting to find Potter awake. But there he was. Having breakfast in the floor. At four AM.
. It was mental.
Harry shivered. The little voice had never sounded more like Malfoy.
"Really?" asked Snape.
"So what do you think it is? Still with the Death Eater idea?"
At some point, Draco gradually stopped shaking and he just stayed still, his head hidden between his knees, too tired for anything else. Harry was scared to move, he just sat there. Stroking his back. Malfoy did not complain.
"You'll survive, Potter. I'm certain that living with Gryffindor neanderthals has its perks."
"What the hell, Potter? What do you care?"
"Draco, we need to talk."
. It was like his entire digestive system was twisting inside him. Besides, his entire body was burning, as if he had a fever, which was an obvious sign of disease. Merlin, how had he not thought that Potter was a likely carrier of all kinds of germs. Draco had done the whole thing to distract him, to stop Potter from accusing him, but he had not been planning to catch an
"And you are not tired now?"
"What the hell is going on, Ronald?"
For a second, Draco thought it might be deemed important that Harry bloody Potter was having wet dreams about him.
"Don't worry, princess. I'll manage. One more day having to see your face before going to sleep and I'll hang myself."
"Allow me a last word before you leave, Harry." Harry sat down again, unable to leave Dumbledore hanging. "As I said, feelings are a wonderful thing, that should be felt and cherished. But they are also dangerous. They can lead to hurried decisions that may later be regretted. Both love and hate are the most powerful things that can cloud your mind, I know that very well. Therefore, it is important to cool down, to reflect on them and give them space, so as not to lose yourself in the chaos that emotions undoubtedly can provoke."
. All that could go wrong had gone wrong. He had accomplished
"Malfoy, are you okay?"
"If you just told me what is it, I could-"
idea, because he had managed not to go crazy during his whole life, and he was not going to allow something as trivial as sharing a room with his declared school rival to do the deal. Really, it was ridiculous that he had endured being almost killed, the loss of his parents, and the life with the Dursleys, only to end up losing his shit because he'd kissed Malfoy a couple of times.
The next silence was the longest so far.
First, the Dark Lord was only fascinating when read upon. In real life, he was just terrifying. But he was now living in his house, and he had marked his arm because he had had the power to do so.
"Truce then?" asked Potter, offering Draco his hand.
"I'm not interested in you! You are the one who insists on kissing me!"
"So... So I have a proposal."
"Pooooooooootter!" he called for the eleventh time, and Harry went to his bed for the eleventh time. The green curtains were opened, and Malfoy was laying with an exaggerated pained face expression which Harry would have dismissed without a second thought if it weren't for the sweaty forehead, the shuddering and the vomits that he'd been witnessing for hours.
"Stop calling me like that. It's sexist to use it as an insult."
Harry was extremely full, so he let himself fall on his back to the ground, wanting to lay down for a little bit, eyes closed. He burped loudly. Not on purpose, mind you. Just a satisfied sound after a good meal. But Malfoy squealed in utterly indignant shock which made Harry's eyes open and stare at him, slightly embarrassed, until he broke, and started laughing loudly.
"But why?"
Bloody Potter. Bloody remorse that consumed him ever since he had heard of Katie Bell. Damn a million times Crabbe and Goyle for not being able to accomplish the simplest of tasks. Damn Potter for accusing him of something he had actually done. Frigging Potter. Freaking pain that was messing with his stomach since he had done
"So maybe it doesn't mean anything."
"Malfoy?"
"Something? Something that is not pure hatred and despise?"
"And do you feel like you can keep this rhythm?"
The cold was getting worse, he could feel his muscles going numb now, and his head hurt like hell. Harry closed his eyes in pain, clenching his teeth strongly.
"Oh, really? So your plan is to stay with your shirt on every single time you do it? Do you know a single shit about sex, my sweet innocent boy? Because sex is mostly about nakedness, and hotness, and wanting to get closer to the other, and getting rid of every piece of clothing so that you can touch the other person as much as possible and before you know it you are shouting "Mpfff, oh yes, Potter, right there, yesssssss, Potteeeeeeeer."
together."
! I believe I told you to
"You are responsible for Katie being in the hospital wing."
Harry felt Malfoy's stare as soon as he bit his toast.
"Let's not jump to conclusions so quickly," answered Hermione. "Before we consider helping him, we should first figure out what is it that we are trying to stop."
Silence and more silence.
"So what the fuck, Malfoy?" Harry asked indignantly. Even if he was not particularly hurt by Malfoy's comment. Insults were more like Malfoy. Insults he could understand. Malfoy was just being Malfoy.
"I don't want to shut up!" Harry also stood up, and (as usual) grabbed his arm to stop him from hiding in his bed. "Can't you just tell me what the fuck is up with you? You are not acting like yourself!"
Draco went back to his bed. Maybe his insomnia had already been useful for the night. And he could not just go now and follow murderous missions. Not after seeing Potter crying, terrified about deaths that had not even happened yet, but that could perfectly happen in the near future.
"She said that thing about our evolution and mingling, right?"
"I know you think it's stupid. But Ron, what is he doing always alone that has him so absorbed to drop
in his chest. It was uncomfortable and Harry didn't know what to do with it.
"Ha, Potter." Draco didn't know where he was getting the energy to act as if he was not going to vaporise right there right now. "You? Entertain me? You would never be able to stand on my level."
A two minutes game.
you want to talk about, Harry. You can tell me."
Please, please, please.
gofundme.com/f/9v4q2-justice-for-breonna-taylor
Then Draco thought that maybe his insomnia would be more productive if he went to work on the Vanishing Cabinet. It took him some more time to actually stand up, but eventually, he silently grabbed his wand and walked towards the door. No one would be awake to care if he was walking around the castle in silk pyjamas.
"And why am I supposed to trust you?"
They did not dare pronounce another word. They swiftly hid in their respective beds.
"Malfoy? Are you awake?"
." Potter looked stupid with that face, not that he didn't always look stupid, and that was not how he sounded at all.
"Wow. That's welcoming," said Hermione.
Why the fuck had he asked?
"But I did not-"
"It's like you are obsessed with me," repeated Malfoy, savouring the words, the effect they had on Potter. "I see. So maybe it's not the hero crap. Maybe it's that you can't stand that somebody hates you. Maybe you can't stand that it's
Harry's eyes were unfocused, blurry with whatever he was feeling, looking at him as if he was lost. "Merlin. You are so

"That's so not what I said."
"I don't understand why you think that it is going to be so hard. It's not like that. I
"You are not. But you can trust that I care about Draco and that this situation worries me enough to come to you."
"I'm going to shower," said Draco as an escape route, and Potter acted all betrayed and confused again, which Draco deliberately avoided thinking about.
And then his mind clicked.
"Sounds like a waste of water," Malfoy mumbled, running away. He reached his trunk giving Harry his back and quickly changed to his class robes.
"Obviously not, Potter. Just move." Malfoy was still trying to pull a defiant stance, but his words sounded like a plea.
Ron looked as if he wanted to say something, Hermione squinted at him, and Harry really
"There are always options! I can-"
Harry dropped his wand in utter rage.
"Do you think you can come up with a way to stop him from going there? Some way to distract him?"
"And what's the counter spell?"
But Potter didn't care. He pushed him a bit and used the power he was exerting in his neck to turn them around, so that now it was Draco the one against the wall. Draco could not think with Potter's hands touching him everywhere, he could barely
He was fine.
"Why not?" he asked miserably. For some reason, those words felt personal. They made him so
"What do you want to prove, prince?"
to make Malfoy blush. He looked ridiculous and
"But it's too late, Professor. He is beyond correction. I cannot help him."
That's when the screams began. The same that he had heard the previous night. The sound was heart-wrenching and Draco missed the loud breathing of earlier. He wanted to leave, to run away. It was too painful to listen to that kind of screaming. During the summer, when the Death Eaters tortured people in the mansion, the howls were similar.
They were not talking about something specific anymore. This was an overt dare, their competitive natures clashing and wanting to tear each other apart.

didn't work. It was pathetic and you just made a fool of yourself. And the part were you got super close to my face, what the hell were you thinking? Potty wanted a kissy?"
"I have a plan," said Hermione, ignoring her.
"I'm not- I'm not malnourished."
Draco wanted to say something but he couldn't find the words to ask Potter to stay with him. Just be there. Without the kissing, without the fighting. Just Potter, with his arms around him, sleeping next to him. And a corner of his mind still knew that it was a dangerous thought to have, that he was supposed to ignore Potter and all the dangerous thoughts he had about him, but Draco allowed himself to rejoice in how safe he felt in that imagined universe where he was allowed to invite Potter to his bed and cuddle with him forever.
"Okay, so you do that," ordered Hermione. "I have an idea in order to neutralize Malfoy, maybe even- Doesn't matter. Just distract him, Harry. I have to send a letter. Ron? Come with me."
"Not the redhead, I'm afraid," said Draco, who did
After some time, Harry stood up, impatient, and started pacing from corner to corner. The sound of his steps, a constant nervous collision of his shoes against the wooden floor.
"Did he say something? Harry, all that has happened is not your fault. The whole magical world knows now that Voldemort is back, and that's on you. You opened their eyes, you fought him, but all the bad stuff, that's on them, and if Malfoy cannot understand what a brave and great person you are, all that he tells you is plain rubbish."
"True! Longest two minutes of my life! You were surprisingly good!"
"Yeah, right, so many convenient accidents."
"Wait, but this was long ago, how come you haven't said anything until now?" asked Hermione, slightly hurt.
"I don't hate green, you know," Potter said, so much passionately that anyone would have thought that he was not just talking about the colour.
And the topic was closed.
Draco went to the bathroom, wanting to quickly wash his face and get some sleep. But nothing was that easy when you shared a dorm with Harry Freaking Potter.
Draco blinked, his cheeks subtly turning pink for a second. He really had not wanted to notice the fact that there was no underwear under Potter's trousers, but his mind was doing its own thing. And then he saw the bathroom, flooded and a complete mess.
Not that he cared.
"It is none of your business. I just have better things to do."
And just like that, having said it all, he disappeared, without leaving any chance for Harry to complain. But he was wrong if he thought he could just order him around, he was tremendously wrong. And Harry was going to make sure that Malfoy understood how wrong he was. If only he knew where Malfoy had gone.
of him. He had not expected to sound like that, almost
Draco felt his face warming up. His mouth was starting to betray the obsessive worshipping thoughts he occasionally had about Potter.
"From
"It's not me I'm concerned about. You fell asleep before I did," he said, his smile moving to his eyes.
It was mortifying, but Potter didn't complain.
"Am I? Because this," he cried, shaking the map, "
"Funny."
"I don't care about Quidditch right now, Potter," repeated Malfoy, as if he was an idiot. Harry felt like an idiot.
Maybe it was he who was having a nightmare. Yep, it had to be a nightmare. There was no way this was happening in real life.
Draco Malfoy entered the room. He looked terrible.
"I just want to discuss how to avoid the fighting around the school," said Potter, ignoring the obvious discomfort of Draco. "We will never get rid of this detention if we don't learn to do that."
"I have to be ready for everything, darling. No girl should ever be left not taken care of, no matter what's between her legs."
"You do help a lot of people-" Hermione tried to tell him.
"Good that we are not friends, then. That would be terrible. You should shower more often, by the way. You stink. And use cold water, you are like a walking oven."
Pansy smiled and pressed her mouth against his. Just for a few seconds, because she noticed quickly that something was off. It was as if Draco was kissing differently. He tasted weird, and he did weird things with his mouth. Wilder things, borderline dirty, surely not as careful and delicate as he used to be when she'd taught him the ideal technique. If she didn't know better, she would have said that it was almost a Gryffindor way to kiss. So she pried away.
idiot.
Kissing had already been too much. So what the fuck was this then. What on earth were they doing? What was Malfoy thinking off? It made absolutely no sense.
"I would be if it were true. But it sounds fake and flawed and it will not work."
"Apparently, Harry cares about Malfoy now. So I am trying to understand if Malfoy cares about Harry too."
Draco was breathing loudly, trying to control the shivering and the impending panic attack that was spreading through his chest and arms, all the way to his feet. Suddenly, all he could feel was the burning Death Eater mark in his arm. He needed Potter to leave.
Harry groaned in frustration, but he drifted apart from him. He headed towards the bathroom, but he added because he needed to say the last word: "It concerns me if you are planning on arriving so late every single night. I don't have to stand the noises or the light when you forget to do your homework during the day. Don't tell me why you left Quidditch, whatever, but I don't buy that bullshit that you don't care about it anymore. I just hope you are not lying like that to yourself."
"Pathetic, Potter. And you are the
hope you liked it!! please tell me what you think!!!!
"Oh, come on, I must have a fucking hole in the back of my head, Malfoy. We were supposed to be discrete about this!"
"She probably means that bullshit you pulled five minutes ago in the Great Hall," explained Ron, not completely joking.
Draco didn't close the curtains of his bed, though. And Harry didn't know what to make out of that. Nothing, probably. But after he cast the lights off and lied in his bed too, he also didn't close his curtains.
"Shut up, Potter. What were you expecting? Breakfast together and cute little kisses? Wake the fuck up."
"Yes. Of course. He didn't admit it, obviously. But I'm certain. It's just- It's just that I don't know what am I supposed to do- I don't even think he did it on purpose-"
"You kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, true. Oops." Malfoy sarcastically frowned.
The Hospital Wing.
"Can you stop with that nonsense, Parkinson? I just told you that I didn't!"
And then it all escalated. They fell in a bed that could have been green or red, and neither of them backed down. It was a dare after all and they were not going to lose.
The apple vanished. Draco closed the door, and opened it again.
How to function normally after watching your worst enemy panic? After telling him you'd
"I can be a great distraction if I want to," blurted Harry. He
Harry did it without thinking, expecting that nothing would happen. That's how counter spells usually worked: they had no effect if there was no magic to counter. Then he started feeling cold, quickly. He felt his body trembling violently and out of control.
The public was relieved to see that they were back to normal. The mocks and jibes across the Great Hall were one of the unmovable truths of Hogwarts, and it was comforting to hear them again. Meanwhile, in private they would not look at each other. They were able to move around their shared dorm without acknowledging each other in the slightest. They had changed their schedules so that the probabilities of running into each other were dramatically reduced. Harry wentÂ back to studying in the library with Ron and Hermione, and Draco arrived from his mysterious night activities later than ever. Harry stopped eating in the floor. Draco started bringing his own dinner. They ate inside their beds, silently. They pretended to sleep when the other was around. They acted as if the other did not exist.
"I'm just a bit tired, I guess."
"That is not it. If we don't do anything, it will be worse."
"So you have been spying on him. Let me guess, you looked for him on the map." For some reason, Ron found that amusing.
meant that she was disgusted by the whole idea. But what Harry understood with
Harry's mind was blank of things to say. And he did not need to stare while Malfoy changed clothes.
"But not like this!"
"I seriously don't know how peasant minds work. Maybe you think that you have something to announce to the world."
"Can you stop with the staring, Malfoy? It's creepy as fuck. Merlin, as if you had never seen a butt in your life."
"I didn't want to hurt your ego. You would have been completely insufferable if you'd thought you didn't do a good job."
"Don't worry, Dobby," Harry laughed. "I will save these salads for Malfoy, I promise."
Harry left. He used to love DADA, but Dumbledore had to give the teacher position to Snape.
Potter was imprisoned against the wall, but he moved so much. He was all over the place, rubbing against him, touching him everywhere. And where the hell did he learn to kiss like that? Like he had nothing to hide. Nothing to lose and everything to give. Suicidal. Because that's who Harry Potter was. And it made Draco crazy. To feel his tongue in every corner of his mouth, to kiss him as if they were fighting. A clash of flesh, teeth and saliva, a struggle to touch and to get closer and closer. And closer. And
"You are the one that cannot stay still for fifteen insignificant minutes and have to annoy the hell out of everyone around."
"Maybe I can ask Professor McGonagall about the details of the detention."
"Of course."
He really had far more important stuff to think about. Far more important than his breakdown in front of Potter, or than Potter's stupid self-reproaching nightmares. Definitely more relevant than Potter's arms hugging him, or Potter's breath on his face. Not that he had been able to avoid those thoughts, but at least he had been able to avoid Potter enough to protect his mind from more foolish distractions.
. And Draco had never been able to say no to Potter.
"Believe me, I wish I didn't," Hermione interrupted him. "So... how is
"Draco Lucius Malfoy! Tell me that it is not true! Tell me that you didn't sleep with freaking Harry Potter, saviour of the Wizarding World and your, I quote you, "arch nemesis" since First year. Tell me!"
For a moment, there was silence, but then the noises came back. It seemed like he was actually making an effort to be quieter, but it was unbearable anyways. Had no one ever taught him to eat like a person? So Draco went out of his small shelter of green pillows and velvet, and sat on the floor, facing Potter. He was even more disgusting now that he could see him. At least he chewed with a closed mouth, but his lips were shiny, and his face was red, and even his eyes seemed a bit tearful, from having eaten so much. Morgana, how much had he eaten?
"It's wild," started Potter, and his voice echoed loudly in the room now that the curtains were wide open. Draco heard that voice in the same place where he'd heard him reading Oscar Wilde to him the previous night. "I've gotten so used to you- and how long have we been sharing this room? Not that much, right? Two months maybe?"
Draco felt his heart skip a beat. He didn't have the time nor the energy to talk to Potter. He only wanted to sleep.
"I know that what I am going to say will sound like a wild feat to accomplish, but maybe you should just ignore him."
Apparently it had been Potter the one to find her. Once again, Potter saving the day. A very tiny part of him was thankful, but all the other parts
"But I'm fun, dear, and you need fun. But don't worry, I get it, it is a lose-lose situation for you. If you don't stop me, you lose the dare. If you do, you don't have me. So let's make it interesting, shall we? Let's make it a competition."
"You can do it then,
"Already?" said Harry and Malfoy at the same time.
"It's your words not ours."
Silence again.
But it worked, their unanimous decision to avoid each other. And anyways, that was something that he also preferred to not think about, the stuff that had happened before Ron and Hermione had arrived, before the actual salad incident.
"What the fuck are you saying, Malfoy? I assure you that I would never want others to know about this."
"You look like you want to run away, Malfoy."
"What's up, Malfoy? Lost your
"Granger!"
"Sorry, I missed it when we decided that you had any saying in my schedule," he snapped while changing to his silky pyjamas. He kept doing that, changing clothes without caring that Harry was there. Not that Harry had not seen Ron and the rest do the same back in the Gryffindor dorm. It seemed unlike Malfoy and his poshness, though. To be so careless.
Here are some petitions that you can sign/causes that need fundraising:
Because Saturdays were usually wonderful, Harry was able to notice how lousy this particular one was going to be.
Malfoy wanted to cry. He wanted to laugh. He wanted to destroy Potter's face. He wanted to fall in his enchantment and in his bright crimson bed. His legs felt like they were not able to hold him any longer, and Potter was suddenly holding him by the hips, and staring at Draco's face as if he wanted to drink it until the very last drop.
We need to organise, to hold racists accountable, to protest, to sign petitions, to donate.
"What? How do you know-"
. The maniac psychopathic serpent daunted him. He could not close his eyes without picturing with cruel accuracy his red eyes looking back. He hated it, the feeling that He was watching him, that He knew what and how he was doing. That it was all a sadistic test that he was doomed to fail because his father had failed before him.
Hermione did not love Mondays, but they were not that bad when one studied in a School of Magic. There was no way the day of the week could ruin that, and Hermione tried to remember that every single Monday. Ron and Harry did not appreciate the opportunity enough. For instance, now, neither of her friends, who were sitting in the desks behind her, were paying attention to McGonagall, which was the kind of disrespect Hermione could not stand. One thing was not paying attention to Trelawney, who was a mad woman, or even to professor Binns, who was boring even for her, but come on. McGonagall was one of the best teachers in the School, and what she said was always important and necessary. What were they thinking about anyways? And what was the need of being so obvious? Okay, maybe Harry had reasons to not listen to McGonagall, being the Chosen One and all. He was probably thinking of ways to save the world. But Ronald? He had no excuse. And why was he glaring at Harry? He had been acting weird the past days, and Hermione had decided to let him be, but it was as if he was keeping something from her. Normally, Ron was an open book, but now he kept avoiding her, and changing topics whenever they talked about Harry. It was almost as if her two friends had some kind of secret they could not tell her. And Hermione did not want to start over thinking it, because it probably was some stupid boy thing, but there was always that part of her head she could not control saying that Ron and Harry were better off without her.
want to be sleeping in a room with
"Okay," whispered Harry. Even if he was never going to be able to stop thinking about it.
"That really sounds like you miss me, Potter." The tone was complemented with a cheeky smile now. Draco felt as if he had no control over his facial muscles, which was outrageous. He turned back to his essay, giving his back to Potter, trying to give across a message of "conversation is finished".
Hermione rolled her eyes. "We have to talk."
They had barely talked that year, although Pansy was still pretending in front of the whole School that she was madly in love with Draco. At some point in the fourth year, she had realised that sticking to him would be beneficial to her, and now she'd heard that he had a special task from the Dark Lord himself, which was only proof of his privileged position. So she didn't mind if the whole school believed that she was an empty headed girl that only knew how to kiss Draco's ass, when in fact, she was one of the most manipulative and powerful people at Hogwarts. Few people knew about the facade, Draco being one of those.
"I told you, I just want to talk," he replied calmly. Draco wanted to strangle him.
.Â He was not able to conjure a mask anymore, and when he looked at Harry in the eye, his gaze was blank, empty. It was not hiding anything, because there was nothing to hide.
"Elaborate, Potter," said Snape.
I want to know that you want this.
"How are you feeling? Do you think you can eat something today?"
"Mr. Malfoy is already standing up. This is a practical exercise, which you would know if you had been paying attention. You cannot do it if you are sitting," he snapped. "Now, move. Your insolence just cost Gryffindor ten points."
"What is this?" he said, talking to himself, trembling almost imperceptibly.
"I doubt it. Malfoy is a dick, but being a Death Eater is serious stuff," said Ron, filling his mouth with like seven spoons of mashed potatoes. "Anyway, what does that have to do with Harry ignoring us?"
"Sure," said Hermione eyeing him suspiciously.
"You kissed me," he accused. "Why would
"But what if it was important?"
"I love nature."
Draco smiled. And he knew for Potter's expression, that it was a twisted and bitter smile.
The amount of rules that it broke, though. It was against all kinds of rights. It was the craziest invasion of privacy. It had to be illegal to have such power. And what if it arrived to the wrong hands? That could be a real tragedy. Potter was so
"Who are you kidding? You were born mad like that, a little shit that has no clue what life is about-"
, it was terrifying. "Do you think it is your job to find a culprit of something that so obviously was nothing but a
"Whatever, Malfoy. It'll never happen again. You're not worth it."
Harry had been holding his shoulders, and he gasped, not exactly surprised, more like relieved. His whole body melting as if it said "
Potter was screaming.
They both went to bed, without another word.
"I'm sick of you! Sick, Malfoy! I will not hear judgemental and moralist preaching from a Death Eater pig like you! And much less let you mention my mother-"
"Oh my sweet dear," Ron interrupted. He looked as if his eyes were going to fall out of their orbits. Hermione was shocked too, mouth completely open. "Oh my fucking and bloody dear. That's- That's disgusting, Harry. Merlin, I cannot. I surely cannot."
"Why? Is it offensive to call you a Death Eater when you are a fucking Death Eater?"
"It surely seems like it," said Pansy, which caused Draco to sneer at her. She breathed tiredly and delicately placed her hands on the face of the boy she'd known since they were little kids with big dreams. She felt a rush of gentleness with that touch, because there was something in Draco's eyes that was scared, and Pansy wanted nothing but to protect him and all his stupid masks, she wanted to keep that proud and cocky little child that cried when his father screamed at him safe from every sort of harm. "You have a task, Draco. And the person that has given you said task will not accept failures or imperfections. You say you want to distract Potter, but he's become a distraction for you too, and you should keep all your focus in whatever it is that you have to do, because I am sure it is not easy."
She had so many questions, but she was in the middle of a class, and that was sacred. Honouring the title of Brightest Witch of Her Age, she cast a silent spell to turn Harry's tie to the colours of Gryffindor. No one noticed. No one, except for Ron, of course, who smiled a bit hysterically and thought "hallelujah!"
"Draco, be quiet and listen to me. I am sure you are able to fool yourself, but you are not fooling me. There is nobody that you like. What you've done with me has been purely because you wanted to test yourself, to try something out scientifically, but, thank goodness, you have zero feelings for me. You have never liked or been attracted to anyone. You've never felt things that made you lose control, even if it was just for a few seconds. There is not a single person that has made you act irrationally or made your heart pump faster. Not a single person except one. And I am sure you can tell me who."
didn't actually want to do it, he was just around. It was because of the plan. But I
"I'm fine, Potter. I'm busy."
There, piles and piles of the weirdest muggle objects, traces of powerful magic and love stories, evidence of hate and past glories, converged without reason. A purely human yet magical dimension, with its dark corners and a brilliant overall.
"I expected you not to be such a gigantic son of a bitch! You can shove your mood swings up your ass, I'm sure you'll love it."
"It'd been a long time since we last did this," whispered Draco, with his head buried in her neck, his words trembling just enough for Pansy to notice.
when Draco made stupid requests that he was obviously not in the right mental state to make. Merlin, how outrageous was that? The
"Ha! And in front of Snape and McGonagall! Blimey, Harry! What did he say?"
Draco really liked fresh orange juice in the morning, so he accepted, and the way Potter smiled while he served him a very big glass was just an extra gain.
It made Harry notice his mouth.
They said goodbye. And Harry could not stop thinking about
Pansy laughed cheekily. The first time they'd talked about their future lives, misters and mistresses, had been almost seven years ago, and it never got old.
"You are the expert of pretending, Malfoy. You are the miserable coward hiding behind that stupid act of yours. But I don't buy it."
. But it is going to be okay. And let it be stated that we absolutely don't care that he is a guy. The most... Well, the most
Okay.
"What do you mean when?" asked Hermione. "So it's happened... More than once?"
Draco turned to Potter slowly, with piercing eyes. Potter had been wanting to provoke? So now he was going to get what he deserved.
He really wanted to puke. He had been wanting to puke all night, unable to think of anything else but the fact that maybe, and only maybe, he was going to kill a man within twenty four hours. He had to do it. If he didn't do it now, he would never do it, and he would be dead before he knew it. It can work, he kept repeating to himself. And if it didn't work, nothing had to go
"That's easy, Malfoy. I can walk away right now."
"No," Malfoy interrupted him sharply, his face showing no trace of emotion. "Just don't come anywhere near my bed." And he disappeared behind the curtains.
Harry understood that he was not helping by being so forcefully on top of him. He slowly moved and sat down close. He helped Draco (Malfoy, Malfoy, this was Malfoy) to sit up as well, and watched as he hugged his own knees desperately. He was not crying, but it was worse. He was desperate. Harry's chest felt raw and wide open and painful. He awkwardly put a hand on his back and stroke him slowly and rhythmically.
Ron watched patiently as Hermione's thoughts travelled as fast as lightning bolts inside her head. He could clearly see all the pieces come together and the understanding of the terrible truth find its place in her scheme of reality. Ron could not avoid the feeling of satisfaction to have found out about it all before her, but he was relieved that Harry had been distracted enough for her to discover it all at last. Besides, he was sure that now that she knew, she would be able to decide what was the best way to act, and the repercussions that needed to be considered.
"It was a weird night, took me some time to fall asleep."
What would have happened if he had stayed? It could not happen again. Never again. Harry needed his brains back. And his body, for that matter. Harry woke up
"Gee, you really are a homophobic jerk."
on it. That Potter would throw himself at the possibility of doing it
"Yes?"
"So there is not an actual plan."
"Potter, wake up," said Draco, as steadily as he could.
But then, he had also read about the Dark Lord. One of the most powerful wizards of all time, who had led an army against Albus Dumbledore, who had infiltrated in the Ministry of Magic with ease, who was said to be immortal. Such a command of dark magic was terrifying, yet fascinating. Draco had always felt fearful respect when reading about Him. The effect was slightly lost due to the fact that a baby had defeated him, though. Plus, Draco had not loved that He had used his power to defend ideas that were logically flawed. Draco had agreed with the fact that pure families were better if an overall comparison ought to be made. They had more magical blood, which likely made them better wizards. But some individuals that came from mixed-blood families were brilliant.
can be used to burn your opponent. Obviously, it is a pretty dark jinx. It increases the body temperature gradually, which weakens and slows down your rival. It is a tricky curse because it can easily go unnoticed, but its effects can be lethal if it is not stopped early enough."
"You know how Harry thinks that Malfoy is up to something, like a dark plan, that he is a Death Eater now... Maybe he has a point?"
"I didn't understand, you were just shouting," he replied neutrally, and continued walking away, putting more and more distance between the two.
and his life was top
was a good conversation opener. His mind could not process further than the wet blond locks dancing around and splattering water droplets all over Malfoy's face.
"You cannot even come up with an alibi!"
"Hostility between students is bad," answered Draco for him, telling them what he knew they wanted. "As the Sorting Hat said, we shouldn't fight each other. The houses are not there to compete, but to collaborate."
"I mean, I always want to sleep here. But today I'm particularly tired, Pans."
Also, racism does not exist in isolation. It is not a coincidence that white people are richer. It is not a coincidence that most research on Medicine or Psychology is done on Western Whites. It is not a coincidence that Black Trans Women have a life expectancy under thirty years old.
of your clothes on, for the sake of magic."
"That's stupid. In order to distract me, I would have to be into him, which I most definitely am not. Besides, I am still watching him, making sure he doesn't act suspicious."
In the end, it was the Slytherin who broke the silence, standing up and looking as if he wanted to run away.
"What Potter means," he told the teachers, "is that I need to shout if I want to wake him up. And I might not always be very gentle, but I'm sure you can understand how annoying it can be to wake up every night to shouting and screaming."
"Were you naked at some point? Did he see you without a shirt?"
"The human mind works in mysterious ways I do not intend to judge, although they never cease to amaze me. And I am sure you will agree with this. Haven't you realised, maybe even felt it on your own skin, that it is usually in such moments when one pushes others away that help is needed the most?"
"What was what?" answered Harry, trying to avoid the unavoidable. He could not think of a way out.
"It's not even eight!" exclaimed Hermione.
"My plan is to monitor them. I already told Draco to ignore Potter, but we both know that that is never going to work. I guess you also told Potter something to keep them apart, which probably won't work either. The thing is, this is already messy, and they don't even understand how it is going to explode in their faces. And they keep acting as if they are alone as if this doesn't concern anybody else. I know Draco far better than I know Potter, but he also strikes to me as someone that doesn't ask for help."
At some point, Malfoy started breathing rhythmically, deeply asleep, so Harry stopped. He closed the book and left it next to the bed delicately. He was exhausted, but he smiled proudly. He'd been able to spend more than five hours on a row without fighting Malfoy. He was starting to realise that it was easy to get along with Malfoy as long as he paid him constant attention and did everything he said. Malfoy was sleeping calmly now, getting the rest he needed to get better, and he looked so peaceful that Harry had no complaints about the past five hours of being bossed around.
"Good enough, I guess."
It took him too long to focus again and to realise that he was without a shirt. With his chest uncovered. With his
"Shut up, Malfoy, or-"
Hermione laughed loudly as if Ron was just being funny.
Tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, ta-
. The plan was simple. Even Crabbe and Goyle would be able to accomplish their parts. All the steps were easy. He did not even have to go to the village. He could stay there, in the Room of Requirements, thinking of an alternative plan if this failed. But it did not have to fail.
"Hm, well, I suppose he is clever. Not like... Not like school smart like Hermione. I mean, you can judge that. He is school smart too. But when he talks and stuff, he is clever."
"WHAT?!!!!"
"What? What are you going to do?" asked Harry mockingly. He was too close to Malfoy's face again. But he was furious. His whole body was shaking in anger, and he saw red. Especially Malfoy's face. Malfoy's face was burning red. Stupid face. He wanted to punch it. Malfoy was doing the mask thing, hiding under what he thought was an unbreakable stone. But Harry was too angry to let those cold grey eyes affect him. He wanted to shatter that stupid mask to pieces.
Harry didn't know what. Ron could not contain the laughter. Hermione was fuming. And Malfoy sat facing the front of the class, as if the situation in the classroom had nothing to do with him, which was true, but Harry could not avoid thinking that, in a normal scenario, Malfoy would have turned his chair to lead the mockery against him.
"You said that he kissed you that first time, but why? Why then?," asked Hermione.
"Yes, because I am so sure you know, oh Hero of our World. People have
"Okay, so the wand movement goes like this." Malfoy elegantly performed a languid bow with his wand. Arrogant little shit. "The pronunciation is as it sounds, and it all must be brought together with a subtle and controlled feeling. You don't want to use this curse when your emotions are all over the place, or it can be explosive and kill your rival instantly."
He opened a bit the curtains of his bed so that he could see the moonlight. He found some consolation in that. Another method he used to avoid spiralling after the nightmares was to hug a pillow. Pretend it was some person that would die to protect him. Which was as pathetic as everything else, of course. He stayed like that for a while, not daring to close his eyes again, catching glimpses of the red bed across the room. If he stayed very quiet, he could hear Potter breathing.
Pansy was just bored.
One of the unavoidable situations in which they were forced to coexist was Snape's class.
"I also want to sleep some more," he replied breezily, as if it was obvious, as if it made sense. Then, he neatly managed to get under the blankets too, and because he was an idiotic, messy fool and his brain totally didn't work, he hugged himself to Draco's back. It wasn't a very bright move, because the idiot hadn't anticipated what the closeness and the position would do to him. Draco felt the hardness too clearly in his lower back, and the (terrible, horrifying) images that flooded his head made him jump in the bed.
again?"
Harry doubted. Of course he would not believe him, right? He knew Malfoy was just playing him, but he found that it was more hurtful than he'd anticipated. Merlin, it was not supposed to be hurtful. He didn't care about Malfoy. Not one bit.
"Bloody hell, Hermione!!!!!"
"I'm not shouting!!!!"
and shit.
Harry realised that taking care of Malfoy probably was not the best way to get him out of his head, but Malfoy was sick, and Harry couldn't just sleep while he was sick. Besides, it should be easy to get over him if he kept watching how he puked everything he swallowed.
"I'm thirsty," he whined dramatically.
"We've kissed a couple of times. And we jerked each other."Â Pansy limited her reaction to two slow blinks. "Happy? What do you care anyways-"
"I don't think so, no," said Draco, ignoring all the protests from his internal organs. "But you can borrow the book if you want."
Neither of them commented on the fact that they still had their bed curtains wide open.
"Beastly behaviour is what you're lacking, Snape. Is that why you are so unhappy?" Potter answered wildly, his eyes fixedly glaring at Draco, disgusted, as if he wanted to spit on him or break his nose again.
"If you are so bothered to pick up my things, you can also remove your shit from my chair," said Potter nonchalantly.
"So?" she snapped.
He had wanted to confront him during the day, as unsuccessfully as it had gone in the morning. Now it was almost midnight, and there he was, on the floor, looking at the fucking door. Waiting for him. Unable to think of anything else.
illness. Then he screamed something impossible to understand again, and Draco's heart skipped a beat. He went to open the curtains, but there was something weird. Normally, when Potter shouted in his sleep, his screams were filled with pain, and they were more like high-pitched, ear-piercing shrieks. Instead, at that moment, Potter's voice sounded deeper. Hoarse. And it was like he was breathing fast and hot and-
frustrated.
Harry blinked as if waking from a dream. He muttered a quick "sorry" and, surprisingly, Snape just nodded. Then, the three friends left in a run.
It made Draco hate his life even more. Because it would be
of what to think, what to say. He just knew that at that moment, Malfoy had full access to his insides. And that it hurt like hell, because Malfoy didn't give a fuck about his insides. And yet, he was able to completely block all his rational thoughts with two sentences. And why the hell did they keep ending up so close to each other?
"Of course not," said Ron reassuringly passing his arm over her shoulders. "We are the best friends he could ever get. Besides, not everyone would be so understanding of his weird kink with the snakes."
"Yeah, sorry. Where is she?" Harry asked, sitting next to him. He could not help but notice that Malfoy was not in the Great Hall.
And he let him go.
"Yes, so what?"
"Why would you help somebody that doesn't want to be helped?"

Malfoy rolled his eyes because he was an insensible prat.
He remembered Potter yelling at him for having abandoned Slytherin's quidditch team, and he smiled. Maybe, if this plan worked, he could go back to playing against him.
He could not move.
"Parkinson. How are you?" she greeted politely.
"No! You don't get it! There is a... A challenge? I guess? He dared me to... Whatever. Thing is he can't win or I-"
"Can you both tell me one thing that you respect about the other?"
He was pathetic. Draco loved how pathetic he sounded.
"Listen, Professor," he said turning to her, "with all due respect, do whatever you want with me. Don't ever lift this stupid detention, my life at Hogwarts has never been easy. But I'm telling you, it won't work."
"How romantic, " joked Ron. "But that sounds fake, mate. Really, Malfoy is disgusting, but people don't just kiss others because they are nearby when they are horny. It's the biggest load of bullshit I've ever heard."
"Shut up!!!!" Ron covered her mouth with his hand once again. "Are you mad? We are not supposed to be in here!"
"And you are sure Potter didn't see it? Maybe he is tricking you-"
The Room of Requirements was one of the most magical places in Hogwarts, which was quite telling already. A room that changed according to the exact needs of the user opened up so many possibilities, and Draco had spent certainly too much time getting to know them. It had been worth every second because he had found that place, that place out of the limits of reality where students and teachers and guests had hidden their secrets, or perhaps just gotten rid of their trash.
in his life, his
"Fuck you, Malfoy."
Hope you liked this xxx please tell me if you hated it or if i managed to write all the heated stuff successfully :///
"What?! When?" and Harry realised the moment he said it, that he'd fucked up. "Shit, NO! That's not what I meant."
"How flattering, but I know about you seeing the chauffeur, darling. Tell me the truth, is he any good?"
"But you cannot just ask a Professor about the
"So how long do you think you can keep this respect thing going on?" she asked.
"You really think you can go and accuse of such
"Are you maybe not telling me something? I am well aware of Mr. Malfoy's... mischievous acts in this school, but you have got yourself quite similar ones on your record, and I would never dare to say those make either of you irredimible."
"You don't have to help him, you know-"
And maybe because he was so tired, maybe because he did not have the energy to shout, it made Potter angrier than usual.
"Ma-Malfoy, I-I'm go-going to k-k-k-kill you," he managed to say, desperately looking around for Snape or Hermione's help. He attempted to hold his wand still enough to hex Malfoy, but failed miserably. Malfoy was smugly smiling at him with the corner of his mouth. The vicious jerk was having fun.
The first night, none of them was able to sleep much.
It did not help to have the Chosen One close while he was trying to keep his family alive. Potter had always behaved in a righteous manner that personally made him sick, but it was worse now that Draco actually had to do something objectively reprehensible. That's why, right before they opened the door of the office where the meeting was taking place, he broke the silence.
. But a part of him rejoiced in the fact that Potter seemed so affected.
Malfoy could not be bothered to answer. He kept eating with enthusiasm, never losing his manners in the way he cut and stabbed and brought the food to his mouth. Harry rolled his eyes, but he carelessly brought some more food closer to him. Malfoy ended up finishing everything, which for some reason felt extremely satisfying for Harry.
Draco stuttered a bit. There was something in Potter's face after having watched him come in his hand that was annoyingly distracting.
Harry put his toothbrush, toothpaste, and soap on the other shelf. He turned on the tap and let the hot water run. He also poured some of Malfoy's aromatic products into the bathtub, because
Ugh, he'd gotten on his nerves with all the staring, he'd made him lose his shit with his dumb challenge. Beg him to stop? You beg me to stop, Malfoy. Harry thought they had gotten over the stupid masks phase. But once again, Draco was hiding behind a hate and a coldness that had to be fake. How dared he hide after having slid his tongue down his throat? Harry knew better than to believe that Malfoy's feelings were inalterable. Malfoy was all emotion and Harry had witnessed it, behind every mask, the gray turmoil at the bottom of his eyes. But hell, he was good at pretending. It was as if the thing that made them go crazy and engage in stupid dares was not there anymore. Merlin, why couldn't he find it? Where had it gone? Maybe he was not close enough, maybe he needed to get closer, wreck the barrier, crush the defences, and.
anything, you disgusting piece of cheap heroic crap-"
Harry wanted to peel his skin off.
He was almost there. That was the first step he'd achieved, and it was an awfully big step. The first step in the right direction. The right direction towards where, though? Draco pushed back the thoughts of what would happen once the Vanishing Cabinet was fixed. That was a time to celebrate. He had accomplished a great magical task, and he should be proud. Then why was he feeling like his lungs had shrank. Why was he feeling as if it wasn't enough.
Harry was becoming an expert at ignoring the voice in his head, especially when the voice came from outside as well.
. Conversations with you can't be very enlightening."
"What do you mean he didn't do it on purpose?"
It took Harry barely five minutes to shower, recover from the utter failure of the confrontation, brush his teeth and clean his glasses, but when he returned to their dorm, Malfoy had already run away.
"Potter! What the hell are you waiting for? Get! Dressed! NOW!" yelled Draco miserably. He had pretended to sound harsh and apathetic, but his voice turned out weak and highly affected, turning the embarrassing quality of the scene up, up, up.
Dumbledore smiled like he always did, as if he knew something Harry did not. As always, it was infuriating.
Draco cried all night. In silence. Potter was right in one thing: he was a pathetic coward. But he just wanted the pain to end.
"Come on, Granger, I thought you were cleverer. He wishes he was manipulating Potter, but he is not even close."
More than scared, he was horrified. Or trauma. Yes, it was probably trauma.
"I mostly don't care about them," he said instead, "but some of them are quite remarkable. Namely, Oscar Wilde." Malfoy opened his eyelids a tiny bit, enough to make Harry even more nervous than he already was. "Are you planning on reading or are you too busy being excessively astounded by my literary preferences?"
"Come on, Potter. Wake up. It's just a dream, just a silly dream."
Harry accelerated his pace distractedly, as if in an unconscious reflex.
"Come on, mate, that's enough. McGonagall will be here soon, or even worse, Snape."
more than ten minutes ago!" he cried for the millionth time, his voice still too weak to be taken seriously.
. They cannot! RON!! PLEASE NO! SORRY! It's me that you want, MY FAULT, LEAVE THEM ALONE!"
"Potter," he repeated. He really didn't want to make it worse. "Could you,
At least he knew how to
"It's four AM, Malfoy. I'm sure you can wait."
"Only? Well, maybe you can afford to spend entire hours in a Professor's office, but my time is more valuable than that."
"Sure, Potter. Your face two minutes ago when you would not leave was definitely lacking interest. But I cannot hold that against you, I am a wonder to look at."
Silence.
"What is ridiculous is how you are not able to get through a simple conversation without messing everything up. You had one job, to close your mouth long enough, but I guess you have a shortage of blood in the brain."
"Malfoy can also move," replied Harry.
"Tonight? What happened tonight?"
"That's cute, Potter," he laughed, adopting a defensive position.
mention it again?
"Well. I guess it is easier to respect each other's boundaries when there is a colour code," Draco replied smugly. McGonagall didn't seem very impressed.
He just needed to sit down for some minutes.
"Goodnight!" said Harry, too enthusiastically.
It took some unmerciful seconds for Harry to unblock, but he eventually moved, reaching for some pants that he put on in a blink, and only then he dared to turn his face towards Malfoy, who was surprisingly still gazing fixedly in his direction.
"I don't know. Malfoy is quite clean," he blurted out nervously. Draco rolled his eyes again, but he could not help but realise that Potter was not particularly dirty. Perhaps a bit messy, especially during the first week, but not as disgusting as he knew some boys their age were. He wondered if Potter had made some effort to keep up with his obsessive cleanliness.
"Swear it."
"Mr Potter. Malfoy," she greeted. "Goodnight, Severus, sorry for the delay. Peeves had cornered three first years in an old classroom." She waited for a beat for Snape to accept the apology with a firm nod. "Let's get started then. Mr Malfoy, please tell us what you have learnt during these past days with Mr Potter.'
"I think, but-"
"Do you want something to eat? You look like you are starving and-"
And if you are not anti-racist, if you are not anti-fascist, fuck you. I don't want you here. Do me a favour and listen, educate yourself, grow up.
After what seemed like ages, they eventually arrived. Potter didn't let him go at the door, though. He brought Draco to his bed and sat him down.
"So what do I do then if he tries to mess with my life again?"
"Harry!!!"
"Not if we wait without doing anything about it!"
He grabbed his wand, and slowly went out of his bed. He could not even look at Potter, because he knew he was going to lose his shit the moment he did. He saw the flooded bathroom, the completely destroyed room, and managed to not pronounce a single word. Moving cautiously, he threw cleaning spells here and there and returned the place to its original state. Only then, he turned to Potter, to discover not only that he had been mockingly observing how he cleaned his mess, but that he was not even dressed.
"You are pretty, Malfoy. Your only redeeming quality is your pretty prince face. All the other parts of you, however, make me sick."
When it so clearly was not his fault.
"Why on Earth would I willingly wear a Slytherin tie?"
After all, he enjoyed hanging around in the Room of Requirements. Irrespective of his mission.
Draco wanted to hex him. Or to strangle him to death. Or both.
He let him eat for a while in silence. Malfoy did not seem to notice his presence, dedicated as he was to the salads.
He hated
"You wish."
"Yeah, right," sneered Draco ironically. "Don't worry, I told you, I've read it a million times. I'll understand even if you whisper."
So what? I am never doing it again. Fuck you.
"And then you decided to stay because?!"
. Rejecting the importance of Quidditch implied rejecting the historical confrontations between their houses, it implied rejecting him as a worthy rival.
"What?" hissed Malfoy.
"Oh, yeah, because Harry normally wears Slytherin ties for the sake of fashion."
"What the fuck, Malfoy? What the fuck are you playing at?"
moment,
The silence was slowly killing him.
"Can't you just shut your mouth?"
And off he went. Draco had nothing left inside his stomach, but he stayed there, half asleep in the toilet, feeling miserable. At least Potter had left him to be miserable alone. He was sure Potter was not going to come back after the scene he'd just seen. Which made it easier to ignore him. And it also sucked.
"What are you saying?"
Malfoy arrived a couple of minutes later. Alone and without the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.
Not that he cared. He was better off without him.
Harry completely tensed up, and Malfoy slightly sat straighter next to him, which was a big sign of nervousness for him.
He didn't know what to do. He didn't know where he was.
it was the same for Malfoy. Why was he
"Yeah, you know, given that our dear friend is not able to communicate the moment he changes dorms."
"Our boys need us."
It was already late when he finally left the Room of Requirements and joined life at Hogwarts again. No one had noticed he was missing.
and not be a coward
"If you don't let me go the next minute-"
"Not this night. Just... Loads to think about."
, but Potter laughed again, and all Draco wanted to do was see him, see the way his eyes lit up when he laughed. Potter was probably not wearing glasses now, and that was a view that Draco had been able to admire ever since he'd seen it once after a Quidditch match back in their third year.
"So, Potter," he kept going, not giving him time to think too much, walking closer to him, his voice as soft as he could conjure it, looking at his mouth, "I understood that you wanted to- get on your knees?"
"It wouldn't surprise me if that's what Dumbledore wants, us to talk to students from other houses."
been nice.Â Enough thinking about Potter. Fucking hell.
"Yes, that's what you said after the first night, but you keep spending unnecessary time in that room."
The room was silent for a while. It was so silent that they could both hear the breathing of the other, which is how they knew that they were both wide awake. And suddenly, it didn't appear as such a genius idea to have the lights off, because Draco still knew that Potter was a few feet away, he could somehow feel Potter's breath under his skin, and the darkness made the tingling in all his cells more intimate and far more undeniable. Something that he just could not ignore.
Ron felt the contents of his stomach going up his oesophagus, but he bravely swallowed it down. Hermione smiled nervously, struggling to keep it cool. She was not going to judge Harry, not without knowing everything first, that part was clear.
"It's hot, right?" asked Potter, and because Draco's eyes were more used to the darkness now, he could distinguish Potter's silhouette, spread in the bed without blankets, looking at the ceiling.
"But I'm sure we can find something that entertains both of us."
nice. And-Â STOP.
Ron was not saying anything. He could not really understand. What.
They stayed in silence for a while, but Harry was still tense. He felt an excess of energy everywhere.Â Maybe he should have left it there. Maybe he should have kept quiet with Malfoy.
He sat in his bed, still half dreamy about how well-rested he felt, and then he saw the book in the nightstand. Not any book, but his top-secret copy of

Draco could not stop himself from grinning a bit, just with the corner of his mouth, but he hid it like a criminal and run back to the privacy of his bed.
"I know that, I do," he managed to say between his clenched teeth, trying to keep a straight face. He did not want to hear it. He wanted to run and hide.
"Let's go, Harry, it's not worth it," pleaded Hermione. However, her friend was similarly too busy trying to explode the blonde's head with his mind to hear her.
Malfoy growled with satisfaction, and they both dived into it without further thought, Katie Bell disappeared in the back of Harry's mess of a brain.
"There hasn't been any actual evolution, don't you think? I don't think we get along better now than when this detention started."
"Of course, of course," the old man agreed, with that peaceful smile of his. "There must be more important problems keeping you occupied. Youth is certainly an overwhelming time."

"Yes, what?"
"I dare you-" he said softly, grabbing his chin and kissing him quickly, "I dare you to make me stop."
As soon as they finished eating, they passed by the Hospital wing to try and get more information on their classmate's health, but madame Pomfrey promptly kicked them out.
Draco finally accepted, but only because Potter grabbed his arm again as if it was completely normal and dragged him across Hogwarts grounds into the Castle. Draco's legs hurt and he couldn't walk properly, so in the end, Potter had to basically carry him.
"Malfoy! Are you awake? Are you done puking? Maybe you can go to bed now. Or shower. Do you feel like a shower? I also brought food, you can eat something if you want. And Madame Pomfrey told me that you need to drink water. Apparently, I was right about the liquids-"
Silence.
"I cannot, because let me remind you that we are grounded for life. Together. And I swear I will go nuts if you keep doing this shit of not sleeping, and not eating. You don't study, you drop Quidditch, you have gotten thinner and paler and I don't know-"
"Stop it, Potter," he muttered weakly. "We are not doing this again."
"Do you know any author in the Wizarding World? Of course you don't, because wizards are shitty writers compared to muggles."
The Dark Mark was perfectly visible in his left forearm.
"You could have told me, I just need a couple of minutes and I'm done, okay?" Then he spelled the lights back on, but Draco had already reached his bed and hid behind the curtains. "Goodnight, eh? Arsehole!"
But Potter came back not long after, with his arms full of food and medicine. He dropped everything in the floor next to Draco. How lovely.
"Of course not!"
"What is? I'm telling you I did not-"
"True. But what about the differences, Harry? How was he different from you?"
"Do you really want to talk about this naked?" insisted the Slytherin, trying as hard as possible to concentrate in Potter's eyes.
Draco heard him showering and painfully destroying some muggle song. He heard when Potter came back to the room and started scandalously opening and closing drawers, how he paced loudly around the room, disgustingly chewing on some crisps. Where had he even gotten those crisps? He then burped shamelessly, and proceeded to practise
, it read. Who could have created something like that. Who even had that kind of magic.
That's why he really wanted to punch him. Not for all the reasons he definitely had just based on what came out of Malfoy's stupid mouth. Not because he just had tricked him into freezing himself, to immediately later throw him across the classroom. No. He wanted to punch him because Malfoy was a coward that only knew how to hide and pretend. He wanted to punch the shit out of him because of the mess that had unravelled in his head since they shared a room. Because he felt that he was going crazy, and because he could not just explain the situation to his friends.
As he cursed to himself, he threw charms and spells everywhere, drying, cleaning, and leaving everything in immaculate conditions.
Silence.
That evening, Harry played the shortest game ever. He caught the snitch in the first two minutes, and then immediately stormed off back to his new dormitory, leaving the Gryffindor team to celebrate on their own. He heard Ron calling, but he would not have been able to explain why he had to leave like that.
"It was you the one that started shouting out of nowhere! You are fucking crazy!"
"We didn't. But we decided to learn how to be civil and have conversations, remember?"
"Maybe my best abilities cannot be shown during conversations. Open your mind, princess."
He pushed up his sleeve and looked at it. The scratches and wounds from the previous nights were still there, but they did not disrupt the deep blackness of the drawing, the serpent and the skull perfectly visible, making fun of him. However, at that moment, it did not hurt. If he did not look at it, he would not know it was there. Except that he always knew.
"She wanted to be early to DADA. She is not getting full marks, and she doesn't want to give Snape more excuses to take it out on her. Man, I hate that piece of shit. I can't put up with him."
"Now you change topics. Nervous, Potter? What's wrong? Am I too close?" Tiredness long forgotten, Draco had no clue what he was saying. But it felt like a rush, and it filled him with energy, so he kept going.
"You know what I mean." And as Draco's stance grew more powerful, Potter doubted and became smaller.
"Stop that, stop looking at me like that, I cannot tell-"
"Of course you know. What is your plan when you discover whatever horrible things you think I am doing? You want to go to your precious Dumbledore? It's crazy, Potter. It's like you'll do
"The Room of Requirements."
"It only happened once!"
was Potter doing still awake? Was that how he chose to spend his nights? Eating like a
"Did you hear my nightmare?" he asked defensively as if he did not care much. The defensiveness lost power with him being all shaken and sweaty.
Eventually, Draco heard the curtains close, and he finally managed to open his eyes. Everything was dark around him.
working out for you two?"
Tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac.
"Well, walls should be there to protect you from the monsters outside. They are supposed to be safe," Draco said.
"Oh, come on! I wish it had been then! Then this wouldn't be such a fucking mess! So answer the question! Why did you kiss him? And don't tell me that it was him that kissed you because I haven't trained you soÂ  much for someone to steal a kiss from you, you ungrateful bastard."
. Red and with a funny-looking, swollen nose. "And stop grabbing my arm as if you could touch me with those dirty paws. As if you were my friend or something."
curse and its counter spell. Explanations and theory have been discussed, now you get to try it," instructed Snape, as he moved to a corner of the room to watch.
Before he fell asleep, he kept repeating that over and over in his head.
"Dammit, Potter," cursed Draco. And he kissed him again. Wildly. And Potter did not have to kiss back, because his mouth was already open for him. Their tongues tangled immediately, and it was messy, and wet, and delicious. Draco was pressing their bodies together, and the friction was. Well, it was magical. Potter passed his arms around his neck and buried his hands in his hair. And it would have been outrageous, to mess up Draco's hair like that, but it felt so good that Draco had to swallow a
Potter's blushed face hiding behind the book, making it painfully obvious that he was not paying attention to the story.
Ron directed a last glaze around the room. The room was perfectly divided in red and green, as he had expected. But there was a garnet jumper next to Malfoy's bed and a Slytherin scarf hung in Harry's clothes rack that diluted the division. Curious. Alarming. What.
"What?! No!" snapped Draco. "I mean, I know that I am mature enough to stand him a week longer, but Potter?! Potter lacks the maturity to even clean after himself-"
"Listen, I don't even know what the curse is for," said Harry, taken aback by Malfoy's wand.
"What the-"
"Brooding and looking through the window? I understand."
"Potter! Shut up. And go get medicines, then."
"Okay, I'm going to put my hand away. Please, be quiet and let's talk like civilised people."
It was still early. Good, that meant no people.
"Yes," answered Draco simply.
"That doesn't make any sense," said Potter dismissively, and kept turning pages noisily. And Draco wanted to burst Potter's head into a million pieces. He felt a crazy amount of energy accumulating in his skin and he was going to explode.
"Oh, come on, you cannot seriously be mad about this," he said with his green eyes shining with tears of laughter.
"Really? Are you having nightmares again?"
. His head was spinning so hard. And then Potter put his hands under his shirt, and he was really
He was falling asleep in his day clothes and wide open curtains, when Potter arrived.
"Merlin, Morgana and fucking Lucifer," she muttered. "You've slept with Potter."
"Shut up. Shut up," shrieked Draco, panicking. "You cannot even begin to understand. Fuck you, Potter. Don't you ever spy on me again. If I want to walk around the castle in the middle of the night, I won't stop because you, sick bastard, tell me so.
not wanking until Malfoy disappears from my head. I am not.
Harry felt some kind of disarray in his insides and he simply could not understand.
"We need to talk," replied the Slytherin, dragging her into an empty room.
"What do you mean you don't know? You saw the tie! You saw it and didn't say a thing!"
"And you are foolish! I thought you at least had a brain, Granger! But you are just putting people in danger because your friend Potter passed on to you his saviour complex."
They were not that far away, so Malfoy had no time to run when Harry knocked him down with his own body. Which was a stupid move, because Malfoy still had his wand, that he used to make him fly to the other side of the room.
"You should apologise first, Potter. Watch that beastly behaviour of yours."
"I also think so, but it's your turn to make him listen, because he doesn't want to hear me. To be honest, I'm more afraid that he is going to collapse before he tells us than it being all a wicked plan of Malfoy."
No, he was not going to have a mental breakdown again. He did not have the time for another one. He breathed in deeply, ignoring his heated-up face, flustered with shame.
"Come on, Malfoy. It's Sunday. Voldemort does not give you Sundays free?"
Dobby disappeared. He kept waiting. And looking and the salads. And then at the door. And back and the salads.
"Did you, you selfish son of a bitch?!"
"I swear to all of the Greatest Wizards, if you don't be quiet, I will tell McGonagall that you wish to drop her subject!"
"He sucks at pretending, so I am quite sure yes. To be honest, he sucks at everything so-"
Harry tried to arrange the thoughts in his head before speaking.
Potter sounded nervous, frightened, but Draco didn't know what to say to make it better because it was the same thing he felt when he took the potions for the nightmares. He understood what it was like, but he didn't think it was his place to tell him.
When they woke up again on Sunday morning, the room was a mess. Harry's stuff was all over the green side, and vice versa. It was almost hard to tell which part was supposed to be which, until the boys came out of bed at the same time.
"So I should just stop trying to fight him? He
. The only sign that they had been used was a single blond hair that had rebelliously stuck to his razor. Harry also saw some used towels still drying on top of the radiator, and a reminiscence of Malfoy's scent floating in the air.
"He is in denial, 'Mione. He is never going to admit it."
to protect your Good Guy image, even this sick level of espionage. Who knows what else your fucked up mind is up to."
"The dick didn't even invite us over. Do you think it's part of the punishment?"
"Understood, Potter. I am going to explain it, but Snape will notice if we don't pretend we are trying."
"He still hurt her," she said firmly, but the look on Harry's face was too terrible for her not to try and comfort him. "He still hurt her and that is not something that we should forget about. But if you are so convinced that he didn't want to, then why do you think he did it? Did they force him to? Was it a mistake? How far will he go if we don't stop him?"
"Shut up! Don't change topics! Stop acting as if your actions had no consequences! Why the fuck were you staring at me so much anyways?"
Draco snorted because he didn't know what else to do. "Not my fault that you don't know how to perform a simple task in an efficient way."
to protect her miserable excuse of a son..."
"Potter cares," Draco cut him before he ruined everything. "Not about me, of course. But he cares a lot about his friends."
Malfoy was a gigantic dickhead, and yet it was Harry the one sitting at McGonagall's office.
They all missed Charms that day, but Hermione was too busy solving everybody's problems to care.
"You are Harry Potter. If you are sure he is a Death Eater, as distressing as he finds that, it's obvious that he won't go to you for help."
At least, Harry was the only one sensitive enough to notice Malfoy's stare.
his help and assistance. And Harry could not deny him that. He would do it for anyone, really.
"So you didn't like it?" he asked trying to show how much he did not care about the answer. Draco hated that he was so bad at pretending.
"If you want to believe that," laughed Potter obnoxiously. "Truth is I just need to
"But you are reading it now."
"Is that a challenge?"
Harry had never heard Malfoy's voice in such a high pitch, but he had zero doubts that the shriek had been cast in his throat, just like he was sure that he had been paralyzed and that his professed rival had, at the moment, full visual access to his arse.
And then it ended. Too fast. To little. Draco felt his lips tingling furiously. Potter's lips were slightly parted, and his eyes were wide open. He was gorgeous, and Draco wanted to kiss him again. But his brain was starting to work again, so he fought all the cells in his body and backed down.
There were so many things that made Draco furious about that statement that when he opened his mouth to insult him, nothing came out. For too many seconds, he stayed pathetically and angrily open-mouthed, which of course, Potter found hilarious.
"Think about it, Parkinson."
"I just told you I'm a bit more experienced now."
Also, Black Lives Still Matter, so let's keep donating, listening, protesting, using our voices!!
"You did what?" she hissed, and it was not a joke anymore. "What's your game, Granger?"
"What the hell are you saying?! There's been no kiss with Malfoy! He is a guy, for fuck's sake! I would have told you if I suddenly liked guys!"
"If it is me the one to stop you, you win," he said simply, and Potter swallowed.Â "Scared, Potter?"
"Don't worry. I think I just need to sleep."
Draco's dick pulsated furiously. Potter was still grabbing his arm and he moved his thumb as he spoke, stroking him. Just a bit. It would have gone unnoticed if Draco had not been extremely conscious of the point where their bodies touched. His pyjama shirt had long sleeves, but Potter's grasp burned, and that movement with his thumb. It had to be illegal. Draco was one second away of exploding into a million pieces.
"Well, Potter. I hope you are happy. We will have to keep the
things that were not believable from what he was saying, namely the fact that the conversation that they were having before the kiss was absolutely nothing to get horny about, but he trusted that Potter was too disoriented to realise.
Harry waited. And waited. And waited.
we were talking about. Dumbledore would not fall for such an obvious trick. But what if it worked? What if he was able to get his father out of prison? What if he could turn the situation to his advantage again?
And suddenly it was not a joke. Harry no longer found it funny.
"Why do you want me to deny it, Potter? Would you believe me if I did?"
Potter. Or Potter had shagged him. Either way. He'd definitely shagged
"How dare you-"
"You tell me. I don't know how you lions reason. Probably you don't."
"Of course not! Anyway, I had always suspected that Harry was bisexual."
Professor and student were waiting for Snape to set the punishment, but Snape would not arrive, so McGonagall told Harry not to move and went off to look for the Head of Slytherin.
"Malfoy! What the fuck are you doing here?"
Silently, Ron and Hermione wished him goodnight and off they went to the Gryffindor tower. Harry was left with his dark thoughts.
The insults came out naturally, but it felt weird to hear them after their unspoken truce. Draco ignored the discomfort that sat in his shoulders and hardened his posture. He pushed the door.
"So do me a favour and give it a thought next time you open your big mouth. Because you can call me anything, Potter, but not selfish. I am not doing this for me."
Across the Hall, which was crowded with students having breakfast (really, there were probably other stories between other people worth mentioning), Draco hated toasted bread. Most remarkably, he hated people who had toast for breakfast. The flavour was just boring, a terrible way of waking up, such an unbearable dry texture. Who would choose toast over pancakes or bread rolls or even cereal? Well, Potter of course. There he was, munching his stupid toast and looking at it as if it was the most interesting thing he'd ever seen. He'd been eating it for like ten minutes, no honey or jam, just plain bread. Stupid Potter, only he could be so dull, and basic, and bland. The worse part is that he didn't seem to be enjoying it, with his neck all tense and taking ages to swallow every bite. Merlin, it was painful to watch.
"Since when?" he shouted back, in the midst of the running water of the shower.
"Potter," growled Snape, "that's fifty points from Gryffindor, and three months detention due to beastly behaviour in front of the school staff."
Pansy felt pain in his voice, and she felt the urge to protect him stronger than ever. Fuck Snape and McGonagall for messing with them like that. And fuck Potter for being a pain in the ass.
your shit. So please, help me. Because I really really don't get you. Because you
Potter was the most ridiculous and absurd and preposterous person Draco had ever met, and yet he couldn't avoid but to smile when he disappeared in the bathroom.
It had been too easy, instead of the rush of adrenaline he had been hoping for the entire week. And yet, when he burst the door open, he did not really know what to tell him. Fucking Malfoy was just sitting in a fucking
Draco had glared at her, and she'd had the audacity to smile knowingly and encourage him to continue like that. Draco detested her.
Harry had figured out that, the moment Ron and Hermione asked, he would reply with a laugh and an obvious and ridiculing "what do you mean Malfoy and I?". That very morning, he'd practised the whole thing in front of the mirror for about thirty times in order to be as convincing as possible.
"Anything! But not this! This is completely crazy! There must be another explanation!"
"Whatever you think is best, but be careful. We don't want the whole school knowing about this, and the Weasel seems far more slow and clumsy than you. "
"What's wrong? Do I have something on my face?" he had the
He needed to get out of there. Far away from the dead bird.
Silence.
"Maybe it saves him!"
"What do you mean why? It's you! You would never hook up with anyone in this school. They are all beneath you, you've said it a million times. For Morgana's sake, you get annoyed if they touch you, let alone fuck you."
"You have no clue what you are talking about, Potter. No idea," he cursed.
Draco felt his face heating up. Potter had caught up in the lying strategy and was using it himself. The imbecile was so evident, so obvious in his lies. But Draco had not expected him to be so fast.
"What the hell is wrong with you?" snarled Malfoy, going red. Not again. When Malfoy was red, it messed with Harry's already fragile brain. Something he'd discovered recently but somehow was already a confirmed fact.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," she mumbled against his hand. "It's just that it's impossible. Malfoy and Harry? In what universe?"
"Hallelujah."
"Good morning, Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Potter," greeted them McGonagall.
"Yes. You may go now."
"I told you already. It sucks," said Harry mindlessly. He was focused on the food, and remotely considering where Malfoy might be if not in the Great Hall, where he was supposed to.
Merlin, it had been embarrassing. Nothing like the honourable and elegant Quidditch he loved.
"I did not-"
"I don't want to prove anything," Draco said instead. "I don't need to prove anything, and specially not to you. But you are totally obsessed with me, which you keep denying, and it is embarrassing, to be honest. Did you realise that you call me prince? Like who does that?"
"Yes, Professor. All is good."
Malfoy was breathing softly, but he still wasn't asleep, so after a tense silence, Harry dared to call him in a whisper.
(i hope this works a christmas present from me to you <3)
"What? What the hell do you have to do that leaves no room to put your ass on a broom and show off your new equipment? Fuck, Malfoy, you love all of that. You love Quidditch. What the hell can be so important that it makes you forget the thrill of flying?"
Where the fuck was Malfoy? He hated that he was waiting for him, but he was. To be fair, there was nothing else to do. That night he was not going to even be able to sleep, so there really was nothing else he could do. He thought of going to the kitchens. Grab something to eat. That implied leaving the warmth of his bed.
"He sucks, I guess that's what I'm trying to say. He really really sucks. And I don't get it. Merlin, I will never get it." Harry did not want to ask. He didn't want to know what Ron was so accurately pointing out. But Ron kept talking. "But I've been thinking about... Well, about this detention, and about... Whatever. I've been thinking, okay? And I'm still here for you if you
"SHUT UP! You don't know shit! You've just been lucky. You don't understand what you are up against."
"You want to kiss him

intended any second meaning when he said that. It had been his mouth doing its own thing. It hadn't been him, he would never. He had never intended or planned or consciously decided- But these results? Brilliant.
hope you like it tho xxxxxxxxxx
Draco felt his face contorted in hate, the mask long broken. But he was not going to break in front of Potter again.
He decided to be petty about it, and stretched his time in bed, not wanting to face Malfoy too early in the morning. He shouldn't have worried about it.
What on earth was that question? As if Potter had ever cared about what he minded or stopped minding.
"If my team was competent, I would win with closed eyes. Besides, the self-esteem crisis you would have if I ever won? It would destroy you, and all the Wizarding World. Imagine, if I ever ended their hero, they would send me to Azkaban in the blink of an eye."
"Okay," nodded Hermione. "Are you okay?"
"Don't you dare talk to me, you despicable mudb-"
of the situation.
"Dobby can figure it out, sir. And bring him with Harry Potter, if Harry Potter wants."
"No!" shouted Potter anyway, his eyes shining angrily. "But anything is better than the new Slytherin seeker. It's embarrassing, so embarrassing. Maybe you can go back just for the sake of your house's dignity."
"No! Well, you know, he is so obvious. He barely sleeps. And you must have noticed how he also misses class. Also, this morning, he left before me but he is not here now. Where did he go? It's kind of worrying, no?"

Good that he had left on time.

of some detention! That shouldn't be allowed. What's next? Having tea with Snape?" he exclaimed indignantly.
"No way. Didn't you hear what I said? You have to be able to control your emotions. You don't know how to that."
Avoidance was a great dealing strategy, in Harry's humble opinion.
on purpose.
"Don't go there, Malfoy. You don't know shit, but you keep pushing and pushing, and I swear to Merlin, you will get burned."
on ignoring Potter, that his head was most distracted by his awful face and incomprehensible actions.
Potter laughed, tilting his head, too satisfied about how well his stupid strategy to attract his attention had worked. The big headed, self-centred, disgraceful idiot. With his stupid little towel hanging from his stupid waist.
Pansy knew she didn't have to ask about the Death Eater thing, but if Draco kept talking with that mouth of his, she was likely to find out about everything anyways. She did not completely ignore the topic, though.
"Doyouwannasleeptogether?"
Potter conjured some music and the water in the tub started running. For a moment, the Slytherin's face contorted like a broken record, but he quickly recovered his mask of neutrality and focused on the essay for Snape.
"Exactly, and Harry is the Chosen One. The Chosen One to kill Voldemort, who is Malfoy's boss if we are right. That means that Harry is the worst enemy for Voldemort and all of his Death Eaters, and that makes him a target. But if Malfoy and Harry are somehow involved, sexually or emotionally, that puts Harry in an even more vulnerable position."
"I see. Well, I'm sorry I can't keep up with the philosophical matters that concern you more than your health, prince."
Malfoy didn't answer immediately.
He was just feeling lonely. This room was smaller and so fucking quiet, and probably had not been used in ages, and the shadows looked different. It reminded him of the first time the Dursleys made him sleep in the cupboard under the stairs. A shiver ran down his spine. Hogwarts was not a place to remember the Dursleys. Hogwarts was home, Hogwarts was safe. He repeated that inside his head a couple of times.
"You are definitely behind, my dear," she proclaimed proudly. "Four supposedly straight Slytherin girls have already fallen in my paws. You men are like constant disappointment. It's not even challenging anymore."
Potter was crying. He could not see him, but he knew. The words came out strangled, suffocated by hollers and bitterness. It made something in Draco's chest hurt like hell, something that had not yet been hurt.
Draco wanted Potter to kiss him. He wanted it because it was a necessary and efficient way to distract him from his dark activities. It was all part of the plan. Feed Potter's obsession with kisses and touches. Have sex with Potter while he planned an attack against Dumbledore and against Hogwarts. Keep the Chosen One close so that he would not see him coming. That morning, he thought that it was like prostituting himself, but it honestly was not as bad as the Dark Lord's tasks.
"Isn't it? Think about it. Mr. Malfoy has always been praised precisely for the opposite of what you have. It is natural that you and him feel differently on plenty of matters. But do you believe he needs you to tell him what an awful person he is? If you care about this issue, are you certain that is the best way to approach it?"
Naturally, everyone knew. The Great Hall was buzzing with rumours and theories on the matter. It had happened in Hogsmeade, they said. Katie Bell, the Chaser of Gryffindor. Who could have? She is such a great girl. Yeah, who could have? Some talked about an angry ex, others about Death Eaters. Some came close to reality, they mentioned something about a hexed object Katie had accidentally touched, whereas others insisted that it was just a butterbeer intoxication.
"Close how?"
Ron and Hermione exchanged an amused look.
"Harry! Stop. You are panicking," said Hermione. "Listen to me, okay? How many times have you kissed?"
"Oh, come on, Malfoy. And you think that reaction is mature? It's unbelievable how you manage to stick your head so up your ass that you lose sight of how ridiculous you look."
And then Harry heard him going to the bathroom, and he jumped out of bed, waiting next to the door.
"Whatever. Just go."
"Ron!! What are you doing?! You'll break him!!" cried Hermione, and Ron barked a laugh.
Harry's body was suddenly flooded with anger. For a moment, he had forgotten that Draco Malfoy was not someone to joke around with, but his declared enemy. Not a roommate, and by no means a friend. Something flipped in his stomach, making him want to puke all the food he had just eaten.
Malfoy had just entered the Great Hall. He was alone, but he walked as proudly as ever. He briefly locked eyes with Harry, and smiled mockingly. As he walked to the Slytherin table, Harry directed his attention back to Ron and Hermione, rolling his eyes, a corner of his lips twitching. Ron and Hermione obviously noticed the obnoxious exchange, but while Hermione misinterpreted it as further testosterone emissions, Ron saw something else, something that made his stomach unsettle.
"Sirius! SIRIUS! NO! No! Please! Please don't be dead, please don't leave me alone. Fuck, no! NO!"
"But I don't. I don't care. You cannot help someone that doesn't want help. Besides, I have other things to think about."
"What's the meaning of this disaster, Potter?!" he asked, his voice trembling in a weird mixture of emotions, among which he wanted to underline the anger. "I thought we'd agreed on cleaning everything after every use.
Harry did not answer. The past two days had reminded him how much he hated Malfoy. And yet, the fights and the shouting across Hogwarts in the past had never made him feel empty. Malfoy's snobbish attitude and his stupid insults had never affected him as to actually feel bad. Now they did. Their confrontations used to be pure heat and rage. Now they felt fake. Harry no longer wanted to punch him because of his words, or because of his superiority complex, because he did not buy that anymore. He was not able to believe that Malfoy was genuine about it, but that it was all part of the dumb little act he pulled to hide, whatever his reason for hiding was.
"How are you dealing with ignoring Potter?"
"No, Malfoy. I know it was you," he said disgustedly. "You didn't go to Hogsmeade, so you sent someone? Pansy? So that she could enter the girls bathroom? You really are so miserable that you have to pass on your shit just to have an alibi?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Goodness, Malfoy! Are you okay?" asked Hermione genuinely.
Bless you all and thanks for reading!
"Potter!"
of food. So he sat on the floor, eyes on the door and all the lights on, and he started eating from here and there. Dobby stayed for a couple of minutes, but then he left, saying something about the rights and duties of being a free elf.
Potter had walked all the way to him, and now Draco was trapped between his arms, his back against the wall. He did not want to run away. In fact, he wanted Potter to kiss him until they were both dead.
"Okay, whatever you say, but hear me out. I don't know what the hell it is that makes you so drawn to him, but it has to stop. You are a Death Eater, a literal follower of the person that wants Harry Potter a hundred metres underground, do you understand? And that bullshit of "just sex" that you think is so clever can get real messy in no time. Especially with Potter."
Dumbledore looked at him with a piercing clear gaze, almost mockingly.
"Look, I don't love it either, but it all fits. You said it yourself, Harry's been acting super weirdly this past days, and Malfoy too. You remember in the beginning when they stopped shouting, and then how they were back at it, always at the same time?"
Draco felt the hot water of the tea soaking his beautiful white shirt, ruining it. It hurt like hell, but not as much as the embarrassment. Everyone in the Great Hall was looking at him and Draco wanted to scream. The cup he'd been holding had crushed into a million pieces in his hand, and there were small red cuts all over his palm and fingers. He vaguely noticed some fellow Slytherin cleaning up his mess, but his eyes were locked with Potter's, who had turned at last, taunting him.
Harry felt cornered. He wanted to run and scream until his fucking lungs obliterated.
Harry jumped in his seat. He was suddenly very conscious of McGonagall's tone, Hermione's killing look, Ron's laugh, and, worse of all, Malfoy's sneer. Harry did not enjoy being able to know Malfoy's face expressions without seeing his face, but that's how life was now, apparently.
And then the door of their room opened, and a girl with messy hair and a tall redhead boy entered the room.
"Malfoy?"
"It's not."
Draco smiled, looking at the ceiling. He was not tired at all, but going to bed early was better than enduring the unsettling interactions he kept having with Potter. He could still hear him, though, and he was not able to figure out what the hell he was doing. It didn't smell like food, so maybe it was homework. Draco was just slightly curious about what it was, the healthy kind of curiosity that occupied a healthy amount of space in his head.
Potter did not immediately leave, and Draco could feel his presence, standing next to the bed. More than ever, he wanted to open his eyes and check if Potter was looking at him, he wanted to see what expression he had after taking care of him and putting him to bed.
. We can talk. We should learn anyways, as we will have to stand each other for a while longer."
"Good job, genius. You are in our new shared room, remember?"
"I don't need you to like me, Potter. I'm just pointing out how hypocrite of you it is to deny that you obviously want to come closer."
. And for what? What did you discover with your pretty map, Potter?"
Harry tried to be serious. He had the decency to feel slightly embarrassed about his mouth's doings.
"What do you want from me?" he whispered, almost begged. Draco felt Potter's breath in his own face, and something in his low stomach throbbed.
- no, he was
Harry didn't know what was up with his friends, but he knew something was, so he did his best to avoid uncomfortable conversations. He was sure it was about Malfoy and he had no clue of what would he say if they asked. During the classes, he pretended to be very invested in the topics the teachers discussed, contrary to what he had been doing at McGonagall's. And during the breaks, he ranted about everything and nothing: Quidditch, exams, the second hand Potions textbook he'd been using. Ron and Hermione had not found a moment to talk in private and put their knowledge in common, so they did not stop him. After all, Harry was talking eleven times more than what he had been doing in the past weeks.
. Harry was
"What are you thinking about?" asked Hermione for the eleventh time that day.

Their bodies fitted perfectly in the dark, curled against each other, merged in a mess of arms and legs, green silk and red cotton. And they breathed in unison. Calm and warm.
Racism in Europe works differently than in the US, but it is as sickening and as real. In the Netherlands, blackface is a respected tradition. In Spain or in Italy, the police is very keen to go after people on the basis of the colour of their skin. In the UK, Boris Johnson says the same xenophobic and racist shit as Trump. European political parties say racist shit every other day, and they are not held accountable.
"I do, you jerk! I do give a fuck, that's what I'm trying to tell you. So just accept it and shut up already!"
"Why do you think McGonagall wants to lift the detention already next Sunday?"
Apparently, the room was loyal to them because, although they had not been there in a long time, it all seemed exactly as cosy as they had left it. Once there, Draco closed the door and enchanted it so that no one could enter, and he fell on the nest of blankets and pillows, pulling Pansy with him. She ended up on top of him, with their faces close together.
Harry glared back. But he sat down again.
Draco entered the room in silence. He closed the door carefully and breathed in. He had to make it to bed without talking to Potter. Specially not about Katie Bell. Then he noticed a lot of Potter's red garbage on his precious green side of the room. They were mostly clothes, probably infected with whatever Draco now had twitching and clenching his stomach. He did not hide his disgusted expression while he picked everything and dropped it next to the red bed, close to where Potter was sitting. He quickly freed his section of the room from any Gryffindor pollutants and started to change to his pyjamas.
"Not like that. Not worried
a hand job. Me. That I have screwed you every single year at Hogwarts, that I have insulted Granger and the entire Weasley family more than I can count. I have never given you a reason to believe that I am nothing but an arsehole. And yet, you made me squirm out of pleasure. You came in my hand. Geez, we fell asleep after wanking. Together. And deny it all you want, you'd do it again. And no, Potter, I did not magically change overnight. I'm still a terrible person. I still think you are overrated.
And Harry had attended his every need. For five long hours. Which should be enough to fully forget about any kind of attraction he had maybe felt for Malfoy in a moment of weakness. Because that was why he kept assisting Malfoy's every need, not because he gave a single shit about him, but because he wanted to reach a level of annoyance and disgust that would make him hate Malfoy with all the strength of the good old times.
Black Trans Lives, Black Queer Lives, Black Disabled Lives, Black Women Lives have ALWAYS mattered.
Draco sighed, "yes."
He was above all those people, specially Potter. He squared his shoulders bravely, and he stood up as a proud Malfoy, a true aristocrat. He sent murderous glares that killed the laughter before it could start, and he silently claimed the dignity that his stained shirt had damaged. It was all going magnificently, Draco was gloating in how well he was dealing with the situation, but then Potter had to open his big mouth.
"Sorry, I-" he said, but his legs were still blocked.
Potter opened his eyes, in shock. He looked horrified.
"Right. And I'm supposed to ignore the fact that Malfoy is manipulating Harry."
"Someone with an awful taste, that's for sure."
"Yes, yes, I know. I am still adapting to this situation. So what did she say?"
As soon as Malfoy came out.
He clearly wanted him to lose it. He was asking for a fight. He was basically begging for it. But Draco was too
What. The. Hell.
"Don't mind him, he won't be here anyway." Fuck you, Malfoy.
"I understand. And I hope you understand that I couldn't care less whether you hate me or not, because I don't care about you. Not about your pitiful looks. Not about you being or not a Death Eater. Do whatever you think is right. I just hope that, if you are actually working for Voldemort, you know that he will not be bothered if you die. He does not give a single shit about you. He probably doesn't even know your name, Malfoy."
"Morning," he greeted Ron with a not very subtle lack of enthusiasm.
"Draco!" called Professor Snape loudly, his voice echoing in the Great Hall. He walked peacefully towards them, as if nothing odd was happening, as if the fighting and the circle of spectators were an everyday thing at Hogwarts (when it came to Malfoy and Potter, they actually were). However, his favourite student did not answer or react to the call, as he was too busy releasing testosterone against Weasley and superiority against Granger. Draco was also too blocked by Potter's body to move.
"I just can't believe it. He is worse than a
"Yeah, right. Not happening until you teach me how to counter it," said Harry between his teeth.
"Right. Goodnight, Harry." ButÂ  before he could exit the room at last, he heard "And deliver my greetings to Draco, will you?"
Not surprisingly, Harry was paying absolutely zero attention to the class, so he was sure he had heard wrong.Â But then everyone around him started moving, changing spots and walking towards their assigned partner for the exercise. Harry shook his head, trying to wake up, and he discovered Malfoy staring furiously at him.Â Unbelievable.
"What now?"
to be noisy. Wait- Potter was screaming.
"Do you think Harry knows how that ferret is eating him alive with the eyes?" muttered Ron into Hermione's ear, keeping his tone forcefully neutral.
"Yes? That's it? No further hurtful comment? How disappointing."
Potter returned to his bed, and the silence came back, only to be interrupted from time to time by the sound of a turning page. Draco reckoned that Potter couldn't possibly be reading that fast, but at the same time, why on Earth would he want to pretend that he was reading. Of course, Potter had weird reasoning pathways, and maybe it was one of his strategies to be the centre of attention. Maybe, and this was not the first time that Draco considered it, Potter was not actually interested in being everyone's centre of attention, just his, and it was all part of a wicked and vicious master plan to destroy Draco's last remains of sanity.
"Hah, funny. Now I'm a bit more experienced, mind you."
"Yes, yes, I was just thinking that I hate Malfoy," he sighed.
"It isn't," muttered Draco, lost in something beyond Pansy's face. He recovered quickly, though. "But I can do it, I don't need help-"
No one had to know, and definitely not Malfoy, that Harry didn't need to look at him to know where he was standing. Or that he felt horrible chills when he stood within his grasp. Or that he carried the Marauder's Map everywhere, and he checked it more often than ever, maybe to compensate for the avoidance. Or that he hated how noticeable was Malfoy's mask for him now, and how obvious it was now that it was antinatural and fake. Malfoy had basically cried in his arms, for fuck's sake. Did he have to apologise if now he could not buy the indifferent play anymore? No, he didn't, thank you very much.
"I'm waiting for when His Majesty decides it's the time to go back."
"What do you exactly mean by "distract"?" asked Harry nervously.
, warned Malfoy's voice in his head.
"I'm not
"Again? Yes, and you kept going, Potter. I didn't force you to kiss me back."
"How was your night, Harry?" asked Hermione.
"They also don't work for me. Hermione gave me some once, but it made it worse. The nightmares were still there and I knew what they were about, but they were blurry and far more terrifying."
Harry anticipated his intentions and managed to stop him, grabbing his arm.
Harry was right, and Malfoy readily removed the leg that he had used to unsuccessfully try to keep balance when they were falling.Â Harry did not move, though.
"So you are a slut."
But it was so

? He had far more important issues to think about, like the abhorrent task he had to carry out. Which he could not do with Harry freaking Potter two meters away. Not only due to his revoltingly
Draco could barely keep track of what Potter was saying. He was so tired, his eyelids were too heavy to keep them open.
And it was then that Harry realised that Malfoy had never answered, he had never fought the accusations, and he had definitely not vowed a thing. No, Malfoy had kissed him, which sounded exactly like what Hermione had suggested. Like a distraction.
"I'm not going to take anything off," he replied sharply, sitting up. "Get out of my bed."

They had just watched the memory of when the Professor first met young Tom Riddle, but Harry's head was far away, focused on a different Slytherin.
people, Malfoy. Innocent people. How can you-?"
"Hermione thinks you might have a point," he admitted. Then he proceeded to fill his mouth with food again.
How on Earth was he supposed to do that, Pansy?
"Oh, you are the one messing with others. I get it, though. Who wouldn't want this?" Potter was grinning wildly, full of himself. Glowing as if he believed it. "It's just that it is a bit embarrassing that you, precisely you, Malfoy, that you have dedicated all your life at Hogwarts to make mine insufferable, are the one that ends up
