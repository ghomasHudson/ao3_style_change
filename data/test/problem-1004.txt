"I need to talk to you, alone."
"You'll be happy to know that under me, Slytherin will be playing fairly this year, none of those dirty tactics that spoil it for everyone," said Vaisey. Harry couldn't immediately think of a repy to that. He was surprised, of course. Where had this kid been hiding for the past few years?
Harry sipped his goblet of Pumpkin juice while Ginny recounted a joke a Hufflepuff friend of hers told while they were in Hogsmeade the other day.
The Great Hall was even worse. As he made his way to were Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were sitting it felt like the eyes of the entire school were on him.
"I know. We've got potions next, I'm sure Malfoy won't mind me leaving the potion to him, lest I ruin it," Harry tried to lighten the conversation with humour. Ron didn't seem impressed.
"Draco, you don't seem to understand! We... you know. Where do we go from here? Do we act like it never happened? And if we didn't, how does this work?"
"I don't know," Harry mumbled.
"It's okay," Harry placed a hand on his arm.
Draco sat by the end of Harry's bed and waved his wand silently and flicked it so a small light appeared.
"Let's go! Team huddle!" George announced.
"You don't know that, Potter. You don't know me."
"I don't know," said Harry. He looked down at his lap. He did know, a little. Malfoy would be here all alone, not wanting to return to his manor home where he would be stripped of his wand and forced to sit around all day with no contact to the outside world. Those were the terms of his house arrest. He knew Malfoy would not cope with being alone, as much as he didn't want to admit. Harry had a feeling that what Draco had told him was just the tip of the iceberg. He wasn't sure when he decided to care so much for Malfoy, the boy who decided it was his job to make Harry's life miserable since they were eleven. Harry decided not to think too much into it.
"A broken radius and a dislocated shoulder. Fixed in a jiffy. But what I'm more concerned about is how you fell, Mr Potter," the nurse eyed him over a clipboard. Harry opened his mouth to reply but she gestured with her hand to silently tell him not to. "Fatigue, dizziness, loss of body mass. I've been a nurse long enough to know the symptoms of under-eating." She said accusingly.
"McGonagall? Yeah, she made it clear she'd have you keeping an eye on me," Harry grimaced.
"Oh, don't you worry, I'm just getting started. Depulso!" He smirked. Malfoy lowered himself before kicking off the ground to build what little speed he could muster on the school supply broom. He raced to meet the ball.
"Everything is still a little blurry," he murmured and he began re-buttoning his shirt. Harry sat down in the visitor's chair by his bed and tried to give the boy some privacy as he tried to redo his buttons. Harry couldn't help glancing up at the exact moment the entire shirt was apart, revealing Malfoy's pale chest. He frowned at the large scar running down it.
"Yeah, I get it," Harry looked down at the half-finished letter in front of him. "He's been having a hard time."
He got up slowly, tearing open the top of the box and popping a toad in his mouth. He stepped up onto and over the sofa toward the portrait hole, chewing on the mint chocolate sweet.
"What
"What is happening between you two?" Ginny asked as she sat down on a desk, her feet swinging just above the wooden floor.
"Like a date?" Asked Hermione excitedly, still making sure to keep her voice low.
The last four hours may have felt like they passed so quickly but the memory kept playing in his brain. Lying with Draco on his bed, talking about the stupid things that they did to anger or investigate the other during their previous school years, interrupted every so often by gentle kisses. Draco was not very impressed by Harry and Ron's polyjuice escapades during their second year.
"We have!" Harry assured her. "Briefly. We may have gotten... distracted."
Harry pressed his glasses onto his face and pulled a fluffy robe around him as he tip-toed past the beds of sleeping boys toward the door.
Harry could not remember when exactly they had made this 'pact'. Harry assumed he was joking, or rather hoped.
When Harry decided to get ready for the trip to the station, Ron had begrudgingly wandered off to annoy George or Ginny. This was of course before he was roped into cleaning by his mother in which he seriously reconsidered his priorities, but it was too late.
Harry stared up at the wooden ceiling of his best friend's bedroom at the Burrow. The sun was just beginning to peek through the windows of the Weasley's family home but Harry hadn't slept.
"It has been thirteen hours since you last saw him." The tone of judgement in his voice was unmistakable.
As he opened the heavy wooden door, the sound of water rushing from a shower head startled him for a second before he realised that it was coming from behind a locked shower door.
Harry sighed, rolling his eyes and decided to ignore Draco and instead focus on getting ready for bed.
Harry bit his lip to prevent himself from saying something he'd regret. He'd only a couple of hours ago gotten back on Ron's good side and he didn't want to go ruining it by defending Malfoy.
"Yes, fine. But I didn't tell you that," Harry hissed.
"Ever so helpful you are."
Malfoy was still absent the next morning too. Harry went down to breakfast with Ron, discussing who they wanted on the Quidditch team that year without thinking about the absent blonde too much.
He sat next to Hermione at breakfast who had Ron on her other side. She looked between them silently and groaned. Harry knew she was annoyed at him, but more annoyed at the fact that he and Ron were fighting. He elected to ignore her however, grabbing some toast and a goblet of Orange Juice.
"Fine." Ron conceded. "But know I'm not happy about it."
"No," said Harry firmly. "You and Reg will share a room only when I want the house demolished."
"What have I done?" Harry asked. It had been two weeks since he had talked to Justin and he still had not managed to work up the courage to talk to Draco about the two of them. Every time he tried he just ended up snogging him to avoid it. Draco, of course, never seemed to complain.
Harry stretched out of his arm, knocking himself against the opposing seeker. He struggled to keep his balance on his broom at such speeds with only one bony hand clasped around the handle. He watched in horror as Summerby's fingers reached further than his own, almost ready to make a grab for the game-ending ball.
The empty corridor helped echo Malfoy's laugh as Harry got to his feet.
"I swear to God, Malfoy," he hissed. "Didn't anything that happened last year knock you off your pretentious, pure-blood high horse?"
Harry couldn't find any words. He lay his cheek atop Draco's head delicately.
"Dra- Malfoy was just raised with that mindset. Now that he's an adult, no longer under his father's command he can make his own decisions. Most importantly, to be less of a dick," Harry commented.
He re-joined the two-person race with gusto, his eye's locked onto Park's small body who had found the snitch again. Though the girl had just given up an unbeatable advantage, this was still a Quidditch match, and Harry was determined to win.
"I'm fine," he squeezed his eyes closed to reground himself. "The final team will be posted on the common room notice board. Try-outs are over, thank you, everyone!"
"How can I be of service, Potter?" Draco asked without looking up from his parchment.
"Tomorrow, I understand you share a free period. I want the two of you to go down to the Quidditch pitch and... resolve your differences."
Harry's teammates descended around him, high fiving him and pulling him into a sweaty group hug.
He sat grumpily as the rest of the school filed out of the hall toward the school grounds. The food and plates had disappeared off the tables and Harry fiddled with the piece of parchment in front of him as he waited for everyone to leave.
Harry was slicing his Knotgrass while he was caught up in his head, thinking about how to talk to Draco. He thought jokingly to himself that the last person that he this much trouble talking to was Cho Chang.
"I'm not a child," said Terry without looking up from whatever he was reading.
"I forgot my jumper," Harry frowned. "What's going on?"
"What if I fail?"
"Hmm," Draco feigned to be deep in thought. "On my deathbed."
"When?" Harry knew he was prying but he couldn't help himself.
Harry pulled on a maroon beanie and a thick coat from his duffel bag in Ron's room. Another stretcher bed had been procured from the Weasley's garage with the help of Arthur and lay almost flush with Harry's. Harry did attempt to notify Mrs Weasley of exactly who was coming for Christmas but in her hurry to organise the house for tomorrow she did not let him finish.
"No!" Said Harry far too quickly for his liking. He saw Draco's lips twitch into a smirk and a wave of embarrassment swept over him.
After an undetermined time, he jumped to his feet as he heard the common room doors open.
"We can go back to kissing. Believe me, Potter, I've wanted this far longer than you have but I seem to have self-control," said Draco teasingly.
"Nothing," Harry said slowly, his cheeks burning red with embarrassment.
"Where are they?" Asked Regulus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform.
"Come on now you lot, let's get you settled in," McGonagall strode up the hall and the four got to their feet to follow the Headmistress. As they all left the hall no one looked to the back of the pack to see the scrawny boy following them at a distance.
"He left me a note this morning actually," Harry remembered. "Today in our free period."
"That sounds like a good idea to me," Hermione smiled, getting to her feet. "Would you guys like anything, I'm going to grab some food."
He didn't notice Park pulling away, or the tower dressed in Gryffindor banners he was about to crash into. That was, until he did.
Ron refused to meet Harry's eye, playing with his wand in his fingers. Harry sighed.
"How do you know when my birthday is?" Harry frowned.
"I mean,
"I think, that maybe we should spend a couple of minutes just us." Harry stared down at the floor between them. "It must be tough not being with your family at Christmas. I guess I can't understand what it must be like, all my Christmases growing up weren't very-"
"So are you two going to come with me to the station or no?" Harry asked.
The sun was shining brilliantly as they made their way across the grass toward the Black Lake. It really was a beautiful day. The students piled themselves into groups of three as they prepared to board the small boats. Harry, of course, clung to Ron and Hermione as they waved goodbye to Mrs Weasley, who had begun sobbing again, and her proud husband who was hiding the few tears that rolled down his cheeks.
"I know he will."
"No! Perfectly normal," Harry insisted.
"Like what?" Harry shrugged. "My aunt Petunia tried everything to make it lie flat and it didn't work."
"Don't have my wand sorry," Draco showed his hands. "Maybe I should play Chaser not Seeker, I'm alright at this."
"Yeah, so if we have to put up with your sorry arse for the next week, you have to participate." George spun around, walking backwards so he can address Malfoy directly. "Besides, maybe this would put that signature smirk back on your ferrety face. Malfoy McGloomyface is a bore."
"You think so little of me, Potter," Draco smiled sarcastically.
"Huh?"
"What are you up to?"
"It's okay," Harry says in a quiet voice, not wishing to aggravate him further. "Why didn't you do it on the Mark?"
They arrive back at the Burrow too soon but Harry knows it would only get worse tomorrow as they leave for Hogwarts.
"I'm fine," he he replied on autopilot.
The blonde haired boy collected himself, rubbing his hand across his eyes quickly and turning back to Harry. "See, easy."
"Shut up, Malfoy."
He sat down and didn't bother taking out his potions work, straightening his tie and running his fingers through his hair pedantically.
Draco huffed before he readjusted his position to lay on his stomach, propping himself up on his elbows next to Harry.
"This is nothing to be sorry about, I understand that your accident opened wounds that were not yet fully healed and all that progress we've made has been wiped away."
She frowned and flicked her wand again. "Sugar?"
He took a deep breath, shaking off any unnecessary doubt or worry, and opened the doors to the wing slowly. He saw Madame Pomfrey glance at him curiously before recognising him and walking toward the bed he knew belonged to Malfoy.
"Malfoy and I were here first!" Park retorted. "Slughorn wanted him to show me some of his moves."
"Sorry," Harry said quietly, pulling the spoon from the potion.
Harry, unsurprisingly, was was one of these people. He woke late and remained in bed, feigning sleep until he could no longer hear anyone else in the dorm. That's when he got up and saw the plate of food someone had brought up from the kitchens for him on his bedside table. He was grateful, he didn't feel like talking to anyone until he had to.
"You don't know?" Ginny raised an eyebrow. "It's all anyone's been talking about since yesterday afternoon!"
The walk to the Headmistress' office was long and solemn. All Harry could think about was the game he was missing and how he hoped the meeting would not take too long, so he could be able to watch at least some of the game.
Madame Hooch came in to tell the team that they were needed on the pitch. They walked out to the cheers of the crowd, Harry in the lead with Ron closely behind him. Some Gryffindors in the stands begin to sing the revised version of 'Weasley is our King" much to Ron's amusement who was bowing and waving as he walked behind Harry.
"Whatever you say, Potter," he sighed before resting his head on Harry's shoulder.
"What if I am in Slytherin?"
"Ten points from both Gryffindor and Slytherin," said McGonagall. "You had a disagreement? Would you two act your age for once in your life? You are not first years anymore, you are eighteen. I shouldn't even have to have this conversation with you."
"No," Harry admitted, looking around frantically. He pulled up his coat sleeve to glance at his watch.
The brooms were handed over and the Gryffindor team, as well as the eighth years, made their way up to the castle in the amber light of sunset.
That left Draco. Now, he made sense. Harry had an inkling that Draco would understand his current condition. It was on this day, or perhaps early tomorrow, the Draco's life had changed forever.
He could think of a million better things to do than being here in the brisk November air waiting for Malfoy. He could be playing Wizard's Chess with Ron or finishing his Transfiguration homework to name a couple.
"Nothing like that," Harry assured him. "I need... romantic advice."
Ron grumbled something unintelligible before Hermione threw a cashew at his head.
"The war's over! Can't I just be left alone now?"
Together they walked to her desk, Harry sat himself down in a slender white armchair facing the Professor.
"Come on," Ginny waved him over. "Apparently McGonagall has an important announcement during dinner."
No matter how hard Harry insisted that he would go, Hermione did not let up. Eventually, Harry got the message and caught up to Hermione's pace but she never loosened her iron grip on his wrist. He continuously looked back to Ron, trying to get him to help but he refused, simply stating that it was too funny and that Hermione did have a point.
"You expect me to ride a Shooting Star?" Malfoy asked with disgust as he ran his hands over the handle.
"Well, I like you," Harry smiled. Draco finally turned his head to look at him, the beginnings of a smile cracking his indifferent shell.
"Uh, care to explain?" Draco murmured, looking out at the crowd.
Hogwarts was buzzing with excitement. The Remembrance ball was the following night. Everyone had their robes and their dates. Well, most people anyway.
"I was at home. Father was angry at me for abandoning him and the Dark Lord. He was yelling. Nothing new," he shrugged. Harry felt a pang of sympathy for Draco he had rarely felt in the past.
"Draco, I literally cannot tell," said Harry with a monotone voice towards the Draco shaped blob
"What's this about?" Harry asked, slightly scared as he knew how intense Ginny could be.
"Ronald Weasley, don't you think for a second you're skipping out on studying just because you're at home," said Hermione, prodding her boyfriend with her wand. "You too, Harry."
"What do you want?" At least that's what Harry assumed he said, it was a bit hard to tell with the toothbrush in his mouth. Justin spat into the sink and rinsed his mouth before returning to Harry.
"No," sighed Ron. "Well, yes, but that's not what I'm talking about. Ginny told me about what happened."
"Fine, dare," Terry shook his head.
Draco looked around hastily. "We are not doing this out here." He dragged Harry to the nearest empty classroom and shoved him inside.
," McGonagall said loudly so they can all hear. The metal patterns came to life and retreat back into the hinges letting the doors swing open.
"Fine," Harry smirked, loving having Draco out of his comfort zone for once; the boy was so on edge. He scooted himself over onto the other bed, making sure he was invading Malfoy's personal space. "Have mine."
Draco got to his feet, letting go of Harry's hand.
"I always enjoy your warm welcomes," Malfoy smiled sarcastically.
"What?!" Ron groaned. Charlie shot him a warning glance which shut the youngest Weasley boy up instantly.
"How are we supposed to have a conversation with you sitting all the way over there?" Harry asked, quickly concocting a less desperately pathetic way to tell Malfoy to come closer.
Excitement was thick in the air during breakfast; it was the day of the first Quidditch match of the year
"No," said Draco eyeing Harry in a way that he didn't quite understand. "Not physically anyway."
They suddenly stopped moving, causing Harry to step on Ron's heel which earned him a punch in the arm.
But James caught his father's grey eye and fell silent. The five Potter-Malfoy's approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his father and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished.
"You know what?" Harry stifled a laugh. "I didn't need to know."
"I thought you'd never ask," Ron laughed, grabbing a bread roll to meet his.
"Oh, that's right. You can't be a Gryffindor, you're too much of a coward," glared Harry accusingly. Draco looked him dead in the eye, resuming his unreadable expression.
"I guess."
"As I said, everyone's outside," Harry smiled, handing complete control over from his brain to instinct. He pulled a little harder and Draco gave in, climbing onto Harry's bed on his knees as Harry lay back on his elbows.
"I'm tired, let's sit," Draco said.
"Yep," Harry's voice cracked.
"This was my fault," Draco admitted, unconsciously rubbing his thumb over the back of Harry's hand. "If I hadn't dropped them-"
"I've been better." Harry's eyes widened. The familiar voice belonged to Draco Malfoy, whom he had forgotten was supposed to be resting in the ward for the past couple of days.
"Because its the only way someone could ever love me," said Draco. He let out a small noise that sounded suspiciously like a sob but no tears come out. "Especially not... you."
Draco looked up at him with an expression that Harry only got to see on the rarest of occasions. The Draco with his barriers completely lowered, a Draco who didn't have any snarky comments, a Draco who was just a broken and lost soul.
"And I win, yet again!" Ron cheered. Harry folded his arms grumpily. "You need to step it up, mate."
"We should have left five minutes ago," said Harry after glancing down at his watch. He rushed to the ground to grab his bag and robe.
"Hey!" Harry laughed but it was too late, Malfoy was clutching the snitch triumphantly above his head. He flew over to the blonde in defeat while Draco gloated terribly.
"Ugh," Draco rolled his eyes before walking around Harry's bed to stand in front of him. "You are so thick, Potter. It's like you forget that magic exists."
"What was your nightmare about?" Draco asked.
"It's awful Hermione," Ron groaned as Professor Larrowreed retreated behind her desk to read some novel that looked old and worn, so Ron and Harry took the opportunity to tell Hermione about their sleeping arrangements. "The git has to sleep right next to us."
"Hey, that's not fair!" Said Ron after reading the note over his friend's shoulder.
"- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then told me to go away. He's
"More like what haven't you done," said Draco. "Sit up, and give me my pillow back."
The rest of the day passed slowly. A clear sky made their walk down to the greenhouses after lunch quite pleasant but later in the afternoon, Harry dragged his feet as he walked down to the dungeons. Seeing Malfoy was the last thing he wanted to do. The conflicting hatred and pity tore him apart whenever his mind conjured up the sunken, silver eyes of the Slytherin. He followed Ron and Hermione through the doors of the N.E.W.T dungeon but he couldn't see Malfoy anywhere.
Harry's eyes flickered open and he glanced around the dorm room as he would do for the very last time.
"A Weasley family tradition!" Charlie boomed.
Brooms and other Quidditch gear in hand, the Gryffindor team made their way down to the pitch to begin their first training of the term. Their next game wasn't until March but there was no way Harry was taking any chances during his last year at Hogwarts. He'd work his team to the bone if he had to.
The word felt strange on Harry's tongue but at the same time, it comforted him. Boyfriend.
"Keep quiet, Malfoy," Ron hissed. As they made their way through the crowd of witches and wizards waving their children off to Hogwarts before term resumes. He turns to Harry. "I'm still annoyed you let him use the cloak."
Draco tentatively placed his fingertips delicately atop Harry's and stepped forward into the common room.
When Harry had followed Ron up to the dorms after dinner that night, he had not seen Malfoy join them. He assumed it would be a lot less conspicuous for him to stay down by the fire while Harry would lie in his bed for a few hours before sneaking off to meet him there.
On their way to the dungeons, the two spotted Madame Hooch, the Quidditch coach and new Head of Gryffindor house. They told her the news of Harry's new broom and continuation of his captaincy. She, of course, was ecstatic and couldn't wait for tryouts. She tossed Ron the key to the Quidditch shed as they were about to head into the depths of the castle so they could toss a quaffle about while breaking in the new broom.
"I want to travel," Malfoy shrugged. "If I'm careful about how I deal with my father's frozen accounts I shouldn't have to work at all."
Harry walked at an incredibly fast pace against the tide of students with his fists balled up by his sides. No one dared stand in his way as his scowl parted the crowd like the red sea.
"No!" Harry scoffed. "In fact, I was the one annoying him! Stop assuming he's up to no good, he has changed!"
He hadn't told anyone either, not even Ron. How could he even bring that up with him? After he had returned from the empty classroom to the Great Hall, he had received many questions as to where he went from not only his circle of friends but also many nosy passerbys. He simply said that the two talked, no details.
"Hmm, truth," said Justin decided, adjusting himself on his bed under his boyfriend who in turn adjusted himself accordingly.
"I'll play Keeper, you two chase," Ron sighed, obviously trying to express his disappointment
"Even Potions?"
His movements were slow and deliberate. Harry watched intently as Draco lifted his hand and rested it on Harry's arm. Harry took this moment to catch Draco's gaze at such a close distance. Green and silver intertwined on the train station platform that Christmas Eve,
"It's a bit weird," Ron mused as he sat with Harry in what used to be their favourite armchairs. "Being back here, you know?"
"Spending all your time with the git, being all friendly. It's disturbing and I don't trust him," he huffed.
The nurse signalled for him to wait before she headed back to her desk briskly. So there Harry stood, rather awkwardly while he listened keenly to the soft rustling of fabric and clinking of metal against metal.
Harry didn't say anything in return while he followed the Slytherin boy, staring at the back of his head.
"Mate, you don't seem fine," said Ron.
"Well, I guess after the war we spent a lot of time together. I couldn't come to school last year, I'm Muggle-born, so Ernie sent me letters every week without fail. I guess I started realising how much I need him. So hanging out all summer made us both come to terms with our feelings and he asked me to be his boyfriend."
"You can say that," Harry laughed under his breath. "He's still his snarky self."
This close to Malfoy, Harry could recognise his cologne on the woollen fabric, he could also recognise the chocolate stain near Draco's collarbone,
"How about now?" Asked Draco softly, leaning his forehead on Harry's. "Do you know now?"
Draco lazily laced his fingers through Harry's in response, their hand loosely intertwined together.
"Oh, Ginny! What's up?" Harry asked, halting the other two eighth years in their presence.
"And besides, we can't have Hufflepuff win the cup!" Ron added. "Lions eat badgers for breakfast!"
"Then let's go," Draco lent back, folding his arms.
Pretend retching noises could be heard from the door. Both boys looked up with flushed faces to the source of the noise.
"Mrs Malfoy?"
"Please don't," Malfoy huffed.
"Yes, sorry. Continue," Draco waved with his free hand.
The dorm room was empty except the two of them as Harry stood in the doorway.
"Go, Potter, or I'll get Madame Pomfrey to escort you out."
The other two young people and their aging supervisor were in fact from the American wizarding school as Ron and Draco had pointed out. The Head boy and girl were eager to chat to him but Harry only spluttered out few syllable answers in a monotone voice.
"I think you need a break. We're going to Hogsmeade tomorrow, come with me."
Draco pulled back again and Harry was about to argue but he planted a peck on Harry's lips before he could say anything.
"And I stand by that. You could pull it up to keep it out of your face if that bothered you. But I refuse to talk about it."
Kingsley Shacklebolt introduced him to the new head of Magical Law Enforcement, the President of the American magical community as well as the Australian and Russian Ministers for Magic.
His team flew down to meet him and they cheered together as they were one match closer to winning the Quidditch cup.
"I'll take them back," Terry sighed dramatically. "The journey may exhaust me, don't expect me to make an appearance at this stupid party."
Professor Mellow's words felt like a punch in Harry's gut.
Harry pushed open the doors to the Hospital wing and immediately spotted the only bed which was inhabited.
"There will be nothing stuffy about it when I'm the best Auror that place has ever seen!"
Slughorn released them from his class with Harry feeling even worse.
"Really?" Harry suddenly felt very obnoxious.
"Nonsense, have some more!" A large serving of the meal neatly carried itself to Harry's plate without a drop of sauce hitting the wooden table. Harry sighed. This confirmed that McGonagall had written to Molly about his, problem. Harry reluctantly picked up his fork. He knew he had to make an attempt, even though his stomach was protesting at the idea because Mrs Weasley would only push the matter further.
Harry's eyes fluttered open and he received a blurry view of Ron's bedroom ceiling as he had done every morning for the last week. Except today was different. Today there was another presence in the room. Also, it was Christmas Day.
"Just let him use the owl, Ron." Both boys turned their heads toward the door where Ginny was walking past, clearly just hearing a snippet of the conversation.
"The git was provoking them, I suppose," Ron huffed, Hermione hit him on the arm.
"Well, last place is!" Michael shouted. "Ravenclaw didn't win a single game this year!"
," a voice inside his head growled. Harry couldn't help himself but to look back up at the plaques out of morbid curiousity. He noticed that under the Slytherin banner only one name was etched into the gold plaque, but from across the hall, he couldn't make out what it was. It turned out a lot of students were observing the newest addition to the Great Hall as it took Professor McGonagall three attempts of clearing out her throat to get everybody's attention.
In the end, Draco and Harry's potion turned out less than fine. Harry stirred the cauldron clockwise instead of anti-clockwise which Professor Slughorn told him would have not only caused the drinker short-term memory loss, but all the hair on their body would fall out.
"Arresto Momentum!" Malfoy shouted. The ball slowed as it landed in the Slytherin's hands. "You're going to have to change up your strategy, Potter. You're getting lazy."
"I'm fine, really," Harry tried to sit up but with a flick of the nurse's wand, he is forced back down.
Everything was calm until Harry saw Malfoy slink off out of the hall. It was sixth year all over again. Harry's mind raced with all the possible things Malfoy could be getting up to while the whole school was distracted by the feast. He reminded himself that Malfoy didn't really have any friends and probably wanted to eat and leave as soon as possible, that was until he saw a few Gryffindor students from the middle of the table get up and follow Malfoy out.
"I... how?" Harry stuttered. He found himself unconsciously reaching toward him.
"Yes, we can actually have a conversation in here," Hermione glanced between Ron and Harry, trying to get them to pick up on her intentions.
Ron was still glaring at Hermione, his hands curled into fists on the table.
"Teams?" Ron asked. "I call captaincy."
"Merlin, you are blind!" He exclaimed.
Harry quickly avoided the Quaffle on his vastly superior broom. "What was that?" Harry chuckled, circling around and snatching the ball out of the air. "Too slow. Depulso!"
"Something you said earlier in the year, or Ernie said it. You said your first crush was a girl, but you have a boyfriend now. Do these things change?"
Harry stayed mostly silent during these retellings, the memories playing in his mind like a theatre as he relived every dark and terrifying moment. Hermione sensed this and placed a hand on his forearm which he felt tethered himself to reality, even just a little bit.
"Whatever helps," Harry mumbled.
"Maybe if studying is the agenda, we should stay here, utilise the library," Harry suggested. Ron and Hermione both looked at him like he had just suggested that they bring Voldemort back from the dead.
"Come on, Ferret," Ron shoved Draco up onto the table next to Harry.
"So who is it? You better not be stepping down from my sister."
"For now," Harry whispered. "We are... testing the waters."
He had little trouble catching up to Malfoy as he neared the stadium, he rolled around him, teasing him lightly before speeding off.
And with that McGonagall left Harry alone with a buttered bread roll with a few pieces of chicken inside as well as a banana.
Thankfully, when Ron shook his best friend's shoulder, the dark-haired boy groaned and Ron let out a sigh of relief.
"It's fine," Draco placed his suitcase emblazoned with the Malfoy crest at the foot of the makeshift bed. "But I guess it is better than being at Hogwarts or... home."
"Self-Preservation," Harry muttered, remembering his and Malfoy's conversation in the common room. "He's a through and through Slytherin."
He checked the battered, old watch that had once been Fabian Prewitt's. "It's nearly eleven, you should get on board."
There was no feeling of guilt, there was no fear that someone would walk in on them. Both wizards smiled against each other as Draco fell beside him, both their eyes fluttering open for a second to gaze at the other before Draco placed his hand on Harry's cheek and reconnected their lips.
"I think you're forgetting something!" Ron yelled, quieting the again, unsettling crowd.
"Oh," was all Harry managed, his head spinning. Who else could he have told, what if Draco hated him for it?
Harry could offer no response. He felt his eyes drifting to the horrible disfigurement of Malfoy's face. Their eyes met.
The last trace of steam evaporated into the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell.
"I think you should know that the Patronus charm is a very advanced piece of magic. You aren't going to be the only one who can't do it," said Draco, rubbing small circles into Harry's back
Draco reached out to touch the corporeal beast but it disintegrated as his fingers ran along its side.
"Your whole life has been traumatic, now that all of that has stopped its, how can I explain it? It's like you've been playing an intense game of Quidditch, yes it hurts when you get a bludger to the arm, yes you're out of breath, yes your hands are raw from gripping your broom but the pain sets in when your feet hit the ground doesn't it. That's the adrenaline wearing off. Your whole life you have been running on adrenaline and now that you've stopped, it's all catching up to you."
McGonagall had whisked Draco away some time ago to discuss an urgent matter and Harry had given up searching for Ron and Hermione after a matter of minutes.
"Drop it, Potter," Draco warned.
"Disillusionment charm," said Draco, remaining in a hushed tone. "I lifted it when I came in here just now, I don't want everyone else knowing I'm pathetic. Weasley and I, we went to the kitchens and got you breakfast. I can't believe I didn't know where the kitchens were. My father always refused to tell me."
For an uncalculatable amount of time, the two star-crossed lovers held each other as if their very lives depended on it.
"Girls on the left and boys on the right. Sleep tight everybody," McGonagall smiled before leaving.
"I don't want to talk about it, Potter," warned Draco.
"Are you going up or not?" It said in a rather annoyed voice.
The doors opened again and this time Hermione, Ginny and Neville barrelled in.
"Something like that," Harry's voice was small and shaky.
"Why are you asking me? What about Ginny? How did you know you had feelings for her?" Ron frowned.
It was the small brushes of their hands during their potions tutorials, the antagonising whispers during their potions class, the purposeful nudges and glances in the dorm room. These were the things that made that strange feeling in Harry's stomach appear and distract his entire self from what he is supposed to be doing.
"Well, now that they're here I think we can begin dinner," Hermione cut through the silence of the room, taking a seat next to Ron at the table who was glaring at Malfoy. Mrs Weasley collected herself and nodded in agreement, flicking her wand and causing the lids of the pots on the table runner to lift off and pile themselves in the sink.
"The same," Draco sighed. "What does the Chosen One have nightmares about?"
"I'm not sure, I guess," he said, exhaling heavily.
One foot in front of the other. That's the mantra Harry repeated in his head. He inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly, watching his breath mingle with the cold air in front of him.
"He made that
"It's Malfoy," said Ron. "Even after Harry saved his ass last year, he's still a git."
"Potter, sit," McGonagall ordered. Harry did not hesitate in taking a seat in the cream armchair, it wasn't very comfortable, the line layer of upholstery seemed to be stretched over a wooden frame with the bare minimum of padding. "Would you like to explain yourselves?"
"You are the worst," Draco chuckled.
Harry steadied himself before turning the door handle of Ron's room to step inside.
"I'm not a child, Potter," he spat. "And why wouldn't I be?"
"I swear to God," Harry growled. Malfoy opened one eye and looked at his visitor. He rolled his eyes and closed it again. "Those little shits will be sorry."
"Friends who kissed and are totally gay for each other!" Ron whispered aggressively.
"Let me finish, Potter," Draco elbowed his boyfriend in the side. "The Ministry are letting her come to my graduation."
"Peppermint toad?" Harry offered, holding the box out toward Malfoy. The last thing he wanted tonight was for Draco and Ron to argue.
Harry looked up immediately to see Draco Malfoy saunter back into the room. Most of his outfit was assembled but Harry immediately noticed that he had neglected to button up his shirt just yet.
He followed the boot prints in the snow until he saw the outline of a person sitting on a tree stump.
"You're the one who came parading out here half naked!" Harry said, spinning back around.
The afternoon dissolved into the evening, the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall ate a triumphant dinner, most likely annoying the other houses as they laughed and shouted, revelling in their victory in the true spirit of their house.
He watched Dobby die in his arms, he cried as he saw Fred's sold corpse on the floor of the Great Hall. He saw the life drain from Severus Snape's eyes and he lost consciousness as all his friends stood around him with tears in their eyes screaming one thing.
Harry let out a choked cry.
"Yeah," Draco smiled a little at Ron's enthusiasm. "Just give it a word and it will come back to you immediately, they say from anywhere in the world, but I doubt that."
"Death Eater?"
"I'm sure that can be easily arranged. Quite a few parties have already expressed interest in... sponsoring you," she watched his reaction.
Draco had disappeared into the bathroom some time ago. Harry found himself glancing towards the locked door anxiously. It wasn't uncommon for him to retreat into the privacy of the ensuite while the rest of the dorm was changing. Harry often found himself wondering why this was but he never dared to pry.
"That insufferable git!" Ron groaned, falling onto his bed.
The team entered the common room, except for Harry, who remained rooted to the spot in complete shock at the simple but heart-stopping word.
"And I bet you still haven't tried to procure one, have you?" Draco sighed.
"Maybe you should pay me," Draco said after a few seconds, in a nonchalant tone.
Harry glanced at his watch again.
"Potter, you just have to admit that I'm just a better Seeker than you," Draco smiled as Harry drew near.
"Tea?" McGonagall offered. Harry nodded politely. With a flick of her wand, Harry heard a kettle begin to boil in a room off to the side.
But James merely laughed, permitting his blonde father to kiss him on the forehead and gave Harry one last hug before leaping onto the rapidly filling train.
He had not recognised him for it had been over a year since he had seen the now fifth-year boy. His shoulders slumped as he turned and Harry saw the face of Dennis Creevey as he high fived his friends.
Draco caught Harry looking at him and smirked before giving him an over exaggerated wink to which Harry rolled his eyes and turned away but could still see the Slytherin in the mirror's reflection.
Not a single thought could form in Harry's mind. Draco. Fucking. Malfoy. All this time.
"No, Potter," McGonagall shushed him in an exasperated tone. "Both of you are to remain in the castle for the remainder of the game as punishment."
"Oh good, you're not having sex," Ernie smiled appreciatively.
"Do you wanna, uh, go?" Harry offered his forearm to Malfoy. The Slytherin boy looked down at the arm offered to him, uncertainty in his silver eyes.
Harry didn't know what to say to that, there was truth in her words, but it wasn't the truth he wanted to hear. He finished the piece of buttered toast in his hand and under Hermione's stern gaze, he ate another.
"Now, I won't keep you any longer from Professor Mellow, I'll see you at the match, Potter."
"What? I can't!" Harry pleaded.
"Two of you in one morning? It's too early for this," said the gargoyle. Before Harry could even rebut about how the Gargoyle sleeps all day anyway he was too caught up in what it had actually said. Two of you?
be," said James, grinning at his younger brother. "There's nothing wrong with that. He
"I don't know," Harry muttered. He did know really, or at least have an idea.
"I was there again," Harry began, nodding in the general direction of the forest. "Except there were no Death Eaters, no Hagrid, just him. He told me that he was going to kill me, he does that a lot. But this time he told me that I had to choose either you or Ron to kill as well."
The comfort of the simple touch was enough for Harry to slowly turn his head to Malfoy who did the same.
"What, scared Malfoy?" Harry laughed.
"The Shrieking Shack?" Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Yeah," said Harry nervously. "It's not like I like spending time with him. But he has changed, a little."
"Uh-huh, just go back to kissing me." Harry knew how desperate he sounded but he couldn't care less as Draco happily obliged his request.
In the distance, he could see a thin stream of smoke billowing out of the chimney of the small hut belonging to the Groundskeeper Hagrid, he must remind himself to go and visit him soon. The surface of the Black Lake was still, reflecting the sky and the clouds above perfectly. The Whomping Willow stood proudly, nothing giving away the fact that it was sentient. Harry decided at that moment that maybe coming back to Hogwarts wasn't such a bad idea after all.
He tossed it to him and Draco's seeker's reflexes caught it without hesitation. His expression made it clear to Harry that he was not impressed.
"Don't be gross, Potter," Draco shoved him lightly.
The pub was mostly empty as per usual but their arrival turned no heads. That is except Aberforth.
"What about me and Harry's brooms?" Ron frowned.
"Uh, no I haven't," Harry admitted.
"It would be rude to deny it, it's not money they'll supply, just an adequate broom that will allow Gryffindor to win the Cup again," she said with a twinkle in her eye.
"Now, how do you find the robes?" Draco asked.
Harry soon was able to move almost as fluidly as Draco across the floor and the two were entirely bright smiles and laughs. Harry realised how much he loved Draco's laugh. Not his cynical, know-it-all chuckle, but Draco's genuine and pure laugh that rang like sweet bells in his ears.
In his visual search, his eyes landed in the stands where he picked out Hermione, Draco and Neville all cheering for him.
"Yeah sure," Harry looked back to his friends hesitantly. Hermione was motioning for him to go while Ron was glaring at Malfoy, great signals.
"What?" Harry asked innocently, looking up at Draco who was sitting on Harry's thighs with his legs either side. "What am I doing?"
"Well, have
Harry inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly. Images of the war haunted his mind at every mention of it.
"I know! He has sat by himself all year but he took the empty seat beside Parvati and I." Hermione explained. "He even corrected some of my notes I had misheard!"
"Well, I'll update you on everything when you come down," Ron patted him on the back reassuringly.
Harry extended his arm out and Park did the same. Their hands were mere centimetres apart as they reached for the game-ending ball. It was so close.
"You know, like...
"I'm tired," said Draco. "And, as Granger said, I'm sure you appreciate the company."
"It has gone all to fast," Hermione laughed.
tried?" Harry raised his voice a little, he wasn't sure why he was getting angry.
"An outing between one probably gay guy and one straight guy with gay feelings for the first guy," Ron raised an eyebrow.
Draco walked over his bed to sit and face Harry, their knees were but inches apart. Something the back of Harry's mind told him to shuffle even closer to Malfoy. He ignored it.
Harry extended a hand toward Draco. Sure, it was only a small step into the common room but he felt like it was the right thing to do.
Harry rolled his eyes and met him at the sink beside him. "So how are you feeling, graduating in a few hours?"
Harry looked at Malfoy and watched him close his eyes. The Adam's Apple in his throat moved as he swallowed thickly, clearly he was thinking about the distressing day or days where he tried to rip open his skin. Harry couldn't help staring at him like this; the messy hair, the unguarded nature. Harry did nothing to stop his eyes raking over his body. He had never seen Malfoy like this, even Harry could admit that with his guard lowered he appeared quite handsome, though he would rather take a swim in the Black Lake than admit that to him.
Today was Saturday and a Hogsmeade visit day. Harry did not want to go with Ron when he was acting so childish, but Hermione insisted and the two gave in. Harry was now hoping to slip away from them at some point to hunt down the malignant Gryffindors who decided that they themselves would punish Malfoy for his crimes.
Harry watched sullenly as the younger Gryffindor students headed off to the warm, cosy common room and dorms Harry had fallen in love with. The hall emptied and now there were only four students left at the scarlet and gold table.
The bell signalling the end of the school day resonated through the school and Harry and Ron waste no time in throwing their quills and parchment into their bags and racing back to the Eighth year dorms to change.
"I'll take my own bed thanks," Ron shoved Harry's legs off the side of his bed, sitting down as Harry looked at him with mock betrayal in his eyes. "Malfoy can top and tail with Harry."
"Well, you have seen Macmillan and Finch-Fletchley lounging around the common room and dorm, practically on top of each other," Draco piled the beeswax into his hands.
"It's not like Malfoy to skip a class he excels at," said Hermione with a puzzled face.
"No, tell me. Was it them again?" Harry asked, reaching out to Malfoy's arm. He pulls himself away and jumps to his feet away from him.
"And, I would like to address another matter," McGonagall said gravely. Harry inhaled slowly, he was not in a mood for a lecture about his diet, or his grades, or tutoring. "Would you happen to have any insight as to why, a mere five minutes after breakfast, that it was brought to my attention that five Gryffindor fourth years were found with bright purple skin, unable to provide any evidence of their attacker because all that could come out of their mouth was, and I quote, 'I will never bother Draco Malfoy again'?"
! Snogging
He made his way down the wooden stairs, making sure they creaked as little as possible under his weight.
Harry stayed low to his broom as he weaved between the other players, rolling and diving to avoid collisions and bludgers.
"How do you know he's even going to be there?" Hermione asked as she made her way next to Harry as he looked in the mirror, touching his hair hopelessly.
Harry watched anxiously as Draco said something to Ron with a hushed voice so Harry couldn't hear.
Many students congratulated the team as they walked through the corridors, even some of the Slytherin team smiled at them as they headed in the opposite direction of the dungeons for the night.
"Mr Potter?" McGonagall smiled, placing a hand on his shoulder as if already checking up on him. "There are some people who would like to meet you, and some who I'm sure you've already met."
Ron grumbled something inaudible but took his girlfriend's hand to join the few couples that had already taken to the dance floor.
"Eurghh!" He cried, the room exploded in laughter. "Carpet!"
"Why would I do that, Potter?" Said Draco cheekily.
"Funny that," Harry turned adjusted himself to face Draco, propping himself up with one elbow and draping his other arm over the pale boy's chest.
"At least we won't have him jeering at us the whole time," Harry shrugged.
"Hey, you never told us what happened," said Ron. "You and Malfoy's tutoring session."
None of the trio said anything further, standing awkwardly as the platform emptied.
"Why didn't you tell me? I'm your best friend for Merlin's sake!" Ron folded his arms across his chest. "And her brother."
"Yeah, I'm just reading," Harry assured him.
The only difference Harry noticed as he took a seat, was under each of the house banners adorning the stone wall from which they entered the hall was four gold plaques underneath each of the house tapestries and Harry didn't need to look for very long to guess what they were for. The writing etched into each of them listed the students who gave their lives in the final battle. Harry wrenched his eyes down to stare at the wood table beneath him, forcing air into his lungs steadily despite their persistent rattling.
Suddenly he was ten again, sitting in his cupboard under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive, sobbing softly to himself after Dudley and his friends had yet again beat him up as his uncle bashed his knuckles on the door demanding him to get up,
"Why thank you," Draco grinned as he sat up off of Harry. "Be my pillow."
Harry eagerly grabbed a plate and loaded it full of bacon, eggs and two slices of toast before sitting down next to Ron at the table. Mr Weasley, followed shortly by George, arrived in the kitchen as Harry buttered his toast, watching the butter melt slowly into the bread before taking a bite.
"I guess... I just knew," Harry glanced over to his ex-girlfriend.
It occurred to Harry as he laid back onto his pillow and brought both his hands up to cup Draco's face that this was the first kiss of its kind. Every time they had kissed before was fuelled by passion and the need to avoid talking but this was different. Harry felt a flutter in his stomach as their lips brushed against each other's.
He held his breath, his eyes closed tight as the hot water hit his face. He wasn't sure what he was trying to achieve. Perhaps on some unconscious level, he was trying to clean away the pain of his past.
Harry led the way up the creaking stairs, looking back to Draco every so often, laughing to himself as the ex-rich kid looked around in surprise at the Burrow's dirty and raggedy interior. Harry only hoped that he was shocked at the number of rooms in the house rather than its' haphazard appearance.
Harry sat next to his best friend and pulled out the last remaining empty chair for Malfoy. He studied at Arthur's unsure expression as the son of the man who despised him and his family sat at his table next to him silently, fully aware of all the eyes upon him.
Harry, of course, was referring to the moment that happened five days and twenty-two hours ago, not that he was counting. Unfortunately, as their N.E.W.Ts drew ever closer, he and Draco had not had many chances to talk since the kiss in the Shrieking Shack. Even in potions, Slughorn decided that in preparation for their exams that they should brew their concoctions individually. Their interactions over the past week had been limited to small smiles as they passed each other in hallways and in the dorm room as they prepared for bed.
"That sounds an awful lot like a proposal, Potter," Draco smirked.
clear," Harry smiled to himself.
Draco was bent over a porcelain sink, toothbrush hanging lazily from his mouth as he fussed over his hair. He had his shirt on, unbuttoned of course in dramatic Malfoy style. His black belt had been laced through the belt loops of his pants but had not been fastened.
"What about you Neville?" Ron changed the topic quickly to escape the wrath of his girlfriend.
"Let's go out to the Quidditch pitch," Draco suggested. "Bring your Christmas present."
Draco smiled and shuffled himself toward Harry at the top of the bed. Draco sat cross-legged in front of Harry. Their knees touched through the sheets and Harry's heart doubled in pace.
"Well, what about you?" Harry frowned. "Why is this all on me?"
"Headmistress said she'll be with you soon, she just had to take care of something," the gargoyle said in a nonchalant tone. The door opened and Harry walked up the stairs cautiously, making his way into the room. He looked around and saw many new things since he was last there. McGonagall seemed to be a fan of simplistic interior design, hanging many white and gold tapestries around the room as well as furnishings that adhered to that colour scheme.
?" Demanded Regulus, as he and Rose craned round to look at the other students.
He opened his eyes and grabbed the pillow to see a fuzzy Draco Malfoy standing beside his bed wearing his usual not-so-casual clothes and his usual grumpy expression.
"Enough already!" Hermione yelled, slamming her hand and her mug of Butterbeer down on the table. Neville let loose a little squeal, clearly realising he has just walked into something he did not know the backstory of. "For the last seven years, you two have been driving me insane! Ronald Bilius Weasley, Harry James Potter. Will the two of you look each other in the eye and talk!"
The chatter was comforting. The warmth of the crackling fireplace and his full belly only added to the comforting atmosphere. He felt safe.
Harry took a sharp breath as his eyes flew open, staring up at the velvet hangings of his bed.
"You don't know that he's gay," Harry said defensively.
"I see. Potter, I must ask, do you find yourself feeling guilty about the events that transpired here four months ago?" She peered at him as he shuffled uncomfortably in his chair.
As the eighth years entered the hall there certainly were some turned heads admiring their coordination and style. The hall itself was beautiful. There was a subtle spring theme with large vases of flowers on every surface, pastel tablecloths and candles. There were small lights floating around the ceiling that Harry had to assume were some kind of bewitched fireflies. They danced beautifully through the air, illuminating the twilight sky in the heavens.
It was all over, it really was all over.
"You know, that makes a lot of sense," said Harry, making sure his sarcastic tone was evident. "Really explains a lot about you."
"I understand that you're,
"Harry, you've been through a lot if you need to talk-"
"Oh."
This, however, was pushed to the back of his mind when he and Ron walked down the Quidditch pitch on Sunday afternoon to conduct the Gryffindor Quidditch trials.
It had grown a lot over the past year, at the back of his head, the strands were almost reaching the base of his neck and Harry took the pleasure of sinking his fingers into it, it was as if he was holding on for dear life.
During lunch, Ron talked animatedly to Hermione about Harry's new broom while Harry pretended to look over his notes from that morning. His stomach growled in protest but he ignored it.
"She said she didn't want to treat you like a child," Hermione rested a hand on his forearm. "But you gave her no choice."
Harry arrived in the common room with his potions things and sat at a two-chair desk. Looking around the room, he could not see Malfoy. He chuckled to himself about how Draco had such little faith that he'd be on time yet was late himself.
"Harry, help!" Hermione yelled. Harry spun around quickly to see the Weasleys, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Luna and Hagrid standing behind him. He tried to run to them, but his feet were heavy like lead.
"Two against one," Harry smirked, signing off on his letter. "And I'm sure Pig would be happy to spread his wings for once."
"Who was it?" Harry asked.
"Ginny, no!" Ron glares at her.
In a way, Harry could relate to his childhood rival on a level that Ron, Hermione or anyone else in his life could not. Both their childhoods had been tangled up with the Dark Lord against their will and today, even after his death, they were still being affected in different ways to everyone else.
"I thought I had a good reason for hating you all these years, but I really didn't," said Malfoy suddenly. Harry wasn't quite sure how he should respond to this. It was such an absurd statement that seemingly came out of nowhere. So Harry said nothing.
"I..." Malfoy bit his lip, refusing to meet Harry's eye. "Yeah, okay. They threatened me that if they see me talking to you, they'll come for me again."
"How have you been, Harry? I haven't seen you all day, so sorry about that." Her smile was too bright, her eyes too full of hope.
"All that's happened has put a lot of stress on you and you really don't need a relationship right now?" She said incredibly fast. Harry stopped and studied her face. It wasn't upset or angry, it was concerned.
"It did for me," said Harry.
The ball had no chance of touching Harry. He swiftly moved out of its path, laughing mockingly as he did so. With a flick of his wand, he summoned the ball to him and had it hover in front of him.
"Right," he shouted, causing the group of Gryffindors to freeze and turn to him. "Let's go."
Malfoy never ceased his glaring at Harry whilst he mounted the broom begrudgingly. Harry laughed under his breath as Malfoy kicked off the grass and rose in the air, clutching the rickety broom for dear life.
Harry mouthed the word to feel it on his tongue. "Bisexual," he said out loud. "Thank you, Justin. You've been a lot of help."
Harry watched in horror as they struggled against their bonds.
The whole class groaned when Slughorn assigned partners for the rest of the year, claiming that no one should be slacking off in their most crucial year. Harry was not surprised by the Potions master's decision to assign him to Malfoy but that was not to say that he was happy about it.
"Malfoy is accounted for," McGonagall said. "He is recovering from a cold in the Hospital Wing."
"This!" Ron exclaimed. Harry glanced up, it was a wooden box. "Sit up."
"You interrupted them?" Said Draco. "You are so like Ron-"
Malfoy nodded, looking down at his lap.
"He's in shock," Harry laughed. "I may have told him."
"Okay, you have a go," Harry rolled his eyes. "If you're not a pussy."
Walking out of the dungeons on the Friday afternoon, the two week's of N.E.W.T examinations over, Harry breathed a unanimous sigh of relief with every other seventh and eighth-year student also exiting the Potions classrooms.
"Can we not make this a big deal," Harry looked around hurriedly, thankfully Ron's raise in voice didn't attract any attention.
They shook hands, promising a memorable match, before returning to their teams.
"After the kiss, my stupid and over the top declaration of affection, this right now. What are we, Harry?" Harry realised that he was witnessing a Draco with absolutely none of his barriers up. This Draco's voice cracked and wavered as he talked and this Draco held him tight.
"Can you two relax?" Harry rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands. "He wants to repent, he wants to start over."
Harry scanned around, looking for the tiny winged ball while also keeping an eye on Summerby, who was circling the pitch intently.
They left quietly, Draco making sure no one important was watching them. They walked in silence in the direction of the Eighth year's wing, Harry heard Draco huff in disgust every time they passed a couple making out against the wall. Harry smiled to himself at this and nudged him a little.
"Yeah, And let's keep it on the off the radar, please."
Harry didn't say anything for a while, simply studying Draco's face. "Who are you and what have you done with Draco?"
Harry hung his head and didn't bother replying. There was some truth in her words.
As soon as Harry stepped onto the platform, a conflicting wave of emotion crashed down onto him. The evening was clear, in the distance the Hogwarts castle was visible and standing proudly against the horizon. Hogwarts was the only place Harry had ever felt at home for his entire life, he had found his first friends there, he had found things that he was good at there. But now, it was the site where so many people had died to make sure that he didn't. He swallowed the lump in his throat and quickly tore his eyes away from it.
"That doesn't change the fact that I can't do it," Harry looked up at Draco who was unsurely placing a hand on Harry's shoulder.
"Lemon."
Draco tapped the tip of his wand to the top of Harry's head and the slightly shorter body felt a shiver down his spine. Draco stepped back, admiring his work and Harry spun around to look in the mirror. His hair was straight, combed in a side part and slightly backward. Harry touched it tentatively but Draco slapped his hand out of the way.
"No, keep stirring it!" Draco slapped the back of Harry's wrist. "Just... why are you ignoring me?"
Harry glanced around the dorm room where he saw that most of its occupants were looking at the two of them, eyebrows raised.
He was almost deaf to the cheers of the crowd as he stared in disbelief at the dormant snitch that lay in the palm of his hand. His chest heaved, struggling for air after the physical stress he had been under.
"That's good to hear," McGonagall nodded. "And what about Mr Malfoy, I have received the notes from your latest tutoring session and am pleased to see you two have gotten past your differences."
Harry's thoughts went straight to the Prophet. Did some sleazy journalist write another horrid article about him?
"I'm fine," said Draco, grabbing Harry's quill and crossing out something that he had written.
"Exactly."
He wasn't sure why he was obeying Malfoy's words so easily. His first thought was that Malfoy had imperised him without his knowledge.
Harry was having the time of his life on a lovely spring afternoon, on top of his covers and engaging in a light afternoon nap when he was so rudely awoken by a pillow hitting his face.
"I said, leave me alone," he reiterated. "I can't speak to you here."
"Can we just, eat?" Asked Harry awkwardly, very conscious of those attempting to listen in to their conversation as they passed.
He practically lay flat on his broom, willing it to inch forward just ahead of Park's. He wriggled further up his broom, just enough so that it wouldn't tip. He was almost there.
"And why are we outside when we could be sitting in front of a perfectly good fireplace?" Draco complained as Harry dragged him out into the snowy garden of the Burrow.
Harry picked up the spines and offered them to Draco lazily.
"What do I get out of this? I know that you aren't going to tell me about yours," said Harry, looking away from Draco.
"You're sorry?" Draco let out a sarcastic laugh. "Not everything is about you, Potter! This is only about me! You were just an easy target."
"Thank you," Harry chuckled under his breath knowing that no matter how hard Draco pushed him in their tutorials, he could never be the Half Blood Prince.
Draco had not noticed his staring as he was looking the other way which Harry could not be more thankful for. Malfoy had barely made it out the large wooden doors of the Entrance Hall before mounting his broom and racing off across the Hogwarts grounds.
"Fine, I guess," he replied. "I had another nightmare last night."
"I'll be outside the door," Draco assured. Harry turned the handle and went inside before poking his head back out again.
But then he turned to face him, and Harry's complexion turned as white as the ghost in front of his body.
Looking at his watch, there was only around fifteen minutes left of the Gryffindor and Slytherin Potions class so Harry took his time as he made his way to the dungeons. He thought about McGonagall's request. Sure, he'd love to return to the Burrow with Ron, Hermione and Ginny for Christmas. But on the other hand, he knew Draco would not return to the Malfoy Manor but him being alone at Hogwarts was an idea that Harry wasn't comfortable with. He was hopeful that all of his bullies would leave for the holidays but he knew that Malfoy had been damaged by the horrors of his past just as much as he was. Being alone in the castle was not something he'd wish upon Malfoy, not after the events that occurred in the past two years.
Stepping inside the portrait hole was like stepping into another life. A life that felt like a millennium ago as well as just yesterday. The crowd of Gryffindors cheered as he looked around the common room clad in scarlet and gold.
"Oh, I forgot," said Harry but by 'forgot' he meant he was asleep.
Draco peered into Harry's eyes for a few seconds before answering as if he was looking for something. "That morning where I was feeling so low, so unlovable, so despicable and you, Harry Potter, the one I have been infatuated with for so long, told me that you had feelings for me. That's the happiest memory I can think of. It's not about a handsome young man telling me that he reciprocates my feelings, you showed me that I am worthy of love and that I am desired. That I have a reason to be here at all."
Harry kicked off the ground hard, determined to get a high vantage point to watch the game from. He sat on his Firebolt as the quaffle began racing across the field.
The gargoyle grumbled something under its breath and let the door swing open. Harry wasted no time in heading up, not wanting the Gargoyle to start yelling at him next.
"Aberforth Dumbledore, Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy, Aberforth Dumbledore," Harry introduced the two. The mention of Draco's name caused every head in the Inn to turn. Draco elbowed Harry in the gut.
Harry nodded slowly. "But why do I feel like this. The nightmares, the flashbacks, the food thing. It's not like I don't want to eat, it's that I can't."
Ron stared blankly back at him for a few seconds before squinting as if he had only just understood the words that came from Harry's mouth.
' and '
"Fine," Harry nodded. He slid his hands down Draco's torso and around his waist. It was quite satisfying for Harry to see Draco's breath hitch in the back of his throat as he did so.
They made eye contact from across the tracks and Harry brought himself and Hermione to a stop just before they would have tumbled off the platform. A train pulled into the station, blocking Draco from view. Harry felt Hermione pull him back as a crowd of people pushed passed them into the nearest carriage.
"Yeah, Harry," Anthony peered across the room. "You probably know him the most, having to hang around him all the time."
"Me and Dra- Malfoy? What exactly has Ron told you?" Harry leant against the door, his hands behind his back and unable to meet her eye.
Now everyone's eyes were on them. Draco took a seat next to Hermione before she could look up either and didn't meet her gaping expression. He looked back to Harry who was still standing, dumbfounded at the Slytherin's boldness.
"I offered to be your friend but you rejected me," Malfoy raised an eyebrow toward him.
"The Hogs Head Inn?" Draco raises an eyebrow. "I didn't even know this place was still open."
Then there was his face. Harry unconsciously drew a sharp breath when he saw it. For one thing, it was the perfect embodiment of 'vomit green', and not figuratively. His skin, only on his face and creeping down onto his neck, was vivid green. Not only that, but the left half of his face was covered in angry looking boils.
"I'm not sure about an 'O', but I think I did alright," said Harry.
"You're the one who threw it at me," Harry grumbled as he sat up, throwing Malfoy's pillow at his bed and reaching for his glasses.
"About Draco," Harry spluttered.
"Still a git," Ron grumbled. Harry thought back to that morning. He had gotten out of bed early to avoid getting changed with the other boys but Malfoy seemed to have had the same idea. They had stared at each other for a few seconds before Malfoy left for the common room, leaving Harry to sit on his bed to wait for the rest of them to wake up.
"Hang on, where are you two going?" Ron asked accusingly.
Harry forgot about school, he forgot about Malfoy, he forgot about the war, he forgot about his exams and he forgot about the whispers in his mind. The Weasleys were the family he never had.
Harry dropped the ball, bored of aimless tossing the Quaffle. It was no fun without a keeper.
"Please tell me you are going to do something with that hair?" Draco asked, snapping Harry out of his daydream.
"Go to breakfast. Eat, I know you haven't yet."
"Come on Harry," Neville called from inside the common room with Hermione at his side. "We can't start the party without our captain!"
"So what is going on with you and Malfoy?" Ron abruptly changed the subject. "You never told us what you two did on your,
"McGonagall will understand," said Harry confidently, bringing his hands down from his head, admitting defeat. "And he'll come."
Sure enough, Malfoy was curled up on a green armchair by the fire so perfectly still that he could be mistaken for being asleep.
"Way to go, Draco!" Harry laughed. Draco beamed, as in a genuine, ecstatic expression. Harry hadn't seen that in a long time.
Draco said nothing after that. Harry noticed how thin Draco really was as he rested his hand on the other boy's thigh inside the jacket. He noted how Draco was sitting so stiffly and wished he would relax into him. Harry, again, assumed it was because he was cold and decided to rest his head on Draco's shoulder and into his scarf.
Harry reached for the bowl of scrambled eggs and scooped some out onto his plate with his toast. He decided that it would probably be wise to eat something that morning despite the protest of his body.
Hermione elbowed him in the stomach, Harry agreed that he deserved it for that last comment.
"Well then, at least invite him to study with us after later," Hermione suggested. "If you are pursuing any kind of relationship with him, Ron and I need to get to know him as well."
! I won't be in Slytherin!"
"Of course not," Hermione placed an arm on Harry's bicep defensively. "I'm surprised, but I think it's cute. Right out of a romance novel."
Cheering erupted amongst the team and Ron got up on the bench, swinging his arm around his best friend's shoulders. "I want you to all keep in mind that this is Harry and I's last cup and if we don't win, we have decided upon a suicide pact because we refuse to leave losers!"
"Okay then, what about here?" Harry grabbed Malfoy by the back of the collar and pulled him into an empty classroom, slamming the door behind him.
Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated discussion about which house they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts
"Without his father to run off to, I bet he's less likely to be picking fights with anyone," Harry added halfheartedly.
Harry was used to people staring and whispering whenever he went anywhere in the wizarding world. Every year in Diagon Alley or a new batch of first years arrived Harry felt like they saw him as this amazing spectacle.
The two could have sat like this for mere seconds or even hours, time had ceased to exist in Harry's mind.
Draco smiled down at Harry who smiled back before sitting up and planting a kiss on his cheek.
"Freak out? I just found out that my best friend is snogging Draco bloody Malfoy!"
"Well, what else was I supposed to do with it?" Harry shrugged. Harry extended it toward him but Draco unexpectedly took a step back.
"In your faces!" Ron screamed as Draco tossed the twenty-fifth goal for their team through the makeshift goal that George was defending.
"Hmm?"
Harry shifted his weight uncomfortably from foot to foot. As no one spoke up to break what was becoming an increasingly awkward silence.
"How long have I been here?" Harry groaned in discomfort. The two faces of his best friends lit up as they heard his voice.
"Our bonding moment?" Draco laughed. "Have you not sat in the dark with a boy, confessing your deepest darkest secrets before, Potter?"
"Oh, so that's what you've been sulking about. Good to know," said Draco sarcastically.
"What are you thinking about?" Draco asked, rubbing his thumb over the back of Harry's hand.
He took his diploma and returned to his seat.
"Well, that's great!" Harry said with his most supportive voice while inside, he was remembering how neither of his parents could come to his graduation. "They wouldn't not let her? Would they?"
"Come on 'Mione," Ron places a hand on his girlfriend's shoulder. Ron still did not know how to dance so Hermione was teaching him before the ball tomorrow.
"And absolutely none of that," Draco said. "Who knew that the Chosen One would be so desperate for me?"
"Now, I wouldn't want you to miss the feast tonight. Why don't you go back to the common room to put your things away and go down to dinner with your friends," she smiled. Harry got to his feet and picked his bag off the floor. He thanked her for her time as he left and wandered back to the Eighth year's wing to throw his stuff on his bed and meet up with Ron and Hermione.
"Potter you are so thick! Probably not the best thing to say around you right now but it's true. Why do you think I kissed you the other week?"
Lily and Hugo laughed but Regulus and Rose looked solemn.
"Expecto Patronum!" He cried. All heads turned to him as he shouted the incantation but his iconic corporal stag did not erupt from his wand but rather a wispy string of silver light slivered from his wand tip before disappearing almost immediately leaving a cold feeling in his chest. He could not produce a Patronus, and every eye in the room was fixed on him, a tsunami of pity hit him in the chest.
"I'm not gay!" he called after her as she opened the door.
They landed softly on the grass and Harry tucked the snitch inside the pocket of his jacket. With their brooms tucked under their arms, Draco led Harry to an old tree by the stadium and sat at its roots, leaning against the sturdy trunk.
It had barely been an hour till Ron came bursting through the common room doors at full speed, looking around wildly.
Draco didn't say anything but Harry watched as his barriers drew up behind his eyes and he smirked. "You're such a dork. Obviously, I'll be your boyfriend, Potter."
"I'd rather not," Draco glanced around at all the younger Gryffindors glaring at him. "I came because I had finished breakfast and was wondering if Potter was still willing to accompany me to Hogsmeade."
Harry had a full belly as he made his way to McGonagall's office on a quite warm, Friday morning.
"He confounded me!" George claimed.
Harry hit the back of his head against the doors and shut his eyes. This is not how he wanted his secret to come out.
Creeping over to him, Harry felt very surreal. Time began to move very slowly, the length between himself and Malfoy seemed to never get any shorter. He caught himself wondering just for a moment whether it would be creepy if Harry neglected to announce his presence and remained silently watching Draco from a distance. He ultimately decided it would be so he eased himself into the burgundy armchair next to Malfoy as to not startle him.
Harry extended his arm in front of Ron's plate and picked up the glass jar slowly. He turned to George, watching him carefully as he extended the jar toward him. George smiled at Harry as he took the salt and poured it over his breakfast in alarming amounts.
Hogsmeade was as beautiful as ever. The cobbled streets and the quaint buildings with their thatched roofs never failed to put a smile on Harry's face. The four Gryffindors headed in the direction of Honeydukes to replenish their supplies of Wizarding sweets to maintain their sanity during the school year.
Harry realised he had become all too acquainted with the ceiling of the Hospital Wing.
The gentle thud of the boat hitting the far shore of the lake came all too quickly and the group of seventh and eighth years made their way up to the Hogsmeade platform.
"You can't?" Draco scoffed. "Harry Potter, I have been craving you since I was fifteen. What's worse is that I hated you at the same time and that just fuelled both emotions. You could never understand how I felt when you kissed me back that morning at breakfast. I literally felt like I was going to explode. I have done so many things to you that would warrant your hatred but here you are, my boyfriend, being my date to a ball and right now, holding me as we both try not to get too depressed."
Harry rolled his eyes before bringing his hands up to his face to hide himself, resting his elbows on the desk. "'S fine," he mumbled.
"I thought we weren't enemies anymore," Harry raised an eyebrow.
Harry watched Draco's face turn red with anger even from the other end of the corridor, yet he made no effort to grab his wand.
Hermione had joined the little family at the Burrow as her parents were still in Australia, she was going to reset their memories once they returned. Crookshanks, the notoriously intelligent cat had found its way to the burrow around January while the trio was off finding Horcruxes.
"I mean, it's not an 'O'," Malfoy pulled out his own essay which he must have received at the beginning of the lesson which did, in fact, have a green 'O' on it. "But, you exceeded even my expectations."
He pulled the heavy wooden doors open and slipped out into the hallway. Before taking a step forward he felt something hard hit his ankle and he tripped, almost landing on his face if it weren't for his fast reflexes, putting his hands out to stop his fall.
"What are you talking about?" Harry frowned.
"I hated you because you didn't want to be my friend, I hated you because you were on the Quidditch team, I hated you because everyone was so fascinated by you, I hated you because Dumbledore liked you, I hated you because you had a better broom than me, I hated you because you would never understand what it was like to be unappreciated by your own father. They were so real at the time, but no that I think on them, they're so childish."
After breakfast, Harry, Ron, and Hermione all went upstairs to Ron's room. Hermione and Ron did most of the talking, their hands intertwined and Harry could visibly see them holding back their affections for his comfort which he appreciated but he still felt like a third wheel. His own girlfriend was somewhere in the house, but the two had talked sparingly since the battle, Harry finding her caring blue eyes to painful to bear, and her comforting words too sickly sweet to be deserved.
"So, are you going to tell me or no?"
"You have called me Harry before," he reminded him.
"Okay, that's it, goodbye," Draco said very quickly before turning on his heel.
"Oh, that isn't new. If I recall, this is your handiwork, Potter," Draco said flatly without looking at him. A weight sat heavy in the pit of Harry's stomach as Malfoy felt out his shirt as to make sure he put the right button in each hole.
"You should try growing it out," Draco suggested in a distracted tone, his eyes on Harry's bird's nest of hair.
The Burrow was more of a home to Harry than the Dursley's had ever been. It's whimsical quirks never failed to make Harry smile, no matter his mood. The sweet smell of gingerbread enticed Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny to the kitchen where Mrs Weasley was waving her wand around the cozy kitchen, silently casting an array of household spells.
"Do you reckon he's a homo?"
Harry could tell that Ron was still not so eager to be friendly with Malfoy. The two of them walked with six feet of space between them, Harry in the middle. He rolled his eyes with a smile at their antics. His best friend and his, well, Harry wasn't sure what to call Draco and himself.
"That's not what this says," Draco tapped two fingers against his sleeve where underneath sat the Dark Mark.
He had not dared to even think about his Patronus since the first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson of the year. The memory swept waves of embarrassment and disappointment over him.
"Outstanding in Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts and Transfiguration. Exceeds Expectations in Herbology and Potions."
"Hey!" Harry frowned. "I'm trying."
"Ron don't be ridiculous," Hermione interrupted Harry. "He has to spend time with him for his tutoring and being friendly isn't a bad thing."
"Fair enough," Draco returned to what he was writing.
"Yes, and would either of you like to fill me in on why? I'm sure your excuse will be thrilling."
He was not expecting halfway through the school year, however. Even students in sixth and seventh years were joining in the unsure stares and hushed gossip which made Harry incredibly uncomfortable.
Behind Mr and Mrs Weasley, the rest of the Weasley children looked up around the hall reminiscently, clearly remembering their time here or perhaps their own graduations.
"I'm glad to see your grades are beginning to resemble those of your sixth year, I know you can put in that little extra effort, however."
"Harry." He looked up when the Professor used his first name. "There is no reason for you to feel guilty about it."
Harry was used to seeing Draco in all black but there was something about the outfit that made him look especially beautiful. Their robes did in fact match except that they were the inverse colours to each other. While Harry's shirt and tie were stark white, Draco's were pitch black. Harry could already imagine how Draco would look in his black ensemble with the white and gold jacket that reached his ankles.
He was atop the Astronomy tower, frozen and unable to help as he watched Snape cast the killing curse that sent Dumbledore to his grave.
As Harry slowly made his way to the grass he swore he spotted a single tear run down Ron's freckled cheek as he threw his arm around his best friend.
"What makes you say that?" Asked Harry defensively.
Harry sat down for breakfast in the Great Hall next to Ron.
"Funny that."
"We'll find them," said Draco reassuringly.
"Patronus theory."
"I tried to tell him not to go," Dennis said quietly. "He told Mum he was going to one of our muggle friend's houses but he told me what was happening here and that he was going to fight. He showed me the Galleon, the one from the DA. I had lost mine. He said he'd be back before Mum and Dad found out," he wiped his face on his sleeve, determined not to cry.
Harry turned on his heel, facing away from Draco, raising his wand in the air. He just wanted to get this over and done with. To prove to that git that he was wrong.
"Potter, have you decided whether you will be returning to Mr and Mrs Weasley's home for Christmas yet?" McGonagall asked.
"Draco!" Harry hissed.
"I guess that's this year's defence teacher," Hermione tried to get Ron to stop eating for a few seconds to see her.
"There's quite a few of them this year," Hermione observed as they headed toward the carriages with the other students.
"I know you're upset," she said slowly. "After what you had to go through, I'd be more concerned if you weren't," Harry said nothing, but simply sighed and looks down at his feet as he kicked a loose stone across the floor. "Look, if you need anything, to talk, please tell someone," she reasoned. Harry took a deep breath and shruged. Professor Dellow left it at that, whisking back into the classroom leaving Harry alone in the hall. He checked his watch and saw there are only a few minutes till the bell in the clock tower would ring to sound the start of lunch. He grabbed his bag from the back of the classroom and began to walk toward the Headmistress' office.
"If it wasn't for my 'help' you'd be you wouldn't be here with your full course meals and your comfy bed. You'd be in Azkaban with dear old daddy-"
The initial shock of Malfoy's sudden appearance seemed to wear off after several minutes. Usual conversation resumed and Harry began to dig into his dinner. He kept glancing at Malfoy, attempting to decipher his body language in order to discern whether he was okay.
"Come on," Draco stood up. "Come dance with me."
"Potter?"
"Okay, but you need to shower," Draco shoved Harry off him and stood up, offering his hands for Harry to pull himself up. They both walked in the direction of the eighth year bathrooms.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down at a desk in the common room during their Care of Magical Creatures free period. Harry was in no mood to study, he barely listened as Hermione explained what they were planning to do in their free hour.
He mounted his broom and hovered a few meters off the ground, flying around lazily.
Harry slowly raised his left hand to Draco's shoulder and twisted his right hand around Draco's hand.
When recounting his visit to McGonagall's office at lunch that day, Harry neglected to tell Ron and Hermione about Malfoy. Focusing on his captaincy of the Quidditch team, he told them about the new broom he was promised.
"No, of course not," Harry mumbled, looking down at the floor and shuffling his foot awkwardly.
"I wouldn't mind some Butterbeer right now," said Harry as he walked side by side with Draco Malfoy down the Main Street of Hogsmeade.
Even Fred caught up with them and began discussing Jimmy and Ritchie's form as beaters from what he observed from the castle windows.
"What do mean?" Harry frowned.
"What makes you say that?" Ron frowned. "You're joking right?"
Snape looked much better than the last time he had seen Harry. His face was clear of dirt and his hair, while still incredible greasy, was brushed. Harry didn't know what to make of the old Potion's master. After years of hatred, the man had gained a little of Harry's respect when he discovered the truth behind his past, perhaps not enough to completely resolve him of his actions; Harry could never forgive how he treated Hermione and Neville.
Harry felt the familiar rush of adrenaline racing through his body as he prepared to kick off the ground and into the air. His grip tightened around the handle and with the Quaffle tucked under his arm he kicked hard into the ground and sent himself upwards at amazing speed.
Draco let out a high laugh. "I'm not telling you for anything."
"We've been testing each other on stuff from as far back as first year," said Ron. "It makes me kinda wish I had paid more attention, anything from third year and before I have no memory of!"
It was all his fault, if it wasn't for him, so many people would still be alive right now, his own parents included. It wasn't fair that Harry had come out the other side of the war, when so many better witches and wizards did not.
Harry pouted and shoved his hands into the pockets of his robes before making his way down to the Great Hall.
The new Headmaster of Durmstrang was a man of few words, and it seemed so were his students. A mere handshake and a murmur of condolences and congratulations were all he received from them.
"I'm glad we've only got Debbie Downer tonight," Justin said as Harry peered into the box to attempt to suss out the least risky bean.
"Potter, I thought I didn't see you at dinner," McGonagall peered at him curiously over her thin glasses.
"Then it's settled," she pulled her hands away from Harry and stood up, only reaching Harry's nose. "As long as you weren't in the closet for our relationship and you didn't break up with me for him, I have no problem with it. Go and be gay, whatever you want."
"Hannah Abbott in second year," he replied casually.
It was clear that Hermione was mostly angry at him for abandoning their free period of study. When Ron had dragged him by the back of his robes all the way to the Eighth Year common room she had lectured him about the importance of their N.E.W.Ts and how abandoning his friends was a dick move. Harry had listened to her words his head hung low. Ron, who was standing beside her, was intent to make this all about Malfoy. He yelled at him, exclaiming that the Serpent was getting inside his head, feigning the act of the innocent before taking advantage of Harry.
"I thought we'd gotten past this?" Harry rolled his eyes. "What happened to our bonding moment?"
Harry crumpled the piece of parchment in his hand. It only took Harry a second to realise what he had to do. First thing's first, he had to talk to George.
Basically, Harry had a freaky ass nightmare about Voldy and Draco was there. He woke up and found Draco in the common room being a tad emo in front of the fire. They talk about life and Draco reluctantly shows him his self harm after his sleeve falls a little and Harry sees a little bit of it. Harry does try to comfort him but Draco is like 'yeah right'
"Did he? Wait, I don't want to know," Ron shook his head. "But just know that I'm still annoyed you're ditching us for him."
Harry rolled onto his side to face Malfoy who seemed to still be sleeping peacefully. Draco had never looked so worry free. His face was not scrunched in disgust or furrowed in anger.
He had not been holding onto his broom and felt himself topple backward, unable to hinder his fall.
Harry frowned in confusion.
"Looking forward to it," Harry grumbled.
"Fair shout," Ron rolled his eyes. "Come on, Boot's going to notice that we've stolen his stuff," he said, referring to the blue and bronze tie he had tied around his head.
"Ow!" Malfoy grabbed the ball out of the air angrily. "Depulso!"
It wasn't just Ginny who had heard the rumour of a special notice. The entire hall was buzzing with speculation as to what it could be.
"I'm going to go find him before he does anything stupid." Harry took his own coat and sneakers and left Ron alone.
"I don't need an apology, I was already awake," said Draco, leaning back on one of the poles of Harry's bed cautiously.
Harry was sure his cheeks were bright red and for a moment, he smiled.
"What happened to you?" Harry asked again, this time he was not going to let him avoid the question.
Neither of them said anything, sitting inches apart and both staring into the middle distance.
"Mr's Malfoy and Weasley and well and Miss's Granger and Weasley, as well as a number of other students, have informed me of your current state. We're worried about you."
"I need you to promise," said Ron darkly.
Draco began moving and Harry struggled to keep up. He was constantly looking down at his feet, unable to grasp the pattern that they made.
"He has not yet been informed but he too has no choice either," she reached over to a scroll of parchment to begin writing something down. "The war has been won and Malfoy has chosen his side. I suggest you remind yourself that is the same as yours. You're excused."
No one said anything. Harry looked between both Ron and Draco who were both breathing heavily and glaring at each other.
"Does taking pride in your appearance make you gay?"
"You have no proof," Draco shrugged. "And besides, isn't it endearing?"
"You know how we said that this, whatever we're doing, was just 'testing the waters'?" Harry paused, waiting for Draco to respond but he only nodded. "I think... I think that I want something more than that."
"Your
Harry suddenly felt as if there was a weight in his gut. Somewhere below his intestines was a feeling that made him feel both hot and cold at the same time. His brain was running in overdrive; telling him to be closer to Malfoy at the same time as running far, far away. He twisted his wand in his right hand as it was the only part of his body that felt safe to move.
"Well, without getting uncomfortably sappy," Draco sighed, glancing towards the eavesdropping ghost for a second. "It's not really the victors I came to see. Just you."
The group peered around at two tables where the special guests were sat, attempting to suss out who was in attendance. Harry could see Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister for Magic sitting with several other ministry wizards and witches. A surprising guest was Madame Maxime with two older looking students to her left, perhaps Beauxbatons' head boy and girl. The recognisable uniforms of Durmstrang also caught his eye, next to a very grumpy looking man in his late thirties who Harry assumed was their new headmaster. There were another two guests in complementing blue and deep red uniforms that Harry did not recognise next to a very old looking witch.
"Yeah, sure," Harry scoffed as the two of them descended together.
"You can stop staring, Potter, it's unsettling," said Draco flatly. Harry blushed lightly in embarrassment.
"For Merlin's sake!" Draco slammed his hands down on the bench. Harry glanced up from the potion to look around the room. The few heads that did turn in their direction quickly returned to their own potions. "Can you please talk to me?"
"We wrote to James three times a week last year," said Draco.
"No, he's not," Harry looked back to Malfoy who was clearly very uncomfortable with the ghost's judgement. "What are you doing here?"
They both looked to the overexcited owl in its cage across the room before looking back to each other.
Harry dragged himself to the ensuite bathroom, forcing himself not to think about the gruesome images that his brain had conjured. He saw himself in the mirror and sighed at his complexion. He pushed his hair back off his forehead and peered at the thin lightning bolt scar as if he was expecting it to be different. It had not pained him in exactly a year but he couldn't help but trace a finger down the mark.
In the past week, since they had returned, Draco and Harry had shared many encounters that he couldn't describe in any other fashion than flirtatious.
you looking at?"
Harry stared at him uncertainly for a while, he couldn't recognise the boy until he turned to him with a signature smile that twisted his gut.
"It's alright, Potter," Professor Dellow placed a hand on his shoulder, he didn't react. He simply stared into the middle distance ahead of him. "Come with me, the rest of you, continuing practising, uh, stuff. Don't break anything!" She ushered Harry into the hallway who still stared blankly at the wall.
"I'm sorry about Ron," said Harry in a quiet voice. "He just needs some time to come around to you."
"What she want you for?" Ron tried to catch some of the crumbs running down his robes. Harry shrugged his shoulders. His mind travelled back to last night and he prayed right then and there she wasn't going to pry him about his absence from dinner the previous evening.
Harry and Ron groaned. This was hell on Earth.
"How could you?" Ron whispered to Harry, he laughed.
The two figures stopped and descended in front of the team. The Harry's stomach plummeted when he saw that the intruders were Draco and Chloe Park, Slytherin's official and reserve seekers.
"Potter, you disgust me with your allegations," said Draco as he rolled his eyes.
"Fine," Harry mumbled, flying away from Ron and toward Dennis. "I didn't know you could fly."
"We've just got to find it," Hermione mumbled to herself. "Ron, could you put a pause on your bacon and help me?"
"I'm not gay," Harry said, looking around the room anxiously, scared that they were attracting attention. "I know I liked Cho and Ginny. This is a one-off thing."
Harry walked to the Owlery alone. Every step he took reminded him of Hedwig, the owl he had formed a deep bond with before she became but another casualty in his war. The dark clouds had returned to the sky and promised rain, perhaps even snow, in the near future.
Harry dodged his way out of the thick of the game and into an open area of air above the Gryffindor goals where just below Ron was cursing at the Hufflepuffs animatedly.
Harry saw Ron stare daggers at the Ravenclaw across the room at the mention of Harry and Malfoy getting along.
Draco kissed Regulus goodbye.
Harry grabbed his white shirt from the pile on his bed, tapping his wand to it lightly in order to remove the creases. He slipped his arms through the light material and checked in the mirror on the wall beside his bed that he was buttoning it right
"Thank you," Harry attempted a smile, it didn't work.
"Even I think a break would be good for us," Hermione raised an eyebrow. "Why don't you want to go?"
Harry had still not spoken to George after nearly a week after returning to the Burrow. He had avoided both the Weasley twins, the living and the ghost, for so long that the idea of talking to George made him feel sick to the stomach. It was the same feeling he got when he had to speak to Dennis during Quidditch practice or a game. Perhaps he had been forced to get used to speaking with Dennis, he didn't freeze up or feel the need to vomit anymore but every encounter left him with a shaky and hollow feeling. But Harry was too stubborn to see the logic in forcing himself to speak to George, so he didn't.
"That was the point!" he lay his head back against the tall armchair. "All disturbance to that skin, it just heals himself, even with Him dead."
Neither of them said anything more for a while. Harry even felt himself slipping back into unconsciousness.
"You do remember that we were titchy first years, right?" Harry raised an eyebrow at his best friend.
The whole room had quietened to watch Malfoy's outburst. Harry sat in stunned silence and stared at Draco's face reddened with madness, his hands curled into fists at his side.
Harry found it hard to answer. The answer, of course, was yes but he felt stupid to say that out loud. If he had just died or handed himself over to die sooner, Lupin and Tonks would be raising Teddy, Colin Creevey would be studying for his N.E.W.Ts and Fred Weasley wouldn't just be a trapped soul and would be running his joke shop with his twin brother. So many others wouldn't have had to lose their lives protecting him. Even his own parents died for his life, wasn't that enough?
"Uh, yeah. Can I borrow Athena?"
"Oh, that's marvellous!" Hermione exclaims from across the table. Harry looked up at the staff table where he spotted Professor McGonagall in the middle, smiling at him kindly.
Harry rolled over to his other side where he reached down to grab his watch which lay on to of his sneakers on the floor.
Madame Hooch disbanded the Gryffindor's party at 9:30 sharp, ordering everybody to get ready for bed.
"Okay, well I feel exceptionally thirsty, and I will order two Butterbeers," said Harry. "Please."
"You're hopeless, you know that," Draco groaned.
The doors flew open and each team member scrambled for their brooms. In a triangle formation, they flew onto the pitch to the sound of cheers from the half of the stands dressed in red and gold.
"What are you talking about?"
," Ron whispered the last word.
"I cannot believe we have to convince her to come to our games," Harry laughed. "And you wanted to come anyway, it's Quidditch! It doesn't matter who's playing."
"Can you just be a grown-up about this?" Hermione chastised as Harry finished placing his Standard Book of Spells Grade Seven into his bag.
"It's a figure of speech," Malfoy grumbled, placing his left elbow on the arm of his chair and resting his head on his fist.
"So, you'll agree to be tutored by him... civilly?" McGonagall asked seriously.
"Okay, mate," Ron laughed. "Focus."
Harry played dumb and simply nodded, it was Ron that needed to start the conversation, not him. He was the one who couldn't get over one tiny thing.
"Petty?" Harry exclaimed, getting to his feet. "From the start, all he ever wanted to do is ruin me! And let's not forget how he let Death Eaters into the school and you know, was good buddies with our old pal Voldemort!"
"No I didn't," said Hermione. "I had complete faith in you."
But no matter how many times his brain thought about the consequences, Harry's feet would not halt their pre-determined route to the Quidditch pitch. Or was it their will to follow Malfoy?
Exchanging the letter for his gloves, Harry scanned the garden and found George easily enough. He wore a long brown coat with golden dragon hide boots that disappeared into the white snow.
"Those are words I never thought would come out of your mouth," Draco huffed.
In a world of powerlessness, what he ate was one of the only things he could control. The hypnotic ache of hunger had also become rewarding to him, a punishment for being for being alive, taking up space in the world where so many people who had given there lives to him should be.
Harry decided the best way to relax after the stressful, revision filled day was too take Ron down to the Quidditch pitch and have some 'bro time' as Hermione called it.
"Maybe if I didn't have to wait for you to get off the ground, we could have left earlier," Harry teased. Malfoy glared at him as he flicked his wand to lock the shed.
"That's all very well but I had someone else in mind," she informed him. Harry frowned. "As a senior member of the school I want you to set an example for the younger years in my efforts to break down these silly boundaries between our houses."
"Oh no, dear," Mrs Weasley took the dirty plate out of Malfoy's hands. "You go upstairs with Harry now and put your stuff down."
Draco said that he had a cold and requested that they hold their potions tutorial in the dorm room.
There were a few other students who had taken the day to sit outside. Clumps of students talking, studying, and enjoying the air dotted the lawn. However, none of them were in earshot of the odd pair.

Ginny and Ron performed brilliantly as always. Demelza Robins was adamant that she resumed her position as a chaser as well. Jimmy Peakes and Richie Coote both gained their old positions on the team as beaters as well. Harry only became uneasy when the tryouts had been on for nearly an hour and he couldn't find a suitable player to fill the final spot on his team.
