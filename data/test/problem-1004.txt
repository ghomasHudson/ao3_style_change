Harry felt his shoulders tighten, his hands curling in his lap where they'd fallen. Draco's words were true, and they weren't necessarily accusing or fierce, but they felt like an accusation nonetheless. An accusation of a wrongdoing.
"… why, why won't it work? What is it, what is it that isn't… why won't it -?" Bellatrix jerked to a stop. She spun towards Harry once more and he flinched as she snapped a harsh, "why won't it work? What did you do?"
Dark corridors. Gloomily lit rooms hazy with smoke. A display with a stage, curtains drawn and clutters of chairs seated at round tables as though awaiting a performance. There was a room with pictures along the walls, plaques of brass with their own calligraphic print, and illustrations upon that same vintage canvas hanging from the walls, brought to life by the ambient glow.
The boy looked around until he saw him. They looked at each other eyes and there was a hint of familiarity between how draco looked at him. He was smiling as he walked towards his table then sat to an empty chair next to him.
He was quite shy back then and was unable to confess his feeling for her. It hurt him when his crush finally went out with that boy.
The next day, he felt his migraine getting a bit worse but he shrugged off. He went inside the room the first subject was calculus and he sat to his seat next to Draco who was sitting there writing something on his notebook.
It was evening and Ron was knocking on his door. He lazily opened it to reveal Ron and Hermione; immediately he closed the door and wore a shirt then opened it again. Hermione had a faint blush while ron was just laughing at him.
“So, you like to walk around?” Draco asks “it’s nice but quite dangerous, you know? This town has robbers and I’m again concerned for you.”
I haven’t updated for weeks because I didn’t expect those weeks to be filled with surprise quizzes and projects. Being a uni student sucks jdjsjs but yes I’m back ! But not really I’m just taking a break today cause BDAY but I still have tons to do D:
The handsome person in front of him was looking curiously at his hand then looked up and met his eyes. He gave him a small shy smile knowing that he has been caught by his act.
“I recently got my license.” Harry shrugged “and I asked- no I didn’t ask my mom. I just directly rented a car which is parked nearby our building.”
At the corner, Draco was talking with a brunette girl who seemed to enjoy to whatever they were talking. Harry felt a bit jealous but he had no right to be. He clenched his jaw and finished his whiskey making his throat burn.
They didn’t get the opportunity to hang out afterwards due to Harry having to go back home because of his mother. Leaving, Draco very frustrated about the day and he did felt the same.
“Alright, dear.” Draco stopped laughing and went to the small kitchen then opened his refrigerator. He went with him and open a drawer and swallowed a pill hoping it could numb his migraine.
The alcohol totally effected them, Harry wasn’t that drunk he felt a bit dizzy though. It has been months since he had drunk spirits and his tolerance weakened.
“You did a pretty good job cleaning up your loft.” Draco pointed at the hoodie he threw on the couch.
“Fine.” Harry slowly went out from bed and decided to hug Draco from behind, kissing his neck. “I like this.”
After a few more minutes, the traffic light finally turned green and so he drove carefully towards Malfoy’s house. When he arrived, his jaw dropped. The house was massive it looked more like a manor rather than a normal house. It had a similarity to his father’s house which made him thinking maybe they had the same architect designing their houses.
“Whatever you say, Potter.” Draco says and skipped his way through the pedestrian lane. Harry almost panicked but he ran after him.
“How about you two will play organize this thing.” Hermione announces “so end of the discussion. Now, can we buy snacks? I’m starving.”
“Hey guys!” Mione greets them alongside her was Draco who was awkwardly looking at Ron instead of Harry.
“Are you sure?” He ask again “Is your migraine getting worse? I can tell our teacher about that if that’s if you wanna go home.”
“I don’t plan on telling my parents.” She says avoiding the first question “ and it’s too late if I told him, he’d never love me the same.. he’d be forced to because of our baby.”
Harry was driving his car when the traffic lights went red. So he decided to text his Draco to remind him that he was already nearby.
“Oh, look it’s Harry’s friend going to Blaise.” Ron told them which made Harry looked way too quickly that it hurt his neck.
“He’s a pretty decent guy.” Luna comments “he was my lab partner once and he literally knew everything, I think I passed chemistry because of him.”
“Multiple places.” Harry smiles, he had decided to not go with the usual cliche date in a restaurant. It wouldn’t totally impress Draco “it’d be fun.”
When he arrived, he was greeted by his mom who was cleaning his kitchen. Harry assumes she had bought him groceries enough to last him until holidays.
“Shush.” Draco continues “it’s gross I know but she was telling you that because you look pretty hot tonight and she would love to fuck you, Harry.”
“Don’t you want to let them know that we love each other?” Cedric looked like he was about to cry. They were at walking at the sidewalk going to their favorite ice cream shop.
Harry looked down at his hands hesitating if he should take Draco’s. Maybe, later. He looked up and still his person was still studying the map provided by the Zoo.
Ron who was beside him laughing while Hermione just smacked his side which stopped him from laughing.
When Draco's face appeared almost immediately, the relief that washed over Harry almost overwhelmed his anger. He grasped the mirror with both hands and sunk his teeth into his lip to stop it from trembling. Draco looked no less pale than he had been when Harry last saw him, but at least the horror was alleviated. He looked just a little more like himself, and Harry needed that right now.
"As eloquent as ever," Draco whispered at Harry's side, so quiet that Harry was likely the only one who heard him.
James didn't look convinced, appeared perhaps even slightly more uneasy with the suggestion, but Lily regarded Draco with attention previously reserved only for Harry. She slowly inclined her head. "I'd appreciate it if you would, Draco."
Harry had turned to Ginny with a blank stare where she'd been sitting at his side, leg slung casually over the arm of his couch and all but sprawled in her stretch across the cushions between them. She grinned at him upside-down, a grin by no means lessened for being the wrong way around.
"Are you kidding me?" Ginny said as she slung her arm around Harry in return. "I'm having a blast. This is so weird, but kind of fun too, you know?"
Draco's lips. His tongue. The smooth lines of his cheek as Harry chased the mess he'd made on his face, streaking it with kisses. He locked his fingers into Draco's hair, around his head, drawing him closer as he sank back into the wall, and for a moment he couldn't care less that there were hundreds of people who could be watching. Hundreds who could see, could judge, could scowl at them or fling slurs. In Diagon Alley, in the Wizarding world already so surreal and magical, it didn't seem much of a stretch to manage this kind of miracle, too.
Still, when he and Draco stepped into the crowded corridor amongst squishing and fleeing students, and when Draco tapped his elbow to gain his attention and draw him to the side, Harry stopped. He would have stopped even if the crowds around him had insisted on dragging him away with them with the force of mob mentality.
Malfoy didn't sneer at Ron, or look down his nose at Hermione with mutters of "Mudblood" slipping through his twisted lips whenever they were close enough for her to hear. He didn't hold his head high with his old aloof arrogance, and Harry had noticed a distinct lack of peacock-strutting of late. Granted, being accused of standing on the wrong side of the war, not to mention losing both his parents to incarceration in quick succession, had to have a significant impact on anyone, but… still. Harry hadn't expected it. Not really.
Harry shrugged. "Why not? And if you say anything about old school rivalries, I'm going to have to hex you."
That unexpected guilt, the same guilt that had been sitting with Harry for weeks since Draco had caught him and Sammy in the club, had his shoulders drawing compulsively to his ears. Fingernails biting into his palms, Harry swallowed down every excuse that arose.
curious of your magic. Especially curious, in fact, and not prejudiced, as you similarly seem to misguidedly believe. If anything, your disappearing handkerchief last week has only made me all the more so."
Harry waited. And waited. And waited. Next to the door, Von settled against the wall, folded his arms, and similarly stood in silent wait. As the pause extended with only the sound of riffled papers for disruption, Dot maintained her silence. That in itself was almost concerning; she was rarely silent without reason.
She was talking herself down, Harry knew. Blaise would love to hear her; he knew that, too, and mostly because it would be Jill playing rather than because of her objective talent. There was more going on there than was openly admitted, something that was a little bit sweet and a little bit wonderful, the same but different to the sharp, almost vicious something between Jackie and Pansy and yet reminiscent of it, too.
"What?" Harry asked, peering at where Blaise, leading the line, had drawn a small pouch from his pocket and begun extracting coins. "Wait, are those -?"
Harry bit his lip, stifling the urge to ask. Did he want to know what was so bad to warrant such conviction? Did he want to know what was 'coming to her'? No. Probably not. Definitely not if the thought could have Draco's chin trembling so slightly it was barely visible, his gaze locked and face as pale as a ghost. Regardless of whether he believed his aunt deserved her fate, it must be painful to consider. It would be a horror to watch even people Harry cared nothing for to be brutally punished.
"And risk being eaten by that bear you call a dog?' Jackie grinned despite his words. It was no secret she was at least as smitten with PJ as he was with her. "Nah, I'm gonna head home, then. I have a date with procrastination."
, he thought, just as he had the last time he'd convinced her that 'no, going to the bathroom within half an hour of eating doesn't mean I'm throwing up in the toilet'. He was thankful he'd managed that much, at least; Ron hadn't looked any more pleased at Hermione's demand that he accompany him than Harry had been, if for somewhat different reasons.
"I'm not a fan of the juvenile connotations accompanying the term 'boyfriend'," Remus said, barely a murmur.
Draco whipped his attention towards Pansy as she drew along his other side and couldn't help but glare at the smugness playing across her face. The evening he'd met her she'd led him to believe that she didn't associate with Muggles, even in her career. In spite of Muggle technology, photography, and cinematography, she'd seemed positively derisive. But now…
"Used to?" Draco echoed quietly. Harry's glance towards him found Draco peering at him sidelong. This time, Harry didn't bother to attempt to supress the warmth in his cheeks. There was no point in trying. What was there to do when Draco looked at him like he was something special?
He couldn't quite raise his gaze from their intertwined fingers, but it didn't matter, because the gentle squeeze of Draco's hand, the brush of his lips as they passed briefly over Harry's forehead, spoke for him. The comfort of than handhold for the rest of their short walk to the car made up for any words that went unsaid.
"To Dot's?" Draco said as they turned a final corner to a street as identical to those around it as any other.
"There has to be a reason," Draco said. "There must be. With you, and who you are, who your family is – there must have been some reason."
-ed shut. Harry started, wrenched from his thoughts, and glanced up to see Hermione slump back in her seat, rubbing her eyes. At her side, Ron sprawled across the table with heavy-lidded eyes but his quill still clutched in his hand. Last-minute cramming had always been his and Harry's style, but there was a distinct flavour of urgency to Ron's commitment that hadn't been there before. Whether it was driven by Hermione's influence – or Ron's enhanced consideration for Hermione's influence – or a real fear for the future, Harry didn't know. He supposed it didn't really matter. Ron still mentioned his intentions for entering the aurorship program, and for all Harry knew he was more than capable of pursuing that path.
Swallowing thickly, Harry deliberately dragged his attention back to Jackie. "You're really prepared for the drive down to London?" he asked. "That's a bit of a trip."
Because he was. He was Draco's boyfriend, and Draco was his. Harry had decided he didn't care who in the world knew it because so long as Draco was okay with it, he'd readily shout it to the world just to revel in the truth of it. If nothing else, the past week had ground decisiveness into him.
Jogging down the street with a repressed urge to sprint, he offered a smile and a nod to McGonagall at the head of the procession, stalking through in her thick, heavy skirts. "Good morning, Professor," he said. "I hope you had a nice Christmas."
The first time they'd met, he'd rubbed Harry the wrong way. A prejudiced, spoilt prat, he wasn't the sort of person that Harry would ever want for a friend, even as friendless as he was. When they'd met on the train a month later, the impression hadn't been any better; between Draco's blatant arrogance and entitlement and Ron's equally blatant aversion to 'Malfoy', it hadn't been difficult to view Draco in a less than favourable light.
Draco snorted, dissolving into unrestrained snickers at her words, and Harry wasn't far behind him. "Really, Dot? How could I not?" At Dot's flat glance, he grinned even wider and stepped through the doorway. "Good luck with everything."
Clubs weren't Draco's scene. He didn't like a single part of them. Maybe it was because of his more refined tastes, his upbringing that demanded 'proper' partying, but he didn't like the heaving, thumping music that beat through the soles of his feet as much as his eardrums. He didn't like the shadows that revealed as much as they hid, the flashing lights that assaulted his eyes, the struggle to hold a decent conversation.
The woman was absolutely, gloriously stunning. Through the eye of a viewfinder, she was even more so.
"Really?" Jackie arched an eyebrow and produced a key and stunted chain with a flourish, holding it aloft. "Not even if I give you this."
"Our school library's shit, so we're going to have to head over to the city library, I think," she said.
Harry thought as he passed into the hollow depths of the library that resounded with echoes of silence,
"Then there is someone?" Harry didn't so much as grunt in reply, but Ron seemed to take his silence as an affirmative. "You know, I actually thought it might be. I asked Hermione –"
Losing himself in thought, then not even in thought but mindlessness, before jerking back into awareness as though abruptly woken from sleep. Caught in the midst of memories that, when shaken from them, he couldn't even recall the nature of except that they felt 'bad' and 'sad' and 'cold'. That when he was shaken from them, he often found himself flinching, tensing, drawing away from barely touching hands and curious gazes before he could help himself.
Also, references to character promiscuity plays a pretty strong part in this chapter in particular. It's not necessarily long-standing and persistent throughout the entire fic, but just be aware if this makes you uncomfortable.
"It's even easier than toast –" Harry paused, then waved his pen at her again. "Actually, scratch that. You always burn your toast, too."
The shopping centre wasn't anything remarkable, except for being remarkably Muggle. Multiple floors, linoleum polished in a way that only seemed to emphasise the tiny scratches and scores from too many footsteps, and shops with their shutters still closed with barely a one hosting workers arrived earlier than they should have to prepare for opening. Draco squinted briefly at a distant figure that looked like a security guard, cursing his ridiculous need to wear sunglasses indoors, before hastening down the frozen escalators in the direction he knew from past experience hosted a modestly-sized Tesco.
Harry tucked his chin but didn't think it did much to hide his smile. Draco had been defiant his whole life; it was just that his defiance had been forced to bend before it broke when the world and everyone in it turned against him. That didn't mean it had disappeared. Not in the least. Rather, Harry thought it more appropriate to consider that it had been biding its time for the right moment to rear its head once more.
Harry bit back a sigh. Whatever had existed between himself and Ginny had passed. It was too confusing, maybe too soon or too late, to decide if he was saddened by it, but that fact was blatantly apparent. He still loved her, and he knew she still cared for him, but more than that? Some things it seemed simply didn't seem capable of surviving the war. Some loves. Some hatreds, too.
A heavy sigh flushed from Harry's nose, almost as loud as Ron's snores, as Seamus' sleep-addled muttering across the room. The dormitory was stuffed full of boys, more than any other tower or House dormitory, but somehow it felt so distant and empty when each of its occupants were lost in sleep.
Draco shifted slightly in his seat, but when Harry glanced towards him, his face was as blank as he'd held it before. "You're apologising."
Draco didn't meet her attentive gaze. Instead, he drew his own from his plate towards Harry once more. "Somewhat, yes," he said.
"You're whipping a dead horse, Pansy. Sorry. If I did, I'm sure some news headliner would have already written about it."
"What are you apologising for?" Draco asked, voice soft with an understanding that, when he'd first met him, Harry would never have thought possible of him. "Is something wrong? You've been uncomfortable ever since we stepped into the room. I can move to the other bed if you want me to."
Harry knew the techniques. He knew the prodding questions and had learnt how to peer beneath their superficiality to spy the booby traps hidden beneath, planted to trip his tongue into revealing more of himself than he'd ever wanted to share. He knew the habit of maintaining eye contact, of an unwavering smile, of body language – leaning forwards, copying gestures, the deliberate twitch of facial features – and he'd come to recognise more than a few in an instant of their flickering existence. It was necessary, just as it was necessary to dodge around the silent questions as often as the blatant ones.
Madame Clementine's studio building perched atop a cliff of sorts. A cliff that overlooked not only the huddled little city of Lucerne in all of its picturesque glory but also the sprawling expanse of the lake it sat alongside. That lake, wide and so dark and deep that it could have been a reflection of the night sky Draco had glimpsed that morning, had become a golden mirror of the rising sun in breath-taking glory. The haphazard ring of mountains surrounding it, the green hills interspersed and speckled with distant, winding roads that traipsed across their splendour and all upon a backdrop of orange, pink, and pale blue – it was stunning.
"As it happens," Draco continued further, "I have something of an interest in this project you have proposed, and shall endeavour to participate in pursuing it."
Harry liked Ron, liked Hermione, and hadn't an opinion about the rest of them, but the laxness was almost concerning. How, exactly, had witches and wizards stayed a secret for so long when they pulled shit like that out in the open? An oblivious penguin-huddle of bodies was far from sufficient protection if those making up the huddle didn't have a little bit of self-awareness.
And that was to say nothing of the job. Regardless of what the public might think of him, the job as Harry Potter's photographer for his official interviews, the interviews that he'd actually agreed to and even actively pursued himself, was sure to garner him attention. Even if not in the Wizarding world, it would put his name out amidst the Muggles. It was worth it, even if it meant weathering the death threats for a time.
A smile touched the corner of Harry's lips, niggling slightly but failing to manage more than that. He hitched a shoulder in a shrug. "I don't even know."
"Okay, Professor Lupin," Harry said, sighing long-sufferingly, "I know that you've got a thing for education and everything, but can you keep it at work please?"
"- but still." Harry folded his arms back across his chest, momentarily tensing at Draco's words with the expectation of being flipped onto the floor. When Draco didn't move, he peered up at him warily. "It's weirdly comfortable. To me."
"It's just a health concern," Hermione said, abandoning her bread for her soup spoon. "But I'm sure Dot makes you go and see the doctor regularly, right?"
Striding into the dining room, Harry leant over his father's shoulder and swiped a hot chip from his plate.
And yet it was all superficial. It was all seeing, and touching, and sex. Harry liked sex, liked it a lot, for that matter, and the urge to pursue the mindlessness of easy pleasure was sometimes a necessary balm to soothe what was otherwise an incomprehensible itch. But Harry wasn't so blind to pleasure to know that it wasn't enough. Not for him.
"I'm working," Jackie said, turning a page in her own book. "What I'm looking up is relevant too because – oh my god, look at that? That's disgustingly wonderful."
Harry was cupping Draco's face in his hands and kissing him before he'd made the conscious decision to do so. Eyes closed, blotting out the world and any eyes or ears or thoughts, he swept aside anything and everything that wasn't Draco and felt him. Just
"Um," he began again. "This is, um…" Why couldn't he find the words? It wasn't like James didn't already know. That he'd been caught, however, and at such a moment, scrambled Harry's brains into an egg-like mash. "This – this is –"
"No problem. Hey, you rode your bike to work today, right? How about I swing by and pick it up? I mean, I'm not driving that thing 'cause I actually want to live to see tomorrow morning, but I could Apparate it home if you'd like? If you drive from my place the traffic isn't too bad and…"
Ron switched his attention from a chiding Hermione towards him. "You know we had a Transfiguration essay due this afternoon."
Class drew to a close shortly after, the drone of the bell echoing through the hall in a weary buzz. Jackie was up and out the door in seconds, Pansy not far behind her, but Harry, as he'd taken to of late, took his time. Draco never seemed to dart like a fleeing fish from class quite like his friend did, and Harry was more than happy to spend the remaining time of packing their chairs away with him.
Draco's interruption cracked like a whip. Harry didn't glance towards him, but he fell silent. Eyes downcast, he couldn't quite bring himself to look at Draco, to raise his gaze and interpret what Draco's shifting in place, his shuffling, the curses under his breath and his muted hisses, meant. The shame was still there, the regret just as strong, and it only sunk its teeth in further the longer he sat with it.
Seamus Finnegan walked alongside Dean. He was smiling in spite of the sobriety of the feast that evening, nothing if not the picture of confidence and enthusiasm despite that Harry knew his parents had all but demanded he forgo school that year.
Harry's breath hitched. His gaze lowered to where he still held Draco's arm. Even through his jacket, he felt somehow warmed by the contact. Warm enough that he could barely feel the wind that was picking up pace around them.
They knew him so well. Harry wasn't even sure his friends would have leapt upon to such precaution in quite so direct a manner. Not like Dot and Von, and it struck him at that moment just how close they'd grown to him. Whether they liked it or not, and despite that they were more simply thrust into one another's company than that they chose to be, they were his friends too. Or of a sort, at least.
building. Ginny wasn't one typically intimidated, and she'd had experience with the press before, so he supposed her sudden bout of nervousness must be unfamiliar and all but unprecedented. If not for her expression, the fact that she'd actually attempted to dress conservatively in a modest blouse and jeans was indication enough. She was almost as pale as Ron, and that was saying something.
It took him until twelve o'clock that night to realise that he and his classmates were having a party. A party that was still going, and only rising in volume, intensity, and mayhem the longer it ensued. Three separate clusters of people had disappeared to raid the kitchens – probably the ex-Hufflepuffs again – and there were two independent games of poker being played with increasingly high stakes. The dancers, of which only a few of the original members remained, barely danced at all but managed more of a lazy, staggering sway and bounce. Just as many bodies were sprawled across the floor as occupied the too-little seating.
Harry smiled as he wandered behind them alongside Draco, though he listened with only half an ear. They did have to leave early, and Pansy's reminder might have dampened the mood a little, but…
Draco shook his head. Would he ever object to Harry's presence? "Not in the least. Provided he doesn't make a scene of himself."
Taking the steps two at a time, Harry burst through into his bedroom. The stillness and silence, the mess of the bed that had showed such a different seen an hour before, was a jarring contrast to the craziness crashing through his head. Slamming the door behind himself, he stood on the threshold, hands balled into fists at his sides and seething. He could feel himself trembling with the force of his anger.
"Well, I guess in fifth year, when Hermione, Ron, and I started up a club of sorts – yeah, that was probably the first time I really got a chance to meet most of the people outside of my dormitory."
"Don't try and hide it from me," James said, his voice rising and quaking with anger that flushed in his cheeks. "Fifteen years wasn't long enough for you to give up? What more could you possibly achieve? Your Lord is dead and gone, and no prophecy or predictions involving Harry hold any relevance anymore. How dare you think otherwise."
Glancing sidelong, he met Draco's returning glance as though he'd been the subject of his attention since they'd left the restaurant. Draco's closeness called to mind thoughts about leaving their brief trip behind, loading a dissatisfied heaviness in his belly alongside the pizza. It was enough that, when the climbed the stairs towards their rooms, he couldn't help but link his fingers with Draco's just enough to touch.
"Nose down, both of you," Dot snapped with more force than necessary. "If I'd wanted a show made of his intrusion then I would have done it myself."
When he smiled. At Draco. For Draco. Like that last shot that Draco had taken before Harry had 'disappeared'. To Draco, that shot was the best he'd captured – and yet also the worst, because it was the last. Because Harry smiled at him, for him, and then he left with barely a tilt of his head and a murmured "goodbye".
He didn't really like reading but the library was unexpectedly soothing, the murmur of voices hidden behind shelves and Madam Pince's shuffling footsteps unseen but appreciated company.
The pop of Apparition was louder than expected. Harry's street was a quiet one – which was one of the reasons Draco never Apparated directly onto it – and in the frozen cold of winter's emptiness it seemed even louder. Harry was grateful, then, that Draco had made an exception by arriving so closely. Even more grateful that he'd been so fast, which would explain the loudness of the crack. Turning, already moving before he'd properly caught sight of Draco, Harry broke into a run.
He loved his friends' company. He truly did. They were the family he'd never had, and he was never more comfortable than when they were with him, making a mess of his flat and chewing through his pantry with indignant questions of "Why is everything organic?" and "Where's the junk food, you tosser?" They were his most comfortable moments, and yet, somehow, it wasn't entirely…
His friends, Jackie's perseverance and Jill's unending goodness, were what made Harry hate the ridiculing of his classmates all the more. Harry didn't care so much about himself – not anymore. It was his friends that concerned him. They always would.
The sun was streaming across the dining table, capping the distant cliffs visible from the eastern window, by the time Harry lowered his fork to the table. At his side, Draco was sipping through his second cup of tea, half-turned in his seat towards Harry once more and regarding him quietly.
Not that Draco cared. He didn't care who any of the models were. He didn't care who he was photographing so long as he was practicing what he abruptly decided he wanted to pursue, wanted to perfect, and so long as the subjects in front of his lens abided by his wishes. It wasn't as if he had any investment in –
The fear still sat within him. Fear like a tattoo and just as permanent. Harry wondered if it would ever go away.
Did that make him different from people like Malfoy? Malfoy had just been trying to protect his parents, right? Himself too, which was an order of priorities that Harry liked to think he himself had the right way around, but it wasn't… it wasn't as though…
A smile crept its way onto Harry's lips. How quickly a moment could change, from anger and confusion to swelling euphoria and feverish delight. The sun was sinking but the evening somehow seemed brighter than it had been at midday.
The hallway that stretched from the elevator was glowingly white, the pristine floorboards just a shade darker. Empty walls made the passage seem wider than it was, broken only by intermittent doors closed and embedded along each side. Following in Pansy's wake, her confident strides slowed not even slightly by her ridiculously high stilettos, Draco instinctively strained his ears through the empty silence. Nothing but a distant click of a door broke that silence.
His voice caught and, in the brief pause, Harry edged a step closer to him. "What's going on? What's…? This is out of nowhere. What…?"
He trailed off, but the words didn't seem to be lost to nothingness. If anything, the detached blankness that Draco had fallen into in his silence appeared to have been wiped away and replaced with agitation that left him physically twitching in his seat. He fidgeted so violently with his mug that Harry was surprised tea hadn't already spilt across the table.
The ridiculousness of the situation was almost laughable. Harry Potter caring for Draco Malfoy, not just as a friend but as a potential lover? Ludicrous. And, just as ludicrous, Draco Malfoy actually caring for him in return?
Harry couldn't help but smile. Abel really was alright. A good bloke. It was a shame his shyness kept others from seeing it. "Thanks, mate."
"We literally spent an entire afternoon barely three feet from each other and you want to talk now?"
Granted, Harry was nothing if not in agreement Or he used to be when he still had the confidence to attempt to impress people rather than tuck his 'magic hands' into his pockets to hide them from prying eyes. In short, it had been fun. Fantastic. Amusing and entertaining, both for Harry himself and for those he performed to. He couldn't even remember when he had first started practicing magic tricks, but in many ways it had been as much a passion of his as his running was, as his football had been.
"It's clearly to add to his secret stash of material," Ginny whispered overloud, leaning towards Ron. She snickered as Ron shoved her face away from him, scowling.
Harry grumbled again, shoving a biscuit into his mouth. "Do you want me to be late for the bus?" he asked, even as Lily turned away from him.
"Are you busy?" Harry asked, pausing on the gutter and glancing absently in both directions. The traffic chugged with the speed of the turtle in its race against the hair, but it still took a dodging act to weave through it.
He hadn't eaten in a while, didn't know how long but knew it was a good long while, and that was terrifying in a different way. The kind of way his stomach told him that was
Harry almost jumped as Von, appearing seemingly out of nowhere, dropped a hand onto his shoulder and tugged him further backwards as he in turn stepped forwards. Like a body shield, he planted himself before Harry, all but entirely blocking out the approaching paparazzi.
Over the years, Draco supposed he had gotten used to it. The middle floor flat wasn't ideal, but if was sufficient. The location wasn't perfect, but it was vaguely central and easy enough to get to and from even without Apparition. The kitchen was neat and clean, if empty of working house elves, and the living room, the bedroom, the dining room that was practically part of the living room itself, was all furnished before he'd moved in. Draco had made it his own, darkening the wooden surfaces and adorning them with enough remnants of home that the small rooms felt almost like it.
"Only if you want to," Draco said. Something distinctly urgent touched his words, almost managing to override what sounded oddly close to pleading. "Only if you really want to, Harry. Not because I asked it of you, or because someone else is making you. Do you… do you want…?"
Draco flinched again. Then he leant towards Harry and stared intently at his hands, as though searching for sparkles or the glittering remnants of magic. Harry had the unexpected urge to hide them; he felt fraudulent, like he'd deceived Draco into thinking it was real. Harry didn't think that any self-respecting seventeen-year-old should really believe in magic, but it still felt cruel to take it away from him.
Harry was halfway through answering Ron's text when the cry reached him. Pausing mid-step, he glanced down the footpath he was headed and through the thin foot traffic to its source. A man. And a woman. And maybe a handful of other men and women, headed straight for him with steps so fast they were nearly running.
"So, you're the most likely person to know where he went. I didn't even see him leave, but I'll bet you did."
him. There was surely nothing more wondrous than that. Draco sunk into everything that Harry offered and would have been content to never untangle himself again.
Draco nodded slowly before switching his gaze towards Pansy. "Speaking of opportunities, how did you land one at
Was he scared? A little. Draco would be a fool not to be, not after years of learning what happened if he wasn't. Too many black eyes, bloody noses, and bruised cheeks left a mark even after those bruises had faded.
"He's too indignant to hear you," Hermione said, smirking at Harry. She did drop her hand to rest atop his socked feet in a somewhat affectionate manner, however.
The voice came from behind him, and Harry turned from where he'd been distractedly watching the slow trickle of equally early students, feet dragging with the rapid retreat of holiday bliss. Jackie, wrapped in far too few layers for the weather, appeared as if from nowhere and used the advantage of her long legs to all but step up onto the wall at his side.
Draco rolled his eyes, but a touch of a smile played across his lips. He opened his mouth to reply but paused as a shuffle of motion bespoke Su rising to her feet behind them. Harry didn't turn towards her, only half registering her suggested, "Mandy, I'm turning in. Are you coming?" Their mutual departure a moment later, however, was noteworthy for the emptiness it left in the dormitory behind them.
"Hasn't Evans told you his dirty little secret, mate?" Jacob asked, taking a slouching step forwards. He didn't look at Draco, eyes fixed instead on Harry. "Evans, that's wrong of you. You should be more honest."
Blinking in a useless attempt to clear his eyes, Harry raised his free hand to scrub the blurriness away before glancing around himself. A slow glance, because the tower was apparently a little bit tipsy itself and hadn't decided whether it wanted to stay still or not. With deliberate care, Harry took a shuffling step forwards and began to pick his way over the bodies surrounding him.
"The Leaky Cauldron?" Harry asked casually, though he was all-too aware of their clasped hands. Why it bothered him so much more that day than usual he didn't quite know; maybe it was because they'd been in Muggle London and he was made even more aware of potentially watchful eyes, of the judgment that those eyes could hold. Somehow, it was infinitely easier to be loudly proud of himself and his sexuality when he didn't have to consider a second person.
Draco nodded. Only then did he accept the paper bag and, settling back properly into his seat, gave indication enough for Harry that he was pausing in his study. Without a word about it from either of them, Harry seated himself in Draco's lap and, pulling his Transfiguration textbook from the table, leaned back against the arm of the chair with his leg hooked over the other side, and propped the book in his own lap.
Closing his eyes, he sank back onto Draco, moving his hips with each thrust that gradually smoothed, gradually fell into a rhythm that became increasingly easier to bear. His hand unerringly sought his own arousal, and in time with Draco's thrusts, with his own rocking motions, he jerked himself off to the heart-throbbing beat of pleasure.
Flinching slightly, shaking himself from his thoughts, Draco snapped his gaze towards the voice above him. Appearing seemingly out of nowhere, an older man with a younger woman at his side stood across the table from him. They looked nothing alike but seemed like two peas in a pod for the way they both stared down their noses, eyes narrowed, and lips drawn downwards in disgust.
To be a bit closer to Draco, to his warmth and the solidity of his body, had become a steadying pillar in the past few months. Creeping rapidly up to Christmas as they were, Harry couldn't help but feel the need to abuse the strange agreement they'd undertaken, the unscheduled but similarly agreed upon meetups they undertook. The holiday break wasn't particularly long, but when Harry was barely sleeping away from the hours in Draco's company…
"I don't usually get home till around seven most nights," Harry said. "But – I mean, it's always in the studio. You've got the prep too, and consultations, and running between places, or even just requisite hours at the gym. It's pretty rare that you're at one place for the whole day, so."
"That's what you're worried about? With all the feelings and whatnot. Does it help?" Ron didn't wait for Harry to reply before hastening into further assurances. "Because you know everyone would be totally supporting you to get over that weird Muggle mentality. All of us, and especially Ginny, even if she used to date you."
By three weeks into term, routine had firmly settled. It was no less manic, and Harry was realising more and more each day just what an impact a year of listless hiding and running did to his education. He'd never really cared about his grades, but that was before. That was when fighting, defeating, and surviving Voldemort came first and school second. He hadn't realised just how firmly he'd subconsciously placed everything else on the sidelines until it was pushed to the forefront.
He wasn't quite avoiding watching Harry and Pansy, was busying himself making final adjustments to his camera, his stand, checking the lights behind him and adjusting them just so, when conversation ceased. Mid-sentence, too, which was unusual enough for Pansy as, who stopped speaking and stuttered to a grinding halt.
"I don't know," Harry said, though with real confusion this time. Sliding his face down until his forehead rested on his knees, he wrapped his arms around his head instead. "I'm not sure if it's that."
The man laughed. It was a loud laugh, a good laugh, and profoundly genuine. Harry could see why he'd liked him in the past. "Yeah, I can commiserate with that. It's been mayhem at work with Valentine's Day and all, though that was a few months ago."
Not that it really mattered. In the grand scheme of things, Ron wasn't annoyed anymore, and Hermione was only ever accepting. That was good enough for Harry, and with a final nod at each of them, he left them to seek their beds and crossed the almost empty common room to the desk where Draco sat.
After a moment, Draco sighed and his rigid posture eased once more. "No, I suppose it's warranted. I may have been slowly changing my opinion over the past few years, and sometimes forced to by the efforts of my professors, but it hadn't really changed quite so significantly until I met you."
Draco had barely mentioned it, but Harry wasn't given the impression it was because he wouldn't tell him. Not because he couldn't. It was Harry that couldn't bring himself to ask in the face of the closed sobriety of Draco's expression.
The instant it did shut, it was as though the iciness in the room that had nothing to do with the winter chill seemed to lift. Ease replaced the frozen preparedness around their table and tension exhaled like pressure released from a balloon. Or maybe that was just the effect of Jill's greeting; she'd always been a morning person.
But there was still no explanation as to how she had found Harry in the first place. Nothing besides "there are spells that can be used for such purposes" and "some diviners believe there are ways", as if that explained anything.
Michael Corner, who had loudly exclaimed from his old Hufflepuff table that 'nothing and no one could tell him what to do', and that he saw attendance was a show of disloyalty for anyone to have abandoned Hogwarts that year. The Patil twins, shoulder to shoulder, hard-faced in a way that Harry had never seen of them before. Terry Boot and Sue Li, Susan Bones and Justin Finch-Fletchley. So many were in company that Harry hadn't expected more for their number than for who they were.
"Yeah. It's funny, you know – every decision made that wound me up in a pickle seems to have been entirely my fault."
Someone – likely Jackie or Blaise again – wolf-whistled, and it was enough to break Harry from his abandon. Pulling away hesitantly, drawing a shaky breath that he released in a puff of white air, his eyes caught briefly on the slick wetness of Draco's lips before flicking up to his eyes.
“Your Draco’s friend?” A voice asked which startled him and almost dropped his books but he managed then turned around to see Blaise.
“I’m sure he’ll understand mate.” Ron rolled his eyes “your reason for ignoring him is so childish.”
Harry stayed quiet, not really knowing what to say to him at all. So he decided to start walking again and his acquaintance just followed him.
“As your friends we are here to help you with your first official date with Draco Malfoy.” Ron started to speak “you haven’t really asked him to be your boyfriend right?”
Harry was nervous, really nervous, Today will be Draco and his first official date. He properly dressed for the day, wearing his newly bought polo shirt and his usual jeans. He also made effort to put on lots of cologne to smell extra good.
in bed with him, and that some people had opinions about that, bad opinions, and they would think them of Harry – worse, of Draco – and they might… they might act on those opinions and…
It was a slow, undulating coupling, far removed from what had become frantic and desperate the night before. Draco thrust upwards and into him, and Harry rolled his hips and met him with each motion, his gasped breaths and low murmurs of Draco's name as intoxicating as his weight atop of him. It was gradual, and blissful, and awash with spreading warmth that radiated from Draco's groin and down to his very toes.
It wasn't the first time she'd said those words, totally unrelated to the conversation at hand. It was closer to the tenth repeat. Harry ignored her just as he had the previous nine times, and so did everyone else. "Jill says that, but she's got a weird habit of always ordering a pepperoni pizza," he told Blaise. "I don't know why."
When Draco stumbled to a halt, he was breathing heavily. There was a desperate cast to his expression, an edge that Harry had never seen before. It wasn't angry. It wasn't quite terrified, either, or at least not the kind of terror that Harry had seen before – in Draco, in his friends, or in every other person who'd been at the Battle of Hogwarts. This was something else, something more complicated, and Harry didn't know what to do. He didn't know what to say.
Harry might not like them, wasn't sure if he'd ever like them, but he would attempt amicability. Malfoy was likely still an arse, even if he hadn't spoken a word throughout the entire feast, Parkinson probably still a cow despite the trembling downward turn of her lips, and Zabini almost certainly still a confident prat even though he didn't look it, but Harry would try. They didn't deserve to be hated so fiercely, or at least he didn't think so. There was too much hatred in the clean-up after Voldemort's destruction as it was. Harry was so goddamned sick of hating.
Jacob's fist didn't loosen. If anything it tightened further, the collar cutting into Harry's throat and lifting him higher onto his toes. Though Jacob's smile remained fixed, he was clearly anything but amused. It didn't scare Harry. Didn't intimidate him. He wasn't scared of them, had long ago moved past any fear – at least for himself. What did scare him was the sudden prospect of his lifelong bullies turning their attacks on Draco felt suddenly disastrous. Far worse than anything they could do to Harry, anyway.
"Did you even read any of the notes that Draco and I wrote?" Harry whispered back. "There was that guy, what's his name –"
"You're going to die from eating something gone rotten someday," Ron said, shooting her another frown.
"I would like to welcome the students of Hogwarts to our school," he said, beaming at the sea of guest students in their worn, wobbly seats. "It is, ah… it's my great pleasure to have you – you, the students, and yourself, Professor McGonagall – joining us today. It is my – no, it is
"Do what?" Draco snapped his gaze upwards to where Pansy stood above him. He didn't give her a moment to reply to his demand before all but lurching to his feet from where he'd been sitting at his desk. "No. Absolutely not."
, he thought to himself, and ignored that his urge to laugh had just the slightest hysterical edge to it.
"Is that curiosity I hear?" Ginny teased, still snickering. "Curiosity from – what was it that magazine called you the other day? The 'aloof and mysteriously distant' Harry Potter?"
But in spite of the wonders experienced, the isolation of one another's company only sporadically interrupted by friendly strangers, it was good to be back. Good to be in England. Good to be on home ground, even if Draco knew it was only a matter of time before his past caught up with him again and the world demanded Harry resume his place as their personal poster child. It didn't seem quite so daunting this time around. Not when Draco had someone he was properly standing alongside this time.
"How long is long?" Hermione asked curiously. "You always say you head into work at about eight. If it's a shoot…?"
No, what really drove Draco's speculation was his own memory. His own recollections. His own experience when he'd first met Harry, and that meeting hadn't been at Hogwarts. It hadn't even been on the train in that mortifying encounter that retrospect had Draco cringing at time and time again.
Hermione nodded. "Yes, anyone with a red and gold tie is from our House, so we're all pretty friendly with them. We could vouch for them."
Glancing briefly at his watch again, frowning as the minutes ticked closer to five o'clock, Draco used the advantage of his height to scan his surroundings. Regardless of the upper-class status of Mayfair that he'd swept into minutes before, people were always aplenty.
"She's good," Draco replied to Harry's words in perhaps the biggest understatement of the year. "There's a reason she's Creative Director of
But none of them ran. If anything, Ron took a deep breath as though to steel himself, and Hermione shuffled half a step towards Harry. With a grateful smile to each of them, he turned and led them down the hallway.
In an instant, the moment shattered. As one, the entire table and Jacob's group swung towards the intruding voice.
"You saved me from a horde of pathetic bullies by quite literally throwing yourself to the dragons," Draco said with a shrug of his own. "No one's ever done that for me before."
Harry silently agreed, and Jill's lack of protest was telling enough. They didn't speak of it further, however. It wasn't worth the effort, not when there were more interesting things to consider.
“Harry, please be brave for me.” Cedric said it with a low tone “they would be okay for us they’ll support us.”
Harry could feel Draco’s disappointment but he just shrugged it off. He quickly gave the taller boy a kiss on the cheek. Draco blushes and looks at him shyly.
“Well, be my boyfriend then?” Ron shrieked “why don’t you have a crush on me? I’m also good looking.”
“I’ve been suspecting it for days.” Hermione says and crossed her arms “there’s something about the way they look at each other
“You taste so wonderful.” Draco had whispered sucking his lower lip. He was on top of Harry and hopelessly he moaned eagerly, wanting more.
He never thought being an 11th grader was pretty boring. Him and his best friend got transferred to a school that his mother picked out for them; she says it’s one of the low-key prestigious schools in this big city.
“It might have worked but I’m driving.” Harry held back his laugh this time, because he knew if he wasn’t driving right now Harry would have looked at him and then he’d be spilling all the details of their date.
The next day, Harry was leaning on his locker waiting for Draco to pass by him. It was lunch time so he assumes every student was free. He waited until his other friends showed up clearly just got out from their respective classes.
Also it’s my birthday and I’m giving myself a present by updating this fic! And hopefully finish this one by the end of this year. (Prob won’t happen) hahaha
“PDA.” Ron announces and his friends turned to them. Immediately they teased them and Draco just laughed while his face was quite red. He stayed silent not really moving from the position they’re in. Harry could feel Draco’s heartbeat fast from laughing.
It kinda did messed with his mind, a bit. It was Saturday evening when Harry decided to buy his groceries because he was asleep the whole day and there wasn’t any food left on his fridge, a bunch of spoiled fast food and he’d probably die if he ate it. He went to the other room and tried knocking on Ron’s door but he sounded asleep; Harry can literally hear his best friend snore so loudly so he went alone and got an Uber to drop him off.
“Where are the others?” Harry ignored the question. He was still bitter that he didn’t really get what he wanted.
Harry was furious at the girl but Draco played it cool and refused to take the girls note. I’m gay..sorry the look on the girl’s face was hilarious but still it had made him mad for making a move to his Draco.
“C-Cedric, I-“ he looked at him and Cedric was still closing his eyes. It was silent for a second when his heart beat had stopped.
If it could be called enthusiasm, that was. C&C was never a particularly enthusiastic class in Harry's experience.
Harry nodded. That much he could believe. Unexpectedly, it didn't hurt to think of being told such a thing either. Harry was far from confident in the stability of their relationship, for how could he be when their 'relationship' was barely days old? Yet somehow, that Draco would openly tell him if he was busy or not in the mood eased his concerns. Rarely had Draco ever cancelled on their weekend study sessions, but each time it hadn't seemed for a reluctance to see Harry.
The thought of leaving James behind hurt more than the throbbing pain in Lily's face, but it was secondary to the fear that gripped her and demanded escape. She kept her eyes squeezed closed, shuttered from the disaster of the room, the destruction that had erupted, and evidence of her survival that she couldn't even attempt to understand. How? And Voldemort, was he…? And Harry, with his magical exhaustion, had…?
, murmured a voice in the back of Harry's head, and he winced in renewed horror, forced back to the present. No. Not romantic. It didn't matter that his stupid head seemed to have risen to become stuck in the clouds from the moment he'd turned around in the prefect bathroom, from the second he'd caught a glimpse of more pale, exposed skin than he'd wanted – than he'd
Knees drawn to his chest, chin resting atop them, and arms locked to stave off the kind of chill that couldn't be deflected by Warming Charms, Harry gazed out at the stretch of the Weasley's garden. He barely saw it, but that didn't really matter any more than the simplicity of the chair. Lost as he was, chewing over the question and the confusion that had been niggling at him for days, he didn't even notice when Ron's snores ceased.
Harry glanced at her sidelong where she sat at the opposite end of the couch. The paleness of her face had taken on a mottled cast, the scar on her cheek vividly shiny and pale. It was only then that Harry realised – she was pissed, yes, but just as apparent was that she was scared. Terribly scared.
Or it hadn't been more than that. Not at first, and not from Harry's perspective. He hadn't wanted more, but if Draco did? Now that Harry knew he might?
Hermione's eyebrows snapped up as she swung towards him, and Ginny followed suit with a slow turn of open-faced bemusement. They weren't the only ones; even Pansy took a pause from her staring to glance his way.
But even that held barely a candle to the bonfire of Draco's family discord. How did anyone handle the kind of tension left behind by a magical war?
"I think they probably didn't care for you, even though everyone assumes you must have been in a household that fawned over you," Draco ploughed on brutally, even as he internally winced at his own words. They were too true of his own past opinions. "I think that's the reason you had the same clothes from first to sixth year, and why you were always thinner when you came back to school from the holidays, or why you stayed at Hogwarts over Christmas. I think you had a bloody bad time of it, and either you don't want to admit it to yourself or you don't want to admit it to anyone who asks. Which is it?"
A handful of idlers, of tourists wandered in off the street, were scattered about the foyer, conversing in muttered exchanges befitting the grandiose ambiance. A stunted line snaked to an ornate little window in one wall, the calligraphic word'tickets' painted overhead on a gold-plated board reminiscent of a booth at a carnival. The young woman at the counter murmured in a humming tone that similarly fit the atmosphere of the room as much as her heavy, dark makeup and puffy hair did.
"Artemis never did give in to Callisto, did she?" Mel said, speaking through Thalia's continuation with a glance towards Clio for confirmation. At Clio's shaking head, she heaved a third sigh. "Silly girl."
Except that when he caught Harry watching him sidelong, he flashed him a smile that was warm, familiar, and overflowing with affection that Harry was all too familiar with these days. Familiar to the point of expecting it from a glance, from a hand squeezed, a kiss on the cheek or the way Draco would tip his head backwards when Harry walked behind him, grazing his hand through the slight kinks of curls in his blond hair.
"Haven't seen you in a while," the man said. "We didn't get a chance to exchange numbers last time. Where've you been?"
Draco blinked. The hint of a frown touched his brow before smoothing away almost immediately. "I was under the impression that was the desired outcome of our conversation."
"Mum," Harry said, already starting for the door. He paused alongside her, dropping a quick kiss on her cheek. "I'm fine. Seriously, I'll grab something from the canteen if I'm hungry."
"Hey," Harry said, interrupting them in a moment of actual indignation not dampened by Jackie's resurfacing hackles. He was growing to sincerely dislike the term, even if he didn't wholly know what it meant. "I resent that. I might not know my magic history but I'm pretty sure commoners used to get involved in magic too. I mean, I haven't really looked it up or anything –"
He didn't have time to compose himself. He barely even had the chance to wipe the smear of blood from beneath his nose before Harry was turning towards him.
He was frowning slightly. A concerned frown, almost worried. Draco supposed he couldn't blame him. In the short walk they'd taken in the passing minutes, Harry hadn't been partial to the train of Draco's thoughts. He didn't understand. More than that, he couldn't see himself and didn't know just how much Draco had been hiding with the excuse of work, professional distance, and the social expectations that would assault him should he speak his feelings back in London.
Ginny glared through a mouthful of beef. "What, that thing with Parkinson?" she managed, her words mangled. "I told you, that was definitely her who did that interview."
