Harry’s mind was racing. Scorpius’ life had been threatened, and Draco hadn’t told him? Harry was sure they would have been able to keep Scorpius safe without giving in to terrorists—what was the point of being the most famous man in England if you couldn’t get the best security for your son? But even if they hadn’t, Harry would still have wanted to know. He thought of the times he’d taken Scorpius to the park, or the shops back then, and let him wander away on his own. What if something had happened to their son?
“It’s very involved magic! Figuring it out the first time was a nightmare so forgive me if the last thing on my mind was collecting a magical signature. Anyway, the Auror team should have collected one from the house.”
“Okay, maybe I did pay more attention to you than normal,” Harry admitted, ignoring the way Ginny rolled her eyes at him.
“Harry,” Hermione sighed, her tone making it clear he was about to get a lecture. “You’re fixating on Malfoy again!”
“I’ve been thinking about the story time at the museum,” he sighed. “About how dragons mate with their true loves, and how humans have been trying to mimic that pure love for centuries. It’s a little depressing, isn’t it? To think that we can’t have that one person who was meant just for us?”
“Yes. He was Transfigured into an Occamy, in the middle of a large parlour. Having no control over his modified body, he grew to fit the room, as a normal Occamy would. Apparently the Aurors had a field day bringing him in.”
Draco shrugged. "I don't question people's motives. Now, Camilla said she understands your situation, and luckily their church community believes in the dissolution of marriages. It's not a very traditional church community, I was hard put to find some of the necessary information. The point though, is that she's agreed to a 'divorce'. Of course, since you weren't legally married, it's not a legal divorce, but this will stop her from trying to come after you and claim that you used her or some such nonsense."
“Is this about Harry?” she asked gently. Realising he could no longer shove the issue aside, Draco took a deep breath and nodded. He took his hand back, and wiped his eyes.
Harry nodded. Her reasoning made sense, and he was the first one to relate to wanting to get away because everyone was gossiping about you. If she knew it was going to be difficult in her small village, he was really glad she hadn't actually come back to London with him. She would never have been able to stand the publicity that surrounded him.
“Harry was gone for ages, and Draco was left all alone. He couldn’t help wondering what fun things Harry was doing without him. Was he having flying races with his other friends? Draco felt jealous at the thought, and he stopped flying while Harry was gone.”
"Will you be okay here?" Harry asked Bryan, who nodded shakily. Harry stared at him a moment longer, but decided to let it go. Bryan was an adult who could use his voice if something was bothering him. Putting it out of his mind, Harry took Scorpius’ hand and led him out to the hotel’s gift shop. They spent a little while picking out colourful trunks and flip flops, before making their way down to the enormous pool.
“Of course not. You just happened to spend the whole week making moon eyes at him and standing up for him against his friends.”
This new information was still at the forefront of Harry’s mind as he got up to head home for the night. He wished everyone a distracted goodbye and already had one foot out the door when Ron and Hermione caught up to him.
He flipped through the pages to illustrate his point, when something caught his eye. Hidden between two blank pages were two small photographs—one of him as a kid, and one of his dad.
"Come on," he said, giving Harry a look that... oh. Blushing furiously, now that he understood what Bryan wanted, Harry took his hand and allowed himself to be led out onto the dance floor. He was being oddly bold, but that was probably because of the alcohol and his loosened inhibitions. They found a small gap in the crowd and squeezed into it, pressed up close to each other. Harry could feel every single one of Bryan's movements as their chests and their hips moved together. The music continued to pound around them, but Harry found himself getting lost in the feeling of the hand on his hip, or the other one on his back. He looked up into Bryan's eyes and was stunned to see a heat that he felt reflected in his own heart.
"Scorpius, you can't just invite yourself over to people's houses! I'm sure Harry will want to decorate in his own style."
“I’ve taught you how to make curry,” his dad pointed out. “Why don’t you just make it for yourself?”
“I must admit, it’s usually pretty boring. People think of healing as a glamorous job, but it’s mostly a lot of paperwork. There’s a form for everything. Every appointment needs a report, every potion needs a prescription, every transfer needs a whole stack of forms. There’s even paperwork for when you forget to do the paperwork! I understand that it’s for record keeping, in case something goes wrong, but whenever there’s a need to verify old paperwork, it suddenly becomes impossible to retrieve it from the archives. If it’s not a clearance issue, it’s a supervisory issue, or sometimes it’s even just a problem with the outdated charms in the filing room…”
It was fascinating, to say the least. The entire journal seemed to be centered around one batch of polyjuice potion. Scorpius recognised the generally approved steps taught in NEWT classes, but surrounding them were a bunch of additions, corrections and changes that he’d never before heard of. There were also a bunch of numbers in the margins, and while Scorpius prided himself on his arithmetic skills, he could not find any pattern or meaning in them.
The Head Auror nodded, striding over to a side door and holding it open. Scorpius leaned forward in his seat to watch as Adella walked out—Teddy must have requested her specifically—and on her arm was his papa.
"Okay. I'll need her contact information; floo address, owl address, and the apparition coordinates for her house. Does she have any assets?"
“That’s interesting. Most Healers usually say something about wanting to help people, or that it pays well.”
Scorpius had been tip-toeing around the subject of his papa at dinner with his dad, and Teddy had told him he’d been doing the same. They’d assumed Harry didn’t want to hear anything more on the subject, even though Draco constantly demanded news about how Harry was whenever Scorpius returned to his flat from dinner.
He still loved rural life, however. Especially around forests. Which was why, when the owl returned with an invitation to lunch in Hogsmeade, he didn’t hesitate.
Harry groaned as he thought about having to climb all the way back down those steps, but realised he was happy to do it for Scorpius, who was trying to peer over the railing to see the whole slide.
“Human to animal Transfigurations are a complicated subject. Even most NEWT students don’t learn more than the basic theory. I can only think of one Healer who graduated in the last three decades to whom I’ve taught such advanced Transfiguration.” She gave him a meaningful look.
Geoffrey seemed impressed by you, honestly Harry, I had no idea you knew so much about theatre. Not to mention your insights on
“You left me at Slughorn’s Christmas party to follow him after he got caught by Filch,” she pointed out.
Agent Delta hated being backed into a corner, but that was exactly what had happened here. Even if they hadn’t been working on the same case, Phi would probably still have joined their unit—Agent Phi and Agent Eta both had more seniority than Agent Delta. Deciding there was no point in arguing anymore, Agent Delta changed the topic.
“It sounds like this might be a sexually transmitted infection. Have your recent partner or partners been tested lately? Do you employ protection spells, or Muggle protection?”
“I’m sorry to leave you to finish eating on your own, but I have to dash.” He stood up and took a moment to straighten his robes, before picking up his folder.
“You can count on that,” she said, leaning in to give him a hug. The conversation lightened up after that, and they enjoyed a wonderful lunch, though Draco and Pansy both got teary eyed again when it was time to say goodbye.
Oh. So that's why she had seemed sad that he was leaving—because she thought she had to leave with him.
“My office, now,” she said curtly, turning and marching away. Harry sighed, glancing about the office and relieved to find that only a couple of people were around and that none of them seemed to be listening. He got reprimanded at work embarrassingly often, now that he thought about it. He should probably do something about that, but he couldn’t help it. The only department in the entire Ministry that they hadn’t been able to review and audit in the years since they’d created MOMERO was the Department of Mysteries. Hermione kept telling him not to worry about it, but Harry couldn’t help thinking that someone higher up was threatening her to leave it alone. Hermione definitely wouldn’t take a bribe, and Harry couldn’t help thinking that something scary enough to successfully threaten Hermione was definitely worth looking into.
“I think I’m the oldest, aside from you, and I’m 22,” Jackie said apologetically. “But we’re all just teasing, you do know that, right? It doesn’t really matter how old you are.”
When he stepped out of the floo into Scorpius’ living room a few hours later, Harry once again found that it was empty. Glancing around, he realised not much had changed. He placed the flitterbloom pot he’d purchased on his walk on the coffee table. He’d hoped it would add a little more life to Scorpius’ flat.
They kept up this awkward dance for just over a week. Finally, it was Harry who broached the subject.
“I’d better get going,” he said, putting his glass down and standing up. “I have a very early Portkey. But thank you for dinner, it was really nice getting to spend some time with you.”
“The two friends used to do lots of fun things together, like flying races…” he paused and looked at Harry and Draco, who both sprinted across the stage, flapping their wings wildly. Draco reached the end first and turned to Harry with a smug smile, but it promptly disappeared when the host yelled out, “Congratulations, Harry!”
“Do you know of any good pitches?” Teddy asked. “I can’t remember the last time I went to a public pitch.”
As soon as they arrived, Harry was sucked into a whirlwind of activity. He was introduced to a group of eldery people, whom he assumed must be the tribe’s leaders, and then shoved into a line with other men dressed similarly to him. Hassan was right that this wasn’t the same image of beauty Harry had been raised with, but it was hard to miss how proud these men were of the work they’d put into their appearances. Every one of them, while sharing similar traits, had their own unique touches, such as a differently placed string of beads, or handmade scarves and hats in beautiful, vibrant colours.
“So, I have a confession,” Harry said carefully. He looked up to find Draco staring at him with wide eyes, as if Harry was about to reveal a huge secret.
Trying not to get distracted with thoughts of horrible penmanship, Draco turned his attention back to the Auror report from the morning his second patient had been admitted.
“That was a rhetorical question, Scorpius. You’re still a little young to stay alone in a muggle hotel.”
“Honestly, sometimes he still acts like it,” Teddy said sarcastically. Scorpius raised an eyebrow at him—Teddy’s sarcasm usually meant he was nervous, or feeling left out.
“Well, now that’s a peculiar story. The shelter said that the little girl who had him before—and terrible story, that, lived in an abusive home, the poor things, she was a squib and her father didn’t like that at all. Normally when wizarding children are taken into protective care, they’re allowed to keep a pet with them, but because she was a squib, they sent her to a muggle relative, and of course a muggle can’t raise a crup, so this little man was sent to the shelter. But because she was so scared all the time, whatever his name was originally, he didn’t learn it, because he learned to respond whenever she cried for help.”
“He’s been at it for so long the lifeguards have already rotated three times,” Harry chuckled, pulling himself out of the pool. He noticed Draco glancing at his bare chest, and couldn’t help feeling a little self conscious about his body.
“No, Scorp, it’s fine. I wanted to. I have some sick days banked anyway, I figured I’d take one today. Maybe I’ll go crash at your place, see if Harry’s free. I can pretend to be really sick and get him to cook for me.”
“Um, I’m just going to go to the loo,” Draco said awkwardly. Harry and Scorpius both watched as he shuffled across the flat. As soon as he’d closed the door behind him, Harry turned to his son.
“It seems someone has been going around Transfiguring people into animals. It’s complicated to do and even harder to undo, so it usually takes me three or four days to treat one person.”
“I've missed you too. Teddy and Harry as well, but you were definitely the one I thought about most.”
“It was an experience,” Draco admitted. “One that I hope never to repeat. But please don’t feel bad that I did it, I was just doing my job.”
The more I think about this plan of yours, the more headache-inducing it seems to become. Are you going to want to act affectionate at the Gala? Do I have to talk to people? Do we need to colour coordinate ties? Yikes.
“Honestly, I’m quite fed up of wondering the exact same thing. Let’s not talk about this anymore—tell me about your work.”
“This is a nice restaurant,” Harry said, feeling stupid. Of course it was a nice restaurant—anyone with eyes could see that.
Harry was rearranging all these purchases in his suitcase one evening, when Hassan knocked on the door.
Draco didn't want to leave his bed the next morning, knowing it would be the last time he slept in it. He knew Harry had said he could stay as long as he wanted, but he didn't want to be here without him. Draco knew that as soon as he spent a night here without his host, he'd never want to go back to his own place.
“I guess I just… I feel like an idiot. This morning when you said you were calling your lawyer, I still had this tiny hope that after the divorce we could still have something. I’m annoyed that I let myself fall for you.”
“Honestly, I wasn’t sure I’d make it tonight. I got a third case yesterday, and it’s been slow going. Thankfully I had the foresight to bring my formal robes with me to work.”
“Potter, as tempting as it is to tell the media that you had a sore throat, every Healer in this hospital is bound by strict confidentiality clauses in their contracts.”
Right on cue, a curious face poked around the side of the sofa, and Scorpius’ face split into a wide grin.
“It was my pleasure. I had fun tonight, and I hope you did too,” he said with a smile. “I’m going to Apparate from here. Good night, Harry.”
“What’s that?” Scorpius called out, sounding confused. Harry smiled, certain he would be showing the Malfoys how to operate a television, among other technology, later on.
Draco still wanted to deny it, but she was right. Why else would he be sitting here crying to her instead of in London breaking up with Harry?
Draco snapped back to attention as Harry waved a hand in front of his face. He’d completely tuned out of the conversation in his desperation to find the attacker.
“I don’t know how much longer it would have taken to figure it out if Harry hadn’t known Selpie. He pieced it together last night, when I was telling him about the case.”
"I didn't know," he croaked out, feeling like the world's biggest scumbag and idiot at the same time.
“Okay, I’ll do it,” Draco announced. It took Harry and Scorpius a moment to realise what he meant, until Draco sat down on a bench and started untying his shoes.
Over the next few days, Scorpius and Teddy made it a point to ensure that each of them had dinner with Harry at least twice a week. Harry’s statement about his family not needing to keep secrets had made them realise that they’d been spending a lot of time with Draco since he’d been released, and that Harry must have been feeling left out.
“Hey!” came an indignant cry from the kitchen. A moment later Scorpius looked up to see his dad join them, offering butterbeers all around. “I resent that!”
At least one of his missions was working out. Wishing they could both be that easy, he turned his attention back to the Auror reports.
"Tired?" she asked, and he nodded. Hand in hand, they made their way back to the house, Harry enjoying the peace and quiet. He couldn't help feeling a little guilty—this community had welcomed him so openly, and yet he was probably going to have to head back soon. The large gathering had reminded him of Weasley family parties, which had left a little bit of an ache in his stomach. Travelling was nice and all, but he was starting to feel that it might be time to go home soon.
“Harry?” Draco called, just as Harry had reached for the powder. He turned to see Draco sitting in the same spot, smiling softly at him.
“If you think he can handle it, then I’ll allow it,” the lifeguard finally decided. “However, you’ll need to go back down and wait at the bottom to catch him.”
“He’s so overprotective because he’s scared of losing you again. He wants to be certain that you’re safe, and looked after.”
“He searched high and low, wide and far! Draco climbed mountains—Harry pretended to fly upwards—and he searched the valleys!—Harry made a swooping movement—He called out for Harry, but still, he couldn’t find his friend.”
"How can I do that? Doesn't it take time to trust someone else?" he asked. She translated for her father, who, despite his earlier fury, looked rather impressed with Harry's reasoning. He said something back, which caused Camilla to sigh exasperatedly. She replied to her father without bothering to translate for Harry, and  it sounded like they were having a rather heated argument, before her father finally seemed to agree.
“Have fun at work, Draco!” Luna said genially. “And watch out for Pebbleskulled Icanhazbugs! The hospital is infested with them, but carrying malachite in your pocket should protect you.”
Teddy laughed. “I’m waiting for my Billywig propellers to finish stewing, there’s not much I can do until they’re done. So yeah, I guess some work would help. What’s up?”
"I'm really sorry, we don't have any spare pieces that aren't buried. I do have some papers and markers if you would like to draw some dragons?"
Two hours later he wandered back out of his hotel and down the street to a little coffee shop where he was due to meet Camilla. Spotting her at a table in the corner, he joined her with a smile.
“It feels like no matter how much time I give myself, there’s always someone else waiting to take advantage of my fame, or my money, or some other social benefit that I can offer them, without a care in the world for
Scorpius hesitated. He’d been trying not to get his hopes up, but if they could bring the case to the Wizengamot and get his sentence reduced…
An hour later, he’d persuaded some spineless Ministry interns to give him Scorpius’ floo address with the help of a couple of signed chocolate frog cards. Making a mental note to talk to their supervisor about confidentiality later, he returned home, wondering what he could take for Scorpius as a housewarming gift. The address gave no indication of what the flat would look like, and Harry finally admitted defeat, deciding that for today he’d just take food. Once he’d had a good look around, he could decide on something nice that would complement Scorpius’ style.
“I’ll let you know when I get back, and we can pick up our discussion there,” Draco offered. “I’ll see you later, Harry.”
No. As Harry continued to ponder the question, he became more certain that Scorpius had just never given him the address. The poor boy must have been quite stressed about the move to forget something as important as that. Harry understood, remembering his own fears about living alone for the first time as an adult.
“You should take your jacket with you,” Draco said. “I don’t like to say it, but things go missing pretty easily in such a public space.”
. Maybe if you’d thought to worry about him before now, he wouldn’t have spent 15 years in prison! You keep insisting that he should have trusted you, that you have so much power and fame that you could have kept him safe from the threats he faced. So why didn’t you use that power and fame to fight for him?”
Harry smiled as he remembered the wizarding community's morning market. He'd walked past a woman who was selling toys in the morning, when a dancing toy reindeer had caught his eye. Remembering his promise to bring a souvenir back for Scorpius, Harry had decided to purchase it. They had struck up a conversation, and Harry had been surprised to find that it was rather freeing to talk to someone who didn't know his whole history, even if the woman's English was a little broken. She had tried to explain that her family mostly spoke Sami and Norwegian, and eventually she had convinced Harry to join her for lunch, where they'd eaten the most delicious stew. Harry hadn't a hope in the world of being able to pronounce it, but she'd managed to convey that it contained mutton and vegetables, and had even taught Harry a couple of words while they chatted.
“I spent years trying to move on, trying to accept that you were gone. So to suddenly find out that you were back, to find out that you’d been threatened, and that you were ill… it was a lot. I was angry, and confused, and worried about how things were going to change.”
. He looked around curiously, and was surprised at what he saw. Draco’s decorating style was… eclectic. There was no other word for it. The room was opulent, but not in a traditional sense—there was a maroon velvet sofa with gold legs against a black wall painted with huge images of wildflowers. The floors were a dark wood—almost black, really—and the rest of the walls were either cream or maroon. There was a golden floor lamp with a shade that matched the painted wall, and much more maroon velvet furniture. Harry’s first thought was that Draco had decorated his flat in Gryffindor colours, but after a moment of thinking about it, he realised that these shades were more muted, giving the room a mature look.
“Goodnight,” Harry said softly as he closed the door between their rooms. His room felt a little too big without the Malfoys cuddled on his sofa, but he didn’t worry about it as he got into bed thinking of dragons, and eventually falling asleep with a smile on his face.
“Did you really arrive right on time for exams?” Draco asked curiously. “I would always worry if I wasn’t there at least ten minutes early. It takes time to find your seat and arrange your quills before the exam starts.”
Scorpius let his gaze wander around his flat. It was still quite generic, since he clearly hadn’t had much time to decorate. Harry wondered how his own home would change now that Draco was back. He found he was looking forward to finding out.
Everyone raised their drinks and before long the conversation had shifted to the upcoming Quidditch drafts. Any attacks on the family of the Wizengamot were quickly forgotten by everyone other than Harry. He couldn’t help mulling over this new clue about Malfoy. If he was a supervisor, that might be why he didn't take new patients. As a supervisor, he’d also be in a better position to make shady deals with Unspeakables. But surely the receptionist would have at least been familiar with supervisors in the hospital and how to contact them?
“You can, and you will,” Agent Phi said firmly. Their expression softened. “I know it’s not ideal. But it’s necessary. As much as you’re trying to argue, you know it is.”
“Come on, ‘Mione—if he’s a supervisor he could be up to all kinds of things and get away with them too! Don’t tell me you’re not at least a bit curious about what that smarmy git is up to.”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, leading him off the dance floor. “I didn’t mean to startle you, I just wanted to reply to the couple who wished us a goodnight as they passed us.”
“Are you warm enough?” Scorpius asked. He reached over and tugged a bit at the cloak, so that it covered his papa properly.
Teddy nodded, then turned his attention back to the wireless, just as Puddlemere scored another goal. They didn’t speak anymore of Draco that night, but Scorpius still had thoughts of his father racing around in the back of his mind as he climbed into bed. He had to know
"I'm sure the hotel has a gift shop where I can get him some. I'll need a pair too. What do you say Scorp? Lets go check out the hotel's pool."
Draco felt his own sense of guilt creeping into his gut. He was lying to the one person who thought he was actually worth something, and could think of no way out of it, other than to break Harry’s heart. He stood quickly, needing to get away from Harry’s adoring gaze. He’d barely taken two steps toward the Floo, when Harry reached out and took his hand, pulling him back.
Hassan shook his head. “The Wodaabe tribe doesn’t do big ceremonies for individual marriages, the way many other cultures do. If a woman chose you during Yaake, in their eyes, you are married.”
“Mr. Taber…” Scorpius said slowly. “You said you call him in from the yard at night. Do you call out “Help”?”
“Madame Pomfrey wants me there as soon as possible. I’ll stay in touch with whoever replaces me for a while, just to help transfer all my responsibilities, but the change is going to be pretty much immediate.”
Harry wished he could give it to Scorpius in person, just to see the excitement on his face, but he found he didn’t mind the idea of Draco telling him all about it either.
“Well, maybe you can help me figure out what they are. What are all these?” he asked, pointing to the fridge, the microwave and the coffee maker.
“Um, photographs help to make a place feel like home,” his dad said eventually. “You’re welcome to take copies of any of the ones I have here. There are some good memories from when you and Teddy were teenagers.”
"He want to know how he can trust you," she sighed, looking a little resigned. Harry stared back, unsure how he was supposed to prove such a thing.
Harry and Draco were surprised to find a rich history at the square when they arrived, and promptly decided that a tour would be a good idea. Scorpius didn’t seem to agree at first, dragging his feet as they went, but his mood instantly lifted at the sight of all the chocolate in the store where the tour ended. The little trio were soon seated at a table in the sun with large chocolate sundaes in front of them, chattering happily about the things they’d seen, the car ride, and the shows on the Telly.
He was sure Harry’s admission that he still loved Draco had to do with it, but in a sudden spark of bravery, Draco turned to face Harry, reaching out and taking his hand. He squeezed lightly, and was reassured when Harry squeezed back.
Silence fell again as Scorpius gave his dad time to digest everything he’d just said. Teddy and his papa had both said his dad was angry, but the man in front of him seemed sad. Scorpius knew he’d hurt his dad by hiding such a big secret from him. It was on the tip of his tongue to apologise, but nothing he could think to say felt like enough.
And what if one day he did fall in love with someone, but they didn’t love him back. It had felt like he was in the same position with Laura for a while, and quite frankly, had been an awful feeling. But if it happened once, surely it would happen again?
“I can’t think of any kind of connection between him and the other two either,” Harry mused. “Unless it was revenge for something, like with the Wizengamot member’s daughter?”
When Teddy finally returned to his seat, the Chief Warlock immediately stood and called a recess. Scorpius watched as the court filed out, all of them looking relieved that Teddy’s lecture was over.
The Chief Warlock nodded, clearly thinking something over. Finally, with a glance around at the courtroom, he spoke again.
Scorpius suddenly realised his dad had left to avoid a conversation about Draco. In fact, he’d neatly avoided mentioning his ex-husband earlier, when Scorpius had asked if he’d played little-league. He felt a little guilty that his dad was feeling uncomfortable, but now he and Teddy were alone in the sitting room and he could ask whatever he wanted.
Back at school, Harry would have assumed that Draco was mocking him, but he sounded quite genuine in his offer. Harry cast about for a moment, trying to remember what one of the unfamiliar words had sounded like.
“Breakfast?” Teddy asked with a grin. “These are my dinner. But enough of that, I wanted to ask you about these instructions. They can’t be right.”
“He’s got a point, Dad,” Scorpius said sheepishly. “You’re a brilliant seeker, and a half-decent chaser, but for some reason keeping just isn’t your strong suit.”
So what do you say? We’ll have lunch with Geoffrey, and then later tonight, if you’re amenable, I’d like to take you out for dinner. No work, no press, no Tom and Ellen, no reading between the lines (and no shots!). Just us, getting to know one another and building a relationship.
“It’s nice. It still feels a little generic though. Like, I’m not quite sure what style I want in it. You know?”
He was just admiring the intricate woodwork that decorated the church, when Camilla tugged at his hand and pulled him to the front.
“I’ll be better when you leave, knowing you’ll never talk to my son again,” Harry said coldly. Scorpius usually hated using his dad’s fame to get his way, but he had to admit that there were times when it came in handy. He watched with a smug smile as Smith mumbled something incoherent, before slinking out of the office.
"Good. Keep that bottle, it has a cooling charm on it. Just refill it when you need it. Do not accept water from les moldus, it is not always purified. Foreigners like you get sick like that."
“We’re heading out,” he announced, pulling Draco up with him. The Weasley girl wolf-whistled, and Draco was sure he and Harry had identical blushes.
“I promise to write regularly, now that I can afford parchment and ink,” he said, trying valiantly to lighten the bittersweet moment. “And now you all have an excuse for spontaneous trips to Paris.”
“I’m just being melancholy,” Harry shrugged. “I didn’t exactly have a normal life, growing up. I guess watching you guys is just making me wonder how things could have been different.”
Ron sniggered, putting his arm around Hermione’s shoulders. “She’s got a point, mate. You need better hobbies than stalking Malfoy.”
Draco hadn’t quite hammered out the details yet, but now that Harry mentioned it, the thought of moving out of his current flat made him quite sad. Very few people had ever seen what it looked like, but it was so quintessentially Draco—he’d put hours of work into making it entirely his space. On those days when being an Unspeakable had become unbearably lonely and confusing, his flat had been the one safe haven where Draco could truly be himself. He wasn’t going to need that anymore, but it wasn’t something he was ready to part with just yet.
"The people who were supposed to use it cancelled at the last minute, so I figured we may as well. Probably a lot more comfortable than all four of us trying to balance on a hotel bed, and I didn't want to sit in the public restaurant and discuss this."
“I’d like to present an excerpt from an interview with the assassin who took the Minister’s life, as well as another excerpt from an interview with the Minister’s secretary,” Harrison was saying. Scorpius nodded, recognising the interview with the secretary, but his curiosity crept in at the mention of an interview with Silverthorn. He hadn’t gotten that far in the case when it had been handed over to the Head Auror.
“You know I love you, right?” his dad said. His voice was low, but Scorpius felt the weight of the question.
“I have a modified recipe for polyjuice potion. I was wondering if you could tell me what these changes would do to the potion.”
to commit the crime of the century, and he hadn’t even known until after the fact. What if Draco hadn’t changed the potion, or hadn’t done it correctly? What if the killer had gotten away with it? Would there have been another war? Would the kids have been in danger?
“That would be lovely, thank you,” he said, accepting a steaming cup of strong tea as it floated over to him a moment later.
His last statement startled Draco into a laugh. Recently, Harry had found himself collecting jokes and funny stories, hoping to get the chance to use them to hear that beautiful laugh again. If Draco agreed to live with him, he might get to hear it every day.
“Harry, look at me.” Draco kept his voice calm, but firm, as he took Harry’s face between his hands. “The decisions we have to make in life are never easy. You
She beamed at that, though her eyes were a little teary. As much as he loved Luna and Millie, it was Pansy who had always been his best friend, and he knew they were going to miss each other immensely.
“Is that why you haven’t dated anyone else since then?” he asked quietly. It hadn’t seemed weird to him until now, but if he was done with Draco, Harry should have started dating other people. His heart felt heavy when Harry nodded.
Harry bit his lip, but didn’t argue. He knew by now that arguing with Draco about his job was fruitless. Instead, he turned to his son.
“But if people thought long and hard about getting married and no longer needed divorces, your papa wouldn’t have a job anymore, would he?” Harry quietly refrained from pointing out that Draco was a huge hypocrite if he was advising people not to get married to the wrong person. He didn’t think antagonizing a five-year old about his parents’ horrible divorce was a great idea, especially when Harry desperately needed said five-year-old’s father’s help with his own divorce.
They stopped in a small town where they purchased richly embroidered ceremonial robes and bright coloured makeup for Harry. They also picked up a selection of feathers and beads, which Hassan explained were all necessary items for the contest. He then introduced Harry to his friend, Daneri, who was a member of the tribe and therefore privy to their secret meeting place. Daneri didn’t speak a lot of English, so Hassan spent the rest of the ride translating as they discussed the Yaake ritual, which would be happening that afternoon.
Berating himself internally for being so awkward, Harry watched Draco walk out of the cafeteria, and counted to ten for good measure, before Vanishing the awful sandwich. He spared a moment to lament the loss of his lunch, before deciding he’d be better off picking something up from literally anywhere else. He’d saved the world—surely he at least deserved a decent sandwich.
“So, how did you two meet?” Ron asked, shooting a warning look at the others. They mostly settled down, but Harry was sure this wasn’t the last of it.
“I don’t think so,” Scorpius said, unlocking his drawer and pulling the journal out. “His writing is pretty neat.”
Predictably enough, her mother gasped when she translated his statement, but his father still seemed suspicious.
“Okay, Harry!” Scorpius cried happily, shaking with excitement once again. With one last wave, Harry shifted his hips and allowed himself to slip down the wet plastic.
“Because she thought you were going to marry her?” Draco asked uncertainly. Harry shook his head, feeling glum.
“How old are you guys then?” Harry demanded. “I know you three graduated recently, so you can’t be more than 20, but the rest?”
They had then invited Harry to have lunch with them, and he’d soon realised that even though he was only 25 years old, he was probably the oldest person in the group. That didn’t stop them from inviting him
“It’s not actually a train,” Draco tried to explain, though he seemed to have no words to explain exactly what it
Harry nodded, and followed her up the stairs. She disappeared into her own room before he could say goodnight, and he hoped he hadn't upset her too much with his announcement. Deciding it could wait until tomorrow, he loosened his tie and flopped onto his own bed.
“And how does your dragon fly with only one wing?” Harry asked, holding said wing in place while Scorpius fastened it to the spine.
“You’ve been distracted for a couple of days. Your notes on the Apparition Permit Office’s payroll audit make no sense.” She handed him a file he had no recollection of working on. Had he really been that distracted?
“Usually one minute is enough for most foods,” Harry explained, pointing out the 1 minute button. Draco, who was still staring into the microwave, jumped when the light suddenly went off and the microwave started beeping.
"Oh Merlin, this is a new level of stupid, even for you! How did you go through the whole wedding without even knowing what was happening?"
“I find it hard to believe that not a single Unspeakable has a romantic relationship outside the department.”
“I found Papa’s case file in that cabinet. This was before you told me about what had happened, and I was so curious, that I started to read it. It wasn’t long before Head Auror Clearwater caught on, and revealed to me that there had been something weird about Papa’s case. She hadn’t had the seniority to address it at the time, but she suggested that I review it, and see what I found.”
married, silly. Remember, we are celebrating all day?" Her tone made it clear that all this was clearly an amusing joke to her, but something in Harry's mind suddenly clicked.
“It has been fairly quiet. But I’ve been keeping busy—drinks at the Leaky every Wednesday with the Gobstones club, and supporting little-league Quodpot in the park every Sunday. I used to coach them, but my body just isn’t what it used to be anymore. So now I just sit in the stands, cheering them on and bringing snacks to their big games. I’ve been involved with the league for so long that some of the players are children of the players I used to coach.”
“During the original hearing, it was established that my client brewed Polyjuice Potion as part of a plot for a known terrorist group to infiltrate the Ministry and kill the Minister. While my client did brew the potion, it was originally ignored that he was coerced into doing so. Furthermore, the court was not informed of his attempt to foil the assasination plan and attempted terrorist coup by modifying the Polyjuice Potion. The lack of intent, as well as the deliberate intervention, demonstrate that Mr. Malfoy was clearly not a terrorist, nor that he was actively supporting the attack. For this reason, we request that all charges of terrorism be removed from Mr. Malfoy’s record.”
He hesitated, wondering if his dad would be upset at the extent of Teddy’s role in keeping this from him. He knew, however, that his dad would be much more upset if he found out that Scorpius was still keeping the truth from him.
“I actually stumbled upon the file by accident,” he admitted. “But once I started reading it, it became clear that something had been very wrong. It took a while to piece the clues together, but I finally managed it.”
Agent Delta scowled at the news. Agent Eta was married to Agent Phi, and not as part of a mission either—they actually fancied each other. It was a rare occurrence for agents to get on like that, but it seemed to work for them... so far.
Not one to argue with good food, Scorpius held the door open for him, nodding eagerly. They made their way out into the atrium, and down the street to their favourite Thai restaurant, Teddy complaining about incompetent assistants and egoistic lab supervisors all the way there. Apparently he’d had to fire someone for a careless mistake that had literally blown up in Teddy’s face that morning.
Draco gave an exaggerated sigh. “Fine, if you really don’t know how it works. Will you have dinner with me this Friday? 6PM, at the
“Merlin’s b—” he quickly stopped talking and glanced at Scorpius, but was satisfied to find his son still staring at the television. “These muggles are quite fond of noisy contraptions, aren’t they?” he asked, just as a loud honking came from the television, followed by the sound of Scorpius’ uproarious laughter.
Draco could feel himself blushing. Not wanting to admit that he’d just been thinking about marrying his ex-husband (merlin, it felt weird to even
Harry stepped out of the floo into a bright, open plan living room. The fireplace was framed by a taupe coloured sofa and a matching armchair, and behind the sofa was an island counter and a very modern kitchen.
“I know Scorpius is busy, and he doesn’t really have time to find other recipes that won’t make you sick,” Harry said, suddenly feeling the need to justify himself. “But if you keep eating the same thing day after day, there’s no way you’re going to regain your strength.”
Agent Phi shrugged. “I asked the same thing. He seemed to think that would be too tricky. He was hoping he would get called in to handle the creatures, and that he could discretely Transfigure them back after removing them from view of everyone else.”
“I really hope so,” Scorpius sighed. “When they say you can’t imagine the horrors of Azkaban until you’re there, they mean it. Even with Patronuses, it’s awful.”
“I checked and stabilised every single organ, muscle, bone, tissue and vessel I could think of in her body, and I’m going to consult with an expert today to ensure we can put her completely to rights. We’ve Charmed her to sleep until we’re certain she’s okay, so she won’t feel any pain. There’s no need to worry. From what I gather, she’s going to be completely fine.”
He gave her hand a reassuring squeeze as they approached the hotel. Nodding to the welcome wizard, they made their way upstairs and down the hall to Harry's room. He unlocked the door and made his way over to the desk, grabbing his larger rucksack and stuffing it in his pocket with the aid of a shrinking charm. He turned back to Camilla to find that she had closed the door, and had
"Scorpius, did you say thank you for your new toy? Harry didn't have to get us anything, it was really nice of him to bring that for you."
“Greengrass,” the Head Auror said sharply. “As much as this case has a personal meaning to you, don’t forget that you are investigating as an
“I agree. Perhaps a break and a meal will help you sort your thoughts out.” Before he could respond, she had dismantled his Privacy Spells and waved the server over. Deciding it was never worth arguing with Minerva McGonagall, he resigned himself to a lunch of chicken pie and pleasantries with his old headmistress.
“What happened here?” Scorpius asked curiously. His cousin’s office and lab were both meticulous most days. Something about tripping hazards around volatile potions, which made sense, but was also the reason Scorpius had never cared for potions. He couldn’t be bothered to keep things so clean.
Scorpius shook his head. “Not unless I can prove that the missing evidence would have changed the outcome of the case. I’ll worry about that later though. Right now, you need to get home.”
“You didn’t,” Draco groaned, as Harry sat down in his office yet again, the stack of papers Hassan had compiled for him in hand.
“It was about the Transfiguration attacks. It was disappointing to see that Mr Selpie would sink to such low tactics for petty revenge, he graduated only a few years ahead of you and was a bright student. The press didn’t mention who worked on the case, only that it was complicated. But I had complete faith that you’d figure it out.”
The receptionist bit his lip, shuffling about through the log book as if it would give him answers. Harry was considering asking for a supervisor when the receptionist jumped up suddenly.
“Very well. The court hearby rescinds the charge of attempted terrorism. As Chief Warlock, my recommendation is that the accused’s sentence be commuted to 15 years.”
Draco nodded. "You had a ceremony at their church, and a party to celebrate, because according to their religious beliefs, you and Camilla got married. In their eyes, you both are as good as husband and wife. To have that marriage recognised by their ministry, however, they would have had to complete a fair amount of documentation, especially since you're English. From what I gather, they were planning to do that at their own pace after the ceremony. To them, that didn't matter much. In fact, I'm willing to bet that if they hadn't planned to make you a co-owner of their shop, they wouldn't have bothered with the legal aspect at all."
“What changed?” Draco asked. Harry shrugged, not wanting to get into a detailed discussion about why school hadn’t been his priority as a teenager.
“The Wizengamot released Draco from Azkaban,” Teddy said simply. “He spent a week in St. Mungo’s, and now he’s living with Scorpius.”
He considered lying to her, but he couldn’t figure out what on earth he would say. Deciding he may as well be honest, he sighed “conspiracy theorists.”
“No thank you,” Harry said decisively. “I’ve already told you hundreds of times that I’m not interested in being set up with anyone.”
"Oh." She hesitated for a moment. "Oslo is nice. Is a big city. Many people. Lots of things to see."
Finally, Draco decided to return home, scared that he would never see his friend again. But when he got there, there was a wonderful surprise waiting for him. Harry had come home too, and was waiting for him!”
“Yeah, you should get going. Thanks for being there for me. Coming to the pub to meet my friends, and then sitting with me while I started panicking about my job. You really are a great guy.”
“You could always come back, you know. After he goes to sleep,” Harry said, hoping he didn’t sound too desperate. Draco looked surprised for a moment, but then a lazy grin spread across his face.
He stood there, gaping at the man, trying to think of when he had last felt proud of something he'd done. It had definitely been a while.
“I’m not so sure it would be. You only need people who could have Transfigured her into a Hippogriff. That might indicate someone with a good knowledge of Hippogriff anatomy, but generally anyone with a NEWT in Transfiguration could do it. Perhaps when you have more details about the suspect, I can create a more specific list for you. But even then, there’s no guarantee this person studied at Hogwarts or that they didn’t learn the necessary skills after graduating.”
The prayer didn't last long, though Harry was hyper aware of the fact that Camilla continued to hold his hand in front of the entire church. Finally the priest (was that what they called it?) touched both their heads (probably in some kind of blessing) and announced something to the church at large, which made everyone cheer. Deciding that it must be some kind of welcome, since no one else had come forward for the prayer, Harry smiled at all of them, feeling loved and warm.
"If you sent a letter, I don't think she'd burn it," Draco said carefully. "I can include it in the envelope with the contract if you want."
“Of course. It’s a butternut squash, with carrots and roasted bell peppers. One of my favourites. Shall I serve up a bowl for you?”
"We should keep up with Scorpius," Draco mumbled, hurrying after his son who looked very much like he wanted to reach over the security rope and pick up the dragon egg.
Before Harry could so much as nod, Draco had already walked off towards the hostess station. Deciding he might as well listen to his date, he finished off the last couple of bites of cream before joining Draco out front. He was once again surprised when Draco held the door open for him.
Scorpius smiled at that. Little-league Quodpot (and it’s slightly more popular counterpart, little-league Quidditch) was always adorable to watch. He made a mental note to ask his dad if he had ever played. He couldn’t quite remember, but he hoped he had.
If Harry was being honest, imagining having Draco home was a big part of the reason he hadn’t slept much the night before.
Malfoy snorted. “I don’t know which Healers you’ve spoken to recently, but it takes a while to gain the type of seniority that pays well. As for helping people, I’m sure everyone has that innate desire to make the world a better place. Training to become a Healer, and then actually doing the job, is difficult. You have to have more than a sense of decency to motivate you.”
Agent Eta laughed. “I know exactly who you’re talking about. Paranoid bastard. He means well though.”
Shaking all thoughts of his inheritance from his head, Scorpius walked up to number 27 and knocked smartly on the door. It wasn’t long before a gentleman in grey trousers and a yellow shirt answered the door.
“But of course that rat bastard wasn’t present enough in our relationship to understand that. He clearly didn’t give a shit about me.”
that. But that doesn’t mean we can avoid making them. If the people who care give up that responsibility, the choices fall into the hands of those who don’t. By doing this work, you’re making sure that the Ministry is following logic and research when deciding which budgets to cut, rather than arbitrarily slashing departments as they please.”
“That’s good to hear.” Harry paused to take a bite of his sandwich, and almost gagged on the disgusting taste. He ripped open the bag of crisps and shoved a couple in his mouth, glad for the salty taste. “Have you heard anything about who might be behind these attacks?”
“You know you can tell me anything. You don’t need to keep secrets, especially if you need help. That’s what tore our family apart the first time.”
Harry and Priscillia both started laughing; of course Draco would turn the five-year-old’s decorating skills back on Harry.
“I get that you’re angry, and confused, and hurt, Harry,” Teddy said evenly. “But this situation is too complicated to explain to you when you’re this worked up.”
“I mean, I’m not used to kids, but the real problem was that it was obvious right from the start how much you love him. It didn’t take long to figure out that you feel pretty similarly about his dad, and that’s when I realised I really did have no chance with you.”
“Yes, Mr. Taber, I hope you can. My name is Scorpius Greengrass, I’m here on official business from the Auror department. I’m here to inquire about a recent string of reports from your neighbours, who have been concerned on multiple occasions that you’re in distress.”
“I suggest you make yourself comfortable, Mr. Malfoy,” Adella chuckled, nodding approvingly at Scorpius’ gesture. “The mediwitch should be bringing lunch around for you soon, and I’ll come back to check on how you’re doing later in the afternoon.”
Scorpius had never seen his dad speechless until today. Harry opened and closed his mouth about three times, all the while looking like he was about to explode. Finally, he took a deep breath, and although he was still glaring at Scorpius, his voice was calm.
Harry slouched in his seat. "I don't want to upset her more or make this difficult. But I barely knew her for a couple of weeks. I'd rather not have to give her my entire Gringotts account if it can be helped."
“This morning? I haven’t seen today’s paper yet.” Draco glanced around, hoping someone might have left a copy on a nearby table, but he had no such luck.
Malfoy chuckled. “I was just looking for an empty examination room. There are usually a few near the Potions ward because the rate of potion-related accidents has been going down in recent years. It’s actually an interesting development; the Healers who studied it noticed that fewer people brew their own potions these days, which means more people are using products from licenced apothecaries. Which is great news for the apothecary industry, but it makes me wonder about people’s potions skills these days, if they don’t need it for…”
“Oh, how adorable!” Scorpius couldn’t help getting excited as it wandered slowly over to him, sniffing at the hem of his robes.
It took all of Draco’s will power to resist rolling his eyes. Instead, he sent the report off to the records department and made his way toward the door.
Agent Delta had known this conversation was coming, but that didn’t make it any easier. It was so tempting to beg and plead with Agent Eta and Agent Phi. Surely he could manage a romantic relationship alongside his work.
"Harry, do you think you're subconsciously getting yourself into these situations? Is there a part of you that just desperately wants to be married?"
“Yeah. The most unexpected part of this whole story, however, is that she’s started liking Hassan, and he likes her back. They’ve already started dating, and he told me he thinks she might be the one for him.”
“They’re mostly all here.” He let Harry believe that he was talking about the hospital staff. The truth was, many Unspeakable liaisons held high level positions in society that got them invited to these types of events. There was the Associate Editor of the
Harry’s heart was racing as he touched down at the edge of the park, Draco landing right behind him. They’d been flying for over an hour, racing each other around the grassy plains Harry had located on a map the night before. It had been ages since he’d flown like that and he couldn’t help grinning at Draco. Draco grinned back, waving his wand at his windswept hair to nudge it back into place.
“I guess they are,” Harry conceded. After showing Draco how to use the coffee machine, and producing two steaming mugs of coffee for them both, they joined Scorpius on the couch again. Just as the show was ending, Harry picked up the remote and switched the television off.
She nodded. "If sir is needing to send a letter, sir can give it to Pippy or to the reception desk. Pippy will be bringing mail whenever it arrives."
He replayed the conversation in his head, only to realise that he hadn’t actually agreed. Malfoy had just assumed he was amenable and ran off. He tried to squash the small part of him that found that level of confidence incredibly hot while debating whether he should actually show up for this date or not. The
“I only saw him in passing—he was asleep—but…” Scorpius sighed, unsure how to voice his feelings. “I need to get him out of there Teddy.”
They sat there for a while, watching the sun set, then rise again not long after, eating all the krumkakes, and sharing a thermos of coffee. They didn't talk much, Camilla asking a couple of questions about him here and there, but otherwise sitting quietly. Harry was really enjoying the sound of the waves on the lake, and the occasional calls from various wild animals. It was rare that he found peace and quiet like this back in London, and he intended to savour it.
He waved his wand at the door to let Bryan in, before stumbling out of bed and looking for his clothes. Bryan sauntered in, already dressed and looking alert, and plopped himself down on the edge of Harry’s bed.
"Thank you," he said, not paying her anymore attention as he made his way over to the desk. He was just opening the drawer when something else occurred to him.
Harry gulped angrily at his lemonade, thinking the effect might be a bit more intimidating if this was anything other than lemonade.
With a sigh, he pulled the stack of parchment towards him and started to write. He wrote his first letter and gave it to Pippy to be sent off with express Portkey post and then settled in to write the rest. Before long, he had sent letter making plans to meet the girls for lunch and Andromeda for dinner. She had been right in saying that his mother would have wanted them to know each other, and now that he really thought about it, he wanted that too.
"Draco, why don't you eat first? It must have been a long trip, you don't have to throw yourself into work right away."
“You may not have lost a relationship with her, but it’s still significant. You were still fresh from dealing with Laura’s betrayal when you got involved with Camilla, and then you were just fresh out of that heartbreak when you got married to Zare. You weren’t given the time to heal.”
“I resigned instead. Congratulations, you two are partners now. Though I’m sure they’ll split you both up as soon as they hire my replacement—married couples never do well as work partners.”
It had been a week since Draco had had lunch with McGonagall. He’d discharged the girl three days ago and spent the rest of his week cooped up in his office, contemplating how to catch the culprit. It had been peaceful work, but now was the time for urgency.
So far, he only had two plausible explanations for why Malfoy could be visiting the Unspeakables. Either he was making some kind of deal with them, or they were doing some kind of medical experiments. Of course, if it was experiments, it was possible that it was all completely ethical, or that it wasn’t being tested on humans at all. Harry had to concede that Hermione’s reasoning on that front made sense. From what Harry knew, Malfoy had kept his head held high and built a steady life as a Healer. He wouldn’t be up to anything nefarious. But
“So, I’m guessing it would be näive of me to assume you’re going to be in town for a while?” Draco asked, as they both got up and made their way toward the door.
“How is your patient? I read in the paper that the victim of the second Transfiguration attack is still here.”
“I believe my work here is also done,” Harrison said brusquely. “I will take care of the paperwork surrounding Mr. Malfoy’s release, and have the necessary documents owled over to you as soon as I can.”
When Draco stepped out of Harry’s Floo that evening, Harry was still sitting on the sofa where he’d left him last night. He looked adorably sleep-rumpled as he greeted Draco with a soft peck on the cheek. He hated to return such a soft gesture with bluntness, but he didn’t want to chicken out.
“I’m glad you’re going to be working at Hogwarts,” Luna said serenely as Draco sat next to her once again. “You’ll do a good job of dispelling the Wrackspurts in anxious students. You do remember how to deal with them, right?”
“So, are you going to tell me about what actually happened on your vacation or are we going to continue beating about the bush for another ten minutes?”
"I don't know where that is." Scorpius frowned, starting to calm down from his excitement. "Can we find it on the map, Papa?"
Draco nodded, and joined him. “Emmeril Goldhorn. We have to do a lot of his treatment while he’s asleep, because he won’t stop talking when he’s awake. Chatting with him has been interesting, though, he’s a very sharp guy. He’s in charge of the Ministry’s finances.”
“Sounds like you’re just creating more bureaucracy,” Draco pointed out. “I would be so frustrated to have to record every piece of mail I send.”
“Yeah, that would be great,” Scorpius agreed. Forgetting who he was talking to for a moment, he added “I’m sure Papa would love to see them too.”
"This looks like a pretty nice hotel," Bryan mused. "The nicer ones usually have common potions at the reception desk, and complimentary breakfast. I can go down and ask if you want?"
“Okay. I’m going to decant my Luminescence Solution and close up my office, and then go crash at your place.”
Just then, Draco walked back into the room, levitating a gold-rimmed glass of water. He set it down on a wooden coaster that matched the floors, and gestured at the sofa.
His dad nodded, contemplating his food. They continued to eat in silence for a bit, until his dad brought up the topic of Quidditch. The evening progressed pretty normally from there, but Scorpius couldn’t help thinking about the fact that his dad had been more receptive to talking about Draco. In fact, he’d seemed almost curious. He wondered as he made his way home that night if maybe he should bring up the topic more often. It was still an awkward subject, but maybe with time, it wouldn’t be.
"So?" Harry challenged, feeling upset that Bryan was acting like a fan instead of a friend. "Why do you care? You were across the ocean!"
“Yeah. You’ve been quite busy lately, haven’t you? Draco told me you’ve been stressed out, and you always look exhausted.”
Ron shook his head. “We’re still investigating. Our priority was turning the girl back into a human. It’s a complicated process, so we took her to St Mungos, but it took the Healers ages to figure it out. They kept insisting it was a Wheeze.”
Draco shrugged. “I wasn’t sure. Your friends seem like the type to set you up with the first available person they see.”
Harry’s jaw dropped. He stared at Draco, waiting for him to laugh and claim that he’d been pulling Harry’s leg, but when he didn’t, a little bubble of laughter errupted from Harry anyway.
Harry stood on unsteady feet and made his way over to the small porta-floo the hotel provided. Eternally grateful they'd ended up in a wizarding hotel, and moodily ignoring the warning message of additional charges for international calls, he flooed Draco's office.
Draco was spared from having to answer when Ron leaned over and handed him a small green box with a white triangle on it.
“Harry! What is this?” Draco demanded, stepping into the crowded pub. Harry had let him believe this was just going to be a regular pub night with friends, but clearly Draco had caught on to the fact that there were patented Weasley balloons dancing above the table, with a large cake right underneath.
Despite Teddy’s feigned nonchalance, Scorpius could tell that this had been bothering his cousin for a while.
“At the beginning, you were dating me because you were looking for information.” Harry paled at that, but Draco pressed on. “I’m not mad, Harry. I just… I want to know. When did you stop spying on me, and when did you start actually liking me? I mean…
Scorpius nodded, reaching forward and pulling his dad into a hug. As upset as they all were, Scorpius knew as he made his way down to the floo, that things were going to be alright.
“Did I ever play little league?” Scorpius asked, suddenly remembering his thoughts from earlier that afternoon. He’d been a reserve chaser at Hogwarts, but he still couldn’t remember playing before then. He looked up at his dad, who had a sad look on his face.
senior correspondent, Rita Skeeter, Potter's business partner and right-hand man, Michael Corner, revealed that not all is as it seems in our hero's head.
“I hate him,” Harry said bitterly. “I was so in love. After all the shit that had happened in my life, it seemed like things were finally going right when I married him, when I brought you both home. I finally felt safe. I
Finally, he spotted the sign, held by a small but muscular man in a white shirt and linen pants. He made his way over, pointing at the sign, then at himself.
Without waiting for a reply, he ran off in the direction of the Aurors, and what looked suspiciously like a Bicorn. Dammit.
Harry laughed, even though seeing the toy reminded him of Camilla. Not that he had stopped thinking about her very much on his trip home. He'd sent Priscillia an owl from the international portkey station in Oslo, requesting the next possible appointment with Draco. He knew she'd never forgive him, but they needed to get divorced as soon as possible.
Harry considered the question. His first instinct was to reassure Draco that of course he’d help him, but it wasn’t exactly true. Harry had been furious when he’d walked in to find Draco here the week before, and if it had been Draco who’d reached out instead of Scorpius, Harry would probably have slammed the floo closed and never spoken to him again.
Not that the flying had been the only part of that day that he’d enjoyed. It was proving easier than he’d expected, though just as enjoyable, to charm Harry. Draco had no problem admitting that Harry was attractive, especially after he’d stood up to the cafeteria witch on Draco’s behalf. That encounter had surprised Draco the most. If Harry thought Draco was up to something, why had he come to his defense? It was clear proof, in Draco’s opinion, that Harry was becoming more comfortable around him.
“Papa! Oh no, you’re wet, but you’re not wearing trunks!” Scorpius called, trying to paddle himself out of Harry’s arms and over to his father. Trying his best not to laugh at Draco’s expression, Harry towed Scorpius back to the deck and helped him climb up next to his father.
“Dad doesn’t know you were released,” he admitted. “In fact, he doesn’t even know that your case was reopened. He’s still pretty angry.”
“Thank Merlin he wasn’t, but what if he was? I don’t wanna risk it dad, don’t worry about cooking for us.”
He wandered all the home decoration stores in his area (mostly muggle, since he was still being hounded by the press in wizarding establishments) looking for ideas. He walked through multiple display areas, all of which looked comfortable and inviting, but none of which really
“They seem very familiar with each other,” his papa said. Scorpius nodded, stepping forward to claim the chair Teddy had just vacated.
"We were probably too drunk or too horny to go all the way back to the hostel," Bryan said sagely, still squinting up at Harry. "Probably the latter."
Something was poking Harry in the ribs. He tried to shove it away, but his arms felt like they were being held down by leaded weights. He cracked an eye open, and immediately regretted it. Bright light flooded under his eyelid, which he snapped shut with a groan.
Ron slid into the booth next to Harry with a loud groan. Hermione gave him a sympathetic pat on the back, as if she already knew what was ailing him. Harry sometimes wondered if they had a Legilimency connection to each other, since there was no way she could actually know what it was—Ron had just arrived at the pub straight from work, and all Hermione had received was an owl saying “held up on a case, gonna be late”. Figuring it was a married person thing, Harry turned back to the basket of chips he was sharing with Neville.
He had to get to the hospital and check on Goldhorn, but he was also itching to figure this case out. Worrying Harry with his suspicions probably wasn’t the right way to go right now. He had to calm him down.
There was something about Draco enjoying his cooking that suddenly made Harry feel proud. Hoping he didn’t have some sappy look on his face, he turned his attention back to the stove, giving the stroganoff he was making a good stir.
The receptionist frowned. “I, um… I’m not sure about Healer Malfoy’s appointments,” he said slowly. “Perhaps if you told me what it was for, I could refer you to another Healer?”
Draco couldn’t help grinning. “Harry paid me this morning. It’s been so long, I just had to get my wand.”
Leaning against the door frame, he contemplated his options. If he was being really honest with himself, he didn’t want to search Draco’s flat. Draco no longer felt like a rival that Harry had to get ahead of anymore. That nagging feeling that he was up to something seemed to have dissolved at some point over the past week.
Harry's travel agent had told him it would be hot. He'd warned him to brush up on his extra strength sun repelling charms and to bring only light clothes. But nothing could have prepared Harry for
“He asked me to give you this note,” Draco said, handing Harry a folded sheet of paper. Still smiling, Harry opened it to find a short but heartfelt message.
"Yes please," Harry sighed, relieved that everything seemed so easy. He grabbed an unfamiliar pair of pants from the corner of the bed and tossed them to Bryan. His friend—boyfriend? lover?—stood up and put them on. Harry watched as he made his way around the bed, and then flinched as Bryan slipped on something and crashed onto the bed.
“I’m not stalking him!” Harry insisted, folding his arms across his chest. Why couldn’t his friends understand that this was serious?
“Watching Harry grow up taught me to never discount luck, both good and bad,” McGonagall mused. “I suggest you do the same, since you’re now dating him.”
Harry wondered if Draco actually knew what Luna was talking about, or if he was just humouring her. He glanced at Hermione, hoping for a clue—if Flinitores were real, she’d know what they were talking about. She seemed just as confused as Harry, however.
“Well, your papa and I were planning to go out and have some fun. Would you rather get ready and come with us, or would you rather stay here and watch more Telly?”
Harry sat back and simply enjoyed the view, taking the opportunity to ask his host questions as they occurred to him. As they drove, Hassan explained to Harry that the magical and muggle community were not as segregated here as they were in most other countries. While the muggles, or moldus as Hassan insisted on calling them, were not quite aware of the existence of magic, they didn't follow all the guidelines of the international statute of secrecy.
So does that mean that the chosen one is ill? Delbert Elderberry, 34th seat in the Wizengamot and representative of North Lancashire, thinks so. "The poor boy's been through so much. Losing his parents at a young age, then fighting you-know-who in some rather legendary battles, and finally building such a large empire of companies so quickly. I'm sure it's all gone to his head. It must be the stress, or the trauma of it all. We've seen it in the courts; victims of great tragedies like that start to believe some weird things. I definitely think he could benefit from regular visits to a mind healer."
“I’ve been dating him as a way to keep an eye on him. He kept sneaking around, trying to uncover my work. I figured courting him would be a good way to keep him away from my work and to control how much information he had. But recently, it’s become more and more obvious that he’s no longer suspicious of me. He’s dating me because
He didn’t know how to say all that to Harry though. As much as he’d fallen head-over-heels for him, their relationship was still relatively new. It was a discussion they would certainly have one day, but it didn’t matter right now. They had all the time in the world to figure it out.
It was good of you to come to the closing performance last week. Pansy hadn’t told me that she and Weasley had invited you so I hope you’ll forgive my initial shock when I saw you backstage after the final curtain. I also want to apologize if that headline in
“Harry, I have to warn you that travelling with a five-year-old is very different to travelling with adults. Scorpius gets tired easily, and he’s quite picky about certain things.”
“Er, Scorpius asked me to come… um, to heat up a casserole.” Merlin, he sounded stupid even to his own ears.
"They generally need to be reserved in advance, and there is a fee to book them, but the group who was using them today cancelled at the last minute. Would you like to reserve it?"
“Let’s get started.  A long, long time ago, there were two young dragons, Harry and Draco, who were good friends.”
Draco’s eyes widened. “Yeah, I think we can pass on the live dragons. Just the museum sounds great. We’ll see you in the morning then.”
“I think that’s a very good idea,” Draco replied, and once again grabbing both their hands, Scorpius led them into the auditorium. It hadn’t filled up yet, and so they got good seats right at the front. Scorpius gazed up at the lit stage, chattering away as he wondered what the story would be about. It wasn’t long before the room filled up and the lights dimmed, putting the focus on the stage.
When an owl dropped off a parcel the next morning, containing a collection of photographs and handwritten recipes from his dad, Scorpius was sure that with time his dad would be open to accepting Draco back into his life. As he slipped the package into his desk drawer, Scorpius’ mind was already forming a plan. He couldn’t wait to get started.
Before they knew it the show was over, and another one was starting. Rather than animated humans, this show’s main characters seemed to be a group of birds. Before he could get drawn into the story, Harry stood up, and Draco followed him.
Over the last two weeks, when he hadn’t been spending time with Harry, Draco had been obsessing over the Transfiguration attacks. The only thing that linked all the cases together was the weirdly specific attack and the culprit’s magical signature. Draco was intimately familiar with that magical signature by now, having spent hours reversing their magic in an effort to heal his patients. So to feel it here at the St Mungo’s charity ball could only mean one thing—
“How did you know I was assigned those cases?” Malfoy asked, frowning at Harry. “It wasn’t in either of the articles.”
"Well, I thought that Norway sounded like a nice place to visit. I'm going for a whole month, though I might stay longer if I really like it."
Harry nodded, trying to focus his attention back on the conversation. Of course he liked helping people.
Scorpius nodded. “The steps for the Polyjuice are modified. The numbers in the margins are calculations for how long a dose from each modification would last.”
“I wish he’d told me,” his dad said softly, a single tear falling as he did. “I can’t believe he didn’t trust me to keep you both safe. I would have done anything to keep my family safe. I still would.”
“No, another Healer did it, but it didn’t seem to work at first. She wasn’t able to speak until Malfoy came and fixed something. All the mediwixen and Trainee Healers seemed to move much more efficiently after he showed up, too.”
“I’m going to my room,” he mumbled, before storming up the stairs. He heard Teddy calling after him, but ignored him in favour of slamming his door and flopping down on his bed. Even though it was still the middle of the day, Harry felt drained. He vaguely registered the sound of Teddy leaving, but even though his body felt like lead, his mind was racing through everything he’d just learned.
“Whatever you’ve been doing, as long as you’ve kept your wits about you, and your head held high, she’d be happy. It was your father who sneered at working class people. Your mother just wanted you to be happy.”
Merlin, flirting with Potter was fun! It didn’t hurt that Draco had been crushing on him since they were teenagers. But this was for work. He was, after all, a professional.
Teddy was silently rubbing Harry’s back, but it wasn’t comforting. He shrugged his godson’s hand off and stood up once more.
They both laughed at that, and Bryan finally sat up as well. Harry was suddenly quite aware of the fact that they were both stark naked, and he couldn't help glancing at Bryan's body in interest.
He could see the cogs working in Potter’s brain. Clearly Potter was trying to find information about Draco. Dating him would be the perfect way to not only divert him from the hospital, but also to keep an eye on him and whatever he was investigating. Draco was about to congratulate himself on his brilliant plan when he noticed four Aurors step out of the Floo herding a large animal that he couldn’t see clearly from this angle. This wasn’t going to be good.
“That’s what I’m hoping to find in the files I pulled. It feels important, and four years of being an Auror has taught me to trust my intuition.”
“Papa,” he exclaimed, rushing forward to hug his father. His papa’s eyes widened as he approached, but then someone caught his arm and pulled him back. Scorpius whipped his head around to find Adella raising an eyebrow at him.
“Good afternoon everyone!” the same wizard from before called out. “Welcome to story time! Today’s story is called ‘Love among the dragons’
"Thank you for this, Draco. If it wasn't for you I'd probably still be stuck with Laura, let alone all the other marriages I’ve ended up in since then."
“Draco, you kept saying that your mother wouldn’t be proud of you, and that I wouldn’t want you in Teddy’s life… I hope you haven’t done anything illegal to get that money.”
“You didn’t. Before I adopted you, you were raised in relative poverty. There wasn’t enough money for a training broom, or the registration fees. By the time I met you, you were just on the verge of being too old for little-league, so I just taught you myself.”
Harry cast another Cooling Charm as he crept down the hallway, checking every so often to make sure his feet were covered by the invisibility cloak. It was bloody hot under the thing. He hadn’t noticed this in Hogwarts’ draughty corridors, but now that he was in the bowels of the Ministry, the thick cloak was cooking him alive. Magical Maintenance was probably too chicken to come here due to rumours of Unspeakable experiments being done on unsuspecting employees who wandered too deep into their labyrinth.
“I don’t know if you remember that I cleaned up a filing cabinet that was knocked over at work a while ago?”
He couldn’t help wondering how different some of these details might be if his Papa hadn’t been arrested all those years ago. If his dad hadn’t tried to wipe any memory of Draco out of the house. He stared at the fridge as he tried to compose his thoughts, fully aware of the awkward silence that was settling over the table.
“It’s odd how Smith brings out that quality in people,” Harry sighed. His expression suddenly turned stern. “Though you also shouldn’t have provoked him. I changed your name for a reason, don’t go reminding people that you were once a Malfoy. It just puts a target on your back.”
“I wouldn’t say I really suffered here,” Harry pointed out. “I barely knew Zare. Hell, I didn’t even know her name until you told me just now.”
“We’d definitely be dead by now if it weren’t for her, let alone passing school. When I think about it, I used to be pretty invested in school, especially in the first couple of years. I spent the summer before first year reading all my textbooks because magic was such a fascinating new concept to me.”
Not only had Draco given in, he’d changed something to foil the criminals. Harry didn’t quite understand that, but it had to do with potions, and no one knew potions better than Teddy. Except, perhaps, Draco…
Malfoy seemed frustrated today. He was walking purposefully, his lime green robes billowing out behind him. One thing Harry
He spared a moment to feel flattered that Draco trusted him enough to bring him here, before it hit him that he was
“True love doesn’t have to be a romantic thing,” Draco said, sitting back against the pillows and resuming his stroking of Scorpius’ hair. “I learned that the day Scorpius was born.”
“You look great,” he said, giving his date a reassuring smile. “I’m excited for you to meet my friends.”
Scorpius sighed, burying his face in his hands. She was right, but that didn’t make it any easier to face the fact that his father was a criminal. He looked up when she let out a soft “oops”, just in time to see her pick up the pictures of Harry and Scorpius. They must have slipped out of the back of the journal.
“I think… I love you too. Both of you,” he said breathlessly. There was a moment where everything seemed to stop except Draco’s smile, and then Draco was kissing him, and it felt so
“I’ll talk to him when he gets home,” Draco sighed. “I can’t believe he got so angry over a new recipe.”
Harry shook his head to rid himself of the ridiculous direction his thoughts were taking. Of course he wasn’t falling for Malfoy. He was probably just caught up in the nerves and emotions of dating someone for the first time—he hadn’t realised that pretending could be as frightening as he’d always imagined the real thing to be. He was nothing if not a Gryffindor, though. He could deal with frightening things. It couldn’t hurt to see Draco a few more times, just to be absolutely sure that he wasn’t up to anything. In fact, it was Harry’s duty, if anything.
“But I found the trick to keeping sane in this dusty old house,” Mr. Taber rattled on. “It was my granddaughter’s idea, actually, and a genius one indeed. I brought home a rescue crup a few weeks back, lively little thing, and demands all sorts of attention at all hours of the day. In fact, I’m surprised the little bugger has left us alone for so long.”
Harry wandered through the sterile hallways of St Mungo’s, following the signs for the cafeteria. He’d learned his lesson about trying to find Draco the last few times he’d come to the hospital, and owled ahead, letting him know that he wanted to take him to lunch. Draco had replied with a hasty note that he was too busy, but Harry had insisted, and they’d compromised by agreeing to have lunch in the hospital’s cafeteria.
He returned to work the next day in high spirits. His dad had still seemed nervous the night before, but the atmosphere in the house was no longer tense. They’d enjoyed dinner together while Scorpius had eagerly complained to him about everything that had gone wrong with the fire, after which they’d settled down to watch crime dramas late into the night with a large box of chocolate biscuits his dad had bought earlier in the day.
Harry nodded before getting up to look for the salt and pepper. He peeked into the fridge again on his way back to his seat, and was glad to find some cheddar as well.
Of course Harry was comfortable on a first name basis with their old professor. Though he supposed it could only help—he’d have to get used to it too if he was to work with her.
“I’m sorry I ran away last night, Dad. I should have stayed and dealt with the issue at hand, instead of leaving you in the lurch like that.”
He waited patiently as Harry made the connection, his face lighting up when he did. Draco loved how expressive Harry was. It was part of what made him such a genuine person.
Deciding to ignore the personal notes for the time being, Scorpius spent the morning transcribing the potions instructions and the random numbers onto separate parchments. He was hoping to stop by Teddy’s office during his lunch break—his cousin was Head of the Ministry potion’s lab, and was bound to understand what the modifications to the original recipe would do. Scorpius couldn’t show him the actual book though, since Teddy couldn’t be called in as a consultant on a case that was technically closed.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to keep calm. He hoped Bryan would still want a divorce now that he knew Harry was famous.
Scorpius was secretly relieved when his dad woke up the next morning—when he’d found the bottle of calming draught in the kitchen, it had been shockingly empty, which had made him worry about when his dad would wake up. Unfortunately, his dad seemed to remember exactly what they’d spoken about the night before, and was acting oddly evasive. He merely nodded at Scorpius, ignoring the pancakes his son had made and making his way upstairs. Scorpius heard his bedroom door close and then didn’t hear from him again before he had to leave for work. Leaving a sticky note with a smiley face on it next to his dad’s pancakes, Scorpius shrugged on his Auror robes and made his way to work.
Harry considered that. It must really be a depressing job to have to break people up all the time. He wondered what Draco thought of having to have done it four times for him, but he was too scared to ask.
"A little bit. But I know we're both going to be happier when we find our true loves, so it's okay."
Teddy nodded. “I used to fly with them whenever I was home from school. All the Weasleys are good, but they were both wicked fast. I think Harry’s slowed down a bit these days, but he still maneuvers a broom as if it was his own limb. Draco used to fly like that too, all graceful and powerful.”
? You’re the perfect volunteer sir, because today, I’ll need both of you to act out our dragons! Please, come over here and pick your dragon wings.”
“Are you going back because of your new patient? What’s his name again?” Harry asked, sitting down on a well worn couch.
Harry remained in that corridor for a while after Malfoy disappeared through the inky black door, wondering what business a Healer could possibly have with the Department of Mysteries. He kept pondering the mystery as he made his way back up to his own office, fully aware that if he was late, Hermione would once again lecture him until his ears went numb. He didn’t mind her being his boss—if anyone was suited to being head of the Ministry of Magic’s Ethical Review Office, it was her—but he knew she sometimes worried that the other employees thought she was favouring him.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at that. It had always been clear that Draco was a wonderful father, but this trip had served to show him exactly how close the relationship between the two Malfoys really was.
They placed their orders, before Scorpius went back to nodding sympathetically as Teddy complained about how much he hated the management aspect of his job.
Draco nodded. “It’s very sudden; I was surprised that they would write on a Saturday, telling me to start on Monday. But they have student apartments right next to the school in which they’re offering me a small private room, and since I have the money now, I’d better do it.”
They were both crying by now, the weight of everything they’d been through crashing down on them. Harry let go of Draco’s hand, shifting closer to put an arm around his waist, and Draco pressed his face into Harry’s shoulder, the two men seeking a comfort in each other that they’d craved for years. Draco spared a thought for how natural it felt to curl up with Harry like this, how right it felt to be back in his arms. He felt a fresh wave of tears hit him as he realised that he’d missed out on 15 years of this, just because of his stubbornness.
Because when it boiled down to it, that was exactly what his father had done. He’d been part of a scheme trying to make it look like Harry Potter had murdered the Minister for Magic. How had Draco been able to do that to Harry? They’d seemed so in love back then, and by all accounts that Scorpius had ever heard, they had been. So when had Draco decided to betray Harry like that?
That just made Scorpius feel incredibly guilty. He didn’t want to be the reason his dad got addicted to potions, but now that they were actually talking about his papa, there were so many more things he wanted to ask, and to say. But the man’s eyes were drooping, and he knew that within minutes his dad would be asleep. Admitting defeat, he leaned over and gave his dad a kiss.
"Um, I don't think that's right for me," Harry said quickly. "What about this?" he said, grabbing at another random flyer out of the collection Hassan had put together for him. His host gave him a searching look, before turning his attention to whatever Harry was showing him. Harry wasn't sure what it was for, but as Hassan started explaining which museums were most popular, Harry forgot all about it.
“We’ll see about that. Personally, I believe that you can get anything to give up if you’re stubborn enough.”
"Sorry, this my Pappa," she said hastily, before saying something to her father, in a clear attempt to calm him down. After a minute of back and forth between them, her father stepped back and gestured for Harry to come in, slamming the door behind him. Harry stood where he was, shooting confused glances at Camilla as her father circled him, clearly sizing him up. Finally, the man faced Harry and started to speak. Harry listened politely, and thankfully Camilla hurried to translate as soon as he was done.
"No one seemed to speak English!" Harry said defensively. "I thought it was some kind of prayer ceremony, they were being so nice!"
“He mentioned that,” Harry admitted. “I didn’t realise it was so bad that you can’t even have salt and pepper.”
"We fought against Voldemort," he said quietly. He was relieved to see that they relaxed at his statement.
"Crap, mom's gonna flip, this was the one thing I promised her I wouldn't do here,"  Bryan cried. "Fuck, Harry, I can't be married! I'm only twenty-one!"
He looked up as Draco walked back into the room. His tie had been loosened and he was no longer wearing shoes—Harry smiled at the sight of little Nifflers dotting Draco’s dark blue socks. Despite his relaxed look, Draco was still devastatingly attractive, and Harry couldn’t help admiring his long legs as he walked over to the bar cart in the corner.
“Exactly! I was wondering if I should go with house colours, but in a way that feels so childish. I saw a farmhouse theme in a magazine that looked nice, but it seemed a bit weird for a flat in the middle of the city.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to blush, confirming what Draco already knew—the house had been redecorated in anger. Not wanting to upset Harry on their first day of living together again, he quickly changed the topic.
"Yeah, she said you have one a few doors down from mine. It should be keyed to your magical signature, so you can just go right up."
"Okay, what's the problem?" Draco asked, popping another chocolate into his mouth and sitting up straight.
Draco had been alerted of the case because of how high-profile it was, which was lucky, because the magic here was incredibly complex—most Urgent Care Healers wouldn’t have been able to manage it. Even Draco could admit that he was struggling, and he was probably the most skilled at Transfiguration in the whole building. He needed to consult a true expert, but talking to the only one who would even deign to give him the time of day was a rather intimidating prospect.
Surprised at this new concept, yours truly decided to do some research. Renowned mind healer and researcher Cletus Rook, confirmed that asexuality is something he's seen before. "It's not common," he said thoughtfully, "but we don't know much about it, or why it happens. I've had students propose research projects to look into it, see if it's some kind of neurological defect, or the result of some kind of blood curse. The weird thing is that it's been mentioned in muggle healing literature as well, though bless their souls, they do their best to be optimistic and complimentary about everything, so they've just chalked it up to an identity and a natural occurrence. They're very nit-picky about their definitions too; to them it's the fact of not being attracted to people in general, rather than just not wanting sex. Either way, they're quite limited in their understanding of the human body. I don't know how it can be considered natural for a young, healthy man to not want sex."
“I’ll check on you tomorrow,” Draco promised. Harry nodded, and with that, Draco turned and stepped into the Floo.
Draco, of course, was not surprised with the way his own living room looked, and immediately wandered out of the room, leaving Harry standing awkwardly by the fireplace. There weren’t any pictures on the mantle, which made Harry wonder about Draco’s friends and family. He didn’t talk about anyone in his life, and he’d even mentioned at the gala that he’d lost touch with his friends after school.
Scorpius nodded. He hoped he wouldn’t end up this lonely. He frowned as his thoughts strayed to his dad, who had been single for so long. Of course, he’d been raising Scorpius to keep himself busy (and even Scorpius could admit he hadn’t made that easy), but now that he was an adult, Scorpius didn’t need Harry tending to him at all hours of the day. He was starting to realise that he didn’t even know what his dad did all day.
Putting on a sad expression, Harry flapped his way to the side of the stage, leaving a sad looking Draco standing behind.
“A call just came in for a robbery. It's a pretty routine case, but the name on the file… well, it’s my ex. Things ended really awkwardly between us, and I really don’t want to have to go to his place and lift magical signatures. Could you
Hermione chuckled, leaning into Ron. “Yeah, Ron’s right. Why don’t you take up knitting or something?”
Anyway, if you wanted to see about having a go with him, I understand if you’d rather not complicate things by being seen with me again.
“You know that’s not true. Agent Phi was the one who found the connection between the first two patients, and they also gave you the financial records that the third victim was responsible for.”
still exist, they were just empty. He quickly rectified that by submitting the transfer request, and after removing enough money for the day’s errands and setting a few other financial affairs in order, he made his way down the street to Ollivander’s. It was now owned by his niece, who barely seemed to know who Draco was and was happy enough to sell him a beautiful chestnut and unicorn hair wand. Brandishing this beauty, he walked into the small cafe that the girls had chosen for lunch.
"They not here," she whispered, before moving forward and capturing his lips again. Realising she was absolutely right, he kissed her back.
“He didn’t seem to want to talk about it. But whatever happened, it seemed intense. I just wanted to make sure you were okay.”
Harry spent the following week wandering around his empty new apartment, trying to figure out how to fill it up. He had never really developped his own personal style. After the war, he’d been living between the Burrow and Grimmauld place, until he’d married Laura and they’d bought their London townhouse. He’d entrusted all the decorating to her then, and as a result, he’d never had the chance to figure out exactly what
the next day. I've even started trying to wear disguises when I go out nowadays. I'm very familiar with a decoy mustache, but your idea of a decoy date is intriguing. I must say, I very much like the idea of this
He had barely stepped out of the confines of the air conditioned airport for a minute—keeping his eyes peeled for a sign with his name on it that indicated his host was here to pick him up—yet he was already drenched in sweat. He was tempted to point his wand down his throat and cast an aguamenti, despite Flitwick's repeated warnings all throughout his Hogwarts years to never point your wand at yourself, especially down your throat.
“You sound like you have a really sad story about your parents. Did you fall out with them or something?”
Unable to bear the disappointed look on his face, Harry flagged down an attendant who was walking by them.
“Aw, that’s rough. I’m sorry to hear that,” Bryan said tactfully, though somehow, he didn’t sound very sorry at all. He patted Harry on the back, but he didn’t lower his hand afterwards, instead resting it on Harry’s shoulder.
His expression hardened as he continued talking. Scorpius could now see the anger Teddy and his Papa had mentioned.
“Little-league pitches are usually quite small though,” Teddy pointed out. “I used to think Niffler Downs was huge when I was five, but I just walked past it a few weeks ago and it’s tiny. You could probably score by throwing the quaffle from the opposite hoops.”
Agent Delta opened their mouth to argue, but the words wouldn’t come. Agents Eta and Phi were making logical arguments. But Agent Delta was learning now that matters of the heart didn’t quite follow logic. There was nothing Agent Delta could say that would convince them.
It's here! This work is actually part of a series, and you can now read the first part (along with art!), which actually inspired this work! Thanks so much for reading!
He snorted as he saw the contents. He was sure he could come up with a better gift for Draco than a pack of bubblegum. But as he noticed the pleased smile on Draco’s face, probably from being included in the group, Harry realised that it didn’t really matter. He’d already given Draco his heart. There couldn’t be a better gift than that.
"Yes, we hear about war there. Pappa ask, which side they on?" She sounded hesitant, as if she really didn't want to be asking. Harry had a horrible moment where he wondered if this family had been Voldemort sympathisers.
"You fight too?" she asked, reaching out to take his hand in hers when he nodded. This really hadn't been the type of conversation he had been imagining when he'd asked her out this morning.
“No one can see the future, Papa,” he said reassuringly. “Hindsight may be 20/20, but in the moment you can only do your best. I know it took a while, but things worked out in the end, didn’t they?”
“I have my ways,” he said mysteriously. He glanced around the room, spotting Granger and Weasley standing by one of the ballroom’s massive windows. There were a few other people he recognised around the room but none were nearly as compelling to talk to as Harry.
“He insists on it, and it’s hard to argue with him,” Draco said quickly. “I’ve told him numerous times that we can share the bed—it’s large enough for two people. Or I suggested we alternate, and take turns sleeping on the sofa. Heck, he could even put a second bed in there, there’s enough room. But the stubborn boy just won’t see reason!”
“I am quite cold,” he agreed. Scorpius suddenly realised that he was still wearing the standard issue Azkaban robes. They looked worn out, and if they could barely keep his father warm in the middle of the hospital, he had no idea how useful they would have been out in the middle of the sea. Acting on autopilot, Scorpius removed his heavy red Auror robe and stepped forward to drape it around his father’s shoulders. He was suddenly glad that he’d been planning to go in to work after the court hearing
“I still need to build up a case, and probably find him a defence lawyer. He didn’t have one last time, so I want someone good.”
“Scorpius, you need to calm down. You just barged your way into Harry’s private room and now you won’t stop talking. I need you to take some deep breaths, sweetheart.”
"Oh, well I... thank you, Harry, that was thoughtful of you. I guess I should get Scorpius upstairs and changed then."
Draco stared into his water glass, wondering how he could admit to McGonagall that he wasn’t dating Harry at all. He’d thought she would be the best person to turn to for advice, but now that it was time, he couldn’t even bring himself to speak.
“No, I’m not,” Ron agreed. “Which is why I was relieved when they called Malfoy in. He may have been a git in school, but as soon as he showed up everything started moving so much more efficiently.”
He resumed his seat at the dining table once he'd collected parchment and ink, and the paper that seemed to have upset Harry so much. Draco flipped it open, curious to see what they'd written about Corner's arrest. He was surprised to find that the article on the front page didn't mention Corner once. He flipped through quickly and found a short article on the fourth page in the business section about how he'd been arrested for fraud. It sounded like an interesting scheme, but Draco couldn't help flipping back to the front to see the article about Harry.
Personally, Harry thought stealing in a hospital was an awful thing to do, but then again, he wasn’t very fond of stealing no matter where he was.
“Could you guys give us a moment?” Harry asked, when Bryan was done at the counter. The other nodded and turned away.
"Thanks, Draco," Harry said, getting up from his seat and shaking his hand. "This is the second time you're saving my arse."
As had become his habit the past few days, Draco turned to stare out the window, allowing his thoughts to drift. The sky behind the London skyline was a beautiful blue. He couldn’t help thinking that this would be a perfect day to go flying.
experimenting with them, based on what was in his journal. For what must have been the millionth time today, Scorpius wondered what use Silverthorn would have had for a modified polyjuice that didn’t last as long as usual.
Almost as if she could hear his thoughts, Harrison stood up and started asking Teddy questions, in an effort to direct his spiel towards the case, and away from the regional source of Knotgrass. Under Harrison’s guidance, Teddy’s testimony became more concise, and Scorpius was relieved to see many of the members listening attentively, now that the average person could actually understand what he was saying. Within a few concise sentences, Teddy confirmed that the potion in the vial matched Draco’s notes and that the notes had designed a potion that wore off faster.
“I’m not worried about the spoon,” Draco said lightly. He pulled a quill out of his robe pocket and Transfigured it into an elaborately engraved spoon. “And this soup will be quite filling, there’s no need for bread with it.”
He shifted forward to capture Draco’s lips fully, and it was everything he’d ever wanted. He moaned softly against Draco’s lips, before he felt something move next to his hand.
Harry sighed. "Well, it's done, and I'm married, for the fourth time now. Are you able to help me with the fourth divorce?"
"Thankfully it was quite easy, Bryan didn't want anything from you and I assumed you don't want anything from him. We've filed the papers, and it's going to take about a week for them to go through. You'll have to stay in the country until then, but it doesn't necessarily have to be in Vegas. He said he was returning to the hostel he has been staying. The poor kid just seemed relieved that his mother wasn't going to find out about this whole affair."
Shaking himself out of his thoughts, he marched over to the floo and called his dad, telling him Teddy was unwell and Scorpius was sending him home. Harry seemed thrilled at the idea of having his godson over for the day, and even passed Scorpius a bag of Liquorice Wands to replace the Pepper Imps. After ending the connection on the floo call, Scorpius sat down to work again. Unfortunately, in the two days he’d been manning the emergency floo, two new cases had landed on his desk. He scowled at them, before putting the journal back in it’s locked drawer and turning his attention to the one marked “priority 2” which meant it was important, but not drop-everything-and-take-a-whole-raid-team urgent.
It was a simple enough case, and after having lifted the magical signature of the thief and taken down a detailed description of the heirloom, he was able to be back in the office within half an hour. Another half an hour later, the magical signature was submitted to the forensics lab, the item description had been given to the rare artefacts lab, and his reports were complete. With a relieved sigh, he pulled out his father’s old journal once more.
“Harry!” Harry called out, cupping the edge of the wings to his mouth. Draco smiled at him from the side of the stage, clearly trying not to laugh at all Harry’s antics.
And so, Scorpius sat down in the spectator’s gallery, worry gnawing at him about where his father might stay, and anxiety radiating through him at the possibility that his father might not even be released today. What if they sent him back? Would he be able to handle it?
"Actually, most wizards in England don't know how to drive," Harry said conversationally, sitting down on the right side and feeling rather odd. "Usually only muggles drive."
“Fish, Scorpius, not fishes. Where do you see fish?” Draco asked, cocking his head at the wall. It appeared to be a mural of enormous flowers in a field, but after a moment of looking, Harry saw it. Getting closer to the wall, he could see that each flower was made of a bunch of smaller images, and the one right in front of them was made of small little fish.
“The Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee had an unusually high post budget this quarter. They probably have staff who are sending and receiving personal mail at the office, but their mail records are such rubbish that we’d never know for sure. That’s my job for this afternoon, to create a usable set of records for their post.”
"Draco," Harry interrupted. "Why don't Scorpius and I go do something fun while you and Bryan figure things out? You have all my information anyway, I trust you to represent me, and that way Scorpius won't be sitting here getting bored all afternoon."
“No, that’s not what I meant. Stay here, in America, with me. I was planning to go to San Francisco tomorrow, you should come with me.”
“Greengrass!” They all jumped at the sound of Head Auror Clearwater’s commanding voice. “I just wanted to tell you to take the rest of the day off if you need it,” she said. “Spend it with your father.”
“I’ll make you a deal,” he said, offering her his folder. “I have this case that I really don’t want, and you have that case that you really don’t want. How about we switch?”
“Would you like a drink?” Draco offered, grabbing another gold-rimmed glass. Harry contemplated the offer. He could stay and have a drink or two with Draco. If he played his cards right, maybe he’d be invited to stay the night. That would certainly give him ample opportunity to look around.
“Thank you, Head Auror,” Harrison said as the Head Auror made her way back to her seat. “As the evidence clearly demonstrates, Draco Malfoy was coerced. It was under duress that he brewed Polyjuice Potion for the group. However, further analysis of evidence item number 26 has revealed that Mr. Malfoy modified the potion in an attempt to thwart the assasination attempt. To explain the logistics of the potions modification, I’d like to call Mr. Edward Lupin, Master Potioneer and Head of the Ministry’s Potions division, to the stand.”
It had been jarring, to say the least, when his Monitoring Spells had alerted him to the fact that Potter was asking for him. When Potter’s appointment request had arrived last night, he’d intercepted it from patient relations and sent back a refusal. He’d been hoping that was enough, but clearly Potter was determined. Obviously the poor receptionist had neither known how to contact Draco nor redirect Potter, and so Draco had been forced to come down and diffuse the situation himself.
“It won’t work,” Agent Eta said sadly, as if they knew exactly what Agent Delta was thinking. “You don’t like lying. Your guilt will eat away at your relationship. Either that, or he’ll compromise you. It’s a recipe for disaster.”
. It was like that during the war too, people pretending to care left, right, and center so that they could manipulate me into doing things for them.”
But this was still his papa. It was still the same platinum blonde hair, the same silver eyes, the same pointed chin. Scorpius found a little thrill in noticing all the ways in which they looked alike. As Adella deposited Draco into the seat next to Harrison, and the court proceeded to interrogate him, Scorpius continued to watch his father. Draco didn’t seem aware that Scorpius was in the room yet. He stared up at the Wizengamot, answering their questions with a scratchy voice that clearly hadn’t been used in years. He wondered how ill his father must be for Adella to be hovering the way she was. While it was standard practice to release someone from Azkaban directly into the care of St. Mungo’s, Healers usually weren’t called in until the release was official.
“Just because I’m drawing it doesn’t mean I have to do it.” Scorpius sighed dramatically. “Papa says people need to think long and hard about it before getting married. Anyways, it’s not legal to get married before you’re seventeen, the Ministry won’t let the couple sign the marriage contract, or a prenup or anything.”
"I'm not joking. Apparently I did some kind of ritual proposal for a girl I had met in the village, and her family organised a wedding and took me to it. I didn't know what was going on until after it had all finished."
“Beats me. Maybe you should double check that you copied everything down right? For example, here where it says add salamander blood, 3 drops would optimize the potion, but 8 drops, which is what he’s written, cuts the efficiency almost in half. You might have just misread his handwriting.”
It wasn’t long before the scorching heat of the sun overhead became too much for him though. Giving up on the ritual for the time being, he wandered past a gaggle of girls who were all watching him carefully, toward where Hassan and Daneri were sitting under the shade of a large tree. He was about a foot away when he felt the effects of a strong cooling charm. Hassan had warned him that Daneri was the only wizard in the tribe, and that they had to be careful about using magic around the others. Harry wasn’t complaining though. He couldn’t help worrying that if they were going to be spending a lot more time in the heat, he might actually faint. Though considering the strength of Hassan’s cooling charms, maybe not.
His friends had been pestering him for a while now to get out in the world and start dating, but it didn’t feel like it should be a high priority at this point in his life. He didn’t feel the same urgency to get into a relationship that everyone else seemed to have. He wanted it, just not badly enough to do something about it.
Teddy nodded, glancing over his shoulder toward the kitchen before saying “How’s your big case going?”
“I’m okay, thank you.” He continued inching along the wall, pausing for a break as he leaned on the handle to the pantry. Harry caught himself staring and turned to set the table, only to realise there really wasn’t a table here. There was only the sofa, and a few bar stools at the kitchen island. Was Draco really able to climb onto the high stools when he could barely walk? Or did he usually sit on the sofa and eat?
been fantasizing about them getting married earlier, but even he knew that realistically, it was going to be awkward. Not wanting to make it worse, however, he shuffled into the room and set his bag down on an armchair by the window. It turned out Harry hadn’t changed most of the furniture in here. The linens and decor were all new, and at first glance the room looked very different, but Draco recognised the simple bed and wardrobe they’d share all those years ago.
"Oh, that's kind of you, Harry," Draco said, accepting the chocolates and smiling at Harry. "Don't tell me you booked an appointment just to bring us gifts?"
“Well then, isn’t it great that they’re joining our debriefings? You’ll get to know everything right away.”
“Who’s winning so far?” he asked, plopping down next to Teddy and stealing the bowl of popcorn he was munching on.
The cafeteria witch slid the bowl aggressively across the counter, which caused some of it to splash over the side. Draco didn’t say anything about it, instead reaching into his pocket and pulling out a couple of Galleons.
Agent Delta nodded. “It was the same magical signature. Or at least a very similar one. I didn’t have a sample from the first case to compare the second one to, but I could feel the magic.”
“Of course I do,” Harry replied easily. “I know we mostly meet because I keep needing to get divorced, but getting to know you over the past year or so has been nice. You’re very different from the bully I knew at school, and I enjoy chatting with you.”
It was a new club, right out on the strip. It seemed like they had arrived at the same time as everyone else in the city; the crowd was huge, and Harry found himself holding on to Bryan’s hand as they made their way, first to the bar, and then to the table, just so that he wouldn’t get lost. It wasn’t long before they were all a few drinks in, and suggestions of dancing started cropping up. Linda and Carol were the first ones up, followed closely by Jackie. Bit by bit the group disappeared into the throng of people, until only Joel, Bryan and Harry were left at the table.
take this one. I’ll oversee processing the signatures and everything if you want, I just don’t want to have to see him.”
With that he banged his gavel, and the court started to shuffle out of the room. Scorpius stayed where he was, still trying to process what had just been said. He was vaguely aware of Teddy sitting down next to him, and Harrison standing in front of him, but his mind could only focus on one thought: he was finally going to see his father tomorrow.
“Everyone thought that. The motive with this second attack isn’t very clear though. All I know is that the patient’s brother is an advocate for magical heritage spaces. But his organisation never made many enemies, so I—they’re not sure.”
“Wait, are you both leaving? Are you going together?” Carol asked, clearly excited at the love story she imagined must be unfolding between them.
"That's okay. My wife and I are getting divorced. That's why I've been coming to see your papa so much. We agreed that she can keep the apartment we were living in, and that I'll find a new place."
Draco sighed. “I just… they’re not labelled. That yellow soup looks like it could be butternut squash, but it also looks like it could be broccoli-cheddar. I don’t like drinking the sharp taste of cheddar, but the sweetness of squash would be very welcome right now.”
Squaring his shoulders, Harry forced himself to march over to the bedroom, where the door was once again ajar. He stepped inside, once again finding himself face to face with a terrified looking Draco. It seemed his ex was just as scared of him.
When Scorpius arrived at his desk the next morning, it was to find Teddy sitting in his chair and devouring his stash of Pepper Imps.
So it must have been morning. As his senses slowly came back to him, Harry noticed that the bed underneath him was unusually soft. This wasn't the hostel bed.
Draco hesitated. “I don’t think her parents thought what happened was the ideal option, but it happened anyway. Your friend and his contact in the tribe helped her sneak away and travel to the city, where she was taken in by a grassroots organisation that works to empower women to be independent. They’re teaching her a few skills to make her employable and setting her up with businesses around the city that might want to hire her.”
Scorpius looked defiantly at Smith as he said all this, who was now starting to cotton on to the fact that Scorpius wasn’t awed by him.
Hassan led him to a small white car, where Harry tossed his rucksack into the back seat and sat down in the front seat. He was surprised to find a steering wheel in front of him, and to hear Hassan laughing from outside the car.
“No, a friend of mine brought his son over from London, so I’m going to spend the rest of my trip with them. We’re leaving for San Francisco tomorrow.”
Scorpius nodded, knowing there was no point arguing with her. He stood up, stretching a bit, before deciding to head downstairs and see if Teddy was busy.
“Harry! Why did you stop moving the boat?” Scorpius whined. He was sitting on top of a large float which Harry had been towing around, pretending he was the captain of a ship.
how ridiculous their content can be sometimes. It's exhausting, and even worse is trying to find someone who's willing to
. He didn’t know much about what had happened to his school rival in the years since the war. Harry knew he’d become a Healer—they’d exchanged a few civil words at last year’s St Mungo’s Charity Gala—but beyond that, the details of the prat’s life were unknown to him.
Scorpius nodded. “I’ll remember to take a deep breath before I hit the water this time!” he promised. Satisfied, Harry towed him to the edge of the pool, promising to wait at the bottom of the slide again. A minute later, Scorpius came splashing back into his arms, and this time he was coughing a lot less. They repeated the process over and over, Scorpius never tiring of the slide and Harry never tiring of humouring him. He must have been on his fiftieth trip down the plastic tube when Draco walked up to the edge of the pool, right in time to get soaked by the splash of his son hitting the water.
“Thank you for being such good sports, gentlemen,” the host said quietly. “The only other volunteers were in the back, and I’d rather not leave children unattended where we can’t see them from the stage.”
“I’m not sure it is,” McGonagall offered. “Anyway, you’re not exactly doing much healing as an Unspeakable. Sounds to me like you’re doing a lot more spying and investigating.”
“Okay, here we are, rooms 1125 and 1126,” Harry announced, handing Draco his key. Draco nodded, sliding the key into the lock and opening the door to his and Scorpius’ room, while Harry did the same for his own. He waved goodbye to Scorpius and slipped into his room.
“It’s good to see you too,” he replied, giving her a hug. They sat back down on the sofa, chatting about his trip to Oslo. It wasn’t long before her mother reappeared, this time with a tray of spiced coffee and her father in tow. As they all settled down in the cozy room, Harry suddenly remembered his gift for Camilla.
“Ooh, is that your wand?” Luna asked excitedly as he sat down. He handed it over for her inspection, grinning at Pansy and Millicent, who were also giving the new tool curious looks.
“Zacharias Smith, Magical Games and Sports,” he said, offering Scorpius his hand. Scorpius’ jaw dropped as he remembered where he’d heard this man’s name before.
Agent Phi nodded. “We looked into your lead. Guy named Warren Selpie, used to be the head of CRUP, but got demoted to policy assistant for the Pest Advisory Bureau. I brought him in for questioning, and everything fits. He was hoping that placing creatures in high-profile houses would make his division relevant again, and stop the budget cut. He picked the houses he did because the people who lived there were either directly or indirectly responsible for the budget cuts, so in a way it was revenge as well.”
“So that’s why you wouldn’t take appointments,” Harry said slowly. “And why you never gave me a straight answer on what type of Healing you do!”
They both got lost in their thoughts as they continued to eat. When Harry finally got up to clear the dishes, Draco stopped him, as usual.
“You too!” Harry called, startling Draco out of his thoughts once more. He fumbled the twirl, and crashed into Harry.
“It’s pretty lame,” Harry admitted. “I hadn’t really been exposed to arithmetic growing up, but when Hermione taught it to me after the war, I really started to enjoy it, which is why I handle a lot of our office’s financial auditing.”
“Um, it was interesting,” Harry offered uncertainly. He couldn’t quite tell if Draco was mocking him.
Draco was ready to bang his head against the wall. Or hex someone. He’d prefer to hex someone, but instead he kept his composure and continued to cast Detection Spells on every single organ, muscle, bone and vessel he could think of. This poor girl had not only been Transfigured by an agressor, but had also been Transfigured back by an incompetent Healer.
Draco couldn’t say what came over him at that moment. He knew more affectionate gestures would only hurt Harry when things inevitably came to an end between them. He knew he was setting them both up for heartbreak. But he couldn’t help himself as he leaned forward, and kissed Harry as gently as he could, right on top of his lightning bolt scar.
Harry’s jaw dropped as he realised Bryan was right. Still laughing, Bryan dragged Harry to his feet and into the lounge, where they said their goodbyes to everyone, blushing and smiling mysteriously anytime someone tried to hint that they were leaving
He should have seen the question coming. But Draco was so caught off guard by the thought that he had
“Well St Mungo’s has an Owlery, doesn’t it? The problem with the Ministry is that it’s underground, so keeping owls for external mail isn’t a very feasible idea. The Ministry has a Post Department that collects the post from every department and sends it out through the local Owl Office. Unfortunately, that costs money, so the Post Department keeps track of how many letters are sent by each department, and charges them for it at the end of the month.”
“A pity, that. Though, personally, I would be loath to work in a place that has such outdated values.”
“These modifications would make the Polyjuice less potent,” Teddy explained through a mouthful of turkey and rye. “I think these times in the margins are calculations of how long a dose would last with each change. They match my calculations, anyway.”
“Stay,” Harry, begged. He hadn’t realised how much he enjoyed Draco and Scorpius’ company, but the thought of spending another week here without them wasn’t a nice one.
“No. We’re going to have to share. I refuse to remove either of the boys’ rooms. I don’t want them to feel unwelcome here.”
Harry frowned at that. It sounded unnecessarily protective of Scorpius not to trust his father’s magic.
Agent Delta had to bite back a scowl as Agent Eta gave them a pointed look from across the table. They couldn’t talk in such a noisy, crowded pub, but Agent Eta’s meaning was clear. This relationship was no longer necessary, and should be cut off immediately. It was a liability to the department, and, frankly, unfair to everyone involved. Agent Delta had always thought of themself as pragmatic, but here they were, sitting in the Leaky Cauldron trying to avoid Agent Eta’s unspoken reprimand.
“I live alone you see,” he explained, indicating that Scorpius should sit on the old fashioned sofa and summoning a tea set with a swish of his wand. “Tea, m’boy?”
“The journal also had pictures of you and me in it. Silverthorn had written threats on the back of them in old code, and given them to Papa to coerce him into brewing the polyjuice. It’s not a commonly used code anymore, so I didn’t recognise it, but Head Auror Clearwater did. Once we’d gathered the evidence, she helped me bring the case before the Wizengamot. They decided that Papa was still guilty, but only of being an accessory to murder, not of planning and attempting a terrorist attack. That brought his sentence down to fifteen years, which meant it was time to release him.”
Agent Eta shook their head. “If I’m honest, I didn’t think it would. The beauty of magic is that if you use it against someone else who can do magic, it’s probably not going to work.”
necessary for his work, however. He couldn’t have Harry snooping around the hospital and finding out that Draco wasn’t really a Healer.
With nothing else to do, and a few hours to kill, they sat down to watch the TV that Scorpius had purchased over the weekend. It seemed Scorpius had introduced Draco to his favourite crime dramas, and Harry couldn’t help imagining a future in which the three of them sat down to watch TV together. He spared a moment to feel angry that his family had been robbed of such experiences for the past 15 years, though it was immediately replaced by the guilt from the previous night, from knowing he hadn’t fought for Draco.
“I did it one day!” Harry groaned. They continued to tease each other as Harry locked his room and they made their way to the main entrance to meet everyone else.
“What?” Harry demanded, stunned that Bryan would say such a thing. “I don’t have feelings for Draco! He’s just a friend, and my—”
Teddy gasped at that. “That makes sense! I’ve been wondering why they would have wanted a less potent Polyjuice.”
Agent Eta grinned as they handed Agent Delta a pack of Muggle chewing gum. It wasn’t long before the packet had been ripped open and each agent had stuffed two pieces into their mouth. Even secret agents had their vices.
“My, my, Potter. If you were really this desperate for me to look at your arse, you could have treated me to dinner first.”
“Honestly, me either. I don’t think Smith knew about these though—they should have been catalogued as separate pieces of evidence.”
As it turned out, he hadn’t. In fact, Draco had asked him over lunch, exactly what had Scorpius so out of sorts.
Mood soured by his melancholy thoughts, Harry lifted himself off the ground, deciding that it was time for bed. It wasn't like there was anything stopping him from sleeping in, but all the same, it had been a long day. As he brushed his teeth and changed his clothes, Harry's thoughts drifted toward toy reindeers and krumkake. Cheered by how well his vacation was going, he drifted off to sleep smiling.
Draco prayed to Merlin, Morgana, Circe and Salazar that he wasn’t blushing too hard. It was fairly obvious on his pale skin. It didn’t seem to matter, though, because Potter went beet red.
“Oh.” Harry had been hoping that the blank pages meant Malfoy was available, but it seemed he was out of luck. “Could you ask him?”
Scorpius had to sit on his hands to stop them from shaking as he watched Maphiane Harrison, the defence attorney that Teddy had recommended, stand up confidently in front of the court. Something about her posture, and the measured and powerful tone of her voice, helped to calm Scorpius’ nerves a bit as she started to speak.
“Oh Godric, they are. It gets bloody annoying sometimes. Thankfully they didn’t say anything about tonight.”
“Um, he didn’t have a lot of details,” Scorpius said carefully. He didn’t want to let on how much he knew, if it meant his dad would
“Did he have to Transfigure humans into animals though?” Agent Delta groaned, annoyed that they’d expended so much effort over the past weeks for such a petty plot. “Couldn’t he have just brought in live animals?”
After the long day they’d had, all three of them piled onto Harry’s bed, switched on the TV, and ordered room service for dinner. Scorpius had barely finished eating before he passed out between Harry and Draco, still wearing the new t-shirt Harry had bought for him at the gift shop. Noticing his son was dead to the world, Draco levitated the large tray of food over to the table while Harry reached for the remote and lowered the volume on the animated movie that they had been watching.
Five minutes later, they were sitting in leather chairs in the boardroom eating a catered lunch that had been prepared for a group who was never going to show up. The hotel had given Harry a huge discount, since the room and food was already paid for by the other group, and as he had been signing the rental contract, he'd also remembered to book a room for Draco and Scorpius, and to leave a message for them to join him in the boardroom.
“We will,” Harry assured her, before gesturing toward a nearby sofa. He watched as Bryan marched over and slumped gracelessly onto the sofa.
Mr. Taber looked up at Scorpius, confused at first, but then it dawned on him. They stared at each other for a moment before they both burst out laughing.
“I’m sure he’s just stressed with work,” Harry said quickly. He suddenly felt bad about his comment on Scorpius’ cooking. The poor boy was trying so hard, working full time only to come home and care for a frail parent at the end of the day. Surely he could be forgiven for forgetting to season a casserole, right?
Draco winced at that. “I hate sun charms. I always have to place so many of them on Scorpius and I anytime there’s so much as a few rays of sun. Something about our genetics makes us burn really easily.”
“Malfoy,” she muttered, reaching for a bowl. Harry’s eyes widened as he realised that Draco had been so hesitant because he was afraid of his colleagues’ judgement. He wondered if this was isolated to the cafeteria staff, or if Draco had to deal with this kind of behaviour all the time.
“Yes, actually. Even lived with her for two years. Worst two years of my life.” He grimaced into his wine glass. “But I see your point.”
"Yeah, her family runs a toy shop. I actually bought Scorpius' reindeer from her. That's how we met."
“Agent Phi has worked with the patient before, they already knew that financial records would be relevant. I had to do the investigating to figure that out! I wouldn’t be one step behind if they’d just shared their findings with me.”
Deciding a break would be helpful, he carried the letter over to the sofa in his Healer office. It turned out to be a note from Harry asking for a second date.
I hope you had a good night at work. I’m going to get some sleep now, and I imagine you want to do the same. Will you come over this evening? Let me know.
“You probably inherited some talent as well,” Teddy added. “I’ve always noticed that kids whose parents were good Quidditch players were pretty talented themselves.”
“There’s a few drinks in the fridge if you want,” Draco said absently as he filled his own glass with water from his wand. “Scorpius seems very partial to those colourful kombucha drinks.”
He'd picked them up at the portkey station, realising that if the love spoons were for marriage proposals, he'd better not give one to Draco. He'd still given them to Hermione and Ron, which led to them having a hearty laugh at his expense about the mess he'd gone and gotten himself into, but didn't think he was close enough to Draco for that.
“For at least two years. I’m going to study business law. I’ve wanted to do it since I finished Hogwarts, but I haven’t been able to afford it.”
The Head Auror frowned at this man, who was wearing an unnecessarily formal set of robes, the effect of which was ruined entirely by the stain on his tie. He turned to Scorpius, who had to make a conscious effort not to recoil at the sleazy air this man was giving off.
“It is time for us to go, Harry,” Hassan said urgently, guiding him to where they had parked the car. They had just closed the door when the shouting seemed to get louder. Harry craned his neck to see the elder who had been arguing with Daneri storming toward the car, a young girl following behind him.
Harry bit his lip. He had definitely become fast friends with Hassan over the course of his stay here, and it was showing with the way this man cared for him. Harry thought of his own friends from back home, and how they all did similar things to help him with his self-esteem. They kept telling him that he was very harsh on himself, but Harry couldn't help thinking that something must be wrong with him, especially after the whole mess with Laura. He'd lost track of how many times he'd broken down crying in Ron and Hermione's living room, or in Draco's office because he just felt so worthless sometimes.
. How many times had he dreamed of this in Azkaban, wishing for a day he’d thought would never come? Wishing to be warm, and safe, holding the man he loved? He was itching to reach out and take Harry’s hand, or wrap an arm around his waist, but he wasn’t sure how comfortable Harry would be with a gesture like that. So he just lay there, straight as a plank, listening to Harry’s breathing. He was just starting to feel himself calming down, when Harry spoke.
A minute later, Draco found himself in the old Black house, which Harry had inherited, scolding himself for being so weak-willed. Harry had given him a doe-eyed look that he hadn’t been able to resist. It seemed Draco wasn’t the only persuasive one out of the pair of them.
"I guess I should," he shrugged. He wasn't sure how much longer he would be in the country, but he was enjoying himself so much that he figured staying a little while more wouldn't be an issue at all. Plus, if he could communicate, it might encourage him to come visit again soon.
The next few days were repeated in a similar way, though now that the Yaake was over, Harry found himself being invited to participate in various games and competitions, clearly designed to showcase the men’s intelligence and strength. Harry had been pleased to find that he could generally keep up with many of the puzzles that were offered, since he’d often wondered is everything he’d accomplished in life was the result of luck.
I don’t think you need to be nervous. You’re a talented actor and a confident man. From what I could tell, Geoffrey was already quite impressed with you, and would never consider Tom in your place (or me for that matter, though I’m tickled that you thought—even just for a moment—that I could do it). The two of you will work really well together, and the play is going to be an extraordinary hit, I’m sure of it. I speak from experience when I say that selling yourself short helps no one.
Scorpius had to grab the edge of the bench he was sitting on as Harrison resumed her seat and the Chief Warlock stood up. All the evidence and arguments they’d found had been presented. Now was the time for the court to ask any questions they had, and then Harrison would give her closing remarks and the court would make their decision. The Chief Warlock asked for questions, but when no one raised their hand, he turned back to Harrison.
“I’m glad you’re enjoying it,” he replied. “This one was one of mother’s favourites. I figured you would probably have similar tastes.”
As it turned out, Hermione was even more adamant that Harry drop the topic of the Department of Mysteries after a few drinks. Ron had, predictably, groaned at the mention of Malfoy, and laughed at how easily Hermione managed to best all of Harry’s arguments before swooping her out to the dancefloor, leaving Harry to guard their table and stew about his observations from that afternoon.
Deciding a brotherly hug would be appropriate, Harry stepped forward, but at the same time, Draco turned to leave.
"That war really got to you, eh?" Bryan asked, leaning carefully forward and touching the scar the horecrux had made on his chest all those years ago. Harry was inexplicably reminded of the scars he must have left on Draco after the incident in 6th year.
“Well look who’s finally awake,” Bryan teased. Harry spared a moment to glare at him, before reaching into his rucksack for his stash of the coveted hangover potion. He downed a portion and stood up straight, his head finally clearing as the potion coursed through his veins.
“Unfair? That’s a word they never taught us in Slytherin. Pray tell, what does it mean?” he joked. That just made the Head Auror laugh harder, before she waved him off, reminding him he only had 45 minutes before he had to be back. Still chuckling, he made his way out to the lifts. He hadn’t actually taken advantage of Madge. She’d known he wanted the emergency shift, though she assumed it was because he had a current case to review, not an old one. She had simply offered to bring him lunch anyway, and of course he would return the favour whenever he got the chance.
Eventually they pulled up to a small house. The outside walls were all painted yellow, and the door and window frames were all white. There were thick nets over all the windows, which Harry presumed were for the mosquitoes that his travel healer had warned him about. He'd brought a mosquito repelling potion, but was glad for the extra protection.
Many hours and a few hand cramps later, Scorpius made his way down to the labs. He spotted his cousin’s teal blue hair right away, and was surprised to see him playing with a paddle ball in his office.
His aunt started laughing at that. “You think two years was bad? Try growing up with her for 17. Sirius and I probably spent half our childhoods protecting your mother from her. Bella loved picking on her youngest sister, and it wasn’t the normal teasing that went on between siblings. Bella was
For the rest of the morning, Harry’s brain felt as chaotic as Scorpius’ office had sounded. His thoughts were racing with memories of Draco, interspersed with the little he knew about the man now. He’d never really thought about what Azkaban would be like before—his thoughts about Draco had always revolved around lamenting their lost marriage, and holding a grudge against his betrayal. But Scorpius’ descriptions of Draco’s health had forced Harry to realise that he’d been in prison for 15 years. He hadn’t eaten properly or felt warm in all that time, and he’d been so isolated. Had that changed Draco’s personality?
Harry’s eyes widened at this information. “Was it really? It was my review that recommended removing a couple of units from Magical Creatures. Oh Merlin, are these attacks my fault?”
Harry nodded sympathetically. “You must be exhausted. I wouldn’t have blamed you for skiving off and just going home.”
Scorpius did not expect the resigned acceptance that took over his father’s face. He remembered a papa who always used to push his dad’s buttons, who used to argue and debate everything they talked about. Simply accepting that the man he loved was angry with him did not seem like the kind of thing he would do.
Oh. Harry had been worried that his friends were making fun of Draco, but it turned out they were making fun of both of them. That felt more acceptable, and Harry allowed himself to relax.
“You used to be an Auror,” he stated, realising with a shock that this was the man who had been in charge of his father’s case. His distaste for him multiplied instantly. Unfortunately, Smith didn’t realise that Scorpius absolutely didn’t like him, and seemed to take immense pride in being recognised.
“Did you figure out why the potion was modified the way it was?” Teddy asked. Scorpius shook his head.
“It’s been great. I really wish I could spend more time at home though. It feels like work is keeping me out later and later every day. I’m thinking of taking a few days off, just so that I can actually spend time with Papa.”
“I think I’m going to stay here,” Scorpius said finally. “Teddy was right that it is an experience I need for myself. I really have been learning a lot since moving in here.”
Unfortunately he hadn’t had the time to start looking at the evidence catalogues, which were extensive. He hadn’t wanted to stay late today, knowing that his dad was probably pretty upset. He didn’t want to alienate one parent while trying to save the other.
“Very much so. See you in a bit kid,” he called to Scorpius, before turning and walking into Draco’s office. He’d been surprised when he’d come here for the first time, almost four months ago. He’d expected an opulent, Slytherin green office, possibly dark and cold like the dungeons at Hogwarts had been. Draco’s office, however, was bright and airy, tastefully decorated in very neutral tones of brown and cream.
"Thank you for taking care of him today," Draco said, smiling fondly at his son. "I know he can be a handful, and I really appreciate it."
Making a quick stop at Magorian’s Toy Emporium to buy Teddy a gift simply because he could, and a bottle of wine for his Aunt, he made his way down to the Leaky Cauldron and flooed to Andromeda’s place. He’d offered to take them to Teddy’s burger place, but she’d written back saying she didn’t want him to get into the habit of eating out so often, especially since he was going to stay with Harry next week and would probably be eating take-out every night.
He let himself into the house and was surprised to find that it was darker than usual. He made his way down the hall and noticed a soft glow from the sitting room. He walked into the normally cheery room to find it was quite dark, lit only by a roaring fire. His dad was curled up on the couch, staring quietly at the flames.
Harry grimaced. “I don’t… it wasn’t the recipe. Growing up, he missed you a lot, and I wasn’t very good about it. I let my anger get the best of me, and I didn’t support him the way I should have. He spent years scared and confused, not knowing what had happened to you.”
The finality of Agent Phi’s words hung in the air as Agents Eta and Phi stood up and left. Agent Delta was left staring out the window at the rising sun, contemplating their options. Surely there had to be another way.
“I think you could be a good Auror,” Scorpius said, confused. “You’re powerful and clever, and clearly good at defense if that war was anything to go by.”
Harry nodded, glancing around the open concept flat. His gaze landed on the sofa, and he knew what he had to say next.
"I enjoyed it too," Draco said softly. They fell into silence for a bit, and Harry was just feeling himself dozing off when Draco spoke again.
“And Warren!” Harry blustered on. “I interviewed him for my review. He loves his job—he’s the head of CRUP, Creature Response in Urban Populations. He and his team respond to wild creatures when they wander into wizarding settlements. But since urban planning in the magical community has become more sustainable recently, there are fewer creatures wandering into shops and Quidditch pitches. He’s usually the one the Aurors call when there’s a dangerous creature in Diagon Alley, or in someone’s backyard. I wanted them to reassign him to the Veterinary Care team—he has a glowing recommendation from McGonagall on his Transfiguration NEWT—but he never did well enough in Potions, so they had to demote him instead.”
Harry gave him a look of mock affront. “Can’t I just want to visit my good friend and tell him about my trip?”
"I think you are used to driving on the wrong side of the road?" he said as Harry got out of the car. "We are not driving on the same side as wizards in England."
“Well if you like the farmhouse theme, I don’t think it really matters where you have it. I eventually learned that it takes time to develop your own style. You just kinda collect pieces that you love until one day it suddenly hits you that this is home.”
That night he made his way up the path of a beautiful little brick house, dressed in a formal set of robes that he had purchased that very afternoon after realising in a panic that he had only packed jeans and jumpers for his trip. The cut and design on the robes were rather different than what he was used to wearing, but the salesman had assured Harry that this was the latest fashion. Taking a deep breath, he raised his hand and knocked.
Hassan's house was small but comfortable. The front was an open plan kitchen, dining room and living room all in one. It was tastefully decorated and neat, and thankfully nice and cold. Hassan clearly had the air conditioning running. No wonder Harry's travel agent has said this man was a highly recommended host in the area. He showed Harry to his bedroom, which was one of two in the back portion of the house. It was cheerfully decorated- the walls were painted a similar warm yellow to the outside of the house, and the bedclothes were colourfully patterned. The furniture was all made of the same solid wood, but the best part of the room was the view. There was a lovely floor to ceiling window, framed by thick lavender curtains, which looked out onto an adorable little patio and a flourishing yard. Harry counted three large trees with different types of fruits growing on them, and numerous smaller plants around the perimeter of the yard.
“I, um, don’t have a recent partner. I’ve never…” Harry trailed off, but clearly Malfoy got the gist of what he was saying.
He hadn’t had the chance to read it though, as a rather large call had come in as soon as he’d gotten back, something about a house catching fire in a mixed magical/muggle neighbourhood. The clueless wizards living there had started shooting aguamenti spells at the house, not realising that it was a grease fire, started by a muggle spilling her frying oil onto her stove. The water had only served to make the fire spread, making the job of extinguishing it even more complicated, and to cap it all off at least 20 muggles had to be obliviated after having watched their neighbours shoot water out of sticks at a burning house. All Aurors who had been even remotely available had been dispatched to contain the situation, along with a small army of Obliviators and the Head of Muggle Liaison to deal with the muggle firefighters. Scorpius had stayed behind, still minding the emergency floo but also coordinating the whole shebang. He’d been relieved when the overnight Aurors had come in at 5 to take over watching the emergency floo, and the remaining stragglers from the team who’d been sent to the fire returned to the office, allowing him to finally leave for the day. He locked the journal in his desk drawer and made his way home.
Draco nodded. “I think the Minister knows, but yes, other than the two of you, and maybe a few spouses of retired Unspeakables, it’s a secret.”
Ron shrugged. “I dunno, and honestly, I don’t care. Tomorrow I’m going to have to deal with the media storm, so tonight I just want to get sloshed. Cheers!”
“Me too,” Harry said genuinely. “And I’m glad you’ve gotten the chance to get to know him too,” he added.
He’d been finishing the paperwork to refer his second patient to a Mind Healer and mulling over the facts he had about the case. It was definitely the same culprit, but he couldn’t figure out what the connection was between the two victims. His discussion with the Unspeakable Liaison to the Aurors hadn’t provided any ideas either, but neither of them wanted to sit around waiting for a third attack.
“We were both idiots,” Harry said softly, kissing the top of his head. “What matters now is how we chose to move forward. I love you Draco, and I know I always will.”
Now, before we get started, I’d like to ask for two volunteers from the crowd to help me with the story. These volunteers will need to be adults with no legal restrictions on practicing magic. Do we have any volunteers?”
Draco was inching toward the kitchen, leaning against the wall as he walked painfully slowly. Harry wasn’t sure if he should go over and help him. It was no wonder Scorpius had wanted someone to check in during the day—Draco looked like the tiniest wind would blow him over.
“Well, I’ll leave you both to your work, it looks like you’ve got a lot to do,” Harry said, eyeing the files on Scorpius’ desk. Luckily, he didn’t ask what the case was about, and instead turned to leave. “I hope all that work won’t make you late? I was hoping to make something nice since Teddy’s having dinner with us.”
“I will,” he assured her, picking up a pinch of floo powder. He had just tossed it into the flames, and was about to step in, when she spoke up again.
“Even the most skilled arithmancers can’t count how many rules and laws he broke in his Hogwarts days, though,” Penenlope said, smirking at Harry. “There’s no way he would have deferred to authority and been able to follow instructions the way an Auror should.”
Harry couldn't help smiling at that, relieved that Bryan actually did want him. He knew they couldn't have anything very permanent, since Harry would have to go back to the UK eventually, but it would have been very awkward for their friendship to have had sex but not actually wanted it.
“We’re not dating,” he said. It would probably cause some awkward moments for Harry if he went away for two years while everyone thought they were a couple. “I was, um, working for him this past week, and he paid me this morning.”
“They’re keeping her overnight to make sure everything’s okay, but by the time I left, she looked quite human.”
“Why would he make a less potent Polyjuice potion?” Scorpius mused out loud. “This journal only focuses on the Polyjuice—there’s no other potion recorded here. Half of it is even blank.”
This work is part of "Lights, Camera, Drarry" (LCDrarry), a film-, TV- and theatre-inspired Drarry fest.
"It was supposed to be orange and pink," Scorpius said matter-of-factly. "Orange is my favourite colour, and pink is Priscillia's. But my pink crayon broke, so I picked green instead, because it's Papa's favourite colour."
Scorpius nodded, marvelling inwardly at his dad’s ability to turn the conversation around on someone. That being said, he wasn’t necessarily going to abide his dad’s request. Who knew what tensions he’d have to prod at to figure out his father’s case?
He’d barely gotten started on the transcript when his wand buzzed, reminding him that it was time to go home for dinner. With a sigh, he put the folder away, wondering absently if he’d get a chance to talk to Teddy tonight without his dad listening.
Opening his eyes again, Harry glanced around at the blurry room. With an enormous effort, he turned over to where he assumed there would be a bedside table and groped about for his glasses. When he found them a moment later and put them on, he was surprised to find that they were in a hotel room. It was very nicely decorated if a bit sparse, and that explained why the bed was so soft. Taking a deep breath, he pulled himself up and sat back against the head board, vaguely noting the telltale ache in his arse that told him he'd been thoroughly fucked the night before. All his movement must have woken Bryan, who groaned.
“Well, they’re attracted to auras of confusion and surprise. Since most people at this table are surprised that you’re the one dating Harry, there are a lot of them buzzing around.”
“I’m always here for you, though I shouldn’t have to be. If I were you, I’d report that dick. Both of you,” he added, turning to Penelope. She nodded with a grimace.
They settled down in Draco's office, Draco opening the box of chocolates and offering one to Harry before popping one in his own mouth. He moaned happily, and Harry tried very hard not to think about why that sound made him feel... something.
“I’m generally not supposed to talk about it. But I’m sure I can trust you.” Malfoy cracked the surface of the dessert, taking a small bite before continuing.
Draco was both surprised and not to step out into an entirely unfamiliar house. In the first few days after his release, Scorpius had told him that Harry had changed a lot in what had once been
“Dad.” His voice suddenly sounded stronger, and more alert. Harry’s heart clenched a little at the fact that his son was feeling defensive around him.
"She seemed more sad than anything. Though I think seeing Scorpius play with her toys cheered her up a bit."
“My apologies, Harry. I didn’t mean to confuse you. Was there a specific word that you wanted me to explain?”
“I’m overdressed,” Draco noted, taking in Harry’s tight jeans and his favourite jumper. Harry shook his head, smoothing his hand down Draco’s lapel and marvelling at the soft material.
Fuck. Hoping against hope, Harry glanced down at the names on the certificate, but he was out of luck. There, in clear printed letters, were the names Harry Potter and Bryan Anderson, and today's date. He wasn't sure if it was the excessive amounts of alcohol, or the questionable buffet from lunch the day before, or the fear that he'd never be able to travel without getting married again, but Harry suddenly leaned over the bed and threw up all over the ground. When he was finally sure his stomach was done emptying itself, he sat back up, groping around for his wand and vanishing the evidence and casting an air freshening charm.
The sound of the floo drew him out of his thoughts. Scorpius stepped out of the hearth and mumbled a distracted “hi Papa”. He walked past the couch and was halfway to the bedroom when he did a double take, finally noticing that Harry was there.
Everyone in the audience started cheering as Harry turned to Draco and pulled him into a tight hug. They grinned at Scorpius, who was standing on his chair and cheering, before turning to put their wings away and shaking hands with their host. They had just returned to their seats when he spoke again.
Just thinking about it makes me laugh. Merlin their faces, I thought their heads were going to pop off! I enjoyed myself immensely. It was nice to have someone to talk to and mock the ridiculous three-ring circus that these events inevitably become. Although, do a shot everytime someone invites you to an event was not one of our brighter ideas. What were we thinking? I blame you. You’ve always been a bad influence on me. On the plus side, once you’ve had a few, your dancing drastically improves. It seems to me that you overthink it. But my god, when you dipped me I nearly died laughing.
“We got to talk about you a bit,” Draco explained gently. “I couldn’t help telling him about a bit of your past, and it became a rather emotional experience. I’m sorry, I know it wasn’t my place, but—”
“You look like shit,” Scorpius said as a greeting. Teddy looked up at him, mouth comically full of Pepper Imps.
“Merlin, who would have guessed back then,” Neville said jovially. “That Harry’s obsession with Malfoy was actually because he fancied him?”
Draco sighed. “I agree that spells and potions don’t work. True love is a power that’s a little too difficult to be duped by simple magic. But it’s there. The dragons can feel it, and I’m sure to a certain extent, so can we.”
“Dear Mr. Malfoy,” she read out loud. “Thank you for your letter. Your admission is still current with the Lucille Vincent School of Magico-Legal arts, and we would be delighted to offer you a space in our next semester, which starts Monday.”
As they stepped through the brass doors leading into the dragon history wing, they were greeted by a huge replica of a young Norwegian Ridgeback suspended over the hallway. Harry was reminded of Norberta and couldn’t help nudging Draco as Scorpius ran off to look at a display of a fossilized egg.
“Because I…” Draco sighed, putting his book aside with shaky hands. “It’s complicated. Harry, I wanted to apologise, for—”
McGonagall frowned at him. “I’m sorry, Draco. You know I don’t trust your department. I refuse to have spies in Hogwarts.”
Harry nodded, his anger dampened by the fact that his outburst had caused such a mess. Draco clearly didn’t want to dwell on this right now, and pushing the issue wasn’t going to further Harry’s cause either.
Harry was gesturing angrily as he said all this, and slapped his hand down on the table for emphasis. Unfortunately, the puff of air from his hand coming down shifted the folder, which slipped over the edge of the table and went tumbling down to the floor. He scrambled out of his seat to help gather them all together.
“Go away!” he moaned. He had thought he’d been responsible last night and not drunk too much, but the pounding in his head said otherwise. Unfortunately, the knocking continued.
Harry nodded. “I know, and I know you don’t have time to look up and try new recipes. That’s why I wanted to help. He seemed to enjoy the soup yesterday.”
Clearly getting a straight answer out of Draco wasn’t going to be easy. He let Draco continue to ramble on about the bureaucracy and inefficiency in the hospital’s hierarchy while thinking about the fact that this was just another challenge. He and Draco had spent their lives challenging each other, whether in class, on the pitch, or during the war. After such a long rivalry, they were attuned to each other in a way that no one else was, always waiting to catch the other slip up.
“The photographs presented here are of the defendant’s husband at the time, and his son. On the reverse side of each image are pieces of code, identified in Auror records as a method of communication employed by Neo-Death Eaters. The attackers involved in the assasination of the Minister appear to have coerced the defendant by implying that they would injure or kill his son if he didn’t provide polyjuice potion mixed with his husband’s hair. Hence the code
"Harry!" came Scorpius' greeting as Harry stepped into Draco's outer office once more. "You're back! Did you bring me a present?"
The prat was back and asking about Draco again, if the Monitoring Spells going off on his wand were any indication. He crept closer, listening to Potter’s conversation with the receptionist.
“Ladies and gentlemen! This is just a reminder that story time will be starting in five minutes! For those who are interested, please make your way into the auditorium now!”
“Harry! Thanks for agreeing to come here. I know it’s not the most romantic lunch spot, but I don’t have much time today.”
“I’m going to go check on the pie,” Harry said suddenly. Scorpius didn’t think much of it until Teddy snorted.
Scorpius bit his lip as he realised how hard that must have been. He’d be devastated if he had to live knowing that one of his friends died thinking he’d betrayed them.
“It’s been a bit of a trial and error,” Scorpius continued, aware that he was babbling to fill the silence. “Teddy and I have figured out a few meals that work, like grilled fish, or broccoli casserole, and I’ve kinda fallen into the habit of just repeating those.”
“Hermione!” He said cheerfully, trying to sound innocent. Her raised eyebrow stopped him in his tracks. It was moments like these that made him grateful that Ron had become an Auror instead of joining them at MOMERO—Ron would have laughed himself silly at how much control his wife had over Harry.
“That smells good,” Draco sighed, watching as Harry stirred the chicken soup. He’d made this recipe countless times over the years, anytime Scorpius had felt under the weather. Allowing the chicken and vegetables to simmer for hours on end resulted in a tasty and nutritious broth that was still light and easy to digest. He was hoping it would make Draco’s lunch a little more exciting, at least for today.
Harry was touched that his friends cared enough about his boyfriend to get him a gift. It struck Harry that he should probably get Draco a congratulations gift as well. Curious as to what that could look like, he leaned over as Draco opened the box.
Draco shook his head. “I usually just spend the afternoon reading until Scorpius is done with work.”
“Oh, he does it on purpose,” Draco explained, his smile fading a little. “I’m afraid there’s a rather exhaustive list of the things I can’t eat much of, and many spices fall onto that list.”
"Like what you see?" he smirked, clearly eyeing Harry up as well. Harry blushed, looking up to meet Bryan's eyes.
“Nope,” Agent Delta said smugly. Agent Eta looked like they were about to argue, but Agent Delta beat them to it.
“Well, I should—oh, sorry was there something else?” He turned back to face Harry, who was now mortified to be frozen with his arms halfway up in what was clearly an aborted hug.
With a curt nod, Draco took Scorpius' hand and disappeared back into his office. Smiling, and excited for his upcoming trip, Harry waved to Priscillia and disapparated on the spot.
Draco stepped out into the hall, wondering what in the name of Merlin was going on. Why was Potter suddenly so insistent on having Draco treat his mysterious itch? If it wasn’t an STI, clearly one of his Weasleys had played a prank on him and put Bulbadox powder in his pants. Thankfully that was an easy issue to identify, and even easier to fix. He’d have Potter on his way in no time and get back to his work.
"It actually makes a fair amount of sense. She wants you to pay for her to go to University for two years. She said that once news gets out that you two aren't married anymore, her community will gossip a lot about it, and she said she wouldn't be able to handle it. She wants to go away until it dies down, and for her, that means going to university."
Draco snorted before telling Scorpius that yes, he’d go buy a pair of trunks and join them in the pool. Predictably enough, he returned five minutes later in a pair of forest green swim trunks that left very little to the imagination. Harry didn’t even realise he was staring, until Scorpius splashed him.
He hesitated outside the door as he realised what he was about to do, however. He’d been shocked to come home to his papa sitting on the couch, frantically wringing his hands as tears streamed down his face. He’d explained shakily that his dad had walked in looking for Scorpius, and gotten angry at the sight of his papa. After his dad had left, his papa had called Teddy, unsure of how to reach Scorpius at the shop, and Teddy had gone to talk to his dad.
Scorpius’ visit to the archives had been uneventful that first day, aside from bringing back a lot of memories as he sifted through the personal possessions his papa had had on him when he was arrested. Scorpius had been especially surprised to find that his wand felt very comfortable, almost as if it were his own. He’d heard of children who were incredibly compatible with their parents’ magic and therefore able to use hand-me down wands, but he’d never quite believed it was possible until now. His maternal grandparents had mailed over his mother’s wand when he’d turned eleven, but it hadn’t felt quite right, and his dad had simply taken him to get a new one.
Their server popped up almost immediately, asking for their drink orders. Harry turned to Camilla and asked if she or her parents liked anything specific. After a bit of discussion with the waiter, she suggested a certain wine, of which Harry ordered two bottles.
Scorpius nodded, staring down at his hands before he started talking. Despite his dad’s previous conviction that he never wanted to talk about his ex-husband, he somehow knew that his dad wouldn’t get upset at him for talking about papa today.
“Please, have a seat. I’m just going to the loo, I won’t be long. Make yourself at home in the meantime.”
"Camilla, you won't be happy with me." He could tell he sounded rather cliche, but it was true. He could tell he wasn't going to love her, not the way he should love his wife. If she came with him to London, she would have no one else. But he knew he wouldn't be able to trust her, not completely. Not after what Laura had done to his heart. It wasn't fair, for either of them.
He looked up to find Hermione standing next to his desk, staring worriedly at him. He considered telling her—she always gave him solid advice when he needed it—but then thought better of it. She wouldn’t approve of his plan to spy on Malfoy by dating him. She’d say it was unethical, and that Harry was obsessed for no reason. Even worse, she’d tell Ron, who would start insisting that they set Harry up with someone.
Scorpius frowned, reaching into his bag and pulling out the sandwich his dad had packed for him, handing it to Teddy who ripped into it before continuing.
“Sorry to bother you, Healer Malfoy. Mr Potter here was requesting an appointment with you, but it seems I don’t have access to your appointment logs.”
that I’ve seen in you recently is your habit of looking for trouble by once again skulking about on the ninth floor.”
At that moment a loud crash sounded from behind Scorpius, who trailed off, looking exhausted. Clearly whatever was going on with the Aurors today was a serious issue.
Harry was sure he’d be successful this time. They would be sitting among his colleagues, so Harry was bound to overhear something important, and he was sure he’d be able to convince Draco to let Harry walk him back to his office after lunch. It was foolproof.
"Honestly, I don't even think it's the fact of being married that appeals to me so much as the idea of having a family. I guess I just always thought marriage would be the first step towards that."
Harry knew she had a point. He knew he shouldn’t argue. But today, his efforts had finally paid off—they finally had a reason to push for a review of all activities in the Department of Mysteries.
"What's commated, Papa?" Scorpius asked curiously. Bryan made a strangled noise at that and turned even more red.
Harry continued to listen as Malfoy talked about people not brewing their own potions anymore. It was interesting to think about—Harry himself relied heavily on apothecaries for his potions since he’d never learned anything about them. He’d never considered that if he’d had a better education on the subject, he might have been able to brew his own cure for boils or Pepper-Up.
And so he spent the morning inspecting furniture, art, kitchenware, plants, and a whole variety of other gifts that a young adult might appreciate. As he browsed, Harry became more and more aware that he didn’t know what Scorpius’ flat looked like. He’d thought Scorpius might need a couple of days to settle in, and that was why Harry hadn’t been invited over to look around. But surely a week was enough time, right? As Harry continued to mull over whether it would be appropriate to pop in and surprise his son, he suddenly realised that he didn’t have the address.
“I know,” Harry said quickly. “He hates sand, and he refuses to eat if different foods on his plate are touching each other. But those are part of what makes him unique, and I honestly love him for that.”
While the whole country was beautiful, Harry had really enjoyed the connection with nature up in the small village much more than the typical tourist attractions in the city. Though he had to admit, being in the city had its perks. He had found a beautiful shop full of intricate wooden pieces the other day, just down the street from one of the many museums had seen. Deciding to take a look, he’d been thrilled to find a display of wooden spoons called love spoons. The small card that came with each spoon explained that these were traditional spoons for showing affection. It seemed like a lovely gift to give, and they weren’t too expensive. He picked up three—one for Ron, one for Hermione, and one for Draco. He was making his way over to the counter to pay when it suddenly struck him that this would be a nice gift to give Camilla too. After all, he was buying one for each of his other friends—why should she be left out?
