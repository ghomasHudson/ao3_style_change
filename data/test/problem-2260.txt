The dull thud which Potter’s head caused when it connected with the nightstand on the way down was sickening, but Draco could do nothing but brace himself for the fall, coming to rest with a thump on top of Potter’s sprawled, face-down form, tangled in the blanket that’d been dragged down with them. As Draco gathered his bearings, and mentally accounted for the continuing health of all his limbs, he became aware that Potter wasn’t moving. Breaking Harry Potter during sex would most
The physical contact from Draco helped. Although it was against Harry’s better judgment to follow advice delivered by Lucius Malfoy, Harry was aware that his judgment was often skewed. And this could be another opportunity to reclaim the life he used to have.
Well, Draco could attest to that this year. He tried to hold onto his anger, attempted to feel insulted. Affronted. Betrayed. Belittled. Anything other than the sense of gratitude which was growing in his chest.
confused, he had no idea. Maybe it’d been the crawling. Or the uncharacteristic praising of good behaviour. Or the mention of playing with something. Or Harry was just losing his mind. Whatever had caused the anomaly, Harry hoped he’d be lucky and Malfoy wouldn’t have heard.
Staring into the light, the memory assaulted him again and the tugging increased. Harry was struck by a knowledge which he had no logical basis for: things would be

Draco’s bout of uncharacteristic, spontaneous heroism changed things in both disturbing and surprising ways during the following week, word of his actions spreading like wildfire throughout the school.

Luna had stared at Harry like he was insane when he’d said that.
Draco turned his back to Potter, retrieved the blanket and wrenched it over his body to prepare for a night of petulant brooding, but after a long moment of silence, Potter spoke, hesitant and quiet.
Blinking in confusion, Draco asked, “A what?”

all that crap and get the work done.”
Tension abruptly returning in force, all three of them sat in silence. Ron stared down at his boots, Draco glared at Ron’s face, and Harry flicked his gaze between the two, feeling a tinge of helplessness.

The ‘betrayal’ part remained to be determined. The bathroom thing was… valid. They’d left Luna sitting by herself for slightly too long, not that she’d appeared to mind. Or be surprised. It was now several days after her suggestion that Harry work in Ollivanders and he was seriously considering the prospect, although Harry still didn’t know how useful he’d be. But that was something to think about after he’d managed to get some proper rest. If he managed to do that.
The fingers inside Harry didn’t thrust, but the digits separated and contracted, separated, and contracted… stretching and relaxing the rim of Harry’s anus in precisely the way that Malfoy knew Harry adored.

“Conditions might’ve been the wrong word,” Potter hurriedly added, possibly viewing the crumbling of Draco’s last vestiges of resolve.
Draco swallowed, tried to determine Potter’s expression, and failed. Feeling too exposed, he closed his eyes and searched for the strength to keep talking.
“Back to the common room,” Draco managed to murmur as he increased the gap between them.

a roaring animal of any description. And the last person Harry wanted to speak to.
Harry’s face burned with embarrassment. He might never be able to look Ron in the eye again.
Draco sneaked a hand around Potter’s torso, slowly progressing towards his target. When his fingers curled into a gentle fist around thick, firm heat, he heard Potter’s breath cut off mid inhale. There was no time to lose before either one of them ruined this, so Draco rocked his hips forwards again, stroking up the length of Potter’s cock at a speed to match. Pulling back, he also pulled his fist towards Potter’s stomach, received a moan of approval, repeated the dual movement and began an uncertain rhythm.
Harry was immediately released back into the cool air.
A blink, just one. That’s all that Draco’s righteous anger warranted from Potter. Draco waited, clinging to the last remnants of his patience, while privately resolving that if Potter didn’t offer him a more worthy sign of acknowledgement very shortly, then Draco was going to toss him out of the nearest window and do his best to ignore the urge to save him.
Great praise indeed within this context.
Harry didn’t know why Luna would be asking for his opinion on this. Or why Luna would suspect that Michael’s lack of wand would have anything to do with him. Even though Harry had been about to ask

Why were there so many unfinished sentences around Potter? “Just what?” Draco prompted. “Stealing my mail? Using my wand when you had a perfectly good wand of your own available?”
“It’s nice to see you, Harry.”
“All that Malfoy heritage?”
“Perhaps my rates have gone… up,” Harry replied, enjoying his own pun as his hand rose with his last word. “If it’s
That was the strangest abrupt change in conversational topic which Draco had heard in a while.
“Shit,” was Harry’s final assessment.
“He wanted me on top, kept asking, and I kept declining, encouraging us to do other things. I’d topped plenty of times before when men had been insistent about it, even though I don’t… like it. And I’ve done it since then because that’s… the only way anyone wanted me. But I didn’t want my relationship with him to be built on the same type of pressure I’d experienced from other men. It felt like that would’ve been too big a lie. But I also didn’t want to disappoint him any

of bad memories that you do, Harry.”
“No.”
“Uh… huh.”
Harry still felt guilty about that. Although Harry had insisted that he needed to abide by the promise he’d made to assist Draco with selling his family estate, Draco had encouraged him to accept Luna’s offer of employment if he wanted it.
“Just being nosy. I wondered what Weasleys do with their time.”
Harry gaped as realisation hit him.
good, then Malfoy might let him.
Wide-eyed, Lucius immediately fell mute. Harry didn’t think that was because of any broken portrait magic. Anxious not to hear anything further from that poisonous mouth while the frame was still mostly holding together and before Harry could do anything worse, Harry recast the silencing charm. He also conjured and wandlessly draped a black cloth delicately over the frame as he had done once before. Best not to view Lucius until Harry had calmed down.
Breathing shakily, unable to fully shake off the shock of what he’d read and the resulting, irrational guilt which wanted to consume him, Harry fought to focus on a couple of very important things.
“We do have many to choose from.” Draco smiled, rested his hands on Harry’s knees, and whispered, “I’m absurdly in love with you, Potter.”
“Don’t you need to know why?”
Draco tutted at him. “Told you,” he commented.
That would’ve been easier to believe if Draco didn’t look so stressed.

well-compensated for my selfless generosity.”
There was a great deal of contemplation evident on Potter’s face, but he still wasn’t looking at Draco anymore. “How?”
Draco sighed. “I’m not going to push you into anything you’re not ready for. But I do think it’d good for you. Just think about it.”
“That’s not true,” said Draco. “You speak to
Harry was comprehending many things about himself. “I understand that it’s not my decision whether or not you fuck me. Or… use me in any way.”
As if anything would be considered beyond the Saviour of the World. Potter could probably achieve the lowest NEWT results in the history of the school and still emerge vaunted by the masses for his genius.
“Yes, I love being on my knees,” admitted Harry.
“But you’ll let me?”
“But first,” Harry asked, “do you want to see -”

But the quiet stalking was much preferable to the times when Potter decided to talk to him. Ignoring Potter outwith the strict requirements of the sponsorship continued to be ineffective as a deterrent. Insults, as much as Draco dared, didn’t work either. In fact, Draco’s well-crafted invectives only spurred Potter on. Despite Draco’s refusals, Potter continued to invite him for meals, requested study time together, offered Draco sweets and chocolates, and strolled alongside him in the corridors, conducting spontaneous bouts of chattering along the way.
“I’ll head off then,” Ron announced. “Hope we’ll see you next week.”
Pausing his thrusts, Harry chuckled quietly at Draco’s whine, gratified when it turned into a delighted squeal as Harry hooked his hands under Draco’s arse to securely claim a buttock in each palm. A shuffle gained Harry enough leverage to get his thighs under Draco and rise higher on his knees, taking Draco’s still impaled lower body up and completely off the mattress.
So much for trust. “You asked him?” Harry had recently harmed the portrait of Draco’s father, so he

Maybe Harry was looking for a distraction, or a fight. He didn’t know, but he poked at it again.
And his desperate condition ramped up another impossible notch when Malfoy’s other hand encased Harry’s balls. Rolling, teasing squeezing, lightly tugging on the hairs covering his sac.
“Potter. I can hear you fretting,” Draco said. “Come back to bed. You’ve left a cold spot.” Draco patted the pillow to his left.
“Oh. In that case… piss off,” Potter instructed the bird, flicking his wrist in a haphazard shooing motion. Taking the hint, the owl rose and flew through the gap in the drapes. The gap swished closed under Potter’s wanded direction.
The tone brooked no argument. Draco knew Harry well enough to be aware of his limits, but Harry suspected that he was often concerned that Harry wouldn’t speak up when he needed to.
of ideas in those.” Harry was processing the vision of Malfoy reading erotica when Draco said, “How about just ‘stuff that we like’?”
“Do you regret it? Your father’s portrait? The estate? That they’re gone, I mean?” Harry asked, certain that he knew the answer, but afraid that he might be wrong.
As continuity went, it was spot on.
Draco didn’t answer; he was staring past both Harry and Ron with a strange expression on his face.

Harry was awake when he should be sleeping. Again.

Oh, and clearly Harry had no comprehension about the concept of self-control. Harry narrowed his eyes as he replied, “I could tell you something about fucking
“Okay. Let’s go home,” Harry announced as he pushed himself to his feet. He’d offered a hand to Draco and assisted him up before something occurred to him. “Unless you’d like to stay for a while longer.”
Harry sank to his knees in front of Draco, rested his palms on his thighs, and bowed his head submissively.
Harry sighed. “It’s gonna be a disaster, I can feel it.”
The last fortnight had passed relatively quietly, if one didn’t count their roaring orgasms. Well, Malfoy roared. Harry was more of a screamer, when Malfoy allowed it.
Draco panted, wanting Potter back, but he clenched his wayward hands by his sides and stood firm. “Do you really think everything’s that simple?” Draco said. “Like and dislike? Nothing’s that straightforward.”
“Can you what?”
It was going to be fine. Harry had the support of his friends, his

“Hmm,” Draco hummed. “Too many clothes, I think. I want you to be comfortable.” Harry’s comfort was not normally a high priority. “Let’s take these off.” Nimble fingers were shortly unfastening Harry’s jeans.
Although Harry knew Draco hadn’t retained much attachment to his family’s values, he hadn’t thought Malfoy would completely discard his heritage. “You’re going to sell the Manor?”
It was clear enough. “Yes, I understand. Eight strikes. Count each one and show my gratitude.”
Hissing at the welcomed addition of another level of pain, Harry was. “
I ask for. I’m not… very used to asking for stuff at all,” muttered Potter.
“I know.” Malfoy smirked and shrugged. “But it’s a workable plan. Think about it.

Embarrassed in the aftermath, Harry felt heat spreading on his cheeks, followed quickly by a kiss above his nipple.

loud.”
Harry was grateful that Malfoy was one of the few people who understood when ‘then’ was, without any explanation. The instant of Voldemort’s demise had been as notable an event for Malfoy as it was for Harry.
Although Draco’s grin was still in place, it was wavering. Draco knew why Harry didn’t usually ask for that. Wanting Draco’s confidence back, Harry nodded fervently and the grin returned in full force. When Draco’s eyes twinkled with mischievous calculation, Harry even had the sense that he was about to be outmanoeuvred. But he would expect nothing less.
After what felt like a long time, Potter whispered, “Sort of.”
“There you are. I got preoccupied with…” Draco stopped short a couple of steps into the study. “Oh. Hello, Father. Umm… you remember Harry Potter, I'm sure.”
Attentiveness, that’s what it took. Look, listen, and

, that was definitely four. Harry also began to feel what he was sure was Malfoy’s fist moving up and down against his side as Malfoy gripped his renewed erection with his other hand. Malfoy seemed to halt his inward progress at a shallow penetration, but Harry understood that; Malfoy was probably hesitant to force his hand in up to the knuckle with four since they hadn’t done this before. Not that Harry would’ve stopped him. But the lack of depth didn’t make it any less fantastic. Harry’s breaths sped up with excitement.

Harry took time to process the words. He could think much better now. His thoughts flowed peacefully as he knelt and considered the issue, feeling protected within the space that Draco was maintaining for him.

“I wanted it to last more than three minutes.”
Unfortunately, Harry’s cock was starting to show keen interest in Malfoy’s plan; it did have a certain level of preposterous appeal.
Unable to stay completely still, Harry raised his head enough to plant his forehead with unforgiving pressure down onto the edge of the cuff around his right wrist, hoping that cold, hard metal digging into his skin could provide alternative focus without him straining against the handcuffs.

Thrilled, Harry grinned. This surely was his time to shine.
It wasn’t until Potter had settled behind him that Draco realised Potter shouldn’t have recognised the obscure spell from Draco’s tiny hand movement. Through necessity, Draco had spent months covertly teaching himself a few useful wandless medical charms in the Manor, and he
“He hasn’t ranted about that since school, Hermione.” She nodded in acknowledgement of that. “So, now we have more than five minutes to talk to each other… what’re you up to nowadays?” asked Harry.
The result of Harry’s wave was the removal of the silencing charm. The room was immediately filled with an imaginative combination of pure-blood ranting and explicit homophobia. Harry hadn’t heard a few of those insults before. He didn’t think some of them were physically possible.

Harry waited for Luna to say more but she didn’t expand further. He’d been expecting follow-up questions and had been trying to determine how best to answer them.
“Going somewhere?” asked Draco.
“Bad,” Harry supplied.
Potter tentatively reached out towards Draco’s arm. It wasn’t a quick movement, Draco had plenty of time to retreat, but instead he stood motionless and allowed Potter to grasp his wrist, peeling it away from Draco’s chest.
Potter tilted his chin up in unmistakable challenge. “Then, ask.”
“Leave it. Please.” At Draco’s deepening frown, Harry added, “It

Harry winced as he moved his arms from the position he’d been holding them in for so long, but he forced himself to drop to all fours, turned upon the carpet and approached as directed. Crawling was another new experience for Harry. It was definitely humiliating; he felt his cheeks flush as he crawled with his erection swinging beneath him like an eager pendulum. When he reached Malfoy, Harry resumed a kneeling position and rested his hands on his thighs.

“Hey, Draco,” called Potter from beside the fireplace. For the umpteenth time that evening.
Without raising his own arms or reaching for the wand he carried out of habit but had no real use for anymore, Harry turned slowly on the spot, visualising how his conservatory had previously been. Obligingly, glass chips and shards gently lifted from the ground and reset themselves seamlessly within the frames. Once the room had morphed from destruction to immaculate glazing and restored furniture, Harry turned back to Malfoy, worried when he registered the faint flush on Draco's cheeks and the glazed look in his eyes. But it didn’t seem to indicate that Malfoy was in any way harmed.
With the absence of further distractions, Harry quickly conducted his requirements in the bathroom. When he wandered back into the bedroom with a towel slung low over his hips, it was obvious that Draco hadn’t heeded his own advice about sleeping.

, Harry found himself shifting onto all fours to comply. A glance up confirmed that Draco had indeed sat on a chair which was now turned away from the kitchen table. Harry noted that Malfoy hadn’t refastened his trousers. And Harry’s prize had not dwindled in stature; that might be a good sign of sorts. Maybe. He didn’t know.
“Right. Okay,” agreed Draco, thinking that it might prove safer not to call him anything at all. As Potter turned over, Draco was mortified to be shaking at the prospect of what might be about to occur.
“Was it too much?” Draco asked. “I’m
“Both, really. I

A few seconds later, they both popped back into existence in a familiar entrance hall. But not familiar due to any cheery connotations for Harry.
His mind suddenly clear, Harry stared at Michael’s reflection in horror.
But Harry wasn’t going to let it go further than that, not at the moment. He drew the kiss to a gradual conclusion before it could escalate, waiting until their mouths had parted before he pushed at Draco’s right shoulder and rolled them both, reversing their positions until he was straddling Draco’s groin.
Draco didn’t go far though. He knelt above Harry, clearly considering his next move.
“Okay,” said Ron. “I’ll be back soon.”
“I will,” agreed Harry.
Harry had important things to think about. But that would do for now.

He thought. Probably. That’s what he’d decided, anyway. The maple wood seemed to suit Madame Deetry more than the others she’d held. To Harry, it smelt sweet like baking, and he’d wondered if that perception had been sparked by her offer or if he’d have come to that conclusion without it. The Devil’s Snare had produced vivid sparks when it touched Madame Deetry’s palm, and Harry had been worried that he’d hurt her until he quickly realised that she wasn’t aware of what’d happened. Nothing else which Harry had tried provoked a reaction as strong, so he’d gone with it. He wished he could be

“Clearly, I
“Potter, sit down.”
Harry had definitely missed something.
But all of Harry’s insecurities weren’t going to vanish. “It’s… not right. Oliver said… others haven’t liked -”
The expression on Potter’s face was that of disappointment. And misinterpretation.
“Hmm. We’ll see. I’ve heard enough from you. I think I’d like you to shut up again now.”
His urgent instinct was to back away, retreat to safety. He didn’t

excited you might look at the prospect.”
Harry was face down with his right cheek on the mattress near his bound wrists, stark naked, bent legs tucked tight under him, and his arse in the air while Draco lounged in a chair near the bed, equally nude with one leg draped over the other. Draco was paying close attention to the transparent length in his hand, applying what was surely enough lubricant to fuck an elephant and criticising Harry’s lack of respect for fine fabrics. It felt like Harry had been listening to detailed instructions on correct garment folding techniques for quite a while. The jeans and other clothing which Harry had
His doubt or confusion must have shown on his face, or perhaps in Harry’s wilting erection.
But that resolute brand of dominance never failed to please Harry. Contemplating his plight, Harry knew that he could easily liberate himself from this predicament, but he was enjoying it too much.
After a tense pause, Lucius folded his arms across his chest and nodded.
trouble. But as he threw his arms out to the sides and gulped in panting breaths, Harry didn’t give a shit.
“Then why didn’t you use…” Draco gave up. It was too early in the morning for trying to interpret Potter’s actions. “Never mind. Give me that,” Draco huffed, snatching the scroll from Potter.
Luna tutted, but the sound was tolerant, rather than annoyed.
Harry’s magic silently crackled at the back of his teeth and on his skin, ready to lash out.
“And you couldn’t possibly touch someone so tainted, right? So evil?”
Thinking of the arrangements that Potter had made, Draco tried to have faith. He wanted to believe, but it still seemed so extremely
“Maybe I’m
He opted for loudly slamming a drawer shut instead. Draco jolted awake.

Smiling, remembering where he was, Harry reached for the glass and gratefully sipped. The moisture soothed his anxious throat and the coolness dropping down through the core of his body helped to focus and ground him. As did the arm which Draco draped around his shoulders, pulling him close. He shoved the last of the recollection aside, concentrated on the present, and carried on as if nothing had occurred to interrupt them, grateful that Draco let him maintain the illusion of normalcy.
Draco predicted that Potter was probably to be found in his usual location. Moping on the common room couch had been Potter’s main activity for most of the past week, not to mention much time before that. Since their last tryst a few days ago, Potter had been taking great steps again to avoid anything but essential contact with Draco, and Draco’s patience was rapidly reaching its limits. If Potter was currently considering the benefits of clinging to one of the Tower windows in a fit of suicidal depression, Draco was becoming quite prepared to give him a helpful nudge.
“Yes.”
“Your funniness never ends,” laughed Harry, snuggling in with not the most productive move to achieve getting up off the floor.
“Umm, yes. Today, when you were in the shop.” Draco looked extremely alarmed, so Harry quickly expanded, “It didn’t work for very long. He didn’t manage to get me to do anything. And I think… I think it helped me. I was really angry after he did that. It showed me who he actually is.”
“Close your eyes.”

Draco appeared to ponder that for an oddly long time. “No,” he seemed to decide. Not yet.”
. The recklessness and purity of Gryffindors was clearly catching. “Except for the brooding, that is.”
“That won’t help you,” Draco said. “It’s all going to be sold, anyway.”
But he couldn’t tell Malfoy that. Malfoy had a low enough opinion of him.
“Bloody hell, Potter. You scared the shi -” was all that Draco managed to speak before Harry walked forward and wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders.

Harry was imagining a set of heavy steel handcuffs and how they might feel as Draco clicked them cruelly into place around his wrists when a sudden jangly metallic soft whump behind him made them both jump slightly.
“Because it’s your magic,” Luna said, as if that explained everything.
“You’ve done well. You may come if you want to,” Draco consented with a casual wave.
Ron appeared hesitant but began to speak, fingers clenching on the padded armrests of the chair. “It’s been… weird, since you broke up with Michael. Not all the time, but… sometimes. Mostly the times when I tried to talk to you.”
And all the while, Malfoy swallowed repeatedly around Harry’s cock, still embedded his throat. If Harry hadn’t done this to Malfoy on countless occasions, he would’ve marvelled at why Malfoy wasn’t suffocating. But Harry had never experienced this for

to be that. But there was something about Malfoy that had always been able to break Harry’s shields. But Harry wasn’t what he was meant to be, wasn’t the steadfast hero, wasn’t the unshakable leader, wasn’t the reliable strength that the world had required, wasn’t the assertive lover, wasn’t
“Oh.” Potter looked dumbstruck. “I… the sponsorship thing. But I didn’t…
“I think you’ve missed the point of the sponsorship,” Potter said. “It’s about achieving education and security.
“That was… enjoyable,” Draco admitted, offering an incentive for Potter to stay.
“You can look at me whenever you want to,” Draco confirmed.
Draco curled up on his chest. The position was the reverse of their familiar dynamic and it had previously caused Harry to feel uncomfortable whenever they’d tried it. Confused, but not feeling an urge to correct the anomaly, Harry decided there’d be time to analyse it later.

Draco blinked at him innocently. “What?”
“Shag rug?”
“Not usually, no. But something slightly different is required today, I think.”
“Hermione told me to.”
“Yes,” Harry decided. “
That assertion didn’t quite latch on through his rising despair, so he tried again.
“It’s… time,” Draco whispered. “Please burn it.”
“But I
Harry did remember that. He’d noticed Ron regarding him with interest and had panicked for a second when Ron appeared to be about to speak to him. But Ron hadn’t uttered a word. Harry felt the need to try to explain why
“I just… like to have my wand somewhere near and… safe, when I’m sleeping,” Potter sighed. “And it’s not like I snatched your mail and ran.”
Harry could use some himself. He scanned the menu, made a selection and soon both Hermione and he were sipping frothy and creamy coffee concoctions which Draco would’ve declared to be sacrilegious.
The slam of the dormitory door cut off the rest of Potter’s sentence.
So much significant letter-writing lately. But it probably was more Draco’s delicate style.
He was extremely glad when Potter obliged without further comment, plucking up the blanket and sliding into the warmth. Potter’s fingers curled hesitantly against Draco’s hip, nudging him over onto his side, before Potter efficiently installed himself back into the position from which he’d fled. Cautious, Draco silently complied, very aware that due to their mutual nudity, this was not at

It seemed to be. “Well done. How deep can you take a cock in your mouth?”
“Because you seem so miserable when you look at that scroll,” Potter said, and Draco wondered how transparent he was becoming. “I wanted you to know that whatever he’s written doesn’t need to matter. But it’s up to you whether you read the letter. It’s all up to you. You needed to
“Was that a demand?” asked Malfoy, beginning a steady but shallow pumping in and out of Harry’s hole.
“Drink, Potter.”
“Do you want me to heal your arse?” asked Malfoy.
Grinning, Ron leaned against the doorframe. “That thing doesn’t look all that sturdy with those spindly legs. So be careful. Safety first.”
“Yes, it is.”
“No,” Potter mumbled. “I’m busy. And you didn’t seem to care much for my help before.”

urge which had shocked him on Saturday. Since then, he’d almost managed to dismiss it as an oddity of no importance, but now it returned full force and with enough intensity to stun the movement of Harry’s body to a complete stop. He waited for it to quickly fade, as it had done before. Instead, the desire only grew.

“Okay,” said Harry. “Then, you start.” Harry wanted to hear what Ron would say first.
It wasn’t long before Harry found a rhythm, similar to one he’d done many times before, but at the same time a completely different experience. There were no directions to let Harry know if his performance was acceptable, no restrictions, no demands at all. Just Harry, happily fucking himself on Draco’s erection and Draco watching him with rapt attention, like it was the best show he’d ever seen.
To keep Draco within his sphere of power, Lucius had refused to pay for another year at Hogwarts. However, the scholarship provided for a full educational experience, including class fees, boarding, meals, books, supplies and clothing. Even when the recipient was Draco. The unexpected generosity had shocked Draco to the core, but he wasn’t stupid enough to refuse it.

that Harry couldn’t begin to properly describe it.
He considered what he was currently witnessing and attempted to view it through Draco’s eyes. Harry had blamed himself for the loss of Ron’s friendship and had left him in peace. But Ron… Ron hadn’t wanted to help Harry. Hadn’t cared to listen. And now, here was Ron after all these years… trying to persuade Harry to do something which Ron

“Yes, I would’ve. I still might. People can receive the most unfortunate and untraceable things through the postal service. Happens all the time.”
As always after he was denied for so long, releasing the built-up pleasure seemed to go on for a while.
“No, Harry. I don’t
Draco sighed. “Apparently being your…

Harry chuckled, that might brighten his day. Before Harry could answer, Malfoy stepped behind him and uttered a low but commanding instruction in the tone which Harry
Draco wasn’t allowed to play Quidditch anymore, so that was hardly an appealing topic. “Boring. What I meant,” Draco spoke with an inflection which he hoped wouldn’t be misinterpreted, “is what do you have to

. But, knowing Luna as he did, it wasn’t that odd at all. Harry didn’t know if this secret global wand blacklisting operation was real, but also didn’t see any reason not to go with it.

Four fingers still up his leaking arse, Harry shrugged.
Potter’s shift into false sexual confidence had been so subtle that Draco couldn’t quite pinpoint when it’d begun. He worried that he wouldn’t spot it again.

Malfoy watched as Harry put on his trousers, then waved him down beside him on the couch. Harry liked the weight of Malfoy’s arm around his shoulders as he was tugged close. He felt calm and protected, so he nuzzled into Malfoy’s chest again, slowly relaxing against the warmth and imagining that he could still smell his come on the cleaned shirt.
But he should’ve known that Malfoy wouldn’t leave him with nothing.
“Worthier than you,” Draco chuckled.
“Uhuh,” Harry nodded. “Just wanted to make sure.”
Anxious to cease this irritating incoherence before Potter worked up momentum, Draco interrupted with a wave of his hand.
Harry nodded. “I’ll write one tomorrow.”
“Open your mouth and take me in,” Malfoy instructed. “Just let my cock lie on your tongue.” Harry parted his lips to encase Malfoy’s spent cock in the wetness of his mouth, not sucking, aware that he had strangely not been instructed to do that. Careful not to let his teeth graze the flesh, he relaxed into this different sense of reassuring fullness. Harry breathed through his nose, inhaling Malfoy’s musky scent and resting calmly with the soft mouthful, the slight pressure of balls against his chin and wiry hair tickling his skin.
Before Draco could roll onto his back again, Harry shifted himself forward onto his right side to bring his chest flush with Draco’s back, raising his left arm to wrap around Draco’s torso, suddenly wishing that they were wearing briefs. He tried not to let that deter him. It was often convenient that neither of them bothered with clothes in bed but in this instance, Harry felt safer keeping a narrow and deliberate distance between their lower bodies.
As Draco pondered that, a thought occurred to him. And the foolish honesty which he appeared to be embracing lately urged him to ask, “But isn’t that what I did today? Interfering?”

“Yes… but the oral thing…” Draco lifted his head to regard Harry with concerned eyes. “…you know.”

“But we could talk about it more. Work something out.”
Ron had requested to visit the Manor under the guise of the Ministry ensuring that all dark magic items had been removed. Harry hadn’t bought that for a second and neither, he thought, had Draco. As previous Minister for Magic, Harry was well-versed in standard legal Auror practices, and an assessment for the possible existence of dark magic required an attendance of at least two Aurors. The complete lack of official Ministry paperwork in Ron’s possession during this ‘inspection’ also reinforced the true point: Ron was simply being nosy. And Draco was
Flinching, Harry began to turn to face his desk, but was clearly not fast enough. Malfoy closed the sparse distance between them, raised his hand to grip Harry’s upper arm, spun him round, and with one hand in the middle of Harry’s back and the other around the nape of his neck, he
“You… asked me for help,” whispered Draco.
“I most certainly did. He’s keen to hear a report on the product, to pass a consumer review back to his brother.”
“Oh. Then, do you
“I…” Did he? No, it was just the ways things
“It’s bound to feel harder at first. You’ve told your family the truth. I know how difficult that was. And you’re facing up to a fear each time you set foot outside. You could’ve become a little hermit, but you haven’t been hiding. But…” Draco nudged Harry’s shoulder,” I don’t think submission is the type of support you need tonight.”
Undeterred, Potter asked, “What’re you studying?”
“No. Hands behind your back. Clasp your fingers together. Spread your legs. Wider.”
Harry swung a disapproving glance in his direction. Draco shrugged unapologetically. Sighing, Harry turned back to Ron. Harry’s regrets were his own to deal with.
Although the door was plainly there to utilise, Draco continued to stroll back and forth, trying to decide if the faint scent of smoke was due to his imagination, and if the heat he could feel emanating from behind the wood was real. This was an entirely irrational fear, Draco was aware of that. But being aware of something didn’t always help to conquer it. If Draco’s father could see him now, he would call him pathetic. It had always been

Still gasping with his unresolved arousal, Harry relished the solid body that settled atop him as Malfoy tucked his head into Harry’s shoulder and breathed heavily into Harry’s neck.
Malfoy shoved again, more insistent this time.
Draco rolled his eyes and searched for patience. He seemed to be doing a

be irrelevant. Draco wouldn’t let the efforts which Potter had exerted for him go to waste.
That hardly seemed ruddy relevant. “Feel?”
“Urmm… erm…” was all Harry could manage in reply. It would’ve been easier to ignore the mental images if his trousers weren’t becoming so tight. But he couldn’t agree to that. But he
“What? That isn’t possible.”
“Head down,” instructed Malfoy. Harry bowed his head again. “Do you want to taste my cock?”
Harry should leave people in peace. In trying to be honest, he’d imploded a part of Molly and Arthur’s life. They’d been happier before Harry had told them the truth. And if Harry went away, then Draco could find someone who wasn’t so irreparably broken. Someone worth the bother. Someone who could express a sentiment as simple as the fact that they loved him. Someone who was better than -”

As he considered the almost appreciative gaze which had been focussed intently on Draco’s mouth, something occurred to him. A notion which he hadn’t previously contemplated. Potter
Prising the lid off and placing it on the mattress near his knee, Harry registered the sound of rapid, anxious breaths and realised it was coming from him. He tried to regulate his breathing into something more moderate. Better. Harry set the open jar next to the lid and dipped three fingers of his right hand into the cool lubricant, rubbing his slippery fingers against his thumb to warm the liquid.
Harry bowed his head, dropped his gaze to the rug underneath him and tried to ignore the sudden urge to cry. This whole day had gone to
Then Potter did the simplest thing; he laid a palm on Draco’s stomach as they kissed. His hand rested an inch above the waistband against Draco’s covered navel, just five unmoving fingers, exchanging body heat through the fabric of Draco’s shirt. It was exhilarating.
“Care to elaborate further?”
from this world. Needed no trace of it to exist.
. The very word rankled, but that’s all it was.
“Yes, what?”
Ron accepted the ceramic jar and whispered, “I’m really sorry, Harry,” before he retreated from the pantry and quietly closed the door behind him.
“Yes,” Harry nodded, rising and grabbing his robe from the hook behind him. Malfoy had donned his own, strode into Harry’s office and was waiting expectantly outside in the corridor, having given Oliver a shunt out of the way in the process. Harry had always admired how fast the git could move. “Gotta go.”
anything great… if Harry could trust that he wouldn’t be pressurised or judged… it might not be as bad an experience as it’d been.
Harry felt responding arms immediately encircle his waist, gently holding him against Draco’s body.
He received a full-blown laugh from Draco for that, even if it had a desperate edge to it. But a dullness soon fell over Draco’s eyes again.

Air tickled Harry’s chest when Draco breathlessly chuckled. “So…

“Why, Draco?”

Molly rose from her seat and smoothed wrinkles from her apron. “I have blueberries growing in the back garden. I’ll go and pick some. Could you please fetch the sugar from the pantry? I think we already have everything else we need on the counter.”
A quick examination of the placement of Draco’s limbs was forming a suspicion in Harry’s mind.
“Yes, I don’t see why not. You don’t have anyone to stop you. No-one’s judging
There wasn’t a sensible reply to explain the inner workings of Ron’s mind, so Harry offered a shrug. Draco remained motionless above him, and Harry listened intently until he heard the whoosh of the Floo activating in the next room.
Yes… Harry was watching. Harry didn’t want to miss a second of this.
That was a lot to absorb. Harry searched for a response. Thankfully, Malfoy seemed to have developed a patient side.
In Harry’s opinion, Ron was a fine one to be advising about safe practices today.
“Be quiet.”
He shifted enough to see that Draco’s eyelids were fluttering over an unfocussed gaze.

wasn’t an adequate amount of awake for this. He blamed Malfoy for keeping him up so late swallowing the cock that Harry was currently admiring. Hmm… that had been nice. But Harry had a meeting with that snarky Italian delegate at half eight in the morning and judging by the light from outside the window just now, or
Draco had been encouraging him more and more to accept who he was and not allow anyone or anything to force him to act differently. Harry wasn’t entirely succeeding in that endeavour, still feeling the pressure of other people’s expectations and obligations urging him to be

Harry was running out of appropriate expletives.

But Draco had promised Harry a vibrator, and Harry wasn’t sure how it vibrated. What Draco held was surely more of a dildo. There was no obvious source of power attached to it. Not that Harry was complaining, it looked suitably big to do the job.
Malfoy seemed to consider it. “Hmm, I’m not sure. I’ve been thinking of getting rid of the Manor for a while now though. So, I’ll get that sorted. The mental image of my father spinning in his grave will add a delightful spring to my step as I strip out the contents.”
Draco wondered if he’d have better luck with the name Potter had asked him to use. “Harry, we need to discuss that.”
“What’re you doing?” asked Draco, sounding faintly startled.
Resting his dry left palm on Draco’s inner thigh, Harry moved his right hand to Draco’s arse, tracing the groove of the crack, feeling the soft warmth of Draco’s skin. After a moment’s hesitation, he cautiously pushed deeper, seeking the hole within, watching Draco’s expression for any sign of objection. He found none. Draco’s eyes were heavily lidded but alert with something that could be anticipation.
Malfoy sighed. “Hands back behind your back. Raise your head and look at me.” Harry did, trying to take comfort from the resolve in Malfoy’s stare. “You are
Ron jumped as the lid snapped closed. “What did you do?” he asked.
Hearing the news that Michael was no longer a threat, Harry had a faint sense that he should be relieved. But the reality wasn’t fully sinking in yet.
The flame that was Harry’s face intensified. It wasn’t helping his level of mortification that his erection’s efforts to escape his jeans had also increased substantially.
. Not now. Not
And to his father, as Lucius’ battering on the edge of his frame appeared to indicate. It was a silent battering, but most of the insults were simple enough to lip read. When Harry had selected the library to work in today, Draco had cheerfully retrieved the portrait and hung it by the door.
The nice feeling evaporated in the aftermath of Draco’s deliberate, directly phrased question. There was no room for misinterpretation in the words, and Harry didn’t want to blatantly lie. But Harry
But Draco wasn’t done. “Are you sure that you don’t want Corner charged for what he did?”
It soon became apparent that Potter had indeed not done this before, but his inexperience didn’t deter from Draco’s delight. Potter’s lips were lubricated by an excess of saliva, his rhythm was erratic, poorly timed and punctuated by the occasional collision of teeth against flesh, but it was breath-taking, nonetheless.
“Wake up, Potter. Fill out these forms.”
Draco smiled, a slow and chilling display of satisfaction. “Well, all right then. I… won’t be able to despise you either, after that. I’m going to have to… put up with you. And watch you carefully.”

, so didn’t understand Potter’s refusal. “Do you want your friends to hear you sucking me off?”
Eventually, Draco spoke. “Then… who?”
“It has at that,” agreed Ron. “Umm… how about… you?” Ron said, clearly aiming the question at Draco.
Looking at Draco after what had happened, Harry tried to interpret his passive expression and struggled to find the right words. “I… I can’t, I don’t… I didn’t…” Aware that he wasn’t making sense, he tried again. “I can’t believe… you did that.”
“Is this okay?” asked Draco.
about Michael, but
As they stood together, watching each other in silence, palm to palm, Harry gradually let himself accept Draco’s anger for the concern that it truly was. And a part of him began to doubt if he’d
“Then I’ll keep dragging you outside in the rain. I can be extremely persistent.”
. He needed to pull himself together. Maybe he shouldn't have come here. But it wasn’t this building or its contents that were upsetting him, it was
Draco tried to lie back and allow himself to be kissed, but somehow it was impossible not to reciprocate. His hands moved upwards of their own accord, just for a touch, maybe to stroke the slopes of the hips above him, but Draco’s arms soon encased Potter’s torso, pulling him down. Potter went easily, and abruptly they were flat together on the mattress.
“No, it really isn’t,” she declared, skipping back to the main shop, swinging the long feather to and fro in wide arcs.
need you. Do you think I could’ve done any of that without you?”
“Exactly. There you go then. You could be completely rubbish. Shouldn’t be too hard for you,” Malfoy chuckled. “Or… I understand that you have an annoyingly persistent female friend who specialises in obscure and complicated legal stuff and would leap at the chance to take on the Wizengamot on your behalf. And what she doesn’t know, I’m sure she’ll bore us to death with as she finds out. So, you have choices. Option one or two or boring three, Potter. You decide. I vote for number one, it would surely be the most enjoyable.”
Harry jerked in Malfoy's grip, gulped in a startled lungful of air, and came in violent spurts over his stomach. To Harry, the intensity seemed to go on for a while.
Harry’s face had been beginning to cool but flared up again as he recalled the noise he’d made. Draco merely appeared smiling and satisfied.
“And tales of your continuing unnatural behaviour have been recently discussed around a few frames I’ve visited,” Lucius continued. “Although I’m less… tolerant of your latest choice of bedfellow. Polluting my family line is not acceptable.”
project.”
Draco didn’t seem interested in the contents of the Manor right now. Instead, he was scrutinising Harry’s face.
Potter didn’t answer. And still he held onto Draco’s arm. And
“Look at you,” Malfoy snarled from behind him. “Come dripping out of your arse like the whore you are, Potter.”
“This is going to be a

should’ve been enough.”
Harry gasped, twitching in the motionless grasp. If Draco kept saying that, Harry was going to come before he’d heard the rules, friction or not. And Harry was now far too curious to want to miss out.
“We'll see.” That was apparently the correct choice. Harry was relieved. “How hard are you?”

“I don’t
“Yes. I’m bartering methods of wand maintenance as a metaphor for sexual relations.”
Draco took a huge chance with his next words, aware of how badly it could backfire. “Do you think it’d help if you talked to me?”
Harry sighed but complied, extracting himself from Draco to sit up with his back against the headboard. He may as well get comfortable. If Harry was required to sit up to hear it, the list might be fairly long.
Neither the dreadful duo nor the other Gryffindors pushed for further information. Foolish lions. Draco wondered if Potter’s friends really didn’t see past Potter’s camouflage, or if they didn’t care. Draco certainly didn’t, but it was interesting to observe, nonetheless.
Potter’s fingers squeezed. “Nothing important, Hermione. Malfoy, this isn’t a business deal. And I don’t think this is an ideal place to talk about it.”
Harry didn’t usually let people steer him into bed and tuck him in like a child, but he was willing to make an exception just this once and soon found himself nicely installed back under the recovered duvet, magically cleaned and looking forward to whatever amount of sleep he could still achieve.
. Everything Harry had always longed for in a lover. The sound of it nearly tipped Harry over the edge, but he bit down harder and held it back through sheer force of will. He absently wondered if his lip was bleeding.
Harry swung around towards Malfoy. “What?”
before he’d spent so much time with Draco.
repeatedly cast
He’d expected to be there for a while before Malfoy acknowledged him again and he wasn’t incorrect. Harry’s knees were complaining about the position long before he heard Malfoy move on the mattress. That wasn’t unusual; Malfoy often liked to leave Harry kneeling to contemplate his existence. Harry rather enjoyed it. But what Harry was contemplating today was what his punishment would be. During their encounters, he hadn’t previously done anything which might warrant a punishment. He’d earned extra helpings of derision, certainly, but this was the first incident of outright disobedience, however accidental it had been.
Thankfully, he knew that he wasn’t Luna’s type, but Harry had a hideous vision of being chased by hordes of randy pensioners.
That must’ve been the last push that Malfoy needed, because a moment later Harry’s hips were shoved flat into the mattress as Malfoy roared out his orgasm. Harry
There was a Ministry seal of approval beneath it, glowing in gold ink.
An open hand came into Harry’s field of vision and was held still near his mouth.
Harry’s place to decide. Frowning, he tried to choose the best course of action.
“I know.” Harry stepped away from Malfoy, raising his chin in defiance of the memories. “But it’s only a house, right? I’m not going to back down from it.”
you, Potter? You need to listen better to my genius.”
Too impatient to bother with preparation after their aborted session earlier, Harry closed his eyes and tried to recreate a previous magical accident.
“Please, Harry.”
“Not at all. It’s all about coverage. Making sure that the entire surface from base to tip is liberally lubricated and snugly encased. And commitment to rigorous… buffing will be required for truly
Listening to Draco’s quiet snort, Harry hid his burning face in his hands for a few seconds before he followed Draco into the living room, Ron trailing after them both. This was
As Ron’s gaze met Harry’s, his eyes widened.
There was no obligation here. Harry had the right to refuse. Twisting back in the direction of the Weasleys’ voices, he shouted, “I don’t owe you
Draco’s eyebrow rose, displaying his scepticism. “I think there’s a lot of things you believed about Weasley that didn’t turn out to be true.”
Harry cut off that line of thought. None of those ideas were the least bit quelling to his rising excitement.
“And I know you won't want to hear this,” Draco paused and visibly swallowed, and Harry knew what his suggestion would be before he spoke it. “But I think it would help if you told Granger. Or the rest of the Weasleys. They’re your family. They won’t all reject you, they’d want to know why -”
of that lately. “Potter, open the drapes before it shreds them and wakes up the whole dormitory in the process.”
“Good. We’ll use it again.” Not wanting to dissuade Draco from that intention, Harry remained silent. “Weasley’s not as thick as I’d thought. And apparently, brothers talk when one of them gives a free sex toy to partners of family members. Weasley told
Harry could understand Draco losing patience, Harry was getting irritated with
“Please,” Potter whispered.
And Malfoy was extremely vocal with his helpful barrage of criticism throughout Harry’s hard work.
Wordlessly, he offered the scroll upwards to Malfoy who slowly accepted it with a careful expression. Harry waited while Malfoy scanned the document.
In Harry’s experience, this man could possess a great deal of patience when he set his mind to it.
,” Draco spluttered, swiping at a white streak on his chin. “That was…
At the corner of his vision, Harry could see Draco’s wand twitching in his grasp. Draco’s other hand was clenched in a fist and his restless feet were clearly itching to move. Harry wanted this interaction to be over soon and he was aware that Draco’s restraint might not last, so he got to the simplest point. “What you did was not all right, Michael.”
“Exactly what your father advised,” said Harry. "I’m going to speak to Luna.”
“Very nice, Potter. Touch your cock.
Draco moved his head to peer up at Harry. “No need to look so mortified.”
“Beg me for it,” Malfoy growled as his fist sped up at Harry’s side. “Show me how much you want it.”
The sound which left Harry’s throat was a strange hybrid groaning scream, long and loud enough to surely be audible even from downstairs.
Harry’s wrists were claimed and pinned together behind his back at the same moment that Malfoy grunted and roughly impaled him again.
Harry wondered if he would be allowed lubricant. Malfoy kept threatening to withhold it but hadn’t so far. Harry couldn’t decide if he wanted him to or not. But perhaps Malfoy thought this position could possibly pose too much risk to his genitals, because he didn’t even taunt Harry with the prospect of dry sex. Instead, he reached for the open tub on the bedside table and Harry tried to lean forward to watch as Malfoy lubed his cock, Harry’s own neglected erection swinging between them. A sharp cough from Malfoy stopped him.
“No, but I -”
Harry hadn’t been staring at anything. Well, not for long. Probably. He grumbled an inarticulate reply, lowered his head over his pretence of work and thought back to the real issue at hand: he didn’t want to be in charge. Not in the bedroom, anyway. Or on the floor, on a couch, over a table… there were so many lovely places where he could be not in control, but it really wasn’t working out for him.
,” Draco stressed.
To offset his tone, or maybe to emphasise it, Harry gripped the back of Draco’s neck and dragged Draco down to his mouth. Harry poured the love he couldn’t verbalise into other movements of his lips and tongue: soft caresses, slow tastes and familiar explorations, deepening as Draco’s tongue met his.
“I was hoping things wouldn’t still be awkward. Ron’s told me that he’s tried to talk to you, but you’ve avoided him. It’s a shame. I know things didn’t work out with…” Harry’s glare halted Hermione’s sentence. “But that was a
Yup, that’s what Harry was afraid of. Harry regarded the wistful, eager expression on the customer’s face and prayed that he wouldn’t be allowed anywhere near her or her wand.
“I’ll tell you later,” whispered Harry. This might brighten Draco’s day as much as Harry’s.
“Are you all right though?”
Draco answered with a demanding tongue, and the arms around Harry tightened as Harry reinforced his own grip, finding fistfuls of wool to anchor him as he thrust his hips against Draco’s cock. He revelled at the hard heat pushing back against his own, the unshakable strength of the man in his arms, and the mouth that could bestow derision, snark and sweet terms of endearment. The pressure in his cock tipped over, and Harry happily lost the game. Or won. Harry might even be disqualified for breaking the rules.
“Draco,” Harry whispered, trying to create their usual connection, trying to

“Fuck off,” Harry snickered into Draco’s chest.
Harry reached his destination, sat back to line his cock with Draco’s, and regarded the man who meant so much to him. Who he
. But today…
Stroking his half-hard cock to a rigid erection, Draco wasn’t looking at Harry. This was definitely… off. It was making Harry nervous. But as Draco lowered himself and inserted his hips into the space provided by Harry’s open legs, grasped both of Harry’s wrists and shoved them into the rug on either side of Harry’s head, Draco’s actions began to feel more familiarly dominant.

“Okay, give me a minute.”

“Oh, okay. What shall we study?”
“Are you positively
cast one.”
“Letter from Molly,” he muttered back. The handwriting on the envelope confirmed the sender’s identity.
If Harry leaned back much further, he was going to be horizontal. But he gave it a try, surprising himself by how far back he could go while keeping his feet on the floor. It became much more difficult to maintain any leverage for rocking his hips, and Harry’s stomach muscles burned with the effort of maintaining the steep angle. But he
“I’ve been officially invited,” Draco preened. “But only if
That evening, resolved to make headway, Draco rose from his seat in the common room.
“Me too. You can certainly take a hefty pounding. I might’ve got a bit carried away and worn myself out. I blame your tight arse and compliant nature. Can we have tomorrow off as well? I’ll make it worth your while.”
“One day, if you like,” Malfoy said, turning Harry’s quip into something more serious. “But I think that might be more than you need just now. And I haven’t done that. I'm not sure how to go about it, to be honest. Could be an interesting experiment though.”
At least Draco’s voice had been steadier, but it still sounded far from his usual confident self.
“I’m glad you did. We’d been so
. Bloody hell. Cock in my arse and come on my face. What a lovely evening to remember.”
Harry had long ago stopped offering any input about nargles and the other creatures which Luna claimed to see. Or her strange ‘feelings’. They’d proven to be correct too many times for Harry to dismiss them out of hand. And in this case, Harry agreed with them, real or not. Michael
He gasped as he felt Draco’s right hand follow suit and burrow into Harry’s briefs. However, Draco didn’t stop at an arse cheek. Instead, Harry felt a finger sneak into his crack, looking for his hole.

Harry didn’t answer.
“Honesty, remember?”
Harry was beyond ready. “Yes, Daddy.”
“No, you wouldn’t.”
“Neither did I.”
“You didn’t. I don’t think I was sleeping well, either. Yesterday was… there was a lot going on at the Weasley home.”

the act of topping, he wondered how accurate he still could be. Intrigued, Harry chose a number and privately counted down each forwards motion of his hips, not moving at a pounding pace but tailoring each thrust precisely for Draco as Harry noted the overlapping reactions and adjusted accordingly.
Harry shifted as directed, dug the fingers of both hands deep into his crack and separated his buttocks as wide as he could while still moving his hips against the table.
Malfoy’s voice came again from beyond the interconnecting door. “I presume that you’ve just come from the conference with Bulgarian delegates.” Harry had indeed. He heard Malfoy shift his chair back and move towards Harry’s office, but didn’t turn to look at him. “Why didn’t you come back here after your meeting before that? I was waiting for you.”
“Yes,
Potter’s abandoned sentence piqued Draco’s curiosity, but Draco was too rattled to pursue anything beyond the obvious.
“Good. Can we go home now?”
Harry’s fingers started to tremble again as he obeyed, the tremors continuing when he had Malfoy’s cock in his hand, feeling gratified that Malfoy was as hard as he was. Task completed, he relinquished the heated flesh and returned his hands to his thighs. Harry wanted to do only as directed and hoped that his restraint would be appreciated.
And Lucius wasn’t being as careful around

It wasn’t until he’d recovered his pyjama bottoms, yanked them on, and was attempting to tower menacingly over the still seated Potter that Draco realised he didn’t want to threaten him. Draco’s reluctance to do that didn’t make any ruddy sense either. Very little did anymore. Draco didn’t… he didn’t know
“I think it’s for you, Malfoy.”
The parchment was heating in Harry's hand, but not enough to burn. He could feel a tangible link between him and the contract, physically manifesting and pulling taught. It tightened around his fist as Harry increased his own grip around the scroll. Tighter, tighter,

“Trust me, I won’t be offering you
. When he felt composed enough to raise his eyelids, he was greeted by the sight of a motionless, quiet Potter kneeling above him, chin tucked into his chest and eyes flicking to the left of Draco’s bed, obviously calculating his route to freedom.
,” appeared to be the only words which Potter could force through his clenched jaw.
“My partner and mentor also likes to inform me that basic human decency is not something which requires gratitude.”
When Malfoy climbed in from the other side of the bed, he slid over and encouraged Harry closer for a cuddle. Satisfied with that arrangement, Harry located what had recently become his favoured spot to rest his head on Malfoy’s chest and sighed in contentment and exhaustion.
He faltered again. Harry’s instincts were telling him not to speak of this, but he was determined to tell it and let Draco decide if he wanted to walk away once he understood how weak Harry was. So, Harry tried to push it all out in a rush, just wanting to get

Gaze clearly monitoring Harry’s level of discomfort, Draco replied, “Yes. For whatever reason, he seems discontent with his current PA.”
“Apparently, that didn’t matter. Whatever you want, you shall receive,” Draco said, decorating the words with one of his best smirks. “The world is
The refusal spiked Harry’s enjoyment even further. He wouldn’t beg; hadn’t been given permission to. Instead, he released his lip and resorted to open-mouthed gasps as he hung on to his control.
“I told you before. I’m living with a wandmaker now, so I intend to take
“Then I’ll help you. I’ll be here to help you whenever you need me. Can you remember that?”
Harry how eager he was to give back as much as he received.
“For fuck’s sake. Of course, it is.”
That sounded promising enough to promote immediate compliance from Harry. He lifted himself from Draco’s chest. Draco shoved the duvet down to their thighs, and as he rolled away from Harry to reach towards the bedside table, Harry was struck by an idea and the urge to do something for
Potter’s reply from beside him was just one word. “Yes.”

happen, that’s exactly where Harry intended to be.
He was hungry, but it wouldn’t be prudent for Draco to forget the stipulations of his continued attendance at Hogwarts and dine before the meeting. Draco doubted that Potter would be so petty as to report Draco for the infraction, but nevertheless he was nervous to step out of line so blatantly. And unpleasant repercussions could occur if he was absent when and if Potter did eventually deign to appear. But Draco couldn’t wait here forever. Potter was now almost an hour late, and evidently not coming.

. Do you want to take the job with Scipiones?”
“I have nothing to be embarrassed about. My body is splendid, and my partner is well satisfied.” Forgoing underwear, Draco stepped into trousers which he’d retrieved from his own pile of clothing. Enthralled at the notion of Draco dangling loose in his trousers while entertaining company, even if it was just Ron, Harry couldn’t think of a reply. “You
“Because the brand meant that I’d

“Fine,” Draco grumbled. “Stop pawing me and you can stay. But if your friends wake up and see you here, I’m going to tell them that you jumped me in my sleep.”
“No, no.” Harry had started to relax when Draco continued, “
Luna smiled at him. “That’s better.”
“Do you have an ache?” asked Draco as his fingers lightly traced the line of Harry’s waistband. Harry nodded. “May I look?” He nodded again. “Use your words,” prompted Draco.
“We could talk about schoolwork… no, that’s not interesting. Umm, Quidditch?” Potter suggested.
Draco slapped the scroll onto the nightstand before snatching his wand out of Potter’s grasp with a low growl. “I can’t believe you did that. And with
“You weren’t worried that I would
Harry leaned to bring their chests flush and raised his arms up to encircle Draco’s shoulders.
Harry noticed that on every inwards stroke, Draco’s bottom lip shivered as if he was on the verge of sucking it in. Wanting to see that lip clamped between Draco’s teeth, Harry curved his torso forwards slightly on the next thrust, pushing Draco’s legs closer to his chest and adding a little more pressure, just
“What do you want?” Harry asked.
. Even the hero hadn’t come out of the war unscathed.
Reminding himself that he was the confident party, Draco consciously willed the shaking to stop. He almost succeeded; the shudders rippling down his arms calmed to a quiet tremble of anticipation.
hard, he might be able to bring Ron down with him. But Harry wasn’t that petty. Harry wasn’t willing to destroy Ron’s life just because he hadn’t listened to him.
Harry breathed out slowly, aware of their audience and keen to minimise the damage. In his peripheral vision, he could see Malfoy sitting very still, eagerly watching the exchange. He considered again the benefits of closing the connecting door, but that would leave him alone with Oliver. That was unappealing.
“I couldn’t sleep,” admitted Harry as he nuzzled into Draco’s chest.
Malfoy’s hands tugged Harry forwards a little, lifting him partway up the shaft inside him. Harry’s hips were urged to rotate at the height of the lift, pressing Malfoy’s cock against his prostate and nearly causing him to lose focus. Malfoy brought him back down to sit, then released him to instead rest both hands on the mattress, arms spread wide.
“You’re going to set me off again. And my cock's too knackered right now to follow through.”
“It’s as simple as that?”
be true; it was preposterous. Malfoy continued regardless of Harry’s gaping mouth. “So, where are we on taking tomorrow off?”
“That’s better.”
Random suggestions were one of Malfoy’s specialities, but drinking at half eleven on a Monday morning was possibly pushing it.
Harry just laughed as Draco grabbed his arms and threw him into the bed. Landing on his back, Harry wasn’t afforded much time to settle before Draco tugged his ankles apart.
Put that simply, it was tempting. But there wasn’t just Harry to worry about. There was obligation, expectation. And Malfoy’s employment. Harry doubted that the next Minister for Magic would choose him as willingly as Harry had.

“I think so. Yes, apparently,” Harry nodded, returning his gaze to the floor.

Abandoning the gradual build up to this moment which he’d usually utilise, Harry moved his hips with a well-practiced swivel. When the head of his erection stroked Draco’s prostate, Harry felt the shudder from Draco all the way down his embedded cock.
. Well, okay it
Feet on the floor and his back on the low ottoman, Harry watched as Draco knelt between his spread thighs. Hands on his hips yanked Harry towards Draco until his bum perched on the edge. Draco lined up their growing bulges, and Harry began to appreciate how this could be interesting… but they weren’t alone in the building. Harry was just about to remind Draco of that fact when his intervention was rendered redundant.
“I cancelled them.”
turn the alarm off now,” whispered Harry. “I should’ve thought to prevent that in the first place. It was foolish of me not to realise I’d left people exposed to danger.”
“I’m nosy. I’ve witnessed the aftermath from many of your break ups, and you don’t usually seem that bothered. But you seem bothered today.”
“We don’t need a label. We could just be
“I don’t do chit-chat, Potter. If you want to spend time with me, then you’ll need to provide a better incentive.”
Yes, it’d been almost five hours since Harry had swallowed it. A
True to his word, Malfoy’s last strike was the hardest of them all. The smack rang loud in the air and Harry groaned out his appreciation.
Trying for control, Draco deftly designed a roll to settle on top, in the groove soon created by Potter’s obligingly spread thighs. It took only minor adjustments to bring their erections together, and the shift prompted them into rash rutting, a mingled mess of tangled tongues and snapping hips and increasing pressure, sweat and heat.
Maybe he’d earn a spanking, after all. Draco might leave the vibrator in as he walloped Harry’s arse cheeks with a bare and unrelenting palm while Harry diligently counted and thanked him for each painful strike. Or perhaps Harry would be forced to choke down Malfoy’s cock, his head held still by a ruthless grip of his hair as Malfoy fucked his face. Or Harry might be forbidden to come during their next session, denied an honour only given to less useless whores, but taunted to maintain his arousal long after Draco was finished with him. Or Draco could demand that Harry keep his favourite wide butt plug in his dry hole for an entire day. Or
“Yes, I’m glad I didn’t need to do that bit. I don’t think diplomacy is my thing. I did have a lot of other stuff to do though.”
An interesting tinge of pink bloomed on Malfoy’s cheekbones during the long seconds before he next spoke.
Curious, he decided to risk another question.
Cautiously, Harry moved his hips; a slight shift forward which slid his cock along the groove, lubricated merely with Harry’s precum but gliding easily. Draco gasped again and Harry froze his body once more. He still wasn’t sure how he felt about this.

Aware that both of them were having a stressful day, Harry took a breath and swallowed his instinctual reply.

is what he needed. This man, and all that came with him. As long as he had Draco, he had a reason to fight through the rest.
Potter swiped at the sopping mass of black hair on his head, shoving it out of his eyes. “I didn’t think I’d
Potter’s reply was seeped in venomous sarcasm. “Of course, you didn’t.”
“I might be able to help you with that.” Harry had done okayish with international relations. Sort of. “I know about International Diplomacy.” Harry wanted to feel useful to Draco but even as he spoke, his confidence was dwindling slightly. It might’ve been presumptuous to offer assistance. Draco wasn’t exactly helpless. “I know a little bit, anyway.”
that.” Draco’s right hand slid across the sheet, over his hip and towards his groin. Harry lightly batted it away. With a huff, Draco returned his hand to the mattress, wriggled his bum against Harry’s erection and said, “Fine. Just as well that I have no expectations of greatness here. You
“To mock me?” Draco gritted through his clenched teeth. “Of course, it would. Fabulously entertaining.”
“Ron?” Harry asked, offering him the opportunity to explain himself.
In a vulnerable mindset, Harry’s instinctual response to the angry tone was to immediately offer apologies. “I’m
Bringing himself out of his inner ponderings, Harry smiled at Draco.
“What do you want, Malfoy?”
Harry had ways to shut that bloody creature up without moving an inch but during his current state of irritation, he suspected it might end badly for the owl. Careful not to disturb the man under him, he raised himself enough to peer at the window, recognised the bird in question and decided against that solution. The Weasley’s would not appreciate Harry using magic on the family’s favourite pet.
It was strange how much more vulnerable Harry felt without the protection of Draco’s body above him, but there was no-one else here but the two of them to witness him in his exposed state. Harry shuffled further down Draco’s thighs to hopefully give the clear impression that this adjustment of their positions was not leading to sex. Not that either of their cocks were particularly perky now.
this. And Harry
people, had valid reason to cast judgment on Draco and toss him aside with all the other worthless trash from the wrong side of the war.
“Very eloquent explanation, Potter. It’s supremely clear to me now.”
if you really want to. If you’ve managed to get an idea into your head that I’ve somehow suggested it or expect it, then you can forget that right now.” The tone of Draco’s voice stressed the seriousness of his assertion.
During what now felt like a different life, this had been what Harry
Draco tried to recover with sarcasm. “Then why am I lying here with my dick wafting in the breeze?”

bit. His erection was not wilting in the slightest and it seemed a shame to ignore it when everything he wanted might be here.
