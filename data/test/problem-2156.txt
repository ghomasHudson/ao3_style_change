Zabini and Deus snickered slightly at the mention of Zabini's stuff, even more so when Harry turned to them, bewilderment and hilarity equally evident on his face.
"Please face your swap partner, forming two lines. With
'Mate - Parseltongue - I thought.' Ron's weak stutter was interrupted by Hermione.
"And another Slytherin... hmm... SCAMMANDER, AMADEUS ROLF!" A boy with tawny brown hair and a distinctive double piercing at the top of his ear made his way toward the other students. And then it was time for the Gryffindor. "Gryffindor, Gryffindor, I wonder... POTTER, HARRY!"
Harry awoke the next morning surprisingly well for the amount of food he had consumed (namely his precious treacle tart). As if to welcome him home, the nightmares had not been so vivid or consecutive, especially for his return to the (albeit renovated somewhat) site of the battle, as he had anticipated.
September felt crisp and colourful. Harry felt a warm glow inside: this time of year had always lit a spark of excitement in him, and he was going back to Hogwarts. The thought made him buzz but an icy feeling quickly dampened his happiness. He hadn't returned to the castle after the Battle, not even looking back as he fled from the heavy cloud of pain and grief in its aftermath. He never thought he would go back.
Letting his gaze wander as the teacher began to talk about how students were chosen, Harry picked out a familiar figure at the Slytherin table. And, quite frankly, he stared.
that staircase. Every. Time.) Deus snapped his fingers at Harry, retrieving his attention.
wrist." At Professor Flitwick's words, the Slytherin girl spoke up sharply, her crow-dark hair whipping around her face.
"Hey!" Seamus' scruffy head popped up. "I- "
His only answer was a raised ginger eyebrow.
The students filed into the familiar classroom, ever infused with the scent of ageing parchment and oak desks. Musty. The indescribable undertone of magic was thick in the air. The tiny Professor Flitwick was perched, as per usual, on a precarious stack of thick volumes looking very much the same, although perhaps a few strands of silver were present in his moustache. The Headmistress talked over some more rules of the swap, questions that people had and the benefits of why they were doing it for about an hour, until it was time for the 'oath.'
"I am
"Thank you. I'm sorry if you thought I was being rude - I think you are all lovely people so far." She paused and smiled graciously, then appeared to falter. "It's just... I. Have some trouble hearing people properly sometimes - especially if there's... a lot of things going on. You see I'm-" She glanced around the group of girls, nervous. "I'm hard of hearing." She paused again, obviously trying to gauge their reactions.
"To start, a Ravenclaw perhaps. Hat?"
Sorry it's a short one. Partly writing another though, so hopefully one tomorrow as well. (Corona at least means I have the time to spare). Also a little surprise in this one :)
"Trailing Purple Kousa." Blaise definitely didn't thrill at the spark of interest? Pride? in Neville's appraising eye. "Don't think I would enjoy being shrunk either." They smiled. "A beautiful variety though - I've rarely seen one so well developed."
Meanwhile in the girls' dorm, Parvati and Padma had called a dorm meeting. Unusually, this consisted of two parts: one, without the 'cause' present - or, at least, conscious - and two, with the aforementioned involved. The cause of the meeting? Their new honorary Griffindor compatriot. Current status: asleep (they had checked). Just for assurances, Hermione had cast a Muffliato.
Whatever spells had been cast seemed to have been well able to cope with the disaster - invisible winds were whisking items up and into various trunks. Deus had cast a similar spell over his less catastrophic but no less impressive pile of unpacked stuff, with his items flying around, somehow not mixing up with Zabini's and being sorted into their places: wardrobe, desk, bedside table and even through the door on the other wall, presumably the bathroom. Within surprisingly little time, everything was packed and around three trunks were floating in front of the waiting Zabini. Harry straightened up from where he was unpacking his own things, cautiously to avoid getting in the way.
quite as oblivious as Draco says." Zabini drawled. "And I must say he says a-" He was cut off by McGonagoll, who was addressing the group.
"I've been- I was his Herbology partner. Before..." Zabini's brow creased distractedly. "Anyway," he recovered slightly, "he must have spoken about me, no?" It seemed the infamous flirt was back, but Harry couldn't quite tell whether he was teasing or not.
Lurlei nodded slightly, as if to herself, then drew her eyes up to meet Hermione's gaze. "Anything...?"
exactly, but..." He threw another glance into the room before opening the door fully, with a flourish like a posh footman. Harry later realised this was probably a test of teasing Blaise.
"If Seamus hasn't used his bed in the past however-many years, can we get rid of it and have more room for ourselves?"
"I'm afraid I don't honestly remember, err... never have been to good at focusing."
"Morning, Ron." Blaise's brief stab of annoyance (
"Then most certainly not Malfoy." Was perhaps not the answer he was expecting.
"Now then students, I shall speak as briefly as I can, but please bear in mind the wealth of things that must be mentioned. To begin, this year shall be the first in what I hope shall be Hogwarts anew, starting with House Unity. To encourage this, students are allowed to eat at any table in the Great Hall for meals if they wish. The only time all students must be seated at their table is during Assemblies. Furthermore, a four month program with a selected few from our Eighth Year will put into place. This will be explained, and will begin, during tomorrow's Assembly at breakfast.
Deus turned and grinned at him. Zabini smiled. "It's a bit worse than usual because I unpacked in a rush. Fuck, it's cold. Lucky I'm here, right?" He winked as Deus groaned and clutched his chest dramatically, obviously used to such antics. "Anyway, apologies for earlier, although not really because it was kinda needed, no?" He patted Harry's shoulder with one large hand, and smirked over him. Deus rolled his eyes amusedly, turning back to the taller boy, who smiled lazily. "What you
"Students, please show your welcome to our newest ghost, Mr. Fred Weasley."
- went weak at the knees.
'I'm glad you like it. Come, on Hermione's opening your present.'
Looking up, Harry smiled seeing Hermione already flipping through the edition of 'The Art of Persuasion and Other Ways to Change Wizarding Law' he'd got her, whilst Ron, thrilled at the one person wizard's chess Hermione had got him (seeing as he complains that everyone refuses to play him because they are beaten consecutively), was now staring with unconcealed incredulity at the second, oddly-shaped package from Harry which had been partly opened - special edition chocolate frogs forgotten beside him. Harry had hoped Ron would like it.
From somewhere behind him, Neville scoffed, baiting him. "Pan people still have standards."
"On two conditions. One, that you-"
Ron however, was not faring so well with the early start - but it was Ron so nothing unexpected. Neville, already dressed and having been watering plants by the damp sleeves of his robes (Harry had definitely gotten more observant, he congratulated himself. Perhaps death does that to you?) was half-heartedly attempting to awake and remove Ron from his bed. (Neville himself having obviously managed to extract himself from the large collection of plants and cacti surrounding his bed already, which took a great deal more skill than most gave him credit for, as Harry knew from nasty experience).
the grapevine. Well, Pansy included, obviously. Well it was rather plain now. If it wasn't apparent from the circumstances, the large, dark marks blooming over Finnigan's chest and neck were a bit of a hint.
"She does't like travelling. Being shrunk. I'll have to ask Professor Sprout for some of that special Revitalising Potion, hopefully then she'll," He ran a finger over one of the leaves gently, "get back to her more energetic self."
"I'll see you later. Sorry about this, but sure you can manage with Deus." Just as Harry was about to ask something else, something - an alarm of some kind -pinged from inside Deus' robes, causing him to cast a quick
Back to the letter. Harry brushed the crumbs of chocolate off the table (chocolate - a habit picked up from Remus. Why was it was just so good) and picked up the letter from Hogwarts. Pushing his glasses up his nose, he scanned it quickly, recognising McGonagall's spiky script.
"You don't have to do this. If you want us to choose someone else that is more than acceptable. Deus look at me This is when you need to prioritise yourself, what you are comfortable doing."
Five everyone minutes later they were heading down to the Great Hall, Ron with one sleeve of his robes tangled in the other as they hurried. Making it the nick of time as the stairs switched, narrowly avoiding a dramatic entrance (thankfully) Harry sat down at the Griffindor table, and helped himself to sausages and eggs before Headmistress McGonagall began the Assembly. Hermione had braided a section of her hair, held back under a patterned scarf today, Harry noticed absently as she passed him the beans.
" The seemingly blank stone wall slid open, and the two boys stepped into a common room in disarray: thick green curtains drawn hastily in front of what Harry presumed was windows to the Lake; a messily lit fire roaring away in the carved marble fireplace; and most surprisingly, cushions and blankets scattered on sofas and chairs. Noticing Harry's quizzical glances, Deus spoke up defensively. "Alright, probably not the hard Slytherin heart you were expecting, but it's fucking freezing in here: even more than usual. Something about the damage breaking all the heating wards."
Harry had learnt that it was good to focus on the small things first, to absorb it bit by bit before zooming out to the bigger picture. Especially in a difficult situation, it made things easier to cope. (Unfortunately he learnt this after he finished his somewhat turbulent school years.)
"Anything we can do?"
Zabini had strolled to the front of the Hall, oozing calm confidence. He fist-bumped Lurlei, who shook her head at him, smiling, and shook Harry's hand. The other was steady on Deus' shoulder as the taller boy lent down, asking, "You alright there, Deus?" At his nod and smile e turned his attention back to Harry.
'It's good to see you mate,' was uttered before he, too, pulled back, allowing Harry to take a proper look at them both. Ron was lankier than ever - if that was somehow possible - but was just as ginger and whatever sun he'd had over the summer had drawn out his freckles. Hermione probably had grown a bit too, just about the same height as himself now, Harry thought. Her hair was just as brown and bushy, although slightly curlier than Harry remembered, and it looked as if she had spent time in the sun, although it was hard to tell with her dark skin. There was a smudge of ink on her cheek: most likely from already annotating the year's textbooks.
"The swapped student will wear the other House's uniform, sit at the other House's table, stay in the other House's rooms and earn or lose points for that House. Most importantly, there will be no sabotage. Once selected, the students participating shall take a magical oath to insure that there will be no cheating. The point of this program is to make friends among other Houses, and to bring us together as a school. So now I will pass over to Professor Mervyn."
~ Note: POV Switch from last chapter ~
Suddenly ravenous, Harry ate until he was full and - the ceiling now dark indigo, spotted with mist and stars - it was time to sleep. The climb through the castle to the Tower passed in a blur. He was tired, even more so now he was full of food, and Harry's last coherent before he sank into sleep was indistinct: something about a fairly excellent start to his final year. The most he could hope for, he thought, was that this year was as normal as possible - and even his inner voice was tinged with drowsiness.
There! He'd know those voices anywhere. Opening the compartment door, he was bombarded by Hermione's bone-crushing hug.
"Girls' dorms." He said when they reached the archway, pointing to the other stairs. "Obviously don't try to get up there, not that you'd get far."
"What's with the doors?" He asked, referencing how all of the doors they's passed were
Elegantly on time as ever, Morgan took the opportunity to slither out of the sleeve of Harry's denim jacket (the first thing, along with a white t-shirt and black jeans, that he'd grabbed and thrown on that morning), where she'd been asleep, curled around his forearm.
Harry ruffled his hand through his messy bedhead distractedly. Summoning some parchment and ink, he dipped a quill into the deep blue ink. The quill hovered in midair until a fat blob of ink land on the parchment like a squid. The Squid. Hmm. Hermione would nag him to death if he didn't accept; he would probably regret it if he didn't anyway. He looked around his appartment: strewn with dirty clothes, takeaway menus and half-written replies to his friends' letters. He needed the structure, the routine, something. Sod it.
"Now, remember that you are part of this program once you complete this oath. You may leave if you wish to." His voice was kind, but no-one made as if to leave. "Excellent. Please repeat after me:
"Well, Slytherin, Slytherin... Better be ASHTON, LURLEI!" At this a tall girl with straight black hair and unmistakably aristocratic features joined the growing group of students at the front.
"Well, that was unexpected," Hermione joked.
Seamus was definitely interested in this development, having sat up to watch the proceedings. He was not disappointed.
Hermione's eyes lit up as she spoke: 'But that's so interesting Harry - do you think you could teach someone else then? This has never happened before, and that's why no-one can learn Parseltongue - it's strictly inherent. Could you explain to me the basics? I could try to document it, but only if you want to of course. Just think how helpful this could be!'
. Blaise had stopped himself earlier, but he couldn't even try now. They were pale reddish-pink, full and
Houses for the next four months after all. The majority of your belongings have already been moved by willing house elves, except for yours, Mr Zabini. The house elf was rather, ahh,
"So what we've got," Lavender added - she was usually the best at summarising: describing the situation and their thoughts with clarity certainly being a skill, "is interested/appears attentive but without input; little reaction to group conversation; more (one) response to a singular (one-to-one) conversation; slight accent and I've noticed she had these moments where she looks confused, particularly after a conversation that's long, complex or lots of us have contributed to. Hermione?"
, then, was twisting his hands nervously. He looked up at McGonagoll's kindly questioning. "Would you like us to choose another candidate?" She was almost grandmotherly, nodding at Deus' small nod.
"I thought she might be aloof or just y'know pureblood-disinterested, but I don't think it's that either. She
Hi! I think I have a few ideas for more chapters now, but I realised I forgot to say that if you have any ideas or requests you'd like me to consider, please comment them! (Also if there are any mistakes I haven't picked up on.) Lots of love as always! :)
His thoughts were interrupted by Ron, whose tone had dropped lower: guarded, warning.
bit of information away for later. "But my parents don't like it."
How had he been so blind - when he prided himself on knowing all the goings-on of the castle: knowing everyone, what they were doing (
'That reminds me. Sit down you two, open your gifts,' she directed, handing them each an item wrapped in purple paper.
Hii! Look I actually updated for once! Anyway I had a question for you lot: one of the chapters I've partially written has Parvati in, as a Griffindor. I've now realised that Parvati is actually a Ravenclaw (in the books, but in the movies she's in Griffindor). Rewriting this part wouldn't be a massive hassle but I might re-jig some parts of her relationship with Lavender (I've written them as an established relationship), so what do you think? In addition any advice on ways of gently incorporating some aspects of their background - I was thinking about writing them as Hindu? - so if you have any ideas on that front it would be greatly appreciated. (We are not and will never speak of the Yule Ball movie sari catastrophe). Thanks, and further continued thanks for your support!
'What do you think then?' He questioned.
Stumbling slightly, and attempting to un-fuddle his thoughts, Harry walked towards Draco's bed, which was neat and orderly as much as he could see. Now he could see into the part previously closed off by curtains, Malfoy was visible. He seemed to be absorbed in scrawling furiously onto several scrolls of thick parchment. Until, that is, the blond in question waved an ink-smudged hand at Harry.
'Ron, you're a genius. Wow, I can't believe that you remembered that.' Pulling away Ron looked rather sheepish: 'I just wanted you to know that I'm always here for you, y'know, and that one day you'll find someone wonderful who loves you properly. Not that I don't love you, 'Mione, its just... not like that.' He scratched the back of his head. 'Shit, I'm so bad at this.'
"Huh?"
Blaise had just finished with the plants he had found half-tucked under the bed, and Ron was largely changed by the lack of one-legged shuffling sounds when there was a muffled groan from one of the two beds with its curtains still drawn. A few moments passed - Blaise looked at Ron, who breathed a long-suffering sigh.
Ahem. Perhaps even more unexpected was that the unmistakable white-blond colour had, at the very ends, been tinged with pale blue. Malfoy still had impeccable uniform from what Harry could see, crip white collar and robes. And then he caught a brief glimpse of where the Dark Mark would have been when Malfoy absent-mindedly pushed his sleeve back as he reached for a sausage, before hurriedly pushing it back down; except it was covered by a magical tattoo of some kind - Harry could have sworn he saw the tail of a dragon flick - surrounded by some kind of flower.
"Well since we are roommates now." He paused. "I believe that perhaps if you are willing, we could put the past behind us." He acted blasé, but even Harry could sense the double meaning: forgiveness. There was a look in his eyes, a wall ready to be thrown up if needed.
"Please. I'm sorry Headmistress but I don't think- I don't think I'm ready for that kind of... pressure? Anxiety? I don't know."
"Yes, from Hufflepuff, GREEN, MARTHA," - a petite girl with golden-blonde plaits, "and WHITTLE, ALEXIS from Ravenclaw," who was a black girl with what Harry thought were tun buns of coily black hair perched on her head (a style Fred and George had apparently attempted on Bill) that Harry distinctly remembered being awfully good at Transfiguration, joined the boys at the front. Professor Mervyn also asked them what they had asked the boys. Then,
'Phew! I thought Ron would never resurface then. Seriously though mate, it's nice to see you have some insight.' Harry grinned and Ron pulled a face. 'But on the subject of snakes; I'd like to introduce you two to someone.'
Blaise was an early riser. Although, it seemed, not as early as Neville. Still in pyjamas, the other boy was carefully watering the various hanging plants around his bed, whilst an enchanted watering can did the less precise work of the potted variety. He was humming slightly, just quiet enough not to work the others.
Sealing the letter, Harry summoned his new owl, a tawny brown ball of awkward fluff (much like himself) named Tsula, and sent it before he could change his mind.
Paying only half a mind to the Sorting itself, Harry noticed several new professors at the high table., although he really shouldn't have been surprised: what had he been expecting? Once it was over (Griffindor had acquired a good lot this year it seemed), the speech began. McGonagall stood up, casting silence over the Hall.
'Yeah, a'right.' Ron agreed. 'Actually, something kind of strange happened recently. Dad was telling is all about it - you know that Malfoy and his mum have been cleared of all charges after you petitioned for them (though Lucius's gone to Askaban, thankfully) anyway, Malfoy's been clearing some stuff up at the Ministry and he went to the Muggle Artefacts Office and talked to Dad (I presume that he's been there a lot 'cause he's clearing out the Manor). But Dad said that he was really changed - polite an' all. Can you image Malfoy being polite? And he apologised to Dad for being such a bloody git to us all. Dad said that it 'looked like a huge, Lucius-sized weight had been lifted.' So maybe we'll see what that's all about I s'pose?
, that place Hermione was always trying to get him to go to; Hermione and her mindfulness, which involved far too much sitting still and listening to your breathing for Harry's liking. But now maybe he understood what she was on about as he took in the way Malfoy's hair was sticking up slightly, white and pale, forget-me-not blue ruffled every so often by one hand, and his pink-tinged cheeks.
"I'm pansexual?" Honestly, if there was any Hogwarts news that was an old one. What did Griffindors do - shield themselves from all gossip?
It was the quiet of awkward silence as they entered: Dean by the door, Seamus sprawled one a bed, Ron standing faux-casually at the end of his, attempting to look as if he hadn't just been stuffing stray clothes anywhere they'd fit a few seconds earlier. Blaise let his trunks drop onto the bed Harry indicated. Eventually Ron broke the awkwardness with a cough. He raised his eyebrows, as if to himself.
"Hell, Deus. Err, Zabini. It's..." He trailed off.
be speaking to the management." Blaise's performance was taken well. Judging by the hiccuping laughter from Seamus, the stifled laughter from Ron and the almost-laughing smile of Dean, combined with the smile crack in Neville's poker-faced delivery, it seemed that Blaise was going to settle in alright. Harry matched Blaise's grin, chuckling slightly himself, and hugged his friends. He walked out before he couldn't bear to leave.
Hey so i guess even lockdown can't make me that productive so it took another to get me to do this chapter. Quick disclaimer that I recognise that I am a white person writing Black and POC characters so if you feel like anything's not quite right or should be changed feel free to drop a comment. In a similar vein this chapter contains a HoH (hard of hearing) character (not fully deaf) so same thing goes there. (Also we will get back to the main ships eventually I promise- although I enjoyed writing chapter 8 a lot.) Hope the world is at least still turning wherever you are, love from the mess that is the UK rn (and generally). Ok bye :D
Harry wrinkled his brow to mirror Blaise's. "Well obviously the stairs won't let you up?"
to pay attention when we're talking together, but she doesn't react or join in."
Shaking his head as if to clear his ever-busy thoughts, Harry picked up the pile of his books which had appeared
"Now, you all have ten minutes until first lessons, you should all have your timetables? Good." She turned to direct her words at the small group at the front. "Now remember most of you have a free before lunch, so that is when I expect you to settle in a bit." She turned back tot he rest of the Hall. "Get along then, and make a good start to the year." She turned back towards the assembled program students. "Follow Professor Flitwick please, as he will be overseeing the oath. Deus, if you could come along for the moment as well."
Harry's mind was racing as was his heart, weirdly, as he walked into the room, barely registering the appearance of the room he would be living in. His eyes were immediately drawn to the blond figure sitting on the far bed, just visible behind partially-closed curtains. Tearing his eyes away Harry looked around the room properly, half-listening to Deus' amicable chatter. There were four beds hung in various shades of green, with the normal wardrobes and desks and a few armchairs like their dorm back up in Gryffindor Tower, only with the more Slytherin accents and decoration, as expected. In one corner there was a door, presumably to the bathroom, but unlike his own dorm, the room was more rectangular than circular, and interspersed with pictures and posters. Similarly however, the room was in a state of disarray much like the Common Room, with trunks wide open and various amounts of belongings unpacked. Deus was busily pulling all manner of items out of his seemingly unending case whilst Harry watched amusedly from his seat on the end of Deus' bed. (Although why Harry was surprised at the capabilities of a good charm, after Hermione).
'And you should get changed as well, Ron. I'm going to see Luna, Neville and Ginny as I'm changed,' were her parting words.
So Frankie was likely right now sorting the issues of the Slytherins in her own bright, steady, quick-witted way. And in her place was Lurlei.
"Remember:
"I suppose we'd better go with phase two then." Padma stretched as she got up.
"They actually do that?" He hopped up a few steps, getting about a third of the way before the stairs decided they weren't impressed, flattening to slide the intruder back to the bottom.
"Potter. Hmm. You share a dorm with Weasley I would assume, and ahem..." He cleared his throat. "Neville right? Err, Longbottom?"
I've pre-written these first few chapters so expect things to slow down considerably after about Chapter 5 :)
Still he dawdled in the common room, soaking in the atmosphere just a little more. Then he stepped through the portrait for the last time. In a while, anyway.
"I thought maybe she was shy, at the very beginning. But I don't see that now." They were seated on Hermione's bed: Lavender and Parvati wrapped in a blanket, Hermione cross-legged with one over her knees and Padma in a robe over her pajamas. They were all in pajamas - bar Parvati who had walked over from Ravenclaw, and were otherwise not dressed. Parvati and Padmas' hair were still in their braids, Lavender's in her french plaits and Hermione's still in the scarf she wore to bed. Parvati continued from her sister, one hand resting on Lavender's knee:
Neville smirked teasingly. (Surely that was Blaise's thing?) "I think the word you're looking for is
Deus ran a hand carefully over the surface. "Took us until Second Year to get it how we wanted. Add to it occasionally. I room with Blaise, obviously, Theo Nott and Draco Malfoy."
As the Headmistress stepped away from the platform, a low murmur stirred around the room. It quietened as someone who Harry dimly remembered as being Professor Mervyn due to the large number of bracelets and the bright waistcoat they was wearing, stood up.
"How do you
Malfoy had finished writing and was looking at Harry somewhat warily, as if he had been caught off guard before. Harry realised he might have been staring. Malfoy huffed.
Harry broke out into a grin: maybe this wouldn't be so bad. "Come on, I need to see what can overwhelm a house-elf." Deus rolled his eyes and started walking down a passage in on corner of the room. "I mean," Harry continued, "we've only been here one day."
"Blaise." Blaise responded, seeming to pick up on the meaning behind the actions.
) faded quickly. So the groggy voice, and now stumbling footsteps; faint sound of water from the showers,  was the infamous morning Weasley. "Actually, I better get in before the others wake up as well." Neville glanced between the showers and the few plants he had remaining.
"Shit, I'm late," he muttered, dashing off with a, "Meet you during free-" tossed back over his shoulder to Harry. Were all Slytherins like this?
hand, grab
It was not Lurlei
"Better stick to my promises, I guess." He stuck out a hand to Blaise who shook it, largely out of instinct. "Ron."
They turned to Hermione, who had one of her many notebooks open, but wasn't really reading her notes from it. "I would agree shyness was a possibility at first, but is now unlikely. She also doesn't strike me as thinking she's above us." Parvati nodded. "So I think our two options are firstly, and less likely, difficulty with English. This is suggested by her accent, and would mean she struggled with long, complex or disjointed conversations, like Lav said, however I don't
Harry nodded, attempting a friendly smile. It was difficult trying to reintroduce yourself as a friend to people who you've taken as enemies for the past seven years.
, per se, that was the problem. It was more the fact that she had spoken exactly two words to the lot of them in the two and a half days they'd known each other: 'thank you' after the brief showcase of Griffindor Tower and their dorm. Her voice was steady, aristocratically articulate and lightly accented, and had said nothing else.
"This isn't the Unbreakable Vow, is it?" A strange, whispered terror lurked in her tone, making Harry uncomfortable.
They both turned to Hermione, who was opening her gift - it was 'The Complete Advanced Book of Spells and Charms', more a tome than a book, huge. It was also something Hermione had wanted for ages. But there was something else in the orange wrapping too. Fishing it out Hermione let out a rare giggle; she opened her palm to show Harry a small silver teaspoon. Harry was confused. Looking, Ron had a slightly abashed look on his face which faded when Hermione pulled him into a giant hug.
"Now from old friends to new faces, we have plenty of new professors at Hogwarts, and so I introduce to you: Professor Asala, our new Muggle Studies teacher; Professor Acreaha, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher; Professor Aldo," and here a giant of a man stood up - not quite on Hagrid's level, but huge, "the new Potions teacher and Head of Slytherin House, and Professor Mervyn," an eccentric looking sort, 'our Transfiguration teacher and Head of Griffindor House. As well as teachers, I am sure that although we make at be sad to see him leave us, we are ultimately pleased for him as the Griffindor ghost, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, otherwise known as Nearly Headless Nick, was the target of a hex which caused his head to completely remove itself. In the aftermath of this event, Sir Nicholas has decided to join the Headless Hunt." Here Headmistress McGonagall paused to smile slightly. "We are therefore delighted to welcome a new Griffindor ghost." As if by cue - and, on reflection, it probably was - a glowing silver figure emerged from the table directly where Ron was staring. At first indistinct, the ghost gathered form: constellations of freckles not faded by death, characteristic mischievous grin and the unmistakable hair. Ron had almost fainted by the time McGonagall spoke again.
Zabini grabbed the front of Harry's robes, and said clearly: "I do apologise for being like this now, as it's a terrible light on my rather fabulous personality, but I do need to make several things clear, and get them through your Gryffindor skull. I'm not leaving you two," he gestured towards Malfoy, "spatting all day and night. One thing, if anything: Draco. Is. Recovering. If you hurt him, I'll punch you. Otherwise, welcome to the family. Now, niceties over." He grinned charmingly before pushing Harry towards the bed with two of its emerald-moss drapes closed. "Sort it out." He turned sharply to, what Harry presumed was, his own bed due to its exceptionally cluttered surroundings.
so I expect you to pack yourself. As you have your other commitments, Mr Scammander has kindly volunteered, as one of Mr Potter's new dorm mates to show him around, but I expect you to meet him there afterwards. Now, to lessons..."
Harry knocked on the door when they reached it - better safe than sorry, he felt. It was opened by Dean, who kept his hand on the edge, opening it enough to hold a conversation comfortably whilst obscuring the room behind with his body.
"I don't mind." Blaise interrupted his thoughts. "Didn't you say the third shower was a bit dodgy? "Besides, these are some of my favourites." he smiled lazily, standing up languidly for extra effect, but Neville had already nodded in thanks, faint smile on his lips- yeah, not going there Blaise told himself - and was heading for the showers. He took up the watering can.
'I.' He scrunched his nose, then pushed his glasses back up and tried to explain how he understood it. 'I can't speak Parseltongue fluently anymore. Because, I think, it was the bit of Voldemort that allowed me to do that. But I still have a kinda basic vocabulary and a grasp of how it functions. So I can communicate, albeit slowly and stiffly. I think it's like if you become fluent in a language , then barely speak it for 5 years.'
Dutifully repeating the words, Harry watched as the electric-blue ribbons of light wrapped around his and Zabini's arms from Professor Flitwick's complicated wand movements. Zabini's skin was smooth, darker than Harry's own even on the palm. "You may now proceed to your lessons. After, please meet with your exchange partner, tell them the password to your House and help them settle in. These are to be
"Bl- Zabini." Harry caught the look that flashed over Blaise's face, quickly masked, but couldn't decipher it.
And then, because the world didn't put him through enough already that morning, he bent over the end of the bed, stretching for his shirt on the far side. Blaise Zabini, flirt (and fuck) of Hogwarts - unreadable, unflappable,
Checking he hasn't forgotten anything (broom - tick, books, quills and parchment - tick, clothes - tick) he pushed his new-ish glasses (although they were basically the exact same as his old one) further his nose and shoved the trolley (which had an annoying sticky wheel at the front) through the wall. Out onto Platform 9 3/4, bustling with the gleaming red train and students loading luggage and saying farewell. The sudden pricking in Harry's eyes was most definitely at the cloud of steam from the engine rather than at the familiar hustle and bustle of the place. Sorting out his own, rather haphazardly packed, luggage and boarding the train - attempting to avoid the hushed whispers and subtle pointed fingers as he passed - Harry started to walk through the carriages, looking for one compartment in particular...
Seated once more at the Griffindor table, under the quite incredible ceiling, still light as the the sun had not quite set, Harry watched as the First Years in their fresh, ironed new robes and hats, were led up to the Sorting Hat, which stood - sat? - was proud despite a few more rips in its hem.
"Oh." Ron relaxed. Dean inclined his head, smiling thankfully.
"Morgana I need a shower."
After twists and turns that seemed designed to ensure Harry would never see the light of day again, Harry paused in front of the door Deus had his hand on.
“Me? Make fun of you?” Malfoy’s lips twitch and for a second, Harry is sure they will share a smile. “I wouldn’t dare.”
The part of Harry that functions like an adult human being on a day-to-day basis starts to wonder what time it is, what day of the week. “Shouldn’t you be at work?” he asks, trying to ignore the Pansy Parkinson shaped elephant in the room.
“It’s fascinating!” Draco says, a bit dreamy eyed. “I don’t know how they trap all of your assets in a tiny piece of plastic, but they do! It works every time.”
Harry leaves, still short a sock, as seven o’clock turns to eight. Takes one long look at the bedroom and the plants and the sheets, listens one last time for the sound of the front door, for feet on stairs, and then apparates home.
“At least it only happens at night.” Pansy words slur a little at the edges; she has her tongue between her teeth and is dabbing at her feet with intense concetration.
“I’m sorry.” Draco barely hears her. But he feels Pansy’s hands rubbing soothing circles into his back. “I’m sorry,” she says again. “I’m sorry.”
“I’m not nice.”
Was always in love with him.
Draco wanted to answer, to launch a compelling argument about the dangers of moral relativism, but his teeth had started to chatter.
Mr. Trembelt-pitbull lets out a colossal snort and snatches the script from Harry’s fingers. “Fine. But when I’m not better in a week, I’ll be back!” and storms out with about as much grace as can be expected from bullish dogs or bullish men.
“I do not glare,” Draco said, but realized that was probably a lie.
“Potter,” Pansy interrupts as if Ron does not exist. She crosses the room and grips him excitedly, gel nails digging into his skin. “We’ve got a plan”
sounded dramatic and wouldn’t make sense to someone who hadn’t seen it, hadn’t followed him into the dark.
The moon is full to bursting and washes the garish crimson shapes with clean light.
“Mother,” Draco says, but then the first blow lands and she’s ripped away.
,” Narcissa’s lip curls in disgust “that you should make use of accommodations.”
“I’m not sure that he would like—”
Hermione finds him frothing in his kitchen, pacing the ancient tile.
, was all he could think. She’d come back wrong.
Draco ignored him and savoured the way that heat seeps back into his skin.
No, this was an act of last resort. Draco had expected Potter to come back, would stride purposeful and strong into his shop and interrogate him. At some juncture, perhaps in a moment of heated verbal sparring, he imagined Potter grabbing him by his collars and pulling him close. Draco’d considered this all afternoon, as the glimpse dragged on and on. How Harry’s eyes would flare as anger shifted into something heated. Their lips would crash together and the kiss would be more teeth than tenderness. Draco would match him, Harry would push and he would pull and it would be like it’d always been, but they would fight with their mouths and not their fists, and what a difference that would make.
“Fuck,” he groans, a bit sore, a bit strained, but craving contact. “Draco are you—?”
“Mr. Malfoy?”
“Don’t tell Potter,” he says, finally.
Draco hadn’t drafted a memorial in the paper, although the investigation was made public and the Prophet printed the story anyway. He’d buried her in the gardens on a Thursday, with Pansy Parkinson and Minty as the only witnesses to his grief.
she asks.
to end this silly curse once and for all.”
All of the pretences fall from his face and Draco watches himself in the mirror, dressed in the finest robes money can buy, his feelings naked for Harry to see. He slips a possessive arm around Harry’s waist.
“Ron no!” Harry hisses. “She’s definitely asleep.” Waking up Hermione was a categorically bad idea.
“They are not.”
Harry doesn’t care. “When can we do it?”
“Sorry, I just—”
, they said. They, in this specific instance, meant Pansy, who had erupted into an explosion of enthusiasm once she discovered Draco had “gotten someone’s digits.”
“They’re all…” The words are a pound of flesh that he’s not ready to pay. “They’re all going to see.”
“You could be a serial killer,” was Draco’s rebuttal.
The fucking cat is poised on the edge of his kitchen counter. A single fluffy paw is raised, poised in front of a glass. That particular glass is special to him, a gift from Ron, after he’d agreed to be his best man. It’s got Harry’s fucking name on it.
Harry shrugs, smiling and revelling in how easy it’s become. To smile.
“Come inside, Mr. Malfoy.”
“What on earth are you all thinking!” And Draco realizes he knows that voice; it’s an insufferable voice who thinks she knows everything. Someone who was always smarter. Always better.
“No. No he mentioned something about universes after he disappeared the night we…” Harry chokes on the memory of how each and every one of his dreams had crystalized into something so intense, so perfect. They’d gotten something so right, just that once—
“Oh fuck off—”
Harry Potter looks up from his knees, skin red and blotchy and Draco
Smoke dances across his tongue, warmth mixing with the damp night air.
Harry realizes.
“For my defense,” Draco whispers and hears his words echoing around the dungeon.
“Forty degrees? Below zero?”
Harry rushes across the room, grabbing at the items on the coffee table. A stack of books, a lighter, a receipt. “Please,” he breathes, and he’s not getting enough air. “Something.” He lunges for the bookshelf, grabs at the titles. There has to be some scrap of Draco left behind.
with curry and chips instead.
* * *
“Uh—” Harry’s too tired for this.
The silence of their flat quickly lost its appeal and Draco and Pansy tumble out into Muggle London, hands clasped together, eyes huge. Pansy apparates them straight into a Muggle nightclub and Draco should have lectured her about apparition and recreational drug use, but all he can do is follow and touch her bare shoulders and laugh and laugh.
Draco doesn’t say anything, starts to move his hand in slow circles. He can feel the planes of Harry’s broad shoulders, smooth beneath his wet t-shirt.
“You are never to mention this again,” says Draco, sinking further into the couch cushions.
“It would have been quite taboo, what with him being a man and a death eater,” Hermione had said. “Bad boys seem to be your type. And he’s always been a bit of a bad boy.”
“Sod off,” Pansy says, dragging the brush over her big toenail. “You’re just cranky because I reminded you that you get pulled into different worlds on the regular.”
He’s become so used to the universes twisting these two threads—weaving their story as the central focal point. Draco had always hated novels where the romantic subplot took over, subverted the driving force of the narrative. But that was their thing. These threads were what pulled the rest together.
she says.
“Sometimes!” Harry said, defensively, although that wasn’t really true either.
“—you told him—!”
“Agree to disagree,” Potter said, eyes fixed on the road, and Draco had no idea what to do with that. A version of Potter who didn’t loathe him—who though he was
For a moment, an image of Archway Bridge flashes across his memory. Of broad shoulders trembling and headlights disappearing into the distance. The universes mix and swirl, and Draco feels himself slip under, dragged down by the current of every possible version of himself.
“I want,” Harry said.
“Of course,” Robertson says, seriously, and Draco wants to bash his skull into the countertop. Sarcasm rarely pierced Robertson’s armour. “I woo it, Draco,” he says with a wink that leaves nothing to the imagination. “I speak to it the sweet nothings of poetry and wit, now lost on this generation of hustle and bustle.”
“I do,” Harry says, and he hears Draco swallow, they’re that close.
Five years of mystery manifests into a man who is the same but also completely different. Malfoy is a verb that has been conjugated, by time and loss.
The memory inside his head isn’t much better. There were flashes, of Narcissa’s hands on his face, cold against his chest.
There’s a bit of steamy content to open this chapter. Just a gentle reminder that there will be explicit-ish scenes in this fic ;)
For a long moment, their phones stand still.
Harry thinks and then realizes that he needs to leave.
Draco panics, reaches for words to hurl, to force Potter to keep his distance. “Wasn’t enough to cut me open,” Harry flinches, “and then sew me up again. Can’t resist returning to the crime scene.”
“There are Aurors all over London looking for you, Draco.” The man turns and Draco realizes he’s a stranger, with heavy eyes and hair that’s greying at the temples.
“Small mercies,” Draco says and tugs his comforter up to his chin.
Beneath the excited voices of two clever witches on the verge of a breakthrough, Harry remembers the way that Draco had looked at him
But Malfoy’s already striding away, in the direction of the doctor’s office, as if everyone else in the department stopped existing as soon as he’d lost interest.
“I miss…” Malfoy closes his eyes and Harry can see the synthetic light in his eyelashes. They’re faint. Lovely. “The peacocks,” he says, finally.
It wasn’t like Harry hadn’t tried to go to parties. In those early days, in the student housing next to St. Mungos, Harry had forced himself to leave the mouldy comfort of Grimmauld. To drink piss poor beer and shoot clear liquid from chipped shot glasses and try to slip into student life like he wasn’t anyone special. Like he didn’t matter at all.
Harry’s eyes flutter closed, the want written on the face Draco knows so well.
There are no weapons in his bedroom. Maybe if he can make it to the kitchen. There are knives in there. Draco slips out of bed, his bare feet cold on the hardwood, and he creeps from his room.
“Do you really want to argue with me?” Granger’s voice is taught.
“It really wasn’t.”
“I knew you were still angry, but this—”
“I was worried about you,” Draco answers, keeping with the truth. The moment is too fragile for sarcasm, too breakable for humour.
Draco can do nothing but follow, swept up in a haze of instinct and pleasure. One and two and three, and he slams the last one down with a growl. “Disgusting!” he wheezes, the burn still hot on his throat.
“When you wallow, you tend to spiral,” Hermione says, blowing on a spoonful of Harry’s taco soup. “And we’ve worked quite hard to bring you back to life.”
Draco is not at work.
“Oh.”
“Oh Draco—”
“Okay.” Draco is fumbling in his pockets. “Do you mind if I?” He’s holding up a pack of cigarettes.
Draco breathes deeply—they’re not with Pansy, and it’s a small thing, but it sets him at ease. Focusing his courage on the single point of light, Draco smooths the tremble from his fingers and steps into the doorway.
The noise rushes in, the volume turning all the way up. Screams, jagged and afraid, shouting that barrels through the air, the worried sort of shouts: “Martha! Where are you?” and “Look out!” and “they’re coming!”
Draco realizes, and his stomach roils with nausea. Panic peels back his skin.
Water presses his hair flat against his face, drips into his eyes, soppy and a fucking harbinger of futility. A metaphor for his entire fucking existence.
Harry snorts, but answers immediately.
“Potter, I don’t know what—” Draco’s yelling over him, but Harry’s not listening, just barrels forwards.
The photograph replays the moment of intimacy over and over. A bark of laughter throws the doors of Harry’s face wide open and there’s a smile half swallowed behind Draco’s serious mouth. Harry can’t remember what he’d been laughing at; it doesn’t matter, really.
Robertson, Draco would soon discover, spoke five languages, had a PhD in Literature and Linguistics, and was more interested in the drama of Draco’s company than actually training him to manage a book shop. “I’m don’t care about the minutia of your every day,” Robertson had proclaimed as he conducted Draco’s orientation to the shop. “It’s not complicated. Sell the books, manage the register etcetera!”
As soon as the blow lands, Harry knows that it’s fatal. Draco’s anger peels away and reveals the hurt, raw as a wound.
“This is beginning to feel like a bad idea,” Draco says out of the corner of his mouth. Draco did not have his wand—Potter hadn’t returned it that day at his trial. Even if he had, Draco couldn’t have used it. The terms of his probation included a strict list of spells that he could use for one full year after his sentencing—none of which were offensive. Draco had been using his mother’s wand to apparate to work every day, but was permitted little else. Narcissa was bound by the same restrictions. If either of them cast a single spell to defend themselves, they would be sent straight to Azkaban.
Wind filters in through white curtains, jostling the fine leaves of few baby spider plants Draco must’ve repotted. The silence in the living room tickles the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck.
Merlin, the song is apt, and as rain pounds his windows and dripps down his spine, Draco surrenders to it. The despair and the rage and the music
There’s a voice in the dark.
It never occurred to Draco that they would come for his mother.
“Potter, is that you?”
Come find me on tumblr!
Draco’s mouth is open, Harry can feel him breathing.
Draco thinks, and realizes that his mother wants to see him. That the worry on her face is genuine and that their afternoon in Diagon had shaken her to the point of hand delivering food to his guests.
Some days, though, Harry wanted to be more of a man than corpse. Some days, he felt like Hermione had managed it and that he’d come back to life. Some days—
“Fuck,” Pansy says, her voice light. “Fuck fuck fuck.” She’s black and white and panic all over.
“I’m sorry that I haven’t had time to brush up on the entire history of auto mechanics!” Draco wails, sounding like Celine again. “Although I’m definitely going to ask Robertson for some clarity on the situation tomorrow.”
“I have no doubt,” Pansy says, seriously. “And Potter still loved you?”
A look, a tight nod, and Harry apparates them away.
Everything is bleary and bright. Draco presses his palms into his eyes and tries to push away the pain. It doesn’t work. The meat of his palms comes away black—
It had been six months since anyone had heard from Draco Malfoy. Six months since the Prophet had reported on a mob attacking
“I know I fucked up—” Harry rambles on.
“Don’t stop.”
“Never.”
He wants to argue, but knows that, with Pansy, there’s no point. So he deflects. “I can’t stop looking at your hair,” Draco says instead, and it’s true. Pansy’s hair is a jet-black bob, except for the last half inch or so—which appears to have been dipped in bleach.
Draco’s face snaps back into place—the emotional elasticity of his features returning to something haughty and indifferent.
“I want,” he says. Pleads. “I want.”
Instead, the rain pitter patters against the window pane, and Draco’s suddenly unable to bear it. Fuck the rain and fuck dating and fuck Pansy and her insistence that they can have a fresh start, if he could only stop thinking about Potter.
“Really?” Harry hears his voice rise an octave. This is not going to be good. “Not much to explain, now is there?”
There’s anger in the air and it’s starting to crest. The wave will crash soon. Draco looks for a way out, but there isn’t one. Gringotts is still so far away.
Ron’s sitting at the kitchen table, his long back a U shape as he pours over case files. Dozens of photographs and stray pieces of paper clog every inch of table space. For a moment, Harry’s filled with a twinge of guilt, and longing. This was the future he left behind when Ron joined the force alone. They could’ve been partners, could’ve gone on solving mysteries and chasing down dark wizards for the rest of their working lives. Harry would’ve taken the spot next to him and they would’ve stayed up into the early hours of the morning.
“You don’t want—you didn’t—”
“I’ve officially noted your complaints, Miss Parkinson. Now, please leave me to my self-destructive behaviours. I would like just one night where I’m not thinking about—yes, I would very much like not to think.”
“Just…fuck off Malfoy,” Harry says, turning away sharp and embarrassed.
“I wonder if they get hot playing that silly game,” Pansy says, tossing her purse and coat on to the sofa.
“—he seemed so pleased.” Flo sets her needles down and smiles.
“I’m sorry to intrude,” the man says and takes a step closer and Draco holds his ground, keep himself close to the exit. “There’s been an incident. Of some urgency.”
“She does. I’m not sure why you can’t seem to grasp this,” Malfoy says. “To her, it’s real. She can see it, hear it, feel it. What you and I see when we look at her is irrelevant. The sensation of a thousand legs touching her, the way it feels when a dozen people won’t stop yelling at her?” The room exists only for Malfoy. “That’s real. Please do not make her into a joke.”
“I’m not a—”
“In every universe,” Harry says again, and Draco takes his face in his hands and kisses him.
“You’re not peeing,” Harry said, and his boots crunched against the snow as he approached. Draco hadn’t known that snow could crunch.
And the world closes its eye.
“No. You’ve made yourself abundantly clear.” They hadn’t made it further into the house. It makes for an expedient departure.
“It’s a new club!” Blaise yelled against his ear.
“You’re not evil.”
The fondness tears a sob out of his chest. “You stupid cow,” he hisses at the screen.
The truck gobbled up the lines on the road.
Malfoy is looking at him like he’s sprouted a second head. “Why not.”
It starts with magic, but it ends with fists and feet. Draco is on the ground, can feel the pavement kissing his cheek. The blows land, one after another and Draco doesn’t cry out until a shoe connects with his nose and the world blinks white and then red.
Draco wonders if there is a currency for remorse. If his guilt guts him like the spine being ripped out of a fish, does that edge him closer to decent?
“I was just looking for a book recommendation,” Daniel says, attempting a rescue.
Potter must have woken up, which is a bit odd—he usually stayed in the car when Draco stood on the edge of oblivion and stared into the distance. Casual dramatics didn’t seem to phase Harry in this universe.
“Draco. Thank you,” she said. She crossed to where he was standing. Awkward. What on earth was one supposed to do with ones arms in these situations? Oh, fuck it; Draco had saved Harry’s life, and they weren’t children any more. Draco was a Healer and a good man and if Blaise was right, he loved Harry. After another moment’s hesitation, she wrapped her arms around his neck and shoulders. Tight, and hard, unwilling to let go until he had some idea of what it meant to her.
“I need your help,” he said. “Do you have time right now?”
Hermione strained against Blaise’s grip and gaped into the wide-open space.
“Well, have you thought about taking a different approach? Dating, perhaps? I know Blaise likes you —”
He didn’t miss soft curves, or breasts, but he missed having hands on him.
Draco scrubbed his hand through his hair. “Whatever… whatever happened in his head — Harry tossing Potter hasn’t laid eyes on me since we were seventeen years old, and whatever bizarre fantasy world he cooked up in his head… it’s not about me. Fuck, maybe he had some kind of boyhood crush, I don’t know — I was, of course, very very attractive and important.”
She was right; it was time to go.
if they have passed all exams.”
“D’you ever think it’s funny, how these doors don’t open, Harry?”
“You know I won’t let any harm come to you.”
Harry Potter wouldn’t invent a whole character in his head to satisfy some ridiculous schoolboy crush.
“Grimmauld Place,” Hermione said. “We can clean it up, and live there. It’s only a step from the Burrow via the Floo. We can keep busy, get to therapy, enjoy some quiet…”
Because.
He wrapped a heavy robe around himself and descended the stairs in the pre-dawn dark. He was surprised to find Draco wide awake, staring out the window with wonder in his eyes.
“You are so very charming, if obvious.”
She threw a noodle at him.
“Mrs Malfoy,” he said, as she stepped away. She turned to meet his eyes. “Thank you.”
a complete sentence. He didn’t know how to be. No one had taught him. “I don’t know the forks to use. I don’t know how to dance. I don’t know how to show someone I care about them, except by throwing myself in the path of danger to keep them safe. I couldn’t be a good… I wouldn’t be good enough for… and anyway.”
She flushed. It had taken years of living outside the Muggle world to really understand that there was no kind of stigma. And still, she found herself assuming that everyone was straight until proved otherwise.
Malfoy looked rather like he’d prefer not to have the conversation again, and only grunted. Harry wondered if he agreed at all, or if he’d learned to ignore Neville. He served himself some lunch, and had only just begun to lean over it possessively when Malfoy gave him a pointed look.
Harry’s fingers traced the curve of Draco’s cheek. “I can’t wake up to find you’ve gone without a word again.”
When the day’s classes were done, and students were tucked up safely in their common rooms, already complaining about how much homework they had, Draco sat by the fire in a pose he had learned best served him when he sought a specific memory. It took a few minutes, but he found it.
He sat on the edge of the bed, and rubbed the potion into Harry’s arms. And then his hands. Especially his hands. Rough and calloused and scarred and so fucking capable. The fingernails broad and certain.
“If you let yourself die,” he said, pretending his voice wasn’t weak and watery, “I swear by Merlin and Morgana that I will raise your ghost and make you haunt me for the rest of my life.”
“No war,” Draco repeated, quietly. “I might have missed a few things, but this is most of it. The big things. Right back to here.” He pointed to the day that Harry’s parents died. “The day he killed Voldemort forever. And was sent to live with Sirius and Remus, who doted on him for the rest of his life and dote on him still.”
Draco tensed briefly, and Harry remembered the mirrors. He looked up, flushed with apology, but Draco seemed to want to speak no further of it. He tugged at Harry’s arm until they were pressed close on the bed, legs slotted together, Harry riding Draco’s thigh and Draco arching his back to do the same.
But he’d always been busy, and he’d never failed to make time for himself. Because making time for himself had always been easy; out dancing and drinking with his friends, making quiet bets with himself about whether or not he would end up sleeping with Luc again. Eating rich food and enduring quiet debates with himself about how much he could drink based on how much time he might have to spend in meditation in the days that followed, how much time he might have to spend slipping unobserved into his patients’ dreams (they didn’t all need that, but those who did — they
“Of course! Who was it you’re here to visit?” She looked eager to help.
Now the night he hadn’t been able to ignore was coming back to haunt him. He leaned on the sink, a frightening parallel to years prior. This time Draco wouldn’t take his place and offer anything. And it was all Harry's fault. He was crying now, the idea that Draco was dying and it was probably his fault. His breath was coming quick and shallow. His ability to see the world narrowed and he clung to himself, falling to the floor and holding on as tightly as possible.
He’d told Hermione he was getting coffees for them, but now he wasn’t even sure where the closest elevator was. And that had been over twenty minutes prior. But how the hell was he supposed to navigate this insane maze? With oppressive lighting and low ceilings. It wasn’t as if he spent a lot of time at St. Mungos. A lot of aurors were wounded in work but he never ended up going into auror training. Ron had though and had done exceedingly well. He’d been injured a handful of times in the past five years but Harry never navigated the hallways without Hermione, and she always appeared to know where she was going.
“Would you be so kind as to elaborate? What, are you that ashamed of yourself?”, Draco was right behind him, not letting up, “I should have fucking known you’d be too deep in the closet for this. Everyone thinks you are so bloody brave and perfect but you are just a scared child,” He was angry and knew exactly what buttons to push.
That night Draco had invited Harry to his flat for dinner instead. Over candles and nice wine Draco told Harry he loved him and had for years. Harry's brain had short-circuited. In the years since school, he hadn’t dated at all, much less been in love. At that moment it was the scariest thing anyone could have said. So he said nothing. At that moment he had to face everything he had been ignoring. The way he felt, pretending it was something else because everything had been so hard already he couldn’t handle anymore difficulty. He hadn’t even told his therapist or said it to himself that he might like men. Before he knew what he was doing he realized his chair had tipped over onto the floor.
He was lost of course. The hallways led around strange corners and did not seem to be leading anywhere.
He turned his head to the nurses' station to see the young woman manning it preoccupied with paperwork of some sort. Stepping as shallowly into the room as he could he managed to hook a finger on the metal folder on the wall. Then he retreated around the closest corner for inspection.
Her eager expression dropped at his words, “Oh, Mr. Malfoy. It’s so upsetting,” she kept her voice low, “it’s especially rare for it to happen I don’t blame you for not knowing. For most people, we go through life without even noticing the subtle clues drawing us to our destined partners. We feel drawn and there is no real reason to reject this feeling. But sometimes one of these people rejects the feelings, they reject the connection entirely and the connection severs. It has to be strong and emotional from what I understand and unrectified it becomes deadly. It happens so rarely we don’t know much about it.” She stayed professional but she must have noticed his eyes widening and brows creasing. Internally his heart had dropped to his stomach and heart painfully, “I, myself, don’t know the exact details of what happened but he isn’t doing well. I think he could have longer but his will to live has been wounded too.” Her smile was tense as the seconds passed.
He ignored the lump in his throat and opened the chart. He didn't understand most of what he was reading, it seemed to be stats at certain hours of the day and a list of potions that had been administered. That told him very little but he finally got to the section at the bottom with the diagnosis.
“Draco Malfoy? It was room 408. I feel foolish not knowing what it means to have a soul bond severed.”
“I’m not lying.” He sat up fully and leaned in quickly before Draco could protest. He caught his beautiful warm lips with his and kissed him with everything he had.
The kiss was broken by Draco first who buried his face in Harrys' neck clutching him almost tight enough to press the air out of his lungs.
Something about the phrase tugged at his mind but he couldn’t pull an explanation out. He tiptoed down the hall and replaced the chart. Draco hadn’t seemed to even shift in these few minutes. He strode to the nurses' station and caught the attention of a young woman, smiling brightly in greeting. Her face had dropped momentarily in shock before she reined herself in. She greeted him before he could speak.
pulled into another universe,” He steps around the corner and into the room. “And I didn’t believe him and now he’s—”
she says, weaving her fingers between Draco’s and tugging.
“Amber, have you considered the benefits of a mobile unit? Like, have you actually thought about it? The cost-benefit analysis is excellent.” Malfoy’s voice is pressured, as if he’s trying very hard not to lose his cool.
universe, is the one in crisis.
“Can’t we save it?” Draco says, and Harry notices that his hands are shaking. “Can’t we just—not?”
“Abnormal heart rhythm. Is everyone off the stretcher?” Harry’s eyes swallow the room, sees the bed clear. “I’m going to deliver a shock. One hundred and twenty joules.”
“You feel…God Harry, you feel—”
“And it’s Emma,” she says, her look shifting from professional to withering.
“—Hit his head—”
“The maniac grabbed me,” says Draco, but his words fizzle on the way out. He’s too tired to be angry.
“Horrible monolinguals. There’s no hope for any of them—”
“I cannot believe I agreed to an extended stay in a vehicle with you.”
The Yaxley manor went up in flames. Antonin Dolohov was beaten within an inch of his life by twenty people in front of the Three Broomsticks. Celestina Warbeck put out a single called
“I’m not.”
Draco tries to soothe Pansy with shushing noises and promises of tea biscuits, but she will not be tamed.
Harry dreams of a light at the top of the stairs. Of snakes that talk and Celestina Warbeck. The voices seep in, his sleep’s seal broken and leaking.
There’s something cheeky in Pansy’s expression as she talks to the barista-bartender, something far too innocent in her eyes as she returns with a glass of red for Hermione, a Bacardi Breezer for Ron, and a hot cocoa for Harry.
“Fuck, please. Please Draco.” Single words stutter out of him. “Fuck me. Please. Please.
“Cursed?”
When Harry had come to, had managed to blink the white spots and the red from his eyelids, Narcissa lay beside him, hair still stained, lips still blue, and her mouth opening and closing in a silent scream that tore Harry’s heart out through his throat.
“Who?” Amber says, her forehead creasing in concentration.
“Don’t wanna live by myself by myself anymore!” He lets the strangled note drift off as it fades to black.
The pigment drains from Pansy’s face. “No,” she says. “He’s not.”
“I’m not…” Potter’s mouth twists into a frown. “I saved you, didn’t I?”
Harry thinks, bitter with exhaustion.
“You’re being dramatic again—” Draco tries to say but Pansy is not having it.
For weeks after Malfoy vanished, Harry’d lain awake at night, replaying the last time he’d seen him, revisiting every memory he had from after the trials. It’s agony, but Harry replays each moment, trying to pinpoint if there was a place where he could have done things differently.
“You’re conspiring with the enemy!” Ron goes on, glaring at Pansy.
“I just—” Harry considers his words for a moment, and then decides that it’s been a strange day all around and that he’s got very little left to lose. “I’ve just had a lot on my mind. Needed a break.”
“No stalking,” Hermione says, directing a cheeky smile into her soup.
“He does what I do now. He was a crisis worker. He was…” Draco swallows. “Kind to me when no one else…well, he was kind and I thought, this…this is something worth doing. This might be able to fix things.”
“Believe me,” Potter said, and his hands tightened around the steering wheel. “You glare.”
he thinks, “Yes.”
“Another five hours.”
“You could tell me,” Draco says. “About what you’re doing up here.” Although Draco is starting to understand, thinks he might know.
Those green eyes are hard and flat when Potter says, “Not like this, Malfoy. Not where people can see.”
“What are those?” Harry asks, looking for something, anything to distract from the fact that he’s here, with Malfoy, and filled with a want that he’s definitely not supposed to have. The wall behind Draco is enormous and covered in dozens of colouring pages. They’re mostly done in crayon, with a wobbly hand.
“Let’s all just stop yelling?” Hermione says, stepping between them. “We all want the same things. Why don’t we all just work together?”
Harry realizes and his chest contracts with want and then explosive panic.
Harry comes with Draco Malfoy inside of him, green eyes meeting grey, pinned in place by desire that’s raw and desperate and
“Not to worry!” Draco says, mania spilling over. “We’ll be all over the front page of the Prophet. What luck. You’ve always loved that.”
There is a moment’s hesitation, a half second where he shudders at the idea of touching her, and lord old prejudices die hard, don’t they? Teeth gritted, Draco takes her hand and Granger pulls him to his feet. Her brown eyes are still bristling with suppressed rage and Draco isn’t sure if it’s directed at him.
doing here?” Pansy closes her eyes, mutters something under her breath. “Potter, you hideous wet sock, I live here!”
“You’re crushing me, you know,” Draco mumbles into the dark, and Harry sees himself close his eyes in undisguised relief.
“Oh.” The tension settles. “Sorry. I don’t know…how to act with you,” Draco says, and Harry knows exactly what he means. Fighting and dancing aren’t all that different.
“I’m going now.”
The world is too bright, too fast, the dance floor a blur. Draco disappears into a haze of
“I know,” Hermione says, that expression still playing across her face. This was dangerous; Hermione was dangerous.
Waiting felt pointless and a bit pathetic. Malfoy had left and there was nothing Harry could do to make him stay.
But then Draco sees him and knows.
“But his father works for He Who Must Not Be Named! He’s right here—”
The sounds of the stranger’s release mingled with the muted thrum of the music. Celestina was finishing her condemnation in a low, pitchy note.
* * *
“Sixth—I didn’t—I don’t—I’ve never had feelings!”
Malfoy nodded.
Harry ignores him because the idea of being close to someone—no, to Draco—is the only thing he wants. To lose himself in something that doesn’t hurt.
The living room drifts out of focus as Hermione explains how it could all go wrong and Harry could get stuck and never be able to return to this world. Harry barely hears her, isn’t concerned about consequences because he knows he’s going to do it. That it wouldn’t matter what they suggested, because he would do anything to get Draco back.
Harry’s hard. He’s so hard and he can’t move. Wants to touch.
and gives in the pull.
“Didn’t they run that headline ten years ago?” Harry says, trying for nonchalance. Draco’s never gotten used to the press, the microscopic attention honed in on everything that should remain private, blown up for the world to see.
“I’m trying to explain.”
“You’ve made it your fucking profession!” Draco is vibrating with rage.
Narcissa had wrapped her thin arms around him; it was an unconventional pose for a side along, but Draco leaned into it.
“Hermione.” Harry’s suddenly tired beyond reckoning. “You can’t be serious. Malfoy didn’t disappear into another universe. I’ve never even heard of a spell that can do that.”
“And you love me for it. Now stop obsessing over how perfect Potter was and how evil you were. You know it’s not that simple.”
“Excellent literary criticism,” says Robertson. “In this graveyard, Hamlet stumbles upon the skull of the king’s jester and a man he once knew. Enter Yorick!”
Together, his hands clasped, his chin held high, he follows Harry through the doors and into the light. Draco faces his future with Harry Potter holding on to him, refusing to let go.
“What?” Harry’s confused and Draco wants to sob.
“How cold is it out there?” Draco wondered.
Draco wonders, as he takes the drinks from the barista-turned-late-night-bartender and walks back towards his table.
But that plan backfired spectacularly, as all of the sounds sharpened. Malfoy’s hand moving, sharp breaths, and the crunch of gravel under shoes.
. Still wobbly from whatever had been in those shots, Draco pulls his cell phone from his back pocket and tries for a text.
“Universes Pans. They’re universes.”
Fists pound against Harry’s chest, his fingernails tear lines into Harry’s arms. He rails against Potter’s firm chest. Violence. It’s all violence.
Another fucking dream.
“I don’t know, Harry.”
Harry, holding the sharp edges of Draco’s face like a shattered piece of porcelain.
“You don’t think?”
, Harry thinks, but just says, “Er—”
“Stop it,” Potter says, and his eyes are on fire. His grip is firm and he doesn’t let go. Not when the crowd starts to settle, not when the members of the Wizengamot return, looking grave. Not even when they read the verdict of their deliberations.
Harry had flown through the gaping wound where the entrance had been, his own wand out, his magic skittering across his skin.
Ron is spreading a line of salt in a circle, operating under Hermione’s careful instruction. “Yes, that’s right,” she says, following behind him with a cloth and a small bucket. It looks like the kind of toy a child would use to make a sandcastle.
The confusion settles on him slowly. Spell Damage was not where they kept the dead. “What did you mean, you
“John?”
“The darkest timeline,” Draco says, finally into his bedroom. He slams his door behind him.
Draco strips his coat from his damp shoulders, drapes it across the back of the sofa, and strides towards his sound system; he’s upgraded in recent weeks. Tall speakers sit in the corners of his living space, connected to a large CD player. It had taken the better part of a weekend, in which he had nearly spooned Pansy’s eyeballs out with his kitchenware, but he’d managed to put the entire contraption together himself. Draco is quite proud of this.
Draco shrugs. “I’m struggling to see how it matters, whether I snort myself into oblivion or take a hundred of these bloody things or just sit in my flat alone like a good little boy,”
“Uh huh,” Pansy says, mouth open. “And then…”
“I think I might want to make love to your pen,” Harry says, watching how smooth the ink looks coming out of the tip.
“Who?”
“What?” Harry asks, still stunned by how very wrong this recognisance mission has gone.
“I actually thought there were under the front end, where all the metal contraptions are.”
created a world where wings sprouted from Draco's back on the full moon
“I want them to see.”
“I see. Well, make fast work of those.” Malfoy points a long finger at the mess of files cluttering Harry’s space. “And we can go to Emma’s house party.”
“So,” she says, settling next to him on the sofa. “What the fuck did you do to Draco?”
It hadn’t.
“Look,” Harry says, body impatient and feet itchy to move. He didn’t have time for vague chats with a morality curse. “Can you help me find him or not?”
follows
“You’re filthy,” the man said. “This is so wrong.”
“Draco,” Harry says again, as if his name will spell away all of the hurt. “Please. It’s me.”
“Fuck.”
“You were like this,” Harry says, words unvarnished and he should be terrified, but he can feel Draco’s panting, breath warm on his cheeks and fear feels impossible when he’s this close. “I thought you might kiss me...”
“I am not! I’m not. I’m…” Harry spins, and his shoulder takes out an entire pile of paperback mysteries. “I’m not?”
Draco had thought three exclamation marks a bit excessive, but he had not met her in the grass to tell her so. Instead, he’d owled her a time and a place deep enough in Muggle London that no press would catch on.
“Involving your mother.” The man delivers the line without feeling and it takes a moment for Draco to realize that
—smiled.
“Well, I am formally declaring this a terrible idea,” Pansy says, settling down and crossing her legs in front of Draco and his multi-coloured drugs. She gives one of the tablets a gentle sniff. “I want that on the record.”
“Yeah,” Harry says, thinking of sixty-one different universes. ”That’s pretty spot on actually.”
something. Wanted to do, to fix, to help.
“Uh—”
Lets him.
“I want you,” Harry says, pulling him towards the light. “I want you where everyone can see.”
“It means that she can hear people speaking to her. All the time. Lucy has a voice profile of thirteen abusive hallucinations. And, how did you put it, Megan?” Malfoy pauses to let the tension simmer. “That she was talking to the walls with her ass cheeks hanging out?””
Draco finds Jesus and then tips into a universe where Voldemort wasn't defeated at the Battle of Hogwarts (he’s having quite a day). Weariness watches the traffic flow on the edge of Archway bridge and Draco discovers that heroes are not always unbreakable.
The sobs that come are dry and heaving. For a long time, Harry can’t breathe, can only gasp past the tightness, dry eyes making a mockery of his grief.
“Hmm?” he answers, not turning around. The gold in the fields reflect the bonfire in the sky and Draco closes his eyes and breathes. Just breathes.
“I know it’s not your typical night club,” Draco says, very pleased with all the Muggle lingo he’s picked up. In the early days after the war, he and Pansy decided that the Muggle world was—a bit ironically—more welcoming to former death eaters than the wizarding one. “But they’re open until midnight, you don’t have to yell directly into my ear to have a conversation, they serve liquor, and we’re the most attractive people in the place.” Draco looks around. “By quite the margin.”
It turns out, Pansy’s solution to his public flogging is to abandon Wizarding London altogether. For a moment, Draco’s too touched to feel anything else. But it’s only a moment.
“Look,” Harry yawns, surveying the room for the first time and realizing that they must’ve been here for several hours. Hermione has entered full research mode, the evidence exploding all over the floor. “I’m just going to shut my eyes for a bit. Just a bit.”
Harry hadn’t known why, exactly. But for the first time in months, he
“Here.”
“How do you know about this stuff!” Daphne asked, throwing the shot back with abandon.
Brown curls mingle with Pansy’s black hair. Halter-top has her hands all over Pansy’s leather tank top, has dropped down to taste the skin on Pansy’s neck. Draco reaches out, takes one of Pansy’s sweaty hands, shoots her a questioning look. “Having fun?” he yells over the din.
There is a brief mention of a universe in which Draco is a burlesque dancer. This is a shameless nod to
An entire week goes by and still, Draco does not come back.
Harry watches his own eyes close, sees himself press his head to Draco’s, match his breathing, and then, finally, sleep.
Mike’s wife Frieda is rubbing soothing circles into his back while bloody vomit pours from his lips. Forty years of marriage, with three kids and eight grandkids. Harry knew all of this. Details tended to filter through the breaks in the trauma and crisis—the last bits of the night, coloured in “You still don’t know what’s wrong with him?” she asks, calm in the way that matriarchs tend to be—straight-backed and strong in the face of a tragedy.
Harry ignores her. “Do you think he…” he struggles with all of the concepts that’ve just been explained to him. “He got pulled into a universe and couldn’t get home?”
“The end result?”
. It’s a strange universe, he supposes, as he lets his eyes drift over to the man sitting across from her.
“You’re being dramatic,” Narcissa said, but Draco knew that he wasn’t.
Draco resisted the urge to hide behind the stack of books in his arms. Robertson had a firm “no bags” policy. Not in an effort to save the oceans or out of concern for his carbon footprint. No. A sign on the door proclaimed that “BOOKS NEED TO BREATHE! CARRY THE STORIES IN YOUR ARMS; DO NOT STRANGLE THEM IN PLASTIC! RESPECT THE CRAFT!”
“Okay,” Harry says, helplessly.
Bella narrows her pale blue eyes at him, staring straight back out of that horrible squished face. They’d be having some variation of this same battle for the better part of three years.
“Try me,” Harry says, flatly.
“Who? How?” Draco gasps.
Come find me on tumblr!
“Yes,” Pansy says at the same time Narcissa says, “If necessary.”
“Lucy doesn’t just see insects crawling all over her body, although that would probably be enough to drive each of you over the edge.” Malfoy is channelling the tight rage from behind his eyes into words. “She feels them. She can feel their legs scuttling across her stomach. Slipping on top her eyelids. Would you want to keep your clothes on if you had an infestation living in your skin?”
“I’m looking for the crisis worker?” Harry says, surprising himself.
“You impatient little shit,” Harry says, fishing a tin of soft food from the bottom shelf and spooning it into her dish.
The idea had been Hermione’s. “Muggles have cured all sorts of things we haven’t. And their pharmaceuticals work in places where potions just can’t compare.” Harry agreed, and it was why he was here. In one of the few ERs with integrated ties to the Ministry.
, Harry thinks and then shudders in spite of himself. Drilling directly into a bone has always given him pause.
Harry wasn’t running. He wasn’t. He was just exiting the situation with haste.
Pansy’s hands still.
“Yeah.” Harry finally closes his eyes, leans in to the pressure of a thumb stroking his jaw. Something warm brushes, soft, gentle against his lips.
he thinks.
“It’s old magic,” Hermione says. “And was
in the middle of the day in Diagon.
Harry moved fast, the light of his
“Pansy was just updating me on the situation,” Hermione says, crossing the room and leading Harry to a squishy accent chair.
“Have you lost the ability to speak?” Draco’s voice snipes at him. “I’ll admit, I thought that your intellect would have increased somewhat considering that you’re a Healer now?”
“But she doesn’t actually have bugs living—”
“A counsellor!”
“Completely hopeless,” Pansy replies, and Harry’s too tired for this.
A tattoo, dark on his pale forearm. Flowers lazily wrapping their leaves around a faded skull, weaving in between the snake and distorting something monstrous into something changed.
“Do you promise not to laugh if I tell you that I’ve got absolutely no idea?”
Harry turns back, a split second of a look. His eyes are hollow, cheekbones a closed door. There are no tears—not here, where people could see the display, not ever with Potter—but there is something like tragedy in the furrow between his brows.
“A bit of tightrope walking.”
Someone steps into his path. It’s a thin someone, with skin that hangs limp on his skeleton.
“No!” Harry blusters. “It’s not—I don’t even—”
“Go to him with the words of your betters,” Robertson says, finally. “Do not enter battle empty handed. Bring the wisdom of philosophers and the whimsy of poets.”
The air is chilly and it makes his bones shake, but Harry pushes out into the street. The pavement stretches on and on and Harry lets the rhythm lull his thoughts into submission. Running, he’d learned in the months after the war, was the only time that his thoughts would turn down. The rhythm and exhaustion swallowed them up and so this is where he went, when the sadness came for him.
There’s an earthquake of public opinion and Draco was scared to go outside.
John just shrugs. “Past is fixed, isn’t it?”
“Fiction is an excellent source of escapism,” Robertson says. He looks wise in the way that Dumbledore always had—the realization makes him queasy. “But, alas, every fictional world will come to an end and we will be forced to confront the very real troubles we’d sought to leave behind.”
“You know,” Harry says, pushing through the regret and pulling a ballpoint pen from his pocket. “I thought I would miss cleaning spells the most.”
“Megan,” Harry guesses, although he’s not really sure which nurse followed him in. “I need you to hook up the monitors. Heart rate, EKG, blood pressure—”
“Where did you go?” Harry asks.
Harry Potter looks at him like he’s in love.
“But why?” he asks Ropson—that was the Auror’s name. Ropson. The question was loose and confused, as if he were asking after a family friend or a public figure. “Why?”
he thinks, striding towards room 4 with the confidence of a healer completing his last residency.
“But—” Harry’s desperate to turn over this one rock, to stare at the hideious underbelly of what they’d done to one another.
“Whatever.”
“That’s right.” Pansy’s picking at the varnish on one of her nails. It’s bubble gum pink. “We’ve been dealing with it for years. He’s fine, usually.”
“Oh, right. Draco,” she says, pinching the bridge of her nose. The old fake leather of her office chair is peeling. “I’m sorry, who are you?”
“But I can’t ask for that right now. The department has other priorities.”
“Please,” Harry says, but already knows that Draco will give it to him.
Truthfully, though, it’d been a lost cause from the very beginning, since that first night when Potter had kissed him under the stars.
The Emergency Room had slowed. Malfoy had looked up and Harry pinned like a butterfly in a shadow box. He looked at Harry like he was a mirage, grey eyes wide and afraid.
The words crack the safety he’s found here, chasing the highway’s end.
The house unfolds into a bedroom with forest green walls and chipped paint. A few are people smoking, draped across the bed like spare clothes, the others wobbling into red cups.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. The truth of it is too heavy; he’s alone now. The last Malfoy. He’s never been very good when left on his own. “I’m so sorry.” An apology is not enough because it won’t bring her back.
“It is,” Hermione says, and even though it’s approaching one in the morning, Harry sees that look burrowing in. Hermione has her thinking face on. “As much as he was an entitled blood purist, he was also clever.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s dancing, Draco’s smoking, and Harry knows he’s really not supposed to want this. He does anyway. (Typical, Harry. Way to be predictable)
His fingers dash to reply—filled with adrenaline because Draco had asked about him, but Draco is a prodigious texter and beats him to it.
The mess is his fervour boiled over—violent urges that roared in his ears whenever Malfoy completed his orbit into Harry’s atmosphere. He’s ashamed of it. Of the uncontrolled ugliness of it.
"Right," Pansy is saying, nodding along to the beat of Hermione's plotting.
“Fuck off,” Harry says, squirming. Under his tighter-than-usual fashion choices or Malfoy’s more-intense-than-usual stare, Harry can’t be sure.
“I suppose that’s one way of putting it,” Draco had said.
But then Ron and Hermione are on him. For just a little while, the weight of their bodies and the weight of the future seems to balance, and everything feels calm.
“You entitled little shit!” the man shouts, and this would’ve wounded Draco on any other night, because he thought he’d been quite polite.
“I can’t do this.” His words were greedily swallowed up. “I can’t…” Harry pushed blindly through the crowd. Move. They needed to move.
“—to discuss it, yes yes, so you’ve said. Every time I’ve raised suggestions for departmental improvements. I’m familiar with the ways in which you placate my initiatives.”
The moon softens its gaze, smoke drifts into his nostrils.
No one has anything to say to that. “The risks,” Pansy says after a long pause. “We should go over the risks.”
Hermione considers him. “Sometimes I wonder if we should just be rid of the Statute of Secrecy altogether. Because you’re right Harry. There’s something unconscionable about watching people die when we know that we could save them. We could save them, and it would be easy.”
Pansy sighs extravagantly. “It’s multiple universes. Different worlds, where he lives as himself until the curse decides it’s done with him and sends him home again. It’s normally not a big deal.”
“But how will we figure that out—” Harry starts, but Pansy interrupts.
“Thanks for nothing,” Draco says, and he means it to be flirtatious. Potter always finds him, no matter what he does or how unlikely. Potter finds him.
“When was the last time you showered?”
Harry starts, head jerking around. “What are you doing here?” Harry snaps, but it’s a brittle thing.
“I should get the healer,” Harry says, releasing him. There will be bruises, he’d held on so tightly.
“That’s not—just give me—” Harry takes several measured breaths. “I’m—” he hiccups, “fine.”
, that laughed at him, cold and bloody, and insisted that he could never love—
“Where!” Hermione redirects, reading Harry’s face like it’s made of words rather than skin. “Where did you find him?” Hermione blows on her soup with a bit too much enthusiasm. Bella licks at her fingers.
, he’d said, thought, known in his bones.
“I’m not—!”
“You can’t save everyone!” Draco explodes. “You can’t fix everything. Or be the centre of every fucking universe.”
“Yes,” Harry says, and he doesn’t let himself look anywhere else.
“No.” Draco is staring everywhere but Harry. “It’s fine. I’m glad. That you’re here.”
“Sorry,” Harry says, and realizes he’s whispering—that’s he’s been whispering the entire time, like he’s at a funeral and to speak loudly would disturb the grief.
“Draco hasn’t died. Not that we know of,” Hermione says, pushing past the memory. “So, it shouldn’t…it should be different. If the summoning spell does what we hope it will, you should be stepping into the other universe and bringing Draco back. Not dragging someone to a plane where they no longer belong, but returning someone to where they’re meant to be? It’s a subtle difference, but an important one, I think.”
Pansy’s eyes narrow to fuck-you thin. “You’re a prick when you’re jealous.”
“Well,” John says, lounging so far down in the chair that he’s practically horizontal. “I can give you space to talk. Get you a bed if you’re not safe at home.”
It’s a few inches across—that’s all—and Draco feels his balance lurch, feels himself pitch forward and then lurch back. “Oh,” he breathes, throwing his arms out like a bird to help steady the wobbly world.
is all Draco can think before he snaps his head around to the source of the noise.
As if magically summoned, Robertson bursts onto the scene, crashing through the front door, cradling a bag of produce in his arms. “Draco, my sinister shopkeep!”
Harry knows what will happen next. Hermione had repeated the process over and over until she’d worn a verbal footpath into his memory. “For safety,” she had said. “So you know what’s happening to you,” she had said.
“I’ll never see my mum again, but I have to see you—”
“God yes,” Ron says, and Pansy leans across the table and flicks him on the forehead.
Draco steps forward, grey dress robes folding around him like stardust woven into fabric. If he was re-entering wizarding society on the arm of Harry fucking Potter, he was going to look his best.
The wind clattered against the windows, and even though they were sealed up tight, Draco could feel the cold trying to claw its way in.
This was initially not a chapter; it's more of a deleted scene, if I'm being honest. It's barely 400 words, but I decided to include as a small stop-over before the next entry in this story. I promise you will not have to wait any extra time for another full chapter—that will be posted tomorrow <3
“You’ll have to dance, of course,” Pansy says, giving both Draco and Harry one of her most violent looks. “I spent fifteen minutes flirting with that bearded boy. You have no idea how risk averse he is! Insists that the clientele won’t like a girl band.” Given the glares being directed at the cash, Harry thinks Darwin might’ve been onto something. “You owe me.”
The moonlight is filtering through Malfoy’s fucking eyelashes and Harry can’t quite focus. “I don’t like Emma—” and there’s nothing for it, “or women, much, anymore.”
“Where did you even find that thing?” Pansy tries to sound haughty, but she gives the Boom Box a wide berth.  Neither she nor Draco know what kind of
“I thought you would kiss me the other night,” Harry says, leaning closer. There’s no space left for fear. The inches between them are crowded with other things, and so Harry barely thinks, doesn’t hesitate.
“I want—”
It could have been beautiful, once. Maybe it was.
* * *
“No.”
the curse had said.
Harry shakes his head, slow, like it’s filled with water and not brain matter or grief. “You’re in joggers,” Harry says, knows that this is stupid, but his mouth isn’t listening.
Harry tempers his frustration and nods.
And so he did.
It’s a futile exercise, really. Draco knows that he’s still the same person who had called Hermione Granger a Mudblood, the same person who had let the death eaters into Hogwarts. Rubbing shoulders with Muggles hadn’t erased that. His cells were still the same. His parts hadn’t been changed out. The ugliness was still there.
“I just—I wish I could change—” But Draco cuts him off.
“Tell Potter he can stop breaking things,” Ropson says as one of the Aurors looks up at the sound of their feet on the tile. “I’ve found him.”
“He was!” Harry shouts, determined to make this point. “We had a…feud?”
Narcissa is sitting beside him, her posture impeccable, her lips a thin line. She doesn’t say anything, but she doesn’t need to. She’s with him, alive, and that’s what matters. The last two Malfoys, to be tried together.
Seeing Malfoy had to have triggered some kind of autonomic response—it was his subconscious, that’s all. It was his subconscious that was obsessed with having or being by Malfoy—Harry didn’t care which it was, not when it was with
Usually, the spell would localize, find the relevant part of the body and offer a colourful depiction of the harms done and the damage that needed fixing. Black, though, only meant one thing.
“I wonder what brought him here,” Hermione says. “To counselling and helping Muggles. You should ask him.”
, stars and headlights. And the blister bursts.
Draco lets the words wash over him. He still doesn’t look up. The world will see him, they will look at all he’s done, and they will judge. There’s nothing for it now.
For a moment, Harry can’t believe he’s said it out loud—given voice to the things he’s not supposed and said them aloud in a world where there are consequences. Harry braces for the kind of tongue lashing he’d witnessed only moments stumbling into the office.
“You’re being borderline offensive. You know that?” Harry said, still blushing. Still vaguely upset.
That’s where he found her.
“I came here for support, Pans. You’re not being very supportive.”
, it insists.
, he thinks. “And you could just leave and I’d be stuck feeling like this. And you’d be gone again.”
“I suppose we could just bleed ourselves,” Pansy had said. “Hang on. I’ll get a knife from the kitchen.”
Robertson’s frown deepens. “I feel like you are merely placating me to get what you want.”
“Balcony,” Harry says, mind skittering over a memory of Draco’s hand on his chin, pulling his face close, and beathing hot smoke across his lips. He’d looked so calm, leaning into the night. “Let’s try the balcony.”
“No.”
“Indulge me then,” Draco said. “It’s not safe, mother.”
“Two houses both alike in dignity, In fair London, where we lay our scene.”
“Tonight,” Pansy says. “We’ll go tonight.”
Harry had gone for a run that night, for the first time since the war.
“That’s exactly what a serial killer would say.”
“Pansy,” Draco says, massaging her shoulders. “I know it’s been a difficult day. Here, let me just put on a nice CD.” Robertson recently taught Draco all of the technical terminology regarding the Boom Box. Draco was alarmed to discover that it wasn’t even the smallest bit explosive.
“It’s like the mould is being scrubbed by the cheery optimism of our flourishing relationship,” Draco had said, and while Harry knew he’d been joking, he can’t help but wonder if that’s a part of it. Privately, Harry suspects that the house somehow has access to the pH of his soul.
“It’s also a metaphor my dear boy. You can keep deflecting if you want to, but I think that whatever story is in your chest should be out.”
“You never know what you’ll get in the run of a shift,” one of the nurses says—
“Stop being so fucking stubborn!” Draco cracks, his composure shatters like porcelain. “I’m trying to be reasonable, to explain—”
Draco appreciates the directness of John’s approach, and almost tells him so.
It was a problem.
“Yes.”
“I’m not,” Narcissa says. “I’d already purchased you apartments, in case you should decide to reside closer to your workplace.”
Draco raises one eyebrow. “You didn’t give me much time to prepare for visitors,” Draco shuffles a bit closer. He’s wearing slippers, Harry realizes, and a jolt of fondness stabs like a headache behind his eyes.
“I don’t—” Harry’s gasping. “Why are you—”
“I’m scared,” Draco says. It’s a confession and it’s all he’s got.
“I can’t believe you’re smearing human blood on the floor,” says Pansy, crinkling her nose.
“This is wrong,” the stranger said, but his lips were still hungry, and so Draco thought it was fine. He couldn’t be messing this up too badly.
“What are you doing here?” Harry shouts back, because that’s what they’re doing now.
The question is genuine. Harry is struggling to remember which letter goes with which number, and the process of composing a message is painfully slow. Draco, however, answers like he has lightening in his digits.
“What were you doing?” Harry asks, his voice uneven.
“I don’t know what that means—”
Harry hadn’t understood how something could be too good, too much. A desire that makes Harry’s bones ache—as if flowers are about to burst from the marrow.
“Mr. Draco, sir,” Minty, one of their few remaining house elves, says, startling Draco out of the memory. “Miss Pansy is here.”
“Indeed,” Draco says and Harry throws all caution to the wind. His hands feel heavy, like they belong to someone else, but he reaches over and places one on Draco’s knee.
And just as she has in every other moment of crisis, when Draco has felt like the world is without gravity or friction, Pansy is a point of contact holding him steady. “Alright,” she says, blinking rapidly. “You irresponsible, ridiculous, impulsive—
In every other universe, Potter could love him. Did love him. Wanted him in a way that broached no argument, that took no questions. That refused to share. In this universe though.
“Do you have any idea?” Draco says, rolling against him. Friction has never felt so vital, so gloriously fucking perfect.
“Stop,” Ron wails, pulling his woolly hat down over his eyes. It was maroon and clashed violently with his hair. Draco told him so at every opportunity and Ron had taken this as a challenge to locate and purchase a legion of red hats.
“Are you making fun of me?” It feels like a revelation.
It’s been a long day and Draco finds he has very few fucks left to give—certainly none for rude Aur— “Police officer!” Draco snaps his fingers, and feels his balance lurch. “That’s what you idiots are called. Police officers.” Draco’s so pleased with his excellent memory that he barely notices the officer charging forwards.
Harry thought.
Draco tries to sit up. “Holy fucking shit on a stick, my head!” he says, flopping back into starchy sheets. “What the fuck!”
“Dr. Potter,” a nurse says, and Harry drifts back to awareness. It’s the same nurse—Megan? She has red flecks on her scrubs.
“I got tired of waiting. Really Potter. I only gave you the memories because I thought you were a man of action.”
“My mother says you saved the world,” a boy in the back who reminded Harry a great deal of Ernie MacMillan called loudly.
“Still. I imagine you know lots of lovely people. People who are only funny and kind, instead of funny and kind
“I won’t be your long weekend, Harry,” he said, quietly. Might have been a better note to start on. “I won’t be your winter fling. You should know that. There was a reason I invited you to a courting dance, and it has nothing to do with waking up to a wet patch on the bed and a thank you note scribbled on a piece of parchment.”
Draco frowned. Snake? Chamber? And what the actual fuck was Granger tossing stupid platitudes into her letters for? And why the fuck had she not suggested
The finality in his voice was unmistakable, and the two of them stood, Headmaster McGonagall brushing a finger over Malfoy’s arm and Madam Pomfrey checking his temperature once more. Harry brought a chair up to Malfoy’s bedside, reached for a book, and settled in to wait.
The next day found them at Number Twelve, with an assortment of house-repair spell books, a collection of tools from both worlds, and eyes sparkling with excitement.
“I know. It’s too strange without Harry.”
“Harry,” Draco muttered, his voice breaking on each syllable. “
The first hour was difficult and awkward but Draco still seemed determined, chopping vegetables by hand even when Molly said she was happy to set the knives to do it themselves. She saw quickly that he was determined to do something, and left him alone for a while, until Arthur came to talk to him.
“I’ll be downstairs if you need me,” he said, gently. “There’s fresh towels and clean clothes in the bathroom, if you want to take a bath. I have to open the shop again.”
Hermione flushed.
She didn’t sound angry. Just intrigued. Four sets of eyes turned to Harry, and he sighed again.
The anger presented itself. He acknowledged it, and let it go. He knew it had something important to tell him, but it wasn’t the time for him to listen to it. Not then.
“Well, what do you do in the evenings?” Hermione asked, helpfully. “In your free time?”
Whether he was lying, or genuinely couldn’t tell when he was keeping things from himself, Hermione didn’t know. But she smiled weakly at him, and they set about searching the house.
“Malfoy, no one cares what’s underneath.”
He landed, and pushed himself up onto his feet, at Twelve Grimmauld Place.
you’d be a brat in bed,” Harry said, laughing. And then he started to move. His hips snapped hard, making Draco grunt in a way that purebloods probably weren’t really supposed to, begging and snarling and coaxing Harry to go faster, harder, just more. More of this, of everything.
. It felt quite extraordinary to be the sole focus of all that intensity, and he couldn’t help but take Harry’s hips into his hands and pull him in close.
They disapparated with a crack, and Hermione was left with a pot of cooling tea.
“Black?”
“No one escapes anything, Harry,” Hermione said. “Least of all war. But that doesn’t mean that things are terrible. We learned, we grew, and we survived. Maybe we won’t ever be the sort of people who trip light-heartedly through life, but maybe — maybe
“Or the defeating a dark wizard thing,” Harry added.
Christmas was the usual affair. Too much food, too much drink, more and more small children running around every year. This year, they were all shaking their tiny wands at each other and shrieking in delight as the brightly coloured sparks flew around the room. Teddy’s hair was Weasley-red, and as the oldest child he was determinedly behaving like a good influence.
A hedge, a maze. Krum’s vacant eyes. And then the cup.
Harry relaxed slightly. “Yes,” he said. “Mr Black, then. I’m very pleased to make your acquaintance. Shall we?”
“Good,” Harry said. “I need to speak with you. Your rooms, or mine?”
“Glad it’s temporary,” she said, conjuring her own meal, still prepared by the elves but completely vegan. It looked good, actually. “I don’t like the House system. We abolishe it years ago at Beauxbatons.”
“I’m going to be a much better Auror than Harry Potter would ever have been,” he told his girlfriend. “How d’you like that? I’ll be Head Auror one day, see if I won’t.”
Blaise Zabini was a dedicated professional who managed to holiday with his famous girlfriend every year.
“Staff,” Kreacher corrected sternly. “Kreacher has a
Draco sneered, but didn’t speak, and after a moment or two longer he repositioned himself over Harry’s cock, and slowly eased him in.
That night, after checking that all of his things were in their rightful places in his living quarters behind the Potions classroom, Draco sat down to write a letter.
help with,” Mrs Malfoy said, stepping into the classroom. She walked swiftly down the aisle, her shoes clicking elegantly against the stones, and she opened the door to Harry’s room. “I see,” she said. “Well, I can work with this. Draco, darling, can you please make yourself very scarce, before Harry bursts a blood vessel?”
Draco pulled the sleeves of his cardigan — Harry’s cardigan — down over his hands. “Aren’t you going to ask me what I’m doing here, Potter? Haven’t you got a handful of nosy Gryffindors downstairs waiting for the gossip?”
He narrowed his eyes, then, though, looking around the room. Had he forgotten where he was? And then those same stormy grey eyes darkened in worry. He even tried to sit up, which was patently ridiculous.
“Versatile,” Draco quipped, pulling his shirt free of the waistband of his jeans. Harry did the same, laughing, letting his eyes drift over Draco’s lean figure, taking in a huff of breath when Draco reached up and for a moment there was a strip of skin peeking out and just begging to be kissed.
“I’d still like to do something nice for dinner. I’ll cook. Let’s go down to the larder, see what looks good. Perhaps we could pull up a couple of bottles of wine.”
“She would love that,” Draco said sincerely.
He brought Draco’s hand to his lips, and kissed his palm, pulled a finger between his lips.
“Harry —”
“Thank you, Minister,” he said, taking the gift, and he was gone, and Hermione was left with guilt and shame and wishing that Blaise could come and hold her while she cried the other half of her tears.
He thought about Hermione a lot.
“Of course, Neville,” Draco said, cordially. “Just don’t forget to RSVP.” And then he stood up, and left. With a plate of fruit left to eat — and Draco loved fruit, Harry had found himself mildly amused by it, the sweet cravings Draco had even when it wasn’t truly dessert.
“Alright. If you’ll call me Harry.”
“She was my best friend, Minister. Hermione,” he corrected, taking a seat. He was as graceful as he had ever been. Very attractive, really, now that he wasn’t a complete git. “Greg didn’t cope too well with… well.” Hermione nodded. The Fiendfyre. She knew. Vincent Crabbe screaming as he disappeared into the flames that Gregory Goyle had created. “It’s one of the reasons I got interested in… all of this,” he said, gesturing elegantly around the room. “He didn’t use magic for years, but he had a Squib uncle who had a distillery in Galway. They stayed there for years, and she and Greg learned the trade. They’re back in Scotland now, of course.”
“Doesn’t have to be like that, mate,” Ron promised, his dark eyes wide. “It’s strategy, you see. Planning. Knowing your opponent, like in chess. And then you don’t have to take those risks.”
Harry closed his eyes as Madam Shacklebolt kissed his forehead.
The alarmed elf only nodded once, and then disappeared again.
“Well, that
“Don’t go easy,” Draco said, when he’d licked a stripe up Harry’s cock, and gently sucked at the head. “I like a good face-fucking. I’ll pinch you if it’s too much.”
Draco snorted. “Just Mother, then. I’m fucked, Potter. I’m dead either way. There’s nowhere he can’t find me.”
“I think it’s fair to say that we are friends, at this point, and colleagues. Neither of us has committed bodily harm against the other, unless you count a jelly-legs jinx. We’ve even progressed to first names. Happy?”
There was so much more that needed to be said, but Harry looked as if he might be balancing on the very edge of something, and Hermione could only nod.
Harry felt a touch of unease as he climbed reluctantly out of bed. He pulled on a pair of old sweatpants that he knew Draco hated (“Muggle rags”) but that he also knew made Draco stare at his arse, and he was going to get a shag after breakfast if he had to strip naked and wiggle said arse in Draco’s face.
They were silent for a long time.
Harry raised an eyebrow.
Strange, though, how he was suddenly hungry for things that might make him smile like that. His mood lasted days, he was happier in classes, stopped worrying so much about getting it right and started running his lessons a little looser. The children laughed, he laughed, and his third year class, some of whom were utterly terrified of Boggarts, had a wonderful time turning one into things that made them roll about in helpless laughter. He was having fun. He
“Yes, thank you. I’ll be heading back to Hogwarts in two days so that Professor Bennett can spend some time with her family in Nice, but in the meantime, it’s been quite pleasant.” He was very formal, but this house always seemed to demand it.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t know you were busy.”
. I wish I’d known her then. Might have bollocksed things up a little less.” He sighed.
“Hmm?”
“The Castle can accommodate it. Space is only space, Harry,” she said, taking her hand back and resting it on his shoulder. Narcissa was several inches taller than Harry even without her insistence on wearing the tallest heels that money could buy. There was something almost maternal in the gesture. “You could entertain guests. Adopt a family of kneazles — although I wouldn’t recommend that. They push things off tables, and those crystal tumblers are very old, fine Waterford crystal.” She seemed to sense Harry’s objection to owning anything that nice, and quickly moved on. “I would have liked for the three of us to have a meal together this evening but I am, unfortunately, otherwise occupied. A charity event.”
lost. But I found you. And I can take you home, if you’ll just let me.”
“I do know that. But no. I want to read them. I’m impressed, actually.” He gave Hermione a broad smile. “Julian Flint appears to have blossomed, somehow. I’m impressed with this work. It must have taken him weeks to sort through that many procurement ledgers.”
“I’ll be in touch when things are quieter,” he said, all business. “If not with you, I’ll call Aditi. For now, I need to close the wards on my Floo. You understand.”
The warmer months meant that the bars were full: beer gardens stayed open later, students were on break from their studies, and Harry had made a masterful study of what sort of clothing was most likely to snag the attention of the tortured poetic type he liked so much. He was wearing his hair quite long, these days, and quite enjoying the way it curled at the ends. Slouchy-looking jeans and Doc Marten boots, ragged-looking band t-shirts (and no, he wasn’t a complete tosser; he did know the music, and quite liked it, actually).
. People said it couldn’t be taught, but it had taken time for Draco to trust it. A different sort of magic. Harmonising with another person’s thoughts, figuring out the best way to reach them. And the fact that this was Harry Potter, whom Draco had hated and adored all through school — through a war that he didn’t think either one of them would ever recover from — didn’t change it. Calling him Potter, using the old names he’d used for his friends, it was all old, ugly habits designed to keep distance between them.
And Harry was almost too beautiful to look at, like that.
“Er,” he said.
But he didn’t bother; he was about done repeatedly stabbing himself in the heart. Draco was a terrible glutton for punishment, these days, but he did have his limits.
Harry was still standing in the doorway, unsure of whether he should invite himself in.
“Then prove it,” he said.
Silence. He lay back against the pillow and closed his eyes.
Tell him how important it was that he come home.
“Hold your arms out,” Harry replied, refusing to rise to the bait. “They do look better. Just lay them comfortably and I’ll give them another pass. You should be right as rain in the morning. If you can avoid grumbling, and relax.”
Harry smiled awkwardly. “Er. Yes,” he said. “Yes, of course. I’ll Owl Hermione in the morning.”
His family arrived, and they transfigured his bed into a stone coffin to be placed in the Ollivander crypt. They sat around it, sharing stories, laughing, crying sometimes, and they never asked Harry to leave; they welcomed Ron and Hermione, as well, who sat on either side of Harry and comforted him, though he wasn’t sure he needed it.
“Is this outfit of yours all in one piece?” Harry growled back. “Or is it finished with a sticking charm of some sort? There’s
Harry wanted an owl. It had been twenty years since Hedwig had died, and if there was a part of him that had never wanted to love another creature so much, that part of him was gone, now. He wanted an owl who would close their eyes when he scratched his fingernails through the feathers at their neck, and hoot softly and nip affectionately at his fingers. Maybe he’d get a cat, as well. Or a Kneazle. They were so smart.
He had never been so glad to leave Grimmauld Place in his life.
And then being an Auror, and…
Potter fumbled in the pocket of his robe. His robe, at least, Draco was pleased to note, was new and well-cut, well-sewn, and properly pressed. He could have made an effort to look a little less bleak, though. “I need some potion ingredients,” he said, but he didn’t hand over the parchment. Draco held his hand out for it, waiting.
“From the time you were eleven years old, it was
“Well first of all, I don’t think that’s regulation length,” Ron said, as he and Hermione frowned at it. Hermione picked it up, and gave a little wave. Her face startled with recognition.
Something tight in his hair, pulling his neck back, forcing his chin up. He’s pulling him closer and Harry goes, he doesn’t mind because then there’s a tongue licking a line up his neck, teeth sharp against his flesh, a mouth at his ear.
“Yeah. That’s me. Harry the resident,” and he knows he sounds like an idiot, but he’s so delighted to be a stranger.
she adds.
Ron missed the grimace that curdled on Harry’s face. Sometimes, Harry wished that he’d been able to come back as someone else and leave Harry Potter behind at Kings Cross. Sometimes, he wished he hadn’t come back at all.
“Me too.” Pansy’s head falls onto Draco’s shoulder and he realizes that this is what he has to lose. “Me too.”
“But I’m just—” Harry had floundered and Draco waited, barely afloat himself as he rode this wave of fate and the lives that could have been.
cleaved Draco in two. There is one version of him, the one that accepts Ropson’s side-along, that moves through the halls of St. Mungo’s. This version is calm, polite, is a shell encasing the shock. Draco watches himself, moving through the world as if underwater.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco had said, pushing an unsteady Pansy through the front door. “I know she may appear conventionally attractive. But trust me. This one is more trouble than she’s worth,” and Pansy had cackled into the starlight and they’d stumbled home, arm in shaky arm.
“Don’t.”
“So hot,” the stranger slurred against Malfoy’s lips.
“I’ve been trying,” Harry growls, but stands aside.
Harry looked down at the pieces of the magazine cover on his floor. Malfoy stared back, sharp grey eyes narrowed at the photographer, blonde hair falling into his face. “This can’t happen, ‘Mione.”
, he wonders absently. The men in red part, and Ropson is moving through the door into a room that contains something Draco knows he will not be able bear.
“I just—”
Draco opens his mouth to protest, but Robertson plows onward. The story will not be stopped.
“Yes,” Hermione says, crowding around him. “You see, the curse was actually fairly straightforward once we were able to parse the intent of the spell from the original Latin. I honestly don’t know why you didn’t reach out earlier,” Hermione says, directing the last line at Pansy. “It would have saved everyone a great deal of trouble.”
It’s almost immediate. The sharp convulsions settle. The heart rate monitor drifts back into a normal range.
Draco’s breath is hot and Harry can hear it, can feel the grip in his hair tighten. Pinning him, his body pulled against the hard planes of another man’s chest.
Narcissa sets the tea down and slips several glossy photographs from her robes.
“I don’t know what I did.” Harry flops onto the dirty tile. A chair seems like too much of an effort right now, and it hurts to sit. Harry hates that it hurts to sit; it makes him feel used. Ashamed.
“He said this was MDMA.” Draco looks down at the colourful circles. “Said it would cheer me up.”
getting brighter and brighter as his panic thrashed and wobbled—dying star on the end of his wand tip.
Draco knows he should tell her about the spell. Deep in his guts, at the centre of him where his honestly lives, he knows he should tell her. But as he breathes in the smell of her—of lavender and hairspray—he can’t bring himself to do it. For just a little while, the weight of her head and the weight of his future seem to balance and everything feels calm.
White-blond hair was a paintbrush dipped in deep red, flecks of blood scattered across the stone floor. “Oh god.” Harry was by her side, on his knees next to Narcissa Malfoy’s body “No.”
For a moment, Harry hesitates. It all feels so foreign, like a virus has snuck into the normal equilibrium of his life and infected all of his healthy cells. “Hermione, I’ve fucked up,” he says, vision bleary from exhaustion, attention still wandering through other worlds. “You were right. Draco actually
“You’re being ridiculous—” Hermione tries to divert Ron’s attention, and Harry appreciates it, but he’s already opening his mouth.
Another whoop, another stern glare, but Harry feels lighter. As if the catastrophe of the last few hours can be undone. “But I fucked it. Or he did. I dunno.”
“You’re welcome.”
for anyone who wanted the excruciating details of his inadequacy. It had been years since the Yule ball, and yet here he was, doing a twisted sort of dance with Draco Malfoy.
Five years. Malfoy abandoned the magical world for five years. Harry remembers the look on his face, day in St. Mungo’s; sadness bed from his pores when he said, “I’m leaving, Potter, and I’m never coming back.”
, and Harry can’t believe it. Not when Draco rolls his hips against his, and he goes from aching to impossibly hard. Not when he leans in, blond hair falling into his eyes, and Harry brushes it away. With two fingers. Like it’s nothing. Not when Draco holds him, just holds him still and beneath him, and pulls Harry’s bottom lip between his teeth.
“Excuse us,” Hermione says, tugging a curious Ron away from an intense Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Behind them, someone shouts, “Perfect 20! How do you like them apples, Kurt!!” The table roars in response. Somewhere, a pint crashes the floor.
Harry’s made it his personal mission to remember every one of his co-worker’s names.
“Come here,” Draco says.
“No,” Harry stumbles. “Never tried.” His back presses tight against the wrought iron curling around them.
“Such as?” Draco sounds unconvinced.
“What?” Harry sits up, grimaces a little with the ache of it, and looks around.
Draco moves away from the noise, heads straight for the kitchen, and seizes a large knife from the block. Voldemort lived in his home, his aunt Bella crept into his careless thoughts, and Draco had seen his fair share of horror movies. He will not walking towards an unknown entity unarmed.
Harry nods at the floor.
“Stop stalling,” Pansy says, fingernails demanding to be heard. “What did you do?”
His chest dissolves, fragments of himself splayed through a prism of infinite variations. It’s the squeeze of apparition, but inverted, pushing every little bit of him apart, until Harry is reduced to the pieces that are indivisible. Everything is undone and he’s mixing with the stars.
Harry steps again. They’re close now, so close that Harry is nearly standing on his shoes. Draco remembers Potter’s hand on his elbow in front of the Winzengamot and then the ghost of his lips on a balcony. “I’m not very good at this,” Harry says and Draco’s close enough to taste the words.
Harry could, though. As the arrows they’d flung at one another rattle around inside his head, it’s this that scares him more than anything else.
“Mental health,” Draco says, swirling the unfamiliar words around in his mouth. “Is that why you’re here?”
Draco thinks, and he feels all of his restraint crumble to nothing. He lets himself stare, lets all of his feelings pour out into the unflinching attention of Harry Potter.
It’s a cell phone. “What the—?”
, revels in the feeling of hands on him and the smell of people who want him. Lights pounds his eyes but, fuck, everything feels so good. The tablets had been strange and it had all seemed like madness at first, but now—
Old magic, the kind that only exists in Pure Blood libraries and the minds of men like Voldemort and Dumbledore.
, is all Draco had thought. He’d been viewing Potter in different angles of profile. Harry’s fulll face focused entirely on him now, so intent, so close—
“I knew you had a secret,” she whispers. “Tell me everything.”
Draco opens his swollen eyes in time to see anger flash across Granger’s features. Whoever is arguing with her should run while they still can—even if she weren’t one of the most powerful witches of her generation, Draco has personal experience with her right hook.
“He was going on about something called horsepower?” Draco looks up at Pansy, eyes beseeching her sympathy. “I think I drew fairly logical conclusion.”
“Done,” Draco says, cinching the knot to Harry’s throat, gently pressing the starched shirt collar flat.
“You can’t eat books, Harry,” Ron says, frothing a bit.
Because death was a direct flight, wasn’t it? A one-way ticket. Harry should not have come back. His body was whole. It worked in all the ways bodies were supposed to. But on the inside…
“Thanks.” The world feels like a top that just won’t stop spinning. “How much has she told you?” Harry asks, pressing his palms into his eyelids and squeezing out a groan.
Potter looks at him.
“This was a terrible idea,” Harry said, but Hermione had dismissed his concerns, leaving him alone with the feline from hell.
And Harry can’t lose this. Not again. Not ever again. He’s holding on to Draco, hands shaking as they wrap around Draco’s biceps, because if he lets go he might lose this.
Harry nods, breathes deeply as he lights a match and presses it to the first bundle, laying it gently in the centre of their messy rendition of a summoning charm so ancient that there’s no trace of wand work. The smoke billows across his cheeks.
“Right.” Draco extends his arm and Narcissa—finally revealing how nervous she must be—takes it. “Let’s go.”
This time, the silence hangs like a dead man.
“Can you tell me if he called in? If he’s okay?” Harry asks, desperate.
Harry saw a flash of white blond and felt his pulse ratchet back up. Malfoy, tangled in an urgent knot of limbs and lust with a stranger, someone Harry didn’t know but who Malfoy seemed to. Intimately.
“I don’t understand why you named her Bella,” Hermione had said, as the traitorous creature lavished her in love that she never showed
It’s late, and some detached part of Harry can hear the traffic humming its approval—the part that remembers to breathe.
Bella eats and Harry runs his fingers up her spine. “I don’t know why I bother with you,” he mutters, letting his hands drift through long silky fur as he pours himself some of yesterday’s coffee. “You’re the worst.” Bella purrs and Harry relaxes under the soft vibrations. “The absolute worst.”
He’d found the spell—a messy ancient thing—in his great great uncle Cassius’s collection, scrawled in the margins. It was peak idiocy, casting a handwritten spell. Draco knew it, but then he’d never been very good when left on his own. Wallowing had soured to recklessness and Draco had hoped doing
“You…you what?” Draco doesn’t understand.
“The peacocks?”
His back pocket vibrates, and he feels a pang of irritation. It’s an undignified interruption, all things considered. Wobbling violently, Draco drags his phone out.
The admission is their first foray into vulnerability and Harry treats it as an invitation.
“Are you out of your mind?”
“I don’t—” Harry’s breaths start to speed up, start to come shallow and rushed. There are so many pieces of a man that Harry’s only just started to know.
“You can’t just walk into my life and stomp all over everything. You can’t just show up at my trial. You can’t…” Draco feels blood in his ears.
“I hardly think that’s fair—” Ropson starts to say, but Harry silences him with a hand.
“I thought…” but Harry doesn’t know what he thought.
“You see children?” Harry’s not sure what he means by the question, but Draco bristles.
Had it not been for his inevitable one-way trip to Azkaban, Draco knows he would never have cast the spell. He rubs at his arms, searching for some sign that it's worked—it's only been a few minutes, but he craves confirmation.
“Can’t I go instead?”
But then…
His embarrassment is incalculable. Draco has absolutely nothing to say. No explanation. So he just stands there. Staring at her. Daring her to laugh.
“Come sit down,” Hermione says from her spot on the floor. “And tell us what you know.”
Harry shivers. “Yeah?”
“I’m not a serial killer!” Harry waved his hands that were supposed to be on the wheel.
For a moment, the panic stands still. Harry jerks his head up, winded and dizzy and confused, and there’s Pansy Parkinson right there in front of him. She’s standing in the doorway, a bag of groceries on the floor next to her, a stray orange rolling away.
Robertson snorts, and it’s affectionate somehow. “It always comes back to matters of the heart.”
Harry lets himself be led. Out of the airy living room and into a bathroom down the hall. The mirror is enormous and Harry tries not to look. He knows what he’ll see there—sadness doesn’t look good on him, makes a scarecrow of his features. “Going to get you something clean,” Draco says, pressing a towel into Harry’s hands. “I’ll be in the living room when you’re done.”
, Draco thinks. There is someone in the sitting room.
“You’re terrible at being bad, you know that?” Pansy says.
The sky is grey, so late it’s early and Harry’s sore and drunk on gratification he finally got to have. The air feels thick with what they’ve done. “I dreamt about you too. In a way,” Draco says. “I’ve never stopped.”
Eventually, one of the daytime counsellors calls security.
“Yes well, I think he could use a lesson in self-preservation.”
And it had worked.
“I knew it’d be like this. I knew—”
Harry had thought, helplessly trying to give his obsession some plausible deniability.
but Harry’s not sixteen anymore and he knows better.
“What is that supposed to mean? And why the fuck do you keep calling me Potter?”
“You don’t deserve to—”
Draco had looked so tired. So mangled by sadness. “
One of Draco’s lovely plants falls from the windowsill. It’s upside-down on the ground. Happy leaves blink up at him, soil scattering across the floor.
“No! I’ll take care of it. Promise,” he says, the red creeping down his neck.
All the while, the sound goes on and on. The scream of the dead rasps quiet, bouncing off the industrial tile.
“Pull over!” Draco shouted and Potter had turned to face him.
The platform is cast in a soft light, the seats and the tile white. “Kings Cross,” he says. “Again.”
“The perils of the Chosen One. Reduced to hand cramps and some semblance of legibility. However will you survive?” Five years ago, Harry would’ve assumed Malfoy’d meant those words to wound.
“You can’t die from a fever,” mum whispers and her daughter’s lips twitch and twitch.
“Rock bottom hits you hard,” John continues.
“How long!” The look is back. That look that takes Hermione’s features and transfigures them into a shape that will change the world. “How long has this been going on?”
Robertson spoke with his hands and had knocked over several unruly stacks of paperbacks as he spoke. “I only ask two things.” He’d looked down his wide nose at Draco. “First, and most importantly, do not steal my meatball subs.”
Harry wants to hit something. “I don’t even know what that is!”
But Malfoy’s voice catches him before he can make it more than a few steps. “Potter?”
he thinks, relishing in the bodies that hurry to and fro.
The bell jingles behind an elderly man, who’s tottering out of the shop underneath a pile of books. Draco is becoming quite proficient at this whole
A man in red robes, deep a crimson in the low light, stands with his back to Draco.
“Dating will help!” Pansy had insisted. “You can’t keep pining over someone who doesn’t exist.”
“What’s your face doing?” Pansy asks from her spot on the rug. A collection of nail varnish spills around her, and she sits atop the colorful bottles like a dragon guarding her treasure. “Are you worrying about the curse?”
“Home,” he mumbles, and wakes up in a new universe, legs tangled in sheets that feel familiar. The sterile smell of starched linens and healing salve tugs at his memories. He’s in the hospital wing, Draco realizes.
“Why aren’t you dressed?”
, Draco thinks idly.
Harry feels someone take his hand. The touch is soft, gentle as fingers slip between his.
A touch that hovered just close enough make his hairs stand on end, but not enough that it had felt like anything had changed.
“Right.”
But what if there had been? What would the world have looked like if Potter had been less angry and Draco had been less scared?
to stay calm, because I need to make a plan and I can’t make a plan when I’m having a panic.” Draco peers up across the table, pleading. “I need someone to help me make a plan.”
“Fuck!”
For a moment, Draco and Narcissa stand and stare. Gringotts shines white on the horizon. It feels so far.
“Uh…I’m here with Malfoy’s wand?” Harry said to the air in front of the gate, kicking at the gravel with his trainers.
“You were dreaming about domestic bliss with the fucking ferret,” Ron says, but there’s no anger in it. Harry, who hadn’t expected his friends to take this so well, feels the urge to overcompensate.
Harry’s world erupts into colour—a flash of vibrancy in the pan. Because Draco Malfoy is five feet away from him and the memories of their shared history burst through his carefully constructed compartmentalization.
It’s been three days since his trial. Seventy-two hours of angry post and headlines that pull no punches. The press, it seems, is keen to tell Draco exactly how they feel.
“Help?” Draco’s shrill and reeling. “How! How does forcing me to see her like that, to have to choose to end—No. You don’t get to pretend this wasn’t your fault.”
“Well, I’ll go with you.”
was a bookshop he’d stumbled into while questing for electronics. He’d been smitten from the very first.
“He’s not even singing! He’s…” Pansy struggles to find the words. “He’s talking with style!”
Harry dragged his eyes away from Malfoy. “Yeah?”
“Harry, you’re yelling—”
“In what capacity?” the man asks.
Apologies hang in the air. They both know that they’re there. Neither Harry nor Draco pay them any mind.
,” Draco says and Pansy shreds him with a glare.
“I’m the pinnacle of class and decorum,” Draco says, and snaps his wine from Harry’s loose fingers. “I am the reference point against which all grace should be judged.”
“Explain, but with details,” Pansy says, her bloodshot eyes trained on his face.
Malfoy is in the department again, arranging an appointment with the on-call psychiatrist. It’s for a patient—Lucy Freedman, Harry remembers—who had walked into the waiting room in a thong and a sports bra and nothing else.
Draco flops onto his mattress.
The outline of a mental To Do list starts to take shape as Harry wriggles into his scrub pants.
Harry tries to hold on to the concept of seeing and being seen, but it’s no use. The world unravels, the multiverse twisting like a tornado made of tapestry, and it takes Harry with it. Starlight streams, rather than sparkles. Liquid ribbons twist.
he fucking realizes.
Draco doesn’t answer.
“You look—”
“What a good boy you are,” Pansy says, and Darwin turns and runs back to the bar.
Hermione’s voice surges over the murmur.
The night air hits Harry’s cheeks and chases away the tension. He can breathe. Malfoy releases Harry’s fingers and eases into a damp lawn chair. Deft fingers pry the cork of the wine bottle free.
Someone pressed against his back, and shudders cascaded through Harry’s body.
“I’ll report back.” Harry knows he will, because a little has never been enough—not with Draco.
Flo glares at him and somehow manages to make it both scathing and pitying. “Son, just wait until tomorrow. Draco’s never out sick. He’ll be in tomorrow.”
The snow was light and lazy on his cheeks. Harry could see the spires of the manor poking up in the distance—declarations of power and wealth that had been standing for hundreds of years. The trees dipped their heads as Malfoy Manor bent the natural world to its will.
“I know it’s not hanging out. I know I shouldn’t have—”
“Shhh,” Draco says, pressing a tired finger to Harry’s lips. “Lecture me later.”
There was nothing more dangerous, Harry thought, than Hermione when she decided she was going to figure something out. Her brain could bend the world.
Harry waves a hand, as if this detail merits little notice. “He said I should woo you in multiple languages, but I can’t. I came after you and I’m still not sure if I’ll be…” Harry closes his eyes, and in spite of the ragged blue jeans and the plain t-shirt, Draco sees the sun glancing off of his skin and is sure that nothing has even been so beautiful. “I’m not sure if I’ll be enough.”
Ropson answers the question with a pitying look and nothing more. There are men in red and lime green robes standing outside one of the rooms up ahead and Draco realizes that this is their destination. The world comes to him through a hospital filter—itchy eyes and exhaustion, manic movements and sterility.
Harry forces his eyes open, tiredness gritty under the lids. Draco is hovering on the very edge of the room, a pair of joggers hanging low on his hips. Tight arms cross his chest, fingers gripping elbows, white and nervous.
Harry bends his knees, trying to force some stretch into the fabric. He should never have let Malfoy transfigure his scrubs—should’ve known something like this would happen. “I can feel the denim on my skin.”
That night, he dreams Draco. Of a light at the top of the stairs, a strange tattoo, and striped pyjamas.
Harry’s hands haven’t moved from his shoulders. Draco felt contained, bracketed in the safety of the Chosen One. Different universe. Same boy. Same weighty certainty that, when Potter had you in his sights, everything would be alright. “You’re not a villain.”
Draco cocks his head to the side, looks the man up and down. Bulging biceps flex and angry eyes narrow.
“Look, are you going to let me in?”
An ugly laugh rushes out of him, the edges made of razor blades. It hurts, to laugh right now. “Just stop, Malfoy. You realized it was a mistake. You freaked out. You panicked. Whatever.” It wasn’t
, Harry remembers. The site of a meteor strike, a thousand years ago and Draco had wanted to see it. Harry, unable to deny him anything, had agreed without question.
Until it isn’t.
They were supposed to live.
“Fuck a witch’s tit!” Draco yelped as the cold air bleached his skin. Draco needed space from that stupid truck. He could see it now, after tumbling out into the wild. It was bulky and red and looked as if it was carved out of a block of metal. The indicator was still blinking.
“I take it that’s a no.”
Draco apparates to St. Mungo's and comes face to face with a grief so incalculably vast that he wants to skip this universe, thank you very much. Perhaps he can slip onto another track, start anew in a world where his mother isn't dead and Harry Potter doesn't look at him like
Grimmauld place
Pansy glares at the boom box, as if it’s interrupting them on purpose. “Seriously Draco. Is this some kind of punishment?”
“But—“
“She’s gone,” Draco yells—he knows he’s yelling, but he can’t stop. Potter pulls him close, holds his arms still and lets Draco shudder into his chest.
he thought, and the trial flickered across his memory.
“I like you,” Harry hears himself say, his America voice low and afraid. “Have for a long time. So long.”
The words have attached to Draco like a brand.
Draco searches for his courage, finds it in the tiny trembling of Harry’s shoulders.
“They’ve got fridges of it just lying around!” Ron had yelped when Harry had explained that it wouldn’t be that difficult.
“Just…” Harry can’t take it. Draco’d had his fun. This encore hurts too much. “Get out.”
The walls were closing in, everything was loud and the bodies that should’ve been dancing were dying. Curses and cold sweat and Harry had to get out.
. Draco is sure that none of these pale, middle aged Muggles have ever stepped foot in a real dungeon or seen any kind of magic, gathering or otherwise.
“Harry,” Draco says, halting. Reluctant. “You’ve been through something. I don’t want to—”
“Start with the sage, and then the lavender next, and then—” her voice cracks. “Then we’ll be ready.”
Nothing
Harry opens his mouth to correct him, but the way that Draco looks just then, Harry swears that he could see through him if he angled his head just the right way. As if Draco is more reflection than man.
Harry knocks into the end table and the force of his hip sends a decorative wooden box crashing down. It falls face first onto the floor, intricate wooden lines untangling, and Harry’s so upset he barely notices the secrets falling out. Little vials made of glass spill across the hardwood, rolling away in all directions.
“You want it, don’t you?”
It had never occurred to him that they would come for mother.
“Yes.”
Draco knows this face. Its inches are as familiar as lines on a map. He knows the wrinkles and the shade of his lips after he’s been kissed by tender violence. He knows the muscles under that skin and the spectrum of green alive in the threads of those irises. The addition and subtraction of a quirked lip or a stern line can add up to love. In every universe except for his own, on the face of every version of Harry Potter but the one who matters. Except—
Harry'd wanted to eat him, had done so later that night, looking up from his knees as Draco thighs shook. Harry nosed Draco’s skin, pressed his wet mouth in the hollow of Draco’s hips.
, Harry thinks she says, but these words are softer than the rest and not meant for him.
Her paw touches the glass. Pushes it a centimeter. The tumbler wobbles.
It feels wrong, those words coming out of Malfoy’s posh mouth. Harry is transfixed.
“Shit,” John agrees.
“Yes,” Draco says, as if he can’t believe it. “Whatever you want. Anything,” he says and then pushes into Harry. It’s slow and hot and Harry’s head falls back into the pillow. He lets out a breath he’s been holding his whole life.
A steaming cup floated gently into his hand. Earl Grey, with a slice of lemon. He hadn’t wanted to ask for that, but he was glad the lemon was there. He took a sip. “Thank you, this is perfect.”
This kiss felt like that.
“Language, Draco.”
“But sometimes, it’s necessary!” Ron said, indignantly.
Hermione startled, and grabbed Harry’s hand, pressing it to her stomach again, the way she had before.
“Kreacher, I need to talk to you about something,” she said. “Perhaps we could
Fifteen minutes later Harry was devouring his breakfast; it was absolutely delicious, and also, he had no idea whatsoever why it was called son-in-law eggs, and had decided he didn’t care. It was salty, and spicy, and seemed to warm him from the inside out.
. “Thank you for your help. The room looks very.”
Hope came. And Harry didn’t care, anymore, for equanimity; he let hope settle in his heart like an ember. Blaise was right. It was time.
“Yes, actually,” Harry said. “I’d like this clasp. And I need some advice, while you have a moment.”
“No,” Draco replied, his lip curling viciously. “If you wake up — we can
“It’s not, though. It’s just… fundamental,” Draco said, sadly. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“It will be okay,” he said, reaching out to brush his fingers over Draco’s wrist. To his surprise Draco took his hand, and nodded, stepping into the Floo with Harry as Harry called out “The Burrow.”
“Plan for what?” Harry asked, annoyed. He
“Harry,” Draco said, soothing. Harry looked up at him, surprised.
“Your rooms?”
He stayed by Harry’s side until the sounds of life in the house disappeared. The boy was coaxed to bed, despite wanting to watch the television for ‘five more minutes’, over and over again. The man had to be drinking. His voice got more slurred as the evening went on and the woman eventually coaxed him up the stairs as well.
“No, I don’t think it can. Eight sharp,” Draco said, leaving his eyes closed. “Shoo.”
But Veritaserum hummed in his head and he couldn’t.
Hermione nodded. Dumbstruck. “Two months. Why Pansy?”
“Forever, ideally. I don’t want to think about it. I’m so embarrassed. He never should have known any of it. It was… it was private, and I know that sounds ridiculous under the circumstances, but it was. Private. Just somewhere I went when I didn’t want to be Harry Potter anymore. He never treated me like anything but the skinny speccy git from the train that morning at the beginning of first year. Even when we started to get along a little better, after… I hate seeing that obligation in his eyes, Hermione. I have to get home.”
that Draco was grateful for the very forgiving robes, and the way they billowed.
“I know it’s late,
“Ever the elocutionist.”
Strangely, Harry wasn’t sure he could argue with that. He couldn’t figure out why, but there was something about it that sounded true.
When the night fell, and the rain started up again, Harry sighed, and locked the door, drew the curtains against the shop windows. He crept up the stairs with a bundle of boxed wands under his arm, and paused on the landing. He knocked gently on the door.
“Oh,” Harry said, almost having forgotten. “I also wanted to show you something.” He drew the tiny, twisted wand from his pocket and passed it over. “Very crude, of course, I…”
Draco had taken Harry’s hand, and placed it on his shoulder. He had placed his own hand on Harry’s hip, before their free hands found each other. “You haven’t danced since the fucking
McGonagall sighed. “There are hundreds of jobs in the magical world, and hundreds of things you haven’t yet had the chance to try. Perhaps you have an affinity for art. Or healing.”
“Merlin,” Harry said, and though the happy smile had dropped from his face, his wonder was equally satisfying. Draco perched on the arm of a chair with a smug expression and his arms crossed over his chest.
Draco sighed.
“Not even in school?” Topher took a sip, and laughed. “Oh, you don’t have to tell me. It doesn’t make any difference to the treatment. I’m curious, that’s all. Not like I can share anything with the press, thanks to your ex-girlfriend’s magical blood quill.”
Desire came, and hope. They needed to come back another time.
him, Draco. Harry was my best friend and we survived the war together, and I left him all alone. We didn’t say a word to each other for almost two years, and I told myself it was because we were both so busy. He was always in the papers. Winning an award. Going to a party with some famous Witch on his arm. Making speeches and donations and then… winning another fucking award, and sometimes I resented that Ron and I — we were just the
“Some of my students approached me this morning,” he said. “About a Duelling Club. They want to start one again.”
But not for him. It still wanted to get to Malfoy.
Ron thought about how many times Harry had tried to talk about Draco Malfoy when he just wanted to play Quidditch or talk about girls or, Godric forgive him, even do his homework. And in sixth year, when Harry had stalked Malfoy like an obsessed fan. But he’d hated Malfoy. And what did Ron know?
“Give who a break?” Harry replied, transparently, and he left the breakfast table before he could see an expression on Neville’s face that he would have to interpret. “Oh, Neville. We’re getting along well, alright? Duelling Club, and… we’re using first names, and — and we went flying together,” Harry said, and wished he hadn’t let himself think about it. Or that moment on the grounds afterwards where he’d wanted to take Draco in his arms and snog him stupid. And tell him he was a disaster, and that Draco shouldn’t ever, ever look at him with his eyes sparkling in that way again, lest he be terribly disappointed with the outcome.
“Who won, Harry?”
“Lovely,” Neville said, stirring the blackberries through. Draco pushed his own plate away, heading for the dungeons.
“Yeah, on a few things.”
“Yes. But not at the expense of everything else. We’re not heartless. Harry’s my friend. Auror or not, he’s my friend.” Blaise’s expression was severe and serious and Draco believed him.
There was a scuffle in the hallway, and Hermione looked up. Really, she didn’t have time for nonsense today; she had barely slept, and poorly at that, and she had a pile of work to do that was taller than her head. She stormed across her office and opened the door, already shouting for everyone please calm the fuck down and get on with the day.
Hermione stepped into the room, and took a seat on the armchair by the small desk.
“As a child.”
a little more.”
Emrys shrugged. “Well. Except that it’s not true.”
“Nah, he’s a show pony. Taking all the fancy risks, stepping in to save the day last minute — my brother went to school with him, and I heard he was a right wanker. Always showing off one way or another.”
Draco blanched, and tore his eyes from the water and its unrest. He stared at the knots in the wood instead, and he thought. Harry lived in England; Draco lived in Italy. They had their lives. Their jobs. Draco needed to keep unlocking the secrets of the mind and Harry needed to keep England safe, the wanker. They could never work.
“I’m sure all of those Italian families will be happy knowing their little ones aren’t all the way in France,” Luna said. “Just as I’m very happy for you and Draco, Harry. He’s very pretty, and these days his aura is much less prickly. Not prickly at all, really. I don’t think he could have helped people that way.”
Draco wasn’t surprised when he opened his eyes to find himself with Harry looking at him intently. There was a challenge, there; he’d made rather a mess of things several times in a row, and getting it right last time had earned him some good grace, but not much.
Harry laughed, and Luna smiled benevolently at him. “You have a butterfly on your toe,” he said.
“I love you,” Harry said.
“Or warned you, at least.”
“Come to my rooms later, I’m sure I can find something to entice you with.”
“You do these tests wandlessly?”
Fuck, he needed to get out of this.
“I am rather brilliantly observant, Harry, perhaps you’ve heard. And you’re right. You’re good at most things, but this — no, you’re not very good at it at all. I seem to remember that the last time I got close enough to try that you disapparated through about a thousand years of wards to get away from me. It’s the sort of thing one doesn’t forget in a hurry.”
So Potter had expected him to make some sort of a scene? Perhaps he’d been waiting for Draco to hit him with a jelly-legs jinx, or another of the old classics.
“You heard the opposite when he was, what — fifteen? He’s been an Auror for almost twenty years, Draco, you don’t think he learned anything in all of that time?”
Draco shrugged. “I did. It’s been… months, really.”
“Is there something you’d prefer?” Harry asked, quietly. Draco looked away from the tray, and shook his head. “You should try to eat a little. Or drink the juice, at least. The sugar might do you some good.”
“Oh.”
The owl hooted gently, and then took off, disappearing through a window that Draco would have sworn had been closed.
Harry shrugged. “Alright. It took them some time to clean it out. There was a lot of…” No point in finishing that sentence. “But with the beautiful grounds, and the clean air — they moved the Janus Thickey Ward there. St Mungo’s needed the space, and so did the ward. That takes up the west wing. The east is an orphanage. There were a lot of children…”
“No,” Draco says. Panic seethes in his guts. The Potter in this universe didn’t sound like that. These are not the words of the worn out Auror who’d wandered into the passenger side, agreeable to several uncomfortable hours in a moderately priced automobile. This is—that’s his—it sounds like—
“It was not the most likely outcome when this day began,” Narcissa replies, and Draco wishes he could reach across the formalities and hold her.
“Harry!” Hermione says, blinking furiously.
“I’m Draco’s best friend, not yours. You’re the shit who broke his heart. I’m not supposed to be helpful to
“How long are we going to dance around—”
Harry raged and Draco soothed. “
Harry thought
Harry thinks, but it’s fleeting.
Instinct tells him to find his wand.
My first Drarry and, oh my gosh, thank you to everyone who's reading along. <3
“I hate you,” Draco says, knows it’s a whimper, doesn’t care.
For a moment, Draco is properly dazzled. “Are you looking for anything in particular?”
“Yeah,” Harry says. “Yeah. I do.”
“No,” Draco whispers, and the wind picks up the word and whisks it away.
“Why would I agree to get into a vehicle with a relative stranger—”
“C’mon,” Harry said, again. “You’re actually gonna get frost bite.”
“This is—” Draco gasps and Harry dances around him, ghostly hands fluttering and useless, “inconvenient.” As his insides start to pool around his spindly limbs, Draco raises his wand arm and whispers, “
Pansy’s mouth opens and closes on nothing but air.
“Ten o’clock Potter, or I’m leaving without you.”
“I was.” Harry knows he was.
“I don’t want to talk about Potter,” Draco says, taking a long swallow.
“He’s a bit eccentric, then?” not-Potter asks, and Draco mentally chides himself for sorting the world of men into Potters and not-Potters.
Still, the vestiges of his pride prickle.
At some point—time has started to feel wobbly—a hand touches his shoulder blade.
