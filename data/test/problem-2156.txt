Before Harry could say anything the house elf was grabbing his hand and Apperated them both up to what Harry assumed was a guest bedroom.
Lucius looked up when he saw his wife walk in, “Narcissa Malfoy! Long time no see. I was wondering why you didn’t visit me in Azkaban.”
Hermione sighed, “I suppose. But I honestly have reason to believe that he doesn’t want to get married.”
Harry dropped the razor and collapsed to the floor, blood spilling out of his cuts. Malfoy ran over, dropping down beside him and looking panicked.
Harry stared at him, eyes wide. He knew what Draco meant and it absolutely disgusted him. Without any warning Harry wrapped his arms around the other. Draco gave a start, but relaxed.
Malfoy seems unfazed as he looks down his nose at me. (I absolutely hate that I’m several inches shorter.) “On the contrary, I would argue that you’ve been stalking me.”
Draco inwardly groaned, he was hoping to do this assignment alone. He had tried to avoid talking to anyone at all since the war.
Snape gives me a nasty smile, “Potter. So nice of you to join us. As I'm sure you've heard, Mr. Malfoy here will be joining you.”
Draco had seen the Weasley walking around Hogwarts with these. He had always been a little jealous of the warmth that they seemed to radiate. He had made fun of them, but only because he wanted one himself.
I don’t even bother fighting back. What’s the point. Malfoy’s always purposely taking jabs at me. This year is the year that I've finally chosen to ignore his snide comments. I thought it would help, but turns out it just builds the tension between us. And oddly enough, I like the adrenaline rush I get when I’m arguing with him.
The person’s wand flares. Standing behind the small light of the wand, looking directly at me is Draco Malfoy.
They tried several different spells, but none of them ever seemed to work. Then Harry suggested something that Draco was thinking about, but couldn’t say due to his ‘Deatheaterness’.
“Relax Potter!” Draco huffed, “Your forgetting that I happen to be a Malfoy. The Manor is Unplottable, only people who know about it can get in.”
That thought finally seemed to register in his head; he pulled back his eyes wide. The same expression was mirrored on Harry's face. Something in his chest broke.
Okay, I just /had/ to add Luna into this one. Only because I think she has a lot more knowledge and wisdom than everyone thinks.
Voldemort raised his wand. What felt like a thousand tiny shards of glass hit him like a bull. They kept cutting deeper and deeper.
So every morning when Draco got to the Ministry he would keep his head down and walk quickly to his own office. The fact that he was even allowed a job was a miracle.
What was going on? Why did he feel like this? Would anyone else figure out? Draco had never felt so vulnerable.
They Apperated right outside of the Three Broomsticks’ door. It was especially chilly for November and all three of them didn’t have coats.
“You’d be surprised how well a thirteen year old can recall a story when you give them enough cookies. And, am I wrong? Are you a part of the community?. You don’t have to tell me, but I want to help you with whatever you're going through. I know the pressure of the wizarding world is a lot sometimes, and I don’t want to add to that.”
Then both men seemed to remember who they were cuddling with. They both got up at the same time, and Draco had to turn his face away so that Harry wouldn't see his cherry red face.
Draco thought for a moment, “Now we just have to figure out where the culprit is going to go next. ‘Cause we know that they’re trying to use the Horcrux’s magic to make the Time-Turner stronger. I don’t think they would use it in Godric’s Hollow, where you were made one, or Hogwarts. And I doubt they know where you stayed as a child. So we can rule out those possibilities.”
Harry followed Malfoy up the stairs. He stopped when he reached their dorm and put an ear to the door.
“You know Draco,” she said smiling, “It was an arranged marriage. By your father. But he’s in Azkaban now right? So I would be okay if you decided not to get married.”
*”Mr. Potter. Please! Listen, the curse that hit Mr. Malfoy was a strong one. It seems to be spreading from his back. The potions we’re using can only delay the process.”
“I went back to the Manor with my mother. I was glad to be given time to recover, but it wasn’t enough. And the Manor,” Draco shivered, “There’s so many bad memories, and it’s so dreary all the time. My mother would never leave her room, I doubt she would even leave her bed. It was a sad, dark time.
He had made the Weasleys’ life hell. They should have yelled. Kicked him out. Screamed in his face. And yet they didn’t do any of those things. They had forgiven him. Hell! They had even given him a Weasley Jumper.
Harry sighed. Everything was going wrong. He heaved himself out of bed once more and left the room for a drink. Just as he was about to walk down the stairs he heard voices.
I stop dead. Did I really just have those thoughts? Someone bumps into me from behind and I snap back to reality. I duck behind a tapestry, take off my Invisibility Cloak, and let out a breath.
Harry gave him a reproachful look. “I’ve told you to stop saying that. We’ve been dating for what? Five years now? Potter just seems too juvenile for you.”
Harry shrugged, “Well for one, I prefer cocks. And umm… I think I had a little thing for Cedric back in fourth year, but we all know how that ended…” He trailed off, avoiding Draco’s gaze.
Draco let out a bark of laughter, “Pansy? No way! Did you never notice that she was and is a lesbian?”
“Hello Draco, Harry.” Hermione said smiling. She looked down at Draco’s hands then gave him a pointed look. He was suddenly aware that he was still holding Harry’s hand. He quickly snatched it back. He’s going to have to be more careful in the future.
Before Dean went to grab more rocks Harry had to ask him about something that had been on his mind for a while: “Was it hard, to come out? Was it scary?”
“But how? You can only feel a magical signature if that person has put a spell on you in the past, right?” Harry's face contorted and he drew a sharp breath, “What did he do to you?”
Harry paused on the way up the stairs. He really did not want to see Malfoy again. So instead of continuing up to his dorm he turned around and walked straight out of the 8th year common room.
“I’m sorry Mr. Potter, but sometimes the only thing we can do is let them go. Sometimes it’s too cruel to keep them in pain. We will keep giving him the potions for two more days in order for you to say goodbye. But he is still unconscious, so be prepared.”
Suddenly a glob of cake hit the side of his head. He turned, and to his surprise, Hermione was looking at him smugly. “That’s what you get.” She said and stuck her tongue out.
“And then, three weeks before Hogwarts was about to start, they held our trials. Which you came to. You made a change you know, they let me go, but on the condition that I returned to Hogwarts. They put my mother on house arrest… but my father. Well you were there, so I’m sure you know what happened.
He felt drained and empty. He kept crying until he thought there were no tears left. But there were more. There were always more.
“So we were sitting up in the tree, and having a pretty deep conversation. He told me… something… that made me cry. And ummm… I really don’t know what happened next… I don’t know who started it, but we… We might have kissed.”
Draco scrunched his face, “I did not need that comparison. But, if you're too much of a coward, I suppose I’ll have to deal with it.”
Harry stood there dumbly; it was the first time Draco had cried in front of him since their 6th year at Hogwarts.
Harry reached out and grabbed the ropes binding Lucius. He held out a hand to Draco but before the blonde could grab it there was a blinding flash of white light. For a moment everything was still and Draco was lifted off his feet in almost a heaven like state. Then he was slammed to the floor and everything went black.
The thing I would like to say is that, a lot of people Have no idea what fan-fiction is. And even if they do, some people frown upon it seeing fan-fiction writers as unoriginal and uninspired. And i want you all to know that, those presumptions are completely untrue.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Come off it! You don’t need your mum all the time. I think you can take care of yourself. Besides I want to show you something!”
The Unspeakable named Rin Cloherback looked nervous talking to him, “Mr. Border wants to see you in his office.”
Harry pursed his lips, “Alright. I just won’t tell you the thing I was going to tell you.” Harry plopped down on the couch beside his boyfriend, crossing his arms and pouting.
Malfoy wrinkles his nose as if disgusted at the thought, “I guess there are two things that really set Gryffindors and Slytherins apart: Gryffindors are oblivious as fuck. And they have no idea how to flirt.”
Harry quickly ran up to put the Dispeller Charm of the ropes. And Draco just stood there trying to catch his breath.
“... Then I just leaned over and kissed him! I kissed him, mother! I’m getting married soon! I can’t go around kissing other people!” He was acting like a baby, but it didn't matter now because his mother was the most understanding person in the world.
A duel ensued. Harry’s frequent use of Expelliarmus proved to be futile as Lucius was doing wandless magic. He only knew how to do the Unforgivables which he probably learned from the Dark Lord. It proved as an advantage and a disadvantage. They knew which spells he was using but they had to be extra careful to avoid them.
Harry looked like he was starting to catch on. “So, that means that the Time-Turners could go even further back! But how far does this person want to go?”
“Still you.” Draco said, flying down as well and casting an amused look at his boyfriend. “I’m not the one sticking my tongue out.”
“Oh. Hello Harry.” She said. As if it was the most normal thing in the world for them to both be walking to school.
Draco was curled in a ball on the floor, hands clutching his hair, breath coming in short gasps. Harry noticed a knife on the floor beside him. The Gryffindor hurriedly took the knife and Vanished it. Then he walked over to Draco, picked him up and put him on the bed.
“Hullo everyone. Um… I’d just like to say a few things… Well for one, I hope everyone’s excited for the new school year.”
We’re so close to each other. I can feel his breath on my forehead. I’m a couple of inches shorter than Malfoy, so I have to crane my neck to keep eye contact. But that doesn’t last long; his lips are eye magnets. Malfoy notices, smirks a little and grabs the back of my head.
With it’s final words the Howler ripped itself up. Draco stood there as little bits of paper floated down on him.
“Drop a toaster in my bath, and watch my mum and dad laugh. See a thousand volts go through the son they wish they never had.”
Hey y'all! There is some homophobia and homophobic language in this chapter, as well as verbal abuse. So please stay safe! And enjoy!
Harry brushed off the thing poking him in the arm and sat up. “What?” He said groggily, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
Forced onto the ‘Dark Side’ as I was the ‘Light’. Not having any choice in the matter. Forced to keep face in public just as I was.
She got to her feet and grabbed the wand from Draco’s nightstand. (He had no recollection of ever putting it there.) Then she whisked out of the room, leaving Draco with his haunting thoughts.
Ron lifted Hermione off of the ground and kissed her hard. Everyone cheered. George threw one of his Wildfire Whiz-bangs into the air and it exploded, encasing the room in dancing red and gold, flying pigs.
Then she pulled him into a hug. To Draco, this kind of touch was not something that happened often. But it felt good to know that someone cared about him.
Draco tried not to show any surprise. He had watched Unspeakable after Unspeakable be assigned field tasks while he stayed at his office.
A vague memory flashed before his eyes and he smirked, “I think I can choose the wrong sort for myself thanks.”
‘I will in a second.’ Draco thought. Harry had been hiding in their room waiting for orders to assist him. Their Auror training really came in useful for this situation.
“I asked Hermione about it, and of course, she went to the library and looked it up. When she came back she told me the reason I still had your wand was because there was a 'connection’ between us.”
Harry’s anger only increased, “I don’t care if you don’t take orders from me. Because if you don’t leave this girl I will make you.”
Ron chuckled, “Oh, yeah. Harry told us that you got a Howler from your mum! He said that you were too afraid to go back.”
When the two of them got home Draco headed to the bathroom to change out of his dress robes. He also got a small gold box out of a cabinet. Just as he was putting his shirt back on he heard Harry exclaim, “Hermione too?!”
“I’m sorry I didn’t get you a present. When I was discharged they told me to stay at home, and that I couldn't go out. I didn’t want to go back to the Manor after everything, so I ended up staying at the Hospital, but they wouldn’t let me go out to get you anything-”
“Good morning, Draco.” Lucius said. Draco stiffened. He had always been afraid of his father. And that fear had only grown over the past few years.
“Harry. Have you ever heard of the slime spell? ‘The Slime Spell, when used correctly, coats your opponent in a layer of slime.’ It sounds quite childish to me.”
Harry had a panic attack when he saw it. He said something about Dumbledore’s right hand. Draco knew he was back on the astronomy tower. Watching Dumbledore fall.
Ginny gave him a devilish grin. “You know now that I think about it… You two certainly had a lot of sexual tension! Remember in your 4th year? You made those ‘Potter Stinks’ badges! It was hilarious to watch. You even got up in a tree and tried to impress him.”
Harry took a deep breath and tried to get his temper under control. He forced his face and posture to relax, “Ron, Hermione, there’s nothing to worry about. I’m perfectly fine. These are just scratches.”
Lavender gives Ron a look and they promptly start making out. Dean gags and Hermione seems to disappear all together. She was getting better at talking to Ron, but she still gets choked up from his PDA with Lavender.
Harry rolled his eyes, and flopped down on the couch beside him. “Well now you're not. Cause I’m here and I want to talk to you.”
Harry’s confidence slowly dimmed as Malfoy looked back and forth between him and his hand with a raised eyebrow.
Harry snorted and soon the three of them were trashing the entire kitchen with globs of bi cake. The elves were cowering behind stoves and cabinets to avoid the flying clumps.
Twenty minutes later Harry was walking down the stairs, desperately trying to flatten his semi-dry hair. (As usual his attempts were fruitless.)
The game picked up after that, people finally getting used to the absurd dares. Pansy dared Ron to shave his eyebrows off. (“Not again!”) and Neville confessed that he never really felt like a true Gryffindor until he pulled that sword out of the Hat.
Narcissa cocked her head, her attention now on Harry and not Draco. “What I mean is, we’ve noticed patterns in when and where the Turners are being used. And your Manor could possibly be the next place.”
Harry glanced down at his letter, it had his name and Draco's address on it. He tore open the envelope, inside was a letter from Ron and Hermione.
When everyone was gathered by the table and waiting for the food, Molly came out of the kitchen with a sly look on her face, which was incredibly unusual.
Harry wandlessly summoned the file. Without explaining he grabbed Draco’s hand. For what felt like the uptenth time he was whisked unwillingly into darkness.
The blonde smiled and handed the tiny creature his trunk, Cosmo carried it with surprising strength. “I’ll be back for yours Master Potter!” He said, and Apperated away.
“The wards that have been broken are the spell wards. But the house has been entered. How is that possible? Unless…”
He watched as Harry nodded, and grabbed the Time-Turner off of Draco. He gave the nob the slightest twitch and disappeared.
I step through the door, and immediately do a double take. Malfoy is sitting at Hagrid’s table with a giant mug in his hands.
“Well, I don’t think it’s any surprise, but he used the Cruciatus Curse on me and my family.” Draco was desperately trying to keep his tone light and avoid tears. “After what happened with you at the Manor, he was furious. I would have bled to death in the dungeons if it weren't for my mother. I owe her. That’s why I'm still staying, even after all these years.”
“It’s quite alright Harry, I actually quite enjoy your company. Ginny and Neville can be a bit chaotic. But you seem at peace most of the time.”
My thoughts are interrupted by a tap on my arm. “What now Hermione! I'm in the middle of a train of thought!”
“I was a Horcrux. I think it felt like my signature because at the time a little bit of Voldemort was trapped inside of me.”
Harry nodded, “Me too. I always thought I had a romantic attraction to you, but maybe it was just a familial love. I don’t really know.”
So you can imagine how surprised he was when Ron accidentally burned a loaf of bread, and didn’t have to eat it. It was in between Harry’s first and second year that Harry learned how a loving family behaved.
Parvati laughed and then kissed Lavender hard. When they broke apart the room seemed a little shell shocked, but the two were both beaming with happiness and hugging each other.
Draco watched Harry’s pupils blow wide and he seemed to have lost the ability to speak because he mutely nodded. He was aroused.
Draco nodded, “Ivy and Dobby were my only friends as a small child, besides Greg and Vincent.” His eyes clouded as he remembered his lost friend, “When my father was sentenced with the kiss, we were told to let them go. But Ivy didn’t want to leave, turns out she was hiding her children here. Cosmo and Coco. So we let them say, I offered freedom again when I left for Hogwarts but Ivy refused yet again.”
Harry waited for her to elaborate, but she didn’t. So they continued to walk in a comfortable silence. (Luna occasionally would point out a specific type of bird.)
Harry gazed at the letter. It wasn’t perfect, but he had gotten his message along. Maybe that would be enough. He attached the parchment to the school’s owl’s leg, and sent her off. Hopefully, he would be able to explain everything.
Draco could feel the blush start to creep into his cheeks, so he hid his face by picking up the files.
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, he had planned this moment the day before, but now he had no idea what he was doing. “So you got my note?”
Draco shook himself out of his shocked state once again, and took charge. “Alright, send your patronus for backup. I’ll locate where the criminal is. Then we should go secure my mother.”
“She would beg him not to join the Dark Lord. But he wouldn’t listen. Mother still has scars. Mental and physical. She did nothing to deserve it. But father was just out of control.”
The professor spun around and walked up to the chalkboard. “Not to worry Mr. Potter, I haven't introduced myself yet. Hello class. My name is Professor Lois Sadder. Although I have been called some not-so-nice names before, the worst of them being Book Germ and Nerdy Wolverine. So please, refrain from the nicknames.
And Harry was ever so confused when Mrs. Weasley hugged him for the first time. He thought she might be attacking him.
Hello wonderful humans! So, my mental state has not been the best recently, so the next chapter might be a little shorter than usual. Hopefully I can get it up next Wednesday. Cross your fingers! Anyway, enjoy!
Harry caught up to her and they walked in silence the rest of the way to the Great Hall. Harry’s silence was mostly because he was confused and surprised.
Harry went over to the other end of the shop. When he told Ginny, she just smirked and waved him off.
Suddenly Draco’s wand started to vibrate violently. He froze. No. This couldn’t be happening. His breathing started to increase and his hands clutched the fabric of the couch.
I bury my rapidly reddening face in my hands. I can't believe these people. They’re supposed to be my friends. You know, with my luck, and dramatic tension for readers, Malfoy would show up right about-
They appeared right outside of a bar called: The Angel’s Elm. Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, “Really? ‘The Angel’s Elm?’”
When they reached the heavy wooden door they paused. The door was open a crack, and there was banging on the inside. When Draco peered through the slit between the door in the wall he froze.
“Just as someone convinced me that the Order really can win the war. Someone convinced me to stand up to Severus. Someone convinced me to apologize to Hagrid. Someone convinced me to forget my sexist, racist, homophobic past, and change. Someone convinced me that Hermione really is the brightest witch of her age, and that the Weasleys really are wonderful people…
All the Weasleys turned to look at Harry. “I have a big announcement!” He proclaimed, “I am now dating Draco Malfoy.”
Draco rolled his eyes, “Hurry up then. We have a lot of work to do today.” He handed Harry a piece of toast and started to walk down to the front door.
Hermione nodded, “Okay, just know we’re here for you. Oh hey! I know how to cheer you up! Let's play another game.”
They spent the rest of the day checking the wards and lounging around Grimauld place. As moonrise drew nearer they grew more and more tense. Finally after hours of waiting the moon rose.
“Yes.” Lucius looked down at the chain on his neck. Harry took it off and handed it to Draco who put it in his pocket.
Narcissa stared at him, then walked over to sit on the edge of his bed. “What happened?” Her voice was so gentle, so Draco told her everything.
Harry nodded, “I’m glad to hear that. As for Blaise Zambini, well I can see why you like him. He’s pretty hot.”
“I mean that, in 6th year you were always saying how much of a Death Eater he was, and now you're defending him… it’s weird.”
When Harry entered the 8th year common room the first thing he noticed was the explosion of color. It seemed as if an entire rainbow was smashed together and stuffed in there. The room was in the shape of a square. Each corner had a different house color. They all met in the middle on a pinwheel carpet. It was an eyesore.
He gripped his wand and transfigured the tap into a blade. He raised it to his arm quickly, trying to do anything to distract himself from the world around him. But he stopped short, centimeters above his arm.
“C’mon Harry,” This time Ron spoke, “You know what we mean! How was the rest of your night with Malfoy?”
He shook himself; now was not the time for sappy shit. “Ron and Hermione told me to say…” Harry could not bring himself to say the word. Instead he said, “They uh, they also saw my new patronus. I know you're probably wondering about it too. I honestly don’t know why it changed.”
With that he turns around and steps out of the half-lit cupboard. Leaving me uncharacteristically breathless.
Harry blinked in confusion. Then it slowly dawned on him and he started laughing. He even saw Malfoy crack a small smile.
“Yes. Granger came up to me in Arithmancy. She said something about your 'mental health’. And me being the only one who can ‘bring you back.’ A load of bullshit in my opinion. I just wanted to know what you did to make her believe that you needed *me*, of all people.”
“I’ll be there for Christmas!” He promised them, closing the door behind him, “Just not the other days!”
‘Tick tock’ were the code words for ‘help’, and ‘stop the clock’ were the code words for ‘I need my wand.’
Harry’s shoulders drooped, “I don’t really know what it’s about. But I mean, I want to fix our friendship, even if we’re no longer dating.”
So he decided to have a little fun. He snapped open both eyes and said, “Can I help you? Or are you just going to stare at me all day?”
“Maybe the fact that he dresses super proper even if it’s just a night at the bar. Or that he is the biggest drama queen. Or maybe it’s because he spends hours on his hair and gets annoyed if one strand is out of place! Or those fucking boots? His while being just screams: ‘I'm gay!’”
I raise my eyebrows, “Did you just manage to compliment Hermione and be civil to me in the same sentence? I’m impressed.”
He climbed all the way to the top of the school. Harry passed Dumbledoor’s study and opened a large door a little ways down the corridor.
But as Malfoy swung onto the back of his broom a flaming Griffin fastened it’s claws around the blonde and pulled him back into the raging flames. The last thing Harry saw was his petrified face as the flames swallowed him whole.
“Yeah, they’re like family now. And, I've told them that they can just call me Draco, but they still like the old titles.”
“It’s the new, Zonky Stinko gas. It leaves a cloud of bad smelling gas floating over someone's head for hours! Sometimes it rains on them!”
“Okay!” Dean said, the first to speak up. “Congratulations!” Everyone joined him in a hasty applause and the game continued. Although Lavender and Parvati seemed to disappear.
“I was attempting to go far enough back to re-hide the Dark Lord’s Horcruxes. I thought if I did it on the full moon then it would have more power. Because as you probably know from Astronomy: the moon represents time and change, and therefore the power in time intensifies. And with the added power of the Horcruxes magical signiture’s I hoped to go back far enough.”
Ron started cracking up. “That makes so much sense!” He laughed, “I thought you were just jealous of him, but you just had a crush on him!”
“Yeah,” she agreed, “We’re all gossipy bitches sometimes. Anyway, you’re avoiding my question Harry. Who do you have a crush on?”
He heard the creaky door open. He turned to see who it was scrambling to his feet. Then he straightened his robes and tried to look dignified. He was unsuccessful.
The trio walked over to the Hogwarts gates, there they found Ron, Hermione, Dean, Seamus, Parvati, Lavender, and Luna.
“Well then you must have not met a lot of people. Say, are your friends Miss. Granger and Mr. Weasley homophobic.”
The first thing Harry saw when he slid through the partially opened doors was the fact that there were now five tables instead of four. He gave Luna a questioning look, but she was already flouncing off to the Ravenclaw table, not caring that she just appeared in mid air.
Harry opened his mouth and tried to think up a lie. “I was visiting Kreacher in the kitchens. I wanted to see how he was doing in his new home.”
So he sped past the door and kept on running. Then he noticed another door. It was the door to the Astronomy Tower. He dashed inside and slammed the door shut, hearing the sickening thuds of bodies hitting wood. He winced as he got faint flashbacks of the battle.
They returned to eating and Harry wondered why Draco looked so disappointed. Didn’t he want Harry there?
Okay! This is the end! Wow, it's really ending. I've been writing this for months and I'm just surprised to see it ending. Anyway I hope you've liked the story thus far! I might add an epilogue just to wrap things up, but I think this is it.
Draco muttered something about the loo and left the others. He crossed the pub and stepped outside. He slid down the wall to the ground putting his face in his hands.
Being gay wasn’t widely exepted in the Wizarding World. And even places that it was, people still had to keep it a secret. Harry had long ago suspected that he had an attraction to men. But had kept in under wraps in fear of anyone finding out. Especially the Dursley’s. If they suspected anything that would have done unthinkable things to him.
Harry and Hermione turned to see Ron running down the corridor toward them, obviously abandoning Neville to work on his own.
Potter had come to his hearing as well as his mother’s. Potter had told the Wizengamot about how Narcissa had saved his life in the Forbidden Forest. Potter said that Draco was forced into being a Death Eater, and didn’t deserve the same punishment as his father.
“I just assumed that you were part of the LGBTQ+ community by the way you defended that little girl. A lot of people would have turned a blind eye if they didn’t know her. But you didn’t, from what I hear you even used your ‘Savior’ card.”
Draco never got a chance to reply because at that moment, Weasley Apparated into the office. Not just anywhere in the office; he Apperated right on top of Draco.
Draco froze. Harry was about to find out the truth. You know what... As long as he thought that he only was a schoolboy crush, it was okay. “I might have.”
“I hope you understand that this will not go unpunished Mr. Potter. You walked in twenty minutes late! See me tonight before dinner, my office.
“Yeah, Malfoy.” Harry said, still annoyed at the bushy haired girl from earlier, “‘Mione, you refused to help me, so I found someone who was good at potions /and/ willing to help.”
Everyone in the room, (George, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Bill, Fluer, and Charlie) all let out a “Finally!”
“And! I have not been stalking you.” He sighs, “Actually your friend Granger came to me today in the library. She told me about your less than adequate way of living in the summer. She said I ought to talk to you. She seemed to be under the impression that I could help. Because of the family issues that I have.”
I frown, but walk over to the broom cupboard on the side of the office. I open the door and immediately sneeze. This thing hasn't been opened for ages.
Draco’s legs felt weak. He was never really good with feelings. At Hogwarts Greg’s pet snake had died in second year. Draco had told him that his snake was scum when Greg was balling his eyes out in the girls loo.
Harry walked down several flights of stairs, and stopped when he reached an alcove. The same alcove that he and Ginny would spend hours in. Just talking. He smiled at the memory and continued throughout the castle.
‘Is the school rebuilt enough? Would they have to do the rebuilding themselves? How many people were going back?’
The blonde inhaled; he knew the question was coming. “I don’t really want to talk about it.” He let his arms fall back to his sides, and instantly missed Harry’s warmth.
Harry pushed open the door and was immediately hit with the smell of Christmas: pine needles, baked goods and eggnog.
“I don’t know Harry, ever since you broke up with Ginny you've been acting weird. Now you're trying to get all cozy with Malfoy? It’s just not like you.”
“I don’t know what came over me.” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck, “I knew better than to bring up his dad, but I did it anyway.” Harry told them what had happened that morning on the Astronomy tower.
“Wow!” Harry said, obviously impressed. “Only your happiest memory can produce a full patronus on the first try!”
He and Neville sat down at a table in the furthest corner of the library. They were quiet for a long time.
Harry was suddenly suspicious. This could be a trick. The Daily Prophet might be trying to weasel information out of him.
He was right, when they got inside it was not at all what Draco was expecting. He was expecting a cozy cottage bar, instead he got a lively bar full of people. It was decorated in some sort of muggle fashion. There were bright colors everywhere you looked. One corner held a collection of bright sunglasses. Another held a rack of bright feather chains that looked extremely fake.
Harry gave a little chuckle at that one. Luna always knew when something was wrong. It was one of the things he liked best about her.
Draco held his ground as Lucius’ eyes bored into his. When Harry came back down with Narcissa they were still staring daggers at each other.
“As you know this is a makeshift year, a special year, a year to get back on your feet. So I have decided to make the rules a little less ‘air tight’. You will still have classes and N.E.W.Ts, but the curriculum won’t be as hard. You also get to enjoy the freedom of visiting Hogsmead every weekend if you so desire.”
The next time around, Draco felt his feet hit hard stone. The sound of rushing waves immediately filled his ears. And he tasted salt in his mouth.
He held the letter from his father in his hand. He didn’t want to go. But was there any point in arguing? His father still had a hold on him. Whether Draco liked it or not.
All of the Gryffindor 6th years grumble as they had the redhead their money. I'm appalled that they would do such a thing.
He sat up and noticed that his left arm was wrapped up. He tried to get up off the couch but the world spun and he flopped back down feeling very undignified.
Draco’s eyes widened. And he felt sick all of a sudden. Of course it was Potter! It was always Potter. With his messy hair and those damn green eyes! The next couple of weeks were going to be very long indeed.
Draco heaved a sigh, his tears subsiding. He finally found the strength to say sarcastically: “Yes Potter, I’m crying my eyes out in front of you. Of course I'm fine.”
“Then Fluer had her baby. When we went to that bar the Weasleys were so kind. But they had no right to be. Molly just forgave me on the spot. And Arthur didn’t even take my apology!”
Harry grabbed the small cardboard box lying next to the pile and put it in his pajama pocket. He had noticed a couple of days ago that Hermione had a fancier velvet one next to her bed. He could only imagine what would happen on Christmas. Harry smiled knowingly, he had been waiting a long time for this day. Ron was in for a surprise.
When I turn around, Malfoy is nowhere to be found. ‘Figures.’ I think, ‘of course he would ditch. He probably has to go and do whatever task Voldemort has given him.’
He thought back to his conversation with Professor Sadder. ‘A cake and an apology letter confessing your true feelings usually works.’
Kreacher stepped out from behind a fairly large crockpot, “Of course master.” He pointed to a table behind him. On it sat a large vanilla frosted cake.
Then he remembered all those years they spent antagonizing each other. There was really no need to after their third or fourth year, but they kept at it. Always trying to top the other with their pranks and insults.
“Your dad handed the book to Ginny right before second year. Is there any place he could have kept it?”
Draco started to make his way to the fireplace to Floo back to the Manor and face his mother. (His stomach was starting to feel queasy from all of the Apparating and Disapparating.) But as he was turning away he felt a hand grab his wrist. Harry had finally calmed down.
Draco pushed himself off of the ground. “I was just standing there and you decided to Apparate. And you happened to appear right on top of me.” He snapped coolly, brushing invisible dust off of his robes, “And Potter you can stop laughing.”
Draco shut his eyes tight and focused on his memory. A memory he had just made while kissing the raven haired man.
Harry looked reproachfully down at the elf, “I thought I told you to stop calling me that. And I would like you to please make Draco some breakfast.”
Harry was walking down the rows of shelves looking for a certain Slytherin, when he was pulled into an alcove.
Draco’s face lit up, “Of course!” He said excitedly, “Father would always tell me to never open this box in the root cellar! It seemed about the size of a book!”
Draco was baffled, “Well most of the time, I think about how your stupid hair gives me a migraine every morning.”
Harry’s eyes lit up, “That reminds me!” He pulled a small cardboard box out of his pocket. “Here, I got you something.”
Draco shot him a glare, but accepted the package Molly was holding. It was wrapped in bright orange paper with little Golden snitches. He carefully undid the wrapping and almost dropped it.
Draco smirked a little, “Is the Savior of the Wizarding World being horny? Who knew I'd be the one to witness it.”
The flesh was raw, but the Dark Mark was still there. As if it was imprinted into his very bones. But he cared about that.
Half of the students took a shot. Including Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson. It was Neville’s turn next. He said, “Never have I ever purposely skipped class.” All of the students drank including Hermione. Who, again, surprised everyone.
The four of them walked into the store. Ginny and Luna wandered off to look at some of the muggle romance novels, Neville went up to the front desk, and Harry walked the isles, not looking for anything in particular.
“Alright, I’ll go get them now.” Harry got up and walked toward the bar. And Hermione wasn’t wasting any time.
“I’m so sorry.” Harry mumbled into the cotton of Draco’s nightshirt. He didn’t respond. When Harry looked back up he found tears streaming down the Slytherin’s face. He reached up to wipe them off, then stiffened when he realized their faces were inches apart.
Hermione and Ron followed Harry into his room. They all sat in a circle on Harry’s bed like they were 2nd years about to play Truth or Dare.
I glare at him. And my hand slips on the jumping bean pod. It zooms away from my knife and hits Lavender Brown’s caldron. It explodes.
The man whipped around, “Crucio!” Draco was lifted off his feet and thrown back by the force of the spell. Luckily Harry had intercepted with a Shield Charm and blocked the worst of it. Yep. This was definitely the real Lucius Malfoy.
I stare at him stunned. Nevil has always insisted upon being straight. I definitely did not expect this.
“What if there was magic there at one point? What if the person is trying to go really far back? 50 years or so. Because we know that magic fades over time. So maybe there was something there at some point?”
Harry’s face was stony when he suggested, “Why don’t we look around for any source of magic. This place looks like it hasn't been in operation for years.”
“My brain was muddled with alcohol. I thought if I cut off the Mark it would all go away. But it didn't, it's still here. As well as the memories.”
He was shocked when Ginny started asking Mr. Weasley about the newspaper. When he tried to warn her off, Mr. Weasley just chuckled and answered all of her questions.
“Yes. I am. Cosmo came and told me that you had remodeled the house, and suddenly I had the energy to get up.”
“Good morning Draco. The house elves prepared your breakfast. I know you have to get to work but please eat something.”
Harry walked down the stairs and to what he assumed was the dining room. He could barely find his way around the house. It was so big and grand, nothing like what he had grown up with.
Draco blinked. What just happened? Why was Molly being so nice? Even after everything he had done to them?
He went to open the door, but Harry put a hand on his shoulder. “Uhh, thank you for helping me back there. I really appreciated it.”
“Want to talk about it?” Harry reached up to wipe tears of Draco’s face that he hadn’t known were there.
Harry chuckled, and nodded. She dug around her bag and pulled out a trans flag bandana. “Can you sign this please?”
“Harry! Look!” Ron’s yelling pulled Harry from his thoughts. He was holding up a long thin package, which could only be one thing.
Harry held it out to him, “I don’t know why, but after the war I still wanted to use your wand, even though I fixed my old one. I just figured you wanted it back.”
Ron rolled his eyes, “Do you remember what you were like in First Year Seamus?” He pulled out his wand. “Look at me! I'm going to turn my water into rum! Weeeeee.”
Harry just stared. Percy was the first to begin talking again: “So as I was saying: I was just standing by his desk and…”
Draco smirked, then leaned down and pulled Harry into a rough kiss. As their lips met, lights exploded behind Draco’s closed eyes and there was a ball of heat in his stomach threatening to explode. He grabbed the glasses of Harry’s face and threw them on the bedside table.
With a swish Snape leaves the room, and I resist the urge to set off a glitter bomb at the excessiveness. Then I realize that I'm alone in a room with Draco Malfoy. And suddenly that task he was assigned seems more intimidating.
“So.” Harry said, making a feeble attempt at small talk, “How have you been keeping up with your studies.”
He was about to take a sip when a purple paper airplane hit the side of his head. The steaming coffee sloshed all over his hand and robes. He silently cursed. Every damn thing going wrong today.
“Nah, I like it better up here. Where I’m /usually/ not disturbed by people trying to get me to apologize.”
When Harry was finally able to stop his fit, he said, “You’re telling me that you're mad because someone didn’t take your apology?!?!”
But the thing that surprised Draco the most was when Harry wrapped his arms around him. Despite his brain screaming at him not to do it, Draco leaned into the touch. He was still shaking and felt oddly comfortable in Harry’s arms. Like that was where he was meant to be. And maybe it was.
“Welcome back.” McGonagall said when she reached them, there was a warmth in her eyes that hadn’t been there when she was addressing the other students.
When he looked out over the horizon it immediately took his breath away. The stars were the brightest white. The moon was close to being full and it was casting down a silver light making everything shine.
His spells started faltering as his eyelids fluttered closed. He was losing so much blood. But he didn't care.
A couple of minutes later he heard Malfoy walk in. Harry was already in his bed and staring at Ginny’s dot on the Marauders Map. He sighed, turned out his wand light, rolled over, and tried to get some rest. Although it was doubtful that he would get any. He never got sleep anymore, not after the battle.
Draco didn’t say anything, he was too busy trying not to give himself away. He knew exactly what Pansy was talking about.
Harry also noticed that Draco spent a considerably long time in the library, making sure the paint was perfect, and that all the books were in order. When Harry asked why he explained that is was his mother’s favorite room.
“Gay. Maybe. I mean I think so. All of the girls I've dated…  well it just didn’t feel right I guess.”
‘Oh,’ Harry thought, ‘Of course he only cares about himself.’ He told himself that it didn't matter whether Malfoy cared about him or not. But then why did it hurt?
“Master Harry has summoned Kretcher to the most Noble and Ancient House of Black. What service would Master require?” His voice was scratchy.
Harry gave him a doubtful look. “You can go if you want to. But I’m not sure you’ll come back alive. I took the wards off of Grimmauld, but I still think she’ll flay you if you Apparate there right now.”
He was able to get all of the stains out with his wand. He picked up the neglected memo, and opened it. It immediately jumped out of his hand and started to talk:
“Magic.” Hermione said, smirking, “And now I am placing a spell on this room that binds you to your dares. It is a spell of my own making, so there’s no loopholes.”
Ron finished writing the letter and sent the owl out the window. He was oblivious to the tension in the room, so he said, “Hermione and the others are going over to The Three Broomsticks to celebrate, do you want to come too, Harry?”
Draco couldn’t take it anymore. The idea of getting *cozy* with Harry Potter was enough to make a blush creep up his neck.
“I was just walking down the corridor to Trelawny’s office, when Luna. Luna Lovegood, just straight up kissed me! Right there! She grabbed my tie and kissed me! Harry, I've been waiting for this for so, so, so long! I think we’re dating now. I mean, who kisses and then just doesn’t date? It’s stupid. But we’re dating now! I think. Merlin! I’m dating Luna Lovegood!” Ginny lets out a girly squeal at the end.
Everyone froze, as they watched Dean take a shot as well. Harry muttered a quick spell under his breath and watched as his shot glass faded back to its original clear color.
Both Harry and Hermione laughed through their tears. Harry walked over to the cake. Under the white frosting there were three layers: a pink one, a purple one, and a blue one. It was a bisexual cake.
Draco handed Harry a letter. Then he picked up Errol, “He can stay with my owl for a while.” He left the room with Errol cradled in his arms.
“Then I was given this case with you. And that made things a whole lot more awkward. I was eventually going to give you a sincere apology, but being a Malfoy and all we aren't really good at saying ‘sorry’. So I just didn’t apologize at all.”
When Harry arrived in Transfiguration he was disheveled. He had rips in his robe where the owls had pecked him to death. The new Transfiguration teacher looked at him with pity. Just as everyone else had.
“I’m good, I was sent over here to ask if you two wanted to come to Hogsmead soon, some of the oldest members of the D.A. are coming.”
“And?” Draco said. He was trying to keep his tone nonchalant, but he was sure Harry could feel his heartbeat.
“Oh sorry, I didn’t mean to word it like that. It’s just, you seem to care about him a lot more than before.”
“Hey yeah!” Ron exclaimed, “And this year you’ve been so nice to him. Harry! You have a crush on Malfoy!”
Malfoy was lying on his bed face up, staring at the ceiling. Harry opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He had run after Malfoy in a hurry, now that he was here he had no idea what to do.
Draco's eyes widened, and he said, a little more urgently this time, “Tick tock, stop the clock. Because I got the feeling that I’m gonna get shot.”
Hermione cleared her throat, “As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted: We are playing Truth or Dare, but with a twist. A wizard twist. In my pocket I have a large vile of Veritaserum.”
That was all it took. Draco leaned down even further and smashed their lips together. They rolled around on the grass. Their laughter filled the night air. They finally stopped, gasping for air, and half under a white rose bush. Petals fell down around them.
Draco shuddered and his head snapped up. He was sweating hard, and his hands were clutching the blankets. The dream had been so real…
Draco’s eyebrows felt like they were part of his hairline, “Quite alright Potter,” he said, “But you certainly have gained quite a mouth since school.”
Draco scowled, “At least I’m not up at the crack of dawn, fiddling with muggle shit and waking everyone else.”
Harry woke to a sharp knock on the door and Hermione’s voice ringing through the fog in his head. “Harry? Harry. Are you alright? How’d it go?”
“Well you see, I may or may not have a crush on your ex-girlfriend. And since you and I are friends I just thought I should ask if-”
Malfoy has a crazed look in his eye. “Of course! You are having a bloody panic attack right there on the bloody ground! How can I not be scared?”
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This-
“Speaking of patronus’... now that you're finally awake, I’m going to make *sure* you can conjure one.”
All of the Weasleys were looking at him. He managed to choke out a “Thank you” to Molly. She nodded, then went to pass out everyone else presents.
“Don't listen to them.” Harry blurted before he could stop himself. “They don’t know how bad outing someone can be. They’ve never experienced how scary coming out is. They don’t know what it’s like to be shunned for who you love, or your gender identity. So don’t listen to them. You’re amazing just the way you are, and no one should ever tell you otherwise! And if they do, well fuck them!”
Harry buried his face in his hands and he started to shake. And Draco couldn’t stand it anymore. So he scooted closer and wrapped his arms around the crying man. It was his turn to help.
Ron looks up from across the table, “Can we please come back to this later? Breakfast!” He picks up a price of toast and starts to butter it.
Cosmo and Coco nodded, looking dead on their feet. As they slumped back down the stairs at the kitchens, Draco turned to Harry. “I’m going to check on my mother. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Harry shook his head, ashamed. “Ginny, I tried to sit down and write to you. But every time I did, I would just lose motivation.”
Potter looked confused, then he blinked and started to crack up. Draco started to laugh along with him. A light warm feeling was slowly creeping all through his body and he felt a lot lighter than he had all morning.
Draco grabbed the collar of Harry's shirt, pulled him closer and slammed their lips together. Harry gasped as their lips connected. Draco kissed him with a passion that took his breath away. He tasted of cinnamon and coffee, and smelled of lemon and citrus.
Krecher looked down at the parchment and then back up at Harry, “This is an ambitious cake, Master. And I can tell that it’s an original. But the directions here are perfect, how did you know how to make it?”
“You idiot!” Hisses a voice behind me. I turn and see Malfoy holding his wand aloft. “You just closed the door! Now we won’t be able to get out for hours unless someone comes to find us. And I doubt Severus will. Did you not listen to him! He said not to close the door…”
As Harry walked down the empty corridors a feeling of nostalgia swept over him. He passed the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy's foolish attempt to train a group of eight trolls for the ballet. He could still recall the first time Fred and George had told him about it.
Ginny smacks me lightly on the arm and says, “You're one to talk, how long have you been stalking Malfoy?”
The Slytherin opened the door, and they stepped inside the house. To Harry’s surprise it wasn’t dusty at all, he thought it would be since Draco’s mother was stuck in bed. ‘But they have house elves.’ He thought, ‘That makes sense.’
He suddenly stopped talking with a gasp, for Draco had gotten down on one knee. He removed one of his gloves and touched the snitch with his bare hand. It opened up with a click to reveal a small ring.
As everyone left the room, Harry turned to Draco who seemed a little nervous, “See? I told you they wouldn't care!”
Draco lay limp in Harry’s arms and finally finished with the story. And Harry buried his nose in Draco’s hair.
Draco lost it, “No, no. Your right. If I had left my mother in that situation, I would never forgive myself.” But he wasn’t crying about that. He was crying because Harry had just said that he really cared. He was crying because he had just realized how deep this was going to get.
It wasn't until he'd levitated a freshly-made chicken salad sandwich and glass of iced water onto the path next to Malfoy and covered them with stasis charms that he realised Hermione was watching him with a curious expression on her face.
It was therefore with a sense of foreboding that he stepped past the gents' toilets in the middle of the park and allowed his feet to lead him along the same path through the shrubbery that Malfoy had taken four days earlier. It seemed somehow inevitable when Malfoy was there, stepping through the wrought iron gates by the bushes, his face white and surprised as he saw Harry.
"They can't anyway." Malfoy wiped at the sweat on his forehead. "I'm on probation remember? No magical interference of any kind."
How had he allowed himself to forget that they were just using him? He was a pathetic excuse for a pureblood; the Malfoy's and the Blacks must all be spinning in their tombs. The Ministry needed his inside knowledge to solve their pathetic little case and then he would be pushed aside and forgotten so they could all get back "to normal".
With a quick smile she was gone and Harry was left alone with his thoughts and a sleeping Death Eater on his path.
"No. It's medicinal. But I wasn't meant to have it, so..." He shrugged. "They'll believe the worst, I'm sure."
It wasn't immediately clear to Harry why this was the case. He'd known Malfoy since they were eleven and Merlin knows he'd spent enough years keeping track of him. He'd never come across as particularly interesting before; spiteful, spoilt, irritating and scheming perhaps, but not interesting.
"You didn't manage too well on the way here," noted Harry drily. "Besides, you heard the doctor; you can't be by yourself. So, what was that about anyway? Concussion?"
"Tough luck, taxi is on its way. Seriously Malfoy, you need to get treatment, especially as no-one can do a diagnostic spell on you."
Harry snorted, torn between amusement, duty and anxiety at the implications of the find. "Ranworth didn't go through the ledger?"
The vase shot into the air and exploded as it hit the ceiling, glass shards tinkling down onto the table top in a translucent shower.
Malfoy's teeth chattered, his fingers transferring their grip to Harry's forearm, where they danced like small flames against his skin as tremors wracked Malfoy's frame.
"I just wanted to feel the sun..." He shivered, speaking more to himself than Harry as he turned his face towards the yellow light. "It's so cold."
"Well, we can ask him when he wakes up. In the meantime, Mr Potter, I must insist you rest." Madam Pomfrey regarded him sternly.
Malfoy's face held a hint of approval, though it was probably more at the snarkiness in Harry's tone than his Gryffindor boldness and sense of fair play.
She faced him then, hands on her hips, reminding him powerfully of her rather bossy Hogwarts persona.
Harry glanced through the door, surprised to see Malfoy sitting on the path with his face turned up to the sun. His eyes were closed, there was an unexpected splodge of mud on his chest and his feet were bare, something about the long, shapely bones strangely erotic. Harry turned away quickly, attraction battling with shame. He vowed never to let his guard down around Malfoy again.
Malfoy didn't reply but an expression flitted across his face that was pure grief before he replaced it with his usual impassive mask. Harry suspected it would not have slipped at all if he wasn't so injured.
This prompted a very Malfoyesque scowl, but surprisingly he then went quiet, his grey eyes roaming over the vast variety of miserable people, finally settling on a wailing toddler with her arm in a temporary plaster cast and a steady stream of snot descending from her nose. He stared at her for a while and then muttered something under his breath.
"Doesn't know. Reckon they think he's got a soft spot for you." Weasley sighed." I dunno why, but looks like they might be right. Anyway, that's it. Just wanted to warn you."
It was almost affectionate, the way Potter was stroking him with his work-roughened fingertips, the way he kissed Draco softly on the corner of his mouth and mouthed the side of his neck. Draco steeled himself mentally from the hurt that would result if he let himself believe such things; Potter was a hugger, that's all. It didn't mean anything other than he was basically a nice person and wanted to make sure Draco was alright and got off too.
The garden and the brick wall beyond seemed to be sliding to the left, in the same vaguely nauseating fashion things had been for most of the day, apart from the few seconds when Potter's lips had been on his and the whole universe had centered on right here, right now. Draco had to conclude that Madam Pomfrey had been right; he should have stayed in bed. The whole tornado thing could probably be blamed on exhaustion. Potter? Not so much.
"That's it, mate," said Weasley finally, pulling up the neck of his jumper against the spit of cold rain. "That's the last restaurant I'm going in without getting something to eat."
Draco swallowed, nodded despite the throbbing in his head and escaped out of the door before he did something unforgiveably stupid like bursting into tears.
Draco ate, a study in calmness as he cut and chewed a bacon sandwich, forcing each mouthful down in the hope it would still the anxious clench of his stomach. He observed Potter surreptitiously from beneath his eyelashes, noting in a rather hopeless way that Potter's rumpled morning hair looked so incredibly soft that he could almost feel the texture of it beneath his fingertips.
Harry dragged a hand through his hair, feeling bone-weary and disappointed and completely disillusioned. What had the war been for? He was sure it was something to do with equality and not being ruled by tyranny.
Harry wrenched his attention from his pensive study of Malfoy's prone form to find that Hermione was on her knees beside him, concern clear on her face.
His companion ignored him and pawed at Draco's prone figure, rolling him face down on the slabs. Blood gleamed dark and wet in the pale hair and the shorter man abruptly extinguished the ball of light, his voice wavering.
For someone who'd faced down a Dark Lord, he seemed uncharacteristically rattled, his fingers picking at a frayed thread on his hoodie and his gaze shuttling between Weasley, the warehouse and Draco.
He supposed Malfoy had grown up, not just physically, early indications suggested that he'd matured mentally as well. Perhaps they both had.
"Scrolls," Potter said abruptly, running his fingers through his hair. "Let's do the records first and see if there's anyone you recognise."
Malfoy nodded. Harry was rigid, his balls clenching in anticipation as Malfoy slowly positioned himself and then lowered himself until Harry was nudging against his entrance.
Without waiting for a verbal response, he apparated them both to his bedroom and toppled Malfoy onto the bed.
"It doesn't really matter what I do or say, does it? They want to see me back in Azkaban and they'll stop at nothing to get me there."
Without any need to go into the Ministry, and with his house guest soundly asleep, Harry filled the next few hours writing up his case notes and engaging in a bout of domestic activity. He was putting the finishing touches on a casserole when Malfoy finally stirred, pulling himself upright with a grimace that he forcibly smoothed out when he realised Harry was in the room.
The vase didn't move but Malfoy hissed, sticking the wand under one arm and rubbing his hand down his leg and then examining his fingers.
It was when he was brushing his teeth that he caught sight of himself in the mirror, and was suddenly reminded of another mirror in a Hogwarts bathroom and a sectumsempra spell. He wiped his mouth with the towel, feeling nauseated. He'd been so scared of everything back then, but not half as scared as he should have been.
"You can wait here," the elderly volunteer lady told him. "He'll be in x-ray for a while and then they'll make a decision on whether or not to admit him."
The nurse flicked a light sheet over Malfoy's stomach and chest and pushed his way out through the curtain.
Malfoy's weight drove them back against the ancient wallpaper, causing a portly wizard in a portrait above them to mutter angrily and slam a door as he swept out of the frame.
Ron was visibly reluctant but demonstrated his own loyalty by acquiescing with a grumble, leaving Harry with a headache and a dilemma he really didn't know how to tackle. He poured himself a cup of bitter coffee in the Aurors' break room, thinking morosely that all things considered it would probably have been easier if he wasn't shagging a suspect he was meant to be monitoring.
Much later, when they were dressed and ready to leave the office, Malfoy pulled him in for a lingering kiss.
"It's a good start," said Harry. "We've seized enough illegal goods to lock up Romani and a few others, but we still need to prove they've been tampering with potions brewed by Crowfoot, Dangelos and Smithson."
There was a sudden rush of feet and then gloved hands descended, checking the pulse in the long line of Malfoy's throat and then lifting him away and onto a trolley. Harry trotted after them into the illusory privacy of a curtained cubicle, keeping himself out of the way and surprised to find he was a bit shaky and that Malfoy's limp vulnerability was unexpectedly upsetting, bringing back memories of sectumsempra and flooded bathrooms.
"Let it go, Ron," said Harry, his voice mild although his expression was tight as he stood up. "C'mon, we'd better get back to it."
He gave her an impulsive hug, thinking again she was the bravest woman he knew. She hugged him back fiercely, then pulled away, her next question in such a casual tone that Harry instinctively knew the answer was of the utmost importance.
Draco's arm was released, the grip moving to the back of his neck as he was forced to lean forwards awkwardly over the table. Warm thighs pressed against his buttocks and he gasped, dizzy, black spots dancing in the air between him and Potter.
"If you insist on working with the likes of a Malfoy you'll have to grow a thicker skin," said Robards mildly, with a dismissive glance in Malfoy's direction. "I don't expect any more damage to my wards because of the delicate feelings of a Death Eater."
Harry waved a hand in a vague gesture and Hermione made a little moue with her lips, no doubt recalling the ease with which he was distracted, even if she was unaware of the reason. In truth, Harry himself wasn't sure why he was so involved in Malfoy's well-being, although the thrum of magic that had gone through him when his arm was around the man was hard to dismiss.
In mute answer, Draco straightened and proffered his forearm, his heart giving an unwelcome twinge when Potter's warm fingers brushed briefly against his own as he took hold of it.
An imperious hand gesture cut him off as Robards rose and walked ponderously around the desk, closing in on Malfoy until he was mere inches away.
Draco forego his urge to say something. sarcastic, choosing to ignore them both, shoving his hands into his pockets and fixing his gaze on an ageing, homeless man in a brown coat who was settling down in the doorway of a vacant shop opposite the cafe. Nameless and lost, invisible because he'd somehow fallen through the cracks in the society in which he'd lived. It was an uncomfortable thought and far too close to home.
He tried to take a deep breath to steady himself, quite forgetting the state of his ribs, and the resultant stab of pain made him gasp and grimace before he could stop himself. Immediately Potter's hand was on his elbow and although every nerve screamed at him to pull away, Draco found himself too dizzy to move. He concentrated instead on breathing; short, shallow puffs of air.
He startled when Malfoy's thumb brushed his cheek; he blinked furiously, but only succeeding in releasing more tears.
"I knew that was you," sneered a husky voice from the shadows inside the cage. "The Malfoy whelp. I'd recognise that smell anywhere. What's this then? Working for the Ministry now are we? Wouldn't Daddy be disappointed."
There was also the fact that although all of the warehouses were wizard-owned, three of them were in muggle London and a Wizarding Warrant alone was not sufficient. Hermione had contacts in the muggle courts and police force and was particularly friendly with the squib Detective Sergeant who would be accompanying them.
The irritated man said something to Granger that was lost to the wind and pushed a sheet of paper inside his jacket. He proceeded to open up the warehouse door with a key selected from a jangling bunch. Briggs and Ranworth crowded behind him, with the muggle officer in close pursuit.
Malfoy ran a hand over his hair and scowled at him.  "A little warning next time, Potter. Don't you like travelling by Floo like a normal wizard? Is the Floo system beneath the saviour of the wizarding world?"
They landed smack in the middle of a furious fight. In front of them Weasley was trading livid-coloured curses with a white haired wizard while Potter held off a younger wizard and a tall witch with a casual grace that made it look easy, although Draco could feel the surges of power from where he stood. The bulldog patronus circled them, still trying desperately to deliver its message.
Harry realised he'd been dismissed. Even so he found it impossible to leave the room and transfigured a small table into an armchair. A drink could wait. He lowered himself wearily onto the squashy cushions and watched intently as spells flickered and flowed from the healer's wand.
"I know, but you're my best mate; you have been since we were eleven. We'll get this case sorted, Malfoy will go back to doing whatever it is that he does and we can all get back to normal."
Potter was looking directly at him as he spoke and Draco nodded reluctantly; this was the part he'd been dreading.
To his relief the medicine was dispensed without too much delay and appeared to be a broad spectrum antibiotic, an ointment for bruises and some heavy-duty painkillers. He scribbled a quick signature and rushed outside to find Malfoy waiting in a patch of shade, eyes closed and feet planted firmly on a square of patchy grass. He turned towards Harry slowly, lashes lifting to reveal eyes that appeared almost silver in the light reflected from the hospital windows. He looked ethereal, Harry thought, an exhausted fallen angel, surrounded by discarded cigarette butts and sweet wrappers.
Draco followed them out, rolling his eyes at Weasley's baffled expression when he handed the coffee and sandwich over to the shop doorway resident.
Again Potter seemed to be watching his every move. He was not alone; Weasley's eyes held an almost avaricious glint as he stared openly at Draco and it was noticeable that his hand hovered suspiciously near to his wand holster.
Draco walked quietly, keeping to the shadows, their darkness matching his mood of prevailing depression. He had sensed he was being followed at the station, picking up two faint ripples of magical energy as he stepped onto the platform. It was enough of a trace to be certain they were wizards, but weak enough that they were quickly lost in the bustling hum of humanity in the concourse.
It didn't seem as though the ex-Death Eater was going to move or speak and Harry took hold of his upper arm in a firm grip, unsure if he was offering mute support or simply preventing Malfoy from backing up into him. Even clothing could not stop the emotional transfer of fear and horror, so intense that Harry flinched as he peered around the other man.
Harry edged a little closer, unsure if Malfoy would be able to remain on his feet until the taxi arrived. The other man retreated slightly until he was holding the railings, his pale fingers a stark contrast with the black paint.
"I hope he's bloody dressed," added a voice behind them as Weasley chose that moment to round the corner.
Draco fell onto cool sheets, Potter close beside him. Immediately Potter raised himself on one elbow, turning towards Draco and draping an arm over his waist. His fingers caressed Draco's ribs, soothing and titillating at the same time.
Potter, wide-eyed and shocked. Potter, who shouldn't be in the Manor. Potter, who didn't seem to see Greyback closing in on them.
He folded the newspaper in a deliberate manner in keeping with his current staid appearance and sat forward, directing his gaze idly at the benches spaced along the path. His upright position brought into view a figure seated a couple of benches further down, previously partially obscured by a young mother and the vast, cushioned sides of her state-of-the-art stroller. Something about the man caught his eye; perhaps it was the black leather jacket, cut in a style that had often tempted Harry to part with a fair few galleons, or perhaps it was the general air of depression somehow conveyed by the man's posture, sitting forwards as he was with his elbows resting on the knees of his long jean-clad legs, hands hanging loose and the curl of smoke from a forgotten cigarette rising up past his lowered head. More likely though, it was the colour of his hair, so blond it was almost white when the sun peeked through the leaves and danced across it, seeming to set it ablaze with a silver-gold fire.
"Yeah." Harry took hold of his arm, intending to help him back to bed and was shocked at the heat pouring off the man.
"Oh Harry," interjected Hermione. "No wonder you're so exhausted. Come on, sit down. Have your tea and toast and then you can get some sleep."
Oh, I don't know." Harry snapped, irritated despite his intentions. "Perhaps it's because that's what people do, help each other."
"It means something to me," he admitted quietly, squaring his shoulders and stepping forwards slowly until he was close enough that Harry could feel the unique thrum of his magic.
It was so intense that it took seconds for reality to reassert itself, for Harry to remember the Dark Lord and his snake were dead and it was over, or as over as it ever would be. Even then it was difficult to separate hallucination from fact when he was receiving a constant stream of emotion from the man in his arms. It didn't ease until he recalled that he'd first felt Malfoy's magic when their skin made direct contact. He shifted his grip experimentally from skin to fabric and felt his world snap back into focus.
They burst out of the Floo into the calm ambience of the main parlour in Grimmauld Place, the leather settees and warm lamplight a welcome relief after the stark lights of the detention block. Harsh, white lighting had been a modernisation approved by Robards himself, on the grounds the old-style candlelit lamps were reassuring to the average wizarding criminal, who most likely had that sort of lighting at home.
"You are here for one reason and one reason only; Potter here has given his word that you can assist with the investigation. But make no mistake - one foot wrong... Do you understand me?"
He followed the woman to the reception window, thankful Malfoy had told him his muggle identity was in his own name. He answered the other questions as well as he could with his limited knowledge of the facts, and confirmed he was a friend and was prepared to stay. Then finally he was free to return to the cubicle.
Hermione's hand restrained him, the grip of her delicate fingers combining with the power of her urgent explanations to erode the rage that burned in him. It was a long time since Harry had felt so angry, so betrayed and so very disappointed.
"Look Potter, it's alright. I'm very grateful for all you've done, giving me a place to rest and everything. But I can't just lie around forever and you have things to do, Auror business and all that, so I'll just call myself a cab..."
He was feeling a bit chilled but wasn't about to admit that to Granger, not after the whole hippogriff debacle. However it seemed Granger had her mind on other things.
The other man rubbed his forehead with quivering fingers and shrugged. Harry caught a brief glimpse of grey eyes before he lowered his face to his knees.
At first he'd made the obvious assumption that Potter was regretting their intimacy had gone as far as it had. Bearing in mind their past history, that would be no real surprise. It was remarkable they'd even been able to occupy the same space in a civil manner for any length of time.
Everything had changed and yet nothing had changed. Harry was still Harry and Malfoy was still Malfoy, with all their associated history, but the ground rules had shifted in subtle ways.
"Someone who was camped out at the Manor in the War recognised my smell, made a few comments, started casting hexes. I defended myself, but it got a bit out of hand."
"I'm going to make a pot of tea," said Potter, sounding rather strangled. "I'll, er, bring you a cup."
It was an unpleasant thought that ex-students from Hogwarts might be guilty of illegal potion sales, although of course some had been involved in far worse.
"It's okay." Draco pressed a kiss to his forehead, just below his scar. "Really, it's alright. I'm alright."
Concerned, Harry reached up, rubbing soothing patterns with his thumbs along the bunched muscles of Malfoy's thighs, up over his hips. Keeping eye contact, he slowly sucked the fingers of one hand into his mouth, wrapped them slick around Malfoy's cock and pulled gently, setting up a rhythm that milked a slow ooze of fluid that glistened as he used it to lubricate his strokes. Malfoy's breath quickened, his mouth opening a little more as he began to rock, slowly at first, the momentum building as he raised himself, sliding back down with a slight twist that sent a red flush into his cheeks. Harry pushed upwards, meeting each descent with increasing force, his hands moving involuntarily to grasp jutting hip-bones as Malfoy's head went back, throat and chest flushed, his breath audible as he slammed himself down to meet Harry's thrusts. Just looking at him was enough to send Harry over the edge.
The warmth of the shoulder slap and grin Potter directed at his best friend pulled unexpectedly at Draco's emotions, bringing a slow trickle of regret for what might have been if his life had been different, mixed with a hint of jealousy and a hefty dose of resignation. He sighed and raised a laconic eyebrow.
It was Weasley, puzzlement in his voice and an odd look on his face and immediately Potter stepped away and strode off into the warehouse, his cheeks now flaming.
Harry gritted his teeth, thinking The Daily Prophet would have a field day if he was finished by a magical tornado created by Draco Malfoy; he didn't think Malfoy would have much chance of surviving the incident, regardless of whether or not he survived the tornado. He gathered his reserves with determination and threw everything he had at the funnel. It staggered in mid-air, slowed, and finally began to sink, until it reformed as a harmless, burnt-orange chair.
"No. He handed in the box of stuff late last night and went off home. I was flicking through this morning and there it was."
Draco's breath hitched and he bit down hard on the inside of his cheek, trying to get back some semblance of control. Potter didn't move, giving him time, not saying anything, just standing there, solid and safe.
The precise nature of Malfoy's diction left Harry in no doubt that the man was severely rattled. He reached out and stroked a tentative finger over the cool wrist next to his own, shocked by the depth of emotion that surged through the brief contact - nostalgia, loss, distress.
"No. Well...maybe. It's not as though it would be the first time." Granger's frown pinched as she regarded Draco's expression. "I'll make sure he knows what really happened," she said quickly, then added in a different tone, "Are you hurt?"
When Draco opened his eyes his first impression was that it was morning...at last. He took a slow breath of the cool, damp air, feeling the grate of his ribs and finding the taste of blood in his exhalation.
That was true enough, although Harry wondered if the spots had grown freely on the youthful Malfoy or were cultivated by his parents and upbringing. Only time would tell.
"Rude. Be throwing poor gnomes around next like scarhead." The gnome hurled a clod of earth at him, took the hand of a sprout coloured gnome child and stamped off.
Draco shivered and pulled his jacket closer around himself, eyeing the insidious creep of dark clouds across the uncomfortable looking grey sky with a feeling of foreboding. He hoped it wasn't an omen.
"You're gorgeous," he blurted awkwardly and then they were on the floor, the woven rug coarse under his back and a desperate and vulnerable set to Malfoy's features that made Harry's chest constrict with the urge to protect him, even as his cock jerked against the heat of the man's thigh.
Malfoy shuddered, withdrawing his hands from Harry's arms and rubbing them down the sides of his trousers in a nervous gesture.
"I need some air," said Malfoy sharply, turning on his heel and walking unsteadily towards the main entrance doors.
They lay and gasped, their breath loud in the empty gym. Eventually Draco raised his head from his forearm and flexed his cracked knuckles before wiping a hand gingerly over his face. Potter regarded him from a few inches away, slowly thumbing the bloody streak from beneath his nose.
Just before Draco fell back into the darkness of delirium, he heard Potter's voice. It sounded despairing, but the words were lost in the sibilant tones of the Dark Lord.
Harry swallowed convulsively, heat scorching his own spine as he felt Malfoy's testicles draw up; he gave a final series of spasmodic thrusts and came in back-arching streams into Harry's throat, blond head thrown back and moaning helplessly. Still swallowing, Harry orgasmed violently, completely untouched.
Harry just held him, horribly conscious of the injured ribs and oddly aware of the firm, lithe body flush against his own.
"No," said Harry around a huge lump in his throat. "I don't trust you. I want to. I really want to. But I don't."
He wasn't sure what happened next, but suddenly he was on the opposite side of the room and Hermione was in the kitchen, her hair escaping from a tidy bun and her hands reaching up to an angry-looking Weasley's shoulders as she spoke rapidly and earnestly.
It was actually rather odd, thought Harry, to have the opportunity to really look at his schoolboy nemesis without a haze of sarcasm, anger and mistrust lying between them. He ran an idle thumb slowly over the fine, golden hairs on Malfoy's wrist and then curled his fingers around the lax hand again with a vague intention of giving the man something to hold onto.
In the meantime the man appeared to be asleep, the golden curve of his lashes resting on unnaturally flushed cheekbones. Harry laid a tentative hand on his forehead, finding it hot and dry, his immediate concern mingling with surprise at the tingle of magic that prickled under the pads of his fingers. It reminded him of Hogwarts and the unexpectedly sharp sting of Malfoy's hexes. He pulled his hand away quickly and rubbed it down the side of his trousers with a frown. Nothing had ever been simple as far as Malfoy was concerned.
"Gryffindors really are stubborn, aren't they? I'm not going to stand here making a fool of myself. Looks as though the Ministry won after all."
Hoping his wandless magic was precise enough, Draco threw a "Protego" over Granger to buy her time while her wand unlocked. He turned back to see Weasley was now down on one knee as he cast a swift binding spell over the white haired figure before him.
Draco wanted to stand up and storm out with a cutting reply, but he really had no choice but to stay. He bit the inside of his cheek bloody and kept his gaze fixed on Weasley until he flushed and turned away. It was a small victory of sorts, but on top of everything else it left him feeling drained and depressed. Not for the first time he wondered if the deal had been worth it. If he'd declined, by now he'd be dead and all the shit would be over.
Draco eased himself onto one of the upright wooden chairs, thinking that the growing headache in his temples was probably there to stay. He concentrated on stirring a spoon of sugar into his tea until he couldn't put the question off any longer.
Malfoy's tone was sharp, his face paler than normal in the weak sunlight that filtered in through the small window.
He fielded a few questions from the two aurors and then strolled over to Potter, who spared him a quick and thoughtful look before ushering them all into the lift. Minutes later they whirled into an unexpectedly fresh breeze at the apparition point not far from Tower Bridge.
When he woke the next morning, that warm ache had been replaced by an uncomfortable knot of fear in his gut and the weight of Malfoy's arm slung casually across his chest. Harry turned carefully onto his side, splayed a gentle hand over the lean waist beside him and just concentrated on breathing steadily, trying to control the feeling spiralling inside him.
The taller of the two men took the steps in a hurry, the faint light emitted from the end of his wand showing Draco's crumpled figure.
"I know." Ron sighed, resigned. "Probably best if I keep my distance though. But if you need me, I'm here."
"I don't want to see you there," answered Harry firmly. "So why don't you just answer the question and maybe I can help. Why give me his name if you were buying from Romani?"
Malfoy shot him a look that suggested he was seriously considering a stinging hex or something of that nature and Harry shifted his position slightly, hand ready to throw out a
First Malfoy was reprimanded briefly, which made an unrepentant expression that was pure Lucius appear on his face.
"And what happens if we don't catch them? I can't see that doing the Minister's popularity much good. And the public will probably blame Malfoy."
Shaking with anxiety, Harry apparated back to Grimmauld Place and flooed to the Ministry. He stormed towards his office with such a scowl on his face that no-one spoke to him and a nervous-looking witch in the lift actually tucked herself into one corner and pretended to be reading The Daily Prophet, even though she was holding it upside down.
He really didn't care if Potter took him to Grimmauld Place. He could vaguely remember the place from a visit or two when he was a small child and, whoever owned it now, it was a Black family property and he was as much a Black as a Malfoy. The one place he didn't want Potter to take him was his own flat, not because he didn't want Potter to know where he lived, but because he simply didn't feel safe there any more. To be brutally honest, he didn't feel safe anywhere and frankly being in the vicinity of the wizarding world's hero was probably his best bet.
"But I thought he'd done it!" His voice rose. "I'm just like everyone else, aren't I? I thought he'd cursed me because he's Malfoy. Because of his name, not because of who he is now." He rounded on her, almost shouting. "And he's changed. I know he's changed."
"It's okay," said Potter. "The house knows it can't use magic to directly assist you." He tilted his head, eyebrows raised in surprised amusement. "It knows who you are. It's happy you're here."
Potter's pupils were huge and dark and his gaze was fixed on Draco's face as the tip of his tongue came out and dragged slowly across his bottom lip.
"Wait." Harry snared his wrist, wrapped his fingers around it. "Don't go." He raised the wrist and kissed Malfoy's knuckles. "Upstairs. Please."
He poked his victim none too gently with the toe of his shoe and added in a venemous tone, "And now you pay!"
Draco came to a halt halfway up the staircase, remembering belatedly that he needed to breathe. His knuckles gleamed white against the dark wood of the bannister as his mind raced. So what if Potter had saved him? Potter was a natural saviour. And so what if Potter fancied him, wanted to shag him? He no doubt saw the same pretty boy others had. He was admittedly more polite about it, because after all it was Potter, but it didn't mean Draco was anything but a quick shag, the scratching of an itch that had started years before.
After a rapid check to see the coast was clear, Malfoy slipped into the alley alongside Harry and waited, fingers tapping restlessly against his leg as the concealment charm was reinstated.
Something wet and cool slid between the cheeks of his arse and Potter's fingers followed, stroking, teasing. Then the heat of his body was gone as he dropped to his knees, hands pulling apart Draco's cheeks and his tongue wet and warm, licking, dipping inside.
Sorry the updates are a little slow but work demands are pretty much 24/7 at the moment so I just have to chip away at the story sentence by sentence.
Snape eyed him haughtily. "The Ministry is filled with incompetent buffoons. You, however, are neither incompetent nor a buffoon. Remember your training, Draco."
Malfoy's voice was strained and muffled and he made no attempt to move from a position that must have been excruciatingly uncomfortable for him.
He didn't expect the ex-Death Eater to ask for help, so it was a surprise a couple of hours later when he heard his name. He took the stairs two at a time and found Malfoy in the doorway of his bedroom, clinging onto the door frame as violent shudders shook him from head to toe.
The other man went completely still, the kitchen so quiet Harry felt as though he'd gone deaf. He waited for the snide comment that never came. Instead Malfoy blinked and swallowed and lowered his head as he shoved his hands into his pockets.
Potter made a bee-line to the archway on the far side of the main office and followed a curving corridor until he reached a mahogany door that declared 'H Potter' and 'R Weasley' in curling brass letters.
Whatever it was, Potter clearly wasn't going to repeat it, although the firm pressure of his knee remained. After a moment, Draco excused himself and fled to the safety of the basic toilet until the warm heat in his cheeks subsided.
Harry studied him, reading real fear beneath his haughty facade. It was that fear that made him speak the truth.
Draco lowered his head slowly, Potter's lips coming up to meet his own, unexpectedly gentle and hesitant. Magic flickered; the warm, slightly salty taste of Potter's mouth tingling on his tongue. They moved their mouths slowly, opening up to each other, tongues sliding together as the kiss became deeper and more intense.
When Malfoy appeared in the kitchen, somehow looking sleek and groomed even in Harry's tatty joggers and faded t-shirt, it was fortunate his gaze went first to the pan boiling on the range, because Harry physically flinched at the pain behind the other man's sophisticated mask. That's all it was, he realised, an elaborately crafted camouflage that he'd previously been unable to penetrate and of which he had not even been aware.
Malfoy shook his head slightly, his eyes grey as storm clouds as they met Harry's for a brief moment, then slid away as though he'd lost interest in the sorry proceedings.
"These are Black family heirlooms," noted Malfoy, lifting up an intricately patterned bowl for closer inspection.  "You're not actually planning to eat off them, are you?"
Within seconds Madam Pomfrey had whisked Malfoy out of the room and onto a hastily configured operating table. By the time Harry had followed on rather stiff and shaky legs, the air over Malfoy was thick with diagnostic spells and Madam Pomfrey's face had turned a shade paler.
Robards must have read his body language because he straightened with alarm and rushed to offer the use of his private Floo.
Potter pushed in then, deep and slow, until his thighs were shaking tight against Draco's arse. He leaned forwards, chest firm against Draco's back as he sunk his teeth into the back of Draco's neck and flexed his hips, once, twice, then pulled almost all the way out, teeth slipping from Draco's skin as he withdrew.
"I can't be sure of course, not yet, but there are two on the list. Both are purebloods whose families were known supporters of the Dark Lord. And let's face it, Potter, legal employment hasn't exactly been an easy prospect for the likes of us, has it?"
Draco waved a hand in a dismissive fashion, privately reminding himself that antagonising Potter wasn't the best idea, especially as the man was so disgusted by him.
They arrived in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place with a tremendous crack. Malfoy staggered a few steps away as he was released, shock on his face.
The long, elegant corridor of Malfoy Manor faded away and Draco found himself staring over Potter's shoulder at the landing in Grimmauld Place, the top of the steep staircase a mere step away. He stood, shaking, his chin hard against Potter's collarbone and the thumping of the other man's heart knocking against his ribs.
Snape withdrew a scroll of parchment from his robes. He pointed towards a blank roll on McGonagall's desk.
"I've made a list of the bars and restaurants, muggle and wizarding, where pure-blood visitors from overseas like to hang out. Some of them are for members only of course."  He kept his voice cool and impersonal as he unrolled the scroll and pointed to the bottom of the list. "You'll no doubt be familiar with these haunts."
"They're dealing with dangerous stuff. There's been a couple of kids killed. If you could help stop that..."
He wanted to say that he was fine, but the growing waves of heat and bouts of shivering were becoming impossible to hide. He nodded and slid a little lower in the chair, as much as his ribs would allow, and let his eyes slip closed.
Harry's gaze lingered on the other man's face, taking in the stronger bones and light stubble of the adult Malfoy. It was, he supposed, an attractive face, something he'd failed to notice at Hogwarts, although a fair proportion of other students had carried a flame for the young pureblood. Perhaps it was the Slytherin's eyes that had made him so fascinating, the way they seemed to change colour with his mood and the light.
Harry caught him as he sagged, pulling him clear of the mess and receiving a rolling wave of confusion through the palms of his hands that hit his magical core with such strength it made him momentarily dizzy.
"The request coming from you, that'll make a difference. I suspect the Ministry will want some sort of arrangement to sweeten the deal though."
To say Draco retreated in haste would be an understatement. For someone who'd spent his life behind a false front since his formulative years, to be suddenly so exposed was a deeply unnerving experience.
Malfoy, who had nightmares about Greyback, who had recently suffered some trauma that he'd not disclosed. The connection was flooded by Harry's shame and guilt as he pulled back.
He manoeuvred the ex-Slytherin onto the bed, hoping the bedding wasn't too damp as the room hadn't been used since the days of the Order of the Phoenix. Malfoy moaned, rolling onto his side and curling into himself as much as his injured ribs allowed as he began to shiver.
It made Draco feel sick to his stomach. How had he let himself be so needy, so vulnerable? He'd even broken down in front of Potter, who was so decent that he probably now felt sorry for Draco because he was so weak.
That established, the man seemed to relax and wandered into the bedroom, hands stuffed in his pockets.
Draco nodded, a bit breathless from the impact. He had no idea what the curse had been but its effects seemed to be minor, thanks to Granger's intervention.
"I'll look into it immediately," promised Madam Pomfrey. "I believe you have a copy of some of the more obscure medical texts, Miss Granger?"
Harry's Auror training countered that teenage Malfoy had been able to put on an impressive false front both at Hogwarts and at Malfoy Manor when he was dealing with Merlin knows what; there was no reason to believe adult Malfoy was any less proficient at deception.
Unfortunately, as Weasley was clearly anticipating entertainment of the Draco-bashing variety, there was something more, which meant it must be something to do with the case.
Woefully deciding that a feeble pretense at sleep would be ill-mannered, bearing in mind Potter's efforts over the previous few days, Draco sighed.
The pain came then; it seemed to be everywhere, compromising his ability to breathe properly, to move, to think. He made it up onto his hands and knees, then to his feet by sheer force of will. Dizzy, sick, confused by the tangle of jeans around his knees. He pulled them up, thinking one of his fingers seemed to be broken, not choosing to think about anything else, because if he did he would tip over into the bottomless pit of fear and horror that lay before him.
Malfoy pulled off, looking at him with a considering gaze as the air settled icily around the places where his warm mouth had been. His lips were wet and shiny and Harry made an embarrassing mewling sound at the sight, unable to stop the instinctive rise of his hips.
Draco trailed after them, stepping through a flutter of premature fallen leaves, the first he'd seen that season. Autumn was coming, the summer months lost in a blur of anxiety and fear and the winter now not far ahead. The year was spiralling down, he thought, rather like his life.
"We...the Auror department that is, are investigating a potion smuggling ring. We thought you might know something."
He watched as Malfoy hauled himself up from the table, feeling the now familiar squirm of discomfort when he realised how exhausted the other man looked.
"You sound surprised. It's no secret that I have no love for The Ministry but if you hadn't noticed, Potter, I'm dead. It has a way of clearing the mind. And Draco is...family to me. I hope you will bear that in mind in your future dealings with him."
"He saw what he expected to," replied Draco, somehow managing to keep his tone and face devoid of expression.
He pushed his own jeans clear and jerked Malfoy's down as he obligingly raised his hips, then thrust his cock against the heat of Malfoy's. They frotted urgently, tongues deep in each others mouths, their hips moving in an ancient rhythm that quickened as their magic twisted and curled around them. The feeling was almost too intense and Malfoy's thighs fell apart, his nipples hard knubs beneath Harry's thumb as Harry raised up, altering the angle of his hips so that his cock dragged up and down from the back of Malfoy's testicles as far as his entrance, skating over the furled entrance with increasing force.
On top of it all he was still attracted to Potter, attracted enough that the memory of their bodies grinding together made his stomach clench. If Potter was in front of him right now...
Draco leaned against the shower door in as nonchalant a manner as he could manage. After all, he had nothing to be embarrassed about, it was only Potter and it wasn't as though they hadn't seen each other naked before in the communal Quidditch showers. Behind him the shower head sputtered into silence, dribbling a last few ice-cold drips down his back. He shivered involuntarily, feeling his nipples tighten. Not the casual effect he'd been after.
"No," said Harry a little abruptly. "But there's no guarantee relatives have your best interests at heart."
Harry frowned, studying his subject with an objective eye. Malfoy was...softer than he'd thought, with his tousled silver-gold hair and long eyelashes; more athletic than he remembered, with lean muscle on his long frame; far more damaged than he'd shown; as intriguing but less annoying than the schoolboy he'd been.
Fuck! It's no use, Potter." Humiliation painted Malfoy's cheeks red. "My magic isn't there anymore, you can see that!"
Potter regarded him for a moment longer, the red stain on his cheekbones making his eyes seem greener than ever. He'd grown into himself, thought Draco; he was taller, broader across the shoulders, his t-shirt tight enough to show the play of muscle beneath the fabric. His hair was more styled but still unruly and the short beard suited him, defining his features and balancing the effect of the thick, dark eyebrows. Belatedly Draco became aware that he was staring and he looked away quickly.
As he spoke the nurse stepped away from the bed and Malfoy's body was no longer obscured. Harry caught his breath in shock. The other man's torso was a mass of weals and bruises, the clear imprint of a boot sole easily distinguishable. Despite his auror training it made him feel physically sick; how Malfoy had remained upright so long was a mystery.
Despite its physical beauty, that pale hair caused a cold shiver to run down Harry's spine, bringing to mind the smooth slide of Lucius Malfoy's blond mane against his cloak, and the slicked back shine of the younger Malfoy's head on that very first day at Hogwarts. "You don't want to be making friends with the wrong sort." Those words had been the start of years of enmity that sputtered out in a molten puddle of confusion and fear around about the time of the fiendfyre.
"You were asleep," he added suddenly. "I woke up and you were there...and, and I knew it was over. You were the last thing I saw."
He wasn't sure how long he stayed there, the auror in him piecing together some theories about the sort of attack that would leave that type of injuries. There was no doubt it had been vicious in its ferocity.  Eventually a small sound alerted him to the fact that the other man was regaining consciousness. Malfoy raised a hand, his fingers scrabbling at the oxygen mask fixed to his face.
"Sorry." Draco muttered. "You...I'm sorry; I know you don't want...this, with someone like me, with me."
Potter pulled out one of the chairs with a grating noise. "Food is great," he promised them, tugging the laminated plastic menu out of its holder.
When Potter shut the front door on the world, the cool silence of 12 Grimmauld Place settled around them. The innate magic of the house reached out with silken fingers to caress Draco's skin, transmitting a distinct feeling of pleasure at his presence. Draco flinched, half expecting aurors to appear to whisk him away to Azkaban.
"Well, perhaps it's time you had a chat? Surely he'll see sense, if it means the terms of his probation are improved?"
"Look," he snapped defensively. "Things got all turned around in sixth year and I know you didn't hand me over to Voldemort when you could've done, but it's hard to just dismiss all the things you did before that!"
"You don't have enough Slytherins in the Auror department; are there any Slytherins at all on the investigation?"
That left Harry alone with a fully grown man who was convinced he was back in Malfoy Manor and who was genuinely terrified of the Dark Lord and his commanders stalking the halls. And if containing the unexpected strength in those lean limbs wasn't enough, the transference of emotion every time Harry touched bare skin was overwhelming. It was going to be a long night.
Then they were in the corridor and pushing against a tide of wide-eyed and whispering school children who were changing from one lesson to another. Draco kept his eyes on the floor, allowed himself to be steered by Potter until they burst into the silence of an empty room.
"No need. Please repay me by taking all the time and help you need for a full recovery. And remember, my door is always open."
The voice was insistent, familiar, loved. A stab of grief penetrated the darkness, reminding him that his mother was dead, gone. He fought his way awake then, sure he had heard her voice, desperate to see if she was there, the only person who had loved him without reservation.
Malfoy's voice was shaking, his lips red and irresistible. Harry ran a thumb over them, his other hand sliding across the heat in Malfoy's crotch.
It was the truth anyway; Malfoy looked as though he was about to faint and the day was warm, muggy; if the man was cold he was probably in some sort of shock.
"Well I did. I'm sorry, Hermione. I'll apologise to everyone in the morning. Get away from him, Ron."
"What are we supposed to do with these? There must be an Auror disposal detail surely? Whatever is the Ministry coming to?"
Potter seemed to read the change, or perhaps some inkling of it was transmitted between their skin. Whatever the reason, his movements became more focussed, his hand closing around Draco as his teeth caught at his throat. Then a firm hand had turned him onto his side, fingers spreading across the flat muscles of Draco's stomach and pulling him back against Potter's body. Potter was erect again, hard flesh sliding in the slick of Draco's crack and Draco pushed his hips back, raising one thigh, feeling the blunt end of Potter's cock rubbing tantalisingly over his entrance before pushing back inside.
"If I can't come to your place, then I s'pose you'll just have to stay with me for a few days. I'll tell the house not to offer you any magical assistance."
Potter took hold of Draco's arm in a bruising grip, spun him around and threw both arms around him, effectively pinning him to his chest and stopping his headlong flight.
"We had breakfast in the same room for years," he noted, not wanting to think about the fact that he must've watched Malfoy pretty intently to know how he preferred his tea.
Despite his own racing heart and flooding adrenaline, Harry tried to give comfort where he could, wrapping Malfoy's shuddering body in blankets, applying wet cloths when his skin burned hot and dry, talking about anything and everything to try and ground him in the present, but Harry's own self-control eroded dangerously in the face of exhaustion and the re-emergence of buried traumas of his own.
For a few seconds there was silence, then the sound of sniffing and a flurry of movement. The light was cut off as a large figure loomed at the end of the bookcase. Fenrir Greyback. Draco crammed himself as far back into the recess as possible, shoes scrabbling on the boards, but it was no use. A clawed hand closed around his ankle and hauled him, kicking and struggling, into the light.
They sipped in silence and by the time the mugs of tea and half the packet of biscuits had gone it was apparent that Malfoy was struggling to stay awake.
Nothing but the hum of traffic and the cool night air chill upon his skin. He raised himself enough to look around but there was no-one there, just the dark shadows behind the stone pillars where he lay. He remembered trying to reach them, then...nothing.
Funnily enough, even the embarrassment was worth the way Malfoy's lips curled up. Harry resolved right there and then to make him smile more often. Bad choices in his past or not, spending a night in the man's nightmares had made him reconsider some of his own assumptions.
"Fuck," whispered Harry, their breath mingling and something unfurling inside him that caused him to stroke back Malfoy's damp hair in a tender gesture.
Shortly afterwards a doctor arrived and Harry was politely but firmly sent to wait on a chair in the corridor. Although he could hear the low murmur of voices through the curtain he couldn't distinguish what was said, although once Malfoy's voice rose in a sharp denial. A nurse left and then returned with a small box tucked under her arm. A few minutes later she was gone and then the doctor emerged; he paused with one hand on the curtain, looking back over his shoulder.
After a moment he shifted the hand upwards and gently moved a few strands of hair away from Draco's heated forehead. His green eyes were intense, full of unspoken questions. Draco imagined they would be along the lines of "What was that?", "Why didn't you?" and maybe even "Why now?" Thankfully he didn't say anything and Draco was able to catch his breath, although Potter's meandering fingers did nothing to slow the pounding of his heart or lessen the throbbing in his groin.
Thirty minutes later they were back in Harry's office. He shut the door securely and turned to Malfoy.
That thought was disquieting, particularly when he ran his gaze over the other man again. He certainly wasn't ugly. But, you know, it was still Malfoy!
"It's true; he used the cruciatus curse on me. But he did it under duress, Harry, and his heart wasn't in it."
It was as well he did, for the Auror detail chose that moment to arrive and Potter was close on their heels and his face was white and angry. Granger pulled him aside, speaking urgently, but Draco didn't wait around.
To his alarm, Draco picked up a surge of sorrow and suspicion despite the thickness of the leather. Something had changed dramatically he thought, the moment of realisation fractured by the sharp snap of apparition.
"I can't..." Malfoy yelled over the shriek of the wind, his hair blowing around his white face as he stumbled backwards into the wall.
Potter was as skittish as a nervous thestral, his emotions clearly strung tight now the heat of his so very Gryffindor declaration of the previous evening had cooled.
It had been four days since Harry had seen Malfoy in Regent's Park; four days with no sign of any illegal potions traders, with no sign of any known persons of bad character. With every hour that passed the likelihood that their contact had been Malfoy had become more likely.
"Professor Snape," said Potter calmly. He met the dark gaze steadily, walking to stand behind Draco where he laid a hand on his shoulder. A ripple of magic passed between them, warming Draco when he hadn't even realised that he was cold.
"Still saving me, Potter." Malfoy noted wearily. "No. We're here now. I might as well call in at The Hag's Skeleton."
Malfoy made a small noise of disagreement, but did lean forwards to rest his elbows on his knees. He looked as though he might vomit.
He burst into damp mist and chill mountain air just outside the Hogwarts' grounds and raised his eyes to the castle. It loomed above him, stirring emotions despite his current apathy. Those stone walls had borne witness to his childish, blind pride, his hopes and dreams, his betrayal, his overwhelming terror. At times it had been the safest place he knew, at others the most dangerous.
It feels like Harry should have known better than to take anything Draco said at face value, like he should have heard what Draco
Granger either doesn’t notice or doesn’t acknowledge it, which is disappointing but not surprising. Gryffindors, as Draco is painfully aware, don’t appreciate theatricals in anyone but one of their own.
The silence stretches out, growing long and ominous and distancing them further. Draco doesn’t like it. He doesn’t like what their faces are doing, or what their brains are thinking; he doesn’t like what
. He tries to take as little as possible, to not look down at what he is eating, but they are far off concerns. Nothing is as important as defying Potter.
for help, forced to bite their tongue and agree to even the most absurd of his demands. It’s the kind of vindication you can get drunk on, sweet on your tongue and sharp in your mind, laughing with possibilities unlimited.
Potter is still glaring at him, but Draco won’t budge on this one. He takes what he does very seriously; he is a civilised person whose mother insisted on teaching him manners—even though Draco did his best to resist her lessons, back in his rebellious toddler phase—and Draco is well aware that there is a proper way to do things. A person's life story is a delicate thing, not something to be ripped out over the counter of a store, lovely as the store might be. Potter, bless his socially-inept soul, stares at him, completely dumbfounded.
“Given the state it was in, I sincerely doubt you cared much about the couch.” A guess, based on values Draco doesn't think Potter holds. He should have realised sooner. Something flashes over Potter’s face, quick and dangerous, and because Draco is a moron with no self-preservation he doesn't do the reasonable thing — shut up and hope to be spared — but he talks on and makes the situation worse. “It would also have been
There are speeches to plan (and Merlin forbid, Harry’s burned at least three drafts of Ron’s best man speech), guest lists to debate (Harry managed to talk Draco down a few hundred, but he wanted the reception, at least, to be grand — something the gossip magazines he still denies he reads will talk about for months to come), and flowers to arrange (Lucius first criticised their every idea and then finally took the whole thing over, and Harry is slightly worried what is awaiting them tomorrow, but he knew better than to refuse) — the work never seemed to stop.
Of course, now Harry has to find something equally horrible to share to haunt Ron's thoughts, keeping an equilibrium here is important. Ron has a point, though, and he is still laughing, and Harry still feels warm and can breathe easier for it, the weight of his conscience not as pressing on his friend’s happiness, and then Harry is laughing, too.
, that he found no pleasure in smashing their mouths and tongues together because he doesn’t understand these things. Draco wanted the kiss to be
Potter clenches his jaw, nods like he has to reassure them both, his hands cramped around the armchair. He doesn’t look properly appreciative of the fact that he has
Ron, smug and fearless, drinks again. No choking this time, which only makes him look more smug. Harry sticks his tongue out at him, because he is mature like that. Ron laughs and cuts a grimace right back, because he has six siblings and knows the drill, and because, out of the three of them, Hermione is the only one who could pass as mature and responsible. Well, Harry refuses to let Ron win. The game is on, there are more important things than composure.
, who is practically infamous for needing only five minutes to convince Draco to spit out whatever it is others have been pestering him about for hours. Okay, that’s not true — Theo does need longer than that, and he picks his battles wisely, but it’s still rather more impressive than Millicent, who simply resorts to throwing things at Draco. It never got him to talk, but in recent years, that has become more of an excuse to be rude, anyway.
Right, Potter has the hiccups. They are said to be one of the oldest curses of humanity, surpassed in cruelty only by the one that makes people stub their toe on every occasion that presents itself, granting respite every now and then to allow for a moment of hope. Draco thought that very dramatic, overly ridiculous and sure to be nothing compared to some of the foul stuff out there, but he understands now.
It’s for his own good though, Harry reassures himself. Better remind Ron of the facts before he gives his heart to Parkinson, who is just going to chew it out and spit it onto his shoes, laughing into his face.
“I’m rather certain I already did. I’ll be very offended if you say you don’t remember.” Draco almost yawns against Harry’s neck, which would undermine the promised fury significantly, and Draco is grateful he manages to stifle it before Harry notices.
It gets rid of the wolves, though, so Draco leans into it, doesn’t question his strength as he wipes wolves away like they are nothing. He rages and trashes until there are no more wolves, no more sounds, no growling as they approach and no whining as they are hit. Nothing but his breathing, loud and bigger than it should be, hanging in clouds in the cold air, snow falling pleasantly around him like nothing happened, burying the wolves and closing their eyes.
It takes him a staunch minute to realise that everyone is staring at him. Granted, Harry is used to being stared at, by friends and strangers alike, but this is the kind of stare that means they all know something he doesn’t, something he
lead him to Potter. Draco starts walking and he determinedly doesn’t look at the footsteps he leaves, visible for only a moment despite how deep they are, because if Potter gave him paws Draco doesn’t want to know, temporary perception or not.
“I should just say that I did my best and shrug it off?” That doesn’t feel right, even if Harry could internalise it as the truth it probably is. They can’t just keep silent on it and pretend things are fine, can they? That’s not a marriage Harry wants to lead, if he even still has one.
p.s.: Cassiopeia is a living creature, she would deserve a name even if she wasn’t a fixture in your life.
. It wouldn’t have led anywhere, of course, what with their feud and all, but still. Things could have been so different.
The costume, however, must be the most Gryffindor thing Draco could ever have imagined to find, a garish red and clinging to him like a second skin, showing off muscle in a way that would make him look even more impressive when he does bother to fight. It does very little for him hanging in chains of electricity, more mocking than anything else.
After that there is only their marriage and the consummation, the horrible kiss and Potter’s flawless reasoning that certain things are 'simply expected to happen' in marital beds. And against walls, apparently, which Draco doubts but doesn’t know how to openly question. There is Potter on him whenever he feels like it and Draco having to remember every time not to flinch, to let Potter do whatever it is he wants and to go with it, because this way it will be over quickest.
“For the furniture, of course! I got up early to supervise the delivery — you have to be really careful with those, once we had arranged for Hesper Black’s mirror to be delivered to the Manor and these brutes let it fall and broke the beautiful glass all over our main stairs in the east wing. Hesper haunted us for two years, because he spent enough time in front of that mirror for pieces of his soul to become attached and he didn’t take kindly to —” Malfoy shows no sign of stopping, gaining speed and losing himself in the intricacies of his story.
“You know, Potter, your hospitality is tragically lacking. I expected your weasel family to teach you better.” Draco watches Potter’s face closely, searches for every tiny twitch and frown.
Draco can see it clear as day, Potter going from moaning to laughter, tracing seductive fingers and sliding off as he is jolted by a hiccup. Potter would look glorious, flushed and naked and happy, laughing even as he is breathless.
Furious, Harry jumps out of bed and grabs his glasses (tapping through the house blind like a mole will do him no favours), cursing at the house when his feet land on the cold floor and then he marches out of his room. He refuses to be treated like this any longer. Grimmauld wants him to freeze his arse off? Fine, but Harry will make damn sure that Malfoy won’t get free passes anymore.
“What about now, can we go out now?” Even Draco is annoyed by his incessant asking, but he firmly believes that Potter needs fresh air. They spent the entire day inside, cooped up in Potter’s affront of a kitchen—seriously, Draco will have to sneak his friends in here when Potter is playing games with Longbottom and they need to do some serious work—and Draco has forgotten what life without a headache of bad air and sadness feels like.
It looks like Cupid threw up in here and Draco is grateful for the dimmed lightning. Candles are flickering ominously, casting a warm light onto the elegantly set table and the roses (Potter got him
Harry remembers Draco reaching out to him anyway, hugging him and seeking skin contact like he was starving for it after sex. He remembers Grimmauld purring around them, then, when Draco finally got the contact he needed but couldn’t ask for.
Friends are supposed to lift you up, to support you and make you smile and make this life bearable. Draco is pretty sure that’s their purpose. He must have picked the wrong friends, friends who couldn’t be bothered to look up the definition and instead invented their own.
place not seconds ago, his little sanctuary with Blaise still lingering and his words the loudest thing in Draco’s mind. Now it’s
Potter is watching them like a vulture, a king imperiously observing his servants go about their day of facilitating his life, and if looks could kill Draco has no doubt they would all be dead already. Or in a mysterious coma in the very least, what with the way Potter glowers down on them from his makeshift throne on the kitchen table, clutching his coffee and gulping it down like his life depends on it. Perhaps the caffeine will help with the deadly qualities of his glare? Draco is almost tempted to ask him, if only to make Potter scowl and — hopefully — give him the last push to leave so Draco can oversee and direct with all the focus the task requires (these people are barely more than glorified animals, if Draco doesn’t pay attention he will end up with his clothes in the kitchen and his books in the bathroom, no independent thought to be found in their thick skulls).
doing things, especially not against himself. Draco is not a fighter, it’s true, but, for Harry, he just might be.
Yes, that sounds better. Draco will stay here, try not to throw up on the plant he got for Potter—because then he’d have to go back to the flower shop and explain to the lovely woman fond of laughing at him what happened to the first plant—and wait until the world stops swaying. Draco closes his eyes and sinks deeper into his misery, intent on weathering this pain.
that likes them, of course, just as he acts like he doesn’t want the tea Draco brings. The simple fact of the matter is that Potter
“Done! What does the winner get?” Vaguely Harry is aware that he might have just signed his fate away, but competition — especially when Malfoy is involved — always sends a unique thrill through him. He has no regrets, not even when Malfoy looks as if he had already won.
Then Weasley pulls himself up into the semblance of authority, and announces: “Honoured guests, please cheer for Harry Potter.”
Draco has also no indention of hurting Harry. He will need to be better, until Harry doesn’t remember how he could ever think Draco and Dudley similar. He doesn’t want Harry to feel second rate standing next to him, he should never have been made to feel like that in the first place, and Draco will see to it that he never feels like it again.
You will have noticed that I took great care to do as you asked and stay away regardless of your conduct.
Praying the beanbag won’t give under his hand, Draco levers himself up and out of his hiding space against Harry’s neck. The ground holds firm and Harry’s hands only clench on him for a short moment before letting Draco go and then suddenly, Draco is looking into Harry’s eyes. Harry’s impossibly green eyes, wide and vulnerable and scared.
“Since you asked so nicely — Capt'n was my first toy, a stuffed dragon as blue as the sky and wings big enough to wrap myself up in. But Capt’n was lonely, and I begged my parents for friends for her. They gently tried to explain that
him; in an absent-minded way, sure, but defended, nonetheless. Harry feels warm at the thought, the reassurance that Draco cares, that he —
Draco snaps into action. He pulls Potter back by the grip he has on his shirt, throwing wards and spells to shield their retreat. He walks them back through people who don’t know Potter and hiss at Draco to pay attention, turning corners until it feels they are going in circles. Potter numbly follows, letting himself be pushed around by Draco.
work?” Draco is growing very tired of talking to Weasley. How is it that, despite coming here to save Potter from himself, Draco ends up spending most of his time trying not to wring Weasley’s neck?
“I forgot, of course you wouldn’t know Disney,” Granger gasps out between more laughter. Frankly, Draco doesn’t see how his ignorance is funny, especially
Draco almost runs into Weasley, into Granger, both of them suddenly stood still in the middle of the forest, moving on the spot with fury on their faces. Draco runs past them before he understands what is happening, before he can question why he doesn’t get caught, why he is free to move.
to happen—something falls out of the window. It looks like rope, coiled but strangely loose—hair, it’s hair.
“That’s kind of exactly the problem: I don’t want to marry some random fan who’d drool all over me when I’m trying to have a nice time with my friends.” It’s moments like this, Potter’s face twisted into a grimace of judgement, that are part of the reason Draco got past his blind infatuation and developed something approaching genuine fondness for the man. Potter can be a lot less sickeningly Gryffindor and benevolent than the papers would like him to be. “Do you think I would go to all the trouble of arranging a fake marriage to then fill up the numbers with strangers?”
With Granger and Weasley standing against the wall, Potter looks even more lost. The bed is too big for him, swallowing him up and threatening to pull him under. Who knows, perhaps it would have worked if Potter were closer to peace. As he lays struggling and hurting, there is no risk of him passing away unnoticed.
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Potter hasn’t grown any more charming since Draco left him. Pity, Draco had hoped Potter might be willing to see reason.

It’s almost a relief to hear Weasley laugh again, the sound jarring and pulling Draco out of whatever moment he shared with Potter, brief and yet endless.
Potter scoffs at him, shoulders once again tense, but he is smiling and holds Draco’s hand, answering his squeeze with one of his own. They can do this. They will be fine.
Draco sits on the floor, cross-legged and hunched over the ferret held in his arms. There is another ferret pacing on his legs (Harry is reminded of a guard dog, or perhaps a tiger, patrolling their territory) nudging Draco’s sides and knees and rubbing its little head in what appears to be comfort. The third ferret sits in front of their odd arrangement, glaring at Harry as it considers him. Harry stands up straighter on instinct, then immediately feels ridiculous for trying to please a
Harry has an uncanny talent for sneaking, tiptoeing around in silence to suddenly pop up and scare the living daylights out of Draco. Harry thinks it’s hilarious, smoothly catching whatever Draco let fall and smirking at him, taking great pride and satisfaction in being able to frighten Draco easily. It's a crucial factor in most of his devious ploys to amuse himself and rob Draco of all his dignity, and Draco has long since given up his hopes of ever growing impervious to it.
Potter doesn’t appreciate it either, giving him a Look because obviously you cannot compare children and ferrets at all (and Draco has been adamant about denying the existence of ferrets in their house, doing his best to ignore them and act like it’s all completely normal).
Draco hadn't even considered that. He only brought the necessities with him when he moved, clothes and books mostly, some of the furniture his mother insisted he take, a few portraits that would have been mortally offended had denied them the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Draco didn’t bring anything … nice, nothing comforting or sentimental, nothing that doesn't serve a purpose.
Ginny always seems to know everything there is to know (and even more in form of wild conclusions that have nothing at all to do with reality) about the newest low of his life, and not once is
Draco made sure to add some sketchy morals into their papers; it’s not too unheard of and seemed totally justified at the moment. Initially Draco thought it would be best to be prepared for the highly likely event that Potter’s hot-headed Gryffindor logic realised that the easiest way to get out of an unwanted marriage is the tragic death of a husband, which would lead to an attack Draco would
In one remarkably clear moment, Draco thinks that this—Potter's attention crowding against reality and making it void—must be what heaven feels like.
married out of love either. This is a business transaction, a marriage of convenience, nothing more. Except it isn’t even that. It’s not convenient, it’s not polite, it doesn’t allow Draco any of the things he dreamed of when he agreed to Potter’s joking proposal. He is not making as much progress with his plans of renovating as he would like, because Potter snatches his papers away when they are forced into the same room and plain refuses to let Draco change a single thing. At this speed, Draco is never going to help his mother. Whatever they are doing here, it isn't based on any agreement.
Sometimes Draco wonders, if that is how she felt during the war, her husband broken and her son doomed.
buy the scones, fully aware she preferred those that would require 30 minutes standing in line. Draco is still going to protest.)
Potter, it seems, is blind even with his glasses firmly on his face. There is no other explanation to why he doesn’t react in any way, not growing more flustered or staring at Draco—both of these reactions would have been fully justified and appreciated! Instead, when Potter finally does react, it’s to grip his weapon tighter, like he anticipates having to swing it again, and soon.
“As if you even could,” Harry snaps. Not his best comeback and rather disproportionally harsh, but Harry has to draw the line
Harry will use for cooking, evil manipulation to tip the tide of their competition in his favour) and Ginny simply has too much information. They would be unstoppable together, and Harry shudders to think what they would come up with.
“Everything, Draco?” Potter smiles at him, the most tempting smile without even trying. It’s soft, so damnable
Before any of that can happen, Potter falls through the floor. He just … falls. What? There is a loud crash, Potter landing one floor below, presumably, and Draco can only stare at the spot Potter stood not two seconds ago.
First, he would hate to be the centre of any room most of the time, but especially this room and particularly this situation. No thanks.
Potter looks lovely, of course, strangely comfortable in the beasts fist. He is wearing a dress a particularly fetching shade of plum, his hair long and bound up into a ponytail that, frankly unnaturally, defies water and gravity alike. Beyond anything, Potter looks dreadfully bored with the brutish creature carrying him around.
Ah yes, dishwasher, Potter already said that, while Draco was too busy thinking of beheaded French kings to pay attention to weird Muggle stuff.
He clings to that, to wanting what Pansy describes when she had too much to drink to stick to her usual dirty jokes. He doesn’t want the rest of it, the brutal efficiency in short meet ups with only one purpose, the exchange of saliva and tongues, cold and hard and fast and loud, people screaming and beds (if they make it to the bed, that is, a thought that makes Draco shudder in horror) shaking. Pansy talks about that too, a glint in her eyes and the sort of longing Draco never understood. He gave up trying to empathise with
“Is that a serious question, Potter?” It can’t be, this is the fourth time Draco is coming to save Potter out of his little fantasy—surely even a Gryffindor of extraordinary proportions would recognise the pattern!
to be cleaned or if he could eat one more dinner of them. Which Draco informed him was disgusting and unacceptable, don’t worry.
Draco is not a patient man. He gets restless and tired of waiting and he is not shy about making his impatience known. Draco is used to glaring people into working faster, being more efficient, walking on one side of the side of the street when they insist on walking so slowly you seriously have to question if they fell asleep doing it. The very limited amount of patience he has, he reserves for friends and family, people who proved themselves worthy of such indulgence.
“Long live the king,” a voice says, loud over their silence. Weasley yells, shaken out of his stupor and reaching for the edge, for Potter, but frozen like he was in the forest, denied the ability to help.
, and without realising it, Harry had wanted them all to seamlessly melt together. It’s a ridiculous wish, connected with much work if at all possible, but there you have it. It might have been Ron and Hermione pushing him, but Harry wanted them to meet Draco just as much.
Malfoy’s skin is soft, so incredibly soft under his hands. Harry knew that, of course he did, this is hardly the first time they touch, but nonetheless it feels like a revelation. His hair, too, is smooth, slipping around his fingers and escaping the curls Harry tries to form them into half-minded. They are close enough to each other that Harry is sure he could count Malfoy’s eyelashes if he had a little more light, close enough that every love story Harry ever saw or read demands he leans forward to kiss Malfoy. It would magically solve all their problems, say all the things they would never put into words and might not even have figured out for themselves and everyone would be happy.
Yes, Potter has seen extraordinary amounts of patience from Draco, and in thanks he kept pushing and pushing, searching to see how far he could go before Draco has enough. Well. Congratulations Potter, you found the line.
sound glorious. She fills her words with passion and idealism, makes anything sound worth the struggle, the exhausted pride that comes with fighting for a worthy goal. It’s what Pansy does, who she is, for as long as Draco has known her. He’s always admired that about her. In his lesser moments, he was viciously jealous of her attitude.
Potter isn’t here to watch him die, Potter is here to watch him triumph, to cheer him on and apologise, in his own way.
In the end, it’s far faster than Draco would have thought possible, far too fast for him to do anything. There is a noise like all the others, loud and booming and the world shakes around them, and then the door splinters and breaks and is kicked down as something massive charges into the tiny room, crowding it immediately.
“Then there is the matter of …” Draco trails off and makes a crude hand gesture, hoping Potter will catch on on his own. He doesn’t, frowning at Draco in exasperation. Right, no way around it then. Draco takes a deep breath, remembers he is behaving absolutely ridiculous because it should
Not that Harry asked, laughing and uncaring of the fact that Draco exerted considerable efforts not to fall directly onto him,
about a future with Malfoy and had to spend the rest of the night watching mindless TV to get rid of the images (and because Grimmauld resents the TV; Harry never claimed not to be petty).
, that Draco was keeping something from me. I finally figured it out when he joined us for movie night. He brought Parkinson and didn’t tell me, and they looked so comfortable and close — I got jealous, there was shouting, and then he confessed that he invited her because he didn’t trust me to make sure he wasn’t cast out. Things spiralled from there. We should have stopped, should have built our entire relationship anew from the ground, brutally honest in what we wanted.” Harry can’t be sure if that would have helped or if it would have damned them to a slower death, but it’s the only solution he can think of.
Draco needs a plan. He needs to think of something, needs to trick this thing—he ducks again, leaps to the side and lands hard but not eaten—and he needs to find Potter, make him put an end to this.
He breaks the kiss as he slumps over, struggling for air and clinging to Potter’s shoulders to keep upright, to not get lost in the blinding pleasure sparking behind his eyes.
Besides, it’s not all bad. Some of Potter’s touch aren't revolting and the one thing Draco truly cannot allow Potter (mostly) accepted with nothing but a few confused looks. Among these, there are good touches too, friendly touches, that speak of intimacy and trust. They are a lazy remnant of Potter sating his urges, both of them needing a moment to catch their breath and calming their pumping hearts, Potter’s hands stroking over the flesh he roughly grabbed and soft lips nuzzling against skin he bit.
But Potter doesn’t look like he is joking, stupidly green eyes wide and earnest, a hand laying on his stomach like he imagines what it would feel like to be pregnant. This is getting weird.
read the letter of summoning Hermione sent, “then you would know that we are here because this needs to stop. Harry has been seriously harmed —” Ron steps on his foot, probably as reminder to display some pain to accompany Hermione's claim, but he is so brutal Harry doesn’t have to fake the hurt noise — “and I'm unwilling to let these two morons go on until one of them dies from their stupidity.”
they had. He liked sharing his life with Draco, liked pretending not to notice as Draco watched his cooking to, as he claims, learn from Harry’s mistakes and liked even more when they started cooking together, much more often than just once a week, arguing over whose fault it is that they still can’t cook and who screwed up the pasta. Harry liked going to bed with Draco pressing close, even liked waking up with Draco’s hair in his face, though he wouldn't admit that one if held at the tip of a wand. Harry liked

am the one who did all the saving! Why am I made fun of for that?” That was a very unwise thing to say out loud, his friends sitting up with renewed glint of interest in their eyes.
Malfoy looks around like he owns the place. Granted, he kind of does, what with the archaic insistence on blood and all, but there is absolutely no need to be a smug prick about it. Except when you are Malfoy, it seems, and being a smug prick is just what you
Potter grumbles and glowers some more for good measure, but he does move the book. Much better, Draco doesn't know who previously organized the shelves or why it wasn’t in the section to begin with, but that is where it belongs. Only five more piles to sort through before they can call it a night.
, she cares and she has no intentions of moving on and adding them to her collection of broken hearts. For Potter to dismiss her like that, act like Pansy is the worst thing that could happen to his friends and should be kept away, well, Draco might become more interested in aiding Pansy in her wooing. Pansy deserves to be happy, and Draco won’t let Potter stand in the way because he has prudish views on monogamy and prejudices against Slytherins.
“Malfoy, you are still here.” Potter smiles at him, that same surprised but happy smile he wore after their first movie, when he realised Draco intended to save him as often as it would take.
Then there was eating at the same table as masked psychopaths, torturing Muggles for fun and honestly convinced they could beat

didn’t doubt that he would be the perfect person to declare Potter’s story to the greedy public, but that doesn’t mean that
“That is hardly the same!” Draco could go on, about the huge impact and its effect, but Harry glares at him, and Draco doesn’t.
It’s rather insulting, that Draco should have to go to such an effort to get something they long since agreed to view as normal. Even before that hideous couch and Harry’s arms around him became a reliable constant, Draco didn’t need such extreme methods. It’s a few steps back, Draco is sure, and it’s concerning, but right now, he would do anything to convince Harry to stop frowning like that and to no longer have to think. Looking like a helpless idiot usually does the trick, activating something in Harry’s Hero-Brain and making him switch into Saviour mode.
The words are rushed and garbled together, barely audible over the surging of his blood. Draco can’t decide what to hope for, that Potter understood and he doesn’t have to repeat himself or that Potter
Draco watches Pansy play with the most recent of Potter’s alleged strays and wonders what he would say if he could see them now, if he would finally stop bringing these horrid things if he saw Pansy’s open delight. It’s no mystery why Potter seeks to torment him, he is not half as good a liar as he likes to think and he could never resist a chance to make Draco’s life miserable. Bringing in animals that not only hold a ton of bad memories for Draco but also like to bite at anything they can reach — they ruined a pair of his favourite shoes before Draco found a repellent charm that worked against them – is not exactly Potter’s usual method, but Weasley is far too gleeful with every furry bundle he brings over not to be involved. Draco is sure they are congratulating themselves on their genius each time a ferret sneaks up on him and almost startles him into a heart-attack.
How did that happen? Was it that bad before Draco cleaned the table or did he inadvertently chase Potter deeper into himself?
Draco doesn’t fall. He has a moment of warring with himself, of trying to remember why it would be so terrible if he just gave in and gives Potter what they want (there is the fact that Potter might not fully understand what is happening and what consequences it might have in the real world; the fact that this is all happening in Potter’s mind and Draco doesn’t know how much of himself Potter would be sharing with him if he weren’t already invading; the fact that Potter is vulnerable and comatose in a hospital bed—the list goes on, but there are more important things to be done then to follow it down) and ultimately Draco manages to pull his eyes away from Potter’s mouth. Not that his eyes are much safer, but at least he doesn’t want to kiss those, just stare into them for hours like the besotted fool he is.
It only happened once, and it was Potter who got the brunt of its anger and then refused to tell Draco about it, but they agreed to endeavour to keep Potter safe so that’s what Draco shall do. Even if that means repeating everything three times because you can talk to a mule and be understood faster than talking to Potter. Besides, Potter always gets so grumpy when he feels slighted and his mood has a way of spreading through the entire house, sooner or later affecting Draco, too.
“That was the plan, you moron. I don’t know what you thought to do to that poor knife but it looked dangerous. I seem to remember you promising to stay out off the kitchen after you nearly burned down our place as you tried to make breakfast, until midway through you remembered that you hate cooking and don’t want to do it anymore.” That is a fair point, unfortunately. Harry
, he has people now) who notice and care when he drops off the face of the earth. Harry should have answered their calls. He doesn't remember hearing them, but he should have answered.
I have no idea what you are playing at, but if you are calling me uncivilised I’ll have you know that I’m perfectly capable of talking in dusted phrases; I just choose not to. Does my rudeness shock you?
Draco might have kicked the dishwasher then, because it’s an uncooperative, smug piece of technology and Potter is still laughing and Draco invested
Ron looks at him like he considers running—which is insulting—and Harry prepares to tackle him into the ground, when Ron’s face suddenly lights up in relief.
“If you are so sure of that, why don’t we bet on it?” There are a million reasons why this is a bad idea, the way Malfoy eagerly leans forward as he proposes it just one of them, but Harry has terrible impulse control.
“Sorry,” Potter rasps, the world almost impossible to understand, and Draco feels an absurd amount of pride bloom in his chest.
It doesn’t, of course, Draco sits securely enough straddling Harry’s hips, looking smug and obnoxiously pleased with himself as he grants Harry a respite to catch his breath. Big mistake, giving Harry room to think. Because really, now that Harry can see clearly again, this is fairly simple. Harry smirks up at Draco, watches in satisfaction as he frowns in confusion and uses that momentum to flip them over.
Why doesn't Harry say anything? Draco made it more than clear that he is done talking and would like to change the topic now, please. Maybe it's that, the courtesy of letting Draco choose safer grounds.
“Wow, way to ruin the mood, Malfoy.” Potter sighs, idly poking his food-lump and presenting Grimmauld with the picture of dejected-yet-devoted-husband. Draco doesn’t have time for this, for Potter’s infuriating acting or the tiny smirks he flashes Draco now and then, always reminding him that it is indeed nothing but a grand show and Potter has not miraculously gotten a new personality.
“Yes, I wouldn’t die for the world, Potter, only for you.” Potter is more important than the world, but he thankfully doesn’t say that. He has done a good job of keeping this moment light, of not letting Potter know there were worlds building and dying within him, that one wrong word could have pushed him into eternal misery—he has no intention on ruining that with leaning too far into the other direction.
Potter, it’s Potter who has to face them, who has to do something. Draco is nothing but the one pushing him.
Draco gasps in offence, only doesn’t swallow Potter’s finger because he pulls it away in time and then Draco is off, rattling down his familiar and well-tested speech on the importance of preserving tradition and culture and Potter chuckles softly, leading Draco into the kitchen. Well, not
why we didn’t go back! It was too far away, that’s all.” Draco very distinctly remembers burning the flyer, saying all the while that it was a shame they wouldn’t be able to return. Potter had even been there, smiling and shaking his head fondly. “You also weren’t
“Sure, I promise to take you to the lights.” Draco watches Potter’s eyes light up in excitement, pan forgotten and slipping onto the ground. “You need to untie me, though.”
Could Draco possibly get a week to prepare? He would ask Pansy, ask Theo after that because Pansy’s advice is highly likely to be inappropriate — Draco would do much better with some time to consider this.
Not that Malfoy notices, blathering on as he flits through the kitchen and pours coffee into a huge mug that he unceremoniously shoves into Harry’s hands. Harry doesn’t mind, any way of getting his coffee is a good way. Would be better if Malfoy would shut up already, but Harry submerges himself in the deeply black and steaming liquid to drown him out.
“I’ve always been rude, Draco, and you are friends with me anyways.” Pansy winks at him, like she won instead of proudly admitting to something most would consider a fundamental character flaw. Well, they are rich enough to behave however they want, but still.
Some things are better said in person, Potter. We aren’t meant to live on letters, aren’t meant to be alone.
“Since you asked so nicely.” Draco bows, because it’s part of the performance but also because he needs to bend down anyway to push the drawers in and close the door again. He doesn’t know how the dishes will be washed, then, but Potter can do that bit himself. Draco did most of the job already!
Harry feels a perverse pride at being able to say it. It’s strange — pride without any of the joy usually so closely bound into it. Instead, the feeling is laced with bitterness, acid, blooming and spreading and tainting him. Making him stronger. What’s the saying — what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger? Harry’s always hated that. What a stupid thing to say, as if that even matters right now, being strong, when it also means being alone. They also say there’s strength in numbers, which Harry personally always preferred.
“They are well cared for!” Ron has always been better at calming Hermione, so Harry has no qualms about trusting him with that task while he himself keeps psychosocially dismantling their smirking enemy. “We also made sure the ferrets are in no danger from the badger —”
“I understand—” Potter interrupts him before Draco can put his foot in his mouth with some empty phrases. Those very rarely help, in Draco’s experience.
Draco may have lost a lot, viciously clinging on to everything he held dear, only for it to be ripped away, leaving his hands bloody, but he wouldn’t die quietly, wouldn’t let them twist his story to fit their own self-righteous narration. Draco had his spite, and he had his friends, and nothing would stop him from making them sit up, pay attention, and acknowledge they were wrong.
to find the monster? Which he doesn’t, if he is being honest. Draco doesn’t look forward to having to fight yet another battle, wouldn’t do it all if Potter wasn’t waiting at the end of it. Potter, Draco is here for Potter. He wants to find
Draco is Potter’s equal because history doesn’t determine who he is now and because he emerged from the same bloody struggle that Potter did, because even in hostility he knew Potter better than those fancying themselves his fans and, at times, even those thinking themselves his friends. Draco is Potter’s equal, because he sees all of Potter, even the dark and twisted places everyone is fond of pretending don’t exist.
“Yes, welcome to the world of Snow White. Now grab your hatchet and get walking, they carried you so far because they are kind but now that you can walk yourself they won’t tolerate you slacking.” Weasley leaves, whistling a jolly tune as he takes the hand of the dwarf protecting them—Granger, of course it’s Granger—and follows the path down.
Draco doesn’t know what Weasley is going through, no, but he knows that same grief and how it looks on himself, on those he loves.
(That’s the only really good thing about Malfoy starting his renovations — he gave up his game of being unreachable, which means more sex, which in turn means Grimmauld almost
As he watches Granger retreat from the room to flee into the sanctuary of Pansy’s arms, Draco thinks he managed quite well on this one. Next will be Weasley, who should be easier for being his second try, if nothing else.
It's also beside the point, however; nothing more than a vaguely annoying inclination that Draco can shut down long enough to drink a civilised cup of tea (or two, or three, or perhaps stay for a well-mannered dinner, entirely depending on how much convincing his mother needs). First the tea, then the divorce and some politely feigned regret over how things have ended, a legal battle over Grimmauld and their fortunes, and then, finally, Draco can have a moment to look at the pile of shards his life has broken into.
to save us all and thinks that means he gets to pick the movie every damn time. But, given that Harry is the one making the choices around here, I think you are good. For
The door is surprisingly easy to open (Grimmauld conveying this is the ideal moment for Harry to swoop in and save the git?) and Harry can hear Malfoy’s hysterically screeched whispers. Harry wishes he had thought to bring something to record this, asked Ron for the right charm, perhaps. Too late now, he will have to take in every detail to remember later.
is why people don’t get along with their ex-partner; they know too much. She also is not intimidated by his scowl at all, laughing in his face and eating her popcorn totally unconcerned. Why did Harry invite her again?
Potter has always done this to him, absorbed his ability to focus on anything else—Draco was foolish not to consider that when he bought the cards. He should have brought friends, should have filled the seats between them with people cheering the game on and asking prying questions. They would be laughing and demanding snacks and making lewd innuendos because Draco’s friends are the worst and actually, perhaps it’s good after all that he didn’t bring them. He doesn’t need that kind of pressure on his possibly-a-date with Potter.
“Then why won’t you?” Potter asks, a challenge. This is the Potter Draco has known half his life, stubborn to a fault, a jaw made to be squared in determination, lips ample and glorious pushed into a pout. Potter doesn’t mean to tempt him, Draco knows he doesn’t, but dammit if Draco doesn’t fall to his lust after all, just for that expression of defiant spite.
“We could try the force field thing, that worked well in the movie! We need something to block the electricity, and usually Harry should be strong enough to break out of it, but perhaps if you could stretch yourself out, Malfoy—” Draco has no idea what Weasley is talking about, far too fast and drawing on knowledge Draco is missing. He looks back at Granger, hoping she has a more workable idea than … whatever it is Weasley is blathering on about.
Draco doesn’t like seeing him like this. It isn’t right, Potter reduced to a pain he was never quite free from, but always shone brighter than. Potter is movement, he is sparks and emotions torn out into the open, eyes green like the killing curse, harsh judgement and sweet mercy. Potter is lips pursed in anger or open into the widest smile. His hands are meant to fly through the air, reaching for the snitch and casting spells and illustrating his words. His hair isn’t meant to lay still, tame on the starched white of the pillow.
It is truly too late already? Draco could let him in, could open the door just a moment to pull him through. He wouldn’t let any of the monsters in, would close the door against their sharp teeth and greedy tongues. He would just pull Harry in. It would only take a second.
not to talk about it either, no agreement to let the past be the past and to never mention it again, it just never came up. No surprise there, Harry used to devote huge efforts to Not Thinking about any of it, to not dwell on it and move on with his happy ending already. Only it wasn’t all that happy, but Harry learnt how to sell the story.
“Not if this is the level of romance and consideration you bring to the table, no.” Draco’s heart is beating wildly, like he is reduced to a stupid teenager once more, including unfortunate feelings for his archenemy, who is very likely going to die trying to save the world because he is reckless like that.
“Hello Malfoy,” Potter says and Draco almost lets go of the door from how weak he is for that man. “No tea this time?”
Draco held her then, words useless and insufficient, but she clung to him like he was the only thing holding her up. It was enough that day, and it has always been enough since. Weasley didn't hurt Pansy any more than she has been hurt time and time again, and Draco will help her bear it. He just also wishes he could have protected her from it altogether.
“No, of course not.” Weasley frowns at him, like that isn’t a very justified concern. “This is a silly song that Harry, for some unfathomable reason is very fond of. Honestly, I’ve never liked this movie all that much, but I guess Harry saw more of his own experiences reflected in it, thrown into a new world and all that, you know?”
“Technically —” Draco says as he climbs into bed next to Harry, “— we aren’t breaking any rules here. I don’t know about you, but I see nothing at all.”
“I think it’s some twisted form of punishment for not kissing Malfoy's feet?” Yeah, that sounds better than admitting that Harry
“Given that Harry is the almighty movie god—don’t tell him I said that, he is sneaky enough about taking turns choosing a movie; bloke dies
don’t perform well when I’m being yelled at. Let’s avoid yelling, alright? I want these to be good biscuits,
Well, not a lot. In the end there is only two things Harry absolutely needs to know: why Draco never told him, and if there’s any way to save this weird, wondrous relationship they fought so hard for (or Harry did, for his part, at least).
“No, though I can reassure you it wouldn’t be as bad as you fear. Ron is a pretty good cook,” Potter says, as if to reassure him. Draco doesn’t point out that ‘pretty good’ isn’t good enough for Potter, that he deserves the best food this world can produce. Potter probably wouldn’t want it, either, would choose burned pancakes over the most impressive menus as long as it was a friend who prepared them for him. Potter is sentimental like that .
Harry doesn’t need to see Draco to know that he is smirking, pleased with himself and aiming to impress. And impress he did, Harry’s brilliant, devious husband.
“She would have killed me, Malfoy, if I hadn’t jumped out of the way in time.” Potter sounds exactly like the people claiming old scars from paper cuts as war wounds, making up elaborate lies of how they came
As Ron does nothing more interesting than grumbling too low for their curious audience to understand and mopping up his spilt beer (and Harry casts a discreet charm to remind them all they have more pressing matters to attend to) the hubbub dies down rather quickly.
One would think Harry has grown used to it by now, the uncompromising swill the only thing keeping him awake during Draco’s crazy furniture migration. In reality, all Harry learnt is how to gulp down as much as possible of it, thanking the scorching heat for burning away his ability to taste anything, and discreetly sneak off to add milk and sugar.
going to talk about it tomorrow. Most likely Malfoy will be intent on avoiding the conversation as well, so that should work out fine. Fairer as Grimmauld might be now, it doesn’t actually change their situation at all. Harry still needs the git, nothing new to discuss there.
if it were just sex, but he can hardly throw Malfoy out in the morning and never see him again. Because they
I do have to insist on Artemis, though. She belongs with you, she knows that better than you. Animals are clever that way, closer connected to magic and better attuned to the energies around us. That is why they are ascribed empathic powers; it’s not for nothing that they are frequently kept in our houses and homes. If Artemis returned to you, then you need her.
There is something there, in the centre, beckoning and waiting, standing tall and too far away to make out clearly. It has energy, too, strong enough to be felt even over the distance. It stands to reason that Potter is in the centre of this contraption, whether of his own volition or not.
Apologies don’t come easy to Draco, nothing but the guilt laying heavy in his gut and the words waiting just out of reach. Perhaps they aren't supposed to be easy, perhaps this is how they are for everyone.
know how he feels, warm and giddy and oddly pleased, but that is neither here not there. What is he supposed to
He doesn’t understand how he pulled that off, how he managed to fall around his attacker without actually falling, but he doesn’t dwell on it. The workings of Potter’s mind, perhaps, or Draco is just
And then they sit at the table, candles shining soft light onto them and Draco’s food spread out between them. Draco feels oddly accomplished. Granted, nothing in this world would get him back into that kitchen, but he thinks he managed alright in the end. If you ignore the minor breakdown and the rather dramatic rescue mission Harry had to undertake. Draco for his part is resolved to ignore it all.
“I guess you did,” Draco whispers, not daring to speak any louder that. He feels around for Potter’s hand, reluctant to take his eyes of him but wanting to touch, needing to hold on to him lest he get swept away.
He decides not to gamble with Potter’s peace of mind and doesn’t throw himself onto the counter. Instead, Draco contains all the dramatics to his own person, fainting where he stands, hand on his forehead in a picture of agony.
Potter raises the cover and presents — shapeless blobs of dull-coloured food. Draco has no idea what that was supposed to be, dismal and drooping, a mockery of the promised outcome. He suddenly seriously doubts Potter’s cooking abilities. But why would Potter cook himself if he can't even manage appetisers?
“I do,” Draco agrees, because it’s always time for ice cream. “I don’t think I want to move, though.”
Granger, for her part, looks as put out as a horse can look, their faces already long as they are. Not even the wings seem to help; Draco can’t understand how they wouldn’t—flying without a broom! It sounds glorious to Draco’s ears, enough so that he is almost jealous of Granger and the role assigned to her. Granger has never been big on flying, if he remembers correctly, and it seems a shame that she should be given wings when they all know she is unlikely to use them.
Harry almost feels bad for ruining that moment, waits perhaps a little long before he answers. What can he say, it’s nice just being able to stand in his house with his husband without wishing he could set them both on fire. (No, not fire, never fire. Not after the Room of Requirement, not after seeing the naked fear in Malfoy’s face, the flames dancing around them.)
“Don’t despair, Potter, your narrow Gryffindor brain might not understand it, but I do know what friendship is. I’ll prove it to you, starting tomorrow. Enjoy your tea.” Draco smiles at Potter, bowing where he stands—because the scene was lacking some drama, sue him—and walks out of Potter’s shop.
“Actually, I named her captain, as a tribute to the dragon riders. I had problems with proper pronunciation; the name stuck longer than the problems.” Harry looks at him with that same wide-eyed possibly-awe and absolutely nothing that resembles recognition of the name. Draco, because he is still nervous and needs a distraction, latches on the topic. It’s not like talking about dragons is a hardship.
“You are nothing like Dudley, you know.” Harry says it like it’s a miracle, a revelation. Draco wonders how long Harry compared the two of them. “I thought you were, because you look the same from the outside, but you are not.
Draco doesn’t realise until it’s too late that he spectacularly botched the opportunity Theo built for him. Draco had wanted to take the light, joking tone and go with it, bury his real Feelings under exaggerated and overdrawn mockeries of them, displayed for their amusement. Turns out his real feelings
feel guilty about the war, and Harry does not only have that pesky prophecy blaming him, but all those Important People making him personally responsible for everything they couldn’t grab a medal for), but he refuses to add more to that pile.
the actual problem, because without it Harry could go on blissfully oblivious and write Draco off as a stand-offish prick who doesn’t know how to appreciate the simple, good things in life. Well, whatever it is, it makes Harry’s evening a whole lot more complicated than bringing these two markedly different parts of his life together was already going to be.
“Your sordid love affair with the Weasleys, for one.” Pansy stops, not expecting that, and Draco feels ridiculously satisfied when he sees she might even be
house,” Harry answers at Malfoy’s — rather excessive — poking into his side after he was quiet for too long.
“Are you alright,” Draco asks, telling himself that he will move and get up should Harry not be okay with staying like this.
Draco is also very aware that they can’t. No matter how perfect this is, how much he wants to see Potter’s eyes flutter close as his mouth opens, just slightly, just enough to be tempting, it wouldn’t be right. Draco is here to save Potter, because Potter is hurt and vulnerable. Draco
to love you and you have a very charming smile—you could hold them in the palm of your hand with very little effort.” It always baffled Draco how Potter didn’t seem aware of that, how he seemed completely ignorant to the ease with which he could rule the world.
“Odd, that never stopped him before,” Pansy mutters to her ferret, acting like she doesn't mean for Draco to hear. Draco feels that gives him the right to pretend he really
“Well, good, because I really did have someone I wanted you to meet and we are indecently late to our appointment.” Draco doesn’t want to move, not ever, but he would also rather be in Mary’s lovely store than some seedy alley, so.
Something scratches at the windows. It blocks out the light of the moon entirely, and Draco stifles a whimper against his palm.
In rare instance of mercy, being aware actually does make it easier to handle. Usually knowing you are being baited doesn't help at all.
Harry doesn’t know if the tea is a nervous habit, something Ron did solely to have something to do and focus on, or if he genuinely believes that tea fixes everything. Either way, Harry gladly accepts the cup pressed into his hands, clutching the warmth against his chest.
Harry will get his answers, one way or another he will learn how long Draco has been playing this twisted game, what he hoped to gain from it.
Draco could have continued to define their relationship over touches they didn’t have — gracing fingers when passing each other; hands squeezing in support or, later, a show of possession, a claim staked far better than slobbering kisses; peacefully sitting close and being friends, if nothing else — but thinking about the endless possibilities of what could have been is madness, and Draco is still too young to wear that look with grace.
That is what Draco will do, pretend and shove his feelings down until they no longer hurt, until the pain is dulled and far away, and they can move on with their life.
In unwillingly orchestrating a spectacular win for Potter—Draco standing, shaking like a leaf in the opening of a plane, looking down at the ground far away and Potter laughing next him—he also lost a chance to push Potter into something he would actually
much, there were a lot of hints and confirmations of truths Draco already suspected. And laughter, mostly at Draco’s badly concealed incompetence.
Taking revenge on someone when their very intimidating mother is sitting barely a few feet away, watching and judging and probably with a fast-working poison ready to pour discreetly into your tea — that’s the kind of stupid they later call either valour or foolhardy, depending on the outcome.
“Most of it should be easy enough, though you will have to quit complaining about me to your friends, seeing how pure-blood marriages are closer to alliances and those need to present a united front.” That’s something of an exaggeration, Draco must admit, but he doesn’t like the thought of Potter badmouthing him in his own house. He doesn’t like the thought of Potter badmouthing him in general, people have the unfortunate tendency to take his word as gospel, but Draco can’t really stop Potter from doing it altogether. A minor technicality he doesn’t intend to point out.
Harry scowls at her, which earns him more flying popcorn. This time, however, Harry is prepared and easily catches them all with his mouth, making a big show out of happily munching her food.
“And you plan to — what? Cooks this first shared meal and hope your cooking skills will poison him?” Ron is surprisingly not supportive. Has to be Parkinson's influence, or Ron would have been ecstatic at the idea of settling Malfoy with food poisoning.
to Parkinson, hides behind her from the room and allows her eerie shark smile to eclipse him. Parkinson gets to do all the things Harry hasn’t quite owned up to wanting just yet, the very public proclamation of intimacy and affection, the easy familiarity with which they fit against each other. They grew up together, Draco told him, and Harry would bet his last penny that they sat like this on chairs more often than anyone would bother counting. It stands to reason they got comfortable doing it.
Ron makes a straggled noise somewhere, and just like that the decision is made. Disgust, Harry is disgusted. What was he thinking? He needs to get Malfoy out of here.
He finds it, Potter’s hand, clings to it with the desperation of a drowning man. A miscalculation, it turns out, because Potter squeezes his hand and smiles at him and Draco realises he isn’t the lifeline, isn’t safe and stable but the ocean, wild and alive around him, unpredictable and too deep to ever be fully understood by mere mortals.
Knowing what he does now—that this is a seduction and everything here designed to make Draco forget about his objections and give in to his desire and kiss Potter—Draco can see the thought behind every element. It might even have worked, the intimacy and the stars tempting Draco away, were it not for the water and the unflattering colour of that dress.
like collecting various favours — which is normal enough — and making sure that everyone remembers he has them, that he simply has to call them in — which might be less normal. But Draco works hard for these favours and he can do with them as he pleases.
But then, it had always been easy for Pansy. Pansy isn’t afraid of defying all the rules, doing whatever she wants with whoever she wants without consideration for traditional values. Pansy claims it allows her to breathe, free and rebellious and learning all life has to offer, learning all
Parkinson is here, Draco didn’t tell him anything about it, though he all but admitted to having planned on her presence, and quick like that, Harry doesn’t know what to believe anymore. How much of it, of
“Come here, Harry, let me hug you.” Draco prays the nail polish had enough time to dry, finds he doesn’t care if he smears it all over his clothes, and pulls Potter in for a hug that the man immediately falls into.
In fact, the entire room looks different. It’s still very much the same room, not changed in the slightest, except for the flowers everywhere. Not to brag, but Draco is pretty sure it’s solely
On the other hand, Draco has long since made peace with the fact that his curiosity will be the downfall of him. He is curious to a fault, will ask the wrong question to the wrong person at the wrong time and that will be that. Draco is alright with that.
Potter is an arse, constantly seeking to make Draco miserable so that he leaves and Potter can legally demand Grimmauld after their divorce, Draco has no plans of making it this easy for him. Potter will have to try harder if he wants to get rid of Draco. In the meantime, can anyone blame him for using the most obvious weapon at his disposal to defend himself?
Spurred on by new determination, Draco focuses on his goal. It doesn’t matter that the floor is hard and cold under his knees, that his jaw is beginning to protest the stretch, that he is harder than he can remember ever being—there is nothing but Potter, his eyes heavy on Draco, his breathing loud in the silence, sitting open and vulnerable to whatever Draco decides to do with him.
“Excuse me?” Draco evidently utilised their little break better than Harry did, composure pulled tight around him in a far more effective shield than the blanket he lost somewhere in Harry's attack, clipping his words short.
Harry vetoed any rituals on principle. For one, because Hermione can’t be absolutely sure they are actually going to work, with the specific spells woven into Grimmauld or even just in general. It would be naive to blindly trust what such a stuck up bunch decided to publicly share. But Hermione weeded out those who obviously end with the caster losing anything from a limb to his life (torture doesn’t seem to have been very creative, most traps cost people their right arm, the
“Grimmauld is now reaching new levels of petulance.” That’s putting it mildly. More accurate would be the description of ‘pissed off poltergeist’, but that reference would be lost on Ron. He never could warm up to muggle categories of magic. “Since Malfoy moved in, he is the new default. I never realised how tiny the bloke is until I hit my head against the kitchen cabinets Grimmauld moved down so Malfoy can reach them without over-exerting his short, dainty arms.”
He looses himself in that, pressing his tongue up and around Potter’s cock as he moves on it, pulling up and pushing down, taking Potter in again and again. He can’t swallow Potter whole, not without gagging on it, and so Draco wraps his free hand around the base, holding him steady and firm as he explores the rest with his mouth, tracing veins and sucking at the head. Potter is babbling above him, hands clenching in Draco’s hair every time he swoops down like he experiences Draco’s warmth for the first time again.
The rest doesn’t matter after that, everything dulled that isn’t Potter’s eyes, wide and green as they follow Draco’s every move.
Hermione Granger. Fantastic. Exactly the person Draco wanted to be judged by when at his absolute lowest.
Can’t be helped anymore, he supposes. Currently it’s still nice and soft here, comfort and warmth wrapping heavily around Harry and pulling him down, lulling him to sleep —
would do, is it?” Draco takes up his tea again. He isn’t foolish enough to actually try and drink it, but it’s very effective in looking put together and scheming.
Hermione had grabbed the copy of Daily Prophet from Nott and gasped at the title. If the title was bad, then she knew there must be worse things in the actual article. "Dumbledore's Giant Mistake." Hermione and Harry stood and read the article.
