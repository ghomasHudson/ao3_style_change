Harry takes a deep breath and looks to Draco, making sure the other man has also finished reading the short note.
“Oh?”
Draco nods and goes to round up the other children. Within a few minutes, Harry and Draco’s bed is barely big enough. Matthew is sitting, legs outstretched, with James between them leaning on his chest. Lily is lying with her head on one of Matthew’s thighs. Albus is sitting between Draco and Harry, facing Scorpius, who is leaning up against the headboard between them.
“I want his name to somehow represent both of us,” Harry explains. “Obviously, my notes for a girl are moot. I know for you, something celestial, but I don’t know what would represent me yet.”
his brain unhelpfully provides.
Al looks up from picking at his duvet and his bright green eyes lock onto Harry’s.
“Reach up in there and pull him out,” Harry says, only half kidding.
“For anything around the house, Harry doesn’t even need to use a wand. I don’t think he’d feel magical fatigue the rest of us would.”
“Are you feeling up to doing the nursery now?” Draco asks as he sets their purchases on the coffee table. “Or would you like a nap first?”
cook; he’s just not necessarily the best chef, and he
“I’m glad you both have each other. There’s been a lot of changes in both of your lives the last several months.”
“Hasn’t it been awkward when you’ve talked with Scorp?”
A faint blush rises on Draco’s cheeks, and he shoots Harry a smile that sends his heart fluttering. “Shall we head up, then?”
“That’s the beginning of your womb. Your magic knew you conceived and worked to form a place for the baby to develop.” She directs her wand at a slightly different angle. “And there—” she points to a white bean-shaped area within the dark circle,” —is your baby.”
“We can figure that out together, yeah?” Harry smiles at the thought of helping Draco discover more of his own likes and dislikes. “What about blowjobs?”
“Draco?”
“She is. She’ll be here in about 15 minutes.”
“Yeah, we all have one — me, the boys…even Ginny’s locker is still here. And then any friends or family that come fly have one, as well. That end has a bunch of the boys’ friends, including Scorpius. There’s a charm that personalises them based on your preferences.” Harry motions to the opposite end of the lockers. “Adults are over here. Come on. You can pick one for yourself.”
and begins to read.
, and
“Why don’t you get settled, and I’ll go herd the other three towards bed?”
Harry hopes fervently that Draco feels the same way he does. They’ve been open so far about everything and they seem to be on the same page, but Harry is falling even harder than he had been aware of, and that’s just a little bit scary. The hand over Harry’s abdomen moves slightly and Harry watches sleepy grey eyes open.
Draco winks at him and turns back to the television display. “I plan to put the television on the mantle above the fireplace, much like yours is set up,” he says, as if his previous comment had never happened.
Draco breaks the kiss and lifts his weight off Harry’s body, rolling to lay beside him and Harry shivers at the loss of contact and body heat. Draco tugs Harry over to lay on his stomach and gently prompts him to raise on his knees. Harry willingly and rapidly obliges, canting his arse into the air and closing his eyes as he pillows his head on his arms. He feels Draco’s fingers run down his body and sees one of Draco’s legs slide into view as Draco sits behind him. Firm, warm hands caress his arse, moving to hold his hips, and Harry feels hot lips kiss him gently where the hands were just moments before.
“You helped my partner and me find new bedroom furniture several weeks ago.” Harry nods towards Draco. “We had altered our appearance for privacy reasons.”
“The whole thing.” Hermione shoots him a look. “But yes, especially the library. Are you planning on finishing it before the baby?”
Draco drags a chair to the bedside with a loud scrape before sinking into it and taking Harry’s hand.
“That’s baby’s head. Now, since you know that, and you have the image, you can follow and see that the spine would be here—” she moves James’ hand along the skin. “—and that would put his feet about here, up in the ribs.” She releases James’ hands and they both step back.
“I think I’ve found the issue. Would you like Mr Malfoy to step out?”
“It’s just help between co-workers?” Draco asks in a voice that clearly indicates he thinks otherwise. Confused, Harry tries to figure out what Draco is getting at. Claire is overzealous and chatty and touches people way too much, but she’s his co-worker and she’d asked for help.
“Why not?” Harry asks, concernedly. He hates that anything prevents Hermione from being fulfilled and happy, but, just like him, she’s faced some serious hurdles in life.
“Your point?” Harry fails to hold back a final giggle.
“Am I living here, now, too?” Scorpius sounds a bit unsure.
“What do you mean by that, Mr Malfoy?”
“Good morning to you, too. Did you sleep all right?”
“That’d be lovely.” Harry balls the pillow against his chest again. Sweet Godric Gryffindor, he has a date. With Draco fucking Malfoy.
“Of course. Lay your hand on it, just there above the handle.” Harry pulls his wand as Draco obediently places his hand as instructed. Muttering an incantation, Harry smiles as Draco gasps, his eyes widening as the locker changes from plain white to navy and gold and
She unfreezes the image and the tiny baby begins moving. “The baby is a wiggle worm. And the flickering there in the middle is the heart beating.”
“Harry.” Draco pulls back to look at Harry’s face. “Fuck. I’m not upset; I’m just really surprised.”
“Matthew is safe,” Harry assures his daughter. “He’s here and will stay with us until the five of you go back to Hogwarts.”
“We talked about it today while we were shopping. James says you’ve been alone for too long and he likes that you have a…what do you call Draco again?”
Draco smirks up at him. “Are you intending to have me for breakfast?”
“The process for the spell is a little invasive.” Harry opens to a marked page that has line drawings of what’s necessary and turns the book to James. “You or your partner will insert the tip of your wand and twist gently anticlockwise. The incantation is
“They’re just about done. They’ve just got to vanish the barriers and we can do a walkthrough.”
“I tried to explain that I’ve been attracted to boys since before Hogwarts, but she didn’t seem to care. She told me I was ungrateful for everything they did in raising me, and then told me if I was going to continue with this ‘lifestyle choice,’ I couldn’t stay in their home and I shouldn’t depend on anything from them.
“Are you doing all right, Dad?”
getting better. Healer Marris said that means we’re on the right track.” Al pauses. “And I told Scorp that I’m seeing a Mind Healer and taking a potion.”
Harry huffs in displeasure as he finds himself empty. Draco slicks his cock, slow strokes covering himself in a generous amount of lube. Merlin, he’s more than ready to have Draco inside him, to be part of each other. He pulls both knees up to his chest and flushes as Draco openly ogles Harry’s body.
“No, it has a built-in chilling charm. I activated it when I pulled it from the cellar.” Draco settles himself on the stool, one elbow on the counter, and watches Harry work. “You enjoy cooking, then?”
“This is eleven-year-old me’s wet dream,” Draco says in wonder. Harry sees the flush creeping up Draco’s neck as soon as the words are out.
“Well shit.” Harry knows Draco well enough to know that on the other side of his rage is a deadly calm. It involves cool, calculated Slytherin-style cunning and revenge.
Harry spots James over the top of Lily’s head, hand in hand with Matthew, dragging his trunk behind him. He raises a hand to catch James’ eye and is pleased to see his son grin when he’s spotted.
“I do. Kind of.” Harry pauses to gather his thoughts. “My work is important to me. And it’s literally what saved our baby’s life, and mine. It would have been impossible with the way I was feeling, but now I’m really only nauseous in the mornings.”
“Yes,” Harry says. “Let’s go home.”
“Well, I find it to be more than satisfactory. We will see if your refined palate agrees.” Draco’s voice has a teasing tone as he gestures grandly in front of them, raising his eyebrows at Harry and smiling. “Shall we?”
They took a turn and there it was: the refuge, a log cabin half-hidden among fir trees.
“Oh, no, babe.” She kissed him on the lips. Half their friends wolf-whistled and the other half made puking noises. “You’re the fittest bloke around here.”
Footsteps echo from the other room and James reappears with Healer Carr in tow.
“For Matthew.” James sticks his tongue out at his dad. “The press can fuck right off.”
Their relationship, however, is
bit, that is.
“I love you, too, Draco. You truly are my
“It’s nice to meet you, Mr Malfoy.” Matthew extends a hand, which Draco shakes.
Harry laughs. “I know, you berk. Are you ready to go?”
“Thanks,” Harry says as Malfoy places a cup in front of him with the milk and sugar. Harry adds a splash of milk and takes a spoon of sugar.
“I also wish to congratulate you on your engagement.”
He feels a potion bottle being pressed to his lips and opens his mouth obediently.
“Absolutely. Take whatever time you need. They do plan to start the interview process this coming week, but it will be ongoing as they get the department running.” Draco pauses to gaze in the window of the confectioner’s shop as they pass before looking Harry in the eye. “I really do think you’d be absolutely perfect for the job. Plus, they’re very flexible with schedules, and I know you wanted to be able to have holidays and summers with your kids.”
Draco lifts his head and looks at Harry askance. “Potter. We’re in bed, in only our pants. Why are you talking about your children?”
“We still have the flat. There are no plans to sell it. But Harry and I would like us all to stay here as a family if the four of you are amenable.” Draco rubs small circles on Harry’s back and he can feel the nerves radiating off the blond.
,” Harry scoffs. “They’ll get used to it eventually and it won’t be such a spectacle.”
“Mmmmm. Good morning, love,” a sleepy Draco mutters and Harry’s heart flutters.
Tight against their skin, Harry can feel his own magic pulsating in the tendril.
“I’ve changed my mind about liking our house full of kids.”
Shrugging into his black leather jacket, Harry opens the door for Draco and lays a hand lightly on his back to escort him out. He closes and wards the door then turns back to Draco with a smile.
. Never in a million years would he have imagined Draco to be so protective and attentive, but he is, and Harry is finding it to be the balm he never knew his battered soul needed. He only hopes he can care for Draco as meticulously as Draco is caring for him.
she brought up. She was impressed. Do you know how hard she is to impress?”
James approaches, and when he makes eye contact with him, Harry immediately knows that James is thinking that this could be him someday, pregnant and carrying the child of a man he loves.
“I’ve already talked to Dad about this because I wanted to make sure it was all right with him first, and I didn’t know what you two had been discussing, but this is something that I’ve been thinking about, and that I’ve wanted to talk to you both about for a while, and I’ve been putting it off, but now you’re getting married on Saturday so I can’t really wait any longer and—”
“Fine. I’m so happy for you, but at the same time, it’s so weird that it’s Malfoy!”
Harry detects just a hint of doubt in Draco's voice, and wonders if it's because Draco thinks Harry is
“I was actually thinking we might wait until Wednesday,” Harry suggests, and Draco gives him an odd look. “It would give Al less time to be a total mess of worry.”
“Come on then, you two,” Hermione gestures to the open French doors, “let’s go out into the garden and give your dads a minute.”
“Have a seat.” Harry gestures to the bed. “We’re going to go ahead and have this conversation now.”
The flared base of the dildo, designed to look and feel like heavy balls, brushes his arse.
“No, just tired.”
Draco hands him a phial of potion and heads for the bathroom. The sound of water running creates another issue entirely. He swallows the potion and sighs. At over 37 weeks pregnant, he swears he spends half his time going to the loo, in the loo, or heading out of the loo.
In the three weeks since the kids returned to Hogwarts, Potter Cottage has been a flurry of activity. Draco brought in several magical contractors, and after seeing proposed plans and thorough interviews, he and Harry had selected a company to construct the addition to the house. Adding Matthew to the family, along with Regulus’ impending arrival, has rendered the already-spacious home too small. Six kids and two adults need more than five bedrooms and one communal living space.
“Fuck, I’m scared.”
Hermione squeezes him in return. “I’ll save you whenever necessary.” She pulls away and looks Harry over. “What, exactly, am I saving you from today?”
“Yes!” they reply in unison. Draco laces his fingers through Harry’s and squeezes.
“I love you, too.”
“Hey.” He returns her embrace. “How was your committee meeting today?”
And he does. Harry pushes, and then there’s fire burning in his groin. He stops pushing as his body involuntarily screams in pain.
When his world rights again, Harry’s eyes search and find a sign on the wall. Draco has Apparated them to the wizarding Apparition point in South Bank, London. Harry smiles, knowing the area should be busy enough for them to blend in even if other wizards are out.
Harry turns to Draco and gazes into piercing grey eyes.
“Will you marry me, Harry?”
“I know
Harry shakes with laughter against Draco’s shoulder.
The man in question pops his head out of the study.
“Hi, Dad!” James drops Matthew’s hand to hug Harry hard.
“For Regulus,” Harry reminds himself aloud.
“So—” Healer Carr conjures a thin sheet and suspends it vertically just below Harry’s belly, shielding him from James’ view before adjusting the blankets. “—what I’m going to do now is check the canal. Your dad’s has formed well; we’re just making sure the membrane is still in place and checking to see how thick it is. I expect it will be thinning soon if it hasn’t already. Knee up, please, Mr Potter.”
“Harry.” Draco’s voice is thick with emotion. “I knew, before we started dating, what being with you would entail. We were in the papers for just being out in public as friends. I know they’ll drag up our pasts. I know they’ll be cruel. But I knew all this before I asked you on our first date. You were worth it then, and you are worth it now. I love you. We’ll get through it together.”
“He is.”
“I didn’t expect you to
“We did. I’m sure it will be in the Prophet tomorrow.”
Harry grins and tugs Draco to his feet, reaching for the waistband of Draco’s pants and sliding them down. He captures Draco’s lips in a kiss as the pants fall to the floor.
“Oh! He’s so tiny!”
“Can we lay down? It might help more, now that he’s shifted.” The heaviness now burgeoning between his legs is almost worse than the pain.
She huffs and moves to the hob, taking the spoon from Draco.
She waves her wand and the heartbeat fills the room as she turns to make notes on her parchment.
Sighing, Harry gives up and pulls a blank parchment towards him.
“Do you think you can rinse your mouth?”
“That timeline will be between Draco and me, Lil. But I’m glad that you and James are supportive of our relationship.”
“Yeah, sorry. I’m still in here.” Harry reaches for the shampoo so he can finish up and join Draco for dinner.
Draco smiles. “We’ll figure it out together.”
“Are we avoiding the press today or enduring their nonsense?” Draco asks, rolling his eyes, clearly feeling that avoiding the press is the way to go. The first time they’d dined together at a wizarding establishment, the press had shown up and started taking pictures. They’d graced the front page of the Daily Prophet the next day. Harry is always game to avoid the press, so agreeing with Draco is quite easy.
Harry takes a deep breath and tries to school his expression into something less severe. “It’s okay, most people assume that. It’s just—” Harry gropes for a word and comes up empty. “It’s just not accurate.”
“We’ll find out when they come in off the pitch. We only decided on this about fifteen minutes ago.” Draco shakes his head and rolls his eyes. “Harry just sort of blurted it out while we were on the patio. Guess that’s what I get for marrying a Gryffindor.”
Draco walks along the lockers, pauses at Harry’s, done in Puddlemere United’s colours, and smiles softly. Moving a little further, Draco places a hand on a locker three down from Harry’s. “Would this one be all right?”
“I can’t help it, Dad!”
The amount of fidgeting James is managing to do with just his hands is really quite impressive.
“Thank you, Lil. Having you on my side means a lot.” He says as he hugs her tightly.
“Do you think you’re in labour?”
Draco kisses him softly, shutting the door behind himself, and Harry hauls himself off the bed to undress. He shucks his clothing, save for his pants, and turns sideways to the mirror again.
Harry looks up at the sound of feet on the stairs and smiles as a sleep-rumpled Draco comes into view. He turns off the hob and scoops the last of the eggs onto the two plates he’s been preparing. Turning to Draco, who has come up behind him, he kisses him softly.
Love, Simon
“I think we shall.”
“Gorgeous.” Draco sucks gently at his neck. “You’re absolutely gorgeous.”
Less than an hour later, all four kids are packed and ready to use the Floo. Harry and Draco have given explicit instructions that they’re to keep quiet about the baby for now until it becomes public. The only exception is James who has permission to tell Matthew since they need to have a discussion about safe sex and contraception. Harry hopes James follows through in the entirety of the discussion, not just the pregnancy news.
“I haven’t got anything to put in it.”
He hadn’t felt the desire to be bonded to Ginny, to have their souls and their magic mingled together, and Ginny hadn’t either — they’d done a traditional wedding with a handfasting and vows instead. But with Draco, Harry wants every bit of himself entwined with the man he loves so very much. He wants Draco’s magic to pulse in his veins and
Harry’s heart is shattered for Matthew. His parents are clearly making no effort to be understanding or accepting. They’re simply…rejecting him.
Draco sighs.
Two hours later, Harry is propped up in bed with a small mountain of pillows, his husband next to him. Seeing Regulus in Draco’s arms fills him with an indescribable emotion.
“You look fantastic, Harry. Malfoy’s not going to know what hit him.” She looks every inch a proud mother hen as she nods approvingly. She glances briefly down. “And it’s now 5 till, so go grab your things. He’ll be there to pick you up any minute.”
Ten years after the war and he still fights the beginning of a panic attack every time he has to cross that fucking Atrium to meet with Kingsley.
you bloody moron,” Malfoy snapped.
And yet — the thought of being with Draco is anything but.
“I never implied they weren’t,” Harry tells him steadily. “But I’m still glad I asked. I think it’s relevant information for the job.”
a voice that sounds like a suspicious mix of Ron’s and Hermione’s remarks in the back of his mind, but he shrugs it off. Harry’s in this cloakroom for a mundane, legitimate reason. He’s certain the stranger is not.
Draco had never encountered a Nanticoot in any of his lives, nor had he ever heard of the term. However, when in doubt, it was always best not to ask too many questions with Luna.
With a laugh, Harry reached out and plucked them from Malfoy’s long nose before removing his own.
Peering through the open door, they took in the quiet Library; the rows and rows of books, and a free table that seemed to be waiting for Harry and Draco. Harry pointed at it. With a playful little smile, he winked at Draco.
“Remind me what your intent was?” Draco growls, low and baleful.
Draco stares at him, blinking. His mouth twists in a sneer.
“They have conducted a post mortem of the whole Voldemort fiasco, you see. The general consensus is that Voldemort should have received more direct support from our higher-ups in the Hereafter instead of letting him run unchecked. You know as well as I do that the bosses hate to meddle with human evilness when it reaches such professional levels. But the lad had a lot of potential. He could have gone far. And to be defeated by—by a—“ Mephistopheles stuttered the words as though the very thought of them was repulsive. “—by a
“Alright. What’s your second condition?”
Draco dropped the act.
“This is what people get wrong the most, Draco. That even war survivors move on. It’s always there, written in our flesh, seared into our brains. But it’s not constant. There are minutes, hours, days even, when I forget. I don’t think the public will like to read this, but it’s true. I forget about the war, sometimes. My friends and I...we’re still here. Our plants keep growing, and life goes on.”
“I was what?” Harry asks softly. “Gay? Queer? I haven’t put a name on it yet. As I said, I only realised recently, due to a certain chain of events. Due to a certain someone.”
Harry’s certain that he’s not straight now, and it took Malfoy to reveal that foundational truth about himself. He’s not straight, and yet he doesn’t want to test that new knowledge with anybody else. He just wants to be… not straight with Malfoy.
Draco picked an almond. His fingertips brushed Harry’s palm. It was warm and soft, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat.
Then she bows a little, just enough to be courteous.
And that’s when Malfoy had up and left.
Harry throws himself in his path. “No! Draco, no. Please — just listen. You have to trust me. I made a promise. I’ll never deliberately hurt you again. Tell me you’ve heard this. Tell me you understand.”
“I’ll Levitate him,” she says, and murmurs
Night has fallen, but Harry only turns the light above the cooker hood on. The small lamp bathes the kitchen in a warm, low glow, the edges of the world blending in the dimness.

like that,” Harry said, fighting down a chuckle. There was something in Malfoy’s accusations… something almost
[Edited]
“Harry…” Draco murmurs, not knowing what else to say, as Harry lifts up on his knees, kisses his neck, licks into the dip above his collarbones as he unbuttons Draco's shirt. Harry’s fingers trace light lines along the patches of naked skin that he reveals with each button he undoes, sliding against the light hair scattered on Draco’s chest, catching on his nipples, on the ropey ridges of his scars. Draco whimpers, sinks his teeth into his bottom lip. Harry’s touch is lighting him on fire. It’s good — so good. And it shouldn’t be. Merlin, it shouldn’t be. Nobody has ever touched him there — touched him this way. His scars were still healing when he laid naked in Pansy’s and Blaise’s bed, all those years ago, and just brushing against them hurt. Astoria had loved him so much, but somehow she’d never managed to fall in love with that particular disfigurement of his.
At that, Hermione nods, her lip caught between her teeth. She touches Harry’s arm.
As much as it pains me to see a fellow Slytherin excluded from the fun, Draco, rules are rules: only the people present on that fateful night can play. Next time, please consider that, lest you get your BFF
PS: Well done, though. Potter looked
“And that’s your job.”
And it wasn’t just a blowjob.
Harry had imagined something… colder? Greener? Neater and perhaps a bit minimalistic? Something to match Malfoy’s cool, severe persona. Or perhaps the Slytherin cliché Harry had in his mind. Nothing like the pleasant, attractive space he’s standing in at the moment.
“I know how much it means to tell people,” Harry said softly. “I’m... touched. That you’ve told me.”
He’d felt so cared for.
“Not without saying goodbye.”
Wiggle out from under the covers, legs hanging on the side of the bed. Bedside table. Mummy and Daddy smile (at me) from inside the frame. They’re always the same, in the photograph. Daddy looks young. (His eyes joyous, bright.) (Sometimes I have to look away.) Mummy looks big, soft, happy. (Daddy says it’s because I was there, in her belly.)
In this chapter: Warning for mention of minor character death in childbirth (past).
Who else is giving you frights?”
Ron’s outburst causes the Petersons and a few other guests to cast scowling looks in his direction.
“You don’t need to,” Harry says. “He really is quite fit,” he grumbles under his breath, and Hermione’s giggles redouble.
Harry rolled his eyes good-naturedly. “Fine. Join us when you’re ready.”
Malfoy’s gaze flicks back to Harry’s face then, and for a long second Harry stares back, mesmerized. He’d played his next meeting with Malfoy in his head so many times in the past weeks. Now Malfoy’s here, and so is the opportunity to do something about it.
Ernestina has been thrown to the ground as well, whether by the force of the explosion or by her own presence of mind, Harry can’t tell. Scorpius doesn’t seem physically hurt. He’s completely quiet now, though, his eyes wide and unresponsive, and Harry’s scared, scared and helpless—
‘My weapon is the way I look at our time.’
“Chopin.”
Nothing
“I’m talking about your skipping classes, not about your having sex!” Hermione had said. Her face had softened at the thought. She’d looked from Draco to Harry with a smile. “Congratulations, by the way!”
but that would be a lie. He doesn’t know. He’ll figure it out, now that Draco’s let him in again.
He jogs down the corridor after the little boy.
Draco keeps his eyes on Harry, steady, as he shakes his head. He looks cornered. Frightened. Yet unwavering. He closes his eyes, and he’s still in Harry’s space, and Harry can see the way his long eyelashes fan over his cheekbones. There’s something painful in the pit of Harry’s stomach, and he has the sudden urge to reach out and run his thumb across those cheekbones, across the jut of Draco’s bottom lip. “I can’t…” Draco admits, barely a whisper in the hush of the room. “I can’t tell you.” He opens his eyes again, and his expression changes: no longer pained, but defiant, seeking Harry’s eyes. “Can you accept that?”
on my fucking dress!”
He leaned in and kissed Malfoy.
Draco looked up from the headphones at Harry. “Can I try?” He asked. The earnestness in his voice would have put any demon to shame.
Harry cocks his head. “You know, for a bloke who claims to be clever enough to teach
GOT ON HIS TIPTOES AND ALL!!!
“Everyone’s so used to the cold now, it’s become part of Hogwarts’s winter traditions. You know: Christmas pudding, glowing fir trees, enchanted ornaments everywhere, and then there’s also the occasional sneeze and runny nose.”
“Nothing.”
“Nobody could look that innocent and be entirely guiltless, Potter.”
Harry steps forward.
“I was just surprised,” Harry said. He looked embarrassed and Draco couldn’t fathom why. “A few years ago you would have never said that about her.”
Malfoy let out a soft snort of laughter. “You’re right.” His eyes flicked to Harry’s, almost shy. “I was just being… sentimental.”
“They can’t hear me,” Jeff said hastily. “You’re a demon, I’m a demonic pet, we can communicate.” He shook Draco’s bootlaces again. “C’mon, Draco, hurry! The ravens have been following me around. They know I'm helping you. You have to do something!”
“I’m going to suck you off,” Draco said quietly. It didn’t really need to be stated. He still loved the sound of the words coming from his mouth, dirty, filthy, grown-up. The opposite of
It’s a warning.
“Oh, this and that. Served my sentence after the war, got myself an entry-level clerk job at Gringotts, got married, climbed the corporate ladder, got promoted to director of the Asset Management branch, got divorced. I think that’s my last ten years in a nutshell.” Draco waved at a passing waiter, grabbed a fresh glass of champagne from his tray, and took a long sip before he noticed Potter staring at him insistently. “Yes?”
“What’s in it for you, Harry?” Draco asks. Harry is reminded of their first meeting, months ago. It felt like a different life, yet it all suddenly makes sense. The wariness. The suspicion. The questions.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, mate,” Ron had yelled in his ear while the conga line he led passed by Harry, “get yourself a drink and stop looking so dour!”
“Yes, Mister Potter. As I said, all I want is for you to take a moment to think of your future—the one that extends beyond the gates of our beloved castle, at least. Believe it or not, I consider what you’ve come up with so far as tremendous progress. I think, for the first time in your lives... you finally have the opportunity to make a choice purely for yourselves. You’re at the threshold of an exciting and decisive time of your lives, gentlemen. You might as well enjoy it.” She rose to her feet. “Now, if you will follow me, there is a very immediate and delicious future awaiting downstairs. I heard word from the Elves that the stuffed turkey and the chocolate and pear pudding are particularly spectacular this year. It wouldn’t do to let our Christmas feast go cold, would it?”
“Are you all right, Potter?” Draco glared at Harry over his shoulder. “You seem to be coming down with a cold. I’d offer you a lozenge, but I only have the ones for adults.”
Hands in each other’s hair, Harry licking hot and wet and soft inside Draco’s mouth, they stumble back a few steps. Draco feels it all with frightening clarity — the intimate light of his study, filtering through his closed eyelids; Harry’s hands, sliding down, cupping the sides of his neck; the taste of his lips, the heat of his breath hitting his face as he pulls back a second just to look at Draco’s face.
“If you’ll excuse me,” he says. He stalks inside before Harry can take his hand, and disappears through the French doors.
“Goodnight, Draco, sleep well,” his mother said, kissing his cheek as she passed by his armchair. “And you too, Harry.” Astonished, Draco watched Harry stand and Narcissa lift her head to peck him on the cheek. “Happy Christmas, dear,” she told him. “Take good care of my son.”
Harry had just smiled at him, one hand cupping his cheek. And Draco had understood.
“You’re a Tchaikovsky fan, I gather?” Malfoy asks.
“That’s not what I meant,” Harry snapped, defensive.
“But he said he’s going to work here,” Scorpius insists with surprising persistence. “Like Uncle Greg. You should call him Harry. Harry, Harry, Harry. Please, Daddy.”
Malfoy was staring at him with a look unlike anything he’d ever seen on his face. Eyes wide, mouth slack and throat working, Malfoy’s usual eloquence had evaporated only to leave, in its place—something that looked like
He decided he must have imagined the noise and fell back against the pillow.
But Harry only has three days left now, and he feels his hopes grow thinner by the minute. He waits until Scorpius has climbed the last front steps and closes the door behind them.
“I lied,” Malfoy admits, so low Harry has to strain to hear. “You can experiment with me.” He meets Harry’s eyes straight on, and there’s something both resolved and supplicant in them. “You can experiment with me all you like.”
“You said you had one last question.” Luna’s dreamy voice brought him back. Her right hand hung from her side, her fingers stroking the leaves of the Asphodel like she would a pet.
“Back there, when that Cavendish fellow assaulted you. He’s a Muggle, isn’t he? You could have used magic to escape.”
And now the little boy was in front of Harry’s table, even more flustered than he was a moment before. Draco heard him say: “Harry Potter.” His voice trembled with awe and admiration. “The Headmistress said you’re also expected in her office.”
Cheers,
The truth stumbles from Harry’s mouth before he can stop it. He can feel Malfoy’s grin against his ear.
“Did you bring the receipt form?” he asks, all professional calm.
“No,” Draco whispered, “I’m making you feel
You’re asking difficult questions.
“Yeah? Did you imagine it? You and me?” Harry asks, panting, rocking into his own fist and bringing Draco closer to the edge with each pump, each question. “Naked, fucking on your sofa like a pair of randy teenagers?”
“That’s it, Harry, deep breaths. You're doing so well.”
“Would the magic necessary to support a male pregnancy and form the womb and canal be enough to cause that level of strain?”
The dildo shines as he coats it generously with lube, touching the bottom of the base to activate the built-in charms. He lets go and it hovers next to him.
Albus heaves a deep sigh. “Okay.”
“So many Gryffindors,” Draco mutters.
“Are you all right, love?”
“We can still have plenty of sex. We can always come home for a quickie at lunch if you can’t make it all day.” Harry winks at Draco and laughs at the man’s intrigued expression. “I’m anxious to get back to our new project, but I’ll miss being with you all day.”
from the cork of another phial of potion and a cool rag on the back of his neck. “I’ve got another potion for you as soon as you think you can manage it, love.”
James is nodding in understanding. “Because the womb forms between the back of the stomach and the rectum, right?”
“Really?”
They'd both come from such different circumstances to arrive at the same point. Harry married for love, not an heir, and he was married for almost seven years. But he was still a bit blindsided by everything at the coffee shop that day.
“I know. But this is different.”
Draco covers Harry’s mouth with his own and kisses him lazily, hands on Harry’s hips. “Merlin, I missed you. I feel utterly ridiculous saying that. It was less than twenty-four hours, but I missed you.”
“Oh Draco, do you have any idea what you’re doing to me?” he whispers breathily, deciding to do it anyway.
Draco’s face is pensive. “Would you help me ward one if I pick one out today? Maybe one for Scorpius, also?”
“We are,” Draco confirms, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist.
“We’re getting married Saturday evening. We decided we wanted to be bonded as husbands before this little one makes an appearance.”
“Scorpius, please step up here.” Draco looks tenderly at his son.
Draco’s laugh is somehow amused and exasperated all at once. “So you’ll stay home?”
“I think she thought that would get me to somehow decide to be straight. But I just went upstairs and called James.” He sighs. “I’m
“All right.” Harry eases away from Draco and picks up his wand. Seeing no sense in putting a stasis over the mess he’s created, he resets his Magiscope for tomorrow and wards his station. Gathering his jacket, he turns to join Draco and they head for the door. “How did you even know I was still here?”
Harry files that bit of information away before he continues. “I like handjobs, but not too rough. I like having my bollocks played with. With hands or mouth, actually.”
Draco’s cheeks pink and Harry kisses him quickly.
“I’m so glad you’re all right. I was so scared I was going to lose you, or the baby, or
Taking the proffered flowers, he moves swiftly to place them on the countertop and turns back to Draco. Harry is unprepared for the look Draco is giving him. It seems almost adoring.
“Harry?” Draco’s sleepy voice precedes him. He pads through the doorway as Harry continues to heave. “Oh, love.” His voice is immediately sympathetic.
Heading to the street, Scorpius and Albus come with Harry and Draco while James and Matthew take Lily. Making their way into Wand and Wood, Harry spots Bernice behind the service counter again.
Draco’s mouth finds his and he’s kissed sweetly once more before sleep finds them both, right there in front of the fire.
“Would core strain or damage cause nausea and vomiting with excessive fatigue?”
. “There’s a wide variety that can be used alone or with a partner. Using a mix of fingers and toys before you move on can help.”
Harry breathes deeply and takes a moment to organise his thoughts. He wants to make sure he communicates everything clearly, and that seems more difficult given his proximity to Draco. “I’ve never done casual well. I’m sure it won’t surprise you to know that I rarely do things halfway.”
“No, you’re not. Not even a little bit,” Draco replies, rolling his eyes.
Harry reaches over and takes Draco’s hand, squeezing gently.
“You’ve not had your life to yourself since you were eleven, Harry,” Hermione reminds him.
“That’s when I figured out I really fancied you.”
“No. Just a big stretch and some burning. I’m ok. You’re just…” Harry huffs. “You’ve got a big cock, Draco. I’ll be fine once I get adjusted.” Draco laughs softly and leans forward, kissing Harry, tongue dipping into his mouth.
“Sweet Merlin,” Malfoy breathes, “I had no idea. That’s inexcusable. I mean, I wondered why Albus had never said anything around our place about his grandparents, but there are not grandparents in our situation either, so it was never something that was a topic of discussion.”
“We will ensure your privacy and safety.”
, Harry! He’s almost here!” Harry opens his eyes to look back at Draco. “Push, Harry. Let’s meet our son.”
“Wonderfully, actually.” Draco snuggles closer, and Harry happily wraps an arm around him. “Last night was brilliant, but waking up next to you might be even better.”
Harry shifts off Draco, who immediately stands and helps him to his feet. He’s not entirely steady, but Draco guides him to the bed, pulls back the covers, and tucks him in. Draco stretches out a hand and
“Press down lightly, Mr Malfoy. My fingers will apply pressure from underneath and you should be able to feel a hard, round mass about the size of your palm. That’s the womb.”
“He’s right, Harry,” Hermione has her information-delivering face on. “Pregnancy taxes a witch’s body as much as doing high-endurance sports every day. It’s even more demanding on a wizard’s body. And it taxes your magic on top of your physical self. It’s quite fascinating.”
Draco strides to the coffee table and picks up the DVDs, handing one to Harry. “I thought this sounded good. Shall I put the others back on the shelf?
Draco hurries into the hallway and Harry suspects he’ll be back in less than ten minutes with far more resources than he asked for.
“He’s come ‘round under the stasis. Are we ready to lift it?”
“Thank Merlin.”
A bright burst of light illuminates the length of the string of magic, setting their skin aglow where it rests.
Hermione’s eyebrows lift. “Oh? What did you watch?”
Draco’s eyes widen in absolute horror and he covers one of Harry’s hands with his own as his words come tumbling out. “Fuck, Harry. I didn’t know. I’m so sorry. I’d never have brought it up so casually if I’d known. I didn’t mean to upset you.”
“She is, isn’t she?” Harry takes the letter from Draco as he’s feeding Cupcake several owl treats. Unsealing the parchment, Harry looks down and frowns.
Draco. He still sounds so scared.
“Hmmm. Let’s check your canal, then. I want to make sure this little one isn’t trying to make an early exit.” She peels back the blankets and casts a relaxing charm. “Leg up for me, please.”
“Go on, Scorp,” Draco encourages. “Take Al and go see what you like. Come get Harry and me when you’ve settled on a couple of options.”
“Dad? You ok?”
There’s a responding kick and then the firm press of a foot. James presses his mouth to Matthew’s ear and Harry pretends not to overhear the whispered words, even though he does.
“I want something that’s meaningful to me,” Harry says emphatically. This much he
Of all the scenarios Draco and Harry have discussed, their children pushing them to move faster and get married has not been among them. Anger? Yes. Disapproval? Absolutely. Straight up rebellion? Also considered. But not this.
“The brightest star in my constellation is Etamin. The heart of the dragon.” Draco places a hand against his chest. “It’s a red star, so my stone is a ruby.”
Harry looks back at him, unsure what to say.
“I’m really glad you’re happy, Dad. We were all kind of worried about you being alone when we all went to Hogwarts.”
Is that shock or surprise in Draco’s voice? It’s so much harder to tell without seeing his face. At least it doesn’t sound like he’s upset or put off by it.
Harry nods. “That’s a starting point, at least.”
“Okay. We’ll work on that. I love you, Albus. I don’t want you to feel like this all the time.”
Draco looks curiously at Harry. “Not going back to the Aurors, then?”
“I know!” Draco chuckles, “and I’m happier about that than I could ever put into words. Still a lot of lions!”
His balls are drawing up and tightening and Harry feels his orgasm rising in his belly. “
Healer Carr cracks a rare smile. “Here we go then.”
“Draco and I are adults in a loving and committed relationship. We express that love and commitment in a variety of ways, including sex.”
“And your housing. And your living expenses,” Draco adds. “Same for Albus and Scorpius and Lily. And Regulus, when he’s old enough. Provided, of course, that you all work to your potential in the chosen course of study.”
“I want to protest, but I’m getting concerned, too. This isn’t normal for me.” Harry really doesn’t want to see a Healer, but he also can’t keep this up.
“Merlin, yes, Draco.”
“Would you let the owl in?”
Harry’s tears spill over when Regulus gives a tiny wiggle in his belly.
“True.” Harry returns his head to Draco’s chest. “We should figure out some food before our children decide they will starve.”
“Oh?” Harry’s heart lifts at the news. This project has been particularly important to him, and he’s so pleased that they’re making progress.
“Ready for more?”
“We know. But we’re thinking about University.” Matthew appears hesitant but then goes on. “I’ve always wanted to go for law. I’d like to be a prosecutor, I think.”
Confusion is written all over Hermione’s face. “He what?”
“We’re not.”
“Potter!”
“Harry. You look pregnant because you
“Don’t ask questions, Harry.”
“Ready to get married?” Harry finally asks.
He buries his nose in the crook of Draco’s neck and lets out a soft, contented “hmmm.” He feels Draco’s hand lift from his back to card into his hair. Soft, gentle strokes nearly make him melt. He presses lightly into the touch and Draco chuckles softly.
Harry feels complete for the first time in a very long time.
“You’d better,” Draco grins back.
“He’d better hold off until at least Sunday,” Draco mutters.
want you to come to us with any questions. We will always be open with you.”
“How can you tell?”
Harry settles himself flat and exposes his abdomen as Healer Powell conjures a bubble. The cold potion on his stomach sends shivers down his body, but his eyes are locked on that bubble, hand clinging tight to Draco’s.
“No. I really can’t. Some days it feels like I’ve been pregnant forever, but really, it’s all gone so fast.” Harry looks down at his belly. “I still can’t believe I’m lucky enough to have a child with you.”
James whirls to face him, grapes forgotten. Harry looks past James into the living room where Draco stands, watching them with a contented smile.
“Very well.” She dons gloves and pulls back the covers. “Can you feel where the baby is sitting?”
A few minutes later, Harry stands in front of the bathroom sink, dressed in the clothes he’s already selected. He runs some Sleekeazy’s through his dark curls and looks in the mirror.
Reaching under his belly, Harry gently eases Draco’s mouth away from his cock. “Love, I’ll cum if you keep that up, and I’d rather do that when you’re inside me.”
“No, it wasn’t you. I’m having pain again. How long did I sleep?”
“Ok, are we ready to head out? The Malfoys are coming with us.”
“I know. That’s what I’m worried about.”
Harry sighs softly. “I’m still scared. Being pregnant is overwhelming at best and terrifying at worst.”
“What about you?”
“That was it? For the entire night?” Hermione prods.
“I’m sure you’ve abandoned poor pregnant me for my best friend,” Harry says, rolling his eyes.
“At the risk of being overly forward in public, I know we’ve discussed it and we intend to get married in a year or so, but how soon do you want to be engaged?” Draco wraps one arm around Harry’s waist and takes his left hand gently in the other, tracing a path with his thumb over Harry’s finger where his engagement ring would sit. “Because I can’t help imagining sliding that ring onto your finger, and it’s wonderful.”
“I mean, if we decide this is going to be serious and long term, we need to tell the kids before we’re out publicly as a couple. I don’t want them to find out from the press.”
He’d sent a text and less than an hour later, Draco was leading him into an upscale clothing store. Harry had surrendered himself and given the man free reign dressing him. Draco had taken full advantage, pulling a wide variety of clothing, and Harry had obediently tried it on, enjoying the way Draco’s eyes appraised him while evaluating the clothes. Several hours later, he walked away with a sizable work-appropriate wardrobe and an outfit for the interview.
All four kids make for the stairs, snagging their shrunken trunks on the way.
The young man nods. “I will.”
“No, Harry. It’s not that at all. I just…Salazar, yes. I’d love nothing more.” He smiles wryly. “It’s just been a long time.”
“A little bit.”
They pause just outside the door and Draco sweeps his gaze over Harry, studying his face carefully. Harry squirms slightly under the scrutiny, but Draco seems to have found whatever he was looking for and nods. “There's a fantastic little Indian restaurant just past my building. Is that an acceptable lunch option?”
Draco’s smile says what Harry needs to know before he answers and relief floods him.
Harry smiles in return. “I was actually about to go run some errands around town when I got your reply. I wondered if you wanted to go look at televisions today?”
She nods.
“I still miss the Ron I thought I knew. But he wanted me to choose between you and his family, Harry, and that wasn’t okay.” Hermione’s eyes take on a bit of a shine. “I know it was his grief. He never fully processed losing Fred, and he was much closer to Ginny. But that doesn’t make it ok.”
“Very well.” Harry tries desperately to interpret the Healer’s expression but he can figure out nothing.
“But…” Matthew appears gobsmacked.
“Did you feel him?”
“Ready?” He smiles at Draco.
in public without causing a commotion.” Harry shrugs one shoulder. “So we splurged a little on this.”
Room complete, several hours later, they stand together in the doorway.
“You have to sanitise your wand before and after,” Draco adds. “There’s a potion specifically to do that. It can be store-bought, but I can brew you some.”
“So that’s a no.” Harry slides his finger over. “I don’t like Cygnus.”
Harry draws Draco close, pulling him under the stream of water and lifting his mouth for a kiss.
Four pairs of eyes are staring at them as they reach the living room.
“Well,” Harry huffs a laugh, “Hermione helped.”
“Yeah,” Al says with a reluctant sigh.
you must know how good you look in those trousers!”
“One…two…three…four…” Draco’s counting is audible to only himself and Harry. “five…si—”
Draco’s soft hands wipe his face once more. “Have you got any anti-nausea potion in the house?”
The kiss makes Harry weak at the knees. Through it, he feels not only his magic contentedly running alongside Draco’s, but also a pulse of what he can only describe as love rushing through him.
“Hello, Harry. How was your New Year’s?” She hugs him back.
Harry certainly knows that feeling. He suppresses a chuckle. “When did you figure out you weren’t ok with it?”
There’s a soft “pop” and then the smell of something citrusy reaches Harry’s nose. Draco shifts and two warm, slick hands are on Harry’s shoulders. Draco’s thumbs work into the muscles at Harry’s shoulders. He groans.
“I used to bring Scorpius here in the summers,” Draco says, almost wistfully. “He would play on the playground, and we’d eat ice cream and ride the Eye. We were just people here, not Malfoys.”
Agonisingly slowly, Harry is being filled. He closes his eyes and gives himself over to the fantasy from his dreams.
“Wow, James.” Harry blinks to clear his head.
“You’ve certainly kept that quiet,” Malfoy intones carefully. There's a carefully controlled edge of something in Malfoy's voice. Not anger, exactly.
Harry reaches for the warded drawer again and pulls out a long, thick, very realistic dildo.
Draco immediately wraps his arms around him as they land, rubbing his back until the world rights. He steps back and Draco looks him over carefully.
“Sort of. I love Draco romantically, like I loved your mum. But it’s also different with him — good different. We are at a different point in life than your mum and I were, so it’s not going to be the same.”
, and Harry doesn’t want this evening to end.
“Thank you.” Harry works to rein in his emotions before he cries over having Hermione’s support.
Draco’s hand presses softly and his face falls. “I don’t feel anything.”
Harry walks down the hall towards Gemma’s desk and, while her desk is empty, the reception area is not. Draco is sitting in a chair, mobile in hand, eyes pointed down at the screen.
“I don’t know. I’ve told him I like the man he has become. We talked through all the war shite at our first tea, apologies and forgiveness were given. But I haven’t been…overly flirtatious?”
“You’re home.”
“Ready?”
Harry’s name falls from his lips, repeatedly, and then Harry is being filled as Draco empties inside him.
“I’m thinking we should give Matthew his own room. I know he’ll probably continue to sleep in James’ bed, and I’m fine with that. Otherwise, they’re just going to sneak around. But he needs his own space so he can process or think if he needs to, and so he knows his welcome isn’t tied to James. I don’t see them splitting up — but just in case.”
There’s no stopping the grin that spreads on Harry’s face. “Then, yes. Same page.” He feels tension go out of Draco underneath him and finds himself pulled tighter into Draco’s chest. It’s clearly a relief for both of them. “Do you
“Healer Powell?” He doesn’t bother opening his eyes.
“We’ll manage. At least we can do other things.” Draco leans over to kiss him on the cheek.
between them.
He kisses her on the cheek before setting her down. “Have you got all your things?”
“Just Draco.”
Breaking the kiss gently, Harry pulls back and takes in Draco’s wide pupils and kiss-swollen lips. Draco furrows his brows and Harry smiles.
“That sounds good.”
“Sweet Merlin,” Draco murmurs. “Harry, we’re having a baby.”
Sliding a hand around to rest on Harry’s abdomen, Draco sighs contentedly.
Healer Carr’s fingers slide in and she makes an approving noise. “You’re most definitely labouring, Mr Potter. The opening to your canal is dilating and your membrane is stretching. Your anus isn’t really dilating yet, so still early on, but you are indeed in labour.”
But everything else about these three weeks with all four kids home has been wonderful. There have been squabbles, but overall, the blending of their two families had gone remarkably well. Christmas was exactly as Harry prefers it: loud and full of love and laughter. The children had all gone together and gotten their dads matching plush bathrobes. Scorpius and Lily had both been over the moon to get the mobiles Harry and Draco had picked out, Al and James were thrilled with their new brooms, and Harry was just happy to have them all together.
Malfoy hesitates and runs a hand through his short blond hair, standing some of it on end. His gaze shifts away beyond Harry to look at something across the room. He seems a bit uneasy as he speaks again.
The younger three children join Harry and Draco in the living room, where Harry knows he must attempt to explain what’s happened with Matthew to three children who have never known there is something a child could do to “deserve” the rejection of their parents. This is, by far, one of the most challenging parenting moments he’s ever had.
“Can we help you two with something?” Draco smiles easily at them both.
His afternoon with Draco allowed him to put off this moment, but now he has no choice but to figure out who he is now— eleven years later with all three kids off to Hogwarts. That particular bit of self-discovery will have to wait until later, however, because what he is now is hungry.
“And so you shall.” Hermione looks at Harry fondly. “We should make a list of what needs to be done. I can even take the rest of the week off work if you’d like. I have almost five months of vacation time backlogged. They can allow me a few days.”
thing in the way.”
“It’s been a lot to absorb, but we’re figuring it out.”
“Yep. Here we go,” Draco sighs.
Harry slides a hand between them to wrap around his own cock, tugging to match the rhythm of Draco’s cock in his arse. “Harder,” he gasps.
“Can you do anything for the nausea he’s having?” Draco asks. “And is anti-nausea potion safe?”
Harry arches an eyebrow at Draco. “Are you calling Hermione a swot? Or are you calling yourself a swot?”
her sparkle quills in that pit she calls a bedroom. He will find them, of course, and send them to her anyway.
“Draco.” He tries to speak louder without further upsetting his teetering stomach. “I need help.”
“Good afternoon, Mr Potter!” Healer Carr bustles in and begins her usual set up. “How are you feeling?”
Healer Carr nods and begins her usual casting. “I’ll explain as I go, then, James. And you can ask questions so long as your dad is okay with that.”
“I have no doubt.” Draco hands Harry a bottle of wine before shrugging out of his jacket. “I still occasionally get unwanted attention courtesy of that time of our life. I imagine it is much worse for you.”
“You’ll tell me if something is uncomfortable? Or you don’t like it?” Draco gazes at his eyes intently and waits for an answer.
“Are you having sex?”
“Yeah.”
“Of course I do,” Harry says, shaking his head. “Come on. I’m starving.”
“You scared me. You went absolutely white,” Draco murmurs.
“I don’t think it’s necessary to wait any longer. Healer Powell will be waiting for you. You’ll have a baby in a few hours’ time.”
“Matthew and I aren’t having sex. Yet.” James’s cheeks flush red. “But we’ve done some other things. And I’ve been pretty sure for a while that I’ll want to bottom, but now I’m scared I’ll end up like Dad.”
“Not in as many words. But basically, yes.” Harry rolls his eyes. Lily, as always, had not been shy in telling Harry exactly what she thought about the baby situation. She’s extremely excited to be a big sister, but she had no qualms in telling Harry she wanted it to be a boy because she liked being the only girl.
“When I came out as gay to my mother, I already knew I intended to marry a woman and father a child to continue our lineage. I was literally doing the ‘straight’ thing, even though Astoria and I both knew we would split amicably after I had a son. My mother still flew into a complete rage. Her reaction was no one’s fault but hers. The same goes for the McLellands. Their reaction is on them. Not you.”
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice calls up the stairs. “Are you nearly ready?”
“I’ll be okay.”
“It is. Help me up? I need to Floo Minerva and see if she’s free Saturday. And probably call Hermione.”
“That’s appropriate. It also means we are fresh out of bedrooms for Regulus, so I’ll start calling contractors tomorrow.”
“Caramel Cortado, please.” Harry smiles at the barista and reaches for his wallet. Draco’s hand on his arm makes him pause.
Draco kisses Harry lightly before rolling to his back. He gathers Harry against him and Harry willingly stretches out against him, head on Draco’s chest.
“Okay. Matthew is here, he upstairs with James. He—”
“I’ll be right here.”
“Mm-hmm?”
Draco takes Harry at his word and slides the dildo almost all the way out before thrusting it back in, hard and quick, over and over again. Harry rocks his hips back to meet each press. He’s close. So fucking close. He frees one arm and reaches for his cock while Draco continues to slam the toy into him and he pulls once, twice, three times before he comes, shouting Draco’s name and shaking with his release.
Tears spring to Harry’s eyes, and he squeezes Draco’s hand, looking over at him. Draco’s eyes are also bright.
Harry’s heart feels like it’s in a vice. He certainly hadn’t intended to get pregnant, but now that he knows there’s a part of Draco growing inside him, he wants this baby. He’d be devastated if there was a problem. Draco squeezes his hand, and he nods to the healer.
a teenager.”
“You’re engaged!” She turns to hug Draco who looks positively stunned to be hugged by one Hermione Granger.
Draco tries and fails to suppress his laughter, shaking his head.
Blinking and forcing himself out of his own head, Harry smiles, “It is. Only half regulation, but it serves the purpose. Do you want to walk down and have a look?”
“I’d never let you hear the end of it if I found out from the Prophet!” Hermione pauses and narrows her eyes, looking at Harry more closely. “Are you not feeling well?”
“Well. That’s a big step.” Harry scans the letter again.
Harry wraps his arm around Draco’s and feels that familiar pull behind his navel.
Draco chuckles.
“You’re welcome.” He climbs back into bed and Harry snuggles against him. A soft kiss drops into his hair, and Harry smiles softly.
Scorpius and Al shuffle over beside her, each taking a turn and receiving their own swift kicks and grinning in response.
“While you all were on the pitch.”
“Life felt awfully cruel for a really long time, and I don’t know if it’s luck or fate or just the way things go, but I’m grateful for it, whatever it is. You, and Regulus, and our kids…this life is what my soul was too afraid to hope for.”
“Tell me if I’m hurting you, ok?”
Draco quickly realises Harry isn’t beside him, though, and spins around. “Harry?”
Draco’s hold on Harry tightens. “That’s…that’s disgusting. That on top of the cooking and everything else.”
Somehow, they both manage to drag themselves from bed and tug on their discarded pants before making their way into the kitchen. Harry snuggles against Draco’s chest as they wait for the coffee to brew. Draco smells of sex and Harry’s bedsheets, and he finds that incredibly enticing. A gentle hand comes to lift his chin, grey eyes shining with affection as Draco kisses him full on the mouth.
He doesn’t stop, and it only takes a single brush at just the right angle against Harry’s prostate for him to be spilling all over the shower wall. Draco moans against his back and his thrusts lose their rhythm as Harry pulses around him.
“Are you and Draco going to get married soon?”
“I love you.”
right.
“I’m not sure what you mean?”
“They are rather relentless.” Minerva shakes her head. “They were insufferable for several days after James and Mister McLelland were spotted as a couple in Hogsmeade.”
“It certainly seems awful.”
A couple of moments and some deep breaths later, Harry stands upright. James watches carefully until he’s sure his father is steady on his feet, then releases his waist.
“Oh, you nuisance of a bird!” Draco growls, finally freeing the rolled missive.
He struggles to rein in his breathing before sighing softly. It may have been a dream, but his cock certainly missed the memo. Fully hard and pulsing, it is begging for the attention it had been receiving in dreamland. Harry shimmies out of his boxers and begins to stroke himself lightly.
“I’ll be fine, Al. Just some kind of stomach bug or something. I’m sure I’ll feel better tomorrow.” Harry frowns. “I’m sorry I can’t see you four off at the station.”
Draco quirks an eyebrow at Harry.
As soon as they hear the Floo, Draco is stripping and sliding into bed next to Harry. Draco’s body winds around his and Harry settles his back against the blond’s chest. A hand snakes around to lie protectively over their son, and they both drift off to sleep.
A deep rumbling laugh comes from Draco.
“They always do.”
“Oh yes…” Draco’s voice is breathy and filled with need.
“Nnngh.” Harry can’t bite back his moan as Draco’s finger slides inside. “Yes, Draco. Godric, I love having any part of you inside me.”
“Lots of pressure?”
Draco bursts out laughing. Harry is torn between being upset and offended. He wasn’t expecting Draco to
“Pack what you need to stay, Draco.” Harry wasn’t planning on having this conversation now, but he’s also not anxious about it. He knows what he wants. “I know we still have everything to work through with the kids, but I want you here. We can worry about the details and logistics after the kids know. But for now, I just…I want you to stay. Every night. For as long as you want to.”
“He’s crowning, Harry. This is the worst of it. Push through it!”
“Even James and Scorp and Lil?”
The water runs momentarily in the sink and then Draco is kneeling next to him, damp flannel and a glass of water in hand. Draco flushes away the sick and gently wipes his face.
“Merlin, Harry,” Draco breathes, his voice laced with awe, making Harry blush. “You look fantastic like this.
“Something like that.” Harry laughs. If only Draco knew how much he was the catalyst for Harry’s procrastination. “But writing to you was far more interesting than anything I found in the Prophet today.” Harry sobers and sighs softly.
“Kind of worried?” Harry raises an eyebrow at his son.
“We also need to get a couple of things sorted out.” Matthew’s attention turns to Draco as he speaks. “Do you have a Gringotts vault?”
“If you’re able, I would recommend taking your pain potion to take the edge off and walk, just as much as you can possibly stand. The potion is safe until your water breaks. Keep someone with you, as you’ll probably have to pause and lean on them when your contractions really begin to intensify. I’ll come at least every hour and check on you. If your water breaks, go immediately to the Male Pregnancy Unit. I’ll alert Healer Powell that you’re in labour.”
“You look to be about four weeks pregnant. It’s the equivalent of about six weeks in a female pregnancy. Let’s see if we can find a heartbeat.” Healer Carr waves her wand at the bubble and then presses it to Harry’s abdomen. The soft swishing of a fetal heartbeat fills the room.
“Right this way.” Erwin moves behind the counter and shows them to a display of rings with a variety of gemstones and styles. Harry steadfastly ignores the photographers now pressed up against the glass window at the front of the store. This will certainly make the papers.
“Well, I think you should get married soon.” Lily's authoritative air means she clearly finds this to be important.
Soft laughter escapes Hermione’s mouth and she shakes her head. “And he went home after that?”
“Go on and get your trunks to your rooms! Then I want to hear all about the end of term. Especially from you two!” Harry gestures at Matthew and James, who have just completed their O.W.L.s.
Matthew nods, and Harry calls James over.
“Fuck’s sake, Al! Let your dad talk!” Scorpius is clearly fed up with Anxious Albus. James and Lily are both rolling their eyes, so clearly this has been going on for a while. Harry can only imagine how bad he was at school before they headed home.
“Well, nothing overly concerning, but your body is starting to feel some of the ramifications of supporting a pregnancy.” She moves to place hands over Harry’s womb, pressing gently and showing just a hint of a smile as Regulus pushes back. “Wizards don’t have hips to speak of, not like a witch does, so your body doesn’t have the ability to flex and give the baby a wider base of support. Your back and hips are doing what they need to do, but it’s a lot to ask of a body that wasn’t designed to carry.”
James’ face loses its scowl, and he nods silently before turning his attention to Draco as he picks up where Harry left off.
Hermione’s laugh fills the room. “Of course.” She stoops to hug Harry briefly. “I told Draco they’re sure to come up with something sordid.”
“Then how would it be your fault?” Harry is not following James’ train of thought. He watches his son’s face form into something resembling determination.
“Yes, love?”
“Liga eam in corpus, mens, magicae et amorem.”
Malfoy’s mouth falls open the slightest bit and he quickly drops his gaze. Long moments pass as he takes several deep breaths and firmly sets his jaw. His head raises slowly to lock grey eyes to green once again.
“That’s ridiculous! Why wo—”
“He’s still head down, which is good. If you watch, he’s practising his breathing. See his little lungs expand and contract?”
Suddenly, Harry is empty, but before he’s given time to complain there’s the delicious stretch of two fingers breaching his entrance. Draco strokes his prostate again as he eases both fingers in and gently stretches Harry open.
Twenty-four hours ago, he had no idea he wanted a baby with Draco. And now…Harry lifts his hand to rest low on his muscled abdomen. The mix of emotions, and the speed at which he has travelled through them, begins leaking from his eyes. He lies there, hand splayed over their baby, and lets the tears flow.
“Harry, do you freely give your love to Draco, to be bonded to him in body, magic, and soul for the rest of eternity?
“We would love that.” Draco’s voice is thick. Harry can do little more than nod in confirmation. Healer Carr’s wand begins to move again and she stops to highlight and measure tiny arms and spine and legs, before settling on the area in question.
“Ten! Nine!” the children all chorus together.
“Probably. Nothing official yet, of course, but I think a core stabilisation potion before neutralising the malevolent magic would probably be the best course of action. The research they gave us at the case briefing showed that stasis magic doesn’t hold the core well.”
. But it also feels like some sort of twisted reparation.” Draco’s gaze becomes distant. “I acknowledge who I was and who my parents were, and then my atonement is who I have become.”
Dinner eaten and remnants vanished, Harry lifts a hand to extinguish the lights. A sweet goodnight kiss and Harry finds himself gathered into Draco’s arms as Draco fits himself to Harry’s back. He drifts off to sleep wishing he could fall asleep like this every night.
“Me, too.”
“Harry.” Draco’s voice cuts him off.
Harry shakes his head and turns to slice the bread. “No. I was told I could return, but I don’t want a job that puts my kids at risk of losing their only remaining parent. Especially given the family circumstances, it’s just not wise. So I’ll be looking for something new.”
“When are you going to let
“What?!” Clearly, Draco has missed the connection. When in need of knowledge, recruit Hermione.
Draco lazily lifts his wand and the wireless begins to play the same song they’d danced to in the living room, the first night they’d made love.
“I took a dose when we went to bed.”
“We are, Daddy. We want you to finally be happy. You’ve smiled more since we got home than you did the whole month before we left. I like that.”
Harry is slightly taken aback by James’ choice of words but can’t help being amused at Draco’s gasp. He’d warned his fiancé that his kids were incredibly blunt about sex, and James had certainly driven that point home.
“I do.”
Harry can’t resist sticking his tongue out her before joining Draco in grinning broadly.
“Before the end of the school year?” Draco asks.
“Almost two hours.” Draco shakes his head fondly. “And this just came.” He holds up several sheets of parchment. “We have guardianship of Matthew. His parents didn’t even protest, the arseholes.”
“I’m at a good stopping point.” Draco stands and offers Harry a hand. “Why don’t we go downstairs, and you can get comfortable in the bedroom while I’ll make a quick cup of tea for us before she comes?”
“Thank fuck.” Draco’s lips are back on Harry’s as he slides slowly out until his head pulls against Harry’s rim, then thrusts gently back in, setting a slow, deep rhythm. Harry’s nerves are ablaze with pleasure as each press in gets easier. Draco shifts as he begins to move faster and Harry yelps.
“Harder,” he urges Draco. “So close.”
“What time is it?”
Draco grumbles but acquiesces. “I know you’re right but my cock doesn’t share the sentiment.”
Harry eyes Malfoy speculatively, trying to decide how much to let out. “This is not public. I worked to keep it quiet and I would like it to stay that way.”
“I’d rather Side-Along, you’ll just have to hold me up when we land.”
Head still in his hands, Harry takes a deep breath and lets it out. He looks up at Hermione and smiles wryly. “There was a lot of hand-brushing in the popcorn bowl. By the end, we were on opposite ends of the couch but our feet were touching in the middle.”
“Harry, do you take Draco to be your lawfully wedded husband wherever life may take you?”
“Does everything look all right?” Draco inquires.
to buttoning?”
Harry wraps an arm around Draco’s waist and feels Draco’s arm slip around his own. He looks to Draco’s face.
“We took another core imaging before we brought you ‘round. It looks good. Your core is awfully powerful, Mr Potter. I think it saved you both.”
The kids all pile onto the couch and four pairs of eyes are staring at Harry and Draco expectantly.
“Mina said sometimes she hears her parents making noise in their bedroom and she thinks they’re having sex.” Lily’s nose scrunches up. “I don’t want to hear you and Draco, Dad. I know it’s normal and all that, but I don’t want to think about you and Draco doing…that.”
“Are you sure?”
“It will become less of an issue when you turn seventeen, but you’re welcome here until you finish Hogwarts and beyond.” Draco gives Matthew an encouraging smile. “We’ll cross all those bridges as we come to them.”
“Dad!” he gasps.
Harry turns with a grin at the pop of Draco Apparating into the living room.
“But you like me this way.” Harry loses his battle to keep a straight face when he catches Draco waggling his eyebrows at him.
Harry obligingly stands while Hermione looks him over. Her hand appears in the Floo and she spins one finger, so he rotates in a circle for her, as well.
“Come on, love. Wake up.” Draco’s voice is soft and amused.
“Of course, love.” Draco retrieves his mobile from the dresser and kisses him quickly. “Have a good nap. I’ll come down with a dose as soon as it’s done. I love you.”
doesn’t enjoy it.
The door to the loo clicks open and Harry turns, seeing Hermione’s face break into a grin. She crosses and wraps her arms around him.
James lifts his box from the dresser and disappears into the hall.
“You didn’t mean to get pregnant.”
“That’s a relief to hear. Though I’d still like to see it.”
“Is your experimental repair potion project going better? You seem less frustrated than yesterday,” Harry asks as they join the queue for the indoor Apparition point. Less frustrated is an understatement, as Draco had been ranting before they even reached the elevators the previous two days.
“I don’t know. But if we don’t try, we’ll both die.”
“Movie!” Lily screeches and dashes out of the room and makes for the stairs. Everyone sits in confused silence for a moment before Scorpius pipes up.
“Hmm?” Harry's consciousness stretches towards Draco’s voice, struggling to form words. The world around him moves slowly, through a thick fog. He’s aware of Draco’s voice and Healer Carr’s, but he can’t make sense of the words.
“I think that’s best.” Harry knows all four kids will have questions he might not want to answer, but he knows he will anyway. “I also want them to have some time to process the news. They’ll have to stay quiet about it at school until we’re public, and they’re already sitting on our engagement.”
Harry carefully shrugs off her hand. He doesn’t particularly like to be touched by people he doesn’t know well, and Claire has tended to be a bit…handsy, for lack of a better word. He moves away from her, closer to her Magiscope, and presses his eyes to the eyepiece. He’s studying a particularly tight tangle of magic when he feels a hand resting on his back. He shrugs the hand off and slides his wand into the Magiscope to gently prod at a particularly ambiguous-looking spell.
“Thank you for letting them come for the weekend.”
Bursting out laughing, Harry puts a hand to the small of Draco’s back and gently propels him forward. “What can I say? Gin and I both loved Quidditch and when we built this house, I still couldn’t set foot
Draco looks at Harry who turns off the burner and sighs.
“We’ll figure it all out. And as much as we like you and James as a pair, this also isn’t tied to your relationship.” Draco looks from Matthew to James and back to Matthew again. “We don’t see it happening, but if you were to split up, our support of you continues. Your value isn’t tied to you as James’ boyfriend. It’s tied to you as a person.”
“I didn’t,” Harry confirms. “Ask me again?”
“We certainly will,” Draco assures her before saying goodbye and stepping into the fireplace.
Just as Harry reaches for the doorknob to the storage room, he’s yanked back by his shirt and wrapped in strong arms. He wriggles and struggles half-heartedly to try and escape, laughing so hard he’s nearly crying. He feels Draco’s chest shaking as his laugh rolls through the room.
“That would be fine.”
“That’s it! Take a breath. Breathe, just for a moment.”
Harry shifts his position and keeps an eye on Draco’s face as he licks a long stripe up the underside of Draco’s cock. Draco hisses and moans, hips lifting slightly, and Harry uses one hand to gently hold Draco’s hips down. It’s been awhile since he’s had a cock in his mouth. Draco is long and thick and he doesn’t want to gag.
Harry reaches and the Mediwizards guide his hands beneath tiny arms and he pushes his son into the world, lifting him to his chest. There are no words for the relief that pulsates through his body. The pain rushes away and there is nothing in the world but him and Draco and their son.
He shoves away from the window and returns to the counter, glad that he spent the first two days without the kids deep cleaning the house. He even wrote Hermione to ask if he could borrow her copy of
“Fuck,” is Draco’s only reply
“For Regulus,” Draco confirms. “For our son.”
Harry’s eyes spill over and he falls to his knees in front of Draco, kissing him soundly. Draco returns the kiss enthusiastically, and Harry can’t believe he gets to kiss this man for the rest of his life. When he can’t breathe from the combination of crying and kissing, he buries his face in Draco’s neck, wrapping his arms tightly around him.
“Even if you bottom?” James darts an embarrassed look at Harry.
The planned dinner has been abandoned in favour of takeaway from their favourite Chinese restaurant, and the six of them are stretched out in the living room in front of the telly, finally eating a late dinner. The kids are all absorbing and processing the news at different rates, but Harry and Draco have been diligent in encouraging them to ask questions and take their own time to think things over. Albus, at least, finally seems convinced that Harry is not actively dying.
“Draco, do you take Harry to be your lawfully wedded husband wherever life may take you?”
“What time do we have to take the kids?”
“This all sucks,” Lily declares.
Harry feels his body heat and he stays silent.
Draco meets his eyes in the mirror and Harry moans at that look alone. The blond holds eye contact as he slowly pulls his cock nearly out of Harry’s body. He sets a slow, deep rhythm, never breaking their gaze.
“Good morning, love.”
“I did.” Draco wraps an arm around Harry’s waist and leads him to the rail as the Eye continues its upward journey. Harry snuggles in as Draco begins pointing out familiar places as they ascend.
Draco quirks an eyebrow and cocks his head to the side. “How did you not know? I’m not at all closeted. It’s…common knowledge, I think.”
A chorus of “I love you, too”s meet his ears as another contraction rips through his body. He moans and rocks against Draco and the instant it subsides, they Portkey away.
“That makes two of us.” Harry can’t help but laugh.
Hermione sighs. “Just say it, Harry. We’ll figure it out from there.” She smiles softly. “And honestly, you
Harry pads after Draco into the bedroom. He smiles softly when he sees a bag from the first Indian place they went to together.
“Yes. The womb builds a temporary connection to the rectum and then birth is much like it would be with a witch.” James sounds like he’s quoting directly from the book and Harry finds it terrifying reminiscent of Hermione.
“Mmm, no. I want to watch.”
“I’m still trying to decide exactly what I want to do, but I know I want to work with LGBTQIA+ kids.” James’ voice holds a lot of conviction and Harry is pleased that his son seems to be developing some focus in his goals at sixteen. He certainly wasn’t able to do that. “I want to be a counsellor or provide some kind of centre for them to be around other kids like them and get support — or even a place to live if they have parents like Matthew’s.”
Matthew nods and tugs on James’ hand, indicating that he’d like his boyfriend to come with him. They slowly climb the stairs, and Harry turns to look at his fiancé.
“Are you going to die?”
They fall into step together, Harry smiling when their hands brush together. He desperately wants to reach out and take Draco’s hand; to feel those pale slender fingers laced with his. He doesn’t, of course, because he’s still not quite sure what all of this is. But he sure wants to.
“He squeezed my hand!”
“Two! One!”
“I love you. I’m happy with you. We have a great relationship and a fabulous sex life and we’re making plans for a life together.” Harry screws his eyes shut and tries to reign in his frustration. “I hate that we’ve had to keep our relationship a secret this long, and I hate that we have to worry about ramifications from the press and the public instead of just enjoying being happy together. I hate that being with me is going to subject you to Merlin knows what kind of bullshit.”
Harry scoots off the bed and retrieves the shoebox-sized wooden box from his wardrobe. In it are the toys and condoms James has requested. He sets the box on the dresser so Draco can add the potions before poking his head into the hallway and calling for James.
Harry chuckles and shakes his head.
! At my pants!” Draco is struggling to maintain any kind of serious expression, his face contorting into various mixes of bemused, aghast, angry, and laughing. He finally cracks and snorts — SNORTS! — and sags against Harry, laughing hysterically.
Laughing, Harry shakes his head. He finds Draco’s fits of jealousy over Claire rather endearing. Claire wouldn’t be his type even if he wasn’t involved with Draco. “Even if she does, we just won’t confirm or deny. We only have to make it six weeks, and they’re already used to seeing us together. For all we know, they already assume we’re together.”
“Yes. The baby appears to be just fine.” Harry hears Draco release the same sigh of relief that he does. “You, on the other hand…Your partner tells me your nausea has been quite severe.”
pregnant.” Draco sighs, clearly growing weary of repeating this. “Choose a looser fitting jumper and it will hide it long enough to tell the kids. Then it’s not a worry for the rest of the weekend. There are some in the bottom of my wardrobe if you need one.”
“What?” Harry asks, feeling like he should be defensive but with no idea why. They step into the elevator and Draco leans past Harry to press the button for the ground floor. Harry resists the urge to close his eyes as he inhales the delicious scent that is Draco.
Harry scrutinises Healer Powell’s face. When he had been an Auror, he always insisted on discharge. He hates being monitored and poked and prodded. But now he has a baby to worry about.
Harry nods. “Let’s have you out of Hogwarts and with a serious partner first, yeah?”
“No.” Matthew has to pause talking to get his sobs under control. “They told me I need to get out.”
“I want to prevent someone from going through what we had to experience. It’s going to be a long development process, but it will be worth it in the end.”
Hermione smiles more easily, and Harry is silently thankful for Draco’s intuition and thoughtfulness.
“Even them. I think they’ll be very supportive if you do tell them. But you can choose if and when you want to let them know.”
He squeezes her in return. “I
“That’s probably for the best. It might also help Al. He’s not going to be content until he sees you, especially since you’ve been in the hospital.”
Draco gently shifts Harry until he has a hand on either hip, smiling as he holds Harry’s gaze. “I said I’d like to kiss you. May I?”
Harry smirks and laves over Draco’s entrance again, swirling his tongue around it before beginning to lick in a slow, repeated rhythm.
“When I can. The nausea makes it challenging.”
Harry chuckles. “Yeah, that’d probably be best. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.”
Silently, Harry summons the chair to come up behind him and he sinks down. Draco shudders as Harry’s cleaning charm passes through him and his hands snake under Draco’s thighs, around his hips, to each grip one cheek of that delectable arse.
“You sit and give directions. I’ll do the work.”
“We are not naming our son Fleamont!” Draco interjects.
“We certainly can. But you’ve got two more years before that’s a reality,” Harry reminds them.
“Harry?” Draco softly interrupts Harry’s thoughts.
He hasn’t needed to navigate even a potentially romantic situation in well over a decade. He still doesn’t know how Draco feels about any of this. Hell, he doesn’t even know for sure how he feels about this himself.
Harry’s breath catches, and the eyes he managed to keep dry earlier are suddenly wet.
“That’s in your stars, isn’t it?” Harry shifts the book so the page with Draco is between them.
A hand lays on his abdomen.
“About that…” Draco pauses. “I never really intended on that staying quiet.”
“It’s perfect, Harry. Put it on for me?”
“Provided you don’t object, I’ll write her back and tell her, politely, to fuck off.” Draco pauses thoughtfully. “I’ll also tell her about Regulus if you’re not opposed.”
“I did. We ended up sitting in a Muggle coffee shop for hours, just talking.” Harry smiles at the memory. “It turns out Albus has been really worried about me being home by myself and had been upset in front of Scorpius. Scorpius had asked Draco to check on me.”
“I did.” Regulus rewards Draco’s rubbing with another kick. “He really is wound up in there tonight, isn’t he?”
After several minutes of pondering and discussion, Draco seems to have made up his mind. Harry pulls his mobile out of his pocket. “Let me just text Hermione and make sure this brand isn’t overly complicated to ward. She says some are easier than others.” Harry looks to his phone as he quickly sends Hermione a text. “She’ll probably respond in a minute or two.”
“I suppose I can see that,” Draco says before laughing softly. “Has this conversation done to you what it’s done to me? Thinking about doing all those things to you?”
“About what, exactly?”
“Ok, you three!” Harry turns back to the younger children. “We’ve got a Portkey home because I can’t Side-Along anyone this far along. We’ll activate it as soon as James comes back.”
“James is all patched up. Evil bird is gone. That animal will never change. He’s going on thirty and still horrible.”
“What?! No, Al, I am
“The kids will know we’re having sex, Draco.”
“All done.” Healer Carr straightens and covers Harry’s hips as he lowers his leg. Draco’s distraction had the desired effect and he hasn’t been focused on the invasive fingers, but on the love of his life and their son. “I think we can go four weeks, this time. I know you had a rough start of it with your pregnancy, but everything looks outstanding. You can always Floo if you have concerns.”
“Of course.”
“I shall keep that in mind. So far, they’ve just been a nuisance at the gates.”
, until he gasps for breath. “That was excellent. He’s moving down. A few more pushes, and his head will be out.”
“Thank you, James. You look quite dashing.”
“Likewise, Headmistress.” Harry grins at her before turning to the kids. “Everyone okay?” Four heads nod in reply.
Draco’s face falls just a bit and Harry immediately regrets asking. “I wasn’t welcome. I haven’t tried in years, since before Scorpius was born, but when I did, it turned out most people aren’t keen on sharing a pitch with a Malfoy, and they’re not afraid to make sure I know they don’t want me there.” Draco lifts his left arm, wrist up, and sighs. “I might not carry the same mark as my father, but I do still carry his last name. It’s better now than it used to be, but I’ve not tried going to the pitch again, not since that first time.”
Draco shakes his head. “No, we laid down for our nap right after Healer Carr left. We’ll write them tonight before we go to bed.”
“I’ll see if they’ll let me brew at home while you’re pregnant. I can ward a lab in the cellar or in one of the guest rooms. Then I’ll only have to go in for meetings.”
Harry closes his eyes and sinks back onto his bed. He’s not nearly as sure that he will be okay as he let Draco think. He knows the problem is fixable, but he also knows it’s experimental. And it’s never been done on a pregnant man.
Harry wants to say.
“Later. Now—
“I… I never had the space or opportunity to truly think about it. My aunt and uncle’s favourite pastime was to remind me how useless I was and how poorly adjusted I’d come out. Then I joined Hogwarts, and I was too busy thwarting a madman who wanted to kill me. My career,” he continues with a sigh, “was the last thing on my mind.”
Okay, okay. Oh, I have a good one!
“I enjoy my… anonymity, as you can very well imagine. I usually wear a glamour when I’m on a job. Having Harry Potter on one’s security team is a double-edged sword.” His rueful smile is perfectly practiced. “I’m… er.
