"You have grown to love him," Emilia pondered, and Harry could only shrug. "He was the closest thing to a father I ever had, protecting me to the best of his abilities, no matter how much he despised me. Snape always treated me like any other student, without any special privileges. He never fawned over me, when I was everybody's darling, but he also never treated me any worse, even when the entire world seemed to turn against me because I said something they did not want to hear. That Tom was back, for example. Professor Snape was… I don't know… dependable. I needed that more than I was aware at the time."
"How dare you contradict me?" the librarian hissed. "I am Christopher Pendragon, guardian of the knowledge and treasures of Merlin's legacy!"
During dinner, Harry avoided talking about his parents' picture, because Severus had yet to confirm that he would feel comfortable having the portrait unfrozen. Since the Potion Master - according to Kreacher - spent a few hours in the salon each day, the raven-haired considered him quite emotionally involved and did not want to push him. As soon as the portrait was integrated into the wards, Severus' grace-period would be over anyway. So, the two young wizards chatted amicably, even including Draco, who seemed relieved to hear about Dolohov's verdict. Afterwards, Neville politely excused himself, following Harry to the salon.
Smiling gratefully, the pure-blood witch took the book and claimed a seat on the sofa, where Rose instantly snuggled into her lap. Victoire nestled into her left side, and Teddy squeezed himself between Lucius and her on the right. After trading a contented smile with her husband, who stretched out his arm over the backrest of the sofa, treading his fingers through her strands, she started to read in a soothing tone, "There were once three brothers, who were travelling along a lonely winding road, at twilight."
He knew. Of course, he knew that she was right. But hell would freeze over, rather than Harry admitting to that. It was none of her business anyway. On his way down the stairs, he tripped over Inari and stumbled down half the steps to the ground floor, worsening his already dire mood even further. "Bloody fox!"
"Likewise," she chuckled, rising from her chair. "Now I will send up your lunch. While you eat, you can decide on what to discuss with Draco when he comes up later."
As the pureblood rose, the young wizard called out, "Emerald, please make me another one of your delicious drinks and prepare one for Lucius as well."
As expected, Harry started a coughing fit when a piece of meat went down the wrong way. Ignoring his opposites obvious discomfort, Draco explained calmly. "To have me research anti-venoms, you need to have a victim. Extract the poison, and I might be able to help."
“And yet, here you are.” Harry smiled. It was not meant as a reprimand. Lucius Malfoy had shown outstanding redeeming qualities. He deserved a second chance. Westron Lostrife, however, had used his Dark Mark as an excuse to torment muggles and muggleborn, even after the war. Only because of the stupid prejudice that blood was in any way significant.
"Potter?" Draco mumbled, still half asleep despite sitting up. "Potter! You need to get away. Run! He'll be back. He'll always come back, stronger and more horrible than before! You won't stand a chance." A sob tore itself free of the man's throat when he chocked, "Dumbledore, Severus, they paid for resisting him with their lives. Dad will be next. You have to get away from us! Save yourself, or he'll kill you!"
"Labor Omnia Vincit," Draco pondered. "Neville surely did his family motto prouder than any of us. 'Hard work conquers all' indeed."
Rising from his armchair, the pureblood shook his head. He turned to look out of the window into the well-lit street. "It does not matter anyway," he admitted quietly after a few minutes. "It is not as if the Malfoy name has any chance of surviving this. We made a mistake, and our house will fall for it."
Watching the door fall shut, McGonagall smiled to herself, topped off her tea and returned to her grading. If anybody could get Hogwarts to open the sealed chambers, even temporarily, it would be Harry Potter.
So, after barely a knock, Harry burst into the room, shaking their patient awake. For a moment, Snape's hands were clutching his arms, albeit weakly. Yet when the wizard came back to himself, he merely let his arms fall away and turned his head, despite his cheeks being covered by tears. A month ago, the raven-haired would have reached out to brush them away. Now, he did not dare. Harry had thought to have built a relationship with Snape over the past few years. But now, he had to face the fact that he merely had constructed one in his head. He had imagined them to become something akin to friends, well, confidants at least. Yet, in reality, it had merely been him talking to someone unconscious. Someone who had not even heard him. The Potion Master did not know him. Did not like him in the least. Maybe he even hated him. As it had happened so often these last few weeks, Harry shivered, curling into the armchair beside Snape's bed.
Bowing, indicating a kiss, the future Lord Malfoy looked into the sky-blue eyes of his potential spouse and squeezed her fingers gently. "Thank you, Astoria. I do appreciate the offer."
"Sufficiently," Severus replied, closing a hand around his left wrist. "Now leave. I have to finish this potion. I will join you for dinner, so don't even think about skipping the meal."
"Alright," she yawned, curling up in his lap to preserve some warmth. "Thirty minutes, then it's your turn to rest."
Charles burst out at that suggestion, "Are you nuts? The Manchester hosts the library for an entire University. Hundreds of books are checked out every day! We don't have the people for such a wide scale search. Not even if the entire department bands together."
Considering her grumbling stomach, Hermione was quite taken with that idea and was half-way through her plate, before inspecting him properly. Lucius sat straight as a ruler, not leaning against the wall. He was spooning up some bland stew, obviously forcing his hands not to shake. Suddenly losing all appetite, she wanted to know, "What did they do?"
Allowing himself a glimpse into Severus' bedroom, Harry felt the anxiety he had carried all day fall from his shoulders. His former potions professor slept deeply and restfully. The difference between the wizard resting now, compared to two days ago, where the somewhat irregular breaths, intercepted by a subtle twitch of his muscles. Harry wondered if he had a nightmare again, but decided that it could not be helped, even if that was the case. Some things just needed time and the mind always healed at its own pace.
With a small smile, the horse-man leaned against the boulder Harry had chosen as a perch. "That is not how it works, as you are well aware of, Mr Potter."
Only Astoria curling into herself, obviously ashamed made Draco hold on to his composure. He had been raised to become the Lord of one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. He would not let his emotions get the better of him. "Of course," he confirmed, holding out a small pot.
Harry shot another glance at Draco, who nodded. "Take the kit, I'll instruct you." He stayed where he was.
"No," the raven-haired admitted, "I am not entirely sure, so we still should get Ruby to talk. But if not, … I don't have a good feeling to put all of our eggs in one basket … you know … but …"
Sighing, Severus put his chin on her head. "He will certainly do everything in his power but putting the responsibility of three … four lives on him … that part of his life should be over. He's just a boy, Narcissa. It's wrong for people to constantly look to him to solve their problems."
Draco paled when he saw who was waiting at the bottom of the stairs. He was more than surprised when Professor McGonagall offered a small smile and stated, "Of course it had to be you, Mr Malfoy."
Gratefully, the young Auror smiled at his friend. Neville always knew the direction of Harry’s thoughts, and no matter how risky his decisions, he supported him nine times out of ten. The tenth time, he usually went through the roof, because his partner had, done something incredibly reckless and stupid.
Turning away from the window, folding his slim arms before his chest, Severus Snape shot a glare at his nurse that would have had seventh years ducking for cover. Regrettably, Emilia Nightingale was not easily intimidated … or at all, as he had learned these past few months. Hence, he made an effort to repeat as composed as possible, though her persistent denial was driving him up the wall. "I am a
Snape as ready to snap, to defend himself, though they both knew that there was nothing he could say, since the boy … young man was right. The young wizard, however, brushed over the moment, as if it was entirely unimportant. "They
Admiring the black beauty, Narcissa admitted, "She allowed me to care for her, but has not approached me since."
Looking at the centaur, the young wizard inquired, "Why did you come? You did not join the celebrations, only talked to me. Why are you here, if you don't mind me asking."
Rubbing his temples, Harry sighed. "And how do you know about Draco's research? Did he talk to you about it?"
Tilting his head once more in gratitude, Lucius stepped back from Arthur before joining his liege. He managed to catch his son's confused question. "How should we hunt? The Weasleys don't have horses."
"You might be too, one day," Hermione replied. Fortunately, she was spared to explain herself, when Molly called for help to tame her over-excited daughter, who seemed determined to mash potatoes that had not even been cooked.
"When is it ever not?" The blond grumbled. "But fine. Since Uncle Sev is out for the count, come on up. I want to show you how far I have come with the wolfsbane potion."
When would the boy allow his life to begin, outside of fighting? When he was thirty, forty, one-hundred? Or would he simply die in the line of duty, as so many Aurors had before him? Lily's son had done his very best to give him, Severus Snape, former spy, former Death Eater, former hated professor, a chance to choose a future that could make him happy. So, did he not owe it to the boy to do the same? Studying the faces of his former students, who looked so grown up, and yet hopeful that he would succeed in a task they were simply not cut out for, he gave them a solemn nod and promised. "I will do my best."
"Yes. After! Remus was always exceptionally fond of chocolate, so we experimented with a few recipes for hot chocolate. Basically, it is whole milk cooked with dark chocolate, cinnamon, honey and a dash of cayenne pepper. The grown-up version contains a shot of fire-whiskey. But since Emilia would most likely string me up if I got you drunk, we are substituting with muggle whiskey … or rum … I'm not entirely clear on the details when Kreacher makes it. Also, we need to tone it down a little so you won't get sick after surviving on blunt food and nutritious potions for so long."
Taken aback, Snape could only stare at his former pupil. Was he really that obvious? He had to force himself to return his attention to the red-head, as he continued his explanation in a somewhat defeated tone. "But the truth is: you can't. Nobody can, because all Harry has heard since he has become a part of our world was that he was the 'boy who lived', the 'chosen one', the 'saviour'," he spat out with uncommon resentment. "People have weighted him down with these incredible, overwhelming expectations. Paired with the fact that all he had heard for the first ten years of his life was that he was a freak and useless, a burden and that no one cared for him … well, when he sees a problem now, he is convinced that
Sensing that this was no topic to pry, Lucius changed the subject, gesturing towards his notes. "These two piles contain all the research I have conducted and the transcripts of all conversations I have had with my client."
"Stop it!" Harry ordered forcefully. "Stop it, Ron! Nothing is going to happen. We won't let it! Just think about it. Lucius was abducted in the morning, Hermione, in the afternoon. Neither of us even knew that Lucius was gone until she mentioned it. I told her that he had to help Narcissa, but …"
"Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea how much destruction one of your enemies could cause with the knowledge in these volumes?" Pacing the length of the shelves, Draco pointed at tomes randomly. "Potions for mind magic, Rituals that use blood magic and oh, look here, a detailed analogy of curses members of the Black family have performed through the ages. Not a retelling of the circumstances but the actual, bloody curses! I am of Black blood, Potter. Do you have even the slightest clue of how much damage I could do with this? Even without a wand."
Despite how beside himself he was, Harry could still see a revelation lighting up Draco's features. "That's it," the blond mumbled, all anger draining out of him. "That's it!" He repeated excitedly, holding out his hand impatiently, "Help me up, you big oaf!"
Studying his companion for a few moments, the raven-haired finished his tea before holding out his hand. "Come on, let's get some sleep. You can't make any decisions if you are running on fumes and I am dead tired."
Angrily, the woman pointed at the carpet. "That! That's wrong! Aunt Walburga cast out her son, just because she did not agree with his choices. Not because he had done something unforgivable like harming a member of the family, but because he’s a Gryffindor! Sirius was loyal, just to the wrong family and his godson suffers for it!"
"Was it … always that way?" Had he even a right to ask? He was Lucius' liege, but some things were maybe a little too personal.
Chuckling, the young witch shook her head. "I wasn't suggesting that; he is just so weird since your accident. I thought maybe you wanted to ask him what is wrong finally and get an actual answer."
Harry traded a worried look with Ron, but before they could reach out to Hermione, Lucius picked up the tale. "The second part is me talking … attempting to talk about the Hecate Case. It has not officially started yet - as you are still investigating the conspirators. However, if anybody got the impression that not everything is done by the book, we could lose the case before it has even begun!"
Harry cautiously approached his trembling vassal who was whispering to himself under his breath. "They'll be back soon. I can't let them take away memories of Draco or Narcissa. They are the only happy ones I have." Then, completely unrelated, "That cursed book! He deserved it being destroyed! Bringing an abomination like that into my home!" Another violent shiver. "Draco … my precious little boy …" Lucius flinched violently when Harry touched his shoulder. He curled tighter into himself, shielding his head.
She had no idea what spell the young man had put on the ring, but the way his shoulders sagged at that affirmation, she felt a little more self-assured.
Instantly the wizard in question shot to his feet, his cheeks burning while he stuttered, "Lady Malfoy, … I mean, Narcissa, … I, … ahm … would you like some tea?"
Nodding slowly, Harry confirmed quietly, "Yes, and we might need a miracle for him to pull through. Or the best potion master of the century to brew the antidote to Nagini's poison. He was the best. He might be our … his, only hope."
Nobody noticed the black-haired witch who had been following them ever since Teddy had shared his story.
"Sally?" At the young Lady's call, a young house-elf popped up. Contrary to the one who had invited them in, this one was wearing a neatly pressed beige pillowcase with a rose drawstring as a belt.
Remembering Stonehenge and how it had felt to travel along the ley-lines, their raven-haired friend snickered, "You have no idea."
Of course, it was all about appearances. Still, Walburga had asked, so Harry hesitated at the door, forcing himself to face the question he had avoided for quite some time now. Returning Draco's wand had been vital, but they both risked a lot with it. The blond was under house arrest still, and if one of Harry's less favourable colleagues got a clue, it would cause problems. Huge, 'losing your job for real'-level problems! On the other hand, Robarts was aware, so Harry might face less of a backlash. Best to remain cautious. Still, in the end, it had not been a decision at all; not for him, Auror or not, because, "It was the right thing to do."
Whispering behind fans and gloved fingers, the gathering turned and watched the Saviour of the Wizarding World descend into the room.
Nodding reluctantly, because no matter how little Harry liked it, he thought Draco to be right, he assured the blond. "He won't get the chance. You know that Draco, don't you? You're mine, and I protect those under my care."
Sighing, James shrugged, "Because I am a painting, Harry. Peter is one of my best friends. I can't feel that betrayal that hurts you so much, because for me it hasn't happened. I am sorry, son."
"Now listen, Leewood," Harry growled, "I sat on all N.E.W.T.s required for being an Auror. I'm as qualified as any other Auror!"
When the commotion at their backs started, Spinnet pulled out his wand. His proud look was replaced by an impassive mask. "It's beginning. Don't worry, Potter. Do your thing. I'll have your back."
With a grin, Ron pointed at the little triangle above the picture of the Goton and then at the note a young Severus Snape had scribbled into the margins of the page.
Closing his eyes, because nobody could help him, the young muggle-raised inquired after a few minutes. "Is it true that almost all pureblood marriages are arranged?"
"Narcissa, please," she interrupted him quietly, her voice thick with tears. "I think the saviour of my family has the right to call me by my name."
"In that case, Mrs Granger, you are free to go. You will receive my report - including the estimated date when you get it back - by Monday morning the latest."
The relief was palpable in the dragon-tamer's eyes. "Great! Don't worry, I'll bring him to Ron and Hermione's in the evening. Come on through, Draco."
Instantly, the young wizard removed the wards that protected his access to the floo. "Sure, Neville, come through." When he noticed the stacks of files his partner carried, he gestured towards the door. "Let's talk in the office." With an apologetic nod, he left the room and after a respectful, "Lady Malfoy, Mister Malfoy, Draco," Neville followed.
“The index works for him, Harry, as well as for me and he didn’t mention once that the fire in the room died on its own. But no, I doubt that he presumes you being so mean-spirited. He was just wondering because he couldn’t relate to the problems you have described.”
Rubbing her little fingers, she had whispered, "Emerald is not being allowed to touch the wizard's whiskey. So Emerald is filling up the glass. Is that good?"
“That’s Ariadne,” Ron mumbled around his food. “She comes in every fortnight. Her mum died during an attack six months ago, leaving her and her baby-brother to their dad’s care. We think she buys the Goo for the baby when he can’t sleep for a few nights in a row. She told me once that her dad can sleep through her brother’s giggling but gets really sad when Theseus cries. George decided that we offer her a fifty percent discount. She pays for one ounce but receives two.”
Trading a glance with his wife, the two pure-bloods sighed a little. However, Narcissa chose to answer. "Had he been bolder and more outgoing, he might have had a chance. His genius with potions would have given him something to utilise. Slytherins respect talent and cunning. But if you don't display enough confidence in your abilities, nobody will look at you twice."
"I can assure you, Harry," Severus stated calmly. "Had you had any intentions of pursuing a relationship with Miss Weasley, you would have most definitely have needed one!"
"It's quite alright, Harry," the young witch interrupted with a kind smile. "I appreciate the offer, but I can assure you that it is not necessary."
Shaking his head, Lucius tried to rise again, but a sharp look from his wife kept him in his seat. "If that is true, why is Potter so intent on advocating his claim at every turn?"
Turning around, he wished for a comment, the barest acknowledgement, but of course, the patient lay unmoving, unresponsive, serenely silent for the last five years. Dejected, Harry made his way over, straightened the covers and gently brushed a strand of hair aside before leaving. "Good night, Sir."
"Narcissa," the raven-haired wizard interrupted gently. "Don't you think I know how many hours you have put into this? Don't you think that I am aware of the amount of needlework and blood you have given? I have been out of ideas of how to make this happen since before you came and now you have reached the same point. You need all the power you can get for this to work. This wand battled the Dark Lord the day of his resurrection and rose to the challenge. I even managed to repair it with the Elder Wand after it was broken. It's the best shot we've got and you know it!"
Grimacing, Harry defended his knowledge. "I did have to get my potion N.E.W.T. before they made me an Auror!"
Frowning, Draco raised his head, scrutinising the little creature. At first glance, she looked perfectly fine, like any other house-elf. But there was something distinctively wrong with her. He just could not lay his finger on it. Then it hit him. Instead of an iris, the elf's eyes seemed set with rubies, not even pupils were visible.
A while later, they were pulled out of a light doze when a twelve-night cake and a few mince pies - leftovers from the feast - as well as a pot of freshly brewed English Breakfast Tea, appeared on the table. Trading a smile, both young wizards called out in one voice, "Thank you, Kreacher." Despite the house-elf remaining stubbornly out of sight.
With shining eyes, Draco reached out and caressed Harry's forehead, before cupping his cheek. "I really do."
Ron Weasley's warm voice interrupted Severus' thoughts and he was more than surprised when the red-head requested evenly, "Hermione, Draco, do you think you could whip up some tea and maybe a sandwich? I'm starved."
"Big time!" Neville beamed. "And you will pay your debts in full, my friend. Mostly in hot, caffeinated drinks but partially in baked goods. Luna requested a batch of your carrot−cream−cheese−muffins, and what the Lady of my heart wants, she will get."
"'Bout an hour ago," Draco revealed. "Ginny went shopping and decided to cook dinner. My mother and I offered to help, and while her support was appreciated, I was kicked out and sent here. I thought you might needed help." The blond gestured towards the armchair Narcissa had occupied before. He had pulled it closer to the fire, and a book on potions lay on the floor beside it.
"Headmistress?" Harry had needed some time to find his elusive teacher. Though, not so elusive in fact, since he had caught up with her in the transfiguration classroom.
“Harry,” trying to break the tension, Narcissa requested, “Could you give me your sewing kit before you leave, please?”
The moment he turned fully towards the former Death Eater, a wand sprang into the blue-eyed wizard's hand. Shaking his head in mock sadness, Harry made a brief gesture and berated. "A convict attending a Ministry function, I could have overlooked. Him being obviously badly kept … well … that I could consider a problem for his actual keeper. A wand when attending a ball … that's just bad form, but …"
"Luna arrived ten minutes ago. She's in the garden, talking to her fairy friends." The raven-haired gestured towards the back-door.
"I … yes … No!" The blond babbled when the young Auror growled at the initial confirmation. "He just grabbed my chin. It was … nothing …" The former Death Eater had not harmed him physically. He had terrified Draco with his insinuations and blank innuendos, but in the end, nothing had happened. Potter had come and saved him, like many times before. The blond wondered if there would come a time, at one point in the future, when his former rival would tire of that.
Narcissa added, "While Lucius is in a distressing condition, Mrs Granger Weasley is quite well. She is a very strong woman. While the abduction put a strain on her mind, her body has been taken care off quite well. All her nutritional needs were met sufficiently."
"You think your ego won't survive knowing yourself under my care. And yes, I could march into the Ministry, and have them update your file. Remove the death certificate and so on. But ask yourself: Is that really what you want?"
"And so Death took the second brother for his own," the redhead finished for him. "You know the entire tale by heart, don't you?"
Gracefully choosing the place opposite her, Draco pondered his answer. He knew why he had done it, but now, seeing his mother so agitated, he was not sure if she was ready for the truth. However, not in the habit of lying to her, he revealed quietly after a few moments, "Because it's what I would have deserved."
Looking at the man who had not moved in nearly half a decade, Harry tousled his hair agitated and whispered, "There has to be a way because we can't go on like we are. That's simply not acceptable." He was talking about more than the state of Wizarding Britain, but his patient was not able to offer any reply, another situation the young man found unacceptable, but had no idea how to change.
Closing his eyes, shaking his head, Lucius revealed, "Narcissa lost two babies before she was able to carry Draco to term. After him, we tried three more times but … after the last miscarriage Narcissa got depressed, and while it was a case of post-partum depression, we decided not to try again. We had a professional healer curse me, and there was the end of that."
It had to be, because what could he say to justify what he felt? When had that even happened? When had duty become sympathy or even love? Severus had never thought himself cut out to be a parent. Of course, he had cared about his little snakes, but he had been their head of house, not their father.
"But how …" After all this time, seeing something so sensitive untouched by everything that had happened, took Harry's breath away. "This is the same one you brought to Hogwarts in your fifth year?" He had to make sure.
Twisting from side to side, Harry asked tense, "Excuse me?" He might be an Auror, but him hearing voices never boded well.
This too was a useless ritual he entertained ever since returning from his journey: he tried to spell his godfather’s name back into the family tree. Sirius had died a hero, fighting Voldemort to the best of his abilities. He should not have been killed that night, at the hands of an insane Death Eater. No matter how many they captured, there were forever more. Most days, Harry felt like he and Neville were fighting cockroaches, no matter how many they eradicated, the next nest was just around the corner. It was so hopeless as if they were never making any real progress. Hopeless, like his latest spell, the carpet refused to yield to. Sirius name still glaring through its absence. Drowning half of his drink in one go, Harry let his head fall back against the armchair, closing his eyes. Tomorrow they would have to follow another lead, find more of the bad guys, make their world a little safer one raid at a time. Maybe one day, they would succeed, and Neville would be able to return to his greenhouses and his flowers. To him, it would be worth it. Draining the last of his drink, Harry set it aside and, after a little detour into the second bedroom on the third floor, went to bed.
"The young Master Malfoy has tried to sort through the library but fell asleep an hour into the task. Do you want him awake and put to work again?" The elf's dismissive tone made clear how little he thought of that idea, despite offering it.
Harry returned more than an hour later, shamefaced and slightly hoarse. Teddy was sitting on the floor of his office, polishing all the pendants he had ever gifted to his godfather, while Draco was content reading a book in front of the fireplace. The desk was undisturbed.
Confused the curse-breaker gestured around. "Because there is a heavy-duty monitoring charm woven into your wards."
For a few moments, nobody said a word. Only Teddy's tense breaths could be heard, while the older wizards sorted through the given information. Draco could see Harry becoming enraged, barely holding on to his composure. As to not frighten the boy, he pulled Teddy into his arms and ordered, "Go. We will see you back at home."
Studying the scroll, Harry went to his office and added a few more blank sheets to the wrap. He did not want the magic to revert to the Ministry, because it ran out of space. Then he looked around. This was supposed to be a safe place, but Lucius had proven that not even confidential documents were as protected here as Harry had assumed. While that might be a problem with his case-files, it might be disastrous with this. So, the young Auror conjured a box and sealed the scrolls in it as he climbed the stairs to the third floor. His bedroom was only ever entered by people he trusted implicitly. Draco's lab was still under Fidelius. However, neither of the two options felt just right. Therefore, at the end of the corridor, Harry turned towards the last door there. Carefully knocking, before entering, he requested, "Sir, I have a favour to ask."
The elf wailed and not because Harry’s grip had to be painful. “Kreacher didn’t enter the salon. Kreacher promised! Kreacher would never break his word. Would never be so disrespectful!”
"Really?" The former Divination teacher inquired. "Thinking back on a life as full of trials and tribulations as yours, would you really have considered it a blessing to know of the upcoming dangers up front?"
A few moments later, the door to the living-room creaked open, and Kreacher shuffled through, a bundle of rags cradled to his chest. Oh, so slowly, he approached his Master and lowered his arms, revealing a curious face with huge, green eyes.
Losing the last of his barely hung on to composure, because Lucius' accusations hit a little too close to home, Severus thundered, "Don't talk like that about
"Kreacher!" Pulling the elf behind himself, Harry let his concentration weaver ever so slightly, but that was enough. The cultist noticed thee weakening parsel-shield and cast at their intended sacrifice, "Avada Kedavra!"
‘Me too,’ Harry thought when he flooed to the Ministry and raced down to the Department of Magical Law, hoping to catch Hermione after her first cup of tea. Unfortunately, his brash entrance made her spill her last sip, busy moping it up with a napkin she glared at him. “Heavens, Harry, give a girl a little warning. It’s not even half past seven and you …”
"Promise me, young Lord," the witch demanded. "Promise that you will return my portrait to this wall, as soon as your friend is finished."
"Their job," McGonagall informed them. "And since Severus seems to be in the best hands imaginable, I will take my leave. Supper is in half an hour, and I fear for my castle if I am not there to supervise since both Filius and Septima took the weekend off."
Echoed screams shocked all of them out of their slumber. Ron and Harry were trading wide, fearful glances, before sagging back into their own bedding, apparently trying to calm their racing hearts. Once the raven-haired's breath had evened out, Draco rose for the tiny kitchen. He was not surprised to find herbal tea in the only cupboard, this was a Weasley tent after all, so he set out to cook some tea, while the three Gryffindors shuffled into the 'living-room' of the tent. Bleary-eyed, the quartet sat around the table, with Draco spooning a dash of sugar into his cup, while Harry served the others from the steaming pot. Nobody said a word, but the blond noticed, that the raven-haired was continually rubbing his neck and that Ron seemed obsessed with touching his friend as if to make sure that he was alive and well. When the trio sagged slowly, Draco hesitantly reached out for Weasley's wand, "May I?"
When the two Slytherins returned to their sandwiches, Harry reached out under the table and squeezed Draco's knee. As the blond looked up, he merely offered a grateful smile.
"I would!" the young man confirmed immediately, beaming when Severus took the cuff links and replaced the titanium ones Harry had bought him on a whim when he had found the hole-in-the-wall jeweller in America. The Potion Master had even been in a coma by the time, still, it had felt right to acquire aquire one pair for every male Weasley and another for the then-unconscious Potion Master.
"Where have you been?" A thunderous voice greeted Harry as he stepped out of the floo at Grimmauld Place.
Looking at the young Auror, as if he was particularly dim-witted, the older wizard merely offered three words, "The Daily Prophet!"
Aware of the initial instruction to stay close to his liege, but not willing to abandon the last of his pride, Lucius folded his arms before his chest. "If you think that I will share a broom like a child, think again!"
Neville looked at his colleague, then at Harry, who let his wand fall into his hand, hissing a spell under his breath, then back at the Unspeakable. "No, I mean: how did you know that Severus Snape was alive?"
With an unreadable look, Lucius tilted his head. "Our children do have the tendency to make us want to be better for them. To live up to the image they have of us."
Straitening, Neville confirmed, "We pinpointed the location of Mr Malfoy's artefact in Westwood Gardens, Head Auror. So, we very much would like to conduct a search there."
He considered the irony of the situation: now when he would be willing to help Harry, not only because of him being Lily's child but because of himself, he was no longer a schoolboy he had to protect. These days, Harry Potter was an Auror who could take care of himself. At least most of the time. There was not much left the Potion Master could do for young Potter … however, it seemed that listening was sometimes enough. Narcissa and Draco, on the other hand, needed his counsel for the squib project and he had to admit that he rather enjoyed the challenges of developing new potions without having to interrupt himself to teach dunderheads how to not blow up cauldrons. Also, this project was important for their people. So, if … when he came back, it would certainly work to his advantage if his name was associated with such an altruistic purpose.
Neville had a hard time to suppress the horror that crept into his voice as he replied. "Because that is not something we do. It would shame not only the couple but their families as well. And who would ever associate with a divorcee?"
Shuddering, Kreacher pulled his ears. "No, No, No, No, No! Kreacher is a good elf. Won't say a word. No, he won't."
"By 'family portrait', you mean a painting of your parents. And by 'a house's wards' you are thinking about Grimmauld Place?"
"Harry!" Neville called over the babbling. "Send Kreacher home. He's of no use to us at the moment."
"It shows in the family tree," Harry had sipped the butterbeer he had had brought with him. "There are little snake-symbols beside a few of the names. Narcissa taught me the meaning of these markings."
trust by casting a spell on my wand. Who knows what could have happened? He swore to uphold the law. To never let his personal feelings to get in the way of what is right! The fact that he blatantly ignored that vow just to get back at a former Death Eater … that's bad, Harry. Who knows what else he was willing to do during his employment?"
Barely able to suppress the tremors that wracked his body, at the mere idea of finally doing right by Sirius, Harry whispered hoarsely, “You would do that for him?”
Grinning, the young parsel-mage pulled out his wand and hissed at the door, tapping it in five places. Then he pulled it open and disappeared into the darkness. After a second, he challenged in a muffled voice, "Are you coming?"
Once they were more or less finished, the witch wanted to know, "By the way, will Lucius be back at the office tomorrow? I missed him today."
Studying the plant, Harry admitted, "I did not do it alone, you know? Everyone out there and even at the Ministry, they look at me like I am some kind of all-powerful wizard. But without Hermione, I would not have lasted a day. And Ron saved us more times than I can count with his practical mind and in-depth knowledge of the wizarding world. I am nothing special, Neville. I'm just me … just Harry."
Chuckling, Pince reminded her, "One bed in an isolated dungeon cell is on fire. And it's more smouldering than burning. It seems that Mrs Granger-Weasley chose to set an already damp mattress on fire. Chances of the house going up in flames are actually slim to none. So, I wouldn't worry."
Docile, the blond did as told and tilted up his face. Harry had never done this before, had only ever watched Ginny, so he was not sure how much pressure to apply. Gently, too gently at first, he wiped over Draco's eye. He needed three tries to get it right when finally, the black liner started to come off. "Am I hurting you?"
Swaying a little, Harry briefly closed his eyes, allowing Narcissa to pull him into a quick hug before she nudged him towards the door. “Now, go to bed. We will talk tomorrow.”
Gently pulling back, the pureblood shook her head. "The wand chooses the wizard, Harry," she reminded him. "It should not come as a surprise that some can defend themselves after their owner is gone."
Draco, who had just fastened his saddle on a beautiful, cream−coloured beast gasped when he watched his mother mounting her mare. Her motion was as elegant as if she had just stepped onto the dancefloor of the Manor. What shocked him, however, was her forgoing a saddle. "Mother!" He exclaimed scandalised. "How can you … you said that a noble should never ride a horse without the proper attire!"
Severus was just about to reply when a small hand forced him to turn, and he received a slap that made his ears ring. Apparently, Narcissa had gotten over her shock. Blazing blue eyes stared into his, as she demanded, "Severus Tobias Snape, you will explain yourself this instant!"
"Until he doesn't take it any longer," the young wizard shrugged. "There are really no repercussions of waning it off. You would only have to be cautious about side effects in combination with other potions. This one, for example," gesturing towards a vial with a milky-white liquid and a white stopper. "It might look like a pain-relief potion, but in combination with the first one, it might burn out the wizard's core. Nasty business," he shook his head. "I would not recommend it. It is all a theoretical concern, of course. Nobody would ever test that. However, one could easily confuse one with the other, so I'm just warning you." Taking out a near-identical milky potion with a light-grey stopper, he put it on the table beside the tall bottle. "This is a normal pain-relief, for when you need it. No negative side-effects with this one. Even if your husband takes it."
"Just because we suspect certain people to be involved, that suspicion doesn't justify storming their homes!" Pince cautioned, very much to Neville and Harry's dismay.
"No, it doesn't," Harry sighed, frustrated because Draco seemed unable to let go of the past. "But all Teddy knows of you is that you are named after stars. That you were nice to him. And that you brewed him a potion. What you have done in the past, is of no importance, only what you do now matters."
Daphne showed the back of her head, where the newest addition to her team, Alexander Fairchild, had let a box of evidence fall, making her bleed like crazy. "It's probably gone in half a year, with the hair growing over it again, but until then, I am milking it for all that it's worth," she grinned maliciously.
Australia was … scary to say the least. How did anybody live in a country where literally everything, from the tiniest spider to the prettiest flower could kill you with its poison? But the people adapted. Harry spent a fortnight with a werewolf clan that lived in the outback, running and hunting on the full moon because there was nothing for hundreds of miles around, except small livestock and veldt. They did not hurt each other or themselves; never lock themselves up. When they wanted to run, be it as a wolf or as wizard they just did, and they had been the most peace-loving people he had met so far. He listened to their stories, wrote everything down and sent it to Hermione once he was back with the civilisation where he could find a post-office.  His best friend still was invested in the whole creatures-right debate, and this would definitely help. And if he sent tiny jumpers with kangaroos and a blanket with koalas, he hadn't mentioned it in the enclosed letter.
how our first conversation of the week should have gone. And why should I care about Dolohov anyway? He's a convicted Death-Eater who messed up his probation."
The raven-haired sank into the chair, facing his companion and nodded gratefully when he was handed a cuppa. "That's camomile."
Used to the boy's bickering, Severus cut in. "Explain what you mean, Harry. What makes you doubt the sincerity of Miss… Mrs Greengrass' offer?"
Smiling, the young wizard felt comforted by the knowledge that he might be a regular part of a family tree, after all. "And what Hallow did Ignotius receive?"
"Turmeric," Harry explained, serving the toast. "This week we seem to go over all the yellow spices. Yesterday it was saffron. We had to pour out the entire pot."
Draco's eyes flew open, taking in the larger-than-life form of Harry Potter, who casually twirled his wand, leisurely reaching out for him. Finally breaking free from the unwanted touch, the blond fled into the raven-haired's arm. He willingly tilted his neck, so Harry could brush his nose over the skin Dolohov had just fingered, before ghosting a kiss over it. A part of the Slytherin pondered over the picture he made; presenting himself all subdued and submissive. But he was too grateful for the protection of Harry's arm around his waist, to even think about offering any kind of token resistance. Once the young wizard had finished his claim, he demanded to know. "Are you alright, pet?"
Deflating, the boy nodded. After a minute, where Draco had started to rub his back soothingly, he started to talk, albeit so quietly, that Harry and Draco had to concentrate on understanding him.
Narcissa had waited for him, anxious to find out what had happened in Potter’s office. But all the Lord had been able to muster was a loving kiss on her forehead, before he had left for the parlour. He had not even gone to find Draco, too worried that he might lose his composure when seeing his son engaged in a menial task, because he had traded his freedom for Lucius’ survival.
In a graceful gesture that made Harry wonder how often she had practiced it in front of a mirror to make it look so flawless, the Lady pointed towards the wall. "Someone put a lot of effort into keeping this operation secret. Therefore, chances are good, that the librarians would, in fact, not enter their libraries in broad daylight, checking out new books at the counter."
Casting an absent-minded identification spell, Neville's mouth twitched, "Yes, Sir," before downing the potion.
"Draco, I am not kicking you out. But it is time you take your life back! You have been with me for six months now and apart from the Yule ball you have been holed up here or at the Manor."
"Of course, I am. Otherwise, …" Draco began, but then interrupted himself. "Oh, … I didn't think of that."
Now, the elder Malfoys sat on freshly polished garden−chairs, as if they did not wear damp and dirty clothes. How they managed to make it look so elegant was beyond Harry. Something was just bred into a person, he pondered. Their son, on the other hand, sat on the lawn beside his friends, looking equally dishevelled but much calmer than in the morning. From all the debris Daphne and George had collected during their wood−cutting, they had made a huge bonfire, and every few minutes, someone levitated more twigs and handful of needles into the fire.
Abhorring the idea to make life any easier on those purebloods, Auror Jenkins regained his composure and snarled. “Absolutely not!”
"'By Merlin' would certainly be more appropriate. What did you think, Potter, that they would not track his wand, no matter how suspiciously absent?"
"For eleven years, nobody cared and at Hogwarts your friends were … fickle at times. I get it. I really do. But, Harry, you have us now and we have your back unconditionally. Of course, I get angry if you keep secrets or lie to me. But that does not mean that I will abandon you when you need me!"
In a seemingly clumsy move, Harry knocked over Draco's glass, when he reached for the carafe of fresh orange juice. Emerald had decided that Severus needed more fruit in his diet, and since the Potion Master barely nibbled on anything she served at the moment, the elven-child had plotted with Emilia Nightingale and now offered different kinds of fruit and vegetable juices with every meal.
Usually, people of their social standing would not even think about helping others clean. Yet since they were dependant on the Auror's goodwill, Lucius and Narcissa traded a glance, before she tilted her head. "We are at your service, Mr Longbottom."
"By Merlin, you can't be serious!" Pince burst out, but was glared into submission, until he and Harry acknowledged in one voice, "Yes, Sir."
Narcissa shook her head at the young Aurors' questions. "My son did not leave the Manor by floo. He was concerned that one of the smaller creatures could 'tag along' so to speak. Instead, he left the house and set out to apparate back to Grimmauld Place, once he was a reasonable distance away."
After pondering that for a while, Ron nudged his friend. "You've become really good at this, you know."
Draco was anxiously pacing his room, as he had for the majority of the day. Being punished with no dinner, he could understand. It had been a lesson. His appearance had not been perfect; his room not clean enough; his clothes probably in disorder. But today had been different. Since Sunday, his Mistress … no, the Lady Blackwood had arrived at eight a.m. sharp. So today, when his grumbling stomach had woken him at dawn, Draco had jumped out of bed and methodically cleaned and straightened every last corner. Stumbling against the door in a moment of carelessness, he had felt the handle burn an imprint into his back. No need to test that part of his luxury cell again.
"Midnight it is then," the witch corrected herself, caressing the girl's head to ease her into sleep. "There were once three brothers, who were travelling along a lonely winding road, at midnight. In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water …"
Thinking about that, Harry nodded. He did trust Draco Malfoy, despite their somewhat turbulent past. Hermione and Ron were … just them, reliable beyond the shadow of a doubt. But Draco, despite the faith Harry placed in him, would not be able to help with this new political agenda since the Saviour of Wizarding Britain had other - equally important - plans for him.
The rain was pouring down in buckets, when there was a heavy knock on the door of number 12 Grimmauld place, on the second of November. Narcissa and Lucius had retreated to the Manor after having celebrated All Hallows Eve with them. It was common amongst the purebloods to take a sabbatical the next day to remember their dead.
"Those of us who have shown promise for the mind arts, and have been trained from a very young age, have no needs for outright attacks. We've learned to slip by unnoticed by all but the strongest Occlumence."
Now it was the young Auror's turn to smile before he tilted his head again and left. After a brief detour to his office at Grimmauld Place, where he found yet another diagnostic parchment in the middle of his desk, he returned to the Ministry.
Nodding embarrassed, Harry brushed over his face. He was an Auror for heaven's sake, he should not be losing his composure that easily. Avoiding her eyes, he mumbled, "I'm sorry." What a brilliant impression. The man who was responsible for her family's well−being bawling his eyes out within an hour of meeting her.
"I offer my support, not my freedom," Astoria replied evenly. "If we want this to work, you have to trust me that I
Gratefully accepting more water from the embarrassed blond, Harry looked around and noticed knitting needles, idling away in a chair, poking at each other. Against the wall stood a small, uncomfortable looking couch, covered with a colourful cushion and a threadbare blanket. "How long …?" He began when the voice of Molly Weasley was heard outside.
At one point in this chapter, Harry is really, really sad. But I can promise you, there is nothing more to it than that.
Draco had been on edge ever since his father had left. His mother had tried to ease his anxiety, but the commotion in the office and Lucius' untimely departure had indicated some kind of conflict between vassal and liege. After dinner had been well on its way, his mother had taken two half-finished portions and had taken her leave as well. Since Ginny Weasley was content to hustle and bustle around the kitchen, Draco had chosen a chair in the office to make himself available for Harry. Maybe Potter would not begrudge his father's mistake if the rest of the family showed themselves suitable subservient.
"It's not okay to use Legilimency on your landlord," Harry mumbled, burrowing deeper into the armchair.
"We brought you to the infirmary and performed the ritual we have already told you about. But somehow, some way, people got the impression that you have died. Especially after we have told them about Nagini's bite. McGonagall helped me to take charge and surprisingly, nobody even bothered to look at your 'corpse'. Even the Order of Merlin was awarded post humus, though I think Kingsley suspected something, since he insisted on giving it to me in your stead."
"Sorry," Harry chuckled sheepishly. "I couldn't resist." Finishing the hissed incantation, he tapped the buckle with his wand once, watching the band snuggle up against the other wizard's skin. "There, all set. Is it comfortable?"
Burrowing into her master's neck, the elven-child whispered grieving, "But Emerald did not help to find Master-Draco-Sir! Emerald must try harder!"
Looking at the other with all the determination he could muster, the patient informed him, "Of course I will drink it. Luna is my friend. If she brings me something, I trust her that it will help!"
Contrite, Harry followed. He needed some time to shrug off his dark thoughts. Lucius had done horrible things, there was no denying that. But he was trying to make amends. That was more than Harry could say about 90% of the Death Eaters still out there. "What should we do now?"
"No, you can't," Harry laughed when he and Neville tumbled out of the floo of No 12 Grimmauld Place three hours later.
"Ingredients for a Sleeping Draught," Hermione pondered. Inwardly Draco started to bristle, ready to defend his decision. He was surprised when the witch merely chuckled. "Smart move. I wish I had thought of that, when Harry lived with us two years ago, because he shattered the bones in his right leg."
"Did she trip you?" Draco chuckled, appearing at the bottom of the landing. "I swear that happens to me at least twice a day. She's constantly underfoot."
"I think so?" the blond replied, confused. But when nothing but a "Good," was added, the young wizard fled the room.
Thinking of his mother and how she would judge everything Harry had done, the young man nodded reluctantly.
With a glance towards the Auror, who had introduced himself as Harley Goldsmith and was now nodding permission, George pulled out his wand. The speculators who hovered at the sides - the Ministry was far too boring these days - took a step back, to give the redhead room to work. Most people here knew him from his shop, and nobody wanted to come between a Weasley and the object of his interest … or they did not want to get caught in the 'analysis', who knew what the co-founder of Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes would find?
The Potion Master shrugged, "I will have to, eventually. Though I find my accommodations more than passable, I cannot impose on Harry forever."
" That's a load of bollocks!" Draco exploded. "You can't throw these journals at me and expect me to acquire any knowledge without telling me what this is all about! If that's how it is going to be, do it yourself!" Pushing back his chair so fast it toppled over, the blond glared down at the raven-haired. He shivered when thunderstorm eyes met stone-cold green. Not even bothering to rise, Harry replied evenly, "Neither do I have the time, nor the nerve to deal with your little tantrum, Malfoy. I'll leave now to get some work done, and when I return, you can tell me if you wish for me to release you from your vow, or if you want to act like the adult you presumably are."
"You were screaming, Harry," She sniffed, before she told him angrily. "It must have been really painful, since I know how high your threshold is. So, don't tell me not to cry! Shut up and let Hermione can take care of you!"
When they all nodded, he lifted the spell, then turned towards the former spy, "Professor Snape, you think we should consider using Draco as bait, because right now, we know more about the plans of this group than ever before?"
When the parchment with the result of his diagnostics was handed over, Draco got very still since the person handing it over was Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister of Magic. In a childish attempt to hide, the delinquent pushed his wand up his sleeve, but of course none of them was under any illusion of the former Auror not having seen him use it.
"God, what I would do for you to be able to advise me right now," the raven-haired groaned, but then chuckled weakly and sank further down. "But that would be the snake biting its own tail. If I had you here to offer advice, I would not need it. On the other hand … maybe you would enjoy a properly equipped lab when you get back on your feet. I hope you'll want to stay until you are better. Is that selfish?" Harry sneered, shaking his head. "Of course, it is." Hesitating, he studied the man before him; hesitantly he admitted, "I think I've gotten so used to having you around, that I am terrified of the idea of you leaving. And that does not even make sense since we hated each other's guts at Hogwarts." With a groan, he rubbed his eyes and pushed himself up. "I've got to go; Morpheus is calling. Big day tomorrow … ahm, today. I should try and get at least a few hours of sleep."
"Okay," Harry looked between the two women, who appeared exhausted but distinctively happier than before. "In that case … good night, I guess. Oh, if you need anything …"
The stern voice of the residing Potion Master made the boy flinch at his lookout. Still, he replied honestly, "Eyedropping."
Magic filled the room. Not much, but enough to be noticeable. Hermione looked at the ceiling, where a tiny coil of smoke was escaping through a crack. "I know you're looking for me, Harry. I just need you to be clever about it."
"Well, he … well … he kind of blames every Death Eater in existence for his wife and children's poor health. And Lucius being marked does not help."
"Well," Hermione, always the sensible one, started to explain when she noticed Molly's unease. "They did have a house topple down on them. Only their good instincts to shield first and think later kept them from being squished."
Snape had decided on a quick trip to the kitchen. He had planned to reward himself with the teal biscuits Emerald had baked that day and then back to bed. The Potion Master rarely allowed himself to indulge his sweet tooth, but he had deemed walking down three flights of stairs sufficient exercise to deserve a treat.
Blushing to his roots, so that it was visible even in the light of the few lanterns that illuminated the patio, the raven-haired immediately stammered through a protest. "Draco … he … I … he and I … we are not … we never have!"
"It didn't matter!" Lucius whispered, lowering his eyes. "As long as Draco and Narcissa were safe, nothing mattered!"
"A little," Neville confirmed, though he was offering a comforting smile at the same time. "However, since we are friends, I don't mind sharing. We've been through worse than different opinions about spirituality. When I was young, I was … heavily encouraged to join my grandmother in her prayers to Esus. He's a triple god with aspects of war, thunder and is also called 'the god of the people'. My father was brought up praying to him. But when I started Hogwarts, when I realised that I would always be so much better at growing things than destroying them, I looked and found a goddess that suited me much better. Praying to her actually gave me comfort instead of merely being 'something to be done'. Since I was eleven, my prayers and sacrifices had gone to Anu, the Earth Goddess of Nature and Agriculture."
Clenching the snitch so hard it was leaving marks on his palm, Harry forced himself to pull back and finish his explanation. "I used the Elder Wand to repair my own; then I destroyed it. I still have the cloak, Death's cloak I guess you can call it and two days ago … two days ago, the stone came back to me. I wanted to throw it away, but then I thought it might have come back to me for a reason."
"You are right that I kissed Draco, and that kisses are important. But for a successful relationship, some things are even more important."
Since Lucius worked at the Department of Magical Law most days, as per Hermione's request, Harry was able to pick both of their brains two days later at lunch. "I mean, apart from their jobs, there is virtually no connection between them." Harry moaned. "They travelled in different circles, entertained different hobbies. Their interests did not overlap even a little. Which is a coincidence, in itself. But it does not help us!"
Had Harry wanted to make sure that Snape would not let go of the Stone involuntarily, he now realised that this was not a concern to be had, since the man clutched his fingers so tightly, his knuckles turned white, as he sobbed, "Lily …"
When the three opponents turned towards him - they seemed to have all but forgotten about their audience - Severus raised his eyebrows. "Are you eating popcorn?"
Finally opening his eyes, Roberts glared at him. “Bullshit! Though you might not have realised the troubles your actions would cause, you still would have seen them through.
"She got over her disappointment," her father shrugged, "when I told her my tiger first came out way past my twenties."
"Bad odds never have deterred me. Otherwise, I would have given up on Harry after that stupid boy ran head-first into the Chamber of Secrets in his second year."
"Lucius, put that down!" Harry ordered forcefully when he recognised the markings on the cup in his vassal's hand. Contrary to the pure−blood, he could identify the drink by the code on the side.
Finishing the styling with a wandless spell he had learned basically in the cradle, Draco had to wait for a moment, until his companion would willingly meet his eyes, only then was he ready to admit, "I did not know how terrified I was of Him returning, until it lessened, after that first night at Grimmauld Place."
With a growl, Harry pointed at Daphne, "Well, that won't work this time, since these two … or two other wizards or witches will show up every time someone casts a spell around here. So, don't try it again."
"Well, she might not be able to share information about Lucius, Hermione and their abductors. But your Malfoy Junior is an entirely different thing."
"Because there is one thing librarians are better at than anybody else: conducting research! But to do so, you need to have the right sources at hand."
They sat in silence for a while, until Harry whispered, looking at the ceiling. "What do you think are Poppy and Emilia doing up there?"
At night he tossed and turned, sometimes so violently that Narcissa had to shake him awake. Not wanting to bother his wife, Lucius never shared his concerns, merely kissed her head, assuring her, that he was fine. But the pictures his mind conjured stayed with him, making him afraid to go back to sleep. Draco was a prominent protagonist; actually, the one featured most often. His son had taken the Dark Mark, not because he had considered it an honour, but to protect him and Narcissa. In his dreams, Lucius was forced to watch his only child walk the path of damnation again and again and again. He was compelled to relive raids he had committed with Severus by his side, now showing Draco in his old friend's place, laughing cruelly at the muggles who whittled at the end of his wand. Witches and wizards he had witnessed being killed screamed out their last breath with his son hovering above them, whispering, "Avada Kedavra," laughing like a maniac. When they returned to the Manor afterwards, Draco's usually soft grey eyes were shining mercurial, much like Bella's and his blond hair stood up on ends, making him appear deranged and dangerous. Lucius woke in cold sweat after such episodes, but those were not even the worst nightmares he suffered.
"They're coming." Luna smiled, sliding down from the roof into Harry's arms. She joined Neville when he came around the corner.
It turned out that Hermione Granger was quite skilled in reading people. Undoubtedly a skill she had learned during their hunt, but nevertheless exceedingly useful at all times. Guiding him towards the atrium after a mere hour, she informed him, "I'll accompany you to the Manor to copy all of your documents regarding this case. Then we should floo to Grimmauld Place."
"… ended the spell after I analysed it. It seemed to hurt Mr Malfoy the longer it was active. So, there won't be a lot to see, I'm afraid. Maybe a Prior Incantatem for Hermione's wand?" George shared.
“But they can’t!” Harry croaked in shock. He had made sure of that, had spoken in the Malfoy families' defence, unbeknown to them of course. After the war, he had not been able to take another family falling apart because of Him. Tom did not have that sort of power any longer, not if Harry could help it. So Narcissa and Draco had gotten off with house arrest, and Lucius had been sentenced to another five years in Azkaban before he got any chance of parole. As the ‘Saviour of the Wizarding World’ Harry had believed his words to carry some weight. But if what Malfoy said was right, it had been but another useless attempt to make things right.
Too perplexed by the one-hundred-and-eighty in the pureblood's attitude, the Auror reached out, only flinching back ever so slightly when Draco pulled his wand and cast, "Episkey."
With a saccharine smile, the bushy-haired witch replied, "George's new collection. Huge hit at the Ministry."
The Potion Master felt Draco sag for a second before the boy pulled back. Standing tall, he stepped out, meeting his mother's eyes, as he replied evenly, "No, I didn't. Because it was not my secret to tell."
Only when the panic had diminished a little, had he been able to remember that he was not powerless any longer, fated to suffer any predicament he found himself in. Pulling his wand, he had sunken down on the stairs, as to not fall, prepared to blow these blasted snakes to smithereens. Snape had been beyond confused when the railing had let go of him, the moment he had settled, returning to its innocent, inanimate state.
Drawing closer, Robarts hissed, "Stop hurting yourself, Potter. You're of no use to us if you collapse."
"Never," Harry chuckled, "would mean that I have yet to learn the most important lessons when dealing with goblins."
"Really?" Severus inquired, "A child conceived and born in his home, where he has the privilege to watch the pregnancy, would not be considered family by him." Studying his godson, he gave food for thought, "Are you really sure of that?" Then he left Draco alone under the evening sky, with only a cuddly fox for company.
"Friends fight. Even … even lovers do. You told me yourself that Hermione and Ron are on their third set of china."
When that was met with a hesitant smile and a confirming nod, Draco pulled Harry close and claimed a spot in the circle. Apart from Molly and Arthur and the Malfoys, only Bill and Fleur and - surprisingly - Charlie and Ginny had joined them. No matter how little value the Weasleys put on blood-purity and the traditions that went with it, their two eldest children had been forced to learn those they were expected to know in pureblood society. Percy had been the first to put his foot down, refusing to learn this 'useless stuff'. Now, however, as Audrey was swaying in his arms, he clearly regretted this decision. Who had taught Ginny was everyone's guess, but she followed the steps with ease, not faltering once, earning her looks of pride from her fiancé and the rest of her family.
At first, it was merely a shaking of his shoulders, but after a minute he was laughing out loud, gasping for breath. Tears of mirth started running down the pureblood's cheeks, and his joy was so infectious, that after a moment the entire table joined him.
Pressing her hands together, so her knuckles turned white, Narcissa shared, "Harry sent us home. He said this was a Ministry operation and that he can't have civilians in the field."
"Because him sneering and shouting and offering insults that cut far too close to the heart, would at least mean that he is alive. Not this…," he gestured over their patient, "… existence; but really alive!"
"Nothing," the raven-haired replied, fighting with his Auror robes hat simply did not want to open at the top.
When the other nodded, the Potion Master barely resisted the impulse of massaging the bridge of his nose, to stave off a headache. Potter having an existential crisis, sleeping close to none and then stumbling over the familiar. No wonder he had not been able to curb his temper. "Did you consider that his words were spoken in anger?"
There was a knock. Severus barely had the time to cast a 'Notice-Me-Not', before the door was opened, revealing a concerned Ron Weasley.
"Wards has being hurting you?" Emerald had inquired concerned, her small fingers brushing over the abrasions on Severus' wrists.
Getting up post haste, the undersecretary promised, "I'll get Professor Snape for you, and then I'll prepare a nice cup of camomile tea for my boss."
"Tell me about it," the Auror to Harry's left replied drily. "These executions are always either mostly ignored or made into a spectacle, blown completely out of proportion."
On Wednesday, not long after breakfast, there was scratching on Severus door. As he opened it, a shaggy looking snow-fox sat in the corridor, looking up pitifully. When the wizard crouched down to scratch her ears, she allowed it for a few moments before bounding towards the stairs, yipping excitedly. Following, he opened the backdoor, before looking around the kitchen.
Since all members of their group were engaged in battle with two, if not thee wizards, all they could do was stare at the green light, that raced towards Draco. A desperate attempt of a desperate man. Severus Snape was the only close enough, aware enough to do something and the witches and wizards around them had to watch in horror as he pulled his godson close and switched their places. A green shield flared up, swallowing the killing curse and the baffled look of the leader gave the Lady Malfoy an opening to step forward and scream, "Not my child! Avada …"
Nodding gravely, Neville continued, "Nobody has to tell you these things. You just know. And if you do them anyway, sooner or later, the whole world turns against you."
Gently, he shuffled the patient’s socked feet to the side, making room on the bottom of the bed. In the beginning, the man’s feet had been bare, his body only clad in black pyjamas, because – let’s be reasonable – no other colour would suffice. Yet on a particularly cold winter-day, Harry had noticed his feet to be ice-cold. Horrified, the young wizard had instantly bought a dozen soft wool socks, all black of course. Having lived most of his childhood with cold feet, because Dudley’s old shoes and Uncle Vernon’s hand-me-down socks had done little to keep them warm, he had not been able to stomach the idea of his patient being so neglected.
"On the contrary," the man admitted somewhat hoarsely. "The Dark Mark seemed to like another item of parselmagic so close."
"Discuss what?" Severus Snape raised his eyebrow. "The research Draco has done for his mother? Why ever not?"
"Really," her other self confirmed. "But for once, things have to play out the way they are supposed to. After all, this is the fourth time we have this day. Miss Belfast and Mr Welsh went slightly off track, but now I think we have ironed out all glitches."
"You should have told us." The blond berated quietly, leaning against the vanity. He was calmer, now that he had something else but Dolohov to concentrate on.
At that, Narcissa briefly clutched Molly's jumper, before letting her go, recalling her upbringing to regain her composure.
"Hiding under the sofa," Ron chuckled. "I think she assumes that, if Draco can't see her, he can't evict her."
"Harry," Draco prompted after a moment when nobody said anything. "Maybe a cup of camomile tea would not be remiss."
"Why not, Sir? We use Kreacher for our own investigations, as you very well know. What is the difference in having an elf as an asset or as a suspect?"
Chuckling, the librarians all claimed seats at the round table, looking quite at home there, inviting the Auror's to join them with a gesture.
The stern voice of the residing Potion Master made the boy flinch at his lookout. Still, he replied honestly, "Eyedropping."
"Pot… I mean Harry told me to repair a perfectly functioning piece of magic and instructed me to catalogue his books if I couldn't. So, I started on a list." Gesturing towards the desk that sat in the centre of the room, and numerous scrolls that littered its surface. "Usually, when I'm through with a letter, I just double−check with the index, so I won't forget anything."
The same evening, Harry took the opportunity to write to Headmistress McGonagall. There were Potion Masters in Britain, of course, there were. One of them was even working for the Ministry. But somehow, Harry doubted that it would be a smart idea to trust any of them with this secret. Draco, however … if he had Snape's journals, might be able to learn. And if − by any chance − he became good enough, there was the tiniest chance that he could find the potion they needed.
Trudging back down, Harry sagged into his chair at the breakfast table. A glance at the clock told him that barely twenty minutes had passed. Yet, somehow, it felt like a lifetime. When Draco slid the rack over, he gratefully grabbed a square of toast and slathered it with butter and jam. A little sugar surely would do him good.
"Yes … No … Bloody hell, hold still you little devil!" Charlie Weasley sputtered, before finally losing his grip on something white and furry that shot through the garden with excited yips, right into Draco's open arms. The little fox's attack unbalanced the wizard, so he landed on his backside, laughing carefree at her antics, while she gave him a tongue-bath.
Severus had also started taking tea with Andromeda once a week and discovered that - while he enjoyed a different surrounding, despite the witch's house being closer in size to Spinner's End than Grimmauld Place - he only felt entirely at home and safe at the townhouse. Nevertheless, the wizard cherished the chance to converse with someone closer to his own age, and though the two had been nothing but passing acquaintances in the Order, Severus found Andromeda Tonks stimulating company.
When the other merely raised his eyebrows, the librarian sneered, "Every finished book magically appears in my Library. Most sort themselves automatically, but for every witch, wizards or squibs diary, I have to provide a new shelf. Sometimes, even more than one, to kickstart the process."
"Yep," the pixie-haired Cynthia Belfast, the Curator of the British Museum, grinned, hopping up on the research table, swinging her legs. "This is considerably more interesting, and certainly more rewarding than convincing stuffy curators to lend you their stuff, only to show it to pawing people who can't distinguish between a Mesopotamian dagger and a roman short sword."
It was hard for the young Auror to suppress a smile when he realised how much their patient's speech had improved. With the help of Draco's potion, apparently, if the vial on the bedside table was anything to go by. Instead he replied easily, "Draco does."
Slowly entering the kitchen, the boy fidgeted with the journal that contained his latest research. It was an unusual shade of purple, that reminded the Potion Master vaguely of an Aconite blossom. It was an interesting idea to colour-code one's journals, depending on the research. Yet, now was not the time to discuss that. Clearly, his godson had something on his mind, unrelated to the book. So, the older wizard sipped his tea and waited.
Having watched the entire scene from the hated dog-painting, Walburga stiffly stepped around the card-table and studied the last Lord Black. "Of course. And, so do you."
The moment Kreacher put eggs, toast, sausage and beans on the table, on Saturday morning, Ron entered the room with a pigeon-like homing-instinct he seemed to possess whenever food was concerned. Hermione followed at a more sedated pace, actually greeting Harry and Draco before helping herself to some of the plentiful breakfast. Apparently, Draco's cleaning had pulled Kreacher out of hiding, and the house-elf had picked up his duties again, at least when it came to mealtimes. Any other time of the day he was hardly seen.
"Of course, I can," Narcissa confirmed. "However, since I might be involved in something dangerous in the immediate future, I can't make any promises in cases of emergency. I'm through with being a victim."
"Both," Alexander Pince piped up. He had ignored the other three Aurors until now, in favour of paperwork, but now he had something to add. "Aunt Irma once told me, that previously removed data is sometimes returned on a later update when new research indicates that it was legitimate in the first place."
"Lucius," the raven-haired soothed. "It's okay. You're out. Azkaban is over. Voldemort is dead. Shhh … look at me."
Today, the young man discovered, was different. Though Draco and Severus had informed him that they would spend their weekend at the Manor to oversee an experiment, the crushing sense of loneliness was missing. Harry knew that everyone was cared for, so the 'Saviour' could simply take the day off. After some contemplation, he chose his office as a place of relaxation, since it overlooked the garden, making it the brightest room in the entire house. Upon entering, he even opened the window-frames that protected the necklace collection Teddy had gifted him over the years, making the stones shimmer and shine like the greatest treasures.
Only when the door had closed, had the ugly truth of the situation finally caught up with Severus. Here he was, roaring like a mindless beast, lying in his own piss and shit, helpless to do anything about it. If this was his life now, to hell with it.
"I should have been faster," the Auror growled, gazing at the door as if contemplating to knock it down, going after Dolohov despite the Death Eater having been taken into custody already.
Rolling his eyes, Neville threw a balled-up napkin at Harry. He had become quite accurate with these kinds of projectiles since he and Harry had started working together. "Of course, not. We will attend the execution of a known Death Eater you have helped bring to justice. If any newspaper is in attendance, you will explain to the nice reporters how glad you are that our justice system works so efficiently. Because a Death Eater carrying a wand during a Ministry Function is a big No-No!"
"You could make Belladonna and Skullcap work together?" True, he had changed Draco's memories regarding that incident, but they had never gone into details of the potion, as that was unlikely being questioned by the Ministry. After all, they only cared about criminal intent.
"I would not worry too much," Draco commented absent-mindedly. "I switched your Arabian blend to decaf."
Studying the two wizards, Narcissa rose to her feet, drawing their attention. "Harry, I consider this research beneficial. Hence, I would be happy to be of assistance." While saying that, her right hand covered her left wrist with a hint of a smile.
Laughing, Harry put down his half-empty cup. "A collection of self-reading children's books, that must have belonged to Sirius or Regulus once upon a time."
"She won't?" Leewood asked, surprised, from behind the viewing-mirror. He had been looking up possible enchantments for hours Ruby could be under, so he had only caught up with them right now.
That's why Draco Malfoy made a conscious effort to creep up the stairs to the second landing, trying his best not to draw the attention of either Harry or the sobbing redhead that clung to him. The pureblood had never had a brother. He had made himself a family in a few of the other Slytherins of his year. Losing Crabbe had been … for years afterwards he had blamed himself, had had nightmares that rivalled those of the Dark Lord, where he saw his best friend fall into the fire he had conjured himself. But in the end, Crabbe had been a friend, not a brother by blood … not a twin like Fred Weasley. So, in a way, he was grateful that he had been an only child. Hearing the anguish in George's sobs, when losing his flesh and blood was enough to take his breath away.
"Not really," Charles admitted. "From what I've gathered so far, the dungeon-room was under some heavy-duty Fidelius, as was she. Even if she would have wanted to tell us something, she couldn't have."
After his return, however, Harry had the potion master in his home for four more years. He used him as a sounding board, as a confidant, even though the man could not answer. He created an emotional connection when there was none before. Though it was one-sided, Harry feels a lot closer to Snape in my story, than he ever would have in the books. All through Harry's 'depression' when nothing seemed to go right in his life, Severus was there, listening. At least form Harry's point of view. So no matter how 'wrong' this feels to you, please just roll with me.
Trading a look with his professor, who nodded his consent, the young wizard confirmed, "Yes, please."
"And you know that how, Mrs Weasley?" The Auror wanted to know, before snapping at the former Death Eater. "Turn off that bloody shield, Lostrife is gone, and I certainly won't attack you in the middle of the Wizengamot!"
Severus Snape decided that he enjoyed having his brain blown out. Though he preferred to eat and drink without an audience, especially without the little elven child gazing at him giddily. She had a strange, plastic cup with a disfigured mermaid at the side hovering before him. So, he made the conscious effort to reach for the straw and take a sip. It. Was. Divine! The taste of the creamy milk, the delicious chocolate that was just on the right side of sweet and sharp was amazing, and the bite of the alcohol was something he had sorely missed without even realising it.
Shaking his head, Harry pulled his thoughts back to the present, inspecting the jewellery case he had unearthed.
"Harry," for a fraction of a second, the Potion Master hesitated, then he reached out and briefly touched the boy's … young man's shoulder before pulling back. "I am not expecting anything from you. And I surely won't rely on an artefact - no matter how sophisticated and powerful - to stay safe outside of these walls."
Shaking himself out of his reverie about the foreign magic he could feel, the Potion Master took a step through the door and could only gasp at what he saw.
"You might use morally doubtful methods, but you do it for the right reasons. It is hard to fault you for that. In fact, if you were my son, I dare to say I would be rather proud."
"Don't sound so surprised," Ron glared, throwing a pillow at his best friend. "Everything Hermione says works, and we both know it."
Sighing, Harry shook his head. "So, I should cut their price in half and start negotiating from there?"
Even after two hours of interrogation, the witch appeared determined to hold on to said prize. She continuously denied all accusations of being involved in Draco's abduction. Harry was ready to storm the room, but Charles held him back. "She's not lying per se and hitting her with random curses won't be well received. We'll have to try a different approach. Come on, Potter. Let's go."
!" Harry grinned. "King Cobra. Alicia was great at the D.A. She was disappointed, said your Patronus was a Bengal tiger, and she considered her cobra far less impressive. Can't say I shared that impression."
Apparently, with a little incineration, the trio seemed to be able to put the past to rest, since the next question of Ron's yawning mouth was, "Did you make the little breakfast muffins again? The ones with the eggs in the middle?"
Despite the utterly plebeian dinner, the Malfoy men praised their cook and consumed the provided onion soup with grilled cheese sandwiches with gusto. It would truly have taken cold−hearted people, not to enjoy the delightful display of Teddy throwing the spices, Harry had laid out for him, into the soup, demanding from his godfather to stir the concoction every two minutes before taking a sip and seasoning it some more. It had taken quite some time before the young boy had deemed the meal suitable for their guests. Slightly concerned with the overenthusiastic use of spices, Lucius and Draco had taken hesitant samples at first, before finding the dish prepared to perfection. The white−haired man inquired quietly, while the boy was distracted, "How?"
Harry's miniscule flinch was all the confirmation Draco needed. Confidently, he soldiered on, "So if you want me to continue my research …
Checking on the sauce, Draco added a dash of red pepper before praising, "That tastes amazing Kreacher. Very good!" Then he inquired, "What did you expect?"
Tearing her eyes away from her baby−sister, the older woman instructed in a calm voice. "Yes, Harry. You can close the door on your way out."
"Lucius has the chain around his neck, but Draco, …" The witch looked at her friend calculating. "You
"To be completely honest, Harry, I thought that I had trained you better. But if you want, we can brainstorm ideas to breach that particular topic in a socially acceptable way."
Instinctively James and Lily glanced at the sleeping baby, straightening the dark blue blanket that covered him. Harry was not entirely sure how this worked, he was not dead after all. Maybe this child was but a spelled image? No real personality, just … sleeping? He watched his parents and got lost in memories he had not even known he had had. Absent-minded, he whispered to himself. "A warm, cuddly night-sky … that blanket. I remember that blanket. It was in my bed."
Harry, in the meantime, had risen and straightened his formal robes, something Narcissa had insisted upon for the occasion. "Mrs Greengrass, I am pleased to see you in good health. I am afraid I have to impose on your meeting with the Malfoy family since I consider myself their …" 'Guardian' would be a stupid, yet accurate description, no matter how little Harry liked it.
"I was not betraying his confidence," Lucius hissed for what felt like the fiftieth time. "Potter set us up!"
"By Merlin's balls, Ginny!" Stunned, George looked from the envelope Molly had handed over, towards his little sister, who merely smiled at him.
Lucius' dreams seemed to follow him to his weakened state, the following day. Instead of seeing his son, subdued and cowered into doing menial muggle tasks until he broke under strain, or jumping at every hiss from a nightmarish version of Potter, images of his child chained, leashed and trapped in a cage plagued his every waking moment. Especially when he was faced with the store-front of the pet-shop his master's note had directed him to.
Calm Harry watched the agitated young wizard, fighting hard to hide a smirk. "You are right, of course. But then again, I don't think you are any more."
But his friend was already raiding Harry's pantry and fridge. "Go on, I want breakfast muffins. You whip up the banter while I care for the filling and a fruit-salat."
Aware of the need for internet access, Lucius did not bother to correct the other pureblood, merely started the little 'snake'-game that came with every computer and offered it to Arthur. The man took it with the greatest care, tapping away on the arrow-keys immediately. He had discovered the joys of this sort of games when Hermione had brought her first laptop to the burrow.
"Are you sure that's a good idea, mate?" Ron sipped his beer, playing with Hermione's locks while she was leaning against him.
Lucius had tried to occupy it on occasion, but his wife had swiftly discouraged that notion. At the Manor, she had her salon with suitable office space. But since her family was not receiving invitations any longer, Narcissa had taken it upon herself to manage Harry's social duties. Now, she picked up two embroidered parchments, presenting them. "The Lady Greengrass has lost a lot of her social standing, but with her persistent attempts at charity work, and her daughter's employment at the ministry, I think she might gain back a lot of it, within the next few years. To show your support by accepting her invitation, you would benefit in the long run. And not only with her but several other 'dark' families as well."
Shocked, Harry startled, staring at the boy, who wouldn't meet his eyes. Behind him, Draco went very still.
As Lawyers were not allowed to carry a wand during interrogation, Goldsmith had claimed her wand - as well as Sandorn's - as soon as they had entered. Now he placed Hermione's on the table.
Though Snape would have loved to contradict him, he had to give it to Potter that he was right. Still, not willing to give up his resistance so easily, Snape sneered, "It makes … no diff… differ…
"Well, at least we can be sure that your Draco is properly cared for," Pince stated after a long day.
Stepping back, she looked up at her friend. "You are right, Harry is nothing but a boy, even younger than my son. So, let us go and tell him that we will take over. After all, between the two of us, I am sure we can find a way to discover the whereabouts of my husband and child."
Trading a look with Draco, Harry turned back to Daphne and promised, "We'll do our best. But as long as your sister does not want to press charges, I'm afraid that there is little I can do. At least as long as her husband does not endanger her life or breaks the law in any other way I can prove."
He ought to know. There were still nights when Harry woke screaming, reaching out for a man who had fallen through the Veil nearly a decade ago. Nights where his own sobs woke him, because all he could see were Cedric's lifeless eyes, staring at the sky. Nights where he woke suffocating because Hermione's or Ron's tortured screams took his breath away. Some scars could fade, but they would never go away, not entirely.
"The crop." The blond whispered, his fingers started to tremble, and he closed his eyes as if ashamed to admit, "it hurts … so much. I can be perfect!"
Chuckling, because Harry was well aware that Molly Weasley was most certainly not the female Teddy was dressing up for, he corrected, "The Weasleys are on Sunday."
"I know," Harry sighed, tugging at his unruly hair. "You are right of course. Thank you for reminding me. But would you consider 'my liege' appropriate addressing when we are out and 'Harry' when we're amongst ourselves? It sounds far less demeaning, don't you think?"
"You know," Rose pondered. "I think you are right, daddy. I think he does not know how to be a proper fairy yet. And he was dressed in black. And he was not very nice. He called me imper...something, and I think that he should not have said that. It didn't sound nice. And he did not even have wings!"
"Thank you," the man stated, and if Harry or Draco noticed his eyes being a little red, and his fingers travelling to his sleeves more often over the next few minutes, neither mentioned it.
As it was proper, his vassal was walking slightly behind him, but swiftly caught up to make a quiet suggestion, "My liege, if I might be so bold to offer advice: talk this through with Narcissa. Before our wedding, she aspired to become a healer. Of course, she gave up on that, to take her proper place in society," he added hastily as if the thought of his wife holding a proper job was somehow offensive. After they had used the floo, Lucius added somewhat hesitantly. "Maybe, she could be of help."
"I have to be," Harry sighed. Nodding at Neville, his partner stepped back, so he could apparate to the other side of the stone circle.
Patiently, as if talking to a child, Draco explained, "Had you ordered an additional helping for me, you would not have to share." Then he gestured with the nearly empty cup. "Go on, I think after the day he has had, Uncle Sev could do with a good laugh."
Rolling his eyes at the ever-occurring argument, the young wizard wanted to know, "Do we have any pictures suitable for this room?"
bag, Potter!" The pure-blood sighed, because - despite all the hardships his family had suffered - he would
Once the door snapped shut, Narcissa mumbled, amazed by how easily her sister interacted with the younger wizard who had become family by being godfather to her little nephew as much as being cousin Sirius' heir. "He has become a great man. Better than any of us could have hoped for. With his political pull, he could be anything, even Minister of Magic. Yet he works as an Auror and lives in a house that resists him at every turn."
"Why?" She straightened and looked around, not seeing much due to the lack of light. "It was not you who abducted me."
Scrambling off Harry's lap, the young boy shared exited, "Hi, Neville. I saw a pretty flower today. One that looks like Luna's ear … ear …" Frustrated, he turned around, "Nana, wasit called, the thingies Luna has in her ears?" When his grandmother did not give him the desire attention, he shouted, "
"Draco, Narcissa, I am sorry, but you will need these bracelets. Lucius will be expected to stay by my side at all times. But you are still under house arrest; strictly speaking. So, the ministry only agreed to let you leave the house if you wear something with a tracking charm."
A line separated the triangle into two, equal parts. "The Elder Wand. Draco won it from Dumbledore when he unarmed and paralysed him, and Harry won its allegiance from Draco when he disarmed him later. You see, the Elder Wand has a mind of his own and wants to serve only the strongest masters."
Working diligently on the sacrifice−case, Harry nearly forgot about the hearing of Lostrife until Lucius reminded him three days prior. They had set up regular meetings with Malfoy's charge and his correspondent in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. As a defender, the former Lord never learned what part of the information he gathered was relayed to the public attorney. But according to the brief conversations during lunch Harry and Hermione shared twice a week, everything was going as expected.
Severus had woken screaming the first time he had suffered that dream. And Harry Potter of all people had been there to comfort him. He had clung to the boy like a pathetic limpet, beyond grateful that the wizard had chosen his bed as a resting place for the remainder of that night. Severus had been mortified, when the memories of the night had come back to him. How could he have lost his composure so spectacularly? The composed, self-assured man he had thrived to become his entire life was gone.
George staggered through the floo next, practically falling into Draco's arms. "Oh, my lovely dragon," he cried out. "I read our love is not meant to be. But how should I ever live up to the gorgeous 'boy who lived'? I am heartbroken, Draco. Do you hear me? Heartbroken!"
"Anyway," Harry tried to stir the conversation back into the original direction. "Drake's a Rune-Master. He
Clenching his fists, the other shook his head. "Yes … No … I don't know!" He snapped, then repeated in a whisper, "I don't know, okay? It's just … the idea of him leaving, of being alone again … As soon as I became part of our world, he was there. He protected me because he had promised mum. And he hated me because I looked like dad. But … Severus never turned his back on me. Because he didn't like me to begin with, no matter what the general public said or thought. He was just there … I … sometimes I had the feeling that he was the only person I knew exactly where I stood with. Then, the night of the battle, everything changed, and I finally got it. And when he survived, and I brought him here, he was just sleeping, … in a coma I mean. But I still talked to him, and I imagined what he would say in return. And now … I'm not explaining this very well, sorry."
Recalling the night Pince had caught him bringing in his family and friends to help with the ritual at the British Library, Harry knew the wizard understood. Still, he confirmed, "No, it isn't."
Since Malfoy seemed ready to topple over, Harry invited him into the living room and once the blond had received a strengthening cup of tea and Harry had donned sweats and a long shirt over his tread-bare sleeping pants, he demanded to know, “Alright, what do you need?”
Gesturing towards the majestic animals, Lucius explained. "An experienced rider like myself can see that they are not broken in."
Forty-nine of the most potent witches and wizards of their village cast for several hours, then Harry was pulled through – what seemed to be the centre of the Earth – and landed on wet grass, surrounded by stone monoliths. The British wizard fell to his knees, ready to weep. He had not known, had not understood how much he had longed for the magic of his home, until Harry felt it surrounding him again, caressing his skin, his very soul now that he was back. Looking around, he wanted to chuckle, because of course, where else could he land but in the centre of Stonehenge, the stone monoliths surrounding him like sentinels of a time long forgotten. He sent back a small, wet stone, as they had agreed upon, something infused with the magic of his home before the connection closed all the way. Something easily transportable because it had no life.
kind-of-brother. The goblins might be greedy bastards, but they don't have a say what their employees do in their free time. And this operation has to go down in the middle of the night, anyway. Otherwise we won't have the slightest chance to keep it hidden."
"No, … I, …" the raven-haired stuttered, before he was pushed out of the conference room by his team-leader in search of food and pure-blood appropriate beverages.
advanced potion texts for one of my essays. However, when I boasted about my outstanding mark, he snatched the paper and discovered the plagiarism."
The youngest Weasley beamed happily, upon entering, when she saw him sitting up. "Harry, you look better. What are we doing today?"
When the blonde woman patted a pouch on her belt, he nodded and continued, "Hermione, Narcissa, Lucius, Ron and I will start with the cleaning. The supplies are all there."
Harry was lost to his own fears. He saw Lucius strung up, bled dry like some of the victims the Children of Hecate had already claimed. And Draco, … chained down, beaten, bloodied, scared to death! Why had he not talked to Narcissa, Saturday evening? Had he made sure of Lucius' prompt arrival at the Manor, she might have told him about Draco's plans of returning to Grimmauld Place. Harry could have waited, gotten back to her when her son had not arrived until midnight. Why had he been so careless?
Chuckling under his breath, Harry shook his head. "You couldn't if you tried. Join me, Draco." Ignoring the pendant, Harry walked down to his office, opening the door to invite the other man in. "It's okay as long as I am with you. I was only angry with your father for entering without my permission."
After lunch, leftover soup and fresh sandwiches, Draco came to the decision that he liked the part-Veela. Despite thinking that Beauxbatons was putting too much value on beauty and too little in power, he learned that, while the French-girl did everything with grace and gentleness, she had a core of steel and enough skill to back it up.
"Yes," Harry smirked, eyes travelling lecherously over Draco's throat, a gesture that made the blond tilt his neck in response. "That will offer a nice contrast." Slowly the raven-haired raised his hand. It might look languorous to an observer, but Draco could see the offer for him to retreat. However, he had chosen his side, so he pushed into the gesture, allowing Harry to caress his throat. "Eight inches ought to be enough, ten the most. We want it nice and snuggly."
Judging the capable, young wizard, Narcissa wondered how someone so strong could harbour so many doubts. On the other hand, Augusta Longbottom had always had the highest expectations for herself and her family. She could easily see how that might stifle a young child that was unsure of itself. "What changed?"
"And rightfully so," Severus nodded. "At Hogwarts, you would have never put that much attention to detail into your work. It is good to know that you do so now."
Neville burst out laughing, spraying crumbs involuntarily. "Oh, he absolutely knows. That's Draco, Lucius' and Narcissa's son. Didn't Harry tell you that he's collecting former Death Eaters?"
It was fine, Draco tried to convince himself when he retreated to his room. He had spent the last few days on an uncomfortable, transfigured sofa in a hospital room. Se, he was more than happy to spend a restorative night in his own bed. Only, these past few weeks had taught him that his night would not be as relaxing as he had hoped. He had not slept through a single one since expelling Potter from his room. Yet, what could he do? Inviting the other man to stay would certainly send the wrong message. Draco just wanted to sleep, but that did not matter anyway.
Surprised, Percy looked up, but when Harry resized the massive chest Lucius had gathered, the studious Weasley dug into it head first. There were children's books, tomes on the development of pure-blood fashion, Percy immediately took that one out and offered it to Audrey. In her spare time, his wife enjoyed designing clothes. She could not sew to save her life, but all of her drawings appeared life-like, and last year she had even managed to sell half a dozen of them to a designer in Paris, Fleur had known through her family.
While Lucius Malfoy enjoyed the triumph of losing, Harry and Neville tried desperately to corner the culprits of their muggle sacrifice case. All evidence pointed towards an ancient house and even the two Aurors had to admit that the aura of the place felt somewhat familiar. Still, something was not right. Anti−apparation wards surrounded the property and even their colleagues from the Magical Analysis and Examination Department (Sub−department of both the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the Auror Corp) confirmed that anybody setting foot on the estate would trigger a plethora of alarms. Judging from the reports, Harry and Neville would be able to circumvent these measures, but somehow this all felt too easy.
Sighing, the blond turned around, leaning against the door. Maybe he too should clarify a few things instead of merely picking up the other's clues. It would give them both some security with this arrangement.
Surprised, Narcissa asked, "How can you say that? I have seen you change your hair a dozen times today."
The former Lord and Lady Malfoy never looked away from Harry's face during that announcement, never sneaking a peek at their son, who tentatively reached out for the treat on his plate and chewed it with a blissful expression on his face. "I'm afraid we are not exactly prepared for an overnight stay," Narcissa admitted, squeezing Harry's hand under the table. "But maybe your house elf would be willing to remedy that."
"I don't know," Harry admitted, stealing one of the tiny bread rolls Emerald had tried her hand on in the afternoon. "Maybe something along the lines of black pudding, preferably raw? He did seem the vampire type at school."
"I won't even grace that question with an answer since you know perfectly well who I am talking about. But what I will do is offer an inquiry: If Harry or Draco were in your shoes, and you could help them, how would you feel if they just ignored you and went about their ways, possibly hurting themselves in the process?"
Taking a breath, the young man nodded. "It did. Saunders … Healer Saunders told me later. While Katy needs glasses for the rest of her life, she recovered. But, there are scars all over her face. Had she been a little more cautious, maybe a little more afraid of making a mistake, none of it would have happened. So I get it." He looked up and steadily meeting black eyes which - seemingly for the first time in their lives - watched without judging. "You can't teach eleven-year-olds respect for an art they have no hope to understand. But you can put the fear of Merlin into their hearts, so they will double, and triple check every ingredient they put into a cauldron. Just because they want to avoid being the focus of your ire."
Biting his tongue for a moment, Draco debated with himself, if it would be smart to make a request. In the end, his craving won out. "Would pancakes be too much of an effort?"
Turning towards Draco, the raven−haired continued, "You don't have to come with us today. Grimmauld Place needs a lot of work, and if you wish to stay, I would suggest you start with the library. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of books, but they resist every index−spell I throw at them. It's quite inconvenient. There is a vast amount of knowledge, but short of reading every volume top to bottom, I have no way of accessing it."
"How long are they at it, today?" The blond inquired while adding a splash of milk to his mother's cup.
"He was just trying to be polite. Harry has a 'saving people' thing, ask Hermione. You can't be sure that this is what he wants or what he merely thinks
A hissed spell flared up around Daphne, shielding her away from the unexpected magic. Whipping around when the spell shot past him, the young Auror admonished, "Is this the way you deal with all of your problems, turning back time or making people forget?"
Turning away from the window, folding his slim arms before his chest, Severus Snape shot a glare at his nurse that would have had seventh years ducking for cover. Regrettably, Emilia Nightingale was not easily intimidated … or at all, as he had learned these past few months. Hence, he made an effort to repeat as composed as possible, though her persistent denial was driving him up the wall. "I am a Potion Master. Once upon a time, I was the best there was in the United Kingdom. Considering that, I think it is entirely reasonable for me to start brewing again. I have studied the last few years' developments dilig… in detail and now wish to test a few of them. I have been out of bed for the last two weeks. I have even done some light gardening. So, I think it is safe to assume that I would survive to stand in front of a cauldron. For a few hours, at least."
"Doubting Thomas, prepare to be amazed!" The young muggle-raised chuckled, before explaining, "the doubting Thomas is …"
The next morning, Harry found the papers in his office in disarray but thought none of it since he had never banned Kreacher from cleaning this room.
Chewing on his lip, Teddy admitted reluctantly. "Harry and I were talking about bad words." Hastily he added, "But I won't use them again. Promise!"
That evening, Severus found his godson in the garden after dinner. Lucius and Narcissa had already departed, and the Potion Master had had a craving for fresh air and a firewhiskey. He was surprised to find Draco nursing a tumbler, with the bottle by his side, watching a patchy white-grey wolf digging through some leafs. The young man flinched when he claimed the other lounge chair and helped himself to some whiskey.
"Good," the young wizard nodded. "Now, as Master of this house, I order you to be open and honest with me at all times. I demand you tell me the truth at any given time and not try to avoid or to omit any information about myself, my guests, my family and friends, you of course, or anything that is going on, on any of my properties you have any knowledge of. Do you understand what I expect of you?"
But the ghostly figure interrupted him. "Don't, Harry. I know George has talked to you about it already, but to make sure that you really get it: What happened to me is not on you!"
"He bent them a little … maybe. But in the end, he paid his toll. Ignotus had seen what his mad bid for power had cost Antioch and how Cadmus had suffered when reaching for something he was never meant to have … or any mortal, really."
"Oh, I'm furious," Narcissa replied calmly, making Lucius flinch involuntarily. "But not at you, my dear. However, these Children of Hecate who had a hand in your incarceration … and …" Averting her face, she obviously fought for composure.
Not wanting to go into his vassal's betrothal contracts, Harry shook his head. "But friendship … that's really the best you can hope for?"
Distracted by the excited family, Harry shrugged, "About twenty months on and off. At first, Justin did not dare to ask her out. With Ginny being a famous Quidditch player and all. When she finally convinced him to give them a chance, he insisted on making the manager position at his company. He works somewhere where they deal with the import and export of dangerous and fragile goods. He was a travelling salesperson before but wanted them not starting their relationship without at least one of them remaining stationary. After his promotion, they put down the commission for a little house near Eton."
century and his great-great-granddaughter Sybil strengthened and added to them more than two centuries later. The last Black descendant who could do that was Calisto Black, who, incidentally, was the one who laid the foundations for this house in the early seventeen-hundreds. Of course, it suffered during World War II, but the magic in the cornerstones was strong enough to keep it from destruction. You understand?"
"Yes, Professor," was the weak reply, before the young witch and wizards followed her into Snape's room.
"She's a she!" Charlie confirmed with a chuckle, handing Draco a bowl of raw meat. "Put that in the corner, and she will be in there faster than you can say 'Quidditch'."
To avoid conflict, the young man had decided to make himself as sparse as possible. The more he hovered in the background, the better his chances of avoiding a confrontation.
Still laughing, Harry sat Ginny down and approached the Hufflepuff he had once protected from Draco's conjured snake. "Good to see you, Justin. Welcome to the family." Holding out his hand, the latest arrival mirrored his easy smile and shook it. Then, as etiquette demanded, he turned towards their hostess. "Mrs Weasley, thank you for inviting me. Mother sends her best and had me bring some meat-pie. With your permission, I would like to put it into the kitchen for now."
Harry had steadied himself with Severus' help, and was roughly scrubbing over his face. Grateful, he squeezed his former professor's arm before addressing the panting, "So you're more like my parents than you were before; with more memories?"
Now, Hermione Granger-Weasley had surpassed all these petty emotions and had entered the realm of ice-cold fury. Everything was crystal clear in her mind, like when a complicated case finally unravelled itself to show her a clear path to the conviction or acquittal she was aiming for. She knew what had to happen. All that was left was finding the right way to do it. Somehow, she was grateful that Sebastian Goldsmith, the Auror who had taken on this investigation, refused to budge and leave the room, since she was not entirely sure what spell her wand would offer, as soon as she laid her hands on it. It would certainly not be pleasant, at least not for Sandorn.
During the last Quidditch -match of the season, happening during a thunderstorm, the beaters of the Slytherin-team had been hit by a storm-wave and had collided mid-air. The two players had been knocked unconscious, tumbling to their deaths. Only the closest players had even been able to spot the disaster through the heavy rain. The three Ravenclaw-chasers had thought incredibly fast on their feet and conjured a blanket between them, catching their unconscious opponents. They had lost the Quaffle. And the Slytherin-seeker had caught the Snitch, oblivious to the crisis. The game had been called to an end the moment the chasers had touched down on the pitch with their precious cargo. A rematch had been discussed, but even the Ravenclaw captain had to acknowledge that his chasers had forfeited their game and that it had been the right decision. So Slytherin had won the Quidditch cup of 2001.
With a soft smile; one the raven-haired hated her for since she never showed the same love when talking about her older son; the witch admitted, "Of course, I knew. This is my house after all. I was not aware of the location of Regulus' lab after he had guarded it with the help of the trice damned house-elf he had this unnatural fondness for. But I was aware that he was brewing in my house. He was not discreet enough when purchasing his ingredients."
Rolling his eyes, the Potion Master continued, "Are you aware that very few marriage contracts contain a fidelity clause?"
"Only you, Harry," Bill shook his head, exasperated, "Only you would have a house that requires a blood sacrifice to dispel foreign magic!"
"Where's Hermione?" the brunet Auror wondered, opening the door, calling to the first assistant he could spot. "Get me Hermione Granger-Weasley from the Department of Law."
Leaving for one of the lower salons, Harry cast a Tempus and set an alarm spell, so he would not miss dinner. He had just stretched out on a plush sofas when there was a loud knocking on the door. Determined to strangle whoever took time away from his nap, he threw the door open, only to come face to face with a member of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and Daphne Greengrass, who had started her training in the Inquisition Squad about the same time, Harry had begun his Auror training.
"You're welcome," George relaxed back into his armchair, pulling Angelina back on his lap, while she still seemed absorbed in their travelling plans, nodding at Harry with a smile of gratitude.
"Desperately!" the raven-haired admitted. "But I have no clue of how to make it stop. How to make him see that I am me and not the mirror image of Tom he seems to fear."
Raising his eyebrows, Lucius looked down at his son. "And you stopped squirming in your mother's arms. I fail to see the drawback."
Then he made haste as Severus' insistent voice called for him from upstairs, ignoring the pink tint on Draco's cheeks at the compliment.
As if the other was not even speaking, the raven-haired asked, "So you can't recall an invisibility cloak? One that's power hasn't faded, doesn't waver but hides his carrier entirely?"
Pondering that suggestion, Narcissa agreed, before nodding towards the two squabblers, "Would you, darling?"
Ever the sensible one, Hermione shook her head. "You can't take a child away the moment he or she shows magic. The parents will never agree to that."
All of you, please stay safe and indoors. Stay healthy because everything else can be managed, but your health and the health of your family is more important than ANYTHING else! Stay strong. This too will pass.
"No," the former Death Eater relented, "but had I not insisted on working with you, these Children of Hecate would never have paid you any attention."
"Not really," Ron had shrugged. "The twins were brilliant but received the initial investment from an outside source." He looked at his best friend, who messed up his hair, embarrassed.
An hour later, Harry indicated a kiss to Astoria's hand and shook Regina's firmly. "Mrs Greengrass, Miss Charl-ton, thank you for having me. It was truly an enlightening evening."
When the Lady paused, the young witch tilted her head. "Circumstances that will change in a few years."
"If there is a written word on a containment, binding or enslavement spell, rite or ritual, you can bet your last gallon, that the Black Library at least contains a passing remark. Especially since you have returned all the books that were confiscated during the war. My mother's family was known for getting their way … as is my mother, now that I think about it. I wonder what that says about my parents' marriage." He added on an afterthought.
While the Lady Malfoy shared their concerns, Harry crouched down before his red-headed friend protectively and added, "Not only are the Malfoys are missing, but Hermione Granger-Weasley as well."
He did not need her encouragement; had only shared the details of his conflict with his liege, because she had cornered him a week into the new year when she was 'fed up with the kicked puppy look,' he had apparently been sporting whenever Harry Potter had been around. The discussion had been rather enlightening.
Casting an air-cleaning charm absent-minded, Draco explained before Harry could fly off the handle again. "Yes, I know that you have done nothing to feed that fear. But remember the tent. Even with the locket gone and the war won, you still could hardly breathe in a surrounding where terror had reigned for so long."
Having expected the elf to pup-up at his back, Harry was already glancing over his chair. "When Albus Dumbledore first cast the Fidelius Charm on Grimmauld Place, did he have to include you?"
Inari hovered for a moment, clearly torn between following her wizard and waiting for a chance to sneak some leftovers. Harry, however, cleaned off his plate before nudging open the door. "Go on. He shouldn't be alone right now." He could not help but smile as the little fox dashed out of the kitchen.
Knowing when she was defeated, Daphne hugged her sister tightly. "Promise me to be careful. Swear it!"
"You always used the light-brown oil to polish your broom and Freddy used the dark one. It was easy to tell them apart." Ginny recalled, smiling at the memory.
Shaking her head, Narcissa contradicted, “I am not talking about your legal claim, but that of your blood. Look at the carpet, Harry. Sirius Black is no longer part of this family, so how could you be?”
Watching her husband from the ground, Narcissa could only agree when she heard Hermione Granger explain to her daughter, "Remember, Rosie, men never grow up. The only thing that changes is the nature of their toys."
It had not been his first hostage situation since joining the Aurors. It had not even been his first time as a negotiator. His name held more influence than his skill, despite having gone through the appropriate course twice. Tonight, however, had been his first time that the hostages had been kids. A squib - the one responsible for running the orphanage that played host to this crime - had threatened the Ministry that she would poison her charges if her demands were not met.
When the head of the division started his speech, the vassal tried to edge towards the back of the crowd. While everybody seemed joyous and carefree, he doubted that they wanted to see a former follower of the Dark Lord in their midst. The persistent Miss Granger, however, seemed determined to thwart his attempts and he only understood why, when the Head Barrister came to the end of his speech. "… and all of this would not have been possible without the unexpected help of one person. A person who has worked on unearthing the true motives of Augustus Lostrife. Without your help, we would have continued to flounder in the dark, despite having our best witches and wizards on the case. Rest assured that we will be ready to work with you again, despite your current … limitations. So, thank you Mister Malfoy. Your support has been invaluable."
Tenderly brushing the tips of her fingers against the young man’s cheek, she smiled. “Not for him, for you, Harry. You have no concept of the debts my family owes you. I can’t promise that I will succeed. But picking up needle and thread is no hardship.”
People spoke up around him. But their words did not make sense. Why was there this horrible, loud noise again?
"What if I mess this up?" He asked concerned. "I don't know the first thing about childcare, even less about house-elves."
So, on the 20th of August - 11 days from now - I'll have this surgery and I have to admit that I'm really, really looking forward to it. I put a lot of time and effort into becoming a healthy and happy person and this is the last step of my way.
"No, I think it's better if this stays between you and your 'servant'. If we spin this right, they won't have a reason to call him in."
Trying to make sense of his godson's somewhat jumbled speech, Severus inquired, "When did he tell you that?"
With a soft smile, Harry nodded in agreement. "He offered to spare you three times. But when you remained stubborn, he killed you. Then he tried to kill me."
He thought about the elf. How absent Kreacher had been these last few weeks, but not in the same way as before, where Harry could spot him doing his self-appointed tasks, muttering insults under his breath. These days he was simply gone, except mealtimes, since Molly providing them with food seemed to have hit a nerve. Harry had never particularly liked Kreacher, not with the way he had insulted his godfather at every turn. Nor had he disliked him, especially after the elf had started to take care of him after renovation. Kreacher was just … a constant in Harry's life. Like the painting of Walburga, or the continually creaking hinges of the entrance door. Determined to resolve this situation, the young wizard called out, "Kreacher!"
"Nev, you can't …" Ron began accusingly, but the brunet shot him down. In a hard voice, he lectured, "If you want to be a part of this investigation, you will do as I say. Understood, Ron? I know how you feel. You want to do more. You feel as if you are betraying Hermione by taking time to rest. But tell me something: what would she do if your situations were reversed? Would she make use of all available resources, even if they came from Snape, or would she try to soldier on, even when everyone else takes some well-deserved rest, to function at peak efficiency?"
Returning to his meal, taking a measured bite, Lucius ignored Hermione's chuckled confirmation, "Well, I would say
Another croak made her pull back and Draco offered a spoon full of water. His voice was quiet and strained when he shared, "We were worried."
Laughing out loud, his little sister promised, "Oh, I will get you for that, do not doubt me, but no, this is not revenge. It is cheap because Harry went out of his way to contact a few acquaintances he made during his time in India. Several of them agreed to host you. The portkey will activate at 1 p.m. on the 31
Leaning against the backrest, Harry mumbled, "He went to Azkaban for twelve years, without a trial, because Peter sat him up. People were so afraid at the time that they were not thinking clearly."
"Don't lie to me! It's two in the afternoon. I doubt that your banking business needed nineteen hours to complete!"
been tortured at Malfoy Manor, and he had killed, even been killed if the rumours were true. Things like that changed a person. The white-haired wizard swayed on his feet, lost in the horrible scenarios of being, again, helpless to protect the people he loved.
Trying to tame his hair, he sighed resigned. At least she had not screeched from the top of her lungs. Still, this was unacceptable. “Lady Black, we have talked about this. You don’t verbally abuse me in my own home, and I don’t cover your portrait with pink spray-paint.”
Shaking his head, Kingsley claimed a seat at the expanded kitchen table. When Emerald climbed the bench beside him, various pots floating around her, the man offered the cup Draco had just sat down beside his elbow. "Coffee, please, one sugar." After taking a sip, he frowned.
Easing the tremors, he had forcefully suppressed until now, the blond nodded. "I'll do my best, my … Harry."
That argument, however, was brushed away easily. "It's not as if I have a lot of need for it these days."
Harry lay awake that night. He told himself that the occasional twitches of magic he felt - most likely remnants of the ritual - were keeping him up. But in his heart, he knew better. Ever since the battle - the day where he had thought Severus Snape to have drawn his final breath - after handing over the last piece of the puzzle to Voldemort's defeat, Harry had been determined to not lie to the man ever again. For the last five years, that had been quite easy, since the other could offer neither reply nor judgement. Now, however, things were different. Still, Harry had tried for an honest answer to an - as it turned out - rather complicated question. Now that answer was haunting him. All through Hogwarts, he had worked towards becoming an Auror, bringing dark wizards to justice, keeping Albion safe. He had reached that goal. Harry worked his 'dream job'. So why had he not been able to answer Snape's question with a simple, 'Yes"?
Not having slept as peacefully as had become the habit in Grimmauld Place, the Malfoy family sipped an early tea not long after dawn, when Harry stumbled through the front door. His hair was unruly, even more so than usual, and his robes appeared frayed at the edges. The toll this night had taken was visible on his face. His pale complexion made his blood-shot eyes stand out even more. Gaze gliding past his guests, Harry did not seem to be all there, but he wolfed down the sweet-smelling porridge Kreacher had placed in front of him before stumbling out of the kitchen.
Breathing through the painful memories, rubbing his fist over his chest, Harry shook his head and breathed out, "No, … it's quicker and easier than falling asleep."
"What about a fruit-tree?" Draco suggested. "Look at those Kumoi trees. They will grow quite well next to the Shell Cottage and every year, Victoire will be able to enjoy the fruits of your labour. Literally. Also, fruit trees need a lot of care. You would have to go over at least once or twice a month to make sure it's alright."
Rolling his eyes, Harry tried to recall what Charles Young, the Auror crops' psychiatrist had told him, "There is no measure to trauma or pain, Draco. No scale you use to say: yes, these events qualify for a person to develop PTSD and no, this is not 'traumatic' enough. Even a few minutes of torture can be enough, and apart from Lady Blackwood, you basically were in a hostage situation from 14 to 17 in your own home. No matter how reluctant, Voldemort made you a warrior in his war. I think all of that, with the abduction as icing on the cake, is enough to drive anyone nuts."
Hermione! He needed to talk to Hermione and Ron and Neville and maybe contact Seamus, whose father had not even known about magic, despite his wife being a witch. Maybe Harry was hopelessly naïve and would never change the way the wizarding world perceived others. But if he could create a foundation for change, his godson would not be viewed with trepidation or even fear. Change brought on fast, needed a dictator and dictatorships never lasted. But if you took your time - a generation or two - people could come together. Those who had fought Voldemort would have children themselves and remember where arrogance and prejudice had led them. Harry just needed to help people to get the right idea, because - as history had shown - nothing was more powerful than an idea that's time has come.
"And you walked out of the Ministry with a convicted Death Eater you've gotten out of Azkaban." Draco finished tonelessly, looking like he was about to be sick. "They sacked you because … because …"
They were guided into a private office, and once Griphook entered, the young wizard demanded, "We would like to visit the Black family vault."
Looking at her, Harry stated seriously, "That your sister won't be admitted to St. Mungos but end up in our morgue. I have seen such cases, Daphne, and though we try the husband with the full force of our law, it doesn't bring back their victims."
Chuckling, Ron looked over his shoulder. "Oh, yes. He and your 'love interest' came in about half an hour ago. They are in the back garden. Hermione is helping them to set up a cage."
"Take whatever piece of fabric you can find and wash it. We need to get this stench out of the house, and that means not only clothes and linen, but carpets, cushions, drapes, and sofas as well. Leave the leather-covered furniture to me. I'll make sure it's spotless once we are through."
– why you think it’s a good idea to put two Death Eaters into the same room. We want Lostrife locked up, not help him to forge escape plans with one of his former … business associates.” He spat out the last word, making it very clear what he thought of the pureblood at the back.
Though the handwriting was kind of shaky, the young man could read it just fine. Nodding, he pondered, "Draco has been talking to you."
At that question, Neville somehow reverted back to the insecure boy he had been for most of his Hogwarts years, avoiding eye-contact, nervously rubbing his palms over his outer robes. "I thought, … the first time you saw them at St. Mungo's, you kept your distance. I knew your life with your mother's sister was not all sunshine and roses, like the general wizarding population was led to believe. I'm not an idiot, you know. Your small stature and hand-me-down clothes you were wearing in our dormitory painted a pretty clear picture. Also, the wonder in your eyes at every meal, where you were allowed to stuff yourself full was a dead giveaway. That's why I thought, … I thought you wanted to have nothing to do with them. That you hated them because of them not being able to care for you, was the reason you had to return to the Durselys, every year."
At the door, Harry held Neville back. "Listen, get me a copy of the files, okay? Maybe I'll be able to think of something we haven't found yet, so we can lock this bastard up for good."
"You were his only friend," Harry accused weakly. "Can you imagine how hard it was for him? Why do you think did he join Voldemort? He wanted respect and appreciation, and Tom promised him just that." Sighing, the raven-haired looked at the two people, approximately his age, whose only worries had been a rude Slytherin and a prophecy. They had died for him. However, they had never lived through the challenges he and others had had to face. Calmer, he admitted, "I know that Severus Snape is no saint. He's a prejudiced bastard, who made my six years at Hogwarts hell. Yet, still, he did everything in his power to keep me safe. With his dying breath, he even gave me the knowledge I needed to defeat him."
"Because I want to make our world a better … a safer place where nobody has to be afraid of being attacked, simply because they are muggleborn; or discriminated because of their creature-status. Most of Tom's remaining supporters are fanatics!"
"What?" he challenged, but while the redhead merely raised his hands, Harry could not help but tease, "So, are you enjoying my dessert variations?"
Neville, however, replied dispassionately, "Seventh year, when we were surrounded by Death Eaters and had to use all our bravery and cunning to survive."
After a moment of contemplation, the other wizard wanted to know, "Are you familiar with the phrase, 'Sanctimonia Vincent Semper'?"
Not long before lunch, Harry opened his eyes and groaned, "I must have been more tired than I thought, to sleep on three cups of coffee. Usually, Kreacher's brews keep me awake until midnight."
Two days later, Harry received an invitation to the annual Halloween Feast at Hogwarts, along with his friends.
Losing his patience, Draco interrupted, "None of this, answers my question about him being here of all places. He should be at St. Mungos or any other clinic!"
"Hey," the raven-haired whispered. "It's okay. I'm sorry. I promise I will put contingency plans in place, in case something like the Children of Hecate happen again. I will make sure nothing will happen to you or your parents. Alright?"
"Yes," the other wizard stated drily. "But since you choose to ignore all corresponding concerns I have brought to your attention, a week into our arrangement, I can't see it becoming an issue now."
“Sorry, I didn’t catch that. Could you please repeat yourself?” Head Auror Roberts stated calmly. Meaning, he gave Harry the chance to change his mind about what he had just said and offer a different opinion. Usually, Harry jumped at this chance readily, adapting his stories so they would cause the least inconvenience for his superior. He respected the man who, despite recruiting him the moment he had set foot on British soil after his gap year, had always offered an open ear and an unbiased opinion when Harry had asked his help.
After lunch, Severus had demanded some paper and pencils and had started practising his letters like a child. Emilia had not protested the exercise, knowing that it would make no difference, no matter what she said. The witch had only forced a half an hour break for tea and sandwiches on him, around five. After that, she had left him to his own devices.
Tilting his hand, the young wizard watched his friend fade away. The last time, the stone had given him the strength to do what had to be done. This time … it felt like losing Fred all over again. Through teary eyes, he watched George capture the little gem in its protective casing and then allowed the redhead to pull him into bed. Harry was grateful for the messages, but on nights like these, he sometimes wished for everything to be over, so he could finally be with his family again.
Draco was here. Lily's son as well. Did that mean that the boy had changed sides? Yielded in the final battle to save his family and friends? Had he himself been captured? Was he about to be tortured? Where was his wand? He needed his wand! Otherwise, he would be completely defenceless.
"No, mum," he comforted. "Hermione put him in stasis when we found him terminally wounded. We successfully performed a ritual with Minerva and Poppy to put him in a magical coma. We only found a way to heal him a few months ago."
"Ron's pregnant again!" Harry burst out, hitting his head to the table. That information had not been his to disclose, but after talking about such sad topics for so long, he had felt the need to show George that they all had a bright light in the future ahead of them.
Pondering over the absurd description of his owner's activities, she followed the elf, finding Harry doing precisely as Kreacher had predicted. The young man was kneeling in a corner, hovering next to what seemed to be a heating shaft. Kreacher drew his attention by mumbling under his breath, "Graceless half−blood, kneeling in a dusty corner of his own home. Undignified wizard!"
"No, I did not! You asked me carefully formulated questions, and I offered well thought-through answers."
"Cadmus was Ignotus' older brother. His family ends with the Gaunts. Tom's mother descended from them. The family heirloom, a ring, was used as a container for one of the Horcruxes. Tom never knew what power the ring actually held. Even I only discovered it by accident. And Antioch … I don't know the exact story of the Elder Wand. Only that Dumbledore had it, and through a weird set of circumstances, it came to me."
Narcissa seemed to contemplate begging leniency for her husband, but after what he had done, she knew that harsh punishment was inevitable… deserved, even. Glancing at Harry for a heartbeat, Draco offered his arm. "Mother, join me. There is something I would like to show you."
Studying the picture and then Lucius, the Lady shrugged. "I consider this quite accurate. A little muted perhaps. But I assume the muggle technology is to blame for that."
Studying the newcomer with his tweed-jacket and elbow patches, Severus met the wizard's doubtful gaze before he reassured the man, "Though my godson's mixture is slightly toxic, I can assure you, that it works exactly as advertised."
Scrambling to obey the judgemental tone of the house-elf, since Kreacher had taken an exceptional liking to the medi-witch and had proved quite vindictive in the past if his 'masters' were not making an effort. He thrived to leave all but the best impression. The two sat in the kitchen after but twenty minutes, Harry's hair tamed for once since he had combed it back, while still wet. Trading parts of the Daily Prophet and the muggle newspaper Harry was subscribed to, Draco noticed the date. "You force my father on a shopping trip into muggle London on the first Saturday after Christmas? You are positively evil."
After a brief dash into the kitchen, where the raven-haired spotted Emerald under the table, creating a somewhat unstable tower with their good silver, he merely traded a nod with Kreacher, before climbing the stairs up to the third floor. Entering Snape's room, he barely bothered with the sheet the assistant on night-duty had filled out. There never were any changes anyway.
Within the hour, the house started to fill with the scents of roast and cookies, tempting Hermione to the kitchen. Lucius had just been engaged in a game of 'Wizards and Wands' with Rose, while Harry was helping Ron with the salad. He startled when Rose screamed, "Hugo!" jumping down from the bench she had kneeled on. His startled look prompted a chuckle from his liege, who merely gestured towards mother and daughter. The little girl was hugging Hermione, kissing her belly. After putting her ear on it, she glanced up.
"Absolutely not!" The former Lord shot back. At Harry's surprised look at his insistent tone, he elaborated, "Narcissa is delighted by her current task. For so long, she stood in my shadow, played the dutiful wife, as to not endanger our family. Now, however, she has found a project where her intellect, as well as her organisation skills, are appreciated, even needed. I certainly won't take that from her."
Confused about the topic but unwilling to admit it, Severus had tilted his head. "And how do you know that?"
Ron's eyes nearly budged out of his head, when they entered the Potter vault, and later the personal vaults of Euphemia and Fleamont Potter. It seemed that, in the trials and tribulations of the war, James Potter had not had the chance to integrate his parents personal belongings into the main Potter vault. However, the once jealous wizard offered no comment. So, Harry did, "You know that I would share all this with the two of you in a heartbeat. We could justify it as settling a life-debt since you two have been saving me constantly since first year."
Visibly rolling his eyes, the elf snapped, "Since Master Harry and Master Draco will sleep together, Kreacher packed only one bag. Master had enough on his hands with the food!"
Bowing again, this time somewhat apologetic, the elf informed her, "A moment, Mistress." Then he vanished into thin air.
When Lucius left the interrogation chamber, an hour later, he came face to face with the witch and wizard who had watched and most likely judged every word he had spoken. Of course, it was the Head Auror who wanted to know, “So, are you about to tell me that Lostrife is telling the truth about the Imperius and should be spared a prison sentence?”
Only when the creature was out of sight, did Harry let go of his wards and turned towards the masses again. He took a breath or two to centre himself before searching for Dolohov's former mistress. A malicious fire was burning in Lady Blackwood's eyes. However, the young Auror would not let himself be goaded. Were that the case, he would not have made it through second year's potion class. He merely met her eyes and allowed himself the tiniest smile as she departed. Seconds later, he was swarmed by reporters. This time, he was very well prepared. Neville - and Robarts - had given him the run-down of the message the Auror Department wanted to express.
Trading a wide-eyed look with her sister, Narcissa seemed as lost for words as her husband for being given something in the first place. Andromeda, however, having been included in the planning, tilted her head, when receiving her package. "Not at all, Molly, thank you very much."
"Harry," his father's gentle tone made him look up. "Son, I know you hate Peter. And from what you've told us, you have every right. Just … just maybe try to see the situation from his point of view. He was so brave at Hogwarts. He became an illegal animagus just to help Remus, though he was terrified. But when the real enemy came, when Voldemort targeted him, he was all alone. I abandoned him to protect my family. And Remus and Sirius did the same."
“No,” she snapped. “The magic of the carpet is just stubbornly resisting me. Once I was finished adding cousin Sirius’ name, it incinerated.”
Apparently, that was the right reply, since Draco sagged in Harry's arms and after a few minutes, they were able to return to the others.
"What?" James had snapped sharply. "Those competitions are dangerous! Wizards have been killed. Why, by Merlin, did we allow you to participate?"
Finally, he pulled out the platinum and emerald cufflinks, holding them out to Draco. "My dad obviously had a thing for such jewellery. He must have collected at least twenty pairs. Do you, … would you like to wear them?"
"To be completely honest, Harry, I thought that I had trained you better than that. But if you want, we can brainstorm ways to breach that particular topic in a socially acceptable way."
Harry smiled and hugged Hermione from behind. She put her hand on his shoulder, still tired after the long night they've had. Together they watched the three wizards studying the black-and-white picture. When Snape gave it back, Harry kissed her head and whispered, "Time to face the music. Give Rose a kiss from me and tell her that I love her."
But Lucius held up his hand. "I made a mistake, many of them in fact. My desire for power and glory made me follow a madman, and our family has suffered for it. It could have cost the lives of all of us, and more than once, it seemed like it might. Considering this grim prospect, let us be grateful that only our freedom has been taken and that your mother is still unharmed."
"This is your house!" Draco insisted. "It's entirely your business. It's just … our relationship is going to be complicated. Mine and Astoria's I mean. I think it would be easier for all parties involved if she gets as much autonomy as possible. Every interaction besides the conceiving of my heir will be a bonus."
When Rose dashed out, Ron had to muffle his explosive laughter with both hands. Tears of mirth started streaming down his cheeks. Between gulps of breath, he snickered, "A file on how to be a proper tooth fairy for Severus Snape because clearly, he is not very good at his job! I am so giving this to him once she is finished. And I will take pictures!"
"Is father gone?" Draco asked from the doorway after Severus had finally settled with some biscuits and a fresh cup of Earl Grey.
Once the offenders were dealt with, the Head Auror Robarts approached the cut-off area where the Dementor was hovering. It was not a 'cage'. The wizarding world had learned from their past mistakes. Abused creatures were just too easy convinced by honeyed words and empty promises. Though the Dementors were no longer confined to Azkaban, they were still available for administering the Kiss to irredeemable criminals. Currently one of the hooded figures floated over a wide area that was bordered by a huge, prowling wolf and - strangely enough - a blazing white duck that flew in circles around it. Holding out his hand, the wolf approached his wizard and Robards reminded the dark creature, "Dolohov and only him. Like we agreed upon."
"Oh," the blond tilted his head. He had not thought about it that way. Severus' journals had been used to help the man, but now … "Maybe I can find something in the books of your library. I have not been over all available volumes that mention potions."
I'm sorry for not posting last week but this chapter needed a little more time. However, I promise it will be worth it.
"Leave the door open," she had commanded. So, in full view of that sadistic bitch, Draco had torn off his bloodied clothes and stepped into the shower. However, on an impulse he had pulled the platinum cufflinks Harry had lent him off his shirt, and hid them in a small niche between counter and wall. As soon as the water started, his clothes had vanished. He knew that he had no chance to stop the bleeding. Fortunately, as Draco discovered, all whip-marks had been rather shallow. One Episkey and they would be healed. Sadly, his wand had not made it into the room with him. All he could do was hit the cold, letting the icy spray slow the bleeding. He had doubted that she would accept blood on his clothes as 'proper attire'.
There are likely to be no more updates in August. This story is NOT abandoned, NOR slowed. It's just me. That's it. Go on now and have fun with this chapter. It's a brilliant one if I dare to say so myself :).
"You could stay here, you know," Draco interrupted quietly. "Harry would invite you in a heartbeat. He has a 'saving people' thing."
With baited breath, she pulled back her hand and watched the scarlet colour of her blood seep into the stitches. Nothing happened until an arrogant voice from one of the paintings reminded her, “You married, my dear niece. You are a Malfoy now. That means you have no say in this family any longer!”
After the other wizard had taken a few calming breathes, he clarified, "I am offering, Draco. I am not forcing anything on you. I want to reward you for services rendered."
of December was spent in quiet contemplation. Both Harry and Narcissa had been determined to honour wizarding traditions and had taken to baking bread and pies in their kitchens. An hour before sundown, everybody gathered in the living room of Grimmauld Place.
"Anyway, what about this crazy idea, that you will leave tomorrow? Your body still needs sleep for about twenty hours a day! The medi−witch wants to keep you for at least another four to five days!"
"Don't," Harry hissed, interrupting George with vicious fury, making him look up in wonder. Until now, his little not-brother had always taken anything George had thrown his way, calmly. He had suffered through his tantrums for the last five years. He held him through his tears and had helped him nurse the inevitable hangover George suffered the next day. Not once had he reprimanded the redhead. But now there was a fire in Harry's eyes, as he shoved his index-finger into George's chest. Hard! "Don't you dare say 'Ron'. You have no right to trade your brother for mine, not even in your mind! Do you understand? What would …"
"Oh, love," she chuckled. "If I have learned anything about you in these last few hours, it is that you desire neither fame nor glory and least of all, power. So why would you keep a wand with a history as bloody as this one?"
Shaking his head to wake himself up, Harry snatched Draco's cup and served himself some tea from the always steaming pot. "Ah, Earl Grey. How did you manage?"
Recognition and something akin to understanding lit up Lucius's eyes, as he watched her son wrestling with his little companion. Truthfully, he had not given the fox he and Harry had rescued during the Yule hunt another thought, after departing from the Weasleys. Draco, however, seemed to have done the exact opposite.
Anyway, thank you all for your patience with my hiatus. Yesterday my lower bodylift operation was exactly 1 month ago and I'm still in the awkward healing phase where everything itches and a part of the scar won't close and I'm a little inflamed and everything is just crap. I'm occasionally holding a pitty-party for one and often think 'Why did I do this to myself?'. But then I look into the mirror and I have a waist. A WAIST!!! I've never had one of those. I was always slightly chubby as a child and not that athletic when I was a teenager. So actually having something that resembles a figure is amazing for me.
"More than I deserve. So, you see, my liege, fleeing my own home is but a small price to pay for my wife's happiness."
Looking at the Malfoys, who put a lot of effort into hiding behind their Slytherin masks, the head of the Weasley family took a deep breath. "No love is lost between the two of us, is it, Malfoy?" He had to admire the pure-blood, for his composure when facing the vast number of Weasleys scrutinising him. "It takes a strong child to question the teachings of his father, and an even stronger man to rethink his own convictions. Once, we debated our convictions of what counted as a disgrace to wizarding kind. We had to agree to disagree, … with flying fists," he added self-deprecating, before returning to the matter at hand. "However, things have changed. I think we can realise now, that we are more alike than we ever wanted to acknowledge. In the end, for both of us, all that we did was supposed to be in the best interest of our family. Therefore, I would like to invite you to stand by my side, on this hallowed night so our families can celebrate together."
Doing as they were told, the Black-sisters activated the spell that turned their watches into an imitation of the Weasley clock. Trading a quick glance, they discovered wordlessly, that both watches had been equipped with not one but two hands each. Tilting her head, Narcissa spoke quietly, "This gift is very much appreciated." 'Especially the 'Mortal Danger' section she hoped the boys' hands would stay away from.' "Thank you, Molly, … Arthur."
Though the patriarch of the Malfoy Family had initially been irritated by the invasion of privacy the librarians had dared to commit, he was not blind to the boost of morals his wife received from working with them. Ever since these witches and wizards had come along, Narcissa had been calmer, more confident and more focused. Back in her own element. The years under the Dark Lord's boot had taken their toll on all of them, but these days, Narcissa was slowly turning back into the vibrant witch Lucius had fallen in love with. So he could not really disapprove of those librarians, even though the bubbly witch treated every flat surface in the Manor as her personal chair, and Manson was walking in and out of the Malfoy Library as if it was his own. Fortunately, every last one of them showed the volumes his ancestors had collected the respect they deserved.
"Fuck." The raven-haired mumbled, squeezing himself past Neville, who still stood frozen in the doorway, not taking his eyes of his former professor who stood beside the herbal patch, studying their unexpected guest with an unreadable expression. When Harry turned, worried about his friend's reaction to the cutting tone, he found Neville's focus shifting. A lesser man would have stepped back when faced with the Auror's impassive face, and Harry bemoaned the shock his usually so expressive friend had to experience. Yet when their eyes met, Neville merely pulled out his wand, and stated. "Petrificus Totalus!" Harry's body snapped together, his partner pointed his finger at him, and growled, "You deserve that, and you know it!" Then Neville tipped against Harry's head, making him fall over. So, all the raven-haired could do was listen in to the conversation that was taking place in his back garden.
Nobody seemed to think it that strange of a behaviour. Lucius and Narcissa, however, traded soft smiles with Arthur and Molly and all four nodded appreciatively. There were worse things imaginable than their boys hooking up. They were good for one another.
And it was true, though his liege had surprised him, Lucius still appeared quite collected and regal. Chin lifted, back straight, only his eyebrows gave an indication of him not having been prepared to have his picture taken.
Brushing away the gratitude, blushing a little at the praise, the other Auror shrugged, "Your request passed my desk the moment I wanted to leave. I knew that they would either sent you a newbie or some Death−Eater−hating bigot, who got punished with weekend−duties. No matter how much you would have tried to make it a nice day, our colleague would have blocked you at every turn. I asked Luna, and she told me that the horses on her father's land would certainly enjoy a ride. Hence, I decided to twist your words a little and voilà, cleaning duties for the Malfoy family. No member of the department would find fault in that."
"She was," the young wizard shrugged, choosing a deep green cover from the wardrobe, "And I was what she thought she wanted. The ideas we had about each other, about how our life together would be, helped us to push through. But once the war was over, … I don't know … nothing was how we imagined it to be."
A knock on the door surprised him since his friends were all accounted for and nobody else should know the address. Harry had never bothered to end the Fidelius on the Order's Headquarters, he had merely allowed it to wear off since it kept the harassment from the reporters to a minimum. Therefore, he was astounded to find Daphne Greengrass standing in the doorway.
"Yes … No … Bloody hell, hold still you little devil!" The redhead sputtered, before finally losing his grip on something white and furry that shot through the garden with excited yips, right into Draco's open arms. The little fox's attack unbalanced the wizard, so he landed on his backside, laughing carefree at her antics, while she gave him a tongue-bath.
The raven-haired realised, even in his alcohol-induced haze that he too, one day, would need an heir to the Potter and Black Lordships. Yet, the thought of spending the rest of his life with a random woman who considered their marriage an 'arrangement' turned his stomach. In the end, Draco seemed stronger, putting duty above all else. Maybe that's the way it had always been, and Harry … admired him all the more for it.
Mute, the platinum-haired shook his head. No, he had never asked, since he had been all but convinced that he would not be able to live with the answer. Finding Potter in Draco's bed, his son defending the man's right to be there, had been his worst nightmare. Or so he had thought at the time. The truth was, he wished to know as little as possible about the 'deal' his only child had struck. The reality of the young wizards' interactions painted a gruesome enough picture as it was. His wife, however, was determined not to allow him the luxury of ignorance any longer.
Wordlessly, the two youngest Aurors communicated before Neville turned towards their colleagues. Yet, before he could give any kind of explanation, Snape pulled back the invisibility cloak and cautioned, "Two out of three, Mr Longbottom. Not here."
"But that's the point of my potion! Our magic might originate from there, but that is not the only place where it is stored. With this brew, all of a person's magic is drawn into the core. Thus, giving the ritual a much higher chance of success!"
Rubbing his face, the young wizard complained. "Why does everything have to be so bloody complicated?"
"Harry," George interrupted concerned. "The Tale of the Three Brothers is a myth. It's not real. The Hallows don't exist, they …"
Startling out of his pacing, the young Lord looked at his distressed elf, and his anger softened for a heartbeat. "Kreacher, I know you did your best. Neville is right, go home and no punishing yourself. Keep me up to date should someone come."
Glaring at one another over the threshold, Harry finally tilted his head and took a step back. "Would you like to come in?"
Starring at the young wizard who had saved them all, out of the goodness of his heart and more courage than anyone could expect, Lucius lowered his eyes and whispered, "I am sorry, my Lord." Because what else was there to say? The Dark Lord had expected blind obedience, right from the beginning. And though the pureblood had had some pretty solid views on several topics, he knew that he had adjusted them when Voldemort had expected him to. Now Harry wanted … not exactly the opposite, but a conviction Lucius was not sure he could muster. Still, he could try. "Harry, I …"
"I see," the wizard stated, then he pulled open the door and rushed up the stairs. Draco followed on his heels. The Potion Master needed a few moments to orient himself in the setup, then approached the long shelves that lined one wall, inspecting the available ingredients. "You copied my setup."
Studying the shivering boy, the older wizard assured the concerned couple. "I will take it from here. Mrs Granger-Weasley, Mr Weasley, you may go to bed now."
"That 'Magic is Might', Harry?" Hermione asked suspiciously. "Don't tell me you started to believe that people like Ron and Draco are better than you and me just because both of their parents were wizards."
That prompted a small smile from the former Lord. "The brightest witch of our age, marrying into one of the bloodlines of old? How could I? If at all, I am jealous."
Closing his eyes against the rising hope that this would not become yet another useless attempt to make things right, Harry nodded decisively before looking at his friend. "If we succeed, it will be worth it a hundred times over."
“No clue,” Harry answered Neville’s first question, wrapping the dripping figure into the quilt they kept on the sofa for their power-naps when a particularly trying case went on too long. “When I came in to tell him that showering for nearly an hour was pushing it, he was clawing at himself, whispering frantically ‘Wake up’ under his breath over and over again.”
"Rent," Severus decided after a while. "You will charge me rent. For the last five years … and every week I live here … from here on out."
Draco had then left for the Weasley-Granger home, gratefully accepting a cup of English Breakfast, while feeding Inari. As soon as the little fox was settled, he had returned to Grimmauld Place. The afternoon had been an exercise in futility, since studying his godfather's notes and being actually able to brew the poison-extracting-potion were two completely different things.
Lost in these memories, he passed Sandorn on his way to Hermione's office. He was grateful when the wizard did not even grace him with a look. Inside, he chose the file the witch had requested, before brushing her wand into the topmost drawer of her desk. All ministry-desks had shallow drawers at the centre since it was not allowed to bring a wand to an interrogation. That right was reserved for Aurors and appointed guardians for certain convicts. Usually, Hermione heeded these rules, putting her wand away before heading for an interrogation, but today they had had a lot on their minds. Anyway, it was time to return. This … interview … they were conducting, no matter how frustrating, was necessary to bring their case along.
Snickering, because no, Harry would never be part of the higher culture that thought about meals in fancy French terms, still he knocked on Draco's bedroom because the blond surely would. When no answer came, he peeked in, before turning towards the library. Sighing he hoped that his new room−mate slash servant would at least have used the couch for his nap, despite having little hope for it.
What a strange concept, both the conversation and having a master to watch out for his well−being. Lucius had followed the Dark Lord, had tried and succeeded in harming this young man. Yet, all that did not seem to matter anymore. How strange of a concept to bend his will to someone so quickly. A person who actually was concerned with not only his physical and mental well−being but that of his family as well.
Pale but composed, the blond clutched the Auror's arm for a heartbeat. Soothingly, Harry stilled Draco's trembling fingers, where they lay in the crook of his elbow. "Trust me. I won't let anything happen to you."
When they entered Hogwarts two minutes after seven, the Headmistress was already waiting for them. They did not question her ability to make them feel like unruly students, with a mere raise of her eyebrow. A swift wave of her wand had their clothes clean and dry and after a brief, "Thank you, Professor McGonagall," they followed her to the great hall.
give me the job, straight way, but also expected me to finish my N.E.W.T.s before allowing me in the field."
The sun was already colouring the horizon when Harry slipped into the guest-quarters. Being here, brought back so many memories, good and bad. But in a way, Hogwarts was still the first home he ever had. So, when Harry's head hit the pillow, he was asleep almost instantly.
No matter how good Ron had become at brewing, Draco was still better, understanding potions on a level far surpassing the redhead. Therefore, Ron had no qualms doing the 'menial' tasks of cutting, dicing and grinding. In the beginning, the blond had been surprised, but his inquiry was met with but a shrug. "We all have a vested interest for this to work. You are our best chance, so I'll do whatever I can to support you. Just like I do with George."
"Potter, may I?" The Auror inquired politely. Everybody knew that it was rude to scan someone's property without permission, and a thrall was, after all, considered a possession. Apparently, Harry was oblivious to that general understanding, since he looked questioningly at Lucius. Without being too obvious about it, the former Lord tilted his head ever so slightly and stepped away from the wall. Hands folded behind his back, he presented himself to the Auror.
Then he quietly left the room, specially adapted to the needs of a man who − against all expectations − had survived Nagini's bite. But as it was so often the case, Harry was not content with the people he cared about merely surviving. He wanted the man to live again. The problem was he didn't have the slightest clue how to achieve that.
Surprising no one but the platinum-blond wizard, Justin simply accepted the handshake, but Hermione brushed away the gesture and went in for a hug. "You are most welcome, Lucius. I know you will put it to good use."
Tapping a particular line on the parchment, she revealed, "Astoria has had two miscarriages so far. If she suffers a third, I am afraid her body won't allow another pregnancy."
Raising his eyebrows, Draco shrugged, "We are not stupid, you know. Mother, father and I know that we have nothing if we fall out with you. Whatever you expect from us, we will provide it!"
Harry's views on the divine, reflect in no way my own. Religion and beliefs are always a very sensitive topic that easily offends. That, however, is in no way my intention. Though I consider myself Catholic, I consider many forms of religions valid (no matter the name they give their deity, be it Buddha, Allah or anything else), as long as they intend people to be kind to each other and help those in need. I think that at times even the smallest things can help a person along, sometimes it only takes a smile, an open door, or bringing coffee to a colleague who is really stressed out. Whatever you believe in, I think it is perfectly right if it helps you to feel loved and protected, even (or especially) when you go through a hard time.
Subsequently, Emilia shook her head. "So, it can't be the reason for his attack. There is no magic to it." With a sigh, she gestured for the door. "Leave."
"Dashing," Harry offered with a small smile. "It really matches the colour of your eyes," the raven-haired commented, though he was well aware that all thoughts of his appearance had fled from Draco's mind, as he had gotten sight of him. Or more specifically, what he held.
Seventeen minutes later, Draco looked slightly better. His robes were pressed, and his hair washed. He still looked exhausted, hence didn't bother to protest when his godfather pushed a plate with eggs, toast and butter at him and instructed, "Eat!"
Laughing, shaking his head, the younger wizard returned to his preparations for the New Year's dinner. "Do not think that I don't appreciate you trying, Lucius, because I do. But you will have to forgive me for saying: None of your bloody business! What goes on between Draco and me stays between the two of us. But rest assured, that his magic is in no way restricted. If I insult him and he desires to hex off my bollocks, nothing will keep him from doing exactly that."
"I remember, …" Lily mumbled, lost in thought. "I always thought that he avoided me for doing too little, too late. And after a while … it just got too hard."
