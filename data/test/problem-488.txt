"Cough it out, Malfoy!" Ron grumbled as he too had arrived and had been watching the whole exchange up until now. "What got Harry to do with you or the notebook that you are holding? You're disturbing the whole practice."
Then a taste of pleasure as blood and flesh explode in my mouth. Satisfying my hunger and emptiness inside of me.
I snapped out of my mellowing and just look at his face as he asked me. My heart went different kinds of seizure as I thought of the possibility of a relationship with Draco but my mind throws me off, with a 'How about Ginny?'
"Its confidential, Ginny. I can't tell you." Mrs. Weasley had laid down the bacon that was newly cooked in the serving plate, with a great sigh. " I just wish that it will be solved immediately."
Sighing heavily, at least Hermione and I have come up with ideas and that's a start! I didn't want to be more depressed with my situation. I needed to be strong for myself and Hermione. It was the less, I could do for her, she has been sacrificing her education, her time, and her dedication - to be with me.
Flying has always been able to make me relax. The wind blowing past me, cool and calming. The sky wide, with few clouds that cover the blue horizon. The Sun shines gently on us. I was hovering above the Quidditch field on my broom, helping our captain in the supervision of the team as they practice for the upcoming match with the Ravenclaw, 2 days from now.
"Remus, don't tease Harry too much." Billy chuckled, huskily. "He is still in a daze. Its seems to be last night, you and Ginny had a good time!"
Glaring at Draco as soon as I heard his insulting words at me, but he was unfazed by my grimace as he continues to eat with a smirk on lips as he picks up his spoon again.
Oddly, Draco stood firmly with a blank face, that I never saw on him. This was not the reaction I would get from him if it was the usual.
Anger flooded me, charged towards her. My hands grabbed hard the edged of the sink, as the hands turn white from the force of my clutch. I feel sudden fierce hate towards her washing through me.
Sweat poured out profusely, soaking my skin. I could hear my heart beats loudly in my ribcage. As my nerves wreak havoc within me.
' Never judge a by appearance, what house they belong to, or their manner of speaking. I guess a Gryffindor can also become friends with a Slytherin.' I thought as I stared at Draco's face.
Standing up from the bed as I stretch my body; twisting my hips and pulling my back muscles with ease. Again, no ache. Usually, my body would have some pain from adjusting because of my transformation.
Fear clogged my throat. I have gone too far. This dangerous! I should stop it now. Malfoy is much like Hermione. Intelligent enough to puzzle out my current condition. The relief that I had just felt, disappears immediately. Instead panic replaces it in my chest.
Sighing as I walk across the Gryffindor's common room, towards my friends, wanting to clear my mind. I sat beside Ginny as I took my notes ready to distract myself. Potions really take up your time, much to my chagrin with our Potion professor.
Michael had turned pale from Hermione's speech and both his friends had nervously chatter at his back.
' You'll find out very soon, Harry - darling! Soon you will.' She giggled, dark as it sounded. 'For now, open your eyes, Harry. And have a feast, fill yourself to your heart's dark desire.'
"I have fixed his abdomen as I had put back his guts inside him but-' Mediwitch Pomprey said as she must have been near.
"Is red-heads are your type as well?" He sat elegantly across us, on the cushioned chair then, raised one of his legs, laying it over his other leg. Making a way for the bathrobe to reveal a large portion of one of his pale thigh to me.
Startled by her call, I flinched but was able to control the shudder that threatens to surface from my body. Not wanting to offend her, I immediately sat up erect and squirmed on my seat as I felt the pressure from her stare and inhaled the strong smell of cooked meat that awhile ago had me hungry but is now making me feel nauseated.
"Scared?! Ha! You wish, Corner!" Ron stood suddenly from his chair, following his lead was Fred and George.
It had been hours later or at least it seemed like hours instead of minutes when finally Hermione erected the barrier around us, far stronger than the previous one that we surrounded our tent. The first large acromantula came crashing unto the barrier with a loud bang, screeching in pain as it was thrown back from the rebound effect of the barrier then a second later the others followed. One by one leaping and running towards us, only to be hinder by Hermione's barrier.
But I can not blame her, she must have kept it for a long time from me and just burst out from her when her emotions were high.
A blast of strong magic came from my core flowing to my wand then shifted to the Hobgoblin. Unable to react on time, the Hobgoblin got sliced into half separating his upper body from his lower body, making tremble in fright. I was not ready for the strength of my magic. I cursed and spun around with disbelief in my eyes as I look at Draco and Hermione for answers.
"I could tell by how you reacted and based on who you are, Potter." he smiled at me, in a lazy and kind of affectionate way,  that it made me squirm uncomfortably as I realized that it felt strange within the pit of my stomach, not horrible but more of a pleasant feeling. "I could easily guess how your brain  works weirdly." He smirked in a teasing way.
I already scolded myself for feeling this way and I am weird out with myself when I know that Draco was just going back to Hogwarts. I could still see him in summer break or maybe in the Christmas break. If he could spare a bit of his time to see us.
"Here." He reached out then took my hand placing a small pouch. "These could help you to curb your hunger for the meantime."
Reluctantly, Hermione continued in a more determined tone as the topic shifted to the possible solutions that they have theorized.
"Yep!" He answered with hype as he gathers all the scraps of paper and walked towards the trash can and throw it all out. He took a fresh parchment and his feather, dipping it in the ink, and began writing again with his make-up predictions. Shrugging, I followed his example cause I am fed up with trying to make a decent Divinatiuon assignment. We continued predicting our doom days this whole month for another hour while the other people around slowly left for bed and emptied the common rooms - leaving me and Ron having the whole room for ourselves. After finishing my Divination assignment, I move up to my Charms assignment, which was about the movement of wands when conjuring a spell when the portrait hole opened and Hermione entered the common rooms. She was carrying a stack of books in both her arms as she made her way to us, placing the books with a loud thud as she laid down on our table.
Harry blushed and looked down as he answered, “I knew what I wanted in a ring for Draco so I had Father ask the goblins to search for a ring like this. The closest I got was a rose gold snake, but that didn’t perfectly symbolize my Dragon. So instead I had father write down everything that I wanted for Dragon’s ring and commissioned the goblins to melt down the rose gold ring and make this one. I added the stones to remind him that our love would burn brighter and hotter than even dragon flame.”
“Lucius, I need you to go home and tell Narcissa to prepare a room and have numerous potions ready to go.” Snape says as he pulled out his wand and started casting spell after spell. His father apparated away without another word. “Draco help me support his head while I pour a Blood Replenishing Potion down his throat. It should help stabilize him.”
Hermione looked around at the complaining bitch that Ginny was, the whining brat Ron was, the manipulative cunt Molly was, and the manipulative old goat that Dumbledore was and thought only four words… “What have I done?”
“Alright my boys,” Dumbledore said looking towards them, “You’ve had your fun but now it’s time to undo this prank. It really wasn’t nice of you two to throw people out of here without clothes on.”
“Malfoy?” Harry said hesitantly, hoping he had identified the voice correctly. “Hedwig delivered my note to you?”
“Well, we’ve had a long and stressful day. I think it’s time for bed. Anything else that needs to be discussed can wait until the morning.” Lucius announced after he managed to calm himself down.
“Do you mean the invalid one that Dumbledore and Mrs. Weasley made that they had no right to as neither one of them are Harry Potter’s legal guardian in any way, shape, or form?” the goblin said with a sneer in his voice.
“Okay, Okay, I’m cool. I’m calm. It’s just, I wish they would all just die.” Aidan says with a sigh, putting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Dumbledore watched the mysterious man disappear down the hallway and frowned. He needed to know who the man was so that he could find that man again. If he could find that man again, he could convince the man to tell him exactly what went on during the meeting. If Dumbledore could figure out how much Harry knew then when he did damage control, it would be a lot easier.
After Harry took out his wand, the goblin began. “I _insert your full name here_ do hereby claim all Lord and heir rings that belong to me and have been withheld, either legally or illegally, from me. I also decree that from now and until I approve of them, no one will be able to access any accounts under my name using any previous permission of approval either by note or by key. I also require all keys to my accounts to be given back as well as a note saying who had them and why.”
After they made it to Tom’s office with Lucius, whom they picked up on the way, Tom started to speak. “Now, before I give you what you asked for so that Lucius can approve, I wanted to ask you if you would do something for me.”
“What?” he says shocked. “No that can’t be possible. He’s never done anything that damaging ever.” Slowly his magic started to swirl around him chaotically, matching his thoughts.
“Of course. Bill is a goblin friend and will not have to pay for sure. The Weasley wins are good entrepreneurs and are well liked as well. We hope that we can continue to do business with you.”
I'm so sorry for taking this long to update. I've just been so busy. Last week my dad got married and I was one of the bridesmaids in the wedding and school managed to get harder on top of that. This one is shorter than my others but I'm hoping to make it up to you with the next one.
“Ah, ah, ah.” Narcissa taunted waving it out of reach. “You can wait to find out who the marriage contract is. When Draco comes home with Harry and the Dark Lord, then I’ll tell you all who else is on the marriage contract.
HP: (Harry ducks down a little, almost sheepishly. Draco Malfoy, whom I had forgotten was still there wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder as if he were comforting him.) Yeah. This summer, my uncle took things too far and beat me up almost to the point of death. When he finally left, I wrote a note to anyone who could help and then blacked out. I woke up and Draco here, was there to help me out. We moved into the safe house so that I would stay safe from Voldemort as well as keep away from the Order, who would most assuredly force me to go back to my relatives. He’s helped nurse me back to health. A few days ago I got an owl from Gringotts saying that my godfather’s will would happen tomorrow. Draco and I decided to have you come and do an interview before we got accosted in Diagon Alley for being near each other or something stupid like that.
“Harry, you do know that you’re the third person that we’ve met that can tell us apart and the only one outside of our family that can? The only others are Bill and Charlie. No one else even tries. If we’re alone and they come talk to us they just call us Fred/George.”
“We don’t know my lord. The car was gone but most of his things were still there, which makes me think that they’ll come back sooner rather than later.” Severus answered for them since he was the last to leave the seen. “All of his school supplies were locked in the cupboard underneath the stairs. His wand, a photo album, and a blank parchment were all located underneath a board under his bead wrapped in his invisibility cloak.”
Aidan and Draco walked down the hallway together, looking immensely powerful together as they made it to Rita’s office. When there, they opened the door and were heard saying “How would you like the story of a life time?” before the closed and no one heard anything.
“Yes,” he said, his hand twitching towards his wand. “Like I told the goblin. I was summoned to the room that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are in.”
“Yes.” Harry said with a sigh, “Those attacks happened because I had reason to assume they were doing some absolutely terrible things. I sadly found out that I were right. They were testing on werewolves. I found them in the process of doing some of their ‘tests’ on children. Their screams haunted me for weeks afterwards. Everything went red and I demolished them for it.”
“Harry, my boy. We’ve been very worried about you. You shouldn’t have left your Aunt’s house. Where have you been?” And there was the head chicken himself.
“May I present to you Lord Aidan Salazar Riddle, lord to the houses Potter, Black, Evans, Gryffindor, Emrys, Le Fey; heir to the Houses Riddle and Slytherin.”
As Aidan and Draco crouched down to repeat what they had done with their other familiars, the two shadow foxes untwined and scampered towards their owners. They were still young at only six months old, not yet old enough to mate, but still old enough to not be considered cubs anymore.
“And what, young Malfoy, was so important that you had to interrupt my meeting with your father?” the Dark Lord said softly also looking slightly irritated by having his meeting interrupted. Draco was glad that the snakelike body that the Dark Lord had gotten in the ritual after the Triwizard tournament had been temporary and he had regained his human looks. Malfoys do not bow to half snake creatures.
“I would prefer for you to call me Marvolo instead of that name, but yes you may talk to me later. You never answered Severus’ question though Potter.” Tom said somewhere to his left.
Last time: The shop they walked into was a cacophony of sounds from snake hisses, kitten meows, bird calls, dog barks, and a bunch of other animal sounds from the many magical and nonmagical animals. The sounds made Aidan flinch due to his sensitive hearing.
Narcissa, whom had been the one to shout, was bouncing up and down in barely restrained joy. Lucius and Tom smiled proudly, while Severus still sat in his chair, not really knowing how to respond.
“We’ll be here when it’s over.” Draco said helping to get Tom to leave his son in the hands of the goblins.
“Now,” Tom says when all were settled in the apartment above the twins’ shop. The twins were seated on the only couch, while Harry was seated in a love seat along with Draco, who had been dragged to sit next to him. Tom was sitting in the only chair facing towards everyone else. “Harry you can take off your glamour.”
“Hello?” he called, trying to find someone who could tell him where he was since obviously someone had gotten the note that he had sent with Hedwig.
Tom ran towards the door and wrenched it open before Draco could even comprehend what was happening.
Draco was outside in the gardens when he heard a hoot. He looked up and saw a white owl with red splotches. As it came closer he could see that the red splotches were actually blood. It landed right in front of him and he realized it was Potter’s owl, Hedwig, or something like that. She hooted again and he finally saw the note in her claws. Wondering why Potter had written to him, he picked up the note. The first thing he realized was that it also had blood on it. Horrified, he read the note. After he finished, he carefully picked up Potter’s owl and ran inside to find his father. Calling a house elf, he asked where his father was and heard that he was in a meeting with the Dark Lord. He told the house elf to take Potter’s elf to the Owlry and take care of her. Deciding that this was more important than anything they were talking about, he burst into the office.
“I shall wait until you’re finished and have sent them off so that we may talk about Order business.” Dumbledore said taking down the privacy charm around the room.
And Mrs. Weasley, for a world so entranced in keeping their world secret, why would she be shouting about muggles and Platform 9 ¾ out loud in the muggle world. Why was she even in the muggle world? They were a pureblood family they could’ve been apparating or flooing to the Platform instead.
And last year, if he had just known about the prophecy, he could have realized that something was going on with his dreams and not have fallen for the trap so easily. Sirius may be alive if he had known.
Afterwards, he sat down in front of his desk and made a list of everything that had happened to him since he had joined the Wizarding World. In first year there was the stone. Who puts a valuable stone, which is highly sought after, in a school full of children? And the tasks! Who puts a Cerberus in a school? It was a miracle that it didn’t leave the room or eat any students.
“Smart girl.” I say softly trying not to breathe because all it did was increase my pain. I slowly slid my hand to the puddle of blood I knew was forming underneath me. I dip my quill into it and slowly write
“Harry, wait a second. You don’t have to do this.” Dumbledore said trying to appeal to him. “I took good care of your accounts and it is a big responsibility for one so young. Let me control your accounts until you are ready.” As he said this Harry could feel the compulsion charm try to latch on. He had never been so thankful for the bracelet Tom had given him except for that moment.
“I’m fine Draco. Thanks for calming me down, I just forgot that I was blind for a minute.” He told Draco. He and Draco had come to a ceasefire yesterday and they had decided to try again as friends. He hadn’t really hated Draco at all. He just hadn’t liked how spoiled and bratty Draco had been. He had reminded him too much of his cousin for him to want to be his friend.
“Excuse me my dear boy-” Tom gritted his teeth and refrained from putting his hand near his wand. “But did you just say you were summoned by Harry Potter?” Man did he hate that man.
“While you do that, we should probably respond to Dumbledore and Mom and tell them that we are coming.” Bill added on, agreeing with his brother.
“And I too vow to show you the love and affection YOU deserve as well.” Draco said still on Aidan’s lap with his face as close as possible to Aidan’s without kissing.
RS: (Readers. I have to say I was shocked. Harry Potter, our saviour, a Slytherin?) You were supposed to go to Slytherin? The house full of dark and evil wizards?
“I’m guessing that since no one freaked out, that was supposed to happen?” Harry questioned looking at the spots were magic was traveling throughout two different bodies.
“Hedwig.” He croaked struggling to move his arm and pet where he heard her last. As he moves his arm away from her head, he can barely see that there was a large dirty red stain left on her head, probably from him but he couldn’t tell if it came from the small pool underneath him or from a wound that was continuing to bleed. His sight was getting more and more blurry as he kept them open, so he closed them.
After the goblin stopped talking, Harry slipped on the glowing thing he assumed was a ring onto his left middle finger. The magic flashed around him before settling. This happened again with the other five rings before they all flashed and melded together to make one ring.
“Your new husband is...” the tension in the room was so thick that you could cut it with a knife. Draco and Aidan were both holding their breath in anticipation for what Narcissa was going to say next.
All of the memories were of before he started Hogwarts. Apparently he had learned to control his magic at a young magic. He had used it to terrorize his relatives when they had started to bully him. And that wasn’t the worst thing, Harry saw a memory of Dumbledore blocking his magic when he was eight! He also remembered being forced to drink a potion and after that he became very submissive. How dare Dumbledore block his memories from him?
“What’s wrong?” Aidan asked walking into the dining room and feeling the heavy atmosphere that the adults had.
As he did so, he saw a flash of light and he felt the magic around the ring change to accept him. It did the same with the Riddle heir ring as well.
To Andromeda Tonks, as the sole heir of the Noble and Ancient House of Black, I bring you back on the family tree. You have always followed the Black family motto, Toujours Pur, Always Pure. The proper motto was always pure of heart not blood like my mother tried to make everyone believe and follow. A feminine voice Harry had never heard before started to cry tears of joy.
“Come on Neville. We must leave Draco and Aidan alone.” Luna said leading Neville away before anyone could speak.
“You must read it! Harry is in it!” she said throwing the paper down on the desk and ignoring his question and the clamour when everyone found out that The Boy- Who-Lived was in the newspaper.
He strode towards the door and tried to open it. The door wouldn’t budge. He took out his wand and started saying spell after spell, trying to open the door.
“Today, you have made me one of the happiest people in the world. I vow to always show you the love and affection you deserve.”
He got to the floo as fast as possible without running like a maniac and simultaneously yelled out Gringotts and put on a complex glamour as he stepped into the floo. The complex glamour was so that in some odd chance, Dumbledore saw him, he wouldn’t be recognized.
“Yes. Rings of the same kind will always attract each other so that your hand isn’t laden down with rings.
“I would never.” Tom spoke up for the first time since they had been there. “If I did, not only would I be killing new recruits, I would also have my son – that I’m just now getting to know – hate me.”
“NOTHING MAJOR?!!! Ha-Aidan he turned you into a skilled assassin and spy. I mean, I know we’re good, but even Dumbledore doesn’t sense you unless you let him. Did you know about those attacks on a few anti-werewolf members of the Wizengamont that happened last year?”
“Remus.” Harry said with no emotion in his voice. “It’s finally nice to hear you. We haven’t spoken since Siri died.” The monotone voice made Remus flinch even though Harry couldn’t see him.
“Bill?” Charlie yelled coming through the floo. The redhead hoped that he could reach his brother before the letter did.
“WHAT will I likely say yes to? Send an owl TO WHOM?” Harry said extremely irritated now. I’m RIGHT HERE YOU KNOW!!!”
Draco looked extremely close to passing out and had unconsciously gripped Aidan’s hand to brace himself as well as putting most of his body weight on him. The only thought going through his head was; This can’t be happening. I can’t marry somebody I don’t know. I love Harry. I can’t marry anyone but Harry. His eyes widened at that realization. He really did love Harry.
“My father, Severus, both of whom helped to bring you here, my mother, who healed you, the Dark Lord, and I.” Malfoy said, still next to the bed.
Charlie was washing up after a vigorous day at work when he got two owls, one from Fred and George and one from his mother. Out of habit, he scanned them both for anything wrong, not expecting anything wrong. Surprisingly, only one of the two letters came up as clean. The letter from Fred and George was that one. Molly’s letter had a Compulsion Charm, and a Loyalty Charm on it. The Compulsion Charm was keyed to Molly while the Loyalty charm was keyed into Dumbledore. Outraged, he dispelled all the charms and also did another general dispel just in case he missed something before he opened it.
“When you were taken from me, they also took off the necklace that was given to you as a baby. I had had it put into the vault on a pedestal simply because I couldn’t have it near me to remind me of what I had lost.
“Tom’s all bark and no bite.” Harry says in a stage whisper, trying to relieve Draco’s tension. “Nagini says he’s grumpy without his tea which he should’ve been having right about now.”
When they went upstairs all the rooms were empty and one had locks running up and down the door. They looked at each other confused, what could be so dangerous that it had to stay locked up with so many locks? This time Snape unlocked the door. The sight they saw was one of the worst things they ever saw, worse than some of the raids they’d had to go on when the Dark Lord had been completely insane.
“Let me see, hand-me down clothing, red hair, and a loud mouth. You must be a Weasley.” Tom sneered unknowingly almost repeating exactly what Draco had said back in first year. Weasley flushed red.
“Okay girl. Take this to someone who isn’t associated with Him. He’ll only save me enough not to die and then keep me here to get hurt more.” He says with the last of his energy. As Hedwig chirps an okay and flies through the cracked window, he succumbs to the darkness that was encroaching.
“So, now that we’ve made sure that this year will be the worst thing to ever happen to Dumblefuck, Ronald, Ginevra, and the Mudblood; why don’t we finally go get you your familiar?” Draco said smiling while dragging Aidan towards Knockturn Ally.
“What are you still doing with this death eater Harry? He’s brainwashed you into thinking you’re a faggot. Come back to me so that our son isn’t a bastard. You told me you loved me when we conceived my baby, why are you going back on it now?” Ginny said, making the growing group of wizards murmur to themselves.
“That is extremely Slytherin-like Potter.” Lucius said impressed, “The only issue here is that there is no sure fire way to make sure that you get into Slytherin. The hat decides.”
(The easy-going and light atmosphere shocked me readers, considering the legendary fights they got into at Hogwarts.)
“Of course!!” Draco yelled throwing himself at Aidan. Aidan, not expecting it, fell on his butt, but thankfully he managed to catch Draco and make sure the box that held the ring didn’t fallout of his hand.
“I’m right here Harry,” Tom said moving towards his son after getting the okay from the goblin. As he reached down to help Harry up, Harry raised his hand and placed it into Tom’s.
“Harry the article said you were blind. Is this true?” the twin on the left side of the couch asked.
“Well I would but the whole blind thing is kind of working against me on this one,” Aidan stated dryly as he finally found the latch and opened the door for the animal that was to become his familiar. He gasped as the wolf-like creature nipped his hand hard enough to draw blood before lapping it up and barking.
Tom was both impressed and worried. Impressed because of how Aidan was magically strong enough to manifest his magic and also at Aidan’s creative torture points. Worried because of how this article was going to affect his and Draco’s new relationship.
“Now, I can tell by both their vocal patterns and by their magic. When Fred speaks, he’s totally thought about everything he is going to say. When George speaks, it’s more spontaneous and he speaks with more of his emotions than Fred, not to be rude to Fred or anything.
“Oh! I-I-I-I was just about to come in there and get you.” Draco stuttered, his voice conveying the shyness he probably felt at that moment. “You were taking a while and we need to go down for breakfast soon and we also need to about all that is involved with the engagement and-”
“Ginevra.” Aidan curtly said with barely a nod in her general direction. The whole mob quiets down to see what would happen between them.
“Narcissa! What’s wrong?” Lucius said worriedly hurrying to get out of his seat so that he could comfort her.
“I can’t believe you think that we did this!” They exclaim at the same time. “Sure we play pranks like this, but it wasn’t us this time.”
“Thanks. Now all I need is a name. Do you have a name young one?” Harry asked, deciding to try and see if it already had a name.
“What?” Harry chocked out shocked, “No. That can’t be possible. He’s never done anything that damaging to me ever.” Lost in his thoughts about what it meant that he could no longer see the world around him. Slowly his magic started to swirl around him becoming more and more chaotic, matching the anger he was feeling inside.
“But if you can find it in your heart to love me then I shall cherish your love forever and strive to do the best by you for the rest of our lives.”
“Who is this person?” Aidan said with no emotion in his voice. Inside he was so angry that his magic was close to bursting out of him. Once he got a name, he was going to hunt them down and destroy them for thinking that they could touch what belonged to him. Being blind, he missed the appraising look Tom gave him at his ability to hide and mask his emotions.
Draco was outside relaxing in the gardens when he heard a hoot. Looking up, he saw a snowy white owl with a red mark on her head. As it came closer, he could clearly see that the mark on its head was actually blood and it looked fairly fresh. Worried that it was injured, he raised his hand to catch the incoming owl. Looking closely at the owl, he realized that it was Potter’s cherished owl, Hedwin, or something similar. After inspecting her for a moment to make sure the blood wasn’t hers, Draco realized that she had a letter in her hand. Curious to learn why his self-proclaimed enemy had decided to write to him and to learn why the owl was covered in blood, he opened it.
“If you would lead the way.” Harry said gesturing to where he remembered the door to be. As he moved towards the door, he was stopped by a disturbance behind him.
To Fred and George Weasley, I leave a copy of all the pranks that the Marauders have ever done as well as a few we never got around to. I also leave you 3,000 galleons for you to do as you see fit. Thank you for being such loyal friends to Harry. I ask that you continue to be great friends for he will need them in the future.
Hope you enjoyed the latest chapter!! Sorry it's short, I just thought you would enjoy a quick update.
“See, nothing is wrong. Potter is probably up in his room pouting because he couldn’t be with his friends this summer.” Snape sneered.
Dumbledore was irritated. It had been over two hours and Harry, Mr. Malfoy, and the mysterious man were still in the bank. What could Sirius have left that was so important that it would take more than two hours? There was no way that Sirius could’ve known about the spells and potions that littered his system. There was also no way for him to be able to break the mind charm that made him believe that Harry was actually Lily and James’.
“Duly noted. Do you and your brother have any skills besides pranking?” Tom questioned looking thoughtful.
“First, I’m going to destroy his reputation, then I’m going to take all his money, and when he’s as low as possible in society’s eyes I’ll torture him some more. I’ll make him beg for death but I won’t grant it to him. Only after he’s given up all hope and thinks he’ll never die will I grant him the reprieve that is death.” By the end of the rant, Aidan’s magic was swirling around him, making his eyes glow and his hair move as if there was a heavy wind blowing throughout the room.
Trust Spell – Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, Albus Dumbledore, Molly Weasley, Arthur Weasley
“Of course I can! I’m your mother!” Molly says a little uncertainly. “You’re Fred!” she says pointing to the twin on the left.
HP: Well, first I will be getting a familiar so that I am protected without Draco always hovering around me. Next, I’m going to ask for a resort. In first year I was supposed to be in Slytherin, but I talked the hat out of it. Hopefully I’ll get it again so that Draco and I won’t be as easily separated.
“Sure. As you know, my godfather died last year. Sometimes I’d have nightmares about it and I would wake up screaming. This time when I screamed, I woke up my uncle and he taught me a lesson about how ‘freaks’ shouldn’t wake up ‘normal’ people. I got tired of playing ‘nice Harry’, so I snapped back. He didn’t like that.” He said with little emotion.
To Dumbledore, I only leave to you the knowledge that I have a letter for Harry to read in my vault that explains all the manipulations that you have subjected him to as well as all the money taken out of his vaults as well as the knowledge that when the new Lord Black is given the Lord ring, Grimmauld Place is forever barred from the Order of the Phoenix. Even if you somehow coerce the new Lord Black to let you use it only those that follow him fully and do not manipulate him, are allowed in there thanks to a handy ward that I got from the Blacks. I also tell you, you can kiss my cold dead ass.
“Now, is there anything else that I can do for you?” the goblin asked after he handed Tom Harry’s letter from Sirius as the three humans got ready to leave.
I found out, readers, that Harry Potter and Ginevra have never had a sexual relationship before. That’s right! Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has never been in a relationship before and is a virgin. Now I bet you are wondering about the rumours of a marriage contract bonding Ginevra noname and our Harry Potter. Harry Potter tells me that even if there is a marriage contract, it is invalid and/or illegal due to the marriage contract that his godfather, the escaped criminal Sirius Black, set up for him.
“I think that Potter must be very desperate to be contacting his rival, especially after writing this in his own blood. We all know how precious blood is. Lucius, take young Malfoy here along with Severus and go check it out. Also, don’t tell Severus where you’re going until you get there, but make sure he brings his healing kit. Be careful and don’t get caught by that insufferable Order.” Voldemort ordered, waiving his hand and dismissed them.
“I think that Potter must be very desperate to contact his rival. Lucius, take young Malfoy here and Snape and go check it out. Don’t tell Snape where you’re going until you get there but make sure that he brings healing potions. Be careful not to get caught by the insufferable order.” Voldemort ordered.
Hello Everyone! I know I'm going to make everyone upset since it's been years since I updated and now the first thing I add is an author's note. I wanted to tell everyone that I had lost motivation to write, but I'm going back through my stories and re-writing the ones I can save. I won't post them until I have a few chapters ready. I'm starting with Enough is Enough and once that one is fairly ok, I'll probably continue with The Trouble With Imps. Thank you to all of your well wishes though and hopefully the stories will come back better than ever!
She seemed to be weighing the pros and cons to agreeing to this, “If I agree to this, exactly what light did you want me to put on this?”
“What was so important that you had to owl me to come here instead of telling me about it later?” Tom asked a little winded from how fast he tried to get away from Dumbledore. “Did no one think it would be prudent for me to know that there was a huge chance that Dumbledore would still be here?” he said with a glare that completely bypassed Harry.
“Thanks Tom. From what Draco read to me, it sounds like she really went to town with it.” He says with a smirk remembering the blush he could hear in Draco’s voice when Draco had gotten to the part that insinuated they were in love. “Draco told me that we were going to be leaving in about ten minutes. Lucius scouted Gringotts earlier and there is a line of well-wishers there to ‘give their support’ to me.”
Harry woke up to the feeling of someone running their hand through his hair. He groaned and the hand stop. The first thing he realized was he wasn’t at his relative’s house. The second thing he realized was that he wasn’t in any pain and couldn’t see anything. He lifted a hand and felt bandages going around his eyes.
“Thank you.” The twins said sincerely, “No one else has ever been able to figure that out before. You are our true sibling.”
Checking through the rooms, they found all of them to be empty, except for the last room which they saw had locks running up and down the door with a cat flap at the bottom of it. They all looked at each other confused, what could be so dangerous that it had to be locked up from the outside? This time it was Snape that unlocked the door. The sight they saw right inside the door was one of the worst things the hardened Death Eaters had ever seen, worse than some of the raids they had been forced to go on when the Dark Lord was at his most insane.
“WHAT?!!!! How dare that old goat!!!!” He exclaimed. “I can’t believe he put that in the paper! Like that bitch would ever be something like that with Aidan!! When I get my hands on her, she will wish she was! Maybe then he would stop me from killing her!”
Draco was glad that the snakelike body that he had heard the Dark Lord had gotten in the ritual after the Triwizard tournament had just been temporary and he had regained his human looks. Now he looked like what Tom Riddle should have looked like if he was in his mid-thirties and used the snakelike glamour on his Lower Circle followers. The Malfoys, of course were part of his Inner Circle, which was a good thing because Malfoys were both powerful and do not bow to half-snake looking creatures.
“I think we should go back to Britain and talk to Fred and George. They obviously have information that we need to hear. I’ll send them an owl to tell them that we’re coming. You can stay overnight so that we can leave in the morning.” Charlie decided after a minute of thought.
The day after the article, there was a public outcry. Dumbledore and the Ministry got Howler after Howler all morning asking how a poor innocent boy like Harry could have all that bad fortune heaped on him and how dare the Ministry torture students and put an innocent man in Azkaban.
“Send some Death Eaters to his house and wait for his relatives to get back. Then capture them and put them into the dungeon.” He said looking at his two followers.
Narcissa squealed, “Yay!! A wedding! We can have a December wedding and we can invite all the prominent members of the Dark community and we can do it in the garden here at the Manor and-”
I stared at her, unbelievingly as soon as she said those words."What do you mean by 'you're on the right track'? And why are you here?"
Okay, I got it. I am in love with Draco Freaking Malfoy. My ex-enemy, an arrogant prick, a pureblood, and finally, a male. Hey! There's nothing wrong with being gay but in my entire life, up to this point, I thought I was straight not until Draco.
"Tiffany is my bonded house-elf. She has much right to sit and eat beside me." Malfoy replied with a hint of coldness in his voice. "And this is my cabin, my father's rules do not apply here. My rules only matter in this property."
I run as fast as I can to the lavatory, reaching the sink. I vomited violently, emptying my already empty stomach.
Hermione is my best friend and my sister - the one who understands me the most and nothing could change that.
"Ginny!" Michael gasped as he looks so surprised to see her there. I feel a suddenly prickly sensation in my chest. The way his face changed and his voice waiver as soon as Ginny appeared. It made me irritated and then I realized at that moment what his problem towards me was all about.
"Hermione..." I whispered as I slowly sat up straight and helped Draco to fix ourselves in a more presentable manner. "I need to give Ginny some sort of closure, it's the least that I could do for her."
Headmaster Dumbledore coughed behind us, stealing our attention. Blushing, the three of us, turned to him.
My thoughts and my disobedient heart that had gone wild that got me so distracted and I didn't notice the other person's action. Suddenly, Draco tackles me and firmly hugged me. Caught off guard, I was first shocked, and then slowly, my face turned red.
“Swear to never tell anyone a thing we are told today without explicit permission from those in the room with us.”
Also waiting in the hallway for a response were the Dark Lord, Lucius, and Severus. They too looked up when Narcissa left the infirmary.
Harry nodded as he slowly reached to where his plate is supposed to be and found it was already filled with food. Confused, he turned to his right.
Then in third year, Sirius should’ve been able to get a trial. Dumbledore was the head of the Wizengamont, he should’ve been able to ask for a trial.
Understanding dawned on Aidan’s face and he made his excuses before he quickly made his way to his father’s side.
A shiver went down everyone’s back and they were all glad that they weren’t the ones that had procured their wrath.
“Tom is here? I need to talk to you whenever you get a chance.” Harry said to the room since he didn’t know where Tom was.
When Draco made a slight hurt sound for being called a faggot, Aidan spoke up for the first time since Ginny called out to them, “Listen here you skank. You will not, I repeat NOT call my boyfriend a faggot. I don’t know who you slept with and frankly I don’t think you do either if the rumours in the school are anything to go by, but I am not the father to your child. If you are even pregnant. I have never, and will never have sex with you.”  Aidan got close up and whispered in her ear, “If you ever bully and/or mess with my boyfriend again, I will call in the life debt you owe me and I assure you, what I would make you do, you would not be happy about.”
It hurt. Every part of him screamed and he could barely move. Something softly bumped against his hand and as he struggled to open his eyes, he heard cooing.
Sighing, he sent the Order home and decided to wait for Harry to get out so that he could talk to him.
“It was awful.” She said, starting to tear up. “He had cuts covering his entire body. Most of the bones in his body had been broken at least twice. There was evidence that his bones had never been set properly in his life. Two of his ribs had punctured his lungs. The worst part though is that his eyes had been damaged, and I can’t fix it. He’ll be blind for the rest of his life.” She finished upset because she couldn’t fix all of the damage. Lucius wrapped himself around her, trying to give a bit of comfort to his shaking wife.
The dark family he had stolen him from didn’t deserve the child. The dark deserved no powerful children. In his mind, he had done the child a favour. As a child of the dark, Dumbledore could have killed him and probably would have killed him if he hadn’t felt that power. The way the child glared at him at such a young age and the power that raised itself around the child made Dumbledore stop his casting of the Avada Kedavra and decided to take the child instead. Of course, he couldn’t have the mother going off and complaining or crying, so he had killed her as well as any other living thing in the house as well.
“Well, Heir Potter, may I call you Harry?” after getting a nod from him, Narcissa continued, “There is some bad news. After healing all of you, I found out that your eyes have been too damaged for me to fix. You are permanently blind and will not be able to see again. Magic can fix much but it can’t fix everything.” Narcissa said sadly, still upset that she couldn’t get him up to one hundred percent.
“How is he?” Draco asks his mom when she finally walks out of the infirmary after three hours of working on Potter.
“Harry, I know what you mean about this happening very quickly. I have also loved and admired you for a long time now. I would gladly spend my days with you for the rest of our lives.”
“Of course.” Aidan said smiling, glad that Draco was smiling after what happened this morning. “After all, school starts back in two weeks and sadly we are in different houses.”
“Why the one and only Albus Dumbledore, of course?” Harry said with a sneer, “The only people who ever tried to do something about it were the twins and they’ve been blocked at every turn by Dumbdoor. The twins are just like me so it’s harder for them to get away with things with their mother watching over their every move.
“As great as that sounds, I’m going to have to answer with a no and add that the next time Dumbledore tries something like another Compulsion Charm, I might just kill him myself.” Bill answered just as sarcastically.
“So now I’m asking if you would put it back on for me. I’d like to see you wear the necklace that you were supposed to grow up with.” Tom finished, his voice sounding shaky and hesitant.
“Hello there,” Draco added as he mimicked Aidan by kneeling down and letting the snow leopard cub sniff and then nip his hand. It was a silver white colour with black spots and the brightest glowing blue eyes ever seen.
“I know, I know, but I just got the best marriage contract ever!!!” she says waving the paper in her hand around. “He won’t be able to refuse this one, you wouldn’t even say know to this.”
“This is the Entrance Hall. As you can feel, it only took a few turns to get here from the Infirmary.” He said stopping and putting a hand in front of Harry to keep Harry from running into him.
Without saying anything, all pointed towards the back office. No one wanted to have the combined ire of the BWL and the Ancient House of Malfoy on them.
“Wait a second. Not to be rude or disrespect the Malfoy family, but I don’t remember ever writing a contract for my son to marry your son. How is it that you got a marriage contract for Aidan to marry Draco?”
“It’s not important at the moment. When it becomes relevant I will gladly tell you. Until then, just trust me.” The raven headed boy says with a smile and a light touch to the blonde’s face. They then continue on their way and enter the Daily Prophet to go talk to a certain reporter.
After all, it was one thing for someone to tell you that a person was totally different and another to see it for himself.
“Where is Rita Skeeter?!” was heard throughout the Daily Prophet office. When the workers turned to see who was causing the ruckus, all protests ended when seeing that the instigators were the Boy-Who-Lived and Draco Malfoy.
Draco looked up as his mom walked out of the infirmary after three hours of working on Potter. “How is he?” he asked before she could say anything. Draco had been kicked out the minute he had brought her Potter and he was anxious to know what had happened and how he was. The image of finding Potter in a pool of his own blood would stay with him for a long time.
“She actually should have been asking your permission to make any changes to the Longbottom vaults when you turned eleven. Since by your expression I’m guessing she didn’t we shall audit all of the Longbottom vaults to makes sure funds were going to where they were supposed to. We wish for you to go through an inheritance ritual to make sure that nothing else is glaringly wrong.”
After checking for any wards that might go off, Lucius unlocked the door and they entered with their wands up, ready for anything that might come out at them. After taking a glance around, nothing looked out of the ordinary, it looked like a simple muggle home.
"Thanks, Draco. Finally, there is somebody who can retort against Hermione." I turned expecting Draco but what I did not expect is what he would look like but soon I did see him. My whole body froze as well as my mind. My eyes never stray again.

Laughing, Hermione with her good nature, patted me at my shoulder – reassuring me that I look just fine and making me relax. I glanced at Malfoy with great anticipation.
He coming with a full swing from his right, ready to ram his fist into my face. I clearly saw the move and waited for it to come but before he could land it on me, a spell hit him. Michael ended on the floor with ropes tightly wrapped around him, he was bound and gagged.  I look up to see, who did, expecting it to be a Hermione or one of the twins but instead it turned out to be Malfoy.
Realizing, that I am again in the same nightmare. I look down at the ground. I am standing on an ocean of dark red blood as it flows and raises to my ankles. Chills run thru my body as the sensation of liquid trickle down on my body and as I felt the stare directed at me. I turned and then there she was again. Her pale face, submerged with madness, as she smiled at me, wide and with teeth. Her eyes were unfocused and hungry.
My hands started to drift towards the edge of Draco's shirt as I seek out to touch his warm skin. My fingers reached within his clothes groping his stomach, his whole body jerked and he abruptly pulled away from our kiss as he pants. "H-harry" He gasped. The way he called my name to send a strong emotion in me that made me anticipate more, I was instantly becoming hard in my trousers. I was ready to completely eat this creature within my arms as I push him on the lounge and climb on the top of him when...
"Hmm..." He answered nonchalantly. "I never have expected that hearing words of gratitude from you, Potter, would make me feel good. That's a first."
"Yeah, me too." I sighed as the mixed emotion inside of me unravel. Ron is my best friend and my brother. We are brothers not by blood but by the bond. His family had become my second family. We have been together through all the struggles and dangers, that is why I couldn't possibly know what should I do or how should I feel about Ron. When it was easy for him to push me away. Should I understand him because I might really endanger his family and even Hermione or should I see this as a way of his little faith and trust in me as one of his best friends? I guess I'll find out sooner or later because I am certain that Hermione and I can't stay hidden forever. And when the time comes that I really need to present myself to my loved ones once again, I will have to face them on how will they react. Will it be acceptance or rejection? I realize that I fear that confrontation more than death itself.
Divination is second to my least favorite subject aside from Potion as Professor Trelawney kept on predicting my death, which is very annoying.
"Har...ry, let me b-breathe..." He whispered in a breathy and raspy tone as his lips were so red and pulp from kissing.
"Draco!!!," A loud cry came from Hermione then there was a loud smack, and Draco doubled over, blood streaming down his arm as I saw a part of his broken bone protruded, breaking his arm's flesh. He shielded Hermione from a blow that the monster sneaks in when both Draco and Hermione were facing off the other three hobgoblins.
I really think that I should find psychiatry for my mental health because right now even with the dire situation and all this weirdness, I found myself liking Malfoy's laughter.
I immediately open my eyes at the sound of my stomach rumbling. Malfoy was looking at me with a weird expression on his face, a crossover of 'wanting to laugh' and 'staring at a fool' look. I know that my whole face must be so red from blushing. This is so embarrassing!
"Hmmm.." Malfoy took a moment to think. "It could be their use. You know, to beautify me." He said sarcastically. "But that would be too much, right?"
For the first time, Hermione wasn't really sure of any of these. Especially, it wasn't connected to any person we’ve known so far, not even Voldermort. I wasn't any of the help because I don't know the name of the girl in my dreams. Or what the blood consuming is all about?
"Yes. Yes, Of course.' Sirius said. "I have to thank you for those wonderful pastries. you have always sent out for us, Remus and I. Without those I would have died in St. Mungo for the lack of taste of their foods."
Speaking about serious stuff, I remember that I need to ask about those ruins. After all, it had been the start of my nightmares, and it's where my demon came from.
"Don't you dare talk to me, Werewolf." Mr. Malfoy sneered at the offered peace. Sirius went crazy in Remus' arms. The twins, Ron and I were on the edge now as we glared at the Malfoys. Hermione and Ginny were watching on the sides.
"Then it means you don't lust over me?" He asked innocently as he flutters his eyelashes but his words made me choke on my saliva as I felt a cluster of emotional cocktail had just shot in all through-out my veins which were lust, exasperation, excitement, and annoyance. 'He is testing my control.'
Hermione raised one of his eyebrows and I can see her lips quivering, trying hard not to laugh at me as she can't because we are right now in class. To be exact, Herbology class. She and I were partnered at the start of class, leaving Ron with Neville, who was quite good at Herbology. So, Ron won't be bothering us for help since he has a reliable partner.
My voice barely carried over the sound of our hunters, the Acromantulas' pincers clicking in excitement as a mob of them crash in front of the thin barrier that we made. The barrier made a breaking sound as it was about to disappear from the sheer pressure that it was receiving from the Acromantulas. But it didn't stop Hermione from jumping from her place as she took out her wand in a defense position.
"Well. Well, it's the Weasleys, blood traitors. No wonder it has become unbearable here at Diagon Alley"
"I have some ideas of what creatures, Potter may have become in my list but I still do need some information to confirm my theories. I was hoping, that you would provide me  those as the only best friend and confidant of Potter."
"What do you mean that Sirius has been missing for three months already?" I shouted as I stood up abruptly that my chair slumped to the floor from the force of me standing up.
Hermione steps up from the crowd. She turns her critical eyes on the notebook in the possession of Malfoy. "What's in that notebook, Malfoy."
"Okay. If you say so, my love." I said as I put one arm around her shoulder and putting a light kiss on her cheek, making her blush again.
It was almost noon when all of us decided to have a late lunch. Coming out from Quality Quidditch Supplies shop, huddled up to The Leaky Caudron. When an unwelcome voice sounded out.
My whole world started to twist in a strange and dark dimension. 'Dead, who? Me? It can't be! I can still hear them. I am still alive.'
"Mrs. Weasley, more beautiful than I last saw you" Sirius cheekily vocalized as he moved towards her and kiss the back of her hand.
"With what?" She asked back as she looks down at the Flitter bloom that we were relocating to another pot and adding fertilizer.
The flickering embers of the fire; the creaks of the snapping of the wood were the only sound that can be heard through-out the room. The harmonious aura as turn to a strained one as I felt bitter and sweet from the news of the drastic change of the opinions of the important people in my life, towards me. Hermione seems to notice my despair and flinch in guilt as she realizes how insensitive the words that she had revealed to me as she nervously twists her hands.
Draco's confident form as he crouched near the ground, almost concealing himself to the grass and blended with the bushes. His muscles flex under that well-fitted black pants as he was about to pounce like a graceful predator, his dilated eyes were focused on the prey, which was a great moose. It was at the edge of the grass-field meadow near the edge of the dark forest as it seems to be protecting its herd that was currently grazing.
"Potter. We're waiting here for your answer and close that mouth of yours - that is so not attractive." Malfoy said in a bored tone.
Fear clogged my throat. I have gone too far. This dangerous! I should stop it now. Malfoy is much like Hermione. Intelligent enough to puzzle out my current condition. The relief that I had just felt, disappears immediately. Instead panic replaces it in my chest.
"Immature brat." He coughed out as he steps a little closer to me. My hand went straight to my wand hidden under my pants' pocket, ready to pull it out to cast a spell against him.
Hermione wasn't all happy for the Captain's decision as she was still complaining about my sake. "Harry is still in pain from those injuries. How can you say?" Which was totally ignored by Wood. Making Hermione angrier. Poor Ron had to receive the angry shouts and the jabs from the elbow just to calm down Hermione.
I screamed in anger and frustration as I run-up to the full-length mirror across my room, beside the drawer. The reflection showed a pale and beautiful monster with red eyes as she laughs at my misfortune. I strike at it, without care at that laughing face as I screamed at her to shut up. I curse at her and punched without stopping until my knuckles turn red and marred by the glass that tears my flesh until blood drip onto the floor. I continued until her image disappear from my sight. The mirror was busted and broken as the fragments scattered unto the floor with my blood painted all over them.
1. Inferi/ zombie (heart stop then restarted but not a corpse, still breathing, not soulless by Hermione) (REALLY, MOINE!!! I still look handsome by Harry)
"I thought I stop caring, Hermione." I croaked as I enclose my face with both my hands, unable to stop the painful assault of the unexpected emotions that just burst into my chest, like a shotgun - fast and deadly. "In all of those years, how can they leave me because of a single moment? Was our relationship, Ginny and I, was up to this point? Replaceable? Meant to be abandoned? Was my friendship with Ron has an expiration date to suddenly disappear just like that? Does he not trust me or was I not trustworthy?"
Screaming as the girl stumbled away from my claws. She keeping yelling a name that I have no concern about. A hot flashed went through my body as it seeks relief from the hot flames scourging my body. My head swirl in pain and heaviness, my skin prickly.
“How in the world am I going to carry around so many keys?” Harry said shocked at the amount of keys that showed up at the table.
As he stepped out, he breathed a sigh of relief that he had his glamour on. Of course it was his luck that as he stepped out of the Gringotts floo, Dumbledore and the Order of the Fire Chicken loitered around the atrium.
“Will you be joining the fight and getting revenge on those that have obviously ‘corrupted poor sweet Harry’ like Sirius?” Charlie asked sarcastically.
“Let’s check upstairs for Potter before the Order comes.” Draco suggested already heading towards the stairs.
That is my will and testament. To all of the ones who got something or some helpful advice live, long and profit, or whatever that dude on the telly says. To the ones that didn’t get anything as nice or friendly, kiss my cold, dead, pale ass. That is all.
“Use your portkey and take him to your mother. I’ll follow after I get all of his stuff.” Snape said looking around at the bare room. There was barely a bed in the room, and he couldn’t even see where his trunk was.
Draco turned around to see Luna and Neville rushing towards to them. Aidan recognizing the voices, sighed and stopped, Draco’s look of concern going unseen by the mostly blind black-haired boy.
All day there were reporters, wizards, witches, and photographers waiting around Gringotts so that when Harry showed up, they could offer him their support.
“Hedwig.” I say feeling her soft head. She moves my hand to something that feels like parchment and a quill.
“Now can someone please explain to me why there are bandages on my eyes when, one, there are no bandages anywhere else on my body, and two, I’m not feeling any pain from my eyes.” Harry said getting frustrated with the bandages covering his head and also not liking the fact that he couldn’t see the ones he was talking to.
(Readers, after that, I saw Draco Malfoy in a new light. He wasn’t just the spoiled prince we all though he was. He had a heart and he used it to help out our saviour.)
“That is a miniature form of the dragon that I faced in our fourth year, the Hungarian Horntail. As you can see, the dragon flame is surrounding two gems. The gems symbolize our eyes and the flame symbolizes the fact that my love for you shall always burn brighter and hotter than a dragon’s flame. I shall also always protect you more fiercely than even a mother dragon protecting her nestlings and this ring shows that. Please say yes.”
“Life’s good! How’s our silent backer? Fell in love yet?” They ask looking at his hand, where he hadn’t let go of Draco’s hand yet.
“Portkey home and get him to Narcissa. I’ll follow with his stuff.” Snape said as he handed Potter to Draco.
“Wouldn’t it cause the most drama considering the fact that I am rumored to be living in the Malfoy house?” Tom asked confused.
'Yes I am. Lucius Malfoy’s son, Draco, and I are going to Gringotts and since I am blind, I need to make sure Dumblefuck and his Chicken Club don’t try to do something to me.'  Tom choked a little in shock at the nickname Harry had given Dumbledore and the Order.
“Uncle Sev hurry!” Draco says looking at the bloodied form on the ground. The puddle of blood was huge and it had already soaked Potter’s clothes.
“Anyway –” They hurriedly say before Harry can say anything about their teasing. “You mentioned something about this man being your father?”
“FRED, GEORGE, DO NOT TALK THAT WAY TOWARDS PROFESSOR DUMBLEDORE!” Molly exclaims scolding her sons, “You will undo this prank right now or so help me-”
He muttered a few words and waited until the spell hit her. When it hit her, she stopped crying and her eyes had a slight misty look to them. That’s when he started speaking,
“Harry. I’m so glad we were able to catch up with you. We just wanted to tell you that we were with you one hundred percent of the way. Dumbledore, the Nonames and Granger went too far.” Neville said when they finally got close enough.
Upon reaching the living room, Draco was sitting down on one of the couches as he seems to have a tea at hand while he was staring at the flicker of the flames at his fireplace along with the creaking of the wood that snaps under the fire.
I look over the Gryffindor's sit and saw Hermione there. She had that distressed expression but a determined spark in her eyes as she was trying to ensure me. Even though, she had hesitated to allow me to compete in the Quidditch match in which I still stubbornly push forward because I didn't want anyone noticing my situation especially if the seeker of Gryffindor just back out of the game at a last-minute before starting without any excuse. I relax a bit, knowing that she was there to support me, even after what she saw.
As I lay my head on my pillow, sleep overtook me. Then I dreamed differently for the first time after these weeks.
A few minutes had passed. My empathy for him made me uttered his name. "Malfoy." Looking at his pale face, as I straighten up and walk towards him.
The great door opens as the first years entered followed by Professor McGonagall as she leads them in. They marched toward the front where a four-legged stool was placed and on it is an extremely, old battered hat. Everyone stared and waited for the hat to do its doing. The sorting hat began to sing a song. Its hoarse voice filled the whole hall, with its perfect pitch. And as it ended the Great hall was filled with applause.
"In the meantime, I would like you to go to Pomfrey for a Dreamless potion. Tell her that you will be needing it from now on." He said.
As the stall opened and Hermione gazed upon my stomach, horror wrapped her face as she suppressed a scream.
A popping sound of apparition echoed through-out the hall as Tiffany appeared carrying what appears to be another letter and dutifully giving it to Draco, who accepted with thanks.
5. Werewolf (This could have been a better option by Harry) (transformation per full moon, eats raw blood and meat, enhance senses - so its a NO by Hermione)
Despite the exhaustion that I'm experiencing, I just couldn't stop myself from running in fear. Right behind me, Ron and Hermione were also fleeing in panic. Cold swept within the cave, chilling our body, and as if it entered our hearts as we tremble with dread. I didn't stop from our sprint even how many times we would fall to the ground only to get up again as fast as we can - didn't bother if we had broken bones or scars all over our body from the hard fall- the only thought we had in our mind was to run as fast as we can - away from the creature.
"So as I was saying, what did Ms. Vane had done to earn her a lawsuit against her." Headmaster Dumbledore repeated for the sake of re-opening the topic.
"If all of you would tell your respective professor of what had happened. Then both your Gryffindor's seeker and Ravenclaw's beater will be disqualified for all seasons, which something you all wouldn't like right?" Malfoy smirked as he explained to all of us. "A thing that would make my Slytherin team happy since you all will be losing a vital player for the next following games."
I plowed my tongue unapologetically into his warm mouth, exploring and dominating as I held both of his hands over his head, pinning them on the wall with one of my hands while my other hand, held his face more gently as I hold him in place.
"Yeah! Even Ginny and the other girls are conscious about it. They have giggled around you. Didn't you notice?" He asked, amused by my reaction.
Ginny's face came to my mind, clear as a television scene. I saw her frighten eyes that stared at me. Her pale skin as all the blood drains from her. Her cry as she scrambled backward trying to get away from me as far as she can. I remember her disgust. And I remember I smell her fear.
“Come on Neville. We must leave Draco and Aidan alone.” Luna said leading Neville away before anyone could speak.
“Maybe, but we still have to check it out anyways.” Lucius said creeping into the living room and looking at the pictures on the mantel. “Look at this. He’s not in a single picture that’s on this mantel.”
Draco’s yell snapped Snape from his frozen state, and he sprang into action. “Lucius, I need you to go home and tell Narcissa to prepare a room and make sure that she has all the potions in the manor available.” Snape rapidly said as he pulled out his wand and started casting diagnosis spell after spell.
It was thirty minutes later when the last major block was taken off with a large yell and a huge boom.
“Oh, I did tell people. Dumbledore knew, all of the Weasleys knew, Granger knew as well. The only people who tried to do something about it are the twins and they are just like me. Now can someone please explain to me why there are bandages on my eyes when; one there are no bandages on me anywhere else, and two there is no pain or cuts on my eyes as far as I can feel.” He says getting fed up of having the bandages around his head and not being able to see the people he was talking to.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, I’ve been fascinated by you since I first saw you in Madam Malkins’. Although I didn’t know it was love at the time, I knew even then there was something special about you. You, who hides behind a mask. You are the sweetest soul I’ve ever had the fortune of meeting. Even when I wrote to you and asked for help, you set aside what you thought was a huge rivalry and raced to help save me. And then you showed that you loved me, not necessarily in words, but in the way you act and the way that you help me function without my eyes.”
“Fine, I’ll wait. But who are we waiting for?” Harry says calming down, not able to deny Draco anything.
“Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather wrote a marriage contract between the two of them. Since he is legally the guardian of Harry Potter, the marriage contract is legit. Even now, after you have claimed him as Aidan Riddle, the contract still goes under effect.” Narcissa explained as she stepped away from Aidan and Draco who still had there stunned expression on their faces from the revelation.
“What was that about?” Draco said looking at Aidan with an expectant look that went straight over Aidan.
“To answer your second question first; let’s just say that before Sirius died, he taught me quite a few ‘special skills’. Well it was many things.” Harry said still looking slightly over Tom’s shoulder. “Number one is the fact that I found out that Dumbledore, Granger, and the Weasleys have all been stealing from me.”
To Molly Weasley, I tell you to leave Harry alone. He is not your child and you are not his guardian. You have no right telling him what he can and cannot do. You also had no right to scold me within my own home. I know not everything I did was approved by Dumbledore and I know I was childish as a kid, but that gave you no right to prevent me from doing to Harry what I saw fit as his guardian.
Hermione sat in a corner of the Headmaster’s office contemplating all that had happened. In her hands was a letter from her mother.
“Oh, Well…” Aidan glanced quickly at Draco who was also waiting for the answer, if not a little anxiously. “I think that I hate… Siri for doing this without my knowledge, but I love him for doing it at the same time. Draco,” He turned towards Draco and took hold of his hands. “I admit that this is happening very quickly, but I will admit now that I have admired you since first year and been in love with you since fourth. I don’t know if you love me as well because, frankly, I was terrible to you for a long time and don’t deserve your love.
After he had dissected his years at Hogwarts he realized that he had been played since the moment he had been told about the world. With that he got really angry, how dare they do that to him? And all for what? So that he could become their weapon?! Why would he want to be a weapon for a world so afraid of a man that they couldn’t even say their name without flinching, or they ran away from the scene of his followers like what happened at the Quidditch World Cup? They had also shamed him for every little thing. Like when he found out he was a parslemouth in second year and they called him dark, or in fourth year when they thought he cheated his way into the Triwizard Tournament even though he already had both fame and fortune, or even this past year when they called him attention seeking or a liar. Why would he want to save those ungrateful sheep?
“What do you mean, you were blinded?” That was Remus. Harry hadn’t heard from him since Sirius died.
“Draco help me support his head while I pour a Blood Replenishing Potion down his throat. It should help stabilize him until we can get him to Narcissa.” Snape said after quickly reading what the spells had told him about the injuries.
“Heir Longbottom, you have been eligible to claim the Longbottom Lordship since you were eleven. Because you father is permanently in capable of taking it, it would go to you. As your grandmother is not a blood Longbottom she cannot prevent you from becoming Lord Longbottom.
(I was as shocked as you were readers. The boy who lived had been threaten by a ministry employee with the Cruciatus Curse.)
“Yes, Uncle Sev.” Draco said as he shifted so he wasn’t in the puddle of blood but was still sitting close enough on the floor to support Potter’s head. After Snape had poured the potion down Potter’s throat, he rubbed his throat to make sure that Potter swallowed and didn’t choke on the potion.
“Okay, but you have to add the fact that I know she is an illegal animagus. She knows I know she is one.” Harry says finished with his food. "I guess that means relearning to cast will have to wait till later." he said as an afterthought.
After putting on the outfit that the house elf had set out for him, he opened his bedroom door and nearly ran into Draco.
He would never admit it but Tom was worried. A few minutes ago, he had gotten a missive from Draco at Gringotts requesting his presence. He knew that Dumbledore and his band of do-gooders would be there and he hoped nothing had happened to Harry. The little brat had grown on him.
“Great. I’ll call you Cor. It means heart as well, but in Latin.” Aidan said thinking about the name.
“I have the story of the century for you, but there are some things you have to agree to in order for me to allow you print this.”
“What do you want me to do Dad?” Aidan said, settling into a chair near what he assumed was the fireplace from the heat he was feeling on his right.
The same thoughts were going through Harry’s head. I won’t let Draco marry someone he doesn’t know. I want to marry him instead. I love him. The thought shocked him as well.
“Now why would he buy a bitch like you an engagement present? He’s not even dating you. He’s dating me.” Draco snarked back, angry that the little chit thought that she could barge into their new relationship. He had just gotten the man of his dreams without having to go against his family or morals, he wasn’t about to lose him to a lying, gold-digging little bitch.
“I don’t know.” Harry said just as shocked. “I could just feel your hand move closer to me and raised my hand to reach it. Except it wasn’t really your hand I felt, it was more like your magic.”
There were aw’s from all the witches near them as they witnessed the ‘young love’. As well as the click of a camera at the picture they presented.
Dumbledore was sitting in the Headmaster’s office, where the Order had been forced to move when Grimmauld Place wouldn’t let them in and Harry was nowhere to be found, drinking his tea when McGonagall burst through the door disrupting the meeting just about to start.
Aidan nodded to let his familiar know that he understood before turning to Draco and saying, “Come on Draco. We need to find your familiars and, I also apparently need to find another familiar since Cor can’t handle all of my power.”
“I’d love to! I always wondered what happened to that necklace.” Aidan said, happy that Tom was accepting him as his son fully. “Now about that gift for Draco…”
/I like it. Thank you for my new name. Now I can feel how powerful you are, and you need to have another familiar. I can’t help to control all of it. We need another./
It’s Gred and Forge here. How’s the dragons? Amazing we guess. Anyways, with the fun stuff out of the way, we have some news. We’re positive, you have gotten a letter from our dear insane mother bitching about Sirius’ will reading. To set the record straight, yes we did estrange ourselves from our mother, and yes, Harry now speaks to Slytherins but there is a reason for this. Reasons that cannot be explained in a letter. We advise you to come back to England under the guise of thinking about joining the Order. If you do come down, bring Bill with you so that we can talk all together.
To Hermione Granger, I leave only one book about the true meaning of friendship. I am ashamed of what I have found out about you. I thought you would always be Harry’s friend but it seems I was wrong. I have left a note for Harry that, if he ever forgives you for what you have done, tells him what you get from my will.
Harry had always been a twisted child, using his magic to make his relatives fear him at a young age. He had had to interfere and erase their memories because he had gotten too violent and The Boy Who Lived couldn’t be evil. He hoped the boy was dead because then he could get all the money in the Potter vaults and all the other vaults under the boy’s name. He had kept them from the boy so that when he died defeating Voldemort, they would all go to Dumbledore and the Weasleys especially when they had slipped a love potion to Harry for Ginny. Of course not all the Weasley’s knew about the plan, some were too close to the boy, like the twins, or some were too distanced like Bill and Charlie. Although, if the annoying brat was dead that would probably make the two youngest Weasleys and Granger mad because that would mean they weren’t going to get any money for keeping an eye on Potter. He would have to do some damage control to keep the public from rioting against him.
Slowly, the halls were filled by the wet, slurping of our tongues, smacking of our lips and deep moans and groans sounded from us and when we were finally out of breath, regretfully, we had to separate with harsh pants, not before Draco give me one last soft bite on my lower lip. And like a Slytherin he is, Draco released me and slowly back away as he said; "Good night, Harry. Sweet dreams..."
As we made past the barrier, the sight of the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine with ashes and smoke coming out from the pipe greeted us. Around it was a mob of Hogwarts students with their parents along with trollies and caged pets. We bid goodbye as we went inside to find our sits. We separated from George and Fred as they went with Jordan, their friend. Ginny also when to her group of friends that were in the same year as her. That left the three of us. Upon reaching an empty compartment, we settled down our luggage and trollies.
"Potter, I didn't know that you have become an animal." An arrogant voice said. "Seriously, you should have chosen a better meal."
I finally understood the hatred that the Malfoys expressed upon muggles. They have lost someone. It's a valid reason to loath but not fair that they should do stereotype. Still, I could understand.
As soon as I spotted the so-called "cabin", it stood on top of a small hill. The cabin - no, it was wrong to call it - for it was more like a small mansion made out of fine white wood and grey-bluish stones, give off elegance and pristine.  Then came a path with tiny white pebbles with a vast land laid in front of it, full of different varieties of flowers. A clear separation of the fairy-like state mansion from the dark forest. A walk near it, the side of the manor, I can see the vines climbing in an artistic manner giving a more majestic aura to the place.
His arms that I held up as soon as they were released, enclosed around my neck, and then he whispered to my ear, "Please continue, Harry."
Hermione looked so intense she didn't seem able to breathe in. "You can't make me do this, Harry." She gasped out as tears started to fall out from her eyes. "You can't."
"Wait, Mr. Malfoy. Please do tell us what did Ms. Vane told you for her to earn this." Headmaster asked as he urged Malfoy to return to his seat. "As I said, you are here to be heard, not to be blamed."

Malfoy stood few feet away from us, wand out and lowered as he finishes firing the Incarcerous spell. I stood there, staring at him as I was a complete shock and at the same time, weirdly mesmerized by the way he looks and that he, in fact, defended me from Michael.
Blue crackling like tiny lightning started to emit around my body as I snarled in anger. "Don't touch him!" I charge without care, as I was fueled by anger and at my hand, I whipped out my wand and gritted out a spell, "Fiendfyre!!!"
As I have descended the stairs, I can already hear the chattering from the combined kitchen-diner area. Upon reaching the room, I was greeted by the amazing smell of the food.
He spoke a spell and the newspaper ignited into flames and turn to ashes, scattering on the floor. Tiffany appears behind him and quickly clean the dirt with a spell, in a flash.
"No," I said. My voice was raspy, I guess I must have been shouting longer then I have thought. There was a long silence between us before Hermione broke it. "Nightmare? The same one?"
"So, we were able to find the suggested areas that where we could find Sirius and we went to those places, one by one. Searched those places but ended up as a dead-end until..." I halted unsure if I could continue.
"Not really," I replied with an unaffected tone. Michael Corner was a trying hard bully, he was far less intimidating than Malfoy. Easy to ignored.
Me, Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus climbed up the spiral staircase until we have reached our dormitory, which was located at the top of the tower while Hermione went with the other girls through the doorway to the girls' dormitory. The room had five four-poster beds with the theme color of the Gryffindor, which is deep crimson hangings stood against the walls, each with our trunks at the foot. We all got into our sleepwear and bed.
Hermione tensed up and paled as she heard Draco. She gripped her wand as she nervously followed Draco, hidden behind the thick bushes that surround us, I also end up following her as she pulled me down in urgency.
Draco spoke to us that, it was fine for us to use his tiny manor since no one can enter except for him and his bonded house-elf, Tiffany. He also told us that the manor is surrounded by anti-detection, anti-trespassing, and protective barriers. He assured us that we are welcome to stay. He even gave us the password and key for us to able to access the place.
"Would you stop that!" I grumbled at him as he continued to stare at me. In our background, Hermione was trying but failing to hold on to her laughter as I can still hear her gasping and giggling.
"Please do, Mr. Potter. This is an immediate matter to be solved, after all. I would like to ask the three of you to wait outside for the meantime." She asked softly.
"Bring it back, Malfoy or I'll knock you all over!!!" Michael shouted with vigor, panic is written all over his face as profuse sweat pours from his body.
I stared at her, unbelievingly as soon as she said those words."What do you mean by 'you're on the right track'? And why are you here?"
'What do you mean dead, asshole?" I screamed in my mind. 'I am very much alive if only I could get up. I'm gonna kill you.'
Inhaling and exhaling deeply, Malfoy took another cup of tea then push it towards me. "Tea, Granger?!" he offered. "For the nerves."
' I did say you were dead but now you're alive. I made you possible to be alive. After all, we made a deal.'
Mr. Weasley dash towards their room and after a moment, he went out fully clothed; wizardry office attire and was combing his hair. "Molly and kids, I'll be going now. Molly, are going to be alright taking the kids to the King's Cross?"
"Hmm..." He muttered as he turns his attention to his butterflies. Throwing again a handful of blood beads, making them swoop down for it.
After that nerve-wracking and butterfly fluttering long kiss between us, Draco and I, finally separated in favor of wanting to ...hmm... calm down and think before doing anything drastic which I almost couldn't do as I couldn't stop kissing or thinking of Draco.
"Yes..." Hermione answered but came to a stop as soon as she saw my expression. "Is something wrong, Harry?"
"Thanks," I whispered to her. Ginny only simper at me. As she took a cold towel and put it on my forehead.
"Let's find something to break this...thing off you, Harry" Hermione declared with so much conviction.
"Why would I?" Malfoy answered back. "I have all the right to evoked a lawsuit against her in the ancient ways of the old wizardly law."
I can feel his eyes on me with such intensity as if he was trying to find all the secrets hidden within me. After a while, he sighed then gracefully sat beside me.

I silence myself as I bowed my head down, afraid that he would notice my flushed face and my ogling.
I was completely dazed. I didn't felt a spec of irritation for being laugh at instead I sighed in satisfaction as I successfully made THE Ice Prince of Slytherin laugh. It was like I have won a lottery. But better!
Then we heard a cough. As slowly our lips connect was as fast we separated.  At the door, leaned against the door frame were the twins Fred and George with evil smirks that promise torture for both of us.
The raindrops fall on to our tent as it - pitter-pattered. And as the rain grew louder and stronger, now and then birds would chirp as the thunder would roar, the wind would howl and, the lightning would flash across the sky. The cold air from the forest would swipe in our tent, while Hermione and I had sat across each other with a cup of cocoa in both of our hands.
I can't judge them after I did look like one. Whenever my hunger comes to me, the iris in my eyes would be tainted by the color red and the white ball of my eyes would turn black. My skin would even turn pale and the visible veins on my neck, arms, hands, feet, and legs would turn to dark purple to black shade. But what absolute tore my mind and my heart apart - is the way I was treated by the people that I have looked up to and have treated as a family. I can't question their fear but to completely shun me...was the less than I have expected.
"What do you mean 'I guess'?" Hermione snapped at me. She suddenly grabbed my shoulder and urge me to stand up. "Let me see them. Let's go to Myrtle's bathroom."
"Do tell me, Professor McGonagall. Why I am the only one to be lectured about this incident? I thought that you will hear my side of the story and not assume that I was the only one that had done something wrong. Isn't it too unfair?" Malfoy said coldly.
Headmaster Dumbledore coughed behind us, stealing our attention. Blushing, the three of us, turned to him.
"I might have an idea of what creature he had turned to. Judging from his behavior as well as the physical signs that he was showing but..." he stopped in the middle of his sentence.
And before I could react, the spell hit me. Tearing my flesh around my abdomen, blood seeped out from me, as I fell on the ground, soiling the grass. Turning the green grass to red from my blood and my guts that spill out from my body. It hurts. The pain is too much. My breath came short as I gasp for air.
“Harry!” Hermione gasped in surprise as she ogled at me with her wide eyes open. “You look good in that outfit.”
I was woken that early morning by the nudging of Mrs. Weasley, whispering to me to wake up. I felt that I barely had lain and slept in Ron's room. I slept late last night because I couldn't sleep at all. Not because of a nightmare this time around but because I had a lot think of, especially about my demon and Remus's reaction yesterday. Apparently, It was time to wake up and prepare for the departure to Hogwarts.
"I see..." He whispered. "I forgot how ignorant you are about magic laws and bonds when, comparing to Granger, who is more knowledgeable and is more welcoming with the idea of House-elf sharing a meal with its owner."
She was the one who also took the liberty to extract the blood from the bodies of the hobgoblins while I was knocked out and I only woke up after an hour. Draco was resting beside me as we were under the tree, waiting for me. My strength returned to me when Hermione gave me some extracted blood from the bodies of the creatures. I burned their bodies afterward and carried Draco on my back while I silently submerged in guilt and the feeling of uselessness.
I could feel my face turn to a surprised expression as I heard Draco called Sirius - Uncle. Sirius was also stunned as he stood there with a hanging jaw. Apparently, Mr. Malfoy was also astonished as well as the rest of the Weasleys and Hermione.
As the train doors opened, We gathered and left the train. Unaware, I started to search for the pale blond hair in the midst of the thick crowd but couldn't find him.
I couldn't stop myself from staring at Draco. The whole scenario is so surreal but what made me oggled at the sincere look on Draco's face.
I was in darkness again. As I burn in pain, in hunger, and the hollow bottomless pit of insanity. I just want to end this all. I beg anyone to douse the black fire within me - relieve me by letting me eat or by death.
As the day progress, afternoon classes are to start - so is Divination. Both of us, I and Ron went back to our dormitory to fetch our books and charts - with an exception of Hermione since she has Ancient Runes instead of Divination. With copies of Unfogging the Future in both of our hands, we went down to the common room and thru the portrait. Walking towards the tower, climbing the long winding stairs - reaching the top level, Ron halted as he was trying to catch his breath.
I held him tightly, afraid that once I let him go, he’ll vanish before me. I loved him so much that it hurts whenever the thought of him dying passes my mind. I took a glimpse of him, he had that angelic face as ever, that at this moment possessed that stern but pained look.
The choking feeling in my throat and stabbing pain in my chest slowly disappear as I saw clearly in her eyes - the concern and the determination to help me. I am truly lucky to have a friend like Hermione.
"Here, to put you in a good sleep." He grabs my collar and pulled me as his lips closing in on me.  This time, my heart beats with so much more force as his tongue licked my lips as if asking for permission to explore inside of me. I, gasped in shock as my eyes widen and saw him looking at me with a smothering look, with a pink hue under his eyes. Draco took his opportunity to enter inside my mouth when I had gasped and as his tongue touched mine, ecstasy runs through my body and my toes curl in bliss.
I close my eyes savoring the food as I moan in delight. The food in front of me, immediately, continuously to enter my mouth as I eat more with a happy tune, humming away. I never thought I would enjoy eating this much after what happened to me. I was wrong!
I don't know if being a dark creature is more sinful than cheating on your girlfriend with your ex-rival.
I called out her name more of disbelief of her hearing her say something so vulgar while Draco called out her name with amusement and proud tone as he muttered: "So, Gryffindors could be taught. I am proud of you, Hermione!"
Ron beside me thought that my predicament was totally hilarious as his face was red as a tomato and he was shaking from trying to stop his laughter. I scowled in irritation. I'm starting to think that Hermione was right about Divination.
"Sirius?" I asked as soon as I released him from my embrace, looking around to see if there's a mop of black hair among the midst of redheads or even a sight of a huge black dog but none was found.
Five to ten years that's already a heavy crime. I should say, it was a good thing Malfoy did cut off Romilda's tongue. To stay in Azbakan even for a week could make someone mad. Imagine all the Dementors going in and out to suck all your happy memories. I tremble at that thought.
The twins had noticed the agitation that is oozing from their mother, as they both stop bickering at each other.

After giving me the small leather pouch, he walked away from me. Inside the pouch, were the same blood pebbles that he was feeding his butterflies.
"Come here." He said as he beckoned me with his hand. " Let's start with this one to test our theory about you."
Eying for a good measure, he started to swirl the content of his cup in a rhythmic manner, I can see a calculating eye.
Shaking my head, I snapped out from my dazed mind. Wonders are still out there, waiting for us to be discovered and this is one of them. Walking towards Hermione, I took some utensils from her and started helping as well.

We spent the whole morning trying to drill the tactics with everyone in the team and by afternoon, we had a small break as Hermione and the girls from the Gryffindor brought some snacks. Ron was already eating his portion while Ginny was waving for me to get down to the ground as I was still up on my broom. As I was about to fly to them, I notice a group of people on the far side of the Quidditch field. They seem to be fighting or rather chasing someone. I flew towards them, and as I shorten the distance between them and me. I realizing that they were: Michael Corner and his group (Terry Boot, Anthony Goldstein, Grant Page, and Jason Samuels) and in the middle of their circle, the one they are cornering was none other than Draco Malfoy.
I took a deep breath and brace myself. "When I eat raw meat. That's the only time, that the food had some taste in it."
"Your intention is good but the result will be devastating." He said seriously. "Your goal will cause death for the house-elves. Their extinction."
"Mate! Red eyes. Then it could be Voldermort, again, giving you nightmares! Except for this time, he using a girl. That's really disturbing!!!" Ron abruptly stood up and walk towards me as he laid one of his hands on my left shoulder. "We have to tell the Headmaster."
After dinner, all of us went towards the Gryffindor tower, the entrance which was hidden behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress.
The silence in the entire room was making me nervous as I gulped my own saliva and my sweat broke out, even Ron and Hermione waited unnervingly for the Headmaster's next words.
"Why?" I asked him after a minute of processing his suggestion. Him being generous so suddenly is hard to take in for me.
Sighing, I smiled at her. "It helps, Hermione." Relief flash within my chest which was full of anxiety, pain, and tiredness. "You do help a lot, Hermione. Thank you."
Shaking, I inhaled deeply and realize that my every encounter of the house-elves that I tried to save clearly fear it and I am angry with my ignorance and arrogance. Now, I know what was Malfoy was talking about. I was only seeing the light side, My own point of view.
"Where are you going?" Ron spoke aloud. Ron, Ginny, and with twins look at us with a questioning gaze.
So I run - I scrambled to the second floor and to get my broomstick.  Somebody called my name I think it was Hermione but I could not care less. I climbed out of the window and ride away on my firebolt as fast as I can. I didn't care where I was going. I just flew - fast and hard. All the different techniques in the broom, I just did it all. My knuckles turn white as I gripped my broom too hard and gritted my teeth. I allowed the wind blow my face, the whistle of the harsh wind deafened my ear and the pain in my muscles erupted from the strained of being abused - swallow me whole - calming me from my head to my toes. I emerged from my rage and I slowed down my fly. Having the anger dissipate from me, I felt nice and free. I was calm.
"Wrong, Malfoy?" Michael glared at Malfoy as he tries to stand up but seems to be failing as he staggered a bit.
Realizing that she couldn't defend herself, she lift her upper body facing me. Her face was full of terror as she was waiting for me to end her life. Begging me, with her cries and calling out for the name - 'Harry'. I was happy as I slowly approach the human. At last, I could finally eat.
"Yes it is. I saw them hiding there on the back of the audience sit as they were watching you all." He said.
It seems the Hobgoblin that I just killed off was a scout and following close to him is his herd. Upon smelling the blood of their brethren, they attacked us. We were lucky enough that we survive that hunting team but were unfortunate to encounter them. Worse, Draco was injured as he shielded Hermione because I was too distracted. I panic and released a dangerous spell that almost set the forest on fire and might have killed both Draco and Hermione. It's a good thing, Hermione was there as she was the one, who fixed Draco up and snapped me out of my outburst.
The day of the quidditch match had finally arrived. I sat with the rest of the Gryffindor, at the table there was an awkward and tense aura around. I can totally understand the feeling as butterflies swoosh in the stomach making me feel nauseated. Adding to my worries with the match was my empty leather pouch, the blood pebbles were all gone since yesterday, which made me irritated since I couldn't eat properly with any meal without it. And I couldn't find Malfoy since the incident with Michael. Sighing as I flex my shoulder and flinched in irritation since I was so hungry.
I stumbled as I don't know what to say maybe from too much shock that was in my system or I just didn't know where to start.
Then a chortle of laughter sounded out - Fred and George. They immediately stood up and started acting.
' I am happy for Harry.' She said as she dances gracefully around me, making her long black hair twirl with her movements.
"Yes. I still have this." Malfoy showed the forgotten notebook. "I can show this to Professor McGonagall"
My whole body tensed up from my anger towards him. I have not been in my top shape these recent days and I am in no condition to pretend to be Mr. Goody goody, especially if this bastard is going keep on slandering my father.
"Mate! I have been shouting your name for million times." He grumbled as he had reached my destination. "You have been distracted these past days. What's wrong, Harry?"
I am already at the end of my wits as I am finally admitting to myself that I am officially aware that I am attracted to my ex-rival.
"Oh good, you can now hear us. I thought you went into a seizure state when you are not responding to us." Malfoy snickered. "But you have to know your head is too hard. Look at my hand, it is all red from hitting you."
"The barrier broke." I said then I took her hand and pulled her. Hermione screams in surprise. I had no time to explain to her my plan, so I just executed it. When Hermione was in my arms, I carried her in bridal style and speed up my run.
Diagon alley was lively as ever. There were shops for anything and everything. Honest shopkeepers bellowed down the streets. The chortle of children at Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour. Bustling of people as they hurriedly passed by. Hoots of owls and snarls of cats are heard as we passed by Eeylops Owl Emporium and Magical Menagerie. The thick smell of everything mixed through the air which I usually find myself nauseated but at the same time made me feel excited and giddy like a child.
"Whoa, Harry your green" One of the twins, George commented about me, his voices are laced with heavy concern.
"So much for the mighty Potter! HA!" He sneered as he hit me again on my chest. Pain erupted as his fist made an impact. And another one hit me. "Weak!"
Taking a guess and being confident of who's blood in my milk is as I already was accustom to the taste of Draco's and Hermione's blood. Hermione was more like a coffee with a hint of cinnamon while Draco was like mint-like and vanilla all together.
"Dragon!" Hagrid surprised with the prospect of seeing his long-time dream pet cried out. "Wha' Dragon?"
“No, I am not,” I said, rubbing away the tears and as I tried to make my voice steady but the more I struggle, the more it comes out hoarse. We held each other’s hands, I become aware that he was cold; his hands felt like ice. I tremble as a surge of panic and a wave of despair came crashing down on me as I comprehend what is to come. I told him that everything will be alright, that he’ll live on. That help will come, eventually. I recited words of comfort to him but it was only to soothe the growing fear inside of me.
Tiffany levitates the basket filled with bread, the pot of hot soup, and the teapot on to the table. Everybody settled down as each took a seat and serve themselves with a bowl of soup and a piece of hot pipping croissant, smearing with either butter or blueberry jam, and pouring for themselves a cup of tea to go along with their meal.
"It was all a coincidence, Harry. No need for any guilt or what-so-ever that is running in your head. I was sent here by my parents as a vacation. For me to clear my mind because of my misconduct behavior by cutting somebody's tongue. That's all to it," He grinned at me.
Ron and I groaned, quietly. So these are the days that we will be bored with searching our true selves through what? Ugh! Tea leaves, apparently. Yup! The joy... Bollocks!!!
My attention was suddenly diverted as I heard voices that call out a name - Harry, they say. I also can hear the rushing of blood from everybody that is near me, even the thudding rhythm of their hearts that made me salivate and grind my teeth with anticipation.
I scrambled up from where I lay, awaken from my slumber. Eyes wide open as I scan my unfamiliar surroundings. Flinching from the brightness of the light of the sun from windows, I found out that I was in a seemingly wide space room, ivory cream-colored furniture, slightly opened high glass windows covering the entire one side of the room, showing the patio and white semi- see thru curtains as they dance from the wind that passes by. No portrays were hanged in the room to help me identify who was the owner of the said room.
Blinking into awareness, I slowly sat up. What greeted me was a jaw-dropping scene - Draco Malfoy, carrying a tray of food. Wow! I knew it! The world is really coming to an end. This just does not make any sense!
