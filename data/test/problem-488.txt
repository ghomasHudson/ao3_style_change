Harry wrinkled his nose but he didn’t stop thrusting. "Not really my thing, girls."
Draco nodded his bent head. "You’re going to come in me, aren’t you? I’ll get shocked, it’s going to hurt—please--"
"Good with wandless magic, then," Charlie said with a nod. "That’s helpful for this kind of thing."
"Don’t worry, you can make it hurt, but it won’t compress enough to damage. You try it now," Charlie said. "Though it’s spelled to me, so you might need your wand—"
"And my arse, Potter? You won’t leave that alone--is that your point? Want to prove what a cock-slut I am, see how much you can make me leak by fingering my hole?"
"Sir, I’ll call you sir. Would you like that?"
"Is that filthy mouth clean now?" Charlie asked when he was back in standing position in the living room.
"Potter’s not the right name either," Harry said. He flipped Draco over and yanked his arse in the air. "And it’s not my fault you’re a slut." He rubbed one finger in and out then added a second, loving the pained moans coming now. "You love a finger-fuck, don’t you? No wonder Charlie makes you take it in one thrust."
"That’s pretty entitled for a slave, don’t you think?" Harry brought his finger up to poke at Malfoy’s chest. "Charlie’s been spoiling you." Clearly Malfoy needed someone to give him more discipline. Someone like Harry.
Harry whispered a lubrication charm and moved a hand to Draco’s arse, staying on top of the charmed silk. He molded the fabric to the crack and explored until he found the telltale divot he was looking for. "No," he murmured, as he tickled Draco’s hole. "That doesn’t appeal to me."
"A trip to the Leaky with the manual labor branch of the law, how lovely," Draco sniffed as they followed Ron out. His chin was still high but now his smile was barely hidden. "You think you can buy me off with cheap lager, Potter?"
He cringed inside but he licked. He swiped the rubber clean and sucked the drool back in and told himself he wasn’t being obedient so much as he was hiding the evidence. He couldn’t stand to see his spit on Potter’s shoe all night.
"You—what--best?"
"If it’s filthy, it’s only because of the wretched state of your shoe," Draco said. Which he probably shouldn’t have.
Charlie laughed. "Oh, poor pet," he said, scratching at Draco’s side. "He knows what it means. There’s two more below it too if you take a look, one just at the crease and one across his thighs. You’ll see."
"Yes, all right? He knows I’m attracted to you. Even if I thought you were a complete arse."
Draco’s eyes were still half-closed but he was looking down to where the shift was still tangled around his cock. His cheeks were turning pink. "I’m supposed to—it’s a rule--"
Ron was already standing, cloak slung over one shoulder. "Fancy a Friday night pint or two? Hermione’s having a meeting at ours and the place is going to be wall-to-wall house elves." He wrinkled his nose. "Five minutes stuck in a knee-high scrum and you start to understand why giants go on rampage."
"Is there something in particular you’re thinking of?" Charlie asked, when he’d got his ability to speak back. "Go on, pet, go suck Harry for a while. I can’t think, I’m getting too close."
He raised his eyes again to Draco, almost shyly this time. Draco met his gaze with the same emotion welling up inside them, held back from spilling over only by the pure-blooded, overly starched skin of his well-bred teeth.
"I’ll bring in some sub who does like it," Harry said promptly. "Making him top some other boy? Putting him in charge of someone else’s slave? I’d love to see that."
He finished, turned the water off, and carefully released the nipple clamps. Draco cried out as each one sprang free but stayed head to the floor until Harry tapped his shoulder, and he sat. His face was more relaxed than ever and his body swayed slightly to some internal rhythm but his cock was hard and bobbing.
He’d spent so much time denying what he wanted. He’d always had fantasies of a man kneeling before him, servicing him, taking his cock deep, gagging a little but loving it. Of fucking a man rough, hearing him cry out as Harry forced his way in, of a ball’s deep relentless pounding while the poor sod begged to be allowed to come. Sometimes Harry said yes, in the fantasy. Sometimes he said no.
Assuming Charlie liked Harry’s offer. He’d had Draco since Romania. The brat’d been sent out to work in the dragon sanctuary as part of his probation deal, with Charlie as his overseer. There he’d tossed his blond hair and waggled his arse and dragged his feet and kicked up a fuss at everything he was asked to do until Charlie had been forced—forced!—to put him over his knee and deliver a sound spanking. After which, said brat had demanded a fingering, then a fucking, then crawled smiling into his bed and stayed and stayed. Charlie’d had no choice but to train up the little beast.
"He’s got to have the signal," Charlie said. "Can’t take you in his mouth without permission."
Draco waited until Ron turned away then glared unholy death at him. His mouth opened to protest in some way that wouldn’t be too revealing—
Someone was in his house. Someone who needed to be hunted and
Harry smiled. “Your eyes are grey.”
“You’re telling me…” Draco said slowly. “To tell the truth. You. Blaise Zabini.”
As his racing heart began to slow, Draco was left wondering why it felt like he’d just lost something very important.
“Well, fuck.”
Potter hesitated, but finally nodded. “I’d like to go back in and work out what happened, but we can’t,” he agreed reluctantly.
.” He paused. “Although, it does have a faintly messiah-istic feel to it that we could exploit.” He cut that thought off before it could begin and handed Pansy her glass. “Listen, Pans. I’m on their case now. I can’t afford to cause scandal.”
The warm bed by the window called invitingly to Harry. He’d been planning on having a nap. It was going to be wonderful. Now he had to drag himself all the way back down to the Great Hall to find McGonagall and ask about the room assignments.
“I’ll do it.”
“This is what it looks like inside?” Draco asked, still running his hand along Potter’s back but turning to George. “The first box must have triggered the dormant spell in the second—I should have thought of that.” He grimaced, silently cursing his own stupidity.
(No, it’s not enough.)
“Well. Okay, then. As long as you’re happy. All we want is you to be happy, mate,” Ron said, and then, to himself, like he still couldn’t believe it, despite them sitting right there, on the other end of the sofa: “
The part of him that was still in full-blown flight mode after their ‘fake’ argument flared into life the second he saw Potter’s face. A thin sheen of sweat covered Potter’s face, and his eyes stared blankly ahead. If Draco didn’t know better, he’d think Potter had just been tortured.
“Robards didn’t even read it properly. Just kept going on about the budget and how the Ministry can’t be seen playing favourites.”
Draco felt a rush of something hot flood through him, and he pushed it back with a gulp.
Because he was watching Malfoy so closely, taking care not to drink any more than him, he noticed that Malfoy hardly drank. He either passed the bottle off or took a sip so deceptively long that it looked like he was keeping up when he really only swallowed once. The others soon slipped into a comfortably drunken state, and Malfoy relaxed against the pillows, his cheeks pleasantly flushed and his guard—for once—completely down.
Granger laughed. “This family has a tendency to breathe life into things.” Draco didn’t miss the gentle reverence to her tone.
Suddenly, Malfoy sat up and straddled him, his fingers tracing a line up to Harry’s neck. “I want to try something,” he said, slightly unsure. “It’s a little strange.”
“I can’t figure it out,” Draco admitted. “But it has to be something. Everything keeps tying together, over and over. Fate has her hands all over this.”
Then, the Curse Breaker in him woke up and began to analyse. Drawn by something he couldn’t explain, he focused on Potter, watching only his face as the scenes around them changed. The expressions on Potter’s face moved as quickly as their surroundings, and with each passing second, he grew more agitated, more confused by all the conflicting memories. In some moments, he was almost unrecognisable, and in others Draco was drawn to him so powerfully he had to fight to remain still.
“Seems strange that you need to get inside it when you’re already technically in it,” Potter mused.
“Of course I didn’t
Potter pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath. It was obvious he was trying to be civil, and since this was what Draco had been waiting for all along, he made himself reluctantly put aside the sarcastic retort that was on the tip of his tongue.
classes at Hogwarts. It’ll be just like them. It’s not going to be like Binns or anything.”
It was an excellent question. But it didn’t have an answer, so Harry just turned away.
“Do you mind which side you sleep on?” Potter asked with a yawn, already fluffing up the pillow. “I usually take this side, but it doesn’t worry me.”
“Do you really think that little of me?” Potter asked suddenly, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat.
Potter smirked. It was an odd expression on his face, and one that sent a strange warmth flipping over in Draco’s stomach. “Unicorn hair core?” He shook his head.
“What double act?” he growled, and Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes at how beautifully Potter was illustrating his point.
“Worth the wait?” Draco asked as he rolled onto his back, his voice heavy with exhaustion and satisfaction.
Harry looked over in surprise, and then realised that Malfoy had spoken mostly to himself. The puzzle pieces joined together, and he became aware that Malfoy genuinely thought he was drunk. He wondered what Malfoy was like to talk to when he wasn’t running everything he said through five layers of self-preservation.
Potter shrugged. “It’s been that way for years—ever since I borrowed your wand.” He sighed, swilling the last of his coffee around in his mug. “I’ve been studying the dual core, specifically the peacock feather, and my research turned up a complimentary link between the feathers and Veela magic about two years ago. I stupidly—”
“Coming!” he laughed nervously and put the thought out of mind as he scrambled to dress in record time. Just like being back at school, he reflected.
Draco closed his eyes. “It didn’t say anything about the final stage. But my book… it said stage three witnesses the final judgment. But there is no judgment. I don’t understand.”
“Stanthrope wasn’t Patient Zero,” Malfoy murmured, face even paler than usual as he read the name off the instrument. “She’s casting it.”
“What’s up with Lavender’s trunks?”
Potter laughed, a little broken, and they fell silent. Just when Draco couldn’t stand it any longer and was about to make his excuses, they both started speaking at once.
“It’s what kids do,” he said aloud, keeping his voice light and distant.
“Yeah, no one’s hurt.”
And that
Her face broke into a smile, though her forehead was still creased with nerves. “Oh that’s lovely. He does such a wonderful job. My friend has been raving about him for weeks, but she couldn’t come today. Her kids have all got the flu and she’s racing around trying to make enough vegetable soup for the lot of them.” She let out a high-pitched laugh and then shut her mouth quickly, as if worried she was too loud.
The redness of Draco’s face deepened. "Yes, I like it. All right? Yes, I’m attracted to him. Not that he’s perfect or anything—honestly, his hair could be a registered sanctuary for migrating birds—"
Charlie tapped his neck and Draco pulled off as gracefully as he could, resisting the urge to wipe his face on Charlie’s pants. That would get him the genuine type of punishment, not the fun over the knee type.
"Charlie’s bed, you mean." Harry reached out a hand and plucked at the white shift Malfoy had on. It looked like something a monk would wear, all pristine and severe, but it moved like silk. "What’s this, anyway? Thought he’d have you sleeping naked."
He flashed a wicked smile before dropping over the side of the bed onto the soft rug. It wouldn’t be polite to wake Charlie up with a shaking mattress. With a firm hand on Draco’s wrist, he dragged him to the rug too, flipping him to be underneath and pushing Draco’s mouth open for a kiss as he toed off his own PJs. He checked the chain—there was more than enough slack—then slipped down Draco’s body and sucked his silk-covered cock into his mouth.
Not that it mattered which he wanted. He was getting the fucking no matter what. That thought only stiffened him further. Potter’s hands returned to Draco’s hips and that was all the warning he had—then Potter was pulling out, all the way to the puckering arsehole, and shoving back in again, hard as he liked.
"No, of course not," Charlie said. "I make mistakes—everyone does—and I let him know I’m sorry. There’s no sense pretending to be perfect. It’s a lie and lies kill the trust that’s crucial for this. It’s good instinct to apologize, admit it, and then try not to do it again."
Draco screamed inside. Clean was marvelous, of course, but what he wanted right now was a massive fucking orgasm. Before his bollocks exploded.
Charlie took pity. "So, you going to give him that reward? If you liked what you got, that is."
A ring with a thin chain attached lay in the middle of the hosing area, right beneath Draco’s bollocks. Harry, having a feel now for how Charlie liked to run things, had an idea for where that was supposed to attach. He brought the ring up and snicked it around Draco’s cock and bollocks and sure enough it fit perfectly, holding him in place. The thin chain grew taut when Harry took his hand away, pulling down just enough to make Draco grunt and spread his legs a little wider, getting a little lower to ease the pull.
“How do you feel?” he asked finally, perching on the edge of the bed. He didn’t know if he was allowed any closer.
Potter still smelled like alcohol, but it wasn’t anywhere near as bad as yesterday morning, and Draco ignored it.
comfort?
His face flushed with warmth as he waited for Potter to say something about his choice of location, but Potter only looked over at him and smirked. Draco’s cock stirred at the sight.
Draco counted down the Portkey, and then they were sucked through to a glittering foyer.
Pansy narrowed her eyes in suspicion, but Granger only laughed. “Yeah, well, we did warn you. Did he throw things at you? Or did he just kick you straight out?”
Malfoy to know this next bit: “I liked it when you were looking at me.”
“Maybe because they were never really yours, not like all of your animals together are,” Harry suggested, and then he reached out and took the feather from the air. Light bounced off the radiant colours, reflecting in ways that spoke of magic rather than physics, and Harry said, “These are the last two birds for your Sanctuary, aren’t they? Your flock have all come home now?”
Thanks so much for your lovely comments! And special thanks to hootiepatootie for looking into Noirot (so cute!!!) And Hino_Hatari for giving me the inspiration for the setting in this chapter :)
Draco didn’t know. He’d never looked at crime stats—never even
Draco stared at him incredulously. “Because you need help.”
Then he realised Potter meant true Veela, not half Veela, and the reason why he had never found that tidbit in his own texts slotted into place.
something—but he has to ask. “Why did you want to change everything?”
“When are you going home?” Harry asks, shifting his hat so at least his face is covered in shade. That’s sun-smart enough. His eyes are closed and he keeps having to catch himself against falling asleep.
They were in a dark room, lit by a soft, white glow from somewhere Draco couldn’t see. The walls were covered in thick black curtains. When Potter saw these, he stiffened, and Draco unconsciously reached out to run a hand along his back, though he was unsure what had happened.
I’ll send you the best. You’re wearing a lot of yellow at the moment, aren’t you? I’ll ask the assistant what suits a yellow outfit.
“But we will be.”
The fact that Malfoy didn’t take the opportunity to imply Harry had never read a book before was what drove home the truth more than anything. Harry took back the parchment and stared at the words, heart racing. “Why can’t I read it then?”
,” he groaned. “Why do you always have to be such an arse? I meant about us. I want to tell them about us.”
Potter followed Draco’s line of sight and froze. “That’s the curse,” he said quietly, and Draco nodded as though he had already figured it out.
Draco’s anger drained away as suddenly as it had appeared. “Stop looking for an argument and work
Draco considered a biting retort, but he always had struggled to aim the Quaffle perfectly, and…
“You’re the bravest person I’ve ever met.”
Draco stopped reading the paper when it kept publishing ridiculous lies about the pair of them. But if he’s started reading it again, maybe he’s stopped caring about the articles?
What was there to lose, indeed? Something niggled at Draco, but he didn’t have words for it, and he’d be lying if he said he hadn’t been thinking of attempting something like this too.
Potter drained his glass and lifted his gaze to glare into the mirror behind the bar. For a moment, his eyes darted to the family where they’d moved into the corner, but he quickly looked away again. Draco tried to catch Potter’s gaze in the mirror, but he was intent upon himself, eyes fierce as he stared down his own reflection. As Draco watched, a strange sort of shift came over Potter’s features—a fierce disgust that burned so strong below Potter’s skin it couldn’t help but leak through to the surface.
Three waiters appeared at their side, offering champagne and scotch in crystal tumblers. Soon enough, they found themselves settled on a chaise off to the side, and Draco found himself relaxing.
Malfoy heaved a great sigh and elaborated: “7:00 is when our neighbours like to demonstrate their inability to produce an adequate silencing charm.”
“Yeah. It’s…” He trailed off. “It’s not healthy for me.”
When he entered the room, he found Potter already sitting cross legged, staring mutely at the circle and presumably waiting for the potion.
“She’ll come out when she trusts we can help her, I suppose,” Harry said, sticking his hands in his pockets and looking around the balcony as if Miss Stanthrope would emerge from the walls.
“You’re happy there?” she asked. “The furniture has been rearranged a little since you were here last, so feel free to take any of the other seats.”
Draco bit down on a triumphant smile—Potter was still enjoying his company, even if he wouldn’t admit it. “Of course.”
Draco bit his tongue to keep from pointing out that Potter already knew them all.
“I had an illustrated version, you know. She and her sweetheart—the aforementioned—escape her by transforming themselves into all manner of things: a lake and a duck, a rose and a fiddler. It’s all very romantic and intense, and they defeat the witch, but her lover is ensnared by another and soon forgets her. The original translations skip over this part, but Pureblood memory is long.”
It was the first time they had approached anything close to a civil conversation since yesterday, and he felt the strangest sensation that he didn’t want to mess it up. He recalled George’s words from last night, and the painful certainty that he’d ruined it all—whatever
“See, the witch’s wand was never hers in the first place. There are many stories that like to claim our power came from the Fair Folk, that the first wizards and witches were immortal, and when we turned our backs on them and ran off with the gift we had been given, they cursed us with mortality and left our world forever, retreating back beneath the hills and forests. In the fairy tale, the witch’s wand was one of the stolen, and when the Fair Folk realised it was in the hands of a weak child, they took their chance to regain it.”
He cleared his throat and took out his toolkit. “Since I’m inside its defences now, I should be able to get a little further today. I’m hoping to locate two pressure points, maybe even three.”
“Malfoy, I know it pains you to hear this, but I know what I’m doing. The curse has… shape in your dreams. I had to identify it before, so I couldn’t attack, but I know it now. I can fight it. I lost you when the dream started to shift around, but I won’t this time.”
He nearly said something. Nearly tore into the two of them, sitting so innocently across the table from him, but he held back. If he hadn’t, he would have ruined not only the friendships at the table, but the trust that he and Potter were slowly building—and that was too dear a price to pay, even for the satisfaction of knowing he was
Potter’s eyes sparkled with mirth. It was just the tiniest bit electrifying, sharing a joke with Potter like this. Even if Draco did desperately wish it were true. He wondered momentarily what the papers would print, if the bartender ran his mouth off.
He jolted forward, out of his chair, but came to his senses halfway across the room and froze. Something caught the light in the corner of his eye, looking like an hourglass with the sand running out, but Draco didn’t own an hourglass so that must be wrong.
Potter shot him a withering look but didn’t replace the glib humour with an actual answer.
Soulmates.
“No,” Harry said, feeling himself beginning to soften despite his words. “I don’t. I just—what exactly did you want to do tonight?”
She knew. Or at least suspected. Thankfully, Potter’s immediate reaction was one of shock. He leaned back in his seat.
They stare at one another. In the span of several heartbeats, Harry imagines Malfoy storming out, pushing him away, even hurting him in the sudden onslaught of fear and insecurity that could so easily guide his next moves. He holds his breath, fingers still loosely grasping Malfoy’s hair, too scared to pull them away.
In retrospect, he was surprised it had taken him this long to realise he was falling in love with Potter; he had only ever been a hair’s breadth away from it in the first place.
He knew what the connection was: the Malfoy line. Peacocks were linked to Malfoys, and Malfoys were linked to Veela, but what the hell did Potter know?
Even he snorted at the blatant lie in that one, startling a resting owl on the sign beside him into taking flight and showering him with cold droplets of snow that he probably deserved. His life was a mess. But then, he’d been given the chance to study an area in his field that no witch or wizard had been given for hundreds of years, and in return, he just had to take the teensy tiny problem of developing a crush on the least available wizard of his generation. Surely, it was worth it.
Stitched lovingly by some kooky, ancient relative who had shunned the unwritten Malfoy code that said one must not enjoy anything, ever, it was the brightest piece of furniture he could recall seeing in his childhood home, and every time he looked at it, he found some new detail hidden in the artwork. Today, his eyes were drawn to the children playing by the town Christmas tree. They were crowded around a small, wooden chest, as someone dressed as Santa Claus reached inside to select their gifts.
He threw his arms back around Harry’s neck and came, spurting high over Harry’s hand, arcing chest-high, striping himself with thick white lines. His cry was long and completely undone, involuntary, full of blissful release.
"None of your business," Potter said, still scribbling without looking up. "I have no idea how you know these things anyway. Is it some branch of divination I missed out on? Does it come to you in dreams, who’s shagging who, and why, and how?"
Harry tucked himself in behind Draco, kneeling too, legs pressed to legs, chest to back. He reached around and took Draco in his hand, loving the heavy weight, the heat, the swell of him.
"How do you feel about someone else touching what you’ve bought while you’re learning the ropes? I’ll be honest, the other night you looked a might possessive." Of something you didn’t own, no less, he added to himself.
Potter headed into the hallway, watching Draco over his shoulder and moving slowly enough that he could easily keep up. His septum had adjusted to the pressure and it was no more than a low background throb, warning him to stay obedient. Even a little flick of the lead could hurt. Potter opened a door—idiot, that was the first one, not the second—and found the bedroom. A quick glance around then he closed the door again and took them on to the second one.
"There, I’m just a little wider at the base. That’s it, you’ve got all of me." Potter’s voice was as soothing as his fucking was implacable. Hands stroked down his sides and over his lower back. "I’ll give you that moment now to adjust to me before I ream you out."
Malfoy flicked his wrist and the files whumped onto Harry’s desk. "Subsections 2J through 6M are missing on all of these. Must be done tonight. So sorry."
Draco let out a pleased-sounding sigh as he was pulled up. He’d be feeling it all day tomorrow, Harry knew, feeling the burn, the memory of fullness and he’d squirm every time he sat.  The thought warmed Harry in a way that was surely very, very wrong but made him smile anyway. The guilt about what he liked was fading, replaced by the memory of Draco’s post-fuck face: sleepy and satisfied.
"Can I bite your fingers off if I don’t like what you say?"
"Just making sure nothing’s getting pinched here." The fingers stroked soothingly across the gossamer of the ball harness.
Malfoy turned and nuzzled into Charlie while shooting Harry a covert look that said
Draco set to work on Charlie’s cock, starting with a long lick from bollocks to head as he’d been taught. Charlie sighed happily and spread his legs.
Harry was trying to pay attention but Draco was really working him now. Deep strokes, hand and mouth both, wet and long and full of suction. Harry’s eyes were closing and his head was tipping back—
That wouldn’t do at all. Draco came back and rested said bum on the edge of the desk. "Is there a special someone you’ll be disappointing with your tardiness tonight? It can’t be the She-Weasel. I know you aren’t together anymore."
Draco’s lips quirked up. "There are nicer dungeons than that place."
"So what then?" Harry asked, pushing that image away with difficulty. "If you’re so experienced at denial why are you kicking up a fuss at me?"
"Kiss his feet and say you’re sorry, Draco," Charlie added, his voice low and firm. His other hand pressed firmly on Draco’s back, fingers spread, implacable.
Potter fiddled with something by Draco’s balls, tickling him a little inadvertently, but he knew what Potter was looking for. Charlie’s blocks always had a ring there and sure enough, a moment later Potter found it and snapped it over the top of his sack. Restraint device and cock ring all in one. Oh joy, what a marvelous design.
Draco groaned helplessly. The burn was intense but it was already changing from pain into the overwhelming sensation of a long thick cock taking him all at once. Out again and in again and he could feel sweat beading under his arms. Potter’s too—there was a musk in the air now, a heavy male smell pouring off him—and it made Draco half-wild with need. It made it impossible to forget he was being hard-fucked by cock, that he was being taken and owned and used for another man’s pleasure.
At Charlie’s nod, Potter reached out and stroked his bollocks. The gossamer didn’t diminish sensation—if anything, it heightened it. Pain and pleasure both.
To be precise, Father had raised him to fear being humiliated by other men, to never permit Draco to lose face or be controlled. So of course, this was what he ended up craving. It was just the subconscious taking a real fear and taming it by turning it into fantasy. Honestly. Didn’t they have any training in psychology in Auror school?
"Sounds fun." Charlie mimed a squeeze to the back of the neck, showing Harry the signal. "If I was willing to sell."
"A good slave wouldn’t refuse to answer a simple question from his master’s friend."
them right off the bat anyway."
Yeah? Charlie sure hoped so. He hadn’t grown up poor for nothing—he’d calculated exactly what he could ask and it wasn’t low. He opened his mouth and named his price.
Draco nodded yes, not trusting his voice.
Harry got them both back to bed, though Draco practically had to be carried. He was nearly asleep before he even made the bedroom and he now he was curled peacefully against Harry, hand fisted in Harry’s PJ bottoms. As if Harry was the one who might get away, rather than the reverse.
"Ahhh," Draco said, a sudden strangled feeling making his throat feel thick. This concern, this sweetness would undo him. The submission was back, overwhelming the fear and he stuttered out, "do you want it? Will it please you? Honest, tell me honestly."
"I have a new flat now. You could come over maybe? I mean, you and Charlie." Harry bit his lip. Now they were coming to the heart of the problem. "The thing is, it was the best sex of my life, everything I’d always wanted. I thought you knew that. I felt like you were taunting me, letting me have it once then shutting me out. Showing me what I could never have again. That’s what that little flash of anger was."
Charlie looked up in surprise as the owl careened through the open window and landed on his desk, looking wild-eyed and slightly singed. Brave bird, delivering to a dragon sanctuary. Most Ministry owls wouldn’t come near a place where they were the equivalent of flying biscuits.
"Holy fuck," Harry’s throat worked as he considered that scenario. "Yeah, could manage that, I expect."
Potter nodded, his gaze fixed on Draco’s knees, which he knew for a fact weren’t that interesting. Not bad, of course, but not one of his top ten features. Perhaps—just perhaps--a trifle knobbly, if he had to say. And speaking of knobs…
All the time what he was really thinking was, did Potter like it? Did he appreciate Draco’s pain, did he think Draco was good? That squirming feeling of submission was teetering inside him, ready to flood through and take him over the edge to the place where nothing existed but pleasing the man in front of him. He couldn’t do it, though, unless he knew—did Potter take all that for granted? Or was he, Merlin forbid, thinking that he’d had better? He needed some touch, some reassurance—
Malfoy gave him a withering look and pushed off the wall. "It’s not what? Something you can deny? I was up for a hot fuck, Potter, not a hate fuck. Charlie would never have allowed that. That’s what makes him a good top—" Malfoy’s finger came up and poked him right back, "and you a sick bastard."
Draco rolled his eyes and found his voice. "What? Are you going to take House points, Potter? Ten points from Slytherin for not being a top?"
He’d fought his desires, he’d really tried, even getting back together with Ginny during Auror training. Which was fine, except for the fact it was only manageable because training kept him away for long stretches, then when he was in town he could reasonably claim to be too tired to do anything in bed. Then training was over and he was forced—at the pointy end of an angry red-head’s finger—to admit that he really, absolutely, didn’t want to have sex with her. Or any girl.
"If I come without permission, I get put in chastity." Draco sucked in a breath as the pressure increased even more. "His rule is if I can’t control myself, I have to be controlled."
Harry picked up the first clamp and, feeling carefully, found a nipple. He rolled it between his fingers until it stiffened, then let the clamp bite in. Draco whimpered but stayed in place. Harry took the other one and, after stiffening up the other nipple, let that one bite in too.
"Suck it off," he said, pressing a kiss to Draco’s jaw. "There, that’s good," he went on, as Draco shuddered but starting sucking at his own come where it had pulsed down the front of the shift. "Get it all off. I know you get punished if you don’t clean up after yourself."
Potter soaked the flannel, wrung it dry, then brought it under the blanket. Draco braced himself. Potter wrapped a soothing arm around him—insult to injury, damn it—and twisted the ice-cold cloth around Draco’s cock.
Harry looked as gob-smacked as Draco felt. Of course, Draco hid it better. He hoped. Harry’s breath had sucked in before he even steadied on his feet. His eyes drank Draco in and his fist shot to his crotch, squeezing in the universal gesture for
He’d tried not to worry about it when he was younger. He’d clung to the fact that he also had fantasies about girls, ordinary thoughts about breasts and pussies and how generally nice it would be to get his dick in for a bit of the thrust-o action. Pure vanilla.
"What if there’s something I need that he doesn’t like?" Harry asked a little diffidently. "I mean, I know, top and all. I can just tell him to do it. But what if it’s something he hates?"
"One more," Potter said. His hand ran through Draco’s hair, sending sparks all the way down to his groin. Draco fucking loved hands in his hair. "Come on, give it another kiss and add a little lick this time."
A snicker came from behind. "Don’t waste it on your hand when there’s a perfectly good arse ready to be fucked," Charlie said, finally pausing in his blows. "Unless you want to come on his face of course."
, Draco wanted to whine.
He sighed and took the glass of champagne the waiter offered. He didn’t even like champagne. It got up his nose and upset his stomach. Why couldn’t they ever bring around pints of lager? And maybe some cheese toasties, instead of those unidentifiable little clumps perched on fancy crackers?
"You’re mouthy tonight," Charlie said from the sofa, but he said it with a smile. Charlie liked him mouthy. Liked to correct him for it, beat some manners into him. It never took, of course, which was just fine because Charlie hated stoic, compliant slaves. What would a dragon tamer want with some fluffy bunny of a slave?
Charlie tapped Draco’s shoulder with the release signal and Draco stepped forward with a shiver. His every nerve was attuned to the next signal from the leash, determined to avoid that pain again. Which was, of course, why it worked so well.
"Please don’t make me come," Draco begged but his cock twitched each time Harry’s mouth withdrew. "The little shocks are starting already. They go straight to my cock and bollocks. It’s so much stimulation that one I get close it’s hard to stop."
. I’m in a damn good position to protect him and I bloody well will."
"Unggghhh," Potter said, in the most artless, heartfelt agreement. "Yeah, I want to fuck him." He stood up, not bothering to stuff himself back in his pants. It looked large but Draco couldn’t quite see—
Assuming Harry was here to discuss what he thought. Charlie stood up, waving him over to the sofa, and sending Draco off to bring in drinks.  Harry took the armchair instead, settling into it a little stiffly. He was dressed formally too, Charlie noted, in dark tailored robes and dragonhide boots polished to a shine.
"We made brilliant birds—"
Harry grabbed him, a little rough in his eagerness, rolling his cock across Draco’s tongue, back and forth fast, hard again and leaking pre-come. "Enough," he said with a final grunt, pulling Draco up by the hair and tugging the clip off. "I think I like that a little too much."
Charlie had unlocked a drawer—oh crap, not
Draco dropped his head and sobbed. How fucking long was nine inches? It had to all be in already but Potter just kept fucking forward, pulling Draco’s hips back to meet him, stopping him from squirming away. It felt like a fucking iron rod was being shoved up his arse, Potter was that hard.
Harry flushed. "I could learn all that. You could teach me. If you agreed to sell him to me."
"You? Voluntarily going to a do?" Ron gave him a funny look.
Potter snickered. "If they were going to kill anyone, I’m sure I’d be dead by now." His tone stayed light but the firmness was back as he said, "now do it again. Put your tongue on it and keep it there until I say you can take it off."
Draco lifted his head. His heart was beating fast again but only in anticipation--the maddening panic he’d felt before had vanished. A squirmingly grateful feeling for Charlie’s intuition shot through him, an urge to grovel and beg and offer anything. He opened his eyes, slowly. Charlie stood in front of him, hands on the buckle of his belt.
That earned him a smoldering silence, but Malfoy obediently followed him to the spot he’d indicated.
He didn’t have much time to pout about that though—Charlie was already tapping Draco’s waist, signaling him to take the proper floor position again. He snapped into it blushingly fast--arms back, knees wide, bollocks ready for handling--revealing more training than he could bear for Potter to see. He couldn’t help it though. Charlie had drilled him hard and long on his positions, absolutely merciless when it came to hesitation or mistake. Hell,
"Hmm, well I suppose a little something is unfinished." Charlie came around to his head.
"Malfoy really has it in for you." Ron grabbed his bag with the apologetic body language of a mate who loved you, but not enough to hang around while you did paperwork. "I’m starting to wonder if we’re going to be digging your dead body out from under a mountain of casefiles one morning."
Ignorant git. That was a slapper, not a paddle. Draco felt pleasantly superior.
Charlie snorted and grabbed the beers off the table. "If you mean is that really Draco Malfoy, naked and on his knees, ready to suck you off—or anything else you want—then yes. It is." He pressed a bottle into Harry’s hand, some dreadful Muggle ‘light’ ale, which as far as Draco was concerned was an absolute falsehood. The stuff didn’t even glow.
"Sometimes." Draco’s cock was paying attention now, starting to move underneath the shift.
"Can I touch you?" Harry asked, not tentative at all. Just looking for information.
Charlie
"What about—" Potter’s voice grew a little husky, "er, punishments. How does that work?"
"We already tried it—"
Draco had relaxed slowly as they talked until now they were completely pressed together, chest and arse and tangled legs. Harry tweaked a nipple gently, twisting it through the fine silk, watching Draco catch his breath.
If Draco had been allowed to touch his own cock he would have grabbed it and shook it at him. "I’m not selling buttons on the street, Potter," he said, trying not to whine. "What do you think I want?"
Charlie nodded. "Actually, the coming out part might overshadow the Malfoy part. Could be the best possible timing if you want him, doing them both at once. If I wanted to sell, that is."
Draco trembled inside. There were some things in the drawer that he loved and some things that he hated. He wasn’t sure which he’d rather Potter found out about. It was so raw, having his dirty little needs laid out on a table and talked about, over his head no less. Protesting would only make it worse, though, so he crawled as fast as he could to the drawer and started bringing everything over. Clamps and clips and tight-bundled ropes he carried in his hands, as taught, awkwardly crabwalking on his knees. Paddles and canes and whips he brought one at a time in his mouth, as required, careful to keep his teeth from marking them, laying them out on the table as instructed.
"Well, come on then. What’s the signal for kneeling? I want you down on that rug while I clean your mouth."
"I’m off to sleep, then," Charlie added, "benefits wear me out something fierce, don’t you know." Then he scooted to the far side of the bed, ignoring Malfoy’s look of horror, and patted the bed between them. "Come on then, Harry. We’ll keep you warm between us. Safe from doxies too."
"What if there’s something he needs that you can’t manage and can’t bring in anyone else for? What if he needs to move on?"
Charlie relaxed on the sofa, taking his lager and putting Draco back into a formal kneel after Harry’d gotten his too.
"Harry!" A familiar voice came from behind him. "I’m surprised to see you here."
Potter was grunting and moaning too as he rutted—more grunts on the in-thrust, more moans as he pulled out. He rubbed the head in and out of Draco’s arsehole, indulging that sensitive spot on the underside of his prick, then thrusting in for maximum pleasure. Each thrust pushed Draco’s cock through the oil and he let himself sink wantonly into that pleasure, shamelessly rubbing himself off on the whipping block.
Potter nodded. “Beyond that, I don’t want to talk about it. Can you accept that as the answer, Malfoy? Or is it still going to distract you?”
, his twisted, messed up brain thought.
“You’re kidding.”
“Er,” Ron said finally, looking at the bedsheets. “Thanks, Malfoy.”
“Here…” Draco said slowly. “In Wiltshire?” He knew what Potter meant; he wasn’t stupid.
Longing.
“Maybe you’re right,” he said reluctantly. “We don’t want to rush this.”
“I know.” Her voice broke a little. “He won’t do it again.”
“No, Malfoy. But I carried your wand for a while, remember?”
“Peacock feathers?” he queried, stomping around the kitchen island and towards the increasingly wrong-footed-looking man in his living room. “That’s what you’re after? Or are you requesting that I climb a tree for you and obtain a nice array of raven plumes to match that stupid hair?” Something occurred to him in the middle of his rant. “Are you honestly telling me you’ve been here for thirty minutes because you couldn’t get my front gate to open? You are a
“You know,” he says carefully, tucking the suitcases into his jacket pocket. “Just because your life lacks privacy, it doesn’t mean you can’t have a little fun with it.”
“Don’t. Ask,” Draco reiterated, doing his best not to recall the sheer panic with which he had survived those first few months with his new flock.
“I don’t know think you even know you’re doing it,” she continued, her voice growing soft with concern. “I’ve seen that look on you before. I
“I’m not worried,” Draco insisted. “It’s harmless.”
“Are you purchasing supplies to break the hellfire curse?” she asked, taking down a bottle of powdered mushroom and setting it in the basket on her elbow.
Ron turned to see what had caught his attention. “Oh, come off it. I know you feel guilty and you’re trying to become mates or some bloody rot, but you don’t have to be with him all the time.”
“Merlin, Harry,” Draco whispered, grabbing his arm and pointing to a bush off the side of the path. “I think we’ve found them. I thought it would take days!”
The memory of Hermione’s voice pops into his head, running through her checklist before he left.
messed up. I don’t know how it ties into this ridiculous bet—or even if it does at all—but all I know is that Potter is happiest when he’s with me. He’s happiest when we’re making stupid plans and trying to trick our friends. It’s like it gives him… purpose, I don’t know. Sometimes I wonder if it takes him back to Hogwarts, to the kind of pranks the Weasley twins would play. Like, maybe because it’s so light-hearted, he can shove all the rest of it aside. But I don’t know, Blaise. I just don’t know.”
His head rolled sideways, and he found Potter already looking at him. It occurred to Draco that he was the least appropriate person to be sharing this moment with the golden child of Gryffindor, but as he took in the tired lines of Potter’s face and the overwhelming sense of loneliness that drifted from him in waves, he realised that he was the only one Potter would have allowed. Because Draco was lost, floating completely and utterly adrift from everything he had ever known or believed in.
“When I started this,” Draco said slowly. “I thought I knew what needed to be fixed, and once it was fixed, I’d be fine. But I now feel like it’s changing who I am. I can deal with those memories now. I don’t feel so haunted. But I keep coming here.” He laughed. “I
He closed his own and tried to turn the fear into confusion. Into doubt.
The curse was Draco’s.
His hands fluttered to his jacket pocket and then down again. Draco felt the slow rise of anticipation spreading like warmth through him.
Then, he felt the tug of the potion, warning him their dream was coming to an end.
He set the comb down a little harder than necessary and squeezed out a dollop of lotion for his face. The steady glide of his fingers against his skin was a soothing distraction. He could close his eyes and focus on the faint scent of citrus, feel the warmth of the heated lamp above the mirror, pretend everything was fine.
The slapper fell again and again, alternating cheeks, placement shifting slightly each time, smacking across the top, then starting in below and following the same. Charlie believed in a nice uniform beating. There wouldn’t be a single inch of his arse and upper thighs that wasn’t blazing red by the time he finished. And that was just this one implement. Charlie never stopped with one and tonight of all nights he’d want to show off all his toys, let Potter see which ones made him squeal and which ones made his cock leak and which ones made him cry and beg for mercy.
Harry let his head fall back. His mouth fell open and a helpless groan emerged. He grabbed Draco’s hair and pulled him off. "Fecking hell, better stop. It’s too good."
Harry eyed the bed and bit his lip. Probably not good manners to return your host’s slave covered in sweat and come. There was only so much a cleaning charm could do, too. He reached up and touched the chain where it met the bedpost. "Come on. I need to wash you up."
"Actually," Charlie said with amusement in his voice. "We are. A lot."
Harry rubbed a finger across the slit, watched Draco bite his lip, then pumped faster, harder. Draco’s body tensed beneath him and his eyes flew open at last.
Oh bloody hell, no. Draco dearly wanted to shift in position, stamp his foot, something. Charlie headed back to the drawer with the pleasure of a man who’d found someone who could really appreciate the tools of the trade. Draco knew what was coming and he hated this one.
"Oh, he’s good at it all right." Charlie bit back a groan at a particularly good tongue motion. "Doesn’t favor it, but he can give any kind of fucking you like. What if he did favor it, is what I’m asking? What if he needs something you don’t like?"
No. Harry had more soap and he started rubbing a new blasted swab all along the bottom row of his teeth, left to right, going back for more whenever the layer even slightly thinned. Gums too, then the top, left to right, and the inside as well as the outside, top and bottom.
"Best to have it proven, don’t you think? Since it’s a formal offer you’re making." Now Charlie was really enjoying this. He tapped Draco on the back of the head. "Go on, pet. Give him a suck. Let’s see what it does to you."
Then Potter must have moved because Charlie’s hand came down on his arse with a smack that for anyone else would be as hard as they hit, and for him was just a friendly hello. "Ready, pet?"
"A good friend wouldn’t push his way into their bed while pretending he hadn’t treated
Malfoy poked at a scorch mark on Harry’s sleeve. "Or wait, this has to do with dragons, right? You’re Exhibit A in the importance of wearing proper protective gear?"
Malfoy didn’t wait for an answer. He turned with a billow worthy of Snape himself and exited, leaving nothing behind but the case files and the faint clean scent of lavender soap.
Malfoy was rigid next to him, radiating irritation, or possibly the desire to strangle Harry with his chain. Harry grinned to himself in the darkness anyway as he waited for Charlie’s breaths to ease into the rhythm of sleep. Somehow he’d managed it. A week of being cold-shouldered, insulted, and ruthlessly paperworked and here he was, in bed beside the twat with a chance to set things straight.
"We can talk here," Harry said, flicking his eyes to the people around them, "or we can talk somewhere more private. Your choice."
He came. Words turned into a pure wail as the shock speared into him, seemingly centered in the slit of his cock. His legs gave way and he dropped them both to the floor, Harry still speared within him.
"There’s no way Malfoy is into this." Harry gestured toward him, taking Draco in from his submissively bowed head to his bare-assed bum. "Him? A slave? No way."
Draco sputtered, trying hard not to move his head. It tasted terrible. Worse than the shoe, in fact. He kept his tongue out with an effort and Harry dipped the swab back in the soap, pulling it out with a fat blob on the end.
Harry opened the folder, keeping the cover raised to hide the paper within from Ron.
Harry took a step back. Metaphorically, of course. ‘Cause he was lying down. "Malf—Draco--"
being ashamed of what he wanted. Instead he was going to do it. Tonight.
"Yeah, he likes that one." Charlie reached out and grabbed it, then hauled Draco over his knee, arse up, legs wide and braced. He scooted along, moving them both until there was room for Draco to bury his face in the sofa cushions. "Really makes him wiggle, this one."
"I know there’s a clause in there that he can only be sold to someone he’s attracted to, but I think I fit the bill on that." Harry took a nervous swallow of his lager. "That sounds immodest, I know, but I don’t think he could honestly deny it."
He could feel Potter’s nod, transmitted through hands and cock, and the pressure returned. Draco spread his legs as far as his bonds would let him and felt his arsehole twitch under the weight of Potter’s cock. The push was every bit as slow and steady as Charlie had requested and his arsehole first resisted, twinging against the invader. He groaned, deep and heartfelt, as he was opened further and further, stretched by Potter’s cock. It was fucking big around, the sod hadn’t lied, and Draco struggled, trying to let him in.
Soon they were back in the living room. Not right away, of course. Harry, bastard that he was, had decided he couldn’t take Draco back with a come-filled mouth after he’d promised to clean him out. So he’d gotten a fizzy little soap ball, stood Draco over the sink, and popped it into his mouth. Then he gave him glass after glass of water, making him swish until it foamed, then spit it out and do it again. Time after time until the fucking little ball was gone. Then Harry had washed Draco’s face, cleaning off the tear tracks, and washed the spit and soap from the rest of his body too, with almost reverent hands.
Charlie shrugged. "Just being a good host. What’s mine is yours and all that. While you’re here, that is."
His arsehole rippled further open and he gave a strangled cry.  Bollocks nudged against his arse, warm even against the heat of his abused flesh.
"Shush," Potter said, with a final swipe across Draco’s bollocks. "Not going to hurt you."
Harry rewarded him with a quick kiss to the back of the neck. "Good boy," he said, staying there, draped across Draco’s body. "That’s right, that’s what I always want you to call me. Now open up your legs. I’m going to fuck you."
"Yeah? Not even the thought of taking Draco’s cock and balls away? Making him take it up the twat like a proper bird? That wouldn’t give you a thrill?"
"Fuck," Potter breathed, loosing a whiff of mint across Draco’s face.
He led the way to the loo as slowly, then opened the door and brought Draco inside, settling him into the hosing area and clipping the leash to a handy ring. Low rails kept Draco’s kneeling legs apart, wide enough to make to pull his cheeks apart too.  Harry caught a sight of the silk still stuffed inside his hole, and almost blushed. Part of him still wanted to apologize, no matter how satisfied Draco looked. The other part just wanted to do it again.
Draco leaned into him, his body opening for Harry’s exploration. "Charlie decides. One week if he knows I didn’t mean to. One month if I did."
A hard blow caught Draco right across the back of his thighs, dragging him back into the moment. The next one cracked before he could catch his breath and he cried out, head jerking back. The pace was picking up, Charlie expertly driving him into a frenzy, knowing the precise speed to turn his world into nothing but pain and reaction. Another blow, this one licking around the curve of one leg, nearly enough to catch the bottom of his bollocks. He clawed forward, crying out and a mouth met his. A hot tongue pushed past his lips.
"Now for the teeth." Harry had taken the nasal swab away but the relief of that was short-lived.
Harry licked up, closed his mouth over the head, waited a moment, then sucked Draco down. Draco’s back arched and he squealed,
Draco made a noise as Harry raised the nozzle.
Shock zinged through Draco. He stiffened for all the wrong reasons. Potter hadn’t liked it? Shame followed hot on the heels of shock but it wasn’t the good, arousing kind of shame. It had the ashy taste of failure, the grit of a cigarette you smoked to make up for the crap sex that you’d gotten. He’d given himself over to Potter tonight and the Chosen One had said,
The pressure stopped. "It’s just I thought, you know, that I had to work it in bit by bit."
Charlie sighed and watched Harry sag against the wall. The Boy Who Lived To Be Completely Incompetent At Relationships had done it again. How he could drive away Draco--who was quite literally gagging for Harry’s cock—was a mystery.
Draco groaned and shuddered as Harry’s cock pushed a little soap down his throat. It hit the back of his throat erratically, making him gag, making his throat spasm around the invader. It didn’t take long ‘til he was back to sobbing, feeling overwhelmed, feeling used, feeling like the slightest touch on his cock would set off a release he wasn’t permitted. That feeling grew as Harry moaned and stilled, forcing himself, slippery and bitter and lavender-scented, deep into Draco’s throat.
Of course the Chosen One was good with wandless magic, Draco thought sullenly. Wasn’t the Chosen One good at everything? And now the Chosen One had Draco’s bollocks quite literally in a clamp and was going to spend the rest of the evening teaching him to obey. His life officially sucked he assured his cock, which defiantly refused to agree. It was loving this, sick little organ that it was.
Potter intercepted them, making them swerve and come to him, landing in his arms in a snowy pile. Show-off. A wave of the wand and Draco was wrapped and mobilicorpsed across the room. Potter landed him so softly his arse didn’t even protest—well no more than it already was—and set things up next to the armchair.
"There’s nothing to say." Malfoy shrugged one elegant shoulder.
Harry held Draco’s head still and thrust up into it, one, two, three times fast. Draco on his knees, eating out of Harry’s hand—as images went, that clearly worked for him.
"Any way you like," Draco answered, "and anywhere. I’m sure Charlie told you that." There were contractual limits of course, bans on ridiculously extreme things like mutilation, non-negotiated permanent marks—Draco had a particular sensitivity to that, no need to ask why—and various other things, but that wasn’t what Harry was checking on. "If you mean, can you throw me over the counter and arse fuck me dry, then of course."
"One long slide in too, if you don’t mind." Charlie added.
Finally, he stopped. Draco was so hard he could have cried. His cock ached with the need to come and his bollocks felt huge and swollen and badly-used. Potter’s cock softened and he pulled out with a happy sigh, then fingered the hole, pushing it open so even more come could leak out and trickle down Draco’s leg.
Harry finished the paperwork with a flourish and charmed it to the barrister’s branch of the Ministry. Then he was off to the floo as fast as he could while still maintaining a modicum of dignity. Or at least not so fast he’d spook the janitors. Of all the nights to be kept late, he griped to himself—he’d been looking forward to this for, well,
"All right?" Harry rubbed a hand down Draco’s side.
"Good questions." Charlie dropped to the other end of the sofa and snapped his fingers. "To me, pet."
Harry swallowed. "Is it too many already? That’s rather where the, er, anger might have come in?" He put a tentative hand on Draco’s flank. "Can I hold you while I talk?"
"Do you want me to do that?’ Harry moved even closer, still holding the lead carefully, but close enough now to just barely touch.
obeyed the damn man. It wasn’t his fault if his body listened too.
"Here you go," Charlie said, handing the end of the long leather strap to Potter. "He’ll be nice and docile with his leash on."
"Sure," Charlie said, pushing him over hard enough that he practically fell face first into Harry’s quickly unzipped lap.
"Well, if you’re not going to reward him," Charlie said finally, "you need to ice his cock down. His prick’s been up for a good long time now and it needs to rest." A flick of the wand and flannels soared their way, followed by a basin which filled itself with cold water.
Harry gaped. "What am I, Cinderella? Do you want me to scrub the floors and clean the floo and sew my own clothes too before I can go to the ball?"
even as Potter’s tongue twisted around his, sucking in his cries.
That was Potter’s voice and that must be Potter’s fingers, now easing underneath him and moving Draco’s cock into a more comfortable position. A tingle of transfiguration followed and the block beneath his cock became a little plusher and a little slick with oil, perfect for rubbing against.
Potter flicked furiously through the pages, his quill jumping to his hand. He started scribbling, not even bothering to watch Draco’s retreating arse.
Harry wrapped his hand around the back of Draco’s neck. Draco at once raised his head and wrapped his lips around the bell-end of Harry’s cock, laving the tip. Then he sucked it all the way down ending with his nose in Harry’s curls. His throat convulsed, massaging the cock buried deep in it.
Potter dropped down in front of him, speaking softly and just for him. "Can you do this? Is it too much?"
"Paperwork? At five o’clock on a Friday?" Abbott shook her head, standing up to go. "What do they want documented this time? That dragons are still large, eat meat, and need a lot of it?"
Harry repeated that to himself three times then gestured to a quiet corner where they could talk. "I trust you know how to follow?"
He opened Harry’s flies with his teeth—show-off!—and pulled his pants down with his teeth too, smoothing the rapidly filling cock with his cheek as he did it. Then he pressed his lips lightly to Harry’s bollocks, waiting.
Then Harry had finished but he didn’t take his cock out, not immediately. He ruffled Draco’s hair instead and watched as Draco sucked in panting breaths through his aching nose.
At least he didn’t have to worry about his own breath, Draco thought. His mouth would smell of soap and lavender forever.
Malfoy was being the perfect slave. Ostentatiously, aggressively perfect. Bringing Charlie his slippers, kissing his feet before easing them on. Offering oral pleasure with a gracefully bent head on Charlie’s thigh. Turning back into a perfectly postured kneeling statue every time Harry came near.
"Tap his head to release him," Charlie said. "He can give a freeform blow if you like, choosing how to suck you, but he’s got formal training. If you don’t specify, he has to suck you like a proper slave."
Draco trembled. He could do this last little bit, he told himself. He’d even like it later when he was floating on a wave of post-scene euphoria but right now fear had seized him. He hated the cane. What was Charlie playing at, to bring it out now?
"Up on the table, pet," Charlie ordered. "Let the gentleman have a good look at you. See what he thinks you’re worth."
Ahhh, fuck. Those words, that tone. Draco’s hips snapped forward involuntarily, rubbing his cock into the floor. He wanted to—no he didn’t, he couldn’t—
There was a strong mulish stubbornness to Harry’s jaw at the thought of Draco moving on to someone else. Interesting. But also good, given that he thought this might be the capital L, permanent kind of love they were both feeling. Still, it was important for Harry to think about. Anyway, he thought with a bit of meanness that made him buck up into Draco’s throat and drag himself across that talented palette, wasn’t that what Charlie was doing right now? Giving Draco up because the right person had come along?
Harry took it with a gleam in his eye, examining it closely. "Is it for the nipple?"
"Fine," Malfoy said with very poor grace. "Drag me off to whatever corner is reserved for your sort. I should probably make sure they’re treating the riff-raff kindly."
drawer—and pulled something out. "Yeah," he said as he turned and came back. "He was thin but soft when I got him. I put him on a strict exercise regime. He bitches and moans like I’m gutting him with dull shears each time I work him out, but I like the results."
"Oh no," came a teasing voice at his shoulder, following his line of sight, "seems the course of true love has slammed into a wall again. Thought you were an expert at getting your pets settled with the right owners?"
like shite last time he was there."
Harry laughed and reached a hand around, giving Draco a solid tug, feeling the pre-come wetness spreading on the silk. "Nope, none of those were the right names. Keep trying or I’ll keep pumping."
Draco’s mouth went dry. He fucking loved the belt. Charlie unbuckled as casually as if he were alone, then oh so slowly drew the thick belt out, loop by loop. The rich scent of leather hit him, wrapping him in the promise of pain and pleasure and the sweet release that submission always brought.
Actually, Draco knew because Charlie had told him, and Charlie knew because it was his sister the four-eyed git had been boffing. Still, if Potter wanted to think Draco was a god of gossip, he didn’t mind. Kept people on their toes if they thought you knew everything.
"Reward him?" The daft bugger looked confused.
"I think it would be nice to top alone too," Potter said, not looking up. He rubbed a little harder at one spot until Draco gave an
Draco grimaced. "It stops me from getting that far usually. Pre-come makes the shocks start, just little ones, tingling, then stronger and stronger if I keep leaking. Wakes me up before I can come."
"It’s not for you." Oh, the pleasures the kid was going to experience. "It’s for Draco. Think about it: you’re in the tub, your boy’s head is underwater, he doesn’t need to breathe--your cock can be down his throat for a whole hour if you like."
out. A trace of moonlight came through the window, providing a low silver glow. Just enough to see Malfoy out of the corner of his eye.
"Master, then?" Draco’s voice was getting babbly with nerves. Fingering his arse probably made him leak even more than a suck.
The first blow came down on his left arse cheek, the leather cracking together as the doubled-length met flesh. Heat flared, almost stronger than the sudden pain that made him cry out. A blow to the other cheek and it was on in earnest, Charlie striping his arse with practiced thoroughness, left to right and back again, top to bottom and all the way down onto his thighs. He rocked, driven forward with the force of each blow, hard and fast enough that his bollocks were pulled up to the ring, stretched, an agony added just as the intense pain of leather meeting skin had faded.
"I’ve charmed it to release at your command too." He smacked Malfoy on the rump. "Just in case you need to take this one to the loo or something. He’s not allowed to wander off by himself of course but you’re welcome to take him off leash if you like."
Draco sputtered and swallowed. By the time he’d gotten his breath back, his bonds were off and Charlie was taking him down, flipping him over and onto a cover laid out on the floor. He winced as his backside rubbed against it but he couldn’t spare a thought for that. Nothing existed now but the throbbing of his bollocks and his rock-hard cock. Which could use a little relief.
He wouldn’t—
That had been the good part of breaking up with Ginny. He’d managed to eek out to her a tiny fraction of an admission about the things he really wanted. She’d been great in the end, really the best ex he could have hoped for. After all, she’d told him exactly who he needed to talk to about this. Someone who already had what Harry wanted. Someone experienced, who was relaxed and willing to show Harry the ropes, even share his sub for the night.
Of course, it might have been a little harder on Draco. He’d spent the week in a cock cage, after all. Harry had been free to go home after each negotiating session and wank himself into oblivion.
"You like to get fucked?" Charlie asked, settling into the pleasant rhythm on his cock. He raised an eyebrow at Harry.
Interesting, he thought as he unrolled the parchment and read. It wasn’t paperwork at all. Well, not official paperwork anyway. It was a formal request from Harry to meet to discuss a potential business transaction. Charlie grinned. Finally. He’d almost started to think Harry had lost his nerve. Good for him for taking a week to think about it, though.
From this position he could see Charlie, who had banished all the toys back to the drawer and turned the whipping block back into the far-more-socially-acceptable shape of a coffee table. He ignored Draco’s pleading what-about-my-cock looks and lounged on the sofa, beer in hand. "Not bad, having a second top around. Don’t have to do anything but kick back afterwards."
"Oh," comprehension dawned. A true win for higher brain functions. "Shouldn’t we, er, clean him up a little first?"
Charlie shrugged. "If you like." He flicked his wand and
He groaned and got to work.
"No," Draco said, with the honesty that Charlie had lovingly beaten into him. "I hate being fucked dry."
"Yeah," Charlie said, "if it’s done right." His hand rested gently on the back of Draco’s neck, a subtle reminder that he wasn’t to pull back until the signal came. Draco sucked in breath through his nose, starting to pant. "You want to see?"
"Fine, yes," Harry babbled. "I know what you’re doing and I don’t care. You’ve got a deal. I’m buying him."
Draco moaned, cried
"Sirius not with you?"
"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, get out before the shocks—" Draco’s arse spasmed. The first little tingling shocks must be starting there too. "I figured out what you want to be called. So stop."
Draco’s eyes watered. He gagged and bucked. The nose clamp pulled tight as his head came forward and he sobbed aloud, pulling his tongue in. A bubble escaped from his open mouth, floating by eyes so watery the world wavered. "I’m sorry." Draco hated failing. "I couldn’t keep my tongue out."
Then he fucking started on the inside of Draco’s cheeks, more fucking soap, overwhelming his senses, taste and smell both, making him feel like he’d fallen mouth-first into some strange lavender-foam world. When the bubbles grew too thick, Harry made him open his mouth and drool them out, soapy ropes that twisted down his chin and dripped to his chest and stomach. Then the palate at the top, another fine layer that clung in such a way that very little went down his throat, thank goodness, but made his mouth feel alien and thick.
"Can’t come in it," Draco said in a low voice, embarrassment creeping in. "I can get hard but if come gets on it, it shocks me. Hard. It’s to keep me from, you know, wanking. After Charlie goes to sleep."
"Good," Harry said. He slithered over Draco, relishing the feel of his lean body, allowing his hips a gratuitous shove against the cock underneath him. "I like to get absolution for the first unforgiveable thing before I do the next one."
"It’s too much, you’re fucking huge, I can’t take it, not with the shocks," Draco tensed and he dropped to his elbows, arse still up, forehead rolling against the rug. "I can’t—oh fuck—I’m going to—"
"It’s just a week, pet," Harry whispered in Draco’s ear. "That’s not too long, is it? You can do it for me?"
Thank Merlin Charlie’d come over at the ball to clink a glass. Before Harry could stop himself, he’d been babbling out,
"Oi! Here’s Malfoy with your Friday night paperwork," Ron said, rolling his eyes at Harry. "Honestly mate, you’ve got no one to blame but yourself. You should’ve been firm with him right from the beginning. Give a git like that an inch and he’ll take a mile."
"So get one," Charlie said with the kind of eye-crinkling smile that said he might have been talking about the clip and he might have been talking about the slave.
"What are you doing here? How dare you invite yourself over and get into my bed?"
Indignation flared through Draco. He’d hated every minute of it. It wasn’t his fault his insane cock disagreed. And now there they were, laughing at him, and Harry would always be able to picture him teary-eyed and spitting soap. And Merlin, they weren’t even done. He could barely look Harry in the eye now. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like by morning, when they’d really put him through his paces.
"Thought? Past tense?" Harry slipped sideways, pulling Draco down. "Am I forgiven then?"
Draco eyed the bottle in Harry’s hand dubiously but opened as ordered, putting his tongue out as far as he could. Maybe Harry would be so impressed with his lingual extension that they’d move straight on to blow jobs and forget whatever awful thing he currently had planned.
"On something which is none of your business." Malfoy’s ears were turning pink.
"Nice," Potter was saying. "I like it. Is there anything else you ever use?"
"Why? He just likes the way it looks? Doesn’t want you stripping in the middle of the night?" Harry couldn’t quite figure it out.
Draco would have agreed, if he could have made more than a squeaky eep.
That would only make Charlie roar with laughter, though, and probably double the number of slapper smacks. Which, he’d also like to point out, he didn’t really like. It hurt. The fact that the sensation also went straight to his cock and made him beg and plead to come was neither here nor there.
Green eyes stared into his, mouth gaping unattractively. "But he’s, you know, so competent. In control. I see him at work all the time."
"As for needs, I find it’s crucial to know what drives the submissive. For myself, I’ve got broad tastes. I can find something that excites me with most subs. If I have one thing I love most, though, it’s slave training." Charlie’s hand rested on Draco’s shoulder, warm and comforting. "I like working them hard and having an ongoing relationship, especially with a smart and challenging boy like this."
Draco almost laughed. Beautiful? With suds still dripping down his chin? And probably come too?
"I like it too," Potter admitted, with a smile that went right past Draco and straight to Charlie. They were fucking bonding over making him suck on Potter’s shoe. Arseholes, both of them.
Charlie timed it carefully. He snapped his fingers. Draco obeyed instantly, pulling off with a pop, sides heaving. Harry’s head shot up and he looked suddenly bereft.
Charlie reached out and ruffled Draco’s hair, feeling for—yes, there’d been a sudden sharp buzz in Draco’s magic, and he was leaning toward Harry as much as his position would permit. Good.
coming high and fast. Harry could almost taste the little shocks on his tongue, faintly metallic, as Draco struggled beneath him.
"It would," Draco admitted, feeling that he should be able to hold still himself—he was well-trained, dammit, but knowing he needed it. He couldn’t take another jolt to the nose.
Harry grinned. "There’s
Draco sputtered and jerked up. Harry laughed hard and pushed him back down. "Just kidding. I’m pants at dancing and I’m staying that way. What I like the sound of is, er," he went a little red, "hand-feeding."
He watched Draco lick his lips, clearly mustering some kind of argument for why Charlie should immediately reveal who was coming. Not surprising he wound up a barrister—the boy was born to argue. Out of punishments and into punishments too depending on what he wanted. He practically defined pushy bottom.
Harry ran a hand through his hair but he looked pleased. "He doesn’t lack for reasons to get his backside tanned, does he?"
Harry shushed him with a stroke of the hand and went on. "I’d wanted that forever. In general, I mean, that kind of sex," breathe, he told himself, "but to be really honest I especially wanted it with you. I was kind of obsessed with you for a long time, you know."
Charlie laughed and kissed him. "So a good time was had by all, I see. Glad to hear it. You’re not done, of course, not close to it. We’re going to ride your arse harder than you’ve ever had it and if you don’t satisfy, I’ll put you outside the door with a sign telling the neighbors to fuck you too. How does that sound for a plan?" he asked, turning to Harry.
"On what?"
Panic gripped him again, just as it had when Potter had first arrived. He knew what Charlie could do to him. He’d done it before, time and again, methodically reducing Draco to a sniveling, shivering slave, pathetically eager to please. Willing to say anything, do anything to make Charlie happy. Not broken—revealed. That was what he couldn’t stand for Potter to see. Not that Charlie could force him to act the slave, but that Draco wouldn’t be able to hide that he loved it.
Still, you had to push them out of the nest sometime. Or out of the frying pan into the fire, as the case may be: Harry was no pushover when it came to tops. Draco’s arse would stay nicely reddened and his hole well-plowed with Harry in charge.
"Please—let me—Harry--may I--"
Harry rolled his eyes. "Of course I would. If you think I’m too fucking noble to protect my boyfriend from dirty politics, you’re wrong. I know there are times the Ministry is caught with its pants down and I know they like to yell,
A flicker passed across Malfoy’s face. "Why? I have no idea what your motivation is, you realize that? Last week evidently wasn’t to your liking. Fine. There’s no need to debrief me."
Draco shivered. That first order was always hard for him if Charlie had company over. He stood and if that was a break in training—for such a short distance he should have crawled—Charlie was willing to forgive it. Especially given how gracefully he sank to his knees in front of Harry.
Harry twitched. "Er, a pet, yes. Well, something like a pet. I wasn’t thinking about a dragon of any size though." He sat up straight, nerve clearly screwed to the sticking point and added, "Draco, I mean. I want to buy your slave.
Charlie seemed amused. His fingers twisted in Draco’s hair, hard enough to hurt, just the way he liked. "Wanting to submit sexually doesn’t mean you’re a pushover in the rest of your life. Draco is a fine barrister and he’s
Draco tried, he really did, but he was begging again within a moment, asking for mercy, for just a little fucking time to adjust to the monster being shoved up his arse.
At a snap of Charlie’s fingers, Draco eased into the space between his legs, as trained, then looked up, waiting for the nod. When he got it, he undid Charlie’s jeans and pulled his pants down, setting his hard cock free.
Harry willed his cock to stop twitching. Ever since last week, the scent of lavender had done terrible things to him.
"Let you what?" Comprehension hit him a moment later. "You mean you’ve been an arse to me all week because I wouldn’t let you come?" Miffedness poured into him. He’d had to do hours of paperwork tonight because Malfoy hadn’t gotten his knob off?
"How nice to see you dressed properly for an event," Malfoy started in at once, looking at Harry’s Auror robes. "You look like you’re here to arrest someone."
"Sorry," Harry said, rubbing Draco’s back and not even trying not to smile. "You’re still so fucking tight, even with all the pounding you get. I can’t help leaking, not when I’ve got you to ride."
Charlie sighed as Draco took him deep and worked his cock just the way he liked. Damn, he’d put so much work into the boy. It really would give him a pang to give Draco up, even if he did take on Remus and Sirius’s little project.
There it was. Draco’s contract. A wave of emotion swept through him, relief and joy and intense anticipation and maybe more than anything, a feeling of rightness.
Charlie’s hand soothed him, rubbing small circles on his back even as it held him down. He always did know what Draco needed. He felt his panting ease, felt the sharp edge of panic recede. He could just stay here, face down, not moving. Eventually Potter would go away, right?
Not the fucking tongue again, he thought, though he supposed they might as well make good use of it now that he was literally squeaky clean.
Fred ran a satisfied hand down his Chinese Fireball red lapels. "Shows we’re invested in the continuation of the species. Anyway, we gave a truly massive check. Could’ve come nude and danced on Fudge’s table for the amount we lashed out, right George?"
"Even Ron noticed. And trust me, if he picks up on something, you might as well shout it through a
"Merlin, you’re so beautiful like this," Harry said.
"Good," Draco agreed, looking absolutely boneless. Thoroughly debauched, really, in that pale, tousled way that only the natural aristocrat can manage.
"Would you protect him?" Charlie asked next, tipping his head. This was an important question too and one he wasn’t sure of. "If the Ministry comes calling, will you step in?"
Harry looked around the ballroom, wincing a little at the glare off the crystal chandeliers. He wished he’d had time to change out of his Auror robes. Somehow he’d pictured a dragon benefit as being a little less fancy than this. Not that the dragons were going to be here, of course, but still.
Harry eyed the white shift, now quite plastered to Draco’s form. Might as well clean that too. He reached for the nozzle and tested the water until it was warm enough to redden. He wanted to see that, to watch Draco’s skin change color, lose its pallor as he scrubbed. He moved in behind Draco, kneeling too, taking the same position they’d fucked in.
"I wasn’t aware I needed permission of any kind from you." Harry snapped back. "And all I really want is enough time to get out two, maybe three whole sentences without you biting my head off and running away."
Draco’s head fell back on Harry’s shoulder.  His lips were working, his tongue flickering out, wordless pleas falling from his mouth. Harry stroked Draco’s neck with one hand and worked his cock with the other, slow and steady strokes, each with a twist at the top.
Charlie doubled it up as a little smile played across his lips. He held it out to Draco, nonchalantly accepting the required kiss, then moved behind him, out of sight. Draco tensed.
Draco sank automatically into position, kneeling on the rug, back straight, legs wide, bollocks vulnerable. Potter squatted down with him and squinted at the leash, clearly realizing after a moment that there were two separate cords to it. He pulled one back over Draco’s right cheek and one over his left, just as they were supposed to go, and fastened them to the ring at the level of the nape of Draco’s neck. There was enough give that he could move his head a little, but not anywhere near enough to stand up, or even lean forward much.
“I’m so close.” His chest was flushed a beautiful red that rose high up on his cheeks, and his hands still gripped the headboard obediently, straining against the bars.
For a moment, Draco stopped breathing, but then Potter drew his hand out again, bringing a small pendant with it and holding it up so it was gently swinging from the black cord around Potter’s neck.
He spent the day fetching Malfoy what he needed for his experiments. As the hours passed by, Malfoy became increasingly focused, poised on the edge of a breakthrough. Harry almost held his breath, entranced in the strangest way by the concept that he wasn’t the hero this time.
As they sipped, a different mood descended on the living room. The open windows brought the sound of soft scuffling as Alan, Maisie, and Turquoise—only one of whom Draco had named—scratched in the earth searching for insects. And with that sound came peace. The fragrant liquid soothed Draco’s mind, the breeze soothed his body, and even Potter seemed to relax.
Draco gave his shoulder a light push until he propped himself up on his hands and looked down.
“Yes, well,” he said, staring down into his wine glass. Abruptly, he looked up and asked the question that had been bothering him ever since this whole business began. “Why did Potter become an Unspeakable?”
that look. It’s the look I worried about for years after we left Hogwarts and started becoming friends with all the Gryffindors.” She cast him a wry glance. “It’s the look I’d finally stopped worrying about.”
Malfoy began to walk them backwards until the back of Harry’s knees hit the bed and he dropped back onto it, bringing Malfoy with him. A small gasp escaped Malfoy just before he managed to catch himself, propped up with his arms on either side of Harry’s shoulders. He looked breathless and a little giddy, which was oddly endearing.
“Why do you think you shouldn’t be here?” Malfoy asked calmly.
“Well, yeah, now you mention it,” Potter shot back, dodging the piles of dung with offensive ease. “Because then you would’ve been a danger to the rest of our mission, and probably wrecked it, and then Voldemort would still be around and we’d all be dead.”
. Then, in a deft maneuver with which he was well-practiced, he pushed the thought aside and opened the door.
Malfoy stopped midway through turning about.
“He’s having a seizure,” Potter yelled over his shoulder. “Can I still Apparate from the hallway?”
“He’s in surgery.” Potter’s words sounded almost dead. “We can’t go in until he’s out. If he makes it out.”
“I told you,” he told them.
“Was it what you were waiting for?” Harry asked before Draco had recovered himself.
I never had a cat, growing up. But my neighbour, Mrs Figg, had several. I used to hate going to her house, though I found out later that she was a Squib and the only person I had growing up who actually cared for me. Funny how life is, sometimes.
"Fuck, Draco. Fuck, fuck, you feel so good." Harry’s hands came back, one on either side of his head, steadying him, then his face was being fucked with shallow thrusts.
Ron made a sound that surely wasn’t a snicker. Just because Hermione had upgraded
Charlie gave a lazy hand wave. "Of course. Wouldn’t be much of a slave if I didn’t have the right to sell him on. Doesn’t mean I’m interested, though. Had him a long time. Put a lot of training into him."
"I know and he’s a brilliant fuck—"
No such luck. Harry took the top off the liquid soap dispenser and poured a little in a tiny cup. Then he pulled a swab out of a container marked Q-tips—another ridiculous Muggle name as there was nothing Q-ish about them. He dipped the Q-tip in the soap and before Draco could even realize what was going to happen, Harry had dragged it across the tip of his tongue.
