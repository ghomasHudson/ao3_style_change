The tension between his best friend and the other stubborn git made Ron want to crawl out of his skin, douse them with Veritaserum and ask the right questions or simply grab them and shake them, yelling “fucking admit that you guys fancy each other!” At this point he would not mind seeing them shag on the breakfast table if only Harry stopped making himself unhappy. Not that he wanted to see Draco Malfoy’s ferrety pale cock, a decent cock would look at least a few shades darker, (Yes, Ron was very bisexual as another escapade Hermione and he had had recently with Lee Jordan had left no shadow of a doubt of) but if that paleness was Harry’s kink who was Ron to kinkshame.
The tune changed to the soft, elegant entrance of the bride, and Morag MacDougal sang the traditional song with her rich alto voice.
The crowd cheered. Draco was not sure if a Muggle crowd would receive their drag performance as well as the mostly young wix at the Blaise’s. There were so many brilliant Drag Queens in Muggle London, and Draco didn’t really see themself in their league. But Draco had been the one to bring Drag to the wizarding world. And their programme was made for this crowd.
When he stepped on the castle and the air around him glittered with an unknown charm, he knew they had pranked him.
Another perk was that they promised to send daily reports to his spellphone. It sounded good.
“Y-yes. I’ll at least give it a try and see if the cat and I like to live together.” Luna hugged him, thanked him and disappeared through the Floo to bring the cat and all the things needed to look after them.
Please, if it is somehow possible, visit me as soon as possible and spend a few days here; I won’t accept his courtship if you don’t get along with him.
There was a moment of hesitation until a voice spoke from behind the door.
“So, what could be your name? Luna said you never accepted any of the names the Quibbler employees would give you. You seem quite posh with your blond hair and your attitude. I think I’ll call you Meowfoy. Because you remind me of a very posh, very attractive-looking classmate from my school days. I hope you’re not such a git as he always was.”
“My father used to say this is the only thing that can control my unruly hair.” Draco looked down. His father had often made him feel like his looks were barely acceptable for a Malfoy.
Draco knew nothing about Namreifs, he had never heard of them before, but Prongs was amazing. If only he himself wasn’t Draco Malfoy! Prongs deserved something better than a Death Eater. But Draco couldn’t break the contact. He needed to continue writing to Prongs. Even though it was selfish and depraved. But seeing each other in person was out of the question.
She had decorated everything with Happy Birthday streamers, and there was a cake in the purple, white and green of the genderqueer flag, as well as candles on top.  When Draco counted, and thought back, they gasped. The day was the anniversary of the verdict of their trial, sentenced to a four year probation with the condition of them completing an intensive Muggle studies course. Harry, Luna and Ginny had decided to throw a second birthday for them every year from then on, as it had been the day the Draco who could be themself had been born.
Draco sighed. “Let’s get it over with. And then we should reward ourselves for being brave. I think this morning I would even like to…” Draco didn’t need to say it out loud. They rarely felt comfortable with topping, but today they did.  Also, they still felt oversensitive and knew that they would not enjoy bottoming at this moment in time.
“Malfoy?”
“You’re so beautiful. Can I see more of you?”
After bringing Pawter to Potter and having breakfast with the Golden Boy, Draco collapsed on his sofa with a sigh. He felt exhausted and fed up with having to pretend everything was alright. But he couldn’t bother other people  like that, most of all not Potter. All those things were his own problems. Not that there was nobody  he could talk about it to, Pansy and Blaise had heard enough of it already and Luna would just advise him to find a better place to live, but he had to stay in the Manor, what about his family legacy, what about saving his family’s reputation?
Why had Luna forced this correspondence on him with her big eyes and her talk of imaginary creatures? Fuck it! It wasn’t that Luna had really forced him, he could have said no, only that he was completely incapable of turning down anything Luna would ever suggest. Luna was the daughter of his father’s disowned nonbinary sibling who had been brave enough to take their wife’s name at the wedding.
“That means, you risked your life to save their lives.” Karamo piled colourful Legos on the pan with his left hand, while still holding Draco’s hand in his right hand.
Your eyes like silver shining on me
“They talked about their feelings? When they were here with their cats, I was sceptical about your pet project, but Nippy convinced me that there was sexual tension between them.” Mick grinned and took a sip from their wine.
It was still not public knowledge, that Draco was gay. His mother knew, and she had smiled at him when he had told her and just said: “I guessed it ever since you kept coming home and all you ever talked about was Mr Potter.” Luna knew and had persuaded him to write to Prongs, who, as she insisted was perfect for him, as she planted dirigible plum trees for both of them, and the Namreifs protecting the saplings mated with each other, and Namreifs mate for life.
“You really mean he isn’t straight?” Harry asked, only now grasping that Draco’s oversharing of Astoria’s virtues was somewhat unpersonal, and rather as if the blond tried to convince himself.
“Harry, I’m so sorry. You gave me a place to stay, and then I…” Draco wanted to touch Harry’s shoulder but didn’t dare to.
are something I forever want to see,
“Draco, what happened? Are you okay?” Antoni’s voice sounded worried, as he, Karamo and the camera team came into the house.
“You’d be surprised. I cook my breakfast two days a week when my elves have their days off. Although there is no breakfast that compares to Dempy’s.” Malfoy smirked with challenge in his eyes as if he expected the breakfast to be hideous.
“Sure, but I didn’t worry much. I didn’t feel lust or attraction to anybody I didn’t feel attracted to anyways.” Potter said calmly.
“Don’t kill yourself trying to banish us, we’re no boggart.  Although my son tried the same thing. I wish I hadn’t allowed my brother-in-law, Cantankerous, to raise him after Melody’s death in childbirth. Abraxas in all likelihood would not have become a homophobe, would not have tried to kill Uther and started the feud with the Weasleys.” Achilles said softly.
When Potter’s magic had left Draco’s mind, he and Weasley exchanged a long worried look.
“Hello, Malfoy, Goyle. You want to talk to us? Follow me.” Potter gave Draco a reassuring smile, while Weasley, who stood next to him, looked at them sceptically.
“Okay, so, you tell me that Draco doesn’t love Astoria but fancies me instead. I can’t deny that I’ve been pining for him for quite some time now, but he was the one who decided that he didn’t want to date me, but marry Astoria. And I’d rather have him in my life as a friend than to lose even that. He made his choice and I have to accept it.” Harry ruffled his hair. “Whether he loves her or not, the result is the same. He doesn’t want to date me.”
The house he was put in charge of today was a kind of oddity, as his boss, Ms. McIntyre had told him. It had been empty for seven years, but showed no signs of disrepair, maybe some very careful person had been squatting there. The former owner had been in a nursing home for the past seven years, and now, after her death, her heir wanted to sell the house ASAP.
“We’ll go to Habitat and look around to see what kind of furniture you like.” Bobby got into the car, and Draco sat down beside him. Tan got into the back of the car.
Just as Hermione was about to reply, the Floo chimed and Pansy Parkinson stepped through. She and Hermione seemed to freeze in place upon recognition. For a quick moment, they scanned one another from head to toe before politely greeting each other.
“So, you are the Human Representative they talk so much about, Hermione? Okay, call me Draco.” He felt he could trust her more. The Ministry elves were very good at telling someone’s character, unlike most elves in pureblood estates who were too isolated to question their masters’ opinions.
“What if nobody ever loves me?”
“Back to the topic of the bond. What kinds of inner monologues of Harry’s do you hear?” Hermione changed the topic.
“You want to be good for me?” Harry whispered back.
Pansy laughed. “Oh, Draco! Isn’t it time to overcome that schoolyard rivalry attitude? It could be good for you to open up and accept that Potter still plays an important role in your life. You name your beloved cat after him, and then you claim you hate him!”
“No, her aunt Seonag invented them. They measure some processes in the brain.” Granger explained. “Every colour indicates a feeling. I wish I also had a Muggle EEG, we could examine more different processes…” She trailed off.
Then, Kreacher Disapparated. A few seconds later, he heard Harry read his message.
Usually, his lack of hope to ever be loved felt like an old scar, but days like Valentine’s day, Christmas, Beltane and also Greg’s wedding last year, were like icy weather that made an old injury throb again. He knew that the only one to blame for it was himself. He hadn’t run away the day Aunt Bella had announced that there would be a party for him. He had guessed that she meant his Marking Ritual, fear had gripped him, but he had done nothing to prevent it.
“Malfoy, that’s enough, are you coming with me, or should I firecall Parkinson. I don’t think she’ll take such nonsense from you. And if I’m at it, I guess, Andromeda would also have something to tell you about this.” With a heaving exhale, his magic broke down the wall Malfoy had formed around himself, but to his shock he now felt a drain on his own core strength.
“Use your indoor voices, everyone.” Harry admonished with a chuckle.
Mother and Conrad
“Don’t worry, there aren’t actually any hippogriffs. One used to live there for some time, but it left before the end of the war,” Potter winked. So, Potter had seen him shudder at the thought of hippogriffs.
Yours,
“It’s the same with Harry. He says that once Opaleye finds out he’s not some demigod but a flawed, needy person, he will be gone before Harry can say ‘charm.’” Ginny felt desperate for her friend. ‘Needy’ was the adjective least fitting Harry James Potter. What Harry perceived as neediness in himself everybody else would have called demanding that others respect their human rights.
“We didn’t ask you to make a statement like a politician. You can let your Gryffindor out here.”  Pansy put a hand on Harry’s arm. “You can’t tell me you’re happy how things are going.”
Harry brought his hands to Draco’s shirt buttons. “May I?”
In his younger years, Draco would have considered the gnome’s description of the person barmy, but working among the elves had taught him to take non-human creatures seriously. Now, he tried to learn about their culture before judging, so he could interpret their statements in relation to what he had learned.
Draco finally decided to ask Luna if she could recommend a good cattery. After all, Luna had four cats and she travelled once in a while.
“Mmh, I’m the luckiest bloke on earth. I get to marry the most gorgeous” kiss “amazing” kiss “witty” kiss “and sexy person.” He ran his finger across Draco’s chest, and the zipper charm parted.
“After your trial, it was no longer Rowena Baker in charge of who was allowed to visit you, but Dawlish. He didn’t allow you to get visitors. But he told me you didn’t want to see me, I only learned shortly before Christmas from Tonsy who cleans the DMLE rooms that you would have liked me to visit you. I thought it was too late. I thought I had failed you twice. Once by kissing you without your consent, and once by not finding a way to talk to you.” Harry’s voice sounded shaky.
“Yes,” Lucius said, hiding his shock about Draco making a spectacle of himself. A Pureblood having a show. That was a disgrace. All the Malfoy ancestors would be turning over in their graves at the mere mention of such a thing.
“Of course, you can marry her. I can see that you make her happy. Did you put on those dress robes to ask me? On every picture Mother has shown me, you wear denims, even when you took her to the opera.” Draco smiled at the older man. He saw that this goofy, but highly intelligent healer made his mother happy. She radiated with bliss nowadays, as she had never done before Father’s death.
“But – but I might do or say something creepy again. I’m not ready to lose Harry’s friendship because I…” He paused for a moment in contemplation and walked over to the portrait, leant closer and whispered “feel too much.”
A sound from outside made Draco interrupt his pacing and moping. He checked his fly and listened up.
“As if you knew how long I cooked, you were fast asleep before I had finished stirring the batter. I let you sleep because I assume Paw didn’t let you sleep last night.” Harry placed the plate with the first decorated pancake in front of Malfoy.
Two Aurors, a very graceful-looking woman with a black pixie cut and a man with long sandy hair, entered the room. Weasley led the woman towards Draco. “Malfoy, say hello to your double. Aisha Shahin is the best at imitating other people’s mannerisms, even better, she grew up in Wiltshire.”
Your father
Maybe Mr. Malfoy had inadvertently just given her the solution to the problem of her parents’ constant nagging, although, she was sure the old codger was also just seeing her as a possible bride. Ewww.
“His name is Paw.” Remembering how the Slytherins had teased him in eighth year about his Potter obsession, he didn’t want to reveal Pawter’s full name. “He likes salmon and tuna and needs some activities. He hates being bored.”
Draco
I told you about Sophia and Tesfay, who love to play seekers’ games with junior practising Snitches. Their mothers passed the lycanthropy on to them even though both mothers didn’t breastfeed them. Every day I’m grateful that my godson's infected parent was his father, and therefore he is free of the disease.
“No, I’m not.” Astoria loathed the fact that when it came to young women the only thing every person of her parents’ generation had on their minds were marriage prospects. She had never felt the desire to get married. A man would never compare to the majesty of the stars.
He prepared a valerian chamomile tea. He would rather have taken a dose of Dreamless Sleep, but he had harmed his health during the probation by excessive Dreamless Sleep consumption. After drinking his tea, he tried meditating, then lay down in his bed, but the last time he cast a Tempus it was 3.30 am.  When his wand alarm poked his shoulder, at 6 am, his head hurt, and his eyes burnt.
She sighed. “Yes, that would be great, but you know what Father did to the heiress rings and that I can’t take it off unless Daphne agrees to marry him, because I don’t have any unmarried cousins on the Greengrass side.”
“Dempy, leave that to me. Let me think of something, I promise, I’ll come up with an idea.” He whispered, before they continued their way to the lab.
“You are afraid that Prongs will walk out on you once he sees your face and knows you are Draco Malfoy?” Karamo mirrored the statement.
“He may insult you to your face, but when he talks to me,” Andromeda said in a pensive tone, “he talks about you only with words of praise. If you ask me he likes you alright, whether platonically or…”
Trying his best to avoid people altogether, he collected plates and cutlery from tables without magic. He knew that nobody took it well if he used magic. Whenever he showed his wand, he had to reckon with people hexing him, or calling the Aurors and accusing him of trying to curse them. The fact that he had a Ministry-issued wand and could only use a very limited range of spells didn’t matter.
“Yes, we’re in Grimmauld Place. I inherited it from my godfather Sirius.” The sadness in Potter’s face made Draco wish he could wrap the man in his arms.
Draco had been surprised to find out that Potter worked as an interior designer, but on the other hand, his house looked very tasteful, even though the sofa might suit his taste better in maroon, but upon the mention of it, Potter had explained that Meow had a strong disliking for maroon.
A shriek from Mrs. Walters interrupted him. “Philipp, do something! A ghost!” She pushed Harry aside and ran out of the house. Her Husband followed her.
; they all wanted the Boy Who Lived Twice, the hero to solve all their problems and be a perfect lover.
Lee grinned at Draco: “What a nice surprise, our future televisual star is dating Harry. I already lost hope that I would win those ten galleons from Ron. Fred would love this.”
“That’s not a wedding gift, it’s a good luck gift. And you will unpack it. At! Once!” Pansy looked at him with a sternness directly borrowed from McGonagall.
“Y-yes.”
How are the renovations proceeding? Any new shenanigans from the WWN men or from the kids? I hope you have lots of fun.
After setting it up, Karamo put a box with the word Lego on it on the table. “These are Legos, a Muggle toy. You can build things with them.” He demonstrated stacking a few Legos on top of each other. “I thought, I’ll show you something with Legos and the scale. Please, put some Legos on one scale to symbolize your guilt from the war.”
Harry felt sorry for Bree. “If my cat can get along with another cat, I consent to have him share his room with them. Mistakes happen. It’s no problem. Just make sure you brush him every day.”
Hurrying off to the Apparition point, the last thing he heard from Potter was an exclamation of “Merlin and Morgana! What the fuck?” Only then, it occurred to him what he had said, and embarrassment pounced on him like a wild animal.
Draco took an effort to sound unmoved by the beauty of Potter. “Your search should be over if that can’t make you look good at the gala, nothing can,” he drawled.
The voice seemed to come from inside Draco. As if the person talking were sitting inside his brain.
Draco read the letter, first silently, and then again, for Harry.
“I’ll take the same,” Potter said.
Five men entered the room followed by a televisual camera which stayed in the door.
“Sorry.”
Draco glanced at his mother for a moment. It had not been required that he would give up his last name and become a Potter, but it felt right to stop being a Malfoy.
“Hey, where’s your mom and  dad?”
“You’re the expert, Malfoy, I know that you can handle my bird’s nest.” Harry saw a strange emotion flash across Malfoy’s face. He was glad he had replaced his signature glasses with contacts.
“Croissants, please. I’m a vegetarian.” Draco smiled.
“Can you run with us tomorrow night, Astrios?” the boy who resembled Marlene asked.
“Harry, I would like you to visit us, but I’d understand if you didn’t want to.” He turned to Mary. “Most grownups find it hard to make time at such  short notice.”
Potter put on the robe, and Draco had to concentrate on not showing how he felt about this beauty in front of himself. “If you don’t buy exactly this, you’re daft,” he drawled, then added as an afterthought: “If I still want to eat this lunch break, I have to run, I’ll already have to eat something less appealing than what I meant to buy in order not to spoil the current batch. See you. Oh, and you shouldn’t wear boxers under these, the best thing to wear underneath them is lace.”
But apart from being a drama queen about colours (which also pertained to Harry’s clothes, it also meant that he had never been as well-dressed as since adopting Meowfoy), the cat was endearingly well-behaved. He only ever scratched at the sofa corner with the Thread-Go-Back charm, had his energy outbreaks only in his room, greeted him every time he came home happily and enjoyed his brushing sessions and the occasional belly rub. He seemed to have a sixth sense for Harry’s emotions and was good at grounding him if Harry was about to spiral and providing comfort and ease when he felt sad.
Harry smiled.
As Draco came to the kitchen, Harry was sitting gloomily over a cup of coffee. He had arranged a variety of breakfast food, but not taken a plate himself.
“You could call me by my first name, too,” Draco said, extending an olive branch.
Harry sighed with relief. “Yes, this looks quite like accidental magic.”
The light in the audience went off and a loudspeaker on the stage played the chorus of
“He’s an Exotic Longhair/Kneazle mix. You have to brush his hair every day, and don’t give him the cheap cat food. His breed can get diabetes from it. Wait, I have all you need for the first two weeks with me.”
The next morning was a Saturday. He woke up feeling self-conscious. This was not okay. He was privy to the thoughts of an unknown Auror or crime scene specialist, even to his wank fantasies. And obviously, that bloke didn’t even notice what was going on. The man didn’t voluntarily share his wanking behaviour or his fantasies.
and the audience erupted into applause. “Then you should try singing it in front of an audience. Draco is a brilliant singer and comedian whose stage name Madam Eltanine stands for fun and entertainment. And what reputation is your name associated with?”
“Will you, Draco, talk to nobody but me, Harry and Ron about my real profession unless I allow you to, as long as I shall live.”
Thanks to @stonecoldhedwig for consulting me about the best Scottish word to use for Headmistress McGonagall's exclamation.
“The Dark Mark on my arm says I’m one.” But the door opened anyway. Harry was shocked when he saw Malfoy, his usually so beautiful hair looked lackluster, and the dark shadows under his eyes were worse than in sixth year. Why in Merlin’s name had Harry not seen that in the morning?
“Can I ask you something? Why were you doing what this... big female told you to, and who are you?"” Draco remembered what he had learned from being friends with the elves: Always be respectful towards nonhuman beings. But he wasn’t going to take any nonsense from the gnome either.
“Thank you, Kreacher. Good night.” Draco opened the book just as Kreacher Disapparated from the room.
Mick glared at both of them. “Behave yourselves, both of you. You don’t want to distress your cats, do you?”
Greg pressed his hand to his mouth. It looked as if he were trying not to laugh. But then he seemed to notice how distressed Draco felt. “So, Potter and you didn’t bond voluntarily?”
“Guess we must face the hippogriff and arrange for a playdate.” Harry mumbled barely loud enough in resignation.
“Bye, Malfoy.”
“Harry, I need a favour. You quit your job at the Aurors, I think you could help me a little.”
“Malfoy, food is ready,”
“Since when are you an expert on Muggle sex toys?” Before Harry had finished the sentence, he cringed. Hermione had been the one to give him the talk, and while they all were sex positive; he didn’t really want too many details about Ron and her sex life.
Breakfast was an awkward affair. The elves’ efforts to make it festive changed nothing about that. Hermione, Ron and Pansy tried bravely to keep a conversation with Harry and Draco going, who both just kept pushing their food around on the plate and giving monosyllabic answers at best, staring into their tea cups as if they were suddenly interested in divination and just shooting each other furtive glances.

“No, because in my fantasy, you were getting styled for an event you were happy about attending,” Draco said over the snipping of the scissors.
Meow struck out, but without using his claws. Then he snuggled into Harry’s arms, obviously understanding the meaning of ‘Teddy.’
And finally, if they could, they would talk about their own exasperation. How could humans be such idiots? The cats had tried their very best, showed these clumsy two-legs how to show one’s mate affection, did they still have to show them how to mate? While they weren’t even sure how humans mate at all with their exchangeable fur covering the genitals.
Yesterday, I found out another area of my life where I had let my father define me. I thought that coming out as gay and renouncing his blood purist beliefs meant I had freed myself from his influence. But getting a haircut from an actual hairdresser, not from my mother’s last house elf (Daisy is free, but she calls herself my mother’s elf) taught me I had not.
“And Quinn O’Dell has been my double three times already when I had to deal with stalkers,” Potter added.
They had given him the task of finding a job. And when he had pointed out that he could only work if somebody was willing to employ him, they had decided to make him work at the cafeteria along with the elves. Draco was sure they expected him to prefer Azkaban over the humiliation of being on the same step in the hierarchy with the elves. But Draco had just been thankful that he wasn’t thrown into Azkaban to rot.
After more questions and tests, then dinner with Hermione and Weasley, who brought the gnome along, Harry showed Draco to his room. It was beside Harry’s own room and looked very much like an old-fashioned version of a typical Slytherin teenager’s room. Even the standard trunk was there, monogrammed RAB.
“Mr. Draco Malfoy is not. And that is being the problem,” Dempy deadpanned.
“How old were you then?” Bobby interjected.
After regaining their breaths, Harry cast Scourgify on the both of them, and Draco noticed that one gate had reappeared.
“We can show him that taking care of himself fits in well with being better than his father!” Jonathan’s voice rang out with enthusiasm. “Let’s call this mission ‘the Dragon learns to fly.’”
I’m the man who wasn’t sent to Azkaban because of Harry Potter’s mercy. And I hope that Potter will never regret that he had mercy on me.
“Let me see the Assam and the Earl Grey.” Harry handed Draco the tins with the teas. “Miracles happen. You do have some decent tea. Which one do you prefer?”
Harry had chuckled, and replied: “I don’t think we’re dead, but it surely feels heavenly.”
Harry let go of his nipple and breathed, “Lift your hips, darling,” against it. The sound of his voice made Draco shiver with pleasure.
It turned out, I inherited my hair structure from my mother’s side. With my father’s A+ parenting, I’d rather be my mother’s spitting image than my father’s. (Although, I’d say I look by far more masculine.) She may have been on potions during both wars and also in between and may therefore have obeyed him unconditionally until the day the elves no longer put the potion into her morning tea, but I know she loves me, and she always did. She used what strength she had to protect me and to help me be as much of myself as was possible. And since the end of the war, she has supported me in everything, including the fact that I’m gay. She even went to Pride to Muggle London with me, wearing a “Proud of my gay son” t-shirt.
A man, whose salt-and-pepper hair was combed into an elegant style, and whom he recognized from a picture Luna had shown him, approached him and pulled him into a hug. What was the man’s name again? Tawny? Bronze? No! Tan. Tan France. One of the hosts of Queer Eye. An American show that was now working on a season on WWN Televisual. Those who were going to occupy his groundskeeper hut. He had better pull himself together. Those men were only televisual celebrities, and no Dark Lords. He could do it.
Have a wonderful evening,
“He just talked again. Do you have today’s Daily Prophet?” Draco’s voice was shaky.
“Never. But you called me pointy and ferrety.”
“You can call me what you want. You don’t try to poison me or throw me around. You even feed me.” The gnome grinned.
Draco remembered what a prat he had been in school, disrespecting most of his teachers, with the exception of Severus. Some, like Lockhart, had deserved the disrespect, but when he thought of Professor Lupin, the most competent and caring teacher of Draco’s school years—and he had called him the werewolf and looked down on him.
Draco had caught a glimpse of Harry’s room when Harry had sought out a set of pyjamas for him. It had Muggle pictures of motorcycles with women in bikinis on the walls, and the four-poster was wide enough to be suitable for a couple. Beside the bed, there was a picture of two men, with a frame of elaborately painted green carnations. It seemed that the women on the posters probably were just a distraction for the room’s original owner’s family, while in reality, he was in a relationship with the other man on the picture.
Harry’s voice sounded sad.
Draco noticed, after they both had decided to order vegetable pakoras for starters, that Potter turned the menu directly to the page with the vegetarian dishes. “Are you a vegetarian, too?”
After Hermione had instructed Draco about the rules he had to obey in order to get well soon and Flooed out, Dempy made them a calming lavender chamomile tea and coaxed Draco to eat the dinner that Harry had left under a stasis charm when Draco hadn’t showed up. Meanwhile it was morning, but Hermione had said that the spices of the Dhal would be very helpful to make him sweat out some of the toxins from the residue. Potter sat beside him and watched him with an odd smile, while drinking his awfully sweetened coffee and eating a croissant with marmalade.
In an atypical bout of impulsiveness, he penned an answer, asking Luna to come over in the evening. His mind was made up that if the cat wasn’t the most awful creature or repulsed by Draco, he would be his cat. After all, he did long for some living being to cuddle with once in a while.
“But –“ Malfoy lifted himself to a sitting position, but immediately lay back. “I can’t get up. I feel so exhausted.”
“Pans, shouldn’t you be with Astoria, after all you’re one of the bridesmaids.” Draco looked at her incredulously.
“Yeah, I know, and there are worse people to lay low with.” Potter thought of a few names, among them Dawlish and Smith.
The more time passed the more Harry felt worried. What if something terrible had happened? Before he thought about it, he threw Floo powder into the chimney and shouted Malfoy Manor. Dempy answered the Floo twisting the sleeve of her matronly dress in her hand.
Soon, he felt his balls draw up, and he came, hearing Harry in his head
“Kreacher! Could you come here, please? Mr. Draco needs you.” Draco had never heard a mirror call for a house-elf, but then, in this house, if Kreacher was going to talk to anyone, there were only mirrors and portraits for that.
“Eighteen. I had one year of house arrest, but with the chance of finishing my education, then I studied Muggle microbiology and then healing in France, staying in a dorm at Uni. Later, when I had a chance to return here, I first moved into my mother’s suite, but I couldn’t stand it there. Nobody would rent a flat to me, so I moved into this hut.”
And he kept whispering the most hilarious comments in Harry’s ear; in the end, Harry was almost disappointed when Percy and Justin were to dance their traditional first dance.
“Do I see a blush in that gorgeous face of yours?” The mirror’s voice got excited. “Please, tell me you want to court him. Sirius didn’t know what to do with the house, but he and Moony… if you stay along I’ll tell you about them one of these days. Not all the details, ein Gentleman genießt und schweigt, a gentleman enjoys and keeps his mouth shut about it, as the German proverb says. In short, what we need is a couple in the house. Not such a barely coexisting  pseudo-couple like Orion and Walburga but people who are in love with each other.”
“Whoever’s done it, is likely to try again. They also might attack Malfoy since he’s an important witness.” Weasley finally stated.
There were no pictures on the walls, and the whole space looked very impersonal. “How long have you lived here?” Bobby inquired finally after a moment of silence.
This time, I'm uploading fast, but I guess, you'll have to wait a week or so for the third chapter, as I have only just started writing it. ;-)
“Merlin, yessss!” They moved closer to each other, and Harry felt that Draco was just as hard as he was. He wanted to feel that wonderful body with less layers of clothes.
But he could! “It will take me some research in the Black library to find the specifics of this house, but then I can teach you. The Black properties and the Malfoy properties are built on the same principles.”
“I like that.” Draco gave the kids a wide smile.
“Harry, I think we must postpone the cuddling, and maybe have a nap at noon, but now I have a letter to write.” Draco climbed out of bed, and Harry followed his elegant and lithe body with his eyes, as he crossed the room and went into the en suite.
Draco heard the Golden Trio’s loud footsteps, then they entered the downstairs kitchen. He made himself dense enough to be visible in the hall.
“You should leave, Potter.”
“I don’t have one.” Draco fidgeted.
Fake-Draco’s voice spat out the words over Harry’s pleas for forgiveness.
Harry walked through the front garden, taking in the cherry tree, the mix of wildflowers and garden flowers gone wild. There were beautiful roses that Mrs. Figg would be proud of, if they had not crawled wildly all over the place. But something about it had a nice feeling to it.
“Only if you call me Harry.”
With a resolute wand movement, they charmed themself into their second costume. It was a velvet dress in a blue so dark it was almost black, with lace sleeves embroidered all over with constellations. Some people in the audience gasped. They managed this, despite the distress of their father being here.
They yawned. “Good morning, my fiancé.”
I just couldnt resist giving the second chapter a LOTR title, sorry, but I guess that's an occupational hazard of writing about cursed signet rings.
“I don’t. I want you to come back to our salon Even though I won’t ever take money from you. Do you have a plus one for the occasion?” Malfoy manhandled him onto the chair and pushed him to the washing basin.
“But surely you are betrothed?” He gave her a curious look.
“And then… well, I think I should tell Harry alone first and have him decide how much of it to tell you. It’s rather…” Draco trailed off. This wasn’t easy to talk about.
“What do you think? Should we tell the public that we’re going to get married, too? Or should they only hear that we’re in a relationship?” Harry asked.
“Your MacDougal diamonds!” Granger exclaimed. “I’ve never seen such synchronicity in two MacDougal diamonds, unless…” She shut her mouth as if she had said too much, then started again. “I can’t tell you what it might mean now, but I promise I’ll tell you what I know after my theory has been tested. Telling you now might influence the results.”
“Five years.” Draco’s voice sounded shy.
Somebody knocked at the door. “Come in.”
Six months later, Harry was on his way through Selfridges, when he noticed a small girl who looked about 5 years old, crying. Her dark coiled hair was pulled back in braids.
”Okay,” his mouth said without asking his brain for permission.
He crawled into his bed and turned on the Wireless. Another Celestina Warbeck special. But at least no hourlong repetition of one and the same song.
The elevator dinged behind them.
Dear Prongs,
“I knew you weren’t straight when all your letters in first year were pages after pages about Harry Potter. You could have been bisexual then, but, darling, when there was never a single letter that dedicated more than an obligatory phrase to a girl or woman’s attractivity, that was a clear sign. I’ve probably known it before you did. I never told your father, and he died thinking you would marry Astoria Greengrass, but I’m glad you’ll be free to marry whom you want.” She smiled softly in her endearing manner that Draco recognised as she tucked a small lock of hair behind his ears.
“Harry, who’s the owner of the cat?” Andromeda asked gently across the room, while pouring herself another steaming cup of Earl Grey. “If I have any influence, I’ll talk to them.”
“Seven years is madness!” Harry almost yelled. “Even from Azkaban those Pureblood supremacists still harm their own children and the ones who love them!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. No, he couldn’t show how much the thought of it overjoyed him. He took a deep breath and pulled himself together. “I was taught as a teen that putting out on the first date is slutty, b--”
“I’m – I’m sorry that I always used to assume your Muggle relatives would treat you like a prince.” Draco awkwardly put his hand on Harry’s shoulder as Harry pulled him into a hug.
Draco sighed. Why did the fates hate him so much that they chose to bond him with a sleepwanker? And with the most handsome sleepwanker possible, at that?
The phrase “fresh pickled toad” evoked a cringe in Draco, as he remembered writing bad poetry in second year, only saved from embarrassment as everyone had assumed it to be the work of the Weaslette.
He looked drool-worthy, as he walked towards him in a berry-coloured button-up shirt under a leather jacket, and jeans that hugged his frame perfectly. His hair no longer looked like a bird’s nest, but like well-groomed, artfully arranged tight curls.
The last thing he perceived before succumbing to sleep was that the cats sat down in the space between him and Malfoy and purred as loud as they could.
There were things his flatmates in France had cooked, like green asparagus, Muggle plants that could be used for magic, like ginger, turmeric and coriander. There were things that he didn’t know, like paper-thin round white sheets of a fragile texture. Draco couldn’t resist curiosity. He touched and smelled what he didn’t know. The white sheets didn’t have any particular smell.
Harry wanted to say no, but he couldn’t muster the mental strength to do so. If anyone had told him during his Hogwarts years, that he would adopt a cat, he would have assumed they were a case for the Janus Thickey Ward. Well, he did grow fond of Crookshanks in the end, but he assumed that Crookshanks was an exception to the rule and that most cats were like Mrs. Figgs’ cats, a noisy lot eating stinking food.
Weasley Accioed a form, “Witness consenting to Legilimens,” and Draco filled and signed it.
“Have you ever considered that Potter might be attracted to you, too?” Pansy took a small bite from her petit four.
“I’m glad you weren’t a Slytherin when Voldemort was in power, as a Gryffindor you were a lot safer than you would have been. Not that you were safe. But how can you think I deserve all those chances you give me?”
“We could also hyphenate and tell them both our family histories,”Harry smiled softly at them. “The good things and the bad. They’ll know about your family, about mine, and about their mother’s. We’ll tell them about the stories of our ancestors who built little niches of love in the stream of history. Anyway, look at how the press reacted to our engagement. It’s the first time the Daily Prophet got it right.”
“Dempy, please, pack things for him and also for you elves, how many of you are there by the way?” Harry had to be more stubborn than Malfoy, this dark magic in the walls of the Manor could kill someone he mused. It was the kind of decontamination site that could only be worked with charms working from the outside, if it could be decontaminated at all.
“Potter, please forgive me for letting our correspondence die down after my trial. I was in a bad place back then.” Malfoy’s voice sounded soft and regretful.
He lay still afterward, gasping, slowly coming down from his orgasm.
Draco and Harry would later still discuss Draco’s father long and wide, but for now it wasn’t urgent enough to ruin the mood of the first morning of their engagement.
“Antoni is making chutney, Karamo is talking to another hero’s family, and Jonathan will join us later,” Tan said.
Happy tears welled up in Draco’s eyes when Harry used their stage name as a middle name. “Yes! I will, I love you!” There was so much more to say, and they would say it, but not on the stage in front of an audience in which there were at least two reporters.
“I’ve looked at you every single day. And on bad days, looking at you, even though I thought I could only fancy you from far, was what made it worth getting up.” Harry whispered in his ear. Then he sucked at Draco’s earlobe. His hand began to stroke Draco’s cock through the fabric.
In reality, Harry suffered from PTSD so severely he couldn’t function in the Aurors except as a public face, which he couldn’t do regardless since he hated giving speeches. And the reality of his legendary sexual experience consisted only of expert wanking and the knowledge that he was actually gay. He had some failed attempts at sex with Ginny on his list of sexual experiences before they had both admitted to themselves and each other “I love you, but your parts do nothing for me.” And he had an experience with a mutual handjob in a Muggle club loo, although it had just turned out that his one-off was a glamoured Zacharias Smith who had outed him in the Daily Prophet.
“Gin, you can count on Draco to be good to Harry. Since he has parted ways with his father, he has gotten rid of that nasty wrackspurts infestation. These days he’s completely surrounded by lyubarinky. And that’s the best sign for a relationship with Harry.” She kissed her fiancée on the cheek.
She put her handbag on the kitchen table, hugged Potter hello, then shook Draco’s hand as if it wasn’t unusual. “I brought food, and then we have to run some tests.”
“Draco, welcome to Catford Cat and Kneazle Boarding Cattery.” The voice was lower than what he remembered Millicent to sound like, but their manner of speaking had not changed as much so that he recognized it immediately.
I hope Potter is what you want him to be for you.
“Then don’t go back there before Bill declares it safe.” Potter replied.
“Which idiot is occupying the grooms’ nightchamber?” Justin’s pretentious voice yelled.
“I was shocked that Malfoy was a ghost, then he looked so desperate, I wish I could have hugged and comforted him, but he’s still prickly, and when he scared the horrible couple away who wanted to buy the house, he made me laugh so hard. I don’t think I’ve laughed like that in years. Sorry, I’m not making sense.” Harry ruffled his hair.
“Sorry about the state of the corridor.” Potter ruffled his hair with a sheepish look on his face.  “This mark is where a picture of my godfather’s bigoted mother was and yelled insults at everybody, and those marks...” Potter motioned to the opposite wall. “...are where we removed house elf heads and gave them a decent burial.”
“He’s still in the saving business, what with the Padfoot Foundation. He just doesn’t need to risk his life anymore for it.” Hannah added.
The fire crackled pleasantly in the fireplace as Luna and Mick spent the rest of their evening chatting about the plans of their weekend with rosy cheeks and glistening eyes.
Granger asked him and Potter to sit down comfortably and started the examination. She waved her wand in intricate patterns first over Potter, then over him, and after that, she placed a diamond-shaped milky object into Draco’s hand and an identical one into Potter’s. Another wave of her wand over both objects made them glow in white.
“I’m not. You’re beautiful when you come. So beautiful, I had to touch myself, too. I just vanished the mess wordlessly.” Harry grinned, then cuddled up to him and kissed him. Draco tasted himself on Harry’s tongue.
“NO! You’d die.” Draco was shocked.
Merlin’s balls! What have I done to Harry that he reacts like this to being alone with me. I must do something.
It wasn’t Pansy’s fault that she was luckier than him in matters of the heart. On the other hand, in the first years after the war, she had been far less lucky than him and had cleaned the street for three years after the war, because nobody would employ her for anything better, until she had overheard a conversation between Ron and George about a new Wheeze that wouldn’t function and had deduced the flaw in the product and told them.
“Now you know. And you can piss off.” Malfoy glared at him.
Lucius had no doubt that Draco was singing this song because of him.
Draco sat down and started working on his letter to Prongs.
One hand started playing around with the balls, while the other stroked across the vein on the underside of his cock. Then Draco felt Harry take off his pyjama bottoms, turn around, and stroke over a toned arse cheek while humping a pillow.
“You know what? I’ll check in if Kreacher is back, and you can talk about this privately. Tell me when you’re ready to continue.” She got up and left the room, her steps discernible on the stairs going down to the first floor.
Prongs
He imagined a dark-haired bloke with green eyes, and as he came in his pyjama pants, he felt the mysterious bloke come simultaneously.
“You’re wearing red lace?”
“It’s about time. Meow and Paw were quite exasperated last time I spoke to them.”
“The last thing I heard from my cousin, who turned out better than his parents, is that their house is haunted by a ghost who has lots of fun with them. The ghost sounds quite familiar. I think it’s Fred, Ron’s brother.”  Harry reached for Draco’s hand, and Draco pulled him into a comforting embrace.
“Yes. Bloody hell! I never would have thought that he has to transform as a portrait, too. The only comforting thing is that it doesn’t hurt him anymore. Although we are capable of feeling things.” Sirius replied with a wink, before taking a deep breath with glittering eyes. Harry suppressed an exasperated groan at the memory of the activities he had caught Sirius and Remus in the middle of before he had provided them a bedroom picture in a closed box.
“But you should talk to him personally. Not to the DMLE in general, although maybe you can still trust Auror Weasley. But beware of the other Aurors.” Pansy gave him a stern look.
“Finally finished? I’ve been sitting here, waiting for half an hour. You could at least have cast a silencing charm, mate.” Weasley’s voice came from downstairs, as Draco left the bedroom.
“Do you mean a bed?” Harry’s voice sounded shy.
“Stop that! It’s inappropriate and invasive to poke into a ghost, most especially if the ghost is your former archrival,” Malfoy sneered.
“Potter, you defeated Voldemort, you are there for all your friends, don’t think that I haven’t heard of that. So, you fucking deserve to wear something comfortable and gorgeous. Wait for one moment. Oh, and take that hideous rag off already. I don’t want to see such a thing near you again.” Draco was surprised at his own reaction, no matter that he sometimes wanked to the thought of Potter in Quidditch clothes or jeans that hugged his arse perfectly, he never would have thought that he would get emotionally involved in what Potter was wearing to a charity gala.
Moments later, just as he wanted to ask if anything needed to be cleaned up, something wet trickeled over his cheek. There was a sound of something clinking, like a breaking vial, and simultaneously, something heavy landed on his face. At first, it felt like an animal, but when he had put the plates on the next table and removed it from his face, he saw that it was an unconscious gnome. It had wings, and was  carrying a quiver with a bow and arrows across his shoulder.
He added the crushed pearls and the rosebuds. It would be expensive to brew this potion often enough to give Astoria a satisfying marriage life, but nobody deserved to be in a marriage with someone who didn’t want to make them happy. Astoria was a good woman. She had the same worldviews and cultural interests as Draco and she was a great friend. If this kind of thing could work with any woman then it was only with her or Pansy.
“Is there a place where you really enjoy being?” Jonathan asked him.
He often thought that if Padfoot House had existed already when he was 14 and his father cursed him for not having better grades than Granger, he could have run away and not have become a Deatheater.
“Definitely, but you prefer to bottom anyway, if your input on our adult toy product line doesn’t deceive me.” George had grinned, then hugged Percy and left with a “see you next week, lawful neutral.”
“I don’t need mercy. Leave me alone. Paw has it good with you.”
Last time we had tea together, you told me the Manor felt so empty without your mother in it, and I have found a way to ease that loneliness at least a little. We both know that you can really solve the problem of your loneliness completely yourself, and while I have an idea of what you could do to fight the infestation of solitari that built their nest around you, I know you are not ready to do that and would rather deal with it much later on, if I even as much as told you about it.
It had been only after this that Draco had allowed themself to indulge in the idea that Harry was here to stay, that they weren’t just a bit of casual sex for Harry. And only from the conversations with Harry about this on, Draco had allowed themself to accept that their war trauma was valid. That they had been victimized by their father too, and even more by Bellatrix.
“Malfoy can’t return home for now, nor Floo, owl, use a two-way mirror or Muggle ways of communication, but this is a way of keeping a next of kin updated on the well-being of a witness. He can send you small messages that don’t reveal anything about his whereabouts by writing them on his hand. As long as we know nothing about the person who tried to attack Harry, we have to take a worst-case scenario into consideration.”
“But he hates me. He called me pointy.” Draco cringed at how whiny his own voice sounded.
“Are we going to spend our honeymoon in Atlantis?” Draco asked.
He expected the sensation of hair in his hands or of holding on to something in order not to topple over, but his right hand felt as if it ghosted lower and grabbed his cock. The man’s loud thoughts weren’t words he spoke to someone else. He was wanking. Draco felt his blood rushing into his groin. The silver-eyed seeker was the man’s wank phantasy. And Draco couldn’t resist his own wank phantasy, being fucked against the Quidditch shower wall and feeling his partner’s callused hands on his nipples.
Draco read the letter for the fifth time. Prongs was proud of him. Of him! He wouldn’t be if he had the slightest idea that the man he was writing to was Draco Malfoy, branded with a Dark Mark when he was 16, Draco Malfoy who had tried to kill Dumbledore, and who had gone scot-free only due to the immense mercy of Harry Potter. Draco Malfoy who couldn’t do enough good deeds in three lifetimes to ever deserve forgiveness, leave alone someone being proud of him or even signing a letter with ‘yours.’
Before turning in for the night, Draco took his compendium of wizards’ health magic and looked up what he did wrong with his spellwork.
“Will you do all that is in your power to protect not only my secrets but also all of Harry’s secrets that you hear through the bond unless he consents to you talking about it, unless telling it is the only way to save Harry’s life?”
Karamo asked: “Can I adjust the scale to what you just told me and to the fact that during most of the things you put on the guilt pan you were underage and during the rest barely of age?”
“No, actually, he was an abusive bigot.” It took Draco all his courage to word this knowing very well that many people would hear it, but it felt fucking liberating.
“I’ve cooperated with curse damage and we developed a potion to manage the effect of Jacques Bardian’s curse and restores the red blood cells’ ability to transmit oxygen,” Draco said shyly.
Draco bent down and picked up the cookie. He broke it open and read the paper inside.
Draco said these things openly. Maybe it would make someone understand that being a bigot could ruin their whole life.
They did all sorts of joking around with the costumes and props for Luna’s theatre group that found their way into my wardrobe because there’s no space for them anywhere else. Imagine a posh-looking grey-haired man in a niffler onesie lifting the hood up high, so it won’t tousle his hair. One of them, who was wearing higher heels than Louise Delacour, put on my Quidditch leathers, and one of his colleagues gave him a piggyback ride.
“Malfoy’s cat? Bree, did you book Malfoy into the last room?” They gave her a stern look. “Because I booked Harry Potter in.”
“I think after your appearance at Lee’s show, we don’t need to worry too much. People know that you’re not your father.” Harry took a seat beside Draco, still holding his hand.
“I have two hands and a mouth. Don’t worry.” Harry said appeasingly.
Draco was sitting at his microscope and analysing a blood sample of a patient with a blood curse when he heard a noise outside his lab. Cheerful men’s voices asked Healer Rashid where Draco’s lab was.
Draco finally managed a coherent answer. “Mild to medium, maybe.”
“Hello, gorgeous people,” they greeted the audience.
“Muggle version of Binns,” Draco whispered.
🎵 This work is part of H/D Wireless, a song inspired, anon, Drarry fest with its home on tumblr!
After an hour, and sometimes a discreetly cast Flaccidus on Draco’s part, he would go back to the Manor, leaving Pawter with Meow, not one minute before politeness dictated that he ought to leave, as Potter had to go to his clients and refurnish their houses.
“And you are lucky to see Nargles and Wrackspurts. Not everyone has such good eyes. How is Ginny, by the way?” Mick remembered having a crush on Ginny in sixth year. That was long ago, before Astoria had won their heart.
But there was no way Prongs would want someone with the Dark Mark on his wrist and the matching guilt he could never in his life atone for. Prongs had once in a letter mentioned being on the run from death eaters. So, he could never befriend one, leave alone develop feelings for him.
“We have to help Harry work through his feelings. Malfoy has always played a special role for Harry,” Ron said in a patient yet slightly exasperated voice.
“Are you a herbivore Animagus, too?” A girl pulled at his sleeve.
The next time he looked over to Malfoy, the blond was resting his cheek on his arms and sleeping, his hair becoming undone by the sleeping position.
Harry pulled him into a hug. “I will wait for you. I love you.”
The cat stretched and got up gracefully, ambled towards him and sniffed at his outstretched hand, then rubbed his cheek against Draco’s fingers. Then he circled around Draco’s legs. When Draco sat down, the cat immediately climbed onto his lap. “I’ll call you Pawter,” Draco whispered in his ear. Pawter purred loudly.
“Ms. Greengrass, I take it you aren’t married?” Mr. Malfoy inquired as they sat down, looking at her ringless hands.
Seamus got up and approached Malfoy Senior with his wand at the ready.
Before Harry had figured out how to explain it to his godson, Meowfoy gave another heartbreaking yowl and stared at the door as if he could hypnotize it to open by itself.
“Please, don’t call me Potter, as if we were still rivals. Call me Harry.” A pleading look appeared on Potter’s closed mouth.
“Brat!” Harry pulled him in for a kiss, then walked with him into an alley and sidealonged him to Grimmauld Place.
“C-can I take the vow now, to convince you?” Draco was afraid she might remember what a git he had been at school, or that he might still not have overcome enough prejudices to be considered worthy of the way they were treating him. He cast two cushioning charms on the floor and knelt down on the one.
“You really want me to call you by your first name? But I’m…” Draco pointed at his left arm.
“Thank Merlin. I bought these just to make the right impression on you. Your mother said, that you have a perfect sense of style and like when people are well-dressed.” His eyes crinkled in a similar way reminiscent of  Professor Lupin’s eyes when a student had known more than expected.
He could do this. After all, he had faced his aunt Bellatrix and lied to her. He had even concealed his fear from Voldemort with the occlumency skills his mother had taught him. He had had to pretend he was learning occlumency from Aunt Bella, knowing he wouldn’t survive if he could not hide his real thoughts from her. But that was motivated by fear. This was hope, and hope was a very different thing. Hope made him lose his Malfoy mask.
“Really? Did you really not find me ugly?”
“Draco, you have to take some chocolate and tell me what’s going on. Did Dawlish accuse you of being unclean again?” She speared a piece of gâteau au chocolat with a fork and fed Draco with it.
“Did I have any reason to expect your pointy face here? It’s reason enough to be startled.”
“Good morning, Malfoy. Did Paw yowl all night, too? Did he eat?” Harry just hoped Malfoy would be too tired to lash out.
Malfoy gave him an exasperated look. “Comfort me! Who on earth has ever heard of it being possible to comfort a ghost? And then you of all people want to comfort me? Potty, you are even crazier than I thought.”
Draco was waiting for Harry with two trays of food at the same table where they would sit together every day for lunch with Ron and Hermione. But today was different. They had a press conference scheduled for after lunch.
When they had calmed Draco down, and he had cast a glamour to conceal that he had been crying, Antoni and Karamo asked Draco to help them unload the food for the cooking lesson. There were two large crates of groceries, lots of vegetables and fruits, cheeses, tofu and legumes.
“That calls for a few secret weapons! You chose well to come to our salon.” The stylist gave him a smug look. She pressed an intercom and said, “Harry Potter is here.”
An hour later, they were inflating the transfigured bouncy castles, which benefited greatly from George’s mischief experience. Ron had discussed a bit with George and got the highest praise his brother was capable of: “Fred would be proud of you. All this mischief and for a good cause!”
He knelt down at the fireplace, took Floo Powder and firecalled Luna. “I can’t meet Prongs in person. I want to keep on writing to him, but to meet him in person is impossible. He would hate me if he knew who I am.”
“But how are you managing emotionally now that Draco is here around the clock?” Hermione returned to the original topic.
Mick shrugged. “That’s how they have always been. I just hope their cats are stubborn enough for those two stubborn hippogriff-heads. But I know once they realise that the other one is capable of caring about them just as profoundly as they know they might come to care, it is lasting and forever. I believe once they accept that fact we won’t need to worry about them so much anymore.”
The Fab Five followed him into his sparsely furnished groundskeeper hut. They looked around. Beside the window, there was a mattress on the ground, next to it, a crate as a nightstand. A clothes rack stood on one side, reminding rather of a flea market than of a wardrobe. Beside it were the only three complete pieces of furniture in the room: A bookshelf, a small table and a swivel chair.
“You both had this habit of standing on the table and yelling across the Great Hall just to get each other’s attention. What were we supposed to think if not that you were in denial but had the hots for each other.”
After a sleepless night, Harry couldn’t stand it any longer. He dressed as neatly as he could, pulled his hair in a ponytail and headed to the Floo. “Malfoy Manor.”
“He isn’t even aware of the bond, I think. At least, he isn’t as straight as the Prophet wants us to believe. Nor is Ginevra Weasley.” Draco told Greg the whole story, leaving only the wanking out.
“Nippy took the picture. She is a talented photographer. I just posted it to you.”
The cats took their time to show any interest in the treats after their rouse, and when they did, they didn’t go alone to their respective owners, but ambled side by side first to Harry, then to Draco, and both cats together tasted both treats, evading the hands that wanted to scoop them up.
“Lucius, fancy seeing you here.” A husky voice called out to him.
He stared at the ring that forced him into this situation. The ring that forced him to get married to a Greengrass. (If only the Greengrasses had a son, or if there was a male Greengrass by blood!)
“I used to wear those threadbare things for such occasions before they became threadbare. And I haven’t gone to any such occasion in many years. I’m sure the St. Mungo’s staff is glad every year that I’m not attending their party.” Draco fidgeted so hard with his shirt button he twisted it off.
“Malfoy, stop it. You aren’t a Deatheater.” Harry felt torn and desperate.
“He’s - dead, he’s a - ghost.” The words felt like an ever-growing foul lump in his mouth.
“Florence is dead? And I never found out if she’s a Malfoy Squib.” Malfoy dramatically rolled up in a ball on the floor.
“We need to fill in the check-in form. What’s your cat’s name?”
Astoria had seen that feeling on Daphne’s face when she had visited her at St. Mungo’s after the birth, and seen little Zoe for the first time. Since then she had wished to have a child too, as long as another person would be the primary parent. And as long as she didn’t need to play the wife. But Draco was openly gay and in a relationship with Harry. If she offered to be their surrogate, she could have that child without needing to fit into the norms her parents tried to press her into.
“I’m not good at buying things for myself, and most especially clothes. My school robes were the first things I owned that were not hand-me-downs from my cousin.” He muttered in a low voice. Everything in Potter’s voice and tense pose revealed that it was difficult for him to speak about it.
Draco,
“Pansy, that was very rushed.” Narcissa raised one eyebrow.
When Harry’s sobbing was a bit calmer, Hermione asked: “What’s the matter with Malfoy?”
Something was going on. He knew it. Draco did their vocal warm ups. They mentally went through their programme of songs and stand-up comedy. This was the third programme they had developed to perform at Blaise’s. The first one had been,
“You--you really want to marry me? Is that—is that just to piss off my ancestors?” Draco stammered.
Other songs mentioned/quoted in this chapter:
Dear Draco,
“Hello, Cousin Sirius, how are you? And how is Remus? Is he sleeping after the Full?” Andromeda turned to Sirius’ portrait, seeing that the place beside him at the painted table was empty.
Potter smiled softly. All the colours of the rainbow appeared first on Potter’s artifact, then on Draco’s.
Chapter title and song lyrics in this chapter are taken from
“Well, there are rubber duck vibrators, seems like he mistook a coincidence of properties for an essential feature.” Hermione grinned.
“Yes?”
“Oh, Harry, Draco may have made Potter stinks badges in fourth year, but the truth is, in that same year, Marcus dropped a vial of Amortentia that he had stolen from Potions in the common room, and when Draco came in, he asked why the common room smelled like Potter. I didn’t tell you I wasn’t going to sleep in your room because I had hoped the two of you would finally get together after all these years of dancing around each other. Be a darling and tell him already that you fancy him.” She turned on her heels and walked back into the guestroom.
One of the girls giggled. “Captain Sparkle Pants!”
“Uncle Harry, does that mean you’ll visit us and stay for a few days? My friends’ uncles, aunts and grandparents visit and stay for a few days. Mom says Ghana is too far away, and my Ghanaian uncles and aunties don’t have enough money to visit. Please, Uncle Harry. My birthday is next week.” Mary pleaded and grabbed Harry’s hand. She looked at him with puppy dog eyes.
“Who do you want to impress, handsome? On the one hand, they would be smitten if you go out like this and show your legs, but I know, you might not be in a situation where that’s an option.” The mirror answered in a bass voice.
Potter’s voice rang out in Draco’s mind.
“Potter, didn’t I tell you to leave me alone? And now you come here with Granger and the Weasel?” He sneered.
“You mean Mary…?” Dudley raised his eyebrows and stroked Mary’s hair.
“And being tactless comes with being raised by Lucius Malfoy.”
As best as they could, they soldiered through their programme; telling some jokes, singing
Harry squeezed his hand. “Say what you want, Draco. I’ll wait as long as you would like me to be the one you have on the side.”
“You’re a human being with flaws and strengths, and they all think they can stuff you into a bottle and turn you into their personal genie,” Draco replied.
When the song was over, and Draco’s attention had shifted away from him, Lucius had to get away. His son had called him a ‘clown’ in front of all those people. The Weasel and that Irish Auror had noticed, too, he knew it.
Harry mumbled something like Accio Meowth, and a hissing Meow flew into his arms. “Sorry, darling, but you know, Teddy is coming over and having dinner with us.”
“It could be a big step towards equal chances.” Narcissa mused.
“It’s no longer Millicent. They go by Mick and They nowadays. And if I weren’t so incensed at them presently, I’d say that they looked happier than ever, but they really took the biscuit with that.” Draco ranted while trying to calm Pawter.
“To share the bed with you while..?” Harry asked ruffling his hair.
“Mate, what did you feel when you saw him?” Ron asked.
“What the fuck were you doing? Why did you pour some weird liquid into my face and then crash land in it?” He whisper-yelled, as Mipsy cleaned his face with a wet cloth.
“Okay, to prove to you that I don’t expect sex just because I paid and invited you.” Harry waved his hand in a pattern at his crotch. “Flaccidus!”
Draco had no idea what Queer Eye Wizarding Britain was. He didn’t have a televisual. But the groundskeeper hut he lived in was part of Malfoy Manor, and part of his reparations was that the Ministry had the right to use Malfoy Manor as they wished to for 20 years.
Prongs?” Draco’s voice sounded thin.
The doorbell chimed, and Harry answered. A slim middle-aged couple whose facial expressions and clothes style reminded him of the Dursleys stood there.
As Harry waited for Malfoy in front of the hair salon, he was glad that Malfoy had insisted on him wearing a suit with cufflinks. He would have twisted off his buttons if they were sewn on. It was a Muggle suit in a brilliant emerald colour, that he would never have dared put on without Malfoy encouraging him.
Draco bowed like an actor. “Hello, nice to meet you all. Harry told me a lot about how brilliant you all are. I guess I must ask your permission to court Harry.”
A freckled hand appeared in his range of vision. “Mione, Draco, enough nerdy discussions! All work and no play are boggart attractors. The castles are ready! The last on the purple castle is a rotten dragon’s egg!”
“You do remember who we’re talking about?” Matthew sounded almost like a masculine version of Pansy. “This is Harry Potter, immune to flattery and bribery, but with an unlimited desire for a few things you have to give. You were born and raised by Mistress Narcissa, you have learned how to be witty from small. You like him, not his public image, I can see that when you say his name. And, tell me, what is it you love most about him?”
Dempy pressed the bowl with the Floo powder into his hand and gently nudged him towards the direction. Finally, he flooed over to Grimmauld Place.
The assistant, Marvin, showed him two different outfits, a combination in blue and burnt sienna that reminded a bit of a kingfisher, and on the other hand, something Draco craved to see Potter in. It was the more daring outfit, but Draco felt like he would beg to see Potter wearing this. Of course, he questioned his sanity at the same time. What was it to him what Potter would be wearing to the gala?
The doorbell rang, and Draco got up and opened. Outside stood Tan and Bobby with the televisual team.
When he had come down from his orgasm, he mumbled “Sorry.”
“Potter said he wants to take Teddy to the Muggle zoo and tell the snakes jokes for him,” Draco repeated. After his first word, Potter’s artifact dimmed visibly.
“Mmh, Harry, stay.” Draco mumbled.
“Why - why are you here? And what is that Weasel doing to you?” Lucius finally brought out.
Afraid but hopeful,
(See the end of the chapter for
It was no question that Percy and George were opposites to an extent Draco had never imagined siblings could be opposites.  Although, whilst at Hogwarts there had been rumours of them not really getting along, now as they had matured, disagreements didn’t stop them from caring and trusting each other. Also, nobody forced a legacy or a hierarchy on them.
As soon as Tan let go of him, another man pulled him into a hug, this one was blond with a beard. Bobby … Berk, as Draco remembered, followed by the one with long hair, a moustache and beard, who was wearing high heels and a skirt … Jonathan Van Ness, then Karim, no: Karamo and Antoni, if he remembered well what Luna had told him.
“I’m put off antiques, as well as furniture made of dark wood for the rest of my life. That happens when you have lived in a house full of antiques with Voldemort turning any room he is in into a torture chamber. I’ve seen things that should not be mentioned when children might watch with their parents.” Draco’s voice sounded cracked.
“No, I only learned about the cursed rings recently from Narcissa, but the matter is personal for me.” Harry ruffled his hair. “I was resigned to the fact that Draco plans to marry you, until she told me the truth. I love him, and Narcissa might have found a loophole. I just don’t know if Draco fancies me.”
Draco summoned all his courage to ask. “Would-would you explain to me as much of it as you are allowed to tell civilians, Granger?”
“Camera off!” Karamo yelled over his shoulder, while Antoni put a comforting hand on Draco’s shoulder.
And in Luna’s
Before Draco even noticed what he was doing, he had moved still closer to Potter, and put a hand on his arm. “You had to deal with things a teenager should never have to deal with. Things nobody should ever have to deal with. And they still try to claim you for their purposes, the yellow press spies on you, idiots try to douse you with love potions…”
Andie firecalled me today and asked if we could imagine getting married in Tonks cottage, because her healer said it’s not recommendable for her to travel with portkey for two years, because last time she travelled by portkey, she had an allergic reaction  to the portkey charm. The desensitizing potion has to be taken for two years before it has healed the allergy.
“This house is being affecting even house elves. Mr. Draco Malfoy is not being supposed to live here, he is being supposed to have the house decontaminated.” Resignation sounded from Dempy’s voice.
“Okay, okay, Harry is alright.” Draco conceded with a blush.
As if on command, the running commentary in his brain resumed.
by Edith Piaf
Of course, Draco would not consciously spoon Harry and allow his morning wood to get in touch with Harry. I should carefully scoot forward and get up.
“We spend the full moon on a warded piece of property. They acknowledge me as the pack leader, and I can encourage them to play until they fall asleep. The wolfsbane makes them less dangerous, but it doesn’t really make them comfortable with themselves either, but being around an Animagus does. While Wolfsbane potion reduces self-injuries by 50% and aggression against humans by 75%, a combination of the potion and an Animagus to accompany them reduces both by 100% according to my experience.” Harry gave Draco one of his stunning smiles.
“Harry, I thought of your list this morning, especially of the bouncy castles. The Burrow’s Quidditch meadow would be perfect for a few bouncy castles. Maybe one for the children and two for the grownups. I don’t think Ron or Pansy have ever been on a bouncy castle either. Would you mind if we join?” Hermione’s smug look as she spoke proved to Ron that she had a plan. He loved this look on her.
Draco had gotten used to not seeing colours, but there was one thing still in its original colour, Potter’s eyes. Their emerald green had still held its beauty. And, although he would not admit it to any living or dead soul, as a ghost he obviously could still appreciate looking at a fine arse. If only that arse didn’t belong to someone who would always hate him!
“Er, good afternoon, Mick, Malfoy, and to you as well,” he turned to Nippy.
“Would you rather eat something mild or something spicier?” Harry asked softly. “I’ve eaten here before. I could give you advice about it.”
“So, this manor is your house?” Karamo asked, when Malfoy Manor came into view.
Draco walked into the middle of the room, and the children made enough space for him that he could have transformed into an elephant. He concentrated and transformed into his unicorn form.
“You see me as a friend? Despite all the things I did?” Draco’s face felt terribly hot, yet it was a glorious feeling.
When Draco had calmed down a bit, Karamo continued speaking: “Let’s look at the present again. What have you been working on recently?”
Luna smiled warmly. “She’s preparing for a match. I’m looking forward to Sunday, after it. You know, after every match, we take some time just for ourselves.”
Conrad paused and stared at Draco. Then he spoke softly. “Remus Lupin was my cousin. But I hardly knew him. Many things I know about him now, I have learned from H. Granger’s book ‘Remus Lupin, Marauder and activist’, have you read it? After Remus was bitten, his parents isolated themselves. And then, we moved to France.” Conrad looked sad. “After he was bitten, I only met him once, I was 17, and he was 14, and it was obvious that he and his best friend Sirius fancied each other very much. It’s funny how I fell in love with the cousin of my cousin’s companion in life.”
“Fuck! And we don’t have a Portkey to get home with.”
“If I were still talking to mom and dad this would be the reason to cut the contact. But I haven’t talked to them since I started dating Mary’s mother. I practically live without a family apart from Precious and our two daughters. You can imagine why.” Dudley gave him a sad smile.
“If he can accept my financially limited and non-traditional means of courtship?” Draco feared that he didn’t have enough to offer.
“Harry, how do you really feel about being Draco’s best man?” Pansy leaned over to the Gryffindor.
“Good morning, handsome.” Draco picked up his wand, turned around, cast breath freshener charms on both of them and then kissed Harry soundly. Harry’s lips and his tongue felt perfect. Without even interrupting the kiss, Harry banished their t-shirts to the chair. He peppered little kisses across Draco’s neck and chest, then licked across Draco’s left nipple.
“Darling, I don’t know those creatures, but I trust your judgement.”
“Pop culture,” Harry and Draco corrected in unison.
“Malfoy, you – you look great.”
Draco had watched with extreme fascination, on their first visit to the Burrow, how Percy and George had been engrossed in a controversy about the necessity of submitting the same form to four different departments of the Ministry to keep George’s business licence. The brothers had exchanged words like “nitpicking” and “criminal negligence”.   Their argument had gone on for three hours. Then George had broken into a wide smile, said “guess we agree to disagree again. I have to go home, Lee promised to babysit, and we haven’t had time for kink in quite a while. Comes with having a toddler.”
Draco hesitated, and Dempy whispered in his ear: “Mr. Draco Malfoy should be doing what he is doing when he has been saying something embarrassing to Ms. Pansy Parkinson. Pretend nothing happened until someone brings it up.”
“I guess not.” Draco fell silent as the waitress approached with the menus. As she asked what they wanted to drink, Draco remembered that Potter wrote in one letter that he didn’t drink alcohol, because his drinking had been problematic in the first year after the war. So, he quickly ordered Shloer, his favourite Muggle soft drink, and the only posh thing he sometimes allowed himself these days.
THEIR FATHER was SAT THERE!
“You were how old when the war ended?” Antoni asked.
Harry put his hand on Dempy’s shoulder. “Let me guess, he’s too proud to ask a friend to let him stay with them for the time it takes?”
He padded downstairs, brewed a cup of Earl Grey tea and stared at the Wall.
The cat is an excellent breed with a good character, only he doesn’t like the name Theophanu gave him, it would be your task to give him a more appropriate name. Marv will be waiting for an answer as to when I can introduce the cat to you.
“Who would be so foolish as to brew in a kitchen? It might influence the potion or the food.” Draco drawled.
“And how many names have you called him in your life just to get his attention? We all saw you stare at his arse every single time he walked away. Both of you are still the same kind of emotionally constipated idiots. I bet you said something annoyingly prickly before he called you pointy. Don’t deny it, I know you, Draco.” Pansy gave him her sternest look.
Draco looked at their left arm, at their tattoo. The Dark Mark was still there, but Dean had given them a session with a Muggle tattoo artist for their last birthday.  The artist had tattooed in rainbow colours and in Dean’s handwriting above the Mark:
Harry laughed quietly despite himself and the weakness he felt. Voldyturd! He had never heard a house-elf swear before. He lay for a short moment before he gathered all his strength and conjured his Patronus. “Please, call Hermione to come here. It’s urgent. Magic drain due to dark residues in a house. Two cases.” He called weakly.
Carefully and slowly, Draco extracted his arm from around Harry’s chest, scooted back slowly, painstakingly trying to avoid pulling Harry’s hair, and got up. He snuck into the en-suite, cast a silencing charm, took off his silk pyjamas, stepped into the shower and rid himself of the inappropriate erection. Maybe he allowed himself to indulge a bit in the memory of Harry’s hair against his neck, and the feel of Harry’s nipples through the worn-thin cotton of his old Ramones t-shirt. But he did not scream “Harry” as he climaxed, at least he tried to convince himself afterwards that he had not done so. And there was nobody who could know better and call him a liar.
“I need to look good,” Harry told the stylist.
“Something with stars if his human name is a constellation,” another girl interjected. “Maybe Astrios.”
“Will you, Draco, protect the secret of my work as long as I am bound to it?” Hermione asked.
Rule number one: “It should elicit laughter from our valued customers”, didn’t help a bit. Neither did two: “No lingering effects, it’s a prank, not a curse”, three: “A good prank is like a song, not too short and not too long”, or four: “A Wheeze will never humiliate, shame, degrade, injure, or manipulate”. But Five! “If it doesn’t work, what alternative means could achieve the same effect? If Harry took Felix Felicis? No, that wouldn’t work, Harry was allergic to ginkgo aphids, and she wasn’t sure if the ginkgo leaves in the Felix Felicis were without aphids.
Another thing: What colour is guilt?” Karamo asked Draco.
“Harry, you may want to tickle him, but I think you want
Again, the Ministry cafeteria was decorated for Valentine Day, but now Draco was only a guest here. At the demand of the elves and with the support of Hermione and Minister Shacklebolt, he had replaced the former elf liaison official. Together with Ninty, he was now co-heading the newly established Subdepartment for elf and human cooperation.
The Floo roared to life in the sitting room, and a moment later, Draco heard the clicking of heels on the flagstones. “Draco, have you forgotten our brunch?”
When Malfoy didn’t say more, Harry turned to concentrate on the pancakes. They had to be the best pancakes Malfoy had ever eaten, not that Harry hoped to hear that from the blond, but nothing and nobody made him more ambitious than Malfoy, he wanted to impress him; he had learned from sixth year that not being acknowledged by Malfoy was unbearable.
“You think I haven’t spent the last year looking for a way out? What idea would I have today if I hadn’t already had it in the last 365 days? Maybe you should take the potion yourself. Oh wait, your abusive father died in the Battle of Hogwarts, and you wear the Armiger ring yourself, that I broke the curses on and on all your other family rings. Also you’re pansexual.” As soon as Draco had spoken it, he felt ashamed of lashing out.
“Mother, since when…” Draco’s voice sounded like a wounded animal. He had never told his mother that he was gay.
“Circe’s pierced nipples! You’re obtuse!” Pansy swore. At Narcissa’s stern look, she apologized and continued. “Have you ever heard someone mention reasonable political opinions in the most prominent place when they talk about their true love? You’d expect something like sexy, witty, or kind! But Draco’s only talking about political opinions and that she’s a very committed healer.”
“Of course, he’s obsessing, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t right about it.” The Weasel, of course.
“I will,” Draco said firmly. He remembered dreaming of becoming an Unspeakable as a kid. And he knew how important it was. A ring of magic from Harry’s wand wrapped itself around his wrist.
“Sparkling silver eyes, beautiful hands and the finest arse ever don’t qualify as insults.” Potter chuckled.
“Mr. Harry Potter, thank goodness, you is being calling. Mr. Draco Malfoy is needing Mr. Harry Potter, but he is being forbidding Dempy or the other elves to call Mr. Harry Potter. He is being in his lab and crying.”
“You weren’t tactless now, I was over-sensitive.”
“You were spooning me. No man has ever spooned me.”
“You’re an Auror, remind me how you’re this naïve?” Draco drawled. “The Cupid collided with me, and since then, I sometimes hear your thoughts. Someone was attempting to spy on you.”
“Why?” Draco asked.
Draco turned in for the night. He changed into his pyjamas then looked through the bookshelf for something readable. The only thing remotely interesting was an old copy of Hogwarts a History.
“Lucky Pawter,” Draco mumbled under his breath. “I wish I had someone to cuddle with once in a while. But no, Father made sure I would never get to be loved.”
An old secretary with a mullet and the name Karen Ashford asked them what they wanted.
“I promise to do what I can to help him bond with the house. Can you in turn tell me what outfit to ask Kreacher for?” Draco winked.
Wait – Is he really walking towards me? Draco looked around, all the tables around his were empty.
The blond took a bite, and a delighted look crossed his face for a moment, just to be replaced with a poker face immediately. “Your Muggle cooking isn’t half bad.”
Harry slowly drifted into a state closer to awakeness. He saw through his closed eyelids that the sun had risen already, he heard the birds sing outside the window, and he felt something firm and warm behind him and around his chest, something firm and warm that felt glorious. But it had to be a dream, it smelt like Draco, and Draco would never cuddle up and spoon him. Slowly the memory came back to him that he was sleeping in Draco’s bed because Pansy was sleeping in his bed, and the charm that conjured the board in the middle of the bed must have worn off.
Harry conjured his Patronus, and it seemed to Draco that it shone brighter than ever. The stag was sent off with the message. “Come through, please. We’re in the drawing room.”
“We’ll take the vegetable pakoras for starters, and we don’t know about the rest yet.” Harry said, and Draco was just grateful for not needing to speak.
“Actually, there are only a few rules, and most of them are about communication and one is about where you can brew next week. My first rule is you’ll stop calling me by my last name. I believe flatmates should be on first name terms.”
The evening was a success; it seemed as if everyone was as happy to tear down House borders as Harry and Draco were. At 1 am, after Dean and Seamus had left, only Hermione, Ron and Pansy were still around. They were all sitting on the three-seated sofa and talking too quietly for Harry and Draco to hear, although Harry noticed Pansy’s hand landed on Hermione’s knee whenever she stopped gesticulating.
“The Golden Boy and his fans,” Draco muttered, as Harry ushered him to a visitor sofa, while Ron, O’Dell, and Shahin moved towards the other side of the room to greet Robards.
“I can’t let you Apparate out, at this time of the night, you’d splinch yourselves,” Harry declared. You all can sleep here tonight. One guestroom is free, and I’ll prepare my own bed for Pansy and sleep on the sofa.” Harry quickly responded.
The hand moved away again, gliding first across the pillow, then ghosting over bare nipples. Draco didn’t need to know that Harry slept topless.
Hermione knelt on the other one and took Draco’s hand. “Harry, your wand. You know the ritual from when we had to cooperate on the Wessex case.”
“Mal-Malfoy!” Harry brought out, and the dam behind his eyes broke. He cried on Ron’s shoulder, sobbing desperately.
Do you remember my adoptive sister who is in Magical Games and Sports? She organized a group of work colleagues working for the WWN to volunteer and give some rooms of the orphanage, where I’m teaching pre-Hogwarts classes, a makeover.
“Harry, if I can give you some advice, arrange playdates for Meow and Paw with Draco.” Mick said placatingly.
“Nah, Daphne can help her better, also, I had to see my best friend and wish him good luck. Remember, I have something for you.” She pulled a small parcel from her pocket and put it in his hand.
“Mary, thank god, I was so worried.” Harry didn’t even need to look around. He would always have recognized Dudley’s voice and his Surrey accent. The girl flung herself into Dudley’s arms.
“Well, yes, how do other wizards manage to wear them all the time? I feel like I’m wrapped up in theatre curtains.” As if to prove his point, he pulled at the fabric of his robe collar.
“Follow me.” He pulled Draco into the house and into the guest room that had been built after the war, the room where he usually slept when he stayed overnight. He noticed that it was neater than he had ever seen it before, but then he was too busy undressing Draco to really give it a second thought.
They sat down on Harry’s bed, Harry stroked over Draco’s chest. It felt so good.
“You can’t do that, Uncle Harry, the other cat loves their human, too. You know, Mikey Dawlish from my nursery school group said he didn’t like me because my hair is blue and he doesn’t like blue, and I asked him what his favourite colour was, and he said green. I made my hair green for a whoooole storytime for him, and then for a few shorter times when he asked me to, and now we are friends. He even got to like blue. Maybe if you talk to them, they will be your friend, too. And now, in second form, Mikey is sitting next to me too.” Teddy explained with excitement.
A knock at the windowsill drew his attention. A graceful tawny owl with a dreamcatcher around his neck stood on the windowsill and awaited his beckoning.
I promise, and I would be ready anytime to take Veritaserum and prove, that every word I said about my thoughts and feelings in my letters to you were the truth. Yet, I couldn’t blame you if you were to think I just want to get into people’s good graces again. That’s literally what I hear every time I do something that helps people.
“You have grown to be a good man.”
Nippy opened a cerulean blue door, and behind it, the two cats were dozing on a large pillow by a warm sunny window. Their bodies looked like a perfect, two-coloured heart. Draco approached the cats, and carefully placed a hand on Paw’s back. Paw grumbled, then started lazily licking Meow’s fur as if to show Draco that he was very much not impressed with Draco’s behaviour of waking him.
Harry was grateful to Luna for having given him the address of a boarding cattery in Catford, which she had taken her four cats to when need arose, too.
It was Draco’s voice, but it came from outside, rather like an echo of his voice, but Draco was sure that the anger wasn’t his.
“Were the MacDougal diamonds invented by Morag MacDougal?” Draco tried to distract himself.
“Let’s turn to the good things you did in your life so far. What are you proud of doing? Put Legos for it on the empty scale pan.” Karamo lifted the box with the colourful Legos towards Draco.
I will be at the Lakshmi’s tomorrow at seven, and if you don’t come, that’s okay.
“Er, I wanted to buy a present for my goddaughter, but of course. We can have a cup of coffee and catch up.” Had Mary not been there, he would have declined, but the girl made him curious. He distinctly remembered Uncle Vernon’s racist slurs, but Dudley had obviously a child with a black mother, maybe he had overcome some of his prejudices.
“No, but he doesn’t know I’m Draco Malfoy.” Draco sighed.
“Do you really think I can wear this?” Potter asked.
He ascended the stairs to look at the mezzanine, where there was the sitting room, a large kitchen, and a room that could be used as dining room or an office. Or, if there was someone in the family with difficulties with climbing stairs, as a bedroom. It was big enough for any of these purposes. Opposite the spare room was a fully furnished bathroom with an easily accessible shower. The kitchen and bathroom overlooked the front garden, as he saw when he opened the fir green shutters.
That evening, Luna visited Mick. “Guess what: Harry and Draco finally made it. Our plot worked out.”
Harry reached out his hand, but then reminded himself that comforting touches weren’t possible.
“Yes, if I’m able to help,” he answered.
“No appetite today. Listen, I’m sorry. You probably heard me wank. That was an awful idea.” Harry looked so small and sad.
“They don’t calm down, do they?” Malfoy didn’t look Harry in the eyes, but Harry considered it already a little success that Malfoy didn’t insult him.
“Good morning. Yes, that’s Opaleye, but his real name is Draco.”
“You told me that your relatives didn’t want you, but you never told me how abusive they were.” Draco knew very well why Harry hadn’t told him back then. He might have believed that his father had a point in his views, unlike now, when Draco had contact with Muggles like Keiko and knew that one abusive couple was not representative for Muggles in general. “I wish my father had gotten them instead of all those innocent Muggles.”
Draco had often dreamt of sitting on a broom behind Harry. Most often, they were nightmares of the Fiendfyre, but sometimes they were just flying over the Forbidden Forest and gazing over centaurs and other forest creatures below.
Draco was impressed at how much Potter noticed Meow’s likes and dislikes and adapted to them. He had always thought Potter was someone who expected others to adapt to him. But indeed, Potter seemed to be rather someone who had to be reminded to consider his own needs and wishes, too.
“I’m fine, but if you don’t mind, you know, Draco is my best friend and it feels awkward if his flatmate is on last name terms with me. Also, thank you for finally getting him out of the Manor.” Parkinson’s voice sounded weak as if she were summoning all her courage to make conversation. That was probably the case, as they hadn’t had much contact after her letter of apology in their eighth year.
And with every step on this way, Draco had seen more that someone choosing twice to serve a Dark Lord, would never be the brightest light on the chandelier.
After the Legilimens, frantic activity broke loose in the DMLE. Weasley told Potter that it was a case for the stalker drill, but possibly more dangerous, the perp might be a neo-Deatheater. Then he sent three Patronus messages, first to Head Auror Robards, then to two other Aurors, and last a very cryptic one that moved towards the lift: “Brightest Cat, Fresh Pickled Toad has been compromised.”
“Merlin, I never thought I’d say such a thing in my life, but change your clothes and never try dress robes again. You look so uncomfortable it itches me when I look at you. I would recommend a nice Muggle suit for your wedding.”
As soon as Draco and Paw had disappeared in the Floo, Meow released a heartbroken yowl.
Dear Draco,
beget children through something called surrogacy. Please, consider doing so. Don’t
“Sorry, I’ve never tried wearing lace. But if you want me to, I will.” Harry said shyly.
As Ginny stepped through the Floo in their living room, one look at Luna showed her that she was feeling sad, too. She was lying on the sofa and staring into a middle distance.
“As long as you don’t take drugs…” Hermione put on her parental look.
Draco went into the other room, which was now furnished as a sitting room and study. Here, too, the furniture was modern but made of natural wood. He looked at the blue sofa, and at the mural above it, a picture of a rainbow over a landscape in the Scottish Highlands. Draco smiled. This landscape reminded him of watching Potter near the Quidditch pitch.
But Draco put his arm around him and Merlin’s balls, that felt good!
“Er, I may or may not sometimes fantasise about him and me, you know, shagging?” Harry ruffled his hair.
“I’m glad my wife and I had our Draco while we were young. It’s a wonderful feeling to hold your child in your arms for the first time.”
Harry chuckled. He had grown very fond of Mary in the last two days. Dudley and Precious were very welcoming, and Harry saw that Precious had a very good influence on his cousin.
“You are…” Harry started, not knowing what he wanted to say, except that Malfoy was worth a lot. But Ron interrupted him.
Ron gave Seamus a grateful look. “You guys are the best!”
Harry’s Spellphone chimed with a soft ring indicating the arrival of a message.
“It was okay. I wasn’t very productive. The press conference…”  Draco leaned against Harry.
(If getting into people’s good graces were my aim in life, I would never have returned to Britain in the first place.)
Draco wanted to melt into it, but instead, he pulled away. It seemed the safer option.
“I believe we both deserve better than to be trapped in a compulsory marriage. Tell Astoria, that I was glad when she refused to marry me. The only reason I didn’t refuse was that I didn’t have the courage. I’m glad she had it. I only feel free to be myself now that Father is deceased.” He gave them a smile when they didn’t flinch at his words.
It was the signal for Draco to get on the stage. They strutted in their yellow high-heeled boots, wearing a white jumpsuit with see-through stripe legs.  Completing the whole ensemble was a rainbow tulle robe with an empire waist.
“Did he write that he would hate you?” Tan placed a hand on Draco’s arm. It felt weird but comforting to get such a gesture from someone who was no relative of his.
“What about your father? Didn’t he give you hugs when you were small?” Karamo asked softly.
Working in the kitchen alongside the elves was actually not so bad. They had taught him the Elvish language, and among themselves they were very different from what Draco had seen from House Elves in his youth. Some had a wicked sense of humour and loved to banter with him. Also, they treated him almost like one of their own, and where they treated him differently, it was things like not being able to  Apparate inside the Ministry, where they had to sidealong him, and that he needed explanations on their customs.
“She is being asking him to move in with a friend, but she can’t be offering him a room in her apartment, she is having only one room. And she is wanting to have overnight guests who are being actually interested in mating with her.” Dempy said shyly.
He startled awake in the middle of the night by a weird sensation in his chest and his right hand.
The Legos on and beside the scale turned grey.
“You can talk to Luna, she’s coming here in a few minutes, as well as your mother, they both will join the cooking class, at least the first part.” Karamo added.
Both looked at him. “Why would I be happy?” Astoria asked back. “My father sold my hand in marriage as if I weren’t a person. For a fucking holiday cottage near Stonehenge!”
A knock at the door interrupted his brooding. He got up, and only when he had already opened the door, did he remember he should have cast a glamour to hide how exhausted he was looking.
Lucius caught himself. “But - but shouldn’t a Malfoy have ambition? And all Draco does is strut around on that stage in women’s clothes, make jokes and si-”
“Mx Mick Bulstrode is being very accurate. Nippy has seen Mr. Draco Malfoy staring at Mr. Harry Potter and then Mr. Draco Malfoy smelled strongly of mating hormones.” Nippy smiled at Mick and her fidgeting looked more of excitement than nervousness now. When half an hour the Floo chimed, and Draco stepped through, Nippy seemed rather smug.
After the second time they passed a wizard and just managed to cast a Notice-me-not on time, Harry said shyly. “Draco, this doesn’t mean we have to do anything, but I would like to spend more time with you tonight, but be far away from the public. Would you mind spending the rest of the evening with me in Grimmauld Place?”
When he had calmed down, he said: “Sorry, Malfoy, I didn’t know they were such idiots, they hadn’t talked to me but only to my boss.”
very well.
“No, for my ex-boyfriend’s wedding on Saturday.” Harry ruffled his hair.
She Accioed her handwoven bag and took a cat tower, a cat bed, a self-cleaning litter box, a tray with two bowls and five cartons of different cat food sachets from it. Finally, she brought out a brush. “Remember, he needs to be brushed every single day, needs his water changed twice a day, and you need to take him to the cat healer twice a year. But the cat healer will owl you if you allow her to.”
“Er, it’s a great honour to be his best man. It shows that our working together as cursebreakers is more than a work cooperation. We’ve come a long way since our Hogwarts days.” It was not all that he felt about it, but the rest was his probem and his problem alone.
Draco should feel at ease, but their stomach kept on churning. Why was Harry nervous? Had they done something wrong? Or was Harry in danger? Or Ron? Were the Aurors investigating something that might be connected to Draco’s parents? Draco had to pull themself together and get on the fucking stage. They could talk to Harry afterwards.
“Thank you, Kreacher. This is the perfect bedtime read.” Draco smiled at the elf.
“Sit down, please.” Draco was shocked at how scared he was that Potter might really walk away.  “Of course, I want you around. I – You came here, fully aware that it’s me.”
“And about your bum on a broom since Fourth year.” Pansy looked at him directly. “Also, what do you think of a bloke who confides in me that he’s worried about his performance, because he has only ever desired one person and brews a love potion to dose himself with for the wedding night.”
When we have arranged for a celebrant for our wedding, I’ll make sure Mr. Potter gets an invitation, too. Do you think he would agree to come to my wedding, maybe even to sit at the head table with us?
Take good care of yourself and answer me soon.
Harry pushed Draco’s knickers down. He trailed kisses over his chest and abs again, down, down, down, then nuzzled Draco’s cock. He licked over the vein, then took Draco’s length in his mouth and swallowed around it. He bobbed his head, looking up into Draco’s eyes. Draco lost track of time, he was all feeling and hearing and moaning. Too soon, his balls drew up, and all he got out was “Harry, gonna…” before he came.
In the background he heard Sirius bark a laugh and Professor Lupin say “like father like son” with a grin in his voice.
“Your git.”
“And I get lots of half-witted letters from anyone who wants to run for any kind of office and tries to persuade me to support them. Sometimes they try to trick me into supporting things that are the opposite of what I believe in.” Potter barked out a humourless laugh.
Draco read the letter again. He had taken a vacation for the next week. But this time, there was more to organize. Where could he leave Pawter? Pansy’s crup had whined a lot the last time they had visited him. He had been afraid of Pawter. And Blaise was in Canada for a modeling job. Greg had enough to do with his bakery, he wouldn’t have time to care for a cat. And Theo? You wouldn’t let Theo care for a cactus, let alone a cat that had a very Gryffindor-esque personality.
He shook his head, took his wand out of his hidden sleeve pocket and cast a Homenum Revelio. Nothing happened. The corridor was dark, and pressing the light switch didn’t change a thing. Harry cast a Lumos and checked. There was no light bulb in the lamp on the ceiling, but the stairs looked as if the water from cleaning them had only just dried.
The first thing Draco saw of the Hippogriff’s Nest was a bleak corridor with yellow stains scattered across the upper half of the wall.
“Harry, think of your plan for your next weekend with Teddy.” She said softly.
“But what can I do then?” Harry didn’t know what to do, a cursed heir ring could do a lot of harm.
“Carrots? I’ll wait for hours if I get all the carrots I can eat.”  The gnome hopped up and down flapping his wings.
“Lie back, Draco. I’ll take care of you. I’ll make you feel so good.” Harry followed Draco as he lay back, kissed a trail from his collarbone to his left nipple, and sucked on it.
Everyone greeted each other with hugs, and Draco was surprised at how easily his mother opened up to the show hosts.
“And then, suddenly he was brought into my home as a captive, and I was asked if I recognized him. I knew him, even though his face was distorted, I could never have not recognized him. His magic and his scent are unmistakable. But I told my aunt I can’t be sure it’s him. He grabbed my wand, and my hand let go of it after only a mock fight. And later, he saved my life. Of course, he was far out of my league, and after the war we saw each other twice. Once at the trial, and once when he gave me my wand back. I have no idea what my pen friend looks like, but he is the only one for whom I have a similar feeling when I get his letters. But - how can I? I have this.” He pointed at his Dark Mark.
“What are you talking about. I’m creepy. Like, stalker creepy.” A sob shook Harry’s back.
“Just Draco. And what’s your name?” Draco smiled at him.
“Kreacher, can you give me a piece of cloth to transfigure into lingerie?” Draco asked.
“I don’t think he would do that. The person who connected you both with each other is Luna. She’s your friend. She would never have done so, if she didn’t know that he believes in giving people a second chance.” Antoni said reassuringly.
Draco felt Harry wanking and fingering himself harder and harder now. He himself gasped and writhed, and his breath was probably in sync with Harry’s.
Faux-Draco yelled, and Draco slowly came to realize what was going on. He was hearing a nightmare of Harry’s.
“You called me by my first name?” Draco’s voice sounded embarrassingly squeaky.
Dinner was as every evening -- with the exception of Friday, Potter’s pub night and Saturday’s dedicated to the ex-Slytherins’ get-together  -- where Draco and Potter would eat together, then sit on the sofa in the TV room to watch a movie or a quiz show or take turns reading for each other. To Draco’s amazement, they had the same taste in movies and books, and loved to make every quiz show a competition of who would come up with the most hilarious wrong answers. It all would have been most pleasant, if only Draco were still able to cast a successful Flaccidus. Only when it was time for bed, did Draco floo home with Pawter, just like almost every evening.
A few seconds later, Ron Apparated into the room, then greeted Harry, and — to his great surprise — Draco with a hug and said “You won’t guess who the perp is.”
with Great-Grandfather Achilles. From the things he told me, I assume you know him
“We’ve just had our first date yesterday, but I’ve known him since we were eleven, and I have yet to see a side of him that I don’t love. So, I bet that I can love everything of him.” Draco blushed.
The air seemed to stir behind Harry, and he heard Malfoy’s voice drawl: “Mr. O’Dell owns a tattoo shop and Mrs. and Mrs. Yusufi…”
Draco stared at the Daily Prophet’s front page with a picture of Potter and Ginevra Weasley sitting together in a café and laughing. “I’m apparently bonded to Harry Potter.”
Luna was dressed in her typical unorthodox style, and his mother was wearing a modest  dress, but her posture made her still look like a grande dame.
the third program, was in its fourth day. The house had been sold out the last three days. Blaise had informed them earlier that day that tonight would be no different, concluding from the number of reservations.
He followed the men to their black car in a daze.
Slytherins! It had taken the Slytherins years to rehabilitate themselves enough that everyone of Harry’s age and younger got half the chances everyone else got. The three years after the war had no First Year Slytherins, partly because the students refused to accept being sorted into Slytherin, partly because anybody sorted into Slytherin was transferred by their parents to Beauxbatons or Durmstrang immediately. Only when Slytherin was opened to Muggleborns, and the new Muggle Studies teacher Andromeda Tonks became head of House, did that change.
The money he made with it, went completely into a foundation for Muggleborns who were injured during the war. For Draco, it was enough that he could spend some time gardening. It felt like he was healing the grounds gradually. He loved it.
“Darling, what’s wrong?” She walked over, cast an expansion charm on the sofa and lay down beside her fiancée.
The waiter ushered Draco to a table that overlooked the door and the window. He sat down and waited for Prongs. Would Prongs show up? He hadn’t answered the letter. It might be because Draco had taken too long to send it, but what if Prongs wanted nothing to do with Draco Malfoy?
Lucius opened and closed his mouth a few times. Then he resigned to the fact that he couldn’t answer with dignity.
“He will. Remember, Fred and George were the only ones who could tell Peeves what to do.”
“Malfoy, as a ghost you have three options. Either you haunt at random until batshit crazy Muggles come here and ask you about whether their dead grandma has hidden treasures in her garden, or you pretend you don’t exist, or you let us who know about you and think you deserve a decent afterlife help you. And if you didn’t get it when I spoke for you at your trial, I don’t consider you an enemy, and haven’t in years.” Potter ruffled his hair and sat down on the ground.
“But you should pop over to Draco’s and take the gnome with you.” Pansy reminded them.
Harry turned around and yelled “I thought we were friends, George!”
Yes! Dennis was just as interested in Draco and Astoria not getting married as Harry! She would give the Felix Felicis to Dennis. He could probably drink it and be lucky today.
“You know, Ron and I don’t want every experiment we get up to commented by George. Especially considering if he might interpret it as a marriage crisis and alert Molly.”  Hermione tugged at her bracelet, as she would sometimes do when she was feeling nervous.
“Now?”
Harry nodded.
Karamo put a hand on his arm. “Giving and getting hugs is a healthy thing. And regardless of your past, you deserve to accept love into your life.”
“I’ve had my share of flavours of the day, and all of them were just different kinds of stale for me. If we’re on the same page, I want us to be together for real. I want you to be my boyfriend, I want our friends to know we’re together. And I would like it to last.” Harry took Draco’s hand.
A door opened behind him, and he quickly spun around.
“Good afternoon to you, too, Potter.” Draco drawled.
He couldn’t just disappear during the show, not when Miss Greengrass was there and was his last hope for the survival of the Malfoy name.
“Says the man who calls his cat Paw, his horse Hoof, and his snake Limbless!” Harry deadpanned, as the three people and the house elf made their way through the long corridor.
Draco rolled his eyes, but felt fondness for his best friend. “Pans, do you really think I don’t know that? You know about the DMLE’s behaviour towards me, from me.”
“He didn’t live to teach you the charms to bond the house to your magic? It would adapt to your needs and wishes if you could cast them.” Draco hoped that Aunt Bella would suffer in the afterlife for all eternity.
Nippy blushed and smiled. “Mr. Draco Malfoy, Nippy is being happy to meet you and happy to have taken care of Paw. He is being such a lovely cat.”
They didn’t know why the air seemed to be thrumming in a different way tonight from what they were used to. But Harry had been nervous all day, too. He had denied it, but Draco knew him.
“Sorry to interrupt, Dennis, Astoria. Did I hear that you aren’t happy about the wedding?” Harry asked.
And if he was honest with himself, he had to thank Ginevra Weasley for knowing who was hugging him as if he were an old friend of them and not Deatheater scum. Because it had been Ginevra who had insisted on a televisual, when Luna and she had moved in together. He was amazed that he remembered the men so well after watching their show only once.
“I think I’ll have a little chat with Kingsley about Dawlish when this is over. Because I asked and you had the right to have visitors.” Harry growled.
“But I can’t…”
“But you don’t know if the cat is a girl. What if that’s a boy, too?” Lucy asked.
It would make me happy to see you in person if you were still ready to see your friend Opaleye in me. However, there is a big risk that as soon as you see me face to face, you will immediately hate me, and I’d rather not see your face if I learned that you do so.
Malfoy washed the shampoo out, and massaged a hair mask into the lengths of Harry’s hair. “Your hair needs more moisture, you have such a gorgeous hair structure, but nobody ever taught you how to take good care of it.”
“You lived in a manor with lots of antique furniture,” Bobby started the conversation. “What style period do you like best?”
This chapter is a bit sad; we reach the peak of the angst; but I promise the next chapter will bring hope.
“Who are you and what have you done to Potter? Your behaviour is far too Slytherin.” Malfoy exclaimed softly as his magic tried to push Harry’s out.
Their next stop was a Muggle boutique. Tan made him try on different outfits, and Draco’s favourite one was a flowy, white shirt that made him look androgynous.
“Lucky you, it must be amazing to be a felismouth.” Luna’s eyes looked even dreamier than they would usually.
Draco brewed his tea as he would brew a potion, with the same attention and focus. Making the right blend of Dittany Oolong and Shrivelfig Assam was a high art his mother had taught him. To be honest, if he thought he could get customers, he might consider opening a tea shop. Maybe he should do that somewhere on the Continent, like in France or Italy, where the name Malfoy was rather unknown.
“Okay, okay.” Draco opened the parcel and brought out a small vial with a gold-shimmering potion. He glared at it for a while, then whisper-yelled. “Felix Felicis? Have you forgotten that the Rhizoctonia Mandragorae in the Redirector Infatuationis potion and the sweet clover in the Felix Felicis form a toxin when they interact? I owe Astoria a satisfactory performance if we are supposed to get married and to … consummate our marriage.”
“Mr. Draco Malfoy could be going to Mr. Harry Potter,” Dempy suggested with a shy smile.
As he tried to turn, the gate through which he had entered was gone. But there was another gate on the other side.  Harry appeared in it, and just when Harry had passed through it, the wall closed behind him.
He put the key with the hexagonal head into the lock and turned it. A scent that seemed vaguely familiar hit him. And he saw a corridor of Hogwarts before his inner eye and felt a wave of excitement, but he just couldn’t grasp what the exciting thing was. The memory was weirdly cut off, but there was this mix of adrenaline and feeling alive with it.
“Yassss, Queen!” Jonathan cheered.
Draco’s comment showed Harry in what a bad state Malfoy really was. If he were to stay here for but one more night, Malfoy would die.
She Accioed the remote control and turned on Netflix. As they chose the show, Ginny had an idea. Hadn’t Lee told her something interesting about the new program WWN Televisual was producing? Where they had to get a special licence to tell four Muggles about magic?
Draco’s spellphone chimed at this moment.
Yours,
“Die.” Malfoy sighed. He suddenly looked weary.
“Splinched off his nose? You mean, he didn’t lose it to a curse or because he became more snakelike?” Draco gave Sirius an incredulous look.
“I like going to the Muggle park sometimes in summer. There I can forget who I am and just be a person sitting on a blanket in the grass and reading a book in the sun.”
“But – but my hair always looks like a bird’s nest, and I have this ugly scar on my face and…  he never liked the way I smell.” Harry loathed that his voice sounded so small, like that of a frightened child.
Don’t get me wrong, I love to be there for the kids, for my found family and friends. And I love being able to use my privileges to help others, but today I finally got the message my best friend also keeps telling me, that I can’t sidealong anybody if I’m too exhausted to Apparate.
A moving picture showed Meowfoy lying on a sunny spot on the ground with a black cat. The golden sunlight cast intricate patterns across them as they were licking each other’s fur.
, telling some more jokes.  Knowing they were failing miserably at putting on a show this evening. They tried during the song to focus on their Patronus memory, going with Harry to pick Rose Weasley for an afternoon at the cinema, and Molly telling her: “Listen to your godparents.” The day they had felt for the first time that even the Weasley Matriarch accepted and trusted them - which was frankly a huge deal, as she was convinced that their father had been one of the five Death Eaters involved in the killing of her brothers who had escaped justice. Draco couldn’t even begin to imagine how much it must have taken her initially to remind herself again and again that Draco was not like Lucius Malfoy.
