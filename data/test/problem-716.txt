Narcissa had already thought about it “We will take her, I can’t have anymore kids and a daughter is what we wanted to have after Draco” Lucius nodded his head in agreement.
Ron nodded his head slowly not believing what he was seeing “yea ok mate I get that but tell me why he is in your bed with you” He asked?
Both families got ready and flooed to the leaky cauldron, Lucius was the last with both boys to arrive. They walked out to Diagon Ally and made their way to Gringotts, they knew this moment would probably change everything for them. This was the beginning of what they were dreading but also knowing that it was bound to happen.
Sirius nodded his head and stood up and put his vial in the goblet first, he then put Remus’s vial in second. He got out his wand and put it over the goblet and started chanting “sicut superius, et inferius, sicut intus, sic non” Sirius stopped chanting and put his wand away.
Once they both came downstairs and Sirius sat Harry down they got to eating, laughing at Harry eating his own food. With dinner done Remus gave Harry a bath and put him in his pajama’s, and brought him into the living room to play with some of the new toys.
Walking to the atrium to floo back to Malfoy Manor was crazy for Narcissa, she was mad and upset when Lucius told her what he did.
He said goodnight to his friends and got in bed and laid down and closed his eyes, he heard in his mind “goodnight master Harry, sweet dreams” he smiled at that and slowly fell asleep. He didn’t know what his future at Hogwarts would hold with Dumbledore trying things, but he knew with his friends and Hogwarts herself with him he could take anything.
So sorry it has taken me awhile to put up a new chapter, the characters have decided to change up my whole plot, so I have a new idea and I will admit  the new plot is better then the old plot. I hope to have chapter 3 up sooner then this one was, I am writing now, and my cousin will edit it and then I will get it up after. Please feel free to comment if you have questions or ideas. Subscribe if you want and leave kudo's if you so desire and bookmare if you please. Thank you to everyone who has done any of those it means alot to me and my cousin. I can't tag him because he doesn't have an account on here. Now I will quit with the note and onto the story.
Sirius nods, unable to find words as Remus takes the letter guiding him to the bed where Remus laid down and pulled Sirius down with him, laying him on his chest as he rubbed his hand though his hair, “do you want to read it now or later.”
The door opened and in walked Ron and Hermione holding hands, Ron looked nervous as all get out and Hermione just looked confused.
“This is my husband Lucius, and our little boy Draco, Welcome to Malfoy Manor” Narcissa said smiling making sure to introduce her family.
Sirius chuckled “that is an understatement love.” He let a sigh, “no point trying to sleep, why don’t you go shower, I’ll start collecting things we need for the will reading tomorrow” he spoke his voice shaky and crackly.
“The baby is perfectly fine she was with the babysitter at the time, her name is Hermione Jean Granger, we can do everything tonight and be done with it” Amelia said.
Sirius put Harry in his dress robes and said a spell and when Harry tried to take off his robes again nothing happened.
Remus nodded his head and got the baby bag and told Sirius to get Harry and together they walked to the living room where the fireplace sat.
Looking down he saw a paper there all he saw was James name and he jumped up tears still rolling down his face. “Sirius,” Remus said his voice full of concern at his boyfriend’s tears as he noticed the shimmering paper. “A letter from James,” he asked walking over to comfort his lover.
Draco for his part leaned up and kissed Harry’s lips softly, the kiss slowly started to heat up and they fell back into bed and under the covers.
Together they walked to the study and when Sirius opened the door Narcissa was shocked to see a baby laying in a basinet.
He felt like this was where he was supposed to be, the voice was still soft but clear, but it was getting louder. Right when he stepped foot inside Hogwarts this blast of energy and power washed through him. The voice was loud “Welcome home Master Harry, Hogwarts Welcomes you back home” the voice said. He knew right then and there that Hogwarts herself was talking to him and it was shocking. He tried to talk back to her in his mind of course he didn’t want to look like a crazy person “hello, will you talk to me all the time, and can you understand me” he said in his mind.
Walking out of the room he walked into Harry’s rom and kissed his forehead, he was happy that Harry took to Luna so fast.
Gurlok snapped his fingers and the goblet disappeared “now that the adoption is done he is fully your son congratulations. Now even though he is your son he keeps everything from the Potters, that was rightfully his from birth” Gurlok said.
Sirius and Remus where shocked at the last one neither one of them knew that about Lily though that one came as a shock.
This time it was different this week it was longer, and Ron was beginning to worry about his best friend.
Harry was shocked at that he had no idea that Dumbledore was that evil “but why did he kill them” he asked. “Well kiddo he wanted something from you that he though if you were dead and so were James and Lily the will he forged would go to” Sirius said. “Harry you are powerful, James and Lily both are descendants of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff” Remus said.
Draco for his part laughed softly leaning up and kissing Harry’s neck softly knowing that rest was over, and he wanted more of his boyfriend.
Harry looked over at Draco who was laying back with his hands over his head smirking wearing Harry’s quidditch jersey.
The day came for Harry to head to Hogwarts the little family gathered in the kitchen one last time to eat breakfast. It was quiet no one wanted to say anything, they wanted to take in this moment. After breakfast Harry pot his trunk and Owl and they flooed to Kings Cross station, they landed right on platform 9 ¾.
“As for Remus I am not sure if you knew that you are a direct descendent of Rowena Ravenclaw” Gurlok said. Remus was shocked himself no one had told him this at all, of course his father didn’t really care about that stuff.
It was the end of January and this whole week Harry has been missing when he or Hermione has been looking for him. That wasn’t anything new since they got back from Christmas break Harry would go missing for a couple of hours.
“Well I never have been talked to like that in my life, I am here to see Harry Potter thank you very much” she said loudly so everyone could hear. The name Harry Potter was a name that everyone would get sad to hear. Molly though had been told by Dumbledore that Sirius’s son was Harry Potter and that when the time come to have her son Ron become his friend.
Remus looked at his boyfriend “I sent a letter to Gringotts stating that we would be for the reading of James Potters will” He told his boyfriend. Sirius nodded his head as he had a mouth full of food. Remus continued “I told them that James left the will in a stack of papers that no one can open but the Potter Manager, and we would be in soon” he said.
Sirius said ok and got up and told him he would give Harry a bath while Remus cleaned up the kitchen. Remus laughed and then groaned looking at the mess but started to clean anyways, after the kitchen was clean he went upstairs to get dressed himself.
James made sure Sirius swore on a wizard’s oath not to do anything stupid should something happen. James knew that if something where to happen that Sirius would do something stupid and get himself in trouble.
“No when you sign these papers Harry will be both of your responsibilities, now if you both where to get married and wanted to adopt him by blood then we would do that here” he told both men.
Once they all were dressed they floo’ed to the Leaky Cauldron and went into Diagon Ally, they went straight to the bank. Once they were in Gringotts they asked for Gurlok the Potter Manager.
Lucius and Narcissa stood up and walked around and kissed Draco’s cheek and told him they loved him.
Hermione put the bookmark in her book and looked up at her boyfriend and smiled a small smile at him quick. She was happier then she had been in a long time, she had a boy who loved her for who she was.
“Good. Every wandmaker should feel connected to their work. This is… new though. And pretty,” she added. “My wands never do such a lovely thing.”
Admiring Draco’s propensity for mellow sexual sadism, Harry breathed through his arousal, trying to mentally detach himself from the movement. Shallow breaths to match the thrusts in his arse which were still determinedly aimed just…
did too. So… something wasn’t right. And I kind of… I’d started to wonder about all those times when I’d wanted to speak to you and hadn’t managed to do it. I wanted to see what would happen if I told him I was keen to approach you on
“I didn’t want Michael to be in charge. His temper was often too… frayed, if he didn’t get his own way.” Harry remembered that with pinpoint clarity. “I was… worried that I kept seeing people agreeing with him, even when he was clearly wrong. And I realised that’s what
“Oh,” Harry yawned. “Can’t it wait ‘til my alarm clock blares that horrendous noise you charmed it to make?”
Harry heaved in air as he recovered, only vaguely registering the relocation of fingers from his anus to his arse cheek. His attention snapped back into focus though when those fingers squeezed his painful skin. But squeezing shortly turned to light caressing and Harry was glad of the respite.
Now, as he lay carefully motionless in bed, an important factor occurred to Draco: he no longer appeared to be alone. Draco was stretched on his right side, stomach angled slightly towards the mattress, and an unfamiliar weight was draped along his back and tangled with his legs. Also, judging by the lack of light, it didn’t seem to be morning yet.
The mentioned pillow thumped off Harry’s face as it was abruptly returned to him. Harry instinctively caught it in both hands, wondering if this meant he was destined to do without the fun after all.
So, all that was required was for Harry to do that for Draco. And although Harry had no intentions of deliberately rushing this, a sense of schoolboy competition still lingered. Fuck him or not, Draco had said, the perfect opposite of coercion. But Draco had also issued a challenge, and it would be unreasonably out of character for Harry to back down from it.
Harry’s face had been beginning to cool but flared up again as he recalled the noise he’d made. Draco merely appeared smiling and satisfied.
“No.” Potter’s determination crumbled to dismay, which wasn’t nearly as pleasing as it should’ve been. “Not today,” he added to allay Potter’s gloom. Draco really needed to quash these impulsive acts of charity. “I should go.”
at the same time. Panting hard with every stroke of Malfoy’s penis over his prostate, Harry wanted Malfoy to wrap his fist around Harry’s throbbing cock and wank him roughly until he screamed, but Harry also wanted Malfoy to deny him that privilege.
to ask, but communication was apparently a good thing and the insistent hardness in his jeans was egging him on. What was the worst that could happen… mockery, derision, undisguised insults… Harry loved all of those from Draco within the right context. Maybe Harry could somehow swing Draco’s resulting anger around to a good punishing sub session if this suggestion fell flat.
She's right, so I stand up take a deep breath trying to hold myself together thinking I'm about to see the love of my life break my heart.
To start the morning I got up super early and I made Draco one of his favorite breakfast meal. Chocolate chip and banana pancakes, extra crispy bacon, sunny side up eggs and toast with fresh apple butter. It was a lot of work but for my dragon is worth it! Just as the food finished the alarm on Draco's phone went off. I quickly put on my invisibility cloak and took the food with me... I ran down to the room of requirement set up the food along with the cozy blankets and hot chocolate. Once all set up I walked back to our room and picked up Draco just as he was changing out of his pjs.
Once we knew we were alive the pain started. My neck was killing me, my body ached all the time. I would rather have been dead again then deal with the pain. But then there were days that it wasn't so bad Harry came over and we would spend time together. Mom took us out of Hogwarts for a while. She didn't explain why she said a family emergency and because everyone knew that Harry and I were together that's why he was included. Mom still taught us though this morning during a very bad transfiguration lesson. I lost my favorite trophy because mom turned it into a cup. The days were getting better the pain still hurt but not as bad. I wasn't till dad came home saw Harry and kicked him out. Then he beat me till I was black and blue and bleeding. He told me how dare I kill myself, and if I wanted to be dead that he would do it for me. This went on for weeks and I didn't tell Harry, but I started cutting again. He would come over while dad was at work and asks him about me about the new scars, I lie and say they were accidents.
I've never been so happy to hear my soon-to-be mother-in-law's voice in my life. Finally someone who believes me.
But soon enough they did let go sat down and enjoyed their delicious dinner. Then they walk through the tiny ocean shoreline that was in their room. Squished their toes in the sand and walked in the tide of their own personal ocean.
I told her I had and that she was crazy I wasn't going to let that happen to Draco. I had already almost watch him die once I'm not going to do it again.
He walked up the stairs and found his and Harry’s room and opened the door quietly, he didn’t see Harry, but he did see clothes around Harry’s bed.
The night that Sirius had been both dreading and anticipating had finally arrived, they were going to Malfoy Manor to have dinner with his cousin. He wasn’t sure how this would turn out, but he had hoped that it would work out for the better cause Narcissa was his cousin and to the Blacks family meant everything.
“Now Sirius the Blacks are a direct descendent of Salazar Slytherin, and Merlin himself” Gurlok said.
Before anyone could comprehend it was the day Harry would turn 11, he had already gotten his acceptance letter to Hogwarts. They also knew they would have to sit him down and explain some things to him before he went. Both men knew that with Dumbledore still the headmaster of Hogwarts he would try something with their son. That would wait for a couple of days though today was a day where they would go with the Malfoys to get the boy’s school stuff.
Dinner was a calm affair with everyone eating and talking about random things until Lucius asked a question.
He and Remus had two kids to take care of and to make sure they knew every day that they were loved and supported.
Both men shut the door quietly and Remus put the charm to let them know if Harry woke up before going into their bedroom to get ready for bed.
Luna was next to come down in a blue robe with the black crest on it also, as was customary for them to have on their robes. Harry was jumping up and down ready to leave, Remus grabbed the floo powder and stepped in with Luna and said clearly “Malfoy Manor”.
Ron was still in shock just staring at the scene in front of him not knowing what to do or say. Apart of him wanted to yell and scream but then another part of him wanted to be the understanding best friend.
Sirius turned over the letter and saw a green wax seal with a gray M on it “I think it’s from Narcissa, I haven’t talked to her in years” he said.
Lucius knew that both these men might have heard terrible things about him or his family, he wanted to make sure that Narcissa’s family were comfortable.
Remus had put a part of his magic into that rune, and then crushed it up and mixed his blood with the rune and put it in the potion and mixed it all up.
“In the wizarding world the sacred twenty-eight are compromised of the oldest and most powerful pureblood families, they have this power from practicing the rituals and traditions of our ancestors who showed their respect to the magic we hold through these traditions and rituals. We are taught from an early age these traditions and rituals and exactly what it means to be from an ancient and noble house, and the power that luxury holds” Sirius said.
“You came into the wizarding world demanding for muggle-borns and the traditions you loved in the muggle world to be celebrated here. You never once learned or even though that wizards have our own traditions and or ideals. You get mad when people call you a mudblood and I get it but you never asked anyone why you where called that. You are ignorant of the world you live in and claim to love, you are also very prejudiced against anyone who you believe is wrong. You never once took the time to maybe ask why I acted the way I did” he said to her.
Harry was furious at Dumbledore for what he did, and he inadvertently passed some of his power to Hogwarts. There was a power serge inside Hogwarts, and no one felt it, but it could be seen cause the lights got brighter for a second. He was hit on the side by Draco who told him to get behind him because they were going into the great hall.
“What power can own a school have though” Harry said confused. “Well Hogwarts is more of a sentient being then just a school” Remus said. “She is also the center of where Magic originated, it is said that deep inside Hogwarts is a power that holds all of the magic of the world. Those who hold it rules the world, but no one has ever actually heard it because Hogwarts will not give up her secrets” Remus said.
While the goblin was gone getting everything set up Remus and Sirius where talking about what they had just heard.
Narcissa flooed into Sirius’s and Remus’s house calling that she was here, she saw Sirius walking into the living room with a smile on his face.
He and Harry had a strong friendship, granted it didn’t always seem that way but when you are young you only see the shallow parts of things.
Remus cradled Harry in his arms while Sirius handed the parchment back to the goblin, the wait seemed forever.
Sirius for his part sneered at Molly and was about to say something when Harry beat him to it “Mrs. Weasley my name is Harrison Orion Black thank you very much” he said with a sneer in his voice. Draco for his part was smirking hearing Harry put this woman in her place, he did not say anything because he knew Harry could handle himself just fine.
“I didn’t realize until too late that James would have still been my friend even though I though different things. As for being a direct descendent of Merlin I didn’t know, my father never told me, all he said was our family was the most powerful pureblood families around and we had to keep the traditions and rituals and to always be proud to be a Black” Sirius said.
“When she had the baby, we decided that it would be best to give her to some muggles, not because we didn’t love her it was just so hard” Narcissa said quietly.
Narcissa looked at Draco who was making faces at Harry “Do you think you can keep Draco for the night because we don’t know when we will be able to get back” she asked her cousin.
Silence filled the room. Remus laid the letter on the nightstand with silent tears rolling down his face, as he flicked his wand and the bassinet holding harry floated to the foot of the bed. He laid his wand down and turned the lamp off letting the moonlight fill the room.
Sirius stopped Harry and knelt a bit “Kiddo when we get ready to leave for Diagon Ally we will have to go to Gringotts for a bit” he said. He had gotten a letter saying that something important had come up and he was needed, and he could bring whoever he wanted. Harry nodded his head and together they got in the floo and Sirius yelled for Malfoy Manor also.
Sirius put the letter down “I will open it after we put Harry to bed, she can wait I want to spend the time with my family” he said as he sat down to play with Harry.
“When I got to Hogwarts and became friends with James he didn’t believe what my family did and made it known that everything my family held dear was wrong. I thought that if I told him that I actually believed it and followed he wouldn’t want to be my friend again” Sirius said sadly.
The new family left Gringots and made their back to the leaky cauldron and into the floo to head back home.
Walking into Gringotts was always an adventure for Harry and Draco, seeing all the people around and waiting in line. Watching the lady yelling for some reason and then the guards taking her away. Both boys watched Sirius talking to a man and then they were all being led into a room. When they sat down Harry had to sit in front beside his fathers, he wanted Draco beside him, but he sat behind him.
Amelia told them that they are free to go and to have a wonderful night, she watched them walk out of her door hoping that life for little Hermione was filled with love and laughter.
He tightens his grip on Sirius the only tell his crying being the wet spot on Remus’s stomach. He ran his hand through his boyfriend’s hair as both men just dried themselves to sleep, to full of grief to speak.
He knew that Sirius was a Black just by looking at him, he had the signature Black hair, and dark skin tone that the Black family were known for. He also had those grey eyes that Narcissa, Bella, and Andy had.
Remus went to get the tea that had finished and brought it into the living room and poured him and Sirius a cup.
“Thank you, we kept Harry a secret because I was working for Gringots at the time, and they have rules, Plus with everything with Voldermort we didn’t want to risk anything” Remus said.
Finding his room was easy he was rooming with Draco, Blaise, Theo and Goyle and Crabbe, the last two boys he had no idea who they were. They all brushed their teeth and got in pajama’s Harry decided he would write his fathers tomorrow he was tired and wanted to sleep.
Gurlok looked at the two men “I feel that we should wait to go over it when you both decide if you want to adopt him” the tiny goblin said.
Remus slowly crept out of the bedroom and made his way downstairs to prepare for breakfast, so everyone could eat and get dressed.
Beside her stood a man with the same light blond hair that seemed to come to his shoulders, if he had his hair down that is. He had on some black slacks and a black dress shirt with a green tie.
He stood there and watched her for a moment just smiling at the way the fire reflected off her tan skin, how she had her beautiful hair up in a bun. To him she was the most beautiful woman in the world.
Ron nodded his head and kissed her lips softly and stood up to make his way up to the dorm room that he shared with Harry.
So sorry for taking so long with this chapter, I have been writing it for some time and it has taken different paths but its finally done.  Thank you to everyone who has read up until now and has been waiting for this. The actual story is about to happen so the updates will be a bit sorry but the story is very involved and I want to make sure the chapters are good and not half assed.  Again if you have any ideas on who should be with who go ahead and tell me, the only ones who are off limits are the ones that are already established, I can't wait to know what you think. Make sure to leave a kudo if you like it, comment if you want to also, and thank you so much for liking it, ok I am done on with the story. Oh one last thing I DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO HARRY POTTER. If I did well it would be different
Sirius nodded and went into his study and wrote a letter back stating that they would love to have dinner with them one night, he sent it with their owl.
Harry looked up at his fathers, both men saw that Harrys eyes had gotten a lighter green and inside the green they could see Sirius’s brown eyes. Harry looked more like Sirius, but you could see Remus in him also.
Sirius had made sure Harry had nice clothes but looking at what he was wearing and what the other baby was wearing, well let’s just say Harry’s dark jeans and white polo shirt and little leather jacket that Sirius had made, would look frumpy compared to this family.
Later that night when Harry had tired himself out playing with his stuffed toy lion that Sirius had charmed to walk around and roar whenever Harry moved. Harry tired himself out walking around everywhere.
Everyone though Draco was a stuck-up snob, he knew everyone called him the ice prince of Slytherin. For the most part people would be right, his father was a jerk who made sure he had the perfect heir.
All of a sudden, the lights flickered and the chairs lifted up on their own, all four people looked to the boys not knowing which one did it.
Once she stepped out of the floo she sat Draco down in her lap “Dragon I must tell you something, you have a sister her name is Hermione. She hasn’t been around because of unusual circumstances, but she is home now and will be with us forever” she said to her son.
Sirius though it over “or we could change his middle name to Orion after my father, then it will be less suspicious. We can still go with Remus’s idea but say he has my father’s middle name to honor my father who I loved also” Sirius said.
Remus heard Harry cry and started to turn off the burner to go and get him when he heard a door open and knew Sirius would get him. As he put breakfast on the table Sirius came in and put Harry in his highchair. Remus sat Harry’s food in front of him and sat down to eat.
If he did not have his father and his brothers and his uncles to teach him how to be a proper Weasley not the one his mother and Dumbledore wanted he would probably do what they wanted.
“As for Ron the reason we don’t get along is our family has a feud going and it can only end when the head of each house agrees, and the money is paid. The problem is the Weasleys are the ones who owe the Malfoys Millions of gillions on a business deal gone wrong” Draco said quietly.
They decided on Lyra because it is near the constellation that Draco is named after because they wanted to keep Narcissa’s family’s tradition.
He handed the goblet to Remus “help Harry drink it all up love” he told his husband with a smile as he sat down.
Cautiously, Harry moved his hips; a slight shift forward which slid his cock along the groove, lubricated merely with Harry’s precum but gliding easily. Draco gasped again and Harry froze his body once more. He still wasn’t sure how he felt about this.
Draco sighed. “We’re nearly done here, I think. I completed the deal. Sold the Manor and grounds. Just some paperwork to sign with the solicitor and that’ll be it. As of this time on Monday… all this won’t belong to me anymore.”
One last visual scan of Draco revealed nothing but determined resignation, so Harry allowed his magic to consume the last remnant of Lucius Malfoy. As with the box, the portrait instantly became a mass of flame which quickly extinguished, leaving an unmarked wall. No ashes, no fragments of any kind. There weren’t even frame hangings left, no trace at all that anything had ever hung there.
“I bet he was.” Malfoy’s focus drifted to the bureau. “This was my father’s favourite piece of furniture. The
stay here. And Draco realised that he was rutting, seeking friction against the hardness of Potter’s clothed cock which repeatedly rocked down to meet him.
Harry didn’t know why Luna would be asking for his opinion on this. Or why Luna would suspect that Michael’s lack of wand would have anything to do with him. Even though Harry had been about to ask
They were about halfway down when another shouted voice stopped Harry in his tracks. “Did you like the vibrator, Harry? Is it big enough?
A little reassured, but still grappling with a mix of fear and arousal, Harry stroked his index finger around the puckered rim. It fluttered in response to his touch. Feeling encouraged, Harry massaged the rim for a little while before he gently pressed inwards. Slowly… just getting the feel of Draco, experiencing the heat and the clench of muscles around his digit, enticing him to go further. He sank deeper with small explorative thrusts until he was buried to the knuckle and Harry jumped slightly when Draco shoved back in approval.
“My partner and mentor also likes to inform me that basic human decency is not something which requires gratitude.”
Draco smiled, a slow and chilling display of satisfaction. “Well, all right then. I… won’t be able to despise you either, after that. I’m going to have to… put up with you. And watch you carefully.”
Harry opened his eyes. Malfoy was standing in the doorway to Harry’s conservatory, peering down in obvious concern at where Harry knelt surrounded by chips of glass that used to be the large windows which bordered the room. The furniture hadn’t faired much better. On reflection, this might not have been the best choice of venue to calm down in, the plants hadn’t been as relaxing as he’d hoped.
himself. Draco had witnessed plenty of occasions involving his father’s anger before then, but never to such an extent. Lucius would’ve given the Dark Lord anything he’d wanted, just to save himself. Destroying Draco’s future had obviously not been a hard sacrifice to make. Draco had screamed and struggled, but nothing he’d done altered the outcome. The Mark inflicted upon Draco had been a punishment, not an honour. And the punishable infraction hadn’t even been his.
Draco took a moment to debate several options before he chose something resembling honesty. “You’re not as bad company as you used to be.”
Harry needed to come. Naturally, this was becoming an urgent requirement. He… he… couldn’t, he needed to hang on… he would
He wasn’t going to last long under this onslaught, but Draco was also positive that he couldn’t let himself go. Draco had a
Harry reached his destination, sat back to line his cock with Draco’s, and regarded the man who meant so much to him. Who he
A few moments later, there’d been no response and that confidence started to dwindle. Gaze fixed on the smoke, he tried again.
The process of appointing the new Head of MLE had to be ending soon. Ron clearly believed that Harry’s approval could help to push Michael into position. But the Ministry was furious with Harry, so his approval would most certainly
Trying not to spoil what might be another chance, Draco gritted out, “I… no… yes, more than the meetings.” Damn it all. Now Draco was losing his ability to construct coherent sentences.
Harry walked over to his wardrobe and chest of drawers, collected necessary clothing, donned the garments, and attempted to tame his hair to reasonable standards. He didn’t know why he even bothered; it was never going to lie flat. Giving up, he ruffled a hand through it to restore it to the state it would’ve regained shortly, and quietly guffawed as a snarfling snore emitted from the direction of the bed. Turning to regard Draco sprawled on the mattress, the earlier discarded sheets still piled beyond his bare feet, Harry debated how much fun it might be to throw the hairbrush at him.
They lay in companionable silence for a while before Malfoy suggested, “We could still just go to the Manor tomorrow.”
In the resulting quiet, Harry realised that he could feel a tug on his magic. An insistent, tickling but distinct alert that meant that someone or something was attempting to get through the ward that Harry had placed around his office. He wondered how long the alarm had been trying to attract his attention, and whether it was due to a person or the dreaded document meant to enslave him. Without altering his physical position, he sent invisible tendrils of magic to examine the strength of his ward, found it still at full strength, had a peek beyond and determined that it was a hovering, bound scroll of parchment. Correspondence intended for Harry usually manifested directly within his office, so he presumed that since his ward was denying that, the document had done the best it could to reach him. He decided to ignore the issue for the moment, confident that it wasn’t getting in here. Harry was busy with more important things.
Smiling, remembering where he was, Harry reached for the glass and gratefully sipped. The moisture soothed his anxious throat and the coolness dropping down through the core of his body helped to focus and ground him. As did the arm which Draco draped around his shoulders, pulling him close. He shoved the last of the recollection aside, concentrated on the present, and carried on as if nothing had occurred to interrupt them, grateful that Draco let him maintain the illusion of normalcy.
Shop officially closed; Harry returned to Draco for a more satisfying kiss. An immense relief after today. It wasn’t that the day had been
Permission given; Harry wasted no time. He moved his hips deeper, shoving his fingers in as far as he was able on the backwards motion and sliding the length of his cock along the the table as he shifted forwards, loving the textured grain of the varnished wood against his sensitive shaft.
A wistful expression had settled on Malfoy’s face, causing Harry to think that he might prefer some private time to linger in this room. “I’m just gonna go have a wander along the corridor,” Harry said. “I won’t go far.”
“I removed the information the box had gathered about your magic. You probably don’t want whoever buys it to have access to that. I’m sure they could do something unscrupulous with it.”
“I’d already set it to work through a few stages. I didn’t know how effective they were going to be. Or that I was going to be required to converse with a Weasley.” Harry grudgingly accepted that clairvoyance was a lot to expect. “What stage was it that you liked so much? The prostate location thingy?”
Focussed as he was on Harry’s face, Ron didn’t appear to notice, even as the shaking moved to Harry’s hand. Harry tucked the offending limb behind his back and tried to remember his breathing.
Harry tried to compose himself as that punishing hand stroked and groped his heated skin. It also hadn’t escaped Harry’s attention that Malfoy’s cock had begun to slowly refill during the last two smacks.
“Thank you.” Harry was getting thanked a lot today. It was fairly odd. But when Draco’s eyes narrowed with calculated mischief, it indicated that things might not be
“Whisky,” Malfoy called from the lounge, solving the dilemma. Whisky, Harry could do. He selected a bottle of the required beverage and two glasses and walked back to the lounge. This felt a peculiar way to be spending a Monday, but it was a shit Monday, so Harry wouldn’t protest.
Harry stared at the memo in his hand. A trap forcing him to continue within his official capacity was one thing, this was something more. Obedience. They intended to turn him into a puppet. Aware of Harry’s wish to resign, they wanted to take no chances that he might make any decisions that they didn’t like, so they were going to
Somehow, Harry hung on. He didn’t come, even when Malfoy ground his pelvis into Harry’s arse and came with a long, loud roar that Harry adored.
, he reminded himself as he took another long breath in and spoke on the exhale. “I… I… was wondering if maybe… perhaps… if I could… top.”
. But as he thought… as he realised how little Draco knew about the more personal pressures that other people had put on Harry to be what he wasn’t, Harry’s efforts to be what they wanted him to be, and his guilt for not
“A list of covert methods to ensure your violent demise.” Draco inwardly cringed; he wasn’t very skilled at being nice.
A particular movement drew out a gasp marginally louder than the others. Draco’s spine arced more forcefully upwards, and his heels dug deeper into Harry’s back.
It hurt his face, but it must have looked more convincing than it felt since Ron smiled widely back as he answered, “Yes, it is.” Harry wanted to hit him. “And he’d appreciate your help. He was a bit nervous about asking you himself. Maybe a letter to the Ministry?”
hard, he might be able to bring Ron down with him. But Harry wasn’t that petty. Harry wasn’t willing to destroy Ron’s life just because he hadn’t listened to him.
“Of course, it does. Just because you have enough power to stomp Corner into the dirt without raising a hand or a wand, doesn’t mean that you’re not afraid of what he might do. One doesn’t automatically cancel out the other.”
While Draco appreciated the directness of the query, he wasn’t prepared to give a direct reply. “Appearances can be deceptive.”
“Don’t stop now, Potter. You’re on a roll.” Harry had lost his momentum a bit though. “I’d like you to fuck me now. Unless your nervousness is getting the better of you again.”
Harry lifted himself, bringing his head almost level with Malfoy’s, shifting his knees further apart for better balance. He watched as Malfoy extended his right hand and curled his fingers loosely around Harry’s erection. The contact could be barely felt, but Harry shuddered with joy that Malfoy had finally touched him there.
Draco stilled and raised his gaze to regard Harry, looking like he was trying to decide whether he was more upset or furious.
Draco tried to steel himself for taking a small step towards making a huge decision. But there wasn’t really a decision to be made at all.
Oh. It was waiting for Harry to compose a reply. Harry didn’t have anything to write about. But maybe he should… would it be rude not to? A person deserved to be acknowledged. And it was always Harry’s duty to meet expectations. But Harry had
nice of George to give them the vibrator. And Harry had taken full advantage of it. He desperately didn’t want to divulge any personal information, but the least Harry could do was show some gratitude. Sighing with resignation, he recommenced his descent towards inevitable mortification.
“Harry…” Draco always spoke Harry’s name in that soft tone of voice when Draco was struggling to reach him. “Because I love you, I want to
Worried about Draco and the imminent failure of this endeavour, Harry frowned in confusion. Accidental… what? Had Harry made a mistake
Once Potter had succeeded in his task, and Draco’s erection finally rested snugly in the crack of Potter’s buttocks, the tip conspicuously and safely directed away from his hole, Draco’s patience nearly snapped. He needed to
Potter’s face leaned close enough to fill Draco’s vision with green eyes, flushed cheeks and plump, parted lips. It looked entirely delicious.
“The department could pair up the timeline of my… muddled memories and match them with the images and sound that we were able to extract from the spells,” explained Ron. “Instances of my confusion or odd changes of mind correspond with him casting
At the corner of his vision, Harry could see Draco’s wand twitching in his grasp. Draco’s other hand was clenched in a fist and his restless feet were clearly itching to move. Harry wanted this interaction to be over soon and he was aware that Draco’s restraint might not last, so he got to the simplest point. “What you did was not all right, Michael.”
how Harry had planned to begin this important interaction. But it might’ve broken some of the expected tension.
Harry just laughed as Draco grabbed his arms and threw him into the bed. Landing on his back, Harry wasn’t afforded much time to settle before Draco tugged his ankles apart.
“But…” Ron continued, “being angry didn’t make much sense to me… because I didn’t mind if you and Michael broke up. Not if you weren’t right for each other, anyway. And you’d seemed… upset, so I’d wanted to see if you were all right. But I also believed that it was important for me to remember it was your fault that the relationship failed.”
The nice feeling evaporated in the aftermath of Draco’s deliberate, directly phrased question. There was no room for misinterpretation in the words, and Harry didn’t want to blatantly lie. But Harry
This wasn’t an impossible task though. Harry was most certainly aroused, but he wasn’t being properly buggered or touched, he could calmly ride this out and wait for Draco’s return.
On one of the downwards dips, Harry’s erection hit the back of Malfoy’s throat and Malfoy didn’t come back up again. Harry felt the barrier of muscles relax and the distinct sensation of his cock being taken further than before, clenched by strong contractions as he was swallowed. In, in,
Malfoy smiled. “Well, I think we have a couple of offices to pack up before someone from the Wizengamot comes to yell at you. Us.” Harry’s expression must have shown his concern about that. “They can yell about it, Harry. But they can’t do anything to change this. They might be able to hide dodgy things within the contracts that they create, but I’d love to see them try to change one after you’ve sealed it. And I
Draco stopped mid-stride. “Were you having a great time in there? Because it didn’t look like you were.”
They fussed over Harry like parents, keen to hear about his interests and ensure that he was happy with the new turn that his life had taken. That
Draco let him for a few more thrusts before he said in that low demeaning voice, “I can see right into your filthy used hole, you fucking shameless whore.”
As usual, Malfoy already had scorn to offer. “Yet another new romance fizzled out, Potter? Shame. Was Wood not meeting your high sexual standards? I imagine you can be quite a lot of work.”
“I was being honest,” Potter mumbled. “But then I remembered that you didn’t like… before. Well, I wasn’t sure if you had… and I wanted but… no-one
contained none of its usual assertiveness, but the arms around Harry tightened as Draco bent forward and down, and Harry by extension was lowered backwards. Harry thought they were aiming for the rug, but his back connected with something higher than he’d expected. Oh, the ottoman. As his bum and hair were relinquished, Harry allowed the furniture to take his weight and considered that it was more comfortable than it was attractive.
“Good. Thanks,” was all Harry was prepared to add to this subject today. But later. Definitely later. Draco had a
“You’ll need to wait until he arrives. He should be here soon. And Arthur and I will leave you all in peace to talk. In the meantime, maybe you’d like to help me with my baking?”
Bowing his head again, mouth hanging open as he panted, Harry had the perfect view of Malfoy’s almost-grip, but he wasn’t sure that it would be enough. He didn’t want to let Malfoy down though.
. But, knowing Luna as he did, it wasn’t that odd at all. Harry didn’t know if this secret global wand blacklisting operation was real, but also didn’t see any reason not to go with it.
“All right, I’ll try,” Draco shrugged. “You know… as long as you’re up, my wand needs attention, Potter.”
“Yes,” Harry nodded. “The details of the applications came through my office three times during the last month or so that I was still Minister. I was a bit surprised by Ron’s. He used to say that he didn’t want to be in charge.”
True to his promise, the fucking which Harry was soon subjected to rattled the headboard against the wall as Malfoy battered into Harry’s arse.
Once Malfoy had apparently recovered enough for speech and movement, the weight eased as Malfoy shifted off him to lay by his right side.
Wordlessly, he offered the scroll upwards to Malfoy who slowly accepted it with a careful expression. Harry waited while Malfoy scanned the document.
Faced with this odd epiphany, and feeling increasingly nervous in its wake, Harry wasn’t certain what to do now. Slightly stalling for time, he slowly moved in tiny increments further up Draco’s prone body.
Maybe he’d earn a spanking, after all. Draco might leave the vibrator in as he walloped Harry’s arse cheeks with a bare and unrelenting palm while Harry diligently counted and thanked him for each painful strike. Or perhaps Harry would be forced to choke down Malfoy’s cock, his head held still by a ruthless grip of his hair as Malfoy fucked his face. Or Harry might be forbidden to come during their next session, denied an honour only given to less useless whores, but taunted to maintain his arousal long after Draco was finished with him. Or Draco could demand that Harry keep his favourite wide butt plug in his dry hole for an entire day. Or
confusing. Draco’s mouth co-operated with Potter’s tongue entirely without the permission of Draco’s mind. And worse, when Potter wrapped drenched and cold arms around Draco, it prompted an instinctual response which consisted of Draco’s hands exploring every piece of wet skin-taut fabric available to him.
“The nargles think it’s important. They’ve been getting quite insistent about it today, so I thought I should. It’s about someone you know. Not a friend of yours anymore though, I think.” Harry’s trepidation grew as he recalled being accosted by Ron's question, but quickly eased. This was
“Yeah, I suppose we -” Potter froze, his eyes widening and focussed entirely upon Draco’s proffered left arm.
Harry squirmed. The pressure from Draco’s motionless groin had been maintaining the growth of Harry’s erection, even during the unfortunate interval. He tried an upwards thrust, but it didn’t seem to be inspiring movement from Draco, so Harry enquired, “
Typically not in a rush, Malfoy left him there for a little while to ponder his fate. As he waited, Harry’s face heated further with embarrassment.
“Because…” he began again, feeling self-conscious now that Draco was watching. But Draco deserved to hear this too, for different reasons. “I was
Draco swallowed, tried to determine Potter’s expression, and failed. Feeling too exposed, he closed his eyes and searched for the strength to keep talking.
Draco was staring intently at the black material draped over the frame as if the weave held all the answers to everything, and he only needed to look hard enough to find them. Watching as Draco shoved his hands into his trouser pockets, slumped, then resolutely straightened his spine, Harry hoped he could do this well.
A whiff of smoke hit Harry’s nostrils, signalling that something within the office had indeed started to smoulder. Harry concentrated; like a radar, his magic rapidly found the source in a corner behind him and without turning his head, he pushed his power outwards to smother the danger.
to meet Malfoy’s intense gaze as the grey repeatedly flicked up to check that Harry was obeying the instruction to watch.
He complied, but the point of contact between penis and skin was tempting him to disobey. Arse on fire, Harry rocked his hips forward one more time and forced himself back into stillness.
Draco looked startled. Harry was a little afraid that he’d ruined this when the rocking of Malfoy’s hips ceased.
Rising on shaking legs, Harry realised that the coffee table didn’t leave him enough room. Wordlessly, he willed it to move back a few feet and stood directly in front of where Malfoy was seated, cautious not to get too close without permission.
Fuck it. Harry increased his speed, grinding his arse mercilessly into Draco’s cock before he threw himself forwards for a deep, bruising kiss and screamed into Draco’s open mouth as he spurted between them.
Malfoy watched as Harry put on his trousers, then waved him down beside him on the couch. Harry liked the weight of Malfoy’s arm around his shoulders as he was tugged close. He felt calm and protected, so he nuzzled into Malfoy’s chest again, slowly relaxing against the warmth and imagining that he could still smell his come on the cleaned shirt.
Draco wondered if Potter was merely bored. Maybe he’d finally outgrown the babbles of Gryffindors and was now seeking something more stimulating. Or maybe he was trying to torment Draco, goad him into breaking the terms of the agreement. Draco would have no doubts that Potter would be glad to see him gone, except for the fact that Potter had been single-handedly responsible for Draco’s re-enrolment. It was all very, very strange.
“I don’t know. It’s not possible to alter the terms of a magically binding contract after it’s been signed, so it
Harry pulled his fist up his shaft. “Ahh, I see.” Back down. In the corner of his peripheral vision, Harry saw Draco’s attention focus on Harry’s groin. “So, what do
“Well…” Harry tried to nudge his thoughts back on track as he lowered his cheek to the warmth again. “Maybe. I
“What?” That wasn’t the type of pillow talk that Harry had been expecting. At the thought of the Minister for Magic being interested in either of them, Harry’s heart skipped what felt like several beats. Harry didn’t even bother to correct Draco’s deliberate mispronunciation of the Minister’s name. If this was important enough for Draco to bring up
be true; it was preposterous. Malfoy continued regardless of Harry’s gaping mouth. “So, where are we on taking tomorrow off?”
, so there’d be fewer complaints. He really didn’t know how else to top. But maybe he could utilise the same principal here and gain something for himself as well. Harry wanted to learn what Draco liked, because he wanted to give him enjoyment, not just get through the experience as expediently as possible.
Random suggestions were one of Malfoy’s specialities, but drinking at half eleven on a Monday morning was possibly pushing it.
“Why did you ask me to come out here? And sensible people bring cloaks, by the way,” Potter added as he plucked his drenched shirt from his stomach, only for it to paste to his skin again when he released his hold.
Gasping, Harry relaxed his body to fall back to the mattress, wincing slightly as the glass ball reasserted its existence. He squirmed into it, too sensitive by far, but finding the sensation irresistible.
Draco sniffed again before he replied. “I’d…” Another sniff. “I’d tell you… that other people’s expectations shouldn’t rule your life.”
The moments when Potter’s eyes betrayed something akin to despair, Draco retreated to the dormitory, closed the curtains tight around his bed and tried to forget that he’d ever witnessed it.
Looking thunderous with anger, Draco didn’t speak, so Harry said, “There’s nothing we need your help with.”
earned these offers of employment, but Harry was certain that (with the possible exception of the racing broom lady) the proposals had nothing to do with the accursed Harry Potter notoriety.
As Draco ground his erection downwards into Harry’s groin, speeding up in obvious pursuit of his own climax, Harry screwed his eyes shut, hoping to block out at least visual stimulus. He strained against the unyielding handcuffs, testing the full strength of that uncompromising steel. His wrists were becoming sore, might be rubbed raw by the end of this, but Harry only pulled harder. He wasn’t seeking freedom, but the action of being forcibly restrained was a different thrill from holding a position purely by his own volition, and Harry wanted to feel the full extent of that restriction.
Feeling ridiculous, Harry stuck out his right arm and obliged. Being co-operative was generally easier and took less time than protesting over these ‘lessons’. If that’s even what they were.
Harry stared in horror as the smoke wove a few inches from the tip, then inexplicably reversed its direction and began to curve around the length of wood in an elegant, tight downwards spiral. Like a lazily slow whirlwind moving towards his hand.
His careful focus was interrupted when he heard the creaking of the door opening in front of him, but Harry didn’t think that had been caused by his quietening magic.
. Adult or not, it didn’t matter; parents would always feel the need to ensure that their children would be taken care of. That this still applied to Harry, although he wasn’t their child and had avoided them for years, reminded him of how important the Weasleys were to him. Yet, he’d allowed something to drive him away from them. And they didn’t even ask him why he’d done that.
Granger watched carefully as Draco approached, but Potter didn’t bother to look up. Big, woeful green eyes gazed steadily ahead from the region of the couch between Granger and Weasley, defiantly ignoring Draco’s rage. But upon closer inspection, there seemed to be no defiance in that gaze.
. But if your pure-blood sperm meets my stupidly super magic and you knock me up, you’ll only have yourself to blame for jinxing it,” he smirked. “And if it makes you feel any better, it’s not only
“Not today.” Harry must have looked concerned, because Draco said, “Next time, if the offer still stands. She
“Potter?” Malfoy asked quietly, confirming Harry’s suspicion. Then silence, probably due to Malfoy taking in the state of the room. “What… happened?”
Wincing as Draco’s grip tightened painfully in his hair, pulling insistently, forcing his head back, Harry’s immediately instinctual thought was
But Harry wasn’t going to let it go further than that, not at the moment. He drew the kiss to a gradual conclusion before it could escalate, waiting until their mouths had parted before he pushed at Draco’s right shoulder and rolled them both, reversing their positions until he was straddling Draco’s groin.
who elected me. I should've done better for them.” Taking a deep breath, he continued, “I met Amblehurst outside the wards about an hour ago. You know, that bloke from the
“I… know. My father died years ago.” Draco didn’t sound convinced enough for Harry. And Harry wasn’t willing to rush into something which would hurt Draco. “That’s not… him. It’s only a representation… just… another
“You’ll just need to do your worst,” Harry mumbled through his answering yawn. “Put me in my place.”
Why were there so many unfinished sentences around Potter? “Just what?” Draco prompted. “Stealing my mail? Using my wand when you had a perfectly good wand of your own available?”
Malfoy stayed above him while they caught their breath, their lips and tongues slowing but neither displaying any desire to break contact.
Draco had been encouraging him more and more to accept who he was and not allow anyone or anything to force him to act differently. Harry wasn’t entirely succeeding in that endeavour, still feeling the pressure of other people’s expectations and obligations urging him to be
Harry’s hand was accepted and the rest of him pulled into an embrace. He returned Luna’s cheery wave seconds before Draco Apparated them home.
They hadn’t done this before, and Harry wasn’t certain who had encouraged it to go this far; he suspected that it’d been him. But that wasn’t important. What
“That wouldn’t be so bad. You could write me romantic declarations of love and devotion. I wouldn’t mind that.”
Far from finished, Harry was inhaling to commence another torrent of that ranting when Malfoy raised his hand in a sharp gesture which was clearly meant to halt the recommencement of Harry’s tirade.
? The inappropriateness of that form of address was both ridiculously, absurdly infantilising and absurdly, ridiculously arousing. Harry didn’t understand why, but perhaps that didn’t matter. If it was so
As Draco stood, he was sure that Potter had noticed the remaining treacherously eager bulge in Draco’s trousers and seen his lie, but Draco couldn’t allow that to deter him from his departure. Survival was
Draco let him stay there for a few minutes while they caught their breaths, but a nudge to his arm soon encouraged him back up.
Harry didn’t know much of this movement was due to the charm Draco had cast and how much was a feature of the product. But if didn’t really matter, Harry needed to cope with it either way.
“Don’t push it,” Harry growled without any real malice. “And the stationer… what was his name again?”
“So many questions,” Draco answered calmly. “Ronald Floo called when I was downstairs. He requested that I rapidly finish shagging you, locate some clothing and meet him in the living room at nine-thirty. Actually, he requested nine o’clock, but I told him that perfection could not be rushed. My keen time negotiation and sexual skill gives us…” he peered around at the clock on the bedside table, “Nineteen remaining minutes.”
“Do you know the answer to this already, Draco?” He’d been lured into that trap before, confirming facts which it turned out that Draco had already been aware of, just because Draco wanted to know if Harry could wandlessly and quickly detect some magical aspect that it’d taken Draco ages to work out with a wand and an army of books.
Draco appeared to consider Harry’s objection as he lowered his arms to encircle Harry’s waist. “Desires, then. But that seems a bit… erotic trash novel. Which I own an extensive collection of, by the way.
Draco’s smile held steady. “Then you never say it. The lack of the word doesn’t mean that you don’t feel it. I know that.”
“If you want to try with me, I’ll take care of you. No commitment necessary, just to see what you really like.” Malfoy’s hand rested on Harry’s thigh, stroking briefly before it moved away to pick up his glass. “But think about it, there’s no rush. You know where to find me.”
. I should’ve put you on your knees in the first place. You seem to think a lot more clearly down there.” And Harry
Uncomfortable wasn’t quite the word for it. With claims of overwhelming responsibilities and a host of other lame excuses, Harry had successfully avoided the potential awkwardness over the last few years. But in freeing himself from official duties and creating an empty schedule, he had accidentally left himself exposed. It almost made him want to go screaming back to the Ministry.
“Indeed. I imagine they’d be very interested if they received written proof. Probably wouldn’t even care where it came from.” Harry decided not to ask about the source of Draco’s information. There were probably some things he was better not knowing. “In fact, they probably wouldn’t even
“Potter. I can hear you fretting,” Draco said. “Come back to bed. You’ve left a cold spot.” Draco patted the pillow to his left.
“Okay,” conceded Draco. “I don’t even know whether it would affect a portrait.” Harry wasn’t willing to take that chance. “But I wouldn’t really have done that, anyway. Are you coming back over here? You look freezing.”
Instead, Harry whispered, “I was… ashamed about… what happened with Michael. And I thought you were still angry at me for letting Michael down. For not being good enough for him.”
It’d been a blatant attempt to goad, but Potter didn’t seem in the mood to respond. Potter curled his arms in close to his chest as he closed his eyes, apparently oblivious to the fact that he was about to sleep on Draco’s bed. Surprisingly, Draco didn’t have the heart to highlight the issue as he rose from the mattress and walked to the door.
When Malfoy calmed beneath him and Harry stilled, he was struck by a dilemma: whether to move and let the cock slide out of him or stay seated where he was. This was uncharted territory.
“I do everything on purpose. Hadn’t expected the desk thing though. But I did think that you needed some kind of intense outlet to release your frustrations.”
going to be noisy.” Potter tutted, licking again, and Draco wondered what’d happened to the previously uncertain youth. These recent bouts of control were disconcerting. And entirely erotic.
Malfoy removed his wand from within his sleeve and muttered a cleaning charm before standing up to hang the robe from an available hook on the rack. Another charm had a chair floating through from Malfoy’s office to Harry’s before Malfoy’s wand was neatly replaced. Still feeling slightly off-balance, Harry watched in silence as Malfoy situated the chair directly in front of Harry and sat facing him, close enough for their knees to touch, his brow furrowed in what looked like concern.
Well Mr. Malfoy. It seems to me that you will have to. Be intimate like you would with the real Harry." Chimed Hermione.
We didn't have any classes that  day so pretty much all we had to do was go to the Great Hall for attendance then the rest of the day was ours. So after breakfast Draco and I went to Malfoy Manor. When we first arrived I was a little intimidated by the size, it was huge. We decided to go by broom instead of apparate.
"Harry darling can you hear me? I'm not really sure how this works I'm tapping into Draco's subconscious. We need to speak. In person I know that's not capable right now. Draco told me everything, I'm sorry for the way he's acting he does have his father's blood. But as long as Draco stays asleep we can talk.
I smile softly at the thought of a little baby girl crawling around. Blonde hair like mine. But with emerald eyes like Harry's. She was beautiful.
I don't know much of what was said after that I was kind of out of it but later Draco told me that his father pretty much told him he was no longer a Malfoy, that he was no longer his son and wanted nothing to do with him. So now it's summer and Draco and I have no where to stay.
"If our love was true, I should be able to connect to him even in death. I'm will to try if you are?"
When I  woke this morning my body ached. In a good way though. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and looked around me. The room was a disaster. The mattress we were lying on was on the floor. Pillow feathers were everywhere! The sheets were thrown in the corner as if to hide something. I look down at a sleeping Harry. His body was covered up to his neck but I could see several bite marks on it. I smile remembering what happened last night.
"Now the only way to know that is to ask him yourself, come on I'm sure you're very hungry and you need to ask him. You have a right to know."
"Oh Harry," he says to me. As if I didn't know my own name. "It's good to see you where have you been?"
As we geld each other and our breathing slowed and became normal. He kissed me and wished me a happy birthday. He told me there was more to come. We ate breakfast in each other's arms wee didn't move. When breakfast was finished it was time to go to class. He quickly decided that we weren't going.
Hey yall the new chapter is up let me know what yall think. Do you guys want me to a more in-depth chapter of what happened that night? Let me know in the comments below!
"Draco that's not true she's in there crying her eyes out. I want to understand why, didn't you think you come to me. I'm always here for you."
Harry was a little hesitant on teaching Draco how to cook. But he wanted to keep his boyfriend happy do he did. He walked around the kitchen explaining everything he was getting out and what it was used for. Then he put them together the way they're supposed to go and put them in the oven.
I sputter him name not really sure if I'm doing it right. I mean it has been years since he and I kelted.
I laughed again. "One Draco's in your t-shirt, two your glasses are sitting on the nightstand, and three the most obvious one of all you forgot to cover your toes. All I saw were literally floating toes."
After class we went for a walkthrough Honeydukes and he bought me two of my favorite things acid pops and jelly slugs. He offered to buy me a thing of butter beer too but I told him no.
"Harry dear calm down the plan is that you let Voldemort kill Draco and then I will keep his body here safe by that time Draco's spirit and subconscious will only have one place to go the only body that is around... yours. Then you all three will be in one head at the same time and you guys can dish this out like that it's supposed to be done. After that you will use the resurrection stone on Draco's body to bring him back to life and because Voldemort is on his last life once you two kill him it will be over. "
I took a deep breath and looked down at Draco's lifeless body. It broke my heart but I didn't have time to sit and wallow. I had thought many times how I wanted to die and non of them were good, sometimes I dreamed that I snapped my neck. Sometimes I dreamed that I shot myself in the head, sometimes I dreamed that Voldemort came and killed me. But I didn't have time to set any of those up. I had to do this quick and to see Draco I needed him back. So I picked up the razor he had used washed it off so there was no blood contaminants, don't need any issues with that.  Ended it. It didn't hurt dying I mean it just felt like falling asleep, I was warm one moment and the next I was called. I looked around at the place I was it didn't look like anything I heard before, it didn't look like heaven it didn't look like hell. There were people standing around everywhere. They were talking to each other just like a normal place would, they were old people and young people and babies.
"I'm sorry." I say. "Draco has struggled with depression his whole life he's nver truly happy.... Except when he's with you."
As I walked through the doors of Hogwarts he walked away from me and I finally had enough. I ran past him and stopped him.
As I walk into the Great Hall and tears streaming down my face everyone starts clapping and I don't understand why. I wiped my tears to get abetter look as everything is blurry. I see Harry in a complete tux and on one knee. In his hand is a ring in a box.
Part of me wants to kiss him because I'm glad he's alive, then another part is deathly afraid because this is the man I've left to be with... his sworn enemy.
As the words sunk in I felt my world spinning. I felt like I was gonna be sick. I ran past someone that was coming into the room. I didn't even see who it was. I slammed open the door to the boys bathroom and barely made it to a toilet before throwing up the contents of my stomach. Which wasn't much just a small kipper and OJ from breakfast. Once that was out bile burned my throat.
Words were thrown around. Spells to I don't think I've ever seen dad this mad, because for once someone was standing up to him. What happened next I wasn't ready for. Mom stood next to Harry wand drawn and told dad that he needs to leave. Mom has never done this before be she looked serious and dad looked furious. He didn't take what she said seriously. He took her by the throat and started strangling her. We were in my bedroom so everything that we made from homeschool is right next to me. I grabbed a vial of sleeping potion powder and threw it at him. Within seconds he was asleep. Mom gasped for air and was coughing as air returned to her lungs as fast as it was taken. She hugged us both and told us that she was going to go deal with dad her own way.
When I woke up this morning I smelled my favorite food. But when I got up I was alone. I sighed, it was a dream I knew it! I got  up and took of Harry's hoodie that I borrowed yesterday. Just as I pulled it off and the material covered my eyes I felt my feet being lifted off the floor and hot skin against my cold skin.
I pause for a minute trying to figure out what to say. "Draco sometimes we need to make decisions based on what's better for everyone else than what we feel."
Some people didn't have limbs, some people didn't have heads the really creepy ones didn't have faces. I looked around in amazement for a moment until I remembered why I was there I had to find Draco.
He laughed with what most would call glee. I slipped out unnoticed. My plan had worked. But I just hope I can convince Draco to do it. I slide into his brain to find out.
Okay was all he said and it was all he had to say because he stayed by my side and we talked for hours or what felt like it. Because the next thing we knew we were warm again. We were alive.
There were more whispers the next thing I heard was, "Come in Mother." When I walked in however, I didn't see anyone but Draco. As I sat down on the bed to talk to him, he continued looking over in the corner. "Something wrong?" I asked, his eyes started back to me and said, "no nothing." I took one look around the room and laughed. "You can come out Harry, I know you're here its safe."
After I got the okay from Narcissa to do this I aperated right over. I quickly used magic to break the Resurrection Stone into two parts and put them on a chain. I handed them both to Narcissa. "Give me 10 minutes to go and find and his soul and get him to come back with me once that happens put one necklace on each of our necks we should both come out by then we should both be back. Do you understand any questions?" She shook her head yes and took the necklaces from me with that i told her to leave the room. I didn't want to take the chance of her backing out on me, she did without question. Which means that really wanted this.
He smiles at me and it was a genuine smile that's the one I had seen this morning. His eyes were so soft and full of love, much different than what I had seen only moments before. As he spoke my heart began to race finally realizing what was going on.
I have never been this happy. The world seemed brighter nothing could have ruined it to be able to call the one I love mine forever, I  think Draco is happy too. During dinner he was tossing our names together inside our heads, kissing my neck and whispering in my ear how much he loves me. Already planning our wedding, talking about how the ceremony will go and getting super excited when he hears the sound of Mister and Mister Malfoy-Potter! Even if it is just his own voice saying it. But I can't argue because I love the sound of it too.
So my summer has started out horrible. First I had to meet the parents, then you get kicked out of his house and now we're homeless. Well not really it didn't take us long to remember that we have magic so even though we're not allowed to use magic outside of Hogwarts, it was pretty easy for me to pull out my invisiblity cloak cover up the both of us and apparate in Hogwarts.
The more she talked the more I understood. Her plan was that one of us I'm not sure which one at the moment but one of us had to die for the time being. If our spirits are in the air then we can inhabit another body. So that means that we would all be in one room together. But I don't understand the only one that is still truly alive is Draco... she's got to be crazy I won't let that happen.
He removed the invisibility cloak looking at me quite shocked. "How did you, I mean can you see me?"
As we walked back to Hogwarts he became very jumpy and I stopped asked him what was wrong. He said nothing but I didn't believe him. Was this night not as good as I thought?
But anyway as I was saying I was walking to the RoR and I felt a sharp pain in my neck. Almost like I had been bitten. As I felt the pain course through my body. I heard it.
Harry didn’t care about deteriorating magic on Lucius’ portrait, at least if he hadn’t caused it. “Don’t ask him for anything else regarding me again,” Harry growled. Worried that he’d started to sound aggressive again, he added, “Please, Draco.”
“People know how powerful you are. You’re so powerful that it’s fucking absurd. They might not understand how much strength it takes to submit, but I do. I’ve wanted to dominate you
It wasn’t that Harry was completely clueless. He understood the concept… mostly. Harry had studied how to treat, carve, shape, and balance the wood, and how to introduce a core without disturbing the magical properties of that wood. He was also knowledgeable(ish) about the best methods to bond, seal and finish a wand so it could, in theory, last a lifetime. Providing someone didn’t do something careless like sit on it the way that a customer had done last week.
“I was hoping things wouldn’t still be awkward. Ron’s told me that he’s tried to talk to you, but you’ve avoided him. It’s a shame. I know things didn’t work out with…” Harry’s glare halted Hermione’s sentence. “But that was a
issue, Harry obliged, thrust his hips up harder and spurted into his briefs with a groan against Malfoy's tongue. Immediately, Harry's hips were slammed back into the floor as Malfoy’s hips pinned him in place and an answering moan vibrated into Harry's mouth.
“There isn’t much to tell. Just the usual. That’s always… mmm.” She smiled the smile of the carnally satisfied. So much for Harry not wanting to hear about it. “He… annoyed me last week, but we’re moving past it, so I wanted you to be aware in case Ron mentions it to you. Nothing withheld, you know?”
“Uhuh…” Harry gasped as the thickness pulled outwards and his body settled in its wake. “It’s… big,” he mumbled when the last inch left him. “Like it.”
her a wand. Harry’s look of disbelief hadn’t dissuaded either Luna or the customer. Madame Deetry had squealed and beamed so happily at the prospect of receiving a creation from the ‘Young Minister’ that Harry had become convinced that she’d sat on her existing wand on purpose. Maybe stomped one of her hefty platformed heels down on it.
Harry squinted up at the man kneeling above him, frowning as the deep pile of the rug tickled his arse in a way that was weirdly sort of irritating in its softness.
Face burning with entirely the wrong kind of humiliation and positive that he’d said far too much, Harry clamped his lips shut. He couldn’t talk anymore. Instead, Harry continued to stare at the rug and questioned how it was conceivable that he was still crying. He waited for Draco to leave in disgust.
Ron furrowed his brow, evidently not absorbing the meaning of Draco’s inflection, but he walked back over to accept the co-ordinates which Draco conjured onto a piece of parchment. Harry got it loud and clear but decided to let this play out however it would. Reintroducing Ron into Harry’s life now that Draco was such an important part of his existence could be hazardous in more ways than one, but Harry was trying to convince himself that everything wasn’t his responsibility.
When Draco sneered appropriately at Potter’s latest attempt at conversation, something caught his attention. Potter’s eyes had lit up momentarily at the instant of Draco’s sneer before dulling back down to their now customarily lacklustre green.
Harry tried to increase his speed, focusing on the angle of his movements, ensuring that Malfoy’s cock consistently pressed into his prostate in the way that he’d been instructed to.
The laugh which had been building in Harry’s throat cut off abruptly with Draco’s last sentence. “You asked Ron for
. His first wand. His first proper venture into a new start after his Ministry career. The first job he’d chosen because he
Malfoy wasn’t the only one who could benefit from a new venture. “Do you need a hand with that?” Harry asked on impulse.
Harry extracted his tongue from Draco’s mouth, turned his head towards the voice and gaped at Ron standing in the open pantry doorway. He couldn’t decide whether to be insulted by the implication that pantry-snogging was a normal occurrence for Harry or astonished that Ron had cracked a joke as if nothing had changed between them.
to be a Saviour, he’d unfortunately secured that title when he’d killed Voldemort. If Harry had predicted that a reputation caused by saving the world was going to forever convince everyone of his supposedly dominant status and effectively ruin his sex life, he might not have bothered. Except, of course he would’ve. Harry always did what was expected of him. And as a reward, Harry was now twenty-eight years old and thoroughly unsatisfied.
“Oh, yes. I regard you very, very poorly, Potter. That’s why I’m cuddling you on your couch. Blatant contempt, really.”
would be enough to prompt a complete audit of the finances in dispute. And retribution sought by goblins is
Harry’s place to question Malfoy’s instructions. But it also wasn’t Harry’s place to be sitting above him. Harry didn’t
That seemed too dismissive, but Harry didn’t argue for now as Malfoy's face neared his and lips pressed lightly against Harry’s mouth.
“Well deduced,” Draco smirked, keeping his gaze locked on the item tied to the owl’s foot by a length of black ribbon. Although reluctant to accept the proffered scroll, Draco knew better than to refuse. His father’s owl was not above pecking out an eye.
“Well, if you could keep the volume of future ‘nothings’ down, I’d be extremely grateful,” said Draco with a disapproving sneer. Also, adorable. Harry was hopelessly besotted.
Draco shuddered when Potter breathed a reply onto his sensitive, saliva-coated shaft. “Do you care?”
The corridor was well-lit, but still somehow seemed gloomy. All that dark wood, Harry surmised as he walked along the plush carpet, viewing a seemingly endless amount of paintings on the walls, some of which were watching Harry with interest. The lines of neatly hanging frames were occasionally interspersed with wall-mounted sculptures that Malfoy had described as “meaningless hunks of brass and gold”. What Harry had seen so far of the interior reminded him of a museum; look, but do not touch.
asked her? Hermione knew a lot of people in official government roles. People who could probably be helpful to Michael’s cause. Or Ron’s. Or whatever the fuck was happening here. But what Hermione also had were unshakable ethics. She was a great believer in earning rewards through your own merits. If Hermione had caught even a whiff of manipulation, she would’ve dug her heels in and refused to budge. Harry was surprised that Ron hadn’t remembered that. Ron knew Hermione better than even
When I awoke I was in the hospital wing. I don't remember how I got there but I was just happy to see Harry asleep next to me. He's alive that's what matters.. I go to reach over to him he's ice cold he doesn't even budge at my touch. You would think he be dead if it weren't for the heart monitor beeping next to me. When I finally get his eyes to open I see they aren't his..
Harry came and sat down and instantly Draco's arms wrapped around him, his head went on his shoulder and he was happy. I think back to a few hours ago when they thought they were being torn apart their faces. This is how I wanted to remember them happy and hopefully what I  say next doesn't ruin it.
I help him in my arms and ran down to the room of requirement. I swung open the door and laid him on the bed. His hair still tossled from sleep.
Once we arrived Draco didn't take any time before going inside dragging me with him. Once inside we were met by a beautiful young woman with black and blonde hair she looked a lot like Draco so I'm guessing it was his mom. She descended down the staircase and almost boke into a run towards us. She hugs Draco first and then me. When she spoke her voice was soft yet firm. She welcomes us in.
That be my last chapter of this book... I could make another book but I don't know yet. Let me know what yall think I should do.
In the last 48 hours I've lost my body and my soon-to-be husband and there's nothing I can do about it. I understand why Draco was mad. I get it I would be too with I'm asking him to do, but that's not the point. The point is he's overreacting I want to show him how important he is to me but I can't that because he won't let me back in so what to do? I need help but who do I ask?
Just as my magical ride started it ended. I heard doors swing open and I was laid down on a soft bed. The room itself was warm and the smell of food has returned. Once my eyes adjusted I realized I was in a modified room of requirement, and the person I love was standing over me.
Just as I stood up top leave the door swings open standing there isn't Harry though its Pansy. She looks as if she's about to cry. When she speaks finally her voice is soft like she was afraid to go any louder.
He looked at me not reacting as I thought he would to my answer. Instead of being super happy he asked if I was sure.. was he super serious right now? Of course I was sure how could he think otherwise.
But it was very hard to concentrate because toward the end we kind of got a little distracted. I had to do something. Harry started thinking about you-know-who more and he was stressing out. He was pacing and who can blame him, He was on my  mind too. I hope he doesn't come and ruin it. I want this dat to go perfect. Especially for the perfect person for me. Without Harry I don't know where I'd be.
Anyway I finally jiggle the lock open and get in the room. Its ice cold. That's odd for Draco but maybe he is just trying to figure things out. I walk through the room and see the bathroom door closed. I go over and begin to knock but it creaks open and there on the floor in a pool of blood is Draco. I cry out in terror but no one is home to hear me. I run over to his body casting healing charms and spells. What I saw was horrific. He had slit both wrists going up his arms so he really ment it. It wasn't for attention. If that didn't work fast enough he also slit his throat, I'm guessing after the wrist thing. I cleaned him up but it was to late he was gone. He had no heartbeat. I slide down against the door holding my boy looking down at him. This wasn't how it was supposed to go. Not here not now, not like this. Tears streaming down my face falling on his face. He looks calm.
A dream in which life was perfect they were accepted that's who they were and never have to be apart, it was a dream that they had often if only it were true in real life.
They lay down wrapped in each other's arms listening to each of the others heartbeat both falling asleep not too long after the other and somehow meeting in the same dream.
I gently drag my nails against his hot skin, my skin temperature finally reaching his. He shivered against the touch and I knew it was working. I know it was my birthday but I wanted to pleasure him. That's exactly what I did. After awhile after hitting all of his sweet spots his body released in front of me. It was a loud and sticky mess of pleasure and want and need, the sheets in front of us were destroyed but neither one of us cared.
If he could hang around his friends and boyfriend at the same time he would be great, he knew that things would be said and looks will be given but it was all worth it.
Sirius picked up a sleepy Harry and walked to the little boy’s room slowly, upon arriving he put Harry in bed and covered him up and leaned down and kissed his forehead. Remus leaned down and did the same.
“Dumbledore also wants that power so he can rule the magical world and only you have the power to know where it is if you want to, Hogwarts will only talk to you” Sirius said. Harry had no idea what to think all this was a lot to take in. He knew though that he would not let that mad man anywhere near him or his school.
Remus nodded and lifted Harry so Sirius to prick his finger, Sirius made sure 3 drops of blood landed on the parchment, and then he healed his sons finger.
Remus and Sirius looked at each other and took the paper and quill and signed it, a bright light shinned from the paper for a minute and then disappeared. Gurlok smiled “congratulations on becoming the guardians of Harry James Potter” he told both men as he took the paper and put it with the folder of the will.
Before Harry or Draco could say anything, Ron piped up “I don’t like Malfoy and that will not change, no matter how much you want it to Harry I am truly sorry Malfoy can explain it better then me. I will respect your decision and try to get along with him to the best of my ability because I want you to be happy” Ron said quietly.
Remus didn’t understand why it mattered and looked to his husband for clarification. Although he spent most of his life denying it, Sirius knew what it meant to grow up as a pureblood.
She walked in and sat down looking at Harry and Draco playing with a toy lion and dragon, both boys where giggling.
Narcissa was saddened by that, she hated when people lost their lives, well people who where good and didn’t deserve it.
He smiled and thanked his telling them they were the best in the world, He watched them walk out the door slowly.
As the four adults where talking Harry and Draco where sitting away from each other looking at each other and giggling.
He was watching Remus get Harry ready and laughing at the fact that every time Remus would put harry in his dress robes Harry would kick them off.
Both boys put on boxers and jeans, for Harry to get Draco to wear jeans was a trial. He would only agree if it was designer ones and Harry would agree to get new clothes.
Draco looked at both of Harry’s friends “Look granger I don’t like you and as of right now that won’t change. I don’t like you not because of your blood status or the fact that you are mixed contrary to what you believe. I don’t like you because you think you are smarter then everyone first, and you can’t accept that someone is smarter. I also don’t like the fact that you come into this world with a self-entitlement, thinking that you will change the world and not looking at the world you came into” he looked at her.
Remus gave a minute for the fire to die down before he grabbed some floo powder and threw it into the fire and held on to Harry and stepped into the fire and with a clear voice said Malfoy Manor.
Narcissa knew it was time to go and get Draco from Sirius and Remus, she hoped that he had fun and made a new friend.
Remus grabbed Harry and told Sirius to go on first and they would be right after, Sirius nodded his head and grabbed the floo and threw them into the flames and in stepped into them and in a loud and clear voice said Malfoy Manor.
Gurlok looked at both men “now Sirius we can’t do the full pagan ritual I am sorry because that will take too long, but we respect the rituals, so we allow some of it. So, with that I am sure you know an abridged version of this right” Gurlok asked the man.
“Is there anything else that is needed to be talked about” Sirius asked, the goblin shook his head no and they left Gringotts after getting money out of their vault to get school supplies. As the day went on, they had almost everything but books, Harry kept on looking at his wand in amazement.
Gurlok said to give them 15 minutes to get this sent to ministry and get everything set up then the family could leave.
He realized he was losing his best friend the beginning of the summer after fourth year, he sat Harry down and talked to him about everything. The friendship slowly got stronger and by the time they started fifth year the two of them where best friends again.
Narcissa put Hermione in the middle of the bed and got changed into her night clothes and laid down beside Hermione.
I am so sorry it has taken so long to put up a new chapter, I would say life has been crazy but it hasn't really. Life has been mostly me going to doctors and therapist and trying to work up the energy to write.  I am getting better and I now am starting to want to write. The first thing I did was finish this chapter, I hope it is up to what you expect I really did try my hardest to make it as good as I know you guys deserve.  I am going to try and write more because I have the desire and the want to write again, it hasn't been there in a little bit.  Just to warn you I have a new story coming it is a modern day non magical AU Drarry story so be looking for that one.  Finally thank you for waiting and for understanding that I had some personal problems and for sticking by me I love you all very much.
Upon returning home Remus noticed a beautiful black owl sitting on the window ledge. He sat Harry down to play with his toys and opened the door to let the owl inside the house.
Remus grabbed the papers and walked up to the bedroom where his boyfriend was sleeping. He set the papers on the dresser, as he did Lily’s scream filled the room, “SOMETHING’S HAPPENED, GET HERE NOW!”
I can't ask his dad because he works for the dark lord. I can't ask anyone in my family because there's no one left and the other ones that are won't understand what the hell I'm talking about. Who is left to help me. Ican''t talk to Dumbledore or any of the teachers at Hogwarts. I'm literally all alone in this.
Finally I hear a spell being cast and the pain stops, I sit-up and the pain gets worse even though I'm not being kicked anymore.
"How can you be so sure that your story is correct?" Asked Hermione. She had finally got Ron to calm down enough to sit in the chair across mine. She was sitting on his lap. I hate to admit it but they did make a cute couple/
When Harry told me I don't know how to feel. I'm angry. Mad, sad, and confused. So much. I can't do that. I.. I can't. I won't. It took me so long to be good. This is do difficult. the only reason I'm good is because of him. Harry I mean. It's hard enough for me to not be able to hold him, love him. You know? I don't know what to do but I do know one thing. If he's not ready to get married. Then that's fine but I can't just sit and let this happen we have been together so long! If I can't marry him I can't stay around. I can't take the chance of this screwing up what if I really hurt him? That's it I know what I have to do...
My heart was racing but I could tell by his look he was too. His eyes jade green look get me full of love and want. I know I had just woken up not to long ago but I want him. But I didn't know if  he wanted me. So I took a chance.
Draco is gonna hate me when he figures out my idea. Hopefully not to much though. I'm doing this for us. See my plan is to tell old no nose that draco has decided to join his side again... I know long shot. What else can I do. When I return to my body I see a horrid sight. I'm in a pair of skin tight jeans black of course a white tank top and leather jacket. What as he done to me?
I know I missed yall but I'm back now! I know the next chapter is super late but it is coming up soon.
It took a moment to sink in. "Are you telling me I have to.." I didn't want to finish my sentence. My mouth went dry at the mouth. My stomach churned at the thought.
School ended tomorrow, and Draco decided it was the perfect time to meet his parents. I didn't want to, well let me rephrase that I didn't want to meet his dad but his mom seems really nice. We had been conversing by owl for about a week or two now. She seems super excited about meeting me. Draco told me not to worry but it's all I do. I mean wouldn't you be if you were meeting your boyfriend's parents?
His best man is going to be Weaselbee. I mean Ron. He still gets mad at me but I haven't gotten along with him yet but can you blame me. I mean I'm trying when it's very difficult no he's a blood traitor. But for Harry to keep him happy I will do anything. I just haven't had the courage to go up to Weasley and talk to him about it yet.
Last night I could hardly sleep. There was a big day coming up today, Draco's birthday. I have this big huge thing planned. It's very hard to plan these things when he can read your mind, you know. But I figured it all out. I won't tell you my plan but you'll see as it folds out.
But I  do have a question for yall should I continue with this and play out the whole day of Draco's birthday or should I not?
The love we shared that night was full of electricity the lights flickered multiple times. It was magical. It will be the details I will never forget.
I sigh a sigh of relief being able to hear his voice again. I smile softly at the sound of my old nickname.
Sorry the update took so long yall I'm working on doing it more often so let's hope it turns out but here's the next chapter so enjoy.
Hermione walks right up and smacks Harry right in the face. He isn't even fazed. Well... his body isn't. Inside my head I hear a scream in agony. That sounds like Harry's voice. When I was beginning to think I was going crazy I remembered it was how we communicated when we were younger. I attempt a reply.
"No Draco I came all this way because I can't live without you. I did it this way because I wanted to show you how important you were to me. I understand we fought, but I want you to realize that no matter how many times we fight, because there will be more times this is never the answer. Killing yourself is never the end."
