They stop before a small room close to the center of the compound with seats and a rusty looking grey table. The room otherwise was bare and there were windows looking out every side. Dementors circled the room every now and then ghosting their spiny fingers across the glass and frosting it over. “Here this will help with the dementors.” The guard hands over two chocolate bars and offers them the closest thing to a smile if ever there was one in this place. “You two can have a seat in there. They’ll bring prisoner Black down in a few moments. He’s been refusing to eat lately, a bit barmy that one, but I guess you’d have to be to do what he did. Didn’t think he’d been able to with how they were y’know.”
Bellatrix sighs softly and sits her now empty teacup to the side. It disappears with a pop and she turns her eyes toward the windows. They were covered partially buy beautiful lilac dressings and the fabric was drawn away by silvery threaded ropes tied in neat bows. “James Potter. I was to be bonded with James Potter. I believe that our contact stopped when the memory charm was placed on both myself and possibly him as well. We stopped talking to one another a year and two months prior to his death.”
“You said confidential, correct?” Severus nods and watches as her eyes flicker briefly toward the lit fire before a small smile curves upon her lips. “I had wondered what he was going to be doing with that copy he made.”
“No long story short, Harion is the son of Severus and Lily, heir to the Prince line. He is the last living Gaunt child in existence thanks to his mother who was illegally stolen from her family and sold off as a fake muggle-born. He’s also going to be Lord of both the Potter line by blood adoption, as well as, the Black family when he completes his bonding contract with Draco. All of which, I’m assuming, Cousin Sirius knew when he used the family magic to adopt the boy. With the protections of two ancient wizarding houses and the blood of a founder running through his veins he should be nearly untouchable by meddlesome old fools.”
Harion unravels his arms to wrap them around Draco’s waist in a tight hold. Draco shifts just a bit to wrap around Harion better at this angle. After a few moments of slow steady breathing from the dark-haired boy in his arms, Draco thinks he may have fallen asleep until he speaks in a low quiet voice. “When we were home for Samhain, I overheard our parents talking with another person. As you know, mother and I went to Gringotts that day.” Harion glances up at Draco and holds his gaze for a long moment. “Mother said the name of my true birth father. He’s alive…mother wasn’t going to tell me or him. I overheard them and I copied the papers from Gringotts and told him. He turned me away.”
“My son had been having some issues at school and I’d like him to be tested for dark curses.” The goblin looks surprised for a long moment before looking away from Bellatrix and down to the parchment in his hand. Harry knew not to question what was happening now. “I would also like an inheritance test done now. However, due to uncomfortable circumstance, I would request that it is not filed with the ministry.”
The doorway to the bathroom shimmers briefly and from it, there is a sense of great confusion and forgetfulness.
“Are you alright?” Bellatrix pulls back to look over her son with sharp eyes. She looked for any hair out of place or a scratch somewhere one had not been before. “Lucius told us there was a troll in the dungeons. Were you and Draco safe? I just about wanted to storm into that retched headmaster’s office and tear him apart for putting my little lord in danger!”
Draco tugs on his boots with ease and grabs both of their cloaks from his trunk. It wasn’t often that they talked about Harion of his past in this kind of relation. Draco understood better than anyone else that it was a touchy subject and one Harion would have rather stayed far away from. “I suppose so. Even so, as simply the scion of House Black, people may have thought it weird that we are to be bonded even second cousin bonding contracts are uncommon now.” Draco rolls his eyes as Harry shrugs on his outer robes. He wasn’t wrong, of course, but that didn’t mean Draco thought that their bonding contract was weird.
“Harion is here, Remus. He’s asleep with Draco in Draco’s rooms.” Narcissa motions toward an open armchair. “We’ve both got information for one another that’d we’d like to discuss with you.” Remus’ eyes stray to the hallway once more and he seems reluctant to settle down.
Harry had his eyes only set on the pair of grumbling sixth years as they tried to right themselves. His wand flies out and moves with such precision as both boys’ bodies are bound so tightly their ribs crack from the pressure. A flurry of small hexes with a lot of punch hit boy boys who end up with stinging faces swollen in several areas. Finally, Harry steps forward and stress down at them, his green eyes flashing dangerously. A child runs down the backs of a few older students as they catch sight of the magic fluttering about the small boy’s body.
They are quickly being ushered toward the dungeons, where the troll was supposed to be, but never mind the fact that Albus freaking Dumbledore was sending scared children into a possibly dangerous area of the castle. Draco tugs discretely at Snape’s sleeve when the stoic dungeon bat falls into step quickly behind them.
Narcissa steadies her gaze on Sirius and the man flashes a wolfish grin. “I want a trial. I never received a trial and by law, I should have. One of you two likely has the ability to demand it seeing as you’re the last remaining Blacks.” Narcissa frowns softly because that was a fairly large request and Sirius knew that.
Draco and he walked quickly, as quickly as publicly acceptable, toward the receiving hall nearest to the dining room. Draco releases Harry’s hand when they begin to see people milling about with their families. Both boys square their shoulders and clear their faces of any emotion before slipping through the crowd to search for their mothers. Harry finds his mother fairly easily. The woman is standing near the doors with a wide area of space between her and anyone else. The people gathering their children do not steer clear of her as most others did out of fear, instead, they respected the woman for her power and family legacy.
The clock on the wall strikes seven and chimes lowly throughout his small living quarters. At one time Severus had found the quarters warm and cozy still uncomfortable living in Prince Manor following his grandfather’s death. The mansion felt too massive without the elderly man there to tell him jokes over morning tea with the prophet unfolded before him and house elves working in the background. Severus’ grandmother had passed on when he was only a seventh year. His grandfather had passed just after Severus had achieved his potions Mastery. Now that several years had passed he had learned to hate the tiny professors quarters that kept him tethered to Hogwarts and in turn to Albus. At one time he had believed that the world would be bright and beautiful. He had learned what falling in love had meant and had embraced it willingly. Lily, his oldest and most cherished friend, had taught him what being loved truly felt like and how to love in turn. Her beauty was undeniable but it was never just her outward appearance that drew Severus to her.
There were many things she remembered vividly despite her time under the influence of the imperius. Still, despite nearly seven years of working with the mind healers sadly, there were still many things that she struggled to remember. She remembers the night that she had supposedly tortured the Longbottoms, but she doesn’t remember actually doing the deed. Many people had spoken up about seeing her there and yet that could be easily manifested with the use of Polyjuice. For the last three sessions she had, Bellatrix had been struggling with a breakthrough. There was a potent amount of magical obscurity in her easily past, perhaps the earliest moment of her mind being altered, that she just could not get through. The magic was strong and widespread, not only focused on her, and the mind healer had been thinking it was some kind of old blood magic.
He does not really want to admit how much weight came off his shoulders at the thought that he wouldn’t be a good fit in Gryffindor. On the train he had wondered if his birth parents would be disappointed if he didn’t follow in their footsteps to Gryffindor but the thought had quickly been pushed aside in favor of concentrating on the game of exploding snap Dray had tucked into his robe pockets for the train ride.
Narcissa had her nose wrinkled in disgust and a fan covers her face from the smell. It smelled distinctly like a mixture of mold, stagnant water, vomit, and human excrement here. The guard who was acting as their guide for the day seemed almost detached as well. Bellatrix supposed you would have to be to work here day after day especially around the presence of Dementors.
The doors of the manor open before Bellatrix before she was even aware that she had arrived at the front of the manor. Her mind was in chaos, as it often was after a visit with the healers and a breakthrough, but today was markedly worse because she knew she had to collect herself to pick up her son tomorrow.
Flint sighs in agitation when Ronald finally finds his seat. “I often wonder how the brilliance of the twins came from that family. It seems with the more of them born the dumber they become.” Marcus shakes his head at the thought of how lowly the once great Weasley clan had fallen. The twins were brilliant wizards and had they been placed in Slytherin they likely would have excelled far past the binds they’ve been put in by being placed in Gryffindor.
The bushy haired girl with a smattering of freckles dotting her tanned cheekbones nods with a bright little grin. Her curls bounce with the movement and she holds her hand out in a very muggle fashion. She must be a muggle born witch or a half-blood then.
“I’m fine mother, really. Draco and I followed what our prefects told us, and we remained safely hidden away until our head of house returned to assure us that the troll was dealt with.” Bellatrix breathes out a deep sigh of relief and pulls Harry into a tighter hug, before rising to her feet once more. “Although, one of our friends was in the bathroom in the dungeons and nearly got hurt had Draco not asked Professor Snape to go retrieve her. She’s a Gryffindor but she’s really very bright; too bright to be placed with those lions.”
I hope you like this chapter and let me know what you think of me adding in more little flashbacks into Harion's time with Bellatrix growing up. I've gotten some idea of where the next chapter is going and will probably have that up Monday or Tuesday. Please stay tuned! Let me know in the comments what you thought of this chapter!
“Ah Harion, my boy, I’ve been meaning to speak with you all year. You’re quite bright for your age. Well-rounded in magic already.” Harry could only stare at the man. He was trying for something. “Lemon drop?”
Harion glances behind himself at the open doorway and takes pause. Would anyone come looking for him like last time and find a massive chamber opened in the bathroom? Would a wayward girl stumble in unafraid of the ghost haunting the room? Myrtle was gone for now, but would she go blabbing that the sinks were open to a professor or worse the headmaster?
Harry was a smart child. He excelled in any subject his mother thought fit to teach him. He grasped concepts with ease and had a natural affinity for magic that made his mother grin in pride at every turn. He had always enjoyed learning; the one thing he was denied as a child before living with her. Despite his natural love for reading and learning he was never a child that had ceased to wonder on things. Book were not the entirety of the world as some children like him thought. There were still parts of the magical world that ceased to amazes him at every turn and perhaps that was where he differed from the others.
Dumbledore had also been up to something seemingly guiding the Longbottom Heir into some sort of trial involving the possessed Quirrell. As a small fish swims rapidly past the window, Harion cannot help but compare the fish to the easily frightened Longbottom. Neville was not terrible as many would think him. He was quite obviously using a wand once held by another hand and it did not react well to his calls. Harion could often feel the tragic tug of his magic to rise and then the despondency of it failing to be properly brought forth. With Harry Potter missing from his first year, Harion wondered if the old fool would create a new savior or if he would sprout nonsense about the boy training elsewhere with private tutors.
“They said she’s in the second floor ladies room.” Daphne Greengrass sniffs from her spot next to Pansy. “Myrtle said she’s been crying in there since the third block.”
Narcissa snorts at her husband who looks positively brewing with frustration at not finding answers to his spell research. Lucius, not unlike his dear friend Severus, was a brilliant wizard. Where Severus turned his brilliance to potion creation, Lucius turned his to spell creation. Lucius often utilized ancient family spell books filled with blood magic and natural magic to create new spells from them. He’d published several bits of research over the years since the war ended. All of them were published under a different name for obvious reasons.
Harion follows the older man with ease and they walk toward a door that opens with a simple hiss from the man before him and reveals a massive library with a sitting room already lit up by a roaring fire. Harion slumps as gracelessly as he can with his upbringing into a sofa. Marvolo settles in beside him and crosses one leg regally over the other.
Draco’s head of shimmering blonde locks finds itself on his lap after a few moments of getting comfortable and with a sense of quiet ease his fingers move through the silken tresses. “Father says that you can see the squid from the windows in the dungeons. Mother says she’ll send along extra blankets if it becomes too cold.” The mass on the platform is thinning out as more students board the train and their parents apparate away. Part of him wonders if his birth parents felt the same way as him when they first rode on the massive train. Surely they would have, his mother said they would have.
They all begin packing away their things but stop short when the doors to the Great Hall are slammed open and Quirrel is standing there panting harshly. “Troll! Troll in the dungeons! Just thought you should know.” He then proceeds to pass out in front of the entire student body.
“He wanted to protect them from Albus Dumbeldore. He knew somehow, he wouldn’t say how that Albus was going to go after them and try to kill them. He knew that Albus had altered people’s memories, including his own, and was manipulating things for his own gain. Like a game of chess.” Severus stares wide-eyed at Bellatrix. He had known his memories had been tampered with. He and Lily had never gotten into a fight in his fifth year. His false memories had him calling her a mudblood and them never speaking again. In reality, they had been together for some time after that. Lily had become pregnant just before he had finished his potions mastery. After that was when his memories still became rather hazy. He couldn't quite get a grasp on them to uncover them from the memory charms used on him. “The Dark Lord said that something about the Familial wards hadn’t felt right and when he’d arrived in the house Albus had already killed James and was preparing to kill Lily and Harry. He hadn’t been able to save Lily but he’d been able to turn his back just enough to protect Harry from the second killing curse. He believes that the fragment of his soul that splintered off into Harry likely was a way to protect the last member of the Gaunt line from dying at the hands of Albus Dumbledore.”
“Severus. It's Severus.” Draco growls low in his throat and moves to sit up and go and give his godfather a piece of his mind. He may only be eleven, but he’d be damned if anyone makes Harry feel like such crap. Harion’s hand holding onto his arm stops him. “Please don’t. Please just stay here…with me.”
“No,” Sirius mutters quietly. There is venom in his voice, but it’s not necessarily directed toward them. “Did you think they would?”
“You’re entire manor reeks of my cub.” It was little more than a growl and had Bellatrix not anticipated as much, she would have been terrified of a territorial werewolf. “Why does it smell like my cub?”
Sirius looked as if he was looking for something. His eyes bore into Bellatrix’s in a way that would have made her wary of invasion in her mind had she not had incredible barriers up. “He died on the 31
Harry always hated this part of meeting with the Goblins. The teller Goblins were always grumpier than the account managers. Harry would be too if he had to deal with stupid wizards all day arguing about their money.
“Of course my little lord. Mommy will owl you anything you could possibly need.” Her fingers run through the shoulder length mass of curls that feel around his chubby cheeks. She’d always helped him keep his curls tame since they had much the same hair. She loved playing with his hair. “I’m only ever an owl or mirror call away.”
“Please tell me that the one in the Chamber of Secrets is the one that houses half of his soul!” Bellatrix nods and that takes a bit of stress off his shoulders. At least only one student can speak parsel and it just so happens that the student is the Dark Lord’s grandson. Two birds with one stone. He isn’t sure what will happen once they are in Harion’s possession or if the boy would even work with him to find them. Given their current predicament, Severus doubted it. “Okay, then where is the second one?”
Blaise greets them from outside their drawn curtains on his way to the bathroom. Theo chuckles from somewhere off to the side of the room likely near his own bunk. Harry sits up and pulls the curtains open to offer Blaise’s retreating figure a sharp glare. Harry drops down from his bunk and hisses as his feet make contact with the chilled dungeon floors. By the time he’s finished getting ready Draco is finally finishing his shower and entering their room to dress for his day with his mother.
“Of course not, sir.” Blaise offers their head of house a wry grin and darts a glance toward Harry and Draco who seemed to be stuck in a conversation using just their eyes. “We were merely discussing pureblood betrothal customs with Mr. Weasley as it is a very useful thing to know as we age. Mother was just owling me about it the other day.”
The plump woman, who Harry quickly places as the likely mother of one horrid red-head his age, looks taken aback by Bellatrix’s greeting. Harry knew his mother got a sort of sick glee out of surprising people with her demeanor. “Ah, my Ginerva and I were just out and about.” Bellatrix offers the larger woman a short smile and motions toward her son.
Narcissa stares at Bellatrix for a long moment. She takes in everything that Bellatrix had told her and compartmentalizes the information. Her eyes narrow sharply and Narcissa holds a slender finger up as if she’s recounting something or going over the information again. It did not take the other woman much longer the figure out what Bellatrix had been battling with all day. “Are you implying what I believe you are implying?” Bellatrix nods shortly because she didn’t dare speak it aloud for fear that it would send her entire world to the ground. “If that is the case, and you don’t believe he had relations outside of your bonding contract, then we may need to visit the goblins.”
“Of course not, Harion.” Bellatrix offers the small boy a tight smile despite how much she wanted to fall to her knees and wrap her darling little boy in her arms. She had been aghast when Lucius had told her that a troll had gotten into the dungeons of the school. She had wanted to storm into the school herself and give the headmaster a piece of her mind but Narcissa had convinced her that their boys would not do anything to put themselves in danger. She was glad that her child looks to be in one piece. “We’ve got much to do today so let us take our leave Harion.”
Narcissa reaches out and wraps a tight hand around Bellatrix’s trying to sooth her knowing how chaotic her thoughts may be after another memory clearing up. “I apologize cousin. Bella…her mind was fractured during the war. She had been under the imperius for so long and when the curse was finally broken…” Narcissa trials off to leave Sirius to connect the dots.
With a smile and a quick nod, he controls his features like he’d been taught to his entire life, pulling on his pureblood mask of indifference, and shuffles through the platform as his mother apparates away out of the sight of the muggles.
The goblin stares down his large nose at Bellatrix and she meets his gaze unwaveringly. She had never had any problems with the Goblins. They were trustworthy when it came to money and incredibly vicious when it comes to those who wronged them. She could respect that. “Of course, Miss Black.” Bellatrix grins widely at the use of her House name. The Goblins were always the first acknowledge legal documentation.
If you have any questions please don't hesitate to comment. Harry will eventually go through piecing information about his family together while figuring out what happened the night his mother and James Potter died and his grandfather turned into a waif. It may all seem to be a jumbled mess right now but that was meant to happen. Harry is just now hearing all this information.
Sirius finally looks away from Bellatrix and back down toward the documents. He reads them over and moves to sign the paper before stopping short and looking up at them again. “If I sign this, would you do something for me in return?” Narcissa takes in the form of their cousin for a long moment before tilting her head toward the document in thought. Sirius was not a Slytherin by any means, but he was a Black and knew better than to give someone something without getting something in return. Narcissa had nearly banked on that.
The doors glow briefly for a long moment before dimming and refusing to open. With a hissed curse Harion lays a palm against the door and speaks again. “
My new account strictly for hp works is going to be ChaeLee96 so please show that some love and make sure to follow for updates regarding The Little Lord and any other stories I will be posting there.
“Oh my, he’s quite a powerful young man.” The wild haired woman runs a finger through the little boy’s black curls and coos quietly down at him when the boy glances up at her in surprise. It felt to her almost as if the boy was surprised that someone touching him could do so without it hurting. It made something ache in her usually unmoved heart. The imperius had done damage to her emotional control and her sympathies were usually the most vacant. She wanted nothing more than to hide this quietly little boy away and show him the childhood they had growing up; one of love and enjoyment rather than sadness and pain.
Narcissa rolls her eyes at her cousin before sliding the folder across the table to Sirius. She pulls a self-inking quick from her robe pocket as well to hand over. “I trust you can still read cousin?” Sirius snorts and takes the quill from her hand with bony fingers. A shadow of a slightly greyed over tattoo flashes on his knuckles before being hidden by the baggy sleeves of his uniform. Bellatrix feels her body tense up as images slam into her mind. Many of the fracture memories of James Potter were slow and painful to come back. The few she remembered were still missing bits and pieces, but the healers said it could take longer than normal to have them return entirely.
Lucius smiles and presses a kiss to Narcissa’s temple before making a shooing motion at his wife. Narcissa grins and tugs Bellatrix away from her husband who had already sat down to begin penning a letter to the minister. “Oh, and darling, if you could press that we’d like very much to see our cousin as soon as possible.” Lucius huffs at his wife’s impatience but does not comment on it. The woman was obviously up to something or another and Lucius had long learned to ignore her. The less he knew about her scheming the better.
Draco settles back into the bed with a conceding sigh. “Okay.” Draco stays curled up with the other boy and wipes his tears away when they eventually spill over the apples of his cheeks. They hold one another close even through dinner. Draco ignores the slight hunger in his stomach and instead falls asleep with the younger boy. Eventually when the other boys return to the dorm later that night, and Blaise peaks in the curtains, they find Draco wrapped entirely around Harion. His long arms have the younger boy’s head pulled tightly into his chest and his leg thrown around the boy’s waist. Harion’s hands are fisted as tightly as possible around Draco like he was afraid the older boy would disappear.
Draco sneers and hisses something under his breath but Harry reigns him in with a silent shake of his head. They would get revenge for the Weasley boy's prejudice but not here. They would do it in a way that they would not be caught. They were smarter than to stoop to the level of a dunder-headed Gryffindor boy.
Their first week of classes had gone by without much fanfare. The new additions to the snake pit found out rather quickly that the only class they were treated equally in was the potions class. Though charms class was a break from the devastating transfiguration classes with Gryffindor’s head of house, it because abundantly clear that the snakes needed to stick together for a reason. Harry was intelligent, his knack for picking up spells and facts out of thin air was only fueled by the abundance of books and readings he was given access to as a young boy. All of the Black family archives were at his disposal as well as most of the Malfoy family library.
Waking up as so had eased the feeling of homesickness the little eleven-year-old boy felt upon waking up that morning. Breakfast had not yet fully reached its peak when they finally found their way to the great hall. Harry had been excited to have been able to write a letter for sending before they were sent off to beds for the night. He knew his mother would be happy to hear from him so soon. His leaving certainly would be detrimental to him mothers mental state for a few weeks but he knew she was strong enough and their bond formed enough that they would be able to survive.
The few people in the room jump up in shock when the two boys fly across the room and slam into the marbled stairwell across from the furious looking first year. Harry stood glaring darkly at the pair of boys making up the crumpled heap of body on the floor.
“So, James Potter and my Lillian were never truly together?” Harry shakes his head and turns away from the man at the thought of his birth father who had yet to speak to him since that fateful day. Marvolo pulls his head away for a short moment and contemplates the boy before him. There was a sadness in his eyes as if the very thought of someone caused him great grief. His father, perhaps? Yes, it certainly was his father. If not James Potter than likely Severus. He had surely been the only man his Lillian had ever truly loved. Had Severus not known? “Come with me little one.”
The dungeons were chillier than anywhere he had ever lived and his mother owled him a charmed quilt she had bought in Diagon Alley just a few days into the week. The dungeons were also slightly volatile with the old students becoming acclimated with the bunch of new first years in the room. Harry and Draco were two of the more problematic additions to the snake pit for their last names and the power and stigma attached from the first war. Despite both familial named being tinged with dark magic the Black and Malfoy name carried significant weight in the wizarding world of Britain.
Again I apologize for not updating for so long. I hope to update more regularly but I hope you understand if that doesn't happen. This year has been really weird all around so I'm hoping 2021 treats us a little bit better. Anyway, leave a comment if you'd like and tell me what you thought!
The blonde woman brushes a light hand over his cheek to tuck a lock of his hair behind his ear as Lucius places the hand not on Dray’s shoulder onto his head. “Enjoy yourselves boys and study hard! We’re expecting good things from both of you.” Lucius smiles softly down at the two and really it is more of a small twitch of the lips but they saw it for what it was behind the pureblood mask.
Harry chuckles dryly at the over exaggerated gagging noises coming from the blond-haired boy curled up on his lap. Draco had always and still does find the attraction that Theo had toward girls a bit disturbing. Though Blaise happily supplied that it was because Draco likely batted for the other team, Draco always snarked back that it was a good thing his bonding contract was with Harry and not Pansy then wasn’t it. That always made Harry glance his way and raise a brow in amusement. Draco was usually not a very outwardly affectionate person lest it involved Harry. Blaise just had the ability to get under Draco’s skin in ways that most could not because he had known them for so long.
“Sir, we have heard that a little lioness who was kicked from the den is in the second-floor bathrooms.” Draco raises his eyebrows hoping that his godfather gets the hint that the lioness was being mistreated like them and that was why they wished to help her. “We’ve decided she’s a snake in the lion den.”
“I know cousin.” Sirius break off from his deranged tangent to stare at Bellatrix in intrigue. “He would have lost his magic.”
“Perhaps we should call Severus. He’s better with these things.” Lucius steps up and studies the young face of the boy intently. His features are more sharp than the rounded jawline and nose of the Potter family and his magic sounder and more powerful despite his young age and malnourished appearance. “He’s a powerful child. I would venture a guess that his magical core has been sustaining him all this time.”
“He’s only five yet he’s a small as Draco was when he was just two Luc.” Narcissa’s blue eyes seem a tad watery as her sibling pulls the little thing into her arms and makes small sparks flutter out of the tip of her wand. The boy’s bright eyes follow the sparks in awe and his fingers reach out in intrigue to try and catch them. When they disappear from view his little eyebrows furrow in sadness before rise in curiosity. With a look of determination his little fingers poke at the air until tiny blue and white sparks tip off of his fingertips surprising those around him that were still paying attention to the child.
“Mother killed them. Tortured them to death and burnt their home to the ground with the most fiendish of flames.” Harion relaxes into the man who still had not released him. His magic was so warm. It felt so similar to his own; it was like a breath of fresh air. “Her mind had been shattered following the death of James Potter, her betrothed. She fell in love with me the instant she saw me and sought to raise me as her own. Sirius Black being the then heir, now the head, of the Black family had enacted ancient familial magic to magically adopt me into their ranks making her claim over me a righteous one so long as I was to be bonded to a member of the family.”
“Yes, I was quite fond of him. He was two years or so younger than you. He was lovely, at least in my memories. He was intelligent and diligent. His letters were different than the persona he put up, but he was real, and I adored him, or at least that is what my memories show right now. You know how these things go.” Narcissa nods having remembered several breakthroughs that turned dark after the next session. “The mind healers think that there as a widespread memory charmed used on several people that occurred through old magic or someone using blood magic. It would make sense I suppose considering what I know about this man and his future following the absolution of our bonding contract.”
“Have a wonderful day, ladies.” The guards haul Sirius up out of the chair as he slips into the guise of losing his mind. “Please stop and say hello to the moon for me.”
“Speak.” Harion leans back and glances up at the professor. “And Mr. Black I expect the truth and all of it if I’m spending my free time appeasing you.”
“I know you do Severus.” Her voice is even but sure. There was a certainty in her tone that left little room for arguments. She didn’t need to know exact details about the horrors that were his younger years before he was formally adopted back into the House of Prince. She could see it clearly written in the lines of his body. “Neither of you deem yourself worthy of happiness much less love. Familial love is something almost foreign to you. I’m sure you’ve seen glimmers of it in your many years alive Severus and I have tried to show it to Harion but even then you both doubt the validity of that love. And yet you both fear being alone more than anything. You fear that you will never truly be able to find people to love you and be loved by you and that you will end up alone.”
“No.” Harry takes a deep breath and releases it through his nose. He would need to owl his mother immediately. She would know what to do. By Yule she would have figured out everything that she needed to ensure that Albus has no say in his educational experience without herself or Severus present and if Severus refused she would certainly have Lucius and the entire board of governors on the Headmaster. “Alright. I’m better now. The old goat threatened to have mother placed in St. Mungo’s. He insinuated that she wasn’t sane for not trusting him.”
Narcissa eyes Bella but, the older woman staunchly ignores her sibling for a moment. Remus Lupin was no fool. She could tell that he was not going to allow them to talk about things in their normal roundabout political manner. He was a man that preferred thing to be straight and to the point.
“Yes, my Harion and I were just making a quick stop at the bank before we go about celebrating Samhain.” Harry watches the red-haired woman study his mother for a long moment and then glance down at him. He was very much aware that despite whatever inheritance he may have, he looked for all the world like a perfect scion of the house of Black. His hair was inky and dark, and his face was structured in a similar way. His mother said that he looked very much like her cousin Sirius who had been his godfather. She never said much more. “Harion this is Mrs. Weasley. Her Ronald is in your year.”
“Severus!” Bellatrix tucks a stray strand of raven hair behind her ear where her wand is tucked haphazardly. In the last six years since she took Harry in and began raising him, Severus had seen her blossom into the woman she had once been when he first met her before the war really took hold. She was far more of a woman than the crazed shell she had been when her mind had shattered. What a beauty life could be when you saw someone so near to death. She looked for all the world like a true heiress of the House of Black. “Whatever brings you here? Is it Harion? Is he alright?”
The next morning, he was not surprised to feel tiny wisps of blonde hair brushing against his cheekbones as he came to his sense. Draco had made it a habit to share the same bed since they were five years old, especially when it was cold outside. Last night it had been a bit chilly in the dungeons and most of the boys had been asleep when Draco had climbs lithely into his bed and wrapped his longer limbs around him in a tight hold. Harry, as Draco knew, was very tiny for a boy his age, a result of prolonged malnourishment as a baby. Due to his size, Harry grew cold very easily and often had charmed blankets and sweaters with him wherever he went. Draco had taken it upon himself to be a human heater for his younger friend whenever he got the chance.
It is nearly eleven when the portrait door opens and their head of house steps through the opening and into the room. Their head of house is limping slightly and there are some blood stains on his leg, but he looks to be healed already so they all breathe a sigh of relief. His dark eyes swing around the room to take a quick head count of his snakes to ensure that they were all present and accounted for.
“You never know, you could be so insane that you looked like a snake hybrid with no nose, a forked tongue, and no hair.” Harion watches in unrestrained glee as a shiver goes down the spine of the horcrux. He outright laughs when Marvolo brings a hand to his crisply coifed hair. Marvolo shoots him a sharp glare and turns Harion by the shoulder to shuffle him out the door of the library. “I was just joking! As far as I’m aware your probably some waif possessing my DADA professor.”
Hello everyone! Just a quick update with another one coming along shortly. This chapter technically takes place a few weeks before the last update and from the point of view of Bellatrix no less. Hopefully, everything makes sense in the chapter and if it doesn't then it will slowly make sense in the next few chapters.
Harry watches in sick glee as the headmaster’s eyes widen sharply. So, he had not guessed yet who Harion’s mother was. Then why was he here! Was that damned old man merely curious of his ancestry thinking the last of the blacks died out after Sirius was imprisoned?
A quiet murmur goes down the table in agreement as many of the old pureblood families suffered tremendous losses in the last war. Some families even died out following the war. It was sad to see entire families, who had once been so abundant and strong, reduced to so few members.
Bellatrix sits down slowly in her normal chair and runs a hand across her forehead before brushing a stray strand of hair away from her face that had fallen from her bun. “Cissa, sit down please.” Narcissa pauses and then sits down across from her while floating a cup of steaming tea toward Bellatrix. “The Longbottoms are still…uncertain. I know that I was not there that night, but I don’t know what I was doing instead? I also don’t know how people would have seen me there if I had been somewhere else? You and I both know my wand did not show traces of the cruciatus curse.”
“Oh have we upset crazy Bella’s little baby?” A darker haired seventh year raises a brow at the sixth year pair who just couldn’t seem to keep their mouths shut. Marcus Flint had heard quite enough about the powerful Black lord who was only a young boy. Harion Black had made a name for himself in the darker pureblood circles for mastering spells up to seven levels above his age level. He was truly a little prodigy of magic. These two boys were asking for punishment and Marcus would do little to help them. “What are you going to do brat? Call your insane mother to come crucio us until we’re just as crazy as her?”
“Why are you so smart?” Harion turns and raises an eyebrow at his grandfather. He wondered briefly what Marvolo would look like today. “Aren’t you like perpetually in the mind of a sixteen-year-old?”
Harry storms out of Dumbledore’s office, well quickly walks because Lords certainly do not throw temper tantrums, and into the dungeons. Every person he passes gives him a wide berth and whisper in surprise when he passes. How dare that crazy old man hint at what he did. Harry would kill every person in this castle before he let his mother go to Azkaban or the Janus Thickey Ward. Hell, he’d rather go in her stead. He’d suffered abuse enough that he could handle dementors or curses. He’d die before she was sent to either place.
“The Black library of course. The Black family is long known to be the keepers of the darkest of secrets known to magic. Mother allowed me free reign of the Black libraries. She never wished to limit me of anything.” Harry closes his eyes tightly a small sliver of longing for his time spent with his mother hollowing out his chest. “Even the most retched of books if I desired their knowledge mother would disengage their warding for me or read them aloud to me. Any knowledge she had she sought to teach me.”
To avoid them all he often finds himself wandering the halls of the lower levels of the dungeons. The second-floor corridor that sat just below the Black Lake was the most common place he would find himself. There were several alcoves in front of massive windows looking into the lake for him to curl up in and do whatever homework he had left. For some reason or another, the magic of this part of the castle felt warmer to him than the rest of the castle. He wonders idly if this was where the magic of Salazar Slytherin resided the most. Would magic from so very long ago still resonate with him as familial magic?
“You are right.” Harion sighs and seems to shrink in on himself. “I don’t think myself very important to people. In the grand scheme of things, I know my blood and my line is important to retain…that I will Lord over many houses come my majority, but those muggles made it hard to believe I am important.”
Sorry for taking so long to update this. I lost a little bit of inspiration and kind of took a break. Hopefully, I can pick it up again but we'll see.
He found himself sitting quietly in his seat in the potion’s classroom wondering briefly why had had even spoken to the dour man before class started. What had brought him to think it was a good idea to speak up to share his rolling thoughts that still made very little sense to him. Was it what he heard playing with his emotions? Was it seeing his mother slip inside the school late last evening and following her into the office of their defense against the dark arts professor? Was it all of the above or nothing at all? Harion couldn’t be sure.
Severus is taken aback by the boy’s tone and the anguish in his face. There was desperation there that he himself had felt countless times before. He remembers the surprise he felt when he found out that his mother, a Prince by birth, had an entire family who wanted him in the worst way possible following her demise. He’d left his acholic muggle father in a puddle of his own piss and vomit and never looked back at just the tender age of sixteen. That had been the summer before sixth year and following seventh year he returned to Hogwarts with the power of a wealthy pureblood house behind him.
Bellatrix looks at Sirius in surprise. She’d fully expected him to scoff when the guards told him he was wanted for a meeting with his cousins. She had expected him to deny their request or even spit at them if he was forced to come here. She did not expect him to talk to them so cordially.
James had written to her near the end of his seventh year at Hogwarts about he and Sirius decided to rebel a bit and get tattoos the muggle way. Remus Lupin, their friend who had grown up in the muggle world, had taken them into muggle London for the first time ever and they’d managed to get themselves tattooed. It was a simple design comprising a set of lines to make up a dog. James’s tattoo was a similar design making up the form of a stag. They’d both been Animagus since their fourth year.
At Narcissa incredulous tone Remus raises an eyebrow and shrugs his shoulders. “Of course, I do. I’m a werewolf and have been since I was five. Obliviating doesn’t work on me. Even blood ritual obliviations. As my mate, they also did not work on Sirius. Conveniently, the headmaster forgot that such mind matters are shielded for shifters and their mates. The bond is too strong to allow such manipulations to take place. Though the blood ritual blurred some of Sirius’s memories for a time they did not remain unknown to him. As for James and Lily…the moment, they stepped foot into Potter manor and Gaunt manor respectively they were cleansed of their issues.” Remus glances at Bellatrix and tilts his head in thought. “How you were never saved from such house familial magic we are all still unsure.”
“My mother is perfectly alright sir.” Harry knows that the old man can hear the contempt in his voice. His mother was a touchy subject. “If you don’t mind my asking sir, why am I here? If I’m not in trouble and you merely called me up here to talk about my heritage then I’d like to leave. I shouldn’t even be in this room without a parent or my head of house present. Be that as it may, I am going to be late for potions and as uncomfortable as it may be with all those bloody Gryffindor students, I would not like to show up late to my favorite class.”
It was easier than he thought it to be and yet he still saw the man wandering around more than entirely necessary; especially close to the third-floor corridor that was off limits. He was no Gryffindor and certainly not foolish enough to go into the corridor unprepared. However, he had heard whispers in the halls from other houses that the first year Weasley boy had gotten some sort of hero complex and felt that he and Draco were somehow wrapped up in everything going on and were somehow in cahoots with Quirrel for some reason only Merlin knows. “What a batty git. Who would willingly work with someone like that bloody madman?” Draco, foreseeably, was not pleased with Weasley ruining his good family name. Harry had heard the other boy talk about telling his father on more than one occasion.
Severus had not expected for the young boy to ever question his parentage. It was never hidden from him that he was Harry Potter. Why would Bellatrix think to have a heritage test completed on the boy? Things just didn’t line up. Harion is still staring at him deep in thought. Clearing his throat Severus speaks. “I did. Though how that is much of a revelation I am not entirely sure.” Harion glances toward the window and Severus realizes that there is something more, something much larger than this detail.
A few of the younger years watch as several witches and wizards work at healing the pair who look positively furious.
“We’re not sure.” Narcissa tests the words out. They had not really thought about Severus in all of this. It would certainly make sense why he hated Harry so much if he thought that the boy was a product of Lily potentially cheating on him with James Potter. They had never thought to ask Severus if he knew or even if he thought something was amiss. He was certainly powerful enough at mind magics to know if someone tampers with his memories or not. “To be frank we only just learned of Harion’s true parentage. We spoke with Sirius recently and he steered us toward you, so our initial reaction was to seek you out.”
“It means that there is a student being mistreated by their own house.” All their eyes turn sharply to see Marcus Flint standing to their left with his wand drawn and ready just in case someone or something breached their common room. “It means that they have more in common with up snakes than they should. It makes them an honorary snake in the pit.”
It had been nearly a month since returning from Samhain. Harry felt entirely uncertain of himself for the first time in his life since living with his mother. Most of the other Slytherin students had given him a wide birth sensing his tremulous emotions. There was a heartache inside of him despite the velocity of the thoughts in his head. Distracted as he was, his grades never slipped so no professor had stopped him to ask if he was okay.
Both boys offer polite smiles and shake her hand lightly. “I’m Draco Malfoy and this is Harion Black. It’s nice to meet you as well.” He can feel his cheeks lift at the shy way the girl tries to memorize their names. She seemed incredibly intelligent and witty despite having a certain tone about her voice that proved she knew that she knew more than others.
“We can only try,” Narcissa murmurs quietly. “I’ve mailed with him several times about Sirius’s trial and he seems adequately responsive. He may receive us through a fire call. I’ve had him residing in one of the older Black family cottages at the moment. The werewolf legislation has done a number on him and kept him rather put out.”
Seeing his first wand react to him, watching the magic of his mother’s wand dance around the library rearranging shelves, mixing potions, and watching his mother deconstruct spell work with finessed skills are only a few simple things that amazed him in his short life. Watching the hundreds of owls fly into the great hall during his first breakfast was just another thing to add to the list. There were so many they created a cover over the artificial sun before descending down to the tables. In their beaks held parcels and packages of all kinds.
Bellatrix nods sharply just once and exits back the way she came with a small tilt of her head. Severus follows after her quietly and doesn’t say much as her magic flickers out lighting the small manor up as they move. Severus had expected no less than a spotless house. While the Black family was well known for their madness they were also well known for being impeccable hosts no matter what time you may come knocking. The smaller manor that Bellatrix lived in with her son was nearly sparkling with how clean it was. Bellatrix sweeps casually into a sitting room where a tray of tea and biscuits pop into existence on the table. She settles into an armchair with ease and Severus follows after her. She makes him tea with expert hands just the way he liked it. If you didn’t know her past or her struggles you would have never guessed how shattered her mind had been at one point in time. She looks, dare he say it, happier and healthier than ever before. There was a fire in her eyes he had yet to see in all his years knowing her.
Harion nods and wraps a hand lightly around the wavering vision of a man. “Will you be old if we bring you back to life…like ancient?” Marvolo pulls away and rolls his eyes.
A smooth oval shaped nail runs around a gaunt cheek and the babe looks up in surprise and fear but not a sound escaped his lips at the touch. The dirt and curls did little to hide the nasty looking scar that ran along his forehead marking him for who he truly was. Somehow it didn’t mean as much after glancing at the poor shape the boy was in.
“Ugh.” Draco rolls away from Harry to flatten himself out on his back and stares blearily up at the canopy of silver and green above their heads. He frowns softly before tugging Harry forward into his silk-clad chest for another cuddle. “I don’t want to get up, it’s warm.”
Harry definitely looks away from his book to glance at Blaise on that one. It wasn’t so much that he didn’t trust their head of house and potions master. It was simply that he was wary of him. He always had been. He’d learned early on that Severus Snape was a man of many secrets and that a majority of his actions were based on self-service. He did things for his own agenda and if they coincided with your own then great; if not, tough luck. The only soft spot Snape had was for his Godson, Draco, and lucky that because he did not particularly like Harry. “We can’t be hasty. I’m sure Snape already knows or has an inkling of what is going on. We’ll let him come to the conclusion himself, no?” Draco is smiling indulgently at Harry who had finally decided to add to their conversation while sitting on the floor around the fireplace. Their homework was getting finished slowly, what little they had to finish, and they were beginning to deter to more interesting subjects than a history of magic.
The guards leave the room to them, something rarely done, but done as a favor to Lucius. There would be no one listening in on their conversation and no one had seen either Bellatrix or Narcissa within the walls of the prison. This conversation never happened to the outside world lest Fudge would like some of his more unpleasant and illegal business dealings coming to light.
“Have you ever heard the name Gaunt before?” Severus instantly looks to the boy, having not heard that name for several years while also hoping to not think about another name connected to it. “Mother once said you knew her quite well. That she was your childhood best friend. Did you know she was a Gaunt?”
“Do you not think Draco will miss your presence in his life?” Harion flicks his gaze to the mirage of his grandfather at twenty when the man finally speaks. He had not really thought about his distance from the boy. He often did not think his presence meant much to others in his life save for perhaps his mother. The Dursley’s had quickly beaten it into him that few cared for useless freaks like him and it was something he often found himself too weak to battle away. “You are his bonding mate or at the very least his future bonding mate. That title holds a heavy burden but also a beautiful relationship with young children. You are likely his best friend, brother, and the love of his young life all in one being and to lose you so suddenly may hurt him more than losing his godfather.”
Bellatrix watches as Narcissa’s eye twitched in annoyance at the man. “Yes, cousin Sirius was always quite stubborn. Don’t worry he’ll come around.” The guard raises an eyebrow as if to question whether Narcissa truly knew who she was referring to and the answer was yes, yes, she did. Sirius would certainly not come around because she was sure somewhere in his mind that he got a kick out of irritating them. “We were told you would have the documents that the ministry sent over for Sirius to sign?”
“I told Professor Snape he was my father around a fortnight ago. Maybe more, I’m not sure.” Harion is gazing into the fire with a clear distance in his eyes like he was reliving the memories again: anew. “Needless to say, he did not take it well. He sent me about my way with little more than a brush off. My bonding mate, Draco Malfoy, was unhappy with his godfather and refused to speak with the man for some time. Seeing this I distanced myself from the issue so that they may reunite as godson and godfather. I would not want Severus’ hatred for me and my blood to cause a rift between him and Draco. Draco has done nothing wrong and does not deserve his ire.”
Bellatrix snaps back to reality and turns her gaze to Sirius who is watching her. His blue eyes take in each of her movements with a mixture of mistrust and confusion. “That tattoo on your hand, you got it in your seventh year. With- With James.” Sirius rears back almost as if he had been slapped before his eyes narrow sharply at that. Bellatrix is still staring at his hand even though she could not see the tattoo any longer. She remembers having run the tips of her fingers over the matching tattoo on James’s inner arm when they met for the first time in a darkened corner of a French restaurant.
I've changed the Gaunt family tree up a bit. Originally Voldemort was born in 1926. Merope died that year. Her father died a year later. In this story, Merope and Morfin were both Marvolo's children and were born to his first wife. After she died, he remarried Isadora Selwyn and had Marvolo II (Harry's grandfather). For my own references, I made myself a family tree that I can post somewhere if anyone would like. I haven't listed death dates or anything yet though I probably should lol.
Malfoy Manor loomed heavily in the distance. It’s four towers pierced the fogged skyline. Despite having the ability to floo straight into the Manor, Bellatrix had often found herself apparating and entered the wards from the entrance of the home. The overcast weather and the chilling temperature seemed to promise snow within the coming hours. The grounds were startlingly quiet. Even the prized Malfoy peacocks were nowhere to be found. Bellatrix found that she enjoyed the silence that the grounds offered her after such a taxing session with the mind healers.
“It’s not. Not really.” Harion meets his gaze for several long torturous seconds. “Have you ever wondered if you could have a second chance, a way to have true, living, breathing relatives? Would you? Would you tell them and share the details of your connection? Or would you secret it away and hope that they never found out for fear of being rejected by the only blood connection you had left on this earth?”
“Do you think he and Lily figured everything out?” Narcissa frowns softly and rubs at her temple. “Does it much matter if we can’t speak to them in the afterlife? There really isn’t anyone else close to them that we could speak to who would trust us enough to speak to us.”
Bellatrix nods slowly. That explains why she had brought the topic up rather than sharing it with Lucius and Narcissa and having them pass it on to him. Bellatrix was asking him what he thought they should do. Should they help or should they allow Marvolo to do it on his own? “The Dark Lord explicitly stated that should anyone touch one of the two Horcruxes within the school they will suffer irreversible consequences as they house quite large portions of his soul. I believe one houses half and the other houses a quarter of his soul.” Severus was not sure he wanted to know what those consequences were. He was sure that the man was not bluffing.
Harry nearly snorts when mounds of candy and pumpkins spring forth on the feast tables to celebrate the muggle holiday of Halloween. Harry and Draco vanish the candy and pumpkins alongside the entirety of the Slytherin table. In their place several sixth and seventh years conjured decorations for Samhain. While pumpkins remain, they are no longer carved with frivolous faces and are instead joined by corn stalks, apples, acorns, and gourds. Carefully so as not to burn themselves each of the Princes of Slytherin places a little candle into one of seven small cauldrons that line the length of the tables.
” The wall slides closed behind him. All along the walls of the pathway were massive knots of designs made from snakes. The passage opens to a massive set of double doors with the squiggling words engraved into the wood. The words transform before his eyes.
“They haven’t been physical, as far as I know, mostly just taking her things and hiding them. They also make fun of her teeth a lot. The front two are a bit bigger, you see, and it upsets her that they point it out.” Harry frowns sharply at that because certainly none of them were truly great looking. They were children for Merlin’s sake. Some genetics appeared better for children like the Black genetics running through him and the Malfoy genetics running through Draco but surely children wouldn’t make fun of her for things she could not control. “She said that they did cut open the bottom of one of her bags just yesterday after one of her classes.”
“There was one in me, I think.” Marvolo whirls around to stare sharply at him. “Mother believes when you died that what was left of your soul latched onto me or a part of it did. We removed it from me when I was very small and transferred it to a Black family heirloom. So, don’t worry, it wasn’t destroyed.”
Two updates coming since I did not update last week. We'll return to Harry's pov in the next chapter! Enjoy the chapter!
“Horcruxes.  He said he had been ‘pushed’ into making them by Albus in his youth and then continued to do so as his mind deteriorated from splitting his soul. He believes he had made six before the splinter that was in Harion was created and is hoping to regain two of them by being in the school.” Severus narrows his eyes. Why then was the man seemingly going after the Philosopher’s stone? It didn’t add up. “He wants Albus to believe that he’s playing into his hands rather than trying to regain his mortality.”
“What are you going to do?” Narcissa skirted over the obvious statement of what they both came to conclude. If James could not physically be with Lily Evans without losing his magic, then he would not have impregnated her with Harry. The question of who Harry’s father became one that Bellatrix found she could not answer at the moment. “Do you plan to go to the goblins?”
The guard disappears and Narcissa settles primly onto the cold metal chair provided for them. Bellatrix was already cold enough and did not really want to place herself on a freezing chair to make it any worse. She felt a lot less comfortable than what Narcissa looked at the moment. As per instructed, for their own safety, of course, the pair to relinquish their wands upon entering the prison. That did not necessarily make her uncomfortable, she had lived for nearly four years without a wand following her trial after the first war. When she was deemed mentally stable enough she was allowed a wand again but the lack of one only made her better at casting wandless spells like Accio and warming charms. She’d only gotten a wand returned to her right before Harry had entered her life. His presence had made her entire perspective change. Without him, Bellatrix was not sure that she would be in the same place mentally that she was today.
Bellatrix hums softly under her breath and tilts her head softly. Her inky curls titter slightly atop her head before a few tumble down out of her loose bun catching the light of the fire. “Harion is...quite like you.” She offers him a pointed look which may cause his neck to heat up. It has been many years since someone had been able to know something about Severus without him being aware of their knowledge. The way she was looking at him implied that she knew far more than she let on. “Perhaps hindsight truly is 20/20. Harion is quite like you when you were younger. Harion is still scarred by those wretched muggles in ways that even I cannot fully heal. I will never know his life until the moment he was placed into my arms...not fully.”
“Hn.” Snape glances at where Draco and Harion are both sharing contemplative looks with one another as if debating something silently with one another. It was a bit unsettling. “Perhaps by sharing your knowledge of betrothal customs with Mr. Weasley you will enlighten him on a world he certainly should have known long before now.”
“Bugger off Parkinson…heard she’s smart is all. And in need of a friend.” Theo grins cheekily before wiggling an eyebrow down the table at Pansy. For what it is worth Pansy doesn’t actually through her cup at the boy like she pretends to and instead curls a lip at him disgustedly. “What?”
“Pans is quite right.” Blaise wraps a protective arm around Harry’s shoulder and his magic simmers down a bit. “While we are quite used to your unusual gift, those Gryffindor children passing us by are not. And we need not repeat the troubles we’ve had growing up, do we?”
“If he so much as accuses Aunty Bella, you know father will have the entire weight of the Malfoy fortune on him.” Draco reaches forward to fix a strand of Harry’s long black curls. His fingers linger purposefully on Harry’s ear while he offers Harry his signature Malfoy grin. “Not to worry. My father will certainly hear about this. I’ll ensure it.”
The snake lets out a sound close to a chuckle and bobs her head down to press against his cheek as if to caress it. He reaches out and runs a hand along her scales nearest her deadly eyes.
“So, it was you.” Remus sips at the cup of tea Narcissa had levitated toward him. “Sirius and I had thought as much. We had thought perhaps Andy but that was quickly tossed to the wayside considering their age difference and then we thought maybe Narcissa but that was also clearly not probable.”
“Yes, I suppose that I do.” Narcissa glances toward the library when a thud sounds only to shake her head and chuckle softly when they both hear a poorly muffled curse from Lucius. “Mother and father found my bonding to be very pleasing. You never said very much about it. Of course, you have always been the type. I had thought he was very fond of you with the number of owls the two of you sent and received. Andromeda and I were always joking we were going to lose an owl at the rate you two were going. And then mother merely said that the bonding was called off and nothing more.”
Regardless, as Harry had expressed several times to his mother in the weeks following his arrival, he felt unchallenged by the curriculum as his latent magical abilities that had been nurtured by his mother since he was five were altogether more awakened than most of his fellow students. He could nearly wandlessly cast spells some struggled with casting normally. His professors found him a wonder though few were annoyed with his lack of listening at the beginning. Most had left him to his own devices as he read whatever tomb his mother had sent him that week from the massive libraries of the Black and Malfoy family.
“Ah, that is somewhat frustrating. Do they feel you will one day remember what happened that night?” Bellatrix nods shortly knowing that her sister was perceptive enough to know that Bellatrix did not want to stay on the topic of the Longbottom couple for very long knowing she was still largely accused of their torture. “You do have the appearance of having had a breakthrough, however.  Was there something else you were working on recently or was this one more of a surprise like the one about dear cousin Regulus’ death?”
“I’ve found, Severus, that the only way to show Harion that you are serious about your devotion to him is to actively become involved in his life. If you show interest or effort he will eventually come around. Perhaps...you would care to join us for Yule? You needn’t stay if you would prefer your own home but you are welcome to our dinner and our morning with Narcissa and Lucius.”
“Hello, Bella!” Narcissa is bustling about the formal living room with a tray of tea pouring itself to her left and a stack of booking flying back to shelves to her right. She seems perfectly in her element and for a moment Bellatrix wonders if she will ever feel so at ease in her own skin again. She had once been just as tender and somewhat naïve as her sibling but that had been taken from her when her mind had been practically shattered. “How were the mind healers? You were nearing a breakthrough about the Longbottoms last time, yes?”
Harry was a child of extraordinary patience and a temper that was not easily set off. That was especially so if the comments were directly about him. The one and seemingly only thing that made the boy’s magic flare to life in rage was anyone speaking ill about his mother. That woman was certifiably insane, yes that was true, but she was a doting mother who was incredibly loving to him. She taught him how to survive in the horrible world they lived in and gave him weapons to use in his defense.
“Yes. I had my suspicions.” Severus sets his tea aside wondering where she was going with this conversation. Bellatrix, not unlike Narcissa, was an incredibly intelligent woman capable of carrying a conversation in a way that was quite hard to guess what her next words would be. She was not by any means an easy to read person. That was one thing Severus hated most about the Black sisters. Them being hard to read meant that Severus had to constantly be on his toes. He couldn’t understand how Lucius could keep up with his wife. Severus would be entirely grey if he had to do this constantly. “He was said to be quite the proficient dueler of trolls and yet one still managed to get past him on Samhain and best him. That among other things, such as trying to steal the philosopher's stone which the old man foolishly hid in the school rather than leaving it in Gringotts where it had been before.”
The dark slope lights rapidly and a set of stairs descend into the dim light. Harion steps into the depths with ease. There were cobwebs that he clears away with a wave of his wand. “
Harion leaves the room as quickly as possible. He could feel his pureblood mask cracking as quick as his steps through the dungeons. He barely registers that he was running, and it was bad for the image of a proper wizarding Lord to run. He doesn’t even murmur the password to the common room. Instead, he hisses for the doors to open in broken parseltongue. The doors open and he steps into the room to find Draco and the other first years huddles around the fireplace. They looked to have been in deep discussion but that had paused upon him stepping foot into the common room.
Harry calms down completely and feels his eyes shift slowly back to normal and his magic calms down. He hated Albus Dumbledore. He hated that man more than he thought he ever could hate someone but he was only an eleven-year-old boy. He may be Lord Harion Black of the Houses of Potter and Black but he was not powerful enough to take on a man like Albus Dumbledore just yet.
Bellatrix returns to walking after brushing off any dirt that may have gotten on her robes. “Hmm, a lion in with the snakes how unusual.” Harry nods and glances up at his mother as she offers him a tight smile. “We will be visiting Gringotts first before visiting the graves of my mother and father, cousin Regulus’ grave, as well as the special grave we visit every year, is that alright with you?”
He’s tugged out the door and Narcissa’s eyebrow crease in confusion as they are escorted out of the prison slowly and given their wands back. “Whatever do you think he could have meant by greeting the moon for him?” Narcissa wonders aloud. Perhaps he might be slowly going insane in there a mind healer would definitely be in order once her cousin was freed. Bellatrix stops short for a long moment then continues walking as if nothing had happened.
“Well, maybe it’s a good thing you’re all dying out.” The red-headed Weasley boy sneers as he walks past them to find his seat at Gryffindor table. “You’re all slimy little death-eaters in training anyway.”
Both women turn their head to the door behind them when it opens and two guards escort a haggard looking man into the room. Long ebony curls hang in unkempt tangles around a gaunt and sunken face. Striking blue eyes, which are decidedly clear or insanity, take them in for a moment longer than expected before turning away and glazing over. Narcissa could almost see right through the insanity act if she could look past her cousin’s appearance. Sirius had always been exceptionally good looking, good with men and women alike. Like this, she could barely see the beauty that had surrounded the young man just ten short years ago. Of course, that was not to say Sirius was not still handsome, just a bit deathly looking.
“I would think not.” Dray looks up at him with something resembling curiosity in his vivid blue eyes. They had always had a way of calming him. He had the very same vivid blue eyes of his mother and the majority of the Black children. It was the one part of him that was not entirely Malfoy. It made him different from his father in some way. “What has you worried?”
Draco catches Harry’s eyes in the mirror and holds his gaze for a long moment while he thinks. For eleven-year-olds, they were both far more intelligent than most children in their year. Having grown up the way they did they were expected to act mature and not like little hellions. “Perhaps that is because they all know Aunt Bella and Mother are sisters. Technically that would make us first cousin.” Draco turns finally and crosses the room. Harry points out a specific pair of black dragon hide boots that he thought would go well with Draco’s outfit.
The rest of the boys in their dorm had already cleared out for the day leaving Draco and Harry to themselves. Harry studies the slightly older boy with faraway eyes. “Is it odd to you that we are to be bonded?” Draco hums in confusion likely processing the question slowly due to his half-asleep state. His hands are busy fixing his clothing to look just right. He was never one to not impress.
“I’m not sure.” Marvolo runs a hand across Harion’s head tucking a stray black curl behind his ear. “If what my Lillian said was true…then I split my soul many times and the one housed here may not be powerful enough to fully bring my back. If you were to find several of them, it may be possible. If I made several they would be things I deemed worthy no matter how insane. So, founders’ artifacts and Gaunt family heirlooms.”
Harion had hissed the words before he even realized it, repeating after the silken voice whispering in his ear. The tendril of magic wrapped around the whisper sent shivers down his spine like a bolt of electricity.
“Hello, Molly. It is actually Black now.” Bellatrix offers the red-headed woman a disarming smile. Harry had seen her use this tactic many times. “To what do I owe the pleasure today?”
Pulling back with a sharp hiss Harion watches as a drop of blood form at the finger the door had pricked with magic. The door lights brilliant green before the doors swing open with ease. The open into a massive anti-chamber. The odd visage of the chamber shimmers just once before disappearing altogether. Where massive statues of a man with a long beard and snakes once were stood a massive antechamber with towering pillars and four massive metal doors also inscribed with words and snakes.
Molly Weasley looks unhappy to have not found much to use on Harry’s mother, he knew the Weasley woman hated his mother for unknown reasons. “Have a very nice day Mrs. Weasley and Ms. Weasley. It was a pleasure meeting you.” Harry hurries up the steps of the bank following obediently after his mother. He had always like the bank. The goblins were fairly ugly looking, but they were rather interesting. They ran a good business and Harry had the sneaking suspicion that they could cripple the entirety of the Wizarding world with little effort. He was always told to be polite but poised when it came to doing business with the Goblins.
“I was in a soul bonding contract…” Bellatrix stares down at the table once more thinking of the pain that still felt far too fresh for being ten years ago. “When he died the curse broke because my magic surged.”
“I believe he was talking about Remus Lupin.” Narcissa raises a slender eyebrow. She did not seem to be connecting the dots as easily as Bellatrix. Perhaps Bella was just as insane as her cousin. It was quite possible. “Lupin means of the wolf and wolves howl at the moon Cissa. Catch up. They also used to call Remus Moony. I remember James telling me that in a letter once.”
Azkaban was cold and damp and made Bellatrix shiver in disgust. She was so entirely grateful to the team of mind healers who had helped keep her from this place. Just the thought of being sent here made her want to empty the contents of her stomach. She would not have lasted very long in here with how destroyed her mind already was after the war. She felt bad for all the prisoners. No matter what heinous acts they may have committed in their lives no one deserves to live in such filth. Even the spineless men and women who worshiped the ground the dark lord walked on did not deserve this squalor. They certainly did not deserve luxury, but they deserve the right to have sanity and simply sit in isolation lamenting on their mistakes for the rest of their days. Insanity was an easy way out of atoning for your actions.
“Yes,” Bellatrix whispers. She wanted to take Harry from the school as soon as she collected her thoughts earlier today but knew that it would arouse suspicions if she picked him up randomly without much notice. Samhain was a few weeks away, to begin with, and she was picking him up then to visit graves of past relatives as well as to visit Lily and James Potter's graves. Her heart ached for the love she lost. The memory of the pain of the bonding contract snapping away from her soul with the departure of his felt fresh with the memory newly uncovered. She knew that there were clearly underhanded dealings that occurred and had a feeling that James Potter knew more than he let on when he passed on. “Narcissa, I vaguely recall a letter. It came when I was deep in the clutches of the imperius. It’s a fractured memory, one that hasn’t cleared up yet, but it was from James.”
“Ah, what a shame. Sweets should be available to every child.” Harry nearly frowns but keeps his face in check afraid of showing too much. “Your mother, if you don’t mind my asking, who is she?”
“I’ll have you know, child, that we age very well. My grandfather lived to be the tender age of nearly two hundred. Unfortunately, my siblings met tragic fates and my father died of dragon pox. Merope was murdered by her husband shortly after her son’s death. That muggle man beat her to death, and she loved him too greatly to raise a hand to him in defense. She died the year I was born. Morfin shared the same genetic malformation as his mother and died shortly before his eighteenth birthday. Heaven forbid I age like that blasted old man you have for a headmaster!” Harion giggles softly envisioning the lithe regal man standing before him in atrocious orange robes with a long scraggly white beard and hair. “Do not. Absolutely not. Do not envision me in his robes. Salazar forbid, I even fell into such insanity as to think something so horrendous was fashionable.”
They all turn at their head of house’s sharp drawl and Draco waits until the last person in the common room returns to their rooms leaving only himself and the rest of their small group of first years behind. “Sir, is she alright?” Theo asks quietly looking down at his shoes.
Bellatrix offers Severus a mysterious smile filled with many emotions he found himself unable to name. He’d seen a myriad of emotions cross her face in the many years they had worked side by side before, during, and after the war. These were not among them. It almost looked like resignation. “Yes. My Harion is an intelligent boy, wise beyond his year mates, but he is still just a boy. There is not much that he does that I am not aware of...even now.” Severus notices another mysterious emotion crossing her gaze when she turns her eyes to look at him. It was almost as if she was looking into his soul and assessing him.
“Now, now. We cannot be too rash. He’s got to have gotten the idea from someone somewhere, no?” Harry glances up at Pansy acknowledging her point briefly before returning to his book. He’d been having his mother mail them to him because all the ones he wanted to read in the library were seemingly borrowed out all the time by the bookish Gryffindor with bushy hair. Harry had also heard whispers that the others were not quite nice to her either and that had made him significantly unhappy. It was on the tip of his tongue to let it slip to Theo, whose unhealthy obsession had only grown, that there were whispers in the walls that his little Gryffindor was being treated less than pleasantly. “Probably from his siblings or hag of a mother.”
Harion glances around the room once more wondering what secrets lay behind the doors present. Surely Slytherin’s long thought lost library would reside here where only his blood could find it. Perhaps even more could be found in the depths of their passages if his mother and grandfather hadn’t thought to remove such things.
Harry woke up earlier than he normally would have on a Saturday morning. His eyes are instantly drawn to the mop of silvery blond hair that is nuzzled into his collarbones. Draco’s body heat has seeped through the blankets and warmed up Harry’s cold limbs. Even at only eleven, barely near the beginning of growth spurts, Draco’s legs are miles longer than Harry’s. Harry’s toes brush against the middle of Draco’s shins and Draco’s has one long leg wrap haphazardly around Harry’s legs.
“I suppose so, but, you and I both know that things are not always what they appear to be.” Draco twines their fingers together and begins pulling Harry toward the door. “Don’t believe anything that foul red-headed Weasel has to say to you.”
“Ah yes. Albus tried very hard to make sure my mother’s name would never be found.” Marvolo waves his hand and the beautiful visage of a beautiful auburn brown-haired woman appears. There were age lines around her eyes and mouth as if she had lived a full life of happiness despite her child being stolen from her. Her eyes were burgundy colored just like Marvolo. He looked a great deal like her. Aristocratic and poised. She wasn’t a spindle thin woman by any means, but she wasn’t large either. There was a warmth to her picture. “My mother’s name was Isadora Selwyn. She was a beautiful woman and well respected in the ministry. She had worked with the French liaison office for several years but left and lived in France after my disappearance. I tracked her down through the Malfoy family. Lillian said that she died about a year before she was born or so my journals told her when she found them in the Slytherin vault. My mother left her entire estate to any children I may have had because she feared for my mind when I started splitting my soul. You’ll likely inherit the estate when you reach majority. I believe she may have been the last Selwyn alive but I’m not sure.”
The platform is crowded with people saying their goodbyes and last minute warnings of children of all ages. Some had moist eyes and some looked relieve to be free of their children for one more year and resigned to the quiet of an empty home. Almost instantly the little boy could tell which few were pureblood brought up and which were not because they stood quietly with their parents in a startlingly appropriate way. Younger ones gave quick hugs goodbye and older ones offered a few parting words before leaving quickly to the train to board.
Draco ignores them all and barely gets Harion to his bed before the younger boy collapses into the sheets like dead weight. His entire boy curls forward into the smallest, tightest ball possible. Draco had been angry at being brushed off for so long but all of that evaporated upon seeing the hollowness of the other boy. Draco had seen this plenty of times in their younger years together. Harion was easily pushed too far back then. He trusted little and always thought the worst of any situation.
Harry had not noticed that everyone had long put away their letters and begun eating their breakfast. Draco seemed worried for a moment before raising a silent silver brow in question. Harry knew that it would be difficult knowing who he was initially born as and how the professors must have expected him to be here this year. He knew that he also had several looks on his back already with being an unexpected arrival. “Mother is fairing I suppose. She says the house is quiet, frighteningly so she says.” The thought alone brings a small smile to his lips. To others it may seem as it the phrase was oddly out of place but to him it meant she was faring well.
“Yes, yes, I know dear.” Narcissa grins vibrantly. She steps lithely around a pile of books on the floor and tiptoes up to press a warm kiss to the corner of her husband’s lips. Bellatrix wonders idly for a moment if she would have lived I such domestic bliss had it not been for someone meddling in her mind. The thought pains her. “Thank you, Lucius. Really. It means a lot to me.”
“And at the moment we have no way of confirming or denying Sirius’ knowledge of any of this.” Narcissa huffs quietly and taps her nails against the edge of the armchair she’s sitting in. “Even with this knowledge, what would we be able to do with any of this information until Harion comes of age or is better protected from Albus.”
Harry knows that his mother’s desire for him to greet the woman as a proper well-mannered boy was left unsaid. He bows his head shortly to the woman and offers her a polite smile. She looked surprised that he was eleven years old. “Good morning Mrs. Weasley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I hope your day has been enjoyable so far Ma’am.” The woman looks pleasantly surprised by his manners and almost coos at him. She likely would have if Bellatrix Black was not his mother. He almost hated her for it.
“That why you don’t remember much of what happened that night and why you have yet to prove your innocence in regard to Alice and Frank Longbottom.” It was not a question. It was a statement more so than a question. “What about Severus does he know?”
“If a portion of my soul has taken over the man, then he will die, little one.” Harry frowns at that and turns toward the fire. “If that is the truth take this with you. It will react to another part of my soul if it is truly near.”
The little boy nods determinedly and shuffles away from his mother who is straightening to her full height once more. His mother really was a lovely woman. Her glassy blue eyes and striking black hair were enough to draw eye to her and yet her alluringly strong disposition made people want to be seen with her despite her past mistakes. She was powerful and her magic radiated from her even when it was under control.
“Pans, I adore you and we’ve practically been raised together, but I will end you.” Harry glares sharply and for anyone else, it might have made them run for the hills. Pansy merely laughs and went back to filing her nails. “Though I am unaware of why Snape dislikes me, that has not influenced my decision.”
“No thank you, sir. I don’t much care for sweets.” That was not much of a lie. They did tend to upset his stomach when he was younger and he never quite grew a taste for them after that. Being starved by muggles for the first however many years of his life would do that to a child. He was still quite a small boy and ate alarmingly less than his friends. His stomach was always still a bit more unpredictable as well. “Mother didn’t allow them to me as a boy because they upset my stomach.”
Draco had not ever been one to be bested and would read the book as soon as Harry had finished it which landed the two of them sitting rather high at the top of their year by the time Samhain was approaching. Despite this Harry had grown unusually unnerved by the defense against the dark arts professor. Quirrel was an odd sort of man who appeared perpetually frightened or simply insane at the best of times. His head was constantly wrapped in a misshapen turban and Harry had caught him on more than one occasion talking to himself in a plethora of voices. He had complained several times to his mother who appeared thoughtful and oddly wary of Harry’s description. She had passed on the advice to merely steer clear of the man for the time being.
“That blasted old dodger. Merlin help that man when I finally corner him. I’ll burn him alive from the inside out. Stupid old coot.” Harry murmurs quietly under his breath until he reaches Draco who raises an eyebrow questioningly. He’d left Harry in a fairly good mood and it looks as if he’d travel into hell to murder hell’s master at this rate. “If that bloody old man thinks for one second he can threaten my mother I’ll have him beheaded! I’ll- I’ll- I’ll have him turned into a squib! Yes! I’ll make that bloody fool into a squib!”
“Of course. I needed to make sure he knew not to lay a finger on my son.” Severus could see a bit of the Black insanity shine through her eyes when she spoke. It was refreshing in a bone-chilling kind of way. It reminded him that this was in fact Bellatrix Black that he was speaking to and not some clone of the woman or someone under polyjuice as her. “That’s not the point. When I spoke to him I asked him if he knew that Lily Potter was his daughter. He said that he had known about her for a very long time and had actually been in contact with her through journals he left to her. He knew that she and Harry shared his blood.”
“Um sorry for interrupting but you wouldn’t have happened to see a toad?” They share an amazed glance at such an incredibly odd statement but then again most muggle born must already feel they are in dream land getting on a magical train to go to a magical school. “You see Neville seemed to have lost his.”
“Sure, preservation. It isn’t merely because you know Snape doesn’t favor you?” Pansy glances down at her nails and bites back a grin when she catches Harry glaring at her. “Of course not. You’re Mother merely taught you that you trust no one but your future bonded.”
“Even Andromeda refuses to speak to us on principle.” Bellatrix sighs softly thinking about the sister who was born between her and Narcissa. She had always adored Andromeda. Despite not being the youngest their parents often babied Andromeda. Narcissa had always been quite well mannered and independent. She met Lucius at a young age and demanded her bonding contract from birth be absolved in favor of a true bonding contract with Lucius Malfoy because she believed in her entire being that Lucius was her soulmate and he well and truly may be. Bellatrix had never had as much vigor as Narcissa. Narcissa was quite like their cousin. “Narcissa! Sirius!”
Theodore for what it was worth looked a bit surprised that Pansy Parkinson of all people was asking him about the muggleborn girl he had been so taken with. Harry would have laughed in any other situation but to Pansy, Theo was as close of a brother than any she would ever have after being raised together for so long. It was obviously putting Pansy out that her friend was suddenly so upset by the treatment of the muggleborn despite their upbringing. Theo being upset to Pansy was like Blaise being upset to Draco or Harry.
All eyes turn to Draco as he speaks but they quickly linger to Harry who is staring pointedly down ta his food. Between the two of them, Draco took the lead more often than not and he knew Harry’s moods better than anyone else in the world including their parents. When something upset Harry, it upset Draco, and therefore Draco would do whatever it was to eliminate that cause of Harry’s unease. If it meant befriending a friendless muggleborn than he supposes he would do that as well.
“My son is adopted. He was unofficially blood adopted by the Head of House Black, my cousin, Sirius Black.” The Goblin does not look as shocked as what many other people would be. Most of the time the Goblins did not dwell in issues of wizards. They did banking and as long as the wizard’s business did not mess with their money they wouldn’t get involved. “I was informed recently after paying my cousin a visit that my son may have also been blood adopted by another Pureblood Lord.”
The sorting hat is introduced to them and then the little girl in front of him is called up and very quickly sorted into Hufflepuff. “Harion Black!” He steps agilely up to the chair where the sorting hat and the little girl before him had sat. The eyes of the professors bore holes into him as he takes a seat quietly and takes in the entirety of the crowd. The hat falls on his head and his eyes widen the smallest fraction as it begins to speak to him inside his mind.
Those that were not paying attention turned their gazes toward the pair as a delighted cackle flutters out of the once crazed Black sister. A delightful praise leaves her lips and the little boy giggles softly in her arms making the sparks appear once more. “Oh how wonderful. Good job!” The little boy claps excitedly and surprises himself when a fuller and more bright set of sparks is released from his fingertips. A few lights flicker in the room before returning to the dull glow they had been set at.
“You’re a pig Nott.” Pansy sips her drink while Blaise agrees with a hum. Theo frowns before pushing Blaise sharply. “It’s the truth. Besides mother said not to associate with mudbloods. They’ll only tarnish more of the traditions.”
“Tell me, Severus,” Bellatrix starts after refilling her own cup of tea. “Are you aware that The Dark Lord is currently possessing the Defense Professor?” Severus very nearly spits his tea out had it not been for the intensive Pureblood training his grandfather had put him through in his youth. He had not expected her to be so blunt about what was going on at Hogwarts.
Harry reaches forward and places a restrictive hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco’s warmth even seeps through the heavy fabric of their school cloaks. He’d always loved how nicely the blonde’s heat felt against his skin. It felt like home. “What need Black to keep you back? How sad that the son of a death eater needs to restrain you.” Blaise watches as Harry’s eyes narrow and he nearly moves to attack the redhead when Snape sweeps between them.
“No. It’s not.” Severus settles his hands in his lap still carefully cradling the teacup and plate. He felt, suddenly, the weight of his own guilt. He had never been very good at saying what it was that was in his heart or on his mind. Lily had truly been the only person to ever be able to understand what he was feeling without words. He’d never had to say much when he was with her she just knew. “I fear I may have made a mistake. I...when Harion told me I was unprepared for the wealth of emotion such a thing would bring up in me. I believe I may have given him the impression that he was unwanted or unaccepted which is the furthest thing from the truth. Now, he and Draco both avoid me as if I am the plague.”
Several purebloods of other houses that honor the old ways can be seen offering a food and beverage to the center of the table in front of them. Many appear to be vanishing food and drinks, likely to set up an altar to the dead in private rather than in the presence of their unknowing housemates. Halloween, as the muggles call it, is much different than Samhain. It merely for fun and to gorge ones-self full of candy and sweets whereas their weekly long celebration of the dead is much more respectful.
“She means the name that Albus decided he would give to me after obliviating me and forcing me into an orphanage at the tender age of five.” Harion whirls around and narrows his eyes at the visage of a man much older than him but with the same startling killing curse green eyes. He was tall and slender with auburn colored hair and smooth porcelain skin. “To think all you got of Lillian was her eyes. Everything else was muddled with Potter and Black genetics.”
“I believe we have spoken of everything we desired, Severus. We will learn little else tonight.” Severus nods and finishes his tea. The room was still warm and he felt more tired than he thought. There was less of a weight on his shoulders. It had been many years since he truly felt that things were looking up for him. Perhaps, together with Lucius and Narcissa, the two of them could protect the last part of Lily left living. “It’s late. You are welcome to the guest room. Floo travel may be too dangerous this late. You may do as you wish but the offer stands.”
“Yet, you trust me to make a safe decision on what to do with them?” Severus feels the tips of his ears heating at her playful tone. While it was the truth he had hoped not to reveal too much of himself to her in saying that. He trusted her. It was something almost foreign to him. He knew she was a more than capable witch with knowledge and power appropriate for her lineage. He also knew she would do anything in her power to protect Harion. She would ensure that they were properly cared for. “I understand you trust me with the safety of Harion and that I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize his well being. Unfortunately, neither of us can directly come in contact with the two that are in the school. Only those of his blood can directly come in contact with them. There is also the issue of one of them being located in the Chamber of Secrets which you cannot enter unless you speak parsel.”
Severus is utterly confused because, to his knowledge and the rest of the wizarding world, James Potter is long dead and burned. Waving his wand in a complicated secrecy spell, Severus asks his next question.  “Forgive me Harion but is James Potter not long dead.” Harion’s eyes flicker up to meet his before glancing back down at the parchment slid in his books. Severus now notices how thick the parchment truly it and how fine quality it is. If he wasn’t mistaken it looks like official goblin parchment.
The lighter haired Black sister is joined by her sibling whose mass of black curls are tied neatly back into a bun for the moment. After her short stint in Azkaban and the resulting treatments from mind healers she had been progressively getting to become more and more sane and the first to change had been her ragged appearance. Her time spent at Malfoy manner after her release had seemingly done her a great deal of good. The imperious curse had incredibly powerful and lasting effects when it was used as long as it had been on the willful minds of the Black family.
Harry happily follows his mother out the massive doors of the receiving hall. He does not miss the eyes of the headmaster following him out or the way Draco glares at the crazy old man for watching Harry and his mother’s interactions so intently. They quickly traverse the long path toward the apparition point and Harry hurries along to keep up with the quick strides of his mother. Finally, when they reach a point just outside of the Hogwarts wards and out of the view of other visitors does his mother stops walking. Bellatrix turns instantly toward him and drops to her knees pulling him into a bone crushing hug.
“I don’t have to know what happened to know.” Draco pulls Harion impossibly closer. He’d always been bigger than Harion, but it was even more now that they were hitting their growth spurts. Draco towered over Harion. He could practically hide Harion with his body if he really felt like it. “I know that you’re not at fault.”
“And my grandmother?” Marvolo looks off into the distance again. There was a lovesick sort of sadness in his gaze. “What about her. Did she live? Did she die protecting her child?”
“My, such a well-mannered boy you have here.” Molly Weasley hooks an arm around her daughter who keeps glancing at Harry before glancing away. She looks painfully shy and Harry almost feels sorry for her for being exposed to so many people. “He’s quite small for being a first year. I don’t remember any of the Black boys being quite so small.”
“So you’re saying that Marvolo Riddle was actually the Dark Lord Voldemort?” Bellatrix nods sending a few more strands of hair tumbling down from her bun. Clicking her tongue she plucks her wand from her hair and with a simple swish the strands are rearranging themselves haphazardly once more. Severus watches as she tucks the wand back into her hair. “Who is Tom Riddle then?”
The bell signaling the end of class sounds and Professor Snape doesn’t turn from the papers on the desk when he speaks up over the students. “Mr. Black please remain behind.” Draco glances at Harry and Harry turns his eyes away from the blond. Draco huffs angrily and storms out of the room with Pansy and Blaise hot on his heels. The Gryffindors stare at the three retreating backs before shrugging and making jokes. Harion picks at the edge of a piece of parchment tucked into his textbook.
“I’m going to miss you too my little lord.” His mother pulls away from him and fixes at his collar until it looks neat and presentable. “Now hurry on to the platform alright. Your luggage is already on the train. Find little Dray and the two of you will find a compartment. Be good this year.”
Because this account is mainly one where I write my main ship from another fandom, I've decided to make a new account strictly for hp works. I have two that are in my wips folder alongside the Little Lord. This work will be a slow transition into my other account. I will be doing that by adding my new account as a co-author. I will continue to post this work under this user for the next few updates or perhaps until this is finished and then I will be removing Alia_Lee as an author from the work.
“Yes, I had deduced that it might be about that on my own my darling wife.” Lucius shuffles toward another bookshelf tucked a bit further back and plucks a book from its hold. He opens it to the first few pages and flips through them before huffing and snapping it closed. “What makes you think he would even agree to speak with you two, to begin with? Or have you both forgotten that you are estranged?”
Silence descends on the room and Bellatrix realizes that she had never in fact even thought of sharing the revelation with Severus when it was revealed to her at Gringotts. The thought of him being Harion’s father crossed her mind fleetingly before being overshadowed by the fact that Lily was a Gaunt and the daughter of the Dark Lord. She’d never stopped to even think of contacting Severus. Now that she had, she was not sure she wanted to. Not only would he have the ability to claim guardianship rights over Harion, but he also might not even believe her and treat Harion even worse than he already does. Severus was a tricky man and would not believe her words alone. Selfishly she wanted to keep this from him to protect her own right to her son but on the other hand, Harion deserved to know the last living biological parent he had left.
Blaise raises an inquisitive eyebrow at Harry. “It certainly sounds to me that you have your own doubts or agenda here. Care to share?” Blaise was intuitive and had learned from his mother how to read people. He was the only one other than Pansy out of all the Slytherins who could call out Harry or Draco and get away with it without their heads being snipped off by Draco. At times, it could be quite irritating.
“Perhaps Mr. Black you should return to your common room until dinner.” There is a very brief look of devastation that crossed Harion’s eyes before it disappears behind the mask of pureblood upbringing. Severus is certain that he has come to the wrong conclusion, but he couldn’t bring himself to comment on any of this information without really coming to terms with everything. “It would likely be for the best that you speak to very few about the information you overheard Harion.”
Bellatrix and Lucius both watch as the lean witch attempts to firecall the werewolf who had imprinted and then bonded with their cousin so long ago. After a few moments, Narcissa steps back and gives the two a short nod. A few moments more and the floo is lighting green as a figure steps through the flames.
The portrait falls closed once every last student was in the common room, not many of them were standing around, to be honest, but they were huddled into groups with the first years being effectively pushed further into the common space away from the portrait as time ticked by.
“Ah, yes. My mother is picking me up as early as possible as she wants to visit all of the graves of the black family.” The unsaid point of his mother and father’s grave was wholly understood by Draco who was one of the only people that knew he had once been Harry Potter. “It will be a long day, as is normal for us, but then we will likely share dinner at the cottage before returning late in the evening. It is always quite hard on mother to visit the graves. So many of the Blacks have been lost in recent years.”
Severus takes the parchment that Harion slides across the benchtop to him with stiff fingers. Perhaps if he stares close enough, he could see it in the color of the boy's hair and the seemingly too round shape of his eyes or the subtle curvature of his nose but in the same breath, he looked for all the world like a Potter or a Black.
“Imagine my surprise when The Dark Lord we knew was actually Lily’s father and likely would not have been able to kill her.” Severus is glad he wasn't about to drink tea or he surely would have spit it out. He knew that Lily was a Gaunt but he hadn’t connected that Marvolo Gaunt, her father, was actually the insane Dark Lord. Albus had often told him that The Dark Lord was the half-blood child born out of a love potion to Merope Gaunt named Tom Riddle. On Harion’s family tree there had been a Tom Riddle who would have been Lily’s cousin and about the same age as her father but Severus had written that off. “Slytherin familial magic is said to be incredibly strict when it comes to using magic against blood family members. Gaunt family magic by extension is also quite strict about aggressive magic against fellow family members. From my understanding, it is a way to protect the legacy of the lineage. The Black family has similar regulations.”
Sirius looks between the two women for a few long moments before leaning back in his chair. “No. Not biologically.” Sirius pauses to collect his thoughts and Bellatrix lets him, knowing that he was trying to figure out what to say without outright giving up their many secrets. “James had never helped to conceive a child. However, he and I both have an heir and son.”
Severus nods encouraging the boy forward. There were many a plethora of things that could have been spoken about not all of them good or all of them bad. He was just as confused now as he was before.
Draco’s hand is gripping tightly to Harry’s no dominant hand and his grey eyes are darting back and forth knowingly. Harry only ever grew this quiet was he was truly and frightening angrily. Draco could already see the green of his eyes getting a tad brighter and his skin darkening just the slightest. Harry’s uncontrolled magical abilities were horrifying to witness.
Now, after finally having broken the blockage, Bellatrix is not so sure that she had wanted to. Things were still partially fragmented, something Bellatrix had become accustomed to, and there were no answers yet. Bella only had questions. Many people, who did not know the art of mind healing, thought that the healing was instantaneous and that the memories returned suddenly. Sadly, as much as she wished that to be so, it was not. Memories were fickle and often would return in segments often different segments of different memories forming at the same time. Rarely do memories return whole or in a form that makes sense.
“Elspeth left me. My journals, the last of them I had written and stowed away for Lillian, said that she left me or rather that I had sent her away in a fit of insanity. My journals, Lillian said, repeatedly went back and forth between finding her and begging her forgiveness and leaving her to her own safety. Lillian never found her as far as I’m aware.” Marvolo tilts his head back obviously unsettled by the living half of his soul becoming so insane as to send his own love away. “I wish beyond hope to see her alive and well someday but, I am but a mere portion of a soul housed in a bloody book. What can I hope to give her when I supposedly attacked my own grandson? I don’t even know where what little of my soul is at? I fear I’ll never see her face again.”
Bellatrix sits with her head slumped down and a cup of cooling tea in front of her. A loose piece of parchment sits rolled up just to the left of the tea and her sister sits quietly across from her sipping on another cup of tea. Lucius resides on the sofa across from them with another piece of parchment in his hand reading it over intently.
Severus finds himself taken aback. He often had joined the Malfoy family for Yule feast but never the morning of Yule or the eve before. Those were times set aside strictly for the family. Bellatrix had always been overly protective of her time with her son. She would ensure that he experienced each of the sabbats to their fullest extent. Yule especially was an important time of year for them since it had been Harion’s first sabbat spent with them. He’d been found shortly after Samhain.  To be invited into her home on one of the most important and cherished Sabbats to her and Harion was something he would not take lightly. Were it anyone else he would likely refuse but a part of him desired, more than anything, to know his son.
“I still argue she was missorted with those bunch,” Pansy says with a flick of her black hair over her shoulder. Her nose scrunches in the oddly unflattering way that makes her look like those dogs with the scrunched up faces that muggles love so much. “Should have been a Ravenclaw I say.”
Draco groans and burrows his face further into Harry’s neck forcing a shiver to run down Harry’s spine. Harry can feel his chest tightening a bit at the outright affection. He had always loved cuddling with Draco but lately, his heart rate tended to pick up the pace in the morning when he woke to the usual blond halo of hair that greeted his vision.
Draco’s eagle owl reached the table with precision followed closely by the snowy white owl his mother had bought him just days before when they were shopping for the last of his things. He had named the pristine female Hedwig. Clutched in her talons is a piece of parchment sealed with the colorless black wax of the Black family.
“That is why I fear I may have made a terrible mistake.” Bellatrix sets her empty cup aside and folds her hands across her lap turning her too aware gaze toward the flickering flames of the fire.  Her curls sway slightly with the movement and Severus wonders just how much longer until they all come tumbling down from where they are piled haphazardly atop her head. Her hair was not the tangled mess it had once been. No. There was an effortless kind of beauty in the chaos of her curls now. She clearly cared for them and kept them clean and managed but she was also not as bothered to keep them in pristine order either. “If Harion believes I do not want him I fear there will be very little that I can do to change his mind.”
Harry very nearly runs to the woman in excitement upon finally seeing her. He had missed his mother dearly and hated being away from her for so long. Her wild inky curls were pulled away from her eyes in a neat half-up hairstyle with the rest cascading down the back of her dark green robes. Her black dress was left partially exposed. Instead of running to her, Harry brusquely walks toward her and offers her a controlled smile.
Severus opens the Goblin sealed parchment and finds himself shown the heritage of once Harion Orion Black is also known as Harry James Potter…also known as Harrison Thomas Prince. Severus could not take his eyes off the beautiful magical line connecting both his name and Lillian Gaunt’s name with a male child born on as the seventh month dies. It was all here written before him on undeniable paper. The boy had likely stolen this paperwork or made a copy of it knowing that Gringotts paperwork would be copied as an exact replica.
“The dangerous has been eliminated. It is in your best bet to return to your chambers for the night and be prepared for tomorrow evening. Many of you will have parents coming to gather you for Samhain remembrance tomorrow morning and I assure you that your parents would not like to dawdle.” Many students begin to turn toward their halls to turn in for night understanding that their head of house was not suggesting that they sleep. Instead, Severus Snape had just commanded his house to go to bed now that the threat to their lives was taken care of. “Mr. Malfoy if you would remain for a moment.”
“No of course not.” Harion rolls his eyes and begins walking toward the entrance to the chamber. It was probably around dinner time by now. They would be leaving for break tomorrow, so he probably needed to show his face for a little. He really needed to speak with Draco. “But it’s better than being bald and not having a nose.” Marvolo scoffs and rolls his eyes before disappearing.
Dray latches onto his hand and tugs him toward the train while waving excitedly back at his parents who are watching on in trepidation. The train is larger than it appears and there are students milling about excitedly talking with one another and trying desperately to find good seats before the train departs. By some stroke of luck, the pair of them end up finding an empty compartment near the back of the train and settling in alongside one another with their uniforms and wands.
“You are quite an intelligent child, aren’t you?” Marvolo takes a step forward and brushes a hand through a loose lock of black hair that was curling around his eyes. It was an odd feeling. His hands were not quite true flesh and blood, but it also lacked that ghostly quality that ghosts like the Bloody Baron had. “Pray tell, where did you discover such knowledge that took me nearly seven years here to find? It is likely not something an eleven-year-old should have knowledge of.”
Bellatrix nods and glances down at Harry. He knows that she was going to tell the Goblin that Harry was adopted, and it was something they rarely spoke about. For Harry, he hated reliving those moments he spent with those retched muggles. For Bellatrix the time she spent before having him as a child were some of her worst moments.
Draco holds the younger boy just a smidge tighter and wonders who it could be that would be stupid enough to turn Harion away. “Who?” The question is so quiet that even without privacy spells no one would have been able to hear it except for Harion.
Bellatrix almost sneers in contempt at the woman. She knew her child was small, years of mistreatment from those damned muggles had stunted his growth. She, however, did not like what the Weasley matriarch was implying by stating how small he was. “Ah yes, he is quite small for his age. He’s merely not reached his growth spurts yet. Cousin Regulus was quite small for his age as well until right before Hogwarts.” Molly Weasley looks less than pleased to be proven wrong. Harry feels vicious pride in his mother for handling the situation so well. Bellatrix obviously glances at her watch and offers Molly Weasley a look filled with false surprise. “I apologize for cutting our conversation short Molly, but I fear we will be late for our meeting the Goblins.”
Marvolo gets a look of wonder in his eyes. “Elspeth Ross. Lillian never said who her mother was. She only said that she had a cousin who had taught her here and that she kept the knowledge to herself for fear of it reaching Albus. Even I don’t think he ever knew who her mother was.” Harry nods softly and chuckles because Albus certainly seemed interested in the parentage of students, didn’t he? “Elspeth Ross was truly a beauty. She had an older sister. Isobel was nearly ten years older than her. Elspeth used to joke that her parents had not planned for her, but magic sought out putting her in this earthly realm. She had the most beautiful of auburn hair, not unlike your mother. Her eyes were the very same shape you and your mother share. She was a devious sort of girl. Her mind was brilliant, but she never had a true desire for the grandness than I always dreamt of. She wanted happiness and home and love. I used to think that she was the sort of girl my mother would have been proud of me for bringing home.”
“While I agree with you,” Harry says in a quiet whisper. “I don’t think our mothers would appreciate being kept waiting especially if they got word of a troll being in the dungeons.” Draco sighs softly and sits up in Harry’s bed. His bunk had pretty much remained untouched for the entirety of the year so far. He’d spent every night curled around Harry, much to the humor of their friends.
Remus Lupin was still a slender and handsome as he had been when they were in school together. Time had aged him some and his features were splashed with many more scars than ever before, but his blonde hair was still beautiful and vibrant a sign of a strong bond to his mate. A werewolf with a strong bond to their chosen wizard could survive a great deal more than an unmated one. He brushed off the soot that had collected on his jacket pocket and takes a deep long breath before releasing it through his teeth and turning golden eyes toward the hallway housing the stairwell.
“You must be a horcrux then or at least powered by the magic of one left here by your other half in your youth.” The man looks stunned for a long moment. He could not have been any older than perhaps twenty. His age had likely progressed thanks to the influx of familial magic housed in the chambers. “You’ve been aged by the familial magic no doubt, so you were likely sixteen or seventeen when you split your soul. Based on my limited knowledge, you must be my grandfather Marvolo.”
Bellatrix nods before offering her hand out to her son. Harry latches onto the appendage with a tight grip as the telltale pull of apparition appears near his navel. With a twist, they apparate away and into an alley near the bank. Bellatrix hurries them along through the crowd of people moving through Diagon Alley. Her eyes remain partially drawn to her son to ensure the small boy is not swept away by the larger force of the crowd. Upon noticing a larger woman pushing her way through the crowd with a petite red-haired girl, Bellatrix reaches out to grip her son's shoulder and pulls him tighter toward her hip knowing that she was the woman’s destination.
“Yes, you are one of very few remaining.” Blaise whispers. Harry wondered if he often forgot that he and Harry were in a similar position. Blaise was the last male Zabini and he and his mother were the only two left in existence after his uncle murdered his father in a jealous rage and then was given the kiss.  “It is a heavy weight to hold on your shoulder when you are the last of your line.”
“If you really must know,” Narcissa sniffs indignantly. “Bellatrix and I would like to speak with him concerning anything he may know about the night that the Potters died or even goings on before that moment.”
“They’re alive.” A collective breath of relief is released throughout the room and several sets of eyes flicker to the odd assortment of completely undisturbed first years near the fire. Some had not even stopped what they were doing to watch the scene unfold, as if it was an everyday occurrence. “It appears as if we have another Prince since Black properly defeated Gregorys. Someone clean them up and untie them. Leave them with a few bruised ribs will you. They need some pain to remember their lesson.”
of October 1981. Almost Ten years ago to the date.” Sirius barks out a laugh and leans back in his chair sounding almost neurotic.
“I do not smell dishonesty in your words.” Remus sits stiffly in the chair offered to him. His gold eyes never turn away from Bellatrix. “How did you come into contact with James and why did he task you with caring for our cub?”
“You know I had thought I was going insane in here! I thought that everything I remembered before coming in here was just a crazy fucking dream!” Sirius leans forward before roughly running a ragged hand through his hair and hissing quietly when it snags on a tangled knot. “I’m not fucking barmy after all. Jamie really wasn’t a prick. He would have never with a woman already dating someone else you know. He didn’t with Lily. He was fucking smitten! You were all he talked about for months. I got so disgusted hearing about it…hid out in the library with Remus of all places.”
“He’ll go and get her just for that,” Blaise says to placate Theo. Harry rubs a hand up and down his back nodding along with Blaise. Blaise turns toward Draco and raises an eyebrow questioningly. “Why did you claim her as a snake in the lion’s den? What does that even mean?”
“He’s fine, Bellatrix. I believe he’s in the library at this very moment studying for his potions exam.” Severus watches as the worry that had stiffened her shoulders falls away from her upon knowing her son was safe. He had at one point worried if leaving Lily’s son with Bellatrix Lestrange was a good idea but the woman loved Harry more than anything else in this world and would quite literally kill anyone who dared harm her son. Severus could only think, all those years ago, that Lily would want someone who loved Harry unwaveringly to take him in and raise him. It was only the genuine love and adoration he saw for Harry in Bellatrix that made him even consider leaving Harry with the Malfoy family. There was something in her gaze, even then still on the brink of mental destruction, that told him she would do anything and everything to protect the tiny mute boy in her arms. “I was hoping to speak to you about something a bit more...confidential.”
Severus was not sure exactly what he was thanking the woman for but it felt like a necessity for him to do so. He had never had such a pleasant conversation with her before. Surprisingly, she was a phenomenal conversationalist. He did not doubt that it was the pureblood upbringing. The Black Family were known to be inviting hosts and part of that must be knowing how to converse. It certainly would make sense. Narcissa was the same way. Her presence alone put you at ease. It must have been something taught to them. That night Severus finds himself staring up at the ceiling of the guest bedroom wondering just how Bellatrix Black had looked through him with such ease. Few had been able to see into his innermost workings. It left him feeling vulnerable but also intrigued. Just who was Bellatrix Black? What kind of person had she been before her mind had been shattered? Severus wondered just how formidable she must have been.
The headmaster had cornered him and lead him toward his office with a strong hand on his shoulder. He was playing the foolish old bat card but Harry had been warned that he was much more conniving than he looked. He’d also overheard Uncle Lucius one time saying that Dumbledore even sold out his own lover when he went ‘dark’. That one was obviously a conversation he was not meant to overhear. His mother would prefer it if Harry didn’t remember anything at all about his previous childhood and that he was left unaware of the world outside of their home. She’d seen too many horrors of her own not to want to protect him from it all.
“Yes, Miss Granger is as well as could be expected after encountering a mountain troll.” They all nod softly at the information provided for them. Theo visibly relaxes a bit upon hearing it and Pansy laces their hands together tightly to give his hand a reassuring squeeze. Snape levels them all with an intense stare. “I hope that you brats completely understand that Miss Granger is now your responsibility. You’ve made her a snake in the eyes of the entire house so please ensure that she is aware of how to properly act within the confines of wizarding society. I am sure you all are aware enough of that to not completely blunder it all. Good night.”
“Now, now children…we wouldn’t be fighting in the corridor, now would we? I presume you know everything about Death Eaters to be tossing that term about so easily, Mr. Weasley?” Harry feels a long chill go down his spine as the slow drawl that their head of house uses and pulls Draco half a step back to stand in line with him once more. “Or are you all really so stupid that you would purposely fight in the halls? In which case house points would likely be deducted.”
“Let me make one thing perfectly clear.” Harry’s eyes do not move from where they are focused on the two boys. His face is nearly impassive but there is a dangerous aura about him that is petrifying. “The next time any person in this house speaks ill about my mother, or the rest of my family for that matter, I will personally make you aware of how much a single spell can hurt without killing you. The Black library especially has very useful spells for things such as that. Don’t doubt I can’t cast them either, Bellatrix Lestrange is my mother after all.”
Lucius’ tone erred toward questioning their sanity. Narcissa’s narrowing gaze states that she does not appreciate the tone and Lucius almost rolls his eyes at his wife. She was far too stubborn for her own good, but he adored her regardless. He still remembers how she had marched up to him when he was in fourth year and demanded he took her to Hogsmeade on their next free weekend. He had been so startled that he agreed without really giving it much thought. No one had ever dared to speak to him in such a manner. His father had not been particularly happy with his choices that summer, but he had already been under the youngest Black daughter’s spell.
As the night progressed he found himself further and further thrown into a spiral of anger and guilt. Through all the poking and prodding the boy refused to stray far from the crazed Bellatrix Lestrange. His hands gripped onto her with a tightness and desperation Severus had seen only a few times before from children who experienced extreme trauma and abuse. Despite his fear of Severus and Lucius the boy never once uttered a word which Severus would later find out was normal for the boy. He remembers Lucius saying the boy had spoken for the first time when he was seven after living with Bellatrix and the Malfoys for two years.
They both fall silent even if they did not come to a verbal conclusion. They’d known one another for so long that it was hardly a matter of verbalization any longer. Their eyes both turn toward the door as a knock sounds on it and a bushy haired girl peeks her head in.
“They brought you to the Malfoy estate following their discovery of you. And one of the Black sisters took you as their charge. You’d be a Malfoy if it were Narcissa. Andromeda was estranged by then…so Bellatrix.” Harry nods and watches as the mirage of the man takes one great step forward and wraps his arms around Harry bringing him into a hug. “I find myself angry on your behalf little one. Those retched muggles will pay dearly if they still breathe.”
Snape whirls back out of the room leaving them all to be dismissed to their rooms on separate sides of the common room. They bid one another goodnight and the boys disappear into their room. Draco wastes no time with formalities and crawls lithely into Harry’s bed without caring much for the waggling brows of the rest of the room. Harry easily slips into the bed as well and they soon find themselves drifting off to sleep.
“Yes, sir.” Harion frowns and glances back down at his textbook. “I overheard mother speaking with Aunt and Uncle during Samhain. They spoke about something I wasn’t sure mother wanted me to hear yet or ever if I’m to be entirely truthful.”
“We’ll do it.” Bellatrix murmurs. Narcissa snaps her head toward Bellatrix possibly ready to hex the woman, but Bellatrix begins to speak again before she can. “On the stipulation that you answer one question for me.”
Bella may have revealed too much but if it would calm the territorial werewolf that counted her son as a member of his pack then she would lay all of her cards on the table. She had nothing to hide. She had tried, with all her sanity, to raise the little boy in a home filled with love and happiness. How well she had accomplished that was up for debate but there was no one who could say she did not adore the little boy.
Theodore looks around at the small group of first years in shock but also tremendous worry. “Hermione is still in the bathrooms on the second floor. She doesn’t know!” Harry nods sharply knowing that they would likely get into a wonderful amount of trouble if they went after the young witch.
“When everyone died that night, Albus Dumbledore took me from the destroyed home in Godric’s Hollow and left me on the doorstep of Petunia Dursley, nee Evans. She was the woman my mother grew up calling sister. For four years I lived in their care and suffered greatly. Beaten, starved, made to work as a house-elf at that very tender age. The dark faction by some miracle found me in a park hiding from Petunia’s son. My lips were split, eyes blackened, and I was mostly mute.”
The mother and son pair wat patiently for around fifteen or so minutes before another goblin whom Harry was more acquainted with steps out from around the teller desks. “Good afternoon Miss Black and Young Mister Black. Please follow me and we will begin conducting business.” Harry follows his mother and the goblin into the private meeting room.
Severus glares into the fire for a moment. He can still feel the other witch’s gaze on him. It burns into his soul and makes his magic quiver uneasily. Still, he cannot help but wonder just what would have stopped her. “I am unaware of what may have stopped Lily from following through with her promise. At that time we were still with one another and she had yet to have had her memories altered. She was not even pregnant with Harion yet. Perhaps, Albus’s scheming went beyond what we initially thought.” Bellatrix flicks her gaze toward the fireplace and settles her teacup on the table in front of her. The massive clock, that towered in a nearby, corner chimes loudly signaling the late hour. They had certainly been speaking for quite a long time.
The clock in the corner of the manor ticked and rang out eleven times signifying the late hour. Three figures stood in the barely lit entrance way as the doors were opened and several cloaked men and woman stepped through. In one of the first to enters hands was an incredibly small bundle wrapped up in blankets and startlingly quiet despite the bright killing curse eyes blinking toward them. A mass of tight raven colored ringlets poked out from the matted and threadbare blanket wrapped as properly around the little bundle as possible. Dirt and dust was smattered around the little boys gaunt and shallow cheeks and his lip had a shallow cut along the bottom corner. One eye was a tad swollen and yellowing around the edges of a fading bruise.
“Woman, I know that look in your eyes and I can’t say that I’ll enjoy what you will have me do.” Lucius sighs softly and sends the books away from him with a flick of his hand. He then proceeds to run a hand through his hair before standing up from his seated position. His father would have thrown quite the fit if he ever saw the Malfoy lord on the floor, but Lucius often thought his father should have lived a bit more vibrantly. “What is it then?”
“Mother spoke of my father.” Harion closes his eyes and releases a breath like it was drawn from his very core. “She is hesitant to tell him of my existence for fear of losing me…I believe but, at the same time I want to know him.”
“Does he know where these Horcruxes are located?” Severus may not like Albus but Horcruxes were incredibly dark magic and could have lasting consequences if a student stumbles across them. “I’d rather a student didn’t accidentally come across them. I may also be able to gather them and bring them here. I’d rather not give them directly to him if I don’t have to. I still don’t entirely trust him.”
The table falls silent and Harry cannot help but to continuously watch as Theo glances toward the doors again and again. He almost felt bad for his year-mate who obviously was worried for the young girl that none of them had really met before. Harry wondered vaguely if Theodore had befriended the young lioness and that was why he was so worried about her wellbeing.
Sorry for the super long period without an update. I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and before my diagnosis, I was incredibly ill for months on end. I didn't have the energy to do much of anything because I felt so sick much less write. Now that I'm beginning to get back to feeling like myself again I hope to update more! Please enjoy this chapter and look forward to more coming soon!
Lily was kind and caring and everything good in the wretched world of his childhood. Her laughter and her smiles could light hundreds of towns in Severus’ opinion. She was everything wonderful in the world. She often spoke of one day running away together and living in a peaceful little cottage where they could grow all the flowers and foods they could imagine. After their first years at Hogwarts together her dreams had grown into a tiny little cottage on a plot of magical land where Severus could set up a potions lab and she could create new charms in a warded room. Together they could plant vegetables and fruit trees. When Severus had finally worked up the nerve to kiss her under the twinkling lights of the gardens during Yule, her dreams of their future grew to include a tiny family of dark-haired children running about happily and plucking apples from trees as they played.
Hello all! I'm finally back. This year has been crazy hectic and really low for me. My family has suffered several really horrible losses this year and we're finally getting back on our feet and ready for the next year to bring something good for us. That being said I've finally gotten enough inspiration to start writing this story again.
“Of course.” Bellatrix and Narcissa move to stand but before they can turn away from the man, Sirius reach out and grips Bellatrix’s wrist. She and Narcissa both turn to the man who is looking at them desperately. “Just one thing, before you go. How is Harry?”
“Okay then.” All eyes turn to Harry as he places his utensils down and begins to pack away his bag. “Let’s go find her. No one deserves to be friendless.”
“What happened after the contract was absolved? Not long after that the first war really broke out and all of us were controlled in one way or another. Father died shortly after that as well.” Narcissa studies the look of unease on her oldest sister’s face when she speaks of one of the most horrible times in both of their lives. For a moment Bellatrix had thought she would forever be a prisoner in her own mind. “Who was the man you were to be bonded with?”
Harry watches as the man closes his eyes and falls silent. With a gasp, Harry sits up straight in his chair startling the man. “It’s here. Your soul or what’s left of it! It’s here at the school!” Harry stands and starts pacing. Marvolo watches him with confused amber eyes. “I feel so stupid! Mother visited my defense professor secretly a few nights ago. I wasn’t sure why, but the man always gave me the oddest feeling like he was a sickening sort of person with half of my blood if that makes sense. I think what’s left of your soul had taken up residence in my defense professor.”
Harry jumps in shock as a beautiful and massive emerald green snake moves across the room from one of the passageways. Harion immediately recognizes it as a basilisk from its shrouded yellow gaze. He’d heard many stories about the king of serpents once his mother found out about his parseltongue abilities. For a time she’d even called him her little basilisk because he would one day be a powerful lord just as the basilisk lorded over all other snakes.
His mother kneels down and cups his rounded cheeks lovingly. He’d seen the woman mad and angry before but never at him. She’d given him more love in the six years he’d been with her than he ever could have wished to have when he was five years old. He’d only spent four years with that whale of a man and his equally as large son and skinny twig of a wife. Somehow the memories still happened to wake him up late at night. Still even with a family of just the two of them and people sneering at his mother when they walked down the street calling her a multitude of names, he could not have been happier than he was with his mother.
Taking a deep breath Severus whirls toward the floo and tosses in powder stepping through before he can second guess himself. The room lights in green but dies down quickly once he steps in and after a few moments Bellatrix steps into the floo room. Her long black hair hangs in loose tangles down her face and she’s only wearing the normal dress that she wears under her robes. Like this, Severus often thinks she looks much younger than she normally does. He and Bellatrix had never spent much time together. During the war, he found her a tad too insane and mentally unstable. After the war, he had pushed everyone and everything away until the night they had found Harry. He’d been torn when Lucius had called him to come through the floo and petrified they would somehow hurt the little boy. As much as he hated James Potter for stealing his Lily away he would never want to see the only part of Lily left in the world come to harm. When he’d arrived and seen the positively minuscule child wrapped up protectively in Bellatrix’s arms he’d been stunned speechless.
“James Potter is very much dead, sir.” Harion proceeds to pull the piece of parchment out of his textbook and then put his textbook back into his bag. “Though we share blood through adoptive measures…it would appear he is not the wizard who sired me.” There is silence for a long moment as the boy thinks over his next words carefully and decides brevity is likely the best solution. “You are, sir.”
“So bratty.” Marvolo chuckles. “Though I was created and portioned off from my soul at seventeen, might I correct you, I’ve had lifetimes to scour every book and writing left in these chambers. Salazar and our ancestors were brilliant beings who left journals and studies and writings behind here our familial space. Though I am perhaps twenty or so now, I have read of great loss and great loves. I was understandably relieved that I experienced some great love in my life post splitting my soul when your mother searched me out. Though to know that I had not succeeded in making my child’s life any better than my own pains me. Those pains have only grown now in knowing that even my grandchild has suffered a similar fate to my own.”
“But you have importance to many people past your name.” Marvolo reaches out to run a hand through Harion’s black hair. “Your mother surely loved you dearly. Your bonding mate does as well I would assume. Now is the age that many begin to feel inklings of love for their bond mates. I am sure that Severus will also come around. Though this version of myself had yet to meet him, your mother spoke highly of him when she did join me down here. Perhaps he is merely shocked by the knowledge that you belong to him. He was under the understanding that you were born of his one true love being unfaithful to him. My Lillian only ever had one great love and it was likely the same for Severus. To believe that great love to betray you in such a primal way was most assuredly agonizing for him. To find that what he believed was wrong and that you are in fact an embodiment of their great love left in her death will take him some time, little one.”
Snape raises an eyebrow at Draco before a sneer falls across his face. Harry watches as Snape places his Slytherin mask on perfectly before turning his obsidian glare on the prefects near the front. “Prefects ensure that all the students make it safely to the dungeons and lock the portraits behind you properly! Do not open the portrait for any reason until you get word from me! Am I understood?” Snape does not stand around long enough to catch an answer as he whirls away in a swirl of heavy black robes.
“Shame, the twins would have so much potential in the snake pit.” Theo murmurs in agreement with Flint. The older boy grins tightly at the first-year and shakes his head once more. Theo shrugs and turns toward the others in his year with a question brewing in his eyes. It only meant one thing, the muggleborn Gryffindor girl he laid eyes on had done something again. “Has anyone seen Granger recently? I heard the red-headed menace sent her crying from a class today and no one has seen her since.”
The room was quaint. There was a desk against the far wall with two large burgundy colored leather chairs sitting in front of it. A set of parchments are stacked off to one side. There are bookshelves covering most of the other walls of the room with a variety of objects, books, and parchment. There were some objects like a mortar and pistil off to one side of the desk and a ritual blade beside it. The room smelled like parchments and something older, magical. Harry felt comfortable here. They take seats in the large leather chair as the goblin takes his seat behind the desk. It’s quite for a long moment and the Goblin gathers his things.
Several group of people shuffle around from platform to platform trying to find their trains while he stands quietly alongside his mother staring up at the platform. “Now, you’ve got everything right? We haven’t forgotten anything at the house?” His mother goes through her list thoughtfully one more time because they both knew she could be a bit forgetful.
“That it is, little one. If you write in it, we can converse. However, be warned, should it fall into the hands of someone who does not retain my direct lineage, they will die a most painful death.” Harion nods sharply and presses the book into his chest protectively. “Only you should be able to feel the magic coming from it. Everyone else should see nothing more than a blank journal. There is another one, I believe, housed in the school. I often get a small feeling of it being here, but it is hidden away somewhere far from this chamber. I’d say near the highest floors and hidden by a great deal of magic.”
“Then how is it that you came to be a child of the Black family?” Marvolo tucks a hand under his chin and turns his head back and forth observing his features. “It is no glamor that hides your features, yet you look like a Black. Your blood sings with Potter, Prince, and Gaunt magic but there is something in your core of magic that screams Black. How?”
Draco at first glance still looks furious and he opens his mouth to say something until his eyes really look at his best friend and betrothed. Harion looks five seconds from breaking down. There is a hailstorm of emotions behind his stormy eyes and his magic is wrapped around him in a tight cocoon. Draco stands and the others move to stop him thinking he was prepared to fight with his best friend. Instead, Draco grips Harion by the elbow and guides him toward their dorms. All of the first year’s eyes follow after Draco and Harion.
Marvolo removes a beautifully bound green leather book form a nearby shelf. It pulses with warm chocolatey magic that Harry instantly connects to his grandfather. “That’s the horcrux isn’t it?” Marvolo nods and presses it into Harion’s hands. The book is warm and soothing.
The more Harion looked the more the man seemed to waver before flickering translucent. He was not a ghost. His magic was much too powerful to be that of a ghost but also not entirely human either. This vision of a man was something in between the two. “You’re not living, are you?” The man tilts his head as if sizing Harion up for a long moment before dropping his hand from Harion’s cheek. The cool brush of his fingers remains, and the enticing feel of dark chocolatey magic lingers on his skin.
Severus glances down at the roll of parchment that he had never gotten the chance to hand back to the tiny dark-haired boy. He has unrolled it many times since it had come into his possession. Again and again, he traced the many lines of the little boy’s family until he found his name connected undeniably with the tiny boy’s as well as his beautiful Lily. Each class he’s taken a moment to try and find another feature on the boy that was shared between the two of them. It was in the slight tilt of his wide green eyes and the subtle curve of his lips. He had the slight point to his left ear that almost every member of the Prince family inherited.
