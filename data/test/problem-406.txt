“Okay class, for the next assignment. I will put you guys in pair” Professor Slughorn said and explained more about the subject, which Draco didn’t paid attention to. The clamor could be heard in the classroom, but Draco only looked to his side, to an empty chair. Surely he will be alone again like usual. No one wants to be with him, a death eater, he thought bitterly. He decided to not give a thought about the pairing, it was useless anyway, he proceed to clean and scrub the blood from his shirt, book and the table.
Later at the evening,
Ron approached him from behind “Well, he is a git” He said while patted Harry’s back.
Which Harry did, he didn’t mind about that, because that was what he’s been doing lately since the war ended and the school started this year. He’s been following Malfoy with his eyes, he didn’t quite understand why though. Harry opened his palm and felt the sticky blood lingering there even when he washed it since this morning.
Harry noticed Draco would bolt again from the class and he grabbed Draco's wrist in reflect. Draco looked at him in surprise, “errm...sorry..” he loosened his hold “I need to talk Malfoy” Harry said. Draco blinked and yanked his hand, wanting to get out of the room. But this time Potter held him still and tightened his grip. He winced and Harry noticed it, “Please” Harry said again. Draco raised his eye brows seemed surprised at his action, before he yanked his hand back for the second time, Harry shook his head and tugged his hand outside.
“Che” he retorted, too tired to argue.
“Sit” Harry said sternly and they stared at each other, harry stared hard at him without blinking. Draco once again felt too tired and sat back, scowling at him.
Harry noticed Draco’s paleness once he entered the classroom and somehow he felt relieved when Draco decided to sit with him. Now Harry could noticed the sweat in his face and the soft tremor from Draco’s hands.
Bullying was never an option for him to punish the hoodlum, well bullying can never tolerated it at all.
Fortunately for Harry, the class ended without a problem, only his mood hadn’t improved since Draco ignoring him this morning. He took one last glance at Draco and noticed he was more miserable than this morning. He itched to ask about this but he remembered the cold shoulders, he scrunched his nose, meh.... he didn’t want to waste his time concern about this git.
They all heard about the bullying rumor that happen to Draco and several ex-death eater Slytherins. It was not like Harry would let it go if it did happen in front of his eyes, but so far none have a proof or saw it happen to any of them.
“But...” before Harry continued his question he suddenly stood up and strode outside leaving Harry behind.
******
“We are assign for this together Malfoy, I hope you don’t slack around” Potter said without looking at him. Draco thought he must be hate him so much, well I hate you as well. “Fuck off Potter” Draco gritted back
“Sorry” Harry said looking apologetic.
“You think someone hurt him physically?” She continued  “You know sometimes if the victims kept quite about the abuse, then the bullied will do more and probably that’s what happen to him.” Hermione said again.
“I will talk to him, I have an assignment with him you know. Prof. Slughorn.” Harry said to them. Well the war was over, it was not a good thing to muddled with the old rivalry. They all grown up now.
He didn’t aware for how long he focused on the scrubbing, until someone sat next to him, on that empty chair. Draco looked up and noticed it was Potter, “what??” he said unconsciously. Harry looked at Draco without blinking and turned ahead, completely ignoring him. “Git” Draco said in silent, ‘what is he doing here?’ he asked to himself and sat straight, ignoring Potter back.
Harry frowned, he didn’t held Draco’s hand strong enough to make him hissed like that, did he? Potter only saw his back retreated from the GreatHall.
Draco glared back at him but said nothing, he was not in the mood for any argument this time. They continued their lesson and once it ended Draco bolted right away from his chair and go to his room as soon as possible, leaving Potter there. The cuts still sting on his wrist.
He stopped and turned his head a little, before he walked out “Stop asking and stop following me!”
Draco ignored him and stared ahead, ‘served you right for ignoring me yesterday ‘He thought, smiling a little to his achievement.
Harry smiled and continued his doing. “Weird” Draco said to him, wanting to get him irritated.
Hermione shushed and nudged Ron, saying ‘would you stop?’ silently to him.
“ You think he tried to......to.....kill himself Harry?” Hermione winced at her words.
He doesn’t remember exactly how and when someone put the curse on him , but he noticed since three months ago and now seems like the culprit already achieved the goal, considering the words craved into his wrist just like a tattoo, not to mention the nightmares that haunted him every night, took his only peaceful time in his life.
Harry grabbed his wrist and started to unbutton Draco's sleeve. “This is ridiculous!” He almost screamed and stood from his seat.
Draco skipped his breakfast and almost too late for his class. When he arrived for Prof. Slughorn’s Class he glanced at his usual table and found Harry Potter was already there. Draco hesitated for a while but his headache and his body couldn’t stand any longer, he need to sat down right now.
Harry snorted and felt his palm was sticky, he glanced down and noticed there was blood there.
“Yeah I believe that’s good rather than stared at him form afar and doing nothing right mate? “ Ron said again.
“Malfoy!” Potter looked more irritated now.
After a few hours of swooshing around I stated to get bored and decided to head back to the castle. I kept my fingers crossed that I wouldn’t run into Draco. I really didn’t feel like seeing him or talking to him. I would have to eventually, but it could wait a couple of days. Or so I thought.
I hope you enjoy the story so far~
“He hasn’t made a single attempt at approaching me for a week! I thought he loved me. Or was that all a lie to make me less angry at him?!” I blurted out when I was sitting in the common room along with Ron and Hermione at the end of the week. From the corner of my eye, I could see Ron and Hermione exchange worried looks. “Look mate, Malfoy is probably just trying to give you some space to cool off after your last encounter. I’m sure He will be back at trying to apologize soon.” Ron said, his voice sounded a little nervous. Hermione nodded her head. “I’m positive Ron is right, just give it a few more days maybe?” She added, she sounded nervous as well. “Honestly, guys, you don’t have to keep treating me like I’m a fragile piece of porcelain. I’m fine.” I said with a sigh when I noticed their worried looks. “If it really bothers you that much, why don’t you talk to him? Be the bigger person Harry, I know you’re still angry at him, but deep down you still love him. If you didn’t, Draco not talking to you wouldn’t bother you this much.” Hermione added carefully. Her voice indicated that she was a bit nervous about how I would react. I sighed heavily. I knew she was right. I still loved Draco, even though he had treated me terribly, I just wasn’t ready to admit it yet. I stood up and started walking towards the portrait hole. “Where are you going mate?” Ron asked confused when he saw me get up and leave. “I have made up my mind. If Draco won’t come to me, I will go to him. I have an itch that only Draco knows how to scratch.” I replied and left the common room. I could hear Ron’s and Hermione’s confused voices behind me after the portrait had swung back in place, but I didn’t care. All I cared about was finding Draco, and I knew just where to look for him.
Please leave a kudos and/or a comment if you want me to continue the story
rape you.” I could feel my patience slowly slipping but I had promised myself that I wouldn’t lose my temper. I took a deep breath to calm myself down before continuing. “I don’t expect you to be okay with any of this. Quite the opposite, you can be angry with me all you like. But we both know deep down that you and I are made for each other. Our bond confirms that whether you like it or not.” I paused for a few seconds to observe Harry. He still looked angry, but he had stopped shaking and had now wrapped himself in the covers to keep himself warm. After a few seconds I spoke again. “I completely understand if you don’t want to be around me anymore when you’re not in heat. I won’t bother you anymore-“ I turned my head away from Harry so he wouldn’t see the tears in my eyes and got up from the bed to find my clothes. I quickly found my clothes and got dressed, keeping my back turned towards Harry to hide the tears. The fact that this hurt me so much meant that I really loved Harry, but I wasn’t so sure it was mutual anymore. I had to get out of there before I was no longer able to hold back the tears. “I know you probably hate me. But my feelings for you haven’t changed. I love you, Harry.” I said as I left the cell.

Draco came back to the bed with the widest smirk I had ever seen on his face. He crawled onto bed down from the foot end and stopped with one knee between my legs, gently pressing it against my crotch. I felt myself starting to harden and tried to muffle a soft moan. I wasn’t sure how it was possible, but the smirk on Draco’s lips grew bigger and he bent over me. He started placing tender kisses and soft bites on my neck. He firmly grabbed my chin and tilted my head to face the opposite direction. “I’m so fucking turned on Potter. I’m going to make you scream, do you understand? I want you to scream my name.” He breathed into my neck. His voice sent shivers down my spine and I nodded. Draco then pulled away from my neck and added a bit more pressure with his knee. I moaned softly and squirmed slightly. Draco looked me up and down before practically ripping my boxers off. I groaned slightly as the hem of my boxers brushed against my hardened cock. Draco was getting hard too, I tried reaching down to touch him but then I remembered that my hands were tied up. I whimpered slightly which Draco found highly amusing. “You’re being punished remember?” he said and slowly started kissing his way down my stomach, all the way down to my cock. I instinctively arched my hips upwards, trying to get closer to Draco’s soft lips against my skin. Draco grinned at me and gave my cock a slow lick all the way from base to top. I moaned loudly and felt my cock throb slightly. He firmly grabbed hold of my cock and started stroking it. I let my head fall back onto the pillow and gave in to the pleasure. And oh Merlin, waves of please rolled over me. Next thing I know is the felling of a finger slowly being pushed inside of me. “Ah- D-Draco-“ I moaned and rolled my hips against his finger. Draco smirked up at me and started moving his finger faster and deeper. Draco was being a lot rougher this time, but it felt good. I don’t know if it was because my hands were tied up or if it was the thought of being punished, but it felt like I was burning up with desire. “Fuck me Draco- I want you to fuck me like there is no tomorrow-“ I begged but Draco just shook his head and smirked at me again. “Not yet, the punishment isn’t over.” He said and teasingly slowed his finger down pulling almost all the way out before slowly pushing it back in. I moaned loudly and curled my toes. I had completely forgotten that the other Slytherin students in the common room could hear me. Draco grabbed hold of my hard cock with his free hand and started stroking it counterpart to his finger’s movement. I was a desperate moaning mess at this point and all I could think about was how badly I wanted to feel Draco inside of me. “Oh Merlin- Please Draco- I can’t take it anymore- Would you please just fuck me already?!” I desperately cried out and heard Draco make a strange noise. It sounded like a mix between a laugh and a moan. Draco pulled his finger out and let go of my cock before lifting my legs onto his shoulders and bent over me. “I like it when you beg Potter. Keep it up and I might just give you what you want.” he whispered into my ear and it sent shivers down my spine. “Please Draco- I want you to fuck me. I want to feel you inside of me. I want- Ah!” Draco teasingly nudged his cock against my hole. “Is this what you want Potter?” He teased. “Yes! I want you cock Draco- Please fuck me-“ I heard Draco groan before he harshly thrust himself inside of me. A brief wave of pain shot through me before the pleasure took over and I moaned loudly. “Ah! Y-yes. Right there-“ Draco and I were both panting heavily and Draco kept thrusting into me in deep and controlled movements. My whole body was trembling with pleasure each time Draco hit my sweet spot. I tried lifting my head up for a kiss, but the position Draco had my laying in made it extremely difficult. Draco made an extra hard thrust and I threw my head back into the pillow screaming Draco’s name in the wave of please it sent through me. Draco made a low growling sound. “Fuck- I’m going to come Potter-“ Draco panted. I could feel my own climax closing in as well. “M-me too-“ Draco groaned and made sure to hit my sweet spot with his last few thrusts before he came. “Ah- Fuck-“ He panted out and kept thrusting into me, still hitting my sweet spot with each thrust, until I came as well. “Fuck- Draco I’m coming!” I cried out and my whole body trembled as I came.
The excitement didn’t last long though, all of a sudden Draco stood up, pressed a hand against my mouth and whispered “Shh. Madam Norris is coming, don’t move..” Draco practically pressed himself as close to me as he possibly could while we waited for Madam Norris to pass by the study room.

I had no idea how long I had been gone or what time it was when I finally snuck back into the common room, but luckily Ron and Hermione had gone to bed. I sighed in relief and went to bed. I silently crawled into my bed and pulled the cover up above my head. I sincerely hoped that Draco had had a better night than me. I tossed and turned and couldn’t sleep. Ron’s words were running on repeat in my head and they hurt more and more each time.

Thank you for reading chapter I of The Lion and the Snake!
All I could do was watch as Harry got more and more angry. He kept shouting despite the fact that I tried to shush him so we wouldn’t get caught, that only seemed to make ham even angrier. “Harry- Please keep your voice down- Someone might hear you-“ I tried but Harry quickly cut me off and snapped back “I will not keep my voice down just because it makes you uncomfortable-“ He trailed off and looked at me. I think he realized that his words had hurt me because he fell quiet after that and quickly turned away before walking out the door. But the words he said right before leaving were the words that hurt the most. “I can’t do this anymore Draco- I’m done.” And then he was gone. I heard running in the hallway, so I followed and tried to shout at him to wait, but he didn’t seem to care at all, he just kept running. And just like that I was alone in the big hallway. I decided to go back to clean the study room before going to bed. I felt something that I had never thought I would ever feel over anyone and especially not Potter. I felt hurt and betrayed Tears were slowly running down my cheeks and before I knew it, I was sitting on my knees, sobbing into one of the pillows. ‘No- This is stupid. Why the hell am I crying over Potter?’ I thought to myself and wiped the tears off my face before quickly emptying the room and went straight to bed afterwards.
I spend the following week trying to avoid Draco at all costs. I didn’t want to have to face him. I was still mad at him for the way he had treated me. The bruises and bitemarks started to fade away after a few days, but my body still felt incredibly sore.
Avoiding Draco turned out to be far easier than I had imagined it would be. I only saw him during mealtime and when he entered or left class. Not even once did he try to approach me, which I honestly found a bit odd. I had kind of expected him to go out of his way to constantly apologize to me or be all over me like a lost puppy, but he did neither of those things. In fact, he didn’t even look at me. I wanted him to stay away from me, but at the same time I wanted him to at least try to make it up me somehow.
, the pureblood bastard that hates our guts?” I kept my head down, eyes practically glued to floor. I was afraid to meet their eyes. This was not the way I had planned for them to find out. I didn’t know what to say, so I just shrugged nervously, carefully placing my left arm across my chest while slowly stroking my hand up and down my right arm. I heard footsteps coming towards me and I braced myself for whatever I thought was going. I flinched slightly as I was the pair of shoes in front of me.  I don’t know what I was expecting, but a hug was not one of the things on that list. “Oh Harry, why didn’t you just tell us?” Hermione asked softly and squeezed me tightly. I slowly looked up, kind of expecting that Ron was on his way to hug me as well, but when I met his eyes my heart sunk in my chest. He looked at me like I had just insulted his entire family all at once. “Ron, I-“ I started, but Ron cut me off and held up a hand. “Spare me. I don’t want to hear it.” He said and shook his head. Tears welled up in my eyes and I pushed myself out of Hermione’s grip. I reached out a hand to offer peace, hoping Ron would take it and just let me explain everything. “Ron, please- Let me explain-“ Ron’s eyes practically glowed with disgust and anger at this point, so I made sure to keep my distance. “Why would I listen to
The day went by a lot smoother than yesterday had. But what awaited me when I got back to the common room after dinner was
“I love you, Harry.”
The fight with Harry from last night kept playing on repeat in my head and each time I came up with a new way that I could have stopped Harry from leaving. ‘If only I had been honest about how I feel-‘ I kept thinking to myself and sighed silently. ‘Maybe if I take a nap? -‘ I closed my eyes and slowly drifted off. It wasn’t a very pleasant nap though, images of last night and the way Harry had looked at me, puffy and teary eyes. It was devastating to re-watch the fight, and I don’t know how I didn’t notice how much my words had hurt Harry last night, but I could see it crystal clear now. I must have been mumbling in my sleep because suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder, shaking me gently. “Draco, are you okay? You seem pretty stressed out about something.”  I slowly opened my eyes only to find Pansy directly in front of my face. I gasped in surprise and tried to move away only to realize that I had somehow curled myself up in the corner closest to the window, so there was nowhere to move way to. I groaned in frustration and shoved Pansy out of my face. “have neither of you heard about the term ‘personal space’ before?” I asked annoyed and looked between the three of them, arms crossed over my chest. “Sure, I have,” Pansy grinned and continued, “I just choose not to follow it.” I rolled my eyes at her and sighed in relief as a familiar building appeared further ahead.
Hey guys!
Harry gave me an amazing blowjob, but he still didn’t seem satisfied. He had tasted blood and wanted more. Harry was practically squirming on spot, considering his next move. After a few seconds it seemed like Harry had made up his mind and he straddled my waist again. He bent over me and leaned down to my ear. “I want you so badly Draco.” He whispered and his voice sent shivers down my spine. Harry must have noticed, because he gave my earlobe a small bite before continuing. “I want you inside of me, but this time we’re going to do it my way, got it?” he asked and all I could do was nod. Harry then pulled away and positioned himself before pulling his boxers off to reveal his throbbing hard cock. I bit down on my lower lip and eyed Harry up and down. ‘Why is he so damn hot? How does he do this to me?’ I thought to myself. I gasped slightly in surprise when Harry gently grabbed my cock to position it the way he wanted it before slowly lowering himself onto it. Harry and I both exhaled in pleasure. Harry winced silently as he took all of me inside of him. He stayed still for a few seconds to adjust himself to the feeling before he slowly started rolling his hips while sliding up and down. We were both panting and moaning, but Harry controlled the pace and how hard he wanted it. I reached out to gently grab Harry’s hips and let my hands rest on them while Harry continued to move his hips. I could feel Harry a whole new way now, it felt like he was grabbing me tighter somehow. Harry was feeling it too, his entire body was shivering in pleasure as he kept sliding up and down. I could feel my climax closing in and instinctively tightened my grip on Harry’s hips, but he didn’t seem to mind. His moans were getting louder, and judging from that I would assume that his climax was closing in as well. We moaned out each other’s names as we came together and Harry collapsed on top of me, panting into my chest. “Fuck Draco. That was amazing-“ he muttered and slowly lifted his head to look at me. I looked back at him and smiled. “Yeah, it was. You definitely know how to give a proper blowjob, that’s for sure.” I grinned and waited for Harry to pull away from my cock before pulling him down next to me. We cuddled up under the covers in Harry’s bed and I stroked his hair as he fell asleep in my arms. “I love you Harry-“ I whispered silently to myself as I watched Harry sleep safe and soundly.
I had promised myself that I would never allow myself to become the helpless mess I had been during my heat but thinking back, made me realize that maybe it hadn’t been as bad as I had thought it out to be in the first place, maybe I had even been exaggerating a bit. That being said, I was still pissed at Draco for the way he had been acting the days leading up to it all, but I was slowly starting to understand that he never meant to hurt me. His hormones were going crazy because of his upcoming rut, and so were mine because of my upcoming heat.
I clearly remember the first time I ever laid my eyes upon Draco. It was back at our first year at Hogwarts, and I remember thinking to myself ‘I don’t like this guy. He is vicious, spiteful, and mean. He treats others horribly if they don’t agree with him. He’s just straight up an asshole.” We had our ups and downs through our first years at Hogwarts, but as time passed, I slowly started to catch feelings for Draco, feelings that I didn’t know how to deal with. I think it was in our fourth year that I started to notice my feelings towards him change. They changed from anger, hatred and despise to butterflies in my stomach every time I looked at him or he looked at me. I tried talking to Ron and Hermione about it, but they were either too busy to listen or they just didn’t understand why it was such a big deal. I decided to push my feelings aside for the time being, but I knew that I would have to face them eventually, and I wasn’t exactly looking forward to it.
I received mixed reactions on my last chapter, and I appreciate the honesty you guys gave me. I have been struggling with this chapter, I really wanted to get it right, until I thought 'Screw it. This is my story, and I will write it how I like it.'
I woke up the next morning to Crabbe and Goyle standing on either side of my bed, just staring at me. I quickly sat up and glared at them. “What is it?” I snarled and yawned. They looked carefully at each other before Crabbe spoke. “We are just worried about you, that’s all.” He said and Goyle nodded in agreement. “Yeah, you don’t seem to be sleeping very well lately.” He added. I sighed and slowly ran a hand through my hair before getting out of bed. “Well- I guess I just have a lot on my mind lately-“ I said and completely ignored them for the rest of the morning. I was happy to be leaving the school when it was finally time. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could, not that I was excited to go home, but I just needed to get away. The train ride back to London felt like it took days instead of hours. Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle kept talking about all these unimportant things the entire way back. It was starting to get on my nerves because all I wanted to do was shout at them to shut up. I wanted to tell them what was going on, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. So, I just pretended to listen and occasionally smiled or nodded whenever it fit into their conversation.
I started talking a great deal more to Pansy during that week compared to how much I usually talked to her. I even started confiding in her about how hurt I was. At first, she told me to be a man about it and stop whining, but as the week progressed it became more apparent to her that I was being serious.
I hope you enjoy the story so far~
I had no idea how long it took me to finally fall asleep, but when I woke up the next day, I felt even worse than I did before I went to bed the night before. My body was hot, and I felt feverish, my heart was pounding in my chest and I could hear the blood rushing by in my ears. The musky scent from my cover seemed stronger and I had trouble thinking straight. It was a huge struggle to get dressed, but I managed. I still wasn’t hungry, so I decided to skip breakfast. McGonagall had told me to come straight to her if I noticed any changes with my body, but I decided to just wait it out. Only problem was that it didn’t seem to go away, it only got worse. I barely made it down to the Great Hall and getting to potions class seemed like an unbearable task right now. When I finally made it to the classroom the class had already begun. I hurried in and took a seat in the back, hoping no one would notice that I was late. I squirmed uncomfortably in my seat, the air was hot, and it felt sticky. No, it wasn’t the air, it was me. I was sticky and I was hard. I had gotten hard in class in front of my classmates. My face turned tomato red and I felt like all eyes were on me even though no one was looking at me. My heart was still pounding, and the feverish feeling became worse by the minute. When people finally got up to gather ingredients for today’s potion Hermione came down to me with a worried expression on her face. “Harry you don’t look so good. Are you okay?” She asked and gently placed a hand on my arm. The feeling of another person touching me made my entire body jolt and a small moan escaped my lips. My knees felt like jelly and I didn’t know whether I wanted to run away screaming or give in to the incredible feeling of getting touched. Hermione quickly removed her hand from my arm and stared at me as I whimpered softly at the loss of her touch. If I felt like everyone’s eyes were on me before, they were now. Many of them just looked surprised, but some of them looked hungry, like they were undressing me right here and now. Among the hungry I saw a familiar pair of grey eyes. I scrambled out of my chair and tried to exit the room, but I was stopped by a firm grip on my wrist. “Please- Leave me alone-“ I whimpered and tried to pull my wrist out of the grip, but I was too weak. I was pulled back and next thing I knew was a pair of strong arms around me. I could feel breathing against my neck and a hand moving towards my crotch which made me shiver. “You smell delicious. Can I have a taste?” A voice whispered into my ear. “That’s enough Mr. McMillan. I suggest you find your seat before I drag your ass to detention.” A familiar voice sounded across the room and the pair of strong arms around me disappeared. I didn’t dare to look up and suddenly I was being manhandled out of the classroom. “Please don’t hurt me-“ I whispered. “You stupid boy. What were you thinking?! You could’ve started a heat frenzy in there.” Snape’s voice sounded so far away, yet so close. I looked up and saw Snape dragging me up the stairs. I didn’t feel the same feeling when Snape touched me, Snape’s touch felt safe and warm. He dragged me to the hospital wing and demanded to speak to Madam Pomfrey at once. “I need your quarantine cell Madam Pomfrey. This boy is in heat.” Their conversation went straight over my head after that and before I knew it, I had been placed in a magically sealed cell. I sat quietly on the bed, not knowing what to do. When I was finally alone, I pulled off my pants. They were sticky with a weird substance I had never seen before. The sweet smell hit me instantly. It was almost sickeningly sweet. I couldn’t take it anymore. I pulled my boxers off as well and they were even more sticky than my pants. I could feel the sticky fluid run down my thighs and my cock made a hard throb. I moaned softly and started touching myself. But even that wasn’t enough to easy the burning. I needed something more. I needed to be filled. Just the thought was enough to make my cock throb again and I let out a whimper. Where was Draco when I needed him? No, he was the last person I wanted to see me like this. I collapsed on the bed and enjoyed the feeling of the cold sheets against my burning skin. “Harry my boy. Can you hear me?” A familiar voice sounded, and I jolted up from the bed, looking around to locate where the voice had come from. I noticed some sort of window in one of the walls and on the other side stood none other than Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall. I hid my face in my hands and quickly crossed my legs. I nodded my head weakly. How long had they been standing there? “It’s alright Harry, you have nothing to be ashamed of. This is natural.” Dumbledore said calmly and I could see a small smile on his lips. McGonagall was standing behind him still as a statue. “Harry, I know this a touchy subject, especially at your age, but in order to help you I need to know your sexual preference. Do you understand?” I weakly nodded my head again before answering. “Men- I prefer men.“ I muttered quietly. I saw Dumbledore nod to McGonagall, and she disappeared. It didn’t take long for her to return and with her she had none other than Draco. My heart sank in my chest and I looked away, too ashamed of myself to even look at any of them. The door to the cell opened and Draco was shoved inside.
But I am back with Chapter IV and hope to release Chapter V within the next week or so, give and take a few days maybe
Harry pushed me onto his bed and straddled my waist before leaning closer. “You have no idea how badly I want you Draco- It’s been making me crazy.” He breathed into my ear and gave my earlobe a soft nibble. Harry started placing tender bites and kisses all over my neck on both sites. I shivered slightly and exhaled slowly to get my breathing under control. The last thing I wanted was to show Harry how much power he could have over me. I would be lying if I said that I hadn’t missed seeing him, feeling his hands on me or even hearing his voice. I had ended up punishing us both with my little game. I groaned silently as I felt myself starting to harden. I could feel a smirk forming on Harry’s lips against my neck. “enjoying ourselves, are we?” I asked and let my hands caress Harry’s sides gently. Harry didn’t answer but instead started fiddling with my shirt underneath the robe. He groaned in frustration when it didn’t cooperate with him at all. “Take them off.” He muttered. I tilted my head and looked confused at him. “What?” Harry sighed and rolled his eyes at me. “Your robe and your shirt. Take. Them. Off.” He repeated and pulled back to give me some working space. I wiggled my eyebrows and smirked. “Oh? Would you like me to put on a show like the one you did for me?” I asked and slowly licked my lips. Harry shook his head and looked firmly at me. “Just shut up and take them off.” He said. Harry was getting impatient, but I still hadn’t figured out what he was up to. I took off my robe and shirt before looking over at Harry. “There, are you happy now?” Harry didn’t answer, instead he pushed me onto my back and unbuttoned my pants without any problems. The then proceeded to pull them off completely. He bit his lip when he noticed that I was already hard.
I wandered the castle for what felt like hours until my feet started hurting and my stomach growled loudly to inform me that I should probably get some food soon. I looked at the giant clock in the clocktower. “Almost diner time-“ I mumbled and decided to head towards The Great hall, by the time I got there it would be time for dinner.
“ Signed DM.
“I love you too.”
happen then?” I asked and referred to Harry’s black eye. I noticed Harry’s eyes were nervously flickering, avoiding eye contact with me. “Well, Hermione and Ron were fighting when I get back to the common room after dinner and I asked what they were fighting about. Ron got angry and asked if I only wanted to know so I could run back to you to gossip or something-“ Harry trailed off. “Yeah, go on.” I said impatiently. Harry cleared his throat before he continued. “Then Hermione got angry and told Ron off before throwing her book at him in anger. Ron then lunched himself at her preparing to slap her. So I stepped in between them and Ron’s hand hit me instead of Hermione. I couldn’t let him hit her Draco, that wouldn’t have been right-” I raised an eyebrow at him, and he immediately continued, almost panicking. “Please don’t hurt him! He didn’t mean to hit me and he certainly didn’t intend to give me a black eye-“ I tightened my grip on Harry’s chin slightly, which made him yelp. “No one hurts you and gets away with it. Do you understand that Potter?
Later that afternoon Draco walked me to Umbridge’s office and gave me a soft kiss on the forehead. “I’ll see you later. Try not to piss her further off.” He said right before leaving. I took a deep breath and knocked softly on the door in front of me. Umbridge’s voice sent shivers down my spine when she answered my knock. I took another deep breath and entered her office. She greeted med with her overly enthusiastic smile and high-pitched voice. “Harry my boy! Here, take a seat.” She gestured towards a one-person desk and chair in front of her own desk. There was a piece of blank paper on the table, so naturally I assumed that she would have me write sentences, so I sat down at the chair.  I noticed that there was no quill on the desk and reached into my backpack to get my own. Umbridge stopped me before I could take out my own quill. “Oh no deer, today you will be using a very special quill. And you won’t need ink.” She said and handed me a quill that I had never seen before. “Okay- What would you like me to write then?” I asked confused. She thought for a moment before answering. “I want you to write ‘I must not tell lies’.” Still confused I started writing on the paper and to my surprise the quill started writing even though I hadn’t dipped the tip in any sort of ink. After finishing the sentence there was a sharp shot of pain on the back of my hand. I noticed that the words “I must not tell lies” started to take form on my hand. It stung and I had to grit my teeth. “And how many times would you like me to write this?” I asked. A nasty grin spread on Umbridge’s face as she answered. “As many times as, it takes for the message to sink in.”

I decided to take a walk around school grounds to get some fresh air. It was a bright and sunny day and the birds were happily chirping all around me. I couldn’t help but smile a little, they just seemed so happy and free. It made me realize how much I missed flying. Flying was the only time I felt free, so I decided to walk down to the quidditch pitch and grab my broomstick. Once I had gotten it out of the shed, I mounted my broom and kicked off the ground. I could feel the warm summer breeze on my skin, and it felt amazing. I stayed still in the air for a few minutes, just enjoying the feeling of being on y broom again. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, inhaling the fresh air. After repeating this a few times, I opened my eyes again and decided to race around the quidditch pitch. I swooshed in and out between the goalposts and I felt more alive on my broomstick swooshing through the air, than I had for the past few months. Sure, it was great being with Draco and all, but I needed to just get away from it all.
I never really noticed how tense I had been the last few days of the summer holiday before I was sitting in the train on the way back to Hogwarts and I could finally relax. My neck and shoulders were awfully sore. I tried rubbing my neck to relieve some of the pain, but it didn’t seem to work. Pansy noticed and offered to give me a quick massage. I was skeptical at first but ended up agreeing in the end when the pain wouldn’t go away no matter what I did. “There, isn’t that way better?” Pansy asked when she was done. “Yeah, thanks Pansy.” I mumbled and looked out the window. We all sat in silence for quite some time before Crabbe broke it. “So, how was your summer Draco?” He asked and sounded genuinely curious. I thought about my answer for a bit. “Oh, you know- Trying to live up to my father’s expectations, homework. The usual.” I said but strongly considered mentioning the letter I had spent hours trying to get right. I’m not sure they bought it, but then they took turns telling me about their summer. Crabbe had been in his room most of the summer. Goyle had been helping his father with something neither of us caught because he was mumbling. Pansy had been traveling with her parents most of the summer and had seen a lot of exciting places. We all fell quiet again after that, but it didn’t bother me too much. Now I had time to plan out how I intended to win Harry back so to speak.
Thank you for reading chapter III of The Lion and the Snake!
Images and memories from the past 5 days slowly started coming back to me as I was getting ready to leave the cell Snape had brought me to at the beginning of my heat. Seeing and remembering those things again made me feel weird and squeamish. I would definitely have to take the suppressants Snape would be making for me. I didn’t want to ever become like that again. My entire body was sore, and it ached when I tried to move. As I was getting dressed, I caught sight of my reflection in the thick glass walls. I had bruises and bitemarks all over my body, some of the bitemarks even looked very recent, they were still red and swollen. I had been sore after sex with Draco before, but this was a whole new level of sore. It looked like Draco had been beating me continuously for days.
Hours passed by and I hadn’t gotten any closer to figuring out how to make it up to Harry. I let out another frustrated groan into my pillow and decided that it was probably best if I just went to sleep. I got up from the bed and walked over to my wardrobe to find my sleepwear. ‘Maybe I’ll figure something out while I sleep-‘ I thought to myself and quickly changed into my sleepwear before crawling back into bed. I pulled the cover over me and let my head sink into the pillow as I tried to get comfortable. Nothing seemed to work, and I ended up staring at the ceiling for an awfully long time before finally drifting off to a restless slumber.
angry with me?” I asked silently and watched as Hermione’s smile turned into a grimace before she nodded. “He’s being stubborn and childish if you ask me.” Hermione said, her voice had a slight tone of irritation to it.
I'm finally back with a new chapter~
rape you, okay?! You wanted this just as badly as I did if not more! Stop accusing me of something I didn’t do!” I snarled at him, which instantly made Harry shut his mouth. He shamefully hung his head and mumbled an apology.
Over the next couple of days Harry kept sending me notes asking me to meet him various places. I kept politely turning him down. I wanted him to work for it this time, and he certainly did. After about a week I decided to give in and agreed to meet with him. I could tell from Harry’s notes that he was getting very desperate to see me, so I suggested that we skipped class and met up in the dungeons. Harry rejected the dungeon part and told me to meet me in front of the entrance to the Gryffindor common room. I was suspicious at first but agreed. Something seemed to be different about Harry.
I hope you enjoy the story so far~
I stared at the letter in front of me for a while before putting it into an envelope and writing down Harry’s name on it. I stared at it some more before I remembered that Harry usually always spent the last month of the summer holiday at the Weasley’s house, so I wrote their address down as well. I heard soft knocking on my door and my mother’s voice on the other side. “Draco, darling, are you alright? Can I come in?” She asked and I quickly hit the letter in my desk drawer before answering her. “Yeah, you come in.” I turned around in my chair so that I was facing the door when my mother entered my room. She looked worried. She sat down on my bed, folding her hands in her lap. “Draco, your father and I are very worried about you. You look pale, are you sure you’re feeling alright? You’re not sick, are you?” she asked silently. I could tell that’s not what she really wanted to talk about though. Her eyes were rested on my desk drawer where I had hidden the letter. ‘Crap. They already know!’ I looked at my mother and then it all just came rushing over me like a tide wave. All the confusion, anger, sadness. It just became too much, and I couldn’t hold it back anymore. I hid my face in my hands and started sobbing. The first sob had barely even left my throat before my mother’s arms were wrapped around me, pulling me in for a hug. She gently stroked my hair and told me everything would be okay. “You don’t understand mother-“ I started, but it wasn’t easy due to the sobbing. “I’m- I’m in love with someone, but I’m afraid they don’t feel the same way about me-“ I managed to get out between the sobs, that had now turned into literal crying. “It’s not just someone- It’s- It’s actually a he-“ I looked up at my mother, tears streaming down my face, eyes red and puffy. I immediately realized what I had just said and my eyes widened in panic. “Please don’t tell father!” I blurted out and tried to pull away from my mother’s embrace, but she just held my closer, still gently stroking my hair. “It’s okay Draco. This will be our little secret until you’re ready to tell Lucius as well.” Her words were warm and comforting and I slowly started to feel better. “Father won’t be pleased no matter how long I wait-“ I mumbled and looked away. I heard my mother chuckle softly, which made me smile. “No, I suppose you’re right.” She said and placed a kiss on my forehead. “So, why don’t you tell me about this boy that you have taken a liking to?” She asked and I immediately started rambling on and on about everything that I liked about Harry. His eyes, his smile, his laugh, everything about him.
I’ve been doing.” Draco said with a wide grin but agreed with me that he was not really feeling like having that conversation right now.
I was shoved inside the magically sealed room that prevented Harry’s scent from spreading across the entire school. The smell was sweet and intoxicating. It was hard to concentrate in there. My instincts kicked in and I staggered towards Harry. “I told you Potter. You’re the cause of all this. And now you’re in full blown heat.” I smirked and slowly moved closer to the bed where Harry was sitting. He looked fragile as he sat there not knowing what to do with himself. I slowly climbed onto the bed and inhaled his sweet scent. A deep growl escaped my lips. “I’m going to claim you Potter. And once I do that you will be mine forever. No other Alpha can touch you when you’ve become mine.” I turned towards the window. “Leave us!” I snarled and saw Dumbledore nod slowly as he gestured McGonagall to the door before, they both left. When I was sure we were alone I pushed Harry onto his back and crawled in between his legs. The entire room reeked of Harry’s scent mixed with the heavy amount of slick he had already produced. It was impossible to think straight. I looked down at him with a wide smirk. “You have no idea of how long I’ve waited for this moment Potter-“ Harry squirmed under me as if he was trying to get away from me. I growled at him and he froze. “P-please don’t- I don’t want this-“ Harry whimpered and turned his head from me to hide his face. His body was telling a different story though. “Don’t lie to me Potter. Your body is practically begging to be claimed. Your body longs for an Alpha’s touch, my touch.” Harry whimpered quietly and weakly nodded his head. I leaned down to teasingly run my tongue up Harry’s neck, which made him shiver and moan softly. “I’ll make you feel good, I promise.” I whispered into his ear and pulled away with a wide smirk. “Now then, I want you to get on all four for me.” Harry obediently turned around and got on all four in front of me. Seeing the amount of power, I had over him aroused me and I felt myself getting hard. A deep growl tore its way out of my throat. I grabbed Harry’s shirt and ripped it apart. Harry yelped in surprise but didn’t move a muscle otherwise. I tore off my pants and boxers, since I wouldn’t be needing them again anytime soon. Harry’s entire body was trembling with anticipation and his body was overflowing with hormones. It was making me go crazy, and even though I tried my best to control my instincts, I couldn’t hold it back much longer. I grabbed Harry by his hips and rammed myself deeply inside of him. He moaned loudly and collapsed on the bed in font of me. He was trembling and panting in pure pleasure. I started thrusting myself inside of Harry, using his hips to roll him against me to hit even deeper. “That’s right love take it all. Good boy.” I panted softly grabbed Harry’s hips a bit tighter, slightly digging my nails into them. Harry continued to whimper and squirm as he moaned loudly. I thrusted myself harder into Harry and bent over him, fixating my teeth around his pulse point before sinking his teeth into Harry’s skin. Harry yelped and a shutter went through his entire body. Every time Harry tried to move away from me, I just bit down harder, forcing him to submit again. Harry moaned louder with each deep thrust. “I’m going to come-“ He whimpered quietly. A smirk spread across my lips. “You can’t come until I say you can. Got it?” I growled against Harry’s pulse point, which sent another shutter through his body. He nodded obediently even though he was struggling to hold it in. I could feel my own climax coming closer as my thrusts slowed down a little to make it last longer. Harry whimpered impatiently. “Please- Let me come- I can’t hold it anymore-“ He begged and clenched his fists around the sheets. “I’m going to mark you Potter. And then I’m going to knot you.” I breathed against Harry’s pulse point and bit down hard. I felt my teeth pierce the skin, licking my lips as I tasted blood which made Harry whine. “Hurts- Please. No more-“ Right before I reached my climax, I pushed my knot inside of Harry with a deep growl. I could feel my knot expanding as I came inside of him. Harry moaned loudly as he tightened his grip around the sheets and rolled his hips against me. I let go of Harry’s neck with my teeth and leaned closer. “It’s alright love. You can come now.” I whispered into his ear. Just as I had finished my sentence Harry arched his back and came with a loud moan.
” I shouted back startling Draco and made him take a few steps back. “Why do you always push me way? Why do you keep avoiding the subject whenever I bring it up?! Have you ever stopped to consider that
(See the end of the chapter for
I dragged Draco inside the common room even though he was trying to fight back. He kept mumbling something about being behind on his homework, but I didn’t buy it. I finally got him inside the dorm and locked the doors behind us. I didn’t feel like getting interrupted in the middle of everything. I turned to face Draco, a small confident smirk spreading on my lips. “Ready for round two?” I asked seductively and pushed Draco backwards towards the bed. At first, he just followed my lead but the further we got into the foreplay, Draco started to fight back, wanting to take control again. It was clear that Draco was not used to being the one out of control. All it took for him to regain the control was a second of distraction from my side. In one swift movement Draco flipped us around and now he was on top. “You caught me off guard last time Potter. Don’t get used to it.” He smirked down at me and my body responded with shivering with anticipation, but my mind started racing. ‘
What did this make us? Was there even anything in it, or was it just me imagining things? I had so many questions that I needed answers to.
I had never really considered Pansy as someone I could confide in with things like this, but deep down she cared about me and I knew she just wanted me to be happy.
“Hm?” Draco said back as he lazily turned his head to look down at me as well. He was smiling softly, and he looked peaceful.
Also, I have been working on getting the story updated to contain Alpha/Beta/Omega dynamics and had to figure out how I could do that in the best way possible.
After a while of thrusting into me while my hips were n the air, Draco lowered them back onto the bed and let go of my hips. He stopped moving his own hips for a bit to reposition himself properly, even though it was only for a few seconds it felt like it took him forever. When he finally started moving his hips again, I let out a loud moan. Draco smirked satisfied and leaned down to my neck, his breaths against my skin made me shiver slightly. I wrapped my legs around Draco’s waist, which made Draco groan slightly. “Fuck, you’re so tight Harry. I don’t know how much longer I can hold back. I’m going to come soon.” He breathed against my neck, which sent shivers down my spine. I could feel my own climax closing in as well. “Draco I’m going to come- Please- More-“ I moaned. I could feel Draco’s lips curve into a smirk against my neck. “I’ll give you a choice. You can either reach your climax and come, or you can submit to me, without being in heat, and let me bite you.” Draco whispered into my ear and gave my earlobe a soft bite before pulling away. The movement of his hips slowed down as well. I whimpered quietly when Draco slowed down. I wanted to reach my climax and come desperately, it felt like my body was about to explode. But something inside of me told me that I should choose to submit to Draco. Memories of all the times Draco had bitten me during my heat came back, and I was surprised when I remembered that not one of them had hurt, it had felt good and I had moaned every time Draco bit me. Even though I wanted to reach my climax, I had made my decision. “I- I submit. I want you to bite me.” I replied. Draco’s eyes flashed for a second, just like they did when he entered the cell I was put in during my heat. But this time I wasn’t scared of him, it felt familiar, it felt safe. I let my guard down to fully submit to Draco and was instantly hit by a wave of pleasure, it was like I could feel everything Draco felt as well. Draco leaned back down and gently pressed his lips against the skin of my neck. He let his lips rest there for a few seconds before he opened his mouth, and I could feel his teeth grazing my neck before slowly piercing the skin. I let out a soft moan at the feeling and heard Draco moan softly against my neck as well. He started moving his hips again, still biting softly into my neck. “You made the right choice. As a reward I will let you come.” Draco mumbled against my neck as he thrusted slightly deeper into me before let my name roll off his tongue as he came inside of me. Draco’s climax sent a wave of pleasure through my body. I clenched my fists tighter around the sheets and let Draco’s name roll off my tongue in a loud moan as I came as well.
We ended up getting a bit closer during the time I spent apart from Harry. Sure, we had been friends since our first year, but this was different.
They stared at us for what felt like forever and it was starting to get extremely uncomfortable to say the least. Crabbe was the first to break the awkward silence they had created when they entered the dorm room. “Malfoy? What the hell is Potter doing in here? And why the hell are neither of you dressed properly?!” he blurted out while Goyle just stood there. I think he was just as uncomfortable with this whole situation as I was. Draco snorted and looked over at him. “Oh, I don’t know Crabbe. Maybe because we just had sex? Have you ever considered that I might be gay?” he said sarcastically, and I couldn’t help but smile slightly at the look on Crabbe’s face. This time it was Goyle who opened his mouth to speak. “Wait, hold on- So you’re saying that you and Potter are a thing now? I thought you hated his guts?” he asked confused and looked back and forth between Draco and I in the bed and Crabbe who just kept staring at us, mouth wide open and eyes wide with confusion. Draco just shrugged. “Well I obviously don’t, not anymore anyways.” He said and snaked an arm around me to pull me closer to him. My cheeks were burning with embarrassment but fighting Draco would only result in the cover sliding off, which was not on my list of things that I wanted to happen. None of this was on that list apart from being in Draco’s arms.
I read this amazing story by Becstar7 some time ago and got inspired. (I hope they don't mind that I've used their story as inspiration *-*)
I'm always open to critique, all I ask is that you respect my choices as the writer.
Thank you for reading chapter V of The Lion and the Snake!
Draco picked me up and held me tight as he carried me into the Slytherin common room. I was too busy trying to stop the tears and snot from ruining Draco’s shirt to notice where he was staking me. It only occurred to me where we were when I felt the silky sheets under me. Draco had sat down next to me on the bed. He wasn’t touching me or looking at, he just sat there. I guess he was waiting for me to say something. “Draco- I-“ I started but didn’t know how to tell him. I wanted to tell him what had happened last night after I got back, but I just couldn’t get the words out. Draco turned his head to look at me, eyes full of worry. “Shh, it’s okay if you don’t want to talk about it.” He said and softly placed his index finger on my mouth to shush me. “I think I know what happened, I just need you to nod or shake your head, can you do that for me?” Draco asked softly and I nodded. Draco sent me a soft smile. “Did your friends get angry with you for making them worry?” I nodded. “And you had a fight?” I nodded again. The look on Draco’s face slowly changed as he asked the last question. “Let me guess, Ron freaked out and called you all sorts of things?” I nodded and sobbed silently. “Please don’t hurt him Draco- I’m sure he didn’t mean any of it-“ I trailed off and remembered the look on Ron’s face when he had called me a traitor. I was too upset to question why Draco suspected that it had been Ron. “Please make me forget. I don’t want to feel like this- Make the pain go away?” I begged and Draco looked at me with the gentlest eyes I had ever seen before he started kissing me and eventually made love to me. It was passionate, but gentle this time and by the time we were done, I had completely forgotten why I had been upset earlier
Harry was leaning against the doorframe leading to the study room where we usually met up. I noticed something different about Harry’s face almost instantly and I could feel the anger well up inside of me and I had to clench my fists. “Potter, what the hell happened to your face?” I asked and took a deep breath to calm myself down. Harry flinched at the sound of anger in my voice. “I- It’s nothing. Ron and I just had a disagreement, that’s all.” He said and looked away to hide his face from me. I sighed heavily and firmly grabbed Harry’s chin to force him to look at me.  “A disagreement you say. And just how did
as I read through the letter, I could feel tears of joy forming in my eyes and before I knew it, they dripped onto the letter in my hands.
Draco started moving his hips and grabbed my hips tighter to keep them in the air while he was thrusting himself inside of me. I was trembling in pleasure and didn’t even bother to try to cover up my moans at this point. I just wanted Draco to keep thrusting into me. I curled my fists around the bedsheet on each side of me and let my head sink into the pillow.
Anyways, I hope you enjoy!
Once I got back to the common room I decided to go straight to bed. I needed to come up with a plan to make up with Harry. I let myself fall onto my stomach on the bed and let out a frustrated groan into my pillow. I knew Harry probably just needed some space right now, but I hated the feeling of Harry hating me.
Days passed and I started to miss Draco less day by day. I was simply too busy during the day and too tired to think about anything before going to sleep. Most nights my head barely even hit the pillow before I was gone, but the few evenings I didn’t fall asleep instantly my thoughts weren’t focused on Draco, they were focused on next year’s semester on Hogwarts instead. I would be lying if I said that I had completely forgotten about Draco, because a few days before leaving to go back to Hogwarts an unknown owl arrived with a letter addressed to me but with the Weasley home’s address on it. I took one look at the letter and immediately knew who it was from. I could recognize that handwriting anywhere. I took a deep breath and shakily opened the letter, and oh Merlin was I surprised. Draco had practically sent me a novel in the letter.
Draco hesitated before pushing me onto my back. It was kind of nice to see that he was being careful, but I was too impatient to care. I just wanted him to fuck me, that was all. I signaled Draco that it was okay for him to continue, which made him light up a little. He gained back some of the confidence he had always shown and started undressing me.
I don’t know how long we were out there for, but we ended up having to skip dinner. There was no point in trying to get there in time, besides Harry needed me and he was too big of a mess to even think about food. Tears kept streaming down his face and he kept asking if I had really meant what I had written in the letter. I don’t know how many times I had to assure him that I had meant every single word and it was honestly starting to annoy me. ‘Why is he so damn insecure? Can’t he just accept the fact that I apologized and move on?’ I thought to myself and gently pulled away from Harry’s embrace. “Look Potter- It’s starting to get dark and we should probably head back to the castle. People might start to worry that I’ve kidnapped you or something.” I joked and it made Harry laugh softly. He nodded in agreement and we made our way up to the castle.
’ My stream of thoughts was quickly brought to an end when Draco started caressing my body. There was something different about Draco this time. He was more eager to get me out of my robes than usual. He seemed to be extremely turned on for some reason. I decided to tease him and started to deliberately oppose Draco’s attempt of getting me naked, a cheeky smile spreading across my lips as I could see the frustration on Draco’s face. His eyes were darkening, and I knew that I was playing with fire, but I couldn’t help myself. “Damn it Potter! Why are you opposing me?” he asked irritated and looked down at me with furrowed brows. My cheeky smile grew slightly as I answered. “Why not?” I asked and shrugged. Somewhere inside Draco a flip was switched, and his frustration turned into a smirk and his eyes flashed with lust. “Okay. You want to play, Potter? Then let’s play.” He said and grabbed my wrists with one hand before forcing them above my head. He then proceeded to take his belt off and before I knew it Draco had wrapped his belt around my hands with his free hand and tied my hands along with the belt to the bedpost. I could feel myself starting to harden and squirmed slightly underneath Draco. “Oh really now? Does being tied up turn you on, Potter?” Draco asked and smirked down at me. “N-no- What gives you that idea?” I asked tried my best not to show it. Draco’s eyebrow twitched. He slowly ran a hand up my chest, from there it gently moved along my throat, stopping at the front of my jaw before it grabbed me and forced my eyes to meet Draco’s. “Unfortunately for you, Potter, I didn’t give you permission to get hard.” Draco said as the smirk on his lips grew bigger. “I can’t help it- You’re just so hot.” I replied and innocently looked at Draco. I had a feeling about where this was going, and I would be lying if I said that’s not what I wanted. My entire body was screaming for Draco to touch me. Draco must’ve noticed as well, but he didn’t say nor do anything. He just watched me continuing to squirm underneath him. At this point I was as hard as a rock and Draco still hadn’t touched me apart from the hand on my jaw. Even though this wasn’t Draco hadn’t seen before I was still embarrassed, and I could feel the color rise in my cheeks. Draco slightly tightened his grip on my jaw. “Oh my, look at this. Did I tell you that you had permission to get this hard yet?” He asked silently and tilted his head slightly. “N-no-“ I whimpered and looked up at Draco. “What are you going to do about it? Punish me?” I asked silently, awaiting Draco’s response. Draco didn’t answer, in fact, he didn’t move at all. He just sat there, watching me squirm uncomfortably underneath him, a smirk curving on his lips. I tried shoving Draco off me by moving my legs, but instead I accidentally kneed him right in the groin. Draco groaned and bend slightly forward. “Damn it Potter, what was that for?” Draco panted and looked annoyed at me. Still a little surprised at what had just happened I let out a small laugh. “I’m sorry Draco, I didn’t mean to:” But it was too late for apologies. Draco untied my hands, yanked me around so that I was now on all four. He forced me closer to the bedpost and tied my hands up again. “Draco what are you-“ But before I could finish the sentence, Draco practically tore my pans off and I could hear the sound of fabric being ripped. I flinched at the feeling of something stiff and uncomfortably cold against my hole. “Draco- What is that?” I asked nervously, but Draco didn’t seem to be in the mood for talking right now. Instead he just shoved whatever it was right into my ass without a warning. I let out a small scream and tried to pull away from him, but he wouldn’t let me. “No. You are mine Potter. Mine to fuck, mine to love and mine to punish for acting like a little brat. Is that clear?” I yelped in pain and slowly nodded my head. I knew that if I opened my mouth to answer I would just start crying and ruin everything. I could hear Draco rustling around behind me to position himself better. Draco started moving whatever he had shoved into my ass and at first it was extremely painful, but it slowly started to feel good. I tried my best to stop my hips from pushing back towards Draco. Something was different about Draco, but I couldn’t put my finger on what it was. I had never seen him act like that before, but it was kind of hot, so I decided not to do anything about it. Draco must have gotten bored at some point, he pulled out whatever he had used on me and I heard the sound of pants unzipping. My entire body shivered with anticipation and I knew what was about to happen. I mentally braced myself for the pain I knew would occur when Draco would ram into me. Draco slowly and teasingly nudged his cock against my hole, and I let out a shaky breath. The teasing felt endless and I grew more and more impatient the longer Draco teased me. “Draco please- I-I’ll be a good boy I swear- I’m sorry for acting like a brat- Just- Just give it to me already!” I whimpered and rolled my hips against him, but Draco was persistent. Each time I rolled my hips against him he just moved out of the way. “I don’t believe you. You’ll have to more than just apologize.” Draco said and started teasing me again. “I’ll do anything- Just tell me what you want-“ Draco stopped nudging his cock against me to think. After about a minute he spoke again. “Anything you say? Alright. Blow me.” I tried to turn around to look at Draco, but the belt around my hands and the bedpost made it impossible. “Can you untie me then?” I asked, careful not to piss Draco off any more than he already seemed to be. He didn’t say anything but untied my hands but kept the belt around one of my wrists. As I turned around Draco grabbed me by the hair and practically forced me down to his cock. He was controlling the pace and how deep I went. I only had to make sure to watch out not to grace his cock with my teeth. It was clear that Draco was enjoying it, he was groaning quietly the entire time and I didn’t really have any other choice but to keep giving him the blowjob. I knew fighting was pointless, but I decided that I still wanted to tease him a bit. I blocked off his cock with my tongue to stop it from reaching all the way down inside of my throat. I could see the frustration grow in Draco’s face as he tried to force me further down. I sent him a cocky smile and deepthroated him a couple of times on my own, which made Draco let go of my hair. The second he let go I quickly removed my head and grinned up at Draco. “There, I blew you. What’s next?” I asked with the hint of a smirk curving on my lips. Draco glared at me with a look I had never seen before. It was lustful, hungry and angry at the same time. I barely even had time to react before Draco turned me around and forced my face into the bed. He had twisted both my arms behind my back, tied my hands together again and was holding on to the belt, lightly pulling on it. “Oh, I’ll show you what’s next.” Draco said behind me, ramming himself inside of me as he yanked the belt making me jolt backwards. I screamed in pleasurable pain and felt my entire body shutter. Draco yanked the belt again, this time with enough force to pull me upright. “Do you know why I’m being rough on you?” Draco asked, breathing against my neck. I nodded and felt my body shutter again at the feeling of Draco’s breath against my neck. “I-I was behaving like a brat- And this is my punishment- Ah!” I moaned as Draco thrusted into me. “That’s right. You’ve been a very bad boy.” I felt Draco’s breath on my neck again and next thing I Know is the feeling of teeth sinking softly into my neck. Draco had bitten me like I was his prey and growled deeply against my neck. “You’re mine Harry. Is that clear?” I nodded my head and bit my lip. Something inside Draco had changed, but I wasn’t sure what. Sure, he had taken the lead before, but never like this. He was being dominant on a whole other level than I had ever seen him before. It was almost scary, but also extremely hot at the same time. Draco was being a lot rougher than he usually was, but I didn’t mind. I had behaved badly, and this was my punishment. I moaned loudly when Draco thrusted deeply into me again. He was hitting my sweet spot right on, which sent shivers through my body. I was a moaning, panting and trembling mess. Draco seemed to be enjoying himself quite nicely behind me. He was breathing heavily against my neck as he kept thrusting into me. Draco bit into my neck again and this time I could feel his teeth piercing my skin. I whimpered in pain as I felt something warm and sticky run shoulder. Draco had bit my neck so hard it had started bleeding. At this point I didn’t care, I just wanted Draco to punish me. Draco seemed to notice as well, because he sped up his thrusts and yanked the belt, making me jolt backwards into his bite. A loud moan tore its way out of my throat, and I could feel my cheeks burn. Deep down I knew that my fellow Gryffindor students could hear everything, but I was too aroused to care at this point. The blood kept slowly streaming down my shoulder as Draco continued to thrust into, still hitting my sweet spot with each thrust he made. At this point there was nothing Draco couldn’t do to me that I wouldn’t find pleasurable. My entire body was shivering in pleasure and pain in a beautiful combination. Draco was growling and groaning behind me and I could tell that he was enjoying this as well. “Draco- I’m going to come- I-I can’t hold it in any longer-“ I moaned, but Draco growled at me in response. “No. You will come when I say you can and not a second before. Is that clear?” He snarled against my shoulder and suddenly, I felt the need to just obey him. I nodded and whimpered silently. Draco was thrusting as hard as fast as he possibly could and with a loud growl he came inside of me. I moaned loudly at the feeling of Draco filling me up and whimpered silently. It was getting quite uncomfortable. My cock was throbbing and aching. I wanted to come badly, but Draco had told me that I couldn’t until he said I could. Draco was panting and breathing heavily against my shoulder while shivering slightly with the after pleasure. After a few minutes he pulled away from my shoulder and I could feel his warm breath against my ear as he whispered. “You’ve been a good boy. You can come now, love.” As soon as Draco had finished his sentence my entire body shivered and a loud moan tore its way out of my throat as I came. My body gave in and I collapsed onto the bed panting and breathing heavily. As I was laying on the bed, face against the soft and cold mattress tears slowly started rolling down my cheeks. I was shaking heavily and clenched my fists around the sheets to hold back my tears. Even though it had felt amazing I was still scared of Draco. I had never seen him act like that before. I pulled myself away from him and curled up on the bed. Draco noticed instantly and was over me like a hawk. He tried to gently stroke my back, but that only made me move further away from him. “Don’t touch me-“ I whimpered and hid my face in the mattress. “I- I’m so sorry- I didn’t mean to hurt you- I don’t know what came over me-“ Draco trailed off when he noticed my tears. He was shocked to see that I was crying. “Harry I’m so sorry- I would
“Well, at least one of my siblings has done all the other winter sports, and I want to do something
than others at this school. I can introduce you to my friends, and you’ll see,” Malfoy says, sticking her hand out for Harry to shake.
Harry ignores it as best she can as she responds as she ought to to the semicircle rebuffing her: by recoiling once again.
I hesitate for a moment longer, but then I tell her the price. She hands me cash for exactly half the price of the room. “How much was the takeout?” I ask, still holding the cash.
And fix whatever put the crinkle there in the first place.
“Draco,” she begins hesitantly, “there’s something I haven’t told you. And I understand if you want me to leave after I tell you, but please let me finish first.”
“Why did I let you talk me into this?” Harry asks Ron.
I reach down, squeezing Draco’s hand where it still rests on my knee, swallowing down all the things I ought to say. There will be plenty of time for me to tell the truth—and for Draco to abandon me—later.
Harry looks around and is disappointed to see that they’ve arrived at the hallway and that there’s a crowd of parents gathering. In other words, there’s witnesses.
I’ve barely driven for another couple minutes when a motel comes into view. I gratefully gather both my purchases and some more cash from the glove box, and then head in to rent a room for the day and night. I’ve gone far enough that I think it’ll be okay if I spend some time here.
As Harry finally spots her own parents, she ruminates on how
teach Malfoy not to mess with her.
It only takes us a few moments to come to a stop outside the room labelled ‘110’.
She gracefully walks across the room to my chair. Then she takes my hand and gently pulls me to my feet.
nearly lost the timing.”
As I tilt my head to the side to get better access, I feel the flutter of Harry’s eyelashes against my cheekbone. I smile slightly against her lips, then resume my exploration.
“Draco, I think I love you,” she says, still breathless.
“You have to be the one to get the solo, Harry,” Ron says. “You worked so hard and your audition was
The rest of the troupe heads on stage without Harry. She and McGonagall are the only two people left.
Soon, I lose all track of time and reality as Draco and I dance to song after song.
Once I get there, I close the trunk firmly.
so real talk. this is the first story like this that i've ever written, and it takes a lot of effort for me to get it right. writing is something that i do for fun, purely for my own enjoyment, and currently i'm simply not getting sufficient validation (comments, kudos, bookmarks) to justify digging my heels in and continuing to write this.
Harry sways back in response and backpedals away from the circle. She loops around and then approaches from the back of the circle. As she nears her troupe members she makes eye contact with Malfoy, who takes the opportunity to wink– mocking– at her.
“I’ll probably keep wandering,” I say, with forced casualness.
“Whatever,” Daphne says, rolling her eyes. “If you must know, she went to the bathroom.”
The finale of this part is a forward somersault that ends with Harry on her knees before the crowd, her arms raised to the sky. The music mellows out for a moment to allow her to catch her breath, and in the interlude, the crowd bursts into applause.
Before I go to pay, I detour to the food section of the store and pick up a couple of bags of chips and a box of granola bars.
I go ahead and open up the glovebox, pulling the map out and unfolding it. I don’t really know what I’m looking at, so I shift my grip on the map and hold it out so Draco can easily reach over. “Don’t look over, just point at the map,” I say.
Harry nods absently. In the two years since she and Ron made the dance team, dance has quickly taken over her life– despite the constant annoyance of Malfoy’s presence. Harry, Ron, Malfoy, and Malfoy’s friend, Greengrass had been the only freshmen to make the team. This had led to a fierce competition: Harry and Ron versus Malfoy and Greengrass.
Harry’s lips quirk up at the sound of the name, and she hears Ron snort beside her. Harry decides that she must not have met Malfoy before, because she would have remembered a name that was so ridiculous.
“I’m going to the bathroom,” Harry says to Ron and Ginny.
I peel back just enough of the sheet to access the pocket, then slide my hand in. I pull out whatever it is, and my shoulders slump in relief when I see that it is a wallet that I have pulled out of the pocket.
My brows draw together, and my confusion is clear in my voice when I ask, “Me?”
Harry whirls around to stare at Malfoy’s back as she pulls the door open. Harry wants to protest, to say that she worked hard for her audition, that she’s earned it, but before she can, Malfoy has gone, the door slamming shut behind her once again.
After a few minutes of sitting in front of the television I begin to get restless, and so I get up to wander the room. I absently open the drawers of the bedside tables, and in the last drawer of the second table I find a notebook. I realize then what I ought to do for my restlessness.
“It’s a shame ‘break a leg’ is an expression for luck, because I really do hope you break a leg,” Malfoy says.
Draco pauses for a moment. Then she says, “Are you sure? I can just as easily go and book my own room. I wouldn’t want you to think that I pulled over to take advantage of you or anything.”
McGonagall turns to her and says, “You’ve got this, Potter. I chose you for a reason, and you’re going to do us all proud.” Then she turns and hurries off to sit in the audience with the rest of the troupe leaders.
Ron glances over at Malfoy, then fixes her eyes on Harry and says, “I think you’re losing the beat a little bit at the middle part, but you pick it up again so quickly that it should be okay.”
I reach up with my hand and lightly place it on top of hers. Now both our hands are resting against my throat. I shake my head minutely and say, just as softly, “Not now, not yet.”
I rub absentmindedly at the bruising I’m sure is going to form around my neck and steel my resolve. I made this far; I am not going to back down now.
Once Draco is back, she sets the chair down in front of the sink. I sit down, leaning back and dumping my hair into the sink. It doesn’t take too long to dye my hair, and it actually looks pretty good once it’s done. Far better than I thought it would have, considering that I’ve had the same black colour for most of my life. If I have a ‘rest of my life’, I hope to never dye my hair again, since I have always been fond of my hair color, despite the derision the Dursleys gave me for it.
Before Harry can manage anything more than an angry sound and a lunge in Malfoy’s direction, Ginny and Ron each grab one of Harry’s hands and tow her away. They end up where everyone is grouping up to make their way to the stage.
Once Draco is done with my hair she pauses, and we once again make eye contact in the mirror.
I briefly break our kiss, smiling at Harry’s disappointed gasp. “Just a moment,” I say breathlessly.
Draco looks around the hallway that we’re standing in, then takes my hand, striding off purposefully. “This way,” she says.
I set the wallet to the side of my trunk and begin the laborious process of removing the body from the car. I have to drag the body off the road and into the trees while carefully navigating the treacherous ground and a small part of me is glad that I don’t have to worry about ruining my clothes, since they’re already ruined.
“I think we ought to swing the chair around,” she says. “So I can reach the front of your hair more easily.”
Before Harry can say anything else to Ron, Harry notices that someone is striding over towards them.
. And besides, the flyers all said that beginners are welcome, and I swear the way that you play field hockey looks like dancing. ”
“Remember the day after we met, when you went to sell your car?” I ask. She nods, so I continue, “On my way to the park I was listening to the radio, and they were warning people to be on the lookout for a woman named Rose Potter. She was wanted for murder of her uncle. And I knew that your real name was Rose Potter, because I’d seen your ID while we’d been packing our bags that morning.”
Then her hands resume their motions. I close my eyes for a while, allowing myself to simply enjoy the gentle contact. After another moment or two, Draco slowly removes her hands from my hair. I reluctantly open my eyes and sit up.
A bell rings as I open the door. A teenager sitting behind the store counter asks, in an inimitably bored tone, “How can I help you?”
Harry frowns and glances over at the door to the bathroom just in time to see it slam shut. Harry knows then that Malfoy must be upset. Harry wonders for a moment why none of Malfoy’s friends have gone after her, then sees that Daphne is caught in an argument with Parkinson, Daphne’s arm still held in Parkinson’s hand.
“Could you direct me to your hair dye?” I say pleasantly.
Harry’s eyes widen and she nods. “Nevermind, then.” A distant part of her notes that Malfoy is way out of Parkinson’s league, even accounting for how annoying they both are.
I smile back and say, “I won’t.”
Harry takes in a long shuddering breath, then says, “The beginning… I guess you should know that my parents died in a car accident when I was still a baby, and that I was sent to live with my aunt, uncle, and cousin. They weren’t– they weren’t nice people. But they were all I had.
As I make my way slowly to my room, I realize that I’ve started to shake a bit. I suppose that it must be my exhaustion finally catching up to me, so I pause and lean against the outside of the room for a moment. I close my eyes and take in a deep, steadying breath.
and she
“My uncle– Vernon– always hated me the most, of the three of them, so maybe I shouldn’t have been so surprised when he tried to kill me. He slammed me up against the wall and gave me those bruises you saw in the bathroom the day that we met...” Harry says, trailing off and absently rubbing at her neck.
“If you say so,” Harry says skeptically, shrugging. The motion causes her shoulders to brush against her hair, which she realizes that she had forgotten to put it up. She sighs and begins the laborious process of collecting all of her messy hair into a ponytail.
Then I realize that I’ve been quite stupid, that I have forgotten something incredibly important. I steel myself and reach into the trunk, patting the lump near where I think the trousers pockets ought to be. My hand hits something firm and I try to hold back my exhale of relief until I am sure it is what I hope it is.
The walk to the stage entrance takes no time at all, and before Harry knows it they’re all lined up, ready to step on stage. Harry is at the back of the line because her solo calls for a late entrance. She nervously resumes bouncing onto the balls of her feet before settling back down onto her heels.
I take a half-step away from her and say, “I’m sorry, who are you?”
“C’mon Harry, you gotta get your head in the dance, we probably only have a minute or two left before we’re on– before it’s time for your solo,” Ron says.
She finally remembers that she had had competition for the part and glances around curiously to see what Malfoy is doing. It takes her mere seconds to determine that Malfoy is no longer in the auditorium.
I shove down the guilt I feel at lying to Draco, fixing my eyes firmly on the road ahead of us.
The moment is broken as she resumes cutting my hair, and I feel a flash of regret from not confiding in her. But if I’d told her about the bruising, and my uncle in general, I can tell that I wouldn’t have been able to stop until I’d told her everything. And I can’t see it going well if I tell her that I killed my uncle.
and i post previews, sneak peaks, and updates there!
I’m quite grateful that the road is mostly empty at this time of night as I sit there in the driver’s seat of the car, french-braiding my hair as flat against my head as it will go, a difficult task given the texture of my hair, but one that I am determined to manage. Once done, I survey my appearance in my rear-view window and nod in satisfaction. It won’t fool anyone who knows me, but it ought to stop people who have spent too much time listening to Petunia from recognizing me immediately.
Harry mutters incoherently for a moment, running her hand through her hair, then says, “Fine, fine you’re right. I need to focus, but god, I just wanna teach her a lesson.”
I can’t even begin to comprehend how
Between my shower and my dithering, I must have shut myself away for too long, because Draco knocks on the door and asks, “Are you alright in there, Harry? It’s been awhile since the shower turned off. I don’t mean to pry, but I was just getting a bit worried.” Then she stops herself, as if worried she’s gone too far.
“Alright,” she replies. Then she adds, with a smile, “Don’t drown in there.”
accidentally posted this yesterday with the wrong publish date, so here i am, posting it again.
I decide to dye my hair first and cut it afterwards. So I set about following the instructions on the back of the boxed hair dye. It advises the user to have help applying the dye to the back of their hair, and I dither for longer than I’d like to over whether to ask Draco to help me. I don’t want to impose, but it would be easier with her help.
Harry whirls back around to face the audience, then walks backwards towards the circle. She is grateful that Ron and Ginny are part of the troupe because this next part would be near impossible without people she trusts here.
“Yeah,” Ron says, “if we lose it’d be because of her trying to fuck you over the whole time.”
Harry smiles again, shakes her head, and says, “Thank you, but I mean, is there anything I need to fix?”
“I was getting there, Ms Weasley,” McGonagall says primly. “I’ve decided that the solo will go to Ms Potter. I’m sorry Ms Malfoy, but your technique just didn’t bring the
but we all know better,” Harry says with a glare.
Draco looks exasperated as she glances over to meet my eyes. She says, “But you
“I would love to help,” Draco says, striding across the bathroom to where I’m standing, which is in front of the sink.
I go into the bathroom and gently close the door behind me.
Harry frowns at that and angles her body slightly away from Malfoy and towards Ron. In the few short months since they’d met, Ron has become one of her best friends, and Harry can’t help but feel irritated with this girl who seems to have walked over just to insult her friend.
Harry stalks to the front of the stage and drops into a crouch. She only stays down for the briefest of moments before she leaps to her feet again, spinning off to the side. She rushes at the semicircle of trope members, and the people closest to her lean onto their toes, reaching their arms up above their heads.
“I’ve got something,” Malfoy says, “I don’t think you’re bringing the right–
Forget nearing her breaking point, Harry has just reached it. She snarls and launches herself at Malfoy. She’s had
I glance back at her in the mirror to see that she’s looking steadily at me. “If you wouldn’t mind,” I say, trailing off uncertainly.
The rest is, as they say, history. I bring my thoughts back to the present and refocus on Harry. She’s still sitting with her shoulders slumped and her lip between her teeth. I sigh and reach forward to gently extricate her lip out. It’s the last interruption I’ll allow myself to have until Harry has said everything that’s on her mind.
I also had little desire to remain among the useless, despicable men who were responsible for my oppression. I had decided, as the light in my kitchen had grown darker, on what I needed to do.
Shaking off this irrelevant train of thought, Harry walks off towards the bathroom. The walk across the gym seems to take longer than normal as she tries to think of what she’ll find when she gets there– and what she’ll do with what she does find.
One day, when I had been sitting at my desk and watching one of my colleagues announce his engagement, I realized how horribly unfulfilled I was. And on the heels of that realization was the realization that I was lonely.
The box of dye is still in my hand, and so I watch as she reaches for it. I quickly hand it over to her. She scans the directions I had read only moments ago. Then she nods confidently and says, “I’m going to go and grab a chair, and then I am going to absolutely
“You’re a wanderer too?” Draco asks, sounding pleased.
I take some of the cash out and slide it into my bra, put some more into the glove box, and then tuck the final portion under the floor mat beneath the driver’s seat. Then I sort through the cards in his wallet, hoping that one of them will be something useful, something that doesn’t bear Vernon’s name. My reluctance to use anything that could be easily tracked back to him, and thus to me, means that I will have to abandon his credit cards.
The biggest problem is, of course, the rags that I’m wearing. I should have stolen something else, anything else, before driving off into the night, but my mind had been so clouded with panic that I failed to plan for anything at all.
I walk around to open up my trunk, and I’m confronted with the body for the first time since I had managed to shove it into my trunk. I reach into the trunk and carefully tuck the sheet I wrapped him in tighter. I have no desire to have a last look at the man who destroyed my childhood. I stand there for some time, not sure how long, staring at the large, shapeless lump that is illuminated by the weak light built into the car.
something, but I say, “Maybe,” anyways.
But there is no way I will be allowed to get away with killing Vernon.
My haircut turns out remarkably well considering that it was done by a beginner in a dingy motel bathroom. I thank Draco again, and then we go back out to the main room. It’s still early, so we settle back into the chairs by the television.
thanks for reading! also if you're coming from how like home, the next chapter of that is in the works, grad school is just kicking my ass
I look back through the drawers for the pen I’d seen in one of them. Then I take both the notebook and the pen back to the chair I’d been sitting in. There’s a phone number written on the first page of the notebook, so I skip to the second page, which is blank.
“Who is she?” I ask through the pain in my gut. I should have known better than to get so attached so quickly.
When she had stopped her car at the corner convenience store, I’d parked halfway down the block, just to keep an eye on her. I had known that going into the store after her would make it much too easy for her to see me and get suspicious—especially since Harry and I had met eyes at the gas station—and I didn’t want that yet.
“Draconia? What are you doing?”
I know we’ll never find it because I’m not looking
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Ginny says, getting to her feet.
It’s simple enough to find the single shelf containing the color options, but then I’m stumped. I hadn’t gotten so far as to decide what color to dye my hair. I’m staring back and forth between the dark tail of my braid and the boxes of dye, hesitating. Then I take a deep breath and grab the box of red dye.
I take a deep breath of air. Then I place one knee on either side of Harry’s legs and sit back, part of my weight on her lap, part of my weight on my heels.
I'm sorry to say that that's all I've written! there's a decent chance I'll come back to this universe one day and the response has been so nice that I'm also considering an entirely separate wlw!drarry au and if you'd like to push that agenda feel free to comment below or find me on my tumblr
Then I tangle one of my hands into Harry’s wild hair, sliding the other around to Harry’s back. I have to resist the urge to just slide her shirt over her head. As much as I want that to happen now, I think it’s best for us if I wait.
Harry bounces forward nervously onto the balls of her feet, then settles back down onto her heels.
I sit up slowly and rub the sleep out of my eyes.
“Because it’ll be fun!” Ron says. “The worst that can happen is we don’t make it this year and have to try again next year.”
The door swings open and I step through, holding the door open for Draco. “Go on,” I say, not entirely sure why I’m being so insistent.
And now, they were currently in the audience section of the school auditorium along with all the other dance team hopefuls. Harry absently tugs at her sports bra as she glances around.
Parkinson has her hand around Daphne’s arm in a vice grip, which Harry eyes with curiosity before deciding that it’s none of her business.
I come awake slowly, after a blessedly dreamless sleep, to the sounds of a sitcom playing on the TV. My mouth is dry and it feels like there’s cotton in my ears. I should’ve known I’d wake up feeling odd— I’d made the mistake of driving through the night and sleeping through the following day. I probably ought to get used to being nocturnal, though, because I am on the run.
After spending so long looking for her, there had been no way that I was going to let her go.
I jump about a foot into the air in my shock. My eyes land on the woman from the gas station earlier. Up close, she’s strikingly pretty. She’s wearing a cinched suede skirt that has a fringe along the bottom. There’s a black, sleeveless button-up shirt tucked into it. The cool tones of her clothes compliment her porcelain white skin and her silver eyes.
“Thank you,” I say, taking my bag along with me into the bathroom. She hands me her toiletries, then steps out of the bathroom.
“Think my name is funny, do you?” Malfoy asks. Then she runs her eyes over Ron, and says, “I don’t need to ask what
I pay the teenager in cash, then go back to the car to stow my purchases away. I still have some time left on the meter, so I go into the clothing store across the street. When I’d  paid at the convenience store, I’d also discretely counted how much money I had left, so I have an idea of how much I can afford to spend here.
Draco navigates the car into the turning lane and says, “Why not? Maybe we’ll find what you’re looking for.”
The day I set eyes on Harry at that droll gas station had been several months after I’d set off into the countryside. In all that time, I had never managed to quite articulate what it was, exactly, that I was looking for. But as soon as I’d set my eyes on Harry, I had known that she was the one. When she had finished pumping her gas and set off down the main street of that tiny town, I had waited a few moments, then set off after her.
That moment is quickly followed by the memory of the moment when I’d come back to the motel room to find Harry deeply asleep atop the covers of the motel bed, limbs askew, and I’d felt the very same pulsating of my chest and twist in my gut as I’d stood there and watched her.
Harry has been acting off all day, so I’ve decided to give her some space. To occupy the time, I allow my mind to drift back to the time before I met her, back when I was still a wanderer, searching.
Harry rolls her eyes. “But why
“Actually, uh, I’m trying to dye my hair,” I say. “And I was wondering if you could help? The door’s unlocked, if you don’t mind.” I’ve barely finished speaking when the bathroom door opens.
While I had been driving, I hadn’t been bothered much by what I’d done– or what had driven me to do it– but I can now feel the darkness of those thoughts lurking around the edges of my exhausted consciousness. I begin to worry about what I will dream of once I finally fall asleep, but then–
the last chapter will be from draco's pov :D
Since then, Ron and Harry have been joined by Ron’s sister, Ginny. Unfortunately, Malfoy’s side has also grown, as she and Daphne were joined by both Daphne’s sister, Astoria, and another girl named Parkinson.
could be the person that
Once I’m satisfied that I’m as clean as I’m going to get, I step out and dry myself off, trying not to think too hard about the likely state of the provided towels. I get dressed in the polka-dot outfit I’d purchased, and then set out the materials to fix my hair. My shower has ensured that my hair has returned to its wild, untamable state.
can’t believe that you fucked it up so badly,” Malfoy says, interrupting Harry. “I mean c’mon, you had how long to practice that? And you
Then she guides me over to the bed, shoving me gently down towards it. I go willingly. “Get under the covers, silly,” she says. “We’re going to bed now.”
The dancing that Draco teaches me is very different from the restricted behavior I’m used to. It’s very free and unstructured, and is clearly intended purely for my own enjoyment.
She hurries into the bathroom and scoops the toiletries into her bag. Then she rejoins me in the main room, and I lock the door behind us before we walk together to the lobby to check out. Down in the parking lot of the motel, she gives me directions to the car dealership, and then we go into our separate cars.
“Bloody Potter.” Draco spit out.
It was Greg that spoke, “You ok?”
Severus looked at the headmaster, quirked an eyebrow and moved over to the bed. “Mr. Potter, open your eyes please, Madam Pomfrey needs to ask you a few questions.”
“Don’t move,” Harry instructed, and he felt the shiver of Draco’s body under his touch.
Despite all that they had done, Draco was thrown back into the grey darkness when he saw Harry in Hagrid's arms.  He just wanted to let go in that moment, he could no longer feel, and everything meant nothing once again.  His parents tried to lead him away, but he broke free when he heard the meley behind him.  He would bleed for Harry if that is what it took to be alive if only for a little while. He captured his mother's wand and ran as fast as he could towards the crowds, casting every spell that would flow from his lips.  His blood ran hot and his body blazed at the calling towards his haven.  A path of traitors littered his way, and the devil was paying his due when Draco finally broke through and watched.  When the ashes had dissipated Draco walked closer, reaching just to touch, just needing the reassurance.  Harry stared back, unblinking, taking Draco's hand and holding it tight.  Both were now on a new path.  Blood trailed from cuts on Harry's face, Draco's own face was damaged, and they felt.  Felt beyond the pain, beyond the responsibilities, beyond the expectations, and they connected.  Fire and ice, Yin and Yang, Enemy and Lovers, everything that could be broken was, and now they stood balanced.
“Ron Weasley and strategy?” Severus asked.
“Next,” Harry looked at Hermione, “Can you research visions, and see if there are any documentation on ones such as mine, and the effects decisions have on them?”
Harry walked alone to the Great Hall for breakfast and did not look back.  He knew it was a test, but an easy one.   He would not lie or force people, that was not who he was.
“In my Vision, my mother left my Aunt a vault and a property to go to her in case she divorced. In her letter, My Aunt mentioned it had been going on for years. I think I could get Severus to help with Veritaserum and find out… Possibly… I am not sure how I could convince my Aunt to work with us… Though it seems they are the target of Voldemort’s revenge against me.” Harry said.
“Whatever happens in the next few days, I will need to talk to Amelia. It is time she knows. Time is at hand and in a few month's time, everything will be revealed.” Harry said
His wand hand cast a quick spell and he and the mutt just where he wanted him… panting, needy and naked. Their bodies were pressed together, Sirius’ legs were around Severus’ waist. He held on maneuvering Sirius to just the right angle and plunged in deep as he dropped Sirius down on his length. Sirius cried out his name. Severus stilled them both, and reached with one hand to tangle in dark hair. He pulled and Sirius did not fight him, exposing his neck.
“Who died?” Draco coaxed.
“Cast a shield. Do not look into my eyes.” He directed.
Harry beamed at his friends, “I am glad, life isn’t always easy and the best choices are usually the hardest ones.  But they are the most worthwhile in the end.”  Hermione nodded, “You are starting to sound like a grownup, Harry.  Your sense is spot on and you are definitely more persuasive than you used to be.  You will make such a great teacher for the D.A. and a leader.”
“Harry, so far, all I hear from you is good sense, and sound logic.  Your mature, you have the same mind working as an adult, and the calmness.  Your anger is what used to get you into trouble, and you're rushing into things without thinking.  Luck is good, but sense is better.  I kind of like how you have changed.  You're still you, but better, more mature and definitely someone I can trust.” She assured, her warm comfort seemed to seep from her.
“And I am repairing the relationship with Professor Snape.” He watched his godfather’s eye widen, “I suggest you start treating him with respect, without him, none of what I am doing now, or what I did in my vision would have been possible.  That man has suffered much, at the marauder's hands, and the hands of others, he deserves gratitude and respect...do try and afford him what he deserves, and leave petty rivalries in the past.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He walked into the classroom, and noted that the Professor waited for him at the supply closet. Harry turned and shut the door, not locking it this time.
“Do you have a plan in place, Mr. Potter?” Lucius asked.
A/N~Another chapter that is only part of a day... Christmas day will be two chapters... So much goes on in Harry's life... Lol.
“I know that he wants to go after the Dursley’s, but there is another part of them I need your help with.” Harry stated.
Draco appeared, his blond hair falling in several directions, as if he had run his hands through it several times. This gave him an almost unrefined look, it suited his face, and made Harry ache at the beauty that it presented.  Draco moved closer to Harry his silver eyes slashing into curious emeralds. “Only friends Harry?  Did you feel nothing in those moments?”  Draco’s breath ghosted over Harry’s ear as he leaned closer.
“Mrs. Malfoy, thank you for taking the time to see me. May I assume I can speak freely, without interruption so that you may understand why I have asked you to meet with me?” Harry asked, looking straight into her ice blue eyes.
Harry stayed his movements for just a brief moment.  Then pulled almost all the way out, only to slam back in once again.
“Show me.” She demanded.

“What makes you think that you are a plaything, Black?” Severus issued the question like a command. He saw a spark fly in Sirius’ grey eyes.
Harry turned to face her, put his arm about his waist and dipped forward in a short but perfunctory bow.
“Do I look like myself anymore?” Harry asked.
Harry moved off his bed, still it felt off… His bed, the red hangings thick and rich, the sheets crimson and clean.  The bed was smaller than he was used to, or at least thought he was used to.  How strange it feels, knowing it was a vision, yet feeling like you are living a dream of memories.  He opened his nightstand drawer and retrieved a quill and small bit of parchment.  His heart gave a leap knowing Hedwig would be delivering this note.  No matter how many times he had seen her since the vision, he could not help smiling. She was beautiful, soft and alive.  Something about that bird had always touched him.  Even in his vision, he had never fully replaced her.  Ginny had a family owl, the boys got their own when they started, but Harry, he could never bring himself to actually purchase a new one for himself.  Hagrid tried once, but Harry refused and Hagrid kept the bird for himself.  Grief was an old friend in his life.
“Harry, what charm is that?” Hermione asked, her curiosity and taste for learning was piqued.
Draco was the first to arrive, he moved closer to Harry, inadvertently placing a distance between himself and the Headmaster.
“Well… I won’t let him have all the fun. Come on, lets test out our own abilities.” Ron said as he leaned forward and took off...Draco not far behind.
“Ow!” Ron groaned, shaking out his hand, “Did you get steel implants or something?”
Harry was pulled out of his own thoughts, he blinked and began to actually see.
Draco’s glances were giving Harry butterflies each time their eyes connected.  He tried to suppress the feeling, but it was very difficult.  Draco’s hand brushed his as they both tried to get up and leave at the same time.  It was an uncommon heat that flashed between them, Harry looked away quickly and Draco’s pale features blossomed into a very becoming blush.
“Are you sure telling her is the right course of action. What if she tells the Minister?” Severus asked.
“I need this, you...and not just tonight. Please…” Draco swallowed his fear, “Keep me, please”
“Whatever is past, is past.  We have a future that is all that matters.” Harry whispered, and sighed as he saw the acceptance wash over Draco.
Draco was sorry he asked, the pain across Harry’s face was wrenching. He reached out and hugged his dark angel.
Severus stumbled through the floo to his rooms his stomach ready to empty its contents.
Draco Malfoy moved now, with purpose.  Since that day in the bathroom where the life within him drained, he had touched feelings like never before.  Down the dark halls, he moved silently.  He found his targets, Crabbe and Goyle, both had been included in plans that would devastate Harry and his cause.  He had to lead them into a place where they could be dealt with and away from the main fight.  Their encounter with Potter and friends in the Room of Requirements did not go as planned, and Draco found himself being engulfed in flames.  The feeling of life and death surrounded him.  He could taste death, and in that taste, he relished his own life and looked up to meet his salvation once again.  Everything inside him was alive when Harry touched him.   He was undone and broken before this man in everything he had done just to reveal himself to this one person.  His vulnerabilities, his strengths and his fears were all known to Harry.  Once this was all said and done, he would go back to the grey that was his life, but for now, in this moment, he would live and feel with Harry.  They moved as one on the broom out of the way of flames and falling piles of trash, books and larger objects.
Sorry.  Can we talk after lunch?  Astronomy Tower?
“What is your wife’s name.”
Pansy, Blaise, and Greg stood behind Draco, each with their wands drawn.  Millicent and Nott looked at the scene and stood.  They looked between Vince and Draco.
“I know…I know Severus... You couldn’t have Her… so you're settling for me... and..” Sirius started to back away as Severus advanced on him. Sirius never saw the wand, only found his thoughts and memories bared before Severus instantly.
Draco’s answering smile showed how elated he was to be included, “Always.”  He wanted Harry to know that he could be counted on, that he would be there for Harry.  He did not understand this relationship yet, and it scared him a little, but he would finally do something right.  He would commit to Harry.
Harry closed his eyes… pressed his will, demanding the falling of his powers... They receded.
“You can’t give up everything and be friends with Potter!  He is back, and you know our families will require our loyalty.” Vince spat, “Potty will be nothing but smear on the Dark Lord’s shoes.”
“If it’s important to you the old bat join us, I have no objections. I will behave like an adult. Promise.” Sirius conceded.
Lucius quirked an eyebrow, but Narcissa placed a hand on his arm, and she and Draco settled into chairs in front of the Patriarch.
That evening he had felt the Voldemort visions try to enter his mind, it was merely an irritating knock now and he chose to reject their entry for now, later they may be useful, but tonight it was merely a Ministry vision. It was late, and now he was awake. He lay in his bed categorizing the spells he would teach the students when they started at the end of October. So many useful spells came to mind. Some were easier than those he had taught the first time around, used less concentration. He would still work with them on their patronus charms, but now he would add a few of the new hexes he knew. Ginny’s Reduccio would be great, since it combined reducto and accio, shrinking and summoning the person could be very helpful in situations. Sectumtempus would be another. This was based off of Severus’ original spell, but instead of permanent damage, it was temporary and minimal blood loss inflicted as it was only skin deep. As a deterrent though, it was very effective.
Harry nodded, he liked that.  He would have to transfigure his family members for the ruse…
After they had said their goodbyes, Harry canceled the privacy charm and laid down.  His mind felt more at ease, calm and he drifted closer to sleep until he finally succumbed.
“Wisdom” Harry’s voice roared through the room, his arms sweeping out around him in an upward arch and he traced the rune with one hand, a glowing green rune.
“So what have you been about?” He asked.
“Do not go anywhere alone. I would even ask you to stay in this house unless you are with me, or someone else I trust.” Harry begged.
The moment was broken as the sink descended to reveal the opening he had commanded.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked, not taking his hand away, afraid the loss of color in Harry meant something foreboding.  The raven haired boy had quickly gone from peachy to ghost.  Harry’s body was trembling, and cold.  Draco stopped their movement.
Seamus seemed to just glare at him. Harry knew in the end he would come around, so he took no issue. Harry headed up the stairs, the feeling of Deja vu came over him. At least he was starting to form a plan.
Harry looked at him, “Do you trust me?”
“Can you test this batch when it is done? To see if it works.” Severus asked.
It was the Weasley that started it this time, instigating Pansy by mentioning her mom or some such nonsense.  Draco wasn’t listening, he was waiting.  Waiting for Harry to get involved as he always does.  The thought of kissing Harry was nerve-wracking, Draco felt nauseous, which he totally knew would happen.  However, a bet was a bet.
Harry smiled back, and then pushed onto his next brilliant scheme.
Earlier that day the Order of the Phoenix had a meeting to finalize the schedule for the Hall of Prophecy rotations.  Dumbledore was adamant not to have any changes, and he imparted to the rest that they would be including Harry in some meetings in the future.
Harry took that all in. He knew from the date she gave, what wrong needed to be righted. He was still working on the plan for that. But new responsibility was another issue.
Both Ron and Hermione nodded.
Harry climbed up into the chamber and offered a hand to help Draco up.
Harry was up early, showered and dressed impeccably, though his hair as ever did not seem to cooperate.  Hermione and Ron were going on a date today, so why not him… It would be his first date… sort of… and that made Harry smile.  Though he held memories of a vision, he was starting to feel that this time and place were his own, where he was meant to be.  So all these new things with Draco, were really new.  Not even anything in his memories could compare.  Harry made it down to the Slytherin dorms and found Pansy leaving.  She looked wary to see him, but gave him a weak smile and a nod.  So she had chosen her side after all.
Severus felt a bit of unease creep up his back. He slid his wand into his palm and waited.
“All supporters will be free in January. I have to have everything in place to end this war 2 years earlier, I plan to have us all free by June. Mr. Malfoy will be critical to that plan. Please confer with your family. But I will warn you, if you choose to not help, I will reject the power offered to me as the Augur Saeculum, and cause everything to be as it was in my vision. I am willing to give up this power and knowledge, to ensure what needs to be done is done. And on that you have my oath as a Wizard on my magic.” Harry state, a golden string of glowing magic, encircled him, and then seeped into his heart.
“No.”
Harry waited for the outrage, the emotion, an outbreak or something.  What he didn’t expect was the slow smile on Narcissa’s face, a shine in the eyes of Lucius as he looked down at his son.  Evidently being linked with an Augur was respected, even if it was to Harry Potter.  Draco looked at his parents and nodded, then back at Harry locking gazes.
Harry started laughing, “Your mother’s form of a joke?”
“You have been good for him.” She interrupted smiling brightly.
Amelia stepped into his office after the last student had left the classroom below.
Escalation happened with Harry stepping in front of Weasley, and Draco moving in front of Pansy.  And Draco made his move.  He reached forward and grabbed Harry’s collar, and shoved him quickly against the nearest wall.  The element of surprise was good, he could kiss him quickly and then run before spells were cast.  Harry’s eyes were wide, and Draco quickly pressed his lips to Harry’s.
“Understood, Mrs. Malfoy.  Thank you.” Harry bowed, then reached for the box she extended, “How did you know which one?”
“If we do this, do you know what this means?” Harry asked, his voice raw with need.
The next day brought with it sunshine in spite of the chill outside.  Saturday, was a Hogsmeade day, most of the students would be out of the castle.  Harry was looking forward to this day, he had a plan.
Harry drew back, breathing heavily.  How could one kiss devastate his body so much?  He saw Hermione smiling out of the corner of his eye, and knew she had a hand in this.  It didn’t matter.  He took Draco’s hand, walked him out of the hall, and then started towards the door to a nearby empty classroom.
Harry grimaced a moment before replying, “I had a vision where I lived out my life for the next 21 years.  It was not a single event, it was a lifetime.  I saw war, death, love, births, etc.  I lived it all the good and the bad.  According to research, there is only a few people that have living visions, they are the Augur Saeculum, the seer of the age, like Merlin.”
“I think he had another vision from Voldemort, but I am not entirely sure,” Severus stated.
“Well, you did figure out she had an illegal animagus form...Use that and sweeten the deal by offering her an exclusive interview with yours truly” Harry said with a smile, “No pictures though… I want that outlined upfront.”
Harry and his friends were eating lunch in the Great Hall, when Draco approached their table.  Draco was nervous, not sure how to start things, but he knew he wanted to be the one to show the first gesture.  His heart beat at a frantic pace, each step closer to the raven haired boy.  What would Harry do, now that he was letting his guard down, showing Draco to the school?
“There is something else isn’t there…” Dumbledore alluded the twinkle in his eyes were back.
After the second week, Draco had taken to reminding Harry when it was time to leave.  His concentration was more severe after he had the entire web spun.  His spells were complex, and difficult, taking a lot of his willpower to cast and weave into each thread.  Draco would sometimes have to interrupt after an incantation and take him up to the tower to pass off to Hermione who would make him sleep.  Draco was getting worried, Harry was starting to get tense and anxious as the third week rolled on.  But on Tuesday Harry seemed to have a breakthrough in whatever he was doing.  Draco watched as Harry seemed to come alive in front of him, eyes bright, smile wide, and he had turned to Draco and hugged him.  Everything in Draco wanted to kiss Harry, but he wanted to let Harry have the focus he needed, he had promised that.  His own needs and wants could wait.
The darkness engulfed them, until Harry lit a sconce on the wall.  In silence Draco followed, up dark wooden stairs.  Harry opened a dark wooden door and pulled Draco in with him.  One wave of Harry's wand and the dust in the room was gone, only a dark bed with navy linens remained.
He did not stay to answer any questions, nor face any insults. He was beyond childish behavior. He walked into the Great Hall, the headmaster watching him intently as Severus was moving to his own seat. Harry sat down next to Ron and Hermione. Hermione gestured over towards Ginny who was talking intently with Dean. Harry just looked at her and shrugged. “You're telling me that it doesn’t bother you?” Hermione added, stress in her voice. Harry had almost forgot her and Ron had not gotten together yet and she was looking for some sympathy.
“Napping.” Severus said, a wicked smile firmly on his face.
Harry tried to put his mind back in order, turned back towards Draco, and planted a quick perfunctory kiss on those pink lips.
3. No disclosure of meeting discussion with outside parties unless agreed upon.
He heard a whispered, “Shhh… I’m sleeping.” come from the bed and smiled.  Severus went to the door of his office…
“Yes, I can do that.  I would love to acquaint your students with our culture. Too many myths persist about us.” Sanguini commented.
“I have created a field within this room against detection, sir, so please use the Cruciatus, so everyone can see this charm as it is meant to be used.” Turning to the rest of the students, whose eyes were wide at his instructions, “Students will be practicing against the Afflictio curse, which is a mildest legal hex form of the Cruciatus, as you know, but not dangerous or deadly.  It will give you a real-world feel for casting your charm and preventing the devastation and a feel for the effects of the charm.  The headmaster will supervise in case anything goes wrong.”  There were audible sighs among the crowd of teenagers.
Narcissa nodded. The hour was almost up, she pulled out a small coin. “Take hold of this, and upon the hour, it will bring you back to where you belong.”
Her face went red. “For how long.”  She was trying to hold on to her world, it was tipping precariously...
“Petunia… is dinner ready, I am starving.” He said as he rounded the living room, only to fall with a loud thump as the stunning spell hit him in the chest.
“YOU?” She cried out with an indignant huff.
Ron, Harry and Draco both mounted their brooms, and then took off… Harry felt free...the wind in his hair, the taste of freedom, the tensions flowed away on the breeze.  He spiraled, zigged and zagged, dropped and pulled up, then flattened his body against the broom letting the air flow around his body.  He was flying, so fast the other two stopped to watch.  Harry was a blur, shooting across the area like a bullet, almost too fast to see.  Then they watched him soar straight up and freefall towards the ground.  Draco gasped, his heart racing watching Harry plunge once again...Parts of his anatomy were paying attention to every angle of Harry’s body as it flowed as one with the broom.
“Of course...He was a strange elf, but good.” Draco said.
“I have discussed it with her, I will refuse the power of the Augur, and let things play out as they had in my vision.  That is the only course I can see.” Harry said.
Each other student in turn tried conjuring their own patronus, but only a select few were able.  At the end of the session, Harry decided to demonstrate the technique for everyone, with the help of those who had managed a full patronus.  They all stood about six feet apart, Hermione the furthest left, followed by Luna, Neville, Draco, Harry, Ron and Dean.  Everyone watched closely as the group concentrated, swooped their wands and in unison, spoke the words of the charm.
Harry paced in front of the wall. When the door appeared he took Draco’s hand and opened it, hoping everything would be just right.
Albus turned to Ron. “What happened in class, was it a vision like last time?”
They had fun, pure fun and they all flew circles around each other.  Ron was good at sharp turns and Draco was good at stealth...Each had their skills that made them unique, but still fun.  Ron got back to Hogwarts using Harry’s cloak, promising to return it after class the next day.
Harry was happy for them, they seemed so much more alive when they were together.  Not just happier, but more free.  They chatted about the upcoming defense club meeting later that evening, and about some of the strategy Ron and Harry had discussed earlier.  Hermione weighed in and agreed with Ron, which was no big surprise to Harry.
Harry looked around, noting the faces of those who were straining to hear the conversation, and the consternation on some faces.
“Mmmrmph.” Harry was trying to say something, but his breathing was cut off...
His father was also known for his temper.  Poor Harry had triggered that when he freed Dobby… His father was already stressing out about how to keep things under wraps when the incident occurred.  Draco had been on the receiving end of that anger before.  His father said he had only meant to scare Harry, not actually kill him, but Dobby protected him.  For which Draco was now grateful.  And even with all that, what had Harry done for his family?  Something big, and far reaching.  Harry had mentioned something about his love life path.  And Draco pondered that a moment.  His soul still burned from their connection, but just the thought of Harry with someone else did not sit well with him.
“Thank you,” Harry replied with a sigh.
“I’ll do it.” Severus said, grudgingly.
Harry started to get nervous the closer the date of Arthur's attack approached.  When Harry had finally found the perfect combination of charms, he couldn’t wait for Dumbledore and Severus to help him test it full scale.  He had hugged Draco wanting to share this unspoken moment with him.  Harry let the calming scent of Draco wash over him, seeping into his body and wash away his stress.  Draco did not press for more than he offered, and that made Harry’s heart grow.  Harry knew there was no turning back now, he was falling fast for this friend, this savior of his sanity.  Just holding Draco seemed to wash away the world that seemed to be crashing further in on him.  He knew that to the world, Harry Potter would always be more, more than a boy, more than a man, more than a wizard.  But here, in the arms of his own savior, he was just Harry, nothing more.
Hermione’s grin was almost feral. He always knew she had an inner cat or something, her claws might be small but they were sharp. She whirled around and left the classroom in a hurry...He regretted it already, but he knew that another part of his life was unfolding as it should.
“When are you going to ask him?” She asked.
Severus Snape was in awe, he had been enveloped in blinding pink light and a loud persistent sound was starting to blossom inside his head forcing his focus to diminish, and as quickly as it started it stopped.  No one had ever successfully blocked his Cruciatus before...No one.
Harry picked up his mirror and called out to Sirius.
“Delores?” She was almost afraid to bring up the subject.  She had been with the woman many times since her arrival and the change was otherworldly.  She hardly knew the woman. Delores was kind, sweet and nurturing, a far cry from what she had been.
Severus was not prepared for the hand to come out of the fire and grabbed his collar.  Before he knew what was what, he was falling on top of Black back in Grimmauld place, and found a pair of lips searching for his own.  They found his quickly and all reason and logic on how this couldn’t work was swiped out of his head.  Snape was locked to this man beneath him, strong arms holding him down while the mutt plundered his mouth, and he relaxed and gave in to the explosive pleasure washing over him.
Harry could not move, afraid Draco would stop if he moved. His breath was stolen when Draco licked his entrance, his voice was not his to control.  When Draco speared him with his tongue, Harry saw stars… He wanted Draco to fill him tonight… needed His savior to be with him…
“A few months?” Narcissa asked, shocked.
“Get lost, mutt.  I have an appointment.  Unlike you I have obligations to attend.” Severus sneered back at Sirius.  He moved out of the mutt’s presence and swiftly flooed back to his office.
“You feel tense, why?” the words whispered over his ear, electrifying his skin and blood.
Madam Pomfrey bustled out of her office when Severus burst in.
Ron nodded and they left.
They flew to the top and Harry again closed the entrance.  They walked silently out of the first floor, and then Harry took them higher.  He had planned this day, and it would be perfect if he could help. Harry stopped short. Draco, who was still musing in his head, ran right into the back of him.
Harry groaned at the look in Draco’s eyes as he spoke, the molten mercury stole his breath.  Parseltongue turned Draco on… Harry needed to remember that.
“He said no,” Draco stated with a bit of anger.
Harry waited for most of the students to stream out of the Great Hall and managed to fall in with the crowd unnoticed. He broke away to go towards the dungeons and his detention with Professor Snape.
Harry stared at Ron for a moment...then burst out laughing… “You are actually asking my blessing?”
Quicker than he was expecting the reply came.  Draco’s whole body shook with the reply.  Images that had nothing to do with potions and his mother filled his mind and he shivered.  Harry could not possibly go that far, could he?  Not, Harry… Wait when did he become Harry?  After you just fantasized about dropping to your knees for him. Draco shook his head… No Harry just meant to humiliate him, but at least in private.  Draco looked over the reply one last time and shivered again.
“No hinting, I already got your present.” Sirius replied sounding relieved.
“Bedroom is up the stairs, two doors on the right.  Be naked and kneeling on the bed when I get there.” Harry let go and gave Draco a slight push.
“I didn’t plan to enjoy it,” he said, his lashes drifting down so he didn’t have to see those searching eyes.
Dumbledore looked down then, “You know more than you’re willing to say, that I gather. But talk to someone if it gets too much, Harry.  You deserve that at least. Vision or not, don’t get pulled into a past that is about to be re-written and stuck on a tragedy that may not occur again.”
At the two hour mark, Harry stood to wait.  The sight that appeared with a crack made him groan out in pleasure.  Draco smelled so delicious and looked ready to be fucked.  The silver eyes that met his own seemed to hold the same desire he had been feeling for hours now.  He waited. Needing to hear the words from that sinful mouth.
“Please…” Draco stalled eyeing Harry’s trousers, he licked his lips and then looked up into shining emerald eyes, “I need you.”
Draco wanted to shriek and cuss and throw things.  The man was going to drive him crazy.  He knew he was the only person qualified enough for this potion.  He knew Draco had chosen him because he was the best.  But still, he refused to help!
“First”, Harry looked at Ron, “I need to talk to your dad if you can arrange it within the next few weeks, and time is of the essence on this one.” Ron nodded, “I’ll firecall him in the morning.”
She looked at him aghast at his suggestion. Harry was just a boy… well, he used to be… stupid freak was now more freakish…
“It’s Harry… and I am not, but you know who might be...We need to talk.” Harry replied back.
The High Inquisitor, Madam Bones, had made some changes within Hogwarts, for the better he supposed. The Divination classes had been divided up after Firenze had been acquired to teach. Trelawny was agitated to share her classes, but Harry had calmed her. Letting her know that opening the minds of the children to other avenues would earn more respect for the entire area of expertise. Of course, she still maintained being disgruntled, but it was softer and less vocal… She also suggested that other professors consider the desk charm Harry applied in his classroom.  The rules for the dress code were enforced, as was the behavior policy.  Fewer tricks and pranks were becoming the norm.  The Headmaster had been very accepting of the ideas, though the Minister made his voice clear against the appointment of the centaur. His messages to Madam Bones did not go unnoticed, long ones dropped in front of her during lunch and she moved them quietly to the left of her plate and continued eating.
Harry had to wait until after dinner to attend his detention.
“Stay safe Mr. Weasley,” Harry said, touching Arthur’s arm briefly. Mr. Weasley nodded and then left. “Use a monitoring charm on him, Sir, that way you can be alerted if he is wounded.” Harry said, pain reflected in his eyes, and Dumbledore patted his shoulder.
Severus turned those words over in his head.  So the boy knew, of Lily, of his past, of his future.  He regretted the boy witnessing his death that could not have been easy for anyone.  Especially with the horrific detail that he had been shown from the memory.  He too knew what it was to look for that paternal affection.  He had first sought that in the Dark Lord, only to be betrayed, and then found what he could in Albus Dumbledore.  That man had saved him in more ways than one.  It was not an affectionate relationship, but it was not toxic.  To see himself through the eyes of Harry thought, that was difficult.  He had measured himself so little because of his past and misdeeds.  But even knowing everything, the boy had come to regard him with a healthy affection.  This he might be able to bear as long as public displays were not involved.  As far as finding his own happiness, that remained to be seen.  Lily had been his only love, he was not sure anyone would be willing to share his blackened heart.
His voice called out each power and the sound vibrated against the walls.  Each time he traced a rune he switched arms to let each one flow to the tip of his fingers.
He let down the impervious privacy charm, “For those of you in Gryffindor, who wish to learn appropriate Defense skills, we will be forming a ‘club’. I am not sure how the teachers will react, but it will be beneficial, for you in the future. Any who are interested can owl me, not speak here. I will notify all who wish to participate individually.”
“Take it out.” Harry ground out no letting go of the blond hair, “You will do exactly as I say, understood.”
“Yes, sir, I’ll just need a moment to clear my head.” Harry replied.
“Evidently while in Divination, I had a vision.” Hermione coughed, “Not a Voldemort vision, a real one. I lived over 20 years of my life in that vision. All of it happened to me in the span of what now looks to be just a class. I have confirmed some of it with the Headmaster, leaving me to believe that it is a real vision, but a rare one. The headmaster said he never heard of an ordinary wizard living through a vision, or of it lasting as long as mine, they only got specific events at specific times, or prophesies that needed to be deciphered. So, while I know the events of the next 20 years, I will only intervene when I need to, and only disclose information I feel will get us where we need to be. I won’t relive the pain and agony, nor will I let others sacrifice themselves for me. Unexpectedly, I have maintained my training, my knowledge, and my increased power and abilities.” Harry ended his little speech, looking at each of his friends who had wide eyes.
Harry looked at Draco intensely, he knew there was something there, but the time to explore that option was limited.  He wanted to understand, to see where the ‘meant to be’ would lead.  His own soul sang as his friendship with Draco grew.  But he merely nodded, and gestured for them all to leave.
“I don’t know. But either way I’ll get through it with both of you as always.” Harry said as he smiled at his best friend.
“You know Draco Malfoy was attacked last night?” The Headmaster queried.
Draco looked down and then back at Harry, “Yes” his voice was confident.  He felt in his bones the trust he had.
“No, I want to feel you there for days,” Draco replied with a soft sigh.
Draco slid his hands up to grip Harry’s cock with both his hands.
Harry needed to get them somewhere private and comfortable. He knew one of the classrooms would be good enough, and he could transfigure anything he needed to be comfortable there.  They entered a dark room, which smelled as if it hadn’t seen use in years. Harry started casting privacy charms and transfigured some of the desks into furniture, two chairs, a bed, and a table.
“I will not disclose everything now, sir, if you don’t mind, as I am unsure what to share. I will ask one thing of you that will help me verify what I lived through and help me understand where to go from here. There is a prophecy that was spoken, Voldemort marked me, and the reason neither can live while the other survives is because Voldemort made several Horcruxes with which he is able to continue to live on. Is that true, or a false trail left by my vision?” Harry asked, his eyes intent and searching.
“I’ll take that into consideration, Mr. Potter. I am not used to taking teaching advice from a student.” Severus quipped.
They made their plans, and then Sanguini departed via the floo.  Harry and Albus decided to discuss plans for the upcoming Privet Drive event.  Harry wanted to take up the discussion with Ron, later that evening to iron out the particulars.  They would hold an Order meeting that Saturday to discuss the final details.
Harry sighed, at least there was no danger to Mr. Malfoy at this time.  He would have to monitor his link with Voldemort just in case.
His angel cleansed his soul with a handshake, and captured his heart with a kiss.
“Harry of course, convinced me of your sincerity.” Severus stated, “Plus he invited me to join the family.” His face contained a sneer, his voice snark, and his eyes a challenge.
“Your pup has arrived to bother us… Take your time… I’ll keep him busy until you are ready. Unless you want to sleep.” Severus whispered on the return grunt he received. He moved to his wardrobe and dressed quickly, used his wand to straighten everything to perfection.
Harry explained the entirety of the meeting to Sirius, including the role of Draco. He blushed as he talked about Draco, not revealing their intimate contact... Evidently Sirius saw it, his mouth twitched into a slight grin.
“First, I’m sure you have done your own digging, and by now know the meaning of the vision, to mark me as the next Augur,” Harry insinuated, only to have Dumbledore give him a knowing smile, “Second, I need your help in devising a plan on how to keep the Malfoy family safe, but playable in the events that need to unfold.  Lastly, since the curriculum for defense this year for most students is severely lacking, Hermione and I have devised a way for me to teach only invited students how to properly defend themselves.” Harry reached into his robes and pulled out a few papers.
Harry had written down the complexities of the charm and was looking into potion ingredients that could mimic the charm. Once he had those, he could work on prolonging the effects.  A quick tapping on his window brought him out of the focus his research had put him in.  A sleek black owl stood at the window waiting to be let in.  Harry got up and walked to the window.  He opened it and the bird flew to a perch he had in the Library. Harry had long ago dropped the Fidelis charm on the house, and only put up simple wards.  He felt there was no longer a need for intense defenses.
“It’s in the school I take it.” Severus asked, trying to hide his concern.
“He was the reason I was late in my second year. He tried to get me expelled…” Harry said with a smile of recollection.
“What did you say to that mongrel you call godfather?” He asked, his tone clipped and accusing. His eyes boring into Harry.
“I heard a Vampire has accepted your offer to speak to your sixth years.  I am impressed.” She stated, notebook clutched to her chest.
“In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them.... I destroy them.”
“Mr. Potter. What are you running from?”
“Sir, I need to start with what year is it, as obviously I am a bit confused.” Harry inquired.
Harry thrust one more time only to collapse down on to the bed next to his lover... For once... he was broken, he was alive and he was Harry.
Draco pocketed the note, though loath to leave his solitude, he made his way back to the castle.  He wasn’t really prepared for what was to come, but he knew if he allowed himself this luxury of discarding his mask, it would be worth it.  Plus, once his family knew about the coin’s choice, they would be ecstatic.  His mother was always a hopeless romantic at heart.  If anything he may have gotten that from her.  Draco felt unease pass through him, he was closer to the Dungeons.  Giving the password he entered easily.  The common room still held that gloomy glow he had grown accustomed to.  Crabbe was dozing on a couch by the fireplace, and Goyle was eating some kids snack from off one of the tables.  Draco said nothing as he moved along the staircase, up towards his room.  He laid down on the bed and just relaxed.  He noted the color of the hangings were just as brilliant green as Harry’s eyes.  And that though made the heat rise in his veins once again, the ebb and flow of his blood taking it to places Draco had not yet felt.
Harry wanted more. He needed more. One hand lifted to cup Draco’s face, as his body relaxed against the wall.  Those lips parted as his fingers stroked the petal-soft skin of pale cheeks.  Harry took that as an invitation.  His hand waved to provide the privacy of a quick wandless disillusionment charm, and he dove in.  Harry tasted all of Draco’s mouth, it was extraordinary, heaven.  He could drown on the taste of Draco, lemon and sugar.  His hand glided into that silky hair, holding on, changing the angle so he could drink in Draco’s kiss from all sides.
Hermione smiled at him, “Of course.”
“Hey, just trying to lighten the mood.” Harry tried to concede.
“If you want them to come, I’ll do my best to accept them cordially.” Sirius offered.
“Did you know Professor Snape doesn’t go anywhere for the Holidays.  I have been working with him a lot, I think he could use some happy company, do you think you could act appropriately if I invited him over?” Harry tried to contain his glee at the spark in Sirius’ eye when he spoke the Professor’s name.   He knew Sirius was struggling with the right words to answer, so not to give away too much.
“Thank you both for your help.” Harry offered.  He turned towards the webbing as they departed, and delicately levitated it off the arch.  He then folded it into a small block and then shrunk it.  He banished the arch with a grim face.  He would succeed...
Draco was thrown off by the movement and he was very curious.
“Why?  You will never be Harry.  Be Ron… He can never be you, just as he could never be me.  We are all different.  He comes to you for things he can’t do… think about that.  Be the best Ron… and let Harry be Harry.” Draco said, watching the redhead seem to grasp the concept.
Harry left his research after Draco’s reply came.  The plea tugged at something dark within Harry… He needed more than mere words.  Words were easy.  He needed to see those silver eyes pleading with him.  His groin tightened as more images passed through his mind as he penned his reply.  His heart beat faster as after he sent it.  He wasn’t sure Draco would do it, but in the off chance the man surrendered his pride, he would be waiting.
Those coins were treasured objects.  Most often they were given to lovers for safe haven, and in most cases, save for one, kept within the family after the marriage.  That was actually how Narcissa came into possession of one.  Lucius had given her one after he fell in love with her after their school years.  It was for emergencies, but Narcissa had been curious.  During a long absence, which Lucius had to go and do business for his father in Albania, She used the coin.  And it dropped her right in the middle of Lucius’ bed chamber at one of the Albanian Malfoy properties.  He was upset, but they were both ecstatic to see they were meant to be together.  That event led to the proposal, eventual marriage and well everything else.
“Pluck up the courage and snag Ron early, you will save some heartache for both of you if you do, otherwise it will be another couple of years, before he makes the first move.” Harry said, waiting for the shock to register on her face. She went beet red, then started to speak but said nothing. “Think about it, okay. Trust me.” Harry spoke ever so softly.
“I’m friends with Draco now.” Harry said, waiting for that to sink in.
Harry hauled Draco up out of the wet tub and pushed him towards the bed, only to push Draco face-first into the mattress.
“Well, Ron won’t like it… he’s a hard enough time with the friends bit.” Hermione spoke quietly, but with some steel lining her voice, “I don’t like it, friends is one thing, but this…” She broke off… “Can we trust him?  I’m not sure about Ron, but I still have doubts.”
“Well it’s Hermione...she’s my best friend...well besides you too of course,” Harry nodded with a smile and Ron continued, “I like her like that and all, but I don’t want to mess up all of our friendships...will it be too weird if I say yes?”
Harry breathed hard and tried to detach when his power showed her more than he had wanted.  He clawed for control, only to be soothed by his own power.  He finally let it go… His past laid bare, his soul displaying things he had hidden for so long...‘Take us where you will’ Harry thought.  When his power finally receded, she sat back tears streaming down her face.  He sat once more on a perfectly plump chair regaining control of his own emotions… He did what he always had done… Shoved memories and unwanted emotions inside a chest in his mind, hoping to not examine them again until far in the future.
Once everyone had arrived, Harry formed them into groups.  Paring himself with Draco, Hermione with Ron, Ginny with Dean, and a few others he thought would work well together.  He wanted to pair them according to their strengths and weaknesses for this first session.
“He created seven, you do not need Professor Slughorn’s memory any longer.” Harry said, there was a deflated sigh at the end of it. “So I am to re-live the events of the last 21 years all over again.”
Mr. Weasley looked up at Harry and smiled.  Mrs. Weasley ran to Harry and smothered him in one of her hugs as she cried her thanks out to him.
“So do you want to meet when you are done with your important task?” Draco asked quietly when they were in the atrium just outside the doors the Great Hall.
The runes died down to dark black once more. His eyes did not change...His hands swirled and the wind blew in and around the office, from nowhere…  he rolled his hands together and clouds started to form with the thunder above her, she was frightened now, as she saw the storms flash above her.  His foot fell softly, yet she felt the tremor under her feet. She backed up further.
It was not a soft plea, this was a plea from the soul. Draco knew if he disobeyed, the consequences would be tremendous and Harry would break. Usually, Draco would plead his case for independence, he would fight to stay uncaged. But after the last time… he knew there was no way he could be alone… His hand came over Harry’s arm, soft and warm.
“You are my everything, from now until the end my sweet savior,” Harry spoke, his voice sweet and full of love. He changed their positions to hover just above Draco on the couch, and kissed his husband quickly before moving over to the other side to get up.
“Why was this developed?” Severus asked, very curious.
“Only one, and he seemed a bit off with his aim, but he dodged a good right number of my spells well enough.  Lucius Malfoy… Curious about his aim, don’t you think?” Mr. Weasley asked quietly.
“I call it the Delayed Repercussion potion. It was developed by myself about 10 years from now. I will show you how to brew it if you like. It is applied to any item touched by dark magic, and delay the owner or creator from knowing it is lost or destroyed, until 1 year from the date of destruction or loss. I’ll tell you more later.” Harry said.
“I don’t remember the spell, Harry.” Draco called, his hand reaching to stroke around Harry’s entrance.
Harry smiled darkly, as if he knew the obsessive need.  He slowly stood back, turned towards another door and flicked his wrist.  The sound of gushing water filled the silent room.  Harry turned towards the sound and entered the bath, slowly letting his jacket fall, and then the blue ash-filled shirt.  Draco followed and took his time disrobing as well.
Most of those replied affirmative, but he did have to repeat himself once on the notes portion of his instruction to one other student who did not understand.
“Waiting for news on a small project.  What are you doing?” Harry replied, turning his head to look at Draco.  Bad idea if he wanted to keep his focus and calm.
Harry’s classes had surprised him. The younger years had brilliant responses to his query. Sure there were some who needed help with their connection of logic, but all in all, they were good. His older years used a lot of the same spell and scenarios. He decided to repeat the assignment once a month. This way every student would be thinking about what they could use around them for defense. Harry’s plans for February was to start working on Magical creatures and beings. Dementors specifically for the 7th years, Vampires for 6th, Werewolves for 5th year, Goblins for 4th year, Trolls for 3rd, Giants for 2nd and Pixies for 1st. Each year will spend the entire month studying the creatures, defining their strengths and weaknesses and learn the art of dealing defensively with each one.  They would also learn the culture for those that were beings and how to interact. He had procured pixies for interaction with his first years, Remus had accepted to speak to his 5th years, Griphook grudgingly agreed with a bribe of a goblin blade to talk, Hagrid would discuss giants, but Harry still needed to find speakers for the other beings. Harry would cover the dementors himself, He just needed to talk to Dumbledore about getting a Vampire or an expert on one to speak. He knew a troll in the trade from his dealings at Christmas, so he would see if Heidegger would speak with his students...Intelligent Trolls were rare, but it would be worth it.
Harry pushed Draco up against the door they had just entered.  Draco felt the adrenaline rush through his body and the blood rush south.
“Oh well before a month ago, he was a complete disaster… Now you have an almost master on your hands, good luck.” Hermione said with a grin, as she swiftly left to join Greg, who just expectantly looked back to Draco.
Just before they reached the Gargoyle, she turned on him.
“She’s good at it Greg, just follow her instructions like you do me, and your potion will do fine.” Draco said soothingly.  Hermione patted Greg’s arm for reassurance, but Draco’s words seemed all that was needed.
“Any idea what we will be brewing today?” Draco asked, trying to be as nonchalant as possible.
“Well, until I hear from the Malfoy’s there really is nothing further to discuss.  Once we have that, you may need to convene an Order meeting so we can discuss the particulars once we are at liberty to do so.” Harry stated.
“Very well, I will try my best. But do not expect favoritism Mr. Potter in class, everyone will be miserable.” Severus said, a slight quirk of a smile on his lips.
Draco licked a particularly soft muscle outline, letting the salt and spice of Harry compliment the scent of wild earth.  His hands reached around the front, letting his fingers slide against skin and hair, rough and hot.  Draco started to let himself go lower tasting Harry’s lower back, dropping soft kisses and taking some of Harry’s muscles in his mouth and running his tongue over the skin, letting go to leave a dark coloration.
Harry turned to face her directly.  His face sobered as he spoke, “I am not Voldemort,” She flinched, “I do not command, I will not force people to do my bidding.  I offer advice, and sense.  I offer my friendship to those who need it, or want it.  So, it’s a simple question, with no strings or consequences.  Care to walk with me?” Harry asked again softening his tone, and gestured to the empty space beside him.
Harry tried to convey what he felt, “My life was almost normal... after this,” his finger traced Draco’s parted lips, “normal will never be enough.”
“I understand the holidays are approaching, and I want to confer with my godfather, if he is obliging, I would like to invite you all to be able to be together for at least Christmas at our home, with us.” Harry smiled looking at Lucius, then directly at Draco’s gaze, warming instantly to the responding emotions he found there.
“I could learn to love a Malfoy,” Harry stated.
Dumbledore was impressed, the intricacy and focus needed to imbue each thread would have been painstaking.  Severus was thinking along the same lines but was more impressed that the boy accomplished the feat in only two and a half weeks with all his classes, and defense club meetings.  Further inspection showed him that Harry was hiding his own tiredness from those around him, the strain was evident if one knew where to look.
After Harry left, Snape decided to firecal the mutt and accept the offered apology.  Only for Harry’s sake though, nothing else.  The mutt appeared, and his smile grew.  “To what do I owe the honor of your call, Severus?” Sirius asked, kindly and a bit too huskily for Severus’ taste, did the mutt have company. Something in his gut twisted at the thought, but he pushed the feeling away.
“Tonight we will build the good memory bricks into your wall, these ones will be added intermittently to the neutral ones. Both neutral memories and good memories are the easiest to place, and the easiest to control access to as they give us the most positive power.  So we will start with those.  The bad memories are reserved for last.  They are the ones most often used by the enemy for destruction.  Those require more care and must be placed properly to harness the will power that runs through them.” Harry instructed.
“I’ve made a decision for the solo,” McGonagall says, pausing for dramatic effect.
Harry shakes her head and steps further into the bathroom. “I–”
To ensure that I don’t get caught, there’s several things I need to do. At the top of that list is disposing of the body and disguising myself. I am very recognizable in this area, by virtue of Petunia’s gossip-mongering, and I will surely be wanted for questioning as soon as the still-bloody scene of the crime is discovered. By far the easier of the two propositions is disguising myself, so I focus my attention on planning what I’ll do.
Then Draco pauses, looking over at me again. “I’m very glad I decided to stop by here today.”
“Want to go?” I ask.
“Of course I’m sure. You’re letting me stay here aren’t you? Really,” she says, grabbing her purse, “I ought to be helping you pay for the room.”
Then she circles around and repeats the approach and rebuff for a final time, ending at the opposite side of the circle from where she had begun.
“Here you are,” Draco says, releasing my hand. “I think I’ll go get my own room, now.”
“Why, did you want to gloat?” Daphne asks scathingly.
The teenager wordlessly points off into the shelves.
“No, no,” says Draco, shaking her head. “It was my pleasure.”
I settle down in the chair next to Draco and dig into the food. While we eat, we sit together in companionable silence as we watch the terrible sitcom on one of the three channels the TV in the motel gets.
I consider her for a moment as I weigh my discomfort with being dirty against my reluctance to take further advantage of her generosity. Then I remember that I have not showered since I– since I left the Dursleys. So I nod.
is looking for. Draco is so much better than I could ever be, but here she is, saying that I am the one that she has been looking for.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry knows its petty of her to care at all what Malfoy says, but all the snipes that Malfoy has been aiming at her over the past several weeks have been increasingly aggravating, and Harry is nearing her breaking point.
Harry is now running through her routine backstage for Ron and Ginny. The way her body mindlessly flows from one move to the other makes it clear that all the practice was worth it.
My own heart stops and I hear myself say, “Yes,” before I can think better of it. Lately, I’ve been doing a lot of things without thinking, but I can’t bring myself to regret this one time.
As Harry shoves down her annoyance with Malfoy, she snaps her arms out, twirling around to face the audience, her head coming up, bold.
“What’s this?” she says softly, reaching out to stroke my neck with feather-soft fingers.
I check the view in my rear-view mirror, feeling as though there ought to be people pursuing me. It’s a ridiculous thought of course, it hasn’t been long enough for anyone to have discovered anything amiss. I still have a couple hours of grace before I really have to worry about pursuit—probably longer, actually, because I’m on the run. That is, so long as I don’t give anyone an excuse to look in the trunk of the car. The car that I’ve stolen from Vernon.
Then once I’m done, I get up and grab the things I bought from the corner convenience store. I say to Draco, “I’m going to go shower.”
Harry hopes that she never has to see Malfoy again.
She does, and when I read out the name of the town closest to where she pointed, she says, “I’ve never been there before.”
“Well?” Ron interjects.
thank you all for reading! please don't forget to leave a comment below letting me know what you thought! and heads up: my writing tumblr is
a best friend and she certainly doesn’t need a new one that trash talks her actual best friend. Harry shoves her hands into her pockets. “I think I can make my own friends. Thanks anyways.”
. So, by extension, I do too. We can go wherever you like, so long as we’re together.”
I nod in agreement, then realize she can’t see the motion. I laugh at my own foolishness, then say, “We should.”
Now is not the time for crying, because it would just redden my eyes, making me more conspicuous, which is the last thing I want.
“You poor dear!” Draco exclaims. She sticks her head out of the bathroom, looking around for me.
she is of Malfoy trying to ruin things. “Only two more years,” Harry mutters. “Then we’ll graduate and I’ll never have to see her again.”
After that, I had gone back to my apartment and sat at my kitchen table, just to think. I had learned the hard way that, because I was a woman, I would not be able to advance to the top of a company the way I ought to be able to.
to belong with. And I think I’ve found her.”
When Harry makes it to the bathroom she opens the door, and the first thing she hears is the sound of the sink running.
I pause as reality comes crashing back in. Today I need to run again. I have to stay moving. If I don’t, I’ll surely be caught.
Harry steps around the corner and sees Malfoy standing at the sink, her hands held under the stream of water.
Draco’s hand squeezes my knee. “Of course I would, because I’ve been looking for you, Harry. I have been looking for a long time. So I want to go where you go.”
I discover that I’ve mirrored her pleasant smile without thinking, and so I now let it slide from my face. Draco doesn’t seem like she’s dangerous, but I am simply too tired to stand around here chatting. So I say, with a little regret, “I was just about to go take a nap because I’d been driving all night.”
“You could try starting at the beginning,” I suggest.
“Fuck,” Harry mutters to herself. She’d been hoping to manage another run through before they went onstage.
“I love you, too,” I say confidently. I am a woman who knows what she wants, and now I have her.
Harry can tell that Malfoy thinks this was supposed to be clever, but really Malfoy just sounds so
? I’ve never danced before! We could’ve done something like swim.”
“And if we don’t find it there, then we’ll just have to keep looking,” Draco reassuringly. “And until then, we’ll have each other.”
“That’s perfectly alright,” Draco says. “We can just pick a direction and continue to drive. There’s also a map in the glovebox if you’d like to pick a destination.”
Harry lowers her brow and rolls her eyes. Harry already
She hurries out to the main room. I shake my hair out again while I wait for her to return.
“Oh, you must be tired,” Draco says kindly. “Please, let me walk you to your room.”
This shower is much nicer than the one I’d taken the night before. I feel much cleaner now, and when I survey myself in the bathroom mirror after I’ve gotten dressed, I am happier with my appearance than I have been in ages.
I think I know what she’ll say if I offer to pay, so I mentally add a couple more dollars to the amount I’m planning to slip into her things. Reaching over, I pick up a bottle.
I realize, then, that it’s probably because now that I’ve had company, being alone sounds entirely unappealing. Draco is so bright that it’s hard to wallow in darkness when I’m in her presence, and if she’s going to stay at the motel anyways, it just makes sense for her to stay with me.
I can feel Draco’s heart rate increase against my back. She takes a deep breath. “Would you like to wander together?”
I fumble with the key to my room and jam it into the lock as I say, “Nonsense, just stay with me. I’m just going to be sleeping right now, anyways, so you’ll have the room to yourself.” A beat later, I clarify, “I sleep like the dead, so you won’t have to worry about waking me.”
She is still holding the pride of successfully completing the most difficult part of her solo close to her chest as she moves into the finale of the performance.
They are already the best of friends, though they have only known each other since the beginning of the school year. In September they had tried out for field hockey together, and though Harry had made the team and Ron hadn’t, they’d stayed friends.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dance with me,” she says.
Harry moves to the front of the stage and flows into the most important part of her solo. It’s a flurry of motion meant to represent the uncertainty and rejection of the part she had just finished. And despite the emotions she’s portraying, her chest swells with pride as she lands each move perfectly.
As she finishes, her friends burst into applause. She grins.
“Can’t– breathe–,” Harry says.
I blame my exhaustion for what I say next. “Why don’t you just stay with me?”
I open the wallet with trembling hands, and I nearly cry with relief when I realize that there’s a considerable amount of cash in it. I had been so panicked when I’d run that I hadn’t even thought to bring money. I am so relieved that a problem I had entirely neglected previously was now solved that I am hard-pressed not to start crying.
“Goodbye, forever,” I’d said. Then I had whirled around and walked out of his office. I had stopped at my desk just long enough to collect my purse and my coat, and then I’d left the office without looking back.
Harry frowns and shakes her head, then says, “No, that’s more Malfoy’s style. I was just wondering where she’d gone.”
“Do you know if there’s a car dealership around?” I say. “We certainly don’t need two cars to wander together.” At this, I finally turn around to face her, still not letting go of her hand.
“Alright,” I say, honestly a little grateful to have someone help me find it. The motel is small, but I’m exhausted. “It’s room 110,” I tell her.
Once I’m far enough away from the road, I begin to look for an appropriately muddy spot to dump the body in. After a few more minutes of searching, I find the perfect little pond. I roll his body into it and it disappears completely. I wipe my sweaty palms on my ragged trousers and turn my back on the pond, walking back to the car.
“How was that?” Harry asks, after she catches her breath.
Her mouth opens immediately. I decide that it is an invitation, and slide my tongue into her mouth.
Ron reaches over and squeezes Harry’s forearm reassuringly. Harry glances over at her best friend with gratitude in her eyes.
anything, I’m running
Harry has to do her best to keep her mind on the performance, because the dance isn’t quite over yet, but it’s hard to when there is something about the applause that hits differently, deeper, now when Harry knows it is for
She shifts and turns away from me slightly. Somehow, I restrain the impulse to reach out and comfort her, because, despite our closeness, this feels like something important, and therefore something I ought to let her say without interruption.
Malfoy rolls her eyes dramatically, then makes eye contact with Harry again. Harry feels one of her eyebrows raise slightly without even thinking about it, and she decides to wait for whatever Malfoy is going to say next. Harry can always roast her ass after whatever she says next, after all.
I lose track of time as we sit there on the motel bed, going back and forth between her mouth and mine.
When Harry feels the presence of bodies behind her and knows that the rest of the troupe has closed their ranks like they are supposed to, Harry comes to a halt.
Ron nods and says, “You nailed it!”
Harry jumps when McGonagall, who has appeared out of nowhere, says, “I’d have to be blind not to see what, Ms Weasley?”
It’s a fake name, but it’s a combination of what I’ve thought would be a nice name and my mother’s maiden name, so I ought to respond to it as I should.
“But–” I start to say.
The next day, I’d packed up all the belongings I would need for a life on the road and piled everything into my car. That day, I set off, out of the city and into the countryside. Looking for companionship, for someone to run away with. Someone to spend my life with.
There’s not much I can do for the color of my hair till I find somewhere to buy hair dye, but I think that restyling my hair will do a lot to throw people off. To this end, I pull over to the side of the road and turn on the interior light of the car.
As I’m walking back to the front to pay, I pass the rest of the hair care supplies that the store carries. My eye is caught by the hair-cutting scissors. I dither for a moment, then pull them off the shelf as well. If I’m going to disguise myself, I may as well do it right.
We don’t wander for the same reasons, but I still say, “Yeah, I guess I am.”
is laughable.
We switch off the television and turn on the radio.
Then Draco says, out of the blue, “I should tell you something. About my wanderings. I do have– did have– a goal for them.”
I had finished university a couple years before others my age were scheduled to by virtue of my sheer determination to make something of myself. Then, with my degree, I was easily hired as a secretary to some important bigshot at some important firm, and I had planned to use the position as a leaping point to achieve the position I truly wanted.
to wander anymore,” I say.
I walk up to her and say, “Excuse me.”
I am still wearing the rags that are the only clothing I’ve ever been given, and my messy, dark hair is recognizable from a mile away, so these are two things I ought to do away with first.
is. With hair that red and gear that cheap, you must be a Weasley.”
. “You think you’re so
Draco glances over at me with such an inscrutable expression that I worry that I’ve overstepped. “You are the person,” she says.
“Take the key and lock the door behind you, please,” I tell her. Then I collapse onto the bed, fully clothed and without washing my face.
“I was looking for somewhere to belong, for some
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s something peaceful about driving off alone into the night.
“Goodnight, Draco,” I whisper back.
And then Harry’s placing her hand on the back of my neck, drawing me in closer to her, and I obligingly follow her direction. Our lips meet, and this time I’m the one to part my lips for her.
for being my beta!
The girl comes to a halt right in front of Harry and Ron, and says, “My name is Draco. Draco Malfoy.”
It’s only been an hour or two since it happened, since I killed Vernon and stole his car. He had it coming, but now I am running away from the repercussions of my actions. Even through my mingled satisfaction and guilt at killing Vernon, I am angry. Because Vernon had gotten away with stealing my childhood and would probably have gotten away with hurting and possibly killing me today.
I feel the first pang of guilt as I make my way over to sit with her. She’s so kind and I am a murderer. I shake the guilt off quickly, though, because Vernon had well and truly deserved what he’d gotten. I rub at the bruising I’m sure must be visible on my neck and go to awkwardly hover by the food.
The music comes to a sudden halt, cueing Harry to release her breath and run to her starting point on stage. She slides between Colin and Daphne, as she’s supposed to. The troupe is arrayed in a semicircle, and Harry comes to a halt with her back to the audience– and the judges– so that she’s facing the midpoint of the semicircle– as though she’s a conductor of an orchestra.
McGonagall’s vote of confidence only serves to strain Harry’s nerves further, despite the intention. She stares blankly at McGonagall’s retreating back.
I glance over at her curiously, but she’s just looking forward at the road, both her hands resting at 10 and 2 on the steering wheel. “Oh?” I say.
Ron releases the hug and says, “Right, sorry. But you did it!”
I climb back into the car and set off again, ready to drive until morning. The shops will be open then, and I will be able to acquire some dye for my hair, and perhaps some less conspicuous clothing. Because although this area is rural, and therefore far from well off, the rags that the Dursleys had forced me to wear are so deteriorated that I stand out wherever I go.
you.”
“Are we ready to go?” she asks.
Harry nods. She has been trying really hard to fix that, but it’s hard when all her extra practice at home is with her parents. As hard as they try, they’re not dancers, and therefore can’t really tell her when she’s messing up, especially when it’s something as fleeting as the timing during one part of the song. “Do you–”
Harry and I are sitting across from each other on the bed in our motel room. We have spent the past few months together simply driving around the countryside and staying in roadside motels.
Every time I start to feel ridiculous, Draco swings me ‘round again, or lifts me into the air, or places her hand just a little too low on my back, and suddenly I can think of nothing but the motion and flow of dancing.
From there it’s smooth sailing to the end of the number, and the next thing Harry knows, she’s taking her final bows with the rest of the group and running offstage.
“We ought to sleep,” Draco says, still a little breathless.
“Yeah, McGonagall would have to be blind not to see that Harry obviously deserves the solo,” Ginny says.
“And you still wanted to wander with me?” Harry asks softly. “Even though you knew I was–am–a murderer?”
Draco sticks her hand out to shake, and I find myself automatically taking it. Her hand is soft and warm, and the shake is firm, but brief.
“Absolutely amazing,” Ron says.
During a brief pause between songs, Draco offers me another drink. I gratefully accept it, downing half of the drink before the next song starts, and then Draco is spinning me into motion again.
“That was amazing!” Ginny says.
(See the end of the chapter for
emotion to the performance. I’m sure there will be a solo better suited to your talents soon.”
Harry thinks she’s seen this girl around, though Harry can’t quite put a name to the face, nor remember anything specific about her.
“Obviously,” Ginny says, “but that doesn’t mean her bleating isn’t fucking annoying.”
I take a moment to process this, then begin to feel agitated. Draco not have a reason to wander anymore, but I certainly do. I am still just as much of a murderer as I was yesterday, and still just as much on the run.
I wonder, as I pass through yet another bog, if ought to just stop the car and tip the body out into one of them. God knows enough people get lost in the swamp every year; one more body probably wouldn’t be that out of the ordinary. I worry for a moment that my strong desire to be rid of Vernon’s body is clouding my judgement, but as I drive for another thirty minutes or so without seeing another soul, I grow more confident that it’s a decent decision.
haha turns out i haven't abandoned this fic after all :D
huge thank you to strwberryblossom for beta'ing!
“I’m very sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you,” she says, smiling. “This is going to sound a bit forward of me, but I saw you, you know, at the gas station. And, well, I was just so intrigued, but then you left before I could come over and say something. I nearly thought that I’d never see you again. But then I saw your car here, almost like it was meant to be.”
