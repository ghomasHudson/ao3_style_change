“Fred and George are always together.  Fred doesn’t haunt a location, like the ghosts of Hogwarts.  He haunts his brother.  Where George goes Fred always follows.”
“This isn’t about Malfoy’s hair!”
“A long black cord with two funny looking ends.”
Rookwood’s face lost its calm facade, it’s pretense of friendliness.  He was cold and hard as he sneered back, “Drop him.”
“I think you’re going to have to tell your father.”
‘Oh’, Draco thought.  His estimation of his own intelligence dropped significantly as he finally put the whole thing together.  Harry had seen them sneaking in.  Maybe because of his elevated view as he hung above his tormentors, or the fact that Rookwood, Dolohov and Draco all had their back turned, or because it was impossible to hide a dragon that size in any bunch of trees … Whatever it was, Harry had seen the Aurors coming, had known they were about to be saved.  He had asked Draco to stand against Rookwood not to save his own skin, but because if he didn’t Draco would find himself caught up in the arrests.
“You!  Good!  Here?!”  Ron yelled.
Ron nodded and cracked a smile.  “I thought you were just supposed to be the band photographer.”
“Don’t you worry Draco we’ll …” Miriam plowed right on but Draco had had enough.
He had been told that the great Harry Potter would be in his class at Hogwarts.  Looking back Draco still wasn't sure if his father had meant the information as encouragement or a warning.  Years later, he could still feel the excitement he had felt then.  The chance to meet Harry Potter, to possibly make a powerful friend who could help him carry the weight that even at eleven he was already feeling.  It was a hope and a dream that even now, all these years later, still held a bittersweet sway on his heart.  His hand reached up towards the heavens, remembering another moment he had reached out in hope.
“I know, right?” Ron agreed.  “And now Draco is really driving Robards round the twist.”
“Well, I’m not doubting you, but if he was here then, he’s not here now.”  Neville said.
“Said something about trying to save Dumbledore,” George added.
“We won’t hold that against you,” Draco said as though that were the issue, but then followed up with “It will be fun,” and tossed him a wink.  “I can do the lead vocals and guitar,” Draco went on.
“A mate of mine, his younger brother disappeared from that area a while ago.  Even though he’s kind of a rebellious kid, it still isn’t like him to just take off.  A group of us are taking some time off to go after him.”
“Why don’t you go find Ms. Lockhart, the ‘Sly’ band tour manager.  Tell her we’re here and say we’re sorry for being late.”
“Naw, I’m good.”  Ron waved him off.  “I wouldn’t want to get between you and your new love.”
Something soft shifted under Harry’s head.  He finally got his eyes to work and he blinked up at the grey eyes that haunted his dreams.
Harry Potter was no longer the little boy that wanted, powerless to do anything about it.  He was the Savior of the Wizarding World, one of the most powerful wizards of his generation.  He had fought a war to protect his friends and avenge the death of his parents.  He had stood against a powerful villain that had caused a two generations to tremble just at the mention of his name.  No, Harry Potter was no longer that weak little boy.
“You sure? You’ll never get a steady shot from down here.”
“Had to know where she was at all times?”
“He says they’ve made some headway, but no real leads yet.  I guess a bunch of the kids that disappeared have been hanging around the same group of malcontents.  You know, anti-government, anti-parents, anti-everything types.  Not all of them, but enough he thinks there is something to it.”
This story would race through the wizarding world like fiendfyre.  Harry would not have wished this on the ghost but had enough experience with Peeves over the years not to allow himself a bit of joy in Fred and George’s revenge.  Even more, he was glad he was here to see the moment for himself.
“Robards will be going on extended leave for a while.  With his injury from the war, we might be able to get him early retirement.”
“You! Good! Here?!” Ron yelled.
Ron cast Harry a questioning look but Harry shook his head.  “I didn’t do so well at the Maze for the Triwizard tournament.  That’s when I lost Cedric.  I hate to say this, but we will probably be ahead to wait and take on the Death Eaters rather than the labyrinth.”
“Alright?”  Harry asked again, louder, squeezing his shoulders again.
Did Draco hear that warm deep voice?  Or perhaps he just knew it so well he did not need to hear it.  His body shook against the trauma of what was being asked of him.  It was so out of character, so far from what he had ever done before.  To lie and threaten and bluff through was his way was his birthright, his heritage as much as Malfoy Manor.
It was ridiculous how happy it made him to hear his name from Draco’s lips.  Shifting a bit nervously in his chair, Harry pushed on.  “Was there something you were going to say… before all of this?”
“Oh,” Harry said and felt his smile grow wider as he settled back against the cushions.  “Yeah, this is good.  I’m remembering.  Riding into Hogwarts was my favorite part of the year.”
It was not a surprise and yet Draco could not help whipping his head around in horror.  One more moment they spent looking at each other across a distance that was about to become eternal.  Harry still did not look afraid.  Then he was gone.
He gathered the tatters of his courage and composure around him.  Then taking a deep breath he turned to Rookwood and said simply, “No.  No I won’t join you.  Not now, not ever.”
“Harry, I’ve been your friend since we were eleven.  You’ve always been obsessed with what he was doing, what he was wearing, the color of his hair … lordy I can’t even count all the times you went off about his hair.  Now that the git has grown it out long you’re going to be impossible to live with.”
Harry eavesdrops and doesn't get caught.
“Robards not only refused to approve my leave, he gives me this bullshit case to go find out how Malfoy is enchanting everyone.”
A count.
“I never thought we’d hear the end of it when Harry and Ginny broke up.”  Ron tossed Harry a wiry smile.  “You were a better man than me, you didn’t hide at all.”
“Yes, absolutely.  Why?  Is he in trouble?”
“Got angry if she was late to a date or two?”
“What?”  Draco stared down at the images in confusion.  He was holding an amazing shot of himself and Pansy.  She was singing, her expression intense and focused; he was dancing and his hair, shimmering in the light, was whipping around his head while his body twisted to the beat.  Draco could almost feel the music coming off the page.  The lighting hid as much of his face as it showed, teasing and revealing, while Pansy was fully lit and magnificent in her fierce defiance of the world.  For a moment, Draco found he could not breath as he stared down at the passion expressed in this one shot.
“Several weeks,” the potions master admitted.  “We don’t stock fully-grown Mandrake root in school for obvious reasons.  I doubt we will find any for sale at a reasonable price either.”
“What do you think of our little lady here?” the man asked, patting the leg of the dragon Draco was still leaning against.
“Well, as happy as I am for you, that still leaves me with an urgent position to fill.”
“Don’t give me that.” Robards shot back, his voice still echoing down the hall.  “They’re Slytherins.  Pampered little rich snobs.  They can’t possibly be good.”
I stand quietly until my instincts to track Robards down and remove his intestines have retreated enough for me to think.
Charlie nodded and both he and Ron moved closer to lend their support.  “That was a tough battle, although as I recall, it was Professor Flitwick that finally took him down.”
Draco was not thinking about Harry Potter.  He was absolutely NOT thinking about Harry Potter.  Why would Harry Potter have a crush on him?  It was ridiculous.  Draco Malfoy, the son of a convicted Death Eater, the man Harry himself had called his arch-enemy, … no, the whole thing was absurd.  He and Harry had never exchanged a civil word in the entire time they had known each other.  Pansy was delusional and Draco was not thinking about this anymore.
The bus had touched down on St. Kilda, an island so far north of Scotland it was almost on the other side of the globe.  The grass beneath the wheels ended in a violent plunge, down hundreds of feet to the ocean crashing below.  The angry ocean was the perfect accompaniment to the horrible torture going on in front of them.
Harry stood there, breathing hard in anger and upset, his broad shoulders rising and falling, the muscles in his arms flexing as his hands clenched and unclenched.
“It’s over,” his best friend said as he walked out of the fireplace.
“Nothing wrong with groupies.  Or bands.”
Pansy had crumbled against the power of the mind that invaded hers.  It ripped through her defenses, pushing its way in and in and in.  Pansy cried out but she could not tell if the sound made it past her lips.
“That is actually very wise,” Harry said.
Nothing. No active spells. No magical residue from potions. The only thing affecting these people was the energy of being here. Satisfied, Harry stuffed his wand back in his sleeve and gave himself over to just enjoying himself. He smiled and laughed at the people around him who smiled happily back, as they all bounced and danced together. It was marvelous.
“I did.”
“What are you doing up there?”
Harry moved even closer, slow and careful, until there was only a breath of air separating them.  “What was it about Fred that caught your attention?”
“She thought I was too clingy,” Ron said with a shrug even as he crossed his arms across his chest, feeling defensive.
“What are you talking about?”
“Hibiki 21 Year Old.”
“Legilimency?” Draco asked quietly.  The tears started flowing down Pansy’s cheeks again and she clenched her teeth against the anguished wail that wanted to be released.  That appeared to be enough of an answer.  He looked up at Ron.  “We need to get her to a mind healer.”
“Oh, um.  Not sure,” Ron sputtered.
The rest of Arthur climbed out of the pile to stand before his son.  “I know things haven’t been easy between you lately.  I’m not surprised, but I am truly sorry.”  He put a hand on Ron’s shoulder.
For all of you who stuck around I again apologize for the huge delay in the middle.
He found himself staring once again into bright green eyes.  That’s right.  He was trying to save Harry.  Harry who had believed him when there was every reason to be suspicious, who had stood by him and Pansy against Robards, who had treated this investigation into the attack of a Slytherin, a girl who had been willing to turn him over to certain death to save her own skin just a few years previous, as though it was just as important as an attack on one of his own close friends.  Draco could do this.  This time he could save Harry.
Harry groaned.  “No.”
“No, I don’t think so.  I think bottom up shots will be more dramatic.  I’ve been checking out pictures of famous bands performing and a lot of the best ones are bottom up action shots.  I think this is good right here, actually.”
“I mean …” Ron looked down at Pansy who was still shaking her head, and then at Harry.  Draco felt Harry’s shoulders shrug.  “I’ve never been in charge of anything before.”
“Ten?  I loved it when she was only putting in ten hours a day!”
“The younger ones in a big family always struggle to find ways to stand out,” Ron said, looking now at Charlie.
Ron rolled his eyes but his grin gave him away.  He slid forward in his own seat and leaned forward until their heads were almost touching.  He lowered his voice to almost a whisper and for a moment they were two small boys again, sharing secrets.  “You know I try to stay out of Fred and George’s plotting.
“It was him,” Harry confirmed without hesitation.
“How long will it take to brew the antidote?” Harry asked Malfoy.
The music was fantastic, snarky and upbeat and catchy as hell. Malfoy croned into the microphone, his rich voice rumbling down every spine as he sang.
Robards turned on him but something must have gotten through, because his tone turned whining and pleading.  “Kingsley … Minister … you don’t understand.  No one understands.”
That Rookwood had been spotted talking to the bus drive the day before the band’s trip north could be a coincidence.  While Harry had been out searching the city, that the Death Eater had been walking around right under his nose…. it could just be incredible timing ... but Harry did not believe that for a moment.  That Rookwood had been there yesterday could only meant that there was going to be another attack today.
Apparition?” Harry asked.
“What training did we receive that would possibly be of value in the Muggle world?” Pansy said, ignoring Draco.  That at least had not changed.  Pansy always had a knack for ignoring what she did not like.
It was enough to help Draco pull his own shattered composure back together, despite the black spots in his vision and the pounding pain at the back of his head.  “There is no spell,” he said flatly.
“Stop it!” Pansy yelled in helpless fury as Ron screams are cut off as his lungs struggled to keep up with the demand for oxygen.  Her cries only goaded the mad man on, Dolohov's face twisted in unholy glee as he renewed his efforts.
“He is doing what every groom aught,” Arther said fondly.  “Staying out of it.”
“Hello.”
Draco glared back.
“Go ahead, tell me.  What did he say?”
The brilliant retort he was working on was cut off when Miriam swug through the doors, a merry smile on her lips.  “You’re all here!” she said with more enthusiasm than the situation warranted.  “I have fantastic news.”
“He’s waking up.”
“But we lost it,” Harry mouthed along. It did not take a genius to figure out what Malfoy was singing about. While the beat was lively, the feel of the song was intense and filled with pain. They were mourning what they had lost, what they had let slip away and even though the crowd did not understand like Harry did, looking around he saw that everyone in that club was mourning with them.
Draco settled more firmly against Harry and watched Ron look after Pansy with a heartbroken expression.  Somehow Ron was missing what everyone was saying.  Draco wasn’t though.  Somewhere inside of him there was a small boy who was finally happy.
The young face crumpled once again but Harry was proud to see how, a moment later, he firmed his jaw and got himself under control.  “Good,” the brave young man said and then walked away.
“Harry.”  Draco’s voice was whisper quiet.
The burly Death Eater’s long, pale, twisted face smirked down at them.
“Where’s Hermione when we need her?” Ron asked, imitating Harry’s question from earlier.
“You alright?”
Draco walked alone through the gardens of the Malfoy Manor.  The stars above him and a sliver of moonlight were all that kept him company.  The rhythmic movements of his legs and the deep in and out of the air through his lungs helped clear the turmoil in his brain.  He fought not to think, just to move.
“Yes, Draco.”
“What is it?”
“Harry’s kind of clingy.”
Blaise shrugged and grinned and everyone laughed and cooed at the banter.
These days, what Harry Potter wanted he got and he wanted Draco Malfoy, body and soul.
Could he fool Rookwood where he had failed to fool Voldemort with Harry’s life on the line if he failed?  He was a Slytherin.  Surly that meant he had the skills to pull this off.  He could agree to help, string the two mad men along with empty promises about a spell that did not exist until an opportunity came where they could all escape.  It would work.  It had to.  Draco opened his eyes, ready to try, to agree to anything to keep his family alive.
“Not any of the details,” Ron shook his head and pursed his lip.  “They are definitely up to something though.”
With that realization, it was pretty easy to let go of any lingering animosity he might have felt for his one time rival.  He knew Draco had not had an easy time of it during the war, none of them had.  Mentally Harry had wished him well, and moved on with his life.  He and Robards had chatted about Malfoy several times when he had been contemplating joining.  What seemed to Harry to be an unreasonable antagonistic attitude that Robards held towards the Malfoys was one of the many reasons Harry had decided not to become an Auror.
“Yes.  I believe that McGonagall has banned him from half the castle, not that it does much good.  Peeve’s pranks continue.  Fred and George have been rather quiet lately, a nice change, I can assure you.  But if they are starting up again … I should warn our Headmistress.”
“What about my situation makes you assume I cannot feel the full weight of my position,” Malfoy responds.  “I assure you, I understand the magnitude of what I have escaped.”  His voice is calm and controlled but the superiority bread into him from infancy is still in evidence in his tone.
The expression on Draco’s face was enough to answer that question.
“The world as we know it is ending,” Draco grumbled.
“Sure,” the guy says, glancing at the shot.  “He was here yesterday,” and then continued off down the hall.
“That’s enough!” Kingsley Shacklebolt said in that deep booming voice of authority that had helped him get elected.
Finally Draco dropped his hand.  Even Potter's rejection of him had not cooled his intense interest.  He had squared off against Potter at every opportunity.  “Look at me,” Draco remembered thinking in one encounter after another.  “I may not be your friend, but I am something to you.  You look at me and know you know my name.”
The other player Harry was here to evaluate was the Slytherin Keeper and she was perfect.  Despite her lack of flash and pizzazz, Harry was having a hard time keeping his eyes off her.  She was always in position, reading the players in a way that was almost psychic, both her teammates and the opposition.  More than one shot was blocked that Harry had thought safely in.  Playing closer attention, Harry figured out that the Keeper was baiting the other team, tempting them into taking the shots she wanted them to take.  It was such a Slytherin way to play and Harry admired the strategy.  He had come a long way from the boy who saw anything not Gryffindor approved as cheating.
She never replied.
Harry’s first thought was to sweep Draco up in his arms and never let him go.  The second, an over-eager yes was also forced back down his throat.  He was a grown man.  He WOULD be composed about this.  “If I say yes, can I still take you out before that?”
Draco could not think of a reply that was not beneath him, and his pride had taken enough of a beating today.  Instead he steered the conversation to less dangerous waters.  “What are you all doing here?”
“It’s never been about us, Harry.  He’s got something against Malfoy and … we’ll he’s just unreasonable.”
“He had a sister, or two sisters maybe … anyway.  She’s a squib.  I remember because she came here once looking for father, needed help with something legal.  She had gone to work in the Muggle world.”
It felt good to be able to be there for Ron tonight even as his heart broke over what his best friend was going through.  It had been a while since he felt as close to Ron as he had tonight and Harry was looking forward to helping him with his case.
” The crowd sang with him.
Harry smiled.  The beautiful blond had lowered his voice to match Harry’s.  The two of them were practically whispering to each other.  The topic of conversation was nothing but an excuse.  Harry hesitated.  On the one hand, he did not want to push his luck and yet he felt an aching pull to see what he could get away with.  With a deep slow breath, he tilted his head until he was practically whispering in one pale, shapely ear.  He let his voice rumble through his chest.  “What do you think it means, the fact that they are not together?”
“Fuck you!” Blaise spat out from behind Greg.  “Have you listened to our music?”
“I’ll see you later.”
Ron picked up her hand and pressed it with a swift kiss.  “I’m looking forward to it.”
Wooden sticks tapped out a soft beat.
“You’re an idiot,” Draco responded, but a flush of color ran across his cheeks as he looked away and Harry counted it as a win.
“Uh huh,” Ron gave him a suspicious look.  “Is this about Malfoy?”
Harry didn’t know when he started taking pictures, it was almost an extension of the song itself.  Shots of Malfoy, moving to the beat of the music, his long white blond hair fanned out around his head like some elegant underwater sea creature.  Shots of Goyle and Blaise as they leaned into the music, each intent on the passion they were creating; shots of Pansy, her whole body moving to the beat as she ran the length of the stage with her guitar.
The walk to the nearest club was too short and did nothing to clear Draco’s head.  He ditched his coat and took to the floor, hoping the pounding beat of the music would help.  He was ignoring the small voice in his head whispering “what if…?”.  It sounded far too much like a much younger version of himself, the eleven year old dreaming of a new friend, of someone who could help him.
The door hadn’t even fully closed before Miriam Lockhart was rounding on them.  “I had thought better of Robards, and I certainly thought better of the two of you.  Let me warn you Harry Potter, those pictures you took today had better be amazing, they had better knock my socks off, because as of right now I am looking for any excuse to kick both of you right off the tour.”
“What’s going on?” Blaise asked, looking up for the first time.
Click.
A crash from behind Pansy had them both looking away.
“You’re both under a curse,” Draco concluded in horror.
Shacklebolt led Robards off which left Draco alone with two Weasleys.  That would be bad enough but he had the sickening realization that he owed them both an expression of gratitude.  He was struggling with exactly how he was going to pull that off and not lose all sense of decorum when Harry Potter arrived to save the day again.   He pulled Draco to his feet and wrapped him close.  “Are you alright?”
“Miriam …” Draco tried to interrupt.
“Lockhart, dear.”
Ron nodded and rubbed his nose with his sleeve.  “Yeah, okay.  You too, you know?”
“I need to go chat with a couple of players,” Harry said, waving him off.
Draco smiled, obviously pleased with their reactions.  “Let’s get Pansy tucked in and then I’ll give you the grand tour,” he said.
The war was no more kind to the Malfoys than the other Slytherin pure-bloods.  He is an outcast now, like the rest of us and I expect even now the Wizengamot are re-enforcing exactly how far his family has fallen from power.
Charlie shook his head.  “Didn’t Sirius escape Azkaban?  Do they have a revolving door in that place or something?”
“What do you mean they aren’t doing anything wrong!”  Robards was bellowing.  “They’ve got half of England throwing money at them!”
After waiting so long to be anything to Harry but an enemy, to have finally gotten his friendship and the possibility of so much more, he found a deep well of rage battling to come out that these two men would try and take it all away from him now.
“I saw you sneak off the bus and…” Harry trailed off, rubbing the back of his neck with a sheepish expression.
“No, I’m good, just … could you be the one to tell Mum?”
Pansy goes shopping.  She sees Draco, Harry and Ron out and about as well.  She is attacked by an unknown assailant and gets a cry out to Ron before having her mind invaded by a Legilimens spell.  Ron and Harry scare the attacker off and while Harry runs off in pursuit Ron and Draco take care of Pansy.  They take her to St. Mungos for evaluation where Ron and Harry ensure that Pansy and Draco are well treated.
“Only where my mother can hear me, darling.”
The three boys blinked at her.  “I thought you played the violin,” Blaise said.
“They formed a band.”
Harry sighed.  “Where’s Flitwick when I need him.”
Harry just nodded and with a wave, Ron allowed himself to be pushed away from the pit area.
“The best,” Ron agreed.
His breathing ragged, he nodded.  “I can’t… I just can’t…”  Ron seemed as incapable of completing a sentence as Harry.
“Yes!” Fred cheered.  The twins gave each other a high five.  One hand passed through the other but neither seemed to mind.
Draco looked up and up and up again to find the dragon looking back.  He shuddered and looked away.  He had been trying to forget what it was exactly that he was using as a backrest.  It had been a plan that had been working for him.
“Only after we both figured out neither one of us wanted to get back together.  Before that it was awkward as fuck.  You, my friend, have lost the privilege of setting me up on any more dates.”
“No,” Draco said again.
“He’ll come around.  In fact, you might find the next time you talk to him that his reluctant attitude has already begun to thaw.”
“There’s a whole rash of disappearances from that area,” Ron said.  “Most of them youth.  I keep telling Robards that we need to send an investigative team up there to see what’s going on.”
Harry stepped forward and put his hands on Draco’s arms, steadying him.  Draco was grateful for the strength.  “Who was it?”
“.. and he’s got you chasing after Malfoy.” Harry finished for him.
“We’re not splitting up!  We will figure out a way to get through this without being humiliated and Robards and the whole Wizengamot can go to hell.” Draco slapped his hand down hard on the arm of his chair for emphasis.
“Oh man, he was awful,” Blaise shuddered.  “Definitely the worst of a bad lot.”
Draco Malfoy was magnificent, strong and defiant in the face of his enemies.  As much as it pleased me to see him take on Robards, this is not the frame of mind I need him to be in when I invite him to join the newly reformed Death Eaters.  He needs to be broken, struggling and weak.  All that life has thrown at him has not yet broken young Malfoy.  As much as I would like claim Draco Malfoy for the cause, the timing is not right.
“No arguments from me, mate.  If anyone had any reason to dislike Malfoy, it’s us and if we think the sentence is stupid and pointless, I can’t imagine how anyone else justified it.”
Pansy shrugged.  “Doesn’t sound like you were too clingy to me.  Sounds to me like she was committed to something else, namely her job.”
Harry took a deep breath and acknowledged this new desire that burned in his gut was also perfectly natural.  He had broken up with Ginny when he realized neither of them felt the passion they should for the other.  Admitting his past interest in Malfoy, his archrival, had never been purely irritation or even platonic had been a first step to accepting his own sexuality.  Now he was forced to accept that his feelings ran even deeper.
In the stillness of the night, Draco indulged in thoughts of Harry Potter and what might have been and the demons were quiet.
Harry vanished so fast Pansy never saw him move.
“Draco,” Harry interrupted with a smile.  “Just ask.”
“Ron?” Harry asked, trying to pry his eyelids off his eyes.
Arthur’s smile grew even brighter.  “I can’t think of a finer compliment,” he said, clapping Harry on the shoulder with his free hand.  “Now, do you fine boys want to help me organize this mess or are you going to come up with a convincing excuse for why you suddenly have to be somewhere else?”  His eyes twinkled at them.
“But Pansy says …”
Nothing.  No active spells.  No magical residue from potions.  The only thing affecting these people was the energy of being here.  Satisfied, Harry stuffed his wand back in his sleeve and gave himself over to just enjoying himself.  He smiled and laughed at the people around him who smiled happily back, as they all bounced and danced together.  It was marvelous.
The moment held between them.  Quiet and long and sweet they stood, staring into each other’s eyes, with sweet expressions on their faces.
“There is no spell,” Draco insisted, feeling like he was speaking into an empty space with no one listening.
“It sounded like the two of you had a nice time.”
Neville shrugged noncommittally.  “Good luck with that.  You going to Apparate to Edinburgh to meet the band.”
“Oh, it’s Robards.  He’s as barmy as ever, sure that Malfoy is out there trying to take over the world with his band.”
They pushed forward until they were right at center stage, fairly close up in the mosh pit of pressed bodies bouncing to the music of the band opening for ‘Sly’.
“No, it’s true,” Ron whispered back with a giggle.  “I mean it makes sense doesn’t it.  I don’t know anyone who puts as much energy into each other as those two did that were not already in a committed relationship.”
” he sang as the music swelled beneath his voice.
Ron laughed.  “Yeah, Harry was pretty bad when it came to Draco too.”  He tossed Pansy a bit of a mischievous look.  “I wonder if Draco’s obsession was for the same reason.”
They were both dressed in usual club fair. Harry wore a black mesh shirt, black leather duster and pants while Ron was in tight levi’s and a flowing white shirt. Both men were picking up some interest and Harry found himself tossing out a smile and a wink at a couple of girls as he passed. It was fun and harmless and it had been a while since Harry had an opportunity for either.
“I’m going to track down Fred and George.”  They were finally out of the stands and Ron was heading back to the castle with the rest of the spectators.
“We thought you were dead,” Pansy added, curling up tighter against Ron’s side.  Ron pulled her in close.  The look on his face told Harry in no uncertain terms what that moment had cost his friend.
“Did she apologize?”  Harry asked, trying to find something that he could use to help put them back together.
“Have you seen Malfoy?” Harry asked Ron.  The two of them were battling their way out of the stands with the rest of the student body.
Miriam spoke over him, just as loud, “I will not allow either of these two to jeopardize….”
The two of them had managed to meet a couple times inside the club where they were performing, before a show.  Pansy would spend a few minutes venting her justifiable frustration with Draco and Ron would grumble about Harry's pinning and they would stand really close together and hold hands and smile and flirt.  Draco might be miserable, but Pansy was having the time of her life.
Harry just shrugged.
“What brings you boys over, not that you’re not always welcome” Arthur was quick to assure them.
“Well, because I’m pretty sure you’re not going to lie to protect my feelings.”
“Harry’s got this thing about being left out.  He wasn’t an only child, but the people who raised him didn’t want him.  He was left out of pretty much everything.  It’s hard on him now, being on the outside and looking in.  If I got on the tour bus while he still wasn’t allowed, … well, it would hurt him.”
He would invite her to come take advantage of the VIP tickets Harry and he would have waiting for her at the ticket booth.  There would always be a bit about the area of the world they were in, how it would be a brilliant tourist destination if she felt the need for a vacation with an offer to take some time off to explore with her if she wanted to come.
So Harry held him.
“Every drop of Minotaur blood comes complete with a magical labyrinth.  Solve the labyrinth and you are free.  Mess up and your blood is added to that of the original Minotaur.”
This was the last step, the last relationship he had carelessly laid aside for a career that had tried to take everything.  Ron raised his hand and knocked, then dropped to one knee.  The huge bouquet blocked most of Pansy’s expression when she opened the door, but Ron caught a glimpse of surprised pleasure as he peeked around them with a hopeful expression.  “I’m sorry,” Ron said as Pansy struggled to get control over her face.  “I was wrong and I won’t do it again.”
“A band.” Blaise said as though he were tasting the idea on his tongue.
Ron nodded. “That’s right.  The guy was spitting nails when they hauled him away, demanding a rematch or some nonsense.”
“We’ve got the wards to keep him out, but he’s got something on the door to keep us in.”  Draco said, waving to the front door behind them.
“I called Dad, who got Shacklebolt to drag Robards and all available Aurors up here with him.  We all suspected that if they had taken both Harry and Ron this had to be more than just a bunch of kids being irresponsible.  While dad was handling the Aurors, I made a side trip to go pick up Norberta here.  She and Harry bonded when he came to visit last and I figured she could help us track him.  Good thing I did.  Not sure how we would have gotten Harry out of that mess otherwise.”
The two men exchanged fond glances but Harry still shook his head.
Draco Malfoy did not stand defiant against evil.  That was Harry’s way.
“Good.  Now go enjoy your celebration.”
Draco closed his eyes and for a moment Harry was convinced he was going to bridge the remaining distance.  Instead he shook his head as though trying to throw off a spell.  “Not anymore,” he said with finality.  Malfoy stepped back, visibly pulling himself together.  When he returned his eyes to Harry’s he was composed.  “There was an unfortunate incident at Quidditch last year.  Fireworks timers went off early, nearly killing George.  Peeve’s doing, of course.  Fred saved his brother by diverting the fire around him, but all three are now banned from the games.”
Harry wasn’t worried.  He could take Rookwood.
Malfoy was going to leave, shifting away from Harry, casual and yet persistent.  He opened his mouth to speak again, no doubt to excuse himself from the conversation.
Pansy grinned.  “It was probably because Draco was distracted with fixing the cabinet all year and not paying attention to him.”
“I was never a priority.” Ron said, wiping his eyes.  “Not a first priority or even a last priority.  I never even made the fucking list.  She just … it was all about her career, you know?  Ever since they moved her over to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement she just … there was no time for me.”
“Really?” Ron said, dropping his arms and his smile was back.  “You mean it?”
Ron and Charlie gathered around to see.  “It doesn’t move,” Ron called out the obvious as they examined the image in the small frame on the camera.
Ron questions his career choice and they all live happily ever after.
“No,” Harry said firmly and suddenly he was furious at Hermione for making Ron ask such an awful question.  “No, you’re not.”
“Finite Incantatem!”
Ron looked up at him.
Ron groaned.  “The last thing those two need is help from Peeves.”
” Malfoy sang back.
Draco looked up and up and up.  A Horntailed dragon looked down at him, and seated high on his back, grinning and only a bit worse for wear, was Harry Potter.  “You alright there Draco?”  Harry’s hoarse voice was filled with amusement.
The Draco of the present looked up at the stars as he remembered.
“Just be careful,” Harry said, wandering back into the conversation.  “Could be this is more than just one disappearance.  There’s also the two Death Eaters that escaped from Azkaban a while back on the loose and they could be anywhere.”
Ron’s blue eyes rimmed with clumped red lashes looked up at him.  “You sure?”
Everyone is there for the end.
“Yesterday.  Her and her latest fiance, whose name I haven’t even bothered learning, have fluffed off to tour Europe until they get bored enough to tie the knot.  Why else do you think I am hanging around with you lot?”  The bitterness in Blaise voice spoke clearly his opinion of his mother's latest association.  Noemi Zabini’s string of marriages was as famous as her political intrigues.  That her political reputation and power had survived the war unscathed surprised no one.
“Poor kid.”  The confusion was still evident.
Harry and Ron’s meeting with Miriam Lockhart could be condensed down to one sentence: “Screw this up and die.”  Harry was not sure if Ron had been feeling any stress before the meeting about posing as a band photographer but he certainly was now.  It still was not clear to either of them why Ron needed to pose as a photographer in the first place but Miriam was no more willing to let them back out of the job than Robards had been.
“Where did you get that?”  Harry asked, nodding at the book.
“Pansy, you are a woman of hidden depths.”  Draco threw his arms around her.  “We will definitely invite your mother to hear us perform.”
Ron took the bait, complaining wildly about his brothers’ wild antics and their continually increasing popularity.  The smiles became real as the two friends laughed and enjoyed each other’s company the rest of the way to Hogwarts.
Harry was decidedly grumpy about this.  He was self aware enough to know that he liked to be the center of attention of those who mattered to him.  Draco Malfoy obviously now fit into that category.  This revelation solidified the conviction that he had made a mistake in telling Ron he did not want to date Draco.  Ron would not let him change his mind without a heavy dose of good natured harassment, but it would be worth it.  He needed his friend to help him figure out the best way to approach Malfoy, as he was not doing well on his own.
“You sure?  You’ll never get a steady shot from down here.”
“That doesn’t sound right,” Harry shook his head.  “Neville said something about healing and dead tissue.  Not resurrection or bringing things back to life, just tissue.”
Draco could not look away.  Harry and Ron lay on the ground screaming, Dolohov standing over them cackling in delight at their pain.
“Wait.  I thought it was a boy egg.  Norbert, right?” Ron said.  “Wooh, keep that thing away from me, he’s already bitten me once.”
The fundamental techniques of how to hold and sit on a broom was something that most amateurs would dismiss as unimportant.  Playing at this level, the player was compensating well with no more than an occasional wobble when under pressure.  In the intense strain of a professional game, however, the Beater would find himself off his broom.
“Given the way I went off on you earlier, I’d say that’s pretty accurate.”  They exchanged an amused look.
“Not that I disagree with that sentiment, but isn’t that a little hard when the three of you run a business together?”
Dolohov dropped Draco, whose legs refused to support him and he collapsed in a heap on the grass.  His head swam and his stomach rolled.  When he finally felt like he would not empty the contents of his stomach Draco lifted his head to see Dolohov walking after Rookwood, Harry floating helplessly along behind them.
“Then we’ll teach you.”
When Draco flicked his wand and four bottles began pouring into a shaker..
“Blaise can be on keyboard,” Draco said.
“Don’t you remember her,” Charlie asked, patting the large lizard like dragon with black scales on the nose while both Harry and Ron were keeping as far back as possible.
Arthur shook his head.  “I was hoping this obsession Gawain has with the Malfoys would ease with time, but if anything it seems to be getting worse.”
“Augustus Rookwood and Antonin Dolohov.” Ron explained.  “They broke out a few months ago.  Rookwood is a nasty piece of work.  Got into the heads of the guards with spouses that work in the prison.  It looks like he was the one behind the release of the Death Eaters during the war as well.”
Harry was still smiling when he entered the dining hall and there was a definite spring in his step.  He felt a thousand feet tall and on top of the world.  Caught up in his own head, Harry’s feet were on autopilot.  Long years of habit had him heading towards the Gryffindor table.  He was actually looking for a spot among the students before the realization hit him that this was not where he should be sitting.  Harry veered off and headed up toward the guest area at the head table next to where the Professors sit.
The name meant nothing to Harry, but he could guess that it would mean something to someone who knew Bourbon.  “Do I want to know how much this is a bottle?”
Draco peeked out from Harry’s shoulder to watch Shacklebolt.  He was glancing around at the field full of Aurors when his face suddenly brightened.  “Ron!”
“Do you want to leave?  We can go tell Robards’ there is nothing to find and bail on this any time we want.”
“They don’t really like us there.”  Draco admitted.
Ron’s stomach grumbled at the thought of food.  He had missed lunch again and with no time for shopping there was little edible left at his flat.  “That would be amazing.”  He gathered the worst of the reports into his arms and followed Hermione into the hall, grateful for the offer of food and company.
He could his father’s voice say ‘I’m proud as long as you are happy.’  Looking around at these quiet people buried inside their nests of paper, Ron realized in startling clarity that he would not be happy here.
“It’s minor.  I figured it out while I was riding around on Noberta.  With the wind and her moving beneath me I was having a hard time keeping things steady.  It’s just a little bit of help in case I get jostled.”
Harry nodded.  “If that didn’t get them interested in the healing arts nothing will.  Wasn’t Peeves involved in that somehow?”
“Can I come?”
“Wait, if Dolohov and his goons can’t get in, does that mean that we can’t get out?”
Draco did not know how to begin to respond to that.  Everything had been so different from what he expected lately.  He kept being surprised in a good way, things kept working out better than he had hoped and it was freaking him out.  Good surprises were just was not the way life worked out for him.
“One door down from the exercise room,” Draco said dryly and Goyle had the grace to blush.
Pansy’s delighted giggle had Draco’s gaze snapping back to her.
I finished!
“You looking to see what you can sabotage?”
“You can’t tell the gender by the egg Ron,” Charlie teased and Ron pulled a face at him.  “We figured out Norbert was really Norberta not long after she got here.  Girls are much more violent and territorial you know.”
“Anyway, as I was saying earlier, I was taking pictures of all the Dragons on the preserve for the Prophet a bit ago, mostly because I was the only one who could get a decent shot.  Their professional photographer wouldn’t come anywhere near the dragons.”
“All we’ve done for the last hour is apologize to each other.”  Pansy collapsed in a high-backed, uncomfortable looking chair in front of the line of tall windows.  Greg got to a count of eight before she was up and moving again.
Pansy reached out and laid her hand on Ron’s arm.  “Middle child syndrome.”
Ron showing up at Grimmauld place without Hermione was not a surprise.
Draco closed his eyes for one more moment, and decided.
“Yeah, you really have no business out in the field until you get your head together,” Harry agreed.
The bus shimmered into view as the Disillusionment spell faded.  It was tipped over on it’s side just around a blind curve but perfectly visible from the air.  Surrounding it were half a dozen wizards in black cloaks.  They all turned at the sound of the motorbike and one of them moved toward Harry as he dove at them.
“Bet Robards was kicking and screaming the whole way here,” Draco mused.
Everyone laughed as the cords died out.
Should he go?  Harry wondered.  He should probably go, said Hermione’s voice in his head.  It was rude to eavesdrop.
Draco leaned forward and rested his forehead on the table.  Harry reached out, hesitating for a moment, his hand hovering, unsure of his welcome, and then allowed his fingers to settle softly on Draco’s back.  Draco turned his head on the table and looked at him.  Harry’s full hand settled and he began to rub slow circles through the soft material of Draco’s shirt.
“He’s already dead,” George adds.
Kidnapped and facing an uncertain future, it was the most peace Harry had known in a long time.
“Remind me not to tick Flitwick off,” Charlie joked.  Harry smiled gratefully at the two brothers for lightening the mood.  None of them would forget Remus, Fred or any of the others that had fallen in the war.  When the subject of those who had been lost came up, they didn’t avoid it, but they did not linger in the loss either.
That was it.  That was the last straw.  “I’m going to my room,” Draco announced.  “Please come get me when the world has once again returned to normal.”  He dropped the picture he was holding back onto the table and swept out.
There is a pain in his chest that reasserts itself every time he takes a moment to breathe over the lack of word from Pansy, but if asked he would say he was relieved.  When things calm down he’ll go after her, make it up to her, help her see what a good thing this is for his career.  Right now, things are too new; it will calm down eventually.  He’ll get through the worst of these reports, his men will close some of the open cases … it will get better.
“Seeing for myself has proven more effective in convincing me of the truthfulness of your words.  I apologize for not accepting your assurances.  Now help me.  How do I fix this?”
In the dark shadows I wait.  A dark hood protects my skin both from the rain and recognition.  My pale face, pockmarked and scarred from years of hard living, is easily recognizable, especially here, in the capital seat of my enemies.  Here, where I should have ruled at my master’s side; instead I hide like a rat in the shadows, fearful for my own life.  The frustrated rage rises up inside of me as I fight back the knowledge of what might have been.  I have years of controlling my emotions but even my hard won control is badly tested against the anger that burns hot and bright like Fiendfyre in my soul.  That fire cannot be seen.  Patience is hard won but will be rewarded.  I remind myself why I am here.  Not for vengeance.  Not yet.
‘A few weeks back I visited the Hogsmeade branch of WWW to pick up a shipment of …” Ron paused, trying to remember but Harry just waved him on.  “Right, doesn’t matter.  Anyway, while I was there I noticed this statue of a cat.”
Ron didn’t even bother to look up at Pansy from where he was hunched over with the pyrotechnics lead.  “Are you kidding?  This is fascinating.  It’s almost as good as what George is doing at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.”
Everyone laughed as the cords died out.
“Relax Potter.  If they wanted us dead they would have done that already.”  Draco said from his seat at the table.
Wooden sticks tapped out a soft beat.
Almost.
Everyone poured back into the center area as the lights dimmed.  Harry found himself holding his breath.  Bodies moved in the darkness.  A hush fell over the whole club as they all waited.
Malfoy was already turning to go before the last words were out of his mouth.
“Look at me,” Harry said.  He gently tilted the wet chin up until he could see sad blue eyes.  “I’m not saying you’ll never play professionally, just that you have some work to do first.  Fixing your seat on the broom at this stage won’t be easy, but it’s possible.  What’s worse is that trying to fix it is going to screw everything else up while you adjust.  If playing at Hogwarts is enough for you, then leave it alone and just enjoy playing.  However, if playing professionally is important to you, then do fix this and fight your way back.”  Harry squeezed his shoulders.  “Alright?”
“What?” Harry turned from the window to face his first and best friend across the compartment.
The next moment, all Pansy could see was Ron’s chest as he wrapped her up in his strong, warm arms.  “It’s alright Pansy, I’ve got you.  It’s over.”
“Blaise.”  That was Malfoy’s voice, deep and resonating, washing over the crowd with almost as much power as the chords of the music.  People laughed again at the obvious scolding tone in that one word.  The lights came up just enough for everyone to see Malfoy, tall and majestic, the microphone in hand as he peered back over his shoulder towards the keyboard and his bandmate.
“So tell me about this other fella, Rookwood was it?”
“Petrifying someone is not a prank!” McGonagall screeched.  She storms towards the twins.
” The crowd sang with him.
She believed him.
Blaise shrugged and grinned and everyone laughed and cooed at the banter.
“I told you,” Ron says again, louder.
“Trust me,” Harry had said, had asked.
“I’m going to talk to venue crew one more time.  Someone tipped of Rookwood that we were here.  Someone’s got to know something.”
It will be a couple weeks before I start posting the next chapter in the Not Easy story.  I've gone through the original and made a whole bunch of fixes and changes to the original and will be posting those next week.
Harry laughed.  “I don’t envy her the job.  Fred, George and a bunch of bored students has never been a good combination.”
We used to rule the world …”
“Not much up that far north but rocks.  Trust you to send us off into the freezing north.” Neville laughed.  “What are you going to do?”
The opening act closed up after another song and everyone took a moment to catch their breath. The crowd dispersed a bit and people wandered off to get drinks as the crew started re-arranging the instruments and equipment on the stage.
The past hung thick in Harry’s mind until Ron broke through the second time with a less welcome question.  “So how is single life treating you?”
“I’m sure.”
“What can I do?”
Draco was watching him; his silver grey eyes, sharp with interest, felt like a physical weight across his skin as he moved.  It was heady and not at all unpleasant.
“Yeah, I can see how well that worked, seeings how you are being sent to Paris after Malfoy instead,” Charlie teased.
How could anyone resist wanting something so beautiful?  The thought broke Harry out of his trance and he pulled his eyes away from the stage.  Once more he pulled out his wand and checked the crowd.  No magic.  No magical ingredients in the air.  The spell the ‘Sly’ band was casting over the crowd was completely natural, a combination of charisma and talent.
Just like that, her body relaxed its defenses and she started to cry.  Loud ugly sobs tore out of her chest that she struggled to breath around.  Her body pour out the horrible trauma through tears and convulsing muscles.
“Go!  Find!  Miriam!”  Harry bellowed back.
Harry found himself responding and a desire greater than he had ever experienced before rode him.  He wanted to catch Malfoy’s wild hair in his fingers and suck the sweat from his neck.  It took all of his self control to stop himself from leaping up on that stage and dragging Malfoy’s body against his own.  All Harry’s loss and pain seemed to shift as he watched that beautiful body move.  He wanted with a strength and passion that shook him to the core.  Of all the crazy, adrenaline filled, death defying things Harry had done in his life, nothing felt quite like standing in that packed club, caught up in the magic of wanting Draco Malfoy.
“Oh Lord, this IS about Malfoy.”  Ron collapsed back in his chair and let out an exasperated huff.  “It’s going to be fifth year all over again, with you following him around like a lost puppy.”
“Slower than just Flooing directly to McGonagall's office.”
Draco dragged a book out from behind him.  “It appears what he used is Minotaur blood.”
When he was close enough to touch he continued.  “Not yet.  But there will be, when you join us.”
“What?”
Pansy tucked a strand of hair behind her ear before looking up at Ron from beneath her lashes.  “Do you want to come check out the tour bus?  The bans on magic don’t apply there since no one goes in but us.  Draco spared no expense and the whole thing is magically expanded, one of the largest hidden living spaces outside of Grimmauld Place.  It’s pretty sweet.”
“I know the thing with Ginny could have gone better…”
“You’re right, of course you are right.  But what do we do!?  He’s my boss Harry.  It’s not like I can just tell him he’s being a twat.”
“That was not at all the meeting I was hoping for.  What happened?  Surely that all can’t be just because we showed up,” Harry asked, finally moving to sit next to him.
“Would you let him know that … well…”  Harry recognized Malfoys voice and froze.
“Huh.  Well good for Malfoy.  He always did know how to land on his feet.  I hope it works out for him.”  Harry leaned back with a satisfied smile.
Rookwood dove for Draco.  Unarmed, Draco lept backwards, away from the attack, only to run into something firm and warm and BIG.  Rookwood switched directions so fast he ended up on his butt, scuttling backwards like a crab right into Ron.  “Gotcha, you creep.” Ron said, ripping Rookwood’s wand from his hand.
Harry pressed, but the cunning witch refused to say more.
Ron scratched the back of his head and squinted at him before sighing and giving in.  “We're supposed to be doing things the Muggle way ... but, as long as no one finds out, I’m not sure what harm it will do.”
“Oh come on, you can’t still be hung up on who he was when we were kids.”
Ron was not there yet and neither was his favorite Slytherin so Harry dropped himself into a spot with lots of room.  As he waited, Harry made it a point to catch the eye and give a smile to every student he knew.  He wasn’t aware of Ron’s presence until he dropped down onto the bench beside him.  He turned, opening his mouth to speak when someone took the seat on his other side.  Malfoy looked as uncomfortable as he had ever seen him as he glanced up at Harry’s face from beneath his fringe.
“Great.” Blaise said with even more sarcasm than before.
Greg and Pansy both beamed at each other while Draco mentally reviewed every counter curse he knew.
Despite the dire circumstances, Harry could not help smiling at the off-handed way Ron mentioned his ex and nodded in agreement.  They had always relied on her to be a step ahead of everyone else when it came to magic use.
Harry shrugged and looked back out the window.  His conversation with Neville had ended with the same awkward sadness.  It wasn’t that he didn’t understand why Longbottom was working on this.  It was too late and Dumbledore was dead, but if someone had thought to work on something that would reanimate dead tissue before he had died then maybe…  They couldn’t change the past, but maybe the cure the old Headmaster had so desperately needed could help someone in the future.
Hours later, as Draco watched the sun rise over the streets he had walked restlessly all night, he admitted one thing, if only to himself; maybe Harry Potter did have a crush on him.
Ron just shrugged.  “Hey, I’m just doing what I’m told.”
“I’m trying to imagine Draco Malfoy’s expression if anyone had the temerity to actually call him ‘snookums’ to his face.”  Harry bumped shoulders with Ron and Ron bumped back as they headed out.  Two best friends, side by side, ready to take on the world.
“Like what?”
“I’m sorry.”  Harry said softly.  It was not the first time Ron had assumed him dead.  Harry needed to be more careful to make sure it was the last.  “I think we’re getting too old for this hero crap.”
“How do you open a door sealed with Minotaur blood?” Ron asked.
“Yes, that’s it!  Lockhart.”
“These kids have been through enough already without getting dragged into whatever horrid trauma you seem to attract wherever you go.”  Miriam glared at Harry as though he were evil incarnate while Harry pushed back, hands raised in a show of surrender.
“What? You didn’t ...” Ron cut himself off and then pulled closer. “You didn’t do anything to the camera did you?”
The better news is that chapter 10 is complete as well.  It currently is sitting as a hand written version in my notebook that needs to be transcribed and beta'd, but the worst is done and I can promise it will be posted next week on schedule unless the world ends between now and then.
These days, what Harry Potter wanted he got and he wanted Draco Malfoy, body and soul.
“No!”
“That’s ridiculous, Robards, and you know it.  I’ve thrown off the imperius curse.  Nothing so faint that it can’t even be detected is going to have any impact on me at all. You’re wasting Ron’s time and Auror resources that could be put to better use, like tracking down whoever attacked Ms. Parkinson.”
“But what?!” Pansy wailed and collapsed back on the uncomfortable looking chair.  This time Greg only got to six before she was up again.
“Artistic jobs are as hard to come by in the Muggle world as they are in ours, darling,” Pansy said with obvious regret.
Fred backed away.  “It’s not like we killed him.”
“Thanks, Dad,” Ron said softly.
“Well, if he is, he’s doing a lousy job.  From what I hear, he and Shacklebolt have already had it out a couple times in the last few weeks.  It’s been a bit tense in the office and it was a relief to have an excuse to be somewhere else.  If you want me and the boys to check out the surrounding villages, even if it is a long shot, we’ll do it.”
Greg and his new girlfriend were sickening, as Draco repeatedly informed anyone who would listen.  Greg’s new favorite pastime was lifting weights in his room to the beat of their own music while his girlfriend oo’d and ahh’d at him.  He was dressed all in black, when he got dressed at all, and the eyeliner he wore was tastefully done; apparently his girlfriend was a bit of a makeup diva.  Pansy was forced to admit he might be going a bit over the top, but he seemed happy.  The new muscles he was sporting as he walked around the tour bus half dressed, however, were making Pansy a bit uncomfortable.  This was Greg after all.  That he might have a body worth noticing was not something she had ever considered and quite frankly never wanted to.
No matter how he tried to lead into it, his old Head of House refused to get drawn into a conversation about Draco Malfoy.  “I’m going to let you learn about Professor Malfoy from the man himself.”  She hid a smile behind her tea cup.
The sat in silence, thinking.
Another step back.
“He was messing with the ingredients in the potions lab.”  Malfoy nodded but he was still inching backward.
“Are you saying that you saw this man right here talking to the bus driver for ‘Sly’ yesterday.”  Harry clarified.
Ron asked something, but the noise in the Grand Hall had increased and Harry was too far away to hear.  Harry drifted closer.  Malfoy’s posture remained casual and easy, comfortable in Ron’s presence.  Malfoy waved an elegant hand off in a direction and the red head nodded his thanks.
How could it be okay, Draco wondered, the thought coming from someplace a step removed from the gut wrenching scene they were all playing out.  He should be panicking but all he felt was the numb certainty of how this would end.  He was about to lose this wonderfully brave man.  The final insult seemed to be that the sea, that would soon swallow so much, had already drowned the last words Draco would ever have gifted to him from this precious man in front of him.  “Harry,” Draco said, and there was nothing more.  Just his name, and a helplessness that would cost him everything.
“Not helpful,” Draco snapped.
” he sang as the music swelled beneath his voice.
Too scared to defend what was ours by right
“What’s this?”  Draco asked as they all gathered around.
“It’s minor. I figured it out while I was riding around on Noberta. With the wind and her moving beneath me I was having a hard time keeping things steady. It’s just a little bit of help in case I get jostled.”
The grin that spread over his best friend's face was a gift Harry treasured.
“Getting up right before sunrise isn’t the middle of the night,” Harry shot back good naturedly,  “ and the light is better first thing in the morning.”
“Yes, but darling what are we going to do?!” Pansy brought the conversation back around to the subject that they had been beating their heads against for what felt like forever.  “We can’t use magic, we have no credentials in the Muggle world.  Any job that we qualify for would involve manual labor and my nails would never recover from such abuse!”
“Oh good, so I can convince him he needs to cut it short again and you won’t mind at all?”
“Greaaaat,” Harry and Ron said in unison.
Harry flashed Ron a mischievous smile.
“These are really good.”  Blaise sounded as confused as Draco felt.
What came out next was neither planned nor carefully coached, and yet Ron knew was surprisingly perfect, especially coming from him.  “I plan to follow you around and worship the ground you walk on.”
Apologizing to his family for ignoring them was also easy.  They all forgave him.  His brothers still teased, harassed and pranked him at every opportunity, his mother still scolded and hugged and was a whirlwind of constant motion, while his father beamed proudly at all of them.  Life as a Weasley continued on with all of the frustrations and joys that heritage entailed.
“Do you know how to use it?”  Ron asked, looking at it like it was going to bite him.
Arthur pulled his youngest son into his arms.  “I am proud, as long as you are happy.”
“Oh Merlin, don’t even get me started …” Ron said raising his head but the smile he wore was real even if his eyes were still damp.
” the crowd responded.
“Yes, Draco.”
Harry was done with this conversation.  “How are things going with Pansy?”
“No joke.”  They locked eyes and then broke out into very unmanly giggles.
“One of the girls who has been following us around.”
“What are they doing?”  Harry asked again, getting a bit impatient.
“And you had to drag me with you because … ?”
“The man has flipped his lid, completely crazy.  I’m telling you Harry, you should be glad you never joined.  He's gone round the bend.”
The music was fantastic, snarky and upbeat and catchy.  Malfoy croned into the microphone, his rich voice rumbling down every spine as he sang.
“Floo Network?” Ron asked in desperation.
“Sure we do.  I mean enough to get started, anyway.”
Draco followed the sound of raised voices, both of which he recognized now that he was a bit closer.  Robards was arguing with Harry Potter.  Draco knew first hand that behavior never ended well.  Potter was not one to lose.
“No idea.  That stuff is not exactly funny.  Not that Fred and George can’t make anything funny, but I can’t think of a use for it.”  Both of them exchanged a look, remembering the Chamber of Secrets and the Basilisk.  “But maybe that’s what Neville is helping them with.”
“Have you?”  Draco met Harry’s eyes, his own wide and a bit lost.
“Here, let me see,” Harry took the camera from Ron.  “My uncle had one of these when I was growing up.  I don’t think it was as nice as this one though.  Look at these settings … portrait, landscape, indoors and outdoors.  Nice.  Do you have a charging station for the flash?”
Not yet.
“No, it’s alright.  Actually yes, I was hoping to have you loosened up a bit before I …”  Draco pushed away from the bar, running his hands through his hair.  “I need to apologize.  For a lot of things, actually.”
“No.  You’re right about that.  This whole thing is a wild goose chase.”
It was painful to watch Malfoy establish the distance between them again, but Harry did not fight it.  The professor's reaction had confirmed that the physical attraction was mutual.  That was enough for now.  Harry watched Malfoy take another step back and he cast around in his mind for a way to keep the conversation going.  “I heard you had your own encounter with Peeves.”
Although, picture or no, he was still coming up empty.
“Yes, they are fabulous,” Miriam agreed.
“You’re a good friend.”  Pansy said with a smile and Ron beamed back at her.  “If you’re both good, maybe you’ll both get an invitation to check it out.”
The band was huddled together against the bus, none of them really the worse off after the battle for control of the bus.  Harry and Ron had taken the brunt of the attack, were still taking it, their wands confiscated, lying helpless on the ground as another round of crucios reigned down on them.
“It was a good game.”  Harry nearly groaned aloud.  Of course he started off the conversation talking about Quidditch.
“Then I would love to.”  Harry leaned forward and carefully pressed his forehead to Draco’s.
Harry drew back from Draco slowly, his expression a stunned wonder, fragile and precious.  “Really?” he whispered.
Harry wrapped his arm around the boy’s shoulders.  “Professional Quidditch isn’t about house alliances or even really team alliances, although I would appreciate it if you did not spread that little fact around.  As a young player, you can get traded around quite a bit.  Your opponents today could be your teammates tomorrow.  It’s the skills that you bring to the table that are most important.  To put you on a professional field like you are currently would be irresponsible.  Even the best players get hurt sometimes but with the way you sit your broom it’s inevitable.
“I understand you were instrumental in tracking down these two scoundrals.”  Shacklebolt waved in the direction of where Rookwood and Dolohov were bound and waiting to be transported back to Azkaban.
Harry let his smile widen into something a bit more predatory.
Ron tipped her head back gently, cast a quick spell and looked into her eyes.  Pansy did not know what he was looking for, but he seemed to have found it.  He turned back to Harry to shout, “she’s alright!  Go after him!”
“Actually,” Pansy interrupted again and then paused.  “I can play guitar.”
Harry could literally see the moment Ron’s strategic mind kicked in and another thought occurred to him.
And while Pansy rapped, Malfoy danced.  It was breathtaking and erotic.  The blond gyrated wildly behind Pansy, his long, lithe body a physical representation of the music pouring off the stage.  Harry could not take his eyes off of him.  Sweat darkened his hairline and gleamed on his chest; the shiny green pants almost black with sweat leaving little to the imagination.  Malfoy was hard, his aroused state obvious and thrilling on the bright stage as he danced for the crowd.  Just like that, the ache in Harry’s chest inspired by the mourning and loss of the song transmuted into something else entirely.
Harry’s lips quirked up as well and he shrugged.  “It was a tough time.  I don’t blame anyone for trying to survive.  You really can’t think of any reason why Rookwood would attack Pansy?”
” he sang as the music swelled beneath his voice.
“Well Harry thinks…” Ron paused and looked around like he was checking for eavesdroppers.  Then he pulled Pansy close to whisper in her ear.  “Harry thinks his obsession with Malfoy was because he liked him, but hadn’t figured it out yet.”
Draco glanced at his band mates and friends to see his own confusion reflected back at him.  “You think the four of us can take on the ministry?”
Rookwood’s eyes, that had almost glowed in fervorous delight as he described the future as he saw it, flickered briefly Harry’s direction before he threw in as an afterthought, “And we will allow Mr. Potter here to live for a while longer.”
Draco had other friends, others stood beside him even now as he had once hoped Harry Potter would.  Saving them, and himself, was a task that fell to him alone.
“Are you coming?” Hermione had paused a few steps in and looked back at him.  One of the witches closest to the door shushed her.  It was like being in a library and suddenly Ron understood exactly why Hermione was so comfortable here in this place, in this life.
“I’m sorry sir, I really haven’t seen anyone who looks like that,” the lady said without looking up from her desk.  “Now if you will excuse me, I really am very busy.”
Harry slipped from his chair and stood as well, the solid black bar still between them, a barrier but also a comfort.  “If you are talking about school then let it go.  I have.”
“You don’t know what they’re up to with Neville then?”
The three men exchanged a smile and then focused on their food.
“Did you want to talk about it?”
“You are out of your mind. You were on the back of a Norwiegian Ridgeback… voluntarily… for fun! That camera has driven you right out of your skull.” His volume rose to be heard over the noise of the band currently center stage. “I thought you had calmed down after defeating Voldemort. You walked away from the Aurors, been spending most of your time at home working on your house. ‘Harry has turned over a new leaf’, I told myself. But noooo … not you. You were just waiting, biding your time, lulling me into a false sense of security until BAM! …. A new obsession. A new reason to run around riding on dragons and getting up in the middle of the night and … and …. going out of your mind.”
They roamed through most of the Weasley home before they both shared a ‘Duh’ moment.  “He’s in the workshop!” they said almost in unison.
Pansy tucked herself up under Draco’s chin and smiled happily.  It had been years since the two of them were a couple, but they were still comfortable being in each other’s space.
Harry reached after him but Draco couldn’t … he couldn’t.  Breaking away, Draco darted off the floor and into the night.  He heard Harry call after him and the small boy deep inside begged him to stop but he couldn’t … he COULDN’T!!
“The wards should repel a full scale invasion aimed anywhere but the front door.”  Draco assured.
Usually one mention of Harry’s bisexual tendencies was enough to have Ron desperately trying to change the subject.
Grey eyes met green and held as Harry touched him.  His hand grew bolder sliding down to caress his sides and up under his arms, his fingers never lingering, never speeding up, just touching, soft and gentle.
“No Blaise.” Malfoy’s voice was patronizing and teasing and charming as hell.
After a moment of uncomfortable silence, Greg could not help pointing out what he thought was obvious.  “What about music?”
Harry grinned back.  “So what are you going to do?”
Harry had often wondered how his archrival was fairing, knew it could not be easy with the choices his family had made, and even found himself with feelings of sympathy that he was not exactly sure what to do with.  It was good to hear that the clever blond had not only found a way to survive but to thrive.  Staring at the flames Harry could almost see that aristocratic nose raised in proud superiority.  While once such a pose would have infuriated him, Harry now felt only amusement as he imagined this expression he knew so well turned on the world.
“But we lost it,” Harry mouthed along.  It did not take a genius to figure out what Malfoy was singing about.  While the beat was lively, the feel of the song was intense and filled with pain.  They were mourning what they had lost, what they had let slip away and even though the crowd did not understand like Harry did, looking around he saw that everyone in that club was mourning with them.
Malfoy continued in disjointed stops and starts as he struggled to explain.  “...on the stairs … I pushed him away … and then I ran.  I’m sure he thinks I’m not interested.”  There was a long pause.  “Did he tell you what he was going to do?”
“What?”
Draco snatched one up.  “Are they a hot mess?  Can we officially kick him off the tour?”
Ron shook his head. “Yeah, I can see that.  I wouldn’t have wanted to miss this either.”
“Really?”  Ron met his eyes for a moment and Harry could tell he was getting through.
The Gryffindor / Slytherin game was fantastic.  It had been a while since Harry had the pleasure of just sitting and watching.  As a professional Quidditch player, Harry had a much greater appreciation for the strategy of the game and the mates he currently played with outclassed anything he had achieved as a student at Hogwarts.  But the raw energy the students displayed on the field was infectious and the excitement of the crowd addicting.
“Like that will save any of them from the wrath to come.”  Fred added with a smirk.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Ron is there,’ Harry reassured himself even as he weaved in and out of traffic on the bike.
There was nothing Harry could think of to stop him.  “I’ll see you at the game,” he called after him.  Malfoy waved once and was gone.
“No!  Ummm…. I mean….” Harry dropped his head into his hands.  “Can we start this conversation over?”
There was someone at the drums.
Draco shook his head and wiped off the tears of mirth and panic from his face.  “Of course.  Of course you would think it is a spell.  You and Robards.”
“He … Fred alone … always means trouble,” Draco stuttered.
Harry just nodded and with a wave, Ron allowed himself to be pushed away from the pit area.
“Why do you care what I think?” Pansy asked him with a narrow-eyed look.
Harry was laying out flat on the marble of the grand entrance of the tour bus, his head cushioned in Draco’s lap.  While he appreciated the elegance of the floor, it wasn’t very comfortable, no matter how tempted he was by his pillow.  Ron and the band members were seated around him on the floor.  Harry groaned again as he tried to sit up and Ron and Draco reached out to help.  “That wasn’t Rookwood.”
Rookwood had been talking to the bus driver.  The bus driver had the itinerary for the entire tour, including … including the timing of the four hour trip to Edinburgh they were making right now.
This horror of a future awoke in Ron a burning desire to go home, to sit at the Burrow with his Mum yelling in the kitchen with people charging through and laughing, friends and family and all of them with a warm smile, a practical joke and a sincere joy to see him.  The feeling was overwhelming.
“Fine work like yours should be rewarded,” Shacklebolt pushed forward with his politician grin.  “How would you feel about a promotion?”
“I understand being angry, I mean Malfoy’s been known to push me right to the edge a time or two, but Robards is the Head Auror!  He can’t let his personal feelings get caught up in the job like this.  This erratic behavior… it’s going to drive people to do something stupid … it’s already making things harder than it needs to be even if he is right and the band is enchanting people.”
“Sure he did,” Neville said, his smile growing.  “Especially since he knew if he had denied our request, we’d have had the right to take it directly to the Minister of Magic.”
“I will have you all safe.”  Miriam said, warming to her new subject.  “And Harry Potter is the best in the business.  Aren’t you Harry?”
“What’s going on?”
“It just always feels like we’re on the outside looking in, you know?  No matter how many battles we fight, or how many times we take the high ground and try to do the right thing...”
“Robards sent them a howler.”
“Being the head of Slytherin house has its perks.”  The professor's tone was polite but his body was posed for flight.
“Well,” Blaise leaned back on the piano bench.  “You know wines and food.”
“I try really hard to stay out of whatever Fred and George are up to whenever possible.”
“No, I got Sirius’ old flying motorbike.  It’s been a while since I’ve had a chance to ride it and it’s a nice drive north.”
Draco’s expression was heartbreakingly hopeful.  “Would you be my date for the Yule ball?”
Was that a dragon?  The thought stopped Draco in his tracks.  The sound of fighting had him spinning back around to the clearing.  Wizards were pouring out of the woods surrounding them, many with Auror’s robes, even more it seemed with the bright red hair that could only be grown by Weasley’s.  The scared teenagers were putting up very little resistance.
Just when Harry thought he knew what to expect, the song changed. The soft lyrical tones that had overlaid the driving beat suddenly changed to something hard and fierce. Pansy ripped the microphone away from Malfoy and started rapping at an intense pace.
Arthur walked out with them, his chest almost bursting with pride as he watched them go.  Just before they got to the edge of the clearing where they could Apparate he called out “You might check with Charlie about the camera.  He wasn’t using Muggle equipment, but a while back he was taking pictures of the Dragon preserve for the Daily Prophet.  He might be able to help.”
Pansy gave him a confused look.
Blaise’s brow creased in thought.
“The darkness bled us out,” Malfoy sang back.
A pointed smile in Weasley’s weather-beaten face said he could guess at least some of what Draco was feeling about his ‘little lady’ and was more than a bit amused.  Draco had been a Malfoy too long not to respond.
Harry stared at Ron dumbfounded as the rest of the pieces slotted together.  “You want to set me up with Draco Malfoy!”
Taking down Voldemort as a teenager did not necessarily mean he was the best security in the business, but he wasn’t going to argue the point.  As the conversation with Draco seemed to be well and truly over for the moment it did give him an excellent out.  “I’d best get to it then,” he said, getting up.  It wasn’t even remotely a lie.  Since Robards seemed to be of no value there were a few favors Harry needed to call in and a manhunt to organize.
“Listen, a bunch of us have ordered supper.  Why don’t you come join us?  Bring your work with you.  No need to stop just to eat.”
He left the Headmistress’s office frustrated and headed off to find Ron.  Coming to the end of yet another empty corridor he heard voices.
“We need to tell him about the howler though.  Sending us to go investigate something that he could justify is suspicious is one thing, but sending Malfoy and the band that howler … there is no justification for that, all that does is make them feel threatened.”
“Actually, there was something else,” Ron said.  “We need a Muggle camera.  I seem to remember you picked one up a year or so ago.”
Pansy and Draco both chuckled.  “Come on, you two,” Draco said, breaking the stasis and heading off towards the lot where the bus was parked.  “I’ll let you judge for yourself whether Pansy needs more room than what she has on the tour bus.”
Harry had never had the opportunity to root for Malfoy, always on the other side of a bitter confrontation, whether Quidditch or House Points or … well everything.  But, things were different here.  The Slytherin was Harry’s classmate and fellow wizard and Malfoy his and his success was something that would reflect on him too.  Harry was truly hoping Robards was wrong, that the Slytherins were not cheating the system, but had found a way to excel despite everything that had been stacked against them.
“Honestly, I don’t know why you even bothered with the camera.  What, are you so determined to ruin us that if you can’t prove we’re criminals you’ll just do shitty work with the promotional pictures just to take us down.  I knew that Robards would do absolutely anything to see us fail, and maybe I am naive but seeing you here trying to undermine us was a shock.  You two were supposed to be all about justice and protecting people.  This shows who you really are.  Willing to do anything to destroy those who are different.  Just prejudicial bullies.”
“Hu?”  Harry leaned back against his seat again, his face contemplative.  “They are playing with Petrification?  Why?”
I rock forward on my heels to step when another man bursts out of the doors behind Malfoy.
“It’s not like we were dumb enough to tell him what we were doing,” Fred puffed out his chest proudly.
Draco shook his head.  “He’s a Legilimens expert, taught the subject at one point.  He attacked her mind, so he was looking for something, searching for something he thinks she knows that he needs.”
“Darling, we don’t have enough people for a band.” Pansy objected.
But Draco’s ire was not limited to his old rival.  Blaise got more social interaction than he was really up for just being on the stage and spent the rest of every day hidden away in his room playing his piano, which was enough to send Draco into an outrage as that removed his only viable partner in misery.
“And how is Neville doing?”  Harry asked.  “I haven’t seen him since the announcement.”
Everyone poured back into the center area as the lights dimmed. Harry found himself holding his breath. Bodies moved in the darkness. A hush fell over the whole club as they all waited.
Draco opened his mouth but the sound of the door banging open cut him off.
Malfoy turned back, squaring his shoulders.  The way his old rival prepared himself for battle was as known to Harry as his own.  “This is not like when you were here, Potter,” Malfoy hissed.  “Slythern has already beaten Gryffindor once this year.”
“... As a band tour manager.”
“Oh, I won’t be doing this for very long,” Ron waved the offer away.  “I am just trying to get on top of the paperwork.  You know, just putting a few extra hours in at the beginning to help ease into this.”
“It’s so frustrating.”  Harry said, dragging his hands through his hair.  “What was he doing here?  This obviously isn’t a base of operations or someone would have seen something.  Even forget-me-not charms miss occasionally.
“Hey, I had the high ground.”  It was a weak defense at best.
“I’m looking forward to that more.”
“Blimey,” Ron breathed.
“You already said that,” Draco reminded him from where he sat on the other side of the room.  The blond’s eyes were squeezed shut as he pinched the brow of his nose.
For those of you who have read Passion in Paris you can skip the first section of this if you want as it is a repeat, but don't miss the section at the end which is new.
“I’ve got it too.  Middle child syndrome.  And boy, you’re getting it from all sides.  Middle child at home, middle child between Harry and Hermione, it’s hard to figure out how to stand out when it feels like everyone else has a leg up.”
The words were lost to Harry, but the anger and passion was not. He snapped shot after shot of the amazing energy that was Pansy and then turned his camera to the crowd as he realized how many of them knew every word, mouthing, singing, screaming along with her as she drove them into an even greater frenzy of energy and passion.
Someone came up behind her and slipped an arm through hers.  A sharp jab of a something in her ribs, too sharp to be a finger (a wand?), a threatening whisper “not a word, little miss,” and then she was being shuffled into an alley.  Never one to do as she was told, Pansy immediately dragged in a huge lungful of air and screamed at the top of her lungs.
“So’s Draco,” and they both giggled like school children, their foreheads pushed together.
“When he asks me to.”  The two men exchanged smiles.  He had said ‘when’ not ‘if’ because he was settled on making this happen.  Whatever was causing Malfoy’s obvious reluctance, Harry was determined to overcome it.  If Ron and Malfoy could be friends, surely the two of them could be something more.
“Why don’t you go find Ms. Lockhart?” Harry upped his volume.
“No,” Draco said, the same thing he had been saying from the beginning when Greg mentioned going off on his own.
The young man’s head was down and tears were dripping silently off his chin.
Draco, the heir of the Malfoy estate, arch rival of the great Harry Potter himself.
The opening act closed up after another song and everyone took a moment to catch their breath.  The crowd dispersed a bit and people wandered off to get drinks as the crew started re-arranging the instruments and equipment on the stage.
Pansy smiled.  “Well, you best come in then.”
“What does that have to do with Petrification?” Ron asked.
“He seems a bit reluctant,” Harry tried again.
It is Robards.  Gawain Robards, head of the Aurors.  I push myself back into the darkness.  Despite the painful magical illness that saps Robards mind and strength, he is a formidable adversary, especially here.  Young Malfoy also recognizes the threat and turns, refusing to leave his back unprotected.  That Malfoy sees Robards as a threat pleases me.
They were both dressed in usual club fair.  Harry wore a black mesh shirt, black leather duster and pants while Ron was in tight levi’s and a flowing white shirt.  Both men were picking up some interest and Harry found himself tossing out a smile and a wink at a couple of girls as he passed.  It was fun and harmless and it had been a while since Harry had an opportunity for either.
“Your dating one of the groupies?” Draco collapsed back into his chair, his legs failing to hold him up.
Draco smiled at his own foolishness and he began to walk once again.  The tightness in his chest easing as he indulged in the memory of what it was to be rescued by the great Harry Potter.
Ron’s head came up from where it was resting against Pansy.  “Sir?”
She hummed, gently touching the flower pedals.  Ron knew he was not out of the woods, but he could not help thinking this was a good sign.  “So what are you going to do now?”
“Oops,” Blaise responded to Draco with a cheeky grin and the laughter picked up even louder than before.  “We’re not playing Phantom today are we?”
“What?!” Ron yelled again.
The tone and submissive stance worked.  Malfoy’s posture eased out of combat mode and his brow creased in confusion.  “Well, I guess we will see.”  He shifted a bit in discomfort.
Harry found himself responding and a desire greater than he had ever experienced before rode him. He wanted to catch Malfoy’s wild hair in his fingers and suck the sweat from his neck. It took all of his self control to stop himself from leaping up on that stage and dragging Malfoy’s body against his own. All Harry’s loss and pain seemed to shift as he watched that beautiful body move. He wanted with a strength and passion that shook him to the core. Of all the crazy, adrenaline filled, death defying things Harry had done in his life, nothing felt quite like standing in that packed club, caught up in the magic of wanting Draco Malfoy.
“Some of the stuff he is using I didn’t even know was flammable,” Ron said, looking back over his shoulder at the tech who was still watching them.
“McGonagall is going to kill them one of these days.”  Hogwarts tended to be right in the middle of the blast radius of whatever Fred and George were up to and the new Headmistress had more than one new grey hair to show for it.  “Well, George anyway.”  The two friends shared a grin.  “Is he still dating the new flying instructor?”  Harry asked and then winced at how he had unintentionally brought the conversation back around to dating.
“Bribed,” Ron corrected, a bit sheepish.
” the crowd responded.
Greg was confused how any of this related to music, or even getting them jobs, but Draco was obviously getting excited and he felt his hopes rise.
“No thanks.  I’m going to spend some time working with the camera.  Assuming Lockhart lets us stay, I’ll like to feel a bit more like I knew what I was doing.”
“Of course, Harry.”  Draco replied.
In that moment, they were children.  This was one of the joys of a friendship that had developed over years.  Something would happen and they would be back in time, sharing memories without words and feeling content in each other's company.
“I don’t understand, why are you going in as a photographer in the first place.  It’s not like they won’t know who you are and why you are there?  Robards is not subtle about his dislike and your being an Auror isn’t a secret.”
“I don’t suppose you want to take a break and come hang out with us as we chase Malfoy all over the UK,” Ron asked his brother as Harry clicked happily away.
There in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the magical hospital, Pansy tugged on Ron until he bent down into range.  Then she leaned up and laid her lips on his.  It was a chaste kiss, but the tingles and joy that burst along her skin were as intense as anything she had ever felt.  She pulled back and smiled at his dazed look.  “Thank you,” she said softly.
“Junior.  Senior seems to be pretty quiet in Azkaban these days since the breakout.  Although according to Robards, that’s its own conspiracy.  He’s sure there is some deep dark secret as to why Lucius did not go with the other two Death Eaters, Rookwood and Dolohov I believe it was, when they made their escape.”
Draco could not help his own amused grin.  “How did you find us so quickly?”
The emotion that flashed across Malfoy’s face was painfully familiar.  Anger.  What had Harry said?
Draco led him to a large cherry wood room, with golden mandalas carved on the walls and ceiling.  The room itself was dominated by a large bar with two high leather chairs.  It was just perfect for a cosy chat pulled up to the bar being served the latest fashion in Wizarding Alcohol.
“No, no.  You boys run along and do what you’re told.  It won’t hurt anything to check and maybe take the time to build some bridges while you are there.”
Rookwood tossed Draco a hard look over his shoulder before heading off towards the drop off.  “Bring him along, Antonin.”
“It’s no more than you deserve,” Harry responded as though it wasn’t such an unbelievable thought that Slytherins that had got caught up in Voldemort’s web still deserve respect.
The smile that spread on Draco’s face was every bit as ridiculous as Harry’s.  “Yes.”  So much for either of them being composed.
Harry looked like he was gritting his teeth in frustration.  “Look, do whatever you are going to do Robards, but I will not help you undermine Malfoy’s success and you can be sure I am going to stick close enough to them to make sure no one else does either.”
There was silence as they digested this.
“Occasionally we make exceptions.”
“I’m familiar with Dolohov,” Charlie mused.  “Big burly guy, they used to call him Mr. Farmer.  Loved violence just for the sake of watching someone bleed and was one of the strongest duelers ever to go through Hogwarts.”
“I didn’t think Slytherins ever did anything as undignified as raving,” Harry teased.
“I don’t have anything against Malfoy,” Harry instantly defended.
“On the contrary, they are …”
A jolt of pleasure shot through Harry when the beautiful man in front of him glanced down from his eyes to his mouth and back.  Harry leaned forward, working his way closer to those tempting lips.  It was getting difficult to remember what they were talking about but he was desperate to keep the conversation going, to draw this moment out as long as he could.  “Fred could be visiting Peeves.  Aren’t they friends?”
“Yes,” Rookwood said.  “Very clever, that spell of yours.  I admit you have successfully hidden it, even from me.”
It was a bit of a shock when Charlie stepped in front to defend him.  “What are you talking about Robards?  He was kidnapped.  We all saw the Death Eaters threaten him as we moved into position, and as I recall his response was pretty clear.”
Harry took a deep breath and acknowledged this new desire that burned in his gut was also perfectly natural. He had broken up with Ginny when he realized neither of them felt the passion they should for the other. Admitting his past interest in Malfoy, his archrival, had never been purely irritation or even platonic had been a first step to accepting his own sexuality. Now he was forced to accept that his feelings ran even deeper.
“I have this thing about Norwegian Ridgebacks,” Harry said, not the least bit embarrassed about the fact he was cringing away from the Dragon.  “It probably comes from the time one tried to eat me.”
McGonagall narrowed her eyes at both of them.  “You two are not getting this back.  Hagrid, come help Mr. Weasley here transport Peeves to the infirmary.”
“Yes,” Ron agreed.  “Pansy says he is really nice these days.”
Thank you to everyone for their support!  I will reply to every comment, I treasure every kudo, and I thank everyone for reading.
Ron greeted Malfoy casually.  It wasn’t a surprise to Harry.  His best friend's relationship with Pansy had led to Ron and Draco to put aside old grievances and become better acquainted.  The easy intimacy that had sprung up between them was a bit disconcerting to Harry, especially here of all places where so much of the animosity in their past had occurred.
Rookwood tisked him again before moving away.  “We will get it from you eventually,” he said in that same conversational tone that was all the more threatening for it’s mildness.  He stopped next to Harry who had managed to sit up.  Harry glared up at him, the git, defiant to the end.  “The only question, my dear Draco, is how much are you willing to lose before we do.”
“Build bridges?!” Ron squaked.  “With Malfoy?”
‘When I feel that way about someone, the way you feel about Mrs. Weasley, that’s when I’ll propose.” Harry found himself saying.
Fred and George exchanged a look.  “Too soon,” they both concluded, as if their reference to the late Headmaster was the problem.  Then they exchanged a number of incomprehensible hand gestures.  McGonagall was already heading out of the dining hall at full speed and Fred took off after her.  Harry had the suspicion that this was not the last they would hear of that eye.
“Hmm,” Malfoy nodded.  He was still staring off after the ghost.  “Angelina Johnson, yes.”  He sounded distracted.  When Malfoy returned his gaze to Harry, he could tell the professor's attention was still on the ghost.
The fury in Robards face is delicious.
“Rock and a hard place,” Ron muttered as they stepped out of the Floo at the burrow and Harry had nodded in agreement.  “Dad!”
There would be no denial or putting this off, Harry was too self aware for any of that nonsense.
“What?!” Ron yelled again.
“Oh yes, of course it’s over … well it was … did I put it …”  Arthur’s voice faded out as he disappeared into the never ending piles of stuff.  “Ah ha!  Found it!  And Molly says I can’t find anything in here.”  Arthur put the black box like item into Ron’s outstretched hands.
We watched others bleed and die
Fred nodded as he passed and the two of them nodded back.  When the ghost is out of earshot, Harry took advantage of the situation to slide closer and lowered his voice.  “Doesn’t Fred normally come with George?  I mean, isn’t George here quite a bit to visit… what’s her name … the new flying instructor?”
‘He is the Auror, not me.  He’ll know what to do.’  Harry repeated over and over even as he frantically looked for any hidden corner where he could disappear and take the bike skyward.
Thank you to everyone for your patience, comments, and support.
“Those aren’t bad,” Ron said several minutes later as they went through Harry’s collection of Norberta.  “A couple are pretty good actually.”
“We’ve got keyboard, guitars, vocals….” Blaise mused.  “We need a drummer and we might just pull this off.”
They pushed forward until they were right at center stage, fairly close up in the mosh pit of pressed bodies bouncing to the music of the band opening for ‘Sly’.
That the two of them were both single again was going to take a bit of getting used to. Although Harry was pretty sure it would be a while before Ron was ready to start anything new, he could not help thinking about what the future might look like.  There would be new people in their lives.  Harry wondered who they were, what they would look like and where they would find them.
“Go! Find! Miriam!” Harry bellowed back.
The ensuing silence was awkward as Ron figited and Harry tried to come up with a new topic of conversation.  “What are Fred and George up to these days?”
“If you are here to arrest us on spurious charges do it.  Otherwise get out.” Pansy pointed to the door
“The youngest ever to hold that position, I hear.”
“No joke.  Even Hermione….”  The lighthearted feeling that had developed in the room disappeared in an instant at the mention of her name.
“No.  I mean yes, I’ve really enjoyed taking pictures and I’d love to keep the camera.  I can pay your dad whatever he thinks it is worth.”
“No mate.  When Harry gets going on Quidditch these days it's all technical jargon.  Ruins the game if you ask me.  I prefer to sit in the stands and cheer.”
“Still going on about the same old topic?” Harry asked.
“Oh you’ll love this.  I guess everyone just assumed they wouldn’t be able to find any work worth doing and so no one thought to limit what kind of job they could take.  As long as they weren’t using magic and could prove they were working regularly there were no other stipulations.”
“Yeah.”  Harry said, but his heart was not in it.  Shaking himself firmly, Harry turned to face his friend.  “Any luck?”
“Barely,” Harry cringed back as the dragon stepped closer.  Ron, great friend that he was, managed to keep Harry firmly between him and the Dragon.  It felt like a repeat of the trip to visit Hagrid’s spiders.
Eventually, Harry’s mind drifted back to Hermione.  He was worried about how the two of them would fit now that she and Ron had broken up.  He worried about her career and how passionate she was about it, really to the exclusion of all else.  Robards came to mind and his passionate obsession with Malfoy.  Would Hermione’s focus on her work lead to similar obsessions?  He did not want to think of her like that, tried to tell himself that she would never do such a thing, but still he was worried.
With McGonagall gone, the snickers and giggles grew in volume as Peeves was lifted and carried from the hall.  There was also a smattering of applause as George passed and he took a moment at the doors to bow to the crowd.  Cheers broke out and a few people stomped their feet in approval.  Harry allowed himself a smile.
“Hmm… I hate to cause trouble, especially with all that the poor man has gone through, what with his skin condition and the constant pain he must be in, but …. well it just seems to me that trying to head up the Aurors might be a bit much for him.  I’ll chat with Kingsley.  He’s been run off his feet as the new Minister of Magic but I think he’ll appreciate a heads up.”
Just when Draco was sure the day could not get worse.  Robards stormed towards them, red face and bellowing.  “You are outnumbered and surrounded!”
Ron raised his eyebrows at that and Draco shrugged.  “They’re Malfoy Manor elves.  I did ask for volunteers, but it turned into a fight about who would have to stay home with mum.  They all wanted to come.”
“I know,” Harry said pulling Ron back into a hug.
Ron wasn’t even bothering to contain his snickers.  Malfoy raised a distinguished eyebrow when Harry looked his way, his straight face too bland to be real.  Harry had to bite his lips not to lose himself in rather unmanly giggles.
After the remains of the food fight were banished or consumed they would usually lay listening to Pansy work on her rapping while Greg provided the beat, Harry and Draco would go back to their fascination with each other's mouths and Blaise would abandon them all for his piano.  Sometimes Ron would think of that dark refectory and its occupants shushing each other if they made too much noise.  On those nights, when the band finally crashed as the first streams of daylight were peeking in the window, Ron would take a moment to pen an owl to Hermione.
Another long silence had Harry wanting to move back to take another look around the corner.
Dolohov banged him up against the bus again.
Ron found himself gazing into pale blue eyes, inches from his own.  When he spoke again, his tone carried the weight of a serious confession.  “So am I.”
“If you could get us out of this waste of time assignment that would be awesome,” Ron perked up at the thought but Arthur shook his head.
Harry took a step back and tripped over Ron.  Harry glared and Ron held up his hands in surrender.  “Sorry.”
He opened his mouth to speak, to lie and posture and do anything necessary.
That part was a preplanned and carefully coached declaration.  Now Ron was on his own to respond as best he could to whatever Pansy threw at him, (hopefully not literally).  Even Draco, curled up next to Harry on one of the lumpy Burrow sofas, had been unable to predict how Pansy would react, although he did warn that he should be prepared to duck.
Rookwood had been talking to the bus driver.  The bus driver had the itinerary for the entire tour, including … including the timing of the four hour trip to Edinburgh they were making right now.
It hurt!
They all looked at each other.  Greg closed one eye and squinted hoping it would make it easier to see them as a band.  It did not help.
George had the grace to look sheepish even as he started in on their defense..  “You said we couldn’t prank the students during mealtimes but you didn’t say anything about the other inhabitants of the castle.”
“Speaking of girlfriends and dating,” Ron said, obviously trying to regain control of the conversation.
She looked up as Ron dropped down in front of her.
The feelings were real and powerful and addicting.  Harry was swept up in the song, mourning opportunities missed, things that got left behind and lost along the way.  It did not matter that his losses were different from Malfoy’s.  The true genius of the song was that it didn’t matter.  ‘Come mourn with me,’ the song seemed to say, ‘and we will be stronger as we mourn together.’
“And you had to drag me with you because … ?”
“Ron, he said … well he said that Harry had a crush on you.  I didn’t believe him at the time, but looking at these pictures, I think he was right.”
“Only when he was grossly outnumbered and struggling to defend us as well as take you all on,” Draco snapped back and then wanted to bite his tongue.  What was he doing?  Antagonising their captures would not help them get through this.  The part of Draco that had always put his head down and did what he was told was screaming at him to simply agree to anything they asked.  It took a moment, as Dolohov growled at him and Rookwood continued to watch with eyes that saw too much, for Draco to realize that deep inside of him, the little boy who had always dreamed of being friends with Harry Potter, the part of him that had bloomed and preened under Harry's unexpected attention, that little boy was angry.
“Yes sir,” the young man said with a watery smile.
The poor boy was in tears by the time Harry finished what he needed to say.  “But you were a Gryffindor,” he sniffed.  “They said you would…”  The young man trailed off.
“Absolutely out of your mind, “ Ron grumbled again, but it was more of a shout now.  As they fought their way towards the stage, it became an increasing struggle to be heard over the noise of the speakers right in front of them.  “Hey, don’t you want to get higher up so you can see more of the stage?”
“Wait, no!”  Harry objected loudly to being called the very thing he had worked his whole life to stand against.  “That’s not what is going on at all!”
Harry righted a chair next to Draco and plopped down into it.  “Any thoughts on what they might want?”  He tried to keep his question kind.  Draco looked stressed enough for both of them.  The blond just shook his head.
“Here mate, how are you feeling?”
Pansy rushed to Ron, throwing her arms around him as he groaned.  Draco spared them a glance before he staggered to his feet and stumbled, unwilling and more than a bit panicked, towards the edge of the steep drop off.
” the crowd responded.
I slip away through the shadows.
There was someone at the drums.
“Naw,” George protested and then Fred corrected, “well yeah, someone alive maybe.  But not a ghost.  It just petrifies ghosts.”
Draco pushed all of it away as he danced, allowing himself to get lost in the music.  Here he was another anonymous face in the crowd, here he could vent his pain and fear and sorrow in the dance, here he had nothing to hide, he could just be.  His movements were wild and out of control, a perfect imitation of all that was going on inside of him.
Harry turned his head as Fred floated by.  Sometimes it still caught him off guard, that Fred was dead.  The Weasley ghost was a pale, washed-out version of his embodied self but his expression had not changed.  He wore the overly innocent look of mischief in progress.  It was such a common expression for both Fred and George that Harry did not understand what caused Malfoys reaction.
Ron shook his head as Harry tried to salvage this, “That’s not what’s going on,” he protested.
Pansy pushed him up against a wall to get his attention.  It was an obvious effort pushing his much larger frame around even though he wasn’t resisting her.  “Look, what are you doing here.  Surely you’ve had enough time to manufacture whatever evidence Robards wants you to plant.  Why aren’t you off with your girlfriend.”
“Molly is a good woman, bless her, but she doesn’t have a timid or shy bone in her body.  One of the reasons I fell in love with her, to be honest.”  Arthur beamed, every inch the proud husband.
“I mean taking the pictures, dummy,” Charlie glared.  “The image you get on a camera isn’t anything like what you see.  The lighting is different.  I almost always found I had to have more light than I thought on whatever part of the dragon I wanted to see.  And then having the camera pointed at just the right spot, ready to take the picture right when the dragon was in just the right place … I’m telling you, harder than it sounds.”
Miriam had warned them not to go out alone but Pansy knew for a fact that Draco snuck out before she did.  She had not gone more than a few blocks before she saw Ron and Harry out and about as well.  She waved, they waved back and she continued on her way.  She had too much to do before the city really woke up to allow a man to gum up the works, even one as cute as Ron.  Besides, it looked like Harry was on the hunt.  She was pretty sure she had seen Draco disappear in the same direction.
“I’ve had boyfriends like Hermione.  Draco was like that in school, always wanted me available when he needed someone hanging off his arm, otherwise I was just an obstacle in his quest to take down the great Harry Potter.”
Finally Ron cleared his throat. “You can rest in our B&B if you need a place to stretch out.”
“Waiting tables at some Muggle restaurant?  Terrific.”  Even Greg could not miss the sarcasm in Draco’s voice.
“You mean it will help keep my mind off of Hermione,” Ron said, cutting right to the heart of things.  He stared at the floor for several long moments as Harry watched, aching for his friend.  Then Ron took a deep breath.  “Yeah, alright.  Better than hanging around the Burrow moping I guess and I have to admit, the music ain’t half bad.”  Ron slapped the top of his thighs once and then stood up.  “Come on best friend ‘o mine, let’s see if we can get the ‘apple of your eye’ to forgive us for existing.”
“Do you want to sit?” Harry asked.
“No Blaise.” Malfoy’s voice was patronizing and teasing and charming as hell.
Pansy shrugged.  “Why do you think I learned how to rap?  Mother hates it, but when she’s yelling about it, at least I have her attention.”
“... but I really think if you just give this a chance…”
“Oh Draco,” Pansy breathed.  “These are breathtaking.”
“Rookwood, Dolohov, Malfoy, surrender now!”
He had made it a point to be in the audience, front and center for every performance.  Partly it was to keep an eye out for Rookwood, but he was also still the band photographer.  Taking pictures of Draco had become an obsession.  The way he moved was like grace personified, his arms raised above his head, his body bending and thrusting.  By the end of each concert, Draco was drenched in sweat and Harry needed to lock himself in a loo for some much needed relief before he was presentable.
Harry’s eyes flickered away so fast he almost missed it, tracking high over Draco’s left shoulder.  Then Harry smiled, a soft gentle thing that hurt to look at.  “Trust me.”
“I’m going to be in the Outer Hebrides, the archipelago north of Scotland for a bit.  If you make it that far north, let me know.”
“Well,” Miriam sniffed, “if that’s true, I’m glad to hear it.”  She turned back to Harry without even missing a beat.  “If you are going to be here anyway I will expect you to personally ensure the safety of the band going forward.”  Harry found himself dizzy over the speed Miriam changed from threatening him to ordering him around.
“You’re trying to set me up with a guy,” Harry exclaimed.  He might not have gone into the Aurors but that did not mean he was slow at putting puzzle pieces together.
“Well, this is still your assignment.”
“Now listen here Potter …” Robards started but Harry interrupted him.
“What?,” Ron struggled to stay on his feet pressed in between all of the bodies.  He was obviously miserable in the noise and the heat.
To pick back up scroll up to the first instance of 'oOo' and start from there.
” The crowd sang with him.
“A music band?” Greg clarified.
Harry had to admit to himself that he wasn’t listening when ducked down a deserted back street and finally got the bike in the air.
“Then why stay?”
Loud familiar cords ripped through the quiet of the club. The unmistakable opening to Phantom of the Opera caught everyone off guard, grabbing attention as the unexpected sounds resonated through every chest.
“Harry, you coming?” Ron tossed over his shoulder, already on the move.
“Have you seen any fireplaces on this bus, Weasley?”
For those who skipped the first section of this chapter here is a summary of events:
“By not happening at all.”  It was Harry’s turn to interrupt.
Ron shifted the parchment over so his best friend could see.  “Yeah.  The owl dropped it off this morning.”
“You mean without the original caster’s wand?”  Draco clarified and both Ron and Harry rolled their eyes.  Suddenly they weren’t missing Hermione so much after all.
Draco sat up.  Harry pulled his hand back, expecting another rejection.  Instead, he found himself with an arm full of warm Malfoy.  “Hold me.”
Ron scratched the back of his head and squinted at him before sighing and giving in. “We're supposed to be doing things the Muggle way ... but, as long as no one finds out, I’m not sure what harm it will do.”
Harry walked away, frustrated.  “Why am I doing Ron’s job again?” he asked himself even as he started stopping people in the halls to show the picture.  Despite the frustration, Harry knew why he was here.  The image of a pair of grey eyes, lit up in relief when Harry said he believed him, kept him going.  He and Draco had done little more than wave at each other in passing, between the band schedule and Harry’s hunt for the escaped Death Eaters.
Harry, Ron and the Sly band take on Death Eaters, scared teenagers and job offers.
“Mine too.”
It was quiet for a bit, both men lost in their own thoughts.  Harry broke it to carefully recommend, “You should take some time off from the Aurors, get your head together.”
The Beater nodded.
“‘Ms. Parkinson’, listen to you.  It’s obvious the whole thing was staged, faked to encourage your sympathies.  I can’t go sending Aurors after every random lovers quarrel.  I’ve already got Shacklebolt breathing down my neck about those two missing Death Eaters.”
It was at that moment the doors to the dining hall burst open.  Every head turned to see Peeves tumble in, careening out of control and moving way too fast with Fred Weasley right on his heels.  The two ghosts shot across the room with students screaming and scrambling to get out of the way.  Everyone at the head table, including Harry, Ron and Draco were on their feet, wands in hand.
“Come in!  Come in!  Look what I have.  One of the guys at the office got it for me.  It’s a Muggle electric salad bowl.”  Arthur beamed with excitement as he held the item out for their inspection.
It was hard to see someone else getting something that you wanted desperately.  Harry Potter knew that feeling better than most.  He would have to keep an eye on that kid.  A young man capable of staring heartbreak in the face and still maintaining his dignity might also have the strength to fix his seat on his broom after years of doing it wrong.  Yes, Harry would definitely need to keep an eye out.  Smiling, Harry resumed his trek towards the Slytherin team.
“You told Robards that you were going to investigate Pansy’s attacker yourself.”
Harry nodded, eager to hear what came next, trying to keep his face serious and not giggle.
Hoping to inspire a little intimacy, Harry shifted even closer and lowered his voice.  “Do you think Fred is up to something?”
Ron knew something, he could tell.  Harry grinned and wiggled a bit forward in his seat.  Talking about Ron’s brothers was almost always fun and rarely serious.
“I have no idea.”
“Yeah, okay,” Harry said, going back to running his fingers through his hair.  “I still think we should keep your dad up to speed though.  Never know when that could come in handy.”
“More explosions?”  Harry held his ground, sad as he watched Malfoy continue to pull away.
“Maybe we should just give this up as a bad job.  I mean, you were testing too, right?  There was no magic during the whole concert.  Seriously, this whole thing is a waste of time.”
“Be careful,” warned George.  He handed over his burden, a carefully wrapped something about the size of a pumpkin.  “Don’t unwrap it.”
“He’s the one that killed Remus, in the final battle” Harry said, his voice breaking a bit.
Living with a band on tour was its own form of hell: road food, little sleep, constant demands and a new crisis of the day that always seemed to hit right about meal time.  Ron’s favorite part was late at night, or early morning rather, after a concert, when they were all high on adrenaline.  Greg would be showing off his new muscles to whoever was stupid enough to be watching, while Blaise threw food at him.  Harry and Draco would be making out while Blaise threw food at them.  Pansy would be curled up at his side rating Blaise’s current toss, usually badly, until Ron’s laughter drew Blaise’s fire at which time Pansy would return the food with what even Blaise acknowledged was deadly accuracy.
There was no one to save them this time.
“Normally I would expect Neville Longbottom to keep the two of you in check.” McGonagall sighed.
At the very least, moments with Draco Malfoy were always interesting.
“They were all bad,” Blaise said.
“Oh terrific,” Pansy didn’t even lose a beat in her rant.  “Just want we need.  The great Harry Potter to save the day.  Come to rescue the poor Muggles from the evil Slytherins, Potter?  Come to show us all how wrong we are with your big bad self?  Rub it in our faces again how your lot won and we lost and we should be properly grateful and throw ourselves at your feet?”
Harry changes his mind and Draco is suspicious of more that just Harry.
“Ron!”
“Alright?” Harry asked again, leaning down to catch Ron’s eyes.
Ron would send the owl off with extra treats as an apology for the early hour before climbing into bed with Pansy for a few hours before the crazy life he had chosen would drag him back out again.  Despite this, or maybe because of it, Ron would more often than not fall asleep with a smile.
“Nothing,” Ron said with a shrug.  “Even less about Muggle photography, excepting that my dad probably has a Muggle camera around somewhere I can borrow.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed at her but before he could follow up, Greg burst in through the bus door singing full out.  “Oh what a beautiful morning!  Oh what a beautiful day!”  He was off key, one arm swept out in front of him as he danced across the room.  “I have a date!” he yelled as he got into the center of the room.
It was obvious that Draco was still reluctant, but Pansy did not have the strength to do anything but put her faith in Ron.
“It packs a strong punch,” Draco warned when Harry took a larger sip
“We managed to take down the great Harry Potter, didn’t we?”  Dolohov growled, kicking Harry in the ribs and back down onto his back.
“What does that leave?” Draco asked, when the two of them separated.
It took a while to settle again.  Ron finally picked up the thread of their conversation.  “I hear the friendship between the three of them has cooled off since then and I have to say I’m grateful.
“And then ate it for breakfast.”
Reality passed at a different pace when kissing Harry.  When they finally parted to the sound of a throat being cleared, Draco had no idea if it had been minutes, hours or years since he last took a breath.  Shacklebolt had returned with Robards and several others had wandered over, creating quite the little audience they had been performing for.  Ron and Pansy were beaming at them as was Arthur, while Charlie was once again red-faced and trying to find somewhere else to look.
“What did Robards do now?” Harry asked, having heard too many rants about Ron's boss to be in any doubt who was involved.
Pansy waved him off, not even bothering to respond but Draco sat up straighter in his seat.  “Wait, … isn’t … what was that Professor’s name, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher … the bad one.”
“He tossed your unconscious body at the door and walked away.” Blaise said.  He was sitting with his head down resting on his knees, as though if he could not see anything maybe the problem would go away.  Harry knew the feeling.
“Out of the mess of what remains of the library.”
“We had a library?” Goyle asked.
“No she does not,” Ron protested.  “I work hard not to have any kind of history with man eating monsters.  I got enough of that in school.”  Harry nodded his head in agreement.
“Still, that was a completely different lady altogether,” Charlie waved the other away.  “This pretty girl here has her own history with the two of you.”
Charlie shrugged and glanced back towards the others and was watching when Ron, finally relieved of his burden, limped purposefully towards the bus.  Pansy ran to meet him.  Charlie flushed red and looked away from the resulting enthusiastic physical display.
“I quit.”
“That’s right, Augustus Rookwood.”  Ron said.  “You’d know him if you saw him, I think.  He’s got pockmarks and scars all over his face.  Loves mental games, twisting you up in your own mind ‘til you don’t know which way is up.  I think he got picked up after the battle.  Didn’t the Malfoy’s tip the Aurors off on where to find him?”
“Where on earth…?”  McGonagall held it at arm's length.
” Malfoy sang back.
We didn’t fight
“Ah no sir, that was…” Ron was waving a hand in Charlie’s direction even as Pansy was shaking her head, sensing like Draco had, exactly where this was going.
I am here collecting.  Voldemorts followers have been scattered to the wind.  Many ended up in Azkaban, myself included, but I had been the means of escape from that place once before.  This time, I brought only one of my fellow inmates with me; a small force compared to my last jailbreak.  Others have joined.  Some willing, others less so.  I am here to continue collecting resources.  One jewel in particular shines like forbidden fruit.
“We are not talking about this,” Harry said firmly.
Bright grey eyes found his again.  Something about Malfoy’s face firmed and he shifted about until he was facing Harry fully.  Maybe this was it?  Harry shifted as well.  Their chests were inches apart and the air between them crackled.  Draco took a deep breath to speak.
Pansy just shook her head and walked away.  Her family held too many ministry positions for her not to know what taking this job meant.  Draco’s heart went out to her.
“That snake has been nothing but bones for years.” McGonagall stepped away, dodging George’s grab for the eye.
That wasn’t the response Harry had expected.  “No,” he said slowly, narrowing his eyes at his friend.
McGonagall caught up with Harry after the game.  Chatting with the Headmistress was always pleasant.  She took him up to her office where he greeted Dumbledore’s portrait and settled down in his favorite chair.  They talked about the game, Fred and George and her favorite students.
“She’s good.”  Harry clenched his hands to keep himself from reaching out to touch the wisps of fine hair that seemed to be floating in a halo around that handsome face.  It was too soon for that, he admonished himself.
Draco came up to him and pulled him out of the chair.  “Are you willing to learn?” he asked.
“Broke up with Hermione,” Ron mumbled.
“I swear it … and maybe …” He took a deep breath, less sure about how to say this next part but willing to stumble forward for a bit longer if it helped. “Maybe you’re not perfect for Hermione or maybe you just need time or … I don’t know.  But if you’re not, then there is someone else out there you are perfect for … someone who is perfect for you.  Whether that person is Hermione or maybe … maybe someone else … Look it doesn’t matter.  You just gotta … just hang in there, alright? Because you’re my best friend and you’re always going to be perfect at that.  Alright?”
“Getting up right before sunrise isn’t the middle of the night,” Harry shot back good naturedly, “ and the light is better first thing in the morning.”
“She dump you?” Pansy sounded more than a bit incredulous and Ron could not resist the small smile and the implied compliment.
I smile.  ‘Come to me, my little jewel.  I am waiting for you.’
Neville smiled.  “The boys and I are on ‘vacation’.”
“Everyone is going to be excited for the reprieve from Peeves and his pranks,” Ron said.  It was no doubt the subject everyone in the room was now discussing.
“Are you being purposefully obtuse?” Malfoy demanded.
Arthur smiled.  “Well, you let enough stuff come out of your mouth, eventually something falls out that’s of value.”  But Arthur’s cheeks were ruddy as Harry pulled the man who had become like a father to him into a hug.  Of course, Ron followed up with a hug of his own.
“Or dragon taming,” Ron agreed.  “Although it would be easier if the band in question wasn’t treating us like we’ve got the plague.”
For the first time Ron’s tone became firm, almost angry.  “You mean house prejudice.”
Ron was as good as his word.  He and Harry hovered over Pansy obsessively, making it very clear to anyone who even got close to her that she was important to them, and anyone who treated her with less than their best would answer to them.  Draco looked as dazed as Pansy felt as he got swept up in the whole procession.  He was called Mr. Malfoy in respectful tones by everyone after the first sneer resulted in Harry tearing into a poor nurse hard enough that the poor guy would probably feel his ears ringing for a week.
Ah, the sentence.  To have the details of Malfoy’s sentence delivered to me like a present is more than I could have hoped for.  It is delightfully insidious.  A year, working without magic among the Muggles.  I chuckle softly in delight.  A sentence designed to bring the spoiled Malfoy heir to his knees.  Young Malfoy has not been made to work a day in his life.  He has been taught to rely on magic and money to provide the best the world has to offer.  To be forced to find employment among Muggles strips from him the two things he has always relied upon.  It is a sentence designed with humiliation in mind.  From the anger in Malfoy’s face, he knows it.
“The bus driver for the band.  The bus driver for ‘Sly’.”
“She pull ten hour days pretty regularly?”
“You're a fine one to talk of consequences, you with your fine house and your rich friends.  But you’ll feel them now, yes you will.  When you are slaving away in the Muggle world, you will know what it feels like, brought low, just like your kind deserve.”
Draco met that brilliant gaze squarely.  “Augustus Rookwood.”
“No,” Draco breathed, backing away.  “No, no, no, no, no.”
“You’re not serious about any of them, are you?”
The mention of Hermione got Ron’s attention right quick.  He took a breath and shook his head.  “She’s not … we’re not together any more.”
The two of them stood together, sniffling the only sound in the room.  Finally Ron lifted his head and turned towards the old couch, Harry following and settling next to him.  “Do you want to talk about it.”
“Potter,” he breathed.
“Oh darling, that’s marvelous.  I’m so happy for you!”
“Alright Greg,” Malfoy said, not letting the energy of the moment die. “One more time for the cheap seats over there.”
Arthur’s smile was kind and understanding.  “Of course.  Your Mum loves you, but she can be a bit overwhelming when her plans fall through.  She did so have her heart set on Harry marrying Ginny and you marrying Hermione and all of you moving into the burrow to regularly pop out grandchildren for her to spoil.”
Neville shrugged.  “Do you want us to check the surrounding villages?”
Loud familiar cords ripped through the quiet of the club.  The unmistakable opening to Phantom of the Opera caught everyone off guard, grabbing attention as the unexpected sounds resonated through every chest.
He had not been dancing long when a pair of strong arms slid around him from behind and suddenly Draco’s dance became something else.  He did not look back, not wanting to break the spell being wrapped around him.  Where his hips and arms had been telling a story of brutal defiance against the world, now the form behind him echoed back a harmony of comfort and support.  Tenderly caressing hands softened his movements, never stopping or hindering.  The energy of the night changed from desperate denial to a calm so powerful, it swept everything else away.  Draco had not known until that moment how much he needed the calm he found in the arms of a stranger.
Surely there was some place he could find peace, a dream, a fantasy.  It did not have to be real.  Draco dug through this mind, trying to remember the last time he had allowed himself the simple pleasure of a wish.  He had been caught up in the wishes and dreams of others for so long; his mother’s, his father’s, Voldemort’s.  Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had a wish that was for himself alone.  It had to have been years ago, before Voldemort had ruined his life, before the war, before school, before Hogwarts.
At the drums, Goyle tapped out the beat …. One, two, three and they were off.
“It would be a great service to the magical community,” Shacklebolt pushed.
Harry dropped down into the chair next to him.  “Yeah.”
That Malfoy had struggled to accept Harry, that he had expected prejudice when there was none and that he had rejected Harry because of it, all of that probably should bother him.  It didn’t.  He had too much experience with prejudice himself not to understand what Draco faced.  Instead Harry was caught up in the fact that his old rival had admitted he was wrong.  Malfoy’s apology to Ron still rang in his ears.
“Ron, I …” Harry stuttered, unsure how to respond.  Ron walked up to him, dropping his forehead down to rest on Harry’s shoulder.  With Ron’s height, that could not have been comfortable but he did not move.  Harry tentatively wrapped his arms around his childhood best friend.  “I’m so sorry.”
“Aww … don’t listen to them, pretty girl.  They just don’t recognize you, is all,” Charlie cooed at the towering beast.  “‘Course you were quite a bit smaller last time they saw you.”
No, that was last time, with Dumbledore.
Robards started sputtering and Arthur laid a friendly hand on his shoulder even as he continued to defend Draco.  “We all heard him tell them no.  That was very clear.  Whatever they were trying to get him to do, and I’m sure the inquiry will provide those answers, he was very clearly resisting.”
“I went in this morning to ask for some time off.  I mean I need it right?”
With a wave she spread out something across the large wooden table in the center of the room.
“Draco,” Harry said softly.
“Yeah, he would never have helped us.”  George said.
“So did I.  Who knew taking pictures was such a dangerous profession?”
Harry groaned louder.  “Ron, no.”
“Harry?  Talk to me.”
Walking into the bus was like entering another world, one that neither Ron nor Harry had ever been a part of.  The white tiled floor with its tasteful mosaic seemed to repel the dirt from their shoes even as they walked across it.  The large crystal chandelier in the center of the arch way dominated vaulted ceilings of a height similar to those in the Great Hall at Hogwarts surrounded by intricate crown moldings.  Everything shimmered a pale gold and was open and bright, catching the morning sun from a series of windows across the ceiling that opened up into the heavens.  It was breath-taking.
“I … no .. I left her … I guess … but …” he stuttered.
