Molly produced a surprisingly big and clean handkerchief from one of her many pockets and handed it to the other woman. She took the wine glass from Andromeda at the same time, allowing her full usage of her hands. “I don’t know what is wrong with me… I just… Oh…” Andromeda mumbled as she dabbed her tears away with the handkerchief.
“...If you plan on keeping him, he must trim his beard before coming over for dinners. I can accept scruff for tea, but not dinner.”
Against his will, Harry found himself in a position where he wasn’t comfortable refusing the young woman. Thus, he retold most of the things to the stranger, speaking words which had previously been spoken by his boyfriend for the sake of protecting him from the feelings which came with the story. The talk caused physical reactions in Harry, he felt himself sweat but he only felt cold. His sentences would become unfocused every now and then, and his body began to tremble and shake the more he engaged with the topic.
Scrunching his nose against the unpleasant scent of burnt tobacco, Remus pulled a fallen chair up and took a seat next to his partner. The chair was cold, but not wet, which was at the very least a slight relief. Severus continued to face forward, not quite paying attention to him visually, although he was reading his mind, as always.
Molly, Professor Lupin and Professor Snape all sat silent in the wake of her words. Molly thought hard, not noticing that the two men silently laced their fingers together and held one another’s hand, forging a bond which was unique to them.
“Secondly,” Draco raised another finger, “for Fullblood or Halfblood families, there is usually an understanding that their children could be magical, but at least the Halfblood families tend to wait for some manner of sign that their children are magical before truly engaging in magical schooling. You can see how there is a difference in education there. Finally, there are the Muggle-born mages, whose parents are utterly incapable of helping them with anything magical, which places them at a one to nine years disadvantage when they arrive at Hogwarts. On top of that they are at a complete disadvantage as they often do not even have the slightest bit of understanding or knowledge of our society and existence to begin with.”
The Riddle estate, the place where he had killed for the very first time, rose around him like a cage, capturing his painful existence almost as effectively as it had when he had been a young, foolish orphan who had wrongfully through that he had finally found his father and his place in life. The Dark Lord did not enjoy the Riddle estate, yet he understood well that he was too weak to relocate. Such an act also risked discovery before he had returned to his full power, which was unacceptable. He had to return a powerful, unstoppable Dark Lord, not a shivering husk of flesh.
“Will we make it to the show if I eat some mango?” George teased him as he sat down by the table, knowing that they had more than enough time.
Remus felt the need to continue to speak when Narcissa remained silent. He truly hoped that he hadn’t said something heinous enough that she would never want to speak to him again. It was a highly illogical fear, yeat a fear was rarely entirely logical to begin with. “I have already checked the moon charts, there will be no full moons anywhere close to the end of December, it will be in Janua-”
Pat didn’t trust Goyle on an emotional basis, but she desperately needed to speak to someone. She couldn’t speak to her boyfriend, and most definitely not the teachers without risking his safety. She didn’t have any friends, not since her best friend and childhood friend abandoned her for not being in the same House as her, thus rendering Pat evil. Pat had been incredibly, irreversibly lonely without her, and Vince had been her saviour. Without him, she had nothing and she was terrified of criticising him out of fear that he would leave her like everyone else had.
During the past weeks, Colin had come to ask more and more about the incident with the Chamber of Secrets to his newfound group of friends, but especially Harry. Since nobody had actually informed Colin of the events in greater detail, he was eager to actually learn what had transpired when he was petrified. The topic was more than stressful to Ron, who had yet to confess to anyone but Harry, Draco, Neville and Hermione what he had done under the influence of the Dark Lord’s teenage spirit. Thus, Harry and Draco had discussed the option of bringing Colin to Hagrid so that he could ask all he wanted about Secrets. The opportunity arose, and thus they arranged the meeting, hoping to catch Hagrid in his hut before he might leave to attend to his duties as the Hogwarts gamekeeper.
Harry sat down upon the chair before he changed his mind and stood up once more, smoothing Draco’s hair to the side before he once more seated himself upon the chair. He didn’t so much grab Draco’s right hand as he grabbed his right wrist, holding on to it as he studied Draco’s face. Despite all the stress and the blemishes upon his skin, Draco was still handsome to Harry. He knew that he wasn’t as conventionally handsome as he had been before the anxiety got to him, but Harry simply looked past all of that to the familiar face which he knew. Even the crude but pale scar appeared to him to have always belonged to Draco, just as how his dad had always been scarred, as Harry had always been scarred.
Luna was a slightly scrawny teenager, with a somewhat childish, youthful face and big, doe-like eyes. She used to have rather mismatched clothes which were simply layered without any care for the expression it created. However, since she started her fifth year at Hogwarts, she had evidently begun to make an effort in how to combine her clothes into less clashing combinations. In actuality, she wasn’t dressing differently, but her clothing pieces had been carefully picked to create a coherent style, rather than convey a lack of interest. It was as if Luna allowed herself to look good, and feel good in her clothes, probably worrying less about what other people would say or comment.
As Pat hesitantly looked down upon the other woman’s hand, she considered what blood status she had, and why her name sounded familiar. If she was a Halfblood, then Pat wouldn’t have been able to shake her hand, and she shouldn’t even speak to her if she was a Mudblood. Touching her would be alright if Chang was a Fullblood, and an expected honor if she was a Pureblood but Pat simply wasn’t sure and thus, she didn’t dare move to do anything.
Narcissa understood that her older sister was struggling with the fact that her body had failed her in the one task which was expected and celebrated by all Pureblood families: to create the next generation of Pureblood mages. She understood that Bella was hurting from her continuous miscarriages, which the witch herself treated as inconveniences at worst, and something convenient at best. She understood that these things might not have hurt Bella or made her act like this if she hadn't been raised a Pureblood where her only value as a woman lay in her ability to create heirs. She further understood that Bella was troubled by the fact that her husband, Rodolphus Lestrange, appeared to have finally abandoned her.
“It was none of your business!” Rabastan yelled back as he deflected the second spell as well. He then quickly attempted to attack Sirius with a spell of his own.
Kreacher slowly relaxed, his shoulder slowly lowering down once more. “...Kreacher believes Master.” He finally confirmed, as he returned to the cupboard to carefully hide the picture frame in the back of a stash of items which he appeared to have gathered over the years.
Arthur shrugged, refusing to state that it was actually Lucius himself who had motivated him to be better.
Albus looked rather surprised as Harry spoke up so honestly, more or less confessing that he could tell that the Headmaster wasn’t honest with him. He gathered himself, as well as his expression, settling into a rather parental smile. “I suppose you might be right about that. However, I have little choice but to continue my attempts in the hopes that Horace might be reasonable at the end of the day.” Yet again, subtle twitches revealed to Harry that the man did not believe that Horace Slughorn would be reasonable.
The group of Slytherin students' faces became a mix of fascination, amusement and in some, annoyance and even anger.
“Thank you all for coming today,” Albus Dumbledore smiled at them from in front of the desk, located by the opposite end of the long room which served as the Order of the Phoenix’s meeting spot for that particular meeting.
“Nrrmm,” Harry sleepily responded as he gently pushed his hand against Draco’s cheek. The events of the day had been fun, but by now he was utterly exhausted. He wondered if Hermione would mind if he took a nap on her bed.
It had been terrifying to be accompanied by Ngo-Kwang to the Slug Club party, but Professor Slughorn himself had truly enjoyed her company, and might even be considering inviting Ngo-Kwang into his group of honour students, so there really was no problem there. This meant that she could always excuse her friend's presence as necessary to gain favor with Professor Slughorn. Not to mention that Vince wasn’t back yet, and if somebody minded her spending time with a possible Half-blood, Pat didn’t know about it yet. She chose to not know, and hoped that nobody else might raise the issue so that she might be allowed to be alone with her newfound friend. Pat just knew that she would be in trouble for her relationship in the future, but as for now, she enjoyed the sudden freedom she had when her boyfriend wasn’t looking over her shoulder at everything she did.
“Hex-mas…?” she could not help but snort. “Alright, great name. Fine, I will let it pass for now, but you are not getting away from telling me everything.”
She had known him since she was twelve, and there was no doubt that he was on the verge of a breakdown as well, maybe even tears.
“What did you say?” I call back to him as I wade closer to him through the water. I pay attention to not let my trousers become wet as it is my only grey pair and black would be positively murderous in this heat.
Harry had no idea why Blaise was making a case for him, but he assumed that the other expected him to return the favor. Without changing his expression, Harry focused on Professor Slughorn once again, meeting his gaze with confidence and without shyness. “As you can hear, sir, I’ve had the honor of working with Blaise on a few projects. I’ve also had the pleasure of meeting his mother. While I found her to be a rather intimidating woman, I would not be quite so obscene as to reject a gift from such an impressive witch.”
The idea was to combat this by allowing the Prefects to level the field by adding more points to people who deserved it, but they instead decided to try and get back at the Disciplinary Committee in every way they could, which resulted in every House losing points daily, with the exception of Hufflepuff who had been mostly forgotten while the other Houses engaged in a war to remove the most points from one another.
Rodolphus pulled his husband up upon the stage, keeping him close to himself as both of them aimed their wands at Sirius and George.
The man was old and rather round, the type of man whose wardrobe had not been updated once since he first began to buy clothes, which made the pieces mismatching to say the least. He had long since attained a bald spot upon his head, and his small eyes needed thick glasses to see. He moved slowly as age had crooked his back, yet he was not a tragic figure in the least. There was a youthfulness to his smile, and his movements might have been slowed, yet they were not weak.
As Ron realised that Draco was somewhere above him, he appeared distracted, and thus didn’t notice when another of the Slytherin players came rushing towards him soon after with the Quaffle in her hand. One of the Gryffindor Beaters noticed where Ron failed to, and he swung his club to send one of the Bludgers towards her. She spun in the air, avoiding the actual dangerous call but she had to chance her goal on a rather careless yet strong trust of the ball. Her movement caused it to spin and it hit the goal ring on the side, going over it, and straight towards Draco who had not yet thought to remove himself from the immediate danger which he was in close to a goal post.
Despite what the characters theorise, the Room of Requirements is unable to steal food from both the Hogwarts kitchens and the Great Hall. Protective wards preventing food from being stolen by magic have long since been placed in either, or students through the years would likely have attempted to nab food from the kitchens by means of magic.
“Because,” I tell him, “some people are simply born to be great, while others are the side characters in their great stories.”
Lord Voldemort’s pale, skeletal figure, dressed completely in flowing, black robes stood a few meters away from the fighting couple, the passed out man, the father and the son, and the boy he had failed to kill nearly fifteen years ago. The Dark Lord studied them all with his cold yet not unkind gaze, like a man studying misbehaving animals who he could not help but love.
He felt himself flush even worse as he closed his hand around the coins. “Fine, but I will take it as payment for three photos.” He argued, and the other teenager surrendered to his argument.
“I have a few things to discuss with Fleur, so I shall pass.” Draco responded after walking a little closer to Ron for the purpose of not having to shout over the entrance hall. “I don’t know about Harry,” he turned towards his partner, allowing Harry to make his decision on his own.
Harry got the impression that the Headmistress wanted to draw this out as much as possible. A gentle hand closed around Harry’s, startling him slightly before he realised that it was just his boyfriend.
“...Kreacher has long since wanted to serve the Malfoy family.” Kreacher spoke up without Remus asking anything. “After the Madam and my Master died, he was hoping that an envoy from the house of Malfoy would come to claim him, and Kreacher would continue to serve. Kreacher has waited for so many years, but nobody came. Then you three appear, a ghost from a time long since passed, a werewolf, and…” Kreacher hesitated to speak as he tried to find his voice amidst the emotions. “A young boy who resembles Kreacher’s Master Regulus so very much. He should have been hateful towards you, and he was, but your son, sir… He reminded Kreacher of many things which he had lost.”
Molly was speaking to Andromeda Tonks on the phone, revealing to her what Hermione had managed to piece together about Narcissa's situation. Molly had considered keeping the secret and not telling Andromeda but when she heard her friend’s voice, she could not bear to allow her to think of Narcissa Malfoy as the cold, unchangeable woman who Molly had always believed her to be as well. Molly would not have considered herself a friend of Narcissa, but she found that her silence had done plenty of harm throughout the years, both to herself and to others.
“That would limit their capability to apparate. Small children cannot apparate or they’d smother and pregnant carriers would loose their child with the stress on their body.” Tom said. “Let’s gather a recon team and check out all of these locations so as not to make a mistake. It could be that there are wolves in all locations. If so, I want to know.”
Albus gave a nod, “Give me a few minutes and I’ll be right through.” And he broke off the connection.
Pairings: Hermione/Blaise; Harry/Draco; Bellatrix/Rodolphus; Lucius/Narcissa; Severus/Remus; James/Lily, Tom/Sirius, Albus/Gellert, Fenrir/Tala (Native American, means wolf)
Lucius sat down next to his wife, “We all got there just after the mediwitch arrived. She threw us all out shortly after that when there were… complications. More than 20 hours of labor… I was a wreck with Cissy with only ten hours when Draco was born. I can’t imagine Roddy’s pain at seeing his wife go through that long of labor. Bella was catatonic for days, refusing to eat, barely slept. Rodolphus and I finally had to force nutrient potions and then a Dreamless Sleep in her. She was rail thin. She was never quite the same after that.”
“Mr. Potter, is there a reason you are in a federal building in the United States?” Tobias Fornell asked.
Gingerly she stood, and as quickly as she could dressed and stumbled to the door to leave. Outside in the hall she found a corner and threw up. Four days she’d been called to the master’s bed, four days she has been subjected to his attentions. If she’d known what all this had entailed…
Sirius Orion Black lay on his bed in Grimmauld Place, completely bored out of his mind. The only company he had at present was Buckbeak, aka Witherwings. Remus was at Hogwarts, Harry was at Hogwarts, heck even Kreature was at Hogwarts as he’d sent the four elf to serve there as he had no care for the beast.
Tom turned his attention back to the wards surrounding the compound. Closing his eyes he felt for the magic that held the wards together. He felt Muggle repelling charms and the standard protection charms. No other protections had been placed. He smiled to himself. This would be child's play.
Lily listened to Harry’s voice and was slowly seething inside for what her supposed sister did to her baby boy. Although they were not blood sisters, Lily had hoped that some familial regard was left in her sister. Obviously Vernon’s influence was too strong and swayed her weak willed sister.
The next day in potions class, Hermione sat down in her usual spot and waited for Professor Snape to arrive. She gave up trying to figure things out. She just didn’t know enough about what happened to come to a full conclusion.
On his right stood Lucius Malfoy, who, to Tom’s eye, seemed troubled about something. He would need to have a talk with the blond aristocrat.
Draco nodded as he curled up against Harry. Harry seemed to curl into him and with a sigh drifted off to sleep. Draco turned to Blaise, “Night.”
“Mum? What’s going on? I’ve been trying to get letters out, but my owl just keeps coming back to me with the letters unopened. Something’s happened here at Hogwarts.”
“Should I come back at a later time?” Harry knew that this team investigated major crimes involved with the United States military and they were mostly called out on murders.
Rodolphus nodded and led his wife back to the sofa. “Everyone please have a seat, we have much to discuss, and their will be decisions to make later.”
“No, we had tested Harry Potter, your son, and his paper showed Lily as being the daughter of Gellert Grindewald and Albus Dumbledore.”
The room was shrouded in darkness. He stood at the doorway just staring at the two people on the bed. His mind was racing with images of these two defiant and proud as the green light from his own wand enveloped them in turn. It was impossible that they were here and alive, yet here they lay.
Fenrir just shook his head again, “We never saw anyone, it was all over when we got back. It was as if they knew we would be gone and leave the carriers and cub’s by themselves. From the smells of the area there were at least twenty men and women. They didn’t even leave a corpse behind from one of their own. I could smell the blood of the one who died. It was not werewolf. Three of my pack that was left behind from the hunt had been killed.”
Severus was sitting in the middle of the room meditating. Sierra was curled up in a corner. He had no idea what she thought was going to happen, but it was not for them to have sex. He will always stay true to Remus. It had been three days since his capture and each day Sierra asks if they would mate. Each time he would gently tell her no. Her innocence about the situation was slowly beginning to exasperate him.
“Draco, everything will be fine. I’m sure he will love you, as much as I do. He’d lost his family very much in the same way I have. To suddenly have a son he never knew, from a man no less, must be more of a shock than seeing you.”
Tom ran his hands through his hair exasperated. These two people were driving him back into insanity.
Inside the office was Delores Umbridge sitting behind Head’s desk, sitting in a chair across from her was Minerva McGonagall and Trelawney. The three of them looked up when he came in.
Reluctantly he released his hold on the boy, who looked no older than two years old, and Lily pulled away cradling the boy to her. The child began to wriggle in her grasp and crying.
“It could be any number of things. A potion, spell or combination of both. That is what we need to figure out. Also, I had a thought… how is the ministry keeping up with this farce of Tom being a Dark Lord? How did they get the whole Wizarding World to accept that without him actually doing anything. From what Potter said you were just a dark wizard in politics. They have to have some way of getting everyone to recognize him as a Dark Lord. They couldn’t have just gone to all the homes and used this spell.” Severus said.
Draco smiled back, “I’ll bet.” He leaned in and gave Harry a gentle kiss to his lips. He took Harry’s hand and together they walked to dinner.
Albus stood at the door to his room watching the love of his life sleep. He never imagined that Gellert would have gotten pregnant. Would things have been different if he had? Would he have been able to go up against him knowing that he was carrying his child? Albus had no way of knowing, and no way of ever making it up to his lover.
Hermione went to the stockroom, located the vial and took it down. Turning back to Snape she said, “Thank you, sir.”
“Lils, I know you want to go after Petunia, I do too, but you have to think about the bigger picture here. You are not the only one who want’s a piece of them, there is a long line of people who would like to take a crack at them too. Myself included.”
With the help of the older children Tom herded them all to the exit without any trouble. He ran into a few of his own men and ordered them to help take the children back to the Manor.
Draco stared out the door to where Harry’s father went through and smirked. He turned to his mother, “He didn’t seem the coward type.”
James sighed, “Alright, I’ll tell you something that you told me… In our first year after we were sorted your mom sent you a Howler in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast screaming about you being sorted into Gryffindor and being a disgrace to the House of Black, but later an owl was sent to our dorm room with a single line written on it… it said: I’m proud of you, son. I was the only one there when you received it and you knew it was from your father.”
Vance shot a glance at Harry, then Gibbs and nodded. He quietly walked to the door and closed it behind him.
Lily smiled back, “Grandpa Gel’s eyes. Harry, I've been meaning to ask you.” Her eyes took on a serious glint and Harry began to squirm. “How did Petunia and Vernon treat you?”
The group began to disperse with Tom, Remus, Sirius, Fenrir and Lucius staying behind. Tom sat back into his chair and sighed heavily. “I want you to take Fenrir with you.”
Tom conjured a chair and sat heavily. He really didn’t think that it would be this easy to recover their memories but he’d hoped for some sort of clue.
He made his way to the door and just before he could knock it opened and he had his arms full of Narcissa Irma Black Malfoy.
“If you had stayed you would have been captured too and we would not have known your fate.” Tom stood and began to pace. “The full moon is less than a week away. We must rescue Severus before then or they will turn him. Lucius and I will take a direct route and draw out the guards while a smaller group will slip in through the back entrance. Take anyone who volunteers and who has the most experience. Remus and Sirius will lead the small team. Please no Gryffindor heroics, Black.”
Albus scanned each paper one by one with a sinking feeling. By the time he got to the last page he was in tears. His name stood out on Harry’s page like a beacon.
“My memories of that night are not so terrible except the end. Sirius had just shown up very excited about something, bursting to tell us but was waiting for you. When you came in the door Peter was trailing behind you. Now that I think about it he looked rather nervous and hesitant about something.
Lily pulled Harry into her arms and gently rocked him as his tears fell. Movement came from the door and she saw Draco standing there, horror etched on his face. Tears were cascading down his pale cheeks too and Lily held out an arm to welcome him into them. The blond tore across the room and threw himself into her arms as well as wrapping his own around Harry. Lily didn't know how long they sat like that, nor did she care.
Fenrir glanced at the map and pointed to one spot, “This is not far from my pack’s forest. It is possible that they could be here.”
James snorted, “So how are we going to get the kids out of there then? With you declared ‘unfit for duty’ that leaves just Snape. And it’s going to be hard to pull him away from Remus at the moment.”
Tom glanced over at the children and his face went tense, “I’m not sure you really want to know. Needless to say they have been released and reunited with family.”
“Patience love. Now, how about us getting the kids from Hogwarts and having a family reunion? I for one am looking forward to seeing my son.” James smiled.
“Hagrid told me that a Unicorn mare is due in three days and she has agreed to the hair when her foal is born. So as soon as she foals.”
Tom smiled, “Never mind, until all our memories are back, what I glimpsed makes no sense right now.” Tom drank the next potion. Everyone looked at him expectant.
Severus pulled from within his robes a few vials, “They range from your basic memory restorer to an advanced mind healing draught. I am unsure as to which would be more successful.”
“I don’t understand, why are you telling me about some Death Eater. How do you know all this anyway?”
Severus looked thoughtful for a moment and then gave a small gasp, “He left shortly after finding out about Lily being his daughter did he not?”
Snape shook his head and glared at the three of them, “You will not speak a word of this to anyone, am I understood.”
‘This is perfect, and it only takes four days to make. I’ll need to ask Hagrid if he knows of any Unicorn Mares with foal and how soon they’ll give birth.’ Hermione was giddy with excitement, ‘Mum always said we might be related to Royalty way back, this is the perfect way to find out.’
Sorry for all you who have been waiting for me to finish this... Sadly I've not been having any luck.. So... This is the last bit that I've written...
Ever since he was a boy everyone has called him weak or squib. It was only until he turned eight that his family knew he had magic, even then they were never sure he would be powerful. Not like his father, the Auror, the one his whole family raves about. The man who is now a drooling mess at St. Mungo’s Hospital.
Albus smiled, “He is a natural at Quidditch, which he got from his father, and he excels in Charms and Defense. He has his father’s messy black hair and you’s and Lily’s eyes.”
Lucius looked at Tom in surprise. Tom was never one to associate with children. It seems the werewolf pups had an impact on his lord.
Together they dressed and headed up to the Great Hall. They entered separably a few minutes after each other. Draco watched Harry as he made his way to the Gryffindor table. He noticed that Weasley and Finnigan began to question him as to where he’d been. He was relieved to see that Hermione intervened and the two of them sat with their heads together talking quietly.
Severus stood and walked over to him, “We will find all that out, Tom. I’ll get started on that list of potions and we’ll see if they’ll work. If not then we need to find out exactly how the memories were removed.”
James and Lily were once again speechless at what the Dark Lord just said. They looked at one another then turned to Tom. James spoke up, “No Muggleborns? Why do you say that?”
“Um… I…” She really didn’t know what to say to these people. She has parents and didn’t think that they would just up and let her go.
Severus struggled to his feet with the help of Narcissa and sat next to Remus, his hands gently caressed the werewolfs bruised face, “Remy, I’m here… we are all here and we are fine. Conall is just fine too. We are safe now.” And he leaned in a gave a chaste kiss to the injured man.
“Good idea.” Lucius called a house-elf to him and gave her instructions to gather some people together for recon missions.
Lucius took a quick glance at his lords face then dropped his gaze back to the floor. Best explain as fast as possible, “My Lord, do you recall the night that Bella had her child?”
Fenrir sat nibbling on a biscuit as the time passed. Twenty minutes went by and he began to worry. Just then a bell rang alerting the household that someone was apparating in. Fenrir jumped up and ran to the apparation point.
“That is a very bold suggestion, Mr. Malfoy. How would we go about this without their knowledge, because I will not have my students upset for any reason.”
Hello all. I promised myself that I’d have this out before Christmas and here it is.. Hope you all enjoy it. K
He let his outer senses take over and the first thing he smelled was bodily waste. He could faintly smell unwashed bodies nearby and the distinct smell of wet dog. He knew that Remus often smelled of wet dog after a full moon run in the rain.
The men began to converge on them. Severus glance around, trying to find a means of escape and, noticing the fireplace behind him, he grabbed the floo powder and pushed Remus towards it. The flames turned green as he threw in the powder and he shouted, “Malfoy Manor!” and they dropped into the flames.
Lily gave a laugh and the boy turned his head. With a cry of, “Papa!” he launched himself off the table and into Severus’ arms. Severus held his son to him tightly.
Albus looked into those gorgeous green eyes and came to a decision, “My love, would you like to see our Grandson?”
She closed her eyes again, trying to will it all away. She really was Bellatrix Lestange’s daughter. She couldn’t deny it any longer.
Colin Creevey was shocked to his core to find out that he was the son of Sirius Black and Voldemort. And his brother was not really his brother but second cousin. He really didn’t know how to handle all this. In a single instant his world was turned upside down.
It was wonderful to be able to think clearly after so long being trapped within her mind. She moaned as her head began to ache. Slowly she opened her eyes and she noticed a shape beside her. Her husband lay there sleeping. She breathed his name, James.
Nearing the entrance of Azkaban prison Tom pulled his wand out and sent a powerful blasting curse at the gates. Once the gates were down the Death Eaters flowed through heading to their assigned locations to free their companions.
“Uncle Vernon… he…” Harry dropped to the floor crying unable to say more. Draco sighed in defeat. He could not get Harry to open up to him more, no matter what. One of these days he is going to find that disgusting Muggle and kill him. He knew that whatever Harry goes through in the summers while he’s with his relatives it is more that just neglect and lack of food. It’s something more and he is determind to find out what.
Taking a deep breathe Albus entered the dingy cell. It was dark, dank and stunk of feces. Albus pulled out his wand and lit the tip with a silent lumos. The light filled the room and the single occupant cringed back away from it.
Fenrir crept up to the door where the conversation was taking place. A board creaked under his foot and he cursed as the talking stopped. The door flew open and the stern face of Snape sneered at the Alpha werewolf.
For one thing Harry was too small for his age. When Harry had collapsed when they’d first arrived she could tell there was more going on than just a bad reaction to a portkey. She’d discreetly took Narcissa’s wand and ran a basic diagnostic spell. The results were startling to say the least. Harry was only 95lbs and extremely undernourished. All the signs were there and she was surprised that no one noticed anything.
The cruciatus curse hit him again and spittle dribbled from his mouth and he prayed that his master wouldn't make him go mad like the Longbottoms.
Narcissa stared at him aghast, “They are stealing children from Dark families, and from the Heritage potion done by Miss Granger, sending them to live with Muggles…”
Lily stepped fully into the room when she noticed Albus. Her eyes suddenly began to fill with tears. With a strangled cry she ran to him and engulfed him in a hug.
Severus growled at the word pup, “Do you call all your victims ‘cub’ Greyback? Or just those you bite that are children?”
But now, everything had changed and both Granger and Potter were gone. Possibly the only thing keeping his family from being killed is the fack that Ginny is sleeping with the Master. She was supposed to be for Potter, but then the freak had to go and turn gay on them. Imagine, sleeping with a Malfoy! Ugh!
Harry jerked with a start at the voice. Quickly he put the blade away and wipped the blood off, pulling his sleeve back down over his arms. He opened the stall door just as Draco came in. Draco sighed in relief at the sight of him.
“I always wondered why she was… like that…” Snape pondered his next words, “How much did you know of the Mediwitch?”
What does that mean? She knew for a fact that Bellatrix Lestrange and her husband were still alive. They were still in Azkaban as far as she knew, but that meant that she should have been sent to be raised by the Malfoy’s or the Tonks’. Why then was she sent to live with Muggles?
Dumbledore seemed to collapse inwardly, “Before all that mess in 1940 Gellert and I were… lovers. Then some things happened and we had a falling out. I was forced to duel him and then defeated him. He now resides in Nurmengard Prison.”
Severus nodded. He was not surprised that she figured that all out in her head. Most wolves were smart. He wold have bet that many of them, had they been allowed to attend Hogwarts, would have been in Ravenclaw.
Harry felt sick as the portkey deposited them in the foyer of the Malfoy home. With a groan he collapsed into a heap and began to empty his stomach. Draco was beside him in seconds with soothing words and a bucket. He heard Hermione calling for help as he moaned helplessly and threw up some more.
Slowly he pulled Harry off the floor and carried him to his dorm room. He knew that Harry slept better when he slept with someone. As he swept through the Slytherin commom room he noticed Blaise sitting in front of the fire staring into the flames. He cleared his throat.
“Peter is working for the Ministry. The entire ‘Dark side light side’ thing is all their doing. On the night of our ‘death’ we were not killed but taken to Azkaban. They put us in stasis and kept us like that until the break-in by Tom and Lucius. Tom, obviously, didn't kill us because he was not dark. He was dating my best friend, who we just recently found out was pregnant that night. Peter somehow changed Tom’s memory that night and placed a spell on him that sent his spirit in to some kind of astral projection. Gave out Harry a scar and left with Sirius where he set up the scene of his destruction of those muggles and the incrimination of Sirius.”
“Dumbledore told me that Gellert was good with stasis spells. His theory was when the man found out he was pregnant he placed a strong stasis charm on the fetus, possibly so it would not interfere with his plans. After he was captured the stasis slowly deteriorated and the child began to grow. When the guards at Nurmengard found out they took her and placed her with muggles.”
“You don’t understand Sev, he made me what I am… you don’t know what it’s been like… I was so afraid that Conell would be like me when he was born.”
Hermione gave a squeek as she was engulfed in a surprisingly strong hug. She glanced at the two men who stood hovering nearby. They looked so similar that she did not know who was who.
Just then Madame Pomphrey burst into the room, “Alright everyone, lets each find a bed and roll up your left sleeve. It will just be a little blood draw and your all done. If any infection is to be reported I will send you an owl and you will promptly return here for a purifying potion.”
Harry went to the other couch and was pulled down by the other occupant. He turned to look into the eyes of his boyfriend and those beautiful grey eyes seemed to calm him. He laid his head on Draco Malfoy’s lap and the blonde Slytherin combed his hands through his own hair. The shock seemed to have worn off the Slytherin prince as he observed his cousin and her boyfriend.
Lucius pulled his wife into his arms, “I don’t know, love, but we’ll find out. I need to have that list from the healer, then we are going to talk to those families.”
Slowly, so as not to startle her, Severus opened his eyes and sat up. She was beautiful, tall and dark skinned. She had short brown hair that framed her face and brought out the amber blue of her eyes. She looked no older than twenty, though he knew that werewolves lived long lives. All she wore was a thin tunic that barely went to her knees.
“Hey, we’re here… we’re not dead… you were all lied to by Peter. And if my guess is correct by the Ministry too.”
“I’ve never met the boy, and I actually never gave birth to him. He was stolen while he was still in my womb. We thought that it was a misscarry. Many pureblood families have a difficult time conceiving. Very rarely will you see families like the Weasley’s. As to your question… his name is Dennis Creevy.”
Fang slowed as they came upon a clearing where Hermione saw Hagrid. About ten yards in the center of the clearing was a glemaing white body heaving with effort. Coming to stand beside the half-giant, Hermione stopped and stared at the Unicorn.
Albus gently lowered the man onto a nearby chair but stood nearby as the man refused to release his hand. “Lucius, Narcissa, Severus… may I introduce Gellert Grindewald, the love of my life and carrier of my daughter. Severus, could you please came and check Gel over. He’s not in the greatest of shape right now.”
A son… he has a son. One who knows nothing about who he really is. Who was raised as a Muggle. Tom growled and stood, pacing. Whoever is responsible for all this will pay dearly. He needed to find out who is doing this and why, before it happens to any more families. The future of the Magical world depended on this.
Remus grimaced as a tender spot was rubbed when Conall climbed on his lap, “Feels like my days after the full moon.”
Blaise nodded and followed Draco to their dorm room. Draco tucked Harry into his bed after removing his outer robes. The slashes on his arms stood out against the paleness of the Gryffindor’s skin.
His mind supplied names for them, but he passed that off as impossible… right? James and Lily Potter were dead… killed by Tom, the very man who stood in front of them.
Snape shrugged to himdelf, it wasn’t his call to decide weather or not the woman actually deserved to know if her child was alive or not. Being in Azkaban all these years had probably rattled the womans brain. Snape remembered little of the middle Black girl. He’d spent most of his time studying, avoiding the Murauders and trying to beg Lily’s forgiveness after fifth year.
Hermione spoke up, “I don’t think that mine knew. Mum was always going on about our possible link to Royalty and such, which brought us to this revelation.”
Snape stood as she went to the door, “Miss Granger, if you’d like… I can put you in contact of those with the answers your seek.”
“Until such time the Ministry has named me High Inquisitor and Acting Headmistress. And for the first order of business all students are required to dress appropriately in school attire.”
Lucius’ face became impassive, “It is true, they were in Azkaban. I can take you to see them right now, if you want.”
“This is nothing of the sort, Sirius. If you want I can have them brought here, although they are still recovering from their ordeal…”
Looking in the mirror Harry could see his blood-shot eyes and dark circles under them. He looked like death warmed over. Pulling out his wand he cast a couple concealer charms to cover it all up.
Harry flinched away from the upraised hand that held the wand, fled to the corner of the room and wrapped his arms around himself, knees to his chin head burried in them rocking back and forth.
Now it was Tom’s turn to look perplexed, “Have a row? Alright, something is not right here. Either you two are crazy from your stay in Azkaban or someone has been screwing with my memories or both.”
A sound from upstairs caught Umbridge’s attention and she stopped the curse. She cocked her head and listened. A cry from an upstairs bedroom made her sneer at the Potions Master.
Finally secure behind his private door, Snape stored the Heritage potion in a cubbord by the door. He will persuade Granger to stay behind after class tomorrow, just to insure she did do the potion right. Lucius would have spared no expence on the Heritage potion he kept. Only the best for a Malfoy.
When class began she followed her assignment by rote, not really paying attention to the instructions. As a result the cauldron began to bubble more furiously and she gave a gasp as the whole thing exploded. Luckily she ducked down behind her desk just in time before the hot liquid could hit her.
“Just a couple of hours ago… Granger was sitting in the common room reading and I saw Potter in the Hall.”
Remus lay curled up on his bed with his son asleep close to his chest. His tears were spent and all that remained was numbness. Conell cried himself to sleep when Remus told him that his papa won’t be back. Remus just clung to his baby trying to console the distraught child all the while trying to hold in his own tears. After the boy fell asleep did his tears fall. He prayed that Severus was OK, and that they can rescue him soon. He knew that he would go mad without his mate, not being able to feel his kisses, the caress of his long fingers as they explored his body. The ache in his chest grew with each passing moment Severus was gone from his presence.
When Harry woke up in a cold sweat, he could still feel huge teeth pressing down upon his skin as the lingering phantom scent of roses remained within Harry’s nose. It took many hugs and calming kisses from Draco before Harry could fall asleep once more.
See, he had already decided what to say on the trial, but he was still curious to know if Draco really was everything, or anything of what he had believed. Nowadays, he doubted everyone. His father and his godfather Sirius Black had both been horrendous bullies to a point where they had nearly well ruined an innocent child’s life. Albus Dumbledore might never have cared for people the way he acted, and might as well have used them all as set pieces. Narcissa Malfoy had saved his life. Severus Snape had apparently not been evil at all, and possibly the bravest person involved in the war, although that was a story for another time. He himself was nothing of all that he had believed himself to be, that people had managed to convince a child to think he was.
“Is it possible to do such a thing?” Harry blinked. “I always assumed that there was nothing that could be done to protect one’s mind from, well, a mind reader.”
Then sometimes, when they kissed, Vince would grab her arms harsher than necessary, and push against her lips and her body with his far larger one, and Pat felt surges of panic swell within her.
Whenever Harry spoke in a sharper tone, it made him sound more like James, at least more compared to the soft tone which was his normal tone of voice. Sirius found himself avoiding to look at the son of a werewolf, as he felt ashamed over the projecting he was doing onto the child. He knew that he wasn’t James, and even if Harry had been a perfect copy of him, which he wasn't even, that didn’t mean that Sirius had the right to use him as a replacement for the man he had lost.
“We should. Secrets, we will bring the kind man who feeds you to look you and your eyes over, would that be alright with you?” Harry closed his eyes and turned back to the basilisk, still petting her.
It was pleasant, it was nerve wracking, and it was fun. The two teenagers enjoyed themselves greatly, although they did not go, as Muggles would say ‘all the way.’
The room fell deadly silent as the students glanced between the short, pink woman and the tall, dark man, both of who were staring at one another as if they were considering duelling there and then, but did not want the other to suspect it when they reached for their wands. The faint bubbling of the cauldrons filled the silence of the room, as none dared even whisper between themselves.
Harry put Hermione’s letter aside and picked up the next one. This one was from Teddy and had included a small package of chocolate as a present for Harry’s birthday, which Harry had long since eaten.
He thinks for a little bit and then speaks up, “you’re supposed to go watch games with you dad. And eat ice cream. Can we do that?”
“So in a way, the Death Eaters are just the next incarnation of an extremist group who seeks to accomplish unreasonable things based on them wanting more power and influence?” Harry summarised, looking to the man for confirmation.
Harry thought that he had understood what fear was many times through his life, yet he had never felt a fear so paralyzingly strong as the one which gripped him as he was taken hostage by Lord Voldemort. Harry felt limp, his mind felt numb, his lungs felt faulty as he forgot how to even breathe. He couldn’t move, couldn’t think and his head was pounding as if something within his forehead was trying to break free. In his absolute inability to do anything but exist, Harry realised that the reason as to why his forehead and scar hurt when he was close to the Dark Lord likely had to do with the fact that whatever magic the man had left within his body as he tried to kill him, was trying to break from the container which was Harry’s body and reunite with him.
“Yeah, no, that seems good…” Teddy confirmed before he spun around on his heel and headed for the door. He stopped to pat Harry on the head, earning a weak smile back. “See you.”
I glance back towards the newspaper upon the table, studying the name upon it as it screams the headline at me. I can end the American Mage War, I only need to reach him. I only need to speak to him.
“Good idea,” Teddy whispered back as he left the door open behind him. Somehow, the open door and their means of escaping the Department of Mysteries did not so much appear as a path to freedom and safety, but as yet another risk which they had to expose themselves to for the sake of a possible safety benefit.
When every student was gathered, the woman stood up just as the clock changed positions and her lesson began. In her hands, she held a clipboard with a paper upon it, and in her hand, she held a brilliantly white quill.
It might be unconventional for a nine year old boy to live at Hogwarts, but it will work out. It is worth it because Tom is happy. For the first time in his life, the boy is happy. I know that to be the truth because Tom tells it to me.
In the end, Draco abandoned all pretenses and disclaimers and simply confessed to what was weighing his heart down to the point where not even Quidditch, or the freedom of the sky, could save him. He confessed to the task he had been given as he strived to keep the emotions back from ripping him apart, as he had for more than half a year.
Draco walked up to the grave, and stopped next to Harry, silently reading the inscription of the gravestone. Narcissa stayed a little behind them, seemingly rather lost in trying to figure out how to write a letter to her long distance sister. Draco knelt down and placed the flowers on the grave, feeling emotions well up in his throat and chest, making it hard to remain collected. He breathed through his nose and out his mouth, while playing with his scarf, as to try and distract himself enough to not let the emotions escape from within him.
“With the moon as the symbol of all witches of this Earth, we wish you stability,” the vows continued. This time, a silvery ribbon materialised and began to wrap itself around their wrists and hands.
Sometimes, you simply had to make your own little golden moments; at least that was what Harry reasoned as he brought the horrendously ugly unicorn tea cup out of the cupboard, to later serve tea in to no other than Draco Malfoy.
In the dreams, the Dark Lord couldn’t really do anything about being scolded, yet as a wake adult, he found the dreams to be odd and confusing. He would have understood it if the teacher had been one he had known, perhaps even Albus Dumbledore, yet he had never had a teacher who dressed all in pink. Then, he had a horribly vivid dream about being separated from his loved one, and devoured by a gigantic version of the unpleasant teacher. Yet to his great surprise, the loved one was not a person he had known, but a young stranger who resembled Lucius Malfoy to an assured degree.
The group of Slytherin students approached them like a massive creature of primarily black and slightly green. Harry felt as if he could feel the ill intention upon them as if they were a hot fire, threatening to scald him as well as Colin. He quickly glanced around for a carriage, which naturally was taken as weakness by the rest of his fellow Slytherin students. Draco was moved forward alongside the rest of the group as he settled into a look of disapproval which he aimed towards Colin. It was the kind of look which Draco’s eleven year old self would have employed, but not the kind of face which the current Draco would show and mean it.
Harry and Draco gazed at one another before Draco turned back to Colin with a patient and somewhat excited look in his eyes. “Have you ever heard of magic circuits?”
“So in summary, we kind of both want to date the other, but now isn't the best of times?” Colin looked at Harry’s face as he asked.
“If he truly believed in blood as something which is inherently magical, it is possible that the implementation of blood as the magic circle was meant to enhance his overall magic ability.” Remus continued to theorise, absently drumming his fingers against his arm as he thought out loud. “Young Mr. Weasley shouldn’t have had enough internal magic to sustain such a complex ritual, meaning that it might have been necessary to use the blood of a possessed mage as a type of gathering of magic, or magic focus, to be able to perform the ritual in the first place.”
I will never see him again, and letters will not be enough to soothe my longing for my one and best friend.
Yet before Pat could decide on a choice, the door opened on the other end of the room, prompting Chang to pull back so as to preserve Pat’s dignity. Pat herself turned away from it to hide her less than appealing face, which was haunted by far too many emotions for the moment.
“Yes, of course. I may want answers, but I don’t want to exactly force them. May I hug you, s-, Albus?” Harry carefully smiled at the Greatest Wizard Alive. It was evident that the other needed to be comforted, as such a thing did not change with age.
“I’m very glad that you’re here.” Harry sighed with relief after Draco pulled him upright from almost falling yet again.
Yet Draco wasn’t there, and Harry did have some manner of feelings for Colin and… And… It was all so awfully confusing.
“He sure can,” Harry gently teased his boyfriend who was attempting to appear as if he had no concept of what they were speaking of.
I leave Tom standing alone in my classroom, holding on to his bag as he watches me go. The last I see of him, he is reaching for his diary and holds it to his chest, a complex expression of grief and determination forming on his face.
Unlike what he had expected, Professor Slughorn blinked at him and then relaxed. He settled back into his chair with a satisfied nod, appearing highly pleased with himself. “I take it you were raised by him as he implemented the Lycanthropy potion every month to remain sane?”
Thus, I hide in my bed, making myself sick with worry, regret and anxiety. I hide away from the feast and the celebration of the Durmstrang Trimagus Tournament champion.
“Tell you all about it in a bit.” Creevy carefully maneuvered the wheelchair inside with the assistance of Neville, who was the closest. “Just finishing up what I need to do before then. Thanks, Longbottom.”
Victor shook his head. “The mum is still preparing the food with some other people. Although Fleur is almost ready, so it’s probably not long now. Bill hadn’t gotten dressed when I left. He seems nice, but a little… thought fleeting?” Victor mashed together two words to make himself understood.
Chang raised her head, carefully studying Harry through her tears. She didn’t seem very wounded by his lack of politeness. “But… aren’t you a… Death Eater?”
“Have you and Weasley…?” Pat couldn’t help but feel a little hopeful, as she didn’t want to be the only person in Hogwarts who was intimate with her boyfriend.
Luna nodded, or rather bobbed her head. “She is very keen on telling everyone, and doesn’t stand for anyone badmouthing you.”
Tom glares at me but his expression softens as he realises that my hands are shaking. He stuffs the newspaper into his bag and walks away from me, returning shortly with a glass. I drink while my hands continue to shake. Tom commands a chair to come over to him and he sits down, crossing both arms and legs as he waits for me to confess my sins to him.
The old wizard appeared relieved as Harry agreed. “Secondly, you must remember that you will be entering into my memories, into my head, with all the biases and quirks of what I felt and understood back then. You must remember that the feelings you will feel won’t be your own. The thoughts you have are not yours and the people you will meet, you have actually never met. This is the primary reason as to why this course of action is not quite morally just, as your young mind might be confused with the limit of where you lie. You have never known Tom, and I’m afraid that you never will. Do you understand what I am telling you?”
“I’m really not,” Harry shook his head. “You are the ones who have been affected by the charm of this thing. I can’t let you touch it, or it might get worse. I’ll simply go to Secrets now.” He made an attempt to leave but Neville stepped in front of the door, blocking it from him.
Nobody knew that Rodolphus Lestrange had ordered the followers to not use such spells, and it was precisely because nobody knew that Teddy’s actions became justifiable, as he could have been in a life and death situation at the time. That fact did not entail that it was morally right to blow off a person’s leg and cripple them for life, but Teddy’s actions had been based on more factors than simple cruelty and desire to do harm.
The snake raised its head, and then, in a flurry of limbs, scales and hair, Harry returned. He blinked slowly as he got readjusted to the human experience once more.
“Lucius was a part of the Slughorn club, which was an elite club for talented students, as favored by the Potions Professor Horace Slughorn. He enjoyed gathering students from all walks of life, as long as they adhered to his quota of talented. As he took no notice of blood, I refused his summons, whereas Lucius did not, as he had the intention of using the man’s approval for future work. I was not as forward seeing in my youth as he was. I do not know if the man was still teaching when you were attending Hogwarts?” Mrs. Malfoy glanced towards the two men.
Yet the two had no chance to exchange words with one another as the Death Eaters responded to the attack on their fellow member. Neville aimed a spell towards Bellatrix Lestrange but Harry couldn’t hear what he had shouted as Teddy attacked Mr. Nott with an even louder yell, causing the man’s leg to more or less explode in a gruesome manner. Somewhere next to Harry, Draco yelled at his father to not touch him while George called for Sirius. Ginny and Colin stepped forward with their wands raised as Hermione yelled something and Luna ducked away from the fighting behind one of the stone benches.
Harry felt his frown deepen as he carefully scooted over to sit next to Albus by the wall, their arms touching slightly as Harry wanted to remind the old wizard that he wasn’t alone. “That doesn’t quite line up with the man I know from the history books, or in person. Although I suppose I finally understand why he speaks like you.”
“If Harry doesn’t like it, he would ask Colin to stop.” Draco shrugged as he played with Harry’s hair. “And if he couldn’t do it, then he’d ask me for help.”
Sirius stuck his tongue out before turning to George, smiling at him as well, “I did the thing you convinced me to do. You were right, I did need to do it.”
The entire compartment made an array of confused responses in the negative in regards to her question.
“Uhm… uh…” Pettigrew stuttered. “I think that Lady Lestrange might have misunderstood the plan, and frightened Lord Malfoy with her assumptions. She became enraged with him and apparated after him, followed by the Lestrange husbands and the rest of the Death Eaters who had the intention of.. uh… not… ruining the plan…” The animagus lost some momentum at the end as he realised that his retelling was not pleasing the Dark Lord.
Mrs. Weasley had run out of options and in a rather definite lack of options, she reached out and pulled Harry into a hug, allowing him to cry against her. Harry wasn’t generally used to hugging women, with the exception of Hermione who didn’t quite like hugs in the first place. Thus, he found Molly Weasley rather oddly soft, but none the worse to hug for that reason. He allowed himself to cling to the support he was given as the mother of seven whispered kind reassurances which meant nothing into Harry’s ear.
El looks back at me. I can see his gentle smile as the light is hanging directly above our heads. “Did I ever tell you that your eyes remind me of stars? Like two brilliant evening stars, burning above a dull world which does not actually deserve them?”
Harry appeared to be about to object, but changed his mind. He slowly nodded before correcting his hair to fall over his scar once more, like it usually did. Hermione felt a tingle of sadness as she noticed that Harry had been shamed into hiding part of himself yet again, just when he had felt comfortable enough with his scar to no longer hide it.
The man’s presence was prominent everywhere in the house, and without him, it became oddly empty. Remus very much felt the same as his son, which was the primary reason that he struggled to even be within the house.
“You will have to show me that later,” Draco nodded at Harry, then returned his attention to Kreacher. “There is now a snake in the terrarium in Harry’s room. She is expected to be fed, and I want you to make certain that there is food prepared for her. You are not to feed her while Harry is at home, but should he be unable to, you are to care for the snake in his stead. Understood?” Draco was clearly used to handling servants, he naturally began issuing orders like he did to his own House Elf and servants. Harry was a little taken aback by the formalness and almost aristocratic air which was evident in his boyfriend, even if he had seen it many times before.
Harry was so surprised by the reaction, and the approval, that he ended up agreeing without offence, even if the formulation of Professor Slughorn’s words could have been less demeaning. “Yes… Seeing as he was in charge of raising Harry Potter, the Ministry of Magic has provided him with free potions since I ended up in his care at the age of one.”
James and Lily gaped at him, “You thought you killed us?” James asked in shock. At Tom’s nod James collapsed back onto the bed, “Well, obviously we are not dead, as we are sitting right here, so your memories must have been altered. But why? And to what purpose?”
Glancing around he noticed two other men standing with his mother and once again gaped slack jawed. One of them could be an older twin to Harry. He glanced back at his boyfriend still cradled in the red heads arms. He had seen pictures of these two people and his mind just couldn’t process the fact that they are here.
“Ok, so is there a particular reason you are here Fornell? Or were you just stopping by for a visit?” Gibbs asked the agent.
Harry smiled at him, “James Potter was my carrier. Jethro is my sire. Dad was Fae, as am I. Jethro and dad met very briefly and were never bonded. If that had happened Jethro would have died shortly after Voldemort killed Dad.”
Blood welled up on his arm as the blade ran across the skin. The relief he felt was palpable. He slid the blade across his skin again, lost in the motion.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. Did she know? She couldn't know! No one could! He shook his head, “They treated me fine, mum.”
A gentle voice calmed him, whispering soothing words and with that comforting presence he let darkness claim him.
It all was so far-fetched to him. James had never lied to him and he had no reason to now. So why could he not feel as if any of this was true? Because it’s the Dark Lord! A little voice in his head told him. He could stomach Snape and Moony together, hell he could even stomach Harry and Malfoy Jr. But him and VOLDEMORT! It was just so unbelievable.
“How much do you remember of the night Bellatrix lost her baby?” Snape threw back the liquid in on go. It burned going down.
“Grandson? I have a grandson? I had a child, Al… I’m so sorry I never told you… so sorry.” The man started to weep. “I don’t even know if it was a girl or boy… they just took it as soon as I delivered. My baby… gone…”
Tom was a little shocked to say the least. Most of the time when werewolf packs were attacked the whole pack was just outright killed. “Do you know why they were taken and not killed?”
Hermione just stared at the paper in shock. Two things kept rolling through her head. She was adopted. She was the daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange.
Sirius froze and turned back to Lucius. His expression was one of such anger that Lucius took a step back, “You dare mention their names after what that… thing did to them! How dare you!”
Madame Pomphrey nodded and went to the fire, tossing in some floo powder she knelt down as she called out, “Headmasters Office” and stuck her head in the green flames.
After cleaning the child she plucked a single hair from her and placed her in a bassinet and activated the portkey. Bassinet and baby both dissapeared. From her bag she pulled the golum and with the hair whispered a spell which made the golum look like the baby.
When Fenrir followed Tom through the floo network he was greeted by a scent that he’d not smelled in thirty years, that of his cub. He took in all the people gathered around the room and his gaze landed on a man with light brown hair and amber blue eyes. He swept his gaze over the other werewolf and his inner wolf howled in delight.
“There is no way that I’m going anywhere with you. I will not be drawn in by your pathetic attempts to entice me into your little club.”
Tom nodded and handed the list over to him. Remus and Conell both followed Severus out the door and everyone settled in to await the children’s return.
Albus smiled at the man, “What do you mean, not really muggleborn? Surly you don’t think that a pureblood would just allow their child to presume to be muggle.”
Rodolphus collapsed onto the rich Persian rug in despair. Rabastan fell heavily back onto the chair he stood from with a sob. Lucius Malfoy placed a hand on his brother-in-law’s shoulder.
“Gel, I need to find out what’s been happening while I was gone. Will you be alright here for a few minutes?”
Lucius handed a copy of the list to Dumbledore. Albus scanned the names on the list. The ones he knew were convicted Death Eaters popped out at him.
Ten more minutes and there were ten people standing around Draco and his portkey, a small silver necklace.
Draco went about gathering his and Harry’s things. After they’d started dating Harry refused to leave him, claiming that he slept better with him. Draco did not complain for it gave him the chance to ease Harry into their relationship.
Lucius stared off as he thought about that fateful night and the mediwitch. He needed to find the woman and get some answers. He stood and went to the floo.
Gibbs shot a look at Fornell, “Is that what there calling it these days? And how is the Secretary of Defense connected to the Magical community?”
Draco stared at Harry in shock. This was the last thing he expected from Harry after spilling the news of his abuse to his mother.
“Pads, you don’t really mean that now do ya?” said a voice from the door. Sirius gasped and turned to see a face he only ever thought to see on his Godson ever again.
Pairings: Hermione/Blaise; Harry/Draco; Bellatrix/Rodolphus; Lucius/Narcissa; Severus/Remus; James/Lily, Tom/Sirius, Albus/Gellert, Fenrir/Tala (Native American, means wolf)
“He is just how dad described him to me in my letter. Very straightforward and gruff. He’ll be coming here later around seven.”
James Potter shrank back from the fury coming off the young blond. Beside him Sirius snickered. James turned to Narcissa with a pleading look. Cissy just smirked at him and shook her head, meaning it was all on him.
The Malfoy’s main sitting room was crowded, not a chair or couch was left unoccupied. The house elves even had to bring in extra chairs from one of the other sitting rooms. Harry glanced around the room at each person, taking in the scene. Sitting beside him were both his parents, Lily’s arm around his waist, James’ arm wrapped around his shoulders. They hadn’t let him out of their sight even since he’d arrived.
“It is not so secure that a group could sneak in and discover what is going on. A rescue could be possible depending on the security inside.”
Making her way to Harry’s room, she knocked quietly. A soft voice bid her enter and she opened the door. Harry was sitting in the window seat looking out at the Malfoy landscape. He turned his head and smiled at her.
Lily looked at her son. She realized that her boy was more grown up than most people twice his age. All the lies that told that her boy was this ‘Boy-Who-Lived’ and the trials he’d gone through made her baby grow up faster than any other normal child.
“Yes, he is, but he also a wizard and therefore his case is mine. Please have your people send all relevant data to the FBI offices. Mr. Potter, it was wonderful to meet you, but please go through the proper channels next time you are on Government property. We can’t ward every building.”
Gellert choked at the endearment. It had been so long since he’d heard those words coming from the lips of the man he loved. “You said we have a grandson? What’s he like?”
“Some of the younger ones yes, my parents were taken to another place. These men attacked our pack and brought us here. I don’t know how long we have been here.”
After all their things were collected he shrunk the trunks and placed them in his pocket. Sitting on the bed he shook Harry’s shoulder to wake him.
The one thing he did recall was that she had been good at potions, not phenomenal like he was, but good. He supposed it was one thing Granger didn’t loose in the blood adoption.
“Thanks Harry. I just couldn’t sleep.” She leaned into him and he wraped a comforting arm around her shoulder.
Slowly he walked to the bed and stared down at the two of them, the man had dark messy hair and the woman a deep copper. Behind each of those closed eyelids he knew lay bright blue and vibrant green eyes respectively.
“She is very bright, top of most of her classes. Spends most of her time in the library or browbeating Potter and Weasley into doing their schoolwork. I think the chit should have gone into Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor.”
“The Ministry appointed her acting headmistress and she’s decided that the school needs to be more… compliant with the Ministry approved programs and activities. Proper dress code, proper conduct between students, no unauthorized clubs, no magic in hallways… the list goes on. Also with Snape not there she’s had to hire a new potions professor.”
“Petunia!? Oh my poor baby! If that husband of hers ever touched my son…” She began to wail again crying about all that she’d missed with her baby. James and Tom were uncertain how to handle this.
Lucius nodded, “For the most recent ones at least. Fudge has only been in office for twenty years. My lord, there is something else you should know.” He wasn’t sure how his lord would take this news, “Harry Potter’s mother is the daughter of Dumbledore and Grindewald.”
Draco gaped in astonishment. Where’s Dumbledore? And for that matter where was his godfather?! Severus Snape would never have missed his classes no matter how much he complains. He chanced a glance at Harry and gave him an encouraging smile. He smiled back.
“Come on, we have things to do and little time. Go get Granger and the Creevey’s, have them meet us in the potions classroom. I’ll have Harry ready. Father told me to use my portkey.”
Harry smiled, “Yeah. I… uh, have something else to tell you…” he glanced around the room at the team, who suddenly looked busy, “alone.”
“The frontal attackers will split into several groups and create as much chaos as possible to distract the guards. Three or four per group only. Lucius will hand out portkeys to group leaders, after that keep three random apparition points in mind, then head back here. That’s all for now, go and get a good night’s sleep everyone, we leave at first light.”
“Greyback, you have no say in Remus’ life any longer. Besides that, he is an adult and MY MATE. If anyone has the right to order him to remain behind it would be me!”
Draco gave a start as Harry’s weight landed on his lap. His arms automatically wrapped around the petite waist of the Gryffindor so he wouldn’t fall off.
Harry and Hermione smiled at him. Always thinking with his stomach. Together they all went down for dinner.
Lucius spoke up at that, “I might have an answer to that last part. As we all know one of the most major traveling points is Diagon Alley. The Ministry could have placed charms in key locations where so many people passed that possible everyone would have known there was a ‘Dark Lord’ before the next day. That way they can have people believe whatever they want. And theirs the Daily Profit too. Many people read it and it too could have certain charms placed on it and people will believe.”
Severus set Conall on the ground and transfigured a pillow into a toy for him to play with then at on a couch, “Where did he go?”
Sirius Black looked up at the Manor in trepidation. The last time he’d been at this Manor was when Cissa got married and then just a few years later he’d been sent to Azkaban. The only good thing he remembered about the place was his final farewell to his favorite cousin.
The cell he was led to was in the deepest part of the prison with many wards and containment spells surrounding the area. At the door Albus dismissed the warden after the man opened the door.
Tom nodded, “Very well, all those who know the way will side-along anyone who needs help. I can take a few of the children.”
Harry turned to look at his father, “He is certainly inquisitive. So… seven at my hotel, The Merriot?”
Draco sighed and walked towards the door. Together they made their way to the Potions classroom to await the rest of their party.
“Rosier, Gibbon, Lestrange, Avery, Nott, Black, Thurgun, Rovoms, Crabbe, O’Shea, McDougall… Cissa, all these names are Dark families. Not all of them follow the Dark Lord but they practice in Dark Arts.”
“I’m going to St. Mungo’s and talk to Healer Jorgens. He recommended that woman as a mediwitch so he would know who she is.”
Albus had tears in his eyes and his throat constricted. He had to clear his throat to get the words out, “Yes, Gel, it’s me.”
Draco’s eyes widened, “Seven! Harry that’s too soon! Look at me! I’m a mess and he’s coming here. I’m not ready to meet him.”
He knew that he should have stopped Granger from making that potion. Now all their plans will be ruined just because he screwed up. He was lucky that the Master didn’t crucio him for it. He was promised untold riches if he did this and got Granger to marry him. Then the entire Lestrange vaults would be his for the plundering. Not that Granger would have been aware of this.
“Your Godfather called on that mirror of yours. We need to leave Hogwarts. Blaise has gone for Hermione and a few others.”
Tom nodded, “It has been two weeks since you've been here. We will find your parents. Your Alpha is here too.”
The room was made to resemble a simple sitting room, done a muted colors of blue and silver. There was a roaring fire going in a fireplace and a large bearskin lay infront of the fire. The rooms other two occupants sat on oppisite couches faceing said fireplace. They turned at the sound of the door opening.
“Draco, you and Harry need to come back now, bring Ms. Granger and the two Creevey boys, and whoever else you might think would be in danger there from Umbridge.” Lucius said from across the room but loud enough so Draco could hear.
“I came to your house intent on killing you son because of a prophecy about him and I, one that stated that he would have the power to kill me. Peter let me into the house while under a Fidelus charm and I killed James first as he blocked my path to the stairs and then as I came to the bedroom you, Lily, begged me not to kill the boy and you got into the path of the Killing Curse and died. When I went to cast the curse again at the boy it rebounded and struck me. I had been floating in an essence form for ten years possessing snakes and muggles until I came across a Wizard.
The group was silent after everyone had spoken of the events over the last few weeks. Everyone seemed lost in their own thoughts.
“Severus, I have a list of potions what might help us all get our memories back.” Tom said to the potions master.
Draco smiled at him. He acted to child like sometimes. He turned to look at the other beds and was relieved to find them empty. The others must have gone to breakfast already. He didn’t want to hear Nott’s complaints again.
She blushed at separated one paper and gave it to her professor. Snape took the paper and dropped it into the cauldron. There was a flash of smoke as the paper settled on the potion. The two of them peered into the cauldron as the paper absorbed all the potion. Once that was done Snape reached in and withdrew the Bamboo parchment.
Lucius chuckled, “Never thought I’d see the day that Severus Snape would allow James Potter to watch his child.”
Lily frowned at that, her mind was still in a jumble and it was hard to make sence of it all. A face popped in her mind and she growled, “Peter Pettigrew. He threw a stunnung curse at us and then nothing. Tom, please tell me, what’s going on? Where’s my baby?”
The Manor was quiet that night, many of it’s guests lost in thought. Many things had been revealed in that discussion but nothing had concrete evidence. James and Lily Potter seemed to be the only ones not affected by the memory loss. The children who’d been pulled from Hogwarts were shaken up with the fact that the people who raised them were not really their parents.
Severus stood and withdrew his wand. He standing in front of Tom he pointed his wand and said, “Legilimense!”
Lucius stood up to greet his guests, “Albus, thank you for coming through. May I inquire as to who this is?”
“Ten wounded and two casualties, Gibbon and Yates. Twenty four werewolves rescued, some of them not with Greyback’s pack, plus the eleven children you rescued. Severus has been given some healing and nutrient potions. We are all set to head back to the Manor.”
Harry glanced at Draco, his boyfriend for all of six months. Since the beginning of the school year. It was kind of sudden for both of them…
Tom gasped as he awoke his eyes scanning the room. It was empty. He sighed as he realized that they must have gone to see Black. He rolled over to lay on his side and a crinkle of paper caught his attention and he pulled the paper out from under him. The words lept out at him and he realized what made him collapse again.
Next sat Albus and Gellert, the latter man still looked like death warmed over, although some potions from Snape had greatly improved his appearance. Hermione and Blaise were in the last love-seat and Harry smiled as they cuddled together. Scattered throughout the rest of the room sat the ‘muggleborns’.
He was rocking and murmuring soothing words to Harry until he calmed down. Harry pulled away from the blond and looked into his concerned eyes.
Tom was shocked. He’d assumed as everyone else that it didn't matter, born or turned, they were proliferate.
Hermione rolled her eyes, “Don’t look at me like that. You two want to become Auror’s, I need a career as well.”
Draco sneered as Umbridge went to the podium and cleared her throat. Then again. And again. Until McGonagall stood and the Hall quieted. Umbridge gave a sniff in the sudden quiet and then she spoke.
Just them Severus Snape walked into the Hospital wing. He took one look at the Headmaster and rushed to his side. “Albus! What is it?”
Sirius had tears streaming down his face even before James was finished talking. Lily came up to him and folded him into her arms.
“Harry baby, I know that is not true.” Lily saw her son begin to shake his head. She grabbed his face and forced him to look at her. “Vernon is a disgusting person, I knew that when I met him. Please tell me what that man did to you.”
Draco sat on his bed holding a shaking Harry who’d just woken from a nightmare. Ever since his talk with his mother Harry has had a nightmare every night, sometimes more than one. Draco too had nightmares, ones that woke him in a cold sweat. Never in all his years did he contemplate killing someone, until he heard what that monster did to Harry.
Fenrir lifted his nose to the air and gave a sniff. There were definitely werewolves here. Too many others do discern weather they are his pack or not. He gestured to Tom and together they backed out towards where they apparated in.
Something shifted at his left and he tried to stay still and not alert the person that he was aware. A hand felt at his neck feeling for his pulse. The hand was delicate, female.
Lucius glanced at him, “None of this makes any sense. Wizarding children being placed with muggles. They stole my son! My son! Before he was even born! How did they do that?!”
At the door he stopped as Lucius Malfoy came in. “Malfoy, you are sick if you think I’ll ever believe any of this shit your spouting.”
Dumbledore just handed him Harry’s page. Snape stared at it for a minute in total shock. “Lily was your daughter? How is that possible?”
James licked his lips, “So your saying that Lily is not Muggleborn? How do you know this? Did you test her while we were out?”
Hermione nodded and Hagrid removed his hand. Some rustling of leaves alerted them to the approach of Harry and Ron. Hermione turned around as the two boys came into view. Placing a finger to her lips she gestured them foreward.
Tom heaved a sigh, “My memory of that night was of me coming to your house and killing you two and being blasted into oblivion by your baby.” There, he said it.
Fenrir was reunited with ten more of his pack by the time they were back outside to where Tom and the rest of the Death Eaters waited. What surprised him was the dozen children surrounding Tom. He recognized a few and realized that they were children from his pack. A few of those with him also recognized them and ran towards their children. Cries of “Mama or Papa” rang out as the children were reunited with their parent.
The mediwitch looked at the three men, two dark and one fair. All Dark Wizards. She sneered inwardly. Outwardly she gave the man a pitying look, “I am sorry my lord, but the child was stillborn.”
“Please, everyone, call me Tom. I’m believe at this point in time that title is no longer accurate. When all the children get here we will try and sort things out and get everyone’s stories told.”
Lucius was looking at a map of Great Britan, marking any locations that he knew that are Ministry owned. “Here, here and here seem the most likely locations. They are old holding facilities for the Ministry. They were intended as low level prisons for minor offenders and Political prisoners in the old days.”
Fenrir was at a loss of what to say as he didn’t know what damage he was supposed to have done, “I don’t know what you are talking about. What damage? I haven’t seen my cub since he was just a pup, that was over thirty years ago.”
Making sure everything was in order she cast an enervate and the black haired lady awoke with a groan.
Lucius spoke up, “You make an excellent observation Mr. Creevey. I for one would like to know if the muggles knew what was happening.”
Harry and Hermione made their way towards the hospital wing just before dinner. Trailing behind them was Colin and Dennis Creevey. The two brothers were chatting about something Harry couldn’t quite make out. As they entered the hospital Harry noticed some Ravenclaws and a few Hufflepuffs standing nearby. Dean Thomas stood off to one side with Justin Finch-Fletchley.
Severus shook his head, “No, child that is not the way. Wolves mate for life. You should only have one mate, one true mate, who you bond with and stay with, raise cubs together, run through the forest on full moons.”
Hermione smiled broadly as she rejoined them, “Remember that extra credit assignment I told you about? This is one of the ingrediants I need.” She held the single hair aloft.
Tom sighed, there was nothing else to do, he might as well see the werewolf and find out what he wanted, “Send him in, Miggy.”
The deep male voice sent shivers down Ron’s spine, “My Lord, they’ve all gone. Potter, Granger, the Creevey bro-”
Harry nodded his head, “I’m sure, I want to replace the bad memories with something good. Something that would help me heal, to know that it isn’t supposed to be painful.”
Snape sighed, “A student of mine came to me asking for an extra credit assignment. I gave her a potions book and told her to pick one potion. She picked the Bloodline and Heritage Potion.”
James came up to her and enveloped his wife in his arms, “We won’t, Lils, I promise you that. Just keep in mind that there are others who’d like a crack at them. Myself included.”
“Not much really, she was a midwife from St. Mungo’s. She was recommended by the Head Healer at the time, Kelston Jorgens, I believe.” Lucius ran a hand through his hair.
“Luc, what…?” Narcissa stopped at the look in her husbands eyes. He only ever looked like this when he was on a war-path.
A/N: I apologize for the lateness of this chapter… I kind of lost my muse for this story and life seemed to pull me further away… Thank you for your patience… Kalendral
Dumbledore raised his eyes to the matron’s, tears trickled down his cheek, “All this time and I never knew. He was so good with stasis spells. To have held his condition in stasis for twenty years…”
Slowly they crept towards the edge of the wards. Tom could see the buildings just on the other side about a kilometer away. There were just a few guards on duty that he could see.
Tom was sitting at his desk contemplating Fenrir Greyback’s predicament. The news of Remus Lupin being Greyback’s son came as a shock to all those at the manor. Many of the children are disbelieving, but a dip into the penseive confirmed Fenrir’s story. At the moment he and Lucius are sitting down with the werewolf to discuss possible locations of Fenrir’s missing packmates.
He growled at her, “They’re gone. Looked everywhere. The others have reported that most of the Muggleborns are gone… Creevey’s, Finch-Fletchley, Thomas, Cartwright… all of them.”
Severus stared at the girl, very surprised. Separated from a pack for so long and all she knows is what the Ministry told her. He sighed heavily. It was going to be a long night. He was just glad that the full moon was a week away. That would give his mate and Tom time to rescue him.
“We are not entirely certain but it seems as if the Ministry wants there to be war. They want the Light families to be against the Dark families. It makes no sence to us at the moment.” Rodolphus sighed. “We just don’t have all the facts.”
Sighing heavily he moved to the bed and layed down next to the man he’d been in love with for 90 years.
“Yes, sir, all done. It just needs the bamboo paper to soak into and five minutes after that my blood.”
Lucius nodded grimly and opened the door infront of him. If these two people were sane and have been in here all this time under false charges they might be willing to side with them, against the ministry.
Bella pulled back and Rodolphus pulled her into a hug, “They have no mind left. I cast the first cruciatis and then everything went downhill from there. You have to understand, baby, I was desperate. We had such a hard time conceiving you that the healers said that I’d only have the one. Then the Aurors showed up and we were shipped off the Azkaban.”
Tears began to fall down Harry’s cheeks. There was no hiding it now. Everyone will know how much of a freak he really was. Now no one will love him. Draco will leave him and he will be sent back to that hellhole to be his Uncles punching bag and house elf, not to mention those other things.
Tom swept through the house towards the library in hopes of finding a spell or potion that would return his memory to him. He also decided that some kind of rejuvenation potion would probably help in making him look more human. He realized that his snakelike appearance would possible scare Sirius away before they even got back together, including their son.
Colin looked at Sirius Black curiously. After all he’d been told he still seemed confused about some things. He turned to the Headmaster, “Professor, what about our par-” he stopped unsure as to how to word his question.
Her racket roused the man sleeping next to her and he moaned. “Lils?” His voice was row with disuse but Lily heard and her wailing stopped.
Harry was nervous as he waited for Jethro Gibbs to rejoin him. He’d never had a father figure in his life and was uncertain how to handle the situation. In his own letter from his father, or carrier, James just mentioned how understanding and passionate Jethro had been, but also very straightforward. They’d only known each other for a few days so there wasn’t much he knew about the man.
“No!” Harry yelled rushing into the bathroom and turning Draco to face him, “You were forced into it. Never call yourself that again.” Harry was dismayed that Draco would call himself that. He knew what the blonde Veela went through, forced to carry out Voldemort’s plans to kill Dumbledore.
Tom held up a hand, “We are forgetting a few things Lucius. We need to figure out who is behind all this. If we start reversing things now whoever it is will be alerted and we will have a more difficult time finding this person. The best thing is to see if we can restore our own memories first, then perhaps we will be able work together more ably. For now, I think that we all should get some rest. Many of us have had some startling news dropped on them.”
Harry and Ron exchanged glanced that stated that the bushy haired witch was crazy and went back to their essays.
“Gibbs knows me, Mr. Potter, only just as an FBI agent. I am also special liaison for the US Magical Ministry. The Secretary of Defense personally offered me this job fifteen years ago. Agent Gibbs and I have work together many times.”
Lily seethed at him, “He’s my baby, James, my baby and she allowed that… that MONSTER to rape him! I am not just gonna sit here and let that man get away with what he did to Harry!”
“I watched as she added a drop of her own blood to the page.” He pulled the very page out of his robes. He stared at the words, possible hoping that they would change. “She did the potion correctly, there were no mistakes.” He handed the paper over to Lucius.
“Sleeping, but I have a question. Mrs. Malfoy just showed up at our door asking to see him, she was nervous. Do you know what’s going on? No one has told us anything. You guys just pulled us out of Hogwarts with no warning.” Colin grumbled.
She stood unsteadily and aproached the door. Tom pulled out his want and the door opened with a simple alohamora. She stepped through and threw herself at Lucius sobbing. They exchanged a few quiet words that Tom didn’t hear then pulled apart.
Harry glanced up into the aristocratic face of Narcissa Malfoy and gave a small start of surprise. The woman bore a startling resemblance to Sirius. He gaped at her.
“Yes, like your sister. Now that I think about it throughout her twenty years with us I recall quite a few infant deaths.”
“I will never call you that. You are my mate and I will defend you until my dying breath.” Harry vowed looking into Draco’s eyes.
James gave a chuckle, “He fainted when I told him the he and Sirius were lovers. Knocked his head on the end table.”
Draco sat thoughtful for a few minutes and decided, “Let’s wait until Severus is brought home. Let’s see how you feel after a few more days of rest.”
A growl pushed it’s way past his lips before he knew what he was doing. Flashbacks of the orphanage came to the forefront of his mind, of the matron forcing him into a cage for punishment. His worst was when she’d brought a priest and tried to have him exorcised of ‘bad spirits’. Three days later they’d found the priest dead with no apparent wounds.
Fenrir then became aware of who was in the room. He recognized the Malfoy’s and Black of course, and there was Dumbledore who was sitting next to another man who looked like he’d seen better days. Sitting in a sofa across from the Headmaster was two others, a man and a woman. The man had messy black hair and hazel eyes and the woman had reddish brown hair and bright green eyes.
Narcissa came over to him and pulled him into a hug, “They didn’t know, at least Dumbledore didn’t know that Lily was his daughter. When we showed the professor this paper he was shocked. His theory was that Grindewald put a strong stasis charm over the baby once he realized he was pregnant and after he was put into prison the spell began to wear off.”
With a heavy sigh he stood with Gellert still wrapped in his arms. He then transfigured the bench into a comfortable couch and laid Gellert down, covering him with his cloak. Moving over to the fireplace he pulled a pinch of floo powder from within his robes. Lighting the fire and throwing a pinch he called out, “Malfoy Manor!” and stuck his head into the flames.
“Yes, Harry, that’s exactly what I’m saying. Lucius and I traced the reports of all suspected stillborn babies. The mediwitch who delivered Rosalind was also present for many other stillbirths that we suspect were not really stillbirths, but children stolen and placed with muggles to raise.”
The very next morning Hermione began preparing her potion. Most of the ingredients were bought at an apothecary. The Dragons blood was shipped from Romania by Charlie Weasley at her request. All she needed now was the Venom from Professor Snape.
Steeling himself for the confrontation he entered. The warden came up to him and asked what he wanted. When Albus told him the man paled but eventualy took hm to where he wanted to go.
Draco yelled from the bathroom, “All the more reason to be at our best, Harry. I’m probably not what he’d expect for a son-in-law for his only child. After all I am a Dea-”
A little known fact about werewolves was that they could detect a lie and Remus knew that the man before him was telling the truth, as he saw it. That was the problem, does he listen to what his instincts are telling him or what the wizarding world was told by the ministry, who now seems to be behind so many kidnappings over the last sixty years or more.
Harry still cannot believe that his parents were alive and here. For his entire life he was led to believe that they were dead… that they’d died for him, killed by Lord Voldemort… the same man who stood not ten feet from him and his scar never hurt. Then to find out that he never was ‘Lord Voldemort’ and was dating his godfather… plus that Colin was their child. It was a lot to take in.
The man didn’t seem to notice him at first, then stopped and took in his face. Recognition was the first thing followed by shock. He seemed to get over his shock quickly though as he took in Harry’s presence.
The person that came in was bloody but Fenrir could tell by smell that it was his cub. He rushed to Remus’ side and rolled him over. A gash was across his shoulder and blood flowed freely.
“What do you mean, Tom. I’ve always known your name, Tom Marvolo Riddle.” What was Tom playing at? Why was he acting like this. “What’s going on? Where’s Sirius? Where’s Harry? How’s my little boy? How long has it been?”
The mediwitch tisked and began to make her preparations. After making sure the lady wouldn’t wake, she made her incision and gently pulled the baby from the woman’s womb.
Harry slipped into Draco’s room after all the excitement died down. Draco was sitting on a plush chair reading what looked like a potions book. He glanced up at Harry as he came closer.
“Dumbledore theorized that Grindewald placed you in a stasis charm, and when he was sent to prison the charm began to weaken and finally wore off. After you were born they put you with Muggles, what they’d been doing to all Dark children they could get their hands on.”
Draco frowned, “But mum, we were just there not three days ago. What’s going on, where’s Uncle Sev and Professor Dumbledore. They aren’t here.”
As one they rushed the gate, firing off spells and hexes at the defenders. His only command to his troops was no Unforgivables and any werewolf they came across was to be stunned and bound. If his plan was successful they’d be able to liberate all the wolves and shut down this little operation that the Ministry was running.
Rodolphus gave a heavy sigh and ran a hand through his hair, “Our sources led us to Frank and Alice Longbottom. By that time we were at our wits end. I know they knew something and after the last time Alice told us to leave Bella lost it. You have no idea how much we regret what we did that night. It has haunted us for the last thirteen years.”
“So it’s all true then? Everything? Kids being taken from their parents and given to Muggles?” Sirius asked.
Fenrir was taken aback at the intensity of the others hatred in those amber blue eyes. He broke eyes contact and glanced at the boy clinging to him. He smelled of wolf, but not quite. He then noticed the other person sitting with them and his eyes widened. Severus Snape was staring at Tom Riddle intently as if hoping the man would die on the spot.
“Did you seriously just ask me if I’m Remus’ bit-…” Sirius stopped himself before he finished the word, much to the werewolf’s relief. “Well, I’m not. I’m actually his dog. You know Snuffles? Handsome fellow, yeah? No, I’m an animagus, that’s why.” He was silent as the woman responded. “Look, Nessie, your dogs are pretty, but dumb as Bertie Bott’s Beans. What? No, I guess they didn’t get sent to Azkaban for murder, but I didn’t actually kill anyone. No, hold on.”
It was a selfish wish, but seeing as Dobby was willing to visit, Draco hoped that the wish wasn’t actually one which would harm the elf.
Grindelwald steps closer, lowering his voice to a whisper which is evidently for me, and me alone. He acts as if we are sharing a secret, and I lean into it, allowing the secret to become ours, and not simply whispered to me.
Their guest room consisted of a square space with a bathroom connected to it. There was a wardrobe, a fireplace and a desk, both of which were no doubt older than Remus yet far sturdier than he. The most notable piece of furniture was the canvas bed which was large enough for two people, yet not overly grand. It was very soft, almost too soft for the man who was far more used to his bed being hard, although not really hard in an unpleasant manner.
“You might wanna jump into the water as well,” Chang turned towards Pat and helped her up to her feet. “You look like you could use a good soak.”
The woman straightened up and shook her head in a collected manner, smiling absently at the memory of meeting her husband for the first time. “He greeted me, and we walked back to our common room in silence, as I attempted to and failed to think of any subject of which to speak to him of. We would later make up for our lacking communication over the years to come, yet I recall the silence with some manner of comfort, rather than despair. After all, Lucius was older than me, and back then I still struggled to be verbal around people who surpassed me in age due to my upbringing.”
“There is a lot more I’d like to show you about El and me… Would you mind if we took it in shorter sessions so as to not overwhelm me? I am not young anymore, this is hard on me.” The old wizard looked at his trembling hands and drew a shallow, faint breath.
“Thank you, Professor Umbridge.” He turned towards the students once more, still smiling. Then, he followed by giving the same speech of every year, mostly addressing the first year students.
“No matter how I choose to phrase it to myself, I find it hard to believe that to be the singular and sole reason as to why I joined them. All I know for certain is that it took a long time, far longer than I’d like to admit, until I realised the weight of my mistake. No, I should refer to it as it was: my choice. Until I truly saw myself for what I had become, and what I had allowed to slip through my fingers. One of the reasons I stayed was probably because I would have to admit it all to leave, and thus tried harder to convince myself that I had not made the wrong choice." The former Death Eater breathed deeply once more, steadying himself against the weight of his own words.
“I don’t want to be their brother, coworker and business partner is fine!” Teddy laughed as he ducked under Ron’s arm and poked him in the side. The two were quickly engaged in a play fight, which Teddy stood no chance of winning in terms of strength.
He had attempted to have this talk many times before, yet she had always rejected him by using her fantasies as a shield against reality. However, reality had long since cracked that shield in a great number of places. Perhaps it was cruel to shatter that shield in favor of giving Luna real tools to help her, yet Harry concluded that if he could cause her to break the shield together with him, it might hurt Luna less.
“I have never been too personally defined by my position as the Head of the Slytherin House,” Severus’ voice was quiet, accompanying the rustling of the leaves as naturally as if he was part of the silent but cold forest. “Yet it has been a source of pride. I find it almost curious that, now that I have lost it, I do not feel more upset or even emotional. In fact, it feels ever so relieving to not be asked to assist children while I am not currently…” He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, sighing in earnest tiredness. “...Functional.”
There was only one explanation which could serve to understand why mother and son had both begun to act strangely.
The group of friends turned towards Ginny and the door, which had swung open at her touch. Some of them stared at her, as she stared at her hand, but Harry’s gaze was focused on the spot where his dad should have been, yet where he was not. There was no trace of Remus whatsoever, and neither blood nor anything else upon the floor to signal that a bleeding man had ever laid upon it.
Harry couldn’t resist standing up once more and placed a hand a little away from Draco’s mouth and nose, only to confirm that he was still breathing. On the way back, Harry had to stop himself from kissing Draco’s forehead, only managing to do so when he was just about to allow his lips to touch the skin. Harry sat down, feeling ashamed and rather creepy over almost having kissed a person who by the definition of the word, could not consent.
The book was included in her letter, which claimed the book to have been sullied by the Mudblood’s touch and could therefore not remain in the noble Malfoy library. Both the letter and the book passed Bellatrix’s watchful gaze, and the two were sent off to Hermione.
However, Remus whispered to Harry that adding a few runes which do not destabilise the entire magic circle is a lot harder than Sirius gives it credit for being.
Ron licked his lips, his wand was ready in his hand as he kept a close eye on the animal. “No… that is a snake.”
Somewhere behind them, coming down the same way as all of them had, the two Lestrange husbands appeared, with the smaller being carried by the larger. The taller husband ran over to his wife but when he noticed that Draco lay bleeding upon the ground, he turned to her with rage reflected in the otherwise calm face.
, which, according to Sirius, was the only book worth his time in his family library. Harry found this to be untrue, as the library did have a copy of
Pat didn’t like the way that Vince treated Draco. It had been different when she was younger, and he had kept Draco in check by means of punishing him with silence for the things which he had most definitely done. Yet it was very different to see her boyfriend, who was almost twice as big as Draco in both directions, use the physical advantages he had to keep the almost blood traitor in check.
It’s annoyingly clear what he is asking of me. He could simply have said it yet he does not. He expects me to offer on my own, because then I made the choice, even if he gave me no choice but to make it. I reach for El’s necklace, moved by nostalgia and longing, but I catch my hand within the movement and instead use it to scratch my neck. I should cut my beard, but I keep on forgetting. The color has begun to fade into grey, rather than the hair color of my birth. I push my thoughts about my aging away as I make the choice which the Headmaster wants me to make.
“Oh, me? Sure!” Harry felt a little like a teacher had asked him to answer a question when he hadn’t really been following the lesson. He took a moment to gather his thoughts together, then began to tell the Headmaster about his dreams.
“It was none of your business!” Rabastan yelled back as he deflected the second spell as well, then quickly tried to throw another back at Sirius.
Sirius had only grabbed his pillows from his own room, which he avoided to the most part. Partly because the room scared him. He felt like if he spent too much time in there, time would start moving backwards, and he would find himself as a teenager once more, with his mother waiting outside the door, ready to blame him for everything he had ever done and shame him for all that he didn’t do. Spending time in his old room made him feel small, it made him feel vulnerable, and it made him miss the Potters, and James, so much that it physically hurt. So much so that he thought that his heart would stop beating with how heavy it felt inside that horribly familiar room.
Sirius had just managed to fall asleep when he heard knocking on his door. His new room was rather small, but the bed was soft. The room was a square, with a fireplace and a bed, but nothing more. Sirius had brought a chair in, which was now balancing a great number of clothes, all of which had been carelessly stacked on top of one another. There was a bathroom next door, so Sirius hadn’t quite cared about bringing anything else to the room. The books he had gotten from the library were all so painfully boring that they now laid strewn about on the floor, where Sirius hoped that they would be absorbed by the brown carpet.
“Yeah, I mean… You’re not wrong.” Sirius licked his lips, laughing nervously. “But that doesn’t mean I condone fighting your werewolf friend. It was a little less tense when we were kids and just playing around, but an adult werewolf is rather big and strong.” The man blabbered on without seemingly any direction.
“...And that is why we can’t let anyone know what is happening at the Manor,” Molly finished. She waited, with her heart somewhere between her throat and her chest as Andromeda Tonks remained silent on the other end, no doubt thinking about what she had learned.
Benny slowly rose to his feet and walked over to hug Sirius once more, holding him close as if Sirius was something fragile, yet highly valuable. It meant a lot to the former prisoner and almost murderer to be allowed the comfort of an authority figure. Remus was a wonderful and supportive friend, yet having the man Sirius thought of as his dad hug him meant more to him than he had been willing to realise.
“Besides, sending more people to Azkaban would only make it easier for them to break out again,” Bill Weasley spoke up. “Even if we did put the entire operation at risk and did leave with a few more prisoners to Azkaban, they would likely be out again soon enough, as the dementors continue to fail as guards.
They made it to the actual chamber before Harry heard a response. He quickly signalled to Draco that the basilisk was approaching, but he needn’t bother, since Draco had heard her large body come nearer.
“My blood,” Albus smiled but without joy. “My heart. It will allow you to bypass the magic of the Pensieve without harm, as it is blood locked to me. I do believe you know what that magic is?” He followed up with a rather Professor-like inquiry.
“Bella,” Rodolphus slowly stood up as well and approached his wife, carefully trying to reason with her as she more or less vibrated with anger. “It’s not a problem… let him go. He cannot stop what is about to happen.”
“It’s been lonely. I’m really not used to that loneliness,” Harry sighed in regards to his predicament before he reached out to gently grab the vial from Draco once more, then proceeded to gently help him with his right hand, much to his best friend’s relief. “It makes me so very happy to know you missed me. I missed your company terribly.” Harry added as he averted his gaze from his friend’s beautiful face. He recalled those feelings which had begun to flutter in his mind when he had first realised that he was interested in Draco, about two years ago.
Harry shuddered. He did not at all enjoy the idea of sharing a connection with the Dark Lord, even less one which was based on his own stolen blood. Harry absently wondered if this was how Sirius felt, knowing that he was related to plenty of unpleasant people whose views he did not share.
There are a lot of ‘the’ missing in most of his sentences, but I leave it be. I can still understand him, it feels petty to correct him. I keep my gaze upon the frozen path before us as I find myself too overwhelmed by his attention to actively look at him when he is looking at me.
Teddy and Ron cheered them on as they left together and walked towards the familiar dungeons. To Harry, it felt as if he was returning home and thus it was with a uncomfortable ache that he recalled that he wasn’t as much home as he was only temporarily visiting the dungeons.
