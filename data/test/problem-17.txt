, ever, I’ll get it for you. If you needa name—you needa name?" He tapped the centre of Draco's chest. Not so hollow, he thought. "No problem. You can have mine. I'll give you my name if you want.”
He kissed the knob of Harry's neck and squeezed him tighter. "You were there. The coins kept coming, and I was worried about how to package them all to get them home."
Harry closed his eyes tightly and made himself go limp, giving himself over, even as all the alarm bells were clanging at full-force, that
"That tart," Ron breathed, reading the letter over Harry's shoulder. "You know you're the only one in the department she's ever baked biscuits for, right?"
Harry shook his head, lips smashed tightly. He'd hoped for a greasy bite of takeaway, a long bath, and sleep, but by the seductive lip-biting Draco kept throwing his way while Alex talked and talked, and the rosemary gin and tonic he'd pressed into his hand, Harry could tell that he was in for a different sort of night altogether.
"Don't bother thinking about it that way. Draco's never met an unhealthy coping mechanism he didn't like, and some of them have a way of sticking around longer than others."
"It was a good choice," he admitted after a minute. Draco tilted his head, said nothing. The silence that descended was so unlike him that Harry flicked on the wireless. Something jazzy and ethereal filled the air.
“You owe me,” Harry whispered as he tightened his grip on Malfoy’s ice-cold arm from where he’d slung it across his shoulders. He couldn't tell when the tops dragged inelegantly on the floors to the showers, rug burn rising red against blue-white flesh.
He gave some sort of goodbye to Collins, then curled into the chair in the hallway across from the door he could not pass. Two new Aurors had been brought into the ward with minor injuries, but if they spoke to Harry when they passed in the hall, he wouldn't know it.
"I can get in from here, thanks," Draco said, but there was no gusto to it. He frowned down at the device in his hand, and then looked to Harry, caught between answering with him there, or waiting for him to leave, and the feeling of being looked over, of being shunted aside finally set to boil Harry’s resentment.
"You’ve got a swimmer's body," he said as he admired the sharp line of his shoulders and how intensely his torso narrowed at his waist, down to straight hips. Harry made a note to get Draco out of his trousers next he saw him—his legs were some secret thing he hadn't yet seen properly.
"Do I not look alright?" he asked. It came out tetchy. He was losing the battle with himself, and this was only his first appointment of the day.
"Usually, I didn’t like it because I didn’t trust the other person, and they didn’t care. About me. And that's because usually when I'd pull, it was with men who'd take one look at me and see a stand-in for the barely legal twinks in their favourite porn clips, and they'd want to fuck me like it was a porn clip, and it was awful." Draco's fingers trailed aimlessly across Harry's chest, and he settled in closer. Harry arranged the blanket around them as best he could—the window remained open, a chill descending that was so complete that their breaths were clouds of mist. "I’d pretend it was fine, out of laziness or lack of care or loneliness, maybe, and because it was easy." Draco wiped a cheek, and Harry kissed his hair and held that hand, closed it close to his chest. "This isn’t that, though. I knew I’d like it with you. And I did—you have to know I did?"
Harry would never get over the feeling of waking up to another body behind his. It was too good to be true—shins available to warm perpetually cold feet against. To turn and take in the face that left him breathless—hair so light that gentle breath fanned it up and off the milk-white skin of his brow, smooth in sleep. The slightly aquiline nose, eyelids framed by fans made of translucent thread. Scars, four, he knew, now that he'd had so much time to look. The fishhook above the cupid’s bow, a scratch slicing through one eyebrow, a tiny crater left behind by childhood Dragonpox, and a horizontal line on his left cheekbone—the same place Harry had one. All the fine bone work made up an austere face, and those lips, those fucking lips, pursed to form words while dreaming. Harry got a thrill from watching Draco sleep, mining for sense in the things he sometimes whispered, forehead wrinkled by worry, fingers gripping at something just out of reach.
Draco’s eyes opened back up, grabbing for his wand to clean himself up, buckling his belt again. He sat up from Harry’s lap, but didn’t move off him completely, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. He turned his attention back to the game, boy had it changed since Harry had been enveloped in Draco.
“Draco’s moving into Grimmauld with me.” Harry mumbled, to his complete shock, Ron yanked him into such a tight hug he was sure he could barely breathe.
Sometimes knowing too much can be dangerous, there's a reason the saying is 'curiosity killed the cat'
This left Harry and Draco alone in a room together for the first time since sixth year, the silence in the air was deep, it brought back memories of train compartments and broken bones; both of them realising they had no clue how to talk to each other without fighting. "Potter" Malfoy's voice was thick, it was rich, it was as if there was no shake, tremor or any sense of fear in it this year. "Don't even try it Malfoy, i'm not dealing with your crap this year, so can we just leave each other alone so I cant get through this bloody year." The boy in front of him faded a little bit, stepping back; he looked..disappointed? For a split second Harry thought he'd got a single sliver of emotion out of Malfoy, but then the boy rolled his eyes. "Don't be so ridiculous Potter, you would be dead if it wasn't for me" Harry scowled, moving closer to Malfoy. "As much as I am thankful, all you did was throw a piece of wood to me, we're hardly building a church in your honour" Harry cursed, Malfoy merely smirked, cocking his head to the side. "Well, a church would be ironic" and he waltzed off into the bathroom again.
He needed his education, he had the ministry practically knocking down his door to join the auror team but they wouldn't take him if he had no bloody clue what he was doing. Plus Hermione would probably kill him if he didn't get his NEWTs.
Potter was mumbling nervously, not meeting Draco’s eye. “Look Harry, you just had a panic attack, It’s not exactly the right time to start an argument with you.” he leaned back against the arm of the sofa. “As soon as we leave this room we can go back to hating each other.” Draco let one of his arms fall naturally over the back of the sofa, the other one resting in his hair. Potter got up, walking over to the drinks cart that had just appeared at his request, he poured two glasses of wine, heading back over to the sofa and handing one to Draco.
If possible, Harry’s jaw dropped even more. “Don’t I get a say in this?” Ginny shook her head. He sighed, knocking back a shot.
"Harry I can almost hear you thinking." Harry looked up to see Hermione with her arms crossed, her hair getting slightly frizzy because of the humidity in the classroom. Harry shook his head, "I'm fine 'mione , just not been in school for a while s'all" Hermione was not at all convinced, she walked over to the other side of the desk, picking up his ingredients and helping him finish his potion. He smiled the biggest smile he had since the war.
When he first read the letter the idea has seemed entirely ridiculous, but after some thought it really didn't sound so bad.
He decided that he needed to speak to Ron, apologise first, and then ask where it all came from. He gathered up his stuff, ignoring the pain in his neck when he stood up. Looking back at the room one more time before leaving.
"You don't think that was a little much, considering that ten minutes ago you were afraid that we were being followed by reporters?" Draco pulled on the cigarette and raised his brows but not his voice. He didn't seem particularly angry. Annoyed, perhaps.
"Smart. Maybe I'll see you there later. Just do me a favour and don't tell the papers." Harry imagined what Victoria would say if she were there and cringed. "Actually, don't tell anyone. Whatever they offer to pay you, I'll pay double."
"The last time I took a taxi, the cabbie locked all the doors and told me I could pay with my mouth, so." He washed his hands over his face, still not looking at Harry. "So, I'd rather not do that, again, thanks."
The familiar riot of overlarge bells jingled as he stepped through the door. Lucky for Harry, Fatima didn't carry children's sizes, and he breathed a sigh of relief. The owner looked up from the conversation she was having with the lone other customer in the shop at the counter. Harry pulled back his hood so that he could offer her a small smile before bowing his head to hide his face again.
"I talked to my parents, and my godfather, Sirius, and Professor Lupin too. I thought I'd be scared, but I was finished. Exhausted."
The look on Ginny's face was priceless as she scrolled through a Rolodex of compromising situations that Harry had been privy to. As amusing as it was to see her face twist in horror, Harry was elated to hold Draco's eyes, eyes that genuinely seemed happy, knowing that though there would be awkwardness to come, and sometimes grief or anger, that if Draco Malfoy and Ginny Weasley could give one another a chance and hit it off the way Harry had known they
He sat on the bed and ran nervous fingers through his hair, over and over, the scratch at his scalp good but not-quite-as-good as when Draco did it for him. When he used to pet him, and press kisses into his skin, and narrate all the things he would do to and for him—Harry knew that he need to re-write those memories.
That he'd even ask, even semi-jokingly laid bare too clearly how little stock he put into the steadfastness of their friendship. To them, it was bedrock. To him, it was thin, plaster—something that could be broken through or worn away, something that had to be checked in on.
"What I want is you, Draco. If we can't go back to before, then I want to try something new. If you'll have me." He put down his wand at last and outstretched his hand, palm up on the table. It rested inches from Draco's, still curled tightly around the bulb of his wine glass.
"No, Potter," Draco said, and Harry tensed up. He put the items down on the cupboard beside him with a sigh. "I really am at my limit."
His reaction and clear and able use of his hands due to their firm grip on the pillow was enough to stop Draco from attempting further massage, his weight sinking in next to Harry's onto the bed. Soon, the pillow was tugged away, and Draco used it to prop up his head, lying tip to toe alongside Harry, facing up while he remained belly down.
"Are you hungry?" Harry asked, concern bubbling up inside him. He'd purposefully ignored the possibility of this kind of awkward reception from Draco, but now that it was happening, the feeling returned full-force.
In all, he'd barely fallen at all, a handful of metres altogether, but the resulting incline of the hill had sent him deep into the woods from where he'd started.
"I volunteered, and was positively affirmed that our presence wasn't required inside," Percy said. Harry gave a curt nod of his head.
"It doesn't matter what it's like! It's going to look like I rode your dick for a promotion, and you know what? Now they won't be half wrong."
"Good different or bad different?" Harry asked. He had the distinct feeling that though all the blocks composing his being were solid, he was unravelling. It was as if the glue that held him together was not quite strong enough to keep bricks from slipping out of place. His thoughts had become overrun by Draco, his moods dictated by the duration of time that had elapsed since they'd seen one another. It was like he didn't know how to function properly outside their arrangement, doing all the other things as he'd always done them—on auto-pilot, only with slightly more gusto and on less sleep.
"What?" Feeling Draco pull his hand from his grip, Harry redoubled it. "No! No, absolutely not. I just know that others—everyone is better at
"My favourite patient," he boomed. "Dressing up for me? I've never had someone put in such effort for the last visit."
He moaned as Harry shifted down the bed and leant over, nose pressed into the spot where his ribs met in the centre and placed a kiss there. He sewed a line down, achingly slow, breathing in the scent of Draco's skin. It was everything to him, indescribable—warm, and deep, and alive.
"I appreciate that you all want to see the patient, but it's going to be a while before he's able to take visitors, or be questioned."
It was just as he was going to do something rash, something malicious and ill-informed, that Harry noticed a plain card on the table. It was hardly a note, just two words and some initials scratched hastily with a quill.
"Close your eyes for me," he said, his voice low but demanding, and Harry did as he was told. He raised his hands above his head and gripped at the blanket, bunching it in his hands as Draco rose up over him on all fours, one hand snaking down his belly until it met with his shaft, rapidly stiffening under his touch.
, from the person Draco had become. To see him now, like this—this wasn't the Draco that Harry remembered at all. This was darkness, and emptiness and Harry was surprised at how tidy the house seemed, considering that it was the place that this version of Draco had been haunting so long.
With a groan of my own, I extracted myself from Draco's embrace and the sheets as I stumbled toward the bathroom.
‘And what requirements might we require?’ My quill seemed to elongate and exaggerate the ‘require’ in this note on its own before I slid it back to him.
As we returned to our seats, I was surprised to hear a more than half-hearted applause from our peers. Hermione beamed at me proudly, and the corner of my lip quirked in return.
"Er… Usually… You-Know-Who… Sometimes watching my friends and family die… My father…" Now it was my turn to swallow.
I glanced back to see Draco recognize the situation, turn bright red, and retreat from the room with the rest of the students. I sighed.
"You know full well you're not just a Gryffindor. Don't let it go to your head, but… You've earned the right to a
have stopped him. Recasting my cloaking charm, I swore under my breath and wrapped my towel around my waist. Hermione was waiting for me on my bed, swinging her legs gleefully. After the initial
"Now… I'm usually the type to do the bare minimum, but since there's so many sources, there may end up being a lot more effort than it's worth here."
"If it's you, it'll work," I promised. Once his cognitive abilities kicked back in, he smiled back at me.
Once Herbology ended, we packed up our things and walked to Charms together. If I thought paying attention in class was difficult before, it was impossible now. We kept catching each others' eye and grinning like a couple of idiots. At one point, Draco mimed writing with his quill toward my bag, and I withdrew our note-passing sheet for him.
Somehow, I was still able to move slowly back into him as the sight of my own contorted face formed behind my eyelids.
Our dream found us sitting across from each other on the Hogwarts Express. Seeing Harry there, I immediately remembered this was a dream.
"Alright, alright! Shut up about it already." She pressed her smiling lips together and poked my arm repeatedly. I rolled my eyes, but couldn't fight the smile crawling back onto my face. "Nothing officially even happened."
Still, I was acutely aware of him sitting four desks over and one desk behind me. The one time I happened to glance back, he was already looking at me. Once our eyes met, he dropped his gaze and his cheeks turned bright red. My curiosity nearly drove me to invade his thoughts again, but I forced myself to turn around.
I stared at the words for a few moments, remembering our first interaction. Before I could think to reply, he snatched the page back and scrawled something else. When he finally slid it back onto my desk, it was much slower than before.
Harry jostled his elbow into my rib, and it seemed to sink all the way into my heart and squeeze. For some reason, it made me want to cry, but I redirected that energy to squeeze his hand instead. With his hand in mine, we were the only two people in the entire world, and I could do anything.
So embarrassed was I by this question that I simply slid the paper back onto his desk. This was rewarded with Harry's stifled chuckle. I silently blushed next to him for several good minutes of Slughorn's lecture before he returned the page with a quickly-fading message.
The piece of Riddle's soul that used to be in this journal was now dead, but the magical properties of disappearing anything written on it had remained. I scrawled a simple note for him.
'Pansy was just for appearance's sake. Truth be told, we hated one another. Still do, if I'm honest.'
The ever-eloquent Ron said nothing, instead snatching various breakfast foods from the table and loading up his plate.
looked at him. His hair was unkempt, as always, and his scar just barely peeked through the tangled brown mess on his forehead. Dark circles hung beneath his eyes, and I was shocked to realize I hadn't noticed them before.
Word had seemed to spread like wildfire, because, as we walked hand-in-hand to Charms, the whispers followed us like an Oppugno charm. I found it didn’t bother me as much as I thought it would’ve, though. And it wasn’t just because the hand in mine happened to vanquish the Dark Lord, but because it was
I winced at the actual, physical pain it caused me to sympathize with the git. McGonagall's words echoed in my head,
Draco calmly took his seat, but even without looking, I could tell something happened. Maybe several things? The energy I was picking up from him was all over the place.
“Mmf-!” I exclaimed in surprise. Once he released me, his face was bright red. Mine was likely similar, so warm were my cheeks.
My head spun as I considered the possibility that McGonagall had predicted we'd have such chemistry. And if so,
The question of Potter's ulterior motives drove Draco to his next class. He intended to quietly observe if he was giving anyone else the same kind of attention, but halfway to the Astronomy tower, he realized where he was going and halted.
A loud clattering drew my eyes up out of my lap finally and startled the shit out of me. Finnegan had dropped his fork and was staring at me in shock, his face paler than I'd ever thought possible for a Scot.
I watched him leave, and once the class was empty but for just Sinistra and me, I turned to her and swallowed.
“Right, I’m going to talk to Hooch after lunch and ask her to hold me to the same bar as everyone else. She’ll
Harry moaned with every movement. His brow was knotted seemingly in concentration, but his fingers on my neck relaxed.
“Morning.” The muttered responses were underwhelming, but Hermione took one glance at us and snickered into her porridge.
Again, where I searched for anger to draw up around myself, I found none. Only gratitude for McGonagall (and Harry) presented itself. Frustration wrinkled my brow as the rest of the class started filtering into the room. I sat upright and tried to nonchalantly pull out my textbook and parchment.
"Um… Er… Well, I… Think you're incredibly brave, and kind, and strong of character. I'm… Very grateful to you, but I'm sure everyone is, too, so…"
Harry looked incredibly sad, but I was too curious to filter my questions. How many people could say they'd used
“Not bloody likely. ‘Mione’s got me doing all sorts of studying after school, I’d never have the time.”
‘It’s no saving the world’ was what I’d decided on. After I’d slid the note back onto his desk, he wrote only my name before shooting me a frown.
Of course, no one said anything. Everyone looked, to be sure of who was so late, but immediately turned back to the lesson. Not even a mention from Slughorn. With gritted teeth, I slid into the seat Hermione had saved for me.
We weren't to Hogwarts yet, but we'd pulled into a station I didn't recognize. Surely this was the turning point I'd expected from the beginning. Harry came to sit beside me, gripping my hand silently. A multitude of footsteps was growing louder until finally, our compartment door was thrown open.
"Er… I guess… I want to know more about you…" I felt my cheeks flush as I peered up at him. "It's just I-I've known you for so long, but… I hardly know anything about you, really. All I knew was who you used to be. And now there's… So much I don't know."
“Oh, we will. I just want to tease you a little before we go…” His knees pushed mine apart as he wedged himself between them. A whimper escaped my lips as I reopened my drooping eyes to see his intrigued observation of my face.
"Wow," he assented. "That's weird. It's like… A blank spot in the sky. Like someone erased a few stars in one place."
A million and one thoughts flew through my mind before I had a moment to process a single one. We were at the back of the class, and our overlapping robes obscured our gripped appendages, but even when there was no chance of anyone seeing, he still clung to me.
In my nightmares, having the Chosen One by my side was a comfort, but here, amidst the scrutiny and judgment of our peers, it was having Harry by my side.
‘It’s not that I really care, I just’ His quill paused as he frowned. His previous message nearly disappeared before he continued again. ‘My love life has always been a major topic of gossip in school, even in the Prophet.’ My eyes scanned his words quickly before they were replaced with the following text: ‘I don’t like everyone knowing my intimate life.’
I wasn't the only one to send my attention backwards to see who was so late, but it was my eyes that Draco's met. I would've instinctively drawn my eyes away, but the blush that stole into his cheeks kept my eyes captivated.
Draco was up and ready and in the Great Hall for breakfast before anyone else was awake, just to avoid interacting. He nearly fell asleep in his plate a few times, but it was worth it to avoid the nightmares, as well. He happened to glimpse a very disheveled Harry Potter arriving earlier than most, but he didn't seem to notice him.
tried - to listen to McGonagall's lecture, but without Hermione by my side, my thoughts wandered. What was Draco thinking? What was he feeling? What were his nightmares about?
The castle was just a dark shape against the sky, but as we looked up, our eyes adjusted and countless stars littered the cosmos.
Draco pulled his other leg up to sit cross-legged, leaning his elbows on his knees as his ears pinked.
"I… I don't want you to think I still hold any feelings for him, you know. It was only an on-and-off fling, we never-"
Harry hissed as I lifted his hips to mine, my fingers gripping where I’d struck him, and a pleased grin spread my cheeks.
"Be better if you'd get your hand off me." He shrugged away the hand I hadn't even realized was still there. I awkwardly withdrew it and sat beside him on the grass. "Something I can do for you?"
"Brilliant." Harry beamed at me, and I was suddenly very interested in finding this appendix he had been reading from.
Draco's cheeks, still flushed from crying, darkened a shade as he dropped his eyes down to his water. His fingers worried his earlobe adorably.
"At the time, it did feel like a slap in the face, but..." I winced. "Your intentions were different than they are now. You were just being nice because you were asked to."
As painful as it was, I eventually withdrew my mouth and clambered back on top of him. His bleary gaze found my face, and confusion stained his features.
I swallowed as I massaged the same spot, wishing I could see Draco's face more clearly. His breathing turned heavy, though, so I assumed I was doing an alright job.
My face pressed deeper into his neck as our chests pressed together. I was completely out of my depth, but still, my arms wriggled beneath him to wrap around his torso. His tickling fingers on my skin turned soothing, stroking up and down my back.
After that, though? He paused unloading his clothes into the dresser. Any possible future he had previously imagined revolved around his father's influence, but now that he was out of the picture… Draco came up empty.
Eventually, though, it was time to go to class. I was so accustomed to arriving early, it was a strange experience to follow the general flow of students to our respective classrooms. Harry fidgeted anxiously all the way to class, even though his hand was twined tightly in mine.
Harry smiled up at me, and I returned it, gently stroking his hair off his forehead. With a sniff and sigh, he pulled back finally.
"Well..." My fingers fidgeted anxiously as I tried to put my feelings into words. "I guess, you probably assumed, but um... We sort of... Kissed..."
passed through my mind as he invited my pointer finger in, as well. My already labored breathing turned ragged as his eyes bored holes into mine. I watched, and
Harry waited patiently for me as I went to my bathroom to splash some cold water on my face. My eyes were still bloodshot, but the redness of my nose was dissipating, thankfully. With a grimace, I gathered my bookbag and laced my fingers through Harry’s. I’d decided to keep my eyes downcast as we walked so no one would see the rawness there. I thought to comment on how he’d somehow reached his Legillimens all the way across campus, but realized I’d have to stop being surprised by his magical aptitude sooner or later.
"I dunno, Harry. Not that I don't trust your judgement, but… I think we're gonna have to see the differences for ourselves, know what I mean?" Seamus scowled over my shoulder when I turned back around, and I sighed.
I tightened my grip on his tie subconsciously, pressing our bodies together. This physical sensation brought me back to my senses, and I suddenly released him.
"It'll be alright," I proposed. Not that I had any way of knowing. I'd heard the whispers last time, after all…
dream, or were we creating the dream together? Because if we only have to deal with my subconscious, it'll still be tricky, but both of ours together?" His words made sense, but the fear in his eyes as he lifted them to mine reaffirmed his meaning. "I can't imagine what
"I know what you mean. It's also sort of neat that we'll be teaching each other what we all are individually learning about, too, but if we were just gonna read the textbook on our own time, what exactly is Sprout's purpose?"
"Oh… Er…" Draco cleared his throat and withdrew his hand, and an alarm sounded in my mind. "You… You might want to extend the range of your, um… Cloaking spell you were using for your back."
Our resulting moans seemed to harmonize. I couldn't begin to describe what he felt like inside me, but it was
That he had eyes only for Harry in the mirror; delighted in tracing his soft spaces to make the muscles jump, giggles exploding from his throat as he tried and failed to twist away from them; it seemed impossible to Harry that that was the look that, as far as he knew, Draco reserved especially for him.
“Fucking Malfoy,” Harry breathed even as he gripped onto both of Malfoy's robed elbows and pulled him into a half-sit, concentrated, gathering his power, and with a
"She's fine. Nutty, worried sick, obviously. She'll be by again to see you after work today." Ron leaned against the wall as he clicked in a text message, throwing scrutinizing looks Harry's way every few seconds. "You've been practising your hugs, haven't you?"
“Harry?” he calls and waits. His fingers curl around the brass doorknob but the room is locked from the outside.
Bill stopped with the cup of tea almost at his lips. He lowered it. "Until nothing. He's a grown man, and he needs to pay for his behaviour. We can't go on coddling him."
A somewhat elaborate mask was the last item laid out on his bed—dark grey satin ribbons attached to each side. Placing it at his face, the ribbons wandered to the back of his head, tying themselves into a flat bow.
"But I can work back up to where I was before," Draco said, pointing to the top of the first hill. "I can keep working at it," he phrased it like a question, one that he was scared to ask. Healer Annan's lips made a grim line before he answered.
Malfoy licked his lips, said, "I told you before, I've done a lot of growing up. Of course I know what Velcro is. Clever, Muggles, aren't they?"
"I'm serious, mate," she waved a hand limply at him, "fuck me, what I wouldn't give to be a fly on that wall."
"He's unconscious. There's nothing to see." Narcissa was going to say more, but Lucius cleared his throat loudly and she turned to him instead.
Harry looked up from his task. Draco took a sip of water and straightened, pulling his foot free and removing the other's pressure from Harry's cock. Which, Harry couldn't help but notice, was hard as a rock now and hypersensitive, stuck between the cotton of his y-fronts and the stickiness of his thigh. There’d been too much talking and not enough doing for its liking.
The word clanged around in Harry's mind as he pulled his fingers free, whispering the spell to conjure oil, thick and slippery in his palm. He coated his own cock, long-neglected and rock-hard. It was going to be impossible, he thought, evident that his prick was far too thick for the tiny space his fingers had prepared.
"Does this he have a name?" she asked. When Harry didn't immediately answer, she added, "You know, I'm not one to judge. I've always had friends who loved who they loved, and as long as people are good to each other, who is anyone to say who that should be?"
"You should expect a thorough print exposé in the coming days about how I steered Pansy away from this violet coloured
She looked up at him, eyes wide with expectation, or hope, maybe, and Harry sighed deeply. It seemed that she knew who he was, and history with Draco notwithstanding, if he wasn't the one that people could come to when someone needed saving, who was he at all?
Harry walked forwards and took his face between his hands and kissed him until the towel rubbing stopped, and he stopped trying to pull away and get in one last word, and the pale, warm hands he'd missed found his waist and loosely held on.
"To which I, thinking that it couldn't possibly be by any means big news, said 'And what's that?' to which you replied—do you want to do this part Hermione, or shall I?"
Fuck. Fuck it all. They knew he was here now, and like blood in the water, his presence would bring more.
. They were doing as they do in the front room. Spin the Bottle with a side of carving initials into walls, et cetera. I was cranky, and it was probably about half-three in the morning, so I cast a little
"Yes," he breathed, "just like that. You were made to wrap those pretty lips around my cock, weren't you?" He pushed at the crown of Harry's skull to force him into a wider stance, the fabric of his trousers catching on the pavement, and Harry hardly noticed how much the bones of his joints twinged because this angle was better, and when Draco's cock pushed into his throat his eyelids flickered shut and his favourite kind of tears—the sort that leaked into his eyelashes when they did this—flowed.
"So you remember you're a wizard when you're outside of the kitchen." Malfoy turned to him, his eyes flicking up and down, taking him all in. "Interesting," he added.
"Brave thing, brave thing you did, in the papers," the man said. Harry swallowed nervously—he would be having versions of this conversation for months to come.
Draco nodded, his blank mask coming up, which Harry responded to with an even wider smile of his own.
"I'm never too tired for you," Harry stepped forwards and let his hands fall on the warm, soft swells of Draco's arse, stepping him backwards until he hissed as his shoulders met the cool tile wall.
Something that Harry could get used to were these little games. Draco asked the questions because he liked to hear the answers. He was already pressing Harry fully onto his stomach, remaining propped above him perched on his elbow. He caught him by the jaw, scratching at a fresh bit of blackened stubble with his thumbnail. They were so close that their breaths were one, the kiss that they both wanted just out of Harry’s reach.
Harry braced himself for a third attempt, muscles throughout his body tense at the expected pressure. Draco didn't push at all this time. He stopped with the cockhead slippery, feeling fat against the entrance to Harry's body. He licked the outer shell of his ear.
There had been the rendezvous at the Harpies game on Tuesday night, with barely enough time to take their flies down and pull each other off, the air muggy under Harry's invisibility cloak while they quietly whispered filth to one another in the back of an unused box. That, and Draco coming over late Friday, practically vibrating with anger over a series of slights by the potions master he apprenticed under.
"You went with him, all this time? Things got hard, and—why him? Why not me? If you've been calling and texting him, you could have sent me a text message, even—"
Healer Abbott’s brows darted up to form lines of surprise clear across the entirety of her forehead.
"Oh yeah?" Draco said, crossing his arms as he leaned against the counter, a smile threatening his lips.
The owl didn't even pause for breath through its eating of the treats but let out a small hoot that Harry interpreted as acquiescence. He rummaged in his pocket for another few sickles for the by-now nearly full payment pouch.
Harry had scoured his list, dejected. "The rest are literal people's names or religious," he said. Draco gave a deep shiver.
"Seems like Ms. Wolcott at the Prophet is better at her job than her years in the business would suggest, because, on top of knowing where you were officially, she got to know where you were
"SMS—just call it texting," Harry grumbled, and Ron snapped his fingers as though he'd been the one to remember.
"Er, Swiss—alright now, hold on," was all the warning Harry gave as he stopped walking and pulled Draco into a hug, resting his cheek on his shoulder and concentrating on the single Apparition point he knew of in Soho.
Harry was too stunned to notice that the line clicked into silence. He didn't think of why not. He'd been told what to do. It was simple.
Harry nodded. Draco was like a witness dying to spill information. Stay silent long enough and it leaked out of them all on its own. “Okay."
Harry couldn't form a thought if he tried. He was all too aware that he was hard himself, thrumming with desire.
Harry gulped at the feeling in his throat, replacing the items in the bag and it was as he was about to slide the diary in as well that a knock came at the door, the familiar mop of red hair with an unfamiliar pair of blue eyes peeking through the space between the door and jamb.
"You’re brilliant, and I want to suck your cock for days and days," he said instead, biting his puffy lower lip and then letting it go. A spark of interest travelled from Harry’s spine to his cock, though that wasn’t enough to generate a new erection. Well. Not quite, but given about ten minutes, Harry was pretty sure it would. "Will that suffice?"
"Why are you here, anyway? You're meant to be at the solstice ball. You're always there." His forehead wrinkled with a frown—he seemed genuinely worried about Harry skipping out on the event. "It's a big deal. Won't the Ministry be peeved to be missing its esteemed guest?"
"Does it feel good to be fucked like this?" Draco ground out the words, his movements coming fast and hard, the previous rolling pace replaced with sharp, wetly punctuated slaps of his hips against Harry's arse.
"I promised to go on this stupid ski holiday this weekend. Ginny and Neville booked it a month ago. I think Luna and Pansy are going, most likely."
"You're too shit at healing charms to fix it yourself, then?" Harry asked after a beat. A dimple appeared in one pale cheek, Draco's eyelashes fluttering as he looked up to Harry for a moment. His look said the
Draco helped him by stomping onto his pants and trousers to push them from his knees to his ankles. His hand found the back of Harry's neck, palm to spine as he pushed him over the edge of the sideboard, stopping only when Harry could see himself reflected in the cabinetry's darkly polished surface. Harry couldn't make out the words whispered behind him but felt the sudden, strange emptiness of a preparatory spell zinging through him, lube just as suddenly in him, a cool, awkward feeling. All the breath left his body in a gust, surprise stealing his breath. It wasn't hot, wasn't going to be pushed into him tenderly with teasing fingers, just there, utilitarian.
"It's my life," Harry whispered. Justin's smile turned simpering like Harry was some childlike idiot in need of explaining.
He bit his bottom lip in concentration as he rucked up Draco's shirt with his left hand, holding it out of the way in the middle of his chest. His eyes fell to the cockhead poking out over his waistband, so incredibly red and wet from precome already against the smooth, creamy expanse of this taut torso.
, and it's like—Merlin, I've never been drunk like this before. Or have I? Is this what blacking out is like? Can I be blacking out if I'm thinking about it?"
"I do, actually. Dragging an old friend out to a party. It might even be pleasant if I could convince him to have fun for half a bloody minute of his miserly life," she grumbled. Harry made a non-commital sound as the possibility of what she might be referring to occurred to him.
"She might seem reticent, but it's a big change for a kid her age. She’s already been re-homed six times since she lost her parents."
"Me?" Harry asked. Malfoy choked on a laugh, huffing between sobs. He didn't bother hiding his crying, couldn't even if he tried.
"No, I don't stock it. Pity for you." Harry cursed—of course, he wouldn't have anything as banal and useful as that.
"Yeah, or alive, then huzzah for you, I say." He drummed his fingers on the table, and Harry could tell that he was watching him, his gaze hot at the back of his neck. "Draco said you had a sick sense of humour. I think I'm going to like you, Potter."
"Delightful, isn't it?" Justin spoke into his ear. He leaned in each time he did it, for show—it wasn't so loud that Harry couldn't hear him, and he didn't need to speak so quietly. They had no secrets, though apparently, he had reason to make other people believe that they did. Harry watched his icy-blue eyes dart down to his mouth. The want in his face was obvious.
"Granger doesn't work on that floor, don't give me this," he dropped the menu on the table, fixing Harry with a stare. "Is it that you're desperate to get involved in business that isn't your own because you're obsessed with being the saviour of everything?"
He stopped as Draco slid his hand, now freed of the glove, back around to swirl at the base of Harry’s neck.
Harry felt so much more exposed without the haze of alcohol, like the fire in his belly was visible. But the desire hadn't changed at all.
"Has to stop eventually. Yeah, I know." He turned onto his side, signalling an end to the conversation.
, was after one more button popped, was after a taste of those lips, was after whatever he could get his fumbling, sweating hands on, and he was so completely
"Are you planning on coming back?" Ron asked. Hermione put down her glass of wine and waited, just as interested in his answer as Ron was.
pudding," he said, absently, eyelids fluttering shut. "I haven't had proper afters since I was fifteen, and I'm
They hadn't spoken a word since they'd entered the flat. A trail of clothes dotted their path; a shoe kicked off behind the front door, its twin on the stair. They'd entered the bedroom shirtless, and Draco's hands worked quickly to divest Harry of what remained of his clothes. He gasped as the cold metal of Draco's wristwatch pressed into the skin low on his stomach, as his hand slid past his trousers and underwear both to cup his swollen cock.
Harry couldn’t look at him, or he knew his face would give away how hurt these theoreticals made him. He didn't like Draco like this. He was still uncommonly capable of cruelty, where Harry was concerned.
"Even so. I threaten him. He's lashing out. It's not new, and I'm not hurt, or upset. I'd like to find a way to talk to him one on one when he's ready.” He pursed his lips on a sigh and ran a hand through his hair. He was just as tired as any of them. “One day."
," Draco let out, gravelly and low, banging his head again against the partition. Harry distantly heard the door to the bathroom bang shut; he hadn't noticed it opening, didn't give a shit if someone had seen two pairs of shoes in a stall where one belonged. One of Draco's hands now held him by the small of his back, palm flat against the sweaty dip. The other gripped at his own thigh, long fingers tense. He hooked a leg around Harry's calf and held him closer that way, and though Harry hadn't been adequately touched, he was so close. When Draco's stomach caved in, his gloved hands gripping hard, pulling Harry closer, it was a touch too much.
"Oh, no." Harry barely mustered the breath to speak the words. He turned to Draco and could see it—the spark of a smile, almost, almost dimpling his cheek. He turned back to the spluttering Noah and screwed up his face with as much mock concern as he could manage.
Malfoy leaned forward, his eyes flickering quickly between Harry's, searching for something. Harry's mouth went dry.
"Euphoria's hard to come by organically," she said, passing him the cap. "Get the right synapses firing through a potion or chemistry, and you can manufacture a feeling. Some people don't get the drop after, but you seem to be more sensitive than most." Harry snarled at the implication that he was anything close to sensitive. He may have feelings, but admitting to them was a step too far.
"What a disappointment you are, Narcissa. I'm ashamed that this is who you've become." Harry sat straight in his chair and took a deep steadying breath. "You know, you're the reason I vouched for him at the trials. And look where you've ended up now."
The pit swole into something so big Harry was sure that soon he wouldn't be able to breathe around it. He pushed up and out of bed, vaguely registering Draco's confused questions of where he was going.
"Twist it in, all the way," Harry directed, the need to fuck Cissy open building in him like anxiety, agitation skyrocketing. He tugged at his cock twice experimentally and stopped, the feeling radiating outwards like a shimmer in his veins.
Harry expected his face to crumple, but he went blank instead. Meaning he went inside, someplace and tried to shut Harry out.
Friday nights turn into a standing booking of Room 314, turn into Harry renting a flat for the purpose.
He raised an eyebrow and sipped his beer as Harry gave a tight nod. No use pretending otherwise. Noah, for one, didn't seem perturbed. Not even that—he seemed pleased at the response.
"I've done nothing of the sort," she retorted. "Lucius is the keeper of the family name, and as the patriarch, it's up to him—"
Harry rubbed his hands together, palms rough against one another, and wondered what would happen if he could get Draco to take his hand. He wasn't wearing gloves at all, and Harry wanted to point it out, felt like it was a bright, wonderful thing that he didn't feel the need to follow Lucius' inane rules while among Muggles, but he swallowed the thought. It was a spectacular feeling, though, a brilliant, pure one.
Draco picked his way back to their shared loveseat, moving a pillow aside to curl up next to Harry. He toed off his house slippers and pulled his long legs up to his chest, turning to face him.
Harry shook his head, pressed his lips together. He couldn't hear this. It was easier to be hurt than to talk about this. About anything.
"But how do you know it?" Harry asked. He took a sip of his drink and had to keep from groaning with how good it felt. He put it down before the urge to give it a nervous gulp took him and fixed to listen instead. The determination was there to pace himself and keep to his word, to try his absolute best to make a nice night of it.
"Marvellous costume, Potter. Are you a crow?" McGonagall asked as she escorted him away from the head table. He had the uncanny feeling, as though the record he'd been listening to had skipped a song—she'd only just been giving her speech, and now it was over, and they were walking and talking. He could only gulp and smile, pretend that nothing was amiss, and pray that he hadn't done anything strange in the interim.
Harry releases the stem of his glass of red and internally curses whatever God thinks his life so interesting. Of all the men working the club, the one to approach Harry first just had to be him.
, so that Draco could go back to kissing him that way, kiss them raw. So that he could unspool all those thoughts that Harry could tell were flickering through his mind.
"I didn't know what my place was in it. What it could be. I had silly dreams, really. Of getting out, and at the same time, keeping them happy."
and Draco nodded. He tightened the hand in his hair until it pulled at his scalp and pushed him down, pulled him up deliberately, and down again, lower still, until he was held at the base, cockhead nudging for entry into Harry's throat.
"The belt you got as a sixteenth birthday present from Pansy, I know that story. The year you ate so little it literally stunted your growth."
Draco opened his mouth as though to say something and then closed it. Before Harry could ask what was on his mind or say something dreadfully trite, like
"I'm not—you don't—" Harry licked his lips, scared at what was happening. It had all been too fast, so good even when it wasn't good at all. He was a mess around Draco, why couldn't he think properly?
He'd been photographed at the portkey terminal upon landing and had made the incorrect presumption that this meant that there wouldn't be more reporters out front of the house too. The pictures of him, two-days worth of stubble, bright green eyes flashing dangerously as he contained his annoyance behind a serious, stony face would run in the papers the following morning would attest to that.
“Try again,” Draco commands, and Draco holds his breath to watch Harry push and push, and manage to take it all, finally.
Harry huffed a laugh, ended the spell that held his spoon aloft and turned to his godson, whose locks were black with white shot through, like Andromeda's hair, and wiped a sticky granule of rice from his cheek.
"Here," Harry handed him the snitch, watched his eyes, one blue, like Andromeda’s, and the other a grey, a dead ringer for one of Draco's, go wide, and mouth slack with wonder. It was odd, how Harry felt suddenly like he was getting a look at a child that could
Harry smiled too, the tightness in his lungs loosening. "I, I—I was a bit anxious about, well—this, I suppose. Seeing you."
Ron rolled over from his stomach onto his side and frowned at him. "Who—George? What's he done now?"
Draco was babying him, which was, in its own way, admitting to what had happened. Harry desperately wanted to ask how to play his part correctly, but Draco had abandoned the paper to the ground and started in on the stack of mail on his lap, and a look of deep concentration pinched his face. A bit of marmalade was smeared on his cheek, and Harry didn't think before he picked up a napkin from the tray floating before them and dotted him clean.
." Draco looked up at long last, and Harry noticed the line of pink running right across his nose and cheeks. He'd been out in the sun too long—unless he was purposely going for a slightly burnt look with the help of cosmetics and charms. Harry didn't care which; it looked endearing, either way. "Ring any bells?”
"Er—" Harry stumbled over the correct answer to the question, even as Luna tugged at his hand, her pleas for him to come
"Listen," Harry started, and when Draco wouldn't snap out of it, he moved into his line of sight, forcing him to pay attention. "Draco? Are you listening?"
"You never listen!" Draco growled a yell, pushed the meat of his palms into his eyes. "Because you know what else you've done now? Now I can't go about the legal route of contesting my dismissal." When he pulled his hands away, his eyes were leaking again, wetting the white tracks where the salt from his first outburst had only just dried. "I can't talk to the union, I can't seek a settlement that's above board. And if you and I are together, you can be sure that someone is going to dig into my work history, and then what? Then what?"
Ron stands sharply, yanking Hermione off of the sofa, and leaving the burgundy room. The door slamming in his absence.
He knew Malfoy had a bit of a reputation for sleeping around Hogwarts, the only time he had ever been in a committed relationship was with Pansy Parkinson and every time he saw them together the girl had her tongue down Malfoys throat. Even before that, there was a new girl on Malfoys waist every week. He was a complete slag, and knew the room of requirement all too well.
Draco was at the window, it was wide open and he was leaning out of it, a cigarette hanging out his mouth. He could hear the door open behind him, he didn’t turn around, he knew it was only Potter and he’d probably just crawl into bed like usual. He felt a tap on his leg, Potter was sitting down on the windowsill. Draco handed over his metal cigarette case but Potter didn’t take it, he looked over at the boy; he was white as a sheet and something was running around in his mind.
“Potter” He nodded shortly, shoving past him and walking out of the kitchen. Leaving Potter to do the morning oil checks.
Harry had spent his entire life hating Malfoy, he blamed every little problem on him; convinced that the pretentious git was always up to something. When Malfoy switched sides, Harry had just assumed that it was his own choice. That had clearly been proven wrong when the boy threw his wand to him in the final battle.
Draco let the pan he was hovering over simmer on the heat, looking out of the kitchen door. Harry was sitting at the till, a pen wedged in between his lips, a look of concentration etched on his face. Draco's stomach flipped.
Harry was sweltering, he knew as soon as he agreed to speak at the graduation it was a really bad idea. He was an alright public speaker, but speaking about his life in front of his entire class made him want to vomit all over the floor. He ran over his speech for the hundredth time, he could see Ron doing the same out of the corner of eye. The door clicked open, Professor McGonagall was standing in the doorway. “It's time boys.”
He clipped his gloves on as he watched a mother pushing a pram pass by the windows. It gave Harry enough time to blink in wonder at the person before him. He looked like Draco Malfoy, Harry thought. He walked and talked just like him. But this person seemed in some ways a million miles away from Draco Malfoy, Boyhood Nemesis. In some ways, Harry felt like he might be meeting this Draco Malfoy for the first time.
"You were on a similar train of thought last night," Malfoy responded, an eyebrow rising, his look decidedly unimpressed. "If you've forgotten all the greatest hits, let me summarize for you: I'm gay. Very gay. As in, I do on occasion leave my home to find a likely-looking man, and once I've found him, the two of us, or sometimes more, enjoy taking off our cl—"
"I would have gotten you a glass if you'd asked," he said acidly. "I expect you to replace that pillow."
His back arched naturally to feel the finger press in, but he didn't beg for more. His sounds were as small as Draco's movements, which were almost lazy in their slow execution.
"What if I told you that even before I knew what we know now, I hid your response to the realtor from going out with the post on Friday because I wanted you to have a few days to back out?"
He knew he looked good, technically; knew that the thickened swells of his biceps drove Draco wild and that the sinewy muscle of his torso, the tense spread of his shoulders and thighs, and his calves carved from hours upon hours spent sprinting over London's uneven pavement and cobblestones, he knew that they turned Draco on. That Harry had never felt handsome or particularly fit didn't matter, not to Draco, and especially not right now. That he avoided mirrors as a rule, still didn't like to touch at his own waxy scars, couldn't bring himself to order and use the creams that would lessen their tightness because that would mean acknowledging that he wished for them to go away—those were troubles for another day.
," she gestured at Harry, "whatever it is he's doing with you, this is the sort of behaviour that makes him sick. He can abuse drugs or not—it's a choice he makes. If he wants to carry on with follies about living for sin
into being, the thin light surrounding them increasing so that he could better make out what it looked like as Draco’s prick slipped through the bronzed circle of his open fist. Harry couldn't drag his eyes from his work, and it didn't matter because Draco wasn't looking at Harry at all—his eyes were closed, eyelids flickering, head tipped back so that his hair tangled, obscuring lewd comments and phone numbers scrawled in haste. Harry played with the same handful of inches by the base for a while, and when he finally finished a stroke to the end, Draco banged the back of his head and shuffled his feet out to widen his stance and give Harry a better angle.
"Pity," Draco said under his breath, peering closely at a photo of Harry backstage on his graduation day. "There's about a thousand tucked into photo books at the manor, to complement the hundred or so mum had framed."
Ginny, Neville and George were the first to depart from the table to digest in relative peace around the house when rapping on a window came from another room, the clicking of an insistent owl.
Harry scoffed. "What am I supposed to do without them?" No answer came. "I need to see regularly, Draco," he added, trying to sound as annoyed as he should be at the imposition.
Up in his room, which was really his and Ron's room, but he and Hermione had been upgraded to a bedroom all their own, Harry found a small mailer with his day's assorted mail, alongside a tin wrapped in shimmering blue foil paper. Ripping the envelope of the mailer open with his thumb, he was just unfurling the scroll of parchment it contained when a knock came at the door.
The ribbiting of frogs in the marshy muck of the pond beyond alerts him to the fact that they’re there, in the grass that he’s trodding barefoot over, certainly. He wonders what the throat of a frog feels like. How it must vibrate if you were to catch one and hold it captive in your palm. Wonders how it would squirm, captured alive in the cave of your stomach.
They didn't say anything for a long while as Draco focused his attention on the man below him rather than the one in the mirror. As he knelt, held Harry's legs together, gliding his cock so it passed slowly over his hole each time before sliding through his thighs, rubbing his bollocks on the other side.
He ignored it, and within a minute, the buzzing died down, acid-green flames fading back to a gentle orange.
Harry woke with a gasp to rip sweat-soaked sheets from his legs. The thin cotton gown he wore was mint green around the hems but dark where it stuck wetly to his body.
On one hand, it was his chance at a family, one they could build and grow into together. It introduced a possibility he'd basically written off. Adoption was something to dream about, years and years into the future. It had only just become legal to adopt in a same-sex couple or as a single person in England, and that was for Muggles. The case for the same would go to the Wizengamot in the fall, and it wasn't a clear-cut win. Only as a godparent did he have a clear, legal precedent to apply for conservatorship of a child.
"Hey," Harry asked, "what's your schedule like this week?" Draco snorted at the question, looked around the room as though to say
"Must have been popular, you," George cut back in. "Did they know what your family did to their kind during the war?"
"It's not that, it's—" Harry shook his head, "it just made me think of Draco. Malfoy. Draco Malfoy."
"Pet, you're killing me," he said, but Harry was determined to draw the moment out. He soaped with his right hand and scrubbed with his left, flannel in hand. He took extra care with Draco's feet, getting in-between his toes, and all the way back up his other leg until he had nowhere left to explore but the crevice where Draco's thighs met with his arse cheeks, and when Harry dragged the flannel along those lines, Draco's groan was throaty and exasperated.
Draco takes two steps back and settles on the floor, his back bolstered against the settee. Once comfortable, he unzips his trousers.
The pressure of him around your cock is impossible, and he takes it in silence. Holds his left hand in the meat of his right on your ribcage, not even a gasp. Where his hips dip and then flare into the curves of his arse, you pull him down while your hips thrust up, and try as you might, he doesn't cry out.
Harry didn't bother to try to flounder for reasons. "Yeah. I wanted to ask about it earlier, but it hadn't come up. You're so good with kids, and with him, I thought—"
Pain flowed from his palm down the damaged wrist. It was due to vibrations emanating from his phone.
Negotiations tire Harry. He allows the one-hour rule to stand for two weeks before he finds a way to sweeten the deal for himself.
, Potter," Draco huffed, truly annoyed. He got a little line between his brows when something really vexed him, and there it sat between them now. "Five is when I'm lacing up to head out."
They were silent as the healer pulled a violet-coloured pamphlet from his pocket and handed it to Draco. He leaned against the table behind him as Draco looked at it, though his eyes weren't moving.
"What about me? Mordred adores me, she signed off on it in an instant. Everyone in academia fucks off for the summer—that's when the real interns get left behind to stir the cauldrons."
"I was, but we finished early—Harrods is having a sale and she tires of being around bargain hunters too long," he answered melodramatically as he helped himself to a triangle of jammy toast from Harry's plate. "So, I thought to myself, hmm, what's there to do on a glorious day like today, that rhymes with squidditch?"
Harry slapped a hand over his mouth as soon as the words were out, but that couldn't contain his laughter.
"I'm sneaking twice the fat I normally would into meals, and keeping treats in the house. It's slow work to get his appetite back up, and with all his running—"
"They're tea roses," Draco interrupted him. He looked up, lit by the blue-white light of the dying day, awe in his eyes.
"Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll keep my bit short because nobody wants to hear me drone on."
Draco stopped as he ascended the stairs from the kitchen. He stood still and stared at them as he caught his breath from the brief trip.
"Here I am, ill, baring my soul to you. And you, no better to me than a stranger or perhaps, I am beginning to think, an unhinged stalker—"
"What are you, like, allergic to fun?" Malfoy tucked a lock of errant hair behind his ear, and Harry's eyes followed the movement. His hair looked so soft, wispy. Harry wondered what it felt like to touch.
Draco pulled a pillow into his lap, resting his nervous hands upon it. "I was taking dance more seriously back then, trying out for gigs and photoshoots, and needed to put on muscle for
Harry looked to it, imagined the fit in which Draco had chucked the device, how he probably hadn't been aiming for the window. How everything was back in order now, the pane replaced, smooth again. A dark mirror that held them both in the darkness of another bleak night in the city.
"He says the naughtiest things in the poshest voice," he blurted. "And he's kinky, and he's also very—he's very kind."
"I told Harris that if anything came up to send an owl and I would come into the Ministry. I'm still accepting Ministry owls. What couldn't wait—"
"Hmmm," Ron made a displeased noise, scratching at the stubble pushing in at his jaw. Hermione turned and very obviously peered over her shoulder at the Slytherins.
"Sure, yeah," Harry picked lint from the hair on his forearm, a useless gesture, and forced a little smile. "I'm sure this is just a side effect of whatever was knocking around in my system. I'll be fine now."
, implying that there was nothing beyond the flirting and things said between gasping breaths than a mutual desire to get off.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. His stomach was sour, and he wanted Draco to go just as much as he wanted him to stay, but a different version of Draco—one that was kinder and more pliable, less bloody difficult all the time.
Harry was proud that his traitorous tongue hadn’t let loose his secret so far but couldn’t trust himself much further. A change of topic was called for.
"I'm not forcing my boyfriend to take an Unbreakable Vow that he'll never speak ill of me in the press, for the rest of time," Harry had scoffed at the first page, assuming it to be a joke. Victoria swallowed, a solemn look on her face.
"I'm sorry," Harry croaked at long last. They had all decamped to the living room, Hermione and Harry taking up acres of real estate on the worn, too-squishy couch, Ron nursing a whisky four-fingers deep from his favourite orange chintz chair.
Robards sniffed, scrubbed a hand over his face. He was clearly tired—Dean hadn't been kidding when he'd said they'd been at it all day, then. "Leftover bad blood from the war and a waste of time and Galleons. I won't be attending the sentencing, that's for certain." He looked somewhere over behind Harry and nodded.
Harry hadn't relaxed at all when he nodded and whispered, "Yeah, okay, more," and Draco thrust just a bit and then stilled, a frown on his face when he looked into Harry's.
inherent to the look that Draco wouldn't be any help at all in extricating him from the conversation.
"No, Vic. I've made my decision, and I won't be moved." The white leather of the chaise on which he lounged was buttery soft, the arms so thickly cushioned that he didn't even need a pillow to rest his neck comfortably on one of them. He turned to face his press relations agent and found her mirroring his position on the couch opposite—head leaned back, a gold-tipped cigarette of pink paper clutched between her fingers, feet up with one high heel still dangling from her stockinged toes.
"I've got to be going, and I'm sorry that I don't think before I do things. I'm an idiot, and I've got to work on it. I've got to work on a lot, to be honest, but I'll try, very hard, to be more careful in the future. If you—If we. If I see you again."
Strangely, this time saying that word left a bitter taste in his mouth. Being different wasn’t always good as the Beaumont family had led him to believe.
Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.
“Ma’am your daughter is safe. She is sitting right here,” Clint guided a hysterically looking woman towards the red haired girl sitting next to him. She was surprisingly the calmest of all the other four, barely saying anything or crying. She was just playing with her necklace and starring at her hands, ignoring everything that was going on around them. As soon as she heard her mother’s voice, her eyes snapped up and a frown colored her otherwise expressionless face. Interesting.
“umm…” Harry was unsure what to say. The board did not particularly look bad, but he was confident he could make it look a lot better with just a bit of magic.
and that their class schedules will be handed to them during breakfast and that the much anticipated Quidditch trials will be held during the second week, along with flying lessons for the first years.
“Okay sweetie,” she gave him a sympathetic smile. If only she knew how much worse Harry was being treated by the Dursleys; but for reasons still unknown to him, Harry just couldn’t bring himself to tell her. It made him feel weak, feel ashamed, and if anyone was going to save or help Harry it was himself! He had recently been introduced to the idea of ‘Skinner’s Box’ or as most called it ‘Operant Conditioning’. Harry had tried to apply the conditions of the study on the Dursleys, but unfortunately it did not have the desired effects he had in mind. The only thing it achieved was making the Dursleys more suspicious of him and not even letting him out of his cupboard for his birthday. Even though he was met with failure, he was on the right path now, or so he liked to think. After all, he could figure out a way to use his magic into helping him condition the Dursleys into getting what he wanted and ultimately move into Dudleys second room. And if he ever gets that far…
year students were separated from the rest and sent towards the lake where a giant man was awaiting them. The giant man introduced himself as Hagrid and helped the students get on the boats, when he got to Harry, the sight of his lightning scar as it had done since his first encounter with other magical creatures stopped him in his tracks.
HEY GUYS! So sorry for updating late, life has been a little bit more hectic than usual! I feel like this is a gateway chapter to harry actually starting to come to his own, so the next 2 chapters will explore the next four years of Harry’s life, so the chapter will be longer! Personally I just want to get Harry into Hogwarts ;)
Snape's last warning before disappearing behind the flare of his dramatic robes was to never bring anyone from another house into their common room or tell them their password. No outsider has entered their common room for more than seven centuries.
“Well, Hogwarts students are required to own three sets of standard black robes as part of their uniform when they attend classes, eat meals… like any other Academy.  Then, of course, you will need a formal robe… or three” she threw a playful wink at Sabrina's direction, which she did not seem to appreciate. “All schools pretty much operate the same, se relaxer [chill].” Harry had been wound up a bit more than usual the past two weeks, counting the days until he has to leave for Hogwarts seemed to be making him more and more anxious and nothing seemed to help with
“SSSAAABRRRINNAA!!” Benoît’s cries were getting more frantic as any of his attempts to remove the glue
“Don’t forget we're meeting with Maman at Twilfitt and Tattings before sunset, she insisted to be there when Harry was trying on his robes!”
“Fine, fine…” “GET YOUR BUTT IN THE HOUSE FREAK!” Vernon and Dudley started at the same time. No doubt dear old Dudders was enjoying this immensely.
“I um…. There was no one injured in the fire, just a couple of scratches and bruises, one or two broken arms maybe. Here let’s get up and I’ll help you find them.” He was now using that fake, cheerful voice that adults seemed to think kids liked and it was not helping his headache. Ugh, he just wanted to go back to his cupboard and sleep.
Mrs. Art had been most happy to help Harry prank his cousin and to make sure there was no evidence to lead back to him. She never liked the way Dudley treated him, but she had drawn the line that no prank should physically or
"Just put the bloody coat on so we can go. It's a Muggle club. No one will recognize you anyway—I can guarantee it. Now hurry up before I decide to leave without you and dance up on some miserable, miserly old man who hates fun, who would make an entirely acceptable replacement for you."
"We shouldn't have come," Harry said. He reached across the table to cup Draco's hand with his own. He could practically feel a hundred eyes follow the movement. "We can go. It's almost over, anyway. We can just get up and leave, and we'll be home in a minute."
Hilarious, to consider it. Him possessing Draco. And yet, what other face did jealousy most often wear?
"Mm, uh yeah. Sure," Harry agreed, a little surprised. It wasn't warm, though Draco was, a sheen of sweat visible on his brow and cheekbones. Harry followed him up and outside, through to the back garden. A fog had settled in that felt permanent, wrapping the space in soft light. The garden was little more than soaked grass and gravel, cracked grey basalt tiles leading to wild, thorny hedges that Harry promised each year to find a way to tame. Draco lit a cigarette and continued pacing as Harry took to one of the two benches, glad to find it dry, though the stone was so cold that a shiver rippled through him to sit at it.
"It's stupid, but I can't help it." Harry realized that he'd been staring, fork halfway to his mouth, and he hastily ate a bite, cheeks burning.
The next week was worse, evidenced by Draco's reading of the articles ever earlier in the day, while his wry commentary became ever sparser. They maintained their routines and didn't talk about anything more than what channel to flip to next, and what was on for dinner. Harry became more certain every day that the closeness he'd felt growing between them was waning, and he didn't know what to do to unstick his tongue. He needed for Draco to come clean to him, and yet he couldn't bring himself to ask the question. So, he woke, worked, and slept. Smiled when he was supposed to, and the sour, worried feeling grew like corrupt fruit inside him.
"Okay, yes, I was drugged, and no, I didn't go to hospital; don't get me started on how it would have been leaked. We're pretty sure that it was a Muggle drug, ecstasy, but I'm honestly fine, that's not even the weirdest bit—"
"Teddy," Andromeda admonished, a furrow gathering her brow. Draco shook his head at her, quietly saying, "No, it's fine, really."
"No, it's, um," Harry placed his napkin on the table and took his head in his hands, which had begun throbbing with an unknown pressure. "It's, uh. Something terrible's happened."
again, just to say it because he felt it so strongly, but Draco hadn't said it back, and Harry didn't want to push, didn't even need him to say it because he was sure that he felt it. Whatever it was that he felt when Draco held him, that had to be what love felt like, didn't it? So instead, when Draco murmured, "Goodnight," in his ear, and rolled away to pull a vial of Dreamless Sleep for them to share, Harry returned with "Sweet dreams," and drank his half, sinking into the bed as content as he was sure he'd ever been.
"My cock—enough—for you?" Draco punctuated his words with thrusts, and Harry keened something like a response. His breaths came faster, shallower. Full, restrained, prick so hard that to be touched now would likely be painful. He was close, still, just from Draco's tongue at his entrance and his cock, long and thick, owning Harry from the inside out. He
And Harry would mirror him and say the same. "So." His pulse started racing at this point. He'd watch Draco lick a drop of moisture from his lips, watch while he pointedly wouldn't look at him, surveying their surroundings.
He should be home, he should be alone, he should be able to block this out. There wasn't a cellar here, but there was a pantry, half-empty, and there he went, and all the lights that typically flickered on when they entered the rooms stayed black because that's what he needed. His fingers trailed the wall, and he found the corner and sat, limbs pulled in tightly, and for some reason, Draco followed him, and it was Draco that would be his undoing. Draco, barely visible in the blackness, a throw in one hand because it was cold in the pantry, and Harry was naked, and Draco wanted him to be comfortable because he didn't understand that the discomfort was what Harry needed, understood—deserved.
Draco physically recoiled. He drew his hands out from Harry's and turned away from him, covering his face with his hands.
Draco pulled Harry free at last. Harry gasped for breath, weaving on his knees. “Show me how much you like this,” Draco said, “let me see you now; I want you to touch yourself.”
Harry was spiralling, he knew it, but as he looked around the room at his chosen family, he wondered for the first time how was it was
“I’m not asking you to sell the flat,” Harry said gently. “You could let it. You know—a nice couple of students at uni or something.”
“I’ll take him.” Harry glanced at McGonagall, then back at Malfoy. He was dangerously pale, like he’d been watered down. Flat pink wheals had crawled up the skin of his throat right before their eyes. Harry wondered if he’d die by the time they reached his mouth.
“Noted," the witch replied, her voice onerous, nearly bored. "While we're talking looks, Harry, what’s your type? Blink once for blonds."
"I'd be delighted to sit next to you, Teddy," he accepted with a smile. "We'll be right behind you. Find your Gran so you can wash that soot from your hands before you sit down."
Harry let the spell dissipate, the windows reverting back to their small rectangular shapes set high, unattainable to the children's little hands below them.
"I think that about sorts it for rules," Draco said, smoothing the fabric of his shirt down over his stomach.
He awoke with a start to the face of Healer Xu, and commotion nearby. Burgundy robes and shiny black boots. Aurors leaving the ward.
He took Malfoy’s ankle in his right hand, the heel of his boot with his left. Harry slipped his socked foot free, placing it on the ground.
And yet. The chance was here, now, offered to him at a time when he was stable, and good fortune kept raining down on him, but it came with a price that was too much to bear. He didn't want a good thing to happen if it meant losing Andromeda. If it meant that Teddy lost the guardian he'd been raised by. It felt biblically, cosmically wrong for it to happen like this.
. But right then, he wanted to pull Draco up and spill everything. The dreams—nightmares, really. The feeling he got when he thought about having sex with him and how it felt like maybe it meant something to him too, the way his face went soft when they were done. Harry wanted to replay all the moments he'd shut his mouth and say,
. Dark wizards and witches abounded, and the neo-Death Eater movement was gaining ground in all the important ways. It couldn’t have been easy to be a beacon of light when the world around grew ever dimmer.
It was a testament to how much time they'd spent together that Draco didn't scoff or make a joke. He lay in silence, thinking loudly as he stared up at the ceiling. Eventually, he tilted to face Harry, one hand landing warmly at his waist.
he wondered, knowing that he was owed so much more than a simple apology. He hated seeing Draco like this—a wreck, threadbare, his very seams visible. Harry wanted to close the gap and cling to him until the trembling stopped, wanted to feel held, too but he staid fast, feet anchored to the ground as though rooted there. He could remember Draco, so many months ago, sitting on the counter, red lips twisted with worry for him.
Partners at work was public knowledge; partners at home a secret. Publicly, Harry still pulled. Seemingly at random, the people he brought back to Grimmauld thought they were getting a peek behind the curtain. Really, what they got was a backdrop. A
"Let me take your jacket," Harry said, not surprised in the least by Draco's silence. By the heavy cadence of the footfalls behind him and knew that Mrs Weasley had rejoined her husband in the narrow space. A hush seemed to fall where moments ago the sounds of a packed house could be heard from every direction.
Harry's face contorted at the thought. "It's working only too well, actually. I'd forgotten that I had it on."
that's not the part I'm concerned about." Ron mashed his lips together into a line, poked a finger into a hole in the coverlet, then pulled it back out. "Don't go sacrificing yourself for someone who isn't looking to be saved, alright?"
Most of the table clued into the conversation, many sets of eyes suddenly fixed on Draco and Andromeda. Draco's ears went pink under the steady observation.
Some things, they spoke about openly. Harry learned of Theo Nott as a person, a person with an incredibly handsome older brother, a person whom Draco had been very close to before school but fell out with over a snubbed birthday party invitation at age eight. He discovered a secret history of how Crabbe and Goyle had both been around for "the ballet incident," as it was known between them, and had breezed over the fact that Draco was gay, telling him it didn't matter to them so long as they could all keep trading Chocolate Frog cards. His voice broke when he recalled the Fiendfyre that had taken his friend's life, how he felt the burden of how his cruelty to them had been met with understanding because of their own cruel upbringings. Harry struggled to keep his mouth shut but came to hear tales that turned his stomach about the things most Death Eater parents put their own children through, things he'd never contemplated as requirements for the creation of such hideous bullies as they had eventually become.
Something snakes its way into the neck of his t-shirt and he yelps, banging his head on the ceiling after all. It doesn’t move to find him again, but swings, beaded metal barely visible in the gloom.
"You have to go around looking like you do, don't you? Take these stupid things off," Draco removed Harry's glasses from his face and floated them away with a careless gesture. Up close, Harry could see how quickly he'd been debauched—lips full, colour high on his cheeks and throat, wisps of bone-white hair falling into his face.
"Those who find the need to talk about sex the most are often the people having the least of it," Draco growled at no one in particular. His wand landed nearly back at him, but not quite.
"Yeah, of course," Harry lied. He was getting better at this—lying to Draco. He didn't like it at all.
"Don't talk about Hermione," Harry said sharply. He didn't like where this line of conversation was leading, "You're deflecting."
When Draco alighted on the staircase two floors down, he heard it. Each step he took closer, measured and steady, was picked up by Harry's ears. It was an anticipation that made his blood rush, faster, faster, faster.
Long minutes passed like that until Draco's arm tensed and he shifted, pressing his body insistently into Harry's. It was like the quality of the air changed, or his magic perked up upon noticing a shift in Draco's, but something made goosebumps ripple across his body and charged the puffs of air on his neck so that the hair there stood on end.
"Yeah—I can see it now," Harry held his mug with his knees so he could gesture to an imagined marquee, "
"I could," Harry breathed, and Draco pulled back a little and pressed hard inside, the slide rough and delicious. They both moaned and Harry dipped his head to the mattress to take a deep breath before Draco did it again. He used his elbows to find leverage, fingers pressed against the cool glass of the mirror as Draco fucked him properly, short, strong thrusts punctuated by Harry’s sounds.
“Come on,” Draco's voice was so soft yet pleading. He sucked in his bottom lip and let it go, watching Harry’s eyes flick to his mouth. “Where’s all that famous Gryffindor courage gone?”
"I can go back to work, though," Draco's mouth was smiling incredulously even as his brow wrinkled with confusion. "Surely, I can do that? I'm reading again, I've been working on proofs—"
It was something of a blur for Harry. Draco shed his pants, his fingers finding Harry mouth with the command to "Suck," and so he did, sloppily. One wet finger was soon playing at his hole, as he gripped at his ankles, pulling callused heels in until they touched his arsecheeks. Draco’s finger dipped inside as he kneeled and fed Harry his cock, which Harry was only too glad to suckle at, and then to take greedily, almost but not quite into his throat.
Draco said this as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. He winced as he pulled a few hairs from his scalp, holding on to them as he undid the top buttons to his shirt. Harry swallowed as inches of skin were revealed, the sharp points of his collarbones meeting across a deep dip, the size of his thumb.
"More," Draco breathed, "please more." Harry was slow to add another finger, caught in the thrall of how hot and tight Draco felt around him. Watching as his eyelids fluttered, nearly opening but not quite. Feeling the sounds he made as vibrations against his lips, kissing him gently. Feeling inside of him, pliant and eager.
"Mione," he stalled. "We're friendly, I've seen him out a few times, and he's a decent bloke, these days honestly and..." he started, but the look on her face told him that there was no point in trying to hide it now.
Malfoy's expression became pinched, little wrinkles lining his nose. "I don't expect pity from you, Potter. But yes, it was."
"I've been available all along, and you ignored every one of my attempts to talk to you. That note was a
That was until Draco leaned in the last few inches and ground his erection into Harry's hip, sighing as he did it. The press of his heated body promised sensual pleasure Harry hadn't yet known; the slight roll of his hips enough to scrape the last bit of sense from his mind. The breathiness of the sound Draco made drew a dribble of pre-come from Harry, leaking directly into the already damp cotton of his pants.
"Haz, you know I love you. And Hermione, she loves you. So for the love of god, just give it half a go, and then you can say you tried, and it'll buy you a month or two before she tries again. It was Hermione's idea anyway, and I think
"You’ve got me," Harry said, and Draco made an undignified snorting sound, more tears leaking. "You’ve got an aunt too, Andromeda. And Teddy, he’s your, um—"
Victoria scoffed. "Sorry, but nobody cares about your early childhood, darling. Year one had an extraordinary blip, and then not much happened till you were eleven."
When he returned, Malfoy’s trousers and shirt were a wrinkled lump at the foot of his bed. He lay facing the middle of the room, one pale calf visible with the blanket hooked between his legs. The skin of his cheek went pink and then bone-white in a ring around where his palm pressed hard into one closed eye.
"Couldn't visit then either. Though that was his parents doing." She cocked her head, finally turning kohl-rimmed eyes in Harry's direction. They weren't red—Pansy would save her crying for private, after all.
"Well, that can't be right," he said, amused. RUSH was capitalized, but after reading that and the heading, he put the bill aside to review later. The most his solicitor could have managed was to have looked into Malfoy's case, asked someone to collect evidence. It was clearly an error and nothing to worry about.
"Yeah," Harry sighed, pushing his glasses up from where'd they fallen near the tip of his nose. He needed a new pair—if only there was enough time in the day.
"Shut up," Draco’s face crumpled like a sheet of paper balled up and ready to be binned, and Harry was astonished to see him so openly hurt.
"I'm busy doing what I can, which is mostly baking or fussing in the garden. This one's rubbed off on me—I'm living the life of a snow-bird, only without all the exotic travel. Being honest, though, retirement doesn't suit me."
He holds still as stone when you press one finger in, wet from your mouth. You're the one who gasps when you make it in a single knuckle, and his body answers the question you asked, you think. Maybe. He's too tight for much, but it's a marvellous feeling, so you attempt to rock that finger in all the way. He appreciates the effort, top teeth a row of white biting directly into the pillow of his bottom lip, his cock bobbing rather than waning, pulling up between you.
He touched Harry by his shoulder and looked at him meaningfully. "I'm going outside for some fresh air. If I'm not back in a half-hour you can send a search party looking for me, okay?"
“How so?” Draco cracked his knuckles and spoke to the blankets. It was pathetic, Harry thought, that they couldn’t even look at each other while talking about these things. He found it charming on Draco, but could perfectly imagine Andromeda saying as much. Boys, still, rather than men, when it came to the truly difficult conversations.
He gave Draco's arm a final squeeze and placed it back in his lap, resting his head between where the bony points of his shoulder and collar bone met and his throat. Harry's head felt incredibly heavy, and it was good to rest there.
"Please, Daddy," Harry said, louder, though his voice shook, “fuck me.” The words made Draco's eyes flutter shut. His nostrils flared, a huff of hot breath before he thrust savagely into Harry.
He couldn't be sure, but he'd started receiving calls from an unknown number, though the line was always dead by the time he lifted his mobile to his ear.
Draco gave a knowing look to Harry as he passed by the doorway to the living room, one shared in confidence because Hermione and Ron's backs were to him and therefore they weren't treated to the raised brows and smirking lips. Harry was, and knew from the
"Twelve," Harry repeated. It seemed impossible. He remembered Draco, at twelve. Malfoy, then. Haughty; fantastic, though distracted during quidditch. He'd been pointier, his body struggling to catch up to a recent growth spurt. The sneers, and jibes, and under all that, already, so many scars. "That's over a decade ago."
Healer Annan's knowing smile was all teeth. He even had the mischievous twinkle in his eye that Dumbledore got, sometimes. He clearly wasn't above playing around, or below, or beside the rules when it suited him.
"You’re doing all you can for your body, but you deserve help. More than I can give. More than I know how. If your body is healthy at the expense of your happiness—if you can’t be comfortable? What’s that worth?"
Harry stared at the keys dangling from the door and wished that he had the will to take them and place them in the bowl on the sideboard—the sideboard that Draco had fucked him into before kicking him out—and then turn around and leave. Draco's inability to say the things he needed to his face—the fact that it had taken a chance encounter to bring them to this place—it was all wrong. It wasn't the declaration of care that Harry had been waiting on, wasn't even an actual invitation inside. This wasn't Draco trying, as far as Harry was concerned, but. But.
Truth be told, he was having a near-perfect month. This was evidenced by his mood, something so even and bright that it was after a half-hour of small talk with his Mind Healer, Martin, that he’d leant forwards and said, "Harry?"
“Headache?” Harry asked. He was breathing hard, though nowhere near as hard as Malfoy was. The air Harry needed passed through to his lungs, clear and gorgeous. He tipped his head back and closed his eyes. A single sunbeam from a jalousie window high on the wall cut through the din of the castle to warm half his face while Malfoy made sounds like wind pulled through a fleshy reeded instrument. It was glorious.
Harry woke slowly, turning over and stretching out, spread eagle across the width of the mattress. He was warm and still very under the blankets, contemplating the prospect of indulging in a morning pull with Draco's pillow as scented assistance when the object of his wandering mind re-entered the bedroom.
Harry squinted at the clouds gathering before them, a swirling mess of darkening greys and mottled purple and blues, the colour of old bruises, trying to make sense of it all. "But why pretend, you know? Why capitulate to his bullshit at all? For god's sake—you don’t even talk to one another—"
It was one of those sounds that tear a rip in the psyche and leave a scar. High, and tight, like Malfoy'd gone and swallowed a handful of razors and chased it with a harmonica. It was terrible, and Harry relished it.
thrown in jail." Ron sucked his teeth, shook his head. "Nobody got hurt because you didn't want anyone to get hurt. You see?"
floating in from the other room anytime something heavy fell to the floor, or a meal was pushed away unfinished, or anything.
Draco smiled, devilish and slow. "That would be telling." He seemed to remember where they were, took a half-step back, away from Harry. "Now look—we can’t leave together, for obvious reasons. I'll Floo to yours as I've got a very delicate potion on the hob, and I don’t trust that you won't trip over yourself and spill the whole thing. Wait a moment before you leave." He looked up, over Harry's shoulder. "Ah, there's the Minister who's hand you so wanted to shake—take your time with him."
I'll see myself out. I simply wanted to share the hot goss about who we pulled last night and, well," she smiled deviously in Harry's direction, "it looks like it's still going well. I thought you had rules, Draco. What about sex and breakfast—"
"Stop looking at the fucking ground like it's going to open up and answer all your stupid questions. Wash your mouth out and drink this, the whole thing."
Draco took a breath and let go of Harry's hand. He leaned away and scooped up a handful of pebbles, and started to organize them on the space on the log between them. First by colour, into hills of grey and green and black. Something flopped wetly into the lake; it was too dark to make out what, or where. They sat in silence as he arranged the pebbles in lines by size, the littlest ones by Draco's thigh, the largest near Harry's.
Draco’s friend continued to sit agog. Harry's smile widened. This was quickly becoming one of the more hilarious introductions he'd had with a fan in ages. He looked over his shoulder to Draco, who bit his lip playfully and shrugged, refusing to intervene or help this person who he'd clearly been conversing with before Harry arrived.
"Something tells me you wouldn't even if you had good reason to," she eyed him knowingly. "Reza's already been by with your order for the next few months. You wouldn't be trying to alter it for any reason, would you?"
"Alright, then." He took the stairs carefully, one at a time, picking his way around the pile of robes still laying in a heap. He leaned heavily on the bannister while gesturing with his free hand, and Harry was impressed that even while clearly about to fall over, he managed to come off composed.
“You can do things on your own here,” Harry said stubbornly. “All this stuff—it's just doubles of your things. It'd be easier if you, just, you know—moved them here. It’d be your study.”
Harry had caught him just out of the shower, white hair darkened to something of a natural blond by the damp clinging to it. His eyelashes were fine as spider silk, framing eyes with irises ringed in darkness. He'd been looking out a window on a rainy day, only a towel wrapped around his hips, and when Harry called his name and he turned, he'd taken the shot.
He blinked harder this time. It wasn't working. Draco's face came to him, tongue to the roof of his mouth, the rolling 'l' of
"But it's not always about better. Sometimes it's about justice," Harry said. Draco shook his head rapidly, eyes squeezed shut.
"I don't mind it at all, pet. Not that I don't mind trading every so often, but...I told you, I don't often bottom for anyone shorter than me."
She beckoned him into the side room and beyond the magically enhanced stanchions in place to keep some of his more rabid fans from jumping the line and taking a run for him. The placid look on her face brooked no animosity—she wasn't displeased with him, so he mustn't have done anything too terrible during the blank space in his memory.
“Please stop,” Harry pushed his glasses up to wipe at tears that felt like a betrayal of his body against his will. “Please. For me, stop. Even if I wanted it, I don’t deserve it.”
"My lips are sealed, I love you, chat soon you wanker. Laters!" she called. Both men sat in stony silence as her footsteps clanged down the staircase and the front door slammed.
"Well done." He clapped slowly, the sound echoing down the hallway. "Somebody's been paying attention in class. And no Granger to copy notes off of, brava."
"Of course, Victoria," Harry said. He patted her hand, hoping this was his dismissal and found her skin oddly papery to the touch. He often wondered how old she was. It was anyone's guess, with witches and wizards regularly living well into the one-or-two-hundreds. Ron pegged her at a young eighty, while Hermione thought her at least one-hundred but always obscured by all manner of glamours, potions, and other obfuscating magic.
as many times as he had, or been cut, or fallen, or burned, the meaning of a pain scale changed. Yes, there was a strain in his right shoulder—a building pressure, like it might be liable to pop out if pressed. But he didn't want Draco to stop. Anything less than an eight he could pretend didn't exist, anyways.
"It’s as though they bought stocks in my being super straight, you know? And forgot to tell me how important it was to them? So that's, you know, not a great feeling." Harry sighed, the remembered sting of Molly Weasley’s words still fresh, the memory replaying in his mind easily. "I feel a bit crap, actually."
—you look a fright, and it'll only scare him to see you like this. It'll be hours before he's awake.”
so that you can be as happy as I am. Just once, this year, I want you to know the happiness I feel when I wake up and roll over and catch you snoring."
"My arm." He looked to it and took a deep breath, rubbing the wrist. "It's getting worse, or I'm getting soft. Either way, it hurts all the time now."
to go and trust you, like a bloody idiot. I knew I shouldn't trust you, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. And it'll be about how all I have to do is sink to my knees, and I get anything I want."
That, and he knew that Draco needed to be dragged, even kicking and screaming, from his flat. Needed sunshine, though there was little of that on offer. Needed the warmth of the love of his friends around him, to be reminded how to smile, to be coached along until it was a skill he regained.
Draco didn't bother trying to keep still—his hips lifted from the mattress, arse clenched around Harry's hand when he dipped his fingers back inside of him.
"Now I won't go and do something stupid like fall back in bed with my ex just because he's here," Draco said dryly.
Draco flicked his eyes up to Harry as Pansy rose, still holding his hand, pulling him along with her. "This is my stop," she mumbled, squinting as though into bright light as she stumbled towards the door. Luna followed them, her pupils blown into pools of black, a permanent smile plastered on her face.
" he added with a snort. "As though being Muggle-born meant your magic wasn't worth as much as someone else's."
Malfoy stepped from the bath onto the tile, closing the distance Harry had so recently bought himself.
His own rapidly beating heart and shaking hands were quickly tamed as his drive to black-out waned. Draco dutifully provided him with a fresh vial of Dreamless Sleep each week, carefully portioned to avoid dependence. Harry weaned himself down to the bare minimum; enough to banish dreams, but not so much that he wasn't startled awake the first time Draco had a nightmare.
"Episode?" Ron tried to keep the note of worry from tingeing his voice but did a terrible job of it. Hermione looked at him and touched his hand, and Harry had to swallow the spike of anger that arose in him.
"I'm using a charm," Ron said good-naturedly as he stopped to give her a peck on the cheek and ambled over to Harry's right side.
"Yes, exactly, our union," Draco said aloud as Kreacher turned back to face him, worrying the corner of his newly cleaned toga between a thumb and finger. "It's paramount that we make a good showing of it. Consider this the reintroduction of the estate to the public. An evolution, if you will, to the modern House of Black."
"It's early still, and the specialist hasn't been in yet to see him, but he's awake. Patient Malfoy's asked for you."
Harry guffawed, shaking his head. He caught sight of Neville over Ginny's shoulder, deep in conversation with Parvati Patil near their section's entrance. Even before Neville knew he was gay, he'd never given Harry a second look when Ginny pulled him aside for a chat—he trusted him implicitly, as a friend.
Harry swallowed a few times, trying to digest the concept. Almost three weeks was longer than he'd ever been away from anything—the Dursley's, or the life of a schoolboy at Hogwarts, or the drudgery of war, or of training, or of this new line of work he'd invented for himself. He'd never been out of the country longer than a weekend.
was fresh enough to Teddy that he perked up at it. Pre-school was, quite literally, still all fun and games to him.
Draco took a sip of water, buying time to collect himself. Here he was, giving truths to acquaintances, some of them strangers, that he rarely shared with those who knew him best.
. But I need to make it on my own two feet. I want to be known for my abilities, not my name, and certainly not because of yours. I want to be
Draco wasn’t in his flat when Harry came in. He used the key he’d been given, took his shoes off and arranged them, toes to the wall, the way Draco liked. He called, and no answer came. There was, however, the sound of explosively breaking glass from above him.
Victoria didn't know about this clandestine plan of Harry's—couldn't, it would give her a heart attack, to learn of Harry trying to play the Minister of Magic for what amounted to a personal favour—but that was for the best. She'd started biting her nails since Harry had told her of Draco, had hand-delivered a roll of scrolls in dense legalese to have him sign.
"You get wasted. Big woop! Who cares?" Ron's breathing accelerated, his frown turning to a sneer. He pressed a thumb deep into the opposite palm, focusing on that when he couldn't look Harry in the eye to deliver his next words, the ones he'd been working up to.
"You're his what?" Susan asked, looking to Harry for confirmation. Harry nodded, making a garbled sound. He cleared his throat as Draco looked at him, arms crossed and face amused.
Draco swallowed, testing the words in his mouth a few times before he could push them out with sound.
"Alright?" Hermione watched him curiously. He nodded, gave a squeeze to the fingers in his grip and then let them go.
, he thought, scrutinizing Charlie instead. People who voluntarily spent most of their time with animals rather than with humans tended to be a little shy.
"If you read my intake forms, they'd tell you that at the tender age of nineteen I was alcohol dependent, surprising no one." He stopped to cough and clear his throat, to keep it from wobbling. "Gin, straight, was my preference, though ten beer would do just as well for tea. I was a constant and avid user of all manner of drugs, but the opiate dependence was something of a marvel—cocaine became freebasing, which was, oh god, how to describe it? Like warm orgasms? I fucking
—" Draco winced in melodramatic disdain, "and perhaps a bottle of that sun cream Granger so enjoys going on about—"
"I won't. I'm really sorry, Draco," Harry said. His throat felt tight, even if the chances of him crying were zero. "I don't have an excuse."
"Boys!" Hermione warned, and they both raised their wand hands, pointing them at the ceiling, grips loosened. They knew better than to draw up her wrath by fooling around in the kitchen again.
had the room back in order in no time, and it wasn't long after that Hermione's grudging forgiveness was bought with Harry's spag bol and Ron whispering things that made her blush into her ear.
Ron cleared his throat, clearly enjoying himself. "You're the master of the house, and the house recognizes that whoever it is that you've been clandestinely bringing by is likely to be its new master too. And that you need some help convincing this new master to accept you. Used to happen all the time."
Somehow now, though, the words dried up in Harry's throat. He opened his mouth, but he couldn't force them out, no matter how many times he'd practiced in the mirror earlier.
"I know exactly who you are," he said gruffly, his thin top lip pulled back with disdain. Draco’s smile didn’t falter for a moment as he withdrew his hand and put it in his pocket, easy as could be.
“It’s the cloak closet,” Draco sighs, flicking his eyes to the white bi-fold doors on the wall opposite the kitchen galley. “The smell’s in the paint. Can’t get it out.”
"It's that you like upsetting things, Harry. Don't get me wrong, it's not necessarily a bad thing; it's just—you're never content with the old ways of doing things. Traditional ways."
“Leave the needles to me, won’t you? Don’t tell me you’re taking your own blood samples for some potion.”
As the door clicked shut behind him, he made a note to himself to send roses with those little white florets mixed in. No card.
Harry cleared his throat, snapped back. The freeze-frame wasn’t a good one anymore. He didn’t want to remember Draco looking worried at him, or god forbid,
"What’s with the watch?" He almost managed the question without gasping. Draco shrugged, dragged the hand, rolling Harry’s foreskin up and down. Playing.
"I shouldn't be doing this," he muttered, though Harry knew he'd be bursting to tell the story to his friends later.
Harry thought as he thrust back, impaling himself another inch on Draco's cock, making them groan in unison.
Hermione gave him a genuine smile, studiously ignoring Ron's glare. "Hi, Malfoy. How are you keeping?"
"My cousin Ithaca, she runs most of the building contracts east of Germany for the old guard. Could go a long way in expediting your home for lonely waifs project."
. Just thinking it made Harry’s mouth pucker like he’d been sucking on a lemon. Ever since his therapist had first introduced the concept to him the week before it had become a thorn in his side, and lucky for him, Hermione read its definition only a few days later. He hated it because it confused him. It implied that both parties in what they thought was a charming relationship could, in fact, be wrong. It turned acts of devotion into the pitiful return of a beaten dog, offering itself up for its latest lashing.
"He's not," Draco said, and everyone in the room suddenly remembered that he was there. "He's scared about my being accepted meaning that I'm forgiven, and that you’ll forget your brother. He sees me as a threat, but I don't think it's really because we're lavender," he said with a wry look at Harry. The Weasley children shared long looks; it really was quite obvious.
And Harry should have made a note to self to check in on him the next week. Should have thought of him later, written a note to Narcissa while James and Gin made a mess of the raked leaves Harry left in the yard. He should have, but Mr Barron was next, and Harry was high on the encounter, so he didn’t. Didn’t think about why Draco transfiguring pins and sticking them places he ought not to was a problem.
Draco tried to pull his hand away, but Harry held fast. "That's it," he said, his thumb gently brushing over Draco's knuckles. He had to push the words out even when they felt like knives in his throat. "That's what I want."
"Hear, hear!" yelled Pansy, as Luna shushed her. A subdued laugh went up as the crowd quietened. Harry couldn't be sure in the low light, but he was fairly certain it wasn't a charm for a blusher that had Draco flushed a high pink.
"You can't just go using Legilimency on someone whenever you like. My thoughts are private!" he yelled. The air was sucked from the room as the lights flickered, as though a sudden squall had kicked up.
He pulled the shirt back down to fumble with its buttons, then removed his socks, then trousers and pants in one go. He crawled to the middle of Draco's bed, a size bigger than his mattress at home, and flipped onto his back, feet hanging loosely over the long edge. Draco watched him from an armchair in the corner of the room as he propped himself up on his elbows. He was half-hard, and his right hand went to his cock for a tug. A nervous tick to cover himself when he was naked. Draco was fuzzy in the dim light as the spell to correct his vision faded, but Harry could see he was smiling. A happy ghost with a crimson smile.
He pressed the button for the seventh floor as they entered the elevator and waited until the doors slid closed to push Harry into the wall. He gasped from surprise as the cold of the metal was pressed into his damp back.
"Come on; it's not that difficult a question. I'll let you get away with saying 'good' instead of 'well' if you'd just finish your bloody sentence."
"Remember," Harry panted out, louder now to make sure he heard him, "remember how we used your come as lube for round two?"
"You owe me fifty quid," he said, and when Hermione nodded slowly and said, "That, I do," Harry had the wherewithal to gasp.
Harry took a deep swig, the cold feeling of it running down his throat a welcome refreshment. The condensation gathering on the neck of the bottle at least gave his fingers something to fiddle with. To hell if it wasn't yet noon.
They both managed smiles at the joke that wasn't a joke of Harry's life. As they turned the corner, he started talking instead about the menu and how Harry had to try the ahi tuna in smoked leek leaves, and something about non-alcoholic sake and Harry knew then that
Harry pushed himself up to sit, glad that he was already in joggers, and toed into the same trainers he'd kicked off the night before. He was almost relieved to feel grimy, his mouth a desert and his brain precarious within his skull. Kreacher's lecture made him anxious to get on with it—to push himself through a run that would probably leave him heaving by Camden, and he'd deserve it too, because he wasn't treating the young heir like anything more than a vessel to get off with, and that feeling left Harry feeling something too dark even to name.
"You suffered head trauma, not unlike a motor vehicle accident. Your brain swole in ways that we couldn't immediately correct with magic."
"Understood," Harry said, smirking from behind his glass of wine to hide the rise of anxiety within him.
"Did the—" Harry gestured vaguely, struggling to phrase his question, "did the, uh, stuff about your arm, did that get put in?"
"Unfortunately not. I'd rather not give them the pleasure of my paying a fine or get thrown in jail overnight."
scars Harry left there. He didn't have time to reminisce, refused to spend the time in this loo thinking of that time in another. His entire being was locked on Draco's perfect cock, a sight he knew he'd be wanking to until he gave up wanking.
Harry realized far too late that he'd been staring at Malfoy's mouth, at the soft fullness of lips, and they stood close enough that he could see where his eyelashes were still clumped together into golden spikes. Malfoy's smile dimmed, and he turned away from Harry, grabbing the last of his things. The redness of his chafed cheeks would take a bit of work to get out; Harry wished, oddly, that he could see Malfoy again soon and know that they'd healed up properly.
“Fat chance of that,” she rolled her eyes and granted him one of her rare smiles. When she stood to leave she pressed two packs of Parliament cigarettes onto the scratched tabletop.
"Or do you prefer to be called our saviour? Or does your Auror status mean I'm meant to address you as Auror Potter?" He tilted his head, taking in Harry, unblinking. "The papers simply can't seem to choose. Someone ought to provide them with a style guide," he said conversationally.
Draco pushed the glass away from himself and washed his hands over his head, resting his elbows on the table and speaking to his lap.
"No need. Sorry to ruin the mood—we can still go—out, I mean. Now that I’m all fixed up and gorgeous again.” He gave Harry a little smile, but his eyes were pleading.
"I'm as fine as I can be, under the circumstances," he said instead, and Harry nodded like that made sense. It was hard to believe that Draco so easily believed the rubbish story—that Harry had been running around with Justin behind his back, and that fateful evening had been the culmination of their breakup. The alternative seemed more far-fetched—involved collusion between politicians and the media, required for Justin to be the demented one rather than the fame-starved Boy Who Lived. But Draco came with his own set of memories, history, triggers. All Harry wanted was to be believed, this once, but he knew better than to think that wanting to be believed had much if any impact on having that wish granted.
Harry's eyes watered when he made it to the base, and he took a moment to ground himself. He held there, adjusting, breaths coming in soft huffs from his nose.
Ron dragged his tongue between his bottom lip and teeth like he always did when considering something.
Harry attended readings and film screenings and even a foreign Quidditch match (over in under an hour—what could you do), while Draco got hopelessly lost among bookshelves in places with quiet auras and creaky, wooden floors. Every city had a used book store that simply
"I'm asking now, and it's the only time I'll ask politely. What's happened, pet?" Draco waited patiently through the long pause.
A synth's sound came on over the speaker system, a chorus of children's voices joining in soon after.
