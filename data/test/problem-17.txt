“Definitely, it's no bother at all.” Draco replied, softening his expression to exude genuineness. Harry nodded slowly, going back into his room to change into more appropriate dinner party attire.
“I’m in the kitchen.” Draco nearly whispered, eager to bring the yelling to an end.
Harry glanced over at Draco, confused.
Draco felt his chest get heavy, like his body was having a physical reaction to this sinking feeling that he wasn’t going to like what Noah is going to say next.
“C'mon mate, it can’t be that bad.” Casper was always one to look on the positive side of things, it’s what made them such a good pairing. As the years passed, Harry has gotten more and more pessimistic, which wasn’t always ideal for this line of work.
Harry’s mouth lingered over the nape of his neck, causing Draco to lean his head back subconsciously, giving him more access. Harry placed a soft kiss over the pale skin, the connection of skin setting his body ablaze, his nerves all alert.
“I think you’re saying things you might regret tomorrow.”  Fuck you. Harry wanted to say. I’m trying to tell you how I feel and you’re shutting it down. Fuck. You.
Harry stuck his finger under the opening of the envelope, ripping the paper and peeking inside.
There was always the fact that Harry was not even an option, he had made it so painfully clear that whatever had happened between them the night before was no more than a casual shag; Draco had slept with a string of men that he had not even given a second thought to the morning after, he shouldn’t have expected Harry to treat him any different. Despite this fact, his gut still wrenched at the words from this morning. We were both just drunk and horny. Although there was truth behind the words, Draco had allowed himself to believe it was something more, the blossoming of a new beginning into uncharted territory. To have the illusion broken down was perhaps the most painful.
Draco didn’t know if he was relieved or offended.
“Oh c’mon lad, it's been long enough. We know all about your little crush on Malfoy back at Hogwarts.” Harry’s face turned pink, what crush?
“It’s no worry at all. Draco, how have you been?” Hermione asked, her head tilting lightly in curiosity.
“Why would it be wrong?”
“You underestimate my connections Cadmus, the Ministry had already placed that nasty traitor underneath their protection earlier in the day. Along with Draco Malfoy.”
“Look, we have to keep you under Ministry supervision, we can’t explain why right now so you’ll just have to trust us.”
“I’ve been good, super good.” He trailed off, his eyes cool and distant.
Harry knew there was a part of him that was lying to himself, afraid to reveal any tiny essence of affection - or even love - for Draco, his stubborn character refusing to give him the satisfaction. And although they had become friends, quiet close friends actually, there was still an underlying sense of competition, as if admitting any feelings for Draco would mean he had lost.
Noah George David and Aurora Elizabeth Williams
He lit his cigarette, even this simple act reminding him of Harry. How he would light it for him, his hands clasped to block the wind, his face focused as he flicked his thumb over the metal. His face and body so close to his that it was impossible not to breathe in his intoxicating scent. It had become such a habit for him to notice Harry in his everyday routine, while he was cooking dinner, watching movies, pouring himself a glass of scotch, he was inevitable to avoid.
His back arched lightly to bring his head closer to Harry’s, his eyes fluttering shut in expectation of something more.
“Sure, let me just get my stuff, I’ll meet you by the entrance.” Aaron nodded, his appearance lately has been more and more solemn. Draco felt he should be concerned, but whenever he asked Aaron about it directly, he just avoided the question or changed the subject. After a while, Draco stopped asking.
Harry turned his head up to look at the sky, his eyes catching on a blonde man standing on the balcony. Squinting his eyes, he was able to recognize the shape of Draco, his heart catching in his throat as he did. He was only a few stories up, still living in what he imagined to be the penthouse suite of the shorter building.
“Tell me all about it.” Casper sighed, pulling up a chair and taking out a notepad, resembling a makeshift shrink's office.
After work Harry chose to go out with Casper to distract himself from the lack of Draco’s presence in his home. They had gone out to a muggle pub, something they do often as Harry can’t go more than a few blocks in the wizarding world before being stopped by one bloke or another, asking for an autograph or the answers to extremely personal questions about Harry’s life and the war.
The heat in the apartment was getting unbearable, Draco drank the rest of his glass before filling it back up again, grabbing a lighter off of the counter and walking onto the balcony for a smoke, his body swaying slightly from the alcohol.
They threw back shot after shot, laughing loudly and throwing their heads back in glee.
Ahhh! What do you guys think is going to happen? I'd love to hear your responses :)
To this Harry responded by pressing his lips against Draco’s with a bit more force, still keeping the kiss tender and soft, as if afraid that movements too quick or harsh would break the spell. Draco kissed back lightly, before pulling away.
“I’m afraid that's not an option.”
They were sat in the back of a muggle bistro that serves bottomless mimosas and a plethora of fatty brunch options. They had chosen a table towards the back corner, still well lit by the high winter sun.
He heard the door open quietly, Harry shutting it softly like he was sneaking back into his childhood home. This irritated Draco more than he cared to admit, if what had happened was just another accidental occurrence between lads then why was the sneaking around necessary?
“I was not jealous! I was simply… curious. Is all.” Harry tried to defend himself, the flush in his cheeks obviously giving him away.
Draco suppressed a laugh rising in his chest when looking at Harry’s current state; his hair messy and pulled apart, his lips slightly red and his shirt untucked with a few buttons undone. To say he looked unkempt would be an understatement.
Aaron’s face was unreadable, a stone cold expression on his face that he had never seen before. He had dark undereye bags and his skin was pale and unkept.
“Thanks for letting me stay here.” Draco said, not turning around.
“You know, if you were going to drain my liquor cabinet, you could’ve at least texted. I would have picked up replacements on the way home.” Harry said, although he honestly didn’t really care, he was just trying to make conversation.
“Whatever, whatever. Just open it” Draco responded, eager to see his reaction.
They got onto the conversation of clubbing and gay bars. Draco had never known who Aaron was interested in, whether it be girls or boys, he’s mentioned having girlfriends in the past, but had never been too enthusiastic about them.
What Draco felt he truly needed was a break, a vacation maybe, anything to allow him to just relax apart from everyone in his life, Noah specifically. He still didn’t know how he was going to act once they had to finally see each other again. He already had about 3 missed calls and a couple of texts from him asking to talk, all of which he had ignored. Draco didn’t understand what there was to talk about, they had never been exclusive - obviously - and Noah had every right to go and propose to his girlfriend.
“We’re here.” the taxi driver said, clearly eager for the two of them to pay and leave.
He continued to get ready, drying himself off, styling his hair, getting dressed from his obscene amount of muggle clothing that he knew flattered his body in the best way. As he was finished, he walked to his kitchen, casting a spell to quickly make himself food. Normally he loved cooking, it was the only thing that ever forced him to slow down. The process of taking immense care while preparing a meal brought him peace and steadied his mind, already being late however, he quickly ate his breakfast and apparated to work.
“So.. she doesn’t know?”
I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter!
Harry finished off his drink, now drunk, and followed Draco out onto the balcony. Draco already had a cigarette in his mouth, looking over at Harry, realizing he forgot a lighter. Harry pulled one out of his pocket, and lit his cigarette before grabbing one for himself. The breeze was sharp and cool, and worsened since they were on a higher floor of the apartment building. Draco shivered, pressing up against Harry’s shoulder, so their arms were shoved side by side. Harry ignored his stomach and continued taking puffs of his cigarette. Draco was already putting out his first cigarette and reaching for a second.
He looked up at Harry through his eyebrows as he lit the cigarette for him, their faces close. Harry grabbed the cigarette box from Draco’s back pocket, taking one out for himself and lighting it in his mouth, taking a long drag as he rested his elbow on the balcony railing.
It was another typical day after work, Draco had stopped by a nearby grocery store to pick up some ingredients for dinner. He had invited Marie and Olive, Harry said he would leave the apartment for the evening to give them some time alone. The fluorescent lighting in the store was illuminating a wide array of cheeses that he was stuck choosing between, growing more wary of the time by the second. He grabbed a handful of random feta’s and gouda cheeses, rushing to get home in time to prepare for their arrival. Rushing home, he apparated to the door of the apartment, scurrying to the kitchen to prepare.
“Aaron? That's… unexpected.” he replied.
They were going to a lunch bistro a few blocks away from his office, he snuggled his face into his scarf, attempting to hide his face from the wind. They had sat down near the back of the establishment, tucked away into a corner.
“Thanks to both of your patience and cooperation, I’m glad to say that your current living arrangements are no longer necessary. Despite us still tracking down some of the leaders of the Renovation, we have secured the majority of its members. I’m sure the two of you are relieved to be out of each other's hair, and I’m sorry that this was obligatory for longer than I initially thought.” He spoke, a cheeky grin on his face, almost waiting for an exclamation of joy to escape their mouths.
“Merlin, Malfoy. You scared me. The tea is in that cupboard above the kettle, I should have chamomile in there somewhere.” Harry stated as he turned back towards his files.
Despite this, he finds himself trying not to worry about the details, instead he focuses on the little things, like watching his chest rise and fall in this hazy sunlit room, he’s sure that when the time comes, Harry will come around.
Instead, both of the men simply sat silently in their chair, a slight smile on their lips but nothing more.
The next few weeks of his life flew by painfully slow, Christmas was only a few weeks away and his interactions with both Harry and Aaron have been close to none. Despite Harry insisting that the hookup meant nothing, he had been actively avoiding Draco. The Ministry had rescued his parents around 2 weeks ago, and although Draco was ecstatic, he couldn’t help but feel a pang in his chest when Harry didn’t mention a word about it in the passing days.
“I um-” his voice got quiet, “I’m sorry”. Harry spoke so quietly it nearly resembled a whisper.
“No.”
They waited in line for around 15 minutes, the alcohol they had taken at home already taking its effect. It’s been a while since Draco has been clubbing, so the hot air that hit his skin as he walked into the building felt familiar. The music pounding into his ears as he walked past groups of sweaty, intoxicated, bodies. He turned to make sure that Aaron was still behind him, grabbing his hand and leading him further into the dance floor. Draco’s body swayed to the music, the strobe lights illuminating his face periodically, the alcohol adding to the heat of his own skin. He remembered the days from his early twenties when he would take molly with his friends before going, their minds fuzzy and pupils dilated, urging them to be closer to each other. Although his days of MDMA filled nights were over, the experience still felt oddly comforting and freeing. After a while of dancing, they walked towards the bar, needing water and more shots before returning back to the floor. He leaned his body over the bar counter, giving his feet a break from holding up his body. Aaron ordered a round of shots for them, placing a hand on Draco’s back. The bartender slid their shots across the counter, Draco lifting his head and tilting it back as he slipped the alcohol down his throat. Suddenly remembering the warmth of Harry’s arm pressed against his from the night before. He ordered another round of shots, hoping to drink his mind into forgetting.
Harry felt the nerves in his spine ignite, he had his differences with Draco but he knew the pain of losing his parents. He wasn’t sure how Draco would react to the news of his parents being targets of the Renovation, but he knew that he had a right to know. If Harry had an option of coming to his parents aide, he would do it without hesitation.
“Merlin, I thought they would hate me.” Draco sighed in relief, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Glad that the interaction didn’t get out of hand like he predicted. Harry laughed and rubbed his hair, his hand lingering a little longer at the nape of his neck.
Harry leaned over and placed a firm kiss on Draco’s forehead, cupping his cheek with his hand. He rose from his seat, slipping on Harry’s jacket. It was the closest thing, and he also enjoyed how his cologne lingered on the collar and filled Draco’s nose with his scent, even when he wasn’t near. He grabbed the cigarettes from the front entrance and walked onto the familiar balcony.
“Unfortunately, your mother and father have recently gotten captured by this group. We believe they are being held at the Renovation headquarters, as far as we know, they are alive.”
“I had to! For my job, Draco. It wasn’t an option!”
Draco had never seen Harry this gone, even when they went to the party he still had his wits.
“Look, Draco.. I wanted to talk to you about something, I already mentioned it to Marie and Oliver and they were supportive and I hope that you will be too”
Apparently, Harry went through a phase where he smoked pot a lot, it was in his last year at Hogwarts, he mainly used it to dull the memories of the war. Hermione was convinced it was becoming a dependency, making Harry swear he would never touch the substance again. Obviously, he had, just occasionally now at parties. Draco found this funny, he hadn’t pictured Harry to be a stoner but the title seemed to fit him.
“Merlin, Harry. What did you do?” Draco said, his face ghostly pale and palms clammy. He had never seen Harry so distraught, he looked awful. Harry just sobbed in response, something that only irritated Draco further.
Draco stood for a few seconds, contemplating her words before following her. As he sat back down in his seat he looked at Harry, his warm brown hair cascading over his forehead, the light from the candles they had lit hitting his face as he laughed at something Oliver said. Harry looked over at Draco as if he could feel eyes on him, giving him a small smile, lingering for just a moment too long before turning back to his conversation.
“Surprise!” They both chanted in unison.
Dinner was served, accompanied by an implicit undertone of flirtation. A foot riding up Harry’s calf, hiking up his pants slightly. A hand placed casually on Draco’s thigh, sliding itself up higher towards his hip unknowingly.
Harry reached at Draco’s arm, gripping it firmly.
He joined Ron in his boisterous yelling and jumping around the path to the town, yelling out random profanities and laughing like it was the funniest thing in the world. He caught glimpses of Draco rolling his eyes and saying something to Hermione.
A jolt of arousal goes straight to his cock, and a surprised laugh bubbles up from the squirmy tangle of nerves in his belly, before he can stop it.
Fifi nods again and Disapparates back to the house. Harry slings the cloak over both of them, and they shuffle back across the square and carefully open the front door.
"About the case... I've been meaning to ask you about a spell for sorting out ripped-up books. Ron said you might know one?"
“Yeah. At least we think so. Is it even real?”
Hermione uses her wand to spell the wrinkles out of her skirt, tucks her bag under her arm and starts walking towards the Museum.
He’s finally closing his hand around the small bag, when there’s a warm hand on his shoulder. He allows himself to lean into Draco’s touch for just a moment, before turning around.
"No. The magic disappeared when you finished the spell."
“Yeah. You’re probably right. You are right.” A small laugh bubbles through him. He feels like an idiot. “I’m sorry for being such a whiny git. We should keep our heads clear right now.”
Hermione narrows her eyes dangerously. “No he’s not! He’s an archaeologist. He specialises in ancient magical artefacts.”
“Go ahead. It’s your Pensieve.”
“Bloody hell!” He looks over at Ron and finds him trying to dislodge a Kneazle that seems to have decided to climb his leg. He’s looking so disgusted that Harry bursts into a very inappropriate laugh. After all, this is a murder scene.
“Fifi is not a healer, Monsieur. But Fifi can stop the blood.”
“I don’t want to go to St Mungo’s,” he says.
“There’s no need to risk denting it, Malfoy. I’ll just admire it from afar.” He lowers his voice again. “And you’d better watch Harry’s back.”
“Is she sleeping?” she whispers.
He should be used to the Muggle references by now, but those words coming from Draco still sound so strange.
“Well, as I said, I haven’t found much yet. There are a few hints in some of my books, but they’re vague, and there’s no answer to the most important question.”
He walks over to a small desk in the corner, and thumbs through an old fashioned notebook.
The ropes shoot from his wand as they’re supposed to, but Bludger manages to dodge them by diving behind the open shed door.
“What? How?”
Bludger is not an easy person to find. He’s not in the Beheaded Goblin when Harry and Ron go there on Sunday afternoon, disguised as a couple of middle aged Quidditch fans. They spend most of Monday and Tuesday reading through old cases, seeing if there’s any mention of the New Dawn or a chalice classified as a dark artefact. They come up with nothing, and in the afternoons they take Polyjuice and go to the pub. On Wednesday, Ron comes up with a slightly different plan. He thinks that the regulars at the pub might be getting suspicious of all the different newcomers, so instead of going in as a couple of blokes, he persuades the DMLE receptionist to donate one of her hairs, and asks Harry to wear his cloak. Perhaps a single girl will seem less suspicious.
“His name is Adrian Wright. He’s in his fifties, pureblood, the family were known supporters of Voldemort, but he never took the Mark... or maybe it was never offered to him. His family lost everything after the first war and he’s been keeping to himself ever since, with the exception of trips to the Muggle shops in the village a few times a week for cigarettes and beer. His last known contact with the magical world was a Floo call a few weeks ago by his sister. Davies and his partner are trying to contact her. She’s the only living relative.”
The Floo at Malfoy Manor is in the entrance hall. The dark blue hearth rug is soft enough to mask the sound of Harry’s clumsy exit from the fireplace. He steps to the side to unblock the path for Hermione and looks around as he brushes a few specks of ash away from his jumper. Admittedly, he didn't spend a lot of time looking at his surroundings when he was dragged here by the snatchers, but he's fairly sure that the room didn't look this bright and inviting.
Several cups of tea and discarded files later, he’s skimming through Bludger’s family history, when Ron shows up, grinning from ear to ear.
“When he was giving me my orders.”
“Good. You should go back to Mysteries and see how Auror Weasley is doing.”
“She can’t tell you much about the actual work. She’s able to tell us a few things because Aurors have class b clearance, but no details or anything really exciting. And I’m dead curious! She’s working on a project right now that has her wearing wellies to work and coming home covered in mud. And the only thing she can tell me is that she’s working with Malfoy! And then she shoots me this meaningful look, like I’m supposed to figure out what the project is about, just from knowing that she’s working with that bloody wanker! The only thing that tells me is that it’s something Dark. And probably illegal.” Ron scowls into his pint with so much feeling it makes Harry laugh.
“Because it won’t harm you.” Harry doesn’t have to look at Hermione to know that she’s rolling her eyes. “You’re a pure-blood.”
Harry Floos into the atrium and manages not to stumble at all. Which is lucky, since he lands in the middle of a press conference. Percy is standing in front of the fountain, surrounded by photographers and reporters.
“Someone will be here to take care of the cats as soon as we clear the scene. And they’ve sent an MLE officer out to buy cat food. He’ll feed them in the hall. Hopefully that’ll keep them occupied for a while.”
“Yes, please! Read the one with the hopping pot.”
“You go ahead, I’ll catch up.” He gestures at where one shoelace is trailing along the ground.
“No. She told me you would handle it, since it’s your case. I’ll take you through to the crime scene.”
“It must be in his old study. Mother had the elves lock it up after the war. I think everything is as he left it.” His smile fades. “Including the curses. I’m not sure we’ll be able to get in there, at least not right now. It could take days to dismantle the wards.”
“Yeah. I can’t wait to see the cup! Kitty Tor, right? At eight?”
“Scara Brae? Maybe going north’ll shake them off.”
Savage uses her wand to project images from the crime scene onto the wall: the responding DMLE officers standing guard against the door leading out of the cluttered bedroom, and he spots Cho Chang in her lime green healer robes apparating in with the medical team. Not that there’s anything they’ll be able to do, Harry thinks. The man lying on the bed is definitely dead. There’s blood everywhere.
“You disappeared.” Draco’s frowning, a small crease forming between his brows.
“Ah! Potter! I just wanted to make sure you! I just wanted to make sure you were in one piece. Weasley and Unspeakable Granger told me what happened, but I wanted to hear it from you too.”
Draco flips the book open. Somehow they've moved closer together. So close that Harry's arm brushes against Draco's and sends a tingly shiver down his spine, when he leans in to take a closer look.
“Yes, quite. But never mind. Let’s go to my office. It’s warmer and more private.”
“My Aunt and the Dark Lord used to practise Legilimency on me. It’s the way my father found out I wasn’t as heterosexual as he assumed. My aunt taunted me for weeks about it. She would threaten to tell, and then not do it anyway. Over and over again. I had no idea when she might suddenly tell my parents. And when the Dark Lord looked into my mind I’d feel… so fucking exposed. I couldn’t let someone do that to me again. I’d rather sit in an Azkaban cell”
Harry whips around and sees Bludger turning to Disapparate, one hand grabbing the Chalice. Ron has seen it too, and is diving for it. He grabs at the Chalice, but only manages to graze it with his fingertips. There’s a blinding light, the echo of a laugh, a pop of Disapparition and then nothing.
“Now, let’s try this again. Do you see this memo? That’s a SDEA autorisation. Do you know what that means? It means that if you don’t comply with the veritaserum, I’m authorised to bring an Unspeakable in here and have her Legilimise you. So, I’m going to need to know which it’ll be.”
“Thank you for coming,” Draco says politely.
He looks down into big brown eyes. He misses this, he realises. These last few days have been so busy, and except for reading to her yesterday, he hasn’t really had time to play with his goddaughter. He really wishes he could tell her yes. He shakes his head.
“Harry? What’s happened.”
“Yeah. About that... I… I wanted to apologise for bringing you along in the first place. That wasn’t a fair position to put you in.”
“We should go. The match starts in twenty minutes,” Draco puts in.
“I saw it! I had no idea Jamie Cadogan was involved with that lot.”
Draco shakes his head. “Not anymore.” he steps closer, forcing Harry to take two quick steps back into the shadowy corner behind the shed. Draco follows him.
“Wh- oh,” Draco says faintly. He staggers back to the bench and sits down, hiding his face in his hands for a moment, and Harry’s heart swoops. Fuck! There’s no way he could have put the things he’s just said delicately, but maybe barging in here like this was a bad idea.
“Yeah. She fell asleep while I read to her. She insisted that Ron always reads her at least three bedtime stories.”
Ron shakes his head, but there’s no real malice there. “You’re as bad as Hermione!”
“We’ll start with threats and old SDEA cases. See if we can find a connection, somehow,” Ron says.
Lucius is quiet for a few seconds. "Why would you need my help with that, Mr Potter? Draco is a leading expert on ancient artefacts, is he not? And I imagine you have the collective resources of the Ministry at your disposal, by virtue of your... previous accomplishments.” He shrugs, and the motion makes the heavy iron chains that bind his wrists rattle. Even Lucius himself seems surprised by the sound. “No matter what the reason is, I can't help you unless you are quite a bit more specific." He concludes.
“Only his first. John.”
“Might as well.” He shrugs. “We’re not getting anywhere with this.”
“All right, all right. No need to get your wand all bent out of shape! Maybe I’ve heard a few things after all.”
Harry doesn’t really know, but his imagination immediately suggests a range of scenarios, one more scary than the other. In case someone breaks out of prison and takes their boat. In case there’s a storm coming. In case someone tries to sabotage it, to prevent them from leaving. This place is making him paranoid.
“St. Mungo’s–but I’ll be fine to go on my own, if you want to go home, or to your office or somewhere else. Erm. I mean...  I can Floo you after I check in with Ron.”
“Thanks, Mr Granger.”
“Thank you for your help. We’ll contact your cousin. I’m sorry to bother you, but can I please use your toilet before we Apparate to Dorset?”
The elf appears almost immediately. When she sees Draco, her ears droop and quiver, and her huge eyes fill with tears.
The small elf appears almost without sound.
“Who committed the murders?”
Harry watches as Malfoy straightens up, but it’s obvious that he’s still a bit wobbly. He rests a hand on the nearest lamppost and turns his face into the wind.
“Hermione Apparated us here. Besides, I was under the impression that we were trying to keep this out of the papers,” Draco says calmly. “Mostly for your brother’s sake.”
“And did you participate in the murders of Adrian and Adrienne Wright?”
Harry winks at her and pretends he doesn’t notice.
Draco nods. “You don’t have to explain anything to me. You’re a grown man. It’s not anyone else’s decision to make.”
Fuck. Harry hadn’t even thought about that.
Harry feels like he’s about to be sick. He looks at Draco and Hermione, and they both look like they’re in shock. Hermione is pale as a ghost, and Draco… two bright red spots are visible on his cheeks, and he looks like he’s fighting to stay upright. He’s gritting his teeth, and Harry can see the muscles in his jaw throb. He looks livid.
“I like your flat. It suits you.”
They pull out of the Pensieve at the same time, gasping for air, and shaking their heads to clear away the disorientation. Harry speaks first, while Ron is still shaking his head like a dog, trying to dislodge the Pensieve liquid from his ears and spraying droplets all over the small, dark room. Harry has never understood why the only Pensieve in the Ministry must be stored in what must at one point have been the Department of Mysteries broom cupboard.
“Bludger mentioned that they have a boss. Shouldn’t we be trying to figure out who that might be?”
A tension he didn’t even know he’d been carrying leaves his shoulders, and he envelopes his friends in a tight hug, not caring that they’re standing in the middle of the Ministry. “I’m so happy for you!” he whispers into Ron’s shoulder and Hermione’s hair.
He almost barrels right into Ron in the Atrium. He’s spelling away something that looks like either snot or porridge from his sleeve, so Harry guesses that it was his turn to get up early with Rose this morning.
Their teamwork is a well choreographed dance, as they work back to back, one of them facing the door at all times. It’s something that has been drilled into them since the first week of training, and by now it comes as naturally as breathing. They finish cataloguing the small living room in a couple of minutes and move towards the open bedroom door. The medical team have packed up and are standing in the doorway waiting for the go ahead to walk through the living room and Floo back to St Mungo’s.
“No, I’m fine. Just… the new skin. It’s… sensitive.”
There’s a rap on the partition and Hermione peeks around the corner. She’s a little muddy and windswept, and she’s smiling. She tucks a strand of hair behind her ear and apologises for the interruption.
“Aww! Did Mummy set a curfew?” Tall Bloke pipes up. Harry shows him his middle finger.
"Interesting. You know I can't tell you much more than that."
“I wasn’t! Honestly!” Ron smiles at her. “Actually, I was thinking maybe you could…”
“That’s not true,” Ron says. “We’ve gained lots of information. But I think we need a strategy.”
“None of that, now, Harry,” Percy tuts. “I’m sure you’re all aware that Harry is an old family friend,” he says to the reporters, and maneuvers Harry to stand next to him, giving the photographers room to capture a shot of them both, with Dumbledore looking benevolent in the background and the Magical Brethren off to one side. Harry suddenly wants to throw up.
“No.”
He’s mildly alarmed when she aims her wand at his nose. But then she’s shooting a gentle cooling charm up first one nostril, and then the other one, and he sighs in relief as the pain fades away. He tries to sneak a look at the blond in the corner, and finds him trying–and failing–to hold back a laugh.
“Will you come and help me? You’re welcome to step through the Floo.”
Harry wakes up gasping from the feeling of soaring through sweltering air, with a pair of strong arms clinging to his waist. He stays perfectly still for a few moments, just breathing in the cool air of his bedroom and remembering that he’s safe in his bed, away from fiery monsters and imminent death. Judging by the weak light and muffled street noise seeping through the curtains, it’s early morning. He groans and rolls over, pulling the alarm clock closer and blinking at it, until the numbers come into focus. It’s nearly seven, and they’re meeting Malfoy at nine. He might as well get up.
“Mother really enjoys spending time here. Particularly in summer. She wears dresses with floral patterns and goes shopping at the farmers market.”
"Of course. But not now. It's Friday night, Harry. You should have fun."
Harry presses a hand to his forehead, trying to focus. “Right. So basically we’ve gained nothing.”
“Harry, it’s a Veritaserum statement! You can’t just go up against something like that on a gut feeling.You’ll need real evidence.”
“This part is really interesting. It talks about a ritual to gain the magic back, if someone accidentally touches the cup. I don’t think my father discovered the wording, but there are many allusions to snakes and an ancient form of magic. Of course, that’s not exactly precise, because as you know, there are numerous ancient cultures associated with snakes.”
Draco walks over to the shelves behind the desk. He runs his hand lightly over the books and pulls one out.
Tobby eyes the pile of wet fabric on the floor. He's too polite to actually say anything about it, but the split second look he sends Harry tells him all he needs to know.
He hits the ground almost running, and flushes himself into the atrium, not bothering to close the door to the stall.
Harry has to admit, he’s not too far off the mark. He stops bouncing his leg, and crosses off another box on the long questionnaire he’s working on. There’s no guarantee that Draco will even want to talk to him, he reminds himself. And even if he does, it’s not going to be an easy conversation to have. But just the thought of being able to finally apologise and try to make things better is making him jittery. And sort of nauseated.
“I can teach you the spell, if you want. But it’s rather complicated, so it might take a while. Or I could go with you and cast it. I’m sure Molly won’t mind looking after Rose.”
Love,
“I will never understand you! I knew Ron and Harry were immature, but honestly, Draco. I thought you at least were an adult.” Hermione has her hands on her hips, but the smile she’s sending Ron is brilliant. Her gaze shifts to Harry’s feet, and he feels his toes clench even before she draws her wand. The charm that hits him makes his socks slightly damp for a second, and then his shoes are a lot whiter and less scruffy than they’ve been for years. He wiggles his toes. Urgh. They even feel new and uncomfortable.
“An appointment?” the old wizard squeaks.
“Look, Potter, I might as well say this now. I’m Hermione’s friend now. I know that’s probably not easy to get used to, but believe it or not, I consider myself a fairly decent friend. Therefore, I care about what happens to her husband.”
“How bad is it? What can I do?”
“Yeah. Morning. Nothing good about it,” Ron grumbles.
“Yes.” Blimpy’s ears quiver and she sinks even deeper into the chair.
“Really Ron? He’s right here,” he snaps. “And I’ve hit my leg, not my head. I’m capable of deciding for myself if I need to go to St Mungo’s!” To be honest, he probably does. But he bloody hates that place. Besides, they’re busy. Fuck! The New Dawn knows that they’re on to them now. They’ll have to move fast if they’re going to have any chance at all of getting to the Chalice before it’s hidden even better. And they still don’t know who the “boss” is.
“You’re right. She really doesn’t.” He sinks down into the chair Ron was sitting in before. “I’ll wait out here. Thank you.”
Apparently, Malfoy’s still not pleased to disappoint his father, even after all this time.
Lucius kneels in front of Voldemort and screams in agony as the Cruciatus curse hits him over and over again. Finally, he collapses into unconsciousness. He wakes up in his bed, drinks a pain potion and drags himself to a soft-looking chair in front of the fireplace in the drawing room, where he continues to read about the illusive cup. Then Narcissa bursts through the door, followed by a gang of Snatchers and a small group of prisoners. “They say they’ve got Potter. Draco, come here,” Narcissa says.
Draco grins. “I didn’t. That diagnostic spell is one I use at work. You’ve just been examined the same way I handle ancient burials.”
“Hermione couldn’t perform the spell, because she knows me too well. And I wasn’t going to let a random Unspeakable rummage around in my brain.”
Harry shakes his head. “Not right now, to be honest. But it might, once we get the books sorted and find out if there are any pages missing.”
“You need to move out, mate. She’s treating you like a fucking kid,” Tall Bloke advises.
Ron laughs. “Good one, Malfoy!” He elbows Harry lightly in the ribs. “I can’t believe you actually got pissed on, mate! I can’t wait to tell people at work!”
It is his fault. But she doesn’t need his guilt trip right now, so he bites down on his answer, and just holds her a little tighter. She squeezes him back for a moment, and lets go.
“And nowadays it’s the other way around,” Mr Granger supplies.
“Yeah. I’m the one who called you. Sorry to disrupt your weekend plans, but one of the surveillance charms went off. Kitty Tor.”
“Potter, Weasley, I want you at the crime scene, and I want you visible to the public, going in.  Head over there now. You can get the apparition coordinates from dispatch. Secure the scene and the evidence and report back with a memory for the Pensieve before you do anything else. No heroics, no pursuits, no duelling. Is that clear?”
“What’s important?” Ron looks up from where he’s sitting at the kitchen table with a plate of biscuits and Mr Granger’s laptop.
“I had a little run in with a stone wall. And a Reducto curse,” he adds, when he realises that he still can’t really feel the fingers in his left hand.
Ron has wheeled his chair over to Harry’s desk, and is shooting him worried glances, like he’s afraid he is going to march down to the cells and blow open the door himself.
“Right.” Harry puts his empty mug down, just as Ron comes back.
“The Mark?”
“Harry!” he says jovially, but loud enough that his voice carries. He’s jumped down from the podium in front of the fountain and is winding his way through the gaggle of photographers towards Harry. The cameras turn to him, and the Quick Quotes Quills start quivering in anticipation. Fuck! His shoes are stained with Death Eater piss, and his uniform is not exactly clean. Besides, he’s busy doing actual Auror work. A photo shoot with the Minister is really, really not what he needs right now. Not that that’s going to hold Percy back. He quickly schools his face into an appropriately grave expression and straightens his back.
“Are you still having trouble with the case?”
“John? Doesn’t sound particularly pure-blood to me.”
They scuttle back with offended murmurs, but the shade of Ron’s face doesn’t leave any doubt that he wants to be left alone. And, Squib or not, no one is going to challenge him when he’s wearing that expression.
“Well, isn’t this a cosy place?” Ron mutters.
“Thank you, Auror Potter, Sir.” She blows her bulbous nose and spells the handkerchief clean with a flick of her fingers before handing it back. “They were arguing. The men said to Blimpy’s mistress that she should help them take the magic back from the Mudbloods. But Blimpy’s mistress always said that the men in black robes are plebs and unworthy and they should leave her alone. Mistress said that again to the new men and they killed her.”
Draco goes completely still. Then he smiles. “Yes. Yes, I actually think so. Hermione, you really are the brightest witch of our generation!”
“Yes. Perhaps. I don’t know exactly. The snake is a traditional symbol of Dark magic. Or dangerous knowledge. The cup might be a chalice. A vessel which is used to hold something valuable. Does that help?” Hermione gives them a hopeful look.
Harry grabs Malfoy’s shoulder and pulls, turning him over and looking at… oh bloody fucking hell!
“Weasley, Potter. Welcome to the Stonehenge excavation.” He takes off his glove and holds out a slim hand for them to shake. Harry doesn’t hesitate. This is not the first time he’s held Malfoys hand, after all. A brief flash of a shaking, sweaty palm, desperately grabbing at his hand as fiery monsters dance in the background seeps into his mind, but he quickly banishes the flash back. Malfoy’s hand is cool and surprisingly soft, but the handshake is firm.
Harry looks up at him and… yes. He’s slim, lightly toned and well dressed. If Harry had been with enough blokes to have a type, this would be it. The man smiles at him, revealing straight, white teeth.
There’s a fire glowing in the ornate, marble fireplace, casting a warm orange glow on the muted gleaming dark wood and the floor to ceiling bookshelves covering three walls. Speaking of gleaming things... Harry glances at Hermione and, sure enough, she has that hungry gleam in her eyes that she always seems to get around books that she hasn’t read yet. She looks at Draco, and when he nods and sends her a small smile, she runs her hand admiringly over the spines of leather bound tomes, and traces the golden letters in one of the titles with a fingertip.
Adam places their order of beer and slips onto Hermione’s abandoned stool.
“Mother will probably congratulate me on having three Order of Merlin recipients and aspiring Ministry employees as my guests,” Draco answers. “Weasley, I hope you’ll excuse my uncle. He hasn’t really kept up with the times. Understandably enough, since he's been dead for half a century.”
And that’s…almost noble. And overbearing as fuck. Also a bit daft, since Hermione is really good at breaking curses. On the other hand, she’s not a trained Auror, and she’s got more than enough to think about right now.
“By ‘me’, she means Ron,” Harry adds helpfully.
“What do you think, Malfoy?” Ron asks.
“Right. So they’re neo Death Eaters?” There’s a vein pulsing in Ron’s temple.
Davies is winding his way through the labyrinth of desks. Harry stops to wait for him.
Harry looks in the direction of the voice, and finally sees Malfoy. Or, part of him, at least, because Malfoy is kneeling with his back turned towards them. One arm is stretched out in front of him for support, and in the other, he’s holding a small trowel. He’s leaning down to look at something on the ground, which means that his very firm arse is showcased nicely inside heavy khaki trousers. Harry’s mouth suddenly goes dry, and he doesn’t quite know where to look. Luckily, Malfoy pushes smoothly to his feet and comes to greet them.
A flash of a flooded bathroom. The water on the floor turning red. Harry can’t help the slightly hysterical bark of laughter that escapes him, despite nothing being even remotely funny.
Ginny punches George in the arm, but she’s smirking at Ron and her eyes are gleaming dangerously.
“Who? Borgin and Burkes?”
“Erm… No? No! I just meant… Inviting Malfoy here is maybe a bit… erm...”
“And he got it in the middle of a Cabinet meeting,” George adds, his voice quivering with held back laughter.
Fuck. He really doesn’t want to talk to Malfoy. He especially doesn’t want to talk to him about how Ron lost his magic because Harry thought Malfoy was still a Death Eater.
"You did it."
“Yes. You know… just in case…”
“Jones, Williamson, you’re on observation duty. I want you to organise eyes on all residences of former Death Eaters as well as any suspected sympathisers. Get DMLE involved, and you have my permission to talk with the Department of Mysteries if you need more substantial surveillance charms in place.”
“Thank you for letting us use it,” Hermione says.
He picks up the letter and turns it over in his hand, feeling the soft but textured paper against his skin. His heart does an odd sort of skip-beat, when he sees the Malfoy crest on the back of the envelope. He turns it back over. It’s addressed to ‘Auror Harry Potter, Order of Merlin, First Class’. What the fuck? The handwriting is elegant, curvy and a bit old fashioned. And not Draco’s. He puts the envelope back down and gets his wand from the bedside table. He casts a few charms on it, and it glows a warm sunny yellow. Not cursed then. At least not in a way he can detect. He probably shouldn’t open it, just in case, but… it seems harmless enough. He carefully slides a finger under the paper and takes out the single sheet of heavy stationary.
"What I did?"
They are handed an old bottle cap and a used bus ticket, before they’re allowed to enter the building.
Draco nods, but he doesn’t make room for Harry to step around him. He just stands there, staring at his face. At his eyes and–oh God–his mouth?
The door closes behind them, but before he can turn to Disapparate, Ron grabs his arm.
“Now, go and dance! That blond bloke over there has been staring at your arse since you walked in.”
“But this could be anything!” Harry takes it from her and snaps it shut. Ron has already conjured an evidence bag. “We’ll have a look at it back at the ministry.”
“But I want you to see it!” Harry blurts. Fuck. The last thing Ron needs is him whining.
The last button is finally undone, and the cuff loosens. Draco peels it away slowly, but still manages to take a sliver of burned skin with him. A hiss escapes through Harry's clenched teeth. Draco looks up at him, grey eyes intense with something that Harry can't really define.
Hermione is biting her lip in that way she has. The one that means that Harry isn’t going to like what she’s about to say. “I talked to Draco and he said we could use his. We’re expected at Malfoy Manor at eight.”
“Well, given that your best friend is more or less a Squib at the moment, I’d think the most important question is how to get his magic back.”
He hopes it will, at least. It’s been too long since they’ve been out together, all three of them. The last time must have been at the beginning of February, when Hermione got promoted to do whatever it is that she does as an Unspeakable, which means that he has been doing practically nothing but working for almost three weeks.
“Yeah. Davies said she’s in the bedroom, same as her brother.”
“How is he?”
“Auror Potter!”
“Come on, Malfoy. There’s a pub in the next town over. Let me at least apparate you there and buy you a glass of Ogden’s Old. You look like you could use it.”
Getting into Azkaban is almost as difficult as getting out, Harry thinks. In theory, he has access because of his job, but, in reality, he still has to get Savage’s permission, in writing, which means slaving for hours over how to word the scroll. When he finally gets summoned to her office, just before tea time, he still has to spend almost fifteen minutes convincing her that it’s a good idea. And then he has to sign a three foot long scroll of parchment detailing everything about the visit, and wait for everything to be confirmed with the prison guards. Insisting on bringing someone along doesn’t exactly help. Especially when that someone’s name is Draco Malfoy.
“I hope you’ll excuse the mess,” he says. “This doubles as our lunch room and the assistants seem to be completely unable to keep horizontal surfaces free of clutter. And we can’t use magic, because it interferes with the traces of ancient spellwork on the artefacts.”
“Yeah. The young one with the trousers around his ankles. Remember? That potion smuggling case where Donovan nearly ruined our cover?”
Then it disappears. He can feel it rush past him and towards Draco. The air shimmers and twists, and a curl of dark smoke rises towards the high ceiling. Then nothing. The absence of magic feels like a breath of cool, clean air on a hot summer day. Harry lowers his wand.
Savage casts a drying charm on the scroll she was signing when they came in, rolls it up and holds it out for Harry to take.
Ron doesn’t get as far as the bar before there’s a sudden drop in volume in the room. At the same time, Harry feels the buzzing of the alarm on his ID badge. He pulls it out of his pocket, just like every other Auror in the room, and when he sees the faint red glow surrounding the previously dull brass, he turns on the spot, with the loud pops of his colleagues’ Disapparation ringing in his ears.
“Look, I know Percy is a class A idiot, but he’s still the Minister. He’s our boss,” Harry whispers.
“Whatever those charges are, I didn’t do anything. You believe that, don’t you?”
A part of him wants to ask Draco not to go at all, or to take him back to Malfoy Manor and the soft armchair in front of the fire in his study. He shakes his head. “I’ll be fine.”
“Mr. Malfoy? Your guests are here.”
“Fuck!” Ron shouts.
Hermione starts making her way to the toilets, but Harry isn’t alone for long.
Ron grins.  “We could ask. It’s still fact checking, even if we’re not doing it at our desks.”
I hope you got back safely last night. Ron is much better today. There is no sign of his magic returning, but he is very hopeful and in good spirits. St. Mungo’s can’t really do anything, so they are releasing him today. I’m taking him home this afternoon.
The thought that Draco has been worried about him is enough to make his heart skip and his face soften. “I had to,” he says. “The alarm went off. But I’ve got loads of new information.”
“Yeah. Scara Brae. You coming, Jamie?”
“Yes.” Malfoy shakes his head and his gaze locks with Harry’s. “Yes, I think it’s real. The only problem is that it hasn’t been seen for centuries. The Dark Lord was looking for it, at some point. I don’t think he got very far.” He’s frowning again. “I think my father helped him investigate, actually.”
“It’s good to see you too,” he murmurs into her hair. "How's Mysteries?"
He nods and sinks deeper into his chair, hating that he’s so fucking transparent in front of a suspect, and with Savage standing right outside, but grateful for having Ron as his partner. The ice is beginning to make him feel almost numb, and he listens with a sort of detachment, as Ron picks up his line of questioning.
“You’re right, Malfoy,” Harry says. He grits his teeth. “I’m sorry."
They fly in silence for a long time. They’re almost at the channel, when Draco steers his broom closer and shouts over the wind.
“Uncle Harry!”
Fucking hell! He really needs that Firewhiskey. Or a swift memory charm. Perhaps Hermione will help him. She's pretty good at Oblivating people. No. She probably wouldn't react too well to that suggestion, even if he was insensitive enough to make it.
“Yeah, I know.” Ron crosses his arms and kicks at the carpet. “I still wish I could tell Mum,” he mutters under his breath.
She hands over her glass of ice water and a napkin. “Well he has…”
“Mother wrote you a letter? Oh God!” Draco sounds absolutely mortified.
“Stop trying to Divine what she’s doing from the patterns in your beer foam, mate! Hermione’s brilliant. She’s been able to handle Malfoy since third year, remember?”
“I believe you, Blimpy.”
Hermione puts her arm around him.
“It is.”
“A bit ironic, isn’t it? Considering all the petty crime.” Ron waves a stack of what looks like Wizengamot transcripts. “This is mostly just Quidditch brawls, but there are a few cases of theft and possession of illegal potions.”
The hot water runs down his back, drumming against his skin and relieving the tension from his exhausting day. It makes the tiny cuts on his hands sting, but he really doesn’t care. It’s a small price to pay for the luxury of washing the grime away. He closes his eyes again, and imagines the small river of hot water trailing down his spine is Draco’s tongue. He grabs his cock and groans at the feeling of the hot water and the pressure from his fist, as he strokes himself. Images of Draco flash behind his closed eyelids. Draco pressing him back into the cushions and holding him there, taking what he needed and pushing it all back into Harry with his body and his words. Draco gasping and shuddering above him, coming with his arse clamped around his cock. Draco letting him hold him after, when they were both tired and spent. He gasps Draco’s name as he comes.
“You haven’t heard?” Ron asks between chortles.
“Ready?” Ron asks.
He watches in horror, as the curse grazes Draco’s leg, slicing clean through his trousers and into his flesh.
Hermione shoots them that look. The one that means they’re missing something really, really obvious.
The glare Draco’s been leveling at him melts into something much softer, and Harry has to remind himself that this is a really, really bad time to grab him and kiss him senseless. He settles for a quick peck on the lips, and kicks the door open.
Ron nods.
Draco shakes his head. His lips curl up in a tiny smile, and he looks at Harry through half lidded eyes. “I meant that it’s inviting. It’s got a certain warmth to it,” he says.
“What are you, twelve?” Tornadoes Shirt sneers.
Dinner is a quiet affair. Ron keeps reaching for his wand. To set the table. To clean up when Rosie knocks her glass over. To send the dishes back to the sink. Hermione’s clearly noticed too, because she seems to be developing duelling-speed reactions to everything that might require a spot of magic. By the time they’ve finished their pudding, Ron is silently fuming, Hermione is biting her lip nervously, and Harry is busy entertaining Rose, trying to keep her from noticing her parents glaring at each other.
“Because this room is about to become a veritable paper blizzard.”
"How's the case going? The sooner you solve it, the sooner you'll have the time for that date." Her smile is so excited, he decides that discussing it isn't really worth the fuss. Instead he signals for the bartender to bring him an Ogden’s.
Malfoy’s office is nothing like Harry has imagined. It’s a room in a converted workers shed, with shelves along one wall, and a large table. A Muggle laptop is in the corner, almost covered by rolled up sheets of drafting film.
“Do you have time to view it with me? Ron said you were going to pick up Rose...”
“Aren’t we forgetting something here?” Draco adds in a much louder voice.
“Why are you here?”
They cast the spells on each other and grab hold of the bottlecap that Ron has unwrapped from his handkerchief. The familiar tug behind the navel comes immediately, and when they land, they’re at the bottom of a steep grassy hill, strewn with rocks.
“CSI! I saw it on the telly when we were visiting Hermione’s parents at Christmas. It means Crime Scene Investigators. It’s brilliant!”
“Thanks, Hermione,” he says.
Harry sends Ron a smile that’s only a little bit forced. “Yeah, yeah. See you tomorrow.”
He finds a newer pair of jeans and a dark green wooly jumper. Then he rummages through the bathroom cabinet. He thinks he's seen... Yes. There it is. The hair potion Philippe bought for him over a year ago. He breaks the seal on the bottle and wets his fingers. Then he runs them through his hair, before examining the result in the mirror. It still looks a bit messy. But more in a windswept sort of way, and less like he's been struck by lightning.
One of the MLE officers, Jenkins, comes towards them at a jog. He’s broad and has a very impressive moustache that reminds Harry of Horace Slughorn.
Ron is frowning at him. He makes that slightly constipated face that makes Harry hear sixteen-year-old Hermione’s voice in his head, lamenting the fact that boys have the emotional range of a teaspoon.
Harry grabs a fresh memo-plane from the stack on his desk and jots down a quick message. Then he returns to the transcript he’s been looking at. There has to be some sort of clue there,some hint about who would murder an old pureblood wizard who’d fallen on hard times.
“I’ll be right back,” Draco says, and heads for fireplace.
Savage is signing a pile of paperwork so high, it makes Harry feel a tiny twinge of guilt at his previous whining. She looks up and puts her quill back into the holder on the ornate inkwell.
Despite the circumstances, Harry finds his lips curling up in a small smile. “Come on, Draco! It’s not that bad. She didn’t write anything embarrassing. Just that she knew we are… what was it? Oh yes, ‘on friendly terms these days,’ and that she hoped I’d be able to help you.”
"Potter and I were hoping you'd tell us about the Chalice you used to research."
dark wizard. He has no proper lineage upon which to draw his knowledge from, so he must rely on us for it. Worse yet, we let him,” he said, growing more irate the longer he spoke. “The Gaunts may be an old family, but they certainly are not a respected one. No shame in their deviant behaviors, nor in their ignorance of the old ways. Who knows what happened to their family grimoires. He may be the Dark Lord, but he does not have the
. You knew all along! What were you going to tell people when it finally happened?”
sarcastic suggestion, Potter. How about you ask the person living there for the address? Or a location close by you're familiar enough with in order to apparate there without splinching yourself.”
His sole refuge was his mind. Occlumency allowed him to retreat into himself and look on with dispassion. If the mind could be anything, then his was a labyrinth: compressed into a series of interlocking passages that caged the seething resentment burning darkly within him. He could not show his discontent, his doubt. The others were ruled by emotion, not reason; ingratiating themselves to a man whose heritage they purported to despise. There was no order to their cause, and it had become apparent to him that reinstating pureblood supremacy was merely a convenient smokescreen to mask the Dark Lord’s grasp for power. But Draco was not strong enough to oppose them, so he would continue to play the coward and the fool, even if he had to watch his parents be degraded, his aunt prostrate herself before a half-blood, and was forced to torture muggles or dissenters day after day. He would say nothing, because there was nothing to be done.
“The Malfoy women, Auror Potter. Narcissa was pronounced dead at the scene—savaged by Greyback, according to the on-site Mediwizards—and Astoria died while at St. Mungo’s. Mr. Malfoy and his son are in recovery, but their injuries are severe,” Wickham finished. “It might be several hours yet until they can speak. Until then, the floo at the manor has been opened for us to access.”
“He was bitten. My—my
“We don’t need two hostages, you bloody fucking imbecile. Put her back!” Draco yell-whispered.
Harry approached Malfoy’s bed. He was inspecting the Healers’ work critically, and his hands twitched like he yearned to wrest Scorpius from them and take him into his arms. In this light, his eyes were cold and clear, like metal. He’d become even more sharp-edged in the years since Hogwarts. Harry had not seen him since the last attack. That was eight years ago. Now where he’d once been thin and underfed, Malfoy was as tall and broad-shouldered as his father had been. Perhaps he would have even been handsome, if not for the scars.
Nothing more was said until they reached the hospital wing. Potter kicked open the door and half-dragged, half-carried Draco inside.
“I don’t find this funny at all,” Potter said, voice raw with honesty. He ran a hand through his hair, mussing it further. The smell of mint still clung to him, beneath the gore and sick. Damnable half-breed senses. It almost recalled something of the dream, but what it was he couldn’t say.
“It was wrong what they did to you, Harry,” he’d said suddenly, fiercely. “More than that, even. It was abuse. I know—I looked it up.”
“Why not let Voldemort in? He’d have rewarded you for it, surely; then you’d still have your family, and your—”
Potter waited to approach him until a week after his mother’s death. Draco had spent most of his paycheck on the funeral, which was not much; it had been a somber, solitary affair besides, and nothing like what Narcissa deserved. He would have asked Potter to inter her body in the Black Mausoleum, but he knew her well enough not damage her pride by doing so. She had never been one to beg for anything. Instead he settled for a pauper’s funeral: an unmarked grave in a dodgy little plot of land behind a cottage that had seen better days. At least it was in Wiltshire. There was no epitaph or gravestone, but he’d planted a bed of lilies in the freshly-tilled earth, so that her death would in time produce something beautiful. The only other attendees were Potter, Aunt Andromeda, and a young man with unruly turquoise hair. Nothing was said between them. Draco didn’t cry.
Her eyes grew sad. “Alright, Harry,” she said after a moment, holding him tighter. “I’ll discipline them until you’re ready. If I ever catch you doing anything of the sort again, you’ll be sleeping at Grimmauld Place for a fortnight.”
“Likewise, you mad cunt,” Draco sneered. “Say you do off her, then I’d just kill you regardless. No trial, no dementors. I daresay I’d even enjoy it.”
Draco had never given much thought to his sexuality. He’d been in love with Pansy in school and had intended to marry her. He hadn’t minded that she was snub-nosed and a little spotty, or that there was often a shrill note to her voice. He’d loved her regardless. But in the ensuing fallout of the war, he had broken off their engagement. No money, no prospects, and an impeding incarceration in Azkaban—if he really cared about Pansy, how could he drag her into that? She’d been furious with him, and in a startling moment of bravery, had claimed she didn’t care. That she’d stay with him anyways. It was a nice dream. But Draco had known better, and said to her, “You will care, and you will hate me for it. I’d rather us part as friends now, than lose what we have forever.”
“Anytime, Mr. Malfoy.”
“Yeah. Another pint for me, and a shot of firewhiskey for this one,” Potter said, clapping Draco on the back. Potter was leering at the woman a bit now, but she didn’t seem to mind. The cheeky bird even winked at him as she sauntered over to the taps.
He had been running with Ron through the tunnels of the muggle underground, Ron
And Harry jumped with them.
"Shit! Sorry, sorry..." but it was already ruined, and Draco wouldn't look at Harry again even as he wrapped bandages around Harry's thigh and hip. The gesture was so intimate that Harry thought that he may just pass away, especially when Draco's hands brushed against him sending jolts of electricity. When Harry was wrapped up, his pants and trousers pulled up by Draco, he realized that he needed to leave. Draco had already done enough for him, and Harry couldn't ask anything more because Draco was already everything Harry was asking. Except his.
The taller one shrugged dismissively, spinning the shorter one despite of the following protests. "Pureblood thing, I guess. Like you and quidditch. Runs in the genes." He grinned, and the other boy's steps faltered, his eyes gazing the taller one with a lovestruck face. They ended up on the floor in a mess when their legs tangled together, the taller one cursing.
Harry is again knocking on Draco's door, but this time he's not asking for Draco to heal his wounds. Well, wounds yes, but not bleeding ones.
Was she disappointed? No.
Harry could see Draco's Adam's apple bobbing as he applied the same cream as earlier. "You're splinched."
comes down. So yeah. Bye!" He shouts as the door closes with a bang.
"Shit. Shit. Shit.
"Grandma took me to get coffee one day in a muggle cafe. She works there."
Draco pulled him in and while they were wrangling in their sheets, a Jack Russell Terrier appeared next to them, Ron's voice booming in the background: "
"Please, as if you weren't practically begging for it." Draco scoffed, pointedly looking at Harry. "Even Weasley seemed to know it."
"My magic?" Harry smirked as he took Draco's hand in his own. Everything was finally going to be alright.
And now he was here, due to a poor consideration and a lack of fucking thinking about things first.
It did. And Draco didn't say anything.
I'm so happy that I finally got this published! Also, thank you to those who asked for a second part, forever glad that someone reads these <3
"Pretty?" Harry bristles, winking at his godson. "Where did you meet her?"
"But wait! You need to stay so you can eat soup with us!" Harry shouts after him, and Teddy puts his shoes on.
"Look, uh... Bloody hell, I thought I could save this for Hermione," Ron dragged his hands across his face and rubbed his temples. He looked a bit uncomfortable. Harry blinked. "Uhm, okay. So. Look," Ron started very confidently, "I'm not quite sure uh... about what's causing this, but if you might have something to tell me then I guess... erㅡ You know what? I'm not doing this." Ron stood up with his curry container, and set an envelope on Harry's desk. "Just bring that to Malfoy."
Pansy just turned her back on them, and if Snape caught them in the middle of the hallway the next morning, she didn't know anything.
"No, you have to step on the left."
Harry elbowed him. "So you weren't even getting engaged!" Harry faked hurt. He knew the truth.
And then,
Harry threw himself on Draco, not knowing whether to punch him or kiss him. Maybe the latter, though.
Harry wanted to tell Draco he loved him, the words he had never said because he had been too afraid. But now, chased by the biggest git of the Great Britain, those words felt so small, like a comfort, rather than something big and exciting and new. They felt like home, one that Harry had never had.
The pang about the engagement ring was still pounding in the back of Harry's head, but he decided that it could wait for later. He knew that Draco wasn't getting engaged, except maybe to Harry in the future. Everything else could wait. It was now just Harry and Draco and their lips and limbs. Draco was warm, like home, and the way he was smiling at Harry made his heart do a couple cartwheels. He looked thoroughly kissed, and then he was pulling his coat and scarf on. "You know, I've always found your magic hot."
"Basic pureblood policyㅡ ow!" the taller one's words were interrupted by the shorter one's misstep on his foot, and Pansy recognized a scowl directed at the shorter one, followed by an apology. They continued to move, legs swinging and bodies swaying, their hands pulling them closer together. "Mother made me take lessons when I was younger. I actually never went to them. Or I went, but the inㅡ onstruㅡ intro..."
Draco would say, grinning.
It had been another two months.
"Yeah," Harry says, eyes glinting at Draco, "How much of that did you hear, by the way?"
'N-No...'
Fucking hell, Ron might know more than what he had led on.
Ron laid a gentle hand on Harry's shoulder, squeezing just enough for Harry to come back to reality, and wipe his tears. "It'll be alright, mate. It'll be."
Draco could be very loving when he wanted to, and Harry loved the way Draco loved. It didn't mean a lot of meaningful words nor romantic gestures, but it meant all the little things. The way his thumb would circle on Harry's palm when Harry was nervous, the way Draco's feet tucked under Harry's thigh when he was cold, the way Draco had always a sandwich with him, ready to be given to Harry when Harry's quidditch practice ended. Or the way his hands would always pull Harry to bed with him when Harry would fall asleep on his History of Magic essay, or the way Draco would always help with said essays.
Draco was so close to him, but the moment was broken as the bottle containing the cream dropped on Harry's wound, making him wail.
Harry jumped awake from his daze, and started to un-button his auror robes with shaky hands. He could feel Draco's piercing gaze on him, and Harry tried not to get flustered when Draco gently grabbed his hands and moved them away, continuing Harry's work. Harry could still remember how Draco's hands had felt on his skin, how Draco's breath had tickled his neck the morning after.
Harry put the scarf away, not wanting to get intoxicated by the scent ㅡ or worse, getting caught sniffing it. Harry looked at Draco's desk drawers, and opened the one which said
They hadn't talked in two months, not after they had been pleads and moans and bliss in Draco's bed after getting drunk in a shaggy muggle bar.
," a slight moan of pain, although Pansy knew that they were fine. When you were drunk, there always seemed to be an invisible barrier so you couldn't get hurt. Or at least, you wouldn't feel the pain.
"Not going to make a difference, is it?"
"I am."
Harry wanted to reply something snarky, but when Draco started to undo his zipper all retorts vanished. Instead, he stuttered; "Whatㅡ What are you doing?"
he would answer, and Harry would laugh, the laugh that made Draco's face melt and his fingers to wrap around Harry's.
"How did you know that you were in love with Uncle Draco?"
Harry was laying on the bed with Draco, body slick with sweat and other things. Their legs were intertwined, and Harry's head was on Draco's chest so that he could still feel the rapid rise of his chest. Harry played with Draco's fingers while Draco's other hand caressed his hair, smoothing it backwards.
"And what if I am?" The statement hit Harry like a train.
"Why the engagement ring?" Harry asked, finally when he had the courage to.
"Potter? Whatㅡ"
But Harry had to say goodbye. He had to. "I'll be going now, I'll seeㅡ Er, thanks. You didn't have to."
Maybe Harry should take some tips from that, really. It seemed working just fine.
Harry nods. He stirs the pot again. "It took me a whole while to realise that I was in love with Draco."
Was she excited that now she could rub this all over Draco tomorrow morning, listen to him whining that it was too damn early for it? Yes.
Not after Harry had realized that he was in love with the git.
Harry turned around, ready to leave. He waited for a moment, he heard nothing, and let the flicker of hope burn out.
The woman who got that ring was going to be lucky. But Harry knew that she wouldn't ever enjoy the fact that she had Draco as her own more than Harry would. Nobody could do that.
At that Draco shot Harry a sharp look, but once Draco looked in his eyes, Harry couldn't have his eyes again somewhere else. He grabbed Draco's chin with his finger, lifting it up. Draco was so beautiful. "Harry..." he was so close, and Harry was nailed in his place. His brain racked through the times he had wanted Draco's eyes on him but hadn't gotten it, and now when he finally had it, Harry wanted to keep it. To have Draco all to himself.
"Uncle Harry?"
During the apparition Harry had successfully pulled the other Death Eater in a spin with him, resulting in splinching the Death Eater, but also himself. Then there had been three more of them, four to fight, and Harry's mind had been in a whirl. It was lucky that he'd even had the concentration to apparate away. But then, he didn't even want to think about how Draco's address had been the first one to come to mind.
. That's none of your business, is it?" Draco's voice was nasty. But he was right. It was none of Harry's business.
Harry couldn't do anything. He just stared at Draco and complied at Draco's whisper to lift his hips. Draco pulled Harry's trousers and pants lower, and then he was looking at Harry's freckled hip. One that Draco had just months before thrust against, left his fingerprints there. Only if removing Draco's fingerprints from Harry's heart had been as easy as removing them from his thighs.
"Harry, we can't stay here. We have toㅡ" the shorter boy ㅡ Harry ㅡ looked at the taller, blinking. The taller one blushed. "Shit. Stop looking at me like that. I can't finish my sentences when you look at me like that."
