"What does that mean?" he asked, sitting. He crossed one knee over the other, interested in the details of Potter's investigation despite himself. The closest thing to danger he got these days were brawls in the common rooms, or someone doing Flitwick's Daily Prophet crossword before he'd had the chance.
His voice sounding more alien and unrecognisable by the moment, the goblin said, "I have no further information on this matter."
Harry sighed. "If it's not one thing… " He raised his voice. "James! Stop that!" Or better yet - he drew his wand, aimed subtly and said, "Finite." His son found himself on solid ground.
Harry turned around to stare at him on his way out. "What?"
"They're all fine, too," Tonks said. "Tell you the truth, the only person in my family - if you can call it that - who isn't fine is Draco."
Harry looked around and Disapparated again. The Ministry was bustling, as always, and it felt almost surreal to Harry. His personal life was in tatters and the world was just going on the way it always had. He wanted to see Malfoy rather desperately, just to make sure things were still okay, despite his having left without a word that morning. Why had Malfoy left? What was he thinking? Harry felt uneasy. Perhaps he should go to Malfoy's office and see if he was there. Maybe that would be too intrusive, especially if Malfoy had left the flat because he was trying to avoid Harry. Was he angry at Harry for leaving? Harry reached the lifts and made a split-second decision. He pressed the button for the seventh floor and got off with a few other people. Harry made his way down the corridor and hoped he wouldn't see anyone he knew. He'd only been to Malfoy's office after hours before, when most people were gone.
"Just sex," Malfoy said, watching him closely.
"It wouldn't matter, anyway," Draco said, the candlelight making the hollows of his cheeks seem even more pronounced. "It would just be the last nail in the coffin of everything they hoped and dreamed for the Malfoy heir. The perfect little Death Eater, married to a perfect little Death Eater wife, producing children - sons, of course - and carrying on the pureblood Malfoy line with pride and grace."
"Around nine?" Malfoy moved then, examining himself in the mirror and straightening an invisible wisp of hair. "By the way, you still have my book. And I see you didn't read it."
"Unfortunately, yes. Nothing exciting, just a meeting with my solicitor."
It was dark, though the moon added some illumination through the window. Malfoy was sleeping, his breathing slow and regular. Harry dropped his filthy clothes in a pile near the door and chose a bedroll several feet away from Malfoy's. It was not a large room, and Harry was reluctant to sleep too close to the door. It was supposed to be a safehouse, certainly, but Grimmauld Place was supposed to have been impregnable, too. He crawled into a bedroll nude and was asleep within seconds.
Draco looked. In the shadows at the far end of the hall he could just make out a figure seated. A student? He left Lucius without a backward look and uttered a silent prayer to any gods there might be that he wouldn't follow, and went to investigate. As he drew closer, he saw that it was indeed a student, an older one, perhaps fifth or sixth year. He sat with his knees drawn up to his chest, back to Draco. Draco unconsciously found himself moving faster. "Hello," he called, voice sharp. "Who is that? What are you doing out of your house?"
"She's young," Draco said, still reading. "And it pays to be patient."
"Not really." Harry tried to deny it. "I'm just… I don't usually even think about them much. I tried to forget all that once I never had to go back there again. I was trying to blot out all memory of it with my wizarding family and my strictly magical lifestyle. I don't know. Something about it makes me feel like I'm a kid again and stuck there, with them."
Harry watched her carefully. "You're angry."
"What is that?"
"Why should you have? I'm very good at what I do," Malfoy said. There was a slight smirk on his face, and he added under his breath, "And apparently, so are you."
"Only staff person I have left," Malfoy said.
He'd already showered, but then, it didn't usually take much to persuade him. Shower sex with Harry tended to be spectacular. "All right."
"Try hard. That's the last thing I need."
From the sofa, Malfoy looked up, wry awareness in his eyes. "You going down there?"
Harry sighed. "What?"
Harry paused. "You're a terrible liar," he said softly. Knowing that Draco would have found it highly insulting at one point.
Malfoy laughed at this. "Good try." He took Harry's glass from him and set it on the coffee table, next to his own. He moved closer to Harry and Harry nearly panicked.
Harry let him go reluctantly, watched him walk to the door. When Malfoy got there, he stopped and looked back. "Coming?"
"You certainly may," Harry said. He walked over and accepted a heavy cut-glass tumbler of firewhiskey and waited for Malfoy to give the next cue. Malfoy replaced the cap on the bottle and carried his own glass over to the island separating the kitchen from the living room. Harry followed and pulled out a stool at the corner. Malfoy chose to sit opposite him. "Thanks," Harry said, gesturing with his glass.
"I've never seen you in action before, as it were," Harry said, and immediately regretted his choice of words.
Malfoy smiled. "You liked the disguise, then?"
The evaluation was over. Harry and Malfoy had both received very high marks (despite Harry's protestations that he'd done nothing the entire month). They had been observed in several restaurants, bars, and shops, and the supervisors had been very pleased with Malfoy's successful three-week stint in disguise, as well as with Harry's newfound willingness to take a back seat. Now people were filtering out, discussing plans for the two-week break before the next section began, and Harry located Ginny and steered her out. They began to walk, looking for a café. Harry didn't want to start until they were seated and could talk about it properly, which he was looking forward to about as much as root canal work, but it had to be done. Ginny seemed to share his feeling and they walked in tense silence.
Potter spoke slowly and clearly. "I've been trying to tell you that I'm - that I'm interested in having more than a friendship with you. I'm attracted to you. I'm sorry, but I am. And you're probably straight and not at all interested that way. I mean, we've barely started being friends, so for me to suddenly - "
Lucius' smirk deepened; his left arm extended, pointing Draco down the hall. "See for yourself."
Potter went on, glancing at Draco. "I said you come straight to me. Patronus first, then you. If you see him again, get the hell away from the canvas!"
"No clue. Did you do all the usual things?"
"The media and therefore every wizard and witch in the world," Malfoy filled in for him. "Understandable. Seems they're on your trail, though. They're always on about 'Harry Potter's suspect singledom' and so forth. How you're probably too unhinged to handle relationships and therefore queer."
Malfoy yielded without a fight. "I suppose you can get yourself off the floor then, too."
After breakfast, Harry got up to do the dishes. Malfoy had remained steadfastly silent except when spoken to throughout, but had equally silently made toast and put things like jam and butter and milk out on the table for them, so Harry thought he would do the dishes. Malfoy was standing at the sink, already running the water. Neville said something about showering and disappeared upstairs. Seamus took the month-old Prophet to the next room to erase Malfoy's answers to the crossword.
This was surprising and yet not at the same time. Harry pressed himself forward, felt the tight ring of muscle grip at the head of his cock. Malfoy hissed a breath, sucking it in, his fingernails white where they clutched the undersides of his thighs. Harry pushed in another inch or so, and it felt so good, so good. Malfoy's eyes closed tightly, teeth clenched in a grimace and he turned his head to the side. Half-buried in Malfoy, Harry made himself stop. Speech at this point was difficult. "Uh - are you - "
"This is all pretty new for you, isn't it?" Malfoy shifted and put his legs over Harry's.
"Sure. You're curious. And you want to kiss me again." Malfoy's voice was at its usual range, but it sounded no less attractive for that.
Harry bit back a sharp retort concerning his sex drive that he would have instantly regretted. Instead he said, "Maybe that's just one of the problems with marrying the Boy-Who-Lived."
"When you hit my prostate like that, I can't be held responsible for the sounds I make. You should know that by now." Malfoy delivered this very calmly, but one of his hands moved to cover Harry's, fingers pushing between his.
Harry yawned. "Well, I'm glad this is happening."
"I mean, here we are, getting to be friends," Potter said. "And I go and fuck it up like that. I probably made you completely uncomfortable and I'm really sorry. I just realised it had gone too far last time and should either explain myself and be up front with you or else stop trying to pretend this is something it isn't."
"A month?" Harry repeated, looking down at the parchment again. He hadn't caught that part. "That's a long time."
Draco ended the spell and began leafing through his other letters. Ten minutes later a short ping warned him that Cynthia was about to speak again.
"Bring your stuff over here," Malfoy ordered. He sat up and patted the sofa beside himself. "And bring me a quill, will you?"
"Yes. I bought a new shirt and a new lampshade for that awful thing of Ron's. Why did you keep that, anyway?"
"Shut up, you."
Harry shrugged. "I got your note," he said. "I just thought I'd… see how you're doing today."
* * *
"Why not, exactly?" Malfoy was leaning forward again, his proximity close enough that Harry could feel the heat of his face on his own. "Don't give me the work crap, Potter. We both know that this is a temporary assignment, and after this we go our separate ways. That particular line doesn't cut it."
"Being checked out, obviously," Malfoy said dryly. "Particularly by my sort."
"Nothing, Potter. Go home to your wife."
"Stick close," he instructed. "If I got us to the right place, there's a monastery we can stay in."

The dark suction was instant; dark was all around him. It felt tighter than Apparition normally felt, and just when he thought it would never end, the golden key suddenly burned against his palm and he heard a click as of a door unlocking. There was a push and suddenly he knew he was through. He blinked. It was still very dark.
Potter hesitated. "I also heard you were, erm…"
"That has nothing to do with anything."
"Vault 849. Mid-level," Malfoy called back.
Harry looked down at himself in surprise. "Is it? I've had this forever." It was just an old, long-sleeved black shirt that he often wore on the weekend. It was a little too small, though, and fit rather tightly. He wasn't sure what the appeal was. "Uh, thanks. I like your ensemble, too. Much classier."
The look nearly undid him - Malfoy's unmasked awareness of the state Harry was in. The very openness of the unspoken knowledge caused something in the pit of Harry's belly to thrill, his hands tightening in anticipation. Malfoy's thighs were quivering, his cock flushed dark in his white-knuckled hand. He was breathing harder. Harry sensed that he was getting close, almost ready to come. He pulled at his balls with his other hand, forgetting that he wasn't going to do that in front of Malfoy. Malfoy dragged his eyes up, off Harry's balls to his face and pushed himself off the wall. He was in Harry's face, his thighs pinning Harry's back against his own wall, his fingers brushing Harry's as they both rubbed faster still. Neither of them said a word, though there were certainly unformed words trying to organise themselves in Harry's lust-addled head at this. He should protest. He should push Malfoy away. Say that it had already gone too far and then find a way out of this mess. Malfoy closed his eyes and moaned through clenched teeth. It sounded terribly loud to Harry, but there was no time to think about this. Malfoy opened his eyes again and looked down between them. Steel-like fingers pried Harry's off his cock and just as quickly replaced them, Malfoy's cock rubbing alongside Harry's in his fist. Harry almost panicked now. He made to pull away, but there was nowhere to go, and the sensation of Malfoy's cock actually touching his felt so dreadfully, achingly good that he was rendered speechless. Malfoy's gaze locked to Harry's and his other hand took Harry's and placed it firmly around his so that both their hands were holding both cocks. Held in place, Harry found he didn't even want to move, not at this very second, though somewhere in the back of his head he knew that he should be running for the hills right now. Should have run several minutes ago, but it was far too late now. He thrust violently against Malfoy, coming and coming and gasping incoherently, the pleasure so overwhelmingly good that he could barely breathe. A second later, still reeling from his orgasm, there was another burst of hot fluid, followed by another and another as Malfoy came on him, and fuck if that didn't make something low in his belly ache with something he had no name for, too.
Harry searched his memory. "Largest collection of intact Roman ruins around?"
"Who Confunds goblins and steals information from their brains."
Draco had to smile, reminded of Scorpius' endless, pestering questions at times. "Well. I see." He picked up a knife and began cutting the apple into quarters. Thoughts had been forming as Potter spoke, thoughts which this last tag of levity hadn't altered, and he wondered how to bring it up.

"You know a lot of Dracos?"
"More," Harry said. He leaned forward, reached for the bottle and poured a full glass. The whiskey smoked and he admired it for a second. Malfoy was pouring his own glass and held it up in a mock toast. "What are we drinking to?"
Potter's eyes shot up to meet his, angry. "That's not why I married her!"
Perhaps he really has dreamed of it
* * *
"I will." It was no less chilly.
"You've… heard of sexual humiliation." Malfoy's voice was barely audible.
"I don't want to." Albus sounded very definite.
Harry had adjusted to this, too (he'd never been much of a hand-holder), but now it just seemed to be part of the routine. Although right now it wasn't helping. "Hey, this isn't the way to the tube."
"Stop that," Draco said, not meaning it for a second. "Are you going to get all mushy on me now?"
Harry heaved a deep sigh. Thunder rumbled again, followed by a quick flash of lightning that lit the room for a brief second. "I wasn't good enough for him, I guess. He got bored."
"Maybe."
It became a struggle to get closer together, Malfoy moving his arms from around Harry to pull him closer by the arse, by the jaw, swaying together in some sort of primeval dance. The explanation was given in full; Malfoy understood him. Gasping, Harry finally broke away to breathe, to attempt to put some of it in speech anyway. "After last time," he said, his heart pounding, "I couldn't walk away again. Not from this. Not from you."
"Hi." Malfoy came over and sat down on the edge of the upholstered footstool that Harry was sitting on, almost close enough to touch. "Are you busy?"
The tracks appeared to go lower that way, and it seemed even dimmer. "Not that way," Harry said decisively. "Let's try to retrace the way we came, if we can."
"As far as I know," Harry said. "I think I need to talk to this woman in Human Resources. Dawson."
Harry gave a short laugh. "I can sympathise with that."
Malfoy let go and without another word, Disapparated.
Malfoy gave him a strange look. "Men?"
* * *
"I suppose you grew up with electricity," Draco said. "Must make it easier to make the transition from living without magic." Damn it, it better not sound like it was trying to chat Potter up. He'd been aiming for small talk.
Harry thought of the Potions Department. It was a smaller one, and the top staff were rather limited, especially the ones they both knew. "Malfoy?"
Malfoy reacted by draining about half his cup, though it must have nearly burnt his tongue off. "Fuck you, Potter," he muttered, swiping a hand across the back of his mouth. "I'm fine."
"I see a kitty," Lily informed him excitedly.
"Oh, certainly." There was no mistaking the sarcasm this time. "I'll just surrounded by loving, caring, supportive people. My free time is in such demand that I hardly know how to fit everyone in. It's really quite a shame, but what can I - "
"I kissed Pansy once, during the summer between fourth and fifth year." Malfoy's shoulders had tensed again. "And I kissed Daphne Greengrass twice, in party games. That's it. Well - no. That's it."
"I don't know wh - "
Malfoy was getting it on both ends and his hips were moving steadily, alternately pushing his cock into Harry's fist or himself back onto Harry's fingers. He was breathing even harder. "Yeah." He was almost hoarse, his voice ragged.
"Where do you live?" Harry pressed.
"Oh God, Potter - " Malfoy's face was twisted in need, which only heightened everything for Harry.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Albus
Malfoy half-smiled, the closest he ever got to an apology. It didn't matter. Apologies aside, it had still been the best two weeks of his life to date and Harry was willing to let it slide. "Does he know if anyone will be able to tell that he copied it?" He was shuffling through the discs, reading the date labels Dudley had cryptically marked on the covers. He selected one, took it from its case, and inserted it.
Harry held his breath and closed his eyes as Malfoy unbuckled his belt and trousers and unzipped around an ever-hardening bulge. He tried to spread his legs to make it easier for Malfoy without making it obvious that that was what he was doing.
Malfoy gave him a strange look. "That would have to be a bloody good reason. Find your reason, then, but I don't think you will."
"Is in place," said Dolohov's voice.
Potter didn't move a muscle for the longest time. Then he lifted his head and looked out toward the Thames. "You don't know that. We've hardly been together three weeks, if you count the part right before we actually got together. You've probably never even been in love before."
"Fine," Malfoy echoed. "I heard the Auror Department's been fairly quiet."
"Nothing, as I was half expecting," Tonks said.
"Where are you going?"
His voice was like smoke, seeping in through the walls of Harry's barriers. He knew. He was speaking as though it was a fact. That if Harry argued, Malfoy would go to the tall case of books against the far wall and withdraw a large encyclopaedia, thoughtfully thumb open the page containing the Harry Potter article and read aloud to him about his own hidden attraction to men in general and Draco Malfoy in particular, close it, then come back and wait for Harry's reaction. Harry's cheeks were hotter than before and he didn't know what to say. He was staring into his firewhiskey, mortified and angry and trapped.
Ron met Harry's eyes across the table and was still looking shell-shocked. "Holy shit," he said weakly.
"I wasn't talking about Ron," Malfoy said, very dryly.
"Lovely." Malfoy said airily. "As long as I have everything else boiling, I'll put a kettle on."
His hand came back to grip Harry's erection, making him lose his breath in a rush. The alcohol made him far too honest. "I want you blow me," he gasped, pushing desperately into Malfoy's hand.
Snape's awkward position in the war had certainly put a negative spin on the entire career of potions expertise, Harry recalled. The Ministry had been actively recruiting them for several years even while the war was still on. His curiosity about Malfoy's erratic behaviour pushed this thought aside, however. Malfoy was missing work? It seemed highly unusual. Malfoy was rather ambitious about his career and had climbed to the top of the pecking order in potions circles with astonishing speed. He was known more for his acidic personality and intolerance of error than any unreliability.
"Is dead. I know that." Harry's anger rose again. "She's dead, and I still haven't even figured out why she's dead so that I can explain that one to our kids, who are still wondering why someone evidently murdered their mother - and I'm supposed to be the Head Auror, and the case has been closed. I was a complete failure in our marriage, and now I'm even failing her in death. I can't just go having - having a mid-life crisis over this thing and leaving all of that hanging, just because my kids are away at school and - " He saw Malfoy's eyes, cool and grey, and stopped talking. "What?"
It didn't. Thank goodness. Harry settled himself with as little movement as possible. It wasn't that he didn't like sex. He liked sex very much, if he didn't think about it too much. The last conversation came back to mind despite himself.
"Dad?" A small hand was tugging on his shorts.
He didn't know what to say. He stared numbly at Malfoy and tried to sort out how to respond to this. Malfoy held himself rigidly, his eyes glassily out of focus. Propelled by something he didn't even understand, Harry got to his feet. Malfoy didn't look at him as he crossed the room, nor as he perched carefully a short distance away from Malfoy on the sofa. "I'm sorry," he said again, very softly. "I didn't know."
"Do you need to call her?" Malfoy spoke to the cauldron.
"Did you ever think about just telling me or something?"
Draco studied him for a long minute. "I think I do."
Eventually, Harry moved, crawling forward to fling himself onto the sofa, twisting to turn himself over first. Draco joined him, feeling utterly boneless, unable to move or speak. Harry's hands came to rest on his back, holding him loosely, but so close.
"Probably the same thing he does now, only more often," Potter responded promptly. "He goes to the sauna after work and pretends he's not checking out the younger generation."
Potter hit him. "I never would have - if I'd never found out you weren't straight, or interested in me, I never would have said a word!"
Draco followed him, shaking his head at Potter's abrupt one-eighty as he shut the door behind himself. "Does this have something to do with Dumbledore's portrait?"
"I'm sure."
"The black one."
She thought about it. "Oh, fine, I suppose. Single, but not minding it much."
Harry sighed and took Malfoy's hand in a loose grip, wincing as Malfoy favoured him with a syrupy smile and laced their fingers together, leaning against his arm as the other couple got closer. "Is this what you wanted, Sugarpie?" Harry asked irritably, gritting his teeth.
"You didn't see him leave the portrait? Walk out of it or away from it?" Draco wanted to grab her by the shoulder and shake, but restrained himself.
"Then why did you call?" he threw back, unable to put this into words.
Harry opened his mouth to refute this, then suddenly changed directions. "Look, Malfoy, you have a nice arse. But I wasn't thinking about that."
"I'm sorry about before," Potter said, moving his hands to the bottom of the wheel again, his fingers holding it loosely.
Draco trailed after him and sipped the latte, glancing around at Potter's walls. He'd wondered what Potter's abode looked like. Potter had surprisingly good, if eclectic taste. The furniture was mostly modern, the art a mix of personal curios, something that looked like a scarf or possibly a sari draped across one section of wall. He recognised Dean Thomas' style in another section, paired with a series of photographs of Italian Renaissance sculptures. Potter sat down at one end of the sofa and sort of waved generally at the other end of the sofa and the armchairs near it.
"How can you read that rag?" Ginny had fumed, throwing her purse down on a side table. "After everything they've said about you!"
Scorpius looked at him with awe tinged with disbelief. "Sir, are you really asking me…?"
She had cast a fearful look at Potter and turned back to him, acknowledging the question only with her eyes. Potter had acted as though he hadn't heard the exchange, though Draco knew better. Draco had explained what he'd found, sent Potter his own Patronus, then accompanied him as he carried his son to the hospital wing.
"Figured as much," he heard Malfoy's voice drift back and he hurried to catch up again.
"I don't even know if they have any out here," Harry said grumpily. "This is Surrey, remember?"
"I won't let you forget about this."
Heaving a sigh, Harry yanked his glasses from his face and tossed them onto a pile of unsorted papers on the desk. Leaning on his elbows, he applied pressure to the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger.
"They've all given notice. I can't."
Draco calmly laid down the magazine and traded it for the portfolio he was supposed to be reviewing for his two o'clock meeting, in approximately twenty minutes. He swore quietly to himself for having let Potter take up so much of his reading time and went on eating.
Elated, Draco angled himself the same way. "Like that?"
"Harry, you do not have any right to say stuff like this to me!" Ginny was incensed, sitting up now. She switched on a light near the bed. "How dare you! I have always loved you, always, no matter what you put me through!"
"Here," Malfoy muttered, nodding toward a narrow lane between buildings and steering Harry into it. His wand appeared in his hand and Harry felt the cold trickling effect of a Disillusionment. "Now," Malfoy said, stowing his wand. "Don't say anything. Don't argue. You don't have to… just let me."
"Have you been here a lot of times before?" Harry asked after awhile.
One of the hooded figures sneered at him. "And how are you going to make that happen? Nothing you do from where you stand will have any effect on us."
All Harry's mind bucked at this. What would such a thing signify? What was Malfoy really asking? What was he supposed to tell Ginny, for that matter? He could hardly plead 'work' for staying overnight with someone. Even if it was, he told himself, primarily for the Ministry's sake that he would even contemplate it. They couldn't afford to lose Malfoy as an employee. So many of the departments were reliant on the Potions Department. Some part of Harry's brain acknowledged that this was mostly bullshit. Still, though - it was hard to think of it any other way. "Er," he began, "Malfoy…"
Scorpius was quiet for a second, and understood. "About the war," he said, very quietly.
"Then… now?"
Malfoy gave him a brief smile and his body relaxed. "Good night."
"I just happened to go first. You're more familiar with the place and I'm sure you would have led us out just fine," Harry said, brushing it off.
Without opening his eyes, Malfoy said, "You're leaving."
Malfoy seemed to feel the same way, at least. He rolled over and unzipped the nearest bed roll. Without a word, he crawled into it and turned his back to Harry.
They left, calling out goodbyes and (in Harry's case), promising to owl more often. Malfoy was snickering, his weight falling hard against Harry as he took a bad step in his heels and nearly lost his balance. Harry put an arm around him to support his weight; they'd drunk a little too much again and Malfoy was evidently feeling it.
Malfoy reached back and found Harry's hand, now on his back, and moved it down to his arse. Harry opened his eyes and found Malfoy's on him, sober. "Do it," he said, his voice roughened by lust and possibly a touch of emotion.
Malfoy followed them out into the night, his wand arm making a throwing gesture that Harry recognised as a non-verbal tracing charm. A moment later he Disapparated and Harry reappeared with him, not feeling the Apparition. Harry had been in many of London's seediest alleys and corners, but he did not know where they were. The Death Eaters (for they were surely nothing else) moved stealthily down the alley, stalking Ginny. Her hood was up and she was moving quickly, but ahead Harry and Malfoy both saw them before she did: two taller, hooded figures moving out of the alley ahead, blocking her path. Without missing a step, Ginny immediately turned to the left to escape down the narrow alley there, but that, too, was blocked by another figure emerging from the shadows. She stopped, turned, and in front of Malfoy two more Death Eaters materialised with a crack of Apparition: Dolohov and his sidekick.
"Malfoy," Harry started, not sure where to go with it. "I don't know…"
Potter wasn't fooled by his assumed disinterest for a moment and it showed. He narrowed his eyes. "I need to know if there are Death Eater portraits in Hogwarts," he said quietly. "Any at all."
There it was again: something, some subtle disturbance, barely registering against Harry's numbed senses. It was the first time it had been repeated that he could recall. "Listen," he hissed.
"Tonight?" Harry repeated stupidly. "What's tonight?"
Harry smiled. "Have a good one."
And it was true, Draco was harder than ever, the pain augmenting the light friction of Harry's thighs and the lush material covering the sofa against his cock. "I know," he said, trying to resist the urge to get more leverage so that he could thrust. Harry went back to rubbing small circles, first on one cheek, then the other. "I like it."
"No," Malfoy said. "I'm not looking for anyone."
Ginny was staring at the coffee. "Were you already together when we saw you that night?"
"Yes, Chan, go ahead." Draco waited.
__________________
Harry snickered. "Have I been that difficult?"
"I was reading that," Harry said, his irritation mounting.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Not where on your body, Potter - I really don't need to know that - where did it take place?"
Malfoy turned his head to face him and the expression on his face was plain to read. It was hungry, and it caused stirrings of the same hunger in Harry again. Malfoy's face came closer, mouth reaching for Harry's. There was a desperation to the kiss that had little to do with either of them. It was a desire to live, Harry knew, more than any need either of them had for the other. Malfoy wrestled him down, entwining his limbs with Harry's, as though dominating this were the same as dominating the situation, the trap. Harry knew it, but it didn't stop the stirrings of the other hunger below his waist, either. Malfoy writhed against him, desperately, angrily, and Harry's body lifted to push back against his. It was a short-lived thing, driven by fear and a need for affirmation, a need to consummate this particular facet of what it meant to be alive and young and not alone. Harry was panting into Malfoy's mouth, lifting himself to rub his hard cock against Malfoy's without even bothering to remove their clothes. It felt good, and it was the only good thing that he had left, maybe. He was hungry for it, hungrier than he would have been if they weren't hopelessly stuck here, but he knew that he would still want it regardless. He could feel the dampness spreading into his pants and knew that he was about to come, and then he did: he came thinking of Malfoy's cock rubbing against his as Malfoy's skinny hips drove hard into him, their cocks pushing together through the thick material.
"Then take us to Fulham Road." Draco slid his eyes to Potter's hands on the wheel and watched his every move.
For a very brief moment, Malfoy's expression looked very disappointed. Within nanoseconds, though, it was gone, replaced by smooth indifference. "Fine. This was boring, anyway."
Harry did not say that he had been out all day already, but the suggestion gave him pause.
"A bit," Harry conceded. "All right. That sounds like a plan."
"I know it is," he had answered, not sure what he was expected to say.
Harry put his mouth near Malfoy's ear, lips brushing it. "Take off the glamours. I want to try this… you know. With you as you."
"So you do think it's war trauma that made me gay." Harry needled her with his eyes.
Draco shrugged. "I can't fault you for thinking that. That's what half my housemates did."
Harry nodded. "I know," he said, though it wasn't quite the truth. Neville was at the top of the stairs, not looking back. Harry reached back and got his hand on Malfoy's bits, getting a sharp intake of breath in return. "I want to touch you again," Harry added, under his breath.
"But then you joined my side," Harry said slowly.
"No," Malfoy said pointedly. "Nothing whatsoever." He turned and stalked out of the passageway.
Harry glanced over, only to see Pansy smirk and look away, bending to whisper something to Malfoy. He felt his mouth compress and worked hard not to react. "No idea," he said, but he was gritting his teeth.
Draco squeezed his shoulder. "I know you will."
"Are you gay?"
Malfoy raised his wand to his temple and for a crazy moment Harry wondered if he was actually feeling enough remorse to cause him to do something irrational, but all he did was withdraw a long mass of white-ish memory. He found a small jar in a drawer of the island and deposited the memories inside. He came to Harry and gave it to him. "Take it," he said, not meeting Harry's eyes. Harry opened his hand, barely registering the coldness of the jar in his palm. Malfoy was close enough to kiss. Or to kill. There was a shift in the wards as Malfoy lowered them. "I'm sorry," he said, very quietly.
Potter was exhaling and exhaling, not pulling himself out yet, but lowering his chest to Draco's. "Oh God," he said, and said it again. "Oh God, Malfoy. I always - "
His eyes were very intense. Harry didn't back away, though he wanted to. "I never really hated you," he said, truthfully.
Malfoy fiddled with the cocktail menu. "Well, those are the basics. I got married, yes. I married Astoria Greengrass. I suppose you didn't hear that we also got divorced, but that happened about three years ago."
Harry shook his head to clear it. The last thing he needed was to be distracted. There was something he needed to do before he did anything else, and it took priority over everything. He roused himself and went to the other bathroom, the kids' bathroom, splashed water on his face and rubbed a palm over his stubble. He could shave and shower later on. First things first. He dressed and waited for Malfoy downstairs, ignoring the Prophet and the post on the table. He brewed coffee and was drinking it as Malfoy descended the stairs, dressed and ready to leave. Harry set down his cup and looked at Malfoy. "Where?" he asked bluntly.
Disgusted, Harry moved closer and pulled Malfoy's hair away from his face. Malfoy's frame shook against him as he heaved again, pale fingers splayed on the carpet. After, he leaned back against Harry's chest, eyes closing, spent. Harry Vanished the contents of the bucket but prudently left the bucket itself. He added a room freshening smell, though he was dubious of its powers to mask both the vomit and the sour/burnt potions smells. Without thinking, he put a hand against Malfoy's forehead. It was very hot to his palm.
"Nineteen ni - " Malfoy caught himself. "Pre-War Year I. June."
"Yes," Harry said. He should elaborate, but the one-word lie was bad enough. Though he was tired, but he'd been tired with Malfoy, too.
Harry stood up and went over. Ginny stood, too, and put her arms around him. "I want you to be happy," he said.
"For coffee," Harry said, not certain why Tonks was confused.
The mobile rang for the seventeenth time in half an hour, and Harry Potter closed it with a bang.
"A bit," Harry agreed. He was exhausted now, and didn't really want to think about what had just happened or its implications.
It was infuriating. "I do not have sexual issues," Harry had said, teeth gritted tightly. "I just don't happen to want to do that."
The door opened. Almost as though he had known it would. Harry looked up into the mirror and saw Malfoy standing behind him. There was a long silence. Their eyes had met.
"Hang on. I'm thirsty. Do you want something to drink?" Malfoy let go of Harry's hand and pulled away, sitting up.
Harry was shaking. "God," he breathed, after a moment. "Draco - I think I'm ready…" He let out his breath shakily.
It took great effort, but before the eyes would open, Harry managed to make something happen in his throat. It was just a croak, but it was something. "Where - " he coughed - "where am I?"
Harry took a long sip and fought to keep the anger down, telling himself that Malfoy was only on the offensive to keep the spotlight off himself. Time to change that, clearly. He set the cup down and looked Malfoy in the eye. "How have you been doing since the war?" he asked. "I've hardly talked to you since then."
Harry couldn't breathe. His heart was hammering in his chest like it was about to go into cardiac arrest. He did not have a permanent hard-on for Malfoy and never had. Never! Well. Not that Malfoy wasn't fit - extremely fit, even - but Malfoy was Malfoy. End of story. All right, so perhaps a small thing. Very minimal, easily ignored. But the whole "everyone knows" bit was what was really making him squirm. Well, both. Harry couldn't think of something to say. Whoever the writer was certainly seemed to find this funny, pitting Harry and Malfoy against each other like that. Who was the mysterious writer? Someone who had a thing for Malfoy? For Harry? That would fit - if it was someone who liked Harry and he thought that Harry had a thing for Malfoy, then of course he would target Malfoy.
After fifteen minutes on hold, Harry was beginning to think the Ministry's receptionist had forgotten about him. Malfoy sat across the room reading through the Death Eater reports and making notes on a separate roll of parchment. Harry drummed his fingers impatiently on the desk. Finally, there was a click and the sound of reconnection.
"The… fifth."
"I took the Mark willingly," Malfoy said stubbornly, his mouth close to Harry's ear. "No one else is responsible for that."
"I see."
"Malfoy, there are a million places I would rather be. I'll take that as a yes, unless you want to discuss it with Arthur. Where can I stay?"
"No, that doesn't fit," Hermione said positively. "Lots of people have had their lives saved by other people, especially during the war. We'd have heard if there was something like that."
She said nothing for a long time, flinging garments onto the bed without folding them. Then eventually she said, "I can't believe you just didn't know. How can you possibly not know something like that?"
"So do I," Harry said, even if he only really meant it for her sake. "I'm sorry, Ginny."
Draco abandoned the text and studied the man Potter was kissing in the photograph. The face was hidden but the build was tall and thin, and though the photograph was black and white, he could see that the hair was blond. It could have been him. It wasn't him. Potter's jumper had inched up during the embrace, revealing a firmly-muscled abdomen and Draco quietly admitted to himself that the sight held his interest. He could feel it beneath his palm, warm and hard and satisfying.
He was too close. And not close enough. Still hardly breathing, Harry pressed himself back into the edge of the sink. "Where'd you hear that?"
"Fine. Whatever."
"You want me to come and push?"
"A pint of Guinness," the speaker said, sounding exhausted. He got another inaudible response and the server shuffled away, revealing Potter as he sagged against the wall behind himself.
"Oh… that part was okay, I guess," Harry said, pushing his glass over again. As Malfoy refilled it again, amused, he added, "I mean, it was okay. It wasn't perfect. It worked, but I guess anyone can make something work for them if it's all they have, right? Or you don't miss what you've never had or something. I guess it wasn't ever what I really wanted, but it wasn't terrible. There were some things we just didn't ever do, and I suppose I was okay with Ginny just thinking that I was boring that way."
"I know," Harry muttered. "That's not exactly new."
"And that's all it is to you," Malfoy snapped, suddenly coming to life. He glared at Harry. "A fucking report. This is my life, Potter! This is my sordid little past and my potentially dead-end future, if you can get over yourself long enough to notice that I'm not actually a Death Eater any more. I know you don't want to know - you've made that abundantly clear. It just so happens that it matters to me."
"They can all go and sod themselves," Harry said peevishly.
"Very funny. Take my arm, I'll have to Apparate us in."
"Good," Malfoy said. "Anyone else?"
The old hurt rolled over Harry again, though he'd deliberately not thought about it these past six months. "Sure, bored," he repeated, his voice hard. "I'm just not very interesting, all right? John decided it was time to see other people."
"Are you… " Harry trailed off, sounding uncertain. "Draco, what's… Are you upset?"
Potter's hands were deep in his pockets and dark rings framed his eyes. "Are you inviting me over?"
"Definitely," Harry said, and meant it. "Let's go for dinner and talk."
Potter whirled around, face flushed, glasses crooked on his nose, wand out. His left hand had parted ways with its handful as he did so, leaving him exposed in all his glory. And… Draco swallowed. It was a lot of glory. "Malfoy! What the hell are you doing here!" he shouted, furious and red-faced and panicked. Belatedly he looked down and saw himself sticking out everywhere and scrambled to cover himself even as Draco stared.
Harry did as he was told. It had grown warm in his hands, but it still burned on the way down, smoke rising from the empty glass when he set it down.
Never had a voice been more welcome. "Dumbledore," Draco said in relief, turning to face the old man.
"Sort of. You?"
"What about her?"
Harry made a muffled sound of desperation, holding himself more firmly than ever, but even that might not save him now. Malfoy's eyes open and seeing Harry's pained expression, hauled him to his feet. There was a hungry light in his eyes despite his orgasm, and he looked somehow incredibly pleased with himself. "Look at you," he said smugly. "You're going to come any second now, aren't you?"
Malfoy was there in an instant, his wand out, and the boy landed softly, sand flying out from beneath him as the charm scattered it. Harry ran, arriving a second later. Malfoy was crouching, helping him up, his son craning to see what had happened. "Are you all right?" Malfoy was asking. His voice was exactly the same, but the sneering drawl was missing.
Harry had no idea what to say to this, so he did just that. And sat down on the bed which Malfoy wasn't standing beside. "What the hell is happening?"
It was evidently the right thing to say, because Potter's eyes grew impossibly more intense. He swallowed hard, put a hand on Draco's ribcage and put his mouth on Draco's. It was the most leisurely kiss Draco had experienced, and yet there was nothing leisurely about it other than the tempo. Every infinitesimal movement of lip and tongue seemed magnified, intensified, every lingering touch, and Draco was rock hard again within minutes. Potter slid over, leg coming up to curl around Draco's thigh, gradually shifting until he was lying directly on top of Draco, their cocks rubbing together between their torsos. It occurred to Draco to if Potter fucked like this, this slowly and deliberately, the fact that he was single was astounding, because he could not imagine anyone not wanting that all of the time once they'd experienced it. And he wanted it.
"Beetles. When did it start?"
Draco paused for a moment. "Well, there is that," he said, and suddenly he turned shining eyes on Harry. And if there had been any onlookers from below, they would have seen the two silhouettes move together then and not move apart for a substantially long time after that.
Potter shook his head. "I… I don't know how much you know about, well, the finer points of my work over the past ten years or so, but I've sort of invented a fair bit of magic along the way."
__________________
Harry and Ginny had owned a car, and Harry had left it without argument. He and Draco always Apparated to their respective workplaces and neither of them had cared enough about driving to get another. Besides, the kids all liked taking the Underground. It was a treat, ironic as Draco found that. The train began to slow. Draco looked across at Albus and offered a tight smile. "I'll say goodbye here," he said. "Before we get out."
"Busy?"
"I will send Sir Cadogan to go with you," Potter said firmly.
He stood there, breathing hard and trying to hold himself against the images, fingertips white where his hands were gripping the edge of the sink. He didn't know how much time had passed.
"Someone has to make sure I don't disgrace the Ministry, I suppose."
"No one told me. Not even the Aurors, and they're the ones who gave me what information I had to start with," Harry said. He hesitated. "I can't even imagine that. I can't imagine how you deal with something like that."
Harry glanced into the room, but wasn't all that interested. "Where's the bedroom?"
"Don't you mean baklava?"
"In the earlier years, probably, yeah," Harry said. "By the end, I didn't. In fact, I felt more sorry for you than anything."
Harry his hand on Draco's face and kissed him slowly. After he made a face and said, "I wish we didn't have to do the part with pretending we're all still two separate happy families."
"To an extent." This wasn't for Potter to know. Potter was supposed to be talking about his problems, not probing into his. "Is that what you're most afraid of?"
Malfoy's fingers were undoing the button of the jeans, shoving the zip down around Harry's cock, which was doing its best to get in the way, bursting out of Malfoy's briefs, and the thought that they were Malfoy's didn't help anything at the moment. Long fingers pushed those out of the way, too, and then they were touching Harry in strokes that were just this side of being too rough, and the roughness made him writhe with need, pushing himself desperately into Malfoy's hand.
______________
After a moment, Harry opened his eyes and still saw little, especially without his glasses. He let out his breath in a deeply satisfied sigh, and for a moment, everything else was forgotten.
Potter still didn't speak or look at him. The lift chimed for the eighteenth storey and the doors opened. Potter got out, taking his gift bags with him. "Come on," he said briefly, and went down the corridor. Draco followed, his hopes lifting slightly. Unless Potter just wanted a convenient place to push him off a roof or something, surely this meant he had more time to try to change his mind.
The blond was rather attractive, though hardly competition. Not that he was competing. He'd rejected Potter, not the reverse. Potter had left because he was embarrassed and needed a cover for his accidental gay experience. Although. Draco studied the article, stabbing a chopstick rather viciously into his agedashi tofu. The article only speculated, stating that Potter had been seen with the blond in Diagon Alley and later, in the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade. Potter's only remark was quoted as, "Yes, we're friends." The blond wasn't named. In a smaller, blurred photograph on the inside next to the article, however, it looked rather as though Potter and the unnamed offender were holding hands. It was difficult to tell, though; Potter was wearing robes in the picture and they obscured the exact view.
"Bye."
"I did notice that, yeah." Harry decided to give him a break. "What about the leader? Any thoughts there?"
"Brilliant," Malfoy said, his voice like a caress. His breath touched Harry's ear, making him shiver.
Draco answered the server's questions and kept his burning face down as he handed over his menu.
Promises to Keep
Kingsley reached for his notepad then, a solid cue to follow suit. Harry got out his quill and began taking notes.
Potter's seeming good mood had vanished. "There was nothing nice about it." He stood abruptly. "Thanks for the drink. I'll see you later."
Never might be too soon, at this rate. "Tomorrow would be great," Draco managed, sounding strangled.
A baleful stare. "Who you, mate? Her boyfriend?" A snort and a long drink from the bottle.
It was a lie, but it seemed to strike a nerve. Malfoy's face reddened with anger. Without a word, he turned and went into the bathroom, closing the door with a bang.
"What is it?" Draco wanted to know.
"Right, perhaps not the Fat Lady," Potter agreed. "Or the animals. Or… well, a lot of them. And the former Headmasters and such are probably too old, for the most part. We do need someone who can fight. It's against the Curator's policy to activate a portrait of someone still living, though."
"Fuck you, Potter," Malfoy said good-naturedly. "Get over your homophobia. And stop staring at my tits."
He watched Hermione hold out her hand formally to Malfoy. "I don't think we've met," she said, friendly and just a tad aloof. "Hermione Granger."
Harry nodded, trusting Malfoy's proximity to allow him to catch it, and crept back. The numbers were tiny and blurred themselves individually every so often, or the entire sequence would scatter, then rearrange itself in a different area of the screen. Harry leaned a little closer, but just then the goblin uttered some sort of uncouth curse and flicked a long finger at the screen, touching one corner. The numbers became runes and no longer moved. Harry moved away, disappointed.
"Don't say things like that," Draco said, suddenly sharp. "It's not that complicated. We both wanted in each other's pants, and here we are."
* * *
He looked rather eager, and Malfoy looked amused again. Harry ordered, ignoring both factors, and listened to Malfoy's order. He was picky, eschewing the gin as the place was out of Tanqueray, and his pickiness did not surprise Harry in the least. The server bustled away and Malfoy grinned obnoxiously. "Looks like you've got a fan," he drawled.
There was something in her voice. "What is it?" Harry asked tightly, thinking simultaneously of Surrey and Malfoy.
Harry nodded, took a deep breath, and followed Malfoy up the carpeted staircase. Near the top, Malfoy stopped two stairs above Harry and took Harry's face in both hands and assaulted his mouth with a passion akin to fury, nearly suffocating in its intensity. Harry responded in like fashion, and after a bit he and Malfoy had ended up on the stairs in a tangle of arms and legs and mouths and as long as he could go on kissing Malfoy, Harry was fine. His heart was beating wildly, his entire body more alive than it had ever felt before. Eventually Malfoy struggled to his feet again, pulling Harry bodily with him. Arms still twined around him, Malfoy stumblingly led them to a room, neither of them willing to let go even for this. Malfoy couldn't seem to find the light switch. In annoyance, he finally lit candles around the room with a wandless wave, revealing a lush bedroom suite in the flickering light.
She reacted with shocked silence. Then, "What?" Her voice rose hysterically. "No. I don't believe it. I refuse to believe it."
Anyone else might have missed the almost entirely concealed flicker of interest. Malfoy treated him to an evil smile. "I'll tell you what's going to happen here, Potter," he said lazily. "First off, you're going to unzip my trousers. Secondly, you're going to suck me off, and after that, I'll think about it."
"I'm not," Harry said, not even sure how this could be true, but insisting nonetheless.
"The court case reviews," Harry said. "Same as everyone else. What day do you want us to go? Any special instructions?"
"You, the Boy Who Lived," Draco quipped humourlessly.
Draco looked at his retreating back and refused to answer the infuriating question of whether he was more annoyed by Potter or intrigued.
"I'm still working on that, but I have an idea," Potter said. He stood. "I'll keep you posted." He looked at Draco and nodded back toward the apartment. Draco led the way back inside. "Sorry about that," Potter said as soon as the door was closed. "You were sleeping and you looked so peaceful, I didn't want to wake you."
"Don't call me that!" Potter snapped. "I can understand friends, Malfoy, but why would you do this to me?"
"Are you saying I was a negligent father?" Harry was angrier than ever, mostly because it was true. "All right, so I was. Are you happy? I wasn't home enough, and I apparently didn't even know the person I was married to and knew for most of my life at all! Are you happy? Is that what you want me to say?"
He didn't.
Harry picked up his latte and took a long sip. "I think so. I'm pretty sure."
One corner of Malfoy's mouth quirked, whether in annoyance or an almost-smile, Harry didn't know. "Apparently it really is possible."
"Potter." Malfoy brought him back to reality. "You all right?"
short one! A bunch of the fifth years are going early to beat
Potter smiled. "Maybe I just wanted to see you again."
A knot of something hot and tight returned to the pit of Draco's belly. It felt good and warm and anxious all at once. As though danger signals should have been flashing, but for whatever reason, weren't. It shouldn't be this easy. Potter was right. He very much wanted to suppress that thought, though. And Potter liked him. Genuinely liked him. Surely this was going above and beyond the assignment, not that he'd spared that a passing thought in days. He couldn't find the right words because he didn't know what to say. He felt good. Yes. He decided that good was the overriding feeling and went with it. "I wanted this, too." Maybe it wasn't true for before, but it was certainly true now.
"I wonder if it really is the wands," Malfoy said thoughtfully, appearing not to notice. "Our wands wouldn't have a connection, would they? I mean, you used mine and generally handled it for a few days, or maybe a few weeks, I can't remember. How did it feel to use it? Did it perform well?"
* * *
"I'm sorry," Harry said. "Go on. Uh, if you would."
Hermione bit her lip. "Actually," she said, "it's a bit of a long story, but I ended up doing a lot of Healer-type stuff, and I think their point was to show me that that's what I want to do. I'm going to be switching out of the pre-Auror stream, I think. But we can talk about it more later. Hello, Draco!"
Snape yawned and stretched. "I do not know."
"I'm fine," he assured Potter in response to his demands. "But I'm afraid it was Death Eaters. I Stunned a few before someone hit me with something. I don't believe anything magical was done to me."
Draco paused. "I realise this is asking something not characteristic for you or for me, but I will have to ask you to be the bigger man in the future. Don't rise to his provocations."
Beside him, Draco cleared his throat. "What's the matter with you?"
"You're very amusing," Malfoy said. "Let's go down this path."
"No," Harry said. "I mean, I know we didn't get along. You were nasty to my friends and to me. You were the best rival to have in Quidditch, though. I didn't exactly think of it that way then, but I've played a bit since school and it's not the same. Plus which, the war is over and I've moved on, or tried to. There's no point in remembering some things."
"I don't want to stay here," Harry said. "I want to go somewhere else and get on with my life."
"We'll both have the chicken souvlaki," he said. "And some wine, I think. What's your house red?"
"Right, I guess there's that."
Foolish situation, really. Especially when DM knows exactly what HP would taste like
It was quiet but not hesitant, but the cloth moved again and the movement felt uncertain to some part of Harry's brain, deep in the recesses, that was ingrained to evaluate behaviour and react accordingly. "What happened?"
Anxious to shift the focus off himself, Harry turned the tables. "And you're an Unspeakable. That's unexpected. I had no idea you worked for the Ministry."
"Rather," Harry said dryly. "Why?" He'd met the bloke in a different club - which one, he couldn't remember now - and, having drunk a little too much and lost a bit too much inhibition, allowed the bloke to give him a blow job in a darkened alley.
Harry shook his head, confused. "I thought you still hated me. I mean, you never acted like you wanted to talk to me or become friends. I don't know. I was just busy and preoccupied and if you were sending hints, I missed them."
"Good."
"Would I be doing it if I wasn't?" Harry threw back. "Leave it, all right?"
Malfoy looked at their hands. "But," he said, and waited.
"I should have guessed."
"You excluded me from the entire Horcrux search," Ginny went on, as though he hadn't said anything. "Which is something I will never understand. I don't see why you couldn't have included me."
"You like that?" Harry felt his hips touch Malfoy's and was too aroused now to do anything but this, and Malfoy was nodding vigorously. "Good."
How does DM know that?
She heard his hesitation. "Couldn't you just go by?" Tonks pleaded. "Just check on him. Maybe he needs real help. I don't know."
"What?!"
Pansy positively beamed at him. "Splendid," she said. She let herself out and Disapparated with an audible pop in the hallway. Draco betook himself to the smallish balcony off the main room and went to stand in the chill air for a long time, turning over the entire assignment interview in his head.
"It is."
"That's a switch," Malfoy said. He did not ask how Harry had found his address and Harry did not volunteer the information.
That mouth was distracting as all hell. "How could I forget?" Draco asked, trying to remember to inhale. "We've tried nearly all of them."
"Exhausting, isn't it?" Malfoy said, still speaking softly. "Come on, Potter. I'm going to Apparate us directly to the alley beside the Leaky and we can take these off."
"Never mind that!" There was a hand on his wrist, pinching in a vice-like grip. "Get up!"
Draco made himself release his jaw. "Yes."
"Potter!"
Malfoy had noticed, too. He got his mouth near Harry's ear and murmured, "They look rather impressed with your catch, Potter" in a tone of great amusement.
"How's Ginny? Still at that same place?"
The disc began to play. A time/date stamp in red lettering showed at the bottom right of the screen. "Why did you start here? This one is from a little over a year ago, probably right around the date of one of the deposits," Harry said. When Malfoy hmm-ed and didn't really answer, Harry shrugged. He supposed Malfoy had his reasons. "You can skip ahead to the deposit. It should be sometime after seven o'clock in the evening, which is when the funds left Gringotts, if our theory is right."
The coffee shop was in a dingy corner of London. It was late and dark and the clientele looked rough around the edges. Malfoy shifted next to Harry in the booth. "You're sure he'll show?" he said, yet again.
"Please."
Harry relaxed. "Oh - yeah. Sorry, Gin. I just got caught up here."
"You're not - you don't have to - " Harry tried to protest, despite how embarrassingly much he wanted it.
"Or in a public loo. Or a back alley. Or my kitchen. Or your sofa."
"Harry, this is Kingsley. I've been trying to track down a few of those people you mentioned at dinner last night, and I've found something for you."
Their eyes met. "Did he tell you?" Tonks asked delicately.
He had to tell her. Not mentioning Malfoy would just be counter-productive at this point. "Hermione."
"Okay. You too. Come on, Al." He waited.
However, Harry had never been much of one for following the rules, no matter whose they were. He took Malfoy by the shoulders and backed him into the room until the backs of those slim thighs hit the bed and he toppled backwards, Harry bending over him. Harry smiled down at him, feeling predatory. "Nice room," he said.
This time Potter caught it. "Are you watching it now?" he demanded. "Jeez, Malfoy, you thought it was so perverted, and now you're watching it?"
"Good. As long as that's clear," Malfoy said, and put his mouth back on Harry's. Harry felt some of the tension leave Malfoy's shoulders this time, and Malfoy was leaning into him and it felt so natural, so right, like something he'd never known to look for but always wanted. Malfoy pulled away again. "Come to bed," he said.
Potter turned his glass in his fingers, marking it up with fingerprints. "Yes. I would use it when I wasn't even thinking about. I don't think I could do it for too long a time. Besides, I would hate feeling like a Muggle."
Draco had a sudden flash of intuition; for one moment alone, that made perfect sense. He nodded. "Okay." He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, Dumbledore was gone. In front of him, the portrait window was gone, too, and in its place there was a door. The door was the green of Potter's eyes, and there was a small, golden keyhole in the very center. Draco walked over, fit the little key into it, turned it and opened the door. He was back in his own office, and Potter was there, waiting.
"Harry - "
"Weasley?"
"I apologised."
Malfoy's pupils were dilated and very dark. "Brilliant deduction, Potter. Though I still say they could come upstairs any minute now."
Malfoy held out his scroll. "I'm not sure," he said. "See what you make of it."
"You know what this is about?" Draco was not always so pre-emptory with his son, but he was angry that he had only found out about the prank business from others. He normally prided himself on knowing what was happening within the walls of his domain.
A hissing voice cut through Harry's sleep-fogged mind, somehow mingling for a moment or two with his last dream. The voice was intertwined with the sound the waves were making as the sand reabsorbed them. For a second, he was completely confused. His eyes jerked open. "What?" He heard his voice, startled and sleepy-sounding. "Who's there?"
Why had Malfoy remained silent about it all, this past year? Was it that his oaths as an Unspeakable kept him from ever talking about it, even once Ginny was dead, or was it that he had never known the answers to Harry's questions, himself? An incomplete case was worthless, and what proof had Malfoy, other than his memories? It would have looked like false accusation, maligning the dead. The Aurors investigating had never found any trace of this, nothing whatsoever. No suspicious questions had been asked. The money had never been traced back to Ginny, nor had her connection to the Death Eaters. Until now. This year of mystery, of radio silence about what had actually happened to her was all coming to light. It was as though it had all been one long night, and now the dawn was breaking to reveal only bleakness and grey. The damaged, fragile relationship he thought he had been in had been far more broken and deceitful than he had realised. Dawn was breaking, yes, but Harry had never dreamed that this could be the reality behind the mystery all along. Nor had he ever thought of connecting it to the very thing he was investigating himself. And what was he supposed to do now? Simply forget? He paced. He sat, he paced, he kicked off his shoes, he paced some more. The night dragged on forever as his emotions warred in his head and chest.
Draco went cold. "Do you know of any other way, other than having your portrait painted?"
Harry stopped in his tracks. "Arabic?" He was really going to have to stop repeating everything Malfoy said.
Malfoy shot him an annoyed look. "Because not even simple things are working now."
Later, when his heart rate was back to normal, Harry finally said, "So where do you want to go for lunch?"
__________________
Malfoy said nothing, eyes fixed on the wall.
"By the fountains near the Marlborough Gate. See you there." Again, Malfoy rang off before waiting for a response. Was he that sure of himself, Harry wondered, or was it masking a fear that Harry would back out, given the chance?
Malfoy didn't say anything right away. "Just let me know when you're done in here," he said, and went across the hall to the bedroom.
Roger Reid
"Well, I was just wondering… sir, what exactly is my assignment? Am I just helping Malfoy maintain this? Like, am I just playing sidekick, or am I missing something?"
"Weren't you just lecturing me about working this late a few days ago?"
His unannounced Apparition in the front hall of the house made Lily shriek, Albus jump, and James give a yell of what Harry could only assume was joy. All three children surrounded him, and he knelt to hide his face in their hair, their undemanding familiarity. Everything in him was swirling. He did not want to lose this. He could not lose this. And yet he seemed to have no power to say no to Malfoy, no power to make himself want to say no in the first place. Only Albus noticed anything, giving Harry a slightly quizzical look. But he didn't say anything and Harry was relieved.
"Very brief someones, maybe," Malfoy said. "It doesn't last, though."
"I don't care what you think." Lupin wouldn't buy it, but he had to at least say it.
"I'm not upset with you or anything like that," Potter said hastily. "I just - there's something we should talk about."
"Fuck you, Potter," Malfoy said, glaring. "I've been on this side my entire adult life."
Draco gave a short laugh. "Not at all."
The light tap at his office door pulled Harry out of his slouch over a pile of unorganised parchments. The security ward glowed blue opposite the knocking hand. "Come in."
"Unless you're in mine," Malfoy agreed.
Harry felt his brows rise. "Really," he said. "Well. That's great. Would you happen to know where he is at the moment?"
"Like how, then?" Potter challenged, his eyes darkening. "I can't believe a word you say. I - I have never been this hurt, ever. I can't believe you would do this."
"I know," Harry said again. "I wish we could, though." He started up the stairs. Malfoy followed too closely, his hands brushing against Harry's arse. With difficulty, Harry moved away at the top of the stairs and went to get his things.
He wasn't looking when he ran into Potter three days later. Literally ran into him, right outside the Leaky Cauldron. Infuriatingly, the first thing Draco's traitorous mind suggested was that they were very close to the place where the incident with Potter had taken place. The rest of him was too busy worrying about his nose, though.
Harry found his hand and squeezed tightly. "I was thinking," he said. "Maybe - "
Malfoy's eyes narrowed. "You'd rather go the rest of your natural life without ever being that aroused again instead? That's insane."
"Even them."
"Good night," Malfoy said. He closed the door after Harry and Harry, looking back, saw the light in the hall turn out a few moments later. The sight caused a pang of agony. He wished he were still inside, with Malfoy. Nonsense, he told himself sternly. He had to go home to the kids. It had to be past eight by now; to stay away any longer would require explanations that he didn't have or wasn't ready to give.
"Possibly," Malfoy agreed, unsmiling. "I'm sure they miss a lot, though."
"It's so hard to let go of any of it," he said heavily. "It just stays with you. I guess you just have to figure out how to live with it."
"I do not have a problem!" Draco said loudly. "What's your problem, Potter?"
"I never said I didn't have one," Malfoy said, just a trifle of wry amusement coming into his voice.
Harry checked the clock himself, now. It was just past seven. "Maybe around eight?"
"Why not?"
Harry indicated his quill and waited.
Potter began a slow smile and finally turned toward him. "You really love me?" he asked again.
Draco looked over his shoulder, his features twisted. "Oh, I want to," he said. "I'm just - I don't think we're ready for that." He rapidly shed the rest of his clothes and got into bed. "Good night," he said quickly.
"Potter, would you shut up and listen to me?" Draco hissed. "It so happens that - "
"I follow them out of loyalty to my best friend," Potter said. He extended a hand. "This was fun. Enjoy the party."
It looked like purple egg covered in the cellophane grass that came in Muggle kids' Easter baskets, some of which Dudley had once forced Harry to eat. "I see," Harry said gravely. "Is he flying?"
"Precise date." Harry didn't look at him as he wrote.
Malfoy made a contemptuous sound. "No one said you had to do anything. No one invited you to get hard over me. That's not my issue. And if you hated it, you could have stopped whenever you wanted to. But you didn't. Don't take your issues out on me, Potter."
"Who is it?" Harry asked, though the way his heart began to pound told him that he knew who he wanted it to be. He sat up, trying to untangle his legs from the blanket.
"Most of the first year and part of the second." Malfoy wouldn't look at him.
Malfoy was right there, his breath touching Harry's lips. "Don't get weird on me, Potter," he said.
Something heavy seemed to click into place within him. Potter hadn't said a word to them. And now, despite everything, he had achieved what he had been working toward for the past three years. Draco experienced a brief glimpse of himself out in public, somewhere with Potter, perhaps, the headlines the next morning about Aurors Potter and Malfoy and whatever else people wanted to say, the stigma of his past fading into obscurity. And Potter beside him. Yes. That was important.
Malfoy scanned the room. "Hmm." A moment later, he'd transfigured two small bars of soap into sandals and gave them to Harry. "I can change them if they don't fit. Oh, and they might smell like soap a bit."
Harry couldn't speak. He was furious with himself - they had said they would make Santa Fe by dark, and to stop now would waste so much time. Perhaps not so much time, at this rate, but it was the principle that was at stake. That they couldn't just hijack an entire day's driving schedule because Draco had to go and get horny. Because they both did, Harry acknowledged silently, still furious with his body. And his own, twisted perversions.
Malfoy snorted. "Hardly."
Draco stirred beside him, and Harry pushed the thoughts back out of the way. "Should we get up?"
Draco perched himself on the edge of the sofa, angling his legs in such a way that it neatly hid any observations Potter had hopefully failed to make thus far where such things were concerned. "I spoke to Snape's portrait today," he said. "I essentially told him about this and tried to recruit him to fight."
"Minerva has a selection waiting for you upstairs," Lupin said. "We think there's one that may work well. She'll explain it all later. In the mean time, I expect you both need a little rest before getting back out there. Stay for a few days. When you're ready, you'll be reassigned. We'll need people to find and break the other illusions, rescue the people we've lost."
Harry frowned, trying to comprehend Malfoy's suggestion, as well as the motives behind it. "Why do you care?" he asked bluntly.
Potter was cool. "This is Draco Malfoy. I went to school with him at Hogwarts."
Snape considered this for a moment, mouth pursed, eyebrow raised, but eventually he nodded, unpursed his mouth and walked sideways out of his frame.
It was strangely comfortable too, and it had no right to be. Granted, Harry's nerve endings were tingling with Malfoy's proximity once again, and if Malfoy was standing deliberately too close to Harry and pretending that he wasn't, Harry was going along with it. Their arms brushed as Malfoy put four oranges in a plastic bag and knotted it. He turned. "Your pepper inspired me," he said, nodding toward them. "So I suppose we just don't talk about last time, either. Too complicated?"
"I'll be fine."
Harry found himself smiling. "Indeed," he said, drinking. "Though now I'm curious to know whose been saying that."
They'd left their clothes in the bedroom in favour of getting into the spanking in front of the fire. "Besides, it'll make your arse glow all the better," Harry had said, eyes gleaming fiendishly.
tonight! I'm going to need them for making potions over
After, Draco said, rather wistfully, "You have to go. I've made you late."
"Way too long. And you're nosy. And you look way too good in my jeans."
* * *
"I could ask the same thing," Potter said, still defensive.
So Malfoy didn't know about the Floo system. Interesting. "No, this one's only for Kingsley and it's pretty strongly warded," Harry said. "Do you… know the area? There's a place near the park that's not too loud and they have pretty decent food if you're hungry. Decent for the kind of thing it is, I mean. It's nothing fancy And I'm starving, personally."
"I - yeah. Owl me." Draco's face was hot with embarrassment at his own inability to hide this very simple thing.
"If you want me to come, then yes," Malfoy said, still sounding suspicious.
"Have you heard it's dangerous ground?" Potter asked, his mouth twitching.
"Don't do this," he said. "Come on, Potter. Don't lose it on me here." He was wary. "I'll give you what I have. I can't talk about it, but before you destroy my place and maybe me along with it, let me show you."
"Not right away, but I do have a meeting at noon."
Malfoy gave a derisive laugh. "The Romans named it that. They widened it because it was too narrow for their chariots. Do you know who Mark Twain was?"
Grey Dawning
Potter held his eye for a long moment, then waved a hand, wandlessly casting something.
"He still isn't." Harry shrugged. "I've finished his report, though. He'll probably always get funny looks and so forth, but at least he'll be legally free."
"I recall," Harry said sharply. "And I'm sure you know his name, profession, and date of birth to say the least, so cut to the chase."
"I'm not trying to say that you do," Harry fumbled. "I just have to tell you that I've started seeing someone. And I thought I should let you know, given our… history."
Malfoy shrugged, still smiling. "It's not all that special. I just add a personalised aura detecting charm, so that I'm only slightly visible to you, and you're only slightly visible to me. Well, your aura, that is."
Malfoy's eyes bored into his. "Is that a fact?"
"But they interrupted their own spell by killing one of the players in the pattern?" Harry clarified.
Malfoy treated him to a long stare and pointedly didn't answer this. "You and your questions."
"Potter." His tone was arch. He was going on instinct. "Rough week?"
"It's fine," Draco said. "I suppose we had to talk about the war sometime."
There was a pregnant pause. "George Weasley?" Malfoy asked carefully.
Malfoy broke the eye contact, speaking too quickly. "I think the Death Eaters are gone. The aura around the house feels different, can't you feel it? I just wanted to ask if you know where it's still safe to go."
Potter glared at him. "Ginny's on tour, as I'm sure you know."
"Maybe." Harry hung the pot on its nail on the wall and the towel over the rack at the end of the counter. "I'll see you later."
* * *
Draco's hand stilled. "Why not?" He sounded miffed.
Draco nodded absently and stabbed the little plastic sword through his olive. He couldn't have cared less about Weasley, but Potter… "Are you upset about her?" he asked, unable to look at Potter as he did so. He watched Potter's fingers instead.
"Not so fast."
Longbottom shrugged self-consciously. "It's all right, if you like that sort of thing."
"I know," Harry said, and he didn't know who was reassuring whom now. He kissed Malfoy one last time and took a step away. "Good night."
"It doesn't matter," Tonks said. "I've already spoken to Kingsley. He's on his way. I woke him. You're off the assignment. We'll find the details. Why don't you go and get some sleep?"
"Sure," Dudley said. He looked at Malfoy, about to ask something.
He knew it was a crush. A stupid, foolish crush that was only happening because there were no other targets around to distract him. But letting Potter find out would not only ruin whatever they had going on, but also any chance Draco still had of qualifying. It would weird Potter out to unspeakable degrees to discover that, just as he was beginning to get over his instinctive distrust and quite probable dislike of him, that Draco had some sort of perverted homosexual attraction for him. No. It absolutely could not happen. Draco clenched his jaw without meaning to and stared fiercely out the window of Potter's car, trying not to wince as the other cars came disturbingly close on Potter's side or the kerb on his own.
They were standing in an alley about half a block from the Leaky Cauldron. Harry went through his mental checklist. "I think so, yes. We Disillusion and walk to Gringotts on opposite sides of Diagon Alley. When we get to the bank, you'll find me and somehow you'll use your magical Unspeakable powers to get us inside undetected."
"Right. That. That's exactly what it was. I mean, I've never liked Ron that way, but if I did, it would have been the same thing. You know. Best mate. I'm gay. It would have made sense, but what makes more sense is being with someone I actually fell in love with, and not just because he was always there." Harry took off his glasses and rubbed them on his jumper. Putting them back on, he said, "That's better. Anyway, I fell in love with you. You know that."
Malfoy laughed again. "Probably wise. Well, to be honest, I don't actually do either most of the time."
Potter looked worried. "I'll get you back," he vowed. "And I think I've thought of something. The problem is, I don't know how to test it."
Malfoy seemed pleased by this. "Good. That's what I was going for. Now let's get our stories straight. We are arts students at the City University. I major in bio-chemistry and you major in twentieth century British history. I think you look all right the way you are. We're going to go to a pub near the campus and see how we fit in. I'll fill you in on the details on the way."
Malfoy stared at him, eyes glassy, and looked about to object. Then he appeared to change his mind. "We can do it at the same time."
Harry groaned, not knowing whether Malfoy meant Ron or Ginny, but either of their reactions could lead to trouble. "Oh my - " He changed directions suddenly, remembering his assignment and reserving his judgement. "Fine. Good. That should be interesting."
Albus had resumed rocking, absorbed in some private fantasy of racing. He was going rather quickly and Harry was just about to say something when Albus lost his balance and was thrown from the horse.
The door banged. There was a thump and the unmistakeable sounds of his toddler running toward the kitchen. "Daddyyy!"
"Right."
______________
"Thanks for agreeing to include him. I know you don't get along, but he's useful."
"So Kingsley's retiring?" Ginny shot back. "That's pretty sudden. Too sudden for anyone else to have an actual chance at running, putting a campaign together. Last I checked, wizarding Britain was still a democracy - if they think the public would accept someone just being appointed Minister for Magic like that, nowadays - I mean, the war is over, it's not like when Fudge resigned. Someone had to step in then, but this time there would have to be a proper election, and - "
The glittering letters forming his name and Pansy's above their heads, Draco grimaced and tugged her off toward the bar. A drink was what he needed, first and foremost. Pansy refused to be towed, somehow maintaining that glide and seemingly weightless arm on his in an invisible grip of steel. She was not going to be rushed, dressed as she was and with all the media attention. The dress was something between silver and steel, shifting in the light. It matched his eyes and tie, which was no mistake - Pansy had informed him in a tone that brooked no argument that he was wearing that particular tie. Fortunately, he liked it. Pansy's face was a work of art; hours of careful layering and tweaking had produced an effect that was really rather nice. Draco elbowed his way to the bar and eyed the room, wondering who she would ultimately leave with, and simultaneously scanning for Potter.
"Who's getting weird?" He could just barely see Malfoy's face in front of his, swallowed by the dark. Their faces were so close, it would take less than an inch to close the remaining distance.
Potter pulled the mug toward himself. "Does it matter?" He was still red and avoiding eye contact.
"By who, exactly?" Harry demanded. "Besides you? How did you get past my wards?"
They were facing each other, neither about to give any ground. "This is what you put me through," Ginny said. "And then after, you made me wait so long before you were willing to get married, and after all that, to find out that you're sexually defective - well, it's a bit much."
______________
The house had gone quiet. By about eleven most people usually got out of the main rooms and into their own bedrooms, scattered about the house. Harry's room was on the fifth floor, just beneath the attic, and moonlight streamed in from the small dormer window. He liked it specifically because it was fairly removed from the other (occupied) bedrooms and he liked the solitude. Once he'd realised that it was not actually mandatory to share a room with Phineas Nigellus' portrait, Harry had gone exploring and chosen this room. It had been the place he crashed between battles for years, and then his only address for the past two. He longed for space of his own, to get out of this house and the oppressive feeling of living at work. With the Order breaking up, perhaps that would happen sooner than he thought, but he felt uneasy about that. Perhaps Snape was right and he was afraid of the future and what his life would look like without the war to shape it for him. Maybe they were all afraid.
"Yes, by owl, five minutes ago," Dumbledore said.
Harry glanced at Malfoy. "Okay."
Everything was very carefully polite, Malfoy meeting his gaze evenly. Harry nodded. "Three, actually. The youngest is a girl. How old is your son?"
Harry thought this, and slowly the realisation began to dawn. It had never really been about Ginny. Not since they had been sixteen, anyway. But this time around, it had everything to do with going with what made sense. His best friend's sister. Harry had always ignored the whispered comments that occasionally came his way about all things Freudian and resemblances to long-dead mothers and so forth, but it had bothered him privately nonetheless. Was that really it? Was he looking for a mother substitute - and a convenient place to stick it on a regular basis? It sounded very ugly. But the truth was that he had never felt the level of arousal he'd felt with Malfoy that morning. He hadn't known that he could genuinely be that attracted to another person. He had never been unhappy; it was just that it had not dawned on Harry that it was possible to feel that. And what had it even been? An early morning hand job. Nothing glamorous, nothing particularly exciting. They hadn't even kissed. Not then, at least. But Harry craved more of it. Much, much more.
"Most of them are dead," Malfoy said quietly.
Potter had the grace to look somewhat abashed. "Well, sorry," he muttered rebelliously. "I didn't mean to hurt you just now. Are you all right?"
Malfoy's tone was cool, but somehow it wasn't convincing. "I have no intention of forcing my presence on you."
"You're the Headmasters of Hogwarts," Scorpius persisted stubbornly. "If the Potters think you got the job just to persecute them, they need to be taught a lesson."
"No, it's fine," Malfoy said, though his throat was constricted in what sounded like pain to Harry.
Malfoy shrugged. "I suppose I've had a bit of an interest in you for a few months now. And I never forgot how decent you were to me at the beginning of the year. It changed how everything could have gone. Thanks to you, I wasn't a pariah in our year of training. And then I got to know you a little better, with the war out of the way, and what do you know. You're not half bad, after all."
"About you and them in the safehouse in Norfolk? Yeah," Harry said. "Pretty hard to forget that."
The look Malfoy gave him was filled with something that Harry was at a loss to interpret. He was still furious, certainly, but also ridden with some sort of private anguish that made him feel that even asking was an intrusion. Hadn't Malfoy wanted him to do his report? Harry was growing less sure of his footing by the minute. Malfoy didn't say a word, just stared dully at him.
Malfoy just stared at him, the humour disappearing. "Fuck, Potter, calm down. I was just asking."
"We won't find that in the Old City," Malfoy said at once. He thought. "Let's try the Embassy. That's probably our best bet. And if they don't have a guide like that, they should know where to send you to find one."
Harry shook his head. "Not tonight. I want to get home for once." Then, seeing his friend's face, he added, "Sorry. Sometime soon, maybe."
"Six-thirty," Potter confirmed. Suddenly, he smiled. "Thanks, Malfoy."
"It's your daughter," Draco said. "Whatever you want."
Albus nodded solemnly and tottered off toward the other end of the sandbox. If he fell, it was barely half a meter from the ground. The swing began to slow. "Da-ad!" James whined.
Malfoy tugged self-consciously at the bulky sweater he wore over loose-fitting jeans. Harry spared a moment to wonder if he'd ever seen Malfoy in jeans before and decided that he hadn't. "What do you think?"
"Just the one," Malfoy said. "You have at least two, I see."
"Not getting to be what we really are in public," Potter said, shifting closer.
"Sure," Harry said, with a laugh of his own. "He was a Muggle writer."
Potter looked liked he was going to fight this for a moment, then gave in. "All right. I will. If you want me to."
Scorpius looked at Draco again. "Come back," was all he said, but Draco heard the tightness in his voice.
Malfoy hesitated. "Would you stay with me tonight? I just don't want to be alone. I can't sleep."
The door opened, and someone who was not Malfoy appeared. He looked somewhat familiar, but Harry couldn't place him. "Can I help you?"
Current legal status: Not charged; file to be closed
He cast a Shield just in time to send Potter's hex back at himself, where it melted in the air before touching him. "Malfoy," Potter said through clenched teeth, "I am going to give you five seconds to get out of my suite. Five, four, three - "
"We're showing you some of your weaknesses," Shacklebolt said. "If you can prove to us that you can deal with your issues sufficient to the task, as we see it, of becoming a fully qualified Auror, then you're on your way. It is difficult for most people, though. As we said earlier. It requires a level of self-honesty that most people don't want to get into. It's not comfortable, looking at ourselves on the deeper levels. I think this is a deep-seated issue for you that probably extends all the way back throughout your childhood. It's perfectly understandable: your father was a Death Eater, you were born in the same year as Potter, went through Hogwarts with him as his rival and, by pure circumstance, his natural enemy. Until you left your family, of course, but by then, the two of you had developed a bad history and it's never been resolved. If you pass your character testing, I won't lie to you, Malfoy. You'll be one of the Ministry's top Aurors and we'd be privileged to have you. Potter is one of our very best and if we can't trust you to comport yourselves professionally together, then we simply can't have you on staff."
In his dream, Harry broke out in a cold sweat, something that had not happened since the war. He scrambled for clothing and cursed his fingers for having slowed over the years. He had not had an alert like this since… he didn't want to think about it. Somehow, he got dressed. There was no time. The bedroom dissolved around him, and he was back in Little Whinging, and he was fifteen again. He saw the smoke even in the dark, and it was not at Number Ten, as the fragment of his mind that was still conscious that it was just a dream was suggesting. It was Number Four.
"All right. Nothing special." Moodily, Harry turned off the laptop and put it away. "What have you found?"
Subject: Hello
"Interesting," Hermione said, looking thoughtful.
Hamish Reid
"Indeed." Unexpectedly, Malfoy leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek. "Good night, Potter."
Malfoy winced. "I guess I wouldn't mind one."
Potter flushed and didn't answer. It occurred to Draco that despite the embarrassment, Potter actually looked a little intrigued despite himself. Well. That was certainly interesting. Despite his heavily suppressed imaginings about Potter, Draco had honestly believed that Potter was as straight and vanilla as they came, hence his choice in spouses. Still leaning against the counter, he jerked a chin in Draco's direction and said, "So, talk."
"Of course," Daley said impatiently. "But what are we supposed to do? Are we safe if we come to the Order's headquarters? We fear there may be spies even there."
"Okay." Potter's eyes closed and his head tilted, and Draco kissed him. After a minute, Potter turned around and slid his hands down to Draco's arse. Not trying to instigate anything, just rubbing gently as they kissed. Their hips were very close together and Draco was half hard by the end of it, but there was no rush. He felt good.
"It doesn't feel right," Harry said, opening the cupboard above his head to put away the glasses. "I don't know what it is, but I just have a bad feeling about it."
Her eyes bored into him. "Where have you been?" she asked, very coolly.
Draco shook his head. "That's one of the things I'm going to try to find out."
Draco walked a short way around the lake, hands shoved deep into the pockets of his pea coat. The wind scuffed the surface of the water into rough, choppy waves. The sun was shining, but the air sharp with cold. Harry's footsteps crunched through dry leaves just behind his right shoulder and he endeavoured to ignore the sound and Harry both.
"I'm not - I don't - yes," Harry said, changing his mind partway through, defiant. "I am. All right? Is that enough of an answer for you?"
Kingsley's lips pursed. "Take Tonks, then. She's familiar with the area."
Hermione was silent for a few minutes, thinking. Harry drank his tea and watched her carefully. She looked up. "This thing with Malfoy," she said, turning her spoon over her hands. "It's serious? It's not just a thing you're doing because you've realised your orientation and he was… convenient?"
There was another brief silence. "Potter…?" he trailed off.
Harry hurried after him, thinking that it almost worked. Almost. It looked a little like Malfoy was trying to imitate Marcus Flint or someone larger-boned than himself. Well, Malfoy was larger-boned now, but somehow it still didn't quite fit. "What am I supposed to call you?"
* * *
Harry almost laughed. Malfoy caught it and gave a wry smile. "True enough," Harry said.
"Have you indeed?" The amusement grew. "So how long did it take you to discover that this was not one of the Order's safe houses?"
Draco didn't pull his hand away, but he turned back toward the wall. "Forever, Harry. I can't even remember. Seventh year at least. If not first year. Always, in other words."
He made his way quickly down the staircase, through the halls and down more stairs until he found himself in the guest wing once again. He knocked at Potter's door and got no response. He knocked again. Silence. He checked the time; it was only a little after ten. Potter would still be up. He knocked again. Potter was ignoring him. Draco deftly applied an unlocking charm coupled with a ward disabling charm (another handy privilege he'd learned that came with being Headmaster), and the door swung open precisely one inch. He stealthily pushed the door open until he could see where Potter was.
"Maybe it did, or would have, but they never came into physical contact," Harry said.
"That makes sense: Draco was never painted," Dumbledore said with a smile. "He should look as real as a photograph."
"Was he?" What was Malfoy inferring?
The comment took Harry by surprise, and he had to spend a minute searching for the sarcasm. There was none. "Uh, thanks," he said.
"I owe you," Malfoy said, his voice low but unwavering. "I know that. You know that."
"What, exactly, did you mean, then?" Harry stared at him, waiting.
"I think so. Did it come?"
"And Ron knew?"
"Be careful, all right?" Harry said. Malfoy set his cup down and got to his feet; the meeting was over. "This is big stuff, like I said. These are seriously bad guys behind this. Don't get yourself hurt or killed."
Susan frowned, clearly not liking this breach into her territory. "I'll see what I can do."
Malfoy's eyes met his, and Harry saw some of his own expression reflected as Malfoy realised. "You don't have your wand?"
Malfoy was smug. "I'm not."
Draco went home, pulled off his cloak and opened his trousers. Not even bothering to take them off, he leaned back against the door of his flat and had one of the fastest, hardest wanks of his life, his fist jerking rapidly up the length of his cock. And as he did so, it occurred to him that he wanted to fuck Potter into the floor, be fucked by him until he was aching, consummate all manner of unnatural and perverse acts with him. His imagination had just raced ahead to the thought of Potter's tongue sliding into him, hot and wet and filthy, pushing against the tight ring of muscle and into his very core when his senses overloaded. He came, the wave of orgasm gripping him in a hot, prickling vise. A second later, the come spattered onto the tiled floor of his tiny foyer. He let his head fall limply back against the door, panting, his hand still circled loosely around his softening cock, and thought over what he'd just actively, deliberately thought about himself and Potter. Together. Really, he asked himself sardonically, but knew already that it was more than a perverse fantasy in the heat of the moment. He did want that. Potter was attractive. He couldn't deny it to himself if he tried. Disturbed by this, Draco went immediately to bed, troubled, and resolved not to think about it any more than he absolutely had to.
Malfoy's fidget was as angry as his tone. "Look, I don't exactly know, all right? I haven't exactly had the time or opportunity to figure it out, precisely, but I - "
"You'd give them, anyway," Harry said, testy.
"Your son," Potter repeated. "How often do you see him?"
"If it's just a hypothetical question, why does it matter?" Draco asked, struggling to control his temper, furious with himself for the hesitation.
Harry gave a slight smile. "Thanks."
"Only when I have to. And it's still wife. We're only separated."
"No door, either."
"You fucking bastard," Malfoy panted, fingers clutching Harry's hair by the fistful. "Do you know how long I've wanted that?"
Draco looked around and found another crate and kicked it over to where Potter was sitting. "I just wanted some air," he said. "You?" It was cool.
"Get over here."
"Our last deposit. It's gone!"
"Ah - I was just asking a question," Harry said with difficulty through Malfoy's talented wrist movements, grinning. "I guess I could do that."
Albus shrugged, or tried to under the heavy grip of Potter's right hand on his shoulder. "There was this man in our portrait, the Fat Lady's portrait, and I asked him what he was doing there. We argued. That's it."
"I have not fought in… a rather long time."
Harry put his sandals back on outside the gates, and Malfoy did the same. They walked a little while longer, just around the outer courtyard, and Harry knew that he, at least, was wondering if he should speak, and if so, what he should say. They passed through the gardens and found themselves alone at the edge of the souq, in a secluded alcove. Malfoy looked at him and deliberately let the back of his hand brush against Harry's. It was all either of them needed to say. Harry's fingers caught Malfoy's. He stepped closer, just waiting for Malfoy to do something, say something to reject him - but nothing was forthcoming. He knew he was going to kiss Malfoy, was certain that Malfoy must know it, too. Harry looked into those grey eyes, turned darker with some unfathomable emotion, and saw it, saw that Malfoy did know it. He closed his eyes and set his mouth against Malfoy's.
The eyes widened in calculated innocence. "Of course not," Pansy said. "Wouldn't dream of it. I'm very discreet. You do your thing, and I'll work the room." She came over and kissed the air near his cheek. "I have to go shopping. You look exhausted. Get some rest."
"I'll do everything in my power," Potter vowed, his voice low and intense. "I promise, Draco."
"Great." Harry went and got it and took it to the potion. The office was so crowded that his cauldron and the one Malfoy was stirring with precisely measured circles were touching. "You're not worried about any of them splashing into each other?"
His voice broke for a second, and Harry was stricken. Unable to say a word, and unwilling to interrupt anyway, he watched Malfoy, his throat tight.
"Ron will be fine, once he gets used to it," Harry said dismissively.
"Good." Potter bent toward him, but something occurred to Draco and he pulled away.
Harry eyed him. "I didn't think that was something you were too worried about."
Toward dawn, Albus' state changed from coma-like to plain sleep, to everyone's relief. Pomfrey bustled about, waking the boy long enough to pour potions down his throat and for Potter to ask if he was all right, nothing more was allowed yet. She then forced Potter from the wing, promising that he could return after he'd slept. In the corridor, Draco looked at him, forgetting everything but this. "You're not going back downstairs, are you?"
"This might be it now," Harry said. He picked up his glass and drained it. "Sad, isn't it?"
Harry had been about to drain his pint and froze at this, the glass just in front of his lips. "Sorry?" His lips seemed to have gone numb.
"It's something. Tell me." Potter was immoveable.
"Are you listening to me?" Malfoy demanded, albeit at half volume. "I'm so ready I could fucking come all over the sofa, Potter - if you still want to fuck me, then I suggest you get a move on!"
"You're not usually this quiet," Malfoy commented eventually, gazing off into the covered alleyways of the souq.
"I don't care," Potter said smugly. "You can go ahead and think whatever you want. But you're not fooling me."
Harry took in the pale expanse of Malfoy's back and tried not to think about it. "We all have our scars from the war," he said heavily, not willing to open the doors on his own. "I guess we all have our own ways of trying to live with them."
Potter flushed even darker. "You've got a lot of nerve, even coming to talk to me, Malfoy," he spat.
"What do you call it, then?" she demanded, hands on her hips.
Record of activities during Second War: None listed
Hermione sighed. "Oh, Harry. I don't know about that. I do think that she thinks she loves you, at least."
Malfoy cleared his throat. "So," he said - and did he actually sound rather uncertain? "I didn't know you were, uh, gay."
Harry didn't know what to think. He genuinely did not think that he was gay. Everyone had incidents like this, surely. He'd just been too busy saving the world back during his teen years when people usually had their experimentation stages. Except that he was married and had children now. It wasn't something he could keep doing. He knew this. Reminded himself of it every time thoughts of Malfoy came up. It was just… that didn't seem to factor into it. Harry knew it was awful, but he did want it. He wanted it enough to call Malfoy (but he didn't have his number and didn't know exactly where he lived) and see if they could get together again. Maybe, some part of his mind was suggesting, he could just see Malfoy a little bit. Just here and there. No one would have to know.
Harry stared at him. "No! I got here first. I didn't know he was going to crash here, too."
Perhaps Snape had been right all along and he had been afraid of trying to find his place in the world now that the war had ended. But perhaps not. Perhaps the road forward had been laid before his feet, and all he had to do was follow where it led.
"Good. I've also noticed that there are four accounts that each transfer money to this same account, but they each make the transfer four times per year, evenly spaced. These transfers always happen in the evening, at 6:18pm. I've been following these two for a little while now. And I just linked another transfer from a single account that occurs only twice a year. I didn't realise until this morning that it was the same account that receives this, because the account has undergone some specific layers of disguise."
"No. I'm concerned for you, believe it or not," Harry said.
"You think one of the portraits will let Death Eaters into the school?" Draco asked. "Is that even possible?"
Ginny shrugged. "You do what you have to do, when your so-called boyfriend won't tell you anything about where he's going or what he's doing - or who he's doing, I should say."
"I've already chosen my method of payment, as it happens," Harry said. He snapped his fingers and the cuff links detached themselves. The shirt was shrugged off, trousers removed equally quickly, socks thrown into a corner and Malfoy's eyes made him feel trebly nude, somehow. He liked it.
Harry joined him on the sidewalk. Malfoy turned east and started walking at an easy pace. "You have an office in Muggle London?"
"And it's already 'we'. How sweet," Snape sneered. "How convenient that you found a way to keep him in your sights at last."
Just in time, too. Malfoy pulled it closer, then vomited. There was a moment's pause, then he was sick again, and crying at the same time.
"That won't make you any less kinky, you pervert," Draco said comfortably. He settled back into his seat, apparently satisfied with himself and content to sit quietly until it was either his turn to drive again, or until the next urge hit. Whichever happened first.
"It's getting good," Draco cut him off, going over to the monitor. "Oh God, Potter, come and see this. Where did you find this?"
"Isn't that classified?" Draco asked, with a sidelong smile.
Malfoy looked at him for a long moment. Harry wondered what he was thinking. Then he shrugged and turned away, setting the spoon back on the counter. "Have it your way." He looked back at his cauldron. "Oh good, the blue is coming through." He sighed. "That means the break is over, sadly. Everything else is just about to come to the crucial point."
"Fuck you."
"That's right. A girl has to get her shopping done sometime. Seriously, Potter, I need groceries. That's last, though."
"That's not true."
Harry hesitated for a moment, then agreed. What did he have waiting at home, anyway? "Okay, I guess so."
Malfoy considered him for a long moment, eyes narrowed thoughtfully. "I heard you were in the closet," he said, without venom.
that he works a lot. I told him I knew what that was like.
Malfoy's startled eyes flew open. He appeared to be at a loss for words. "… Potter - I - " he stopped, his breathing too fast. "But you - "
"I know. Anyway, he was trying to buy fruit at a stand outside this store, and some teenagers came up and tried to mug him."
Malfoy's heels were making light tapping sounds on the concrete, and apart from steadying himself on Harry's arm now and then, he seemed to be doing quite well. Harry kept stealing looks at him. Malfoy's facial features were exactly the same. Maybe his shoulders were a little narrower, maybe not. The décolletage looked quite impressively real, but obviously that was a glamour. His legs might have been the same, but they were bare and smooth. Harry wondered if that was a glamour, or if Malfoy had actually waxed them. He was bursting with curiosity, but not about to ask. Harry dragged his eyes away from Malfoy's breasts and took in the French tips on his nails, the traces of make-up on his eyes, mouth, cheekbones, smelled the light, floral scent of whatever perfume Malfoy was wearing, and was beyond impressed.
"What, be a git?" Harry asked, snorting. And trying to deal with the fact that Malfoy was gay somewhere in the back of his mind at the same time. So that was what he'd meant, about having been to the clubs before following Harry there.
There was an elaborate shrug. "Why not? Nothing better to do."
"I am Headmaster of this school," Draco said. "Duty calls."
"Death Eaters," Harry said, hatred lacing the bitterness in his voice. "Everywhere."
Potter shrugged. "Seemed polite to ask. Sabine, was it?"
"Bullshit." It surprised them both.
"I don't know if that's the word for it," Harry mumbled. The reality of what had just happened hadn't set in at all yet, but when it did, he was quite sure that there would be a serious headache. At the very least. He hadn't left. He had let this happen, gone through with it. And if he'd had the chance to go back… he probably would have done it again. Harry couldn't make himself feel anything, not shame or regret or relief or anything.
Ron came over then, clapping Malfoy on the back, leaving Ginny to slip around them to Harry. Harry had already hugged her in greeting and said hello, and it felt stiff on both sides. "So," he floundered. "Good month, then? Glad to be back?"
Malfoy studied him. "You thought I wouldn't want to keep this up?"
"Maybe I'm only allowed to use Muggle disguises," Malfoy said. "Wigs and cosmetics and such. Different clothes. But glamours for the rest of myself, at least if I'm interpreting this correctly."
"Not with the recent quittings," Harry agreed. "Well. I don't know what to say. Does he talk to anyone?"
Malfoy elbowed him. "It's not a complex. I happen to be a good agent."
Draco reacted just in time, ducking the ill-defined jet of what looked like red paint sailing toward his heart. He cast a non-verbal Stunning spell back at Lucius. The spell worked, but Lucius side-stepped it. Draco noticed that his own blast was as clear as it should have been in real life. Over his shoulder, Dumbledore cast a blue jet of something at a figure crouching behind Lucius with his wand trained on Draco. It caught him and he fell sideways.
Both Disillusionments faded. Potter let go quickly enough, but not so quickly that Draco hadn't had time to register Potter's closeness, his heat, his magic sparking in his veins with excitement, his hips colliding with Draco's in a way that was anything but painful. It was as exhilarating as the victory, little though Draco cared to admit it to himself. His body memorised the feel of it instantly and he knew that he was aroused by it. He let go awkwardly and Potter looked apologetic.
Malfoy sat back and stared off across the flat. "In a way, it's no different than what anyone else went through in the war," he said. "But in other ways, it is. I've never talked about it with anyone. Not a soul. Maybe that's part of it all, that it's all still just a muddle inside my own head and it seems more nightmarish specifically because I've never cared to drag it all out in the light of day, as it were. This is probably therapeutic."
"You think a Death Eater could influence a student," Draco reiterated.
"How many letters?" The smug bastard didn't sound even moderately chagrined.
He sort of hated it when Draco got all frank about stuff like that. He did that now and then, usually to unbalance Harry, as it was so rare that he was that forthcoming about anything. "I'm not hung-up," he said tensely.
"Why would they have told you?" Harry burned with indignation.
Kingsley's smile acknowledged the unasked questions, and he stood. "Thank you." The door opened and closed and he was gone.
"Really?" Harry was intrigued. "How do you do that? I can't see my own? How that does work?"
Susan was shaking her head and turning pages in a very large appointments book. "I don't know, Harry," she said dubiously. "I just spoke to Kingsley yesterday, and he said that the number of unreported Death Eater movements is growing, not decreasing. You're the Department's top Auror, or one of them, at least, and I don't know if you can be spared that long."
"Dare I ask what's first? Do I want to know? You're not - " a horrid thought struck Harry - "making me go lingerie shopping with you, are you?" He had momentary visions of Malfoy dragging Harry through an Agent Provocateur, laughing himself sick at Harry's awkward pawings at various bits of silk and lace.
Harry picked up the last of the pots and began to dry it. "Not really," he said. "Move out, obviously. I don't know what else after that."
"I'm in potions," Malfoy said. "I supply quite a few of the stores and distributors around Britain."
Harry hesitated, weighing options. He knew Malfoy well enough to know that he was not about to budge on this. He got up and walked a few steps away. "I didn't think I would even see you again," he said, looking away.
On the third day, Harry caught Malfoy's silent, accusing look, which he glimpsed for the briefest of moments over his shoulder as he left the kitchen when Harry entered, and, finally driven by his curiosity, he took his tea back to his desk and picked up the one report he had not yet even looked at within the past six weeks.
As the sleep cleared from his brain, Harry realised that the boy's lip was trembling. He sat up and patted the sofa beside him. "Come up here."
"Of course it is. But there are still people who would say that."
Draco blinked. "He stole your broom?"
Harry had looked up over his glasses, frowning. "It's still the best and pretty much only way to get the news," he said reasonably.
* * *
It was two nights later when Ginny initiated something. She turned onto her back when Harry got into bed. He had thought she was sleeping.
"No?" Draco let his brows rise. "Tell yourself whatever you like. That's what it looked like to me. If you were so in love with her, then how is it that you're not satisfied with her? Did she stop putting out after your first one was born?"
"No - " Malfoy was struggling - "I'd say rather a lot, in fact - God, Potter, where did you - I think you should fuck me now."
Malfoy was quiet. Then he said, "I'll make you a deal, Potter. I said I didn't want to talk about the drinking thing. You don't want to talk about the getting off together thing. If you're actually genuinely concerned about me and want to be friends, then maybe we should talk about both. If you'll talk about your issues, I'll talk about mine. I'm making a rather large offer here. I wasn't brought up to discuss personal problems with anyone, ever. That's more your style than mine. But if we're going to be friends, then I think we should either cut the bullshit and do it properly, or else you should go home and forget about me. Leave me to my demons and I'll leave you to yours, and no one will talk about anything. What do you think?"
A mean voice in the back of Harry's head made a gleeful sound. The other ninety-five percent of him really wanted to get off, however, so he ignored it, shaking his head. "It's okay, Malfoy. I don't care."
"I don't have anything," Harry said. "Are there any extra things here, like toothbrushes and shampoo and stuff like that? Towels? I don't even have a change of clothes."
Malfoy made a sound of negation. "Not fluent. I just get by. It happens when you're living in a place." He looked around them with appreciation. "This is my favourite month to be here, though. Tishrin al-awal."
"What?"
"Not to my home. Your home."
"Maybe they would mind it less than we think," Harry said, very seriously. His eyes were intent on Draco's. "Maybe next year, we should see them off together. As the family we are, instead of the families we used to be."
"How could that happen? I understood that magical portraits were all registered." Snape hadn't lost the pose of boredom, but he did seem to be paying better attention.
"She was my wife, Malfoy!" Harry said furiously. "Maybe in your family, no one ever talked to each another, but that's not how I thought marriage was supposed to work!"
"Do you want to go out somewhere?" Malfoy scratched his head and yawned. "I'm hungry. Or I will be after I shower."
Malfoy looked at him sharply. "Why?"
"Meet us in the conference room in the Auror Department," Shacklebolt said. "We'll spend the morning reviewing your personal information and so forth. It will work like an interview, at least at first. Let's say two o'clock."
Harry didn't answer. He stirred his tea rather vigorously.
Harry couldn't quite contain his amusement. "What, like sexual harassment or something?"
"What if it matters to me what it's called?" Malfoy's lips compressed. "It matters, Potter."
"It's not up for discussion."
Potter took a long drink from his cup. Was he stalling? He rested the cup on his knee and swallowed. "Er, I think I've made a mistake. I think I've been sending messages I shouldn't have been sending. And, uh - God, I'm really bad at this. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to."
The entrance to the vault was on Harry's side and he clambered out onto the ledge with difficulty, his legs having cramped a little after the long sit. The cloak followed him, leaving Malfoy momentarily visible, save for his Disillusioned feet. Harry held out a hand to him and he took it and stepped far more gracefully onto the ledge, slipping back under the cloak at the same time. The instant his foot left the cart, the cart began to move, rapidly picking up speed as it zipped away down the tracks. Harry watched it go and gripped his broom tighter. "You're good?" he asked rhetorically; he could see Malfoy right there beside him under it.
Potter grinned. "That I'm going to be on campus a little more often now," he said. "That is, if you'll have me."
"Bad break-up?"
Harry turned back on his side to finish his drink, trying not to choke on it and using the time to stall. "How did you hear about that?" he muttered, meeting Malfoy's eyes.
"Don't be ridiculous." Malfoy was sharp. "I suppose it would be a bit ironic to call anything you do selfish, but you do not have the right to wallow in self-pity. None of us does."
Inside, he tried to gather his wits and figure out what to say to Potter. It didn't help; nothing came to mind. On the eighth floor, Potter's, the lift stopped and the doors opened. Potter stood there, his winter robes on, bags of what were obviously gifts in both hands. He froze, staring at Draco. Startled, Draco could only stare back, his heart suddenly pounding.
"I'm sure we'd all like to see a coup, my sweet," her companion sneered. "However, it's not exactly as easy as that, now is it? The question is, how far would you be willing to go?"
"No, I do," Harry said, rather more forcibly than Draco was expecting. "I'm ready. I already - you know - prepared, in the bedroom."
"What do you mean, he can't play hero?" Ron wanted to know. "It sounds like all he has to do is help Malfoy."
Malfoy looked a tad startled, but took it in his stride. His drawl and feminine swagger returned. "About time," he said airily, and his pace sped up.
Act naturally, Harry lectured himself. He was there to work, after all. He was looking at Malfoy's arse. No, he was not. He pulled his gaze away and cleared his throat. "Did you get your read-outs?"
Harry nodded emphatically, his head somewhere near Malfoy's shoulder. "That it was."
"I hardly think that this is a whole lot more gay than fucking a bloke on purpose," Harry said bluntly. "Besides, I thought you told me to experiment."
There was a long silence. Malfoy appeared to be contemplating the palms of his hands or possibly the faded oriental carpet. After a little while, he said, very quietly, "This will probably make you feel sick, Potter."
"Doing what?" Harry kept his eyes on the long stretch of flat road ahead of himself, reminding himself to concentrate on not driving into the other lane. Though he thought he'd fairly much got that figured out sometime back in Minnesota already. Ernie and Susan's wedding had been in Minneapolis, and they'd had the brilliant idea to not only go, but actually see some of the country while they were there.
Neville coughed. "Uh, we got our clearance, Harry," he said, into the brief moment of ensuing silence. "We can go back to St. Mungo's today."
"Two weeks and counting," Malfoy said, looking somewhere at the floor between them. "There's a bit of food. Nothing fancy. The range works, though, and so does the refrigeration unit."
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Let's put it this way: if you hadn't voluntarily taken the Mark, would you have been forced to?"
"That's a very comforting thought. Thanks."
"Scorpius," Harry repeated, strongly tempted to laugh. He managed not to. Just. "Who was that?"
"We should do something like this again," Potter said firmly. "A drink or something. Dinner. Whatever." He hesitated, perhaps thinking this too forward, and backtracked. "It doesn't have to be anything formal. Just coffee, even."
"That's why you love me." Draco gave him a rare, sweet smile, then pulled out his wand and began to cast cleaning charms all over the car and themselves. "Besides, now you don't have to go any more. Think of all the time we saved now that we don't have to stop."
"Do I?" The question was cool. "Really."
"Because it was with you, you idiot."
"That bloke in the orange," Potter had said once, leaning in conspiratorially. "Hates his wife but would never leave her. He's too dependant on her inheritance. Plus, he's never learned how to do his own laundry."
"What - is this - ?" Harry looked around and found that he already know the answer to his question. It had to be Malfoy's place. He had assumed Malfoy still lived at the Manor, but perhaps not. Belatedly, he looked at Malfoy's hand and pulled off his own jacket, tucking the invisibility cloak down one sleeve so that he wouldn't forget to take it with him, and handed the jacket over.
Draco didn't look at him, but Harry was standing closer to him than a stranger should have been. He felt Harry stiffen as he perceived Draco's tension. He was as transparent as glass and far too perceptive. Draco moved to the end of the counter to wait for his drink, and Harry followed.
"I know," Harry said, barely paying attention as Malfoy set Lupin's report on Hermione's.
"I know I did."
"Of course," Potter said.
"Yes," Malfoy admitted. "But I was also pretty sure that no army led by you would do that sort of thing to anyone. I know you, Potter. We may have never been friends, but I know you. But I didn't know how to get your attention."
"Maybe," Harry said. "Look, Gin, I'm sorry. I just - it's been a long week and - "
"What?" Harry asked cautiously.
Breathing hard, Harry lay where he was and tried to reason with himself. So, Malfoy was right, perhaps - it was awfully sudden. Perhaps it would be better to take things slowly. That was Harry's problem, in fact. He rushed into things, and then they didn't work out. Perhaps this was the one that was going to work, if he didn't push his luck. He never would have thought of Malfoy, but they were here, and it was happening. And Harry was both excited and scared by the entire concept.
Malfoy's hands were on him, exploring his back, his belly, his arse. Harry grabbed for Malfoy's shirt, unbuttoning it in record speed. He got his mouth onto Malfoy's neck and collarbone, pressing his tongue against Malfoy's pulse point, tasting his skin. Malfoy undid his cuffs behind Harry's back and let the shirt fall to the floor. He went for Harry's t-shirt, hauling it over his head. His thumbs pressed into Harry's nipples, which were hard, and the touch made Harry shudder appreciatively. Malfoy didn't smile at this, but his eyes blazed in a way that Harry had never seen them do before. He put a hand on the back of Malfoy's neck and kissed him again, not holding back at all. Malfoy made a small sound and clenched his arms around Harry's back. Harry was harder than ever, and Malfoy was so close that Harry barely had to move to feel how hard he was, feel the friction collecting between them. Malfoy released his mouth and separated himself a little, bending to place his mouth on Harry's left nipple. His tongue stroked over it, playing with it, and Harry thought that every hair on his body was standing on end. His fingers were gripping Malfoy's hair and shoulder and his cock was doing its best to burst the seam of his jeans.
Harry glared again, but it was purely reflexive by now. To his credit, it had only been after he'd come out to Lupin that he'd been privy to the information that… well. More than practical jokes happened in the Marauders. He still hadn't figured out how that had all worked out in the end, given his existence, but no matter. "I need a synonym for flying."
"Did you have a roommate before?"
"I need to." It was very clear and still very soft. Potter didn't touch him, but Draco found himself standing back to let Potter into the lift. Potter pressed the button for the eighteenth level, the highest. Terse, he said, "Talk quickly."
"Right," Potter said. "Have you ever heard of the subject disappearing completely?"
Harry refrained from saying that Ginny was not his wife. "Good night."
"I know. I saw it." Malfoy held his gaze.
Malfoy's hand relaxed around his and Harry let go once the last white/clear drops stopped winking out. "I did it again," he panted. "So sorry, Potter."
"You should be."
Harry had his back to Malfoy, his arms crossed. He had to break the silence somehow. "I can't believe you didn't tell me," he said dully.
__________________
Harry grimaced. It was not the way he had hoped or expected to go. He knew that Malfoy felt the same way, and sometimes it eased the restlessness very slightly, having someone else with him thinking the same thoughts during the long, dread-laden silences. The moment of revelation Harry had experienced with Malfoy on that second night had not faded, and that was the other thing keeping him going. It was strange, and the strangeness of it had not diminished, but Harry still wanted it. Perhaps it had been latent for both of them, after all. It wasn't important, and Harry didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it.
The task window disappeared and returned Harry to the list of wireless networks. He selected another and tried again. Eventually, it announced that he was connected, though with a very low connection. Harry clicked on the internet icon and waited. A long wait, and then an error message. Harry cursed under his breath and ran a diagnostic scan. The connection was still holding, though tenuously, but his email page would not open. The scan announced a firewall problem.
"No trouble." James gave him a polite smile, then retreated into the office.
"Do you want to talk again yet?" Harry asked, trying very much not to press the issue. It wasn't that he was remotely unhappy with how things were. He just wanted it to be official. Said and known and acknowledged for what it was. He wanted it to be safe to say things like how he felt and how happy he was. But only if Draco was ready to believe him.
Oh, right. That. "Uh," Harry managed, stepping behind Malfoy to allow a knot of people to go by, "not really, no."
"Then why don't you understand?"
"No. Bones."
Harry kept at it, rubbing his tongue along that smooth, hardening nub. Malfoy was gasping and moaning and lifting himself to meet Harry's tongue when out of nowhere, something changed. The nub was growing - growing quickly, Harry realised, the thought happening so fast that he barely registered it. Malfoy's body was changing, and Harry's mouth was suddenly full. In shocked realisation, he pulled his mouth off Malfoy's cock - Malfoy's hard, jutting, reddened cock, bobbing just in front of his face. Harry couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. The glamour had faded entirely; he was looking down at naked Draco Malfoy in all his glory. The breasts remained, but below the belt, his body had resumed a strictly masculine form.
He was drunk, the words overly pronounced. It was the same way he spoke himself, when he was trying to hide his state from Ginny. Or Hermione. "Just a bit of work, actually, but I was planning to call it quits soon."
"No." Potter was definite. "Not Snape. He wouldn't have let them in."
Harry didn't know what that meant, so he didn't say anything. Outside, it thundered again, shaking the walls of the monastery-come-hostel ever so slightly again. The silence grew between them, there in the dark. A long time seemed to pass, but Harry was sure that Malfoy was still awake.
Malfoy suddenly stopped and turned to face him. There was a long silence. They were almost exactly the same height, Malfoy gazing at him at eye level for a long moment, probing. "You may be the only person alive who is, then," he said.
______________
Harry made himself nod, his glasses slipping down his nose, his back to Malfoy.
Harry moved closer and kissed him on the cheek, the chin, the mouth. Malfoy allowed it and responded in kind. "I don't know if I wanted to know back then, either. But maybe I did. I don't know. I want it now."
Harry's cock gave a nudge of interest at this. "Like… this?" Harry asked carefully, not sure how to put it. "I mean, with you… like this?"
__________________
Malfoy got up. They walked to the door together. Harry put his shoes on and turned to face Malfoy. Malfoy looked at his mouth, but all he said was, "I'm glad you came over."
Harry gave him the tube, but only after he'd squirted some out into his hands. "Are you showing me what I have to do now, or what?"
"Don't be." Malfoy was brief. "It's for the best. And we had Scorpius, whom you clearly know about from your son. He's a lot like me, but a lot nicer, I would say. A better kid than I was. Then again, it would be hard not to be."
Harry got to his feet, too. "No, I'd like to see if I can find a book that will teach me some Arabic or something."
Malfoy smiled. "Sure is," he said, and things felt slightly more relaxed again.
Malfoy was lipping at his neck, tongue stroking, but he froze at this. He didn't move away, but he'd gone completely still. "What did you say?"
The instant Potter's fingers touched the cold iron of the key, Draco took it with his other hand and activated it. The tug of the Portkey pulled them together, legs bumping. He hoped Potter wouldn't think that had been intentional. He knew how Portkeys worked. They arrived seconds later outside the Chudley Quidditch pitch and Draco rapidly sheathed his fingers again, stowing the Portkey back in his pocket.
"Yes." Malfoy agreed. He paused, then looked at Harry critically. "So, after we've found the other five, then what?"
Malfoy's hand tightened its hold, his hips closer to Harry's arse than they should be, heat gathering between them. Harry missed whatever the woman said back, his focus distorted between Malfoy and the cashier telling him his total. He found his wallet and paid, took his groceries and went to wait for Malfoy at the end of the counter, ignoring the voice in his head that was telling him to just leave.
"That you do," Harry said shortly. "I'll see you later." He closed the phone. He paused, thinking, then changed out of his jogging clothes and into his oldest jeans and a comfortable shirt. He told Ginny something vague and Disapparated before she could ask too many questions.
Nonsense. He dropped the paper as though it had personally offended him and drained his cup abruptly. If Potter was finally seeing the light after all these years, what did it matter to him? He'd always had his suspicions. And all right, honestly, perhaps there had been a few thoughts in that direction during school, before life had exploded and left no time for the ill-conceived fantasies of a closeted adolescent, no time for self-searching, only choices too large to have time to properly think through. Another thing at which he'd failed miserably, but he'd decided to let that go a long time ago. Perhaps the world would never forgive him, but people forget. It was his one saving grace. He'd come to terms with it, which was to say, he'd stopped thinking about it. There had been the occasional period of remorse and stricken realisation in the small hours of the night, followed inevitably by long bouts of sleepless tossing, turning, and a good deal of well-aged wine. Those days were over, for the most part. He'd let it go.
Draco eyed him. The blankets had settled around Harry's middle, revealing a nicely toned chest. There was no grey glinting in the stubble on his jaw. Yet. That would come, and likely soon enough; Harry's dark hair would show it much more quickly than his own. But he didn't have any grey hair, nor did he want to think about getting it. There wasn't much way to gauge how long that would last; Lucius had died before he'd had the chance to go grey. Never mind. Old history. Besides which, they were only thirty-six. Hardly time to obsess about these things just yet. Draco got up and arranged himself on the bed fully clothed, on top of the blankets, facing Harry on his side. "You'll be okay," he repeated. "You'll miss him. Of course. But you'll be so excited to see how he likes it. You'll probably write him so often you'll embarrass him."
"We all are, Harry," Lupin said, still watching him with concern.
"What? Is it work-related?" This meant an automatic non-answer, but if it transpired that Potter was also attending the Ministry fundraiser, then awkward questions would surely be asked.
"I should know," Malfoy said.
Malfoy processed this, looking as though it weren't much to his liking. "You have broader shoulders," he said. "I could probably pass for a woman if I tried."
Harry would have glared back, but it hurt too much. "I don't suppose you have anything in the way of first aid on you."
"Sure," Potter said. "Why not? They're the first team I got familiar with, thanks to Ron."
Malfoy cut him off. "I should have said 'us'. I'll go with you. Let's go." He nodded toward the West gate. "We'll have to go through the souq and around the mosque, but then it's not far to the other side."
"Or the Apparition won't work with the Fidelius. Right." Harry headed for the door, double-checking to make sure his wand was in his back pocket as always.
"None of those counter the gay part." Malfoy unlocked the stall door. "I'll see you around, Potter."
"Water," Harry said.
There was a pause. "Yeah, I guess I do," Malfoy said.
His vision returned to normal and he was gasping, ravaged by the force of his orgasm. But he still wanted Potter within him, and knew that Potter had to be gagging for it by now. He allowed Potter to release his cock and pulled his legs up to his chest. "You want me like this?" he asked, still breathing hard.
Annoyance and desire warred in Harry's brain, as well as other places. Desire won out. "If you say so," he said. He got up and Malfoy dragged himself onto the bed properly, propping himself up on his elbows to watch him. Harry finished unbuttoning his half-open shirt and dropped it on the floor, then went back to the bed. He resumed his position straddling Malfoy's hips and said, "You're far too dressed for this. Can't have that." He began to unbutton Malfoy's shirt, very slowly.
It was true. He got too many of the hardest, most dangerous assignments, and when he was younger, it had frustrated him to be protected by the Order and the Ministry. Now he was older, and he was finished with war.
Harry was still holding Malfoy by the shoulders, his warm bare skin under his hands. The Apparition drew him a little too close to Malfoy for comfort and when he opened his eyes to find himself in the main room of Malfoy's apartment, he moved quickly away.
"Parts of it," Hermione said cautiously. "Is that still… you haven't made up?"
"Okay," Harry said again, wholly unsure of himself, but strangely sure of Malfoy. He followed Malfoy's fingers until his cock was pushing against Malfoy. It felt too small, too tight for him. "Are you - is this - "
Harry was pleased with himself, evidently. "More fun that way," he said wickedly. "I think it's better if - " he slapped again - "you're not expecting it."
He saw only the two forms, and thought that Dudley must have moved out some time ago. Where would he be? Would someone notify him? Harry had no information on him, had never looked for it or cared to know. He drew a deep breath and noticed that it came with difficulty. Shock was beginning to seep in past the numbness. "Did anyone see anything?" he asked the nearest person to him.

Draco looked at Potter and Potter took a step forward and kissed him in front of all of the portraits. "I'll be with you from here," he whispered. "Go."
He got up and went downstairs.
"It's not raining now, is it? I'm stuck in an office all day, so now ocean-going for me, and I'm allergic to nori."
"Are you currently employed?" she pressed, quill hovering over her notebook.
"I mean it's getting to be night again."
There was a truncated yell of surprise and a crash as something heavy fell to the ground. Draco, heart pounding, pushed gingerly through the brush and peered at his prey. A large human male, nearly two meters in height. Or length, rather; the man was sprawled on his front. The backs of his hands revealed him as non-Caucasian, and Draco recognised his stalker. Swiftly he knotted Incarcerus spells and formed a magical net, preventing escape. "Accio wand," he whispered, and held out his left hand to catch it. Satisfied, he sent up a shower of blue sparks.
"No, I think I could - " Malfoy stopped talking, frowning, and took his wand out of his pocket. "Thank God I still have this. It was darker before, and I used it for a lumos. I think it must be morning now or something." He spoke quickly, and even as he spoke, the wand was moving. The incantation followed, and first a small glass, then a thin stream of water appeared, the latter tipping out of Malfoy's wand. The glass hovered in midair, rotating as it filled, and then Malfoy took it and gave it to Harry, conjuring a second glass for himself.
"Anything longer than five minutes on this ledge would be unbearable," Harry said. "Well, uncomfortable, at least."
Harry was trembling in the effort of controlling himself; this undid it all and he was gasping, his hips pumping rapidly into Malfoy over and over and over again and Malfoy's fist was going so fast it nearly blurred. It felt so good he had to clench his jaw to mask his shout when his body seemed to explode into Malfoy's, the come speeding out of his cock on one long, hard thrust, and it kept going longer than it usually did, too. It was the best thing he had ever felt. Malfoy came a second later, his face strained as the come shot onto his chest and stomach. There was something about the whole thing that felt strangely virginal to Harry, though it really wasn't all that different. And yet it was entirely different and new. And incredible. He looked at Malfoy's face, and Malfoy was watching him, breathing hard.
Unwilling, not unable, Harry thought, still held in Malfoy's rigid clamp.
Malfoy turned and walked away from the door, collapsing into his desk chair. "Because I have no life, apparently. I'm working, Potter. What are you doing, besides checking up on me? Don't you have a wife to go home and fuck?"
"He's a childish sort of person."
Not looking, Harry touched it gingerly. It hurt. "And why would I have any of that?" he asked acidly. "It costs way too much to just carry around for no particular reason."
It was late and Pansy had disappeared. Draco had put the time intervening to good use, mingling with the influential and saying the things people wanted to hear. It was so easy, such a simple little game. Pity the rules didn't work on Potter, who had spent the entire ball avoiding him. Perhaps deliberately, perhaps not. Draco only saw him now and then, when then crowd shifted to allow him a glimpse of Potter being talked to by various and sundry guests. Draco took stock of the emptying ballroom and realised that Potter was gone. He cursed under his breath and set his (fourth? Fifth?) champagne glass down and went to get some air. It was stuffy and suffocating in every sense.
"I'm asking if you want to," Malfoy said stubbornly.
"Sure," Harry said. Something in his belly tightened with apprehension.
"What?" Harry tried to jump to his feet, but Malfoy held him down.
Harry shook his head. "You clearly don't know my tastes." He gestured with his cup to the vendor. "Can I have another one?"
"We really are friends. We know him through Bill and Fleur."
Malfoy sounded almost reluctant. "There was a time… you were still seeing that tall bloke with the - "
"But then you wouldn't have been able to join the family," Draco said, suddenly merciless. "You'd have been the only one left out while Weasley and Granger and everyone else entangled themselves in one large, happy family."
"I do think about you. I think about you lots of the time."
"Let's order something," he said.
"I know," Harry said. It was all he said.
"Close enough," Malfoy said, shrugging a thin shoulder. "Banana?" He held one out.
Once again, Harry found himself wondering at the fact that he didn't feel stranger about it. Sure, it hadn't been what he was expecting, but then, neither was he expecting to be hooking up with Malfoy in the first place. It was a combination of drinking a little too much, lusting after Malfoy's female body for days now, that kiss in the alley, and then getting back to Malfoy's late at night with that kiss still hanging between them and Harry wanting so badly to try it again. What happened after that was just a natural consequence of the rest of it. It hadn't meant anything. It didn't mean he was gay, or having a thing with Malfoy. It just meant that he had been attracted to Malfoy's body and that his charm work went astray under great duress. If he hadn't meant it to happen that way, it didn't mean anything. Somewhat reassured by this logic, Harry decided to get up and take a shower. He'd done some perfunctory cleaning up the previous night, but a good shower was in order.
Evening? Harry glanced at the clock. Oh. Definitely evening. "You should get going," he said, frowning. "It's later than I'd realised."
"I'd love the details on exactly what is and isn't glamour," Harry said, glancing down at Malfoy's cleavage - Malfoy's cleavage, he repeated mentally - before he could prevent himself.
Malfoy gave him a half smile. "What about the new order?"
"Good," Malfoy said. "If we're going to be working together for the next little while, it would be a royal pain in the arse if you were going to be a prude about it. I need to know if you're going to take issue with it now."
Harry looked at him for a second, then silently took the bottle. It wasn't even particularly strong, for firewhiskey, at least, but it was still quite potent. He coughed a little, then took another sip. "You're not a loser," he said.
"Really, Potter, I couldn't. The oaths we take aren't just words, you know. I was incapable of telling you this. I shouldn't have even given you the memories."
"Leave them out of it. They're not my friends now, and that's all that matters."
Another hoot, plaintive this time. Draco untied the letter and broke the seal, unrolled it and read. "Thank you," he said. "That will be all. You may return to the Owlery."
"What are you going to do?"
Harry thought he understood. He absorbed it for a few minutes, thinking back over the war years. So much lay back there that he didn't want to understand. It occurred to him that he should tell Malfoy his stories, too. One day. Not the public record stuff that everyone knew. The small stuff. When Neville hadn't spoken to him for over a year. When Remus had been forced to transform the old way because no one could be bothered to go out and buy him his potion because Grimmauld Place had been surrounded. Harry shuddered again, thinking of the shrieking and scratching coming from the basement where they had been forced to confine their friend, lest he devour or infect any of them. He thought of Remus' subsequent shame and refusal to speak to any of them for weeks after, and how he'd risked his life every three months to buy fresh Wolf's Bane while the siege was on.
"I'm not going alone," Harry interrupted. "Come on. Send one other person, at least. That's not fair."
Malfoy's arms came around his back then. He didn't say anything, but clung to Harry like a drowning person catching hold of a life preserver. Harry held him and tried to ignore the natural response from his own body, reminding him that it had been a long time since he'd touched or been touched by another male like this. A very long time.
"I don't want to sit up. I want to die. Are you deaf, Potter?"
"You've already been down there every other day for the past week or two," Malfoy pointed out. "What's one more visit?"
Harry opened his eyes and fought to master himself, get his breath back. "Just a second," he repeated, to Ron.
Harry got it. "You want me to go down on you?" he asked, confirming. Malfoy blushed, to his surprise. "Uh, sure," Harry said. It wasn't his favourite activity, but it seemed only fair, considering, and he could understand Malfoy's curiosity on that score. And it would help him forget that it was Malfoy and make it easier to believe he was just some girl. He pulled himself together and guided Malfoy onto his back.
Harry glared. "None of your business. And it's not beetles, don't be stupid."
"I'm going in," he said stiffly. "Albus, you may return to lunch with your house whenever your father says you may."
Harry. Interesting. He wanted to talk. Draco could envision this already; it would be a long, painful, soul-searching discussion, Potter's words forcing themselves out through all manner of painful confusion and awkward explanations of how it had all been a mistake, how he wasn't ready, and so forth. Draco would drink his drink in silence and wait until Potter's ramblings had spent themselves, then explain as briefly as possible that he wasn't interested in a repeat of the previous night in the first place, and that Potter's self-revelations were wholly irrelevant to him. Potter would be hurt, then embarrassed and angry, then would storm out and normal relations between them would ensue.
"Well, we know who they are," Malfoy said with a shrug. "It won't be hard to find them. I'll get my people on it. You know they won't talk; they can't. I'll put them on locate and detain duty and then you'll take care of their memories and decide what you want to do with them."
"Okay," Harry said, closing his eyes as Malfoy's mouth found his neck, his throat, his tongue and lips and teeth stroking the skin like a newly-discovered sweet, not really caring how they got off, as long as they did. Malfoy's tongue and the pressure of his cock rubbing against Harry's through their trousers was a surprisingly breathtaking combination. His fingers curled in Malfoy's hair and onto his arse, at least until he had backed Malfoy into the wall, which he discovered only when his knuckles scraped against the painted concrete, or whatever it was. His hips seemed to have become independently operated; he was thrusting against Malfoy without any specific thought about wanting to do so and Malfoy was gasping hotly against his neck. Harry's shirt was roughly untucked and Malfoy's warm hands were exploring his back. Harry retaliated by unbuttoning Malfoy's shirt with shaking fingers, only getting about halfway before he was distracted by the sight of Malfoy's left nipple. It was rosy pink and peaked with lust and Harry knew he had to get his mouth on it at once. He did, tonguing it with a fierce enthusiasm that made Malfoy's back arch, his cock moving noticeably in his trousers. Harry wrapped his fingers around it through Malfoy's trousers and rubbed hard. His nipple was firm on Harry's tongue and he pressed it mercilessly, loving the way it made Malfoy gasp. The gasp turned into a shuddering moan and Malfoy came, wet pulses of come suddenly softening his trousers.
"Yes! And it has a tail!"
K. Shacklebolt, Minister for Magic
"I know." But Malfoy was smiling.
Harry saw it and a margarita (Malfoy was playing his role to the fullest extent, after all) and his own pint. He handed Malfoy his margarita and took the other two, going back to the table. He took Hermione's spot again and Malfoy sat down beside him, leaving the other two seats for Hermione and Ginny. Ron sat up and leaned over Harry. "So, those things a real glamour or just an illusion?" he asked, almost leering at Malfoy.
"What about you?" Draco shifted his gaze upward to meet Potter's serious face.
Harry stretched his hands out across the table but didn't take Draco's hands. "You're better this way. A better person."
"I didn't sleep with her," Harry said. "Or any of her brothers, so don't even ask."
Harry didn't answer this; he was pulling a light jumper on over his t-shirt. "Be back in awhile," he said after.
"Some note," she said.
"Do you want to stay here?" Malfoy caught Harry's expression and added, "On the sofa, I mean. You look tired."
Harry frowned in concentration, and for the first time in his life wished he had taken numerology at Hogwarts. "So this one… to complete it, we would need there to be a single transfer happening once per year, or some kind of transfer that happens five times a year. Is that right?"
* * *
Downstairs, Harry went to the desk and unlocked the drawer where he'd been keeping the reports since the other night. Malfoy was the only one in the household besides Snape who had particularly personal information in his report and Harry had just thought it best to keep from the eyes of his bored housemates. He left the drawer open and turned to find Malfoy on the same sofa again, and was struck by uncertainty as to where he should sit. After Malfoy's seeming friendliness in the dining room, would it seem rude to sit at the desk, as he had before? Harry hesitated, then made up his mind and went to sit at the end of the sofa. He half turned toward Malfoy, one leg pulled up onto the cushions. "So, where would you like to start?" he asked carefully.
Harry shifted in his seat and re-crossed his legs. To his left, Ron was elbowing Hermione, who was flipping through a small notepad and muttering to herself. Whatever Ron said got him a glare and some sort of pointed question about his own seeming lack of preparation. Harry didn't altogether blame her; it was a big day. But he failed to see how any of their notes could be of any help now. On Hermione's other side, Ginny caught Ron's eye and shook her head.
Harry nodded, face growing hot, and went to view himself. The result was rather surprisingly good, though he didn't feel much more comfortable than he had. He couldn't imagine Malfoy in the faded jeans and Muggle-seeming t-shirt, but both items were well-worn and comfortable, apart from the tightness. Malfoy barely made a sound as he went past the bathroom on his way back downstairs.
"Nothing like that," Harry said quickly. "I'm talking about security videos. Is there any way you might have access to those? I would need about two years' worth."
He was gasping, his vision swimming in a haze of lust and sleep and dizzy need for Malfoy. Malfoy, whose thigh had now insinuated itself between Harry's, pressing into his crotch, leaving his hands free to roam up Harry's side, flitting over his peaking nipples. Harry's body was moving of its own volition, frotting against Malfoy's slim thigh and trying to get his hands on Malfoy's bits. Malfoy made it quite clear that he was calling the shots, however; he forced Harry's hands back, pinning them to the edge of the sink. His crotch pressed into Harry's directly now, and he finally put his mouth back on Harry's and left it there for enough time for Harry to devour his mouth hungrily. Malfoy returned it just as forcefully, his teeth and tongue and lips wrestling against Harry's, their hips fighting together. Then he pulled away again, licking bloodied lips (had Harry done that?). "How hard are you for me right now, Potter?" he murmured, eyes slitted, barely open, his mouth nearly touching Harry's.
"You've got it backwards," Harry said. "I think she was my default for you. Maybe it just took me this long to see that."
"Where was Fred?"
Malfoy was in the living room part of a large, open-concept room where he was standing behind a small table near the corner, holding up a large, half-full bottle of Ogden's Old. "May I?"
Harry bundled himself into his own and closed his eyes. He was asleep almost instantly, a deep, sticky, confused sleep that swam over his brain for hours as his exhausted limbs sagged in relief.
"This is good wine," Malfoy said approvingly. "Nice and spicy and peppery, like a good Shiraz should be. And I'm not a woman, and you know it. That's what makes the difference. And my disguise didn't mean you had to enjoy it so much."
There was a whisper of cloth, and then a couple of steps. Malfoy found the edge of the sofa and prodded Harry in the arm. "Move over," he ordered.
"You went back to the souq?" Harry asked, almost hurt. "Without me?"
The previous day, he'd managed to see twelve of the twenty-eight people he'd been aiming for at the Ministry. Some had been in appointments, some had been off sick, and some had simply not been around. He'd made arrangements with a few, but as with most bureaucratic types, Harry was finding, it was easier to pinpoint many of them if he simply showed up and asked for ten minutes or so. He made a list of people he had not yet been able to see, despite repeat visits.
"I never did," Harry said. "But that's the assignment."
Harry managed a bland smile. "Not quite," he said. "I've been waiting for you."
"Which one is yours?"
"When you're at work?"
"Close, but not qu - that! Dr - oh!"
"It's easier if we don't," Harry said warily.
Harry cleared his throat. "You won't need to. So, about this working together. Where do you propose we start?"
Draco closed his eyes. "Do you mean a picture of me, or one of the portraits?"
He did. He did know, but still. "You can't expect one person to be your everything," Draco said, looking back at the water. "That's too much to ask."
Potter shot him an irritated look. "I know you just love to help, but listen for one minute. Every student in this castle is in danger, including my son, who was attacked in some way Pomfrey still has not identified - my son who is your namesake. I've decided, therefore, to let you help a little more than the others. We're going to use your portrait as the entrance."
