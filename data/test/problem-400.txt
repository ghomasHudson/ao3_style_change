Harry picks up Malfoy and his luggage, that one single trunk packed with seemingly everything he owns, on Sunday morning. Malfoy’s waiting for him, wearing robes again, this time in a soft cream, which, coupled with his peaches-and-milk skin tone, spun gold hair and heavenly scent, nearly sends Harry keeling over down the stairs when he opens the door.
Harry, lounging against the wall, only had his fly hanging open, pink cock nestled soft and thick amidst the damp black curls. He watched Draco with the faintly heated gaze of a person still seeped in post-orgasmic lassitude and when Draco held out a hand meant to help him up, Harry grabbed it and nuzzled his face into the soft palm.
And then Harry was right behind him, his arms slipping around Draco’s waist, his cock pressing against Draco’s lower back, rubbing gently.
Draco had seen that tattoo seven years ago for the very first time and since then had never failed to find it – and every other tattoo on Harry’s body – rather exceptionally beautiful every single time he stared at it for more than a few seconds.
,” Draco brays right into Ron’s ear when he finally stops struggling and just sinks back onto his stool, his face still beet red, is expression somewhere between resigned and endlessly amused as he sips on his beer and pretends like there isn’t a blond limpet stuck to his side. “
“Get out of my way!” he bellows just as his magic spikes and the pane of glass of the display window behind him cracks and shatters. The crowd gasps and Harry turns blindly to head back into the shop, tripping over his own feet and falling forward, his purchases tumbling to the ground as he sticks out both hands to catch himself.
I’m just turning down the speed on the treadmill from a fast jog down to a steady walk when I hear the clatter of the dumb bells being handled behind me. I wait until my heart rate slows, pulling off my glasses and wiping my face, vaguely wondering who else is in the gym on Christmas Eve. The place has been deserted all week. I hop off and chug some water before edging around the cardio equipment to peer into the weights section.
Hermione is waving her wand again and then there’s a sudden low, speedy thrumming filling the room, at which point Hermione flashes Harry a quick grin. “That’s a nice, strong heartbeat right there, hear that?”
“We’ll get there,” Hermione assures him, no particular inflection in her tone, but that knowing glint back in her eyes. “What else, Malfoy?”
“Yeah, whatever,” Harry says miserably, burying his face in his arms. “It’s not as if I’m going to go out and do any better myself.”
They’re eating dinner one Monday evening when Draco’s dropped by after work as usual, Harry hunched over the table, clutching his fork as though it's a spear, barely even eating, gaze dark and troubled. Draco takes small bites of his herb crusted lamb, one wary eye on Harry, feeling anxious and angry and impatient all at once and not knowing how to express it.
Deeming Harry suitably cowered, Malfoy turns back to his parents. “Potter and I have a lot to discuss and marriage is only
He and Granger were the first to arrive and Draco had immediately eyed the wiggling lump under his jumper with a mixture of curiosity and tentative excitement—he’d fallen in love with Granger’s cat over the course of being with Harry and for a whole thirty seconds, Draco had been sure that Weasley had been sensitive and kind enough to gift Harry and him with a kitten.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Potter. Unclench. The children are fine. I have wards up around them. And if you want to find your luggage, you’re headed the wrong way.” He lifted one thin arm and pointed to his left. “It’s this way.”
He belly clenched with a mixture of excitement and apprehension when his gaze squarely met Malfoy’s; he was half-sitting up, his weight resting on his elbows as he gaze-glared at Harry with narrowed grey eyes.
Harry can hardly stand upright for how hard he laughs, nevertheless fishing his keys out and kicking up the stand before swinging a leg over the bike and raising an eyebrow pointedly at Malfoy as he just stands there.
“We’re going to the Hog’s Head,” Harry replied cheerfully, not loosening his grip on Malfoy. “Been a while since I popped in to say hello to Aberforth, anyway.”
There's none of the crazed urgency of the night before – Potter’s hands don’t once turn rough or demanding on Draco – but there’s a sort of unfiltered, insatiable hunger in their kiss, in the way they touch each other, and Draco can do no more than just give into Potter’s mouth, slanting his head and winding their tongues together in a slippery tangle, helplessly drowning in the terrifying euphoria filling him.
Outside, Lily’s crying grows deafening and Draco abandons the rest of his socks before heading to the nursery. Lily is lying facedown on the plushy, yellow carpet, sprawled out much like her other father was a few minutes ago, and is sobbing loudly, blond curls in a loose mess around her head. She has on a diaper, one frilly pink sock and not much else and her small body heaves with each guttural sob.
this way, but fuck, all Draco can do is tighten his arms around his neck and stare desperately at Potter, gaze flicking between his fiery gaze and spit-slicked mouth, and whimper softly as his half-hard cock twitches excitedly within the smeared mess of his come in his pants.
“Okay, Kreacher,” Potter cuts in loudly, rolling his eyes. “Go on, then.” Potter shoots Draco an enquiring glance and Draco, fidgeting slightly and still not entirely sure that he isn’t dreaming, nods. The elf beams and disappears with another loud
Potter emits a throaty cry of some sort as the elastic of his pants catches on his erection which then springs free and, quite literally, slaps Draco across the face. And then Draco is sweeping his hair back and out of the way, frozen in stupefaction at the sight before him.
There were no less than fifty dementors closing in on Harry and the kids now. As they pressed in, more joined them. Prongs was nowhere in sight.
Both of their loud panting freezes into still silence as they inhale in unison and hold their breath, their gazes fixed on where Harry’s cock is nudging at Draco’s stretched rim. Harry bucks his hips forward, pushing the tip in, and Draco fears that he might just pass out before he can feel that aching, satiating stretch of Harry’s cock pushing into him completely. The sudden ravenous desire that roars its presence within him is an ineludible force that demands to be fulfilled, and Draco pulls at his own hair with a sharp bark of impatience.
Before the elf can answer, there’s a faint clatter as the window behind the counter flaps open and a pair of hands appear with a bulbous glass vial, filled with a limpid, azure blue potion. Blue smoke rises up around the potion, filling the empty space between the surface of the liquid and the stopper, the cloud growing denser each time the potion swirls around the vial.
Harry seems to make a visible effort not to lose his temper, his jaw clenching so tightly that Draco hears it click; he hasn’t shaved in a few days now, and has thick stubble that has left deep red patches on Draco’s skin all over – Draco never heals them.
Malfoy blinks, gaze unfocused. “Like... Like the world might end unless you don’t put your whole being into whatever it is that you’re doing.”
“I dunno,” Harry says laughingly, standing up and coming over once more, “magic?” He kisses Malfoy gently, pressing his hand over the curve of his now enormous bump.
“Your hair is different,” Potter says abruptly, and Draco jumps slightly, guiltily training his gaze away from where it was about to slide lower. Face hot, he looks around wildly once before looking back at Potter.
Lily wandered back over and Harry immediately pulled her onto his lap, holding her to his chest. She seemed content enough to sit with him in silence. Malfoy stretched his legs out and unbuckled the strap of his sword, pulling it across his lap so it didn’t jut out anymore.
“Merlin, this department is creepy,” Harry breathes, jogging over to him and throwing himself into a chair opposite Malfoy.
I’ve had him around for long enough now that I’ve managed to recognise him for who he really is and detach that person from who he used to
Potter grins, eyes crinkling up, dimples begging to be filled by Draco’s thumb-tips. “I could call on another Healer if you like, Malfoy—”
Then Harry blinks, sighing softly through his nose, tilting his head on the pillow with that same look of capitulation, hands back near his head. Snapping back to himself, Draco squeezes out a handful of the clear blue lube, richly sweet smelling and cool, rubs it between his fingers to warm it slightly, and folds his hand over Harry’s waiting cock, biting his lip as Harry inhales sharply and arches, mouth dropping open and eyes fluttering shut, trembling thighs falling open as he fucks through Draco’s tightly clenched fist.
It’s not something he’s used to, watching Malfoy dance like that under the strobe lights. Harry’s never been the sort of bloke who enjoys a night out at the clubs but Malfoy had informed him –
“Good morning, Mr. Potter,” said Scorpius when he noticed Harry watching him. Then his eyes dropped to the breakfast Harry was preparing – just for an instant.
Malfoy is nearly incoherent by this point, yelling expletives or simply keening deafeningly, but when Harry reaches down and eases the tips of two fingers just past the furled ring of his arsehole, he emits a rough yowl and suddenly explodes in Harry’s mouth, flooding it with come and thrusting uncontrollably into his throat, whimpering each time his cockhead is squeezed as Harry swallows without complaint.
“I didn’t ruin it the very first time,” Potter sniggers against Draco’s jaw, nipping lightly, “Hell, I barely remember the first time,” he adds as an afterthought, sounding rather morose about it.
“I...was really worried last night,” Draco whispers fiercely, not caring what it means to admit it out loud, his heart currently leaping its way up to his throat anyway. “Don’t
Lucius doesn’t reply at once, staring at his wife in wounded silence for a few beats. “I want to know why he’s here,” he finally says slowly, pointing at Harry as though it needs clarifying that he’s talking about him, “or I want him out of this house.”
“My waistcoat!” screeched Draco, snatching it from Harry and examining the dirt and gunk on it. “My fucking socks!”
Potter also doesn’t seem to be able to stop touching Draco’s belly; one or both hands constantly smooth over the hard bump, stroking down the curve of it and caressing it with what can only be described as reverence. He seems to be almost in disbelief that he’s touching Draco, touching his stomach, as is clear by the way he keeps breaking the kiss to gaze down between them at his own hands working gently over the bump.
Potter either ignores, or doesn’t seem to notice, any of that. “Thank you,” he says softly, almost in a whisper, looking at Draco with wide, shiny eyes, expression tender and almost disbelieving. “That...means a lot Ma—Draco. Thank you.”
But Potter doesn’t seem offended at all. “Yeah, I mean, I didn’t want to commit full time, because, well...staying out of the spotlight and all,” he waves a hand impatiently. “So I coach under contract, a few months at a time; it’s just a way to keep in touch with the sport.” He shrugs once more, looking thoughtful again. “It was actually
“Will you go out with me?” Potter asks shyly and Draco just gapes at him like a buffoon. “Malfoy?” he adds worriedly when several seconds later, Draco hasn’t answered him.
Harry emits a choked off sound as his stag erupts out his wand, leaping gracefully through the air and cantering around them twice before galloping off into the Forest.
me out of the Manor!” He’s very loud by now, his hurt and anger blindingly apparent in the way he’s leaning forward and almost screaming, face red and eyes burning.
Draco feels his jaw drop, feels the way his hair tumbles into his eyes when he whips around to stare at Potter. “What?” he breathes.
“So why not this year, then?” Malfoy asks him, sipping on his scotch. “Why aren’t you holed-up in ginger-central?”
“I will be this June,” Malfoy replies shortly, and when Hermione looks up expectantly, sighs and adds, “Fifth.”
For someone who’d been relentlessly stalking Malfoy with the hope of preventing another attack for over a week, Harry was appallingly unprepared when something did finally happen under his ‘watch’.
Scowling, Harry obligingly angles his hips away before scrounging through the files on Ron’s desk. “Piss off,” he grumbles when Ron continues to stare almost
Draco stands up and grabs her elbow when she makes to follow Lucius. “What did you say to Harry?” he asks, now slightly annoyed.
,” Malfoy murmurs, turning his head to regard Harry steadily. “It’s the holidays, Potter, where’s your generosity of spirit?”
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed,” said Harry, “but we’re under threat again. This isn’t like last time when a whole bunch of different magic could be used to fend off the enemy. Dementors can only be kept at bay with Patronuses.” Malfoy stared at him pointedly until Harry added, “And
He could hear faint, indiscernible sounds from the other end now, and after clearing his throat awkwardly, asked, “You okay over there?”
“How are you?” Granger asks softly several minutes later, and Draco jerks slightly, hurriedly closing his mouth where it had been sagging open, licking dry lips and breathing deeply to collect himself, the fairy lights and Potter in his stark black robes still dancing behind his eyes. Granger, however, seems more than willing to let the topic of his birthday go by without further comment and Draco is absurdly grateful.
I don’t say anything. Every single eye on the room is on us. My peripheral vision recognises the shock of red hair somewhere to my left but otherwise, every single cell in me is focused on Draco.
“You’re going to wake up your sister,” Draco sighs lamely, pulling at his collar as he waves him off. He feels frightfully hot all of a sudden; must be something to do with how Harry’s eyes are now
; how Harry thinks Draco is far truer than people give him credit for being, and how Harry considers Draco to be his first stroke of luck since the War, his centre of security and comfort.
Harry can’t get rid of the feeling that Malfoy knows Harry is watching him – it’s probably because he’s now so attuned to Malfoy that he can tell with one glance approximately how many hours of sleep he’s had, whether he’s excited about or irritated with a case that they’re being briefed on, when he’s received a letter from his father, and lately, when he’s missing his mum too much. Malfoy doesn’t even glance his way but Harry just
because Potter is leaning in and cupping his cheek gently. “I know,” Potter says simply, and kisses Draco.
It takes him less than two seconds to realise whom they belonged to and without even a moment’s hesitation, Draco turns right back around to leave.
Potter actually rolls his eyes, the merest hint of an exasperated grin flashing across his lips. “Couldn’t be more wrong even if you
Harry nearly does; he opens his mouth, on the very verge of saying something completely foolish and something he’s consciously refused to dwell on for several weeks now, but reigns it back in at the very last moment, the baby shifting vigorously under their hands.
I freeze. Slowly, akin to a scene in a horror movie, I turn back around to see Draco in front of me.
” Dean groans, thumping his forehead onto the bar, while I have a far more important question to ask.
The flickering light from the fireplace dances across them, making the light sweat on their skin glow orange, and making Draco’s eyes sparkle with the same something that burns inside Harry’s chest. Their noses brush and their breath mingles, Draco shuddering each time Harry’s belly presses against his hard length between them. They don’t need words in these moments, don’t need to speak out loud, but it is in these moments that they’re most honest with each other.
“Right, well, we’ll keep adding notes to your file as we go along,” Hermione gets up and rounds her desk, drawing her wand, “but let’s get that basic physical done first, so we’ll know more.”
They’re both still sniggering when Draco catches Pansy’s eye across the tent. Her expression is almost identical to the one she’d worn a few years back when Harry and he had first fuelled the rumour mill – like she believes Draco is risking everything for something very meagre in return.
Draco goes back to Grimmauld Place with Potter’s freshly brewed muscle relaxants the following Saturday after breakfast. He’s somewhat of a dab hand at muscle relaxants, and he’d even brewed them for professional Quidditch players at one point back when he’d owned his little store in Diagon, and he can't wait to preen smugly as Potter marvels at the efficacy of the potion.
And then their noses brush – for one fleeting second where Draco feels the warm huff of Potter’s breath against his face, the lens of Potter’s glasses cool against Draco’s cheek as they laugh and trip over their own feet, the tips of their noses rub gently together, mouths literally less than an inch away.
asked to meet me, haven’t said a fucking word since I got here, and now you’re insisting on being a right little shit, picking a fight like we’re still fucking eleven.” Sitting back, Harry rakes a hand through his hair with an irritated huff before digging out his wallet. “Tell me why I’m here or I walk,” he says irritably, thumbing through the bills.
Hermione had been on her way back from the library that evening, bag bulging with books, arms laden with more of them. When she’d told Harry about it later on, she said it was pure luck that made her glance into the unlit alcove and spot the pale hand sticking out.
James sat by himself in a far corner, knees drawn up to his chest, crying quietly. When Harry tried to go up and sit with him, offer him comfort, James shook his head and elbowed him away. Helpless and slightly hurt, Harry went back to Lily.
“So I’ve been told,” he finally retorts, eyes gleaming wickedly and I exhale in a rush. “Oh, I have something else.” He suddenly stands up and sets his plate down before digging around in his pocket.
The sun has nearly set now, the crisp spring air turning cool around them as the light fades outside the enormous white tent. Xenophilius Lovegood dances with his daughter under the light of hundreds of fairy lights criss-crossing overhead, their pale hair and skin shimmering. As Draco plucks up two flutes of champagne and makes his way over to where Harry stands, Blaise twirls his mother onto the dance floor.
There was a little gasp and it took Harry a second to realise that it was Malfoy who’d made the sound. Malfoy drew back with a jerk as if burnt again and Harry was left staring down at his lap, still covered with the blanket.
Malfoy jerked his hand out of the way with a little gasp, the look in his eyes now more uncertain than angry.
reluctantly) left Malfoy with his bag and books once they got to the hospital wing, throwing glances over his shoulder as Malfoy, with yet another jerk of pain, perched on the bed Pomfrey ushered him over to.
your father; I’ve seen him actively engaged in service to Voldemort. But I would still not let him be thrown into Azkaban; not now. Not when—” he breaks off when Malfoy’s eyes widen slightly, lips parting and breath catching. He stares at Harry for a long moment, chest heaving in quick pants as his gaze, hopeful and expectant, flicks between Harry’s eyes.
Shoving his glasses on and swinging his legs off the bed (and promptly stumbling as the covers tangled around one ankle), Harry tripped over and lifted the little lid off quietly, suddenly aware of the snuffling breaths being drawn by the occupant of the closed-off bed.
for Malfoy just like he would for Ron or Hermione. When he’d realised a couple of years ago, after inadvertently overhearing Malfoy describe, in vivid detail, a night he’d spent with a date to Pansy (and then smashing his favourite mug), that Malfoy may just mean more to him than just a close colleague, he’d safely tucked it away well out of reach, not brave enough to ever let it be known, or even hinted at.
“You’re fucking mental, you always have been,” he snaps at Draco’s arse as he yanks his hips up off the bed.
“What time does your fan club arrive?” he asks drowsily, nuzzling at Potter’s jaw before he finally pulls away and sits back.
I pull back and reach down to hook my elbow under his knee, lifting his leg higher before pulling out halfway and slamming back in. I instantly know that I’ve hit the right spot because his eyes literally roll back into his head and his chest arches, mouth opening on a silent scream, the sound of it
“So you’re not mad at me anymore?” Harry asked breathlessly as he climbed on top of Draco and immediately grabbed a handful of damp, pale blond hair so he could pull his head back on the pillow and attack Draco’s long, spotless neck.
“Harry,” he reminds calmly, his fingers now moving with slow ease, Draco’s hips jerking with each press into him. “Call me Harry at least when I have my fingers in you.”
Then he becomes aware of the insistent tapping on his shoulder. “Harry,” Draco hisses, sounding impatient and irritated like he usually did when he’d been trying to get Harry’s attention for more than five seconds to no avail.
“He’ll be alright, Harry,” Hermione says softly and for the enth time. “Malfoy and your baby are going to be okay.”
do anything when he behaves badly,” Draco said heatedly despite the fact that he was beginning to feel stupid already.
Draco goes seamlessly from sleep to wakefulness. One minute he’s dreaming about Harry cupping his cheeks and kissing him on the forehead while saying something vague about trapping the moon in Draco’s cauldron, and then he’s slowly opening his eyes to stare into a pair so brilliantly green that he’s completely and startlingly awake in the span of a single breath.
“I’ll help in any way I can, of course,” Potter says quietly, slipping back into his seat and covertly dragging Draco’s seat out for him.
the one strutting about the place waving that thing in everyone’s face – threatening us all with it!”
They would leave as soon as they could; while it was still broad daylight. Dementors were essentially blind so it didn’t really matter to them what time of day they attacked, but the overwhelming majority of their attacks occurred after sundown.
Potter is already waiting for him, staring at the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy and absently fiddling with his wand, rolling it between the fingers of one hand. He’s done away with his school robes, as is his wont, and wears only the white shirt and grey trousers, house tie stuffed into his breast pocket. Behind him, across the corridor, there’s already a door in the wall.
Harry let out a cry as he forced off the tightness being pressed onto him. When he sat up, he saw Ginny’s horse, tall and silver, canter straight at the dementors crowding around them. Had there not been only three? There were so many more than just three now.
, then?” The second the words left Malfoy’s mouth, he turned brilliantly pink, eyes widening before he hurriedly looked down, looking completely mortified with himself. “I—I mean—I...”
They had already been packing when it happened. In fact, they had been on the very verge of leaving when it happened.
“They can’t know, alright?” Draco indicates between the two of them, “They can’t know we’re fucking now.”
“Don’t flatter yourself, Golden Boy,” Malfoy laughs, “It was either here with you, or Pansy’s outrageously cheery Christmas Eve party, and it’s been several years since I’ve actually looked forward to celebrating Christmas.”
Malfoy reached back and gently steered Scorpius forward by the shoulders. Then, just as gently, he pushed him forward towards Harry.
“Will do,” Harry whispers, nuzzling the bite mark tenderly, stroking a hand slowly up Malfoy’s side, over and over, as the quiet settles around them again.
When Harry looked across the street he saw the bloodless face of Mrs. Muller at her own kitchen window. Her gaze was on Harry, not the sky. When their eyes met, she mouthed the word ‘please’ at Harry, her hand pressed flat to the glass.
It feels incredible. Potter sucks cock like a proper slut and Draco wants to stay inside the wet warmth of his mouth forever. It feels like an incredibly lavish indulgence – the Saviour himself sucking Draco’s cock as if he’d rather die than be doing anything else except kneeling in a dirty alley with Draco’s cock going deeper and deeper into his throat with every bob of his chaotic, raven head.
They eventually do make it up to Draco’s dorm room which lies halfway up the spiral staircase that leads out of the common room. There’s a pane of glass next to each bed and the Lake glows eerily green here too, but once they’ve gotten into Draco’s four posted and drawn the drapes, they’re in near complete darkness.
“Pot—” Draco has barely even caught his breath when Potter’s mouth clamps around his once more with yet another hair-raising snarl, Potter using his grip on Draco’s arse to grind them closer, his denim covered erection sliding across Draco’s belly. Powerless and dizzy, Draco kisses him right back, opening his mouth wide and tasting as much of Potter’s mouth as his tongue can reach, breaking away for air whenever Potter’s mouth relents for a beat, trying to push him away by the face but only managing to send his glasses flying instead.
,” Draco laughs. “Potter, do you really see me in the same room as your whole gang of Gryffindors as they gather around you and chant prayers on this holy day?”
Harry ambled over and Draco, despite his fury, reluctantly and furtively admired the way his muscles moved, his various tattoos seeming to dance over his skin. But when Harry entered the kitchen and snorted in amusement – emitting a spray of foam – Draco gnashed his teeth and kicked him in the shin.
, to move in here with him. Potter and he sleeping in the same bed and living like an actual couple, Draco never once feeling like he doesn’t belong here.
The fire crackles, spitting loudly, and Harry is sure he hears a cat purring somewhere in the room as he gives in and meanders over to Draco. The chill from the stone walls and floor seeps into the room, but the fire is a huge, bright vermillion flare, and that along with the ridiculously ornate Christmas decorations dripping from every available surface around the room (with the addition of the sight of Draco in a fluffy, pure white Weasely  jumper, pink nosed and bright eyed, kicking his shoes off and disappearing into the nest of cushions and quilts) lends the room an undeniable, comforting warmth that seems to settle into his very bones.
“I’ve listened already,” he says. “Your boyfriend is a slut. And you need to bring out your fanciest best to keep him interested, yes?”
Malfoy moaned, a short, devastated sound uttered on an exhale, before he muffled the rest into the many layers around his hands. His cock was leaking copiously onto his belly and his toes curled into the sheets with each inward thrust of Harry’s fingers.
“I’m sorry,” Harry croaks at Hermione, staring down at the loop of black in his hand, a few strands of blond caught in it. “I’m so sorry, Malfoy,” he repeats, sounding rather blank as he holds out the band to Malfoy.
Chuckling quietly, Potter pulls them out, popping his hole teasingly and dipping his head to kiss him again, tweaking a nipple with come smeared fingers. Draco simply shudders again, moaning softly against Potter’s neck, batting half-heartedly at his hand.
To Harry’s intense surprise, Malfoy complies without comment, striding forward and folding himself into one of the chairs in front of Hermione’s desk, spine stiff and jaw still clenched.
“I just—” Harry broke away all of a sudden and Draco let his forehead thump onto his shoulder with a tired sigh, reaching back to close his hand over the one Harry had on his arse, holding it firmly in place as he pressed back into it. “I want people to know... you know?”
well.” The silence that follows is thick with hope and seemingly infinite, Malfoy still enough against Harry that he knows he’s holding his breath – almost as though he’s waiting for Harry to continue, to say something further about how Harry feels about him.
“I. Don’t. Care,” Malfoy says, his teeth showing with his exaggerated pronunciation of each word. “We just fuck, Potter, you and I. I can respect that.” He crosses his arms, his gaze glacial as his mouth slowly twists into a nasty little smirk. “And I’m willing to bet
. My lower back aches in the morning just after I wake up, but that’s probably because of the way I sleep. It loosens up over the day; otherwise, I’m fine. Those potions take care of things.”
“How is it weird? This is Malfoy we’re talking about.” I realise it sounds absurd the second I say it – Malfoy hasn’t been viewed as ‘Malfoy’ in a long, long time now.
“Such an arse,” he hears Harry mutter on a laugh, and turns, lewd retort on the tip of his tongue before he abruptly reigns himself in and sticks his face back into his coffee. When he sneaks a glance, Harry is darting him a curious, thoughtful look and Draco feels his face heat some more.
it. The soft, chapped lower lip was now being bitten in a thoughtful manner and when Draco’s gaze finally landed on the piercing green eyes, he realised why.
Pomfrey frowned as she pointedly pushed him back onto the pillows. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy. You’re to stay here and sleep off another dose of this.” She held up a vial of the same sickly yellow potion Harry had downed along with a goblet of pumpkin juice when he’d been brought in earlier that evening with a cracked rib, courtesy a sneaky Bludger to his chest during casual-Quidditch.
“OVER HERE!” Harry pointed his wand at the kitchen where the back door had opened to admit another troop of dementors.
“Okay, you’re going to have to explain at some point what the bloody hell you mean by that,” Draco says irritably, placing one hand flat on the table. “And if you’re talking about how I suddenly ‘turned’ into a Veela, as many others do, let me clarify that I
He can feel Potter’s heartbeat against his own chest, Potter’s breath against his face. Potter’s expression is calm, unruffled, but there is such ravenous
“Shut up,” Draco says quietly, reaching for his wand. Other than briefly turning his gaze to look at Draco’s wand in his hand, Potter doesn’t react. He stays there on his hands and knees, having his arsehole rubbed and petted, his hair falling into his eyes, his lip caught between his teeth as he unabashedly holds Draco’s gaze.
Not paying it any attention, Draco takes a threatening step forward, pleased when Potter’s hand drops from where it was curled around the door and he stumbles back, head dipping again. “Where did you run off to last night?” Draco hisses menacingly.
“I’ll say what I like, Potter,” Draco says, chuckling breathily, one hand reaching down to claw over Harry’s arse cheek. “You going to start moving any time soon? Sometime before New Year’s, perhaps?”
The jug must’ve been self-filling because after Harry drank his own share and put it back, it still sloshed heavily with water. Malfoy was still sitting up, and when Harry pulled back he spoke again, soft and hesitant.
Fingers tightening in the softness of Draco’s arse, Potter yanks him even wider open, a rather frightening, animalistic sound ripping out of him as he spits noisily and then proceeds to just ram his tongue into Draco, pushing his face in harder when Draco squeals helplessly and tears at his hair.
Harry walks right up to him, snatches the wand out of his hand and tosses it across the room, grabbing Malfoy by the wrist and drawing him up flush against him, noses inches apart as he whispers, “Say it again. Say it to my face,
Harry decides to just say it. “I’ve knotted you,” he says very quietly, closing his eyes again as his head spins violently. He lowers back onto the bed and curls around Malfoy, moving his hips inwards so he’s not straining Malfoy’s arsehole, and waits in resigned silence for Malfoy’s explosion of fury and disbelief.
Harry smiles back sheepishly. “Yeah...” he admits, and then frowns a bit. “Doesn’t it feel weird calling the baby ‘it’?”
“Stop, or I’ll make you sour old lemon cake instead,” Harry threatens lightly, waving a bunch of lemons from where he’s standing at the fridge.
“Weasley, do shut up,” he turns around to sullenly snap at Ron. “You sound like a dying, asthmatic whale.”
Malfoy was discreet about his own social life and thankfully managed to stay out of sight of the press, and Harry went only on a few half-arsed dates if and when he could be bothered.
, personally, think it’s been a particularly enjoyable evening, Potter,” he says snidely. “I think we should fuck every full moon.”
“Potter,” Draco says softly, waiting until Potter’s dark, troubled gaze finds his over the edge of his menu, “You hadn’t left that house in nearly six whole months. You barely even associate with your best friends.”
With an even louder laugh, Harry finally aimed and pushed in, not giving Draco time to adjust before completely sheathing himself, and Merlin help his soul but Draco
Draco gasps again, eyes going wide as he starts to struggle in earnest, feeling the first stirrings between his legs. He lifts one knee, angling it at Potter’s crotch, but Potter angles his hips away just in time, and then jams his booted foot atop Draco’s, pinning it in place. Draco
want this, right?” Harry managed to hold off for another few seconds, his cock throbbing in his hand. “Malfoy?”
They’d been together two years before they finally agreed that they wanted to move in together. Draco hadn’t had the courage to say that he’d been ready long before that. Harry had been looking for a place of his own ever since Weasley and Granger got engaged and so when he’d had asked Draco, looking nauseous with nervousness, whether he wanted to look for a place together, Draco had seized the opportunity with both hands (and a foot, for good measure).
Draco blinks, mouth gaping open wider, his mind already stirring in the way one’s did when they’re struggling to place something they know is familiar.
. Nothing even happened.” When Potter continues to stare in silence, quiet and subdued, Draco rolls his eyes. “Other than you eating me open until I couldn’t stand;
going to come watch us from now on?” Ginny murmurs slyly, jostling him with her shoulder. The dwindling light is fast starting to fade now as the clouds get denser, and the rest of the team trudge gratefully to the locker rooms, their brooms on their shoulders, all of them tired and drenched with sweat. Harry blushes slightly but laughs as he returns Ginny’s shove, elbowing her lightly.
“Disputable,” Draco says, taking another sip of cider, but readily accepting the wet kiss Harry plants on his temple. “This has got to be the dullest birthday celebration I’ve ever been to, Weasley, congratulations.”
For a few seconds, Harry was completely certain that Malfoy would once again order him to fuck off. And so when he simply turned around and limped away down the corridor, pausing only to throw Harry an impatient
Harry’s head spins as Malfoy’s scent fills his senses. He can’t think beyond the words Malfoy whispers into his skin, he can’t see anything but the marmoreal perfection of Malfoy’s skin, his limbs long and bare; can’t hear anything but the soft moans Malfoy muffles into the pillow and couldn’t taste anything but the sweet, musky taste of Malfoy’s puckered arsehole, the heated throbbing of Malfoy’s cock in his mouth.
Draco wrenches away, not giving himself time to think as he hurriedly crawls backwards until he’s kneeling between Potter’s legs, ignoring Potter’s squawk of utter shock as he leans in close and rips his flies open, roughly dragging down his jeans and black boxers in one, heaving tug.
“Are we doing this or what?!” Malfoy sounded beyond annoyed as he helplessly arched into Harry’s mouth. But Harry didn’t know how to tell him that he was a tad bit terrified. He didn’t know how to tell him that he’d never done this before. Until, “Have you ever fucked a guy, Potter?”
Hermione lifts a hand to her mouth, eyes round with shock, and Harry pushes himself off the wall, jaw tightening automatically. “Who was he?” he asks, rage seeping into every pore of his being.
Malfoy had smirked and snarked and snapped and scoffed, and had led Harry on a pointless little chase around the place before they’d ended up in a stall right there in the gents’ of that cramped Muggle night club in Wandsworth, Malfoy moaning softly as Harry had pressed him cheek-first to the door and driven into his luscious, wildly jiggling arse with all the force and scorching energy he felt coursing through his veins. He tasted Malfoy’s mouth, his skin, run his hands over the incredible, velvety softness of it; he’d wrapped his fingers around Malfoy’s slender, throbbing cock, had revelled in the sounds Malfoy made as Harry had his way with him, his slim, pale body pliant and willing in Harry’s arms.
“I’m not entirely surprised, actually,” she says with a sardonic slant of her mouth. “Don’t be angry with him about it, though. He likely wouldn’t have told Ron and me either, had I not been his Healer and had access to all his medical information. Hell, some of Ron’s family doesn’t even know yet.”
“Sometimes. There’s a survivors camp some ways from here. The idiots don’t realise how dangerous it is to group together and wail about your sorrows and offer each other hugs and tea. It’s as if they
He fucking hated the Ravenclaw team with a vengeance, having personally lost to them the previous month but he couldn’t for the life of him bring himself to openly cheer on the Gryffindors, and so he simply sat there, spine stiff as a board, expression carefully arranged into bored impassivity, and unblinkingly watched Harry as he flew lazy circles over the pitch.
as he kneels there in piss and putrid garbage, Draco’s erection mere inches away from his wet mouth.
Ron had walked out of the kitchen just then, indignantly squeaking, “Oi! Not in front of my wife, what’s wrong with you?!”
“You’re almost at ten weeks and this is around the time that the foetus starts rapidly developing,” Granger tells them, voice quiet and unobtrusive. “The vital organs have started to grow and function, and although you can’t see it,” she points out the miniscule fingers and toes, “even the nails have started to form.”
? You think that’s going to work on an actual Dementor?! The only way I’d escape would be because the fucking thing would be too busy pissing itself
happened,” Draco is blushing and he knows it and Potter, the fucking creep, gets a rather wicked gleam to his eyes, “but nothing you need to justify or apologise for,” Draco says, face virtually on fire. “Can you
“I consented to being fucked,” Malfoy snaps, straightening up and placing his hands, palms down next to his thighs. “Don’t
Potter now just stared straight ahead, cheeks and ears flaming red, hands clenched into fists in his lap. Draco slid onto the stool next to him and placed neatly clasped hands on the bar, looking around the pub with great interest as though he had never seen human beings before.
Harry’s hand is so unsteady suddenly that he has to hurriedly place his pint on the bar lest he drop it. Malfoy is shaking again, eyes scrunched up with mirth, the spinning shafts of lights from overhead once again reflected in his eyes, and glancing off his satiny hair.
,” Draco whispers to himself, sweat beading down his temple and into his mussed hair, Potter’s rough fingers against the thin, sensitive skin of his inner wrists serving in no way helpful to the way the rest of his body is burning with a sudden burst of arousal that has hit him seemingly out of
“For whom?” Harry hisses poisonously, his thighs trembling now, balls pressed tight against his body, his whole form now thrumming with a preternatural force of some sort. For a moment, Harry feels a streak of fear amidst the blind, possessive hysteria that he’s bursting with. “
Malfoy just continues staring at him, his expression oddly empty. A huge shudder wracks him and he hunches over some more, his arms tightening around himself. Harry is in front of him in an instant, crouching onto his haunches and cupping Malfoy’s damp face, pressing fervent kisses across it and fully expecting to be shoved away any second. But Malfoy just remains still and unmoving, and when Harry pulls back and stares desperately into his eyes, he just blinks slowly, sniffling.
!” Draco bursts out at once, leaning forward slightly, feeling slightly deranged. “Give me something to keep the mood swings down. I can’t be crying everyday for the rest of this pregnancy!”
“Fucking get your stupid, scarred face away from me!” Draco grits, rearing up and trying to head-butt Potter in the face. The man dodges neatly, expressing turning icy and sour as he bends his leg some more, and Draco chokes out a gasp, certain that his knee is going to snap. “
“You worry too much, darling,” Narcissa says gently, dabbing at her mouth and smiling at Draco over the rim of her wine glass. “The elves can bring you some stewed fruit for the little one when she’s hungry.”
Pausing in his tracks at that, Draco turns to face it where it stands in front of the counter, either waiting to be served, or just having stopped there because it’s presumably deranged.
“Fuck,” he muttered, quickly stumbling back. Then, after sparing a moment to look around blankly, Harry marched through the stream to the other side. The water only rose just past his ankles and Harry flicked his wand to dry his jeans after he’d crossed over. Pausing again, Harry scratched his head. Had they even crossed this thing on their way here? Well, he’d been Levitated, hadn’t he? But the kids and Malfoy all had had dry feet at the clearing.
tell anyone,” Harry said on a sigh, running a hand through his hair in frustration. “And it’s not why I’m here.”
He supposes it would’ve been a whole other thing if he and Potter had been...together. The very thought of it makes Draco slightly dizzy – Potter and he, an actual couple; Potter finding out that Draco lived in that godawful little shithole and gently persuading Draco, his
ten – of this year’s holiday edition flavour. It’s Aged Golden Bourbon Caramel with Belgian Chocolate chunks. The bourbon is seven hundred years old. The chocolate chunks are charmed to turn molten in your mouth.” He turns away and shoves the tub into the freezer, causing a bag of frozen peas to topple out. He catches the bag deftly and shoves it in alongside the enormous tub of ice cream. “That smells nice,” he adds, finally turning around and brushing his hands down his jumper.
I’m barely even conscious; I don’t think I’ve ever come so hard in my life or that sex has ever felt so good before.
He turns away hurriedly, carefully keeping his gaze averted, when he’s called to a stop not by Potter but—
His expression clears slightly and he licks his lips, looking away and sighing. “I suppose I shouldn’t have waited this long to introduce him.”
you’d retract the offer,” Malfoy spits, flaring up out of nowhere, “As if you’d spend a single Knut on
“Is it now?” I ignore the soft squeak Ron lets out at Hermione’s comment. “It’s wonderful that I feel this way about one of my closest friends, who, oh wait, has a boyfriend.”
He’s rutting slowly, his cock slipping through the slick channel of Potter’s crease, Potter’s arsehole clenching with every stroke against it. Draco still has his hands full of Potter’s arse and so he pushes them together, squeezing his own prick between the cheeks. Potter groans and bucks back once and Draco nearly comes right there.
Potter grins. “Technically, Hermione started it.” There’s a pause as he grimaces playfully. “And she and Ron sort of bullied me into heading it.”
“Fuck,” Harry swears under his breath, raising his hand in a quick wave and attempting to gesture to the crowd to let him through.
Draco grins slowly to himself, his own cheeks slightly pink. “That’s not a technique,” he says, perusing his own menu. “That’s just base, human reaction to...above average...attractiveness.”
“You could kiss me now,” said Draco pointedly, cocking one brow and resolutely ignoring the swarm of maniacal butterflies that burst to life in his belly at Harry’s words. The hope and honesty in the other boy’s voice made Draco want to
. “Please!” Draco sobs, both knees buckling turn by turn, his fingers tightening to the point where several strands of Potter’s hair come free, “Oh god, I can’t come again already—” Draco gasps as there’s a wild kick from inside him to top it all. “Potter, you do remember I’m with child, yes?”
He’d groomed himself better and had been far more agreeable to going out more frequently, going on several dinner dates with Draco, and on one occasion, and after some gentle persuasion, had even taken Draco on a ride on his godfather’s flying motorcycle, an experience which left Harry exhilarated and Draco a little traumatised.
Except this time, Potter’s fingers coast along his crease, his other hand holding Draco wide open, sending Draco into a shivering frenzy as he locates Draco’s clenching hole and rubs it. Potter’s fingers are slick and slippery, and Draco momentarily wants to pause and find out how he’d managed
“Not at my father’s, you didn’t,” Malfoy spits at once, baring his teeth for a moment but still somehow managing to look unbearably lovely.
“Oh, sure,” Harry scoffs, “Unplanned parenthood with Draco fucking Malfoy – there’s a cause for celebration, right there.”
It’s difficult to focus with my head so full of him and my cock so hard but I manage to Apparate us onto his bed. We land too hard and he knocks his head into the headboard but doesn’t complain for a second – probably because I don’t give him a chance to; I’m already undressing him. I pull his t-shirt off with a single yank and his hair is left uncharacteristically messy. He’s always careful with his hairstyle, Draco. It feels good to leave his hair messy on the side where the t-shirt had dragged over his head. I reach up and muss up the whole mass of sleek, blond hair just so I can see him dishevelled.
have let Pansy convince me to slather on some cocoa butter body...milk— lotion— cream... body butter...something,” he eventually trails off, arching into my hand as I tickle the tip of the nub with the pad of my forefinger.
Prongs charged at the thickest group of dementors, knocking them back, and Harry had just enough time to pull Albus behind himself.
They kiss, swaying on the spot, almost as though they’re dancing, neither making to pull away, both of them throwing their whole beings into it.
At the other end of the table Bill, Percy, Mr. Weasley and Hermione are deep in conversation. Ron and Ginny are getting progressively louder as they argue Puddlemere United’s supposedly unsportsmanlike conduct during their last game. Percy’s wife, Audrey, and Fleur have miraculously gathered enough energy to force themselves out of their chairs to take Dominique and Molly Jr. to the village; the little girls love throwing Sickles into the wishing well in Ottery St. Catchpole that always sang back to the people throwing in the money.
Draco doesn’t scream now because Potter’s tongue is already in his mouth again, fucking into it at pace with his cock. His legs are spread out wantonly,
Draco blinks and waits but when Potter’s silence continues, he goes on. “After we completed the course, Richard asked me to move in with him – he’d been talking of renting a place in London for weeks, was so excited about it. And well,” Draco’s insides twist uncomfortably as he says it, “I thought we were in love.” Potter’s expression hasn’t changed at all and his flat stare is starting to unnerve Draco. “Father didn’t approve of us,” he blurts out hurriedly, now wanting to just be done with it. “Wanted me to break it off with him and Mother wasn’t exactly offering any kind of support either so I—Well, I was nineteen and stupid, alright? I left the Manor and moved in with Richard and—and things were alright for a bit. We started apprenticing under William Gnopf – have you heard of him? Brilliant potioneer, Professor Snape hated him,” Draco smiles softly to himself for a moment, “About a year in I found out that Richard had been sleeping with one of the other apprentices, a Julio someone,” he says quietly, even the back of his neck burning now, his insides roiling with mortified shame. “It took me all of two hours to pack and leave, and...that place was the best I could find if I didn’t want to spend the night in a Knockturn back alley with my Shrunken trunk in my pocket.”
For one long, startlingly vivid moment, he feels as though Malfoy and he are one single entity. They’re fused so tightly together, wound so close, Malfoy’s mouth fused so hard against his – for that brilliant moment, Harry is filled with a dazzling burst of happiness because surely Malfoy and he will never be apart now, not ever.
“Don’t make a noise, Papa’s sleeping,” he chides softly, handing Scorpius an oven mitt shaped like a dragon’s head when the boy reaches for the whisk with a growl of rage. Scorpius immediately stuffs his hand in and pretends to ‘bite’ off Harry’s nose with his fingers in its soft ‘mouth’, while Harry solemnly stays in place for it.
“Shut your fucking face, Potter,” Malfoy said, suddenly sounding weary, “And pass me my wand so I can spell this dry.” He began pawing at the buttons on his shirt, the inch-thick bandages not helping in any way as he attempted to undress.
Prongs was back but the streak of white was so much dimmer. The house was swarming with them now. James crouched on the floor, arms over his head, as three dementors pressed in on him. Albus’s looked up, rather impassively, at the cloaked figure looming over him.
“You were plenty rough the first time,” Draco informs him blandly, quirking an eyebrow at him when he pulls back. “And I survived just fine.”
“I am,” I say solemnly, and then fake a sigh. “Fine. I guess I’ll stay put with you. For the sake of Simon’s safety.”
Harry bent and picked up Lily. She was even warmer now. He arranged her against his shoulder and gently stroked her face with his thumb.
Draco slumps backwards, turning half onto his front and burying his face into the pillows. Stomach rolling unpleasantly, mouth bitter with the aftertaste of too much alcohol, Draco breathes in deeply. He smells, very, very faintly, sweat and spunk...and Potter.
of fussing from Father, I managed to lift the curse,” he says simply, shoulders lifting in a shrug. “It took about a month until the Veela genes surfaced properly, but well—so—yes...” he mumbles, trailing off once more. “Father died a few weeks after that – his heart had started to give in even before the War ended – but Mother said he’d never looked as handsome as he did lying there in his coffin.” Draco blushes furiously, suddenly. “I don’t know why I just told you that, Potter, I’m—”
and unblinkingly watching shockingly tacky soap operas on TV.  She’d responded clarifying that it’s a book detailing some of the most interesting cases the DMLE had seen, and Draco had to grudgingly agree that it did sound like the sort of literature that consulting-Auror Harry Potter would devour.
understand why he’s unable to keep his eyes off him. Nothing about his current appearance is worth a second glance and yet, Harry sits, trying his hardest not to blink very often so he can stare at him that much longer. There’s a certain grace about Malfoy, a muted glow, and Harry is part confused and part mesmerised by him.
“Yes, you do. You won’t talk to me anymore. You won’t spend time with me anymore. You won’t even fucking
“And I haven’t ‘bonked’ this one yet, so...” He shrugs like it’s self explanatory and heads into the bathroom, leaving the door ajar. I hear the scrape of the shower curtain being pushed aside, the squeak of a tap and then the rush of the shower running.
Ron’s mouth is a straight line as he meets Harry’s eyes. “Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy,” he says grimly. “They were holed up in an old, unregistered mansion in Valencia, shit loads of Pureblood warding around the place.”
him, that he’s on his knees with his whole face squeezed in between Draco’s arse cheeks, his tongue painting sopping wet strokes over his arsehole while groaning blissfully into Draco like eating him out is the ultimate luxury life could provide him with. And Draco, in turn, moans like a dying walrus, reaches back to hold Potter’s head in place with a handful of mangy hair and pushes his hips back as much as Potter’s rigid hold on him allows, gasping and cussing against the polished oak of the door.
constantly locking horns over something.” Narcissa sighs. “I spoke to him and he’ll apologise. He’s taken Scorpius down to the lake. Bring the baby too, come along.”
“It was foolish of you to leave, Lucius,” Harry says, unable to keep the sneer out of his voice. “You’re lucky you weren’t immediately thrown into Azkaban upon being found violating the terms of your acquittal.”
For Potter is nearly uncontrollably ferocious now, his snarled growls barely human, his nails digging into the plumpness of Draco’s recently filled out arse, his body convulsing so hard he’s practically vibrating against Draco. One hand flying back up to yank Draco’s head back by the hair, Potter wrests their mouths apart and stares – no,
Potter shifts, leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms, the blanket slithering off him entirely. The elf pops into existence beside his chair, gathers up the tatty material, and pops off with it. Potter’s eyes don’t leave Draco as he sits there, arms crossed, the bulge of his muscles terribly distracting for Draco, who’s trying not to let his gaze rove over his broad torso.
The Busy Bee in Diagon had been the most popular haunt of nearly every recent Hogwarts alumnus. Draco’d found himself there with Pansy, Goyle and Blaise almost every Friday and sometimes even Saturday evening. It felt oddly like home, the stained-glass and wooden interiors with dim, golden lighting, the buzz of bright chatter and swift service reminding him of the Great Hall. Nearly every table had boasted a familiar face, although that also meant he had to put up with a great deal of hostile glares. But like everything else after the War, those had eventually faded away too.
“It’s not... it’s more like... I don’t--” Harry’s shoulders slumped forward as he gave up and pushed his hands into his face, his gut clenching with dread as he forced out, “It’s Malfoy.”
Draco laughs shortly on an exhale. “I don’t know what gave you that impression,” he drawls, “because I just barely care about my own sub-department. And that too because I’m the Head and sort of...have to. Besides,” he continues, uncrossing his legs and making to stand up, “this sounds like it might be an order from Level One – how or why would I have any information about it?”
“Took your time, didn’t you?” Harry says mildly. He doesn’t look angry or irritated that Draco had made him wait. In fact, his serene, calm smile siphons out some of Draco’s nervousness. “Come on, then,” he adds, patting his lap.
And yet, when everyone begins to head home and I see Draco meandering around the room collecting empty ice cream bowls and pint bottles, casually waving the others off, my stomach clenches. He’s going to want to stay, I realise.
Harry doesn’t answer right away and so Draco blinks at him in the semi-darkness, tracing the faint upward curve of Harry’s mouth with his fingertips. “Did I scare you earlier?” he suddenly asks.
Potter had stood and watched Draco Disapparate, thick arms crossed, tiny, lopsided smile directed at Draco; as if he’d smiled like that at Draco his whole life, as if it wasn’t the most beautiful smile Draco has ever seen.
Draco keeps his hand firmly by his sides, fingers curled so tightly around the sheets that he can feel his nails digging into his palms even through the cotton. He swallows over and over again, muffling any sound that tries to rise up from somewhere in his stomach where he can already feel a tight ball of heat gathering.
Cheeks flushed, breathing still uneven, Draco stares exasperatedly at him, mouth curving into a wide, besotted grin, fingers pushing into Potter’s wild mass of hair. “Shut up,” he mumbles against his mouth, licking swiftly over his lower lip. “It’s perfectly normal for a Veela.”
And then Harry was shooting back up, hand held aloft in triumph, the feeble fluttering of the gossamer white wings just about visible against his gloved knuckles.
The urge to snap at that question is almost an instinct by this point but Harry simply breathes deeply, exhaling slowly against Malfoy’s neck. “I’m fine,” he murmurs, watching the fine, gold hair part under his breath before something catches his eye. Lifting Malfoy’s hair out of the way, Harry gasps and rears back a bit, Malfoy yelping as his arsehole is jostled.
Harry is now more than familiar with the feel of Malfoy’s long, nimble fingers combing through his hair but when Malfoy’s hands push into it, Harry shivers and presses his face harder into the soft crook of his neck, biting into the curve.
But he’s already drawn his wand and cleaned it. “It’s okay,” he says softly. When I nod, gulping, and pick up my glass, he puts out a hand and gently brushes my shoulder with it. “Harry,” he says. “It’s okay.”
“Harry and Weasley have met him,” Draco instantly retorts as he leans into me, quite unaware that he’s not standing upright. “Not that I care about what you believe,” he waves one hand, “Now be a dear and pour me another.” I pull back slightly and shake my head vigorously at Zabini.
a vanilla prude,” Harry reminds him, both hands covering his arse in a reverent squeeze, inadvertently humping into the front of his jeans. His fingers are too tight, too insistent, as he works Malfoy’s arse cheeks open, prising them wide apart and peering in the semi-darkness at the little pink bud that winks up at him. “Believe me now?” he murmurs, pulse speeding up even further just at the sight of that quivering, wrinkled little divot, pushing Malfoy’s thighs further apart and stepping between them, hunching over Malfoy.
“Yes, but there’s a bed,” Harry points out, “and proper blankets, and pillows, and also, there’s a slimmer chance of being caught half naked up there.”
“I think he has plans with his boyfriend.” I don’t look at Ron as I answer and my stomach is suddenly in knots, just at the mention of Draco. “I didn’t go confirm, though.”
Draco barely even processed what he’d said. He just stared at Harry’s bare torso with all its many tattoos, his gaze slowly proceeding further south, taking in the tight thighs and the lean calves and the big, long feet before going right back to that inviting mound in his black pants. When it twitched, Draco blinked and looked back up at Harry, feeling his face heat as Harry’s face slowly split into a grin.
He’s spent five years almost constantly in Malfoy’s presence, and Harry’s at a place where he knows he’d do
Malfoy’s glare slowly dissipates into just pure, resigned exasperation, and he throws his wand back down with a weary sigh. “I’ll put the kettle on,” he murmurs, ambling over to the kitchenette. He’s wearing pyjamas bottoms that ride a few inches above his ankles, and a long, faded, soft looking yellow t-shirt with a picture of a bowtruckle on the front, his glossy hair up in a small, messy knot, his creamy nape exposed and causing Harry’s mouth to flood with saliva. His perfectly arched feet are bare and soundless against the wooden floor as he fills the kettle and sets it on the hob, lighting it wandlessly. “I only have teabags,” he mumbles over his shoulder.
and gleaming with sweat. Draco traces the marks he’s sucked onto Potter’s neck with his tongue, digging his nails into his shoulders as Potter lets loose a snarling shout and comes far up inside Draco’s bum, continuing to grind into him even as he slumps down, boneless and gasping.
“The bloke’s fine, love,” Ron answers her, rolling his eyes. “He danced for a straight hour at the club last week. Much to Malfoy’s pleasure,” he adds the last bit to me under his breath.
Whenever he’d heard Luna go on about those things in the past, he’d rolled his eyes. He’d exchanged covert grins with Ron behind his beer and gone back to
“Were you hoping I’d regret it?” Potter rasps, his hole clenching shut and blinking open under Draco’s thumbs. “Were you hoping I’d fight you? Kick you away, maybe, and run screaming out of your house?”
“What?” I force out a laugh – I don’t think I do a very good job of it. “Of course I do! What makes you say that? Of course I do!” I realise I’ve said that already and abruptly fall silent, turning away as if to look out for Zabini, because Draco is looking at me with
by one?” he adds with a cruel little smirk that promptly falters as he notes the way Harry just sighs resignedly and looks away.
“It’ll feel better in the dark,” Draco mumbles but Harry is already plucking at the knot on Draco’s bathrobe, laving ticklish little licks along his neck. “Harry...”
Narcissa is staring at Malfoy’s midriff again, her eyes very round and her mouth hanging open, realisation dawning across her face, and Lucius is suddenly rising to his feet, his face chalk-white, his long form trembling with shock and fury.
Harry shook his head, his eyes very wide, watching as Moody pawed at Draco’s hair for a moment before curling his long, fluffy body around his neck so that Draco stood there looking like he was wearing a fur-lined scarf.
could put on one of those too, if you like,” Draco offers calmly. He pulls on a cursory smile as Erickson chortles, the sound rough and gravelly. “How can I help?” he finally asks.
I can’t help it; I reach out and lift a bit of his diagonal fringe off his face. He blinks, looking pleased, and throws an arm around my shoulders, steering me towards the others.
“We’ve all done shit we regret,” Harry says, slightly plaintively. When Ginny just snorts and Summons her broom, he adds, “Mine was dating you.” He laughs and dodges neatly when she hisses like a pissed off Kneazle and aims the broom handle at his crotch.
Malfoy nods, eyes glinting wickedly. “Have you?” he asks softly. Harry nods as well, his hand still on the smooth bump of Malfoy’s stomach. “How was it today? What’s it like trying to train a bunch of mediocre players who won’t stop trying to grope you?” Malfoy’s tone is one of lilting nonchalance, but Harry sees the way his eyes narrow.
“Rude, blond thing,” the witch nods, “Did go and find Marvin when he slipped out once, though,” she says, scratching her cat’s ears.
Lucius scoffs loudly. “Very well, very well,” he sighs, flapping a hand carelessly. “Go on then, son, do share. Does this
Malfoy’s fists tremble where they’re clenched on the table, eyes narrowing to flaming flints, thin chest heaving. Something about the way he’s slowly swelling up, face draining of all colour, mouth starting to tremble, makes Harry go completely still, the hairs on his arms rising.
“Can I go now?” he rasps at Potter, rutting his clothed erection against Potter’s naked, flaccid cock, still damp with his saliva.
“Do it.” Harry heard footsteps on tile, a soft creaking sound, a thud as the plywood door was pushed shut and a loud rattle as it was locked. “Are you in?”
He slid down slowly until he was lying down again, boneless and sweaty, and held the receiver between chin and shoulder as he spelled himself clean and pulled his boxers back up, leaving the covers off while he cooled off.
“I wasn’t at risk,” Draco says automatically, jutting his chin out even as his voice trembles and his stomach plummets a little.
“Oh, nothing,” Malfoy replied with absolutely unconvincing airiness. “Just surprised to see you here, that’s all.”
Hermione sighs and Ron helplessly glances around at the three of them in turn before clearing his throat. “Right. Well... Er,” he blinks, “Good luck, I guess. See you, love,” he adds to Hermione, exchanging a small smile with her before stepping out into the blindingly lit, stark white hospital corridor.
Fuck off, Draco wants to spit. But then Potter is pressing damp, open-mouthed kisses along Draco’s neck and it’s all Draco can do to simply melt into the mattress, his whole system shutting down with record speed.
I yank back and he makes a minute, barely audible sound of surprise, following my mouth for half a beat before immediately pulling away as well, leaning back and looking at me as though waiting for further instructions. He looks very innocent suddenly, as if he hadn’t been taunting me just a few minutes ago.
, throws Draco off kilter for a moment. He regards Potter in silence, taking in the way he stood there, tall and effortlessly graceful, hair falling into his face, expression pleasant but carrying that hard edge Draco’s noticed since term began.
Draco leaps to his feet, sending his chair toppling back, and throws his napkin onto his empty plate. “Remind me when I asked for your opinion on my physical appearance?” he spits loudly.
wide, and Potter lunges between them, lifting Draco’s arse off the bed as he pounds him loose, his cock smacking into his belly between them, sending strings of precome flying about. Draco clenches around him, fierce and deliberate, and fuck, but he genuinely believes that he can feel every ridge and fold of Potter’s cock inside him, fucking through the tightness, carelessly burning its way past any resistance Draco might be stupid enough to put up.
Malfoy licks his lips and bites on the lower one, one foot bouncing as his gaze darts restlessly around the room. “I dunno,” he murmurs. Harry sighs dejectedly and Malfoy’s grey gaze flickers up to meet his, Malfoy’s mouth opening and closing soundlessly several times.
Harry was careful to maintain impassivity. But Malfoy seemed to find his silence offensive anyway, and a second later he got to his feet, gripped his stupid gold sword and flounced off in a huff.
“We’ll find something tomorrow, I promise,” Malfoy muttered, reaching out and gently squeezing his hand.
“Do you have any concrete reason to believe you’re sexually incompetent?” she enquires, addressing me as she might a patient.
It had taken Draco entirely too long to recognise the freshly inked lines, each one connecting a series of dots, placed right over Harry’s heart. Mouth open, breathing loud, Draco reached up and ran his fingertips over the new tattoo, hardly able to believe his eyes. Upon looking at Harry he saw that he was pink cheeked and chewing nervously on his lip, eyes anxious behind his glasses as he regarded Draco.
“Yeah? How much do you bet?” he raises one brow in challenge before going over to yank the darts out of the board
Despite looking downright knackered, his eyes are over-bright, sharp, and they dart about incessantly, never staying on Harry for more than a fraction of a second. Not for the first time, Harry takes in the dark bags under Malfoy’s eyes, the lines of expertly suppressed anxiety etched across his forehead and around his mouth; his faded, slightly baggy clothes, sunken cheeks, and the general unkempt air he carries.
“No. James. I—Listen,” Harry looked over at Malfoy who was now fiddling with something in his cloak. “He’ll—He won’t let anything bad happen to you. And I need to make sure you guys aren’t with me so that if there’s another attack, I can save myself quickly and also know that you’re safe.”
“Are you mad at me for petting your cat, Malfoy?” he asks blandly, standing so close to Draco that Draco’s elbow bumps into Potter’s chest.
The current state of my life makes me yearn for the days when Voldemort would always be trying his best to kill me. Such a simple life it was back then.
,” Harry blurts out, before sighing and adjusting the bundle of his work robes in his lap. “Why’d you have to go and get so hot?” he mumbles mournfully into his own drink. “’s really distracting.”
Draco thrusts the last bite of the chocolaty pastry at Potter, fingers smeared with chocolate, chin lifting as though extending a challenge. Potter stares at Draco, not even looking at what he’s being offered before slowly extending an arm out to him.
“Oh.” Potter fidgets with a hole in his horrible, clichéd Gryffindor t-shirt, staring down at the book Draco had bought himself on the way back from his first appointment with Granger. The baby on the cover has a perfectly round head and looks incredibly happy as it beams toothlessly and Draco honestly doesn’t know whether reading about sensitive nipples, swollen feet and the eventual increase in flatulence is helping him wise up about the pregnancy or simply fuelling actual nightmares.
So he just stands there with his mouth slightly open because he’s actively starting to have a silent meltdown. Potter doesn’t say another word but his words hang between them, flashing like a vivid, multicoloured neon sign, their implication as undeniable as unbelievable.
of blunt canine nails on wooden flooring. Freezing, heart thudding in his ears, Draco waits with his mouth slightly open, his gaze fixed on the sliver of light under the door, where a massive shadow has just appeared.
“Thank you, Potter,” Malfoy said stiffly. “You can fuck off now.” He still had only arm inside the shirt and Harry realised that in the confused mess that had followed when he’d attempted to investigate the moans, he’d completely forgotten that Malfoy had very likely been having a wet dream – right before he’d
“For four hours,” Draco adds. “It augments the intended effect of the wolfsbane, namely suppressing the more beastly instincts.”
I say nothing, watching as he picks up his towel and slowly walks towards me, wiping his hands, then his neck. I feel such intense dislike for him that it feels as though I might choke on it. The irrationality of it doesn’t even strike me. The man has done nothing to personally offend me. All he did was date Draco.
“A werewolf,” Draco says flatly, raising his eyebrows when Potter just blinks. “A werewolf who possesses perfect control of his mental and physical faculties and who’s on possibly the best version of a Wolfsbane Potion that can even be brewed. It’s not like you’re going to suddenly transform in broad fucking daylight, you daft tit!” Draco adds exasperatedly. “It’s terrible, what happened to you, Potter, and I am so
“I’ll, at least, escort you back,” he replies shortly, not meeting Malfoy’s eyes. “If I feel well enough to stay, I’ll stay.” He marches away without looking back.
“Does that do something for you, Weasley? ‘cause I’m doing a little spotting of my own from over here, and if that’s not a boner between your legs then I—”
Weasley now looked more triumphant than he had when the Dark Lord’s body hit the ground lifelessly after Potter had finished him off. Granger didn’t look fooled for a second by Draco’s lofty speech. Rolling her eyes, she got to her feet and collected her coat and handbag. Weasley simply stood there looking very pleased with himself.
Weasley sighs. “Why’d you do it, Malfoy?” he asks, the smug bravado from earlier suddenly gone. Now he just looks as weary as Draco feels. “Why would you risk it like that?”
“Well, you bought new robes, that does count for something,” Malfoy points out, licking a smear of chocolate off his lower lip.
I wanted to find out what you’re up to,” she agrees with a nod, not denying Draco’s (not entirely sarcastic) allegation.
It’s nearly dark now, faint rolls of thunder sounding in the distance as he sets off towards the stands. Malfoy is still and unmoving where he sits and Harry breaks into a run over the last hundred metres or so. That familiar feeling of something savage and ravenous trying to claw its way out of him is slowly intensifying but for some reason, the thought of being with Malfoy, spending the evening with him, seems to help; he somehow finds it easier to control the gnawing ache under his skin.
“Right, maybe I’ll just sneak around and follow him for a few days then.” I purse my lips over a grin and Draco glares at me as he bristles at the snide reference to Simon.
“Keep your hands here, hm?” Draco cajoles, finally releasing his wrist, and Harry blinks, a tiny crease appearing between his bushy eyebrows, the slight haze of intoxication still evident in his eyes despite the shower, but keeps his hands, palms up, on either side of his head. Draco smiles softly, nuzzling his jaw before gnawing his way up, stubble scratching his lips and tongue, and running the tip of his nose around the curve of Harry’s ear. “Sometimes you’re not in control, Harry. And that’s okay.” He pulls back and notes the way Harry’s gaze has sharpened a bit, understanding slowly blotting through the stark emerald; Draco smiles wider, grey eyes warm and besotted. “I’d like you save you too, from time to time.”
“You weren’t knocked up then,” Potter says, pulling out carefully. Draco jerks, his arse clenching instinctively as Potter slides out, biting his lip when Potter’s gaze heats. Then he merely drops a kiss to Draco’s mouth and flops onto his back beside him with a sigh, stretching out his back by arching off the bed until his spine clicks.
scared of them!” Harry says loudly, and the outrage on his face has Draco laughing openly. “As if I’d be scared of your
“You’re welcome,” he acknowledges with a tip of his messy head. Then a brief look of hesitation flickers across his face but Potter doesn’t say anything further.
, uncontrolled, jealous rage and Draco, being the permanently hyper-suspicious Slytherin that he is, probably quietly
Harry can feel the derisive satisfaction oozing out of Lucius, can sense Narcissa’s disappointment. He can feel Malfoy trembling like a leaf beside him, can hear the way his breathing is choppy and strained as he stares at Harry with equal measures of tentative yearning and accusatory hopelessness.
to seduce that sickening little slug. If your precious little boyfriend had remained faithful to you, he wouldn’t be in this situation now, would he?”
“You want to humiliate me,” Draco blurts at once, one hand tightening reflexively around the cool glass of bottle of ink.
for help with something like that?” Malfoy asks irritably, hitching the trailing scroll up off the floor as he scowls and throws his quill into the inkpot like a dart.
The neckline of Octavia’s blouse plunges dangerously low, the hem of her skirt riding high enough that the delivery wizard who’d come in at nine AM still hadn’t left now at four PM. Her nails, Draco notes as she hands him his messages, are painted glossy black, and remind him of how her talons had looked the time she’d transformed in a fit of pique after the Wasps had lost to the Harpies that one time.
He’s taller than Draco remembers him being; Draco is used to being one of the tallest people in most rooms, used to training his gaze downwards as he speaks to people. It unnerves him some, to say the least, that his gaze now lifts just a couple of inches above eye level to meet Potter’s. Jet black hair, as unruly as ever, now hangs in a scraggly, unruly mess past his ears, brushing broad, hunched shoulders. He’s draped in a ratty, grey blanket, wearing a faded, baggy red t-shirt over pale blue pyjama bottoms underneath, and his large feet are bare.
, and Draco doesn’t know if he has it in him to start talking about it only to realise that it’s not mutual.
Malfoy is quiet for a very long time, still ignoring Harry’s proffered hand. Then, “I suppose I’ll need the time to pack my things,” he says softly, his expression hardening.
“Your mother has threatened me on more than one occasion, you know?” Harry grumbles, jabbing his wand at the butter to soften it with a little too much vigour, causing a chunk of it to melt off completely. “You wouldn’t believe me, but she has!”
He also realised that he had never actually seen Malfoy eat anything either – unless he had eaten something in the time it had taken for him to follow Harry to Godric’s Hollow; but somehow Harry doubted that.
Harry’s breathing now, though barely audible, is ragged and strained, his chest heaving against Draco’s, his exhales unsteady. Just when Draco is starting to wonder if Harry is perhaps not as compos mentis as he’d earlier assumed, Harry’s arm around Draco’s waist tightens – just by a fraction.
“Sorry,” Harry says hurriedly, ire abruptly draining out of him at the subtle threat. “I’m—Malfoy...sorry. Just... Just let us help, yeah? Thanks for—thanks for agreeing to see Hermione,” he adds lamely, shoving one hand into his pocket and the other into his hair.
Malfoy’s quick, sharp inhale is only audible to Harry and that too because of their proximity, and he laughs as Malfoy smacks him loosely on the shoulder. “Bastard.”
“Nothing happens if I miss a dose,” Potter says easily. “One time I developed a slight fever but it broke overnight. The other time I forgot, I was just really worked up and jittery by the end of the day. ‘s nothing uncontrollable; werewolves survived years without Wolfsbane, and then several more years with consuming it just a few days a month. I’ve got it easy, really,” he says airily. “People like Remus had it far worse and it bodes well to remember that, I guess.”
Around two in the afternoon, the yellow of daylight darkened to a gloomy grey. Instinctively, Harry’s hand tightened around his wand as he looked up; but it was just heavy, dense grey clouds gathering.
Finally in a position to do what he’d been aching to for the past several minutes, Harry stroked his hands, palms flat, over Malfoy’s front, holding his breath at the way the muscles jumped under his touch. The scars were shiny and felt soft under the rough pads of his fingers, and Malfoy suddenly brought both his hands up to cover his face.
“You...want to--” Draco looks around wildly for a moment, “These are all hexed! You want to kill me!”
Harry let out a mirthless chuckle of exasperation. “It’s pointless trying to argue with you. I should’ve known before I offered. Never mind, then.”
“Lyra is,” Harry says with a hint of a frown. “Gilly is watching her. I managed to get Scorp’s pants on before he ran off to watch TV. ”
Malfoy simply nodded, lifting both knees to his chest, turning his face on the pillow so he wasn’t looking at Harry anymore. Harry swallowed hard, his saliva thick and his throat dry; he simply could
He could tell that Malfoy was looking at him but Harry determinedly kept his gaze on the dark sky outside.
way,” he says hoarsely. “You can’t do more than you’re already doing. And I’m so grateful and—” his voice breaks slightly and he inhales deeply before saying, a bit steadier, “You’re doing more than enough. And there’s no further way to help me anyway...”
Malfoy leans over and plucks up the hardbound book he’d been reading when Harry had entered the room –
Potter’s strangled, helpless cry of pleasure cracks around the room, leaving Draco’s hair on end. Hands descend on his head, needy and clinging, and Draco barely even feels as his hair is gently pulled.
Harry nods without looking away from Malfoy’s face – the dark pockets under his downcast eyes and the way his mouth is turned down at the corners – and swallows, before croaking, “Yeah, I’ll head over after...after I’m done here.”
“What’s your deal, Potter?” he demands suspiciously. Then he glances down at Harry’s hand still wrapped around his soft cock, lips twisting into a sneer. “You have a problem,” he informs Harry.
“I thought we’d agreed to try and be civil to one another,” he growls through grit teeth, glaring hotly at Malfoy.
Potter moans, tossing his head back again and straining towards Draco’s mouth, his feet slapping in muffled thuds against the carpet. Draco sips delicately at the slit when another stream of precome trickles out and then hungrily swallows it all the way down, sighing through his nose at the choked scream from Potter.
Rolling his eyes, Draco turned around and carefully brought the fridge back down, shifting it until it was in its usual spot. “There you go, you fucking pain-in-the-arse,” he said, quite helplessly finding himself sounding rather fond. “Build your fucking nest and soil it for all I care.”
“Yes, well, you took care of that,” Draco grumbles, using his pyjama top to wipe the spunk off his belly.
Draco sighs. “Do you not like Tristan?” he asks bluntly but I can easily spot the strain of disappointment, the flicker of uncertainty in his eyes.
“What does that mean?” Potter asks breathlessly, tripping over the leg of his chair as he joins Draco and Granger near the examination table. Draco remains silent as he undoes his robes and lies down but mostly because he’s dying to know what she meant himself. “How else is he relying on me?
“No,” Draco sets his mug down on the end table and shuts his book, “but I’m not sleepy yet; napped earlier.”
After very little deliberation, Harry decided that the kids would be under the Invisibility Cloak. It was the easiest decision to make, really. How many times had Harry, Ron and Hermione used the Cloak for dangerous shit like this? He would’ve preferred they not go with him at all but there was no way he was leaving them with Malfoy – if Malfoy even agreed to watch them in the first place.
Malfoy fidgets vigorously, nostrils flaring and throat bobbing, picks up and drains the goblet of water once more, before scowling at both of them in turn. “Yes,” he answers curtly.
He ruts against the flat expanse of firm, honey toned belly and comes all over it, his cock spurting for so long that he has a bizarre moment of wondering if he’s actually going to
Ten minutes later, he’s still sat in the parlour, glaring out of the French windows as Lyra drools in his lap, when Narcissa glides in.
best friend after he’s done turning into and out of a fucking werewolf; no, I’d have just gone on with my life.”
Giving his shoulder a little squeeze, Potter goes back to his seat. “That’s a family heirloom, Malfoy,” he says softly, expression gentle and pleased. “The bloke at the shop – he almost didn’t want to sell it to me – said it’s a Pureblood relic. I think he was hoping to sell it to the Department of Magical History and Artefacts eventually; or at least he muttered something that sounded like that,” Potter says, narrowing his eyes in thoughtful bewilderment.
stronger and well developed than one might’ve hoped for or expected at this stage of a male pregnancy.”
Except that’s exactly how it had felt with Draco too. And now there’s a gaping hole that I know I can’t ever fill again but, fuck it, I don’t listen to the voice that tells me that.
There was a visible moment of panic as Potter racked his brains. “I’m...I—er, a muscle relaxant of some sort, maybe?”
sky-blue robes, furry white gloves and cold-pinkened cheeks, munching on a chocolate frog as he shakes his head at Harry.
“Well, it took a while to learn how to overpower the wolf,” he chuckles, gently fiddling with Draco’s earlobe. “I went through my share of transformations, yeah; almost a year’s worth.”
Draco sniffs, keeping his nose in the air as he approaches slowly, unclipping his cloak and draping it over the back of the chair before sitting down stiffly.
(phrased in a more genteel manner, of course) to Granger then, after he’d righted his robes and sat down with her. He’d murmured through grit teeth, and Granger, to her credit, hadn’t even cracked a smile as she’d nodded and assured him that it’s perfectly normal —although her eyes did take on the aggravatingly
himself. Eyes rolling back at the welcome burn of being completely breached, he hurriedly grabs Harry’s shoulders to brace himself, a low, keening moan escaping him when Harry shifts minutely and presses up against his prostate.
“What time d’you have to be at Simon’s?” Hermione asks now, getting to her feet and Levitating our empty mugs to the sink.
!” he whimpers, spreading his knees wider and pressing his arse into Harry’s face with a delightful lack of shame until Harry stills him with a bruising
“What are you asking me to do, Pans?” he murmurs. “Are you suggesting I never speak to him again? Stop all interaction with him?”
“They’re not going to Azkaban,” Harry says without looking at him, throat scratchy and dry. “Not your father and most definitely not your mother. Come on.” He stands up and holds out his hand. “Let’s go home.”
“You wanted to come and sneer at what I’ve become,” Potter declares coolly, tone flat, lips tightening.
Draco scowls slightly. “That’s still him up there, Kreacher,” he says sharply. “Listen to me very carefully. I’m—I’m going into his room now, okay?”
“He probably went home first, I’m sure he’s still fixing his hair.” Ron’s voice is muffled, his face buried in his arms as he sits slumped over his desk.
“You ought to be, if you have even a single iota of common sense,” Draco says smoothly, smirking when Potter’s grin widens. “When and where?”
Harry shrugs. “I don’t talk about it much, do I? The wolf thing,” he specifies with a smile when Malfoy tilts his head questioningly. “It’s always on my mind, Malfoy. It’s who I am now and it’s not something that can be cured and...” Harry feels the familiar pit of despair growing inside him but presses on anyway, “Despite everything else that—despite everything else that I’ve done, it’s...all that people seem to want to talk about when they hear my name.” Harry is rather shocked with himself for saying out loud the things he hasn’t even voiced to Ron or Hermione yet. “So anyway,” he continues hurriedly, “that night, I dunno whether it was whatever I was floating around on thanks to Seamus or whether it was the fact that you were the most beautiful fucking thing I’d ever laid eyes on, but I wasn’t thinking about...
Just as the magnitude of the fact that this very friendship is probably over is sinking in for real, there is a series of thumps on the front door, hard enough that I hear the doorknob rattle. I start, my vision clearing, my clogged brain registering the infomercial playing on the TV, and look around to check the time. It’s a quarter past two.
“You—you can’t make me promise, Potter,” Draco says pathetically, because his insides are now melting, and quickly at that.
Ten minutes later, Harry clatters downstairs, skin still damp and warm after his shower. It’s getting increasingly nippy by the day now and he sighs gratefully as he enters the kitchen which is wonderfully bright and warm, the huge fire crackling cheerfully behind the pot of stew Kreacher is stirring.
Malfoy rears up in shock, his hoarse gasp loud in the darkness, his nails raking down the naked brick wall in front of them as he scrabbles. Harry’s already fucking him steadily with his tongue, thrusting it in and out indelicately, and for so long, that by the time he pauses to give his aching jaw some respite, Malfoy’s cock has already started to leak onto the seat. Harry’s own cock, meanwhile, is steadily getting more and more painful as he keeps it confined as tightly as it is, while it’s as
Draco laughs lightly. “Well, I’m sort of glad I ran into the elf, Potter,” he says quietly. “I owe you and I want to help you. Should I start picking up your doses for you, maybe?” he asks with a little snigger.
Draco stands, eyes swivelling down to Harry’s proffered hand, calloused palm upturned, the bell-sleeve of his formal, black robes riding up his forearm to reveal that long, curved scar, from wrist to elbow, faded now but still clearly visible.
