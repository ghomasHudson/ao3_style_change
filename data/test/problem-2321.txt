“You can take it from there, Miss Granger.” Snape told her. “Take Mister Potter to the infirmary, and tell Mrs Pomfrey the headmaster and myself will be right there. A word, Headmaster.” He added, turning to Dumbledore.
“I don’t think she would have checked them out, she was only there, what, twenty minutes?” Draco pointed out. “And she didn’t have books on her after the game.”
The train was already packed with students, and Draco saw the opportunity for a quick change of plans when Gregory stepped ahead of him to let two older girls in Hufflepuff colours squeeze past, and carried on down the corridor towards the head of the train. Pansy had always talked about how she wanted to sit at the head of the train, when their time came. Draco went the other way, using the cover of the crowd. He wasn’t sure the rest of them would even ask where he’d gone off to and why, but if they did, he had plausible deniability.
He understood. It was in the past. She’d more than made up for it, raising him. And she’d told him she’d reviewed her opinion since, because if Hal was such a great kid, surely his father couldn’t have been that bad.
He looked up, trying to remember which way he’d come through the blurry streets, but it hadn’t been a very long way – he hoped he could retrace his steps.
“So get this.” Blaise dropped his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “It’s not the first time the Chamber has been open. This happened before, about fifty years ago.”
was almost embarrassed that Sirius had come all the way for this. He spotted him waving from the stands, where he'd been sitting with the teachers and another couple of visitors (parents were always unofficially invited to come and see their offspring's games, even if not many did come) and made his way towards him.
Madam Pomfrey immediately came to his aid when they passed the doors to the infirmary, floating Hal to a bed as Sev helped Draco to another. He sat next to him when Draco refused to let go of his arm. Hal came back around when his head hit the pillow – Draco thought it was probably a blessing he’d missed the whole episode of being carried like a child half of the way.
Finally, with a crack and a swoosh, three people materialised on their lawn, holding on to a strand of woven willow, like the handle to a basket that might have broken off. Draco couldn't help it – he dashed forward and, spotting the same grin and eagerness on Hal’s face, barrelled into him for a hug.
“It was my pleasure and honour, Mister Potter.” Ollivander said after he’d gathered a handful of gold coins from him.
“To be fair.” Ron pointed out. “There was a giant three-headed dog at the door. Maybe the rest was a bit of an afterthought.”
Anthony and Hermione readily joined their friends, and Draco a little more warily, ending up only half perched on the edge of the bench – not so much to be able to run away, he wouldn’t leave the others behind anyway, but because six of them on that bench was really a tight fit.
“Fair-weather fan.” Ron retorted. “That’s what being a true supporter is. You don’t ditch them at the first sign of trouble.”
“Only under very restricted conditions it isn’t.” Draco argued back. “Which I somehow doubt were met. Since he just, you know, handed the egg over to you.”
He didn’t want to let go of Draco, the touch of each other’s skin their only lifeline, but he pointed his wand at the young man with his other hand. That only made him laugh, a cold, joyless laugh that echoed in the Chamber.
Draco was surprised to see Millicent Bulstrode as well, with her father and brothers. For decades, the Bulstrodes had been shunned from these parties on the belief that they had bred with Muggles and their blood had been tainted. They must have finally managed to convince the rest of them that they were as pure as they came. Or, and Draco thought more likely, as Pureblood numbers dwindled, the rules had been relaxed a little as to who could be part of the circle.
Petunia had been making the appropriate soft, comforting sounds as he spoke, but she paused at this.
“Sometimes…” Lupin started carefully. He cleared his throat when all the children directed his attention to him. “Dementors are known to make you feel hopelessness and despair. In close proximity, that can translate into reliving your worst memories, or the time in which you’ve been at your most vulnerable. If those moments were particularly strong or traumatising… you can be rather affected. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.” He added.
He swallowed like he was fighting down tears, and Draco knew he couldn’t understand, not really, not having grown up with siblings. He carefully didn’t say anything still. He could tell there was more than that bothering him.
She smiled at him again, not for the first time regretting the years where she herself had been strict and cold, distancing herself from unruly emotion, from caring too much. But there was time to get better, to make amends – time to say these things out loud.
“It’s not completely absurd.” Ron was the one to speak up and, more surprisingly, to point out the flaw in Hermione’s reasoning. “But if that was the case, then wouldn’t it have ‘refused’ to kill Hal’s dad too?”
He explained how he’d left the feast to find his godfather, how Hal and Anthony had wanted to warn him about the troll, how they’d unfortunately ran into said troll, and how they’d done the best they could think of from there. He astutely pointed out that he had been in the path of the troll all along, oblivious, and that if Hal and Anthony had gone to a prefect or teacher instead of running after him, it probably would have been too late by the time they found him.
Even Weasley number six hadn’t objected, like the few forced shared afternoons they’d spent together as kids were enough to make him acceptable. He’d personally always found Ron a bit annoying, having much more fun with the twins, but that might have been a reaction to the assumption of every single adult around them that, being the same age, they must get along. And the girl, Hermione… Draco had found it almost thrilling, sitting with a Muggleborn and listening to her talk about the differences between her world and theirs, like he was doing something really naughty.
They said goodbye until dinner, and Draco set out towards the dungeons. He didn’t know the password to the common room – no Slytherin in their right mind would share it outside of their House, not that it was an attitude exclusive to them – but he was sure there would be enough comings and going that he could slip in, and most of the students recognised him (from hanging out with Pan and Blaise and the others, or in all likelihood just from being a Malfoy) and wouldn’t kick him out.
Draco thought that by going to the owlery at meal time, he wouldn’t see anyone else there, but evidently some else had had the same idea. With some amusement, he paused at the top of the stairs, listening to the quick steps climbing up behind him, catching him up faster than he had been ascending. Two more bends, one… and Harry Potter came into view.
Naturally, Ley knew Hal much to well, and was no idiot, so he stopped his cousin before he could run away from the room and this awkward conversation.
“Every time I think about ‘getting over him’, about a possible future when I’m not close to him, I…” He put a hand over his chest. “It hurts.”
“The voice?” He asked. When Hal looked up and frowned, he added: “Ron told me you thought you heard a voice.”
“I’m afraid so.” She confirmed. “This is all the way up in Scotland, we wouldn’t be able to commute there. But from what I understand, all students are staying there, the study of magic is quite… immersive. And the school is protected, so you are not meant to leave the grounds during term time.”
He knew she was right in a way – it was illegal to give Veritaserum to minors, and while using a Pensieve could be an option (though it was also considered to be a bit of an ethical grey area), children’s memories were often easily thrown out on the basis they were too “emotional.” Draco, however, was about to point out Severus would also be a witness, having caught Lockhart right in the act, but his cousin interrupted his upcoming rant with a snort.
Anthony gave him a slap on the back. “Well done, mate.” He grinned back. “Totally undeserved win, given how you guys played in the first half, but that was a great catch.”
Anthony had drawn Hermione, and he got her a set of books that two seven-year Ravenclaw girls had created, called
“Come on.” He smiled, like this was still just a nice game, obviously unable to see – or ignoring – the fact that Hal no longer wanted to play along.
Funnily enough, as he was righting himself, he saw the Snitch hovering lazily a little distance away from him, heading for the Hufflepuff rings. He couldn’t go after it, what with the whole ‘fighting with his equipment to potentially stay alive’ thing, but he didn’t think the other Seeker had spotted it either.
Without waiting for a response, he glided back through the wall, leaving Hal wondering what the hell had just happened.
They both got distracted when Hal’s phone vibrated with a text – Hermione, asking him if his aunt liked chocolate, even though Hal had told her repeatedly she didn’t need to bring anything when she visited – and Hal showed the device to Sirius and explained how it worked.
“I’d tell you about how advanced this charm is, but I’m sure Remus had explained that to you already. At length. With diagrams.”
to help Neville, who was doing his best point his wand left and right to keep the vines of the Snare at bay. It was clearly looking for an opening to grab them again.
“He’s the best.” Hal nodded. “Honestly, it was so weird being here last year as well. My aunt didn’t react like that at all.” He laughed. He looked over at Ley at the other side of the table, smiling to himself. “He always seems to know exactly what I need.”
“It is extremely advanced magic – don’t take it personally.” He smiled, seeing Hermione’s face starting to look like he was straight out insulting her intelligence. “Many grown wizards can’t manage it. I won’t even be teaching that to my NEWTs levels.”
That was… a dreadful suggestion, but one that didn’t actually make zero amount of sense. It certainly was more likely than the idea that Hal had some sort of super-power and had single-handedly defeated the man by like, staring at him or something, at one year old.
“Nothing to do with you.” Sirius grinned, ruffling his hair. “And I could still see you fly. That was good, Hal.”
“I’m sorry, Draco.” Severus said kindly, but firmly. “I would love to spend more time with you, but I have things to attend to. I can’t.”
“That’s okay, Dobby.” Draco said, though Hal reserved that judgement for when his heart stopped hammering. “Could you get us each a bowl of ice cream? The way Dilly makes it.”
The old man considered him for a moment, and he was really starting to make him nervous when he finally spoke again.
“Maybe, actually. I feel like there would be more casualties if there wasn’t at least some form of consciousness behind it. People never fall, do they. Why do you ask?”
He almost got caught – he heard whispered voices, and in trying to scamper, came right in the path of Snape and Quirrell, clearly in the middle of an argument. He was only able to narrowly escape by slipping into an empty classroom, and waited with bated breath for the two men’s footsteps to move away. Only when he had been quite sure of the complete silence for a few minutes did he release a relieved sigh, and look around.
“Trust me, once you’ve seen magic, everything else seems a bit reductive.” Hal retorted. When Ley didn’t look impressed, he added: “Mate, I am surrounded by talking and moving paintings all day, the stairs do whatever they want, there are ghosts floating about and I have a teacher who turns into a cat. Not having a phone doesn’t seem like a big deal.”
“Oh for Merlin’s sake!” Someone cried behind them, as if on cue. “Stop messing about for five seconds, you two!”
“Saved both our lives down there.” Hal commented succinctly. “What do you want?” He addressed Fawkes.
It didn’t stop him from playing along, and they spent the next hour discussing possible candidates. None of them were realistic, and Draco was certainly not going to approach and ask out any of them – or anyone at all – but it did make him feel better to laugh about it.
“I am not sitting with you.” This last boy spoke. Hal saw him spot them, as they were pushing their suitcases as out of the way as possible. “Still space in yours?”
“I believe it’s the hair.” Luna shrugged. “But it is silly. My father has the same hair as me, too. And I find it very rude of people to suggest my mother would have cheated on him with your father.”
“Like I said, though, I’m not going to ignore that.” Hal continued. “I want to think about it, if that’s okay?”
The rest of them introduced themselves in turn, Luna nodding politely at each of them, only lingering a little longer on Hal. They went on to chatting about Christmas a little more – Ginny, as much as Ron tried to stop her, telling them all the story of how when he was six, Fred and George had enchanted the Christmas ornaments to chase him around the house every time he said
“You don't have to tell him you're in love with him.” He offered. “I do understand, you're only just going in fourteen, it's a bit much.”
“You, will, be, fine.” He insisted. “Harry, I may have just started school here, but I know the Gryffindor team inside and out, alright? Charlie was Seeker before you, he was Captain for the past two years, Fred and George are Beaters for the second year now, this is literally
The strictly timed plan Draco had devised and shared with all their friends was the only thing stopping Hal from falling into a panic spiral. He had had nightmares again that night, had woken up drenched in sweat, clawing at ropes around his neck that weren’t there. It helped, being able to look at the sheet of parchment, and to go through everything that would happen today in his head. 8 am, meet up in Diagon Alley, get waffles. That was a very good start, and he could focus on that for a bit, instead of “10 am, present to the Ministry”.
The school had not only accepted his change of name, but also his request to be moved to the boys’ dormitory, so even if nobody paid attention at the start of any class when teachers would take the register, they would hardly be able to fail to notice that.
“What was your plan here, throw him in and hope for the best? You cannot send an eleven year-old without a hint of a warning to face off… what even was that, by the way? There is nothing left of Quirrell down there. Potter couldn’t have done that.”
When the kitchen was clean, they went to sit in the front room, and Petunia handed Harry his letter. He looked a little puzzled, but he opened it without asking what it was, and read it quietly. Ley was fidgeting opposite him, but he stilled when he saw how serious Harry’s face had gone.
“Oh god.” Hal breathed. “Uh, I don’t know. I suppose some might be and some might not, I didn’t really have a long conversation with any of them.”
His arms were tiring under the weight of the books, and Ley grabbed half the pile from him – he was looking at him with a little frown.
Because when they got back, everything went to hell again, as the news that Justin Finch-Fletchley had been found petrified spread around the school.
“So, yeah.” Hal concluded. “At least as big as half the Burrow. Which is four times as high as your house.”
McGonagall started by casting a series of spells at the dormitory's door – she did not explain them, but Hal could guess they were meant to ensure nobody could escape, be it a rat or a man. She and Dumbledore then both made their way into the room, which did not go unnoticed. Whether he hadn't actually been sleeping or was stirred by the sound of their steps, the rat squealed and skipped off the bed, immediately scuttling towards the door. He didn't make it, as McGonagall's next spell his him square in the bottom.
Hermione also spent a lot of time with them – she hadn’t really made friends with the other Gryffindor girls. Hal had briefly considered maybe she didn’t get along with the other girls because she was essentially a year older, but that only really applied to him – a lot of other kids had their birthdays in the later months of the year, and it seemed the rule was you could only start at Hogwarts
“I know what’s in the Chamber of Secrets!” She told him excitedly. “And I may know where to find it too!”
“Why?” Draco suddenly had a vision of Flint and his mates, and gasped at the idea that Hal could have been in the same situation – though he was sure Hal would have handled it better, he’d actually shown that. He still had to ask. “Did he… bully you?”
Hal had also had a fairly standard Muggle Christmas, with some little injections of magic – he’d gotten his Aunt bath bombs from Diagon Alley again, because she had absolutely loved them the year before, and a box of Chocolate frogs had entertained him and Ley for hours as they watched Little Silver try to catch them – and had to promptly run after him and take it away if he did trap one, because they had unknowingly let him eat one, and it had
“I didn’t go looking for trouble.” He felt the need to say. “I just… Draco was being so weird and clearly something was wrong and I wanted- I needed to make sure he was safe.”
Marge briefly showed surprised, which quickly turned to sneer again. “Told him the truth, have you?” She addressed Petunia again.
“Draco.” He greeted him, as always a mixture of pleasantly surprised to see him and impatient already, like he was ready to tell him he didn’t have time as he would have most people. “Everything alright?”
What Pan found when he reached the Goldstein house was a locked gate. Looking across the alley leading up to the house (a rather lovely converted farm house, by the looks of it), there didn’t seem to be anybody home. As if to confirm the Universe’s
After their hour was up, and they had turned back into their younger selves on the way back, Draco managed to grab an opportunity to hang back with Pansy.
“Well.” She sighed. “As a matter of fact, I was going to ask you if you needed to go to… for any specific things that we can’t find in normal shops. But I’m not sure I can take you.” She added. “I’m working every day apart from Christmas day and Boxing day, and you know how much there is to do at the weekends before Christmas.”
“I know, isn’t it fantastic!” Lockhart entirely missed the sarcasm. “Now, come along. The wards are set to let you in. Hogwarts, Defence office!” He shouted as he walked into the flames.
He wasn’t sure if the spell itself had worked – but it had been enough to throw Lockhart off balance, and for his spell to miss.
Hal and Hermione skirted alongside the wall, keeping as far away to the troll as the small room allowed, while Anthony remained where it could see the thing’s face. When they reached the door, the handle gave immediately.
Hal, in fact, seemed to be channelling his inner Hermione as he planted his hands on his hips and looked up sternly.
They had fun evenings with Dean and Seamus in the common room and dorm as well, but the two had become fast friends, and spent all of their time together, to the point that their friendship became a little exclusive, with a lot of private jokes. Hal knew how it had felt to the rest of their friends, now, when he and Ley got going.
Lockhart, in one of those rare moments he seemed to remember he was one of the responsible adults in the room, started ushering people out,
from Draco, which had an introduction explaining Roald Dahl’s character had been, unbeknownst to the author himself, inspired by a young witch who lived next door when he was a child, and proceeded to tell her (allegedly true) story.
“Come in, come in. Oh, you shouldn't have.” She added when Hal handed her the flowers and hamper, which he could only assume were for her.
“But he’s dead.” Ron said, in a way Hal could tell he was trying to convince himself as much as others. “And the philosopher’s stone was destroyed.”
“Oh, please.” She looked mildly horrified. “Call me Lana. Gabriel was a Ravenclaw himself, just like our Anthony. I’m glad the House rivalries seem to be less intense than they were when he first told me about all of this!”
They reached the point where they’d have to part ways, and Anthony darted towards the stairs leading up to Ravenclaw tower.
“She won’t let him play.” Lee said, clearly the only one who had already caught up to their train of thought. “He’s a first year.”
He darted down the stairs, and Hal was now the one following him. They headed in the direction of the Potions classroom, and Snape’s office, and they were only halfway there when they ran into Draco, completely fine and oblivious.
“No, they’re real.” Draco explained. “They’re a submissive species, they serve Wizarding houses and families. We have a few, I don’t know them all to be honest. Dilly is in the kitchen, and… well, Dobby. You call him when you want something.”
“I’m trans, obviously.” Pan explained. “But I’m not sure if I’m attracted to boys or girls, or both, or neither. I’ve not really thought about it yet, nor do I want to – got enough to figure out at the moment.”
“I know what happened next.” Snape snapped. “What I don’t know is why three first-year students seem to be stupid enough to try and break into the potions storeroom while a troll is wandering about the dungeons.”
Little Silver hissed, endearingly looking almost like he was placing himself in front of Hal to protect him against the threatening other cats.
“Hal said you outgrew yours.” He explained, clearly nervously waiting to see whether or not Ley would like and accept the gift.
Ley huffed and puffed, but in the end he joined Hal on the sofa, who didn’t really mind, because he was playing with Little John Silver. He’d hold a little piece of parchment up, and the young cat would jump to try and catch it, as Hal lifted his hand at the last moment to pull it out of his reach. Three out of four times, Sil was quicker.
’d the parchment, pressed his fists to his closed eyes and refrained from screaming. After a few steadying breaths, he thought maybe he should – find Hermione, that is.
Also, in the book… Nothing the fuck happens for a while at this point?? The timeline is actually really confusing when reading recaps (sadly I don’t have the actual books with me to check if it’s clearer), because the next big event is Hermione’s attack, which in some summaries happens just before the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff game (?) and causes it (and every game after that) to be cancelled, but that fixture is at the start of March, and according to other sources Hermione and Penelope get petrified in *May* (followed by Fudge’s visit to Hagrid and Dumbledore’s removal)… Which makes more sense in terms of the timings, otherwise what, things are at a standstill for another three and a half months, with no further attacks? Students go home for Easter and then come back?
Oh Merlin, there was going to be a murder. Hal panicked, running frantically after where he thought the voice was coming from, which was made difficult because although clear to him, it was only a faint hiss, and his own footsteps covered it as he followed it.
Draco wasn’t sure what he was even going to say, but he was interrupted anyway as the door slid open, and Anthony and Neville appeared in the door-frame.
teacher would have it out for him personally, but he couldn’t help but think he’d been proven right once, even though the Potions master’s attitude towards him had minutely mellowed.
“You know.” Narcissa suddenly spoke, her voice soft, and Petunia realised she was looking at her. “I used to despise your kind.”
“You are a catch.” She asserted. “You were right when you rained down on Millie, by the way. That troll has another thing coming if she thinks she’ll be able to bag an heir, acting like she is. No class whatsoever. Unlike you.”
“Oh. Well. You see, this bank and all wizarding finances, really, are managed by Goblins. They smith the coins, and so this is the arrangement we have with them. As such, they have a certain… liberty, to distribute the wealth as they see fit. As they see fair, I should say. You may have heard for examples that Goblins consider the maker of an object their true owner, and not the person who buys it.”
“I know.” Hal assured. “And I don’t want to just be like Oh, alright, convenient, let’s go with that then. I’m still… figuring myself out.”
“Well, yeah. You guys.” Pan frowned when Ron just looked at him. “You do know you’re in there somewhere in the Black family tree, right? I mean, go back far enough, all the Pureblood Houses are related.
Anthony stared at him for a second before he remembered, from Dumbledore’s start of year speech, what he was on about, and burst out laughing. Hal followed suit, and they spent a couple of minutes in hysterics, releasing the shock of what had just happened.
Hal hadn’t called in weeks, and now he felt like the worst son in the world, as he’d only called thinking of himself, because he needed to hear her voice and feel as close to a hug as he possibly could. He burst into tears.
Maybe he was just tired. He felt like the start of the year had been stressful. He’d felt stressed about Pan joining their group, and how the others would react. He’d felt stressed about hanging out with the Slytherins a bit more often as a result, and putting himself in the way of Flint – though nothing had happened, so far, the very few encounters he’d had had been short, distant, like Draco was just another kid and there was no history there. He’d felt stressed about hiding his crush on Hal, half the time convinced that everyone could see right through him.
, he fully realised now, as his parents were getting murdered in front of him. He couldn’t help but picture it now – he had been right there as a madman broke into their home, pointed his wand at his dad, at his mom,
“Oh my god, we’re moving.” Hermione jumped to look through the window and wave frenetically at the crowd, even though her parents had stayed on the other side. “Here we go! Did you know magical locations don’t actually exist in a parallel space? They’re just, in a space next to the Muggle space. The spells mean people without magic won’t notice them, but it’s not like, out of thin air, even if it looks that way.”
“Lockhart says a lot of shit.” Hal retorted – having personally been the subject of some of that shit, he tended to dismiss anything that came out of the man’s mouth even more promptly than before.
Ley shrugged, genuinely not bothered, easygoing as he always was. He was only curious – and that prompted him to carry on questioning.
“Severus.” She addressed him, looking bewildered. “Mister Longbottom made very little sense, what on earth…”
“Yeah.” Rolf frowned. “I mean, I don’t see what else. They don’t have specific magical abilities or properties otherwise, as far as I know. What’s going on?”
In some ways, though it felt a little cruel to the man to think it, Sirius had actually done him a favour.
A nurse came through the doors leading to the operating rooms, and both Hal and his aunt jumped to their feet. She gave them a warm smile.
“It’s Harry Potter.” She whispered, though loud enough for them to hear from where they were. “It’s Harry Potter, it’s Harry Potter, it’s Harry Potter.”
“Muggles are clever, when they put their mind to it.” He commented. Then, with a conniving smile. “So, this Hermione…”
“I suppose she is known to have made one actual prophecy.” Lupin mused, surprising Hal somewhat, but he didn’t get a chance to ask as Lupin placed a hand on his shoulder. “I’ll mention it to the Headmaster.” He committed as if to put Hal’s mind at rest. “Shall we get started?”
“Brilliant, we’ve lost him.” Anthony commented as the poltergeist went through a wall some distance away.
“Thanks, anyway.” Hal smiled at him. “I thought it wouldn’t bother me if I didn’t understand what they’re saying, but… actually, it’s worse.”
Quirinus Quirrell made a decision. Like Albus, like Severus, the Potter boy would have to be removed.
“Was she always like this?” He asked, because he couldn’t imagine Narcissa giving Draco hugs and kissing him good night, but he also couldn’t imagine growing up without all that.
. Most of them seemed to reluctantly tear themselves away from the scene, though Hal’s friends stayed back when Lockhart ran off with the remaining groups of students, and Hal was left mostly alone with a scowling Snape.
“Yes.” Hal confirmed. “We were down there. He wasn’t. But he wanted to make it so people would believe he was the hero of the story. He’d been boasting about it for months, pretending he knew where to find the monster and all that.”
Parkinson Hall was – in Draco’s humble opinion – a monstrosity. The house itself had originally been a grand sixteenth century mansion, probably quite alluring at the time, but each subsequent generation had made alterations, most of them ill-advised, and the result five hundred years or so later was something in very poor taste, both inside and outside. The less that was said about the topiaries, the better.
When they moved on to the front room for coffee – Pan thanking both parents profusely for lunch, and didn’t that feel new and novel not to act like everything was owed to him; it was actually kind of nice – Anthony and Pan held back for a moment.
He wasn’t sleeping well, he couldn’t remember where he’d been sometimes, like he’d fallen asleep during the day or something. It wasn’t like him, but so much had been changing and happening lately, he didn’t know what to attribute it to.
This, he thought, would at least made it plausible that he had indeed spoken to Sirius. He would have been unlikely to know the term otherwise. Draco hadn’t used it when he’d told him about his godfather in the first place, Hal wasn’t sure he knew it.
The whole group turned as one, and the Hufflepuff boy that had called out Hal’s name looked a little startled, but he looked straight at him – obviously he didn’t need Hal to answer or confirm his identity.
“No, not just them!” Hermione insisted. “I have heard several older students saying he was very different when he taught Muggle Studies.”
He wasn’t sure how Anthony’s family would receive him, but he figured he could at least have a rest stop there, get something to eat if they felt generous enough, renew his charms, maybe use their Floo to book a room somewhere. He wasn’t expecting them to let him stay with them for the next three weeks before term started, even if Anthony himself had clearly wanted to be supportive, it was a lot to ask. But he was hoping he’d find at least a little kindness there, before he was on his way. Anthony’s parents seemed alright, every time he’d talked about them.
“Oh, no.” Draco smiled. “But I will be among the ones leading the matching season, in a few years, when we come to that. You know what the word of a Malfoy can do to debutantes trying to catch the eye of a good Pureblood son. And
“It wasn’t.” Hal interrupted. “It didn’t harm me. And I didn’t know it was from him before I opened it.” He added, surprising himself how genuinely defensive he felt and sounded, even as he made the whole thing up. “I would have been more careful otherwise, obviously. But I guess it was fine.”
“Right.” He seemed to be making mental notes. “Telling people, before committing to starting the treatment, is a way to gauge their reactions. It will give you a better idea of the support network you can expect to count on during your transition, and if you find you cannot deal with it, it might make you reconsider.”
“How did you even get a dragon?” Draco asked, pulling Hal back to what he thought was a safer distance.
“Ah, ah, now.” She said, still kindly, though there was something in her eyes Hal didn’t like the look of. “It’s a bad, bad world out there, Harry.”
He stopped as his foot made a splashing sound, and he looked down to see water all over the corridor.
“Well, everyone at school was talking about it.” Ley said. “Some people I’m pretty sure I had never spoken to before have asked me if you’re alright and told me how hard it must be.”
“The surgery went very well.” She said. “Dudley will need to take it easy for a bit of recovery time, but he be completely fine.”
In truth, he didn’t see why a round number should make a difference. This year was unlike any other for a lot of different reasons, and the fact that it had been a decade was only a small one among them.
“Yeah.” Hal scoffed. “For all the good it’s doing me. So far, one’s a teacher who hates my guts and the other is in jail for associating with the man who killed them.”
After a few minutes of goofing around, they were interrupted as Dora appeared and walked up to their table, looking a bit sombre.
“Was it weird for you growing up?” Ron suddenly asked. “I mean, with your aunt, with your cousin being her son and you being her nephew…”
Hal laughed at her enthusiasm. He was still finding the whole thing very weird, but it was also kind of nice that people were so happy to see him.
was too understated a word. For all his thirteen years, he was tall, tanned, still youthful and innocent but a clear picture of the man he’d become – call Dora crazy, she had an instinct for these things. Being a Metamorphmagus meant you spent a lot of time looking at features – your own and others’. This kid would have been snapped up in half a second to model for Burberry, or some equivalent, if they’d laid eyes on him.
Whistles and cheers erupted around the room, mostly from the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor tables. Rolf looked slightly startled, and Neville turned a deep shade of pink. Dumbledore’s voice seemed to sound a little louder, no doubt magically enhanced, as the continued his enumeration to cover the sound of the bustling room.
Draco was, frustratingly, only the third of their friends to visit Hal during the holiday, due to commitment his mother had already made for him – the Easter break was always prime time for reasserting one’s place in society, which in terms of Narcissa Malfoy’s events calendar meant shopping, politics and lots of parties. Draco was definitely too old now to get a pass, he was probably only a year shy of being officially seen as the head of the family, and not just its young heir.
A weak chirp dragged him out of his thoughts, and he saw a miserable-looking bird perched on an intricate golden contraption next to Dumbledore’s desk. It looked really old, and probably like it couldn’t fly anymore. Hal got up to say hello.
The fact that he had escaped Azkaban was… a little disturbing. She imagined him on the run, pictured scenarios Alexandre Dumas would have been proud of. Maybe she read too much. She had suggested to her mom trying to reach out, to send him a message so they could help him, but-
“Hermione.” Draco snorted. “These are fifth and seven year exams. Please don’t tell me you’ve started studying for them.”
“Wait, and their best solution was to have you, even if you’re not meant to be even allowed to try out?” Ley looked impressed. “You’re that good?”
“Come on.” Anthony encouraged them to pile into the compartment. “It’s this or stand in the corridor.”
Taking Harry in had been the only thing she had strongly stood up to Vernon about. She had not shown him a lot of love after this, but she had been able to tell herself she was honouring her sister's memory by not sending him off to a children's home, like Vernon had suggested. Now she looked at the two boys, with suddenly more in common than they should have, she thought it wasn't too late to do right by them, right by Harry, right by Lily, and even by Lily’s husband, as much as she had hated the mere idea of him; he really had only been a stupid teenager, who had never gotten the chance to grow into anything else. If Dudley deserved to know good things about his father growing up, then Harry did too. And if Petunia Dursley had never taken the time to treat him right - maybe Petunia Evans could.
Pansy looked like she was going to snap something back at him again, but she paused, her lips parted, considering.
“Look, there.” Hal parroted, interrupting. He wasn’t cowed, they didn’t look like they would resort to violence beyond their words, and he had no intention of playing along. “I appreciate your commitment to the game, but I don’t have time for this. If Cedric feels threatened by me, then he should keep training. And if that was just you, then shouldn’t you have a bit more faith in your team? Right? Okay, bye.”
, and everything that came with it, but also from what Narcissa had written to her mom about him. Draco appeared to have him and a large group of friends by his side at Hogwarts, good on him, and Harry sounded like a feisty, brave, reckless kid, who wasn’t quite done defying expectations and facing off He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. It was all very impressive, for a little boy.
Draco and his friends sat in a corner of the courtyard, little groups orbiting all around them, everyone catching up with friends they’d not found on the train. Anthony had his back to them as he greeted Michael and Terry, Dean and Seamus attached themselves to one side as they started chatting to Ron, Hal and Neville, while Blaise loudly came to greet Pan and Draco, followed by the other Slytherins in their year, more subdued and wary-looking.
He had been to the Burrow once when he was eight – Molly Weasley had been shopping in Diagon Alley for Percy’s school supplies, him and her two eldest running along. Narcissa had just been out to a few shops herself, and she’d done the social thing and talked to Molly. Seeing Draco eyeing the tall pile of ice cream boxes she was also carrying, Mrs Weasley had said she was taking this back to the rest of her children and asked if he wanted to join them. Narcissa had seen no objection – Lucius had been highly disapproving of the Weasleys, but she didn’t really care. They were, after all, distant cousins. So Draco had gone, and spent the afternoon with them. He’d come out exhausted, but he’d had quite a lot of fun.
As if to illustrate her point, there was a sudden commotion towards where the children were, and both mothers were on their feet faster than if the seat has been on fire.
). “So you don’t know much about your parents’ friends at school, and what you know isn’t great. Maybe it’s better this way. I know who my parents’ friends are, and they’re all followers of You-Know-Who or posh arseholes who don’t care either way as long as
“Us.” Theodore corrected. He waved at Vince and Greg – Millicent was thankfully absent, as much as she sometimes hung around with them. “We’re all friends, right? Or do you prefer being an honorary Gryffindor or Ravenclaw these days?”
Hal shrugged. “Ignore him. Make it clear I’m not interested. I’m telling you, he’s not some kind of awful predator. He was just looking for a bit of fun. I don’t have to play along.”
It was too kind of her, to assume that was the reason why Draco hadn’t written more often the previous year, but he did not want to think about the real causes or dive into that guilt again, so he pushed those thoughts out of his mind too.
you had turned eleven. It had felt odd to see her turn twelve when he was only just eleven, but she wasn’t the only one.
“Nearly-Headless Nick!” He blurted out, his heart beating like crazy. “You scared the sh- You scared me.”
“Well, that settles it anyway.” Ron sighed, and expanded when everyone else gave him a questioning look. “We definitely can’t ask him.”
When it turned out she was neither Pansy nor Daphne, but Greg, it took them all a while to recover – even Draco thought it was pretty funny, until Greg stopped being miffed about it and started being disgusting, squeezing his – her – breasts first experimentally, then downright inappropriately.
.) and he had such a bright smile and he – he was smothering Draco in a hug. Definitely a tiny bit taller.
Hal had never given much thought to Professor Quirrell as a person – he was an alright teacher, the Defence classes were enjoyable, and so far he had been a neutral presence in the school landscape.
“If anything, you would have been able to better track that his movements coincided with Scabbers’, being in the same room.” Fred insisted.
“Oh, they do.” Hal scoffed bitterly. “There’s that stupid prophecy, people have been thanking me for a decade for saving them, while all I did was have parents who died for me. So of course they expect something of me now I’m older – and before you say anything, I know, I’ve not made it any better by getting myself in a situation where I’ve faced Voldemort again twice, though I could argue that’s also not really my fault. And did you notice how Dumbledore was again conveniently away? Sends me a bird and a fucking sword? He’s
Some scenes in this chapter are similar in some ways to what a school shooting would be like – it’s brief, and there's no actual guns, but please heed this as a warning if that doesn’t work for you.
“It’s a real shame you’re not in Slytherin.” He said. “You seem to get along with the kids there alright.”
To be fair, Draco loved the kitten too. It might have had something to do with the favouritism the feline showed towards him – apart from Hal, if anyone tried to pet him, they’d probably end up mauled. Draco, however, seemed to have earned the privilege of being able to scratch him under his neck without losing a finger.
“There is a werewolf in the school.” He pressed on. “We can hide, and stay quiet and hope he won’t come this way, but how many hours is it till dawn? Someone
NEWTs and her Potions grades are right near the top as well. Actually, in her NEWTs, she only came second to Professor Snape, but well, he got full marks there so it’s hard to top that.”
Hal’s eyes snapped back to Quirrell, who clearly hadn’t spoken, because he looked about as startled as Hal upon hearing the hissing voice.
Apart from that, he seemed nice and funny – so did his cousin, but also a real handful, especially when the two of them combined their efforts. Dora could tell Petunia was a rather formidable woman, to keep these two in check.
“Yeah, actually. Ley says school sucks but I think he’s doing alright, he seems to have mates. And I’d asked my aunt about my parents’ school friends, I thought it’d be nice to see photos of them, or at least get an idea of who they were. She didn’t have any last names, but she said there was a kid from Cokeworth they met when they were young, Sev, and he was one of my mom’s closest friends at least until fourth or fifth year, and there was a Marlene, and then when she was a bit older and she started dating my dad she seemed to talk a lot about his friends, who were Peter, Remus and Sirius.”
“Oh, look at you.” He whispered, feeling sorry for the creature but not quite daring to reach out and stroke his lacklustre feathers.
He checked the young witch was safely behind him, before pushing open the door to the last chamber. He knew immediately they were too late – not necessarily in a morbid way, but the battle, if there had been one, had already been fought. Harry Potter was lying not far from the door unconscious, and all that was left of Quirrell (and the entity he supposedly had been hosting) was singed purple fabric and black charcoal-like dust.
That was the date that had been set for the start of the trial, and therefore the date they’d decided to go for their school shopping as well.
“Like I said, pretty much my entire life.” Pan said. “But it was something that was hard to understand for a long time, even for me, so I suppose I fully came to terms with it last summer. And I thought about it a lot during the year, and decided to go ahead with the physical transition.”
“Then, under proper supervision, which can be my own, it is a fairly straightforward process.” Sev concluded reassuringly. “You may have heard of more invasive approaches, there are spells as well, but these are usually only required for fully grown adults. There is no need to take the risk if starting at a young age.”
“We can make this much worse for you.” Flint carried on and threatened. “What’s a little money to you? You wouldn’t want us to find your friends in our way, would you?”
They had, indeed, earlier in the week, planned for a friendly game of Quidditch that weekend – minus Hermione and Neville who had politely but firmly refused to get on a broom, ever, unless it was a matter of life or death.
If you like to comment, I'd love to hear what you've thought of each chapter - suggestions welcome :)
“Something personal about himself.” Hal interrupted, getting up. “No particular reason. We’re bonding. Lunch?”
She felt a little pang, pre-emptively missing her son already, when the thought struck her that he was only there exceptionally for the weekend, that he would be back at school the next day and that she’d spent another two months, almost, of not seeing him. Again, Draco’s mood seemed to align to hers, his smile falling.
“I know.” Hal nodded. “We’ll be up bright and early to get everything tidy and help you in the kitchen.” He said teasingly, almost reciting.
His appendix had burst, a nurse had told them. He had to have surgery right away, but it was a common procedure and they shouldn’t worry. Hal knew getting your appendix removed was a common procedure. He also knew it was less common, and a lot riskier, when it had already burst.
“The person controlling the beast was caught.” Blaise argued. “I don’t know about the beast itself. It wasn’t clear, actually. It seems it was covered up from the students at the time, so the details got a bit lost. I only know the student was awarded a trophy, I checked it out actually, it’s still there in the Trophy Room. Tom Riddle.”
“What the hell.” He told Draco once they were outside. “What am I supposed to do with that information?”
Anthony had suggested to rope in his cousin Rolf, because he did know an awful lot about magical creatures. He was a year above them, in Ravenclaw, and it hadn’t been easy to pin him because he skipped most meals in favour of walking the grounds trying to catch glumbumbles, but they managed to find him and sit around him (Gryffindors included) at the Halloween banquet – minus Draco, who had noticed Snape wasn’t at the teachers’ table, had said something about him being a killjoy out of principle, and decided to bring him some of the pumpkin pie he secretly loved down to his office.
Also, it was their only shot. Draco held on to Hal’s hand like a lifeline, and when Lockhart swished and started saying
Distracted by the pain, he missed the first jerk of his broomstick. With the second, he thought he’d momentarily lost control while he was clutching at his head. The third one, however, was unmistakable, like someone had grabbed the tip of Hal’s broom and shaken it. As Hal was sharply pulled in one direction and then the opposite, he knew clearly it was nothing he was doing.
“It didn’t seem like the right time, with what happened to Hermione, but…” Pan shrugged. “Maybe you need the distraction right now.”
Upon a warning look from his mother, however, Ley did not voice his obvious disappointment, and they said their goodbyes to their friends promising they’d meet up again soon enough.
, and he only stopped and turned around once he was at the top of the stairs leading to the dungeons. Anthony had tagged along.
His parents’ expressions started to crumble, though they were obviously still coming to grasp with the turn the conversation was taking.
Draco was breathless from impatience as he stood at the bottom of the stairs from the garden (a swooping flight of wide white marble steps leading up to the Manor’s main doors, a little ostentatious if you asked him, but he kind of loved them all the same) waiting for the Portkey to pull Hal, his cousin and his aunt from thin air. His mother was standing a few feet behind, by the door, watching him with some amusement, but also seemingly looking forward to their guests’ arrival. Draco knew she’d exchanged a few letters with Hal’s aunt, not just to organise their trip but also just to chat, and he was glad his mother could talk to her new friend freely. He wondered if they talked about them – he was sure they did, after all they were all they’d had in common as a starting point, but he’d decided not to dwell on the idea.
It was lunchtime, now, or at least it would be once this hour was actually up, so they wouldn’t need to go to their next class for a little while longer. And he had time to find Minerva and the other professors, in the meantime, to inform them of what had happened.
“I’m fine.” Draco pre-empted before any question came. “I just didn’t sleep well, it’s got nothing to do with… I’m fine.”
“Good.” Snape nodded shortly. “Today, however, I do realise what the date is, so I will consider your extenuating circumstances, and accept that I owe you some leniency. Now go. And for Merlin’s sake, get some sleep.”
“Man.” Lee told him during one of their ‘strategy breaks’ – which was mostly Fred gesticulating to throw off the other team. “You’re a fast flyer.”
just a graffiti on the wall. That didn’t exactly prove that the real Chamber of Secrets had been open (if it even existed at all), let alone that the actual Heir of Slytherin (if there still were any) had opened it.
As soon as they were on the ground, Oliver grabbed Angelina, Fred and Hal in one big hug, and he was actually crying.
“I like how you assume I also volunteer for this.” He noted. “Which would make you right again, by the way.” He added with a sigh.
It didn’t help matters when they made an alarming discovery one day at the dinner table. The Hogwarts elves had clearly decided to be a little creative, and amongst the usual offering or roasted meats and veg, were dishes of seafood risotto. Delighted, Luna revealed she’d never had seafood before, as her father absolutely abhorred anything fishy, and helped herself to a generous portion.
Time to go. They filed up back into the house, gathering their things in front of the main hall fireplace – the one in the sitting room was the one they usually used for small trips, but they needed one large enough to go through with their luggage this time. Draco could see on Hal’s aunt’s face that her previous experiences of Flooing hadn’t left her feel greatly enthusiastic about this means of transportation. Then again, she’d only done it to rush to Hal’s side when he’d gotten injured at Hogwarts, so he couldn’t really blame her.
It seemed to pull Hal out of the state he was in, and he jumped to his feet, even as Dora was assuring the man they were fine.
Hal put his finger on the figure of a younger girl, delicately drawn, wearing dungarees and welly boots and her curly hair down.
He’d never claimed one till then, but it felt right to say it. He loved Ron, Hermione, Neville and Anthony to bits, but Draco was special. He was the first wizard his age he’d met. He was the one who didn’t ooh and aah at his name, he was the one Hal wanted to take on his outdoor adventures, and if he was honest with himself, the one he’d missed the most over the summer.
“Well, it did almost get stolen from Gringotts.” Hal pointed out. “And as far as we know, nobody got past that dog, have they?”
Pan shrugged nonchalantly. “I do it behind her back. No harm done. That’s what she’s never understood. Pureblood politics, gotta be born into it.”
Hal woke up in a cold sweat, almost feeling the weight of the basilisk still on him, the piercing pain in his arm, the blood trickling down his body. It hadn’t happened in months – he wasn’t so sure what had triggered the nightmare, maybe seeing everyone’s fears played out earlier that day – but it was just as unpleasant as it had been over the summer.
“It’s perfect.” Draco commented softly, reaching across Neville and Anthony to give Pan’s hand a short squeeze.
“I want to go home.” Hal let out, not sure if the raw honesty was going to work to sway her, or only appear weak. At this point, either way, his bravado was slipping.
“I wouldn’t say this is simple.” Severus moderated in a warning tone. “The potions are one thing, which has to be done right, rigorously, for the next several years. But there are more aspects than the purely chemical to any transition.
They all scrambled to their feet before she could finish talking, abandoning their lunch to run to the nearest quill and parchment.
He nudged the charred remains of what had been Quirrell with this foot, and found two wands, his own and presumably Potter’s, which he bent to pick up and pocketed. There was nothing else in the room, at first glance at least, but the damn mirror – Albus had clearly thought it was
“He’s a professor.” Hal looked spooked at the idea. “I can’t go off asking him personal questions like that.”
“Mister Potter.” The lawyer started, his voice sickly sweet like he was talking to a much smaller child. “There seems to be quite a few elements of your story that don’t add up. You said you can’t remember what spell Mister Lockhart used?”
But Mrs Norris wasn’t, and Hal needed to find a way to get out of there, fast, before she or her master returned. He glanced back at the fireplace, considering using it to Floo back where he was meant to be, but he didn’t really fancy going through that again. The door was locked, he tried it cautiously. It left the window.
As he looked back to the mirror, and managed to drag his eyes away from the couple for a moment, he saw there were more figures – behind his dad, an older couple both bearing a resemblance to him, Hal’s grandparents no doubt, and behind them, more wizards and witches. Cousins, friends, a whole world oh people who could have taught him so much about his heritage.
“Tried to snog it, more like.” George (maybe Fred) added, clasping his other shoulder. “Nice rodeo up there, buddy.”
He didn’t know why he took it personally still – Draco hadn’t told any of them. Even Anthony, and they shared a room, for Merlin’s sake. Unless Anthony knew, in which case Hal would need to have words.
She still wanted to check what had happened to Draco in order to make the correct dosage decisions. Draco stiffened against Severus at the idea of telling the tale. He remembered Riddle taking over, his will and consciousness slipping and he all but watched himself walk Hal through the castle then into and below the bathroom, and his energy, his life slowly being leeched away from him, even though everything became darkness until he woke up again back in the Chamber, a bloodied Hal leaning over him and the enormous corpse of the snake behind them. It was terrifying if not humiliating.
Hal thought he saw Draco flinch as she spoke, but he didn’t have time to look closely as she barrelled on.
The next time it came into view, it was Hal’s opposite number who saw it and dived for it. Hal went right after him, to stop him catching him more than to catch it himself – steadily, his team had been closing the gap, but they were still a goal (and the points for the Snitch) short of victory. He batted the other boy’s hand away inches from the golden ball, and then several things happened at once.
“Hal, darling, I have not told you this before, because I wasn’t sure if this would be relevant, but you are now old enough, and well, this letter confirms it - you…”
“Good.” Anthony beamed. “With all the love I owe Hal and you guys, of course.” He added, turning to the Gryffindors.
books from Hal, a scarf from Ron (he maintained that his mom had taught him how to magic-knit, and had not done those things herself), a reading light to clip on the top of books (complete with spare batteries) from Hermione and a soft leather sheath for his pocket watch from Anthony.
Ron’s sister was in the doorway, clearly trying to look uninterested, though the way she tapped her foot against the frame gave away that she was all wired up with excitement. She was tall, for a ten year-old at least, and while she was wearing her bright ginger hair in pigtails, they were French-plaited (a term Hal had learnt from the Patil twins, who braided their hair
“I wanted to let you know right away.” Sirius said. “They’ll be sending Dementors to Hogwarts, just in case he’s coming after Harry. They don’t think it’s that likely but they don’t want to take the chance.”
Hal had a little frown. “Yeah.” He confirmed like it was obvious. “We weren’t just down there having a cuppa.”
They both sat, and looked at Pansy, waiting for her to speak. After a couple of minutes she sighed, straightened up, and gestured at herself.
Spending an entire afternoon with other Pureblood children while their parents where having a garden party had never been Draco’s idea of a good time, even in previous years; they were always just hanging together, half bored and half looking for trouble, and each time Draco thought he’d rather be in the library, left alone to curl up with a book. But now that they were also all
Hermione, next, got Sugar Quills from Ron, a notebook that automatically reorganised your notes from Anthony, magical bath bombs from Hal (one that was like lying in a meadow surrounded by flowers and birdsong, and another that played classical music), a collection of hair ties and clips from Neville and
She waved her wand all over him, no doubt casting diagnosis spells, and seemed more or less satisfied with the readings.
In his room, Hal was sat in a ball on his bed, back against the wall, knees up, arms over his head. Petunia had seen the pose before – football try-outs at school when they were eight, for example, and Hal wasn’t sure he was good enough to make the team. This was Hal’s deep insecurities rearing their heads.
Obviously, that was when the other end of the corridor filled with students coming out of the feast, and the first screams started sounding.
Draco thought his conversation with Severus had gone well, all things considered. He had been his grumpy old self at first, when Draco was trying roundabout ways to make his point and getting absolutely nowhere, so in the end he’d asked point blank.
The train ride was a great deal of fun, Hal and Anthony having somehow managed to come up with a whole new game loosely based on exploding snap but using chocolate frog cards – and the increasingly ludicrous rules they were making up to use all the cards was testament to just how many of those frogs they’d eaten between all of them.
“Also, there were a few times over the summer. Like, at Harry’s place, I thought you were kiiind of staring at his brother and sister.”
Hal beamed again, his smile as bright as his eyes, and Draco loved him so much it hurt. I have to tell him, he thought.
He meant to say that it was rather risky putting all your eggs in one basket, and what if something happened to the one and only heir, or he didn’t want children to continue the line? But he could only manage so much.
“Anthony has told us a little about you.” Mrs Goldstein smiled at them. “You’re in Slytherin, is that right?”
He sagged a little, feeling faint, and it happened to be towards Nils, who clearly took it as an answer as he grinned widely at his sister. Fran pursed her lips slightly as her hand fell back to her side, but then she shrugged, affecting indifference.
“Let’s assume for a moment that You-Know-Who is a descendent of Slytherin.” Hermione exposed. “And, let’s imagine, so are you.”
“Dobby.” Draco said, inexplicably, until a second later a little creature appeared with a loud crack.
He took a few moments – and a couple of deep breaths – to collect himself, and let his education kick back in.
“It doesn’t have to change anything.” Draco went on. “It’s not a big deal, I just thought you should know.”
It was morning when Hal woke up next – he could tell by the light, though everything was blurred. He reached out, trying to find his glasses on the beside table, but only succeeded in knocking over the water that was still there. Feeling around for them, including in the bed and on the floor, he came up empty. The bitch had taken them. Brilliant.
The way Ron and Draco were looking at him, Hal felt like they were asking him to pick a best friend, right now, for life, no take-backs, and the one who wasn’t chosen would be mortally offended and never speak to him again. There was only one way out of this.
Draco had been doing his best to avoid groups of Slytherins around the school, whether these contained Flint and his mates or not, in the faint hope they would forget about him if they couldn’t see him. Unfortunately, they obviously didn’t, and rather seemed to be seeking him out.
“Oh, darling.” Petunia sighed. “Magic doesn’t solve everything. I’m sure medical spells would be just as hard to learn as regular medicine.”
“No, wait.” Anthony was catching up. “A secret room only the Heir of Slytherin can open and a creature only he can control.”
This last chapter is split into 3 parts, but I will post them in quicker succession and not with a week-long gap between each part!
Understanding dawned, clear on the Professor’s features. But to his credit, beyond that, he didn’t display surprise, or as Pan had feared, either amusement or disgust. He remained very serious, giving her his full attention.
“Admittedly, that would have been the most likely match when we were both younger.” Draco recognised when Pan only shrugged.
He looked dazed, his eyes unfocused, which immediately had Hal worried as he slipped his phone into his pocket. Draco had been moody for a while, even his birthday and the treats he’d received from his mother and his friends (they’d pooled together to get him a box of luxury salted caramel-filled chocolate broomsticks from a renowned Belgian chocolatier) hadn’t cheered him up.
“Oh, yeah.” Hal complied, dashing back to their little camp. It only took him a minute so slip back into his jeans and t-shirt, and we skipped back still barefoot to where his admirers stood.
“Use him.” She’d shrugged one time Hal had been complaining about getting ambushed for an autograph again.
Severus was silent for a moment, and when he spoke, he changed the subject – which was as good as an admission that Draco had had the last word on the previous matter.
“At that point, they were going to close the school.” Blaise carried on. “But a student apparently caught the culprit, who was letting a monster loose in the school, and so it stopped.”
“It makes me sad thinking about it.” He confessed. “Not because I want a sister.” He added quickly. “But… because I have you, and Auntie, and we’re happy, you know? I’m happy. And then the stupid magic mirrors shows me that, which is supposed to be my truest desire or something, and what am I meant to do with that? I don’t want to be told I should miss something I never had, when what I have is perfectly fine.”
“I never-” Peter stammered. “The Weasley boys have been good to me, I have been a good pet in return, I-”
He dumped a large bouquet of flowers into Hal’s arms, readjusted a box under his arm, passed him what felt like a wicker basket, tightened his grip on a bottle of wine and made sure another bundle was tucked in the crook of his elbow.
He wasn’t downplaying for the sake of his teacher; there had been some whispers and some looks, especially at the start, but on the whole, either out of House solidarity or out of genuine disinterest, Pan had been surprised to see an overwhelming majority of his housemates just leave him alone.
“Okay.” Hermione made everyone jump as she slammed a pile of books onto the table. “So the Chamber of Secrets is this old legend dating back to when Hogwarts was founded. There is almost
Petunia had reached the conclusion over the years that there was a very strong chance Harry was as magical as his parents had been. All sorts of odd little things happening around him pointed to it, and reminded her of Lily at the same age. She tried to nurture the boy without encouraging it – she was making amends for rejecting her sister and calling her a freak when she should have been there for her, venturing into a whole new scary world, but as far as she was concerned, until confirmed otherwise, Harry was part of
a common magical creature then there must be Muggle reports in other legends across the world, between the ancient Greeks and now.”
“Well.” Hermione winced. “They obviously know something happened to me, the school had to warn them. But they downplayed it, I think. They didn’t want all the parents rushing in, so they said it was temporary and they had an antidote coming and not to worry, basically. I think they might have said we had to be in a sort of quarantine, to justify why they couldn’t come and see us. I’m not sure what they would have done if the mandrakes hadn’t worked out, they must have been pretty confident, though I suppose maybe it was best not to alarm them before they tried. So yeah.” She sighed. “They basically think I had a bad bout of… chickenpox, or something. They’re relieved I’m okay now, but I don’t think they were ever overly worried.”
Draco was hardly surprised. The Manor was full of secret passageways, chambers and shortcuts, a lot of which had been the grounds of many an adventure when he was younger. He knew his father had kept some pretty dark stuff hidden from his younger self for safety – or from the law, and probably often both.
Petunia Dursley had not realised her entire life revolved around her husband until after she lost him. She saw herself as a devoted wife and a devoted mother; she was now finding out that, Vernon gone, she did not know who she was anymore. She had become a Dursley, as part of thoroughly rejecting her sister when she herself became Lily Potter, to such an extent that Petunia Evans seemed to no longer exist. Sitting in her empty living room, that night after the wake, the overwhelming scent of flowers around her, and all the commiserating acquaintances having finally left, she looked at Dudley curled up on the sofa, her little boy of four who would probably not remember his father. She looked at her nephew Harry, asleep next to him, who would definitely not remember his. He would not remember his mother either, and Petunia found herself feeling a wave of sorrow for the loss of her sister, one she hadn't felt before and that overtook the grief she knew she should be feeling towards her dearly departed husband.
He had been furious. He had been heartbroken. He hadn’t spoken to his mother for three days, until she arranged for Hal to come to the Manor later that month, the day before his actual birthday, so they could celebrate together.
– Colin Creevey was following him around like a forlorn puppy, and it was seriously getting on his last nerve – and that Lockhart was downright ridiculous.
“No?” Hal attempted to lie in a small voice, but the matron’s piercing look made him babble on. “I mean, it hurt a few times before. Since I’ve been here, mostly, never really back home. Hum. In Defence class, mostly. I think. In the Great Hall a few times. I don’t know.”
“Yeah, there are a few other kids in there who don’t look great.” Draco gestured vaguely to the rest of the infirmary behind him. “I’ve heard a fourth year say it’s like this every year. It starts spreading round and Pomfrey runs out of potions quicker than she can replace them. Sev’s been making his Advanced classes brew medicinal draughts, though, so you should be sorted soon.”
They walked through and Hal thought it smelt like that time they’d visited a mate’s grandma’s house, who had five dogs, on a rainy day. Then they looked up.
“I saw you write it in a few times.” Hal confessed. “And I thought it was just a diary, or notes or something, but knowing that it’s
, but Hal could tell the thrill of the adventure was starting to gain on all of them, as the rest of his friends – even Hermione – headed towards the door in the path Neville’s and Hal’s lights were clearing for them. Not that there was any other way than onwards.
“Well, people don’t necessarily know as early as you and me.” She shrugged. “I suppose you’ll find out when he starts showing interest in having
“I swapped them on purpose. Giving Greg the woman.” She winced. “That backfired a bit, but…” She shrugged. “I love it. Being a man. The way people look at you, the way they treat you, it’s so… You wouldn’t know, you’re a boy. You should try being a girl, maybe you’d understand. I want…”
First he had thought about the whole ordeal in the Chamber of Secrets, because he couldn’t think of a moment he had been more scared and vulnerable, but the screams in his head hadn’t matched that, so in ruling it out, he didn’t see what else could be traumatising to that extent. But it didn’t have to be something he remember consciously, did it. Looking at everyone’s face, they had all reached the same conclusion. Hal’s parents had been murdered in front of him, the Killing Curse had been aimed right at his face. If that wasn’t traumatising enough…
Hal had heard about phoenixes, vaguely, though mostly as an expression. Like a phoenix from its ashes? He thought it meant something like coming back stronger? But there, he spotted it – from what he believed were just charred remains, a tiny baby bird head poke out and gave a healthy little pip.
Hal and Draco had become a lot closer friends since their chat in the owlery. Hal was pleased to see Draco could actually have fun and his stilted education hadn’t ruined him forever. They didn’t have any more too-serious-for-your-age heart to hearts, they just started hanging out with the rest of their friends – Ron and Neville, who was following them around a bit meekly at first, but was coming out of his shell more and more, and Draco’s roommate Anthony – Ravenclaws were paired up in rooms, rather than having a larger dorm for all of them. It fostered studying, apparently.
“I mean, I’m not going to start acting different or anything.” Draco shrugged. “I wanted to tell you, but you can pretend I never said anything. We’re still friends, and I know-”
Pan took a breath, and just ripped off the plaster. “I’m going to transition my body to male.” He said plainly. “I’ve been feeling off my entire life, and I’ve come to terms with the fact that it is because I am a boy, and I want my physical appearance to match that.”
“Yeah, I get it.” Ron nodded thoughtfully. “It’s nice. I mean, obviously it sucks that your parents are dead and all, but this is… also, er, good.”
at the cinema, and a massive chocolate cake with a pile of presents waiting for him back at home when they returned. It was, all in all, a good birthday.
“I’d love to meet that dog, if there’s an opportunity for it.” Rolf added, confirming he had not been fooled for a second.
in the back of his head. There was a disgusting, flat, slits-for-a-nose, shrivelled face on the man’s skull and it was
Ley looked half sheepish, half proud. “Oh, it didn’t last long with Elisa.” He said. “I’m dating Caroline now.”
Whispers ran across the hall, and Hal looked down at the table as he could see several heads turning towards him. It wasn’t hard to guess what the ‘events’ could possibly be.
“No, I don’t suppose you have.” Snape mused. “I suppose your friendship with a number of Gryffindors and Ravenclaws has helped with that.”
At least, as far as he’d come to understand, flying broomsticks were used to play sports, and not as a means of transportation, and the pointy hats were really only stout little caps with a pointy top that were mostly used for formal wear, but wands seemed to be an actual thing that everyone did magic with. Grown men and women waving a stick in the air looked ridiculous to Hal, but he supposed he’d have to get used to it.
Pan gave him an odd look, as if he’d not expected him to stand up for him, or retort that quickly. Millie grumbled something back, but Hal dragged Pan away to further up the line, away from the Slytherin girls.
“Okay.” Hal nodded. “So, we make our way quickly to the dorm, grab the map, use to see where the nearest teacher is, go give it to them, take cover wherever makes more sense. We’ll come back here if possible, but don’t worry if we don’t, we’ll stay away if it’s safer.”
Sending their offspring to school was such an occasion, though Draco wondered why some of them even bothered to come at all as he watched his mother exchange pleasantries with Celene Greengrass and Pollyana Parkinson like this was another garden party. A few paces away, William Greengrass, Rufus Parkinson, Wilbur Crabbe and Graham Goyle equally looked like they were just about ready to pop out the brandy.
The words were still sounding in Draco’s head, making him feel sick, when Anthony barged into the room.
It had been a move. He cared a lot for Hal now, as a person, regardless of whatever history they were both tangled in, but originally, yeah. He’d wanted to be his friend because he was
It was stating the obvious, and it made them feel exactly 0% better for someone to say it out loud. It fact, it seemed to solidify the dread Hal could feel in the pit of his stomach. Because if another attack had happened, in the span of time where three of their friends were away, and McGonagall was taking the rest of them personally to her office? He could put two and two together.
“Sorry.” Hal intervened. “Did you mother tell you bedside stories that were essentially about genocide?”
-	Obviously, the minor character deaths are Vernon and Lucius, and they have already happened before the story really starts.
Hal was distracted from Ron and jokes as the food disappeared (it had been epic) and the headmaster made a short speech that made very little sense, and before they knew it they were ushered out and towards their respective dormitories. The prefect was another of Ron’s brothers, the riled up one from the train, and Ron seemed just as annoyed by his sanctimonious behaviour as he had been by Fred and George’s constant whirlwind. Hal only made a semi-conscious decision as he leaned towards the younger Weasley to whisper.
She walked away, only to be replaced almost immediately by Dumbledore, who had probably been politely waiting for her to be done.
It was always tricky to keep it long enough to fully cover his scar, but not too long that it would look ridiculous.
“I don’t think aunt Andromeda and uncle Edward are expecting us much before dinner.” Draco said. “So we should have time.”
, as they consider it to be a beginner’s evasion. But guess what, you are beginners. If you can even manage this, it will be a feat.”
“What is it?” Hal prompted, kind and unworried, and Draco already hated himself for being the bearer of this shitty story.
Years of getting into trouble with Ley had taught Hal to be able to find the right arguments to make his aunt yield in a very short time.
“Actually-” Hal started, but Draco stomped on his foot. They were here to talk to Dumbledore, not to the Minister and his goose of an aide.
Tom showed Draco how after a girl was killed, the Headmaster (not Dumbledore yet, at the time) decided he had no other choice but to close the school, and Tom simply could not let it happen. And he was clever, and resourceful, and it didn’t take him too long to find the offender – not the Heir of Slytherin, and Draco felt Tom’s contempt at the mere idea that his culprit could have anything to do with this noble lineage, but a boy with a dangerous history of becoming besotted with lethal magical beasts.
But he looked down, and saw the phoenix’s red and golden head resting on his arm, and where the puncture wound had been… nothing but a round scar. A last couple of silver drops fell onto it, before the bird raised his head off to look at Hal – the silver drops where his tears.
Sirius had left the night before with a wink and a comment about how he ‘had his ways’ when Hal had asked him how he’d even gotten into the castle – because being able to turn into a dog could explain how he’d made it past the Dementors, both out of Azkaban and outside the castle, but now how he was able to slip inside completely unnoticed, especially on a Saturday. He was a rather large dog. They had agreed he would come back that evening and reveal himself to McGonagall and probably Dumbledore – they had no doubt she would want to involve the Headmaster. He was counting on the fact Hal would go through with the plan to secure Pettigrew before that happened.
The voice made him jump, and he looked up in a start. A few feet from him in the corridor leading back to the changing rooms, Flint was casually leaning against the wall. Tired, annoyed, entirely out of patience, and did he mention tired, Draco did not think, and he snapped.
“Hey.” Anthony responded, his voice tight, shuffling closer to Draco to wrap an arm around him. “You’re not alone.”
Desperate to change the subject, he started: “Your mom is…” He realised he had nothing to say about Draco’s mom, but it was too late to backtrack. “Nice.” He finished lamely.
Then again, he wouldn’t know where to start to survive a killing curse, defeat the evilest wizard of the century, beat a mountain troll, fight out someone possessed by the aforementioned dark wizard’s soul, or speak to snakes, but he’d done it anyway, so there was that.
There were a few snickers among the Slytherins, and a few discreet groans among the Gryffindors as they all fully expected points to be decked off from their house. However, Snape just looked at Hal as he was tidying his ingredients away, something like conflict flickering on his face, and in the end he only added:
“I fear it is not.” Dumbledore said seriously. “Our petrification cases are, unfortunately, very much real. There are not many sources of magic able to do this without an obvious counter-curse.”
“Those can be subconscious, Mister Parkinson.” Snape replied, undeterred. “But I am glad to see you are, in fact, as sure as you claim. Magic does not lie.”
She’s been here before, Draco suddenly realised, as one of the girls behind the bar giggled at something man-Pansy said.
“It fell right on top of James too.” Sirius recalled with one of his barks of a laugh. “It was in his ears, everywhere. He was washing the stuff off his hair for weeks.”
“Uh-uh.” She insisted. “Did you know that last year when your risked your life to catch the bad guy?”
He did give his Auntie a hug, and tried to pretend he didn’t feel a little tug of nervousness at the thought of not seeing them both again till Christmas.
He was eying his broomstick with some suspicion, but it was perfectly still and harmless now. He would have it checked, of course, but he’d read enough about Quidditch and broomsticks in the past few months to know that these rarely malfunctioned, and when they did, they tended to overheat and explode rather than try to throw their riders off.
Draco didn’t think of it in terms of hiding; if it became public, he’d admit to it. He knew one thing, however, and that was that he wasn’t ready to come out to his mother yet. He had to take the time to think about how to do it right. He was still worried about how it would make her feel, even if he was confident her outward reaction wouldn’t be bad – her open invitation to Pan for a place to stay told Draco as much.
, fifty years ago, unleashed a monster on schoolchildren and killed a girl. But it had happened. And Draco and Hal also had busted him with a freaking dragon. Not to mention “Fluffy”. And the attacks were happening again – what if Hagrid had another of his crazy pets wandering into the corridors at night? What if his idea of a fun teatime was to
Either way, Blaise did not have a father whose reputation in political circles depended on how his offspring behaved at school (his father, in fact, had died when Blaise was three years old of a bout of “bad health” that may or may not have been poisoning).
Maybe people like you, Hal thought. Then, immediately after: fuck it. He wasn’t going to stand for this.
“I don’t call her mom.” He carried on, feeling like he could tell Ron these things without being judged. “Because she’s not, I’m not going to rewrite that. But she raised me like she was. She raised us both as brothers. They’re my family, you know?”
They walked back the couple of carriage lengths to the compartment where Hermione and Ron were still sitting, discussing magical primary school, by the sounds of it.
Pan frowned seriously. It wasn’t that he didn’t appreciate the offer, but he didn’t want to be naive. It wasn’t Anthony’s decision to make.
Suddenly possessed by his inner Ronald Weasley, Draco changed tactics and punched him on the upper arm. He almost laughed out loud at the look of outrage on Hal’s face as he turned to him, mouth open, cradling his shoulder.
“What would a giant dog with three heads be used for?” Rolf repeated what Anthony had tried – and failed – to make sound like an innocuous question.
The few scattered groups around the Hall gathered up, and when he had people’s attention, the boy carried on in a voice that was only half steady.
? That would earn him a few death glares, from among those who were less reserved about which side of the war they had been on.
That sounded a lot more like a curse. So the real question here seemed to be: was someone trying to sabotage, injure or even kill him?
“Sadly.” Draco agreed. “I have absolutely no faith he’s not going to get into some sort of trouble again at some point.”
I be the Heir of Slytherin? I mean, I don’t know much about my family, but I thought they’d mostly gone to Gryffindor, and I’m in Gryffindor, and I know it doesn’t necessarily mean anything or I don’t know, but… I don’t know.” He repeated.
He set out to find at least one of them, Hermione preferably since he still felt the urge to check on her, so he decided to start with the library – Hal was at Quidditch practice, which was presumably where Ron and Anthony would be as well, cheering him on. Neville would probably be in the greenhouse – Sprout had asked for volunteers to help her monitor (and Draco suspected, guard) the mandrakes round the clock, and Nev had been more than happy to take a shift. So, left to her own devices, Draco would have placed a large bet on Hermione having headed for the library.
I decided Anthony had a sister because it felt weird that most characters are single children, and suddenly Ron has 6 siblings. I don’t know if it’s because JKR did not see the need to expand family trees, or that would have been too many characters, but just a mention wouldn’t have done any harm? Yet to my knowledge the wide majority or Harry’s generation, at least the ones that we get to know, don’t seem to have large families. I can understand why a lot of parents would be cautious during the first War and avoid having too many kids (apart from the Weasleys apparently), but surely for example for Pureblood families who are all about carrying on their precious lines, having more than one child would be the sensible thing to do? Guess a lot of them were too busy being Death Eaters. Anyhow! Anthony has a sister and I made her much younger so she won’t be coming to Hogwarts anytime soon.
Taking advantage of Seamus and Dean suddenly, and with excellent timing, starting an impromptu game of football – Dean had been very intense in trying to make the Muggle sport popular among his classmates – and the others’ attention being diverted for a moment, Draco turned to Pan to hiss between his teeth.
After a moment of not knowing what to say, Draco thought it was best not to make a big deal of the revelation by trying to comfort him. It would probably just make him feel worse. He couldn’t replace his cousin by suggesting to dress up with him, he couldn’t help him pretend Hogwarts was home, and he couldn’t make it any easier for him being days away from a date the wizarding world
He had a determined look on his face, mirrored on Ley’s. Draco felt a pang of something almost like jealousy, or longing, for that closeness between them, the purity of that unwavering support between brothers. He was glad Hal had that – part of him just wished he had it too.
“That thing is yours?” Hal asked, clearly shocked. He pinched the bridge of his nose, pushing up his glasses. “Again, in a
“Leave this poor child alone! Corrupter! Murderer!” She made a beckoning gesture with both hands, looking frantic. “Come here, pet, let me help you.”
Hal had a little pout, but he didn’t say anything else on the matter. Draco didn’t think he would ever really understand – their upbringing had been too vastly different for these things to make sense to Hal. For him to understand the pressure of being the last of your name, even though it was the case for him too.
As if answering his thought, there was a sudden commotion by the entrance of the Great Hall where they’d stayed back after dinner. It was still the place where they could most easily gather between Houses. The hubbub turned out to be Snape, wand raised and looking alarmed, pushing in a group of students. He gave them some sharp instructions before leaving again, closing the large doors behind him – which was unusual.
The next days passed in a bit of a haze, and before they knew it, it was the end of year feast. The Great Hall was in Slytherin colours, their House having come top of the ranking in spite of Gryffindor winning the Quidditch; but when Dumbledore got up (which everyone accepted with a repressed sigh, hoping the speech would be quick and the food on the table soon), instead of offering customary congratulations, he surprised everyone by saying:
He suddenly wanted to be sick. It had all been his fault, he had taken Hal down there. He had almost gotten him killed, it had been so, so close. If not for Dumbledore’s phoenix – whatever the hell it was doing there – he would be dead. They would both be dead. His mother helped him sit up as he dry-heaved, having nothing in his stomach.
She heard the rest of it, what he wasn’t saying. He wouldn’t have had his friends, either. He probably would have been sorted into Slytherin, so he likely wouldn’t have met Anthony in ways that mattered; and he certainly wouldn’t have been close to any Gryffindors, let alone Harry Potter himself, unless Lucius had seen some political advantage in securing an alliance (as he certainly would have put it) with the boy.
Once they got there, as each witness required to appear in court could only be accompanied by one supporter, it had been decided Narcissa would stay with the boys, and Petunia and Ley would go to the public gallery. Hal had tried to tell them, and all of their friends, that they didn’t have to sit through that, that they should be out enjoying Diagon Alley in the meantime, but they’d all insisted they wanted to be there.
Hal’s aunt came back with Madam Pomfrey, who cast a few spells over Draco to check his vitals. She only seemed half-satisfied.
“Quite.” The wandmaker said. “Yes, quite. How curious. Wand magic never ceases to amaze, Mister Potter. Never ceases. The wand chooses the wizard, did you know? There is so much we still do not understand about wands, they take a life of their own after they are made. How curious.”
“Nothing to worry about.” They caught the end of what the young witch was saying as they approached. “Oh, hello! Hogwarts?”
“Okay.” Hal lied the universal lie all kids lie when asked by their friend’s parents to call them by their first name.
3. I always thought it was awfully plot-convenient that Hermione had the paper about the Basilisk in her hand with “pipes” written on it when she gets petrified. I mean, 1) why would she rip out a page and write on it if she was on her way to meet her friends and tell them, and 2) I don’t think Hermione would go and damage a book like that! Anyway, I made them work for it a little bit more ;) Hermione might be the brightest witch of her generation, but she’s not the only smart one, and they’ve got Ravenclaws in their ranks!
“Oh.” Black looked down again sheepishly. “I, well, I wanted to find Peter and expose him, that is primarily why I escaped, but I had to check on you.”
He went on explaining they were less likely to be encountered in public places, though he had heard of Boggart interventions in train stations and even a Muggle night-club once, so he believed any person was as likely as the next of meeting one at some point in their life. After showing them the incantation and explaining the process of defeating the Boggart through laughter, they formed a line, ready to go one at a time.
Draco had never heard Hal sound so insincere, and though Nils certainly did not know him as well as Draco did, he still took the hint.
to get along with him. He was also hilarious, as the rest of the afternoon proved. He couldn’t get enough of anything, and was cracking joke after joke. Even if Draco hadn’t found them funny, the free and happy way in which Hal laughed would have been enough to be contagious. Draco had never seen this much energy in a person outside of the Weasley twins.
“Okay.” Anthony frowned, immediately catching on to Draco’s seriousness. “Well, the lads have been roped into having tea at Hagrid’s...”
As Quirrell stumbled, babbled and collapsed, the panic increased but was channelled at the same time as teachers instructed prefects to gather the students in their respective houses and take them back to their common rooms – bar the Slytherins, whose return to the dungeons was obviously ill-advised.
“Pan.” Anthony said as if that sealed it. “So, what brings you here with our Draco? Did your parents announce your engagement or something?”
It took a few seconds for Draco to put two and two together. A boy his age with dead parents and raised by Muggles. Enough of a well-known wizarding family that people would know his name. Hair that looked like a couple of small birds could comfortably nest in there. Very, very green eyes.
“Yeah, it wasn’t so long ago.” Ron said. “I mean, it ended when I was, like, one year old, but my parents still speak of it. Lest we forget, and all that.”
“Oh, that’s cool.” Hal smiled, pleased at the thought. “I’ll ask my aunt next time I call her. I’m sure she’ll let me come.”
“Okay, now it’s creepy.” Hal said, but he was still laughing, and Draco was irrationally pleased to see he felt better.
Hal could understand why this was Draco’s favourite place, because it was amazing. He had led them to the East wing, on the second floor, into at small library with floor-to-ceiling shelves full of beautifully bound books, and Hal had thought that was the place, it was cosy and homey and more
to resort to the fact James Potter had been a Quidditch player in his time at school to try and convince Hal of his own talent.
“Yeah, I ditched them.” She shrugged. “Greg has apparently decided to just be gross, and Daphne is being
He pushed past them, leaving them too surprised to retaliate – proving Hal right: bullying him, if whatever this had been could qualify as such, had been a spur of the moment thing, and not really something they were used to doing.
“Thanks?” Hal tried to sound grateful rather than highly suspicious, even if he wanted to shove the thing back at the teacher and say
Binns had told them a little more, reluctantly, about the legend of the Chamber of Secrets, when Hermione had brazenly asked. Rumours had then started spreading like wildfire, and everyone was whispering suggestions about who the Heir of Slytherin could be. Hal seemed to be a strong contender, on grounds obscure to him, to his mounting frustration.
The rest of them headed to the next room, as Ron open the door to… a giant chess set. They frowned and tried walking across, only to have their path barred by the tall pieces.
At first, Hal figured he’d only gotten away without detention thanks to Draco’s mediation. They had pointed out the Quidditch foul (and God, he hoped Colin had had the sense to stop for a minute in his “report Harry Potter’s every move” frenzy and hadn’t been taking photos of
After cake and candles, they did presents – Hal had bought George a prank quill that started writing nonsense if you left it unattended, and Fred a Lego set to build a spaceship. Bit of a risk, that one, but Ley had wanted to pick something with him (he also would have loved to come, but he’d been invited on the same day by one of his friends from school, and as Hal pointed out it wasn’t Ron who had invited him – because Ron would definitely have told him to bring him – he’d decided, maybe next time. It was weird, being apart, not going out to the same friends).
With reluctance and a lot of complaints Ron pretended he couldn’t hear, Hal let himself be dragged into his Quidditch kit and out into the cold, but once there were up in the air, he had to admit it had been a great idea, and he felt the tension of the past few days lift off his shoulders as they flew around, passing a ball back and forth between them.
seemed exoneration enough, it was unthinkable for a follower of the Dark Lord to imagine that a half-giant could be related to the great Slytherin.
, though he recovered quickly when Hal shoved a dozen of gold pieces in his hand with a grin and told him it was his to use.
“He’s just a baby.” Hagrid argued, and he looked like he had tears in his eyes. Maybe Hal had a point, not being afraid to give him sass.
“Hal…” Draco did not know how to act, what to say. “Don’t look him up.” He only advised with a hint of desperation.
Draco met his eyes, and they both cracked up, only laughing briefly as Hermione smacked the back of Hal’s head.
In the couple of hours that followed, Hal quickly reviewed his opinion about magic. Well, not entirely, a lot of it was still ridiculous, but it was
“In fact.” George turned to his brother, who was already nodding like they’d had the same idea. “We might need to speak to McGonagall.” Fred finished.
“I do.” He pleaded. “I didn’t mean it and I know… I know that’s not you, I’m so sorry that came out, I’ve…”
“No.” Hermione frowned, like she’d not realised they hadn’t actually figured that one out. “Myrtle.”
“I believe the mirror only responded to the enchantment it was placed under, to protect the stone.” The headmaster exposed. “A little twist on its original magic. It is a very special mirror, you know. It shows you what your heart most deeply desires.”
He wondered if Hal was still with Quirrell, and decided to head that way to see if he could find him. He had crossed most of the first floor without meeting him on the way, and was getting near the staircase to the second floor when he heard a shout.
At least this time they didn’t seem interested in throwing the contents of his bag onto the floor to trample it, which Draco was grateful for, because he has
“Because this is exactly where we ended up earlier.” Hal said. He pointed back to the entrance of the corridor. “I remember that suit of armour. The hands have six fingers.”
“Thank you, Sir.” The judge nodded. “I have one more question for the witness. Mister Potter, do you believe Gilderoy Lockhart to have premeditated his attack on yourself and Mister Malfoy?”
Quirinus Quirrell was faced with a decision. The Dark Lord was quiet. The Dark Lord only spoke to him when he had specific orders to give, or – Morgana forbid – some discontent to express. The Dark Lord would not want to be disturbed because Quirinus did not dare make a decision. The Dark Lord did not think the Potter boy was a threat, young as he still was – but He had not seen him. He had not heard him. The Potter boy was up to something. He knew about the Cerberus, he knew about the Stone, no doubt, and the rest of its protective measures, he was scheming, he was plotting, he was waiting to thwart Quirinus and the Dark Lord in their plans. Like Albus, like Severus, he was in the way.
Draco had wasted no time going back through the door with the broom as the others carried on forward. He found Neville still casting
“Hermione.” He snipped back. “Whatever is in there, Quirrell made sure Dumbledore was away before he went after it, so he’s not meant to have it.”
The happy task of managing the six of them had fallen onto Arthur Weasley, while his wife took the rest of Ron’s siblings (namely Ginny who had just gotten her letter) to get their things. As it was, the two groups ended up pretty much shopping together, in an unruly gaggle of excited children.
“I mean.” Draco sighed. “All pureblood children go to these things from age five or six, when they’re considered able to hold themselves. I have no excuse. I represent my family.”
“You boys definitely sound like you get up to about as much mischief as we used to.” Sirius grinned, sounding proud like he often did whenever it was about Hal misbehaving.
Hands down, Hal thought, as weird as his day had been so far, the wand shop was taking things to a whole new level. First of all,
“No.” Hal tried to sound convincing. “Thank you, Sir.” He added, hoping he appeared polite and not like a hypocrite, because he rather felt like saying
“Well, it worked.” Draco said kindly. “So thank you. And for coming after me, both of you. Saved my life, probably.”
A fleeting look of pain passed on his features before they hardened again, and he drawled on. “This being said. If you behave in my class like you have today, ever again, I will not stand for it, Potter, are we clear?”
He put a placating hand on Ley’s arm, who was eyeing Draco suspiciously, and they both stepped away from the tables.
The Tienmans and the rest of Hal and Ley’s friends are OCs, and they’re only there as background characters and for plot purposes.
“We must stay in this room until further notice.” He told the assembled audience. “Nobody is allowed to get out to the corridors. We stay in, keep the door shut, and stay quiet.”
“You know me.” Hal laughed. “Probably a bit too much. I’ve been very tame here, believe me. The shit we used to get up to with Ley…” He shook his head with a smile. “I’ll go next time, get him stuff for Christmas. Unless you wanted to be left alone?” He suddenly stopped in his stepped, looking worried.
It might have been a strategic mistake, though he didn’t think he’d have had much of an element of surprise either way. She grabbed him as he tried to push past, obviously, surprisingly strong. Next thing he knew, she was making shushing sounds as she pressed a damp cloth over his nose and mouth, and he slipped into darkness again.
“Cokeworth is not a very big place.” Draco pointed out. “And it’s not a magical village, so the chances that there was another wizard the same age called
“Let’s Polyjuice.” Pansy suggested after they had hanged together, fully bored, for half an hour. “My dad got me a supply.” She preened.
“She’s the girl who died fifty years ago.” Hermione spelt out. “Did you never wonder how she died? She’s in her Hogwarts uniform – as soon as Blaise mentioned a girl had died, really, I thought of her. It just didn’t really connect, I guess I didn’t want to stop to think about it if I’m honest, but it was in the back of my mind, and when I realised the monster was probably a snake, I thought someone would have seen it, Basilisks tend to grow big, but then I thought of pipes, it must be travelling through the pipes, which fit with the way Hal had been hearing it along the corridors, and well, where do pipes lead? Bathrooms or kitchens, don’t they. Then I thought, actually, isn’t it odd that of all the places in the castle, Moaning Myrtle has decided to haunt a toilet? Which led me to think, maybe, that’s because it’s where she died. Maybe she found herself in the way of the Basilisk exiting or coming back to the Chamber, or at least she might have known something. I was on my way to ask her, when, well.”
“You’ll probably see the guy again though, you realise that, right?” Ley pointed out. “I mean, unless you want to completely stop hanging out with Harry, but…”
“Currently in vault, 225,884 galleons, 53,456 sickles and 64,835 knuts – all added up, that is 281,559 galleons, 16 sickles and 20 knuts.”
They took their leave not long after that, and walked back in thoughtful silence, but upon re-entering the castle, Hal nudged Draco.
with Hal’s aunt like they were the best of friends. Like Narcissa Malfoy had never been of the opinion of her parents, sister and husband once, which was that Muggles were the scum of the earth and should at worst be ignored and despised, at best eradicated. He knew she had long moved past the hatred, but he thought the best he would ever be able to expect from her would be cold indifference towards Muggles.
The first two days of the Easter break went great, and Draco was comforted that everything would be alright. He spent time with some of his fellow Ravenclaws who were staying, whom he was friendly with even if he didn’t know them well, and he spent time with the Slytherin first year group – they didn’t seem to really mind either way, it was a bit like they were part of each other’s landscape, after years of being lumped together at the same parties and gatherings. They probably reasoned the same way he did: they’d be part of each other’s families at some point, in some combination or other, for those of them who weren’t already more or less distantly related.
He was wrong. He was so very, very wrong, and nothing could have prepared him for just how much worse things got in February. More specifically, by the end of the first week, when The Idiot – as they’d taken to referring to the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher – decided the student body needed cheering up, and what better way to do this than a bit of Valentine’s Day spirit.
Draco had been a little shaken at the sight of Harry’s scar. He hadn’t ever given it much thought – like Ron and every wizard alive, he’d heard the rumours too, but he hadn’t pictured it. He didn’t think he’d have imagined that if he had tried to. Harry – Hal – had called it ugly, and Draco wished he could say otherwise, but… no, it wasn’t pretty. It looked painful, even though Draco suspected a ten year-old scar wouldn’t be, and Harry hadn’t seemed bothered. Well, not by that anyway, because he clearly wasn’t a fan of its aspect.
“It’s so fancy.” Pansy commented, feigning as much disinterest as she could while her eyes were shining with amazement.
Draco turned to watching his year group as the Sorting Hat launched into what he thought was a truly awful song, and soon the first students were called forward. He wondered if the Hat was truly unbiased for each student, or if it also tried to spread out the new blood. What if nobody in the lot stood out as a Hufflepuff, for example, would there be no first years in that house? It wasn’t that many of them being sorted, it could very well happen. Yet in each year, there seemed to be a fairly even balance. Funny how that worked out.
With combined efforts, they both rather pathetically got to their feet, and Draco took in their surroundings, growing paler again. He looked positively ghostly by the time his eyes landed on Hal, and the blood covering him.
“I’ll get him a bigger cake to make up for it.” Petunia added with a smile. “Even though we’ll celebrate his birthday properly when you’re back, like we did last year.”
He made for the castle entrance, and spurred on by a barely perceptible jerk of his head, Vince and Greg scrambled to their feet and followed after him.
The name Remus rang a vague bell somewhere in the back of Hal’s head, but he got distracted from pursuing the thought as they all introduced themselves in turn. He could see in Lupin’s face that he indeed recognised the name Weasley, and Longbottom – and obviously Potter. There was something almost wistful in the way he looked at him, Neville and Ron.
“Yeah, I… No.” Pan admitted. “I mean, part of my brain knew you’re Half-Blood, but I never stopped to think about it.”
The figures in the mirror weren’t static, and the fascination he felt looking at them didn’t fade. The cousins on his dad’s side seemed to be trying to push each other out of the way to get a better look at him. Every now and again, his mom would ruffle his hair, and his dad would nudge his shoulder. He almost thought he could feel it, but he knew it was wishful thinking. Ley and his little sister – he started thinking of her as Violet, because it would have made sense for her to get a flower’s name – were playing with the kitten around Hal, who’d eventually sat down.
“Professor…” He addressed neither of them in particular, but Dumbledore looked over to him the most distinctively. “I’m not sure… Do you know what happened? I didn’t cast a shielding spell.”
Hagrid mumbled something unintelligible, and seeing the expectant look still on their faces, repeated it only slightly more understandably.
He pointed at the board, which Snape turned to as if he’d forgotten what was written there in his own handwriting.
. Draco had no use for brawn, he would rather spend his time with someone who was at least capable of a conversation slightly more ambitious than monosyllabic answers.
of them could stay, because visiting hours were over, but she had other patients to see to, and even in the magical world patients having sustained head trauma weren’t ideally to be left alone. Draco volunteered (insisted) to stay, and she told him not to wake him unless his breathing slowed down, or it’d been over two hours, and Draco had honestly no idea how long it’d been, how long he’d been sat there crying – another reason to feel guilty – so he was more that relieved when Hal woke up all on his own.
It went on like that for twenty minutes, the whole Gryffindor Quidditch team going for it, as well as Ron, and a few players from other houses, with Hal looking like he was trying to disappear into the bench, and most other students cheering like it was a boxing match.
Pan’s moody air disappeared as quickly as smoke in a strong wind, and she stared at her Professor, mouth hanging open, like he’d just given her – him? Did Draco need to start thinking of her as him? – the best gift he could ever have given.
Hal’s eyes snapped back up to his friend’s face. “Wait, they know about that too? I mean- I didn’t even-” He took a breath. “Do
“Oh, so do you apparently.” Anthony quipped before turning to her. “Second cousin. And yes, I mean, his name is Rolf
Their progression for the rest of their shopping was arduous. It was almost like the word had gotten out that Harry Potter was in Diagon Alley, because they were stopped by countless wizards and witches wanting to say hello and how much they admired him. Some of them were asking random questions as well, which Hal avoided answering in favour of getting away as quickly as humanly possible in that crown, and some of them were downright inappropriate, such as the one who told him he was so chuffed his parents had died – which had Neville actually tell the wizard to
Bitterness welled inside Draco. Hal did have a choice. His cousin wasn’t going to die, he could have come to school. Didn’t he want to see Draco again? Even if his cousin was like a brother to him. He’d told Draco he’d be his brother.
“This is very advanced magic and it was made by teenagers.” George carried on. “We accepted that there might be a few errors.”
“No, I mean, we can talk about this later if you want.” Draco shook his arm, pointing across the grounds. “But I think Hagrid’s hut is on fire.”
To his friend’s credit, he didn’t stop to question his sanity, and followed right after him as Draco ran out of the room, leaving Tom’s diary on his bed.
“This mirror shows your deepest desires.” Quirrell conveniently explained. “I see myself giving my master the stone, I see him in glory, rewarding me for my service…” He lost himself for a moment, looking dazedly at the pane, then seemed to remember Hal was there. “What do you see?” He pressed.
Hal figured he still was going to get killed, at least not right away if they “needed him to get the stone”, whatever that meant, but he could very well be made to be in a lot of pain, he was sure there was a wizard equivalent of the classic bullet in the kneecap you saw in films, so he took a cautious step forward. Slowly. His best plan was still time-wasting.
“I can compromise by holding Mister Hagrid in the cells within the Ministry. We shall see if there are any further attacks – which I dearly hope there won’t be – before deciding on our next course of action. But Albus, you should know…”
.” Hal’s hoodie turned a burgundy red that wasn’t quite a statement either, but would appease Anthony. “It’s temporary.” He assured Hal, who looked crestfallen for a moment.
He’d never particularly liked Christmas, he didn’t really see what the fuss was about at the best of times, but having been away at school, and realising he’d had more fun in these past few months than he’d had in years at home, he expected it to be an especially miserable one. He had never stopped to think about it, but with a new point of comparison, he was able to look back now and know he’d had a really dull life up to this point.
It wasn’t long before the chimney flamed green, and Hal guessed they were getting him through the Floo (he did vaguely remember Hermione saying something about Apparition being impossible within Hogwarts wards). The blood drained from his face as he turned, and saw Gilderoy Lockhart step out of the fire with a flourish.
Draco supposed he did. He remembered seeing the Potters’ pictures from news records. Harry was looking at him with a little frown that Draco had seen a lot before: that was the face of someone wanting to figure out if you were trying to make a fool out of them, or get one over them. Ronald Weasley had once told Draco that was because he talked like he was better than everyone else – but Draco really couldn’t help it if he’d been raised to have perfect elocution, could he – and because that was exactly what Lucius always used to do. That one had stung.
Hal set out to opening his presents, still bouncing up and down, though his movements became more measured as he actually handled each wrapped gift, in case there was anything breakable inside the parcels.
Her mouth dropped open, but she didn’t seem to be able to come up with another barb, and Draco was alarmed to see that her eyes started to shine.
Hal could tell his aunt was fruitlessly trying to remind them that the Malfoys were about to arrive to pick him up as the house descended into chaos, Ley creating a huge mess in the kitchen trying to find supplies to take care of the cat.
He should have taken Blaise’s advice, and do it just before the start of term. Blaise’s mother was always hosting parties and, according to Blaise, having
“I know how you feel.” He said after a short silence. “Not the… weird, archaic family values, obviously, but people who think they can tell you how to think and behave. I keep being told my parents were Gryffindors, like I should be glad and relieved to have ended up in the same house. What difference does it make? They’re still…”
“Ha, I know what to do with the likes of you.” He told the unconscious beast. “Go.” He nodded towards the door. “I’ll distract it if it wakes up.”
“Thanks.” Draco finally looked up to meet his eyes, and gave him a faint smile. Emboldened, or maybe just wanting to shift the attention from him, he asked: “What about you?”
Hal couldn’t exactly say what happened next, he only knew that he saw Draco’s pale face go even paler than normal, he heard Anthony scream, and he thought
But it achieved the intended effect, which was to make everyone laugh. When Pan spoke again, however, it was with dead seriousness.
“Well, no.” He did sound amused. “But my family is well-known. People might warn you about me, actually, the Malfoy name tends to be associated with dark magic. Mostly though, I think people are just weird around wealth and influence. We are a Noble and Most Ancient house.” Hal assumed that was something important. “They said my father could have been Minister of Magic.”
Draco remained silent for long enough – at least it seemed long to Hal’s fuzzy brain – that he had to open his eyes again to check his friend was still there. He was, frowning slightly.
Hal gritted his teeth, forced himself to look amenable (after Lockhart told him to smile for the second time – he managed it by giving some attention to Sil rather than to the ridiculous adults surrounding him) and only politely cleared his throat when he noticed the clock was pointing to five minutes to nine.
“It’s a magical scar, left by a curse nobody else ever survived.” She pointed out. “There is literally no precedent to document the after-effects this could have in the long term, and-”
“Darling.” She said softly, taking his hand and giving it a little squeeze. “He’s safe. You both are. You did so well.”
and lacking well, magic, in the Muggle world. But Hermione just shook her head and assured him it was perfect, and not everything needed fireworks. She’d seen her cousins, as well as her friends from primary school, and she’d had a great time.
Anthony and Pan exchanged a look – that wasn’t quite true, they weren’t exactly the best example of how the Houses treated each other, but it was probably best not to get into that. Over lunch, Pan got to learn a lot more about the Goldsteins. They were lovely people, for one, unquestioningly welcoming even though Anthony hadn’t repeated to them what had brought Pan to their door. There had been Muggles in their family across the generations, and while it was rare among Wizards to practice religion, that was one of the reasons the Jewish traditions had been passed on, as well as the habit of going to the Synagogue. That was where Anthony’s father had met his mother.
Ley actually successfully kept him in a good mood all their way to London, and Hal himself was more excited about seeing their friends than he was nervous about what would come next, by the time they got to the Leaky Cauldron. They went through, Hal’s aunt still looking as wary as the first time, and Ley as pumped up, having agreed to meet in front of the
The classroom was disused and dusty, most desks pushed against the walls, and at the far end was a tall frame. As Hal got closer, removing the cloak and bundling up in his arms as we walked up to it, he realised it was a mirror. He’d thought it was a painting, because he could see several figures in it, but he could now definitely recognise his own reflection, moving as he did.
“What? No.” Hal interrupted, giving her a stubborn look. “I am not going to school without seeing Ley.” He asserted.
, so Pan couldn’t make good on his threat to go tell Hal himself. He was good for his word that way. Usually.
It left Anthony, who had actually held Pan back when they’d gotten off the train in June, and had slipped him a piece of parchment with his Floo coordinates. He hadn’t said anything, but Pan had seen his serious look, before he’d said something goofy or other to Ron. He hadn’t meant as a light ‘write to me’.
Hal had resigned himself to spending the afternoon in the dorm playing with Sil, after a first year had started crying at the sight of him in the common room, until Ron cuffed him over the head and told him to stop moping.
The shop itself was fine, it looked like a second-hand bookshop, just as dark and dusty, only with the shelves stacked with boxes instead of books. No, what was unsettling was the wandmaker himself. Hal had gathered that the wizarding world was a fairly small one, and had come to terms with meeting people who had known his parents – his Auntie really hadn’t liked that, though. But Ollivander, whom Hal guessed he must be, going by the name of the shop, greeted him like he’d seen him coming in a crystal ball or something.
“Makes sense.” Hermione nodded, looking back down at her parchment. “I wouldn’t want to read the same thing over and over again either. Might as well change it up across Houses.”
The news about Black and Pettigrew had spread through the school like wildfire. Blaise swore he hadn’t told anyone much too vehemently to leave any doubt that he was the source of the ‘leak’, but they didn’t hold it against him – it’d be in the papers soon enough anyway. Draco had written to his mother immediately, thinking it’d be nice for her to hear it from him first rather than from the
Hal laughed, Draco joining in as they both looked at the wings in their hands. Draco had heard of Snitches coming apart when the end of a game had become a little heated, but that was usually because the loosing Seeker had let anger get the best of him and try to rip it off their opponent’s hand. He didn’t think something like that had ever happened – though in professional Quidditch, the referee probably wouldn’t have awarded the points to both teams. They had much more advanced monitoring spells there to review the play by play and work out which of the Seekers had touched it first, even it it was by a fraction of a second.
It was also an extremely weird sensation, feeling your limbs grow and your chest expand, feeling your features change. Draco didn’t think he liked that very much. Before long, they were six adults looking at each other with various expressions of mirth and confusion.
The conversation was interrupted as Snape returned with McGonagall, who took Hal back to Gryffindor Tower. She walked in determined silence on the way up, but kept him in front of the Fat Lady’s portrait for what felt like ages to lecture him at length when they got there; and she did deck twenty points from Gryffindor (ten for punching another student, ten for jinxing another student) and gave him a night’s detention, details to follow.
“There are potions.” Severus confirmed carefully. “It’s a commitment. You’d have to start taking them, well, pretty soon, the ideal start for the therapy is at the time of…”
Hermione had an answer to that, which she provided as they were walking back to the castle, in hushed voices only loud enough so all six of them huddled up together could hear.
Underneath the acceptance letter addressed to him and the list of school supplies were a number of pages that, Hal guessed, were sent as standard to children who did not live among wizards.
“I love it.” Hal countered, beaming at Draco, who looked down with a tinge of a blush, unless Hal was imagining it in the way the firelight played on his pale skin.
He pressed the heels of both palms against his eyes, only to resist the urge to start clawing at his scar, as if Voldemort’s next manifestation would come from there. It was as likely as anything, at this point. It had flared when he’d destroyed the diary, and maybe it had gone slightly unnoticed in the grand scheme of things, but it had felt sensitive since. Raw. Not painful exactly, but in a way that made it hard to just forget about it. Hal wanted it off his face, though he knew that wasn’t going to happen.
“It was deceiving.” Draco argued. “And it’s only okay because it turns out he’s the good guy, isn’t it? If he really had been after you, he could have approached you and harmed you ridiculously easily, you realise that?”
But she trusted her mother when she said that her sister’s will to change seemed genuine. The fact that her husband had been dead almost seven years probably did a lot to reinforce that confidence. Lucius would certainly have been the worse influence in Narcissa’s life, once their parents had died and their basket-case of a third sister had been incarcerated. Without him, it sure looked like it had taken her some time to get out of that mentality, but at least she was getting there. The fact they were visiting with a Muggle family in tow, for one, that Narcissa was
“I believe.” McGonagall commented next. “You have all been incredibly lucky. But for your quick thinking in finding a way to call for assistance, Mister Malfoy, I will award fifteen points to Ravenclaw. For protecting your friends, Mister Potter, fifteen points to Gryffindor. And for your reckless bravery, Mister Goldstein, another fifteen points to Ravenclaw. Now, please go back to your common rooms. Quickly now, off you go.”
Draco shrugged. “I’m not really that close with Pansy and the others, you know, not being a Slytherin and all that.”
Draco winced at how they pronounced his name, and he sent a look to Hal (still keeping his head down) and Ley (who had also fallen silent). Ley gave Hal a sideways glance.
When Draco started to wander, bored out of his mind, after greeting whoever needed to be greeted alongside his mother like a well brought-up wizard, it took him only a few minutes to realise he’d made a critical mistake in walking away from other people. He was walking through another garishly decorated room when he happened upon a group of teenagers drinking firewhisky, sprawled on the – no doubt expensive – armchairs like they owned the place.
“Oh. Er. I’m good, sir, thank you.” He cleared his throat, embarrassed and unsure how to interact with the man outside of a Potions classroom. “Did you have a good holiday?” He hazarded.
The next morning, they had gathered enough people for a four-a-side game – one in each position. Fred and George remained as Beaters, and the rest was decided a little haphazardly – Ron and Lee Jordan ended up as Keepers, Draco and Harry as Seekers, and Anthony and a third year Hufflepuff called Rosie who may or may not have been Lee’s girlfriend (the introductions had been a bit jumbled at best) as Chasers.
It was true, Hal had gotten into the habit of keeping the Invisibility Cloak on him at all times, thinking that if he ever heard the Basilisk, he wouldn’t miss that chance to follow it just because he couldn’t be seen running after it without getting in trouble. The solution was just to not be seen. However, that did not mean Draco’s sudden request made any more sense. Something seemed off with him.
Draco had had a lovely time, his words, with his mother, going around the Manor and spelling each room a different winter decoration style, while the house elves left treats and little gifts everywhere for them to discover. It had been days of magical winter wonderland, and finally a time to reconnect, without the pressures of social events – not this year, Narcissa had decided, and she’d even declined the invitation to the Christmas ball, held at the Goyles – and without the stress Draco had been under these past few months. He’d left the diary in his dorm room at Hogwarts, and he’d felt so much better for it, granting some credibility to his friends’ assessment that Tom’s confidence hadn’t been all that good for him.
“Hey, I was thinking.” Anthony leaned in towards them, clearly not interested in the Slytherin’s showdown either. “Your godfather told you they were really close, right, him and your dad, and Pettigrew, and Professor Lupin.”
He hadn’t intended to sound sarcastic, but it somehow came out just that level of dryness, and Black barked something like a joyless laugh.
A small arrangement they had made, so that Hal wouldn’t miss his cousin’s birthday for the sake of a few days of school term. Ley had been unsure about postponing the actual celebration, arguing that it wasn’t the same if it wasn’t on the day, until it had been agreed he’d get two cakes out of it. He was happy with that. Hal still didn’t feel good for almost making him miss out on that one, too.
Ron’s footsteps hurried back to the front room, and Hal only came two steps down the stairs when he heard Mrs Weasley’s voice again and reflexively stopped to listen.
“Are you nervous about the judgement?” Hal asked him, going back to the other matter tied into Sirius’ announcement.
“Draco.” She continued. “Since this happened, you… well no offence, but you’ve been sticking to him like a mama duck to her duckling, like you’re afraid something terrible will happen to him if you let him out of your sight.”
“Small budget.” He’d instructed. “Those of you with big fortunes, don’t be dickheads about it, because the rest of us won’t be gifting above our means.”
“He’s obsessed with Muggle tech.” Ron told him when Hal could get away without being rude. “Sometimes it’s fun – like he’d got this old car and we’re trying to make it fly!” His excited beaming died down. “But mostly it’s just annoying.”
He briefly glanced over to the other side of the room where Lockhart was gesticulating to the older students, most of them looking dismayed, and everyone heard the unspoken addition of
“My friend Emily from back home is studying the Greek mythology at school, and I was curious to see what the links were between the creatures in the myths and real fantastic beasts. I love your grandfather’s book, by the way. But anyway, she has to pick a creature and do a presentation on it, not only about Greek myths but also including any presence of that creature or a similar one in other lore, and I told her Em, you’ve got to pick Cerberus – because I remembered reading something about three-headed dogs in a book here and I thought, Oh that’s interesting! You know for example I did not find any evidence that hydras or gorgons are a thing, though maybe they were and they’re extinct, but Cerberus dogs are still around and I thought well
“Oh, hi. What are you both doing here? What’s wrong?” Draco frowned, eventually noticing the look on their faces.
Hal glared at him, which was entirely inefficient. They made their way out of the common room – where the two younger boys had greeted him (making Hal wonder if they had been waiting there for an hour or so to make sure they wouldn’t miss him) like he was the rising sun himself – to head out to the Divination classroom, up its own tower.
Blaise was a bit more of a free spirit, on account on his family not being an old House – in fact, his family history seemed a bit hazy. They had come to Britain a few generations ago from the United States, another a few generations after immigrating there from Italy… something like that anyway.
“There you are! You missed the whole game, it’s over already, Hal caught the Snitch in under fifteen minutes! It’s not a record in professional Quidditch, but I think it may be in Hogwarts history. Even Anthony can’t manage to be mad at him for losing us the Cup.”
There had been some occurrences, as children, before Hal knew what it was all about, where random people had started at him or congratulated him in the street, but they had always dismissed those, thinking they were either mental or were confusing him for someone else. Hal could tell Ley was remembering those instances now.
It was Sirius’ turn to gape, and Hal explained how he’d recently acquired it from the Weasley twins.
“I don’t do that.” Hal still denied it, grumbling defensively. “It’s brought us a bit closer, is all.”
After the feast – it wasn’t nearly as big as the start of year one, but still slightly more outrageous than then normal term-time dinners – they gathered in the Gryffindor common room to exchange presents. This year, they had decided on a Secret Santa, after Hermione and Hal had thoroughly explained the concept to the rest of them.
“Yeah, run to mommy.” The boy spat meaninglessly, rubbing his elbow where it had banged against the solid frame.
Blaise had been off on a self-appointed mission to find out more about the Chamber of Secrets, by way of getting gossip from his mother, who’d get it from her numerous relations in the Wizarding world.
“Yeah, yeah.” Hal waved a hand dismissively. “You’ve already told me about my mom and dad’s amazing OWL and NEWT results in first year. I’m trying not to fail them monumentally, alright?”
For a second, the man seemed just as shocked as Hal was, but the next, Hal’s sharp intake of breath stuck in his throat as a spell hit him.
Draco and Hermione both frowned at him, because, who was Edmund? But they decided not to ask. It was often better not to ask, with Anthony.
“I kicked his legs, he kicked me back.” He brought a hand to his shoulder to indicate where. “My head hit the wall, or, like, the sink, so I thought that was it, but that’s when Professor Snape arrived and stopped him.”
The realisation that had filled Hal in the waiting room earlier only seemed to his aunt as she tucked him into bed and started saying they’d see Ley tomorrow.
“So I’m going to ask politely.” He carried on. “But a friend of mine gave me another example of how to deal with bullies like you or your brother, if you prefer a different approach?”
“It’s weird and gross, don’t get me wrong.” Ron had added. “But nothing ever happened, you know? He was just a rat. I don’t see the need to start freaking out about it.”
As she made her statement, Hal spotted movement from the corner of his eye, like someone had been hiding behind the corner of the cloister they were sat in – it was a beautiful day, and everyone had eventually decided Hal and Draco had it right wanting to be outside, and had given up studying – and was suddenly scurrying away. He only caught sight of a flap of purple cloak, which told him without much room for doubt who it had been.
. “I think the DAMSELS can Apparate him to Hogsmead, or he could Floo… I’m sure McGonagall will know. Surely it’s not the first time a student has had a family emergency.”
Well, no, he knew. He had taken it personally after Quirrell had pushed him down the stairs and he’d gone after him in anger. But he realised it had been reckless, and he could have gotten someone (besides himself) seriously hurt, and he wasn’t going to do that again, especially after what had just happened to Hermione.
Ron had apparently appointed himself Hal’s breakfast coach on match days, and was lining up everything he thought he should be eating for maximum energy and flying performance, without weighing him down, while Had shook his head at him, amused. He complied and drank his kiwi juice, ate his brown toast with egg and beans, but Ron couldn’t stop him from snatching a few bites of blueberry pancake to top it up.
Hal gave him a tentative smile, and a little nod. Then he let out a big sigh, like a weight had just been lifted off his shoulders, and took out his wand.
“I plan to try out for the team. As Seeker.” Draco specified. “So we might end up fighting one another for the cup.”
Narcissa thanked the Elf and instructed her to call for Draco too before going down to greet Sirius, who had been shown into the entrance hall. He was looking around with a mixture of curiosity and distaste, surely prepared to dislike the place on principle. However, Narcissa could tell he had made an effort at appearing presentable; his hair was neatly trimmed around his face, the face itself fuller than it had been in the previous months and his clothes quite obviously more expensive than she had seen him wear on any of the news reports. In fact, he cut a rather dashing picture. A proper Black heir, as much as he would have hated that – but some things became ingrained in spite of yourself.
Hal opened his arms before he even reached for his glasses, and she immediately cradled him in hers. He stayed like this for a long time, breathing her in, waiting to no longer be overwhelmed by the feeling of being so young, and so little, and simply wanting his mom. When he was quite confident he wasn’t going to cry, he moved back. As he put his glasses on, he noticed an absolute mountain of cards and treats on the bedside table, and frowned.
“I’d rather not be a child soldier in a war that either ended a decade ago or hasn’t started yet.” He admitted. “But I see what you’re saying.”
He finally broke down into a sob, and impulsively, Hal lounged forward and pulled him into a hug, holding him as if they would float away, or dissolve, without each other to anchor themselves to the stone.
They exchanged looks, realising just how much they had already stuck with each other for, in just two years. They were all in it together – all of it. Hermione gave Pan, and all of them, a smile.
“Like ending up in Ravenclaw wasn’t enough.” Another piped up. “Some Malfoy you are. Your father would be ashamed of you, he would.”
When they got to the Head of House’s office, and found Draco and Neville sitting there – Draco looking paler than a ghost, and Neville quietly crying – they all reached the same conclusion.
“Care of Magical Creatures and Arithmancy.” Draco said when Hal asked him, without the shadow of a doubt.
His gaze skipped to Draco, only fleetingly, but in that moment Draco had the clear impression his godfather just
, there was a rumble of thunder, followed about five seconds later by a sudden downpour. Pan ran to a nearby oak tree, sheltering under the wide branches.
They were not particularly standing out either – lots of students were gathered in groups of mixed houses so they could be with their friends, Hufflepuff games tended to be the friendliest in terms of the crowds even if the team gave it as good as they got. On top of that, they were sitting right behind the Patil twins, identical except for the colours they were wearing, who could have been the poster girls for inter-house unity.
“If this is something you want, then you are looking at perfect timing.” He commended. “But the potions need to be taken every week for at least five years, throughout puberty, for a smooth and safe transition.”
“He was pretty out of it.” Draco said with a smile, recalling how fuzzy Hal had been. It had been endearing, really. “But he’ll be alright, nothing a potion can’t fix, once it’s brewed.”
“Oh, Mister Potter!” He beamed when Hal crept into the classroom. “Perfect, I was just about to demonstrate how I conquered against the Man-Eating Pygmy Sorcerer! Join me!”
Lily had only been back for Christmas for two years, and Easter only the first one. From third year, she had remained at Hogwarts over the holidays, with her like-minded friends, and had been off visiting magical communities most of her summers. She had always been an independent one, had Lily. Petunia could see that trait in Harry too, and had no doubt he would grow up fast once he was off to that school, and that Surrey would very soon be much too small a world for him.
“Sorry.” Draco said, holding the squirming animal back. “I didn’t want to interrupt. He was crying.” He added, scratching Sil’s neck, then turned to Hal’s aunt. “Hello, Mrs Dursley.”
Hal shrugged, thinking he could pretend they hadn’t crossed paths and he didn’t know if it had been him at all, and pointed his chin at the dog instead. “I made a friend.”
Draco didn’t say anything else, he just gave the man the pointed look of utter disapproving nonchalance he’d learnt from his mother. It had worked on tougher characters, and eventually Severus sighed.
“I wish I could.” Hal sighed. “But doing magic outside of school is forbidden until you’re seventeen.”
He seemed to consider something for a minute, then sighed, and beckoned Hal’s friends, still hovering by the doorway, to join them.
“She haunts a cubicle in the girl’s bathroom.” Hermione explained (“Glamorous.” Ron commented, which she ignored). “And she is… well, there’s a reason why she got that nickname. It is extremely uncomfortable when she starts crying.”
He knew his father would probably have disapproved, because it evidently wasn’t a subject that led you to the Ministry. But eight years old was also when he’d realised, with all due respect to his memory, that he didn’t care any more what his father would have thought. He wanted to do what he liked.
Hal understood what he meant, between the lines. It was a drawing. A fantasy, which he was allowed to have. It didn’t make him ungrateful for the life he had.
Reverse vampires? He thought, looking behind him nervously, for any hint of creatures that were invisible, but had a reflection in mirrors, rather than the other way round. Not that he knew if that particular cliché was true (because yes, apparently, vampires did exist). He shook his head to ward off the silly thoughts. It didn’t really matter right now.
“Knacks like... music?” Hal tried (and probably failed) to sound like the example had just occurred to him.
They were both humouring him, as they had done countless time when he’d been younger. But this wasn’t a childish joke.
“He had a few choice words about my father.” Pan reported. “And he says to say thanks, you know, for not letting me be homeless.”
“How is my little Dudleykin, how is he?” Marge was already cooing as she barged past Petunia, bulldog on her heels, and made her way through the house to the door leading to the back garden.
Both boys were looking at her like she had grown an extra head. She had always tried to encourage their imagination, but she was a very down-to-earth woman, and she could see that it seemed very out of character for her to be talking about magic like this. She would have been worried if they had taken this in stride with no amount of surprise, actually.
He didn’t sleep for long, startled awake by a door banging loudly somewhere nearby maybe twenty minutes later. He’d dreamt of his family – his parents, both alive, his little sister just like he’d seen her in the mirror, except at one point she became his big sister, and then he realised she looked exactly like McGonagall and they found out she was their long-lost aunt. And then Draco was there, for no reason, telling him he should go to the shops.
Snape left the room, and Hal started to rethink his relief that he hadn’t gotten detention. McGonagall might still decide otherwise. But as he sat there, he realised he didn’t care. He’d do it all over again if he had a choice. He looked sideways at Draco.
was the Heir – he was an actual Slytherin, which made more sense, and his family was one of those voicing the Pureblood ideology rather strongly; Marcus himself had never been short of a racist comment or other.
Hal looked at Anthony, the two of them clearly remembering the first time they’d come face to face with the Cerberus and not all that eager to repeat the experience.
“Don’t rise to it, darling.” She told him. “You know he’s only acting like this because he’s frustrated you can’t show him.”
from Pan – he was already through the flames before Hal could react – and gave Draco a hug) before making his way to his godfather, who now had a slightly pondering look on his face.
“Well, knowing didn’t help.” Hermione sighed. “Still got myself petrified. Hal was the one who saved the day, so it’s fair.”
Hal wasn’t sure if he should speak to Draco. Pretending nothing had been disclosed seemed wrong, like he didn’t care, which was far from the truth – but at the same time, he couldn’t just casually start mentioning his sexuality and say… what? That he was cool with it, and that he was wondering if he was the same? He didn’t want to make it about himself.
“Well.” Rolf said cautiously. “Cerberus dogs are known to make good guard dogs, on account of, you know, three heads. They’re not always that vicious but they’re a good deterrent. And some breeds grow very big, so they’re quite closely regulated.”
Draco tuned out to the rest, white noise filling his ears. It hadn’t been about the Snitch. It might not even have been about winning the game. Flint had targeted Hal not in his capacity as Seeker, but because he was Draco’s friend, and Draco had rebuffed him. It was all Draco’s fault.
“Yes.” Hal said wryly. “Because I consciously told myself – you know what, I will wait until Potions to doze off. Nothing to do with the fact that it’s the last class of the day and I’ve been running on about three hours’ sleep.”
It was Draco who answered. “A Patronus charm.” He said. Everyone turned to him and a faint blush crept up his cheeks. “I’ve seen my mother use one. They are the best defence against Dementors, but they are also used to carry messages.”
“Not the same?” Draco cut him off, still in a chilling tone. But he saw the flash of regret and affection in Severus’ eyes, and he softened. “How many times have you told me I’m nothing like my father?”
He was pulled out of his thoughts as Fred and George came hopping towards them, as the last dishes on the long tables vanished.
“Honestly, she’s a mate.” Hal insisted. “She just find it more difficult to make friends with other girls.” With a grin of his own, he added. “Although, Draco and I are pretty sure Ron’s developing a crush on her.”
After two days of steady, heavy rain – they had baked, played games, read books and watched TV, and it had been equally lovely – they finally woke up to glorious sunshine.
Before Anthony could get a word out – the implied expectation from the other boys being that it would be his responsibility to lie to his cousin, since they’d decided together not to tell anyone else about the dog – Hermione started chattering.
known Parselmouth in history was Salazar Slytherin. That is why the snake is the symbol of his House.”
I obviously completely invented the process and legalities around transitioning in the magical world to suit my plot. Hope it doesn't cause anyone offense and is close enough to the conflicts real people have to deal with.
They all looked at each other in shocked silence for a minute, before Rolf suggested they speak to a teacher.
“Alright, in my defence, I was in the hospital for half the holidays, and my nan did everything in her power to keep me lying down or sat down for the rest of it, so this is the best I could do.”
He made a few of those comments to Hermione instead, who was sitting next to him, but when she gave him a stern look after he made a ghost joke (he’d only pointed out that
“Now, I know of this example as it is both a recent and a famous one.” The man added, weirdly running a hand through his (rather thin) hair, clearly satisfied at finding it still sleek and slicked back. “However, this ledger does not have details of what exactly it is the Goblins are crediting your ancestors for, Mister Potter. Goblin memory is powerful indeed, and they are very particular about disclosing information to anyone who isn’t blood. You could ask them directly, if you wanted.”
“Dudley, language.” Petunia said reflexively, with no real conviction. She was looking at the list over Harry’s shoulder with no small amount of concern. “Where will we find all these things?”
Draco wasn’t sure he would be able to sleep, or eat for that matter, but he was willing to give it a try, if only for his mother’s sake.
Hal, meanwhile, had another idea. He saw how pale Draco had gotten as he fully realised that his godfather was currently roaming the corridors for a werewolf, and as much as the man wasn’t Hal's favourite person, as much as he risked getting one of his most prized possessions confiscated...
The last Quidditch game of the season would determine the cup winner, and it was not doing Oliver Wood’s anxiety disorder (as diagnosed by the Weasley twins) any favours. If Gryffindor won, they would get the cup. If they lost, Ravenclaw would. If they tied – Slytherin would, which was simply unacceptable. Hal had made the mistake of suggesting it wouldn’t be the end of the world, and they all had gotten a twenty-minute lecture that boiled down to Yes, it would be the end of the world, because Oliver would kill them all.
. They were – according to their friend Lee – the biggest pranksters the school had ever seen. To that the twins were emphatically modest, made shady references to someone called the Marauders, and cracked more jokes than Hal would have thought possible in a single minute. Ley would have loved them. Ron, Hal could tell, what trying his very best to pretend to be exasperated. He could actually understand how the boy felt, he’d seen it happen in friends who felt excluded by his and Ley’s closeness, their inside jokes. It couldn’t have been easy to be the sixth brother in the family
So yes, as much as he hated to admit it, Severus Snape was worried about the current wellbeing of Harry Potter. It had been unclear how Quirrell was in contact with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, but if Albus’ theory (one he had formulated as the year went by and they observed the man) was correct, Harry could very well be facing the Dark Lord himself, by way of the Defence teacher.
“Ah, Harry.” The old man said cheerfully, like there weren’t remaining flames and a pile of ash where his pet had just been.
She had aimed to raise both boys as her own. It had simply been easier, after Vernon’s death and without his constant and vocal scorn of Harry, to have one set of rules and plans for both toddlers. And she had noticed that Ley, growing up sharing with his cousin, had quickly become less fussy and entitled than in the first few years of his life. Now almost eleven years old, the two boys were thick as thieves, and brothers in all but parentage.
and had plonked him in a bed telling him he’d have to wait because she was all out of Pepper-Up potion. Hal thought whatever that was didn’t sound very serious, but he assumed it would sort him out quicker than paracetamol when he finally got it, because all the care he received in the meantime was a glass of water and a stern command to stay under the covers.
McGonagall’s remained speechless for a few moments, blinking helplessly, before she gathered herself.
Another step back brought Draco’s back to the wall, and there was nowhere else to go. And he had grown a bit over the summer, sure, but the other boy was still six years his senior and a foot and a half taller. And he was still moving forward.
It would have been incredibly easy, and while he didn’t condone stealing in any circumstances, and didn’t think he’d ever find himself in a situation where he had the urge to do it, he wasn’t sure if four overexcited teenagers sneaking around in the night in the basement of the best sweets shop in the vicinity could really be expected not to.
“It means.” Pan explained quietly. “I was born in this girl’s body. But I’m a boy. And instead of trying to change my core to fit the body, I’ve decided to change the body to fit the core.”
“Don’t interrupt me, birdie. What was interesting, is the reason why you’re in there. So your family is one of the richest in Britain, hey?”
“You know what...” Hal didn’t hear all of what Mrs Weasley was saying, her voice barely more than a whisper now.
Or, apparently, Hal would shove him suddenly and with surprising force into the nearest pinball machine. Petunia rushed forward and held him back before his raised fist made contact with the boy’s face.
“Ley and I always dress up together and make a crazy night of it. It’s going to be weird not doing anything with him this year.”
Casting the strongest feather-light and shrinking charms he could manage on the luggage, knowing he would likely no longer be in a Permission circle for underage magic by the time they needed renewing, Pan fitted everything in a single shoulder bag, and left without looking back.
The door on the other side as opened, and Hal, Anthony and Hermione headed for it. Well, Hal and Anthony headed for it, and Hal grabbed Hermione’s wrist to pull her along. He didn’t know what else was waiting for them, but he knew she was their best chance of knowing what to do. She didn’t seem to mind, whoever was drawing more reassurance from the contact.
He knew he wasn't terrible, but he wasn’t at Hal’s level. Flying seemed to come so easily to him. Not that it came hard to Draco, but he’d
Hal was quietly explaining to Ley how it worked and how weird it felt, when the fire roared green, indicating Andromeda had connected the line. Draco felt himself stand a little straighter, just as he noticed his mother doing the same.
“Except the Heir of Slytherin, apparently.” Hal pointed out. “He seems confident enough to graffiti it on the wall and all.”
“I suppose there is an easy way to check if his allegations regarding the rat are correct.” McGonagall said.
Because he wasn’t an idiot, and he could admit that it hadn’t been particularly sensible to start pouring his every thought into an artefact of unknown origin and dubious reliability. He’d known that from the beginning. He’d just gotten caught up in it.
Hal could tell the old man was just waiting for a question from him to go on rambling again, so he carefully did not ask what was so curious.
When Hal saw the clock go over midnight, and realised it was the first of September, he knew he wouldn’t be in King’s Cross by 11 o’clock. He’d miss the train. He had no idea how else he could get to Hogwarts – there was the Floo that Petunia had taken to visit him a few months back, but it had been disconnected since. He didn’t have a Portkey. He didn’t even have an owl to contact the school and ask what to do.
He wondered if he should broach the subject, and ask her how she’d feel if he had a boyfriend instead, but he didn’t really want to do that on the phone. And he thought he probably needed a little more time to think about it himself, to really understand what he felt like, what he wanted. Talking to Draco hadn’t really helped, if he was honest, it probably had made him even less sure than he’d been before.
“They don’t even think he’s actually coming this way.” Hal added – this to reassure Ron, who had gone a little grey since hearing the news.
He’d already asserted that cats did not see through the cloak, though Little John Silver seemed to know where the person wearing it was, probably through smell or a sense of their warmth. Walking around the castle at night, Hal was able to confirm that paintings couldn’t see him, nor ghosts (and discovered on the same occasion that at night, Professor Binns apparently taught History to other ghosts – several of which kept interrupting that they had been there, and it wasn’t at all how it had happened).
“Because… because!” Draco said eloquently. “We’re friends. We’re friends in a large group of friends. He doesn’t feel the same way, and it will be incredibly uncomfortable and ruin everything. No.”
“You’re brave and you stand up for what is right.” She told him. “You protect your friends. That’s worth a little bit of trouble.”
Hal was startled for a moment, as the implication crept in on him. He’d never asked himself (or Neville for that matter) how and why he’d been raised by his grandmother – he’d just accepted it as a fact about his classmate, never really questioning it. But now that he thought about it, it would mean that his parents were out of the picture, one way or another.
. Everything was very loud and flashy for a moment and the next thing he knew, he was glancing up from where he and Draco were huddled against the wall, the troll was on the floor, Anthony was looking bewildered some distance away, his wand pointed at it, and several Hogwarts teachers were standing nearby staring at the mess – Snape in front, looking like he had just fired the decisive spell that had felled the beast.
When Neville came to sit down next to Hal, he didn’t say anything for a long moment. Ron and Hermione had tried talking to him and had eventually given up, and little by little the common room had emptied, until Hal was alone in front of the fire – only for ten minutes or so, before Nev came and took the other spot on the sofa. Eventually, it was Hal who spoke.
“Draco, you can stay with your friend.” She said when they were in the hall. “I have business with the vault manager. You have enough money?”
Draco looked briefly over his shoulder, as if to check it still looked the same. His mother and Hal’s hand where exchanging a brief hug and starting to chat already. Draco had never thought of the house as impressive, having grown up here, but he supposed it was quite grand.
“We’ve come this far.” Ron interrupted Hal. “What would be the point in turning back now? You’re right, Hal. Whatever Quirrell is after, whatever he’s up to, it can’t be good if he’d go as far as trying to kill an eleven year-old boy.”
. Hal just nodded, figuring the headmaster (as was usual) knew a lot more than he was letting on, and probably wasn’t going to start sharing secrets and theories with him anyway.
He made them swap around after a while, citing the need to face people they were not familiar with so they would be less likely to anticipate their next move. Hal found himself paired up with Justin Finch-Fletchley from Hufflepuff, who seemed unhappy with the outcome. Hal guess he was part of the ones that thought he may somehow be responsible for unleashing an unidentified monster into the school.
“I… No.” Hal answered after a moment’s hesitation. “I should stay. There’s my friends. Classes. Exams.” He added unconvincingly.
“I’ve known I like boys since I was five.” Draco confessed. “Maybe not so consciously, but… I told my father I wanted to marry Felix Rosier when I was older and I got a belting for it.”
Draco said he’d come, and Hermione pretended she would join only so that someone could keep an eye on them and make sure they didn’t get into trouble, but Hal could tell she was almost thrumming with excitement at the idea of speaking to ghosts, which were only second to books in terms of sources of knowledge – and only because there were no intricacies about getting the knowledge from a book, as opposed to ghosts who Hal presumed, some of them, might quite tetchy about being asked about their past life. This being said, some magical books had a mind of their own too, and Hal did know of some that would only let you read them if you asked nicely.
“I’m not eating anything from you.” Hal spat out – both the words and the porridge, when she tried to push the spoon past his clenched lips.
. Surely your Headmaster cannot believe this man to have actually tried to harm you, or anyone, in any way, and still let him carry on.”
.” The nest of snakes disappeared and Snape sliced through the crowd, and glared viciously at Hal. “What do you think you’re doing, Potter?”
“No, I’m sorry.” He said, forcing some patience into his voice. “Do you need something? I need to get to class.”
“Not a social call, I’m afraid.” He replied in the same overly polite fashion. They had both been raised with the same manners after all, and some of those were hard to shake.
He watched Harry make for the door with a little regret; he’d have liked to talk more. He may not be as famous as Harry Potter, but it was rare to meet someone who did not know the Malfoy name and hadn’t already made up his mind about him, his dead father, his aloof mother, and which branches of his extended family were the good or the bad ones.
They stopped at a service station for lunch, where they had sub-par sandwiches, compensated by ice-cream, and Petunia let Hal and Ley play in the small arcade for a bit (she had given them each a small allowance, and Hal had changed some of his wizard money for pounds as well, and after controlling it wasn’t a stupid amount, she had agree they could use it as they saw fit over the holiday) while she watched over them from the side of the room, enjoying her coffee.
Too late, Draco remembered why he hadn’t revealed this the first time around, and the whole other reason why We Do Not Talk About Sirius Black and realised that he shouldn’t, really shouldn’t have mentioned him at all. There was no way for him to backpedal when Hal asked:
“I’m okay.” Hal repeated, turning to Draco with a smile. “Sore.” He patted himself down. “Just sore. I think my magic acted up again, like that time with the troll? I do feel like I hit the ground, but not…” He gestured vaguely at the daunting staircase. “Like that.”
Hal was glad they were playing the Hufflepuff, so he could focus on the game without having to worry about hurting Anthony’s and Draco’s feelings. Training had been tough for the past few weeks – while the days were getting longer and the grounds were starting to show signs of spring, it was still bitterly cold.
She looked down at the last beetle Hal had transfigured taking a little spin before it reverted back to its mineral state, and then at Hal thoughtfully. Draco didn’t think they had done anything wrong, it was pretty harmless magic though transfiguration always came with a warning, but Hal did that innocent smile and wide eyes thing that fooled exactly no one but still made people go soft, and in the end she shook her head.
Daphne and Pansy had already sauntered off towards the train, Vincent at their heels, but Gregory was hanging back, looking tentatively at Draco, so Draco made an effort to push down his instinct (which would have been to find a quiet carriage for himself and spend most of the journey reading) and walked up to him.
“Magic is real.” She said firmly. “There is a community of people with the ability to use it – from what I understand, it is a small minority, and they prefer not to make themselves known to the rest of the world.”
“Ah, yes.” The headmaster smiled. “It seemed you reacted instinctively in the face of danger, and produced a non-verbal, wandless protection charm. It is akin to the accidental magic that occurs in young children. This tends to fade out when wizards receive their wands, but it is known to happen until puberty under intense emotion, such as you have just experienced, and more rarely after that.”
