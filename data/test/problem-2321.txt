After that, they went their separate ways. It wasn't until he sat down that Harry realized Ron hadn't mentioned his birthday. He'd never forgotten before... Maybe it had just slipped his mind. Ron

Mrs. Zabini squealed happily. “Oh! My first grandbaby! How exciting! Tell me everything!”
in the middle of a case right then, and Hermione was preggers. She was probably driving him up a wall with cravings and mood swings and stuff. It was a small reason as to why he was gay; it was a very small reason, but still a factor.
“Come now, I couldn’t write what was on there and ruin the surprise now could I? Just wait a moment. I want you to appreciate this. It took me forever and a day to get everything together. And I had to ask Granger for help, Granger!”
“What?!” four voices shouted. The sudden noise made McKay start to cry. Harry, surprised at his own answer, took a second to respond to his child. He finally shushed him by magicking a bottle and giving it to the hungry and surprised little boy. Draco decided to continue from his earlier outburst in the mean time. “What do you mean you’ve slept with Blaise?! You just said a second ago that you’ve only slept with one person and that was me and that’s all you’d ever want or need. And now you’re saying you’ve slept with Blaise?!” He turned to face Blaise. “I thought you said you hadn’t had sex with him!”
But Voldemort was smarter now, and knew what Harry was up to. He resisted. As he resisted, he caused more pain in Snape. Then he started attacking Harry, using the magic link to Snape and the mind link to himself to harm the young Gryffindor.
Harry sniffled. “Thank-you for saying that.”
When he got to work, a few people greeted him as usual. He was in his Auror robes, and he took the elevator to the correct floor. A few more people greeted him as he made his way to his office. It had taken him a while to reach the level he was at, and he had done it without his fame. It was a hard road, but damned if he didn't have an office (not a corner office with a view, it was more like a broom closet really) with his name on the door. He was co-leader of his squad, meaning if they broke into two teams, he was in charge of one of them. Or if their head leader was out of commission for whatever reason, he took over.
“Calm?! I
“Yes, Father. Harry and I are wed. We combined our names: Potter-Malfoy. It wasn’t that long ago. We have also made plans to have a more ceremonial renewing of vows at a later date. Surely you can understand why the secrecy was needed? We could not allow anyone to know, especially the Dark Lord. We were not sure as to what your allegiances were, truly, at the time. Even now, we do not want to let anyone know of Harry’s true powers. He is so powerful, Father.”
Harry asked tentatively.
“Lucius!” Dumbledore urged, drawing the man’s attention to him. “I must ask you some questions now. Severus–”
“That is going to happen regardless, Mr. Malfoy,” Snape said with a smirk. “However, I will see when the other professors are free. Any certain day?”
“No, you stand over there by Harry’s head. That way you’re out of my way but still close enough for him to see you. I want both of you to do exactly as I tell you to exactly when I tell you to. Kipper!” The small house elf appeared. “I am going to need lots of warm water and towels. Do you think you could get that for me and place them on the table I’ll have set up by the time you get back?”
“You are Harry Zabini by name.”
“Who doesn’t know your middle name?” the witch countered.
“Theresa Rhodes, you say?” Dr. Morris asked. “Wow. It’s an honour to meet you, really. I studied all of your work extensively when I tried to get into the field myself. However, I didn’t pass the bar high enough. I wasn’t given the ability to be a labour and delivery specialist, just a regular check-up doctor or a helping hand should one be needed. Sorry. You were saying?”
“Draco, Draco calm down,” Snape soothed. He pulled his godson up into his arms for a hug, but kept his eyes on Harry in case the Gryffindor took offence to him hugging the blonde. Besides a frown and a tightening of his fists, Harry made no complaint. “It’s okay, he wouldn’t do that. He wanted me to get you out. Now you are, you don’t have to worry about any of that, not now not ever. We will protect you. Me and Dumbledore and the other professors and… and Harry.”
“They said I was the bottom!”
Narcissa gave a polite laugh. “He’s right, Harry. Draco was born with a light smattering of dark hair. By the end of June, it had lightened to a blonde color. Over the next couple of months, it turned white blonde. Think nothing of the baby’s coloring right this moment. Corvus Armand, you say? Lovely name. I thank you for honoring the Black House with your choice.” She bowed her head to the young man.
Harry silently chuckled, imagining his father fainting as he was born so suddenly. He was kind of glad Draco was laboring more slowly. It was obviously painful for the other man, but Harry would get to savor the experience. A camera was shoved under his nose.
“It means you’re hungry Harry,” Blaise joked.
We went and jumped off the deep end,
“The calendar!” he exclaimed and rushed downstairs. In the small kitchen they usually ate in when they were by themselves, Harry and Draco had created a calendar system that worked for the two of them. It was basically a muggle calendar that ran on magic, but was also created by magic. He called up the day and noticed that nothing was charted for that day. No dates, no appointments, no outings... no birthdays. He enlarged the calendar to show the whole week, in case it was a longer appointment being called into question.
He knew Harry was staring at him, because his gaze almost pierced through his shoulder. After several minutes of this, he was about to turn around and ask what the Gryffindor’s problem was when two arms wrapped around him and hauled him back into Harry’s arms. He’d squawked and carried on for a moment, sure. But Harry had kissed his cheek, just below his ear, and said goodnight, and cuddled up against him. It had been weird, sleeping that close to someone, but it had been so perfect! The heat in all the right places, the security, the inner warmth. And every night since they cuddled, whether there had been anything sexual between them or not.
“I think that's enough details, Love.”
“Ssseverusss! Why have I not been informed of Potter and Malfoy’sss abcensssesss from Hogwartsss when you are right there to keep an eye on thingsss for me? Isss that not your posssition asss my ssspy?”
Albus merely smiled. “Have you tried asking them?”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
He didn’t even notice Snape entering the living room. The older man knew better than to say or do anything, however. To make any noise would cause Harry to strike out. Instead, he merely watched the youth – no, a man now. Seventeen years old, married, a child on the way, Head of two Houses. This was a man by all accounts. And a powerful one at that. He needed to talk to Albus soon about their plans. Probably because he was searching for Potter (Potter-Malfoy) himself, the Dark Lord didn’t hold his annual end-of-year attack. There was no Potter (Potter-Malfoy) to attack, after all.
With a sigh and a nod, Poppy began her work. It was going to take a while. The list of injuries was so long. And that was only for Draco. She was really worried about Harry; he was the one more likely to be in danger and trouble. He also seemed to be very protective of Draco. Understandable. She wished she knew what had happened to the two boys before her. She shook her head then, and got down to work. Draco’s malnutrition and dehydration were so bad, she’d have to start an intravenous drip to get him and the baby steady. Luckily she’d taken a Muggle medical course or two before she could become a qualified Medi-Witch at the school.
Only Dumbledore was there at the time, configuring two squishy chairs and a comfy couch on either side of a roaring fire. Despite it being summer, Draco got cold easily. Harry helped his husband onto the couch in the spot nearest the fire. Draco may get cold, but Harry was plenty warm. Severus had decided to stand behind and slightly to the left of Harry during the interview.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“Yes, dear,” Narcissa said. “We understood that signing just fine. No translation needed.” She paused for a moment to smirk and then think. “What if we conjured a divan for Draco and Harry to sit on and chairs and couches for everyone else? It’s more intimate, and it won’t make Draco feel left out.”
Harry had been livid. You don’t hurt women and children. You don’t go after the vulnerable. Severus and Lucius had betrayed Voldemort – fine, go after them. They were capable of standing up for themselves. Narcissa? Draco? They weren’t a part of this war. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t right. There were rules to war! When he found out the true extent of Narcissa’s injuries, he nearly went off to find Voldemort right then and there. It took Lucius and Severus to hold him back physically.
They decided their first interview would be an overall story about the obvious: the history between the pair, the detention, the issues they struggled with, the pregnancy, and their marriage. They’d found a way to strategically mention the pregnancy and the marriage at about the same time during the interview so it wouldn’t be obvious Draco had been knocked up prior to their wedding. It was just gauche to admit such a thing.
Harry and Draco took to parenthood like dragons to the air. Corvus was such a sweet baby. Oh, his lungs worked plenty well. On the whole, however, he was calm and easy. Narcissa was jealous; Molly was proud. It was hard for Draco to put the boy down or hand him over to anyone else. He’d carried that child within him and felt the need to have him close by at all times. Even Harry wasn’t immune from these fits of need. The dirtiest of diapers, the rounds of spit up, the worst colic – it didn’t seem to faze Draco one bit.
“Fine. Stay. I don’t care. Headmaster, where is Severus?”
did happen. However, Dumbledore is not dead. The events of
“Think about it, Harry. Is this the ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’? And even if it’s not, you’re still damned powerful enough now to really give him what for. The next time you meet, you’ll wallop him good for sure!”
“I’ll go floo my parents and ask if we may keep the house,” Blaise said quietly. He left the room and made his way to the front room where he tossed a pinch of floo powder into the fire and then waited. “Hello mother,” he said when he saw her face appear. “We’re fine, before you ask. And before you ask when we’re coming home, that’s what I’m calling about. Harry and I were wondering if we may stay here, permanently. We’ve become rather attached to the château, and we already have a live-in medi-witch, one of the finest in Europe.”
“Okay,” Harry said slowly. “Why do you want this job?”
“Yes!” Harry sat up quickly with wide eyes, one hand lying protectively over his stomach. “Yes, please Blaise.”
” Snape roared from the living room.
A blank look crossed Blaise’s face. “And let the cravings begin.” He walked out of the room to begin the dinner Harry had requested while Harry fell asleep. His dreams were plagued with Draco leaving him over and over again in many different scenarios and for different reasons. He didn’t know it, but he tossed and turned something fierce. When Blaise came in two hours later to wake him, he saw Harry sweating profusely, kicking his legs out, twitching his arms, and whimpering. When he went to wake him up, Harry jumped away from him and landed on the floor beside the bed with a
Condicio viscera – condition bowels – checking the status of Corvus’ bowels and intestines
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Draco sighed. “I’m not understanding. Here, use this.” He conjured then handed a quill and piece of parchment to his lover. The sign language they used only went so far, and only to the necessary conversations. Whatever Harry was trying to say hadn’t previously been necessary, apparently.
“Now that’s not fair. You know he’s just worried about me and wants to make sure I’m okay. He doesn’t understand how close we are now. Five months can do a lot to a person. He’ll understand that eventually. He’s my godfather, Harry! You know as well as I do that if Sirius was alive he’d be doing the same thing. I know you two have a history-”
“Mr. Malfoy!”
After all the names had been read, and all the students had their diplomas, Dumbledore stood to say, “I am sorry to announce that one Mr. Draco Malfoy could not attend today’s festivities. His diploma has been owled to his home and we wish him luck and success in life. Congratulations Class of 1998!” While all the other graduated students cheered, hugged their friends, kissed their boyfriends or girlfriends, Harry sat in his chair with a completely white face. Blaise quickly made his way to the Gryffindor and pulled him into a hug.
All you need to know is that I’m an awesome authoress and that this is an awesome fic that you want to read and WILL NOT flame at the end. Also, you want to leave a review. I know you do. And so do you. Because I just told you that you do. Yeah. On with the fic now…
Harry quickly made his way over to Blaise and buried his head in his shoulder once he was there. “I’m so sorry Blaise. It doesn’t matter what condition I’m in, that was uncalled for. I know you only care for my safety and well-being, it’s just so hard sometimes. I’m sorry. You’ve done so much to help me and I just keep throwing it back in your face. I really do appreciate everything Blaise, you know that right? I’ll stay inside, I promise. I won’t go out anymore unless you’re with me. I’m so sorry to keep worrying you.” He stepped back a little to reveal a tear-strained face.
“He incinerated all five of them, then put one hand on my forehead and the other on one of the wounds on my back. And healed it. Then did the same thing for the other four. It had to of been sometime in the afternoon. Harry decided we should rest there for the night and find something to eat. He always found the food, always. And I let him after the first night there. I ate something that nearly killed me. Nothing he’s ever found has killed us, hurt us, or made us sick in any way. He was always within talking distance though, never left too far away. Otherwise he’d take me with him. I usually went with him anyways.
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
But this didn’t seem to bother Draco at all. He may have been down for the count, but he was also nesting.
“So you want me to get Draco to go along with this plan. That’s what this is about.” Snape sighed in surrender. “And just what am I supposed to say that you haven’t already?”
being calm! This is ridiculous! Was this your doing, Malfoy?” She turned back to Draco. “Did you have a hand in keeping Harry from us for another month longer? He’s missed most of his last year at school, he’s missed Christmas, he’s missed so much! And it’s all your fault!”
But, as he walked toward his office, no one mentioned his birthday. He saw co-workers he barely knew, and co-workers he went into the field with on a weekly basis. He saw people he liked, and people he didn't like. He even saw Shaklebolt and Tonks, who he'd worked with in the Order. They greeted him, had a quick chat about unimportant things, and then went on their way. That was when he saw Ron.
“It was all Mal- Draco's idea, mate,” Ron said, hugging his friend in a “manly”, one-armed hug. “He wanted to do something that would make you remember this birthday. You remember your eleventh birthday because you found out you were a wizard and had your first real gifts. You remember your seventeenth birthday because you were legally allowed to use magic outside of school whenever you wanted. You'll remember your twenty-first birthday because no one else remembered it, supposedly.” Ron gave a grin as he explained things.
“That doesss not matter to me! Why isss Malfoy absssent from Hogwartsss?! Luciusss! What isss the meaning of thisss?!”
“That sounds like a plan to me. But, until then… Can you do that thing with your tongue again?” he asked, hopeful. So near their due date, Harry was nearly adamant about no penetrative sexual activities. But, honestly, it was Draco’s body and he was horny, damn it!
“Only if we’re not all killed first,” Snape growled under his breath. “He’s likely to kill us all if he wakes and…” he cleared his throat, “is not there beside him. I have a feeling I will be left the task of explaining?”
Harry jumped slightly and turned. “Dra- Blaise? What are you doing here? Have you seen Draco?”
Harry tore into the gift without so much as a thank-you. He held up a CD a few moments later. “What’s on it? It looks like a blank disk.” Harry looked at him in confusion.
“How many?”
“I do. Which do you like Blaise? Despite what you keep saying, you’ll have to deal with them as well.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Dr. Morris looked over at the notepad. “Yep. Okay. Short story, once more. Draco and Harry were in a relationship and Harry ended up pregnant. Draco misunderstood some things, and Blaise married Harry to keep him from embarrassment from having a child out of wedlock. McKay, the child, was born and Harry became depressed. Blaise treated him to Jamaica where they found the long-lost Draco. Now they have come to terms and wish to part. Blaise and Harry that is. Draco wants to marry Harry and for McKay to take his name.”
“No, but I want it in the Great Hall. Please?!” he begged when he saw Snape was about to refuse. “We can do it later at night when all the other students are supposed to be in bed, and the doors can be warded and locked and silenced. And it won’t take long at all. But I want to decorate a table, and have a small feast. And we’re so tired of being locked up in these rooms. It’s just not fair! We’re better now medically, and I understand why we have to stay here, but it’s my wedding. Please, Sev, please? As soon as we’re done eating, we’ll come back. We’ll use Harry’s cloak even!”
“Would you mind singing that last one again?
Harry smirked at Snape and casually walked away to do just as Draco had suggested. Then, they christened the bed. Without silencing charms. And with lots of noise from Draco to make up for Harry’s lack of noise. Snape wanted to die.
we didn't forget!” She was angry alright, but she was also enjoying the little prank they'd pulled on her friend.
(I’ll watch you leave here limping).
“No.”
“Mr. Potter-Malfoy. We combined named when we married,” Draco answered. He took another sip of water. “That will come in due time. Shortly, in fact. Our detention was in the Forbidden Forest, as I said. As seventh years, along with Hagrid, we were surely able to find some hippogriffs. Instead, Harry and I were separated from Hagrid. Instead of staying on the path as instructed,
“For Harry’s sake? Since when have you ever given a damn about Harry?”
Snape grumbled then left for his office. He could grade the Hufflepuff/Gryffindor third year essays before dinner if he started right now…
“Father, do not use that despicable word,” Draco instructed. Five months alone with Harry had taught him many things, one of which was about the Muggle world in general. Hermione was a gifted witch, no matter her lineage. “Harry might explain things to you at a later date, but I will not. I have nothing to say to you or the Weasley outside my door. I want to keep it that way. For Harry’s sake, I will be civil. That is all I can manage at this time.”
Aw, Harry is so protective of Draco! What did ya think? Leave a review please!
“There would be a live orchestra for the music, an outdoor pavilion perhaps. It all depends on the time and weather. And the child of course. I don’t want to be pregnant when we have our second wedding. We will be married before It comes of course, but for the second wedding I don’t want to be the size of a Quidditch Pitch in my robes.” He paused for a moment. “What do you want Harry? Don’t you have any ideas or wants in this wedding business?”
Harry placed a hand on the top of his stomach. “I’ll begin doing that immediately. Is there anything else I should know about my first pregnancy?”
“I, Harry James Potter, in the name of the spirit of Merlin that resides within us all, by the life that courses within my blood and the love that resides within my heart, take thee, Draco Lucius Malfoy, to my hand, my heart, and my spirit, to be my chosen one. To desire thee and be desired by thee, to possess thee, and be possessed by thee, without sin or shame, for naught can exist in the purity of my love for thee. I promise to love thee wholly and completely without restraint, in sickness and in health, in plenty and in poverty, in life and beyond, where we shall meet, remember, and love again. I shall not seek to change thee in any way. I shall respect thee, thy beliefs, thy people, and thy ways as I respect myself.”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
Over the next month or so, Harry began to trust his environment more and more. He allowed Draco to wander around the rooms they were living in with Snape on his own, as long as he didn’t leave them. He allowed Snape, Pomfrey, McGonagall, and Dumbledore to give Draco foods and potions without testing them first. Occasionally he would, just to be sure, but it wasn’t every time like it had been at first. He began sleeping at night with Draco, truly sleeping. When Snape or Pomfrey would run tests on Draco, he didn’t fight them like he did at first.
“Go to hell Blaise!” Harry shouted back.
“Ooh, an ice lolly, grape, with some whipped cream and hot sauce, please!” came the excited reply.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Father?” Draco said, not meaning to but glad he did at the same time.
“Would you look at that,” Draco said as he got Harry to calm down. “Have you been talking about me to our son Harry?” Harry burst into a fresh wave of tears. “What did I do now?”
We’re so close! So close to the baby and so close to the end of the story. What do you think about the baby names? Did I insult anyone by laughing at your name? I can tell you the origins of my names if that helps. My first name is the name of a character on a popular American soap opera that my mum used to watch. My middle name is a changed-spelling of my bio-dad’s first grade girlfriend’s name. Yeah. And then there’s my Hawai’ian name from my step-dad, and that’s
“Harry, why did you marry Blaise?”
“How in blazes did you come across a nundu?!” Madam Pomfrey shrieked, trying (but failing) to keep the volume down.
Lucius Malfoy was now and truly fucked. He hadn’t prepared for this happening, hadn’t thought of the repercussions of his actions, hadn’t thought it would get back to the Dark Lord. But he should have know that it would! Potter and his son lost in the Forbidden Forest? Of course Dumbledore would come up with some kind of excuse. It had been six months since they’d had that detention. It was March now. The snow would begin to melt in its entirety so the search could begin in earnest. He wouldn’t spare a single knut to find his son. It would-

“By being trusted implicitly.”
He snapped back to the present with a flinch, reaching his magic out to get information from what was around him. He hadn’t spaced out from his surroundings since before The Detention. Around him was nothing, really. He and Draco were sitting in their bedroom; they had been talking about the baby and the pregnancy when Harry tuned out and started thinking about the previous night. That brought them back to Draco staring at him with a confused expression.
“Potter-Malfoy,” Draco said with a sniffle. “We are Harry and Draco Potter-Malfoy.”
Snape sneered at the man. Luna giggled. “I bet you two came across some Moon Frogs,” she said, smiling. Harry was just grateful she didn’t write that down in her notes.

During one of his fits, Harry shut him up with a hard kiss. Draco was seated on a bench in front of a vanity, so Harry leaned down and took command of his husband’s lips. Immediately, Draco surrendered and opened his mouth. Their tongues met and glided over one another. Harry’s hands cupped Draco’s cheeks, forcing the blonde to tilt his head slightly for better access. Then he started to trail kisses across his husband’s cheek to his earlobe, behind his ear, down his neck. He left a rather large love bite at the nape of Draco’s neck.
..l. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“That’s how he sneaks around at night,” Severus muttered under his breath.
“Yeah,” Blaise agreed. “In fact, you asked me that other time, just after we were married as well. When you were still extremely upset over Draco and the wedding. Holy shite! I’m glad we’re getting this cleared up here and now. To have anyone else ask if we’d slept together and us answer yes would have meant an immediate no on the application for annulment.”
“It’s not against my morals,” Severus said with glee, pulling his wand from the arm of his robe.
“Right. Professor Snape. Mr. Potter-Malfoy said there was a picture, and that we were permitted to take one as well. May we still do that?” Dimitri asked, holding his briefcase. His shrunken camera was inside.
He paused for a few moments to drink some water. Harry took a sip as well, keeping his eyes moving from person to person in the room and a hand on Draco at all times. “So, a week into our ordeal and I’m without a wand. I threw a fit, let me tell you. We tried to see if we could piece it together somehow, but it was dead and gone. Harry finally pulled me away and we continued on. By the end of the day, he was so sick of my whining. He gave me his wand. I know a wizard’s wand is made for him and him alone, but others can sometimes use another’s wand. And it was so with Harry’s wand. It was almost too easy for me to use it.
“Is he okay in there? Does he need anything? Has he had meals? What about McKay? Does he see Theresa?”
As Draco’s eyes drooped, Harry carefully bundled Corvus into his arms. A quick thought had the boy bundled up in a swaddle of a light green color with little hippogriffs dancing around the edges and a matching hat. He made sure Draco was successfully settled into a nap before moving to the rocking chair he’d conjured next to Draco’s bedside. Then he simply sat and rocked with his son for more than an hour.
“Oh, of course,” was the sarcastic response. “My aide. Because I am so helpless.”
“Of course, of course. Why do you want this job?”
“Why didn't you go after him, Potter? You rarely let him out of your sight.”
“I didn’t!” Blaise said back, eyes wide. “I swear by Merlin’s name we’ve never been together like that. I was never interested in Harry in that manner. Yeah, he looks good, but I’m not gay Draco.” Everyone was silent then. “Hey, I’m not gay,” Blaise said as if just coming to the realization himself.
“Right, yes. Getting ahead of the story, but I guess you should know,” Draco mused. “Harry is mute. He cannot speak. He can hear. To communicate, we created a sort of gesture-based language. He was correcting me when I said ‘we’ insulted the hippogriffs instead of ‘I’. There are no, er, blubbery… what’s-its.”
“I’ll get her.” Blaise stood and went in search of Theresa while his mother and Harry continued talking. When they returned, they were included in the talk. It was some three hours later that Mrs. Zabini left for her home in England. And it was Harry’s stomach which told Blaise it was time for dinner. The three made their way to the kitchen and began to fix and eat dinner together.
“Who am I?” he asked after a few seconds of silence.
“And that’s all for now,” Snape interrupted. “That is enough time for Mr. Potter-Malfoy to be sitting up like this. He needs his rest, after all.” Clearly, the interview was over. Snape began ushering the reporters to the door.
“I knew it!” Blaise whispered. “I knew you’d been acting funny! Are you sure? For how long? How far along are you? Are you okay? Is there anything I can do? Should you be standing up? Do you-?”
“I don’t–” He turned toward Harry and watched as he signed something to him. “Don’t wear the mask? Don’t shut out my emotions? Don’t be what I’ve been taught to be since birth? Then what am I supposed to be, Father?” Draco was angry now, lashing out as his world was turned upside down. “What should I be, hmm? A catamite for your Lord and Master? A convenient fucktoy? Is that what you would have me be?!”
happen. Got it? Okay then. On with the fic.
Harry nodded as if to agree.
“Of course I did! Otherwise I wouldn’t have known how to sing like them,” Draco snapped.
“So the nundu finally went off, but she’d already torn into Harry a bit. I tried to get down to him after she left, but the wards wouldn’t let me. He just lay there on the ground…” Draco trailed off, his eyes glazed over in memory and with unshed tears. He had been terrified that day. A hand on his thigh startled him from his thoughts. “Oh! Sorry. I guess I… got caught up in the memory. He was just laying there, bleeding and coughing, his eyes glazed over and fuzzy. He wasn’t moving after a while. I could see him breathing occasionally, but he wasn’t moving otherwise.
Harry cut him off with a long, hard kiss. After a few moments, he pulled away and began signing. Draco was still crying, but he seemed to be calming down some. Harry continued signing for a long time, trying to comfort his lover. Pomfrey packed up her belongings and left the room without either of them noticing because they were so wrapped up in one another. When Harry was done signing, he bent down and wiped the tears from Draco’s face before kissing him. He signed a few more things and Draco’s face lit up. He smiled big and started bouncing lightly in his seat. Snape looked on, confused. Then, Draco threw himself at Harry to give him a big hug.
“Oh yes, yes he did. I think it’s a lovely name, and I would love for his middle name to be of his father’s. You do talk to the baby, don’t you Harry? Ah, well you must start right away. Talk to McKay as if you were already holding him and coddling him. Babies can hear, even in the womb my dear. I began talking to Blaise as soon as I found out I was pregnant. And have Blaise talk to him too. I know he’s not the biological father, but it will help the baby recognize familiar voices. Blaise will be around while he grows up.”
“Ah, Severus. After Harry removed his Mark, he needed to rest. It was the same with your father, but Severus’ was more difficult for Harry to deal with. That is what caused the magic depletion.” He looked over at Hermione, allowing her time to fit more pieces into her puzzle. “However, Severus began acting strangely. It was your father’s friendship with him that led us here. That, and a burning piece of jewellery.”
“Yes, my Lord.” He kissed the hem of his cloak once more, then back-pedalled to his spot in line once more.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Harry ticked his sides a bit, causing Draco to start flailing and giggling loudly.
“So, a simple salad. Vegetable medley soup. Maybe a shrimp kabob or a vegetable appetizer. Fish and potatoes for the main course. Dessert of… Oh! Chocolate mousse! I want some mousse, Harry. And chocolate silk pie. Oh, that will be divine! And afters of port and firewhiskey. What do you think? Not too much? I think it’s perfect.
I no own, so you no sue. I don’t own any characters or settings from the Harry Potter books. Those belong to J. K. Rowling. I would be so very happy if she’d allow me the use of one or two… or three of them, but I know she won’t so don’t try anything. Thank you, that is all.
“Go ahead, Harry,” Snape said quietly. “Anything is better than this.”
“Come now, Malfoy,” Hermione protested. “There’s more than that! You’re on pretty friendly terms with Harry, and the professors were calling you by a different name, and you are looking much better for you time spent in the Forest than even Harry does, and–”
“I know, baby,” Narcissa whispered. “You’ll be alright. I had a long labor too. But your birthing will be so much easier. You don’t have to actually do anything, you lucky sod.” She stroked his cheek and tucked a lock of hair behind his ear. “I want you to eat some of these ice chips, okay? Eat some for mummy.”
That night, he heard Snape return after giving his start-of-the-year speech to his Slytherins. The man went to bed early, knowing he’d be up early with the newest batch of urchins to try and teach. Harry figured, with Draco already asleep, he may as well turn in as well. Despite a few wake-ups during the night, Draco and Harry slept soundly.
“And what was that all about?”
So the plan was to give a series of three interviews to run a week apart each to a reporter that was
The words appeared before Snape in the air.
Snape rolled his eyes, but gestured back to the couple sitting on the couch.
More gesturing.
talkin’ mooshy-mooshy ‘bout nothin’.
“Ah, ‘could’ being the key word there. Give me that.” He snatched the disk out of Harry’s hand, opened the case, and popped the CD into their player. Taking out his wand (Harry wondered where he kept it since Draco’s boxer briefs didn’t have much space in them), he tapped the player twice and said, “Play random mix.” Rock music suddenly filled the air, and Draco’s voice was singing the words.
“You?” Blaise choked out. “Cook?! Someone call the
Not able to handle the one-sided yelling match any longer, Snape had burst into their bedroom. “Draco, Harry was more worried about your safety than that of anyone on the field of battle. Harry, Draco feels abandoned and mistreated for you ‘handling’ him, as if he had no ability to fight by your side. Both of you have a right to your feelings, but you must also understand that the other has a right to his feelings as well. Now kindly
Alright, all wrapped up in a pretty bow! What are your thoughts?
Harry was still holding Draco’s hand, but he used his other one to gently swipe on finger from his son’s head down to his feet. He counted ten toes, then maneuvered Corvus’ hand to wrap around the finger so he could count his fingers. With Draco’s other hand on the baby’s back, Corvus slowly morphed from shrieks to cries to whimpers to sniffles. He opened his dark blue eyes and looked right at Harry. With a head full of dark hair, he quickly signed to Draco that the poor boy was going to look like him and suffer his hair.
I wish you’d do it again.
Harry was still for a moment before signing,
That being their last class of the day, Ron and Hermione made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. After putting their books away, they left the castle and made their way out to the lake. It was only mid November, so it wasn’t too cold out. The squid was still making lazy laps near the surface of the lake. When they came upon it, they sat down on what they called ‘their rock’. Hermione lay back in Ron’s arms, seeking comfort silently. Ron freely gave it.
Harry indulged his husband while still getting his own bonding time with his son. He convinced Draco to hand the boy over to Molly and Narcissa, even Severus once. Hermione and Ron visited as often as they could. They’d decided to break up, but stay amicable. Draco said he wasn’t surprised. Hermione entered the Ministry, starting in a low position and working her way up through the ranks. She was determined to work on creature reform, Azkaban overhaul, and future legislation in general. Harry was sure she’d be great at it. Ron took some time off to figure out what he wanted to do. He was considering furthering his education, but didn’t know in what field. He decided to intern with his brothers for a couple of months each to see if there was a possible future in dragon care, cursebreaking, the Ministry, or entrepreneurship.
“How nice of you to volunteer Severus!” Dumbledore beamed. “If you could see that he is taken care of and placed in Minerva’s capable hands, you can then return to your other duties as previously discussed.” And that was the end of that discussion.
“Well, it would be a huge affair you realize. Potter and Malfoy? Since your blood family can’t be there, or you don’t want those few others there, the Weasleys would all be in attendance. They could bring their spouses or dates. Depending on the status of my family, they would be there. My father would stand with Arthur Weasley, much as he would hate it. I can’t help but think that if he would ask Severus to keep me from the Dark Lord then he wouldn’t mind standing near the Weasley patriarch long enough to see his son wed.
“Yes, Master Harry is in the room. He isn’t needing anything right now. He be eating breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, even tea times! Master McKay is just fine, but is very loud, sir. And he said Miss Theresa ma’am is coming by twice today.”
“Oh Harry! We’re going to be getting married! I need paper and a pen please. I find it so much easier to use than a quill and parchment.” Harry conjured the things for him, then he was lost in his own world of planning and muttering.
“Her name is Weasley now. And to keep from getting her and Ron confused,” Harry continued before Draco could start in, “you could call them Ron and Hermione.”
“I am. Draco asked me to meet him here, to talk about something. I, too, have something to tell him.” Once more, his hand covered the plane of his stomach.
, Harry signed.
Harry gestured wildly.
“He…” Draco stopped to think for a moment. “By doing what he was told? By coming back from missions successfully?”
“Crap,” he muttered. Thus began the task of cutting it down to a simple, short paragraph. Once it was down to five lines, Draco was satisfied. He’d told Harry of his desire to have their own vows at the wedding, and hoped his fiancé had thought of something before they put him to sleep. The wedding was to be in… three hours now. Everything had been taken care of. Even as he sat there, house elves were cooking their feast for six. He had left the wedding cake decision up to Severus. The clothing and hair accessories had been taken care of by McGonagall. Madam Pomfrey had had their rings taken care of. Everything except bathing and dressing, and waking Harry up, had been taken care of.
Most days Snape would enter his rooms to see Harry and Draco cuddling on the couch together. The first few times pissed him off to no end, but he knew it was going to happen whether he liked it or not. He drew the line at snogging however. The day he walked in to see them making out on his couch, he blew up at them and sent them to their room if they were going to “partake in such carnal acts”. Harry silently made the joke that Snape was jealous because he hadn’t been laid in so long.
“I want to know where Harry is!” a new voice suddenly butt in. The three teachers looked up with shock and bit of fear in their eyes at the other two-thirds of the Gryffindor Trio standing in the office. They knew they needed to speak with the both of them, but with Harry as protective as he was and Draco as emotional as he was, they knew it was not yet a possibility. Frankly, they were shocked it had taken this long for them to come forward again. “You made an announcement about Malfoy today. Was that true? Did you find him? What about Harry? What new developments are there? Has anything been done since we last had to demand answers?” Hermione asked rapidly.
“Nearly three weeks. Everyone’s worried sick about you. And I’m afraid Weasley and Granger know quite a bit more than I’d like them to. Apparently, you gave them necklaces?”
“I am not a lenient man, Ssseverusss,” the Dark lord hissed, drawing his wand once more. “If your posssition asss my ssspy hasss been compromisssed, then you are of no ussse to me. Avada-!”
“Yes sir, master Blaise.” Kipper disappeared and came back a few moments later. “He says he’s just fine.”
There was a bright flash and a small snap. The pair looked up to see Colin Creevy standing over them with his camera in hand and a big smile on his face. “I knew it!” he pronounced loudly, snapping another picture. “Everyone else said that I was wrong, but I wasn’t!” Another two pictures of the stunned pair. “There was no way Draco and Harry could be an item for very long. There was too much of history there. But did anyone listen to me? Nope! I said that Blaise and Harry would get together and they all laughed. Well, I’ll be the last one laughing now!” He flashed another picture before turning and running off to tell the news and develop the pictures.
Harry nodded. Then lifted one hand palm up and conjured a fireball. He shrugged as if to say ‘It’s easy.’.
Take a look at my boyfriend
“Yes, I believe I do. I shall ask Albus and Minerva what they think about telling Granger and Weasley. I have classes to prepare for. Do try and keep my rooms from becoming grounds for your arguments.” He turned and walked out of the room with a flare only he could handle.
“Okay, it’s the first trimester then. You should consider yourselves lucky that you haven’t lost the baby before now. The first three months he’s more likely to miscarry than any other time. The baby is as healthy as can be in this situation though; nothing life threatening just yet. Has Draco’s wrist been broken for more than three months?”
The Quibbler
When all five arrived in the potions’ master’s rooms, they quickly made their way to Harry’s and Draco’s private rooms within, led by Draco’s sobbing voice.
“Draco doesn’t want this. He doesn’t need this. Any of this. I cannot allow what I do to become what he does. Please, Severus, please help him. Tie him to a chair or chain him to a wall until he listens, but for the love of Merlin don’t let my life become his,” Lucius begged. Severus nodded once and then left. Lucius sent a silent prayer to all the Gods and Goddesses above for help.
“What about all those guys you slept with?”
Blaise just sighed and went back downstairs to face his mother. “How much of that did you hear?”
Shrieks rang out in the chamber, echoing off the stone walls around him. He ended the curse abruptly as he faltered and stumbled to his knees. A Death Eater moved forward to help his master off the ground. He was cursed for his actions. As the Dark Lord took to pacing again, he kept muttering about ‘that stupid Potter brat’ and ‘that cursed old bat Dumbledore’. It was a sign of how intense his anger was that the Death Eaters could understand him; he was speaking English.
Blaise left, giving the Frisbee back to the group. “Sorry guys, I have business to attend to.” He laughed when they began teasing him and went off to get Harry and Theresa. “Harry! Harry come here. I want you to meet someone. You too Theresa. Bring McKay. In fact, give McKay to Theresa.” He helped gather their things together and then took everything from Harry so he wasn’t carrying anything. “Just past where I was playing Frisbee. I want you to meet this guy.” They walked over to the house and up the steps. As they were walking in, Blaise said, “Harry, I’d like you to meet the biggest idiot on the face of the planet.”
for his
Draco repeated the words, his eyes never leaving Harry’s.
“Draco!” he suddenly thought aloud. “I can go home to Draco and still celebrate just fine.” With a little hop in his step and smile on his face, he took off for the exit. Surely his lover and husband of five years would have something special planned? Dinner, flowers, chocolates, his favourite movie, his favourite position? Something? Anything? Surely...
Disappointed, Harry spelled the calendar away. So there were no notes, no appointments, nothing. He went to fix himself a sandwich and find something sweet to munch on. He was depressed, and eating always made him feel a little better. Luckily his metabolism was high, so it didn't really matter how much he ate or when. He sat in front of the telly, something he insisted on having, and watched whatever looked good while he was channel surfing.
“You know,” Blaise began after one such incident, “I think I’m going to floo-call my parents and tell the we’d like to keep this house as our own. What do you think Theresa?”
“When the nundu attacked, she did something to his magic, altered it. It stopped fixing his eyes and started deteriorating them. He could no longer see in the typical sense of the word. Instead, his magic started feeling things out around him. He could see almost normally after about two weeks. I figure it works kind of sonar, like for bats or dolphins. He can send out pulses or just steady streams of magic to look for something. Normally it’s just the steady streams. What woke you the other morning was a pulse signalled for me and me alone. Understand?”
Of course, the pregnancy would be the most obvious thing when the reporter and Luna walked in the room. There was no hiding Draco’s eight-month-plus belly. But they were ready to tell their story in the order they wanted it and in the manner they wanted. They knew the reporter would be anxious to get to the point on Draco’s pregnancy, but they would steer the interview in the direction they wanted. The second interview would go into depth about the past and the detention-gone-wrong. The third interview would be about their wedding and pregnancy and future plans.
, before him, Draco dropped the velvet box where he stood, turned on his heel, and left the school. He walked to the edge of the Hogwarts wards, took one last look at the place where he’d gotten to know Harry, and apparated out, never wanting to be seen again.
“Silence, Severus. It’s not the first time and it won’t be the last. They’re probably sleeping. Draco needs his rest and Potter is still out cold.”
“I am Harry Zabini, and I have no reason to work because I’m freaking rich and just had a baby.” He blushed crimson at the first statement. “I am under Veratiserum currently. I had Draco’s baby, but married Blaise because of a mix-up. Now Blaise and I wish to part so McKay and I may reunite with Draco. McKay is our son.”
Blaise’s jaw dropped. “You self-absorbent, self-righteous, downright arrogant prick! Do you know the shit you put Harry through?!”
“Thank you, Terry,” Hermione interrupted, placing a hand on Ron’s forearm to stop him from completing that sentence. “The gesture is appreciated.”
“Okay okay,
playin’ kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy,
“Yeah, contractions started about two hours ago. Don’t Harry!” he said when Harry reached for his wrist and the bracelet there. “This is only the second contraction I’ve had! They don’t need to come yet when the contractions are so far apart. It won’t be coming just yet. Leave them to their jobs. It’s the first day of school. I’m sure Pomfrey has plenty of homesick firsties and it’s not really the first day of school until a cauldron explodes in a class or two. I’m fine. You’re here with me. We just need to do like the books said. Like Pomfrey said.”
“So crude. I repeat, I have nothing to say to either of you. Madam Pomfrey said he was okay now, right Headmaster?”
“Did you not hear me, idiot boy? No one can know about this. Only the six I mentioned, of which you are one of.” Snape sighed and brought one hand up to cover his eyes. “Do you know what your father said to me when we left a Death Eater meeting after you’d been gone for a month? He begged me to keep you from becoming what you were to become, what he is. Do you understand just what it is that Lucius is to the Dark Lord?”
“Dunno. We just did. It had been a while since anything had happened, and I guess we got lax in our defenses. We stumbled upon her lair I think. I heard a few mewling sounds before Harry fell to the ground coughing something awful. I ran to him, trying to help him. But he levitated me to a tree and put up wards to keep me there and anything from getting to me. Then the nundu crawled out from wherever and attacked him. He tried not to fight back too much, to show her that he meant no harm. He has this way of talking to the plants and animals… I can’t explain it. He’ll have to show you sometime.
“Yes sir. You are Harry Zabini, Blaise Zabini’s husband.”
She was silent for a few moments, thinking of her response. “If it is his first pregnancy, I would talk to you about everything there is involving a male pregnancy: the first few months, the cravings, the mood swings, everything including the actual birth. There are many possibilities for things to turn south, and I would want you able to cope with them and calm your husband down until a medical professional could arrive. I, personally, have been working in this field for several years and will maintain the utmost secrecy, at your discretion of course.” She flashed a smile.
There goes the next contestant.
It was Right.
“Eventually he’ll have to accept his diploma from Dumbledore, Harry,” he explained. “You’ll see him then, keep an eye on him, and then explain to him when this is over.” Harry planned on doing just that, except that Draco’s name was never called.
And if you do, well then don’t be afraid to take me by the hand
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of
“Ah, welcome to the land of English, Poppy,” Severus said, setting down his quill and smiling… almost, pleasantly. “I could not understand what you were saying so I merely ignored you.” The smile vanished and the Potions Master was back. “What can I do for you Poppy?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Jamaica. It’s the first one I can think of.”
“That is not what I meant!” Hermione gasped, going red in embarrassment.
Draco’s hand stilled, and his arms wrapped around him protectively. Lucius Malfoy took a step forward without thinking, refusing to allow any harm to possibly come near his child. And if his child was having his own child, then the protection was even more needed.
You know I wish that I had Ginny’s guy
Harry nodded.
It was by that time Draco’s contractions were coming fast enough, roughly every eight minutes, that Harry activated the bracelets. Pomfrey came through immediately, checking on Draco and suggesting they move to the private room in the Hospital Wing she’d set up for them. Harry and Molly went through first, then Draco, followed by Narcissa, and the mediwitch. Draco shuffled between Harry and Madam Pomfrey to the back room, stopping once for a contraction.
Eventually, she backed away from the two, wiping her eyes dry with a handkerchief and sniffling a little. She rounded on the dour Potions Master then. “And you, Severus, thank
“Okay, before you do that I need to know a few things right now. Is he more than three months pregnant?”
“Look at all that hair,” Blaise said quietly. “And it’s so dark. Looks like he’ll have your hair Harry.”
“Not quite, Draco. Harry has used much of his magic helping your father and Professor Snape. You said he used legillimancy just before losing consciousness? That must have been the final straw. He is too exhausted. The physical exhaustion comes from the magic trying to find something else to use as fuel. I gave him some of my magic, just a little, to keep his stores from depleting and start rebuilding instead. I’m going to put him to bed so he can recover comfortably, and then we’re all going to have a little chat. Right here in this room, so Draco will not have to be moved. Madam Pomfrey did say you were okay, however.”

While they didn’t need jobs, he knew Harry wouldn’t be able to stay at home all the time. Frankly, neither would he. But the child changed some of those plans. His child would not be raised by nannies and house elves. It was a lonely life for a child. Perhaps there could even be one or two more children down the road for this one to have siblings. But that was something to consider in another few years, not now.
“Why do you want this job?”
The Quill immediately began moving.
The spells were unexpected and the Dark Lord, and Snape for that matter, wasn’t ready for them. So a scream was ripped from Voldemort’s mouth at the cutting spell. “Oh shut up Tom,” Harry muttered in a bored tone. “
Harry turned his head to look at Blaise with a few tears in his eyes. “Thank-you,” he whispered. “Theresa? It’s… I feel… It’s weird. I can’t explain it. I feel like… It’s like I need… I don’t know!” he cried, giving up on trying to explain the feeling. “Like another craving!” he finally said. “It’s like I want something, and I see it, but I can’t get to it. What does that mean?”
“No, I offered some to the doctors,” he said, motioning to the four sitting on barstools on the other side of the counter, “and Mitchsens, Whittier, and Johansen took a piece. Rhodes declined saying it was your ham and not mine to give.” Harry stared wide-eyed for a moment then turned to the doctors. He looked back at Blaise. “Mitchsens,” he said pointing to the male doctor. “Whittier and Johansen,” he continued, pointing to the next two doctors. “And finally Rhodes. This is Harry Zabini.”
Another bite on his shoulder brought him out of his thinking just before a single finger tapped across the tip of his nose. “I know, I know,” Draco mumbled. “I’m thinking too much. Does it help if I told you I was thinking of you?” Harry tightened his arms around his waist slightly in response. “There, see? It’s not as if I were thinking about Charms or Severus.” Although he couldn’t hear it, he knew Harry was growling. His suspicions were confirmed when Harry bit the back of his neck lightly, but stayed there instead of releasing as he did with his neck.
The Quill hovered for a moment before writing very slowly,
Draco had tears in his eyes as Harry brushed his fingers over his own cheek before brushing them over Draco’s. “Let me think on it a little more? I’ll answer before we go to sleep tonight. That way there’s still time to tell Severus and Dumbledore whether or not to send for Weasley and Granger. ‘Kay? Are we agreed on that?” Harry nodded. They hugged, then kissed, and then Harry ran a hand down Draco’s back to cup his arse. “And that will get you only one place, Mr. Potter.”
“That’s what I’m trying to tell you! He’s not–”
“Touché. Why are you here?”
Blaise moved a bit closer and reached a hand out to rub Harry’s stomach, hoping to soothe McKay into going back to sleep. It wasn’t the first time he’d done this. However, Harry always had the same reaction. When he first touched the bulging stomach, Harry jumped then relaxed after a few moments. “Harry? You’re stomach is hard.”
“Regardless, it was yours first.”
“I’ve done all I can for him,” she declared. “The rest is up to him. And, if I know him at all, he should be just fine. I will return to my ward to check on Severus. And knowing him, he will return here by this evening. Might I suggest an explanation before this one out here blows his top?”
Sunday came, and so did Harry and McKay when it was dinner time. He held McKay in his left arm while he ate with his right hand. Blaise asked him how he was doing and if everything was okay. Harry simply nodded. When he was done and McKay began to get fussy, Harry stood to leave. Blaise reached out and took hold of Harry’s wrist to stop him. “Will you please not leave? Not tonight. You’ve been doing this for months, and I’m worried Harry. You lock yourself up in that room. It’s not good for you or McKay. What’s wrong?”
“Okay,” Draco agreed. He looked down at Harry. “It’s no problem Harry, just a sign of how much I love you.”
“I understand,” Blaise interrupted. “It’s the truth, on all accounts.” He sighed. “Theresa did say to take it easy though. I know you like the gardens, but it’s nearly freezing out there. Even with the extra layers and heating charms, you have to be careful of ice on the ground. And although I’m not McKay’s father I am your friend. I’m concerned is all, okay? So just… take it easy. I don’t want you to have gone through all of this just to have something happen. I’m sorry to keep bringing you down by saying that, but I just want you to be careful.”
Misters Potter-Malfoy, I’d like to present your son.” Without wasting another second, Pomfrey lay the tiny, wailing, naked boy on Draco’s chest. Almost instantly, his heartbeat seemed to calm their son.
The Prophet
relationship,” someone murmured loudly.
. Draco wanted this confirmation, that Harry still wanted and needed him.
“Are you really married to him?” the ex-Death Eater whispered. His gaze was on the sleeping Harry on the bed and not his son, but the question was obviously directed at the young blonde. “Did you cultivate such a relationship between the two of you that you married him? I can understand the child; survival takes precedence over all in times such as you have gone through, my son. But marriage?” He looked at his son to see the truth of his statements.
“Harry, what are you doing?” Ron asked, coming into the room more sedately than his girlfriend had.
Draco huffed, not happy where this was leading. “Fine. Weasley, come sit down. You can stay
Luna, on the other hand, married Rolf Scamander and took off on a worldwide tour to document creatures with the zoologist. Neville went on to university to master in herbology. Harry and Draco hired tutors to help them through the seventh year material, an expert in each class. Most were not Ministry-appointed. Severus himself tutored them in potions during his free periods and in the evenings. Dumbledore held a special lecture in the Great Hall shortly before Halloween, having asked Harry and Draco to speak to the school about why the Forbidden Forest was so forbidden. It seemed to have properly scared the students into obeying at least one rule.
Dr. Morris put her hands up in a defensive posture. “Okay, okay, keep your knickers on. Let me go get the supplies I can do them both at once, it will be easier.” She left the room, mumbling about crazy people and their messed up lives. When she came back, she had a small tray floating behind her with several vials, some empty and some not, on it. She set it on a spare counter. “Blaise, you take this one. Only half the dosage that’s in there please. Thank-you. Now you Harry, you take the other half. Good, just set that here. Now then, I will need a bit of hair from McKay, so while the Veratiserum works into your systems, I’ll cut a lock… just… here.” She snipped a few hairs from McKay’s head. “Please, neither of you say anything to Blaise or Harry. I don’t want the potion in effect just yet so no talking either.”
“Blaise, your turn.” Blaise walked forward and allowed the doctor to take some strands from his right temple as well. “I have added Draco Malfoy’s hair to the paternity test on the left. I am now adding Blaise Zabini’s hair to the paternity test on the right. I am now swirling both carefully to mix the hairs and paternity tests. It will only take a moment to get the results.” Sure enough, as soon as she stopped moving the vials, the one on the right (Blaise’s) started turning a deep red colour. “The vial on the right, the one containing Blaise Zabini’s hair, has turned a violent red. He is not McKay’s biological father. The one of the left, Draco Malfoy’s, has remained blue. He is McKay’s biological father. I state, for the record, that Draco is McKay’s biological father and Harry is, for lack of a better term, McKay’s biological mother. Take the antiserum please.”
A piece of parchment materialised with writing beginning to form on it.
Harry nodded, moving down Draco’s neck to just below his pulse point. It was a very sensitive spot for the blonde. The reaction was immediate: Draco ground down against him, an answering hardness that was equally naked was rubbed against him. Draco moved to impale himself on the length, but Harry stopped him, gesturing for a few moments before just holding Draco’s hips and rocking back and forth. Draco nodded, holding onto Harry’s shoulders. It didn’t take very long. After the dream he’d had, Harry was on edge. And the silent cry of ecstasy never failed to send Draco tumbling after him into the land of bliss.
Before he moved forward with the obvious, Harry maneuvered himself down to Draco’s hips so he could use his tongue in the manner Draco has specifically asked for.
“N-no,” Draco answered, starting to become scared now. What was it that his father did that had his godfather edging around it so much? Why was Harry tensing up beside him? What was it?! “What is it?!” he questioned aloud.
“I wish to get out now.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
As he gazed upon all of his followers, he made a mental tally of who was there and who was not. He could see beneath the masks, could tell who was who without seeing their faces or bodies. When he had finished his once over, he smiled and watched all of them tense in preparation for whatever horror was about to befall them. His gaze stopped on one Death Eater, finally, and he laughed to himself. “Luciusss,” he almost whispered, “come forth.”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter. Mr. Malf- Oh my!” he gasped as he finally looked up and saw Draco’s belly. “Please, forgive me.” His slight Russian accent had gotten deeper with his exclamation, but was receding once more. “I was not prepared for such an event. Again, my apologies.”
He removed his fingers and guided his cock to Draco’s entrance.
“Yeah. Thanks Blaise. Really.” In just a few moments, both were sound asleep. However, that wouldn’t last for very long. Harry awoke to a sharp kick in the side. “You need to cut that out McKay Draconis Zabini, right now. Blaise will be most upset if he’s woken twice in one night because of you. Now settle down. I mean it. Don’t wake Blaise.”
“Blaise! Blaise, stop!” Harry said, laughing. “Calm down. I will answer you questions one at a time. Yes, I am sure. For two days now. I am two months along. I am fine. No, there isn’t anything you can do. I am perfectly capable of standing by myself. Madame Pomfrey  confirmed it two days ago. I need to tell Draco.”
Harry moved his hands rapidly, interrupting Draco.
” He turned to his godfather, still blushing but looking apologetic. “I’m sorry, Severus. This is my fault, not Harry’s. It’s the pregnancy. Madam Pomfrey tried to warn us that my … libido, would increase around month six. I didn’t realize just what she meant, that I’d lose all inhibitions. I have so little control over myself right now. And there’s certainly no ‘off switch’ that I’ve been able to find.” He couldn’t even look the older man in his eyes, he was so embarrassed.
“Mr. Potter, if you will please follow me,” Poppy said, motioning to a back room. She began to walk forward, but Harry didn’t move. He nodded at Severus, and then motioned for him to follow. “Mr. Potter, Professor Snape has a class to teach and will not be joining us. You will follow me so I may treat you now. Please.” She turned and continued walking, but Harry still didn’t move until Severus had disappeared through the fireplace once more. “Would you care to tell me how you came to be in this state? Lay Mr. Malfoy on the bed here, if you please. And you can lay down on this one here.”
And he did. He started with the detention-giving class, giving his view on things as they were and as they were just then with hind-sight. He left little out, perhaps only glossing over some events; others he went into great detail. He did not stop once they returned to Hogwarts. He continued on to describe their wedding and why he chose what he did. With a tear in his eye, he recited their vows for his father, explaining the meaning behind Harry’s simple gesture.
“Because he asked me to,” Blaise answered easily. “Wait, what?!”
“Okay, sorry. Have you ever had sex with a woman, Blaise?”
“Hey Ron,” the boy said. “My name’s Terry Boot. I’m Head Boy.” Ron knew who he was. As he had said, he was the Head Boy. “Listen, I heard Hermione crying last night and I was just wondering if she was okay. I mean, I know it’s been a little rough for her lately. I’m sure it’s been hard for you too.”
“It’s just so… weird. I mean, I was wallowing in my own misery this morning and now I have a son!” Draco said, still shocked by everything. “I insist that you all stay here for dinner tonight, my treat. I’ll cook you whatever you want.”
.” The body burst into flames. The pair just sat and watched as the cloth, flesh, and bones were melted away. “Well, now that that’s done.” Harry fell over in a dead faint, just barely being caught by his professor.

Harry started gesturing wildly. Sometimes Draco would agree, and sometimes he’d start to disagree before being cut off.

, he signed, tucking Draco into bed.
Lucius internally flinched, not really knowing what to do. He’d been so worried about his son he’d neglected to prepare for this happening. Really, it was a miracle it had taken this long to happen. “My Lord, he is not ready to undergo this taking at this time.”
Harry threw his free hand behind him to close, lock, silence, and ward the door; as if to say ‘Who cares?’ or ‘That’s exactly where I want to get to.’.  They took their time disrobing, using hands and mouths to map each other’s bodies once more, relearning every inch of their lover. Then Harry carefully picked Draco up and lowered him on their bed before lying beside him, careful to never put his full weight on his lover or child. Lots of touching, and lube, later and Harry was sliding home in one long stroke. He paused, giving Draco time and opportunity to move and get comfortable. After so many times together, it didn’t take long however.
he thought as tears poured down his face. Wrapping both arms around the physical evidence of his child, he buried his face in the pillows once more.
he signed.
“There is no way in the world you could understand what I'm going through!” Draco snapped, turning away from the group and fleeing the room. They all watched him leave, each thinking different things about the young man.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“Forty-five minutes. I woke at about 2:30am and went to get some cookies and milk after walking around a bit. That usually helps, but it didn’t this time. Ouch!” They stopped for a moment. “Please tell me we’re nearly there.”
“Did I ask for his birth date?”
“Just before McKay was born,” Harry began, his eyes growing in shock as he answered an answer he didn’t know he had. “I wasn’t feeling well and went to Blaise’s room. I knocked, and then entered. I asked if he would mind sharing his bed, and he said he didn’t. Then he scooted over to the other side of the bed and I crawled in, keeping to my side. We fell asleep for a few hours.” There was a moment’s pause. “We didn’t have sex!” Harry explained. “We slept together, literally. We were sleeping in the same bed. The question was just worded weirdly.”
“That’s two words!”
“Draco won’t translate for you? No. Draco won’t… He won’t? Won’t do the interview. Whyever not?”
Draco slumped against his lover, neither caring about the wet mess between them. Just as they were to slip into a deserved nap, there was pounding against their door. Draco immediately felt Harry tense beneath him. He yawned and clutched Harry closer. “Just let them in,” he said sleepily. “They’ll see that we’re fine, freak out a bit, and go away. It will be better than putting up with that pounding all day.”
“Calm down Harry,” Blaise soothed. “I just want you to tell him about Draco at every possible second. I want him to have no doubts that his other daddy is Draco Malfoy, arrogant and stubbourn prick of Slytherin.”
then entirety of Wizarding Britain to turn against your husband? He’s going to have a hard enough time when they find out he’s blind and mute. He deserves better, and your child deserves better. And, frankly, of the three Houses, Potter would have the first heir. You would have the second, and Black the third. Should you decide to provide an heir for all three. There are ways to bestow all three Houses on the one child, if you want that instead.” Snape paused there to drink his lavender tea and give Draco some time to vent.
, he began his plotting to attack Hogwarts. He failed spectacularly and fell to Harry’s silent spell. When Draco later asked what spell he’d used, Harry explained that he merely imagined Voldemort gone. Well and truly gone. No trace left to resurrect, no pieces left for nefarious rituals or potions, no soul piece to inhabit another body. Harry had blinked him out of existence. It took all of Harry’s energy and he ended up in a coma for three days after the battle. Muggle science had it correct – mass exists and cannot truly be gotten rid of. Instead, it must turn into something else. Even conjuring was bringing mass together in a different form.
“Good evening, Draco,” came Hermione’s voice, chipper as always. “How are you today? Has there been any change in –
“I agree with Dr. Mitchsens. Top of the line for everything, and anything you desire for your husband. A male pregnancy is harder than a female one, I won’t lie. However, anything you think is needed I will do my best to get. If I can make it easier on either of you, I will. I’ve worked extensively with these kinds of cases and I believe that a hands-on approach is best when dealing with someone as emotional as your husband. I would tell you everything that related to this pregnancy, and then Harry if you advised it. Adding stress to a pregnancy is never a good thing to do.”
“It’s not that they don’t already know,” Draco explained. “It’s that I don’t want our wedding photos to have me as big as a Quidditch Pitch! I mean, I’m already getting there as it is. It’s not hard to see that I’m two-and-a-half months along. Another few weeks, and I’m going to stop wearing my pants because they won’t fit anymore!”
“Sir, are you married?”
“Yes, it is true,” Draco answered with a firm voice.
Harry nodded again. “What was my name before I was married?”
“Now let me say my piece, first. I’ve looked over the Headmaster’s plan and I find it quite sound. You know the information is going to get out sooner or later and it’s best if it’s done on your terms. It’s also important that the general public knows about your parents. Their futures depend on their actions, which cannot be known unless you tell it. Also, it’s important that the Potter heir is announced. By now, you should have announced it. You know that. Eight months? You’re nearly due as it is, and bursting at the seams.”
Hey! (Hey!) You! (You!) I want to be your boyfriend
was when he’d found the love of his life.
“And this is because of the nundu attack?” Dimitri questioned, still writing furiously.
“He won’t stop kicking. Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you.”
“What? We’re having a baby. You didn’t expect the stork to just drop it off, did you? Sex was involved, lady and gent, sex
“Colin wait!” Harry called after him, but the younger Gryffindor just kept on running. “Oh Merlin! Now everyone’s going to think I’ve broken up with Draco and that you’ve proposed to me! What are we gonna do? What’s Draco going to think? Oh sweet Merlin, he doesn’t know about the baby! He thinks I was with you, and even if I told him now he’d think the baby was yours! What am I gonna do Blaise? Where will I go? What do I do for a job? What-?”
Harry moved forward and pulled her into his arms as much as her large belly would allow. “Thank-you, 'Mione. You know I love you.”
Harry was standing in an instant, his hand outstretched toward his Potions Professor. Draco seemed to be the only one to understand this action, because he grabbed Harry’s non-lifted arm and pleaded with him. “Please don’t, Harry! Don’t hurt him! He’s just worried about me. He doesn’t understand what’s happened these last five months. Please, don’t hurt him. I want you to stay here, with me. You can’t do that if you hurt him. They’ll take you away from me. Don’t leave me.”
“Thanks, Weasley. You're a big help,” Draco hissed sarcastically. He hung up the phone, another object Harry had insisted on having, and looked at the stairs that would lead to his bedroom. He had to find a way to cheer Harry up quite a bit. Thinking quickly, he made a floo call to Harry's favourite restaurant for a quick reservation. Then he conjured Everlasting Flowers, Harry's favourite drink, and his favourite chocolates. Girly, but it worked for Harry. He quietly made his way upstairs again and stood in the doorway. “Harry? Harry, I know what you're thinking, and it's not true. I know today's your birthday.”
“We’re going back to the castle.”
“Very good, very good. Why do you want this job?”
Next chapter is the plan and the first interview. Draco is only getting bigger, people. And it’s summer, so he’s all out of sorts. Oh! And Harry’s birthday!
“Feel... Love... Passion... Need th... those.”
So Harry’s answer was to not wear shoes either. Nor trousers nor a shirt. He did wear pants; he couldn’t handle the idea of meeting a stranger without wearing at least pants. They entered the living room to find Snape waiting for them, drinking some tea that turned Draco’s stomach. The man immediately banished it in deference. Silently, he stood and led them to the same room off the Great Hall where the Champions from the Tri-Wizard Tournament had been taken three years ago.
“Yes.”
“Yes Draco,” Snape sighed. “As much as I detest Mr. Potter, and I know the feeling is mutual, I will try to get along for your sake. I knew he would inspect my rooms when I offered to let both of you stay. I thank you for staying out of my personal bedroom, Potter. I will try to return the same courtesy.” Harry nodded, then turned his eyes back to Draco, watching him like a hawk. “Now then, I realize that Mr. Potter has your prenatal care all taken care of, but for the rest of us who don’t know what he knows I’d like to do a weekly check-up. Does that suit both of you? I would suggest Tuesday afternoons, as they are my lightest days when it comes to schooling.”
“So your position has been compromised?
Harry turned back to Severus and started signing to him. “I don't understand, Potter!” Snape sneered, turning back to Lucius to help the mediwizards fix the man. “You need to realize that we weren't there through the months with you like Draco was. We don't understand your language. I am glad that you and Draco found a way to communicate, but that is not something that can be transferred to everyone else. We don't understand, and we don't have the time it takes to interpret what you're trying to say.”
“Get back here Draco!” Blaise called, following the blonde. “That’s not my baby, it’s yours! That’s your son, Draco!” Draco froze and turned to face Blaise with a pale face. “Yeah. Weren’t expecting that one were you? The day that you were going to propose, Harry told me he was pregnant and I hugged him in
“Fine. I am not leaving the room however. I am only turning my back. Clap your hands or something when you are done, if you please.” Then he did just that, leaving Harry to get dressed on his own. Not ten minutes later came the clap that signaled that Harry was done. “Mr. Potter, Draco wished that everything be per–” Regardless of his doubts that the young Gryffindor was perfectly dressed and groomed in ten minutes, there wasn’t a hair out of place on the younger man’s head. His stubble had been shaved, his hair combed, his robes on and wrinkle free. “Amazing. Now, I have warded Draco’s door so that it is impossible for you to enter or even touch the door. However, I have allowed sound to pass through so that Draco himself may assure you of his well being. Come along.”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
“I… don’t have an answer, truly. There was no reason to it. It was pleasurable, or I wouldn’t have done it so often, but I like women. See? I couldn’t have had sex with Harry!”
Both Dumbledore and Pomfrey whirled from their watch over the Malfoy patriarch to gaze at their unconscious potions’ master.
“Yes,” Draco answered, still not taking his eyes off of Harry. “I just wanted to tell you what you mean to me, what everything you’ve ever done for me means to me. We were not friends, Harry, but we became so much more. Through some of the worst trials life could throw at us, we overcame our mutual hatred and found the purest emotion for one another: love. And now we’re to be joined for all eternity, and have a child together. I love you Harry, and I just wanted to tell you that.”
They were two whole parchment sheets long.
he told himself.
“Why do you want this job?”
He kept one eye on his little family and the other on the game. When the Frisbee came to him, he threw it to one of his teammates down the beach, Leonard might have been his name. However, he overshot his strength and it landed on a porch of one of the beach front properties that was there. Blaise apologized to the other guys and ran up to the house. A man was standing there, Frisbee in hand. “Sorry about that. I didn’t mean to throw so hard. It won’t- Draco?!” There in front of him stood the blond Slytherin himself. “Is this where you’ve been hiding? Holy hell, man. Harry and I searched for you all over the place.” He shot a look over his shoulder at Harry playing with McKay in the water. “What in the hell is wrong with you?!”
“Well, come along. Draco says that you have a way of seeing things around you. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how Draco has designed a small portion of the Great Hall for this occasion. He put a lot of thought into this, and wanted everything to be perfect for you.” She looked sideways and saw the slightly shocked expression on her student’s face. “Yes, Mr. Potter… Harry. He did all of this for you. I know he is a pureblood and that it is against his upbringing to have a child before he is married, but he wants you to be happy as well. He thought about you when deciding many things.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The House name isn’t even that important,” he bit out between clenched teeth. “We combined names, so it’s not like people won’t know. Why does anyone get a say in my life? my child’s life? What business is it of theirs? They don’t need to know. It hasn’t even been born yet! Everyone is all up in It’s business and it hasn’t even truly started life yet!” He wrapped his arms around his large belly as much as he could in a protective embrace. “You don’t get it, do you? No one needs to know about It. It’s safer that way. I can keep It safe if no one knows,” he whispered, a tear falling from one eye.
“The middle name is perfect Harry,” Blaise began softly, slowly. “Even the first name, McKay, is a nice name. I like it. But the last name… Harry, it would have to be McKay Draconis Zabini. You married me, not Draco. There’s no telling what would happen if you introduced your baby as a Malfoy. An upset would be a vast understatement. I want his middle name to be Draconis, and was going to suggest ‘Draco’ myself. However, the last name
“That’s okay. Harry, do you love Blaise?”
He’s the only one I got (ba ba da da)
“We reset the wards, remember? Harry doesn’t have Zabini blood so he wouldn’t be able to get in,” Mr. Zabini answered for his son and son-in-law. “Go on boys. And welcome to the family Harry. We’re happy you decided to become a part of it. I’m sure we’ll all get along very well together.”
Silence followed the explanation until Snape broke it. “Are you okay Draco? You’ve had your hand over your abdomen ever since we could see you again. And Potter, why are you smiling?”
“Not really,” Harry said with a sniffle. “I love Draco Malfoy, and I always will. No matter how much of a prat he’s being right now. When he left, he broke my heart. Blaise kept me strong enough to deal with these things for now, and I thank him with every breath I take, but he’s not Draco. I tried to tell him that he couldn’t do this for me, but he insisted, saying he wanted to help his friends. I’m so sorry Mrs. Zabini. I really am.”
In the doorway, Ron and Hermione looked on in shock. Draco Malfoy and Harry were in close proximity. Harry was hurt. But none of the adults were questioning Malfoy as they should be. What Hermione noticed, which Ron had not, was the look about her Slytherin classmate. For someone who had spent the last six months in the Forbidden Forest trying to survive, he didn’t look as malnourished as Harry did. Something was not adding up here.
He received a look before he watched Harry’s hand disappear through the wall. Quickly, he followed his silent husband through the wall to stand before a door. When he tried to open it, he found it was locked. Harry placed a hand on the door, closed his eyes in concentration, and slowly began to unravel the wards there one by one. When the last was taken down, a piercing wail cut through the air. Both boys jumped back in shock, not expecting the noise. As Draco ran through the door, Harry threw his own silencing and warding charms up.
Complete silence followed his outburst and revelation. No one could say anything at all. Slowly, Draco lowered himself back into his chair. Though he was not that far along in his pregnancy and he was not showing that much, he could almost feel how upset his child was with the outburst. He tried to sooth him or her with his hand on his midsection, silently thinking calming thoughts to it. His actions did not go unnoticed. Hermione had a very keen eye and quick mind. What surprised him most was Ron’s reaction.
to copulate in their own rooms. He couldn’t believe the situation had gotten so out of hand that he was left to debase himself before the Golden Boy just so he could have afternoon tea, sans cock and balls in his face.
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no.
“Please, for the love of Merlin, someone help! Stay with me, Harry. Help is coming, I just know it. Help!”
“Well, we were all really good friends during our last years in Hogwarts, mum.” Blaise mentally kicked himself. He never called his mother ‘mum’ unless he was trying to hide something. “Really, I’m okay with it.”
“The Ministry is like that and you know it, Harry,” Draco sighed. “It is quite possible that what Dr. Morris said is true. But quite frankly, I’d do this twice a day for the next six months if it meant getting you and McKay back. I’d even,” he paused to take a steadying breath, “I’d even cut my hair that many times to prove McKay’s paternity.”
“I said go to hell
Harry gestured; Draco translated. “He doesn’t have any diseases. His body heals him naturally, professor. Has ever since he started focusing his magic so I could use his wand. And then once we found out I was pregnant, he’s been concentrating even more to me. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with him.”
The voice broke his thoughts and concentration. Draco was standing in the doorway with a concerned look on his face, one hand on his belly. At five months, there was no hiding the baby bump without some serious work. The blonde was always slight and pretty. There wasn’t much else to describe the boy. He was eating properly and taking the nutrition potions, but it didn’t change his genes. He came from a line of thin men and women. The baby showed more prominently on him than it would most other men.
“Of course, Father. I will share our tale with you.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Their Tuesday check-ups were interesting. Draco and Harry would spend their day however they wished, waiting for Snape to come home. When he did, they went to their room to let him relax before the check-up. Then they’d all meet back in the living room for Madam Pomfrey. Once she arrived, Draco would lie down on the couch and Harry would stand behind it. It was quick after that: just a few spells, maybe a potion or two. After three or four visits, she had Snape brew a nutrient potion specifically for The Fetus. They called it The Fetus because Harry refused to know what gender their child was. It was during a visit that went by rather quickly that Pomfrey brought up a new subject.
“Will you tell me the whole story now, Draco?” Lucius whispered. “I’d like to know just how your rival became my son-in-law. I can understand the need to hold on to anything that can keep you sane during such a terrible time as these last months have surely been for you. But I really must know how you can go from rivalry to marriage.”
“Well, come on you
“Ah, a wise choice, Mr. Potter-Malfoy,” McGonagall cooed. “A hearty vegetable soup for such a cold night. And the salad looks divine as well. How is it, Albus?”
Harry was fine, Draco was fine, it was the day after Christmas, and Voldemort was gone. What else was needed? A good shag from his boyfriend was all Harry wanted. And he got one. The holidays ended and school began once more in January. Everyone was so excited that Voldemort was finally gone. Parties were held nearly every weekend in the dorms, the Room of Requirement, the Great Hall. Eventually, their sixth year ended. Harry was worried Dumbledore would make him go back to the Dursleys’, but his fears were in vain. He ended up, weirdly enough, spending the summer at Hogwarts in Snape’s rooms.
Harry pressed one slick finger into his husband, pumping slowly in and out. Then he added another. Draco’s pleas were a running litany that hardened Harry’s cock. He was only a man, after all. His sexy husband pleading and begging for sex was a turn on, one he couldn’t deny. He scissored his fingers to open Draco up for him. Even though he knew it was useless, Draco begged for faster and harder ministrations. As expected, Harry ignored them. He did add a third finger, however, to be sure he would not harm his husband.
Blaise laughed. “That’s practically what she told me. I agree. What about Johansen?”
Harry really did fall out of his chair at that one. The song changed, but was still country.
So he began to threaten the boy. First it was with his life, but Harry didn’t really care about that. Then it was his friends’ lives. Harry was slower to taunt Voldemort after that, but it still would not loosen his tongue. When Voldemort unknowingly came across the information that Harry and Draco were friends, he treated it as a way for Draco to get information. However, Harry had threatened to kill every last person who ever even thought about laying a hand on his boyfriend.
But Draco wasn’t paying any attention to Harry just then. Pomfrey had warned him that anxiety came with the territory of being pregnant, especially in the fifth through eighth months. He just didn’t expect it to be this intense! It was so real, so consuming. In just a few short months, he would hold a tiny life in his arms and control every aspect of it. He could turn his child into the next Merlin... or the next Voldemort. The child could be as thick as Crabbe or as bright as Granger. They could be as faithful as Weasley or as conniving as one of the Patils. And it was all up to him.
“Simple blood thinner with an anti-coagulant potion,” Snape answer, glancing over Harry’s list. “This is almost perfect. You forgot one thing though: sliced caterpillars. They’re necessary for making the blood platelets thinner and therefore ineffective. Take the potion.”
“Yes, Mr. Zabini.”
“Harry,” Blaise soothed, pulling the distraught young man into his arms, “it will be okay. All you have to do is explain to him what’s going on. He’ll understand, I promise. Nothing is going to happen as long as you explain what happened. You must-”
“Would you listen for five minutes before you try to kill me?!” Snape cried, watching as his shield almost gave way. “I was sent to prepare you for your wedding. Draco is safe, in another room. It was his wish that you not see each other. No, I do not understand the language you two use to talk to each other so I have no idea what you’re saying. If it’s a sarcastic remark about you not being able to see at all, then my answer is I don’t care. Draco is dressed and almost ready to be escorted to the Great Hall. I cannot say the same of you however. Your robes are here. Draco asked that your hair be pulled back with this.” He carefully thrust the pin into Harry’s hand.
“He’s said he would like to live here before.”
There was complete silence for a moment before Harry fell backwards on the bed, holding his sides as he curled up into a ball. The other three rushed to his side to see what was the matter. It turned out that he was laughing, but without noise it looked like he was in great pain. When he finally stopped laughing, Harry explained to Draco why it was so funny.
All that’s left now is the epilogue to tie everything up in a nice, little bow. Thanks, all!
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
And that was the end of the fiasco of the beginning of Harry’s adult life. Moral of the story: ask questions before storming off to Jamaica like a two year old who’s rich enough to do so.
After a few moments of silence, Mrs. Zabini sighed. “So he’s pregnant with Draco’s baby, and you’re doing him a favour by marrying him so he doesn’t have a bastard child?”
“My name is Doctor Theresa Rhodes. I specialize in all aspects of male pregnancy, including the labour and delivery. I was hired to care for a pregnant wizard and his child.”
But no one was coming. No one was there. He had no choice but to let go of Harry or risk falling himself.
“Set them down and thank-you Kipper.” Kipper was gone once more. “I’m going to place a sheet up so you don’t see what I’m doing, but don’t worry. I’ll be talking to you the entire time.” The sheet appeared. “I’m going to spell your pants off Harry, and then place a numbing charm on the lower half of your body. Giving birth is painful, but I’m going to lessen the pain as much as possible. Okay? Here we go.” Harry gasped as the cold air hit his bare skin, then once again when he felt the spell take place. “Everything looks good Harry. You’ve formed a temporary canal. Let me know if you feel anything or experience anything.”
“It’s my child too, you know. It’s doing well. Look, I’m getting fatter every day. Madam Pomfrey says I should have gained two stone by now! Can you imagine that? Two stone? What’s worse is she says I should gain almost another half a stone by the birthing. She also said the baby is actually a baby now and not just a bunch of cells grouped together. And sometimes, I can feel it moving. And it should weigh about a pound all on its own in there. And I’m over halfway done now. And soon we’ll have a baby. Oh, Merlin. Soon we’ll have a baby. Soon. As in, three or four months. Oh, Merlin, I’m not ready. I’m not ready to have a baby! Harry, I’m not ready!”
“Too late,” Blaise mumbled. He gave a loud yawn. “What’s wrong now?”
happen. Got it? Okay then. On with the fic.
“Severus!” Draco cried, sitting up suddenly. “How long have you been there? Harry, how long has he been there?”
“What ‘he’s not’ is going anywhere. He’s unconscious. And I aim to put you in the same state in a matter of minutes.”
Harry blushed furiously and squirmed in his seat. “One. Draco Malfoy. And he’s the only one I’ll ever have sex with again.” His blush deepened. Draco gave him a peck on the cheek.
“My dear boys, my dear sweet boys,” she murmured, tears gathering in her eyes. She was just about to move forward and hug Harry to her when the door burst open and Dumbledore walked in.
“I-I know,” Draco stuttered, wiping his eyes clear of tears. “I just don’t understand how he could do that. He always taught me to be proud of who I am, that a Malfoy never bowed down to anyone. And then, then I learn this! It’s just not right, not right at all. I was so happy…”
“I think it’s a marvellous idea! I suppose this is because of the upcoming child?” The twinkle was at full sparkle in the old man’s eyes.
“I’ll set up a party room just to hold one of the celebrations,” Harry mumbled.
, he self-corrected.
While Molly snapped a picture of the cute moment, Narcissa was timing the contractions. “That one was six minutes since the last one,” she told the mediwitch.
Hermione offered a small smile and relaxed into the comforting hug of her boyfriend. “You’re right. This is Harry we’re talking about. He’ll be okay. They’ll find him eventually. He’ll make it and be okay and come back to us and everything will be normal again.” The common room returned to its normal activity after that, thinking to themselves that it was simply a lovers’ spat. That couple had had more than its fair shares of those, they all knew.
“ ‘Please’? My my my. What in all the nine kingdoms has you begging for
“Very wise. If I’m not nearby, they will be alerted. I will take these to them immediately then. Smart thinking, Potter…-Malfoy.” He rose and left the rooms quickly. That blasted name change still confounded him!
Both boys nodded, though Harry was still smirking. If there was any way to lay claim to Draco and make sure Snape knew it, he’d succeeded. As the pair sat on the couch, he kept a possessive arm around his expecting husband. Draco picked the book he’d been reading back up. It was another male pregnancy book; he couldn’t stop reading them. He was so hungry for knowledge and information. Every so often he’d read a sentence or passage out loud to the other two men in the room, keeping them informed as well.
“Okay. I agree completely. His answers to me were pompous and he was late when he arrived. Only a few minutes, but it didn’t even seem to faze him. He thinks he’s the best simply because you’re Harry Potter. Never forget that Harry, you are first and foremost Harry Potter. You will always be you. You are only a Zabini by name.”
“It hurts, mum,” he whimpered. Harry felt his heart clench. “And they’re still so far apart. It takes hours!”
he signed again.
“Blibbering humdingers,” Luna supplied. She started writing quickly.
’s fireplace and floo connection to floo into the infirmary where Draco and Madame Pomfrey stood waiting.
a fit of pregnancy! This is how I feel and you
Ron silently sighed and let the tantrum run its course. He went through this maybe twice a week. It’s not that he didn’t feel the same way, he just didn’t know what to do. Hermione was the brains, she thought things through so as not to make a mistake. Harry was the point man, he got the job done. Ron was the strategy, he did the in between things. Hermione thought it out, Ron started the action, Harry finished it. Well, Hermione wasn’t thinking and Harry wasn’t there to finish it. It was suddenly up to him to be all three parts of their triad. It was a mighty big pair of shoes to fill for someone with small feet.
“Don’t move, Lucius, I’ll get some help for you.” Severus yanked his robe and mask off, then stalked away to call for Poppy Pomfrey to tend to her newest patient. The portkey had delivered them to a safe room in the hospital wing so that no student, if there happened to be any in need of medical care, would see their injured Potions Master returning from a revel beaten within an inch of his life. “I will return to my rooms to collect the Crucio potion. He was held under it for several minutes.”
“Interesting thoughts,” he murmured. “But why do you need my help? Write to your little friend at
know how to change a nappy and gas It and swaddle and everything else! So why don’t you just go away!”
“The first three months I thought about turning you in, but I didn’t. I couldn’t then. I am repaying my life dept to you in this manner: I am not telling the Dark Lord of your spying and therefore am keeping you alive. Do you accept these terms?”
“Thank you Dr. Johansen,” Blaise said, nodding at the now smiling witch. “Dr. Whittier, what do you think?”
“What about Blaise?”
Severus nodded, motioning for the two to precede him into his private office. He turned just before entering the room himself and sneered at his classroom. “Not a word. Get to work on the potion on page 351. I want the base completed by the end of class. Get to it!” The room burst into motion as Severus snapped the door shut behind him. “Where have you two been? How is it that you can be missing for more than half the school year, and then show up fine as you please? What in the bloody hell is going on here?!”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
I don’t own Harry Potter; that’s JK Rowling. As much as I want darkpyroangel06 to look like JK Rowling, it doesn’t. So I don’t own Harry Potter. *sad sigh of defeat* Also, I don’t own the songs mentioned in here. Sad, I know, but still true.
“McGonagall had the robes and pins made to Draco’s specifications. Madam Pomfrey has the rings. Dumbledore took care of the food. I took care of the cake. All that’s left is for you to show up, say your vows, and agree to the wedding. I hope that you did think of some vows?”
Neither were allowed out of Snape’s rooms unless they were using the floo to go to Dumbledore’s office, but they were okay with that. They found plenty to amuse themselves within their room or the main room in their chambers. Even though it was possible, the professors didn’t want Harry and Draco in their own rooms. They felt it was better that they stay with a teacher, Snape preferably. And Snape wanted Draco close by. Just because he and Harry were getting along didn’t mean they liked each other.
“A very diplomatic answer if I ever heard one,” Draco teased. “But thank you. I think I needed to hear that.”
There was silence in the office for a few moments while the five adults looked back and forth between the two Gryffindors. Moody finally cleared his throat and spoke. “You two are too smart for your own good.”
This was dangerous territory. No matter the answer he gave, Severus knew he was about to be Crucio’d. “My Lord, I myself was not made aware of the training. Dumbledore must have done it himself or brought in someone from the outside.”
“Five months?” Ron interrupted. “Five? It’s been just over six. You’ve been stuck in the Forbidden Forest for six months.”
“So we just enter like last time then?” Ron asked.
Over the next several hours, Draco managed a few ice chips and another two contractions. Harry was captivated by the look and feel of Draco’s stomach as the skin rippled and their child beat against the confines of Draco’s belly. He couldn’t help but run his hands over the stretched taut skin as it contracted and stretched. He gave Draco back and feet massages to help with the discomfort there. They walked around the rooms a number of times, sitting on the couch or at the kitchen table or back in the nursery. At one point they stood under the shower spray, warm water cascading over them. Draco said it was helpful, but tiring the stand. He attempted a nap after that.
“Please, call me Theresa.”
okay with it.”
Even as Harry held him close, he let Draco cry and yell and beat him. It didn’t really hurt, until Draco punched his nose.
“Hey!” Ron cried out. “We’ve needed the Map for more than just sneaking about for the fun of it!”
“Are you really that vain, Mr. Malfoy, that you do not even wish to make sure this is your son?”
“No, Harry. I have to do this my way.” He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, his Malfoy mask falling into place. “What is going on, Father?”
“You’ll laugh,” Harry said, looking down. “But when I was still living with my aunt, before I found out about being a wizard and Hogwarts, I got really sick one day and had to stay home from school. My aunt, while she was cleaning, was listening to the radio and this muggle song came on about a bunch of different islands. I can’t remember all of it, but can we go to all the ones I can remember? Just… just to spend a few days at each one?”
“You’re still the same person, Mr. Zabini. Only your name changed.”
pleased with the Malfoy men escaping his grasp. And while Narcissa had never been marked, she was as good as considering her husband had been the Dark Lord’s left-hand man and ‘lover’. She’d been thinking over the position she’d found herself in ever since her husband had defected. She’d never been a diehard believer of the Death Eaters and Voldemort, but she didn’t side with the Light either. She had been hoping to remain neutral. But that was not to be. She’d answered a missive from her sister, Bellatrix, and found herself at the end of Rabastian’s and Rodolphus’ wands.
“Really Albus, you need to make your passwords something the children can’t guess on a whim,” a voice chastised. The students looked up to see the five adults in the room: Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape, and Aurors Shaklebolt and Moody. Minerva continued, “It’s not right that they can just burst in whenever they feel. Not only is it disrespecting your privacy, but what if we had been in the middle of something important? As we were?”
“Lucius! Listen to me! What do you know of Severus?”
“Do you… Do you always let your husband talk to you in such a manner, Mr. Zabini?” Dr. Mitchsens asked.
Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of
“No. But you’re just in time. Harry and I were talking just before Draco was woken and you came in.”
Tears that were in Harry’s eyes began to fall now. “Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.”
Without answering, Harry ran a hand down Draco’s thigh to push his right leg forward. All sex was had on his side, as he couldn’t manage even being on his hands and knees anymore. And while it still bothered Harry, he couldn’t deny his lover what he begged for so prettily.
Ron jumped out of his seat and pulled her close, whispering harshly into her ear, “Calm down, that’s what.” He held her close and tried to comfort her. “Listen, they will find him. Harry isn’t hurt. Everything will be okay. We both know that if anyone could make it out of this situation alive, it would be Harry. He’s come out of worse things before. There’s no way he could face the Dark Lord seven times in his life and live, only to be brought down by something out in those woods. And if it’s Malfoy who’s hurt him, well you can take care of that, can’t you?”
Nothing.
Severus broke out of his staring assessment when Harry moved away from him, taking Draco with him. “I demand that you hand my godson to me this minute,” he growled dangerously. Harry’s eyes only narrowed into a piercing gaze that Severus held for some time. Harry broke it when he looked at the fireplace in the office. He nodded his head at it then looked back to his professor. Severus quickly understood he wanted to floo or firecall someone. “What are you on about, Potter?” His answer came in the form of a look at the unconscious Draco and then another nod to the fireplace. “Poppy!” Severus wasted no more time in retrieving the floo powder. Harry took a step forward, looking at Severus to direct him. “The words are ‘Hogwarts’ Infirmary’, Potter.” Harry shook his head in the negative and then nodded at Severus. “Me? Fine. We’ll discuss this later. Hogwarts’ Infirmary!”
Fresh tears sprang into Harry’s eyes as he threw his arms around Blaise’s shoulders. “Of course, Blaise,” he said. “Of course I will.”
, was there, looking at him, looking to him for guidance and reassurance. He couldn’t be weak; he had to be strong and set the example for his son. He looked at the blonde image of himself... and stopped cold.
do something to upset you so? You don’t even talk to me the one night a week you leave your rooms!” Harry sat back down, knowing he wasn’t going to be able to leave just yet, and began rocking McKay slowly against his shoulder. “Damn it Harry, you’re worrying me! I am concerned for you and McKay. Did I do something wrong? Can I fix whatever it is that’s going on with you right now?”
However, the pair had to return to their beds every night. At first Pomfrey tried to keep them in separate beds, but she always found them sleeping in the same bed when she went to wake them. They remained in the private room with the door locked and warded to prevent unwanted guests from entering. It was a shock when, a week later, Snape offered his guest rooms for their usage. He knew Draco didn’t want to be in the infirmary. And he wanted Draco close by. He had everything he could need at close hand, and what he didn’t he would soon. The only problem was Harry. He didn’t like the boy and the feeling was returned. But he knew that with Draco came Harry, so he swallowed a bit of pride and opened his doors to them both. It was allowed.
Snape sat through it all, not happily of course. But he wanted Draco close by and Harry came with that. When Harry was satisfied that he knew the rooms from top to bottom, left to right, diagonally, three dimensionally, upside down, and every other way, he nodded once to Snape, then stood behind Draco who was on the couch. Draco laughed and tilted his head up for a kiss. Harry obliged and put his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “Thank you, love. Are you satisfied that Severus isn’t going to hurt, maim, or kill me now?” His answer was a small glare, but Draco knew. “I’m sorry Severus, but you must understand. Five months in the Forbidden Forest. Just think about that, and surely you can understand?”

Harry fell backwards, away from the bed Lucius had been laying on. His mouth was open as if he had cried out, but no sound was released. He turned on his side, breathing harshly and panting. When Madam Pomfrey moved to help him, he fended her off. He needed to help Snape. No matter how much he hated these two men, they were everything to Draco. It was vital that he help them, since he was the only one who could. Slowly, he got back to his feet and moved to Snape.
“Yes, Headmaster,” Hermione said, lowering her eyes so as not to cry.
“No, Lucius, you don’t understand. We’re not alone in here. There–”
“Minerva, are you okay?” Dumbledore asked, showing real concern for one of his professors.
“Professor, sir, what are Harry and I to do about our seventh year and NEWTs?”
“Paths don’t just disappear, Malfoy.”
“-sweet Merlin, yes!” Draco called out, coming down Harry’s throat. However, the orgasm made Draco wake up. It took him a moment to realize that there was a lack of warm, sticky come all over his boxer briefs and bits. Still slightly groggy, he lifted the blanket to find the answer to the lack of stickiness and was greeted with the sight of his lover and husband’s heads between his legs. “Oh Merlin, that has got to be the best way to wake me up ever, Babe. Come up here so I can kiss you good morning.”
McGonagall had gone to Madam Malkins Robes for All Occasions and had the wedding robes commissioned. Since they weren’t actual wedding robes, she didn’t raise too much suspicion in her dealings. Draco looked them over when she returned and praised her for her success in obtaining exactly what he wanted. Tradition stated that the bride would wear her hair down a loose on her wedding day. Well, neither Harry nor Draco were female, but they did have long hair. They had been in the Forbidden Forest for five months without a haircut. Since then, it had been trimmed but not cut. Draco thought they would wear their hair loosely pulled back for the ceremony, and had hair clips commissioned to match their robes. McGonagall got those as well, and they were perfect.
“Mr. Potter, Madam Pomfrey has asked me to deliver these potions for the two of you. These two are simple nutrition potions. Both of you are to take one drop before every meal, three meals a day. And as many healthy snacks for Draco as he wants. Just remember the potion. This one is to heal anything that may remain unhealed within your organs; this one for your bones. Now then, this one is for you alone, Mr. Potter. Since you are now mute, this potion will strengthen your other senses just a little bit more.”
“Harry wants to tell Weasley and Granger about us. That we’re okay, that we’re together, that we’re having a baby, that he’s blind and mute. I don’t know if I can do that. Tell them about him, fine. But me? I’m not friends with them, I don’t know them. I don’t really want to know them to tell the truth. And what if they hate Harry because he and I are together and having a baby and don’t want anything to do with him anymore? I couldn’t handle being the cause of that.”
I want Ginny’s guy
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Harry nodded once and then touched the fingertips of his right hand to his forehead, the bridge of his nose, and then his chin.
“Yes. We do,” Blaise answered. “Well, we’re off. I brought our bags and a portkey with us so off we go.”
“I was afraid of that. I can take care of it, but it may take a lot of time. What about you? Is there anything that needs to be looked at right now?”
When it started getting harder to see Draco, Harry ran after him. “We shouldn’t separate,” he offered as an explanation when he caught up. They walked, heading out the way they came. Except that after ten minutes they weren’t at the edge of the forest. “Surely we weren’t that far in?” he asked.
Harry nodded his head as Blaise led him over to sit on a bar stool with him and Theresa. “Blaise had mentioned wanting to stay here, permanently. I asked if he had said anything to you about this, since it would be a major decision in both your lives. I know you’d said before that you would like to stay here for good, but sometimes you change your thoughts. I suggested he ask you again before he floo-called his parents,” Theresa explained.
Draco sighed, closed his eyes, and began to drift off. Although he wanted more time with his lover, his Harry, his husband, it was past midnight. He’d been awake all day, he was stressed, he was tired, he was pregnant, and he was thoroughly shagged.
“You think I’m a bad parent?!” Draco screeched one time, as he was instructing Missy to rearrange the furniture and to recolor it cream. “You think I don’t know what my baby needs?! What, do you think I’ll hurt It? You probably think I’m completely inept too, huh? That I don’t know how to change a nappy or make a bottle. Well guess what, Mr. Savior of the Wizarding World, I
Shortly after falling asleep, Snape returned from dinner in the Great Hall. “Two! Two cauldrons in the same class! Not even a first-year class, but a
“Come along Potter.” They walked to the doors leading to the hallway outside where McGonagall was waiting. “Minerva,” he greeted. “Potter is all yours.” He closed the door behind the Gryffindors.
“And what an improvement it would have been too. Shame.” Draco began to walk forward.
“But if everyone thinks you proposed to me, they’re going to wonder why I’m wearing a ring and you’re not.”
Harry shrugged again, then pointed at Snape.
“You fiend!” Draco cried, playfully slapping Harry’s shoulder. “You know Severus is going to have an aneurism.”
“Quickly, Poppy, through the floo. Emergency network.”
“What?! Why wasss he taken from hisss place?”
Lucius Malfoy was pleading for his son’s life now. Severus was thrown off kilter for a few moments. Then, with a sneer and straightening of his back, Severus said, “I would if I could, Lucius, but I can’t do that.”
Draco was sat on the edge of the bed while Harry stood between his legs as much as the pregnant belly would allow. Draco’s hands began removing Harry’s clothes. Harry’s hand moved down to Draco’s prick and began to slowly massage the leaking appendage. Draco cried out. He was so hard and wanted his husband so badly. He tried to undo Harry’s jeans faster, but his fingers kept fumbling. He growled into their kiss in frustration.
