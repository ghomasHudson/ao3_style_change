“Mr Malfoy,” said Professor Lupin. “Well done! It took you a little bit longer than everyone else, especially the Boggart, but you’ll receive full marks for being so cautious and patient.”
“So we’ll get to spend the rest of the day drooling over new books,” said Draco, sarcastically. “What fun that will be.”
He glanced back towards the boy, studying him, and frowned when he noticed a small tabby kitten curled up behind his legs. He had no idea the boy had a cat. It really should have been something they discussed, seeing as he had not explained that he had a large snake that would probably eat the cat, but it was still the sheer principle of a friendship to talk about pets, not that Nagini would ever consider herself one.
Neville awoke with a whimper, his body jerking roughly as he felt large hands pull him onto the seat. His eyes instantly shifted towards Hermione and Ron, who both looked pale and slightly concerned.
It was Harry’s start of a potent spell-chain, one that people would soon fear. The wand movements from the first curse followed neatly into the jab from the latter. He was an offensive dueller, not a defensive one like Longbottom, despite the boy throwing the first spell.
“We cannot get Harry Potter the way I want to, the Ministry cancelling the Triwizard cup was my flawless plan, and with it we couldn’t get Harry Potter to join it and get him that way. So now, we take something he loves and we draw him to us.” Voldemort threw his head back and cackled as evilly as he could. It was a terrific plan, and to think he only came up with it because Harry would throw himself in front of a killing curse to protect things he loves.
“Yes, Ron isn’t a homophobe, I know this because he told me that he has a few gay friends, in fact Ginny is bisexual, and so I doubt he would even say it.”
Even a few rumours came up that Salazar the Bunny was really Salazar and that he was an Animagus. It soon joined the Giant Squid being Godric rumour and it soon spiralled from there.
Ron, Neville, Dean and Seamus all took turns watching over Harry, who grew restless in his sleep, he woke up a few times but fell back asleep after nearly tripping over his own feet. The Fat Lady was getting furious when Snape and Draco kept on insisting to come in, most of the Gryffindors had to laugh at her and her ways, but they helped them in regardless, knowing it was for Harry and not any reasons that would hurt them.
“Told you he’d favour the Gryffindors,” said Harry as he followed the professor towards the nearby clearing. “Looks like we’re going to the Forbidden Forest…”
It had hardly been a day he attended the school and he was already popular there, especially the talk about the snake and how he threatened to let a girl die. Of course the principle denied it all and stated that it never happened and that it would be wise to forget or else people could get in trouble. Naturally, no snake was ever seen on the grounds again and the rumour was soon quenched, at least according to the principle.
“Liza, why don’t yer go and spot if mum or dad needs any ‘elp, isit?” said Mike, smiling. “I’ll speak ter this boy and join yer soon. Tell them not ter panic, right, I’m sure they’re ‘ave a look at us.”
Harry paused and glanced around, looking at the happenings of the scene in front of him. He caught sight of Longbottom, standing in the middle of the room, near the Mirror of Erised, which apparently found its new home down here. He made his way across the stone floor, stepping lightly and keeping his eyes directly on the professor and Longbottom, making sure none of them noticed him. He didn’t have long, he needed to secure the Stone and then get out of here as soon as possible, perhaps he could figure out a way to create a fake Stone and make it look like it was destroyed or perhaps he could destroy the mirror.
Harry snorted as he lifted his head, once more, towards the professors. He was watching them closely, looking for any small sign that something was amiss. Most of them appeared glad for the change, knowing duelling would cause students to study more, which is what they wanted. He had a small feeling in the pit of his stomach that the entire event would be changed once more mere days before it actually started, which would cause a massive wave of excitement and last-minute studying.
“You took the owl that was meant for the Boy Who Lived?” said Harry, his eyes slightly wide. “That’s so wicked. You deserve a medal for that. You’re amazing.”
“Oh, it’s not for me,” said Harry, laughing softly as he took a step, moving towards the old woman. “It’s for a friend of mine – we had a falling out and aren’t on speaking terms. I want to get him a gift that expresses how sorry I am by infuriating him and making him mad.”
“Magic is tied to the soul, Draco, which despite claims, actually exists. When the soul departs, so does all the magic that it left behind. We could say that magic comes from the soul and –”
“Justice?” repeated Harry, scoffing. “What justice? It’s hardly my fault that all the professors that we have had in the previous few years have all been
. Their patterns don’t matter. Look – the ones your golem ripped in half are still moving. It was a waste of time… just should have flooded them with fire.”
Professor Binns cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk snapping and continued. “In September of that year, a sub-committee of Sardinian sorcerers –” he stuttered to a halt. Hermione’s hand was waving in the air again. “Miss. Grant?”
“I wouldn’t say it would be cliché,” said James. “No trench coats, fedoras, and Italian accents. In fact, I wouldn’t even say they are a mafia because they do nothing like that. They’re simply a faction that controls the area. Mr Nocturne, the owner of Knockturn Alley, is actually quite heavily against murder and will often turn over murders for the sake of it. He’s fair, I’ll give him that. But, his goal was to create a place where people wouldn’t be condemned due to a mistake in their past.”
“I suggest keeping your head down and travelling in groups,” said Harry. “If someone or something is attacking students, I doubt it would attack groups and seeing as both Mrs. Norris and Creeves were supposedly alone when attacked, it makes sense. Leave the heroics to the Gryffindors. I see no shame in fleeing if it’ll keep you alive.”
“His personality traits will simply just increase,” said Severus. “I will explain it later with a graph and more in-depth data, which you should expect of me by now, but it will not change him too much, assuming I get to it instantly and we do not leave it too long. I am positive he is not dabbling in dark magic, so he should be fine.”
Harry followed, leaving Neville behind and went back to bed, his thoughts still focused on that mirror.
Bellatrix cackled, “so close, almost had the Dark Lord here, luck follows you doesn’t it, Half-Blood?”
Mopsy had a shine to her eyes, she wiped them on her bright pink pillowcase and sniffed as she pulled out things to help cook. “Mopsy will be making Little Masters food, Mopsy loves serving Little Master.”
“Professor,” said Harry, speaking softly as he stood. “I thought it would be… prudent to first teach the students about the duel and how
“She was possessed, by the Dark Lord,” whispered Harry. It was useless to say ‘Voldemort’ in here, half the common room seemed to have sensitive ears to that name and instantly chimed in, the same with ‘You-Know-Who’. “That was how I was caught. I dodged the first Stunning Spell, but the second one hit home before I had even turned to face her.”
“Hm, I started last year. This is my second year here,” said Dudley as he pushed open the door to the classroom. “It’s a pretty good school, if I have to admit. Dad came here as well, he goes on and on about it being the
Dumbledore stroked his beard as he used a spell to push aside a rather sharp looking branch. “Mr. Potter isn’t like other students,” he said, unsure of how he should actually continue. “Do you remember Tom Riddle from last year?”
“Myth,” said Harry, muttering. “It hasn’t been taught in over a century because you no longer have to paint the portraits, you can just use a camera. Stop gossiping.”
“No need to be sarcastic,” said Nott. “You’re a Potter in Slytherin, Quidditch Captain, friends with a Malfoy, and top of the classes. People are going to listen to you, even if you rambled and talked nonsense. Think about Dumbledore.”
“Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions,” said Harry, pointing at the store. “I just need socks and trousers. I’ll be in and out within two minutes.”
this. What he doesn’t know is how to cope with the fact he accidentally killed someone and has no one there to help and guide him.”
?” hissed Harry in a questioning matter, he glanced at the snake who tried to make herself look adorable, of all things.
Draco stepped over Nagini, making sure not to step on her, and fled from the tapestry, scowling at the Gryffindor as he left. He knew that Harry would probably scowl and verbally abuse the Gryffindor, maybe even throw a minor hex at him and then would retreat towards the library. He wasn’t surprised when he heard a scream, the Gryffindor deserved it.
“Thanks I guess.” Hermione didn’t really care where he was going, she knocked on the door and waited.
She took pride in being able to treat them all equally, despite wishing she could just set them free and do it all herself, as that’s what she was accustomed to. There was a few that stared at her funny when she entered the basement, mainly her son’s house-elf that came around to help Visy out as much as she could.
“All right, tell her I’m on my way, Harry we will fix the wards after some tea and rest.” Lucius gave Draco a stern nod and left.
He managed to make it out of the small tented area with all limbs attached, no injuries, and no one really spotting him, despite the fact he flew directly over a small campfire and scattered the embers everywhere. He had easily ignored the shouts, mutters of wind picking up, and easily lifted himself into the sky, seeing the silhouette of six quite large men hovering in the sky on brooms. He slowly approached, knowing the saw him, and decided to hover on the side, trying not to interrupt their conversation in their mother tongue.
“Of course, else people’d put their enemies in there to see them suffer,” said Harry. “I think you’re right, though. The Age Line isn’t related to the Goblet at all…”
She was tempted to tell Harry to wave bye to the house, but at that moment it felt so stupid when she was going to be running for her life any moment.
It was a mess of emotions mixed with power mixed with a strong desire to better himself. It was, as everyone predicted, a very astonishing period.
“When I call out your name, you will sit on the stool and put on the Sorting Hat,” said Professor McGonagall, looking directly at the first-years. “When the Sorting Hat announces your house, you will go and sit at the appropriate table.”
Harry listened carefully once more as the conversation between them stayed on the same subject, just different people. Petunia kept ranting about this number seven person, or people as he leaned, and their freaky unnatural ways. At first he assumed it was because one of them was magical, but apparently he was correct as all he heard was freaky and then the two whispered to the final word, not so vocal with what was probably a swear.
“Did you honestly just ask that question Gin? You know Molly will be alright, you could throw anything at her and she would prevail and come out on top, and then make you clean up the mess!” Harry chuckled, hoping the cause wasn’t spoiled before they got there; after all, it needs to be a surprise.
Because this was Hogwarts and Neville Longbottom was attending, nothing was ever as simple as batting it away and the issue would vanish. Nope. Not at all.
He stepped into the room slowly, closing the creaking door behind him as he tapped his chin, wondering how long it will take before Myrtle loses it and wails at him for being in here. He sniffed at the sheer thought and began to investigate the room, questioning in his mind why he agreed on becoming a wannabe detective.
“Ten points from Gryffindor,” Snape added, “do you really think I enjoy this, Potter?” Snape smirked at Harry’s facial expression, knowing what was going to come out of Harry’s mouth next.
He missed another step and forced down the scathing remark that was on the tip of his tongue. No matter how much he desired to, he could not lash out at Granger as she was the only person that seemed to have the patience to deal with his constant failure. He decided to block out Granger and whatever asinine thing she was saying, which likely was useless information and would not aid him at all.
“Thanks, you should have just shaken me awake; you shouldn’t have gone to all this trouble for me.” Harry reached for his glasses and gently placed them on his face.
“Williams,” said Harry, looking towards the first-year, who jumped slightly when spoken to. “Want to join us? I know that these two are hardly any decent at conversation, so it’ll just be me, you and Draco.”
He was confused on why it hadn’t been removed by Dumbledore, seeing as it taught Dark Arts, but he realised that the first few chapters were excruciatingly dull and made him want to put the book down and the only reason he didn’t is because he knew at chapter thirty-three, he would learn what he was currently learning.
Neville and Ron walked away, not even daring to look back at their head of house and see what her reaction was. Neither of them could believe that they had just gotten away with lying to Professor McGonagall and without a detention for breaking the new rules that had been implemented. A few Ravenclaws had been caught wandering around alone and lost over seventy house points in total.
He did debate about giving the owl to Longbottom, not as a gift or anything, but he didn’t really want an owl. He disliked gifting gifts, but Draco had only got the thing to see how much he could push his family name around.
nonverbal Tripping Jinx at Auror Tonks. A remarkable accomplishment, all things considered, but you still attacked an Auror.”
“Dishonour,” said Professor Snape. “It could very well be something else, but I am sure that is how Mr Potter sees it and he is simply waiting for Mr Nott to gather his wits and actually duel him.”
Lily smiled at her son the moment that he had stated that he would let it slip. She was proud that her son was mature enough to know when to leave something and when to act on it. She knew that her son had a big mouth and tended to be easily offended, he knew better to than stick his head into a confrontation and harm another person. Her son was a perfectly normal hormonal teenager. He was charming, polite, and had no hidden mental illnesses.
“I’d love the help, but a part of me feels rather stupid for needing help from a first-year,” said Gemma with an awkward sounding laugh, she ducked her head with a sigh afterwards. “I have no idea how you can even do potions, I just don’t understand it.”
Pansy stopped, “he’s going to the Slytherin common room, and it’s where he goes whenever he’s confused or upset.” Pansy panted, “hey, stay here Draco, don’t leave me!”
Draco noticed a letter on his desk; Draco got up to read it, still in his school robes. He plotted revenge for the person who did this, they would pay dearly. Of course his door flung open.
“The words in the lines are well beyond anything I’d have ever thought up,” he said, blinking twice when the Healer abruptly stopped and faced him with a genuine smile. “Who came up with it?”
“While we’re not the descendants of the Gryffindor line, like the Potter line, we’re fairly close,” said Neville.
Leaning against the nearby statue of Salazar, it was shortly after this revelation that everything began to get wild. He watched in amusement as Gilderoy trained his wand on the two Gryffindors.
“I did not mock his dead parents, I simply said they didn’t die for Longbottom to just stand around and let others be punched in the face,” said Harry with an eye roll. “As far as I’m aware, Mrs. Longbottom and my mother were close friends, not Mrs. Longbottom and Mrs. Weasley. You have no idea what you’re talking about. The Longbottom’s were Aurors, both of them.”
bloodline,” said Atieno, shaking his head. “Do you really think they would taint it with magical blood?”
Christmas was fast approaching, the suddenness of the snow took most students by surprise, by the time that mid-December had crawled around the Black Lake was practically frozen solid and the grounds were coated in a thick layer of snow that punished anyone who dared venture out without adequate clothing and a thick layer of Warming Charms. The corridors were rather draughty and ice tended to linger in the air as the coldness pounded on the glass windows, causing them to rattle slightly under the sheer force of the icy wind.
“Ah,” said Draco with a small shrug. “I’m amazed you even managed to dress yourself without me being there.”
Harry sighed and leant back, looking at his ideas with a soft glare. “How’s this?” he asked, thrusting the parchment towards Draco. “I think it’ll work out good and set us both up for the future.”
Harry watched Draco’s retreating back as if the world had suddenly fallen into slow motion. He felt a sense of dread as he twisted towards the grinning fourth-year Gryffindor, intent on making the boy suffer for causing him to lose his only real friend. He wasn’t sure what happened, but he remembered whipping out his wand and barking out the first spell on the tip of his tongue, which was a beginner Dark Arts curse, one that would cause moderate suffering until the victim was relieved from it. It was a spell that Riddle had taught him. Borderline Dark Arts, at the most.
“Now I understand why people say Professor Potter is the best Professor, he seems to enjoy what he does and is fair. He’s taken methods Snape uses and then alters them into what he would like.” Blaise whispered to Draco.
Lily made an acknowledging sound, not really caring what was said as she was far too busy pointing out things to her son.
Dumbledore leant down and rested a hand on Neville’s shoulder. “I do not believe that people are born evil, Neville. I do believe that events and actions can change a person, whether for the better or the worse.”
“Very latest model. Only came out last month,” said Marcus carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. “I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount.”
What really tipped the scale was when he learned that Vaisey had made the balloons stuck to his wrist for six hours.
A cut appeared across Harry’s chest, he screamed as loud as he could as blood poured from the wound.
“Stop!” said Salazar, commanding the mannequins to halt their attacks. “Defending against the Disarming Charm without casting a spell is a great way to bait your opponent into thinking they have won. Before we continue, I would like you to list three things that this also aids you with.”
He sat at the desk, his fingers drumming across the rich mahogany wood, debating on what he should do now, seeing as he had no other leads regarding the black rose. He was highly curious about the plant ever since he had seen it mentioned in a Muggle book. He disregarded the fact that it was a Muggle who had a theory on it, seeing as Muggles did a lot of guesswork on magical things and got them right most of the time. Muggles had better technology and better equipment to find this stuff out.
He had proposed that they forgo defence and simply attack, which would give them the upper hand when dealing with creatures with poor intelligence. Blitz them before they can coordinate and attack. It was a sound plan, one most people would use over creating a small defensible area and then buckling down.
Harry once again zoned Dumbledore out and was lost in his thoughts and mindlessly pushing his food around. He heard people gasp and he just ignored it. Harry turned to look at Draco and saw him gaping at him, honestly he wished he had a camera as Draco would never leave his mouth open like that, Harry soon enough realized everyone in the Great Hall was staring at him, it made him feel nauseous, and to be completely honest, Harry hated any attention he got, sadly no one else realized that.
“Wonder how long Longbottom’s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?” said Draco, kicking the back of Ron’s seat.
Each boy nodded and quickly began to chatter, except Crabbe and Goyle, among themselves and went to find their room.
Harry’s reply was cut short by a harsh knock on the door. He swivelled around and was surprised to see Professor Snape standing there.
Harry followed the girl with a slightly uneasy smile. It didn’t take a genius to realize that everyone was watching the first-year being escorted from the Great Hall by a Prefect.
“I’m hardly ever wrong, in fact, I’d say that I’m the smartest person in this house currently, most likely the smartest person ever set foot in this house,” said Harry with a smile. “I mean, what school do you go to?”
, especially not under such dire circumstances where your country should be the one to aid you. It makes no sense at all.”
to know if someone sneezed. Not every Auror is able to cast a Patronus, let alone use Dumbledore’s method of communicating, but those that can’t were meant to be able to let me know in other, less obvious ways.”
Harry wanted to spin around and curse at the motherly house-elf for being able to track him down, despite his almost successful attempts at escaping both the house-elves and the occupants of Malfoy Manor. He didn’t bat an eyelash when a small table, lined with a soft tablecloth, appeared from nowhere, a chair following soon after. He slumped into the seat, eyeing the wooden spoon that Mopsy was waving around in a threatening manner. “I’ll eat,” he said, watching in amusement as his house-elf vanished from sight with a small bow.
“It is irrelevant,” said Atieno. “I hardly doubt you would care if I was fifteen or five thousand. I knew from asking around that you were fond of taking in errant creatures and would aid me for as long as I required it. I
There were only four people that he truly cared about, everyone else was irrelevant and could all go to Gryffindor for all he cared. Although, playing ‘guess the House’ is a good way to pass the time, it was far too exhausting of a day to even bother.
The small room was full of sleeping portraits, all of which appeared to be protecting something. He walked forward and stood in front of a window, which had a view into a small grassy area with a large tree and some purple plants. He turned around and studied the only portrait that seemed to be awake and active.
Professor Sprout stood in the centre of the room, a trestle bench was just behind her. Around forty pairs of different-coloured earmuffs were lying on the bench, just to the right of the room. “We’ll be re-potting Mandrakes today,” she said easily, addressing the large mass of students. “Now, who can tell me what the properties of the Mandrake are?”
“Take this,” sneered Bellatrix, slipping a book over Harry’s hand and pretty much threw it into the Mudblood’s hands. “It’s a book on Occlumency, something you must start learning. Dumbledore is a Legilimens and he seeing this little meeting will break the vow and then you’ll lose your son before you’ll even see him grow up.”
Hermione sent Neville a look as she watched Ronald dig around in his pockets for Merlin knows what. “I believe you’d be better off going to Professor McGonagall.”
“I didn’t even list the one that would make your eyes burn our or the one that would cause you to org –”
“The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Philosopher’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal,” said Harry as if he had been reading directly from the book. He paused and wondered why he suddenly knew everything that he had read before about Nicolas Flamel, he had read about the man in one of his more boring nights studying.
“I see you’ve been neglecting your English lessons, Viktor,” said Clara, giggling. “That whole sentence was quite awful. You’re still stopping in random places.”
“It’s ‘cos Dumbledore is afraid that anything related to duelling is cursed,” said Harry. “It may fall under the D-A-D-A. He doesn’t want someone to get gravely hurt because the ‘curse’ kicked in and decided that enough was enough.”
“Most likely because that name, whether it’s his proper name or not, is reserved for only his mother,” said Cedric, caving in and sitting on a tree trunk. “Sort of like how only your mother may call you Ernest.”
He stared at his hands and then twisted to the sword, which was still clanging from the power that he had thrown it at the ground in shock. He noted that Riddle had the same look on his face. “What the hell?”
“Please, just call me Bernard,” said Bernard. “And, of course! Tend to your son! I’ve got one about the same age. I’ll be just here.”
He glanced at the clock and realized he had twenty minutes until it was three, talk about cutting it close. He pushed off the bed and fastened his cloak tightly round his person and made his way from the first-year boys’ dormitory and into the Slytherin common room, glancing at Tracey and Pansy briefly before walking from the room. He weaved around the few students that were lurking in the corridor and of course the stray Gryffindors who seemed to take pride and stalking the entrance to the headmaster’s office. The gargoyle moved aside the instant he stepped in front of the thing, he began to climb the stairs with a scowl on his face.
Harry gave the Golden Trio an amused expression which they all missed, sadly. He shifted the book into view, hoping one of them would spot it and then he could deny them the book they were after for some reason. He did wonder why they wanted a book on alchemy, after all, he had only picked it up by mistake, he was about to put it back when he heard that they were after it, he decided not to. He continued to watch as the trio kept looking for the book he had, all three of them refused to ask him about the book, of course that would make it way too easy for him.
“Yes, Draco, I heard you,” said Harry, his index finger gently tapping against his chin. “Perhaps a spell that could automatically translate words into another language. That would be useful and I wouldn’t need to bother with this.”
“That’s nonsense,” said Harry as he walked towards the sink. “It’s just another thing people made up to deter said people from here. People are still making Myrtle out to be another Bloody Baron.”
“I have talent. What does Longbottom have? An over exaggerated story about how he defeated a Dark Lord. Anyone who believes it is idiotic and a follower, not a leader.”
,” snapped Harry. “Fine – you want it how you Gryffindors do things? Brash? Thoughtless? I can do that!”
“I don’t have my fingers in everything,” said Harry bitterly. “I made sure my friends were in a position where they could do what they enjoyed without the waiting that would normally happen.”
“Err,” muttered Harry, peaking his head into the room. He wasn’t really sure on why Weasley was so sentimental or proud about his bedroom. “Congratulations?”
Harry waited and waited, listening to the soft sounds of rustling clothes and the mutterings of an irate boy and the ruined clothes that he now had due to creases. It was a few more seconds of rustling and muttering when he heard his name and nothing else. He spun around, ready to chastise Draco for taking so long in getting dressed as it wasn’t rocket science, not that Draco would know what that was.
“They despise each other,” said Draco, turning to Astoria Greengrass. He spoke loudly so that everyone could hear, making sure they knew why Harry hadn’t attacked. “This could be a very, very long duel.”
He realised, almost instantly, that his change from aggression to defensive was a good when one his opponent also changed their stance, quicker than he anticipated. He was hoping the stance change would throw Asahi off his guard and would allow him a quick strike from a defensive stance, something most people wouldn’t even think of.
He frowned, knowing that if Hogwarts actually had an education that turned out knowledgeable wizards, this entire situation would have been avoided as he would have known how to cast, control, and counter battle magic. Instead, the entire country demanded that all witches and wizards learn spells that serve no purpose at all. The Levitating Charm was a useless spell, just like almost every other spell that was taught to the masses.
“It’s relevant,” said Harry. “Let’s just assume that one of the guards mentioned to their wife or husband that they were finally off shift and that, well, someone else was going to take over, and someone heard that
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares which Neville, Ron and Hermione took.
Harry waved his wand, mumbling the Unlocking Charm, and opened the door with a flamboyant gesture. “That was hardly hard at all,” he said. “If you want some credit for our adventure you better pick up your slack and do something.”
“Are you stupid?” said Harry, angrily pushing his foot into his shoe. He kicked the floor, trying to make it fit on right. “Scratch that, you are. I’m not gonna shower, then put on clean clothes, and then go outside and walk through a forest while Nagini hunts. God, some people…”
“You have such a way with winning people over, don’t you?” said Ron. “However, you didn’t answer what I asked.”
“This one doesn’t look too happy, Gred,” said George, peering towards his twin brother and the second-year Slytherin. “He sorta looks like Ron does when we get him with a very good and well-placed prank that makes him look like a right fool.”
Harry had just added his bat spleen, he glanced over his potion and smiled at how perfect it was, not that this potion was considered to be hard to brew, only morons, like Neville, would fail to make it properly. He was just about to pick up his stirring rod when he caught something out of the corner of his eye. It was his first lesson, really. When brewing, keep your eye on the potion, but as well as your surroundings. What looked like a firework flew towards his potion, he raised a lid that he kept nearby and placed it over his potion.
The rain continued to slam harshly against the stained-glass of the castle harshly, causing a few students to glance up with a curious expression. A howl of wind caused a fair amount of corridors to fill with droplets of water and even some leaves that couldn’t stay onto their respective trees. It hadn’t even been raining for five hours and people were already sniffing colds away. Perhaps that explained Professor Snape’s foul mood, having to brew hundreds of potions that would help fix the students and their awful colds.
The Slytherin team finished their jogging with little to no complaints, unless you were hit by Harry Potter with a Stinging Hex for going to slow or for talking instead of running. Eventually they found themselves at the Slytherin changing rooms, which contained their clothes and showers that everyone seemed to instantly rush for.
,” said Harry. “To me, it hardly appears like the Ministry cares about who did and didn’t get tickets. The only thing they care about is their image and the amount of money they’re making. It wasn’t just the rich families in the United Kingdom that mass purchased tickets, it was wealthy families across the globe. Nothing will top this event, and the Ministry wanted to make sure they profited from it.”
“I’m sure you’re aware, but this year has been very out of place and disorganized, which ruins every plan I have set. We will start with the Triwizard Tournament, which they announced and then proceeded to cancel a few days later, very cruel of them if I must say so.” Dumbledore paused and waited for the groans in the room to silence. “And then of course the Quidditch World Cup was placed on hold, causing more panic and anger, but today that stops. I have received some good news, great news even about it. The Quidditch World Cup is starting, of course it’s estimated that the final will be during the Christmas time, most likely a few days after, just before school starts again.” The room erupted with cheers, whistling and eager excitement, they couldn’t have both, but one was better than none.
“Take a seat Lucius, theirs a few things I wish to discuss.” Voldemort sat down and glanced at Lucius. “As you know, I’m not exactly fully human yet; thankfully I can still do some human interactions. Enough of that though, how is Draco?”
Harry nodded slowly, knowing that Beauxbatons had a much smaller library, one that was catered to more education and elegance rather than a broader subject. Hogwarts did, after all, have the largest library out of any magical school. It was a bragging right, one that was often used. He smiled and waved as the two boys were introduced, his mind jolting as he heard their names. He was expecting something more French than Jacob and Nicolas. He was expecting something similar to Marceau or Pierre. He was certain that Jacob was not a French name. He was
Harry pushed open the door to the boys’ toilets and immediately did a double take. It was just like the corridors in the sense that the entire roof was just one big light. The wall that held the door was charmed to be like a one-one mirror. They could see out and were able to watch as the Prefect leant against the wall, presumably waiting for them.
Harry slowly shook his head, “such foul language Draco, what would Narcissa say? I should owl her this moment.”
“I can sell this for forty Sickles at the Ministry and we’ll make thirty Sickles profit!” said Draco. “Of course, this was your plan all along. Make me annoyed and then show me that I can use it to turn a profit! How infuriating of you. Just wait until I tell father about this… this
Ron scoffed. “The entrance is in the girls’ bathroom,” he stated. “I doubt they care whether they slide down or not.”
“Seamus and a second year, I cannot remember his name.” Oliver went red, despite whispering the last few words, people heard.
Harry drooled on his mother’s top and continued to babble complete nonsense, even when he was placed on the floor. He stood, wobbling, and began to take a few steps towards the nearby sofa. He fell over and giggled aimlessly, once again repeating the process from the start.
“I doubt a second year could tamper with a Bludger, plus they’ve been locked in Madam Hooch’s office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then,” said Wood anxiously, as Potter’s words once more rang through his mind. “I think Potter is behind it, but we have no proof.”
“You drink that,” said Neville. “No, listen – get back and get Ron – grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy – go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him really.”
“Because I felt bad for keeping you in the dark constantly,” said Harry, deflating. “If I could have at least learned where it came from, then I may have been able to explain it better, but I’ve been one since I was younger. My first words were in Parseltongue. Perhaps I got the ability because I desperately wanted to talk to Nagini or because of some other reason.”
“Ooh! Am I hearing a debate about the four founders?” squeaked Professor Flitwick, who had just weaved by the small group and stood next to Professor McGonagall. “It’s been so many years since someone had started a nice debate about the deeds and things the founders had done in their age! Far too many simply reference
Harry glanced down, “Oh my.” Harry flashed red, “I was sure I put on my own robes, I must have grabbed Draco’s by accident.”
“Well done, my boy,” said Dumbledore as he leant down and studied them intently. “Whatever came by had light steps.”
Harry grinned. “Teach him how to fly,” he called out. “He’s unsure on how to actually fly. He can hover great, but not fly.”
“Aspiring champions will have twenty-four hours to put their names forward. Tomorrow night, Hallowe’en, the Goblet will return three pieces of parchment with those that it deemed worthy to represent their respective schools.”
Harry pondered what the winged horses could be for a solid minute. He knew that the creature that fit the description would be a Thestral, which were not exactly territorial and never left the Forbidden Forest, unless they were directed by a human to do so. Of course, there was the fact that Nagini had to reason to fear a Thestral as they did not care about any other creature being in their domain and would happily just ignore it.
“He planned this,” said Harry. “He set us up. He wanted us to get caught or injured. We’d both get into a lot of trouble for this and that was his goal.”
“Right the one who is obsessed with having pure-blood and harasses everyone with it,” said Harry. “So it wouldn’t surprise me if the password was something to do with pure-blood.”
Harry listened as the girl huffed, throwing around things and then finally dug into Longbottom’s trunk, the Gryffindor in that girl was so obvious that she couldn’t pass off as anything else. He winced as books were thrown, landing harshly on the ground, pages had rips and a few pages on a book came out. He wanted to fix the book, just seeing them in that condition was agitating him. He watched calmly as the girl tore from the room, and not even three minutes later Finnigan came in and gasped at the sight of the room.
“You actually think I’ll lose? Between Hermione and you I’ll have no ego left. Oh and I almost forgot, when I win I want to tell you something.” Harry waved off and walked onto the Quidditch pitch.
“Harry Potter,” said Fleur, speaking as slowly as possible, without it becoming awkward, to keep her French accent under wraps. “The Champion for Hogwarts. I must admit, I was – we were shocked when you waved us over, even more so when you’re doing research on the Tournament. Je dis ça, je dis rien.”
“I’m not going to Hogsmeade this year,” said Neville, his shoulders slumped. “My Gran said that it was best if I avoided leaving the school grounds this year, even more so with Pettigrew on the loose. James almost signed it after convincing Gran that keeping me locked in the castle isn’t good for my health, but Lily put a stop to it.”
James sat quietly for a moment, unsure of how he should start this. “When a boy turns into a young man, he soon discovers that his body is changing and the boy wishes to explore his new body. Skipping over a few things that you already know. Harry, our son, is most likely doing the deed, Lils.”
Neville, Ron and Hermione didn’t speak a word to each other until they had come to a halt in the Entrance Hall, which seemed rather cold comacompared to the warmth on the grounds. The three of them shared and a look and Neville shook his head, letting out a sigh. “We’ve got to find Dumbledore,” he said quietly. “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak – it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?”
“The Goblet of Fire will announce its decision in twenty minutes,” said Dumbledore. “Until then, there are a few more things that need to be said. For each underage person that was caught trying to put their name into the Goblet, a deduction of fifty house points will be made. There were seven people from Gryffindor, three from Hufflepuff, six from Ravenclaw, and five from Slytherin. If my memory serves correctly, that means that each house is now at zero points.”
Many students, despite their rampant love for the sport, were deciding whether they should give the upcoming Quidditch game a pass, knowing that the conditions would be almost unbearable.
“Harry!” said James in horror, glancing at his son with a slightly disapproving look. “We raised you better than that! You know that you shouldn’t use your wealth as a weapon against others. You could have all the Galleons in Gringotts and you still couldn’t buy the love that the Weasley family have. I can assume that Lucius and Narcissa would agree to some extent with what you’re saying, but your mother and I certainly don’t.”
“Do you think it will continue to study us?” said Cornelius, curious. “We could easily stall it by keeping it confused.”
Harry wanted to roll his eyes at the demanding tone, but simply smiled and made his way towards Professor McGonagall, who seemed to already be stressed. He stood alongside Fleur, who was staring at him with an unknown expression, as they listened to the professor explain the Yule Ball and a few core rules that they as the champions must follow impeccably. He wanted to laugh when she claimed that their bedtime, as if they were small children, was midnight and no later.
Draco woke up rather late, he had around twelve minutes to wake up and get ready for the day, he was able to get dressed, brush his teeth but had no time to shower. Draco cursed and sued the muggle deodorant his mother sent him as punishment for getting into a fight, he wondered if she was told his father planned it.
“Not as far as someone would think,” said Lily, speaking before her husband could. “The magical population have done more extreme things, like being able to regrow bones within a single night. Muggles are still quite advanced, but solely in the basics.”
Something wasn’t lost on Harry, though. Salazar had a basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, a thousand years old. That’s what was attacking students. The basilisk was – is – attacking student son the orders of Tom Riddle and he couldn’t have that. If the basilisk was caught… he just couldn’t fathom what would happen to such a magnificent creature.
Neville rubbed his eyes and poked his head from the curtain, “can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep.” Neville sighed and pulled his head back in.
Severus knew that look all too well, “almost, it was a ritual, plus a few custom-made spells that were never recorded; in itself it’s powerful, not dark but borderline. But I honestly cannot say, Harry. It could be dark by today’s standards, but don’t degrade yourself over it. I assume you already know the only Potters to not be in Slytherin are your father and you.”
Ron and Dean came in moments later, witnessing Neville and Seamus holding up sheets. Dean’s eyes looked at the room and then he swore rather loudly, not even bothering to act like it was an accident. “What happened, Neville?”
Harry let out a faint giggle, which made Draco smile. Harry placed his finger on Draco’s lip, “I read that most house-elves speak English poorly, why do yours speak proper English?”
Ginny twisted around, ready to lash out at Potter, until she saw the familiar black diary in the boy’s hands. She stared at him a moment before her hand clenched and she glared. She had asked Riddle why she kept misplacing the book, only to find it in random places and he had said that it could be why her memory was going bad and she was simply forgetting more than she realised. “That’s mind.”
“I think Harry just likes to fight.” Draco pushed off the robes and stopped when he saw how creased their robes were getting.
“Oh, Harry, dear, I didn’t see you there,” said Mrs. Weasley, edging forwards slightly. “I suppose you’ve heard our exciting news?”
Draco pursed his lips and bit his cheek to not laugh. “Let’s just say that Quirrell will be better than the professor this year.”
“I’ve always helped with the garden, Harry,” said Draco. “Just not why you’re around as I assumed you’d tease me for it.”
“I realise that this is not what you wanted when I said I would be tutoring you in the Dark Arts,” said Salazar, dismissing the mannequins with a soft remark. “It is impossible to just pick up a book, read a few lines, and then be proficient in the Dark Arts, even if you are talented and an innate genius. The descent is slow and can be unbearable, but that is just how it is.”
“Draco is doing perfectly… better than I expected. However, are these feelings genuine? It appears he is having a grand time with Harry.” Voldemort placed the letter down and directed his focus to Lucius, “if Draco can make him realize the Slytherin ways, Harry could potentially become an ally and a powerful one at that.” Voldemort finally looked away, but kept his tone. “I need your son to keep doing this, to keep trying to pry into Harry’s heart,” He waved his hand and Lucius stood straight. “If you can do this, the Malfoy family will forever go down in history as a great family, and you’ll have countless fame and riches. Your son could even be my very own prodigy!” Voldemort cackled, Lucius beamed with delight, hiding his anger, “I must confront Narcissa about Draco, and I shall be back shortly, My Lord.” Lucius bowed and apparated back to the Malfoy Manor.
“Running a bit late Potter?” Draco laughed, and sat in the last carriage. “Unless you would rather walk, I suggest you get in, not that I would care to leave you behind.” Draco smirked as Harry climbed in.
Neville stopped at the familiar sound of yelling and peaked through the slightly open door. He needed to be quiet so he could figure out what was going on. He had been at Hogwarts for a day and all the professors were being quiet about something.
Harry sighed in utter defeat. “Fine,” he muttered vehemently. “We can use him, but we would need to manipulate him so he doesn’t get any funny ideas and try and rat on us. I guess we could think of a spell that would strike fear into him so he doesn’t even think about ratting on us. Actually, just throw a spell at his feet and he will crumble on the ground, he’s a coward.”
Harry snapped from the memory, and as if it was put in a VCR, he went back in the memory, focusing on what he had actually muttered.
“Purely educational, you know,” said Harry. “I’ll not do all your work for you, instead I’ll tutor you, as I did with Gemma. You help me and I’ll help you, so-to speak.”
“That’s not comforting, but I’m glad. IF you’re gay I’ll support you, now let’s get you cleaned up and get a few potions in you.”
“Ah, so that’s why you only know a bit, I can speak a bit of French you see, my dad visited Paris once and he taught me a few words,” the rat-faced boy said with a gleeful smile and then proceeded to say a long string of words in French, which seemed almost insulting.
“It’s alright, Mrs Potter,” said the Healer, scratching his chin. “A valid question and one often overlooked. It was something we
“Point made. You’re highly untidy,” Harry muttered and honestly wondered where this whole motherly thing had come from, who cares if Draco had packed or not. “We have about two hours before the exams start, what do you want to do?”
That wasn’t the only issue, though. For the past year, he had been feeling rather weak. His body felt as if he was a Muggle pushing their nineties and unable to walk without a cane or some kind of aid. It was a concerning thought because he, as a thirteen-year-old boy, should be at top form physically. Even then, speaking in itself was a chore and he often found himself gasping or choking on his breath, unable to continue the simple strain of speaking.
Snape quickly rushed towards the room and saw Harry shaking on the floor, it looked like someone hit him with the Cruciatus Curse, “where is Draco?”
“The victor writes history,” said Severus. “Regardless, he did have moments of insanity, but attacking key magical places would lose him more followers. That is the reason why he never held the Ministry, no matter what anyone says.”
Lily and Harry spoke about school for a couple of minutes before the more serious discussion had to come up. It didn’t slip Lily’s attention that no mention of James was made by Harry, nor was the fact that Harry seemed to look around for him like other students did.
Harry woke up surrounded by books of the sorts, he was reading on various duelling spells and how they should be used. He was awake before anyone else so he stayed in bed and read the last of the book he fell asleep reading, Harry heard Neville stir and wake up then almost roll off the bed. Harry took this as a queue to get up; Harry reached for and put on his glasses and flicked his legs out of the sheets and onto the cold ground, Harry groaned as the coldness made his feet shiver.
Hermione walked up to Draco and sat down, “do it, I bet Ron twenty Galleons that you could beat Snape, that’s pretty much Ron’s entire lifesavings!” Ron glared over and shook his head.
He would pull everything out of her head. Every little scheme. Every detail. Every insult. He would know it and he would then destroy her. Targeting Draco would be the last thing Daphne Greengrass ever did.
“The fact I even have to…” muttered Harry, trailing off in a whisper. “You share a dorm with”—he lifted his right hand into a position that Weasley could see it and began taping it, as if counting—“three other people? How have you not heard
Peter whimpered, but held his wand firm in his hand. “I’m sorry, Lily, I never – I never wanted you to die.” He almost sobbed and clenched his wand tighter. “But the Dark Lord needs Harry Potter, Harry must die, not you, not you – just Harry!”
“Shove off, Draco,” said Harry with a scowl. “Are we really going to listen to that oaf? He weighs about ten of us. We can all fit in the boat, it can seat three people on each seat.”
“W-we are? I don’t want to!” Blaise panicked, being roped into shopping. “What are you doing today, Harry?” Blaise smiled oddly, judging by Draco’s actions it was clear what that boy wanted, Harry however was oblivious to it, and Harry was obviously a virgin with no romantic interactions before.
Now for the easy task of making sure her son was awake and ready for the day. She had a lot planned for today and she only had a few more hours before he left to go back to school.
“None of the Slytherin team knew anything about the Bludger,” said Harry. “Being one hundred percent honest about the situation, I have no idea who has the ability to charm a Bludger to attack a student and make it so relentless without the initial charms on the thing overpowering it.”
“Well, you see a lot of it is to do with reactions to the ingredients,” explained Harry as he began tracing a few things on her book. “This will react with this, but not this, you see,” he said while drawing across the page with his index finger. “However, this can cause your potion to overheat, while not fatal and it can be salvaged, its best avoided.”
“I’ll try, professor,” said Neville almost happily. “I haven’t had the time to practice this spell yet as I’ve been focusing on some of the more defensive spells, such as the Shield Charm.”
Harry’s eyes went wide at the sheer amount of detail in one book. He realised that the chapters started of small and got bigger and bigger as they went on, which confused him a little bit. He quickly learned that it was to help ease people into the Dark Arts and not just thrust them with hundreds of pages of information. He quickly flicked to the next page to read more.
Lucius came in and collected Draco, Voldemort dipped the amulet in the potion and it clicked and instantly dried, Voldemort handed it to Draco, he then placed the potion vial into Draco’s hand. “The bottle cannot break, nor can anyone open it.”  Draco nodded and placed it in his robe pocket. Lucius nodded and apparated Draco away.
“Could that be why Nott’s on this spree of charismatic leadership?” said Harry, tilting his head. “Maybe he thinks that if he tries to become a leader – someone eveyone’ll look up to – his family name will continue the good standing.”
“My Lord,” Lucius moved to place the note from Draco on Voldemort’s desk, and watched him read the note.
Less than a week later, Harry and Draco were walking across the Entrance Hall when they spotted a small group of students, obviously gathered around something that was pulling every student that came into the Entrance Hall towards it.
He wasn’t sure where Snape had run off to. He had hardly said anything before he walked out of the room and said that he’d be back in ten minutes.
He listened as Professor Burbage did the roll, his ears perking up at some of the names, especially Granger’s, who wasn’t here yet. He was rather curious on the fact that Granger actually attended this class and wasn’t doing what he was.
The two boys made their way to the stand, Harry’s wounds didn’t heal fully like Draco’s, his bruises and cuts were still visible.
No sooner were they out of earshot than Draco burst into laughter. “Did you see his face, the great lump?” He turned to Harry. “That was glorious!”
Harry gave his parents one final hug and walked into his body, which caused a loud crack and a soft explosion of magic. Harry’s screams filled the room and Dumbledore took his chance to get Draco out of there.
“Of course,” said Harry in a silky tone. “Those two?” he gestured towards Weasley and Longbottom. “Found nothing as they’re banned from the library for another week.”
By now he was sure that Harry Potter would feel the Dark Mark being gently brushed over his left forearm, not like others who received it painfully, this was done gently, as it had to be. He watched as the child glanced down at where the spell had hit with curious eyes, which was a sight to see as he was sure the small child was far too young to understand what had happened.
“Well, yes,” said Harry. “Some Muggles seek to swindle unaware or unsuspecting people, scamming them of their money and giving them fake tickets. If you get them from a credible source, you’ll be fine.”
“Good,” said Ron, smiling. He held out his hand and pulled the boy up. “I know it’s a hard process, but we’ll save Ginny and prove that she didn’t do it.”
“From here on out any students caught fighting will lose fifty house points, as well as serve one month’s detention, it doesn’t matter who started it.”
“It’s just not normal – making things float by saying a few nonsense words,” said Vernon angrily, while he looked at the bookshelf, as if it would fall any moment.
“I know, it is completely flawless, I would use Draco, but I honestly doubt he would go along with it. And I don’t blame him, I also thought about Dumbledore, but that old coot is powerful and I don’t think we could capture him, that old bastard should be dead soon, age will get him soon.” Voldemort laughed heavily and began to pant, “the issue is Harry’s friends, not so much the red-haired one, but that bushy haired Mudblood, she is too smart and assists him whenever she can. I would have taken her but she isn’t stupid enough to get caught, she was very careful when I opened the Chamber, she figured it out.”
Harry turned to see Draco, who seemed to look healthier and healthier as each day went by. It did make sense, though. He wasn’t really sick or cursed, most likely just exhausted and annoyed that he had somehow been trapped into someone else’s web of deceit.
AS Draco had predicted moments ago, Harry began to attack with a cruel ferocity that no one, not even professor Snape, had seen before. With Nott’s stance studied, it was all or nothing because Harry felt like he knew his opponent. Harry had observed Nott’s posture, the pattern of how his arm moved, and how his eyes darted around. That was all that was needed before the one-sided attack began.
He felt Slytherin’s Dagger pushed against his hip and he had to stop his snort. Godric used a sword, Salazar a dagger, Rowena a bow, and Helga was far too caring to actually hunt or maim an animal or another human unless provoked. She preferred calm and friendly words and when they failed, she sicced the other three on the target. She was the healer of the four, making up the perfect triangle of a battle group.
“She knew something,” said Ron, watching as the twins retreated with a struggled step. “I just know it, I can feel it, y’know.”
“Hm,” said Harry, humming. “I never exactly thought of it that way. I just thought he was incompetent.”
“That I understand,” said Harry. “It’s perfectly vague. I’d expect nothing less from a sentient object that has far more power than it should.”
The freckled boy huffed a little before lifting himself up a bit more. “Neville has Quidditch practice, he’ll be back in an hour or so,” he said, smiling at the first-year. “I’ll come with you, if you don’t mind, I wanna watch the practice.”
,” hissed the snake softly as it slithered across the grass and rested its head on the speaker’s leg. “
“You can start to treat him better now, get him on a detention and then talk it out with him. Apparently he likes detentions these days; he’s grown used to them or something.” Draco laughed.
“My sole intent was to bypass your Age Line,” said Harry, grinning. “The strongest known wizard in the United Kingdom… Besting your Age Line would grant far more respect and acknowledgement than winning the Tournament. In fact, I was adamant and certain that the Tournament could sense intent and knew I had no desire in competing.”
Ron sent Neville an appreciative glance before walking a few paces forwards. “It was about here – if I remember correctly – yeah, here,” he said, stopping at the door. “Level with this door – at least I think it was – yeah it was.”
“He – he called me – James, not – father,” added James as he was supported by a few Aurors who came along when they were called, the order to apprehend the Head Auror’s son ignored as they walked past the fuming boy on the way to Flourish and Blotts.
A silence filled over the small group of Gryffindor and Slytherin students. Even the noisy entrance of Seamus and Dean didn’t dare disrupt the tense silence. None of them were wearing robes, so it was nothing more than a petty jab to greet someone as what house they’re in.
“A friend sent me a book on creatures,” said Harry, grinning. “Rather convenient timing, actually. Also, professor, be wary of your right, there’s a head rolling in your path.”
He watched as Fleur copied his action, instead, she had made something to cover her torso. It seemed like Viktor hardly cared about it and Longbottom simply opted for some sort of shoe to cover his feet. He glanced over toward her, nodding and giving a slight smile at the action.
“Previously, the Tournament allowed for potential sabotage between champions. This year, that is no longer the case and all champions will receive a bracelet that will alert all staff should one be attacked. Attacking a champion is immediate expulsion, no second chance if you are found guilty. The Ministry of Magic has allowed the use of Legilimency on any suspect, no matter the age, which should prove useful.
Harry stood on the brick pathway that led into the property of Potter Estate for a while. He waved to David as he drove off and glanced at the little box near the gate. He wondered what the purpose of the thing was. It looked like one of the radios in David’s car, at least a more modern and compact version.
Harry spent the night in the infirmary, the last thing he remembered was a tear inducing pain in the left side of his stomach and being forced to the infirmary by Snape. He stood up slowly, as Madam Pomfrey suggested and stretched his legs before rushing off towards the Great Hall; funnily enough he wasn’t the only person in the infirmary.
Dumbledore waved his wand over the fire, extinguishing it with the correct amount of water to further damage the canvas. “It’s quite fortunate that the Fat Lady was able to escape her portrait in time,” he said as he flicked a flap of the portrait with the tip of his wand. “We must find her as quickly as possible.”
“I see,” said Harry, suddenly aware of everything. “You thought I’d kick you off the team ‘cos you’re gay?”
“I’ll allow you to understand over time,” said Daphne. “I needed to get you away from Potter so we could have this discussion. He’s too ruthless, as I have already witnessed, and that means I would rather this be done discreetly.”
Ernie coughed into his hand. “You know, he used to think that you were nothing but a cold and bitter person… so stuck up that you would never bother to speak to a Hufflepuff, let alone befriend one.”
“Perhaps it’s time to test out the potion on an animal then?” said Professor Snape with a certain look that said everything. When no reaction was given he flicked his wand and a fluffy white bunny appeared on the headmaster’s table. It sniffed around a little and gave a small hop. “Last chance to save an innocent bunny, Mr. Potter.”
He opened his mouth to speak, closing it the second he saw something shimmer in the air.  He frowned for a second before his head erupted in pain. He considered making a noise, but the happy and sheer content on the faces of Draco and Nick were enough to keep him silent.
“Hey,” he said to the third-year Hufflepuff, who paused. “I’m sorry, but you know my name and I don’t know yours.”
Percy peered down at Harry Potter, who was sitting there with a book that he shouldn’t be reading until fifth-year and held out his hand, trying to perfect his skills that he would use in the Ministry after he graduated. “Harry,” he said, as if they were old friends. “How lovely it is to see you.”
Harry laughed. “Now that’s false and you know it. There’s no indication that a psychopath has any sort of fascination with numbers,” he said, scowling. “That, and I’m sure you already know, I’m not a psychopath.”
“Play to the strength of each person,” said Clara. “It’s what we do as a team and it works. Ask the guys after the game, just in case they think you’ll sell our secrets, but I doubt it. Enough chitty-chat, I want to see how
“But he never came for us,” said Fred. “I don’t think he ever learned what it was, seeing as it’s just a blank piece of parchment, but he knew it was dangerous.”
Harry let out a small sigh and began setting out his papers and hesitated in getting out a cauldron to use, he wasn’t sure if they were brewing today.
“Of course it is, Draco,” said Harry, adjusting his tie. “Why do we have to wear these damn things?”
“Anyway,” said James, aware that he was speaking to himself as his wife had rolled her eyes and his son was lost in his own thoughts. “Arthur has been hounding us to come over and watch the television sometime, hoping that his family would understand his need to watch the blasted thing. Enough about that, though. Would you like to continue the explanation, Lily?”
“Would someone not inviting bring you food?” said the man, pulling out a nicely packed package from his pocket. “I made certain that it was in a sealed container and that said container was durable.”
“Please take this to Severus Snape, who lives in Spinner’s End. You know the exact location of his house, I assume.”
“Fine, fine… if I successfully hit Snape with the spell I would get one hundred points, if I failed then I was destined to show of my body for you all to graciously stare at, those fifty sit-ups I do every morning-”
Eventually, the flames vanished and he felt his water should burst, covering him in water. For a split-second, he was glad he was wearing shorts as the water made the trousers even tighter if that was possible. He panted, wiping at his face, trying to clear his vision.
“Back to the issue at hand,” said Atieno. “You do not need to answer right this second, but I do urge you not to dwell on it. While the date of the first task is random, it is usually around this time. At least, the last one was.”
“Avada Kedavra” Voldemort shouted, the room filled green, in a flash it was gone and there was a small green fire burning under Harry. “I knew it, I was clearly so stupid-” Voldemort glared at Lucius, daring him not to say anything, “-this isn’t Harry Potter, it’s his soul. What his soul is doing in my room is anyone’s guess, however… Lucius, do you feel your magic being slowly drained?” Voldemort paused.
He barely got three paragraphs of information on the Black Rose and it was nothing that he wanted. The brief version was that the boy was exiled due to jealousy of a new sibling and he found he had a talent with plants, allowing for a chance at redemption with his parents. The boy assumed that his parents would forgive him based on the fact he had a rare talent and could mend and create plants with a simple push of emotion.
“You think so loud,” said Atieno. “Your underappreciation of meditation upsets me, child. There is an appreciation and a deep reflective state that no one, not even myself, has reached with meditation. You should attempt it.”
Not many had ever seen Neville Longbottom as angry as he was at that moment. His wand came out of his robes at lightning speed, the skill of a slightly trainer dueller. “Say that again, Potter.”
He propped one of the books that he had found in the Restriction Section onto his legs and began to slowly read the book, hoping that he would find something about Boggarts.
“None of the books are cursed, so you won’t need to keep your wand handy,” said Lucius. “I counter the wine and alcohol in the cupboard. You may be mature, but you’re twelve, going on thirteen, and you may have a lapse of sanity and intelligence and try and sneak a bottle of my fine wine. One sip of that wine and you’ll be on the floor, slobbering and drooling over it, unable to forget even the simplest of sentences.”
Harry took the wand happily, he couldn’t wait to test it out, and he gave it a little wave and yelped in surprise as it was yanked from his fingers by Mr. Ollivander.
Hermione rolled her eyes and picked Draco up and whispered into his ear. “The spell I cast isn’t deadly; it’ll just knock you out for about two hours. That should be enough time to distract Madam Pomfrey so you can help Harry!” She smiled at Draco. “Come on Ron, we need to get Malfoy to Madam Pomfrey as soon as possible, that and we cannot be seen. If we take too long I fear that the spell may actually be fatal.” She trembled while trying to hold Draco steady.
Harry finished all his classes and was reading a charms book, Harry knew Draco was correct, he could do advanced spells but he put way too much power into minor spells, Harry didn’t exactly see ‘Aguamenti’ as a simple spell, but he flooded the classroom with it. It’s not only that but he also garnished some amazing control over the ‘Incendio’ spell, of course Harry knew this had to do with the fire dragon spell he used during the duel and something about Godric being amazing at fire spells. Harry couldn’t help but wonder why he was good at both fire and water spells, it wasn’t suddenly, he was always adept at such spells, but now it seemed to be improving. Come to think of it, when Harry used ‘Rictusempra’ to tickle Ron last year it flung him across the room, instead of tickling him.
“I bet you’re loving this,” said Harry, his hands clenching. “Just salivating at the fact you’re finally better than me at something. No one cares about dancing, Granger, your skill in the subject is
Pansy forced him up and unbuttoned his robes, “whatever Draco, you don’t intimidate me in the slightest, I know you want to lay next to him in your little tighty-whities, you cannot fool me.”
Draco almost tripped over his feet. “Why not! There’s so much that we’ve got to look at and do there!”
“Please,” said Sirius, rubbing his head weakly. “I meant no harm, I just don’t trust his motives. He vanishes for months, years even and then comes back and acts as if nothing has happened?”
“It is rumoured that the song of the phoenix distresses those that have strayed too far from the path of the light,” said Albus, his face remaining blank. “Those that willingly dabble in the dark or forbidden are considered an enemy of the phoenix.”
“I’m only three years younger than you both,” said Harry. “I’m old enough and talented enough to bypass Dumbledore’s Age Line and do something that no other student could manage.”
He didn’t debate it, though. He needed to find Draco and get away from the area before a professor walked by.
Harry stopped in the middle of Diagon Alley when he saw the sigh, which caused Draco to walk straight into his back. “Draco, look!” he said, gesturing towards the sign with a look on his face.
Harry nodded, that had to be it, Harry followed them and sat at the table waiting for the food to appear.
Petunia’s lips formed into a very fine line and she glanced at her nephew. “Are you sure you know how to actually cook?”
“That’s not English, is it?” a boy near Dudley asked, slightly curious. “What languages do you know?”
Narcissa couldn’t help but chuckle at the slightly whiny tone of her son. “Harry knows that no matter what happens, we’ll always be behind him,” she paused, holding up her hand to silence her son. “Even if he was condemned to death, we would remain behind him.”
“If I remember right, it was one of your ancestors that helped found a trading hub around here,” said Harry, tilting his head. “It was hidden in the forest and contained things that would cause suspicion, but that’s how your family line acquired the land and maintained it. To Muggles, someone owns the land where your house is and the forest and entering it is an almost death. I assume it’s the wards that keep people out, but people have muttered serious danger inside the forest.”
,” said Tom, sounding like a proud father who just witnessed their only child doing a feat that shouldn’t be possible. ‘
“Engorgio!” he muttered, watching as his trunk returned to its proper size. “Thank Salazar for the fact we can do magic in here.”
“But you stated that he was a drug user!” said David, looking a little paler than usual.  He had spoken to James Potter a few times before, mainly when said man came and introduced himself as a ‘special agent’ that was assigned to look after the Prime Minister and the Queen. “I don’t want to call you a liar, but I know for a fact that your mother is alive and that your father doing drugs makes very little sense…”
“Oh! I’m sorry that I made the wrong assumption! Were you looking down Longbottom’s pants? Not that I’d judge you based on that – I’m a very open person, you know and wouldn’t dare hold that against you,” said Harry dramatically. He made a move towards the four Gryffindors with a slight smirk. “After all, in the Slytherin common room, we frequently hold various competitions on who has the biggest –”
“It’s still good that you got some information on him to keep his hands tied,” continued the Baron. “I must admit, though, I do dislike how you handled the situation. Threatening his pet will just come back on you if something happens.”
“No, no. No, he won’t,” said Ernie, his tone soft. “I spoke to Justin’s mum and she was all for allowing him to remain here, seeing as this is the first year that something like this has happened and that he needs the education.”
Snape waved Ron and Hermione out of the room and he proceeded to grab Draco by the collar. “I know there’s more to this, follow me to my office.” He quickly let go of Draco as McGonagall looked back, “Minerva, I am going to take care of Draco, and then I will round up the Slytherin children and make sure they’re okay-” Snape focused his full attention on Minerva, “-you try and find Albus.” Snape started to walk and Draco followed.
“Of course, I cannot help but think if you feel as if your team were expandable,” continued Harry, pushing all the right buttons. “I cannot wait to see you get decimated on the pitch, Wood, it’ll make the won all that much sweeter. Here’s some parting words: watch your back.”
“I can’t speak French,” said Harry, unabashed. “I’ll just take what you said as something positive. Anyway, this is Draco Malfoy and I’m, well, you already know. As for the Tournament, I don’t much care about whether you see the book titles that we’re hoarding, unless you’re interested in
He covered his eyes with his forearm, trying to reduce the strain of brightness the walls had on them. Even though he poked fun at the colour, he hated to admit that the Chudley Cannons had chosen a quite nice orange, it was just garish when overused.
“Jealous?” repeated Draco, looking at the boy with disdain. He didn’t exactly need to shout anymore, the entire courtyard was listening in. “Of what? I don’t want a foul scar across my head, thank you. I don’t think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.”
Harry just continued to smile as the professor explained what they were doing and how they were doing it. He was rather interested to go to a Muggle cinema as he hadn’t ever been to one. He knew what a cinema was, of course. His mother often claimed that they should all go but things always came up and it was often forgotten.
“It was madness,” said James, shaking his head. “They would have been sold out in an hour if things weren’t being done slowly so that people had time to get down. It hardly helped that there wasn’t a rule on the fact that one person could buy as many tickets as they desired.”
“It’s hard to explain clearly, but an object can pull you towards it if it has been laced with magic, normally the items have been placed under various traps to lure thieves and such to it and then be killed.”
“I’m just that good,” said Harry, watching as the plates and remaining food vanished. “And now, I assume, we get to listen to Dumbledore drone on and on before we get to go to sleep.”
Harry and Draco followed Lucius into a dingy shop that held an almost broken sign reading: Borgin and Burkes. The moment the door to the shop opened, a soft ringing bell sounded and a scuffling sound was heard from somewhere out the back of the shop. Harry glanced around the shop, looking at the various items, with disdain, his nose slightly turned up when he saw dust lined over a shelf.
“Tell me, Child, tell me something unique about your house at Hogwarts and I may reveal a letter in my name.”
He decided, remarkably quickly considering his state, that he would remain quiet and allow for Severus to make his point. There was no point in arguing with Severus Snape. Sanity aside, it was a dim-witted thing to do due to how acerbic Severus could be. Even then, remaining silent when thinking causes great pains in his head was the only viable option he had.
“One night without what?” said Ron, climbing into his bed without hesitation. He shifted and pulled his trousers off, same with his t-shirt.
“Far more intense than you seem to think,” said Atieno. “I swear we have had this discussion before. No matter how advanced you are for your age, you are not at the magical capacity of those that have come of age. You believe that everyone has an equal amount of magic that increases with age, correct?”
Harry shook his head, even if he saw her pointing at the badge on Percy’s chest. “I haven’t,” he said, realising that the woman was looking at her son with a proud smile. “Congratulations, Percy. How does it feel to be the last Head Boy that will attend Hogwarts in this generation?”
Harry rolled his eyes, “if you spent less time standing around and doing something you wouldn’t have lost and you embarrassed yourself.”
“Even though I planted most of these plants, I cannot help but admire them daily.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled, even more in the light from the sun. “What about you Draco, what brings you out here?”
“Perhaps,” said Harry slowly, not wanting to provoke the large boy. “You’re Quidditch Captain? Nice.”
Petunia got up and pulled out a chair and slumped in it. “You know, I never really disliked Lily, especially when she went off to Hogwarts.”
“We have already gone over this, Karkaroff!” said Professor Moody, barking out the words with as much disdain as he could manage. “Let’s not do it again.”
“Perhaps not the best word for it… perhaps companions would work better. You wouldn’t split up father and son?”
“Don’t you understand, Weasley?” said Harry. “I wouldn’t allow myself to fall into the same situation that you’ve found yourself in. If I, or my family, needed money so badly that we were unable to survive without money, I would hunt down a job that I could do during my breaks from school. Whether it’s the Christmas break, which is where most businesses hunt for young people to do small things for a few Sickles a day.”
He only just opened the book and of course fate, the cruel mistress, wouldn’t allow him a moment of solitude and allow him to read more than four words before he realised someone was sitting on the edge of his bed, their weight causing the bed to drop slightly. ‘Better not be Crabbe or Goyle,’ he thought, closing the book slowly. ‘I’ll burn these sheets if it is.’
Theodore nodded and decided to just change the subject, not wanting to talk about a subject that could cause issues for the small group. “I wonder what we’re being served for breakfast today. Yesterday was the usual for the day, but today is the random day. I hope its pancakes, to be honest.”
“Come on, Lily,” yelled James, his voice slightly panicked. “We’ll make it out and – and then we’ll come back and collect anything that we need when it all settles down. Not everything is lost.”
“That doesn’t make sense, how come I know a spell you don’t Dumbledore? You’re more powerful than me.”
Pomfrey glared him up and down and proceeded to step out and took a quick look at him, “what happened?” She said with no emotion.
The Weasleys had won some Galleons and were taking a trip in August to visit Egypt, which was where Bill was staying. He didn’t know how Arthur had won it, but he had and the man had been ecstatic and almost quivering in happiness as he tried to hide it from his family so he could surprise them.
Harry sat in his usual spot in the large library, a bookcase hiding the view of him. He opened Riddle’s diary and quickly dipped his quill into his inkpot and wrote on the page, hoping for a detailed answer that would soothe him.
, pleading that he needed to pass the year, no matter what. He had already been scouted by a few teams and he had to graduate. No team wants a player that isn’t able to pass the N.E.W.T.s.”
“I award fifteen points to Mr. Potter, from Slytherin, for his astonishing ability to help those in need, and try and assist everyone with knowledge. As well as fifteen points to Miss. Bones, for also taking out the initiative to seek out other houses when in need of assistance.”
Harry sat in the unofficial Slytherin stand just across from the Quidditch field, however he was in earshot range and could hear what was being said, only faintly.
With a soft crack, the Boggart morphed into a mutilated corpse. It slowly shambled towards the boy, hoping to feast on his flesh.
“Each of those tasks were not simple tasks, either,” said Atieno. “You are a gifted wizard, I will give you that, but these Tournaments are a death wish. Nothing more, nothing less. You do not need the money and you do not need the prestige. There are many ways that you could have used to prove that you are more powerful, more talented, and a better wizard overall than Dumbledore without disregarding all common sense, self-preservation, and then entering something that has a mortality rate of seventy-three per cent.”
“So, it’s definitely something to do with adults for themselves?” said Jude. “Seems a bit uppity. They’ve got all year to do whatever they want and now they’re trying to cut into our school time?”
“Harry,” breathed Lily. She had thrown open the door with enough force to crack the glass in it. “I’m glad you’re alright!”
Harry grabbed Dumbledore’s arm and the world around them twisted, Harry started to feel sick, they popped and landed in Dumbledore’s office, Dumbledore conjured Harry a bucket. “We can’t expect you to not vomit on the first attempt, after all. When I first apparated I did the exact same.”
“Then yes, Rosier, they’ll be dangerous to us as they have no idea who’s an enemy and who’s an ally. It’ll attack the first human it sees. That explains the lights and the charm that went over them. The statues would be deterred from going into those zones and would avoid them, even if a threat was there.”
Adrian clenched his fist, “have you been ignoring me? That’s why we scout the first game, they’re versing Hufflepuff, and I assume Harry could do that one in his sleep.”
He watched as Potter gave a tiny smirk and waved his wand over the ward, a small trail of black poured from the tip of his wand and created a circle in the ward that allowed Potter to stick his hand in and grab what was needed.
Harry paused and stopped himself from putting the letter down. He was aware that James was being difficult about the Tournament, claiming that it was a risk and not worth the measly reward, which he agreed with, and had been firm in his belief that it was beyond stupid to do. However, these thoughts had never been voiced to him by some miraculous luck. Of course, he had seen the lashing that Longbottom had gotten for wanting to participate in the Tournament, making him smile for an entire day without fault.
Harry stopped reading the book when he realised that it was nothing more than a journal of some crazed wizard that liked to joke about various branches of magic and things that would make most witches and wizards shudder. He learned a few things and they weren’t helpful for his current situation at all.
“And?” repeated Hermione, staring at Ron. “She added so much emphasis on gift and her look sort of clouded over when she spoke about it. I don’t think that it’s a gift that he has.”
“I will teach you all about us in due time so that you can use that knowledge to earn respect,” said Atieno. “Even a human can be considered a king amongst the vampires if he has the knowledge and strength of a vampire.”
“Well, sir, we know you plan to bury Harry, but we have a theory, and that burying him is a bad idea.” Hermione glanced at Draco, hoping he would finish it, as he knew more.
He stood in the middle of the corridor, his wand resting against his right leg. He was waiting for the four Gryffindors to speak before he would do anything. Maybe they would say something he could use against Nott. Of course, not much was really said verbally, at least not for a while. It was just a whole lot of staring.
“To stop people meddling and asking questions,” said Lily. “No one will ask a question if it supposedly cannot be answered.”
consequences. Our patience for cheaters has worn thin and we will not tolerate it. Let this be a lesson.”
“Don’t mind Nick!” shouted Sir Patrick’s head from the floor. “He’s still upset we won’t let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say – look at the fellow –”
The Master Mutilator replicated the spell across from him, creating a wall of fire so hot it instantly turned the tree into a scorched mess that was instantly hit with a Blasting Curse, filling the air with ashes, which he sent with a spell to replicate the breeze of wind, towards his opponents.
“Regardless,” said Rosier. “You manipulated him to groom you into the next Quidditch Captain. You were one of the best Seekers that Slytherin’s had in many years and you resigned from the team to take on Captaincy issues? Flint knows that losing you was a massive loss and he did what you asked. You played him like a fool and no one saw it.”
“Stop tormenting her,” muttered Tracey under her breath. “Salazar help me, you two are just as bad as each other.”
Harry jumped when he heard the shouting by the woman, even more so when it came out in French and he only understood two of the words said. “Mr. Flamel –”
Lucius placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder, “come, we have plenty of things to discuss.” Lucius lead Draco towards the apparation point just outside Hogsmeade and apparated directly into his study, something he hardly did as the wards around the Manor didn’t like it, but he had to avoid Narcissa.
“Yes,” both Hermione and Ron muttered while they continued walking behind Hagrid, still curious of that rather large snake that could have attack them at any moment.
“I was only just hired, I was filled in on most people, I was informed to treat a few people better than others and the Malfoy family and Harry Potter is on the top of the list.” The man regretted saying it, but lying wasn’t his strong suit.
“All makes sense,” muttered Harry. “Near the end of the year, I’ll cast it on your wand and we can start practising more advanced magic without it being theory only. You can only learn so much from books and tomes, right?”
“I think Harry would be very offended that you think he’d die,” said Narcissa. “He’s brave, intelligent, loyal, and a great friend, especially to you, I don’t think he’d leave you behind.”
“Come in, come in,” said Dumbledore as he gestured the professors into the room, ending with Professor Quirrell, who happily took his usual seat. “It’s been a month since out last meeting and I decided that we should hold these monthly instead of each fortnight, it’ll allow us to stop repeating information and allow new information to pass through.”
He quickened his step and made it to the dungeons in almost record time. He stood at the door to the classroom for a whole of three minutes before he pushed it open, revealing an empty room.  He knew it would be as potion lessons were never back-to-back as the classroom had to be aired out after each lesson and sometimes the charm on the room took a little while to vent out the air. Not only that, but mixing vapours of potions can have disastrous effects on the nose and cause some drowsiness in students.
“Why, child? Why do you dislike werewolves?” said the man, leaning closer to the child. “How do you know that I’m not a werewolf in disguise, hoping to figure out your opinion and then capture you when you provide the wrong answer?”
“He’s right, Albus, in a sense, he is correct,” said Arthur, ignoring the gasp from his wife. He was flabbergasted at the sheer thought that his daughter could do something foolish. “Ginny, haven’t I taught you anything? What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain. Why didn’t you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic!”
Harry said nothing for a minute before he dropping in defeat onto an armchair, ignoring Rosier, who cried out about being sat on. “Mother is going to kill me, isn’t she?”
“He’s not you,” interrupted Harry. “They require your consent. They could ask me, as I am your age and not bound by the rules of the school, but I couldn’t. We hate each other, Greengrass, you made that clear. If I go into your head, it would be excruciating for you, which could make it worse. Dumbledore won’t allow that.”
The said teacher looked all about three seconds away from exploding in a fit of curses – not the wizarding type either – and yelling at everything and anything that he saw walk into his peripheral vision. He did not expect to be mocked in his own class, by an uppity little rich kid, who assumed he was better then everyone. “Right, yes, let’s play dodgeball – we have wasted too much time,” he said in a rough tone of voice. “Captains are Mr. Dursley and – uh – Miss. Anderson.”
“‘A threat’,” repeated Daphne with a scoff. “No one is a threat if he just made people practice and not demanding they attend stupid games. No one cares about the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw game, but he’s made it out like it’s the best thing ever.”
“Professor Snape… I’m going to try and find Albus and Harry Potter.” McGonagall turned to face the students, “please in the meantime would you all head towards your respective common rooms and try and not gossip about tonight. Would Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and Draco Malfoy please come to here?” McGonagall asked it as a question, but the three of them knew better, it wasn’t a question. “Professor Snape would like a word with all three of you.” McGonagall took her leave after that.
Professor Snape knew that the story was ridiculous, but he wanted to see how far he could make the boy lie to cover his tracks. So far, he was acting like a Slytherin, but also he was doing something no Slytherin should do, and blow the lie out of proportion.
Harry watched as Neville slowly walked towards the professor, his feet pausing slightly before each step. It was almost painful to watch. For a brief moment he panicked that if Longbottom didn’t do something, the Stone could be taken before he even got a chance to see it.
’ while aiming your wand upwards. Yes, you may cast it in the middle of a spell and it will still work. Rule three: there is no honour in whining. Accept your defeat and focus on getting better. Do not whine and moan about unfair tactics. We Japanese pride ourselves on honour and prestige, not victory. Do you agree?”
“You’ll have to kill her, Longbottom,” said Harry, studying the situation with rapt interest. “If he’s already possessed her, then there’s nothing you can do to save her.”
“I placed the Philosopher’s Stone in here, not many people would think of something like this, so I thought it was pretty genius,” said Harry, flicking open the dummy book, revealing the blood red crystal. “What I’ll most likely do is send Mopsy to collect my share of the Elixir whenever it’s ready instead of me coming, it’ll stop suspicion rising that way.”
“If Peter does come over tomorrow, I don’t want Harry to be here when he arrives,” she said, trying not to laugh at her husband. “That may thwart his plans slightly.”
The noise in the Slytherin common room was almost deafening and louder than usual. Most of the chatter revolving around the upcoming Quidditch match, which caused most people to join in one large discussion, which was louder than several small conversations. Of course, a large majority was about Gryffindor’s new Seeker and speculation on who it could be and who it couldn’t be. While the boy’s pretty much huddled up over the sport, the girls rolled their eyes and split off into their own little groups, gossiping.
“You could be right, you will find out when it triggers and a spell you cast nearly blows up the bedroom.” Dumbledore already knew what triggers Harry’s power, he refused to say however.
“Ask any of the professors,” said Clara, sniffing. “I was the perfect student and never stepped a single toe out of line.”
They made it to class on time with a few minutes to spare, despite Draco’s reassurances that they would have plenty of time to set up. Many other students straggled in, scuffing their feet as they found a seat to sit in.
Harry, who was glaring at his tie, hadn’t noticed Draco waltz into the room, fully dressed, and standing behind him. So when he turned and hurled his tie towards his bed, her caught Draco in the face with it.
“He’s hurting, we’re all hurting.” Hermione whispered, she glanced around trying to locate Draco, but he wasn’t anywhere to be seen.
“Bad with dates,” repeated Narcissa in the same tone that it was said in. “You do realize how ludicrous that is?”
Harry snuck into the room, taking a piece of toast from the plate that had been put aside for him as he walked out the door, and placed a piece of bacon onto it. He smiled at his mother and sat in a nearby chair, which just so happened to be in hearing range if the argument between mother and son ever dropped to a lower voice level. He took a small bite of his toast, picking at the bacon with nimble fingers. He severed the fat from it with ease and smirked at Weasley.
“This is how a duel should be, Miss Greengrass,” said Professor Snape. “It should take time, precision, and care. It is not something you should rush into. I applaud them both.”
He reached the room, whispered the password, and entered the room, shocked to see Fleur Delacour sitting there, looking like she had been there for quite a while. He pondered this and wondered if she had been in the room when the feeling start, negating the annoying feeling entirely. Something must have shown on his face as the young woman laughed, shaking her head.
Harry leaned over and pushed his hand into her bag, despite Pansy gasp and moan of protest he grabbed a few treats, “thanks Pansy.”
Cho Chang was good, in a sense, but she didn’t have the training or the experience on a broom that Longbottom did. Longbottom was a natural flier and he could play any role on any broom and hold up against most.
“I have duelled him before,” said Professor Snape. “He is quick to adapt and will not make the same mistake twice. I doubt he could beat a seventh-year in a duel, however. I am urging you not to keep challenging him. It will do you more harm in the future than it would good. He tends to hold grudges for a very long time.”
“I guess that makes sense,” said Vasily, giving the man next to him a pointed look. “But, honestly, what makes you think a young child like yourself would stand a chance against seven people? If they were planning to sabotage the event, they wouldn’t throw out Ticking Charms, would they?”
